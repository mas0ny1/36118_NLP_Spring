dialog: A Screenplay by Robert Nelson Jacobs
scene_heading: EXT. FRENCH TOWN (WINTER, 1959)- ESTABLISHING - DAY
text: We are looking down at a village of cobblestone streets and ancient timber-framed walls.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY
text: In the doorway of the CHURCH,, we see the COMTE DE REYNAUD, 40's, the town's resident nobleman, pale and
text: austerely handsome in a dark vested suit - greeting TOWNSPEOPLE entering church.
text: When all the parishioners are inside, the Comte steps inside and closes the door behind him. The Town Square is
text: empty and quiet.
speaker_heading: STORYTELLER (V.0.)
dialog: (woman's voice, quiet and sly)
dialog: Once upon a time there was a poor little village in the French countryside,
dialog: whose people believed in "tranquillité." Tranquility.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - LATER
text: The CONGREGATION singing a hymn, dutifully.
speaker_heading: STORYTELLER
dialog: Ifyou lived here, you knew your place in the scheme of things.
text: Sitting in a pew together are THREE OLD WIDOWS (MADAME POUGET. MADAME RIVET, and MADAME AUDEL), sober
text: white-haired women who always wear the traditional black dress of the country widow.
speaker_heading: STORYTELLER (CONT'D)
dialog: You understood what was expected of you.
text: CAROLINE CLAIRMONT, playing the church organ, is @ primly dressed woman in her late 30's who sings with great
text: conviction. She glances over at:
text: LUC CLAIRMONT, Caroline's 14-year-old son - a freckled, tense, frail boy who is silently staring down at his hymnal.
speaker_heading: STORYTELLER (CONT'D)
dialog: if you had anxieties, you learned to hide them.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE REVEALS Luc is hiding a SMALL SKETCH PAD in his hymnal and is skillfully drawing a SKETCH OF
scene_heading: THE CRUCIFIXION - EXCEPT THAT CHRIST'S FACE LOOKS LIKE LUC’S OWN FRECKLED FACE.
text: Luc notices his mother looking scoldingly at him - so he awkwardly joins in singing, his adolescent voice cracking.
text: Across the aisle from Luc is YVETTE MARCEAU, a robust, buxom woman whose singing is loud, lusty, off-key. Yvette's
text: 10-year-old son, BAPTISTE, squirms with boredom; Yvette's husband ALPHONSE MARCEAU, is asleep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STORYTELLER (cont'd)
dialog: And if, by chance, your hopes had been disappointed...
text: Yvette glances over at her bald pudgy husband Alphonse, who is drooling slightly as he sleeps open-mouthed...
speaker_heading: STORYTELLER (cont'd)
dialog: .. you learned to sing a brave song.
text: Yvette forcefully sings a HIGH NOTE aimed towards Alphonse's ear - and her shrill off-key voice STARTLES ALPHONSE
speaker_heading: AWAKE.
speaker_heading: The HYMN ENDS.
text: Up on the pulpit, PERE HENRI, 22, a baby-faced priest, nervously begins his sermon:
speaker_heading: PERE HENRI
dialog: Good morning.
dialog: (clears his throat)
dialog: The season of Lent is upon us. This is, of course, a time of abstinence.
dialog: Hopefully also a time of reflection...
text: Suddenly we hear WIND whistling through cracks in the windows. This slightly unnerves Pére Henri. He glances at:
text: the COMTE DE REYNAUD in the front pew. The Comte GIVES PERE HENRI A SUBTLE NOD OF REASSURANCE - and the
dialog: priest continues:
speaker_heading: PERE HENRI (CONT'D)
dialog: Above all, let this be for us a time a time of sincere penitence...
scene_heading: EXT. "LES MARAUDS" - DAY
text: The town's marshy slum by the RIVER TANNES.
text: With strange suddenness, the WIND is becoming shrill and forceful... and we discern, in the distance, TWO
text: MYSTERIOUS FIGURES plodding along the riverbank - a Woman and Child - their faces totally hidden by the long
text: hoods of their medieval-ooking, blood-red capuchons.
scene_heading: (MUSIC OVER: "THE WIND THEME")
text: The Woman is burdened by an old suitcase and a big burlap sack; the Child carries a valise. They huddle together for
text: warmth as they trudge through the wind-whipped snow...
speaker_heading: AERIAL SHOT
text: of Lansquenet as we ride the wind towards the town square...
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY
text: The WIND now whips through the village, making shutters flap wildly against ancient walls. The ripped awning of the
text: abandoned Patisserie snaps in the wind like a tattered flag.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - DAY
text: The WIND is RATTLING THE ANCIENT STAINED-GLASS WINDOWS and WHISTLING through cracks in closed doors; it's
text: so noisy that we hear only bits and pieces of Pére Henti’s sermon. The young priest appears quite flustered by all the
dialog: racket.
speaker_heading: STORYTELLER (V.0.)
dialog: To live in this village was to respect tradition...
text: Ina rear pew we see DIDI and DEDOU, 8-year-old fraternal twins in matching sailor suits (sitting with their parents
text: FRANCOISE DROU, a stiff, elaborately coiffed woman and JEAN-MARC DROU, a man with slicked-down hair, dapper
text: suit and pocket watch). Didi is distracted by an odd noise: the WHINE of a dog? He glances back at:
text: GUILLAUME BLEROT, a shy sweet man of 70, who awkwardly smiles at Didi, The BLACK NOSE OF A SMALL SICKLY
text: OLD DOG (CHARLY) - pokes out of Guillaume’s overcoat and WHINES, upset by the howling wind. Didi’s eyes go wide
text: with surprise. Guillaume raises a finger to his lips - imploring Didi not to tattle - then nudges the dog back into his
dialog: coat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STORYTELLER (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: ..to mind your business...
text: Didi's mother (Frangoise) sharply raps the boy on the back of the head - and he turns back around.
text: This amuses a man across the aisle, SERGE MUSCAT, 50, a hale, ruddy-cheeked, barrel-chested man with a sporty
text: mustache. Sitting next to him is his wife JOSEPHINE MUSCAT - an unkempt woman in her 30's in an ill-fitting dress,
text: and a drab scarf around her head.
text: Joséphine is glancing furtively at the OPEN HANDBAG of a Woman sitting next to her. With a silent, sudden
text: movement, Joséphine snatches a GOLD-PLATED PILL BOX from the handbag... and shoves it deep into the pocket of
text: her own coat. She glances over at her husband, to make sure he didn’t see her do it. Like @ child, Joséphine seems
dialog: both proud and ashamed of this little victory.
speaker_heading: STORYTELLER (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: ..to know which problems could not be solved -
text: Suddenly the massive CHURCH DOOR is BLOWN OPEN BY THE WIND and BANGS AGAINST THE WALL - bringing Pére
text: Henri's sermon to a stammering halt.
text: ANGLE - LOOKING INTO THE CHURCH FROM OUTSIDE THE DOORWAY
text: as the Comte de Reynaud gets up and calmly walks towards us.
speaker_heading: STORYTELLER (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: - and which ones could.
text: The Comte SLAMS the door on us.
scene_heading: EXT. "LES MARAUDS® - DAY
text: The harsh wind rattles the small, dilapidated houses of Les Marauds, as the shrouded WOMAN and CHILD continue
text: trudging along.
scene_heading: EXT. AN OLD, RUNDOWN, SHUTTERED HOUSE - DAY
text: The Twa Figures enter the fenced-in front yard; a few CHICKENS scamper out of their way. The Woman KNOCKS on
text: the front door. No one answers.
speaker_heading: THE SHROUDED CHILD
dialog: (shivering against the wind)
dialog: Poor Pantoufle... he’s freezing, maman.
text: The Shrouded Woman tentatively tries the door... and finds that it's unlocked...
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM IN THE HOUSE - DAY
text: ARMANDE VOIZIN, 69, in a faded housecoat and fallen stockings, dozes in her chair with a book of Rimbaud’s poetry.
text: Adead cigarette, with a half-inch of ash at its tip, dangles from her lips. A CAT laps up yogurt from a bowl.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the Cat snarls in alarm. Armande is startled awake, and the ash falls from her cigarette. Armande fumbles
text: to put on her THICK EYEGLASSES - and GASPS in alarm when she SEES:
text: THE TWO FIGURES (still fully shrouded by their red capuchons) warming their wind-coarsened hands at the fireplace.
speaker_heading: THE SHROUDED WOMAN
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: Sorry to frighten you.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: Who the hell are you?!
text: The Shrouded Woman pulls back her hood: our first look at VIANNE ROCHER, a striking young woman with a wild dark
text: mane of hair, a confident smile, and a startlingly direct gaze.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: I'm here about the patisserie.
text: Armande glares skeptically at Vianne.
speaker_heading: VIANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd like to rent it. And the apartment above.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: Where are you from?
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (matter-of-factly)
dialog: Well, we lived in Andafucia for awhile... and before that, Tubingen... and
dialog: before that, let me see -
text: The Shrouded Child pulls back her hood: ANOUK, 8, is a flush-faced girl with the same strong, candid gaze as her
dialog: mother.
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: - before that, Pavia. 1 detested it there. So did Pantoufle. Detested it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (explaining to Armande)
text: Pantoufle is her kangaroo.
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: (to Armande)
dialog: Only he can't hop.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (confidentially to Armande}
dialog: Bad leg. War injury.
text: Armande is staring incredulously at Anouk and Vianne.
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: (to Armande)
dialog: Anyhow, he detested it, because the water made him sick.
dialog: {confidentially)
text: Tummy trouble. Diarrhea.
text: Armande keeps staring at them...
speaker_heading: ANOUK (CONT'D)
dialog: So, how's the water around here?
scene_heading: INT. DOWNSTAIRS IN THE PATISSERIE - DAY
text: OPEN ON: intermittent spurts of BROWN-ORANGE WATER coming from a faucet.
scene_heading: WIDER ANGLE - THE PATISSERIE
text: Vianne shuts off the faucet. She surveys shelves full of cobwebs and rat droppings. Anouk writes her name in the
text: dust on a glass display counter.
text: Armande finishes counting money that Vianne has just given her.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: {sternly)
dialog: I'll expect you to keep the place in good condition.
text: Vianne reacts with deadpan incredulity. Armande, walking with her cane, exits from the shop.
scene_heading: EXT. CHOCOLATERIE - DAY
text: Armande walks away from the shop, stil! with a stern look on her face... but now we detect a slight glimmer of
text: amusement in her eyes.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Vianne unpacks her big suitcase; in addition to clothes, she takes out an array of ancient GUATEMALAN ARTIFACTS:
text: - @ DECORATIVE TILE of *El-chuah," the Mayan Patron Saint of Cacao, grinding cacao beans with a primitive tool
text: - a WOODCUTTING showing a Mayan King drinking chocolate from a hollowed-out gourd
text: - a BOWL depicting the four Maya Wind Gods tilting their heads over cacao pods
scene_heading: - the "WHEEL/PLATE" OBJECT
text: And, with particular care, Vianne takes out a CLAY URN with a cacao tree design. Vianne gazes reverently at the urn
text: and sets it on the bedside table.
text: Anouk emerges from a CRAWL SPACE UNDER THE STAIRS - a dark, cramped recess that goes back several feet - and
text: proceeds to “furnish” it, bringing in a cherished, ratty old blanket and a battered little framed picture of a pirate ship.
text: Vianne casually lays out THE DRIED, MOLTEN SKIN OF A SNAKE on the window sill, hangs a SACHET OF DRIED
text: HERBS over the doorway, and places sticks of SANDALWOOD under the pillows of the bed.
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: {re: crawl space)
dialog: Needs a door.
text: Vianne unpacks a large woven TAPESTRY with a with a colorful Mayan design and begins to hang it as a curtain over
dialog: the craw! space.
text: Anouk glances out the window at the town square...
speaker_heading: ANOUK (CONT'D)
dialog: What a nice town this is.
dialog: (fishing for reassurance)
dialog: Don't you think so, maman?
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Yes it's lovely. It's a lovely town,
text: Anouk is anxiously CHEWING ON STRANDS OF HER OWN HAIR, a nervous habit.
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: Maman? Pantoufle wants to know how long we can stay.
speaker_heading: VANNE
dialog: (breezily)
dialog: Oh, teil Pantoufle not to worry.
speaker_heading: (a BEAT)
dialog: Time for bed.
text: Vianne sits down on the bed, and pats the pillow next to her:
speaker_heading: VIANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on.
text: Anouk hops up into bed, snuggling up next to her mother.
speaker_heading: VIANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: What story tonight?
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: Pantoufle wants to hear about grandmére and grandpére.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Not tonight.
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: You always say that.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: How about the Tale of the Yellow Dwarf -
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: Pantoufle detests made-up stories.
dialog: Tell about grandmére and grandpére.
text: Vianne uneasily eyes the Mayan Urn on the table.
speaker_heading: WANNE
dialog: Not tonight, sweetie.
scene_heading: INT. PATISSERIE - DAY
text: Vianne, on her knees scrubbing, looks tired and disheveled. Anouk also has a scrub-brush, but she's pretending it's a
text: ship, and using a hair barrette as the ship's "cannon":
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: Prepare to fire!
dialog: (doing a different voice:)
dialog: Aye-aye, mon capitaine! All hands astern!
dialog: (whispers, aside to Vianne)
dialog: That's you, maman.
text: Vianne smiles tiredly and continues scrubbing the floor.
speaker_heading: ANOUK (cont'd)
dialog: Ready, aim - FIRE!
text: Anouk launches the barrette across the room, and it lands on:
scene_heading: AMAN'S SHINY BLACK SHOE
text: And now REVEAL that the shoe is on the foot of the COMTE DE REYNAUD; Vianne and Anouk are startled to see him in
text: the open doorway, a somber figure in his dark overcoat.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: Forgive the intrusion.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Please come in.
dialog: oo
text: The Comte steps inside.
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: (re: his shoe)
dialog: Sorry, monsieur. Pirate attack.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Of course. What's your name?
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: Anouk. What's yours.
text: The Comte kneels dawn beside Anouk and hands her the barrette with a courtly flourish.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: The Comte de Reynaud, at your service.
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: (excitedly)
dialog: Areal one? Like the Comte de Monte Cristo?
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: (thin smile)
dialog: He was not a real one.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (amused)
dialog: To what do we owe the honor of your visit?
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: As Mayor of Lansquenet, ! want to welcome you to our community and invite
dialog: you to worship at Mass this Sunday.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: That's very kind of you. But actually we don't attend.
text: The Comte is thrown off by this.
speaker_heading: VIANNE (cont'd)
dialog: (amiably)
dialog: We're glad to be so near the church, though. We'll enjoy singing with the
dialog: bells - won't we, Nou-Nou?
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: (to the Comte)
dialog: Would you like me to sing "Sur le Pont D'Avignon” -
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: (to Vianne)
dialog: The bells are not intended to entertain, madame. They are a solemn call to -
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Mademoiselle.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: Pardon?
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (cheerful, unapologetic)
dialog: Mademoiselle. {I’ve never been married.
text: He is taken aback. His disapproving gaze flicks back and forth between Vianne and her illegitimate daughter.
speaker_heading: VIANNE (cont'd)
dialog: But feel free to cali me Vianne. | do hope you'll stop by when open for
dialog: business next week.
text: The Comte studies Vianne as if measuring an opponent. Anouk, sensing tension, idly starts chewing on strands of her
dialog: hair.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: Opening a patisserie during the Holy Lenten Fast... One could imagine better
dialog: timing.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Oh but Monsieur le Comte - it's not going to be a patisserie.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: Then may | ask -
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: It's a surprise.
text: Vianne extends her WET GRIMY HAND to the Comte. He hesitates... then shakes it gingerly.
speaker_heading: VIANNE (cont'd)
dialog: it was sweet of you to drop by.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY
text: The Comte walks with a dignified air, tipping his hat to TOWNSPEOPLE who respectfully greet him with "bonjour,
text: Monsieur fe Comte." (His dark suit and fedora hat contrast with the workday clothes and casquettes of the
dialog: Townspeople.)
text: In front of the TOWN HALL is a STATUE OF A 17TH CENTURY NOBLE. The Comte is about to enter Town Hall - but
text: notices the Statue has ICICLES HANGING FROM ITS NOSE. The Comte reaches up to gently flick the icicles off the
text: Statue's nose.
scene_heading: INT. TOWN HALL - MAYOR'S OFFICE - LATER
text: The Comte sits in his second-story office, among musty historical tomes, maps, documents; and a PHOTO of THE
text: COMTESSE DE REYNAUD, a dignified, handsome woman of 40.
dialog: 
text: The Comte is writing in an antique manuscript book, labeled: "LANSQUENET HISTORICAL PROJECT." (Through the
text: door we hear an o.s. TYPEWRITER.)
text: An UNEATEN CROISSANT WITH MARMALADE sits on his desk, spotlighted by a lamp. The Comte glances at the
text: slistening croissant, regarding it with yearning - but he does not eat. Instead he forces himself to write.
scene_heading: INT. TOWN HALL - AN ADJOINING OFFICE - SAME
text: CAROLINE (the woman who played the church organ) is TYPING, referring to a handwritten page. On her desk is a
text: PHOTO of her son Luc, smiling forlornly. As she works, Caroline's eyes fill with tears - but she purses her lips bravely
text: and keeps typing.
text: The Comte emerges from his office, manuscript book in hand:
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: have completed the 18th Century.
text: He starts to hand her the manuscript - and notices her tears.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD (cont'd)
dialog: Madame Clairmont...?
text: Reynaud stands there awkwardly, not knowing how to deal with this display of emotion.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Your letter to the editor, Monsieur le Comte. This paragraph about family and
dialog: tradition...
dialog: (indicates handwritten page from which she's been typing)
dialog: it's beautiful.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: (surprised, flattered)
dialog: Oh... well...
text: Reynaud starts to sit down on the desk - but that feels too informal to him, so he stiffly stands up again.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: (dabs her tears, smiles)
dialog: Forgive me. | must be getting old.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: No no. {... value your...
text: Caroline, looking @ bit embarrassed, resumes typing.
text: The Comte glances out the window and SEES: two NORTH AFRICAN MEN unloading crates. VIANNE comes out of the
text: patisserie and greets the North Africans with a hug. She makes some wisecrack, and they share a laugh.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: rf (to Caroline)
dialog: May | ask... if you have had any contact with your mother lately?
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: (surprised, wary)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
text: It seems she has rented out the patisserie.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Oh. Well, | haven't talked to my mother in quite awhile -
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: I'm sorry, | didn’t mean to pry -
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Don't be silly. 1 have no secrets from you.
text: She smiles. He smiles too: nervously, a bit thrown off by the flicker of warmth between them. They hold each other's
dialog: Saze for just a split-second too long...
speaker_heading: CAROLINE (cont'd)
dialog: {clears her throat)
dialog: How is the Comtesse enjoying Venice?
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: The Comtesse. Fine, thank you. She is, yes. Enjoying it. Venice, 1 mean. |
dialog: Sot a letter just yesterday - excellent letter, very descriptive. | miss her. Her
dialog: Sister has the flu, actually.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Oh that’s a shame -
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: - yes, mm-hm, so they've not been to the museums yet, actually.
text: He fumbles with the book in his hands, puts it on her desk:
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: If you could have this done by next week, please?
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Certainly.
text: He turns and hurries back into his office. After a moment, Caroline dutifully resumes typing.
speaker_heading: MONTAGE:
scene_heading: EXT. PATISSERIE - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: GUILLAUME (the shy, sweet old man) walks his dog CHARLY. The sickly ald dog stops to sniff around the edges of the
text: patisserie’s door. Guillaume gently tugs Charly's leash, pulling him away from the door.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY
text: TWO WOMEN PUSHING BABY CARRIAGES glance across the Square and see Anouk steadying a stepladder on which
text: Vianne is standing; Vianne is taking down the patisserie’s old, broken sign. Anouk notices the two women Jooking her
text: way - and they avert their eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - EVENING
text: BOYS in their early teens are playing Roulette de Vélo: rolling an old bicycle tire up and town the street, each team
text: trying to push the tire past the opposite goal-line. As the tire goes past Vianne’s shop, a couple of the Boys pause to
text: glance in through a little rip in the newspaper covering Vianne's shop window:
speaker_heading: THE BOYS' P.0.V.:
text: VIANNE AND ANOUK INSIDE, scrubbing copper pots.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT
text: Vianne steps out of the Patisserie and throws a pail of sudsy water out into the street.
text: Across the Square, curtains in 2 window part slightly, and a biack-clad old widow (whom we'll come to know as
text: MADAME POUGET) peers out at Vianne with dubious curiosity.
text: When Vianne glances up in her direction, the curtains instantly close.
scene_heading: EXT. PATISSERIE - DAY
text: DIDI AND DEDOU (the twins) walk home from school with their bookbags. The twins peek into the shop through the
text: edge of the newspaper-covered window:
speaker_heading: THE TWINS’ P.0.V.:
text: Vianne cleaning a ANCIENT-LOOKING STONE BAR in the kitchen.
scene_heading: EXT, TOWN SQUARE - DAY
text: A group of ELDERLY TOWNSPEOPLE are standing close together on the street, talking among themselves and trying to
dialog: peer into the patisserie.
text: The COMTE DE REYNAUD happens by - and the group disperses.
scene_heading: EXT. PATISSERIE - NIGHT
text: JOSEPHINE (the unkempt, mistrustful-looking woman with the scarf around her head) hurries down the street with a
text: baguette. Seeing the patisserie’s door slightly ajar, she peers in with wary curiosity -- and sees Vianne grinding a
text: huge dried chili pepper in an old-fashioned Mortar-and-Pestle.
text: Vianne, sensing someone watching her, turns toward the door - and Joséphine quickly hurries away.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - MORNING
text: The COMTE DE REYNAUD is heading across the Square toward the Town Hail - when he notices movement inside
text: Vianne's shop. He steps over towards her shop and squints in through the newspaper-covered window:
speaker_heading: REYNAUD'S P.0.V.:
text: The drab walls have been repainted bright coral; VIANNE is dipping a PASTRY BRUSH into a red-brown liquid in the
text: Mortar-and-Pestle, then using the brush to paint a DECORATIVE DESIGN on the wall - a repeated pattern with the
text: primitive simplicity of a cave painting.
scene_heading: EXT. PATISSERIE - NIGHT
text: SERGE MUSCAT (the hale, barrel-chested man) and JEAN-MARC DROU (the dapper man), both DRUNK, swagger
text: down the street SINGING "Chevaliers de la Table Ronde" - and stop to glance at the patisserie with bleary curiosity.
speaker_heading: SERGE

speaker_heading: END MONTAGE.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY
text: The BOYS are playing their usual game of Roulette de Vélo.
scene_heading: EXT. CHOCOLATERIE - DAY
text: For the first time, VANNE REMOVES THE COVERING from the inside of her shop window.
text: YETTE (the robust, buxom woman) is riding by on @ Motor Scooter - but COMES TO AN ABRUPT STOP, awestruck by
text: the DAZZLING DISPLAY OF CHIC CONFECTIONS in the window: pralines, Venus’ nipples, truffles, marzipan rolls,
text: mendiants, candied rose-petals, sugared violets... A SIGN reads:
speaker_heading: CHOCOLATERIE “MAYA"
text: Now CAROLINE and LUC (Caroline's tense, frail 14-year-old son) walk by - and stop to look at the amazing display.
text: Now the shop door OPENS, revealing VIANNE and ANOUK in bright red smocks (in contrast to the drab-colored clothes
text: of the townspeople). Some Boys from the Roulette de Vélo game come running by, and their attention is caught by
text: the dazzling candy display - causing them to momentarily forget about the bicycle wheel, which now ROLLS SMACK
text: INTO CAROLINE, knocking her off balance.
text: BOY #1 rushes to retrieve the bicycle wheel.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: {comes outside; to Caroline.)
dialog: Are you alright?
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: (to Boy #1)
dialog: You should be more careful!
speaker_heading: BOY #1

speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Why don't you come in and sit down for a minute?
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: (firmly, to Vianne)
dialog: Please don't trouble yourself -
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: No trouble at ail. I'm Vianne Rocher.
text: Caroline shakes Vianne's hand in the formal French fashion:
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Caroline Clairmont, The daughter of your landlady. This is my son Luc.
text: Lue shyly shakes Vianne's hand, not looking her in the eye.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: And this is my Anouk.
text: {then, seeing that Caroline is unsteady)
dialog: Please - come in where it is warm.
text: Caroline reluctantly allows Vianne to iead Luc into the shop. Yvette also follows the others in ...
scene_heading: INT. PATISSERIE - A SHORT TIME LATER
scene_heading: OPEN CLOSE: A STEAMING POT OF HOT CHOCOLATE
text: which Vianne is preparing.
scene_heading: WIDER SHOT - IN THE PATISSERIE
text: The wails are painted CORAL AND RED, and decorated with Vianne’s PRIMITIVE HAND-DRAWN DESIGNS. Vianne's
text: MAYAN ARTIFACTS are prominently displayed: the Maya King drinking chocolate... the Wind Gods... "El-chuah"
text: &rinding cacao... and the "WHEEL/PLATE OBJECT." There are bar stools at the counter, and a little sign in florid
dialog: calligraphy: "Gateau au chocolat 10F (fa tranche)."
text: Luc sits at the counter, on one of several bar stools, with Caroline standing next to him. Vianne is preparing the hot

speaker_heading: VIANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: The pepper triangle, that's for you.

speaker_heading: SERGE
dialog: Oh yes, Monsieur le Comte, she likes it very very much, Just yesterday she

text: Suddenly Vianne is startled by the REFLECTION of the COMTE DE REYNAUD on the window. She turns and sees him

speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: You told me you would not be selling sweets.
speaker_heading: VIANNE

speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Interesting piece, isn't it? It's all about the sacredness of chocolate. See
dialog: these four Wind Gods? They're infusing cocoa pods with their divine blood -
text: The Comte reacts with obvious disapproval.
speaker_heading: VIANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: | should think you'd be fascinated. The Maya drank cocoa in their

speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Mademoiselle. But | do wish you'd call me Vianne -
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: Enough!
text: Vianne is a bit startled by his vehemence.
text: Through the window, we SEE Anouk stop running on the stairs. Sensing trouble, she watches Vianne and the Comte
text: through the glass.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (quiet, conciliatory)
dialog: | mean no disrespect. Honestly | don't.
dialog: (re: Mayan bow!)
dialog: I'm just showing you that maybe we have something in common.

speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: Are we going to have to move again, maman?
speaker_heading: WITH VIANNE

scene_heading: INT, FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - DUSK
text: Yvette enters, alone and miserable. She sees Alphonse sleeping open-mouthed by the radio. On the counter she

text: her head, murmuring to herself:
speaker_heading: YVETTE
dialog: Don't be pathetic.

speaker_heading: CAROLINE

scene_heading: EXT. STREET QUTSIDE THE HOUSE - DUSK

scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - DUSK

speaker_heading: ALPHONSE
dialog: Merde!

scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - LATER

speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: No, it's alright, leave it.
text: Madame Rivet, very confused, puts the tray back down, curtsies and hurriedly leaves the room.
text: Reynaud puts down his fountain pen and stares intensely at the glistening jam. He leans forward and inhales its

speaker_heading: GUILLAUME
dialog: I'm so sorry -

dialog: Bonjour, Monsieur Blerot.
speaker_heading: GUILLAUME

scene_heading: INT. CHOCOLATERIE - DAY
text: Vianne sees GUILLAUME, with CHARLY, hovering uncertainly in the doorway.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Come in, monsieur, come in.

text: from under the counter and kneels down to entice the dog.
speaker_heading: VIANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, boy. Got something for you.
text: The old dog, sniffing the air, pulls weakly on his leash. Guillaume reluctantly allows the dog to lead him inside.

dialog: What's your name?

dialog: Charly. He's 14. That's 98 in people years.

speaker_heading: GUILLAUME

dialog: Oh... |... mustn't. You see... Madame Aude! is in mourning for her husband.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Oh I'm sorry. When did he pass away?
speaker_heading: GUILLAUME
dialog: The War. German grenade.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: But... it's been 15 years since the War. Surely by now -
speaker_heading: GUILLAUME

speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: By the way, has either of you seen the new shop across the square?

dialog: If T need help | ask for it!
text: With difficulty Armande gets onto the stool by herself. Vienne gives the "Wheel/Plate Object" a Spin:
speaker_heading: VANNE
dialog: What do you see in it?
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: Not a damn thing.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Come on, it's a game - what do you see?
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
text: | see a cranky old woman too tired to play games.
dialog: Vianne considers this.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: I've got just the thing for you.
text: Vianne pours a cup of hot chocolate. Armande glances back at the door where Anouk almost ran into her.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: That little girl of yours... does she mind it?
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Mind what?
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: (‘isn't it obvious?")
dialog: Well the way you move her from place to place.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (a bit uneasy)
dialog: Oh |... She's doing fine. | think it's good for her. Seeing new places, meeting
dialog: new people...
text: Vianne adds a small amount of COARSE-LOOKING POWDER to the hot chocolate.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: Your cinnamon looks rancid.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: it's not cinnamon. It's a special kind of chili pepper -
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: Chili pepper?! In hot chocolate?
text: Vianne finishes off the concoction with créme chantilly, then slides it towards Armande,
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: It'll give you a lift.
text: Armande skeptically sniffs it. Intrigued, she takes a sip.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: Tastes like... | don't know... something | must've tasted a long time ago.
dialog: (takes another sip)
dialog: Yes... | think when | was a girl...

scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - A SHORT TIME LATER
text: in the empty classroom, Anouk, Didi and Dédou have been put "au piquet": kneeling in silence with foreheads

speaker_heading: DEDOU

dialog: My mother says you don't have a father.
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: (whispers) )
dialog: Sure | do.
dialog: {matter of fact)
dialog: We just don't know who he is.
text: Dédou nods, as if that explained it perfectly.
speaker_heading: ANOUK (CONT'D)
dialog: (with pride)
dialog: 1'm unusual.
scene_heading: INT. CHOCOLATERIE - DAY
text: Armande, hot chocolate in hand, is gleefully reminiscing:
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: | was out all night with him. We swam naked in the Tannes. At dawn, when f
text: slipped back in the house, into my bed - my mother pokes her head in and says
dialog: “wake up, sleepyhead!" She had no idea I'd been gone!
text: Armande bursts out laughing. Vianne laughs too, charmed by Armande's spirit.
text: Then Armande notices PERE HENRI outside, peering into the shop. Her laughter peters out; she gives him a defiant
text: “what's-your-problem?" glare. He smiles awkwardly and nods helio, then continues on down the street.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE (CONT'D)
dialog: {re: hot chocolate)
dialog: You sure you didn't put booze in here?
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Something better.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: You ought to give some to my daughter. Melt that chilly disposition of hers.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: You and Caroline have a problem?
text: Armande smiles bitterly.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: Do we have a problem? She won't let me see my grandson! i'm cut off from
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Why -
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: I'm a "bad influence." Because | don’t like her treating him like a trained
dialog: poodle, | swear that boy doesn't make piss without her permission.
text: Armande shakes her head disgustedly.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE (cont'd)
dialog: Ever since her husband died, she's been so... The way she frets and fusses
dialog: over that boy. if she‘d just let him run, let him breathe - let him live! She's
dialog: always so worried he'll “over-exert" himself.
dialog: (laughs harshly)
dialog: Not much danger of that. She won't even let the poor kid ride a bicycle!
speaker_heading: WANNE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Do you think he'd like to see you?
text: Armande falls silent, fighting the sudden impulse to cry.
text: Now YVETTE bustles into the shop, HUMMING CHEERFULLY.
speaker_heading: YVETTE
dialog: More of those bean thingies, please?
speaker_heading: VIANNE

speaker_heading: YVETTE
dialog: How many have you got?
scene_heading: INT. CAFE DE LA REPUBLIQUE - EVENING
text: A dozen MEN enjay their evening drink. SERGE finishes serving a pastis to a patron, then quickly sits down at a table

text: (Jean-Marc is DRESSED FOR HUNTING, at his side are four dead THRUSH that he shot today.)
speaker_heading: SERGE
dialog: (plays a card; to Jean-Marc:)
dialog: The jack of hearts is a craftier hunter than you, eh? He shoots the trump
dialog: right out from under your nose!
text: Jean-Marc simmers with frustration.
text: Now VIANNE and ANOUK enter. Several men look askance at them: what are they doing here during the all-male
dialog: drinking hour?
text: Serge takes his place behind the bar, greeting Vianne with a rogue's smile, checking out her body with his casual
dialog: gaze.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Are you Monsieur Muscat?
speaker_heading: SERGE
dialog: The one and only.
dialog: (flirtatious, "debonair")

speaker_heading: JEAN-MARC

dialog: (complaining to Serge)
dialog: Now we've fost our fourth!
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: Hil play - | adore Belote.
text: All the men in the café look at the little girl incredulously. Several of them laugh with mild amusement.
scene_heading: INT. SUPPLY ROOM BEHIND THE BAR - SAME
text: Joséphine stands at a cluttered supply table, looking at various items that she has pulled from her pockets - including
text: the GOLD-PLATED PILL BOX we saw her steal. She touches the objects, turning them over and over in her hands, as
text: if they were talismans from which she's trying to draw comfort.
speaker_heading: VIANNE (0.S.)
dialog: Joséphine. Hello.
text: Joséphine, taken by surprise, quickly stuffs the objects back into her pockets.

dialog: Does Serge know you're here?
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Does it matter? Do me a favor. Try one of these almond cremes, tell me if
dialog: you think it's a little heavy on the Cointreau.
text: Joséphine eyes Vianne warily.
text: She takes one of the almond cremes, starts chewing... and her face starts to light up. (TRACK IN on her face with

speaker_heading: SERGE (0.S.)
dialog: Joséphine!
text: Joséphine freezes, abruptly spits out the chocolate in her hand, wipes her hand quickly against her skirt; she turns to
text: look for something to wipe her hand on, but can't find anything, so starts hurriedly licking her hand instead.
text: Vianne, surprised by the intensity of Joséphine's fear, studies her with sympathy.
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: You are trouble! He - he talks about you. He says - he says you're indecent,
dialog: he says you're -
dialog: {as if it were an awful insult:)
dialog: - an influence, that’s what you are, you're an influence!
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Fortunately | don't have to listen to a word your husband has to say.
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: Not him. Reynaud. The mayor. He - he talks about you.
text: This stops Vianne. She just stares at Joséphine.
scene_heading: INT. CAFE DE LA REPUBLIQUE - BAR - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Time to go.
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: May | collect my winnings?
text: Anouk takes @ dead THRUSH from in front of Serge, who does a slow burn. The other men chuckle at his misfortune.
text: Vianne takes Anouk by the hand and heads out of the cafe. Joséphine stands in the back doorway, watching, half-
text: hidden behind a curtain. She moves her hand to her mouth, smells it, gives it a gentle lick.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENUE DES FRANCS BOURGEOIS - EVENING
text: Vianne and Anouk (who is proudly carrying the dead thrush) walk away from the café.
scene_heading: EXT. CAROLINE'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
text: LUC, wearing a coat and a big furry hat, sits on the front stoop, DRAWING SOMETHING WE DON’T YET SEE on his
dialog: sketchpad.
text: VIANNE is out for a stroll. She approaches him.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Mind if ! take a peek?
text: Luc looks up, startled. His voice is hushed, nervous, polite:
dialog: Luc
dialog: Oh, it's not really...
text: Vianne looks at the drawing: a skillful rendering of a DEAD PIGEON lying on the cobblestones nearby, its head twisted
text: at a disturbing angle.
speaker_heading: LUC (cont'd)
dialog: (apologetic)
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: | didn't say anything.
dialog: Luc
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (anxiously)
dialog: | exaggerated the angle of the head just a bit, on purpose, you see?
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: You draw beautifully. What's your going rate?
dialog: Luc
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: To draw a portrait. How much would you charge?
dialog: Luc
dialog: Oh | couldn't - I'm not really a -
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Does 50 francs sound reasonable?
text: Luc, amazed to be taken seriously as an artist, nods wordlessly.
speaker_heading: VIANNE (cont'd)
dialog: When could you come by my shop?
dialog: This makes Luc uncomfortable...
speaker_heading: LUC
dialog: Oh... your shop. I'm sorry but... the Comte forbids it.
text: This hits Vianne like 2 slap in the face.
speaker_heading: LUC (cont'd)
dialog: He spoke to maman...
dialog: (quiet, apologetic)
dialog: -+ and a lot of others.
text: Vianne silently nods to herself, her eyes angry and pained.
speaker_heading: LUC (CONT'D)
dialog: I wish I could come. | really do.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Whatever you say. Thanks for showing me your drawing.
text: Vianne resumes strolling down the street,
text: Lue, unsettled, watches her walk away. Just before she turns the corner, he impulsively calls after her:
dialog: Luc
dialog: Wait.
scene_heading: INT. TOWN HALL - MAYOR'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: The Comte sits writing. On a plate, spotlighted by the lamp, is an uneaten hunk of baguette with rillettes. His eyes
text: wander to the food. He puts down his pen, gazes longingly at the rillettes - but does not eat, He resumes writing.
text: Now there's a KNOCK at the door. The Comte puts the plate of food in a desk drawer and closes it.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: Come in.
text: He's surprised to see VIANNE stride into his office.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (quiet, angry)
dialog: Am | breaking any laws? Tell me - am | hurting anyone?
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: Are you asking my opinion?
speaker_heading: VANNE
dialog: What exactly have you been telling people about me?
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: Only the truth - mademoiselle.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Well if you're expecting me to just shrivel up and blow away, you're going to
dialog: be highly disappointed.
text: The Comte leans back in his chair, eying her coldly.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: Let me put things in perspective for you. The very first Comte de Reynaud -
dialog: Auguste René Christophe - expelled the Huguenot radicals from this village.
dialog: He spent a quarter century pursuing that goal.
dialog: (a casual shrug)
dialog: You and your truffles present a lesser challenge.
text: He resumes writing.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD (cont'd)
dialog: {without looking up)
dialog: You'll be out of business by Easter, ! promise you.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN HALL - MOMENTS LATER
text: as Vianne unhappily exits. Passing the STATUE (the one with the nose icicles), she notices the NAME ENGRAVED ON
speaker_heading: ITS BASE:
dialog: Auguste René Christophe de Reynaud
dialog: 1564-1637
text: Vianne regards the statue, angrily -- then kicks it and strides across the square.
scene_heading: EXT. CHOCOLATERIE - MINUTES LATER
text: Vianne begins to open the door and is startled to see Joséphine peeking out at her from the garden doorway.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Joséphine! How long have you been standing there -
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: | forgot to pay you for something... the other day. I'm sorry.
text: Joséphine opens her purse to look for money.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: It was a gift -
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: People talk. They tie about me. | don’t steal. Not - on purpose. ! didn't -
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: It's okay. It's nice to see you, Joséphine. Would you like to come in for some
dialog: chocolate?
text: Joséphine looks up from her purse.
scene_heading: INT. CHOCOLATERIE - LATER
text: Vianne places a cup in front of Joséphine, who is emptying her pockets of various objects that she puts on the
text: counter: lipsticks, necklaces, rings, etc. Joséphine surveys the objects, then chooses the GOLD-PLATED PILL BOX
dialog: (that we saw her steal) to give to Vianne:
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: Here. For you.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (awkwardly)
dialog: That's sweet of you.
text: Vianne looks at the Pill Box, turns it over - and sees an ENGRAVED MONOGRAM: a stranger's initials.
text: Joséphine, suddenly seeing the monogram, panics slightly - but before she can say anything:
speaker_heading: VIANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you, it’s lovely.
text: Vianne puts the Pill Box in her pocket and pours Joséphine some hot chocolate. Joséphine takes a sip.
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: | heard you don't go to church,
speaker_heading: VANNE
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: JOS...PHINE
dialog: You won't last long here. People talk.
text: Joséphine tips her cup and spills a bit of chocolate.
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry. I’m behaving badly, aren't 1?
text: Joséphine lets out an odd little laugh, and aggressively wipes the counter with the cuff of her sweater.
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE (CONT'D)
dialog: You don’t misbehave here. It's just not done here. Did you know that? If you
dialog: don’t go to confession... if you don’t dig your flowerbeds... if you don't
dialog: pretend...
dialog: (very agitated)
dialog: ...df you don't pretend you want nothing more than to serve your husband
dialog: three meals a day and give him children and vacuum his chair so it'll be
dialog: clean enough to receive his ass, then - then you're crazy! You're -
text: Joséphine stops herself, shaking her head, embarrassed...
text: Vianne puts a comforting hand on Joséphine's shoulder - but Joséphine angrily shoves her hand away.
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE (CONT'D)
dialog: You think I'm stupid. To stay with him.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: No. | don’t think you're stupid.
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: Well | am. And weak! | don't love my husband and / lie.
text: Vianne sighs, shakes her head.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Things could be different for you, Joséphine. Serge doesn't run the world.
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: He might as well.
text: Vianne studies her for a moment... deciding whether to press her further, or back off.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: 1s that what you believe?
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: | know it.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Then it must be true. My mistake.
text: Joséphine suddenly gives Vianne a sweet smile, picks up the chocolate cup, as if to warm her hands on it.
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: (sweetly)
dialog: You make the most wonderful chocolate!
text: Joséphine's smile is still warm and genuine. Vianne, a little perplexed, just looks at her...

speaker_heading: ARMANDE (cont'd)
dialog: Book of poetry.
dialog: This disappoints Luc. But he's polite as always:
speaker_heading: LUC
dialog: Oh. Thank you,
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: You don't like poetry?
speaker_heading: LUC
dialog: (awkward, polite)

scene_heading: EXT. LES MARAUDS - DAY
text: We're looking at a MAKESHIFT CHILDREN’S "FORT" fashioned around a group of trees with massive exposed roots.
text: ANOUK is among a small group of BOYS and GIRLS {including DIDI, DEDOU, and BAPTISTE) playing a spirited game
text: of "Jailbreak": the “Cops” try to capture the "Crooks* and put them in “jail cells" (tiny caverns formed by the tree
text: roots); the "Crooks" try to free captured comrades while avoiding capture themselves.
text: Dédou captures Anouk (by tagging her) and places her in one of the little “cells”.
scene_heading: ANGLE - IN THE "CELL" WITH ANOUK
text: It is dark and snug - visually similar to Anouk's Crawl Space at home. Anouk snuggles up against the thick, rough,
text: soil-encrusted roots, making her fee! cozy and protected.
text: The frenzied activity of the other children around her seems to recede; she's in her own snug, safe little world...
text: Then Baptiste reaches in to “free” Anouk, taking her hand to lead her out of the cell - but she resists.
speaker_heading: BAPTISTE
dialog: Come on!
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: | like it here.
speaker_heading: BAPTISTE
dialog: But you're free!

speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: Free someone else!
speaker_heading: BAPTISTE
dialog: That's not how you play!
text: He tries to grab her foot to drag her out - and she angrily shoves him to the ground.
text: The other kids stop and stare at Anouk. She shrugs defiantly: she's not going to move.
scene_heading: INT. CHOCOLATERIE - DAY
text: Luc sits next to Armande, listening to her read from RIMBAUD.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: “Will she never have done, then, that ghoul queen of a million dead bodies... |
text: see myself again, skin rotten with mud and pest, worms in my armpits and in

text: Luc is utterly entranced. Armande looks up from the book.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE (cont'd)
dialog: Perfectly wretched, isn’t it?
speaker_heading: LUC
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Perfectly.
text: Vianne sets hot chocolate in front of Luc, but he demurs:
speaker_heading: LUC (cont'd)
dialog: I'm not supposed to -
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: Don't worry so much about "supposed to.”
text: Luc smiles, embarrassed. Hesitantly, he takes a sip.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE (cont'd)

speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: Hey, what about the portrait?
dialog: Lue
dialog: Next time.
text: The words "next time” are sweet music to Armande. Luc exits.
text: Armande looks over at Vianne, who smiles gently.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: Oh don't look so damn pleased with yourself.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT ABOVE THE CHOCOLATERIE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (worried, to Anouk)
dialog: Stay here.
scene_heading: INT. CHOCOLATERIE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Vianne hurries downstairs and sees JOSEPHINE outside, astride a bicycle - her cheeks flushed, her lips twisted into a
text: strange MANIC SMILE. (She's got a suitcase that was clearly packed in haste: clothing sticking out of it.) Vianne
text: opens the door, and Joséphine rushes in.
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: (manic, chattery)
dialog: I did it! I did it! He was so drunk...oh, he woke up, saw me packing, he tried
dialog: to come after me - but I'd already tied his feet with his belt! and -
dialog: {illustrates his fall with a gesture)
text: - boom - right on his face! His big beautiful red face!
text: Joséphine starts to cry.
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE (CONT'D)
dialog: But - was it right? Did | - did i do the right thing?
text: As if to answer the question, Vianne steps towards Joséphine and very gently undoes the scarf covering Joséphine's
text: forehead, REVEALING LACERATIONS AND BRUISES.
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE (CONT'D)
dialog: God, it's stupid, isn't it. | never blame him. Sometimes / even forget... what

speaker_heading: VIANNE

dialog: Okay... okay...
speaker_heading: ANGLE - THE STAIRS

scene_heading: INT. THE SMALL KITCHEN IN VIANNE'S APARTMENT - LATER
text: Joséphine lies in a makeshift bed: quilts piled on the floor. She's silent now, exhausted... gazing up at Vianne, who

text: Then Vianne gets up to head toward the bedroom.
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: (quiet, worried)
dialog: Vianne?
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (Sentle, reassuring)
dialog: 1'll be right in the next room.
text: After a moment, Joséphine nods okay. Vianne goes into the bedroom,
text: Joséphine looks out the window, at moonlit branches dancing in the winter wind. Her eyes are fearful, disoriented,
text: like the eyes of a child suddenly alone in an unfamiliar bed...
scene_heading: INT. CHATEAU DE REYNAUD - KITCHEN - MORNING
text: The Comte, wearing a gardener's apron, ENTERS holding fresh-cut flowers. He puts the flowers in a vase. There's a
text: slight BREEZE trom the open door... and a loose cupboard door slowly swings partway-open, right next to Reynaud.
text: He sees a SMALL JAR OF SUGARED NUTS in the partly-opened cupboard.
text: Reynaud, pale and hungry as ever, nervously eyes the Sugared Nuts with temptation. He swallows hard... and forces
text: himself to close the cupboard.
text: But once again the loose cupboard door blows partway-open in the breeze. He tries to look away, but his gaze is
text: involuntarily drawn back to the Sugared Nuts,
text: Deeply torn, he slowly reaches out toward the jar with a tentative hand. He takes the jar, but his hand is trembling -
text: and he accidentaily drops it, and nuts SPILL on the floor.
text: Mortified, he bends down and hurriedly puts the nuts back into the jar, like a guilty child -
text: - and now CAROLINE ENTERS, carrying a sheaf of typed pages.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Bonjour, Monsieur le Comte. | hope I'm not -
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: Madame Clairmont!
text: The Comte stands up suddenly, putting the jar behind his back - and he's momentarily dizzy, clutching the counter for
dialog: balance.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Has Madame Rivet offered you coffee?
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: Monsieur le Comte?

speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: (re: the typed pages)
dialog: I'm just dropping off the...

dialog: Forgive me, Monsieur le Comte, but... have you been eating?

speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: 'm uh, rather strict in my Fast this year. ! cannot demand much of my

speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD (cont'd)
dialog: You don't deserve that, Caroline.
text: She's surprised and touched that he used her first name.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD (cont'd)

text: She's startled, flattered - but he corrects himself:
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD (cont'd)
dialog: .. the most foyal constituent I have.
text: Caroline smiles slightly. She and the Comte are standing near each other, but avoiding each other's eyes.
speaker_heading: MADAME RIVET (0.5.}
dialog: Monsieur le Comie -
text: MADAME RIVET ENTERS, and is thrown off to see Caroline there. The Comte and Caroline awkwardly step back from

speaker_heading: MADAME RIVET (cont'd)
dialog: (uneasy, not looking at them directly)
dialog: Pardon me. Serge Muscat is here to see you.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT: SERGE MUSCAT'S ANGRY, REDDENED FACE:
speaker_heading: SERGE

dialog: WIDER ANGLE reveals where we are:
scene_heading: INT. CHATEAU - THE DRAWING ROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: SERGE
dialog: And now she repays me - repays my kindness - by walking out on me?!
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: It is natural that you're upset -
speaker_heading: SERGE
dialog: Upset? I'll be the town joke!
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: That is not your concern. Your concern is the Sacrament of Marriage.
speaker_heading: SERGE
dialog: (a BEAT; mumbling)
dialog: Of course of course... the Sacrament.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: Are you prepared to re-dedicate yourself to your sacred vows?
speaker_heading: SERGE
dialog: Me? I’m not the one who walked out!
text: The Comte gives Serge a sharp, chastising look.
speaker_heading: SERGE (cont'd)
dialog: Re-dedicate. Of course. Yes.
dialog: (going for "sincerity")
dialog: Please, Monsieur le Comte - I'm begging for your help.
text: Serge glances up at a formal PORTRAIT on the wall: a Man in 1920's clothes who resembles the Comte.
speaker_heading: SERGE (cont'd)
dialog: My family has always been able to turn to yours.
text: The Comte sighs irritably...

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN OF THE CHOCOLATERIE - DAY

speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: (nervous, eager)

speaker_heading: VIANNE (cont'd)
dialog: You're doing great - I'll be right back,
scene_heading: INT. CHOCOLATERIE - SAME
text: The Comte, at the counter, tries to ignore the dizzying array of sweets, which are making him woozy with hunger.
text: Vianne emerges from the kitchen and strides over to him.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: What brings you here today?
text: She holds up a candy platter right in front of his pale, hungry face.
speaker_heading: VIANNE (cont'd)
dialog: Can | interest you in some Nipples of Venus?
text: He eyes the Nipples of Venus with suppressed panic. He unsteadily steps back - averting his nose from the candy.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: Rumor has it you're harboring Madame Muscat. !s that true?
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: You make her sound like a fugitive.

text: A fugitive from her marriage vow, which God has sanctified.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: You don't say.
dialog: (calls to the kitchen)
dialog: Joséphine, come out here a minute.
text: Joséphine comes out. The sight of the Comte makes her wary.
speaker_heading: VIANNE (cont'd)
dialog: Let his Radiance have a look at you.
text: Joséphine reluctantly goes to the counter. She inclines her head, giving the Comte a close look at the BRUISES AND
text: LACERATIONS on her forehead. He is utterly taken aback.
speaker_heading: VIANNE (cont'd)
dialog: (to the Comte)
dialog: is that sanctified enough for you?
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: | had no idea...
dialog: (softly, to Joséphine)
dialog: How long has...?
text: Joséphine shakes her head: too painful to talk about.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD (cont'd)
dialog: 1 am truly sorry. You should have come to me.
text: Joséphine says nothing. Her head is stil! bowed.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD (cont'd)
dialog: (gentle, reassuring)
dialog: Your husband must be made to repent.
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: (quiet, tremulous)
dialog: Tell him to repent on someone else's head.

scene_heading: EXT. AVENUE DES FRANCS BOURGEOIS - DAY
text: SERGE, JEAN-MARC, ALPHONSE, and GUILLAUME are playing Boules. Serge looks awful: ill-shaven, clothes

speaker_heading: SERGE (cont'd)

speaker_heading: SERGE (cont'd)
dialog: What - ?
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD

speaker_heading: WIDE ANGLE (P.0.V.)

text: to him. He casts an unworried glance over at Vianne... then simply resumes piaying the guitar.
speaker_heading: ANOUK (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispers to Vianne}
dialog: | bet he's the Captain.
text: As Vianne heads toward Roux’s barge, Anouk scampers ahead and tries to clamber or leap onto the deck of the barge
dialog: - making Vianne concerned for her safety:
speaker_heading: VANNE
dialog: (shouts at Anouk)
dialog: Be careful! Don't do that!
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: (misunderstanding)
dialog: Heaven forbid. Might catch our germs.
text: Anouk stops trying to board the barge. Vianne reaches the barge.
speaker_heading: ROUX (CONT'D)
dialog: (nonchalant)
dialog: We're sorry. All of us. Sincerely.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: (a wry shrug)
dialog: Whatever you're here to accuse us of.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: And why would | do that?
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: Well, because we river rats are the dregs of society. With terrible diseases
dialog: and criminal impulses.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Sounds terrifying. {s it true?
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: It's what you townspeople always seem to think.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Oh but this is not my town.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: Hm.
dialog: (casually)
dialog: Then what do you want? You're here to save us? Catholic Aid Society?
dialog: French Family League? Communist Workers? Which idea are you selling?
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: (earnestly)
dialog: Chocolat.
text: Roux looks down at Anouk in mild puzzlement. She regards him with innocent curiosity:
speaker_heading: ANOUK (CONT'D)
dialog: What's a river rat? Is it like a pirate?
text: Roux smiles slightly.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: You could say that.
text: He points to a large old bucket on the deck next to him:
speaker_heading: ROUX (CONT'D)
dialog: (confidentially)
dialog: There's my treasure chest.
text: Anouk jooks dubiously at the rust-stained old bucket... until Roux pulls from it a fistful of colorful, handcrafted
speaker_heading: NECKLACES.
text: Anouk gazes at the necklaces in fascination.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Let me guess. They're for sale.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: A mere 30 francs apiece.
text: Vianne furrows her brow.
speaker_heading: ROUX (CONT'D)
dialog: {acting "hurt")
dialog: I can get 50 for them in Paris.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Then go to Paris.
text: But now something 0.S. catches Roux’s eye. Vianne turns to see what Roux is looking at:
speaker_heading: THE COMTE DE REYNAUD
text: is standing on a knoll above the river, peering down at the gypsy boats with stern disapproval.
text: He sees Vianne, locks eyes with her.
scene_heading: BACK WITH VANNE, ANOUK, ROUX
text: Vianne, with a defiant gleam in her eye, turns to Roux:
speaker_heading: VIANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: (brightly)
dialog: We'll take two, please.
text: Roux - sensing that Vianne is making some kind of point - looks at her, then back up at the Comte.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (hands him the money)
dialog: Absolutely.
text: Roux hands Vianne and Anouk each a necklace.
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: (putting on her necklace)
dialog: it's beautifull
text: Vianne shoots another defiant giance up at the Comte -
dialog: - but SEES that he’s now GONE.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: (to Vianne)
dialog: L.. should probably warn you. You make friends with us, you'll probably make
dialog: enemies of others,
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: That a promise?
text: Vianne turns and walks away with Anouk,
text: Roux, mildly intrigued, watches them go.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - EVENING
text: SERGE, dressed up in a blue suit, snazzy bowtie, and two-tone shoes, walks in a dignified manner through the
text: Square, holding a bouquet of FLOWERS in the vase he got from the Comte.
text: Across the way, townspeople file into TOWN HALL. A hand-painted SIGN says: "EMERGENCY TOWN COUNCIL
text: MEETING 7:30 - PUBLIC WELCOME," ALPHONSE, YVETTE, JEAN-MARC, and FRANCOISE are on their way into the Hall
text: when they notice Serge - and are amused by his foppish appearance.
speaker_heading: ALPHONSE

scene_heading: INT, CHOCOLATERIE - EVENING
text: Joséphine, alone in the shop, is wiping down the counter. She hears someone KNOCKING SOFTLY on the door.
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: Sorry, we're cl -
text: Joséphine SEES that it's SERGE, with flowers, begging her with remorseful eyes to let him in.
text: She's very surprised by the tenderness in his face. She goes to the door, slowly opens it, and steps outside to face
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: SERGE
dialog: (softly, humbly)
dialog: Joséphine. You look... different.
text: Joséphine regards him warily. He's got the sorrowful, heavy-lidded expression of a guilty puppy dog.
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: You too.
speaker_heading: SERGE
dialog: I want to say... I'm sorry.
dialog: (holds out flowers)
dialog: I've changed, Joséphine. God has made me 4 new man.
text: Joséphine accepts the flowers, but says nothing. This is a difficult moment for her.
speaker_heading: SERGE (CONT'D)
dialog: | ask you... No, | beg you... to accept my apology?
text: She looks at the flowers... then at Serge’s sad eyes. After a long moment:
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: (barely audible)
dialog: Accepted.
speaker_heading: SERGE
dialog: | promise things will be different now.
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE

speaker_heading: SERGE
dialog: Joséphine, please. We are still married in the eyes of God.
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Then He must be blind.
text: She gently closes and locks the door, leaving him standing outside.
scene_heading: EXT. CHOCOLATERIE - SAME
text: Serge just stands there, locked out, stunned.
scene_heading: INT. CAFE DE LA REPUBLIQUE - LATER
text: SERGE sits in the empty, locked-up café - drinking himself into an angry stupor. He's playing an idle drunken game:
text: LIGHTING MATCHES one after another, tossing the matches one-by-one into a glass of Pernod and watching the flame
text: momentarily flare up.
text: He giances out the window and sees a MARRIED COUPLE walking hand-in-hand, laughing together, on their way to
text: the town meeting. Serge sullenly GRUNTS to himself.
scene_heading: INT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT
text: The TOWN MEETING IS IN CHAOS: everyone arguing at once. In the front of the hall sits the five-member TOWN
text: COUNCIL - whose chairman, JEAN-MARC, is frantically BANGING A GAVEL.
speaker_heading: JEAN-MARC
dialog: Order! We must have order! Order!
text: The audience quiets down somewhat.
speaker_heading: JEAN-MARC (cont'd)
dialog: The Council has no legal authority to force them to move. The riverbank is
dialog: public land -
text: More commotion - some people in the crowd HISS...
text: ... until finally the COMTE DE REYNAUD, sitting near the front, rises to speak. The crowd respectfully settles down.
speaker_heading: JEAN-MARC (cont'd)
dialog: (hopefully)
dialog: The Mayor wishes to say a few words?
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: if] may, gentlemen of the Council.
text: The Comte de Reynaud waits until the room is silent... then:
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: (softly)
dialog: They are rootless, godless drifters. Theirs is the way of slovenly pleasure,
dialog: fornication, filth. They would contaminate the spirit of our quiet town... and
dialog: the innocence of our children.
dialog: (almost a whisper)
dialog: They would destroy our tranquility.
text: The room is perfectly quiet.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD (cont'd)
dialog: Our Council Chairman is right. We cannot force them to leave.
speaker_heading: (a BEAT)
dialog: But we can help them to understand they're not welcome.

scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT ABOVE THE CHOCOLATERIE - NIGHT
text: In the kitchen, Joséphine is asleep. Through the open door to the bedroom, we see Vianne and Anouk asleep.

speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE

speaker_heading: SERGE (0.5.)

speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE (cont'd)
dialog: Oh God!
text: Vianne hurriedly starts pushing the kitchen table toward the stairway door, to barricade it.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (to Joséphine)
dialog: Come on - help me!
text: Joséphine, panic-stricken, unsteadily helps Vianne push the heavy table against the door.
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: (frightened)
dialog: Maman...
text: They hear a monstrous POUNDING on the door. Vianne and Joséphine lean against the table with all their weight;
text: Anouk fearfully hugs Vianne's waist. But then:
speaker_heading: SERGE (0.S.)
dialog: (suddenly, strangely gentle)
dialog: Joséphine? Sweetheart? It‘! go easier for you if you open the door.
text: Joséphine is trembling with uncertainty: should she open the door? Vianne looks at Joséphine and shakes her head
dialog: no.
speaker_heading: SERGE (0.8.) (CONT'D)
dialog: (softly)
dialog: 1 don't want to have to hurt you. Open the door, alright dear?
text: Joséphine looks pleadingly at Vianne. But Vianne shakes her head no.
speaker_heading: SERGE (0.S.) (cont'd)

speaker_heading: ANOUK

text: Vianne covers Anouk’s ears, hugging her close. There's a forceful SLAMMING AGAINST THE DOOR, again and again.
scene_heading: INT. CHOCOLATERIE - ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR
text: Serge is repeatedly RAMMING HIMSELF AGAINST THE DOOR. The hinges are starting to give way.
speaker_heading: SERGE
dialog: I'll teach you to mind your business!
text: He's RAMMING IT powerfully... the wood is splintering... until finally he RAMS THE DOOR OPEN, and drunkenly climbs
text: over the door and the table/barricade into:
scene_heading: INT. THE KITCHEN OF THE CHOCOLATERIE - SAME
text: Where he LEAPS AT VIANNE, TACKLING HER TO THE GROUND -
text: - and Anouk SCREAMS as Serge clasps his hands around Vianne's throat.
text: Vianne struggles helplessly in Serge’s ferocious grasp -
text: - and Anouk is SHRIEKING in horror, trying in vain to pull Serge away from her mother -
text: - and Serge shoves Anouk to the floor with his foot and continues to strangle helpless Vianne -
text: - until Joséphine WHACKS SERGE OVER THE HEAD with a huge CAST-IRON SKILLET -
text: - and he collapses unconscious on top of Vianne, like a spent lover. Vianne disgustedly pushes him off.
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE

scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - MORNING
text: CHURCH BELLS ring for Mass. The Comte stands in the church doorway, greeting arriving parishioners. Though he's

text: But then he notices: SERGE lying in the middle of the Square, out cold, stil! dressed in his foppish Bet-up. People
text: riding bicycles have to navigate around motionless Serge.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: (disgustedly, to himself)
dialog: Wonderful.
scene_heading: INT. TOWN HALL - MAYOR'S OFFICE - LATER
text: Bleary-eyed Serge, with a cold compress on his head, sits across from the Comte - who flares sternly at him.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: You realize, of course, that you've ruined any chance you ever had of winning
dialog: her back.
text: Serge shifts uncomfortably under the Comte's steady glare.
speaker_heading: SERGE

speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: His skull must not be as thick | thought!
text: Vianne and Armande laugh. Joséphine looks a bit uncomfortable.

scene_heading: INT,/EXT. CHOCOLATERIE - SAME

scene_heading: INT. CHOCOLATERIE - SAME
text: Armande keeps coaching Luc on making the spoon stick to his nose:
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: Good - now keep your head still.

scene_heading: EXT, CHOCOLATERIE - LATER
text: 4oséphine is sweeping the sidewalk, She glances up and sees REYNAUD walking along the street, formaily greeting
text: passing Townspeople as usual.
text: For a moment Joséphine considers going back into the shop to avoid being seen by Reynaud as he passes... but she

dialog: approaches,
text: Reynaud is @ bit surprised to see Joséphine meeting his eye.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: Bonjour, Joséphine.
text: Joséphine pulls the crumpled “Boycott immorality’ flyer from her pocket and holds it out to him:

speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD

dialog: towards the Comte.
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: ! see. The people of Lansquenet, of course, the people...

dialog: husband. But it's time to go home. Remember the vow you made before God.

dialog: Ahh yes. And please remember me to your wife. Still away in Italy, is she?
text: Joséphine goes into the chocolaterie. A few passing TOWNSPEOPLE greet the Comte with the customary “Bonjour,
text: Monsieur le Comte." The Comte quickly re-composes himself and greets his passing "subjects" with a dignified air.
scene_heading: EXT. CAFE DE LA REPUBLIQUE - DAY
text: One of the MIMEOGRAPHED FLYERS is posted in the window.
scene_heading: INT. CAFE DE LA REPUBLIQUE - DAY

text: cup of coffee, where they SIZZLE and go out. JEAN-MARC and several OTHER MEN are having mid-day drinks.
text: Into the caf walks ROUX and GATI(a 4-year-old river gypsy girl). Serge looks up sharply at them.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: She'd like a soda water. How much is it?
text: Serge eyes Roux lazily. The cafe's patrons are all watching to see how Serge will respond,
speaker_heading: SERGE
dialog: (flippant)
dialog: For you, 40 francs.

speaker_heading: SERGE (CONT'D)
dialog: (“explaining* to Roux)
dialog: There's a soda water shortage. Very serious.

text: Roux calmly takes 40 francs from his pocket and places it on the table in front of Serge. The patrons exchange
dialog: Blances,
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: With a twist of lemon. if you've got any.
text: Serge eyes the money, considering whether to take it. Finally he gives an "oh-what-the-hell” shrug, and reaches for
dialog: the money...
text: Jean-Marc whispers something to another Patron (disapproving of Serge), and the Patron nods in firm agreement...
text: But just then, Serge notices through the open doorway: the COMTE DE REYNAUD is happening by, greeting same
text: passing townspeople.
speaker_heading: SERGE
dialog: (to Roux, but suddenly shouting so Reynaud will hear:)
dialog: This is a respectable establishment! Take your filth somewhere else!
text: The Comte, hearing Serge, steps into the doorway - and his face hardens when he sees Roux.
text: At the sight of Reynaud, all the Patrons straighten their posture, extinguish cigarettes, begin reading newspapers, etc.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: (re: Roux)
dialog: ts there a problem, Serge?
speaker_heading: SERGE
dialog: No, Monsieur fe Comte.

speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: (nonchalant)
dialog: Sure. Could ! have my money back first?
text: Serge blearily looks down at his own hand - suddenly realizing he's still holding Roux's cash. The Comte raises a
text: disapproving eyebrow at Serge.
speaker_heading: SERGE
dialog: (nervously throws money back at Roux)
dialog: ! don't want your filthy money! Get out!
text: Roux leads Gati towards the doorway where the Comte is standing. But as Roux approaches, the Comte doesn't
text: move, blocking Roux’s exit,
text: The Comte is staring coldly at him, a silent challenge, their faces close together.
text: Then the Comte, with sudden nonchalance, turns and saunters off down the street - as if to imply that the point has
dialog: been made and he's not going to waste any more time on Roux.
text: Roux stands there a moment... then wordlessly leads Gati out of the cafe.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. CHOCOLATERIE - DAY

scene_heading: INT. BACK DOWNSTAIRS IN THE CHOCOLATERIE - SAME
text: Roux is looking around at the Mayan artifacts decorating the shop. His §aze comes to rest on the Decorative Tile of
text: "Elchuah". He seems particularly fascinated by it.
text: Vianne observes Roux appraisingly, as if deciding something about him. She gets a rum truffle and holds it out to
dialog: him:
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (confidently)
dialog: Go ahead. It's your favorite.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: What makes you so sure?
text: She gets a rum.truffie, hands it to him:
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Go on, taste it.
text: intrigued, Roux eats the rum truffle. He nods in astonished appreciation:
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: Amazing...
speaker_heading: VANNE
dialog: (pleased with herself}
dialog: Thanks. | have a knack for guessing.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: (apologetic)
dialog: ...but it's not my favorite.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (thrown off)
dialog: What?
text: Gati comes running down the stairs with Anouk.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: (to Gati)
dialog: Ready to go?
text: Roux takes Gati's hand and leads her towards the door. Vianne watches them 80, slightly annoyed with herself for
dialog: failing to guess Roux's favorite.
text: On his way out, Roux hesitates to inspect the shattered, boarded-up front door:
speaker_heading: ROUX (CONT'D)
dialog: | could fix this. Not with glass, but | could make you a good strong wooden
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: VANNE
dialog: That's nice of you. But I'd insist on paying for your work.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: That makes two of us.
text: Roux exits with Gati.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN GARDENS - DAY
text: PERE HENRI is SINGING as he works in the garden:
speaker_heading: PERE HENRI
dialog: "Blue, blue, blue suede shoes, Blue blue blue suede shoes -"
text: Out of the corner of his eye, he now sees THE COMTE approaching - and Pére Henri literally changes his tune in mid-
dialog: sentence:
speaker_heading: PERE HENRI (cont'd)
dialog: (SINGING reverently)
dialog: *. and let the earth be joyful, And the trees sing in exaltation..."
dialog: (turning to the Comte}
dialog: Oh - good evening, Monsieur le Comte. | didn't see you there.
dialog: The Comte regards Pére Henri grimly.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: She's laughing at us,
speaker_heading: PERE HENRI
dialog: Pardon?
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: The Rocher woman. Laughing at our traditions. Now she's got one of the
dialog: tiver gypsies working for her!
speaker_heading: PERE HENRI
speaker_heading: (a BEAT)
dialog: Is that a problem? After all, Christ teaches us to give succor even to -
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: Succor is well and good, Pére. But when it undermines the moral foundation
dialog: of the community?!
dialog: (pointing to garden)
dialog: Do you not pull out weeds when they threaten your flowers?
speaker_heading: PERE HENRI
dialog: Well, yes -
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: And just look at this...
text: The Comte unfolds a NEWSPAPER, shows it to Pére Henri:
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD (cont'd)
text: She is soliciting booths and street performers for a “Fertility Celebration" on
dialog: Easter Sunday! | tell you, she's cackling at us! When are you Soing to do
dialog: something?
text: Pére Henri uneasily stares at the newspaper.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD (cont'd)
dialog: The Monsignor assured me you were not one of these "New Catholics” one
dialog: reads about in Le Monde - was he mistaken?
text: Pére Henri swallows hard, regarding the Comte with a mixture of respect and foreboding...
scene_heading: INT. CHOCOLATERIE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: ROUX is rebuilding the door. ANOUK is hanging out with him. She has a BIG SLIMY EARTHWORM in her hand,
text: studying it with casual interest.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: What part of Australia?
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: (with factual authority)
text: A small town outside of Sidney.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: What does he eat?
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: Leaves, bugs, bamboo shoots...
dialog: (displaying worm in her hand)
dialog: ... and worms, of course.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: What about chocolate?
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: (“don't be silly")
dialog: Kangaroos don't eat chocolate.
text: Vianne and Joséphine, cleaning up the shop at day's end, listen with amusement to Roux's conversation with Anouk.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: Well, but... has he ever tried it?
text: Anouk whispers to "Pantoufle", then “listens” for his answer. Then:
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: He's not interested.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: (playfully)
dialog: Not interested? Monsieur Pantoufle, you surprise me. A world traveler, not
dialog: interested in new flavors?
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: I've got a nice truffle here he could try.
text: Roux and Joséphine exchange a wry glance. Anouk confers with Pantoufle, then:
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: No, But he thanks you for your kind offer.
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: (to Vianne)
dialog: Very proper for a kangaroo.
speaker_heading: VANNE
dialog: (nods)
dialog: His mother was British.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: Monsieur Pantoufle, | must protest. How do you know you don’t like
dialog: chocolate if you refuse to taste it?
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: (to Roux)
dialog: Do you like worms?
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: What - ?
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: How do you know if you've never tasted one?
text: Roux considers this. He impulsively takes the worm from Anouk's hand - POPS IT IN HIS MOUTH, CHEWS AND
text: SWALLOWS IT, maintaining a brave, gallant expression on his face, thinly veiling his inner queasiness.
text: Joséphine and Vianne are astonished. Anouk is staring at Roux with unabashed admiration. Finally:
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: (a gourmet judgment:)
text: Subtle. Zesty. Disgusting.
text: Anouk laughs delightedly. She looks back at Vianne with glee, as if to say: "isn't this guy fabulous?"
text: Then Anouk turns to Roux again... and catches sight of him furtively SETTING THE WORM DOWN just outside the
text: doorway. (He "palmed" the worm, like a magician).
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: (half-outraged; half-delighted)
dialog: You tricked me!
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: ‘(to worm)
dialog: Go, my little friend! Be free!
text: Anouk laughs.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - DAY
text: The church is packed for PALM SUNDAY. Parishioners hold the traditional Rameaux (ceremonial palm crosses). PERE
text: HENRI nervously delivers his sermon, reading from a prepared text:
speaker_heading: PERE HENRI
dialog: ..Satan wears many guises. At times, Satan is the singer of a lurid song you
dialog: hear on the radio. At times, the author of a salacious novel. At times the
dialog: quiet man lurking in the schoolyard, asking your children if he might join their
dialog: game.
text: THE COMTE DE REYNAUD watches Pére Henri intently, like a parent watching his child recite lines in a school play.
speaker_heading: PERE HENRI (cont'd)
dialog: And at times the maker of sweet things. Mere trifles. For what could seem
dialog: more harmless, more innocent than... chocolat?
text: The Comte, his eyes bright with pride and satisfaction, glances down at his own copy of the sermon, making sure Pére
text: Henri is reading it exactly right.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MAKESHIFT FORT IN LES MARAUDS - THE NEXT DAY
text: DIDI, DEDOU, and OTHER KIDS are playing La Chévre (like "Tag", only the person who's "it has to make a Soat
text: noise.) Didi is now the goat. ANOUK comes aver to join the Same, taunting Didi:
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: Bet you can't get me!
text: But Didi ignores her and pursues another child.
speaker_heading: ANOUK (cont'd)
dialog: {running in front of Didi)
dialog: Come on, Didi, | dare you.
text: But Didi actually goes out of his way not to tag Anouk - leaving her confused. Then Dédou sidles over to her:
speaker_heading: DEDOU
dialog: We can't play with you anymore.
dialog: Your mother is Satan's helper.
text: Before Anouk can answer, DEdou gets tagged: making a goat noise, he runs off in pursuit of other children... leaving
text: Anouk standing there, perplexed, alone.
scene_heading: INT. CHOCOLATERIE - AFTERNOON
text: Roux is at work on the new door, which is almost done. Vianne, in the doorway, sees GUILLAUME up the street,

speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Hey Guillaume!
text: Guillaume stops in his tracks, flustered.
speaker_heading: VIANNE (cont'd)
dialog: I've got something new Chariy's going to iove.
text: Guillaume nervously glances at the Church... gives Vienne an apologetic shrug, and heads away from her. (Charly
text: tries to keep going toward the chocolaterie - but Guillaume is forcefully pulling his leash.) Vianne is stunned.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: (softly)
dialog: it's me. i should go.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: No, it's not you. It's...
text: Just then, Vianne sees ANOUK striding towards the shop:
speaker_heading: VIANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: (chagrined)
dialog: Where have you been? 1 was worried -
text: Anouk flounces right past Vianne and Roux into the shop.
speaker_heading: VIANNE (cont'd)
dialog: I'm talking to you -
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: It's just like all the other towns!
text: Anouk runs upstairs. Vianne hurries after her.
text: Roux and Joséphine (who is behind the counter) share a troubled look.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - SAME
text: Anouk races into her CRAWL SPACE and disappears behind the Mayan cloth curtain. Vianne hurries into the bedroom
text: - and sees that Anouk has burrowed into the crawl space.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Anouk...
text: Vianne sits down on the floor next to the cloth curtain.
speaker_heading: VIANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Just tell me what happened.
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: Are you Satan’s helper?
text: Vianne sighs.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: it's not easy, Nou-Now. Being different.
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: Why can't we go to church?!
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: You can if you want, But it won't make things easier.
speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: Why can't you wear black shoes like the other mothers?!
text: Vianne is thrown off by this strange remark; she doesn't quite know what to say.
speaker_heading: OMITTED
scene_heading: INT. ARMANDE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Vianne sits by the fire sipping cognac. Armande stands at the fireplace, steadying herself with her cane while she
text: uses an iron poker in her other hand to rearrange burning logs.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: !t was just a matter of time before he got to the new priest. See, the Comte
dialog: thinks of the church as one of his holdings. Which makes Pére Henri one of
dialog: his tenants.
text: Armande pokes at a large log. But her muscles are weak; the log won't budge.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE (CONT'D}
dialog: He's a fine piece of work, our little nobleman. it's no wonder his wife goes
dialog: Sallivanting off. She's been in Italy for months, did you know that?
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (troubled, quiet)
dialog: Armande... the whole town's against me... What can | do?
text: Armande, frustrated by the large log, pokes it absolutely as hard as she can - and the whole pile collapses with an
text: explosion of embers. This makes Armande smile.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: (with a sly twinkle)
dialog: Throw me a party.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: Wednesday's my 70th. Let's show the bastards we're ready to go down
dialog: dancing.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: But... 2 party...
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: You're not well. You have to face it -
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: Okay okay okay. You do this for me, ! check into Le Mortoir the very next
dialog: morning, without a regret in the world!
text: Vianne is deeply struck to hear this... but shakes her head no.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: {f 1 threw @ party in this town, no one would come.
text: Armande sits down, picks up her cognac.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: They don’t need to know who's throwing it.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Armande, listen -
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: No, you listen. This is what ! need.
dialog: {a plea)
dialog: One fast night to be myself. One last night to live.
dialog: Vianne doesn't know what to say...

dialog: Wednesday, 25 March 5 p.m.
speaker_heading: NO GIFTS, PLEASE
text: Luc stares at the invitation with distress and uncertainty...
scene_heading: EXT. ROUX'S BARGE - DAY
text: ROUX, sitting with his bare feet dangling over the side, plays a Folk Song (the "Wind Theme") on his GUITAR. His feet
text: tap the water's surface in time with the music.
text: ANGLE TO REVEAL VIANNE quietly stepping onto the barge. She stands there watching Roux play his guitar. Then
text: She begins HUMMING along with the melody. Roux sees her, and keeps playing.
text: Roux ends the song with an IMPROVISED JAZZY RIFF. Vianne is impressed.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Never heard that last part before.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: Me neither.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: My mother used to sing that song. When / couldn't sleep.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: Did it heip?
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: I still didn't sleep. But yes. it helped.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: How is the door?
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (smiling)
text: It squeaks.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: How is Anouk?
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: She's better.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: And how are you?
text: She hands him a LINEN ENVELOPE like the one Luc got in the mail.
speaker_heading: VANNE
dialog: I'm throwing a party.
dialog: (betraying a touch of nerves)
dialog: if anyone shows up.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: Who's invited?
speaker_heading: VANNE
text: A bunch of townspeople.
dialog: Roux considers this.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: (genuinely curious)
dialog: Tell me. Why do you give a damn about pleasing these narrow-minded
dialog: villagers?
text: Vianne, caught off-guard, doesn't know quite how to reply.
speaker_heading: ROUX (CONT'D)
dialog: Because you're scared of them.
text: Vianne blinks at the truth in this, but immediately covers:
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (scoffing)
dialog: I'm more afraid of my daughter's kangaroo. You coming to the party or not?
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: I can't.
dialog: (off Vianne's look)
dialog: There's a boycott. Against immorality. I'm respecting it.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Ah. That is a problem. Well then, | will leave you with this test of your
dialog: convictions.
text: She tosses him a packet of chocolate covered almonds. He catches them.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: What are these?
speaker_heading: VIANNE
text: Highly immoral Aimond-chocolate clusters.
dialog: (confidently)
dialog: Your favorite.
text: Roux tastes one: it’s incredible. He bows his head as if slain.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: am undone.
speaker_heading: (a BEAT)
dialog: But it's not my favorite.
text: Vianne shakes her head in chagrin. She turns and starts to walk away.
speaker_heading: ROUX (CONT'D)
dialog: Fil come by sometime and get that squeak out of your door.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (not looking back)
dialog: | know.
scene_heading: INT. CHOCOLATERIE KITCHEN - A SERIES OF SHOTS
text: VIANNE and JOSEPHINE work feverishly to create an exotic feast of savory chocolate entrees like WILD HARE IN MOLE
text: POBLANO SAUCE and TURKEY IN COCOA/BURGUNDY SAUCE... we see them skinning the hares; scoring chestnuts;
text: frying chilies and bananas; melting dark couverture shavings into bubbling sauce...
text: A STRONG WIND blows through the open window, cooling their perspiring faces. Vianne wipes sweat from her neck,
text: and her fingers brush against the NECKLACE she got from Roux...
speaker_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROUX'S BARGE - NIGHT
text: Another NECKLACE, unfinished, in Roux's hands. (THE WIND is blowing.) Roux is sitting at his workbench, crafting
text: the necklace. He is relaxed, focused, doing the kind of manual work he enjoys -
text: - but the WIND GUSTS, and a hatch SLAMS - and Roux, startled, drops the necklace he's working on.
scene_heading: INT. CHOCOLATERIE KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: The WIND is stil! strong. Vianne and Joséphine, lavishly perspiring and giddy with fatigue after many hours of cooking,
text: each take a gulp from the bottle of Burgundy they used for the sauce. Vianne lights a FLAME under a pot, and we:
speaker_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - NIGHT
text: Another FLAME, this time from a CANDLE that REYNAUD is lighting, in front of the statue of a severe-looking saint. He
text: crosses himself, praying fervently for the restoration of morality.
text: The WIND gusts into the church, making the candle flicker. Reynaud worriedly shields the flame.
scene_heading: EXT. ARMANDE'S FRONT YARD - DAY
text: It's a warm afternoon. A dozen PARTY GUESTS sit at a long outdoor table, quietly talking: a subdued gathering. The
text: dinner party is @ combination of formal and funky: Fine linen tablecloth, antique china - and garish crepe paper
text: festooning the chicken-wire fence, Among the guests are GUILLAUME (with CHARLY), YVETTE, ALPHONSE, BAPTISTE,
text: the THREE WIDOWS IN BLACK. ARMANDE looks radiant in an old "flapper" dress, fur wrap, and cloche hat.
text: JOSEPHINE is filling wine glasses.
text: Now the door of Armande's house opens - and VIANNE and ROUX emerge, carrying platters heaped with Vianne's
text: chocolate-laced entrees. ANOUK, still looking pouty, trails behind.
text: The Party Guests, stunned to see these “outsiders” at the party, fall into uncomfortable silence.
text: Vianne and Roux set down the platters.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (with forced good cheer)
dialog: (a bit anxious)
dialog: Do you think everyone had a good time? Seems like it all went pretty well -
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Shhh...
text: She gives him a look: “alright then." She holds him a little closer and lets herself be swayed by the music. Vianne
text: and Roux are good dancers, swaying sensuously in each other's arms.
text: ANOUK (sitting in @ corner with BAPTISTE and GATI) yawns happily as she watches her mom dance with Roux.
text: ARMANDE and LUC are sitting on a large crate. Armande, deeply exhausted, steadies herself against Luc.
dialog: Luc
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: Mémé?
text: Armande's eyelids are drooping. She looks shaky.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: it's nothing. I'm... tired.
dialog: (cails out:)
dialog: Vianne. Roux.
text: Vianne and Roux stop dancing and come over to Armande.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE (cont'd)
dialog: Thanks. This was... thank you.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: You're leaving?
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (protesting to Armande)
text: The night is young.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: Well I'm not. Help me up.
text: Vianne helps her up; Armande is a bit unsteady on her feet.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (worried)
dialog: Armande...
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: Oh for gadsake don't fuss. You'll ruin a perfectly decadent evening.
dialog: (shakes Vianne's hand)
dialog: I'm not partial to big sloppy goodbyes.
text: But Vienne embraces the old woman, tightly, for a long time.
scene_heading: EXT. ARMANDE'S HOUSE - LATER
text: LUC carefully helps Armande up the front steps. The dirty dishes from the party are still out.
speaker_heading: LUC
dialog: (re: dishes)
dialog: | can take care of -
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: (tiredly, weakly)
dialog: I'm... I'll sleep in my... chair tonight...
scene_heading: INT, ARMANDE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Luc helps Armande, fully clothed, into her easy chair. She is fondly, distractedly fingering the handcrafted
text: necklace she's wearing. Luc gently removes her shoes and draws a quilt over her.
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: Give your mother a message for me.
dialog: (yawning)
dialog: She can pick me up at noon.
speaker_heading: LUC
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: Pick you up?
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: (exhaustedly)
dialog: Tell her I'm ready to go to Les Mimosas.
dialog: Lue
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: You heard me.
dialog: Lue
dialog: Mémé, are you sure -
speaker_heading: ARMANDE
dialog: Go away now - shoo. Can't you see I’m busy?
text: Armande closes her eyes, putting an end to the discussion.
dialog: Luc
dialog: l'iljust bring in a few dishes, okay?
text: Silence. Luc reluctantly goes outside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ROUX'S BARGE - LATER
text: The party is over. Anouk and Joséphine are curled up asleep on a bench; Vianne and Roux gently cover them with an
text: eiderdown. Then Vianne takes Roux's hand, and they wordlessly step into the "CABOOSE BOAT" that's tied to the
text: back of the barge.
text: They drift downriver in the Caboose Boat, away from the barge...
scene_heading: INT, CABOOSE BOAT - A BIT LATER
text: The boat glides down the river. We hear the SONG OF CRICKETS from the riverbanks.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Do you like it? Taking your home with you wherever you go?
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: It suits me.
speaker_heading: (a BEAT)
dialog: Your way must be harder.
text: Vianne looks at him questioningly.
speaker_heading: ROUX (CONT'D)
dialog: Wherever you go, making a new home from scratch.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Maybe this time I'll get it right.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Maybe I'll stay.
dialog: Roux smiles knowingly: who are you kidding?
speaker_heading: VIANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: What.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: You'll always be @ wanderer.
text: Vianne shoots him an irritated look.
speaker_heading: ROUX (CONT'D)
dialog: It's @ compliment.
text: Vianne sighs, shakes her head. To her it's no compliment. After a moment:
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Don't you ever think about... belonging somewhere?
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: The price is too high. You end up caring what people expect of you.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Is that so terrible? Having people expect something of you?
text: Roux studies her for a tong moment.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: (gently)
dialog: You worry about Anouk, is that it?
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: {caught off-guard)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: You know, all the moving around -
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Oh please, don't be silly. She's fine, she handles it beautifully, she makes
dialog: friends so easily, she’s such an unusual...
text: Vianne stops short - hearing her own bullshit.
speaker_heading: VIANNE (cont'd)
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: She hates it.
text: It's a sad, vulnerable moment for Vianne. Roux is studying her with sympathetic understanding...
text: Gently, tentatively, he leans towards her and lightly kisses her lips.
text: And then their kiss begins to grow passionate... and Vianne and Roux sink down to the floor of the boat, starting to
dialog: undo each other's clothes...
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERBANK NEAR ROUX'S BARGE - NIGHT
text: The barge is stil! strung with lanterns. All is quiet. Then we see A MAN furtively approaching the barge... lugging two
scene_heading: LARGE METAL CONTAINERS...
text: REVEAL the man is SERGE MUSCAT, smiling a strange vehement smile.
scene_heading: INT. ARMANDE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Luc does the dishes, HUMMING a song that the gypsy musicians played...
scene_heading: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Luc enters the darkened room. Armande’s Cat sits next to the chair where Armande sits motionless. Luc sees that
text: Armande's quilt has fallen off her; he approaches the chair and picks up the quilt...
text: ...and in the semi-darkness he SEES that Armande has a SERENE SMILE, and that HER EYES ARE OPEN, BUT
text: LIFELESS...
dialog: Luc
dialog: Mérmé...
text: Lue, stunned, touches her ashen cheek. Armande’s eyes remain fixed, motionless.
text: Luc sees that Armande’s lifeless hands are clutching something: Luc's PORTRAIT of her.
text: Luc smiles slightly, his eyes filling with tears...
scene_heading: INT. CABOOSE BOAT - NIGHT
text: Roux and Vianne finish putting their clothes back on, in tranquil silence. Vianne playfully SNAPS one of the
text: suspenders that Roux wears over his T-shirt - he lets out a surprised SHRIEK. They both laugh...
text: ... until Roux notices something low in the sky, around a bend in the river: an ominous FLICKERING RED-ORANGE
dialog: GLOW against the darkness...
text: Roux's smile fades.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: What?
text: Vianne turns and sees the FLICKERING GLOW in the sky... and as her joy gives way to concern, we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERBANK - MINUTES LATER
text: Having guided the caboose boat onto the riverbank, Roux and Vienne now jump out onto land and run toward the
text: FLICKERING GLOW.
scene_heading: EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE RIVERBANK - SAME
text: Vianne and Roux come racing around the bend - and now see the source of the flickering glow:
scene_heading: EXT. THE RIVER TANNES - SAME
dialog: 
text: - where several of the HOUSEBOATS are ON FIRE - the flames bright against the night sky. Some RIVER GYPSIES are
text: still on their boats, desperately struggling to put out the flames; others are huddled on the riverbank, their faces
text: covered with soot, CRYING OUT in anguish.
dialog: 
text: ROUX'S BARGE has been cut adrift and is floating further down the river, ENGULFED IN BRILLIANT FLAMES.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Anouk...
text: Vianne and Roux run down to the river -
text: - where Vianne frantically searches among the river gypsies on the riverbank - and sees that Anouk is not among
dialog: them.
text: Vianne looks across the water at Roux's barge engulfed in flames.
speaker_heading: VIANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: (with horror and guilt)
dialog: Oh no! Oh God!
text: Vianne frantically leaps into the water and swims towards Roux's burning barge.
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: Vianne!
text: Roux hurries into the water and swims after her.
text: Vianne and Roux swim desperately towards the barge...
text: ... and as they swim, the water all around them shimmers with the hellish radiance of reflected firelight...

text: the flaming wreckage.
speaker_heading: ROUX (cont'd)
dialog: Vianne, no!
text: He grabs her again - and Vianne, frenzied with anguish, flails at him. He locks his arm around her neck and forcefully
text: pulls flailing Vianne back through the water toward the riverbank.
text: Finally he pulls her ashore. Vianne, crazed with grief and anger, pummels Roux with her fists:
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Why did you stop me?!
speaker_heading: ROUX
dialog: It was too late -
text: She pummels him repeatedly - and now he just stands there and takes it, no longer trying to restrain her.

speaker_heading: ANOUK
dialog: Maman, you're hurting me -
text: But Vianne hugs her even tighter.

scene_heading: INT. CHOCOLATERIE - NIGHT
text: Vianne sits alone at the counter, her face grim and shadowed. She runs her hand along the countertop, very slowly,
text: as if she were trying to make sure that it physically exists, that it's not an illusion.
text: She looks up, sensing someone's presence... and SEES ROUX OUTSIDE, approaching the shop.
text: Roux is about to knock on the door - but then notices that Vianne is already looking at him.

text: With grim resignation, Vianne turns and FACES DIRECTLY INTO THE HARSH, GUSTING WIND - as if receiving a bleak,

text: Anouk - seeing the ashen, defeated look on her mother's face - stops playing. She anxiously approaches Vianne.

text: The wind tosses Vianne's hair and stings her eyes.

text: Joséphine throws her apron down, suddenly fierce:
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE
dialog: Good! Run away. But don't think I'm going to take care of your chocolates!
text: Vianne is startled by Joséphine’s intensity. Then Vianne gently touches her shoulder, understanding her anxiety.
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: You've been a good friend.
text: But Vianne's gentleness only deepens Joséphine's agitation:
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE

speaker_heading: VIANNE

speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: Belong?

text: Caroline appears in the doorway, buttoning up her coat:

speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: No. Not easy, House feels so empty. Can't seem to get used to it, no matter
dialog: how much time...
text: Reynaud stops himself, suddenly self-conscious. He sees the way she's looking at him: with an odd mixture of

dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD (cont'd)
dialog: What do you want me to do?
text: He is silent for a long moment, waiting for his answer.
text: And then... it seems to come to him. The Comte looks down at his own hand, which is still grasping the LETTER
speaker_heading: OPENER,
text: He gets up and heads out of the church,
scene_heading: EXT. THE TOWN SQUARE - OUTSIDE THE CHURCH - NIGHT
text: The church doors are flung open, and the Comte strides out...
scene_heading: INT. CHOCOLATERIE KITCHEN - SAME
text: Dark and quiet. Suddenly the back window is shoved open - and THE COMTE crawls in, FLASHLIGHT in one hand and
text: the LETTER OPENER in the other. His eyes ablaze with holy purpose, he stealthily walks through the kitchen...
scene_heading: INT. CHOCOLATERIE - SAME
text: The Comte quietly hurries to the display window - where his flashlight ituminates the CHOCOLATE STATUARY OF
text: ANIMALS gazing at him with innocent opaque chocolate eyes and "EL CHUAH" smiling an exaggerated thick-lipped
text: smile. The Comte shudders.
text: Then his flashlight finds: a CHOCOLATE STATUE OF A WOMAN towering above the reliquary - her features vaguely
text: Mesoamerican, her graceful milky-brown arms holding a sheaf of chocolate wheat, her rippling hair a darker, more
dialog: lustrous grade of chocolate.
text: The Comte swallows hard. Wielding his letter opener like a dagger, he hacks off the Chocolate Woman's hand.
text: Smiling with strange, fervid rectitude, the Comte hacks off the Chocolate Woman's head and arms. He cackles like a
text: naughty child, with a mixture of fear and triumph.
text: He hacks the statue repeatedly, savagely, reducing it to a rubble of brown shards.
text: He turns to a chocolate lamb and begins hacking it to pieces -
text: - but as he does, a PIECE OF DARK CHOCOLATE flies up and STICKS TO THE COMTE'S LIP. He unthinkingly licks the
text: piece of chocolate - and it makes him GROAN with amazement and yearning:
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: Mon Dieu...
text: He swallows the piece of chocolate - it makes him woozy with aroused hunger.
text: Without thinking, he puts another small piece of chocolate in his mouth...
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD (cont'd)
dialog: (to himself, trying to resist)
dialog: No no...
text: He eats another small piece... His eyes are moist with longing... On the floor, scattered among the chocolate
text: animals, lies a treasure trove of loose candies.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD (cont'd)
dialog: Mon Dieu, just one more...
text: He snatches a White Rum Truffle and stuffs it in his mouth...
text: He tries a Cerisette Russe, and then a kirsch roll... he closes his eyes, groaning with pure unthinking animal pleasure,
text: overwhelmed by his terrible hunger, intoxicated by Vianne’s seductive confections...
text: And then he's down on his knees, scavenging, shoving one luscious candy after another into his chomping mouth: a
text: three-nut bittersweet cluster, a Manon blanc, an apricot marzipan, a grappa creme, a croquant peak...
text: ..and soon he's rolling among the chocolates on the floor, losing himself in them, stuffing them into his mouth - his
text: red-flushed face intermittently illuminated by the harsh beam of his fallen flashlight...
text: As he chomps ravenausly on the candies, the Comte is weeping, he's moaning, he's whimpering, he's jaughing... he's
text: as free and oblivious as a suckling infant...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAWN
text: Pére Henri arrives at the church.
scene_heading: INT, CHOCOLATERIE - DAY
text: THE COMTE lies CONTENTEDLY ASLEEP in the display window, surrounded by the chocolate shards of the two statues
text: he smashed. (The other chocolate statues are intact.)
scene_heading: CLOSE ANGLE - THE SLEEPING COMTE
text: begins to sniff something. FIZZ is tickling his nose. His eyes flutter open, and:
scene_heading: ANGLE TO REVEAL VIANNE
text: kneeling beside him, holding a glass of carbonated water under his nose. Behind Vianne stand JOSEPHINE and
text: ANOUK - and PERE HENRI, who jooks on in troubled astonishment.
text: The Comte’s eyes widen with mortification as he realizes where he is...
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Drink this.
text: The Comte regards her with wordless fear and alarm.
speaker_heading: VIANNE (cont'd)
dialog: It'll refresh you. There's no chocolate in it, ! promise.
dialog: The Comte is utterly confused: why is Vianne helping him?
speaker_heading: VIANNE (cont'd)
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Go ahead, drink,
text: The Comte takes a sip. It seems to help him a little.
text: Pére Henri is intently watching Vianne help the Comte.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: (re: the mess he’s made)
dialog: 1. I'm sorry, h...
speaker_heading: VIANNE
dialog: T won't tell anyone.

speaker_heading: VIANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: (gently, to the Comte)
dialog: Better get cleaned up.
dialog: (indicating the church)
dialog: Easter Sunday.

text: The Comte gulps when he sees Pére Henri standing there.
speaker_heading: COMTE DE REYNAUD
dialog: (eyes glazed; to Pére Henri)
dialog: The sermon... | didn't get a chance to... It's not finished.

speaker_heading: PERE HENRI
dialog: I'll think of something.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - LATER
text: The congregation is silent, watchful, as young Pére Henri steps forward to begin his Easter sermon.
text: Pére Henri looks scared... but also determined.
speaker_heading: PERE HENRI
dialog: (voice quavering)
dialog: 1... wasn't sure... what the theme of my homily today ought to be.
dialog: (clears his throat)
dialog: Do | want to speak of, uh... the miracle of our Lord's divine transformation?
dialog: (a BEAT; very nervous.)
dialog: Not really. No.
text: Various members of the Congregation look puzzled, concerned.
speaker_heading: PERE HENRI (cont'd)
dialog: | don't really... feel like talking about His divinity.
text: Some members of the Congregation give each other worried looks. Some shift uneasily in their pews.
speaker_heading: PERE HENRI (cont'd)
dialog: I'd rather talk about His humanity.
text: MESDAMES RIVET AND POUGET, their curiosity piqued, are listening intently to Pére Henri.
speaker_heading: PERE HENRI (cont'd)

speaker_heading: (a BEAT)
dialog: Listen. Here's what | think.
text: YVETTE and ALPHONSE are holding hands in their pew, watching Pére Henri.
speaker_heading: PERE HENRI (cont'd)
dialog: | think we can’t go around measuring our goadness by what we don't do. By
dialog: what we deny ourseives. What we resist. And who we exclude.
text: MADAME AUDEL (who's no longer wearing all black) is sitting next to GUILLAUME... who smiles slightly as he listens to
dialog: Pére Henri.
speaker_heading: PERE HENRI (cont'd)
dialog: I think we've got to measure goodness by what we embrace. What we
dialog: create,
speaker_heading: (a BEAT)
dialog: And who we include.
text: All the way in the back of the church sits the COMTE DE REYNAUD - disheveled, silent, looking up towards the pulpit
text: with a sort of stunned humility in his eyes...
speaker_heading: STORYTELLER (V.0.)
dialog: All who attended Mass that Easter Sunday still remember the Curé’s homily.
dialog: it was certainly not the most fiery sermon he would ever preach, nor the most
dialog: elegant.

dialog: Even the Comte de Reynaud felt strangely... released.
text: THE COMTE, carrying a fresh warm baguette, hesitantly approaches Caroline. He tears off a piece of bread and
text: rather awkwardly offers it to her. She accepts it, and takes a bite.
text: Then the Comte eats a piece of bread himself: not guiltily, not ravenously - just eating like a normal person.
speaker_heading: STORYTELLER (V.0.) (cont'd)
dialog: . although it would be another six months before he'd work up the nerve to

speaker_heading: STORYTELLER (cont'd)
dialog: Friends-in-need yet to be discovered...
