dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: Would you describe your occupation

speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: I'm an ingeneur. I design illusions
dialog: and construct the apparatus necessary
dialog: for perfoming them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: And for how long had you been
dialog: Mr.Angier's "ingeneur"?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Eight years. I was privvy to the
dialog: secrets of his entire act.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: So, Mr.Cutter, was this water-filled
text: tank beneath the stage part of
dialog: Mr.Angier's illusion- the illusion
text: billed as "THE REAL TRANSPORTED MAN"?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: No, sir. The tank had been used for

dialog: Borden must have put it under the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
speaker_heading: (ANGRY)
dialog: If I reveal my magician's secrets
dialog: here in open court, I'll be
dialog: unemployable and the secrets will be
dialog: worthless. The Real Transported Man
dialog: is the most sought-after illusion in

dialog: 
text: The Judge considers this. He looks at Cutter. Sympathetic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Mr.Cutter, I see your predicament

speaker_heading: JUDGE (CONT'D)

text: The LITTLE GIRL from the opening stands in the gallery,
text: looking back at him. Borden gives her a little WAVE. She
text: waves back, then is GUIDED OUT by a man wearing GLOVES and

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Not my idea, sir. The Warden saw

dialog: 
text: Owens smiles as he hands over his pocket watch ans wallet.
text: They walk along a hall wrought iron fence. The PRISON looms

text: A door in the prison opens and Borden emerges, trussed

text: to a WOODEN SECTION of the fence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: I told him the only way Borden's

speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: My name is Owens- I'm a solicitor.

text: Borden says nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: OWENS

speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Talk to Fallon, my ingenuer- the

speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: I did. He offered to sell all of
dialog: your tricks... except the most
dialog: valuable one - The Transported Man.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: I'd never forgive myself for selling
dialog: my greatest trick.
text: Borden signals the Wardens to come and unlock him.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Even for your daughter?

speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Bernard Fallon? A man with a past

dialog: No, the girl is to be an orphan.
dialog: I've been to the work house...
text: Owens looks around the prison yard. Shrugs.
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)
dialog: It's better than this.
text: Borden looks at Owens, hard. The Warders unlock Borden.
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Angier never learned my trick.
speaker_heading: OWENS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER (O.S.)
dialog: Bullet catch is suicide.
dialog:

speaker_heading: (INDICATES HIMSELF
speaker_heading: AND ANGIER)
speaker_heading: USE PLANTS-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: He can't use plants for every trick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: There'd be no seats left for the
dialog: punters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Fine- no bullet catch. But a real
dialog: magician tries to invent something
dialog: new, something other magicians scratch
dialog: their heads over-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: They sells it to them for a small
dialog: fortune.
dialog: 
text: Cutter hands Angier some money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I suposse you have such a trick,
dialog: Mr.Borden?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Actually, I do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Care to sell it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: No one else could do my trick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: I could.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: You don't even know what it is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Show it to me twice, I'll do it.
dialog: 
text: Cutter looks at Borden, thoughtful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: I admire your spirit, Mr.Angier.
dialog: But if Borden here really has invented
dialog: his masterpiece it might well be
text: something only he can do.
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: It might be something only he is
dialog: prepared to do.
dialog: (gestures to the props)
dialog: my illusions employer, Mr.Milton,
text: is a skilled showman. But Borden's
dialog: right- he won't get his hands dirty.
dialog: You want to see what it takes to
dialog: make real magic- go to the Tenley.
dialog: There's a Chinaman there who's got
dialog: what it takes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Chung Ling Soo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Tickets are pricey.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: I know a lad on the door. You two
dialog: watch his show- whoever tells me how
dialog: he does his goldfish bowl trick gets
dialog: the prize.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Which is?
dialog: 
text: Cutter gives a sly smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Ten minutes onstage in front of my

dialog: 
text: Angier and Borden prick up at the name.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Who's Ackerman?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: The most powerful theatrical agent
dialog: in London.
dialog: 
text: Cutter holds out money to Borden, who reaches for it- Cutter
text: grabs his wrist. Serious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: I saw you drop the knot again, Borden.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I think I had my wrist turned-
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
speaker_heading: (IGNORING JULIA)
dialog: Some nights you just can't get it,
dialog: can you? If that knot slips when
dialog: Julia's on the hoist she'll break a
dialog: leg.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
speaker_heading: (DEFENSIVE)
dialog: It's the wrong knot. A Langford
dialog: double would hold tighter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: The Langford double's not a wet knot
dialog: it's too dangerous. The ropes could
dialog: swell and she'd never slip it-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I can slip a Lanford underwater.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: We've been practiced it-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
speaker_heading: (CUTTING IN)

speaker_heading: CUTTER
speaker_heading: (TO BORDEN)

speaker_heading: ANGIER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Where are you from?
dialog: 
dialog: Angier nods. Fair enough.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER (CONT'D)
text: He shuffles props for Virgil at the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: He works for another magician? Aren't

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
speaker_heading: (SHAKES HEAD)
dialog: He doesn't deal in methods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: How do you know?
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
speaker_heading: (SLY SMILE)
dialog: Because I hired him to try and find
text: out Virgil's orange trick.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: I don't know if I trust him.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: He's a natural magician. Of course
dialog: you can't trust him.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I think he's alright.
text: Angier turns to Julia. Smiles.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: You think everyone's alright.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Even you.
text: Julia kisses Angier. Cutter rises.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: And Mr.Angier...?

scene_heading: INT. THEATRE, CONVENT GARDEN -- EVENING
text: Borden watches from the wings. Onstage, a magician, Virgil,
text: locks a CANARY into a cage then covers the cage with a SHAWL.
text: Borden notices a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN in the front row with
text: a little BOY who is watching Virgil's act, spellbound.
text: Virgil SLAMS the SHAWL down onto the table, as if nothing
text: were beneath it, then WHIPS it away- BIRD and CAGE are gone.
text: The little BOY begins to WAIL and CRY.
text: Borden watches as the young woman tries to make him stop.
text: Virgil takes the flower from his lapel, covers it with the
text: shawl, and SNAPS it away- the flower has become the CANARY.
text: The audience bursts into enthusiastic APPLAUSE, but the little
text: boy is still CRYING INCONSOLABLY. Virgil takes bows and
text: walks off, handing Borden the canary as he passes backstage.
text: As the audience leaves, Borden climbs off the stage and hols
text: the bird in front of the boy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Look- he's all right. He's fine.
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
speaker_heading: (SNIFFS)
dialog: But where's his brother?
text: Borden is at a loss. He turns to the young woman.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Sharp lad, your son.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: My brother.
text: Borden smiles back.
scene_heading: INT. WORKSHOP -- LATER
text: Borden gently strokes the bird's feathered head.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: You're the lucky one tonight.
text: Borden walks to a wall of DOZENS of bird cages -- each one
text: with an identical canary. He puts the bird into its cage
text: and returns to the cart props. He taps on the top of the
text: TABLE- a panel POPS open, revealing the FLATTENDED BIRD CAGE.
text: Borden insefts a ROD into the bird cage and PRIES it apart.
text: A TRICKLE of BLOOD emerges, dripping into a bucket below.
text: Borden SLAPS the cage.
text: And the FLATTENED CARCASS of the ORIGINAL BIRD slides out
text: and SPLASHES into the bucket.
scene_heading: EXT. STAGE DOOR -- EVENING
text: Borden exits. The young woman, SARAH, is there with her
dialog: brother.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: (to the brother)
dialog: Are you watching closely?
text: Borden reaches to the Boy's ear. Casually produces a coin.
text: The Boy marvels as he takes the coin then looks at Borden.
speaker_heading: BORDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Look closer.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: It's got two heads.
text: Sarah smiles. Borden crouches to address the Boy, grave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Never. Show. Anyone.
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
text: The Boy looks at him, a little afraid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: They'll beg you and flatter you for
dialog: the secret- but as soon as you give
dialog: it up you'll be nothing to them.
dialog: Understand? Nothing. The secret
dialog: impresses no one- the trick you use
dialog: it for is everything.
dialog: 
text: Borden looks into the boy's staring eyes. Then SMILES and
text: pets him on the head. he stands. Sarah smiles at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Where do you two live?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: He lives with Mum.

speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: And you?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL -- EVENING
dialog: 
text: Sarah lingers at the top of the stairs to her flat. Borden
text: tries to KISS her, but she pushes him back. He tests the
text: LOCK of the open door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Enough to keep me out?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I think so. Wil I see you again?
dialog: 
text: Borden SHRUGS and turns to go back down the stairs. Sarah
text: looks after him, about to change her min. Hesitates.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SARAH'S FLAT -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: She closes the door and LOCKS it, smiling. After a moment
text: she pads through living/kitchen area, draws back the curtain
text: to her bedroom and SHRIEKS:
dialog: 
text: Borden is there, smiling. Sarah moves towards him, giggling.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TENLEY THEATRE -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Onstage, CHUNG LING SOO, 60's, wearing a long silk robe,
text: HOBBLES painfully to the center of the stage. Clearly
text: CRIPPLED. In the audience, Borden and Angier watch intently.
dialog: 
text: Soo lays a silk SHAWL and a BARE TABLE. He WHIPS it up,
text: revealing a BOUQUET OF ROSES. So repeats the trick again
text: and again, producing a different object each time.
dialog: 
text: Finally, with a drum roll, Soo whips the shawl aside to reveal
text: a MASSIVE GOLDFISH BOWL, complete with GOLDFISH.
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
text: To THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE, Soo bows and HOBBLES off the stage.
text: Angier, clapping, shakes his head, utterly baffled. He turns
text: to Borden. Who has a small, knowing, smile.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Borden and Angier watch Soo being helped down from his
text: carriege by HANDLERS who treat him with great gentleness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: You're wrong. It can't be.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
text: It is. He carries the bowl between
text: his knees for the entire performance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: but look at the man!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
speaker_heading: (POINTS)
dialog: This is the trick. This is why no
text: one detectes his method.
dialog: 
text: Soo hobbles into the restaurant, frail, and fragile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Total devotion to his art...
dialog: (looks at Angier)
dialog: Utter self-sacrifice. It's the only
dialog: way to escape this.
dialog: 
text: Borden SLAPS the bricks of the wall behind them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDSIT -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Julia, in bed, watches Angier, SHEET wrapped around him like
text: a robe, HOBBLING. He pulls up the sheeyt- between his knees
text: is a goldfish bowl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: I can barely lift this thing and
text: it's not even filled with water. Or
text: fish. He must be strong as an ox.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIA
speaker_heading: (INCREDULOUS)
dialog: He's been preteding to be an cripple
dialog: for years?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Any time he's in public. Any time
text: he goes out. It's unthinkable.
dialog: 
text: Angier puts the bowl down with a flourish. Climbs into bed.
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Borden saw it at once. I couldn't
dialog: fathom it- living your whole life
text: pretending to be someone else.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: You're pretending to be someone else.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: I don't think changing your name
dialog: compares.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Not just your name- who you are,

text: Angier cuddles up to Julia.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I came up with a name for you...
dialog: "The Great Danton"
speaker_heading: (ANGIER FROWNS)

speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: We have our routine for Ackerman!
dialog: 
text: The other man turns- it is Fallon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
speaker_heading: (COLD)
dialog: We haven't had the pleasure.
dialog: 
text: Fallon nods. Borden comes over, holding a DUELING PISTOL.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Where did yo get all of-

speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Begged, borrowed and don't ask.
text: Mr.Fallon's an enterprising soul.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I need talk to you.
dialog: 
text: Fallon slips past Sarah with a nod to Borden. Exits. Sarah
text: looks at Borden. TENSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH (CONT'D)
dialog: We can't afford to pay him-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: We'll start making money once we
dialog: have our audience-
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: And until then? What I earn is barely
dialog: enough for us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: I'll give him half of my food.
dialog: 
text: Sarah looks meaningfully at Borden.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You're already going to be sharing

dialog: 
text: Borden looks at her, confused. Then realizes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: You're...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: Having a baby.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH (CONT'D)
dialog: What's this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
text: The trick to wake up Ackerman at the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Your great trick? The "masterpiece
dialog: that will make our fortunes"?
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: No. The world isn't ready for that
dialog: one, yet.
text: Borden moves to the bureau and starts LOADING the gun.
text: Pouring in SHOT, then WADDING...
speaker_heading: BORDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: This is merely a run-of-the-mill
dialog: daring and spectacular bullet catch-
text: Borden drops the BULLET into the barrel...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'm not letting you get shot.
text: Borden RAMS the bullet and charge down then removes the RAMROD
text: and hands the pistol to Sarah.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: It's perfectly safe. Shoot me.
text: Sarah looks at Borden then down at the pistol. She aims at
text: Borden. Then sims off, at a mirror beside him.
text: BANG. Borden's hand SNAPS out to "catch" the bullet. The
text: mirror is intact.
text: Borden looks at Sarah, grave, as he reveals the bullet in
text: his hand.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Show me.
dialog: (Borden shakes head)
dialog: Then you're not doing it. I can't
dialog: raise a child on my own, Alfred.
text: Borden looks at her. Takes the bullet from her and places
text: it on the bureau.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
text: The bullet goes in the gun. Then
dialog: comes the ramrod.
text: He takes the RAMROD and PUSHES it down onto the bullet, which
dialog: disappears.
speaker_heading: BORDEN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: AND VOILS-
text: He points the ramrod at Sarah- she pulls the bullet out of
text: the HOLLOW TIP.
speaker_heading: BORDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: The buller's not even in the gun
text: when the charge is fired.
dialog: 
text: Sarah looks at ramrod with disdain.
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Once you know it's so obvious.
dialog: 
text: Borden BRISTLES slightly. Takes the bullet back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Yes, well, people still get killed
dialog: perfoming it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: How?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
text: Sme smart-arse drops something down
dialog: the barrel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Such as?

speaker_heading: BORDEN

speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
speaker_heading: (SMILES)
dialog: Some days, it's not true. Todayt
dialog: you don't mean it. Maybe today you're

speaker_heading: (OFF LOOK)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: What's in there?

speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: You built this, Mr.Cutter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
speaker_heading: (SHAKES HEAD)

speaker_heading: (OFF LOOK)

speaker_heading: CUTTER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Why ever not?
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: It's dangerous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I'm sure beneath its bells and

speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: The most disappointing of all- it

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: This is the tank Angier drowned in?
dialog: 
text: Cutter turns to look at the empty, smashed glass of the tank.
text: Nods. Cutter indicates the top of the tank, where there is
text: a PADLOCK. Cutter pushes down on a panel of the lid-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
text: This lets the performer's hands reach
dialog: the trick padlock...
dialog: 
text: -a small section POPS open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: A standard magical apparatus for

speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Which of you brave souls is willing
dialog: bind this lovely young woman?
dialog: 
text: Milton gestures to Julia- the crowd goes wild. Julia makes
text: a show of deciding. She picks up Angier and Borden, who are
text: made up to look different from the last performance. As
text: they leap up onto stage, Borden makes eye contact with Cutter
text: in the wings- Cutter's is a WARNING GLANCE.
dialog: 
text: As Angier ties Julia's ankles he can't resist tickling just
text: under her toes- she KICKS him in the chin.
dialog: 
text: Borden starts to wrap the rope around Julia's wrists in a
text: particular fashion. Stops. Reconsiders. Julia NODS at
text: him, encouring. Borden starts RETRYING the knot.
dialog: 
text: Cutter watches. His hand checking for the axe handle.
dialog: 29.
dialog: 
text: Borden tests the rope- it is tight. Julia gives him the

dialog: 
text: Milton gives the sign and Julia is HOISTED into the air.

scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM -- DAY

dialog: 
text: Borden is prompted to stand by two GUARDS as the Judge enters.
text: The JUDGE has a piece of black cloth draped over his wig.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Alfred Borden, you have been found

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Mind if I join you?

speaker_heading: ALLEY

speaker_heading: (TO WAITER)
dialog: Two of 'em.
speaker_heading: (TO ANGIER)
dialog: Beautiful, isn't it? I do miss New

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Why are you here?

speaker_heading: ALLEY

dialog: 
text: Alley glances down at the notebook and Agier's scribbles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: A cypher?
dialog: 
text: Angier nods as Alley lifts the cardboard notebook.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: My profession also deals in secrets.
dialog: 
text: Alley looks at the gibberish on the pages of the notebook.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER (CONT'D)
text: It's a rotating transposition that

dialog: but time-consuming to translate once
dialog: you have the five-letter keyword.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY
dialog: Which is?
dialog: 
text: Angier smiles as he reaches for the notebook.

speaker_heading: ANGIER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY
dialog: You have a circle of trust with

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Maybe I bought it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY
dialog: Magicians sell their secrets?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: It's how we pay for our retirements
dialog: and how greats tricks outlive us.
dialog: 
text: Alley considers this. Taps the cover of the notebook.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY
dialog: You're hoping to find a great secretin
dialog: there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: I've already found it. That's why
dialog: I'm here.
dialog: 
text: Angier reaches in his pocket and removes his own, leather-
text: bound journal. He tears a PAGE from it and hands it to Alley.
text: Who unfolds it ans stares at it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Tesla built one for another magician.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY
dialog: Why would you want the same thing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Call it a professional rivalry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY
dialog: Tesla has built unusual machines for
dialog: unusual people, but he would never

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: I understand discretion. I just
dialog: want the machine.
dialog: 
text: Alley looks at Angier. Thinking.

text: The storm has abated. Angier's cane into the muddy ground
text: as he follows Alley through the moonlit field.
dialog: 
text: There are large glass GLOBES pushing out of the soil as if

text: field, looking down at the electric LIGHTS of the town.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY
dialog: We do our tests when the townspeople

dialog: 
text: Alley checks his wacth by the moonlight.
speaker_heading: ALLEY (CONT'D)
text: Not long now.
dialog: 
text: As they watch, the lights of Colorado Springs DISAPPEAR.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Our equipment requires a great deal
dialog: of current. Tesla eletrified the
dialog: whole town in exchange for using the
dialog: generators when we need to.
dialog: 
text: The field around them EXPLODES with DAZZLING LIGHT. Angier
text: laughs out in surprise- the field is full of a thousand large
text: LIGHTBULBS, all glowing together. Alley bends down and picks
text: up the nearest lightbulb -- as he does, the light in it
text: extinguises. He tosses the bulb to Angier. Except for the
text: size, it's a normal lightbulb.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Where are the wires?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY
dialog: Exactly.
dialog: 
text: Angier bends and gently PUSHES the lightbulb into a random
text: spot in the wet soil. The lightbulb FLICKERS on again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Where's the generator?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY
dialog: You saw it last week.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: But that must be ten miles from here.

speaker_heading: ALLEY

dialog: them before I get to bed.
dialog: (turns to leave)
dialog: I'll send word for you in a few days,

speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: A volunteer.
dialog: 
text: The crowd SURGES forward with EAGER VOLUNTEERS. Fallon scans

speaker_heading: BORDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you man enought, sir?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOUSTACHE
speaker_heading: (QUIET)

dialog: 
text: Borden looks at the trembling gun. Then at Angier. Spreads
text: his hands, inviting.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
speaker_heading: (SMILES)

speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: You got me a booking? Why?

speaker_heading: CUTTER

speaker_heading: CUTTER

speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Mr.Merrit-

speaker_heading: MERRIT
dialog: It's done, John. I've hired a

text: Cutter nods. Merrit leaves. Cutter turns to Angier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: There are plenty of good theatres...
dialog: if we can come up with another trick

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: The name stays.
dialog: 
text: Cutter sees Angier's resolve.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Right. Well, the new trick will

text: Angier nods.

speaker_heading: CUTTER (CONT'D)
dialog: If you need inspiration, there's a

text: captures the popular imagination.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ROYAL ALBERT HALL -- AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: The large concert hall is surrounded by crowds and covered

scene_heading: INT. ALBERT HALL -- AFTERNOON

dialog: 
text: On the stage, a tall rod capped with a steel ball is
text: transmitting a steady, sparking stream of electricity onto a
text: matched ball across the stage.
dialog: 
text: A FIGURE walks around from behind the machine and the audience
text: GASPS as a shower of sparks bounce off of his immaculate

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TESLA
dialog: With a system like this I could have

speaker_heading: AUDIENCE MEMBER
speaker_heading: (YELLS)
dialog: Fraud.
dialog: 
text: Angier turns to look. The man who called out is leaving

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET -- DAY

text: Angier glances at Borden's notebook sitting on the desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Reading his account I realize that

dialog: 
text: Angier flips open the notebook. Staring at the coded writing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER (CONT'D)
text: The family life he craves one minute

speaker_heading: ANGIER (V.O.)

speaker_heading: BORDEN

scene_heading: INT. PRISON LIBRARY, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Te library is long and titled, with two long tables. It

dialog: 
text: Borden sits at a table. Writing on a stack of notepaper.
text: His arms have been unbound, but long chains runs from his

text: to read Borden's writing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SULLEN
dialog: Let me see?
dialog: 
text: Sullen SNATCHES up the papers. Borden makes no move to stop

speaker_heading: SULLEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm going to know all of the
dialog: Professor's secrets.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN

speaker_heading: BORDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: -get you attention. Then quietly
speaker_heading: SAY-
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: "are you wacthing closely"... perhaps
dialog: say a magic word or two... then I'll

text: Borden VANISHES the ball, but FUMBLES it, it drops to Borden's

text: to retrieve the ball.
speaker_heading: SULLEN
dialog: How'd you get so famous, then?
dialog: Borden STANDS.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Magic.
text: Borden TURNS, NO LONGER CHAINED. Sullen JUMPS to his feet
text: to follow, but HIS ANKLE IS CHAINED TO THE TABLE. The other
text: PRISONERS are LAUGHING and CHEERING.
speaker_heading: SULLEN
dialog: Oi, Borden, get back here!
text: Sullen FUMBLES with his keys as Borden takes a BOW. Another

text: Angier slips the newspaper from the table.
speaker_heading: ANGIER

speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Cutter said it would be okay till we
dialog: get another booking.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: ANGIER
text: Researching. Part of a magician's
dialog: job is to watch his competition, to
dialog: see what illusions they're-
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: You're going to do something to that
dialog: man, aren't you?
text: Olivia moves closer. Angier is quiet.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Cutter's hopig you'll let things

dialog: are even between you then we can-
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Even? My wife for a couple of his
dialog: fingers? He has a child now. And
text: he's perfoming again.
speaker_heading: (BITTER)
text: Borden is out there, living his life

speaker_heading: OLIVIA

text: Olivia moves towards him.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. TINY, GRUBBY THEATRE -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Angier, almost unrecognizanle as a blonde, slips into the

dialog: Borden's last venue.
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
text: On the small raised stage, Borden works through his way
text: through the Chinese rings with GLOVED HANDS to hide his
text: damaged fingers. The tough crowd is JEERING AT HIM.
text: Borden puts the rings down on a table and PICKS UP a bag.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: I need a volunteer.
text: Angier takes a few steps towards the stage.
text: Borden produces a RUBBER BALL.
text: he TOSSES the ball to Angier.
speaker_heading: BORDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: As you can see , it's just a rubber
dialog: ball. But it's not normal at all.
text: Angier examines the ball. Hands it back to Borden who shows
text: no sign of recognizing Angier.
speaker_heading: BORDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you.
text: Angier notices that two TALL BLACK CABINETS are standing
text: twenty feet apart on the stage.
speaker_heading: BORDEN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO AUDIENCE)
dialog: You're not impressed?
text: Borden BOUNCES the BALL on the ground and catches it.
speaker_heading: BORDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a magic ball.
text: Borden continues to BOUNCE the ball on the floor. The
text: audience looks bored, waiting for something to happen.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA (V.O.)
dialog: What happened?
scene_heading: INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- NIGHT
text: Angier still in disguise, is slumped in an armchair, drink
text: in hand. He is SMILING, remembering.
text: Olivia, sitting on the workbench, waits for him to continue.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: What happened, Robert?
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: He had a new trick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Was it good?
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Angier looks at her...
scene_heading: INT. TINY, GRUBBY THEATRE -- EVENING
text: Now it's CUTTER standing in the audience, watching. Onstage,
text: Borden BOUNCES the ball over and over again.
speaker_heading: ANGIER (V.O.)
dialog: It was the greatest magic trick I
dialog: have ever seen.
text: Borden walks to one side of the stage and OPENS the door to
text: one of the cabinets. It's empty. He CLOSES it again and
text: crosses the stage, BOUNCING the ball the whole way.
text: At the far cabinet, Borden repeats the process, OPENING the
text: door to the empty cabinet. This time, however, he leaves
text: the door open.
text: He steps forwards and GENTLY BOUNCES the ball SIDEWAYS, across
dialog: the stage...
text: Borden STEPS into the CABINET behind him, CLOSING the door.
text: With no one on stage, the audience watches as the ball
text: continues to BOUNCE across the stage. BOUNCE. BOUNCE.
text: BOUNCE. The ball loses seep and height...
text: Just as reaches the second cabinet, something IMPOSSIBLE
dialog: happens.
text: THE DOOR TO THE SECOND CABINET OPENS AND BORDEN STEPS OUT,
text: CATCHING THE BALL.
text: Cutter FLINCHES, then studies Borden. The audience is
text: BEMUSED. Finally, a trickle of applause.
scene_heading: INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
text: Angier is talking to Cutter. Olivia is watching.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Did they applaud when you saw it?
speaker_heading: CUTTER
text: Not very enthusiastically.
scene_heading: INT. TINY, GRUBBY THEATRE -- NIGHT
text: Angier is disguise, starts CLAPPING loudly, FIRMLY, as if he
text: can't help it, LEADING the applause.
text: Borden BOUNCES the ball once again, then BOWS deeply. The
text: APPLAUSE peters out. Borden walks off the stage.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Angier turns to Cutter.
dialog: 52.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: The trick is too good -- too simple-
dialog: the audience harly knows what they've
dialog: seen.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: He's a dreadful magician.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: He's a wonderfull magician- he's a
dialog: dreadful showman. He doesn't know
dialog: how to dress it up, how to sell the
dialog: trick.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: How does he do it?
speaker_heading: CUTTER
text: He uses a double.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
speaker_heading: (SHAKES HEAD)
dialog: It's not that simple. This is a
dialog: complex illusion.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: You think that because you don't
dialog: know the method. It's a double who
text: comes out at the end. It's the only
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: I've seen his perfom ir three times
dialog: now, Mr. Cutter- the Prestige is the
speaker_heading: SAME MAN-
speaker_heading: CUTTER
speaker_heading: IT'S NOT-
speaker_heading: ANGIER
text: The same man comes out of the second
dialog: cabinet. I promise you.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: It is the same man.
text: They both turn to look at Olivia.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA (CONT'D)
text: He wears padded gloves to hide his
dialog: damaged fingers, but if you look
dialog: closely you can tell.
text: Angier looks at Cutter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: He doesn't know how to sell his trick
dialog: to an audience. But I do.
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
speaker_heading: (NODS)
dialog: It would give us our climax.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: The man stole my life. I'm going to
dialog: steal his trick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: We'll have to find someone who can
dialog: look like you on a stage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: He doesn't use a double-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
speaker_heading: (IMPACIENT)
dialog: I don't know how Borden does it,
dialog: Robert. So either you wait for Borden
dialog: to retire and buy his secret, or you
dialog: can listen to how I would do this
dialog: trick.
speaker_heading: (ANGIER NODS)
dialog: Ang the only way I know is to find
dialog: you a bloody good double.
dialog: 
text: Angier smiles. Turns to Olivia, pointing to his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Take a good look- let's get out
dialog: there and find me.

scene_heading: EXT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The lab is illuminated by thirty fot STREAMERS of electrical
text: DISCHARGE that pour from the base of the tower.
dialog: 
text: Angier stops, fearful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY
dialog: It's perfectly safe.
dialog: 
text: As Angier stares, a MAN begins to emerge from the very center
text: of the CONFLAGRATION.
dialog: 
text: Bolts SNAP and TRAIL after the man as he walks, in SILHOUETTE,
text: towards Angier.
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TESLA
dialog: So this is the Great Danton.
dialog: 
text: Tesla emerges from the ball of electricity, dressed as if he
text: were on his way to the opera. He brushes SPARKS from the
text: sleeve of his jacket as he extends a band to Angier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TESLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Alley has effused about your act
dialog: to me on any number of occasions.
dialog: Something you did with pockets?
dialog: 
text: Angier returns the handshake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: I saw a lecture you gave in London,
dialog: several years ago. I'm flattered
dialog: you agreed to see me.
text: Tesla keeps hold as Angier's hand.
dialog: 
text: Angier, confused, does so. Alley hands him a lightbulb,
text: which starts to glow as he grasps its metal base.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER (CONT'D)
dialog: What's conducting the electricity?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TESLA
dialog: Our bodies, Mr. Angier, are quite
dialog: capable of conducting, and indeed,
dialog: producing energy.
dialog: 
text: Tesla release Angier's hand. The bulb goes out. Alley takes
text: it from the Angier who looks at the palms of his hands.

scene_heading: EXT. DECK, LABORATORY -- MORNING

speaker_heading: TESLA

dialog: a very interesting device.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: I need something impossible.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TESLA
dialog: You're familiar with a phrase 'Man's
dialog: reach exceeds his grasp'?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 55.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TESLA (CONT'D)
dialog: (off his look)
text: It's a lie. Man's grasp exceeds his
dialog: nerve. The only limits on scientific
dialog: progress are these imposed by society.
text: Tesla looks out at the mountains.
speaker_heading: TESLA (CONT'D)
dialog: The first time I changed the world I
dialog: was hailed as a visionary. The second
dialog: time I was asked politely to retire.
dialog: The world only tolerates one change
dialog: at a time. And so here I am.
dialog: (gestures at laboratory)
dialog: Enjoying "retirement".
dialog: (looking at Angier)
dialog: Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier.
dialog: What you want is simply expensive.
text: Tesla rises, washing his hands in a basin on a side table.
speaker_heading: TESLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Alley says you are a stage magician.
dialog: If a built you this device, you would
dialog: be presenting it only as an illusion?
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: If people thought the things I did
dialog: on stage were real, they wouldn't
dialog: clap- they'd scream. Think of saving
text: a woman in half.
text: Tesla nods. Considering.
speaker_heading: TESLA
dialog: Mr.Angier, the cost of such a machine-
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Price is not an object.
speaker_heading: TESLA
dialog: Perhaps not. But have you considered
dialog: the cost?
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: I'm noit sure I follow.
speaker_heading: TESLA
dialog: I can make your machine, Mr. Angier.
dialog: But I can also give you some advice...
speaker_heading: (POINTED)
dialog: Go home. Forget this thing. I can
text: recognize an obsession. As Mr. Alley
dialog: could tell you, I myself an given to
dialog: one now and then. It will not do
dialog: you any good.
dialog: 56.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Have your obsessions done you no
dialog: good?
speaker_heading: TESLA
dialog: At first. But I've followed them
dialog: too long- I am their slave. Their
dialog: whipping boy. And one day they may
dialog: choose to destroy me.
text: Angier looks into Tesla's eyes.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: if you understand an obsession then
dialog: you know you won't change my mind.
speaker_heading: TESLA
speaker_heading: (SMILES)
dialog: So be it.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Will you build it?
speaker_heading: TESLA

dialog: Gerry?

speaker_heading: ROOT

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROOT (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (WHISPER)
dialog: Would you like for me to tell you a

text: Cutter breaks it up and pushes Root back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROOT (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (YELLING)

speaker_heading: ANGIER
text: He's out of his mind.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: He's an out-of-work actor- of course

speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: He's perfect. A little work, mind

speaker_heading: SARAH

dialog: You walk through this one- then...?
dialog: 
text: Angier stands Olivia in front of the door.
dialog: 
text: he pushes the door all way open. Suddenly, a TRAP-DOOR set
text: into the floor POPS open. Angier JUMPS through it-
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EMPIRE THEATRE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Olivia gathers up her skirts and DROPS through the hole-
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BENEATH THE EMPIRE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: -LANDING beside Angier on the straw matterss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Oof. Couldn't you find a softer
dialog: one?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
speaker_heading: (SMILES)
dialog: It's not for sleeping on.
dialog: 
text: Olivia looks around the below stage area.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: And Root goes up through there?
dialog: 59.
dialog: 
text: She gestures at a LIFT twenty feet away with a TRAP DOOR
text: MECHANISM above it. Angier nods. Olivia looks at Angier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's going to be amazing, Robert.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: It has to be. Borden's trick is
dialog: getting noticed. The place was packed
dialog: today.
dialog: 
text: Olivia looks at him strangely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: You went and saw his show again?
dialog: 
text: Angier looks away, embarrassed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: You becoming obsessed, Robert.
speaker_heading: CUTTER (O.S.)
dialog: Ready to meet yourself, Mr. Robert.
dialog: 
text: Angier and Olivia look up to see Cutter at the trap door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EMPIRE THEATRE -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Angier and Olivia sit in the front row. Cutter beckons Root
text: onstage. He's been clened up and dressed in Angier's stage
text: costume. he TRIPS on his way across the stage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: All I have to do is keep myself
text: stinking drunk all the time and no
dialog: one will be able to tell the
dialog: difference.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: A little faith, sir. Could you favor
dialog: us with a perfomance. Mr. Root?
dialog: 
text: Root picks himself up and dusts himself off.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, ROOT HAS BECOME ANGIER. he is channeling everything
text: from his facial expressions to his walk. Angier nods,
text: starting to believe this might work. The illusion is PERFECT --
text: till he opens his mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROOT
dialog: You would drink, too, if you know
dialog: the world half so well as I do.
dialog: 
text: Angier hops up onto stage, examining Root from different
text: angles. Root starts APING his every movement. Olivia starts
text: laughing. Angier is getting uncomfortable.
dialog: 60.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROOT (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you think you were unique, Mr.
dialog: Angier? I have been Cassar. I have
dialog: been Faust. How difficult could it
dialog: possibly be to play 'The Great
dialog: Danton?'
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: You can go back to being yourself.
dialog: Root. For free..
text: Root looks challengingly at both men.
speaker_heading: ROOT
dialog: I'd rather be him, for now. I find
dialog: it amusing.
text: Root WAVES his hands across his chest, in the same manner
text: that Angier does onstage. He produces a bottle of Gin from
text: thin air, and takes a long swallow and jumps down to Olivia.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Root has to keep a low profile--
text: anyone sees him the game's up.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
speaker_heading: (WATCHING ROOT)
dialog: I don't know how you do these things,
dialog: Cutter. I'm not sure I want to know.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Have you thought about what we should
dialog: call the trick?
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: No point being coy. Borden calls
dialog: his trick 'The Transported Man'?
text: Cutter nods.
scene_heading: EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE -- EVENING
text: The enormous MARQUEE of the Empire Theatre:
text: 'The Great Danton perfoms THE NEW TRANSPORTED MAN'
text: Beneath it, a CROWD. Fallon amongest them. STARING up at
dialog: the sign.
scene_heading: INT. EMPIRE THEATRE -- EVENING
text: Angier is onstage, nearing the end of his show, SMILING
text: BROADLY as he pulls dozens of FLOWERS from thin air and tosses
text: them to the crowd. APPLAUSE fills the theatre.
dialog: 
text: The DOORFRAMES are wheeld out on either side of the stage.
text: Angier approaches the edge of the stage to address the
text: audience with a suddenly SOLEMN demeanor.
dialog: 61.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, much of what
dialog: you've seen tonight can be termed
text: illusions. Entertaining trifles of
dialog: the sort you may have seen other
text: magicians perform.
dialog: 
text: Angier puts on a TOP HAT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Alas, I cannot claim this next feat
dialog: as illusion. Watch carefully- you
dialog: will see no trickery, for no trickery
dialog: is being employed. Merely a techique
dialog: familiar to certain citizens of the
dialog: orient and various holy men of the
dialog: Himalyas. Indeed, some of you may
dialog: be familiar with this technique, but
dialog: for those of you who aren't, do not
dialog: be alarmed, what you are about to
dialog: see is considered safe...
dialog: 
text: Angier gracefully TURNS and heads upstage to the right-hand
text: door, opens it, SLAPS it to show that is sold.
dialog: 
text: Then strolls through crossing the stage-
dialog: 
text: -to the other door, which he opens, SLAPPING to show its
text: solidity, then walking trough the frame.
dialog: 
text: Angier removes his TOP HAT and THROWS it high into the air.
text: It sails back down to him and he catches it.
dialog: 
text: Angier THROWS the HAT again, even harder this time, and it
text: disappears uo into the rafters. After a beat, it is clear
text: it's not coming back down.
dialog: 
text: LAUGHTER. Angier snaps his fingers and the hat is dropped
text: back down to him. He catches it.
dialog: 
text: Angier movies to the first door and THROWS HIS HAT in a HIGH
text: ARC across the stage. He OPENS the door- steps behind it...
dialog: 
text: The second DOOR, FAR ACROSS THE STAGE, IMMEDIATELY opens and
text: ANGIER/ROOT EMERGES, REACHING UP TO CATCH THE HAT.
dialog: 
text: BOTH DOORS SLAMS SHUT behind him. He puts on the hat.
dialog: 
scene_heading: The AUDIENCE ERUPTS- A STANDING OVATION, Fallon the only one
text: in his seat as Angier/Root takes his BOWS.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Angier, hearing the MASSIVE APPLAUSE, climbs off the straw
text: mattress, PEERING up through the cracks in the floorboards.
dialog: 
text: Smiling, Angier turns to the unseen audience and BOWS.
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM -- EVENING
text: Angier, Olivia, and Cutter are CELEBRATING their sucess.
text: Empty bottles of champagne line the makeup table.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
speaker_heading: (TOAST)
dialog: To our achivement.
dialog: They drink.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: The manager said he's never seen a
dialog: reaction like it.
text: Angier smiles, rueful.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: At least he got to see it. I spent
text: the ovation hidden under the stage.
dialog: No one cares about the man who
text: disappears, the man who goes into
dialog: the box. They care about the man
text: who comes out the other side.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: I care about the man in the box.
text: Angier turns to Olivia, raises his glass.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: (TO CUTTER)
dialog: Maybe we could switch before the
dialog: trick. That way I could be the
text: Prestige and Root ends up below stage.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
speaker_heading: (SHAKES HEAD)
dialog: The antecipation of the trick is
dialog: everything- it needs your showmanship
text: to built suspense. If Root opens
text: his mouth, it's all over- he can't
dialog: introduce the trick.
speaker_heading: ROOT (O.S.)
dialog: of course I can. I'm the Great
dialog: Danton.
text: They turn. Root is lying behind a trunk, still in costume.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Root, you bloody fool, get that
text: costume and makeup off right now,
dialog: anyone could walk in here!
dialog: 
text: Cutter is SLAPPING Root to his feet. He grabs his collar
text: and turns to Angier and Olivia.
dialog: 63.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Congratulation, all.
dialog: 
text: Cutter DRAGS Root out. Olivia slides onto the makeup table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: I suppose I should get more rest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Life is not full of these moments,
dialog: Robbie.
dialog: 
text: Olivia pours him some more champagne.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: We've worked hard for this, and we
dialog: need to celebrate properly.
dialog: 
text: Angier looks up at her with a gentle smile. She pulls him
text: in closer and they KISS. She wraps her legs around him.
text: They kiss again.
dialog: 
text: Angier pulls back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)
dialog: It is your wife?
dialog: 
text: Angier shakes his head, distracted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: The trick isn't good enough.
dialog: 
text: Olivia stares at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Didn't you see the audience?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Well, they loved it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: It's not as good as his trick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Borden's trick is nothing compared
dialog: to ours. He doesn't have any style-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: He doesn't have to spend the finale
text: hiding under the stage.
dialog: 
text: Angier rises, turning out of her embrace.
dialog: 64.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER (CONT'D)
dialog: I need to know how he does it.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: So that I can do it better.
text: Angier turns to her. Looks her in the eye.
speaker_heading: ANGIER (CONT'D)
dialog: I need you to go and work for him.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Work for him? Are you joking
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: You'll be my spy.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
speaker_heading: (TAKEN ABACK)
dialog: We just got our start and you want
dialog: me to leave?
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: It's how we advance.
text: Angier moves to Olivia, placing his hands on her shoulders.
speaker_heading: ANGIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Think of it, Olivia... we've got
dialog: people excited about Cutter's version
dialog: of the trick- imagine what we could
dialog: do with the real illusion. We'll
dialog: have the greatest magic act anyone's
dialog: ever seen.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
speaker_heading: (FRUSTATED)
dialog: He knows I work for you.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Exactly why he'll want to hire you.
dialog: He'll want my secrets.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Why would he trust me?
text: Angier thinks for a second. Then smiles.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Because you're going to tell him the
dialog: truth.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Alley shows Angier in. Tesla is sitting, reading.
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TESLA
dialog: You must be curious to see what so
dialog: much money had bought you, Mr. Angier.
dialog: 
text: Tesla RISES. Leads Angier to a back corner at the room and
text: pulls a SHEET from a ten-foot tall apparatus- the ELECTRICAL
text: MACHINE Angier used on stage in the opening of the film.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TESLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Fitting that you should be here for
dialog: the maiden voyage.
dialog: 
text: Alley FIRES a GENERATOR connected by thick cables to the
text: machine. It RUMBLES into life, smoke pouring from the slats.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TESLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Your hat.
dialog: 
text: Angier takes off his hat and tries to hand it to Tesla.
text: Alley intercepts the hat and lays it on a chalk hasmark
text: directly underneath the machine. He returns to the controls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY
dialog: You might want to stand back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TESLA
dialog: No, no. It will be fine. Mr. Alley,
dialog: please proceed.
dialog: 
text: Without further ceremony, Alley FIRES the machine.
dialog: 
text: Nothing happens. Then, as they watch, the GLOBE on top of
text: the tripped FLASHES whits hot. BOLTS shooting out of it,
text: wrapping themselves around the legs of the tripod. The CHARGE
text: reaches a FREEZY and then emits a loud BANG, as if it has
text: broken the sound barrier.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the room is still.
dialog: 
text: Tesla walks forward. Looks down into the pit.
dialog: 
text: Alley joins him at the edge of the pit. Angier, limping,
text: is the last to arrive, locking into the pit-
dialog: 
text: -at the TOP HAT, which hasn't moved an inch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: I don't understand-
dialog: 
text: Tesla STARES at the hat as if trying to melt it with
text: CONCENTRARION. Alley pulls Angier away from the pit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY
dialog: Perhaps it would be best if you left
dialog: us to it. We'll see you next week?
dialog: 
text: Angier begins to protest but Alley gestures towards the door.
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
text: A small, disused shop off an arcade, crowed with tools,
text: cabinetry and props, windows plastered with playbills. Borden
text: is sitting at a workbench, sleeves rolled up, working a lathe.
text: Fallon enters, Olivia behind him. Borden looks back at her,
text: turns back to the table, instinctively putting on his gloves.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
speaker_heading: (LOOKING AROUND)
dialog: Interesting workshop.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: We make do.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: My name is Olivia Wenscombe.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: I know who you are. Are you here to
dialog: steal the rest of my show?
text: Olivia sees one of the theatrical notices that litter the
text: shop: "THE GREAT DANTON BREAKS RECORD WITH HIS ASTONISHING
speaker_heading: NEW TRICK"
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: No. I'm here to give your show what
text: is missing.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: And what might that be?
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Me.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
speaker_heading: (TO FALLON)
dialog: Wasn't I just saying that, Bernard?
text: A woman's touch.
text: Fallon leaves, closing the door.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: I've left Angier. I want a job.
text: Borden sits there.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you have no reason to trust
dialog: ME-
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Why on earth shouldn't I trust you?
dialog: The mistress of my enemy.
dialog: 
text: Olivia is taken aback. Chanes tack.
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Mr.Borden-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Alfred.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Alfred. I'm going to tell you the
dialog: truth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Ah. The truth. A slippery notion
dialog: in our life of work, Miss Wenscombe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: I'm here because he sent me here.
dialog: He wants me to come and work for you
dialog: and steal your secret.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: What does he need my secret for?
dialog: His trick is top notch. The Great
text: Danton vanishes and isntantly
text: reappears on the other side of the
dialog: stage -- mute, overweight, and,
dialog: unless I'm mistaken, rather drunk.
dialog: 
text: Borden rises, moves closer to Olivia.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell me, Olivia. Does he like taking
text: his bows under the stage?
dialog: 
text: Olivia meets his gaze.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: No. It's killing him. he's obsessed
dialog: with discovering your method. He
dialog: thinks of nothing else, and takes no
dialog: pleasure in our sucess. I've had
dialog: enough. There's no future with him.
dialog: He sent me here to steal your secrets,
dialog: but I've actually come to offer you
dialog: his.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: He has no secrets from me.
dialog: 
text: Borden stares at her, unsure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: And this is the truth?
dialog: 
text: She gives Borden a challenging smile/shrug.
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE -- DAY
text: Cutter is fixing a prop mechanism. Angier approaches, in
text: his undershirt, looks over his shoulder. Cutter glances up.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Best be getting changed for the
dialog: martinee, sir.
text: - Angier nods. Cutter REALIZES.
speaker_heading: CUTTER (CONT'D)
dialog: ROOT! You're late.
speaker_heading: (SNIFFS)
dialog: And even more drunk than usual. Get
dialog: yourself below stairs, right away!
speaker_heading: ROOT
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: No?!
text: Root looks at Cutter with genuine malice.
speaker_heading: ROOT
dialog: We need to have a chat, Mr.Cutter.
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM -- DAY
text: Angier is applying his makeup. Cutter enters. Angier looks
text: at him through the mirror.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: We have a problem, Cutter.
text: He holds up the paper, folded to an advertisement:
scene_heading: PANTAGES THEATRE- FROM NEXT WEEK- THE PROFESSOR WILL
scene_heading: DEMONSTRATE THE ORIGINAL TRANSPORTED MAN- ACCEPT NO CHEAP
dialog: IMITATIONS!!!
speaker_heading: ANGIER (CONT'D)
dialog: He'll be perfoming right across the
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: We have a bigger problem. Root.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Don't tell me he fell over again.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Worse. He realized he can make
dialog: demands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: He's blackmailing us?
dialog: 69.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: In a word, yes. I'm surprised, to
dialog: be honest- it usually takes them a
dialog: lot longer to figure it out.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: How much does he want?
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: It makes no difference- we have to
dialog: stop doing the trick.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
speaker_heading: (WIELDS PAPER)
dialog: Stop doing the trick? Look at this.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Look at yesterday's. And last week's,
dialog: where they called you "London's
dialog: premiere stage performer", not
dialog: "magician" mind. Performer. Of any
dialog: kind.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: What's the point?
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: My point, Robert, is that you've
dialog: climbed too high to get away with
dialog: any kind of professional
dialog: embarrassament. We're not doing any
dialog: tricks we can't control.
text: Angier considers this. Nods. Thinking.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Pay him whatever he wants, for now.
dialog: We keep doing the trick till Borden
dialog: opens, then we'll phase it out.
scene_heading: INT. BENEATH THE EMPIRE STAGE -- NIGHT
text: Root smokes a cigarette. PULL BACK to reveal he is standing
text: on the LIFT beneath the stage...
text: The trapdoor OPENS and Angier DROPS onto the straw mattress.
text: He looks over to see Root finishing his cigarette.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
speaker_heading: (HISSES)
dialog: Get up there!!
text: Root smirks at Angier- TOSSES the cigarette and CATAPULTS up-
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAGE, EMPIRE THEATRE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: -onto the stage and STEPS/STUMBLES out from behind the door
text: to LOUD APPLAUSE.
dialog: 70.
dialog: 
text: Root has a SLOPPY GRIN as he STRUTS acroos the stage, milking
text: the applause from every angle, blowing kisses, winking...
text: loving it. He turns to Cutter in the wings. Blows him a
dialog: kiss.
dialog: 
text: Cutter GLARES. Then TURNS to a stagehand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Get it down!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER (V.O.)
dialog: Cutter was always surprised how fast
dialog: Root turned bad.
dialog: 
text: The stagehand starts LOWERING THE CURTAIN.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Angier sits with Borden's dairy.
speaker_heading: ANGIER (V.O.)
dialog: We paid him enough to keep him in
dialog: beer- you wouldn't expect him to
dialog: rock the boat. Today I learned
dialog: Borden's view on the episode...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TAVERN -- EVENING
dialog: 
text: The bar is dark and seedy, packed with an unpromising lot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER (V.O.)
dialog: ...and his account suggests a reason.
dialog: 
text: Root is hanging precariously from his barstool, head lolling
text: towards his empty glass. He is in his own clothes, but
text: cleaned up to look like Angier.
dialog: 
text: A full PINT arrives in front of him. Root turns to face his
text: benefactor- BORDEN. Root takes several large GULPS, staring
text: at Borden. Suppresses a belch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROOT
dialog: To what do I owe the pleasure of
dialog: this rather welcome pint of ale?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: You are the Great Danton, aren't
dialog: you?
dialog: 
text: Root gestures silence, glancing around them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROOT
dialog: Of course I am. But don't advertise
dialog: it- I'll be mobbed with fans.
dialog: (grins at Borden)
dialog: And who might you be?
dialog: 71.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Just a humble admirer. And fellow
dialog: practitioner.
speaker_heading: ROOT
dialog: Ah, very good.
text: Root DOWNS the rest of his new pint, placing the empty glass
text: in front of Borden with an emphatic THUNK.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Another?
speaker_heading: ROOT
dialog: If you insist. I'm not perfoming
dialog: tonight. Well, only one show, and,
dialog: to be frank, my people pretty much
dialog: run things these days.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: You could probably do it blindfolded.
speaker_heading: ROOT
dialog: Bloody good idea.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Have it.
speaker_heading: ROOT
dialog: Thanks.
text: A new pint arrives. Root sips.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Actually, there's something I might
dialog: warn you about.
speaker_heading: ROOT
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Well, it's your Transported Man
dialog: illusion. Now, I'm noit claiming to
dialog: know your method... but I had a
dialog: similar trick in my act- and I used...
dialog: (looks around,
speaker_heading: WHISPERING)
dialog: ...a double.
speaker_heading: ROOT
dialog: Oh, I see, very good.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: At first. Then it went bad. You
dialog: se, I hadn't counted on the fact
dialog: that once I incorporated this bloke
dialog: into my act, he had complete power
dialog: over me.
dialog: 72.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROOT
dialog: Complete power, you say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
speaker_heading: (NODDING GRAVELY)
dialog: Weel, he was the secret, you see.
dialog: And the more successful I became,
dialog: the more outrageous his demands
text: became. He practically backrupted
dialog: me. In the end I had to stop
text: performing the illusion completely.
dialog: (looks at Root)
dialog: You must be very careful about giving
dialog: someone that power over you.
dialog: 
text: Root looks at Borden. Drunken whells spinning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROOT
dialog: Thanks for the warning.
scene_heading: INT. STAGE, EMPIRE THEATRE -- EVENING
dialog: 
text: Angier is almost all the way through his act.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: ...some of you may be familiar with
dialog: this technique, but for those of you
dialog: who aren't, do not be alarmed, what
dialog: you are about to see is considered
dialog: safe...
dialog: 
text: Angier takes his time, confident, MILKING IT. He throws his
text: HAT into the air, catches it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Angier DROPS ten feet to the concrete floor. But there is
dialog: NOTHING to break his fall-
dialog: 
text: He SMASHES painfully to the ground. CLUTCHING his leg in
text: AGONY, he looks up and sees SOMEONE standing on the lift
text: twenty feet away... BORDEN.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The first door slams shut. The audience turns their attention
text: to second door.
dialog: 
text: The door remains closed. The HAT falls gently to the floor.
text: SILENCE, broken by a COUGH in the audience.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: BORDEN bows to Angier- the LIFT ROCKETS BORDEN UP THROUGH
scene_heading: THE STAGE FLOOR.
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The second door OPENS, and BORDEN steps through, looking all
text: around, CONFUSED, as if he doesn't know where he is. He
text: looks back at the door, then picks up the HAT...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Angier looks at his leg- a nasty COMPOUND FRACTURE. As he
text: chokes on pain he can hear LAUGHTER from the AUDIENCE.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: As Borden mugs with the hat, trying it on and finding it too
text: small, something is LOWERED from the flies above:
dialog: 
text: ANGIER/ROOT, BOUND AND GAGGED, HANGS from a chain. A sign
text: around his neck reads: "OPENING AT PANTAGE- THE PROFESSOR"
dialog: 
text: Borden looks up behind him.
speaker_heading: BORDEN

scene_heading: INT. APARTAMENT -- EVENING

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER

speaker_heading: OLIVIA

speaker_heading: ANGIER (CONT'D)
dialog: He's taken everything from me. My

dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: What do you mean? You sent me to-
dialog: 
text: Angier takes her by the shoulders, ROUGHLY.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: I sent you to steal his secret- not
dialog: to improve his act-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: That's my job-!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Or to fall in love with him!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: You abandoned me to him!
dialog: 
text: Angier SLAPS her. She shakes her head at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: I did everything you asked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
speaker_heading: (CHALLENGING)
dialog: Yes? Then how does he do it?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Cutter was right- it's a double.
dialog: 
text: Angier shakes his head, furious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Of course Borden said that-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: He didn't say anything- he'd never
dialog: say. I've seen things- make-up,
dialog: glasses, wigs. We don't use any of
dialog: it for the show, but I've found it
text: hidden backstage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
speaker_heading: (SCORN)
dialog: It's misdirection- he leaves those
dialog: things lying around to make you think
text: he's using a double.
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: All the time? He doesn't know when
dialog: I'M LOOKING-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: All the time, Olivia- that's who he
dialog: is, that's what it takes- he lives
dialog: his act, don't you see?!
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: And just because you're sleeping
dialog: with him doesn't mean he trusts you.
dialog: 
text: Olivia glares athim, tears forming in her eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: You thing you can see everything,
dialog: don't you?
dialog: 
text: She moves to her bed, REACHING below the mattress.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA (CONT'D)

dialog: fool.
dialog: 
text: Olivia tosses something at Angier: a CARDBOARD-BOUND NOTEBOOK.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: His notebook.
dialog: 
text: Angier starts leafing desperately through pages.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: You stole it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: I borrowed it for tonight. I thought
dialog: you'd be able to translate some of
dialog: it, but now I realize-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: I can't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
speaker_heading: (SCORN)
dialog: You can't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Olivia, no one could-
speaker_heading: (STUDIES PAGES)
dialog: It's a cypher- with a transposition
dialog: that probably shifts every day of
text: the diary. Even with the keyword it
dialog: would take months to decode...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: And without the keyword?
dialog: 77.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Perhaps never. We'll see.
dialog: 
text: Angier puts the cardboard-bound notebook into his pocket.
text: Olivia, worried, holds out her hand for the notebook.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: No, we won't- if I don't get that

dialog: took it.
dialog: 
text: Angier looks at her, incredulous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: You can'r possibly think I'd let
dialog: this go? This is his diary, Olivia.
dialog: All of his secrets are right here,
dialog: in my hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
speaker_heading: (PLEADING)
dialog: Don't do this do me, Robert!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: Leave him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: He knows where I live!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: I need to know his method.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
speaker_heading: (DESPERATE)
dialog: It won't get your wife back, Robert.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: I don't care about my wife- I care

dialog: 
text: Angier stops, realizing what he said. Calms himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: He'll know it was you-
dialog: 
text: Angier puts his hands GENTLY on her shoulders.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Yes, me, not you. Understand?
dialog: 
text: Olivia nods, crying. Still scared. Angier drags his leg to

dialog: 78.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Robert? I have fallen in love with

text: Angier looks at her, sympathetic.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: I'm impressed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Why's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: You're finally getting your hands
dialog: dirty. This is what a good trick
dialog: costs, Angier. Risk. Sacrifice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is all
dialog: going to be yours. Unless you give
dialog: me what I want.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Which is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER

speaker_heading: ANGIER (CONT'D)
dialog: I want the method not the keyword- I

speaker_heading: ANGIER

speaker_heading: CUTTER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell me Olivia. Does he like taking
text: his bows under the stage?
dialog: 
text: Olivia meets his gaze.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
text: No. It's killing him. He's obssessed
dialog: with discovering your method. he
dialog: thinks of nothing else, and takes no
dialog: pleasure in our success. I've had

dialog: I hate him for that.
text: They sit there in silence, appraising each other.
speaker_heading: BORDEN

speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: You may know he does his tricks...

dialog: can see that yours are better.
text: She tenderly PEELS OFF his padded glove revealing his
text: mutiladed hand.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: You hide this. I had to look closely
dialog: to spot it when you performed the
dialog: Transported Man.
dialog: (looks into his eyes)
dialog: But this makes you unique... it shows
dialog: the audience that you aren't using a
dialog: double; You musn't hide it, you
dialog: must display it proudly...
dialog: (looks at hand)
dialog: I'm sure it takes great skill to
text: perform illusions with one good hand.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)

speaker_heading: BORDEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes, Angier. She gave you this

dialog: led me to Root, and yes, Tesla is
dialog: merely the key to my dairy, not to
dialog: my trick. Did you really think I
dialog: would part with my secret so easily

speaker_heading: ANGIER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY
dialog: Who by?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Tesla never made a machine like the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY
dialog: We never said he had.

speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: You let me believe that he had, Alley!
speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: ANGIER (CONT'D)
dialog: You stole my money because your
dialog: funding was cut off- you've been
text: shooting sparks at my top hat,
dialog: laughing at me all along while you
dialog: use my money to stave off ruin.
dialog: I've seen Edison's men-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY
dialog: Where?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: In the hotel. I've every mind to
dialog: bring them up here myself-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TESLA
dialog: That would be unwise, Mr.Angier.
dialog: 
text: Tesla is holding a cage containing a large tabby CAT.
speaker_heading: TESLA (CONT'D)
dialog: It is true, sir, that you are your

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY
dialog: Sir, my cat?
dialog: 
text: Tesla silences Alley with a tiny GLANCE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: When I told you I could make your
dialog: machine I spoke the simple truth.
dialog: Science is just a name for the art
text: of rendering the exotic mundane. It
dialog: has no boundaries- its very purpose
dialog: is to destroy boundaries.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Then why isn't the machine working?
dialog: 
text: Tesla gives Angier the slightest of smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TESLA
dialog: Because exact science, Mr.Angier, is
dialog: not an exact science. The machine
dialog: simply does not operate as expected.
dialog: It needs continued examination.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Where did my top hat go?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY
dialog: Nowhere.
dialog: 
text: Alley points to the top hat, which is sitting on a workbench.
dialog: 90.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: We've tried the damn thing a dozen
dialog: times. And the hat went nowhere.
speaker_heading: TESLA
dialog: Which is why we need to rey a
dialog: different material. It may provoke
text: a different result.
text: Tesla opens the cage and points the open end at Alley.
speaker_heading: TESLA (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't expect me to handle the
dialog: thing myself?
text: Alley reluctantly reaches into the cage and pulls out the
text: TERRIFIED CAT. He jumps down into the pit and secures the
text: animal bu its collar to a eye-hook sunk into the ground.
speaker_heading: ALLEY
dialog: You are responsible for whatever
dialog: happens to this animal, Doctor.
text: Alley pulls himself out of the pit, and Tesla CHARGES the
dialog: generator.
text: The cat stares up at the machine around it and HISSES.
text: Without ceremony, Tesla FIRES the machine. As before, large
text: BOLTS spew from the head of the machine, down towards the
text: unseen cat. The machine build to a DEAFENING ROAR, then
text: sputters out.
text: Silence. The three men begin edging towards the pit.
text: Suddenly, a terrifying SCREECH. The cat is still there,
text: still tied to the hook.
text: Alley breathes a sigh of relief and starts to free the car.
text: Tesla looks frustated. Suddenly, the cat bursts free of
text: Alley and ROCJETS through the open side door of the lab.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: I'll go.
text: Angier limps after the cat.
scene_heading: EXT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: EXT. FOREST -- CONTINUOUS

dialog: 91.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Here, kitty, kitty.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, a HORRIBLE SCREECHING reaches Angier. He begins
dialog: to follow the noise.
dialog: 
text: He stops at the opening of a tiny GLADE, no more than ten
text: feet across.
dialog: 
text: Two IDENTICAL CATS are fighting viciously in front of Angier.
text: He tries to separate the two animals, and succeeds in grabbing
text: one. The other cat RACES off.
dialog: 
text: Angier takes a few steps after it, then FREEZES, staring at-
dialog: 
text: TOP HATS. Clustered in a small glads. The first cat slinks
text: its way through them.
dialog: 
text: The SECOND BLACK cat jumps from Angier's hands- RACES into
text: the glade, HISSING, SPITTING, CHASING the first cat into the
scene_heading: WOODS BEYOND-
dialog: 
text: Angier is left alone in the clearing, staring at the pile of
text: dozens of IDENTICAL TOP HATS.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH, TESLA'S LABORATORY -- DAY
dialog: 
text: The top hats are in a pile on the dark. Tesla is at the
text: table, measuring two HATS with a pair of Calipers. Angier
text: and Alley are watching.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: So the machine was working?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEY
dialog: I never bothered to check the
text: calibration. The hat never moved.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TESLA
dialog: These things never quite work as you
dialog: expect them to, Mr. Angier. That's
dialog: one of the principal beauties of
dialog: science.
dialog: 
text: Tesla looks carefully at the hat in his hands. It has a
text: tiny TEAR on the inside of the brim. He picks up another
text: hat. It has the same TEAR.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TESLA (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll need a couple of weeks to iron
speaker_heading: OUT THE-

dialog: 
text: Angier, still dazed, takes his cane and heads for the door.
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TESLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't forget your hat.
text: Angier stops and looks at the pile of hats.
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Which one is mine?
speaker_heading: TESLA
dialog: They are all your hat, Mr. Angier.

scene_heading: INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY

speaker_heading: JESS

speaker_heading: BORDEN

speaker_heading: BORDEN

speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Daddy has some errands to run. I'll
dialog: be back before you know it, so get

dialog: 
text: Borden walks to the door. As he does, Sarah enters, avoiding

dialog: 93.
dialog: 
text: She reaches for the sherry decanter. He watches her pour.
text: Sarah looks at him, eyes red from crying.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: We each have our vices.
text: Borden moves to her, gentle concern in his eyes.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Sarah. Whatever you may think, your

text: She looks into his eyes. Fascinated.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You mean it today.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That makes it so much harder when
dialog: you don't.

scene_heading: EXT. CANAL -- AFTERNOON
text: Borden walks along a disused strecth of industrial canal

text: Borden wanders into a tunel. Another man is waiting for
dialog: him -- Fallon.
text: Fallon hands Borden a folded piece of paper. He studies it.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: More shopping. She doesn't like the
dialog: smell of money, doesn't she?
text: Fallon looks away. Borden tears up the paper.
speaker_heading: BORDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: The little lady wants to visit the
dialog: Zoo, I thought you could take her.
dialog: I'll do it tomorrow, if not.
dialog: (looks at his feet)
dialog: Sarah... she knows. At least, she
dialog: knows things aren't right.

speaker_heading: PLEADING)
dialog: Help me with her. Try and convince

scene_heading: INT. OLIVIA'S APARTMENT

speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: What is it. Freddy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN

text: PIECES. Everything else is gone.
dialog: 
text: Angier notices a piece of metal lying in the road near him,

speaker_heading: BORDEN

speaker_heading: EXACTLY-

speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: Why only 100 performances? Do his

dialog: a publicity move?
text: Borden walks back and stares at the sketch.
speaker_heading: BORDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Fifty yards in a second. And all I

dialog: 
text: Angier looks at him, serious.
dialog: 109.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIER
dialog: Do you really want to know?
text: Cutter considers Angier's grave tone.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Perhaps not.

scene_heading: INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
text: Borden sits at his work bench. Fallon fiddles with his howler
dialog: hat.
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: They do this every night. After
dialog: each performance?
text: Fallon nods. Borden gets to his feet with a sigh. Turns to
text: a POSTER on the wall- "The Great Danton Perform THE REAL
scene_heading: TRANSPORTED MAN- 100 SHOWS ONLY"
text: He studies the image of Angier. There is a small DEVIL
text: looking over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: BORDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: We're done.
dialog: (turns to Fallon)
dialog: Let him have this trick. You're not
dialog: to go back there. I don't need to
dialog: know his secret. Leave him alone.
text: Fallon puts on his hat with a shrug.
scene_heading: INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- EVENING
text: A packed house. Many hands raised. Move in on a BEARDED
text: MAN, his gloved hand tentatively rising into the air. IT IS
speaker_heading: BORDEN.
text: A GLAMOROUS ASSISTANT beckons Borden from the aisle. He
text: shuffles along his row towards her. Embarrassed.
text: Borden and four other VOLUNTEERS follow the Assistant down
text: towards the stage...
text: On which stands Angier, leaning on his cane, smiling. Looming
text: over him is the large and complex ELECTRICAL MACHINE. Borden
text: STARES at the machine as he mounts the stage.
text: Borden, FASCINATED, and the other volunteers look over the
text: vast machine. As Angier GESTURES theatrically at the various
text: features of the metal and glass apparatus.
dialog: 
text: As the Assistant leads the Volunteers to the side of the

speaker_heading: STAGEHAND

dialog: 
text: Borden pulls off his beard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORDEN
dialog: I'm part of the act, you fool!
dialog: 
text: The Stagehand raises his eyebrows and steps aside. Borden

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Who was that?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS
text: Angier throws switches on his machine. As it GROANS into

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Borden fumbles through the darkned area, lit by flashes and
text: sparks through gaps in the boards of the stage above. He
text: GASPS as a flash illuminates a STAGEHAND with SOLID WHITE

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- NIGHT

text: Angier, facing the audience, steps backwards into the machine.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: BOLTS of electricity draw inwards, wrapping Angier in a ball

dialog: 
text: Borden SMASHES again and again at the glass of the tank,
text: which spiders, then CRACKS, and finally GIVES WAY.
dialog: 
text: WATER bursts from the tank, sweeping Angier's body into
text: Borden, and both of them onto gournd.
text: Above them we can hear YELLING. Borden rolls Angier onto

dialog: 
text: ANGIER IS DEAD.
dialog: 
text: Borden is frozen, unable to move.

dialog: This is the machine?
speaker_heading: (OFF LOOK)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Out of the question, I'm afraid.
