dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK SCREEN
text: MUSIC. STRINGS. Deep and dark. Distant voices.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN YARD
text: A young man is walking along the tracks. A slow, aimless
text: walk. Lost and lonely. A setting sun at his back. He's
text: handsome in a rugged, dangerous way. Denim and leather.
text: A great sadness and confusion on his face. His name is
scene_heading: KEITH NELSON.
text: DRUMS OBLITERATE THE STRINGS, and we RETURN TO BLACK and
scene_heading: TITLES BEGIN.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - GIRL
text: She's playing drums to the TRACK. Hard, serious. With
text: great purpose and need. She's boyish and tough. Her
text: prettiness is intentionally buried beneath acres of atti-
text: tude. This is WATTS. DRUMMER GIRL.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: TITLES CONTINUE
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - CLOSE - BOY AND GIRL
text: Beautiful girl, handsome boy. Perfection meets perfection.
text: Making-out against the yellow slatted light of a darkened
text: bedroom. She's AMANDA JONES. He's HARDY JENNS.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: TITLES CONTINUE TO END
scene_heading: EXT. TRACKS - TRAIN
text: A freight train is thundering down the tracks. A HORN BLASTS.
text: The speeding bulk dominates the FRAME. The SOUND of DIESEL
text: ENGINES and CHATTERING TRACK obliterates the MUSIC.
scene_heading: EXT. TRACKS
text: The boy we saw before, Keith Nelson, continues down the track.
text: He looks up.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: The train is bearing down on him.
scene_heading: EXT. TRACKS - ANOTHER ANGLE
text: BEHIND Keith TO SEE that he's walking into the approaching
text: train. The HORN BLASTS AGAIN.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - KEITH
text: Watching the train. No reaction. A collision with the train
dialog: will only give him what he wants. Change.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: The train shudders and rocks on the track. The HORN BLASTS
text: AND HOLDS.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - KEITH
text: Still no change in expression.
scene_heading: EXT. TRACKS - KEITH AND THE TRAIN
text: FROM BEHIND Keith. The train FILLS THE FRAME. It's nearly
text: on him. He steps out off the tracks at the last moment.
scene_heading: EXT. TRACKS - SIDING
text: Keith heads down the embankment as the train hurtles past.
dialog: No change in expression.
scene_heading: EXT. LOWER MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The homes of working people. Squat bungalows, clean but
text: modest. A black Corvette is parked in the driveway of one
text: of the houses. It stands out among the more utilitarian
text: vehicles on the street. An incongruent luxury. A front
text: door opens, and the boy and the girl we saw making-out in
text: the TITLE SEQUENCE step out of the house. Her blouse is
text: untucked, her hair's mussed, stocking feet. She's flushed
text: and floating. He's in a hurry. Done with her, on to other
text: things. She holds him back and kisses him. There's no
text: tenderness on his part. It's one-sided.
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - ACROSS THE STREET
text: Keith is across the street, leaning on a lamp post. His
text: gritty hands wrapped around the pole. Washed but never
text: clean. A hint of anger, a touch of resentment. Hardy
dialog: doesn't belong in the neighborhood. Certainly doesn't de-
dialog: serve the girl.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: 15
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Hardy gets in his car, fires the engine and backs out of
text: the driveway. Amanda waves goodbye from the porch. Hardy
text: drops the Corvette in gear and squeals away. An irresis-
text: table show of disrespect for the neighborhood.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - KEITH
dialog: There's something tragic about his look. Hardy has every-
dialog: thing money can buy and is now stealing the things it can't.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Amanda goes back in the house.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - KEITH
text: His observation was careful and considered. He looks at
text: his greasy hands. Too dirty to touch her. He pushes off
dialog: the pole.
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER BLOCK IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
text: A tired two story in a modest neighborhood. Clean but simple.
dialog: Maybe a little nicer than Amanda's neighborhood. But not
text: much. Keith cuts across the freshly mown lawn, up the drive-
text: way and around the back of the house.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: Keith's mother, CAROL, is at a small built-in desk beneath
text: a wall phone balancing her checkbook. She's wearing nurse's
text: whites. She works. Dinner is on the fire. A ten-year-old
text: girl, CINDY, is sitting at the kitchen table. She's cata-
text: loguing her Garbage Pail kids in a photo album. Keith comes
text: in the back door. Cindy strikes.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: It's Semi-Conscious Keith.
text: Keith ignores her and continues through the kitchen. Carol
text: addresses him without looking up.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Hi, honey. How was work?
text: He exits into the dining room.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You still haven't told me when
dialog: you're going to cut your hair.

speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Mom? You're flapping your lips
text: in vain. Keith vacated.
text: Carol addresses Cindy without looking up.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Speak English, please.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER
text: Keith crosses out of the dining into the foyer. His father
text: calls to him from the living room.
speaker_heading: CLIFF (V.0.)
dialog: Keith? Is that you?
text: Keith stops at the bottom of the stairs. He sighs. Caught.
text: He swings around and steps into the living room.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: Keith's father, CLIFF, is sitting on the couch. Spread out
text: before him are university brochures.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - KEITH
text: He looks at Cliff and the brochures. He's suspicious.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - CLIFF
text: He speaks without looking at Keith.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: I've been checking out colleges...
text: He looks up at Keith.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - KEITH
text: Plays it flat.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Aren't you a little too old for
dialog: college?
text: A thin smile breaks through.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - CLIFF
text: An incredulous stare. Incredulous that Keith can be so
text: cavalier about a subject that Cliff considers vital, press-
text: ing and overwhelmingly serious. There's no humor to his
text: retort.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 17
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: If I'd gone to college, I wouldn't
dialog: be selling tires six days a week.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - KEITH
text: He doesn't like hearing Cliff run himself down.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - CLIFF
text: A word of warning.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: If you don't get with the program,
dialog: you'll be selling tires, too.
dialog: (pause; lightens-
dialog: up)
dialog: You want to take a minute and look
dialog: at these brochures? A whole bunch
dialog: of new ones came in the mail today.
dialog: (sorts through
dialog: stack, finds one,
dialog: holds it up)
dialog: Take a look. Some of these are
dialog: real nice. Look at this, coed
dialog: physical education.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - KEITH
dialog: The last thing he wants to do.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Can I do it later?
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - CLIFF
dialog: He's been put off before.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: I'm not trying to break your
dialog: back, I just want you to get
dialog: off the dime and think about
dialog: your future.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - KEITH
text: He nods. He's heard it before.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - CLIFF
text: One last thought. What's really at the heart of the college
dialog: issue.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: You got a shot to be the first
dialog: guy in this family who didn't
dialog: have to wash his hands after a
dialog: day's work.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - KEITH
text: He knows. All too well. He shows his hands to Cliff.
text: Dirty. Motor dirt. Like Cliff said. He pushes off the
text: door arch and heads back into the foyer. He heads up the
text: stairs, side-stepping the debris piled on the stairs to
dialog: be carried up at anyone's convenience.
scene_heading: INT. KEITH'S BEDROOM
text: Keith opens the door and stops cold.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Keith's sister, LAURA, is sitting on the floor going through
text: his records. LP's are out of their sleeves. She's rudely
text: holding an LP, looking at the label.
text: Keith's room is a shrine to art. It's a serious shelter
text: from the outside world. One wall is covered, every inch,
text: with reproduction posters, art show posters, art postcards,
text: reproductions torn from books and magazines. A collage of
text: the history of art. A second wall is devoted to his own
text: sketches. A third wall is a trompe l'oeil of an endless
text: marble gallery. The fourth wall is hung with his own can-
text: vases. A stereo carefully put together out of discarded
text: pieces and parts. His bed is a mattress on the floor. A
text: chair direct from the dump. A rug from off a curb during
text: spring trash pick-up day. A desk made of an old door held
text: up by two oil drums. The surface is covered with sketches
text: and india ink pens and brushes, ink bottles. Clay and plas-
text: ter models and studies. Everywhere are found objects,
text: things intended for future pieces and studies. It is an
text: artist's studio in a boy's bedroom. There's no question
text: from his surroundings that he's serious about his talent.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I'm looking for that song about
dialog: the guy that killed himself for
dialog: the girl that hated his guts.
text: She looks up.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - KEITH

dialog: 19
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - LAURA
text: Disregards his anger.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Do you know which song I'm
dialog: talking about?
text: Keith takes the LP from Laura.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Do you understand the concept
dialog: of privacy?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Yes, I do. That's why I don't
dialog: let anyone in my room.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Get out of here before I throw
dialog: your ass out the window.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (outraged)
dialog: God, are you in a bad mood!
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Get outta here.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Is this a side effect of being
dialog: massively unliked or...?
text: Keith grabs Laura by the arm, rips her to her feet, walks
text: her to the door and shoves her out.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - LAURA
text: She's enraged.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: If I get a black and blue mark
dialog: you monger, you're dead!
text: The door slams on her. She screams at the top of her voice.
speaker_heading: LAURA (0.C.)
dialog: Mom!
speaker_heading: OMITTED

scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - LATER
text: The family are eating dinner. Laura is showing her upper
text: arm to Carol.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Look at it. You see what he did
dialog: to me?
text: Carol looks.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I don't see anything.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Then you need glasses. If I
dialog: wanted to sit out, I couldn't
dialog: wear a bathing suit.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Exposing your skin to sunlight
dialog: will make you old before your
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: (to Laura)
dialog: You stay out of his room.
dialog: (to Keith)
dialog: You got a problem with her, see
dialog: me before you rough her up.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: What right does she have to break
dialog: into my room? And I didn't rough
dialog: her up.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I have practically no feeling
text: left in the upper part of my arm.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: Drop it.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I wish just once you guys could
dialog: experience the humiliation of
dialog: having the weirdest guy ina
dialog: huge school be a blood relative.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Your father said, drop it.

dialog: I'll be upstairs.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You haven't finished your dinner.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Excuse me.
text: Keith gets up and exists. Cliff calls after him.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: What about these colleges, Keith?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I expect an answer.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Do you know what a total waste
dialog: of money it's going to be
dialog: letting him go to college?
dialog: He'll have this expensive
dialog: education that he'll never use
dialog: because all he wants to do is
dialog: make incredibly ugly art that
dialog: won't ever look good in anybody's
dialog: house.
text: Cliff, Carol and Cindy stare at her.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Am I wrong?
scene_heading: INT. KEITH'S ROOM
text: MUSIC'S PLAYING. He's sitting at his desk looking at a
text: tattered photo.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - PICTURE
text: A candid snapshot. Of a girl looking back over her shoul-
text: der. A caught expression on her face. A beautiful girl.
text: The girl we saw in the opening.

scene_heading: CLOSEUP - KEITH
text: A hint of a smile as he looks at his first strokes. The
text: SOURCE MUSIC PLAYING in the room is lost to a DRUM TRACK

scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL
text: A big, traditional high school.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT
text: A battered, wasted Mini with English drive whips into the
text: parking lot and flies into a parking spot narrowly missing
text: the shiny new imports on either side of the vacant spot.
text: DRUMS OUT ON A CYMBAL SPLASH.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - GROUND
text: The car door opens and a black patent-leather tie shoe,
text: covered with metal studs steps out of the car. We MOVE UP
text: FROM the shoes, PAST worn, torn jeans, a tank top, black
text: man's brocade vest, drum sticks shoved in a black leather
text: belt, red kid gloves and a cheap digital watch on a metal
text: stretch band shoved halfway up the arm to the girl we saw
text: in the opening. She's Watts, Drummer Girl. Big breathless
text: smile enjoying the rush of a near miss, the affirmation of
text: life that comes from a challenge to it. She takes off her
text: tiny red sunglasses and looks in the car.
speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL
dialog: Are you aware of how close that
dialog: was?
scene_heading: INT. CAR
text: Keith looks up at her. He's annoyed with her driving.
text: The answer to her question is on his face. He can't help
text: but smile at her exhilaration. He picks up his books off
text: the seat and gets out.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT
text: Keith gets out of the car. He has to squeeze out. Drummer

scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT
text: Hardy Jenns and a couple of his friends are hanging in the
text: parking lot. Leaning against a tricked-out Toyota truck.
text: MUSIC's coming from inside the truck. Hardy's bending the
text: radio antenna over. With his free hand, he's holding the
text: owner of the car away. His intention isn't to do damage,
text: only to harass his friend. The game is interrupted as
text: something catches Hardy's eye.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Drummer Girl and Keith heading into school.
scene_heading: HARDY AND HIS FRIENDS
text: Hardy lets the antenna go. He points out Keith and Drummer
text: Girl. Big derisive smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT
text: Drummer Girl and Keith head across the lot to the school.
text: They're unaware that they're being observed. She's fiddl-
text: ing with her drumsticks as she walks.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: You don't have any books?
speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL
dialog: Not on me.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: You never study, do you?
speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL
dialog: Not school stuff. My urge is to
dialog: make music. Tell me how reading
dialog: "Lord Of The Flies' '1l make me
dialog: a better drummer.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: You have no desire to get out of
dialog: this place?

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd like nothing better. I have
dialog: two feet. I'll get out. I'm not
dialog: worried. You must be getting
text: heat from the old man about
dialog: college again.
speaker_heading: KEITH
text: It's all he thinks about.
speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL
dialog: In comparative terms, it's
dialog: probably better to have an old
dialog: man nagging you about the future
dialog: than to have no old man not
dialog: nagging you about anything.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Things not too great at home?
speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL
dialog: The same.
text: The reach for the school doors. There's a crowd. Drummer
text: Girl taps out a little riff on the back pack of a kid
text: standing in front of her.
speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL
dialog: It doesn't matter. As long as
dialog: you stand by me, I'm covered.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Where would I be without you?
speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL
dialog: Seeing as how I drive you to
dialog: school every day, you'd probably
dialog: be sitting on your front porch.
text: The kid Drummer Girl is tapping on turns around. He's an
text: angry little freshman dead head. His name is Ray.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Do you mind?
speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL
dialog: Very much so.
text: Drummer Girl twirls her stick and gives the kid a pop on

scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY
text: Keith and Drummer Girl continue down a crowded hallway.
text: It's a corridor claimed by the headbangers. The angry
text: flotsam of the school loiters on the window ledges, lis-
text: tening to MUSIC, laying comatose, talking loudly, verbally
text: abusing anyone and everyone that passes. Including Keith.
text: His dark clothes, blank expression and boots make him ap-
text: pear at home in the corridor. But he's not immune to at-
dialog: tack.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Hey! Paint my picture!
speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL

scene_heading: CLOSEUP - KEITH
text: He stares at the kid. Doesn't give up anything.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: Keith steps over the obstruction. The Skinhead pulls his
text: leg in as Keith raises his leg and makes him highstep over
text: nothing. A laugh. Keith stares at the Skinhead.
speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL
dialog: That's real original. How long
dialog: you been pulling that one?
speaker_heading: SKINHEAD

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: A MALE TEACHER rudely shoves his way through the crowd.
text: He's assigned the security. Shirt-sleeves and tie and two-
text: way radio on his belt.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: That's enough!
text: He grabs Keith's shoulder and pushes him aside.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Clear out!

speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Now!

speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL
dialog: Wimp.
text: She follows after Keith. The teacher turns to Skinhead.
speaker_heading: SKINHEAD
dialog: I didn't do anything! He jumped
dialog: on me! Why don't you nail him?
text: The teacher flips a pack of Marlboro's out of Skinhead's
text: shirt pocket.
speaker_heading: SKINHEAD
dialog: It's not my shirt.
text: He reaches around behind and yanks a half pint out of his
text: hip pocket.
speaker_heading: SKINHEAD
dialog: That's just for show.

dialog: Drawing.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: The girl we saw in the opening and in the photograph, Amanda
text: Jones, is across the room and forward of Keith. A boy is
text: sitting at her table. His back is to Keith.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - KEITH
text: He's obviously very taken with her. Watching her every
text: move. He feels eyes upon him. An uneasiness comes over
text: him. His eyes shift quickly.
scene_heading: HIS POV - CLOSEUP ON HARDY
text: Hardy's turned in his seat, looking directly at Keith.
text: He's not pleased.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - KEITH
text: He's caught. He looks down to avoid the stare. A beat
text: and he looks up.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: We see that Hardy was the boy with his back to Keith.
text: He's turned around in his seat. Amanda looks from Hardy
dialog: to Keith.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - KEITH
text: Tries to convince himself that he's not intimidated. Looks
text: away. Another beat and he returns his look to Hardy.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - HARDY
text: He's still staring at Keith. He points to Keith, holds up
text: a pencil, points to Amanda, points to his neck, points to

speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL
dialog: Are you sitting down?
speaker_heading: KEITH
text: No. I'm standing in the hall.
speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL
dialog: Right. I have some bad news.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL
dialog: This is unconfirmed but I have
dialog: it from a reliable source.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL

speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: So there's nothing special we
dialog: need to know about filling out
dialog: the applications?
speaker_heading: MR. GALE
dialog: Just what we've covered.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: I don't mean to be a pain in the
dialog: butt about this, I just want to
dialog: double-check. You know kids
dialog: they wait until the last minute
dialog: on everything.
speaker_heading: MR. GALE
dialog: You have plenty of time. Has
dialog: Keith decided on a school yet?
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: We're zeroing in on a few.
speaker_heading: MR. GALE
dialog: He's indicated to me an interest
dialog: in a couple of art schools.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: I don't think that's going to
text: happen. He comes out of an art
dialog: school, what's he qualified to
dialog: do? I'm looking for a good
dialog: business program. I think he
dialog: has a good head for business.
speaker_heading: MR. GALE

speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: It's not supposed to be like

speaker_heading: AMANDA

speaker_heading: SHAYNE
dialog: (to Amanda)
dialog: Why don't you go with him?

speaker_heading: KEITH

speaker_heading: SHAYNE
dialog: Oh, really? You used him to

speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: It wasn't deliberate. It just

speaker_heading: SHAYNE
dialog: Regardless, the longer you wait

dialog: his house.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - SHAYNE AND AMANDA
text: Shayne is angry with Amanda. Amanda turns her look from

speaker_heading: AMANDA

dialog: (pause)
dialog: I don't know you all that well;

speaker_heading: KEITH

speaker_heading: HARDY

text: Keith shrugs. He's not so sure he'd recognize it.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: I have a lot of pride. And it's
dialog: been damaged, and I don't like
dialog: it. I can recover it, in my own
dialog: mind at least, by showing people
dialog: whose opinions matter to me that
dialog: you and I are friends. Then it's
dialog: not like you stole Amanda from
dialog: me. Bad blood makes me look like
dialog: a fool. If we're friends, it's
dialog: okay. I've traded off lots of
dialog: girls to friends. That's
dialog: acceptable. It's not acceptable
text: some stranger lifting Amanda off

speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: The logic's a little perverse.

speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL
dialog: He's a miser, huh?
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: No. It's just real important

speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL
dialog: He didn't go, huh?
text: Keith shakes his head, no.
speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL

scene_heading: INT. HOUSE

speaker_heading: CLIFF (0.C.)
dialog: Keith?
text: Keith issues a silent curse for being caught. He turns.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: Cliff's on the couch with the college brochures, a calcu-

text: Keith looks across at Cliff.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: Those treasury bills I said were

dialog: (big smile)
dialog: They're at 7%.
text: Keith holds his wince as Cliff hits a tender subject.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: That means, you're earning an

text: Keith manages a smile.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: That's great.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: You've got your first years money

scene_heading: CLOSEUP - KEITH
text: Looking at the picture. MUSIC COMES UP and CARRIES THROUGH

scene_heading: EXTREME CLOSEUP - SKETCH
text: FULL FRAME. Amanda's head is caught in a turn. Big smile.

text: FRAME, we see Drummer Girl slide out from behind a pillar.
text: She follows.
scene_heading: INT. WOMEN'S CLOTHING STORE
text: Shayne and Amanda are browsing the store. Drummer Girl
text: slips in the door. She crosses to the shoes and keeps tabs

scene_heading: CLOSEUP - CUSTOMER

scene_heading: CLOSEUP - DRUMMER GIRL

speaker_heading: HER POV
text: Amanda and Shayne are looking directly at her.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - DRUMMER GIRL

scene_heading: CLOSEUP - AMANDA AND SHAYNE

speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL

speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL

speaker_heading: DRUMMER GIRL

speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: It's insane. This makes no

speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: They're yours. For good. You

dialog: to do that again.
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: I never heard of anybody doing
dialog: anything like this.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: I'm sure it happens every day.
dialog: Not to everybody, but to the
dialog: ones who believe in themselves.
text: She bows her head. The tears start. She can't help her-
dialog: self. Every negative thought she's had about herself sur-
text: faces. Keith's purity, the scope of his sacrifice over-
text: whelms her.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Why are you crying?
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: I feel so terrible for what I
dialog: did. I hated the pressure, I

speaker_heading: KEITH

speaker_heading: THEIR POV
text: The front door opens. People are milling about. People

speaker_heading: KEITH AND AMANDA
text: They exchange looks. He holds up his hand. She claps it.
text: A smile both ways, and they head up to the house.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - DRUMMER GIRL
text: She closes the door and leans against the car. She rests
text: her chin on her hands and watches the house.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - HARDY
text: Word has reached him that he has a visitor. He gets up off

scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - AMANDA AND KEITH
text: They continue to the house. Keith's courage is waning.
text: Amanda squeezes his hand.

dialog: Welcome.

speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: (to Keith)
dialog: Have a good time?
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - AMANDA

scene_heading: CLOSEUP - HARDY
text: A wicked glint in his eye. He addresses Keith.
speaker_heading: HARDY

scene_heading: CLOSEUP - KEITH
text: Sharp internal reaction.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - AMANDA

dialog: If you leave, you don't come

dialog: Steven! What're you doing?
text: Keith steps forward as the room empties. The last strag-

speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: You want to forget about this?
dialog: At this point, there's no reason

scene_heading: CLOSEUP - KEITH
