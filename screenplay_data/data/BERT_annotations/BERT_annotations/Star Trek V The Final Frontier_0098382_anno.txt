scene_heading: 2 EXT. DRY LAKE BED - DAY
text: CAMERA PANS an arid expanse of scorched earth. J'ONN, a
text: ragged and malnourished homesteader of some alien race,
text: toils beneath a blazing sun, his BACK TO CAMERA. He
text: sinks an auguring device into the ground, drilling in
text: vain for water. There are many hundreds of holes in the
text: earth around him. He suddenly straightens and squints
text: into the dust storm as HOOFBEATS fill the SOUNDTRACK.
speaker_heading: 3 ANGLE
text: J'onn releases his auguring device and hurries toward
text: his rifle.
scene_heading: 4 J'ONN'S POV (INTERCUT - SLOW MOTION)
text: Horse and RIDER, dressed in a hooded cape, thunder
text: toward him.
text: 5 BACK TO SCENE
text: The CAMERA TILTS DOWN revealing J'onn's rifle as he
text: cocks the weapon.
text: He uses stones as ammunition, which slip from his hand
text: and fall to the parched ground as he tries to load the
text: rifle. He turns and points the gun as the Rider continues
text: his approach.
text: 6 J'onn raises his gun as the Rider reins his horse to a
text: halt ten feet short of him. The beast snorts and stamps
text: its hooves impatiently while the Rider studies the
text: frightened homesteader and removes a breathing apparatus
text: from his mouth. Finally, he speaks.
speaker_heading: RIDER
dialog: I thought weapons were forbidden
dialog: on this planet.
text: The Rider swings down from the saddle. He's tall,
text: powerfully built beneath his dusty robes, his face
text: shadowed by a hood. He indicates their bleak surroundings.
speaker_heading: RIDER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Besides, I can't believe you'd
dialog: kill me for a field of empty holes.
speaker_heading: J'ONN
dialog: (pathetic)
dialog: It's all I have.
text: J'onn sags under the futile weight of existence. The
text: Rider approaches him without fear. It's all the homesteader
dialog: can do to keep from sobbing.
speaker_heading: RIDER
dialog: Your pain runs deep.
speaker_heading: J'ONN
dialog: (sobbing)
dialog: What do you know of my pain?
speaker_heading: RIDER
dialog: Let us explore it together.
text: The Rider collects himself and concentrates deeply. J'onn
text: is immediately transfixed. He begins to tremble. Tears
text: flood his dirty cheeks.
speaker_heading: RIDER
dialog: (continuing; soothing tone)
text: Each man hides a secret pain. It
dialog: must be exposed and reckoned with.
dialog: It must be dragged from darkness
dialog: and forced into the light. Share
dialog: your pain. Share your pain with
dialog: me and gain strength from the
dialog: sharing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 6 CONTINUED :
text: J'onn whimpers and cries out in anguish. Finally, the
text: catharsis ends. J'onn sobs and rests his head on the
text: Rider's chest. He opens his eyes and blinks in wonder
text: and amazement at the Rider as he comforts J'onn.
speaker_heading: J'ONN
dialog: (as if reborn)
dialog: Where did you get this power?
speaker_heading: RIDER
dialog: The power was within you.
speaker_heading: J'ONN
dialog: (trying to find the words)
dialog: I feel as if a weight has been
dialog: lifted from my heart. How can I
dialog: repay you for this miracle?
speaker_heading: RIDER
dialog: Join my quest.
speaker_heading: J'ONN
dialog: What is it you seek?
speaker_heading: RIDER
dialog: What you seek. What all men have
dialog: sought since time began - ultimate
dialog: knowledge. But to find it we'll
dialog: need a starship.
speaker_heading: J'ONN
dialog: A starship? There are no starships
dialog: on Nimbus III.
speaker_heading: RIDER
dialog: Perhaps I have a way to bring one
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: J'ONN
dialog: But how?
speaker_heading: RIDER
dialog: Have faith, my friend. There are
dialog: more of us than you know.
scene_heading: 7 CLOSE ON RIDER
text: As he throws back his hood to reveal rugged charismatic
text: features. He's bearded, his hair is shaggy. He has

text: pointed ears. His name is SYBOK.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 7 CONTINUED
speaker_heading: J'ONN (O.S.)
dialog: You're a Vulcan.
text: Sybock nods and does something we've never seen a Vulcan

scene_heading: TITLES CONTINUE OVER

text: CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK eight
text: hundred feet above the surrounding forest. He climbs up
text: the face of El Captain without ropes, grommets or equipment.
text: Just man against mountain. Using the cracks in the
text: rockface for hand and foot holes, Jim Kirk struggles up
text: the treacherous incline, one painful inch at a time. We

speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (muttering toward the mountain)
dialog: "You'll have a great time Bones,
dialog: You'll enjoy your shore leave.
dialog: You'll be able to relax."
dialog: (lowering binoculars)
dialog: You call this relaxing? I'm a

dialog: If I'm not careful, I'll end up

scene_heading: 13 EL CAPITAN - KIRK
text: He inserts the pads of two fingers into a narrow crack
text: above his head. He exhales, focussing concentration.
text: Kirk pulls himself up, balancing on a ledge barely an
text: inch wide. Exhilarated, he pauses to admire the view.
speaker_heading: 14 KIRK'S POV
text: A breathtaking but vertigo-inducing HIGH ANGLE SHOT of
dialog: Yosemite. This may be the 23rd Century but the park
text: looks the same as it did three hundred years ago.
text: There is a soft WHOOSHING SOUND and SPOCK suddenly rises
scene_heading: INTO FRAME.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Greetings, Captain.
speaker_heading: 15 WIDE SHOT
text: Spock hovers in mid- air alongside the startled Kirk, kept
text: aloft by means of levitation boots. His hands are clasped
text: behind his back, typically Spock-like.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (he gasps)
dialog: Spock - What are you doing in
dialog: this neck of the woods?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I'm flattered. Twelve hundred
dialog: points of interest in Yosemite and
dialog: you pick me.
text: Spock doesn't take Kirk's hint to get lost.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I regret to inform you that the
dialog: record for free-climbing El Captain
text: is in no danger of being broken.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (as he climbs)
dialog: I'm not trying to break any records.
dialog: I'm doing this because I enjoy it.
dialog: Not to mention the most important
dialog: reason for climbing a mountain...
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: And that is?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: Because it's there.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Ah, Captain?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: MM.?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I do not think you realize the
dialog: gravity of your situation.
text: Kirk slips but manages to gain a handhold and save himself.
text: Beneath his feet, a mini-avalanche of rocks is dislodged,
text: tumbling to the valley below.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (glaring at Spock)
dialog: On the contrary. Gravity is foremost
dialog: on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make
dialog: an ascent here. Why don't you go
dialog: pester Dr McCoy for a while?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I believe Dr McCoy is not in
dialog: the best of moods.
scene_heading: 16 CAMPSITE BELOW
text: McCoy, still watching Kirk's progress, is getting angrier
dialog: by the second.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (grumbling)
dialog: Goddamn..irresponsible...
dialog: playing games with life...
scene_heading: 17 EL CAPITAN - KIRK AND SPOCK
text: Kirk strains for the next handhold.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Concentration is vital. You must
dialog: be one with the rock.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Spock, I appreciate your concern,
dialog: but if you don't stop distracting
dialog: me, I'm liable to be one...
text: And as Kirk reaches for the next crack, the ledge comes
text: loose underfoot and he finds himself falling.
speaker_heading: 18 ANGLE - SPOCK
text: He dives after Kirk, firing boosters to increase his
dialog: speed.
scene_heading: 19 ANGLE - KIRK
text: Twisting and turning end over end as he hurtles downward.
text: He thrashes at the air, unable to defeat gravity.
speaker_heading: 20 CAMPSITE
text: McCoy turns away, unable to look.
dialog: McCoy
dialog: Oh, my God!
scene_heading: 21 ANGLE - KIRK
text: Dropping...dropping..the ground rushing up like a
text: hungry mouth. A split second before impact...
speaker_heading: 22 ANGLE - SPOCK
text: The Vulcan swoops INTO SHOT. His powerful fingers grab
text: Kirk by the ankle and jerk him upward in the nick of time
speaker_heading: 23 CAMPSITE
text: McCoy hasn't heard the expected splat. He turns to look
dialog: and what he sees is:
speaker_heading: 24 WIDE SHOT
text: Kirk is suspended in air, bobbing upside-down at the
text: end of Spock's arm.
scene_heading: 25 CLOSER KIRK AND SPOCK
text: The top of Kirk's head is practically touching the
dialog: ground. That's how close he came to being pizza. Kirk
text: blinks in disbelief.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh, God
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Perhaps "because it is there" is
dialog: not sufficient reason for climbing
text: a mountain.
text: Kirk dangles - undignified but lucky to be alive.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I'm hardly in a position to disagree.
text: McCoy is heard in approach.
speaker_heading: 26 KIRK'S POV
text: McCoy is seen upside-down.

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Hello, Bones. Mind if we drop in

scene_heading: 27 EXT. DESERT OUTPOST - DAY
text: The single outpost of civilization on this desolate world

speaker_heading: SUPERIMPOSE :
scene_heading: "PARADISE CITY - NIMBUS III"
scene_heading: INT. SALOON - DAY
text: A 23rd Century equivalent of a frontier saloon. Futuristic
text: honky-tonk MUSIC. The patrons are rugged, unpleasant types.
dialog: Klingons, Romulans, Andorians, you name it. Much drink
text: and boisterous talk. Arguments. Fistfights. Two men
text: play futuristic "pool" on a table filled with water.
scene_heading: 29 A SEXY CATWOMAN
text: Dances atop of the bar, flicking her long striped tail and

scene_heading: 30 ANGLE ON SALOON DOOR
text: A STRANGER coming from outside approaches familiar

dialog: you'd expect, they WHOOSH apart automatically. The

dialog: into place.
speaker_heading: 31 WIDE SHOT
text: Talk and noise go dead as the entire saloon turns its
text: attention to the newcomer. The stranger, seen only from
text: the back, steps into the squalid bar. The Bartender jerks
text: his thumb in the direction of the back room. The stranger
text: crosses to the back room and disappears inside. Talk and
text: noise resume.
text: A VEIWSCREEN is revealed b.g. As the cloaked stranger
text: passes through the room toward the back, we hear:
scene_heading: TELEVISION ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
dialog: ...your dream can become a reality...

scene_heading: INT. BACK ROOM
text: The stranger lowers the breathing device from her face
text: and is revealed to be a young woman. A Romulan. Her
text: name is CAITHLIN DAR and she stands on the threshold of
text: the room, trying to adjust her eyes to the murky
text: surroundings. She's a little nervous and a long way
dialog: from home.
text: The back room is a storage area for unwanted odds and
text: ends. A ceiling fan swishes overhead pushing hot air
text: around. Two men are sprawled in chairs at opposite ends
text: of a table. They're two busy drinking to notice
text: Caithlin's entrance.
speaker_heading: CAITHLIN
dialog: Gentlemen, I'm Caithlin Dar.
text: The man seated closest to Caithlin slowly swivels his head
text: in her direction. He wearily extracts himself from his
text: chair and comes forward. He's a Terran (specifically,
text: an Englishman) named ST. JOHN TALBOT. Thin and dissipated,
text: alcoholic, Talbot is a veteran of the diplomatic corps. He
text: pats down his unruly hair and straightens his soiled suit.
text: He gives Caithlin a tired smile and extends a limp hand.
speaker_heading: TALBOT
dialog: Ah, yes. Our new Romulan
dialog: representative.
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Welcome to Paradise City, my
dialog: dear, capital of the so-called
dialog: "Planet of Galactic Peace." I'm
dialog: St John Talbot, the Federation
dialog: representative here on Nimbus III.
dialog: My charming companion here is the
dialog: Klingon consul, Korrd...
text: Caithlin regards the hulking figure at the other end of
text: the table. KORRD is an old, overweight Klingon, a
text: once-great warrior past his prime. He doesn't rise
text: to greet Caithlin. Instead, he takes a swig from a
text: flagon and emits an earth-shaking belch.
speaker_heading: CAITHLIN
dialog: I expect that's Klingon for hello.
speaker_heading: TALBOT
dialog: Won't you come in, my dear?
scene_heading: 33 EXT. PARADISE CITY

dialog: every different race, the poor and the downtrodden - united
dialog: in their devotion to Sybok.
scene_heading: 34 INT. BACK ROOM - SALOON
speaker_heading: CAITHLIN
dialog: Twenty years ago, our three

text: Korrd pours a drink from a bottle into his cup.
speaker_heading: KORRD
dialog: Hmmm...
speaker_heading: CAITHLIN
dialog: A new age was born.
speaker_heading: TALBOT
dialog: Our new age has died a quick death.
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: And the settlers we conned into
dialog: coming here - they were the dregs
dialog: of the galaxy. They immediately
dialog: took to fighting amongst themselves.
dialog: We forbade them weapons and they
dialog: soon began to fashion their own.
speaker_heading: CAITHLIN
dialog: Well then, it appears I've arrived
text: just in time.
text: Korrd looks confused.
speaker_heading: KORRD

speaker_heading: KLAXON.
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE CITY
text: A handful of sentries brace themselves against the gate.
text: It suddenly gives way. CAMERA CRANES UP OVER the top of
text: the arch to reveal Sybok's army on the threshold of the
text: city. In their midst, towering majestically above them,
text: is Sybok on horseback. He urges his mount forward. With
text: quiet determination, he and his army pour under the arch
text: and proceed up the main drag.
text: Townspeople scurry for protection, anticipating an attack.
text: Those who consider challenging Sybok are allayed by the
text: crude weapons and intimidating looks of the followers.
text: Sybok intends to take this town by show of force without
text: having to fire a shot. And it looks like he'll succeed.
scene_heading: 36 EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SALOON
text: Korrd, Caithlin and Talbot emerge to see what the hubbub
text: is about. When they see the approaching forces, Korrd
text: and Talbot immediately turn tail and run back inside.
text: After a moment, Caithlin follows.
scene_heading: 37 INT. SALOON
text: Korrd, fearing the worst, goes behind the bar and opens
text: a bottle. He upends it and pours the contents down his
text: throat. He prefers to die drunk.
text: Talbot and Caithlin hurry to the viewscreen. Talbot
text: moves to turn off the program being broadcast.
scene_heading: TELEVISION ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
dialog: ....we have spared no expense to

speaker_heading: J'ONN
dialog: Get away from that transmitter!
text: Korrd lifts his drink. J'onn grabs him; Korrd pushes back.
text: CAMERA PANS to reveal two armed soldiers who grab Korrd and

speaker_heading: SYBOK

speaker_heading: CAITHLIN

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (drinks from up)
dialog: Ahhh.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: You know, you two could drive a
dialog: man to drink.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (innocent)
dialog: What did I do?
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: What did you do? You really piss
dialog: me off, Jim. Human life is far too
dialog: precious to risk crazy stunts.
dialog: Maybe it didn't cross that macho
dialog: mind of yours, but you should've
dialog: been killed when you fell off that
dialog: mountain.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: It crossed my mind.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: And, even as I fell, I knew I
dialog: wouldn't die.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (nodding at Spock)
dialog: Oh? I thought he was the only one
dialog: who's immortal.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I
dialog: wouldn't die because the two of
dialog: you were with me.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (darkly)
dialog: I've always known... I'll die alone.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (frowning)
dialog: Well, I'll call Valhalla and have
dialog: them reserve a room for you.
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: It's a mystery to me what draws us
dialog: together. All that time in space
text: - getting on each other's nerves.
dialog: And what do we do when shore leave
dialog: comes along?
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: We spend it together. Other people
dialog: have families.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (wistful)
dialog: Other people, Bones. Not us.
text: They dwell on this thought for a moment. Then, Kirk
text: notices that Spock has removed a sack from his backpack.
text: Spock reaches into the sack and takes out a marshmallow
text: which he attaches to the end of a pointed stick.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I am preparing to toast a marsh
dialog: melon.
text: Marsh melon? Kirk and McCoy hide their smiles as Spock
text: holds the marshmallow over the fire.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Well, I'll be damned. A marsh
dialog: melon. Where'd you learn to do
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Before leaving the ship, I consulted
dialog: the computer library to familiarize
dialog: myself with the customs associated
dialog: with "camping out."
text: Kirk and McCoy play along, amused by Spock's dead serious
dialog: approach to frivolity.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Well, tell me, Spock. What do you
dialog: do after we toast the marsh - er,
dialog: marsh melons?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: We consume them.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: I know we consume them. I mean
dialog: after that.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Oh. I believe we are required to
dialog: engage in a ritual known as the
dialog: singalong.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: That's great. I haven't sung around
dialog: a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa.
dialog: What are we going to sing? What...
dialog: Bones, what are we going to sing?
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: How about "Camptown Races?"
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: "Pack Up Your Troubles."
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Are we leaving, Captain?
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: It's a song title, Spock.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: "Moon Over Rigel Seven?"
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (sings)
dialog: "Row, row, row your boat..."
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: "Row, row, row your boat..." I
dialog: love "Row..."
dialog: (to Spock)
dialog: Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row,
dialog: Row, Row Your Boat?"
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: That song did not come up in my
dialog: research, Captain.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: The lyrics are - are very simple.
dialog: It's, er, "Row, row, row your boat,
text: gently down the stream. Merrily,
text: merrily, merrily, merrily, life is
dialog: but a dream.." The Doctor and I will
dialog: start it off, and then when we give
dialog: you the signal, you jump in.
dialog: (to McCoy)
dialog: Doctor, if you please.
text: McCoy takes a hit of booze and clears his throat.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Don't say I didn't warn you.
text: McCoy starts to sing. Kirk joins in. Maybe it's the
text: bourbon, but the two of them sound pretty good.
speaker_heading: KIRK AND McCOY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: "Row, row, row your boat, gently
text: down the stream... merrily,
text: merrily, merrily, merrily, life
dialog: is but a dream..."
text: They signal Spock that it is his turn to jump in but the
text: Vulcan merely regards them quizzically. The singalong
text: grinds to a halt.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (sings)
dialog: ...life...
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Come on, Spock. Why didn't you
dialog: jump in?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I was trying to comprehend the
dialog: meaning of the words.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (loosing patience)
dialog: It's a song, you green-blooded
dialog: Vulcan. You sing it. The words
dialog: aren't important. What's important
dialog: is that you have a good time
dialog: singing it.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (sincere)
dialog: Oh. I am sorry, Doctor. Were we
dialog: having a good time?
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (giving up)
dialog: God, I liked him better before he
dialog: died.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: All right, all right, let's call
dialog: it a night, will ya?
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (overlapping)

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Let's go to bed and just let's

speaker_heading: SPOCK

dialog: Captain?
speaker_heading: KIRK

speaker_heading: SPOCK

speaker_heading: KIRK

scene_heading: 48 EXT. SPACE
text: The probe tumbles through space as the Bird of Prey swoops
text: down for the attack. Machine gun-like phasers are mounted
text: on the Bird's wings. They come to life and swivel,
text: BLASTING a flange off the front of the probe. A SECOND

scene_heading: 49 INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Why didn't you beep my

speaker_heading: UHURA

scene_heading: 51 EXT. EL CAPITAN - NIGHT

speaker_heading: KIRK

dialog: Forbidden?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: He rejected his logical upbringing

dialog: of our ancestors.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: He believed the key to self-knowledge

speaker_heading: McCOY

speaker_heading: SPOCK

speaker_heading: SPOCK

speaker_heading: KIRK

speaker_heading: 86 THIER POV

speaker_heading: BLACK SOLDIER
dialog: What is that?

scene_heading: 90 ANGLE - KIRK AND SPOCK

scene_heading: 94 ANGLE - THE HORSEMEN

speaker_heading: SPOCK

speaker_heading: 97 ANGLE - SULU
text: Sulu spears his horse and charges at the spotlight as
text: pebbles fired from the enemy's crude weapons whiz around
text: him like hungry hornets. He gallops toward the blinding
text: light. A BAZOOKA SHELL EXPLODES near him and he is
text: knocked from his mount, but manages to roll away toward
text: the spotlight and rises up to his knees. He raises his
text: phaser and with an expert shot, blows the spotlight to
text: bits as J'onn holds it. The street goes dark, lit now

speaker_heading: 101 LOW ANGLE
text: The soldiers on the walls and rooftops open fire with

scene_heading: 102 A BLINDING EXPLOSION
scene_heading: 103 ANGLE - KIRK
text: A soldier grabs Kirk; they struggle. Kirk flips him

speaker_heading: 104 ANGLE - SPOCK
text: The Vulcan dismounts. As he heads for the saloon AN
text: ENEMY SOLDIER leaps from a balcony, landing squarely in

text: Soldier urges the steed forward to trample Spock. As Spock
text: turns in response, the Soldier rears the horse up on its
text: hind legs. Hooves threaten to pummel Spock to a hamburger.
text: Spock calmly reaches up and presses his fingers into the
text: horse's neck, executing a Vulcan nerve pinch. The horse

speaker_heading: 108 ANGLE - KIRK
text: Kirk shoots his phaser toward the lights of the building

scene_heading: 109 INT. SALOON
text: Dark and empty. Phaser drawn, Kirk cautiously makes his

dialog: Spock. It's me. It's Sybok.
dialog: After all these years, you've

dialog: Don't you have anything to say

text: from Spock. But Spock refuses to fall into his trap.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: You are under arrest for seventeen
dialog: violations of the Neutral Zone
dialog: Treaty.
text: Sybok is incredulous. There must be a hundred guns pointed
text: at Spock's heart. Sybok can't help it. He chuckles.
text: The chuckle becomes a full rich laugh. The soldiers join
text: in and soon their laughter is ringing through Paradise.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: Spock, you've developed a sense
dialog: of humor after all.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: It was not my intention to amuse
dialog: you. These are serious charges.
dialog: However, if you surrender now-
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: I'm sorry, Spock. I can't
dialog: surrender now. I'm not through
dialog: violating Neutral Zone Treaty.
dialog: In fact, I'm just getting started.
dialog: And now for my next violation I intend
dialog: to steal something. Something
dialog: very big.

scene_heading: 149 ANGLE - KIRK AND SYBOK

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (in pain)
dialog: Spock... pick it up!

speaker_heading: KIRK

speaker_heading: SPOCK

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I ordered you to defend this ship.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: You ordered me to kill my brother.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Look, the man may be a fellow

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: You mean he's your brother brother?
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: You made that up!
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I did not.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: You did too. Sybok couldn't
dialog: possibly be your brother because
dialog: I happen to know for a fact that
dialog: you don't have a brother.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Technically, you are correct. I
dialog: do not have a brother.
speaker_heading: KIRK

speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I have a half brother.
speaker_heading: KIRK

speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Let me get this straight. You and

speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's
dialog: mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon
dialog: her death, Sybok and I were raised
dialog: as brothers.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Why didn't you tell me this before?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I was not disposed to discuss...
dialog: matters of a personal nature. For
dialog: that, I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (still fuming)
dialog: He's sorry, See, he's sorry.
dialog: Everything... that makes everything
dialog: all right. He's sorry, everything's...
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Stop it, Jim. Spock could no more
dialog: kill his own brother than he could
dialog: kill you. If you want to punish
dialog: him for what he's done, why don't
dialog: you throw him in the brig?

dialog: is.. unpronounceable. Still, every
dialog: culture shares he common
dialog: dream of a place from which creation
dialog: sprang. For us, that place will
dialog: soon be a reality.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: The only realty I see is that I'm
dialog: a prisoner on my own ship. What is
dialog: this power you have to control the
dialog: minds of my crew?
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: I don't control minds. I free
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: By making you face your pain and
dialog: draw strength from it. Once
dialog: that's done, fear cannot stop
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Sounds like brainwashing to me.
text: Sybok closes his eyes and concentrates deeply.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: (to McCoy; sensing)
dialog: Your pain is the deepest of all.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: I can feel it. Can't you?
text: A city skyline materializes in the background.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: (a whisper in pain)
dialog: Leonard...
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: It's some kind of trick.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: (imploring)
dialog: Leonard...
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (as he recognizes
dialog: the voice)
dialog: Father?
text: The surrounding walls come alive with energy. What
text: follows is theatrical in style as we enter a subjective
dialog: world.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (continuing; frightened)
dialog: Oh my God, don't do this to me.
scene_heading: 181 ANGLE - McCOY
text: He turns to find himself in a brilliantly white, sterile
text: hospital room. A wasted figure reclines in a bed, an
text: old man connected to a powerful life-support system.
dialog: This is McCOY'S FATHER and we are somewhere in the past.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (barely audible)
dialog: Leonard...
text: McCoy rushes to the bedside.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: I'm here. I'm with you, Dad.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: The pain... stop the pain.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: I've done everything I can do.
dialog: You've got to hang on.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: I can't stand the pain. Help me.
text: In the near background Sybok watches with Kirk and Spock.
text: They are entranced by what they're seeing.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: All my knowledge and I can't
dialog: save him.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: (the voice of
dialog: conscience)
dialog: You've done all you can. The
dialog: support system will keep him alive.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (flaring)
dialog: You call this alive?
text: Father whispers something. McCoy bends down and puts his
text: ear next to the old man's parched lips.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Son, release me...
text: McCoy looks into his Father's eyes. The old man's gaze
text: travels to the support machinery. He wants McCoy to
dialog: shut it off.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (recoiling)
dialog: I can't do that, Dad.
dialog: (in agony)
dialog: But how - how can I watch him
dialog: suffer like this?
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: You're a doctor.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (defiant)
dialog: I'm his son!
text: McCoy reaches his decision. He shuts off the machine.
text: The Father dies in his son's arms. Sybok appears at
text: McCoy's side.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: Why did you do it?
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: To preserve his dignity.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: That wasn't the worst of it.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: Was it?
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: Share it.
text: McCoy hesitates, trembling. This is his dark secret.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Not long after... they found a
dialog: cure. A goddamn cure!
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: So if you hadn't killed him he
dialog: might have lived.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (breaking down)
dialog: No! I loved my father. I
dialog: released him.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: Then you did what you thought
dialog: was right.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Yes. No! Yes!
text: Sybok holds McCoy. The CAMERA PUSHES IN as they hold
dialog: each other.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: Release this pain.. Release it.
dialog: This pain has poisoned your soul
dialog: for a long time.
text: Kirk and Spock look at each other with concern.
text: McCoy weeps for several moments, then wipes the tears
text: away. He looks up at Sybok's comforting smile and is
text: filled with a deep sense of relief.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Now you've taken the first step.
dialog: The other steps we'll take together.
text: McCoy nods. Sybok turns to Spock.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Each man's pain is unique.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I hide no pain.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: I know you better than that.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (challenging)
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Spock... don't.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: It's all right, Captain.
dialog: (to Sybok)
dialog: Proceed.
text: O.S. a woman screams in agony.
scene_heading: 182 ANGLE - KIRK AND SPOCK
text: They turn and find themselves beneath the hanging
text: stalactites of a cave. Torchlight throws weird shadows
text: on the walls. The shadows depict a woman in labor,
text: attended by a Vulcan High Priestess. Ceremonial DRUMS
text: pound a throbbing pulse. The woman lets out another
text: scream. It reverberates throughout the cavern.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I believe we are witnessing my
dialog: birth.
text: Sybok appears beside them. He leads Spock and Kirk into
dialog: the past.
scene_heading: 183 ANGLE - AS THEY APPROACH
text: Spock's mother, the young earthwoman AMANDA, lies on a
text: rough pallet, her legs spread beneath her robes, her
text: distended stomach lifting. Her only attendant is THE
text: HIGH PRIESTESS who intones the Vulcan birthrights.
text: Spock watches.
text: A figure steps from the shadows. It is SAREK, Spock's
text: Vulcan father. He observes his wife with typical
dialog: detachment.
text: As the DRUMS build in intensity, Amanda begins to
dialog: deliver.
scene_heading: 184 ANGLE - CAVERN WALL
text: The birth takes place in shadow. DRUMS reach a climax
text: and stop. An infant cries. Amanda lifts the mewling
text: babe from between her legs.
speaker_heading: 185 SPOCK
text: Watching his entry into the world.
speaker_heading: 186 HIGH PRIESTESS
text: She takes the baby from Amanda and holds it up. The
text: tiny infant kicks and cries. Amanda reaches out for
text: her child but the Priestess turns and presents the
text: crying baby to Sarek instead.
speaker_heading: SAREK
dialog: (without joy)
dialog: So human.
scene_heading: 187 ANGLE - FORWARD OBSERVATION ROOM
text: Spock turns away from Sybok and the others.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Spock...
dialog: (when he doesn't
dialog: reply, to Sybok)
dialog: What have you done to my friends?
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: I've done nothing. This is who
dialog: they are. Didn't you know that?
text: The question hits Kirk with force.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: No... I didn't.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: Now learn something about
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No. I refuse.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (imploring)
dialog: Jim, try to be open about this.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: About what? That I've made the
dialog: wrong choices in my life? That I
dialog: turned left when I should've turned
dialog: right? I know what my weaknesses
dialog: are. I don't need Sybok to take me
text: on a tour of them.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: If you'd just unbend and allow
dialog: yourself -
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: And be brainwashed by this con man?
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: I was wrong. This "con man" took
dialog: away my pain.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Damnit, Bones, you're a doctor.
dialog: You know that pain and guilt can't
text: be taken away with a wave of a
dialog: magic wand. They're things we carry
dialog: with us - the things that make us
dialog: who we are. If we lost them, we
dialog: lose ourselves. I don't want my
dialog: pain taken away. I need my pain.
text: A tense silence, broken by...
speaker_heading: UHURA'S VOICE
dialog: Sybok, this is the bridge. We're
text: in approach of the Great Barrier.
text: Sybok is filled with excitement, eager to go to the
dialog: bridge.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: Captain, I'm afraid you'll have
dialog: to remain here. Spock. Dr. McCoy...
dialog: Come with me.
text: Sybok and McCoy start for the exit but stop when they
text: realize that Spock is remaining with Kirk.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: Spock?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I cannot go with you.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: (can't believe it)
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I belong here.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: I don't understand...
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Sybok, you are my brother, but
dialog: you do not know me. I am not the
dialog: outcast boy you left behind those
dialog: many years ago. Since that time
dialog: I have found myself and my place.
dialog: I know who I am. And I cannot go
dialog: with you.
text: McCoy reacts to this speech. After a moment, he takes
text: his place with Kirk and Spock.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: I guess you better count me out,
dialog: too.
text: Beyond the great windows, space is hanging, reflecting
dialog: this unique part of the galaxy.
text: Sybok regards Kirk, Spock and McCoy with affection. This
text: is only a temporary setback. He knows the ultimate win
dialog: will be his.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: Then I'll see you on the other
dialog: side.
text: Sybok heads for the exit. Doors WHOOSH open to reveal
text: the guards outside.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Wait!
dialog: (Sybok turns)
dialog: You know we'll never make it
dialog: through the Great Barrier.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: But if we do, will that convince
dialog: you that my vision was true?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Your vision?
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: Given to me by God.
dialog: (as the others
dialog: react)
text: He waits for us on the other side.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: You are mad!
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: Am I? We'll see.
text: The fiery look in Sybok's eyes might be confidence, it
text: might be madness. He turns and exits.
speaker_heading: CUT TO :
scene_heading: 188 EXT. SPACE - THE GREAT BARRIER
text: Enterprise is poised on the edge of the giant star
text: cluster known as the Great Barrier. It is visually
text: stunning and equally dangerous. We see giant regions of
text: star formations as well as expanding blast waves from
text: exploding stars. Beams of radiation from pulsars sweep
text: the tiny and insignificant ship, bathing her in color.
scene_heading: 189 INT. BRIDGE - ANGLE TO INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN
text: Sybok is on the bridge. Uhura, Chekov and Sulu are at
text: their stations. Caithlin, Korrd and Talbot are also
text: present. They and the rest of the crew are transfixed
text: by the viewscreen, awed by the vista of a sky filled
text: with thousands of stars, each a fiery orange.
dialog: But what really draws their attention is the black
text: thundercloud looming directly ahead. Here starts the
text: ring of gas and dust that enshrouds the center of the
text: galaxy, hiding it from view. Behind this black veil
dialog: is a region that emits ten times more energy than our
text: sun. Through the chinks in the wall we see flashes of
text: blue light - hints of the fires blazing within.
text: The hip's monitor screen goes blank.
speaker_heading: SULU
dialog: They say no ship can survive this.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: I say they're wrong. I say the
text: danger is an illusion.
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: We have no instrument readings.
dialog: Is it there or isn't it?
speaker_heading: SYBOK
text: Mr. Sulu... full ahead.
speaker_heading: SULU
dialog: Full ahead, aye.
scene_heading: 190 EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - ENTERPRISE
text: And with that, the ship plows into the Barrier, straight
text: into the dark clouds, disappearing from sight. We HOLD
text: for a terrifying moment, wondering if we'll ever see
text: Enterprise again.
scene_heading: 191 INT. FORWARD OBSERVATION ROOM
text: Kirk, Spock and McCoy experience a rush of elation.
text: They gaze through the window at an incredible spacescape,
text: unable to deny the sensation stirring within them.
dialog: Sybok was right.
scene_heading: 192 ANGLE - INSIDE THE BARRIER
text: Surprisingly, there is no turbulence, no buffeting.
text: The Enterprise travels through a fantastic passageway
text: of light and color. Then, quite suddenly, the gas
text: clouds part and the ship enters a region of incredible
text: calm and serenity, like the clear space at the eye of
dialog: a hurricane.
scene_heading: 193 INT. BRIDGE
text: Sybok rises and looks in awe at the Great Barrier.
scene_heading: 194 EXT. SPACE
text: Dead ahead, a single planet. A planet of great beauty
dialog: and peace. Our final destination.
scene_heading: 195 INT. BRIDGE
text: Sybok smiles and glances around. Talbot stands in
text: awe of the sight before him. CAMERA PUSHES IN on
text: Caithlin's happy face.
scene_heading: 196 EXT. SPACE
text: CAMERA PUSHES IN toward Sha Ka Ree.
speaker_heading: KIRK'S VOICE
dialog: Is it possible?
scene_heading: 197 INT. FORWARD OBSERVATION ROOM
speaker_heading: SPOCK
text: Fascinating.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Are we dreaming?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: If we are, then life is a dream.
text: Kirk, fascinated by the planet, moves to the antique
text: ship's wheel. He absentmindedly rests his hand on it.
text: His eyes are drawn to the plaque attached to the spokes
text: of the wheel. On it, the charter of the Enterprise has
text: been set in bronze. CAMERA MOVES IN on these words:
text: "TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE"
scene_heading: 198 INT. BRIDGE - ANGLE TO INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN
text: The bridge buzzes with excitement. Monitor screens
dialog: come to life.
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
text: Instruments are back on line.
text: Incredible. There's a power scource
text: emanating form the planet like
dialog: nothing I've ever seen.
text: On the viewscreen, the planet appears up close - a
text: celestial orb, cloaked by swirling white clouds.
text: QUICK SHOTS of awed reactions:
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: Sha Ka Ree.
speaker_heading: KORRD
dialog: Qui'Tu.
speaker_heading: CAITHLIN
dialog: Vorta Vor.
speaker_heading: TALBOT
dialog: Eden.
speaker_heading: 199 ANGLE
text: The bridge doors WHOOSH open to reveal Kirk, Spock and
text: McCoy. The others turn, fearful of what he'll say or do. A
text: tense moment.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (to Sybok)
dialog: About the ship...
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: (encouraging)
dialog: The ship needs its Captain.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No special conditions?
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: (happily)
dialog: No conditions.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: What makes you think I won't turn
dialog: us around?
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: Because you, too, must know.
text: Kirk looks at the hopeful faces around him. He feels
text: the excitement of being on the verge of a great frontier,
dialog: perhaps the greatest frontier.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Well, if we're going to do it...
dialog: (with conviction)
dialog: ... we're going to do by the
dialog: book. Mr. Chekov, you take the
dialog: con. Mr. Sulu, standard orbital
dialog: approach. Uhura, alert the
text: shuttlecraft to stand by. Sybok,
dialog: Spock, Dr. McCoy - come with me.
dialog: The rest of you remain on board
dialog: until I determine what we're
dialog: dealing with.
text: Kirk's eyes flash with excitement. To Sybok:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (continuing; with
dialog: a smile.)
dialog: Well, don't just stand there.
dialog: God's a busy man.
text: Sybok happily joins them in the turbolift.
speaker_heading: CUT TO :
scene_heading: 200 EXT. ENTERPRISE
text: Bay doors open. Copernicus, the shuttle backup, emerges
text: and drops from the mothership. Thrusters fire as it
text: streaks toward the planet, disappearing into the swirling
text: white clouds.
scene_heading: 201 INT. COPERNICUS
text: Spock pilots the craft. He, McCoy and Kirk have changed
text: into Starfleet uniforms.
scene_heading: 202 THROUGH WINDSHEILD - PLANET BELOW
text: Clouds part as if swept aside by hand. Beneath the
dialog: shuttle a world opens up that can only be described
dialog: as incredible.
scene_heading: 203 INT. COPERNICUS
text: Sybok, Kirk, McCoy and Spock remain focused ahead,
text: awestruck.
scene_heading: 204 EXT. PLANET
text: Copernicus skims over a rich abundant landscape awash
text: with bright primary colors.
scene_heading: 205 INT. COPERNICUS
text: Spock removes his hands from the console.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I am no longer in control of the
dialog: craft.
text: Kirk, Spock and McCoy regard each other with wary
text: excitement, then turn their attentions to what lies ahead.
scene_heading: 206 EXT. PLANET - POV SHOT
text: A circle of peaks appears in the distance, rising against
dialog: the sky.
scene_heading: 207 INT. COPERNICUS
text: Sybok smiles at the others.
scene_heading: 208 EXT. PLANET
text: Copernicus comes in for a soft landing.
scene_heading: 209 INT. COPERNICUS
text: Engines switch off. Kirk slips a communicator into his
text: belt. He's about to pick up a hand phaser when he feels
text: Sybok's disapproving eye upon him.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: All right. We'll play it your
dialog: way.
text: He leaves the weapon behind.
scene_heading: 210 EXT. OUTSIDE SHUTTLE
text: The exit hatch opens. Our four explorers emerge from
text: the craft. They regard the prehistoric peaks with
dialog: excitement.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: It's amazing. The land... the
dialog: sky... just as I knew it would be.
text: They urgently start forward with Kirk leading the way.
scene_heading: 211 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE
text: Crew members abandon their posts and move forward to
text: the viewscreen.
scene_heading: 212 EXT. PEAKS AND CRATER WITHIN - HIGH ANGLE SHOT
text: Four tiny figures pass through the peaks and look down
text: into a naturally formed amphitheater. It's nothing
text: more than a rough crater carved in the summit, ringed
dialog: by the peaks.
scene_heading: 213 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE
text: Uhura, eyes fixed on the viewscreen, speaks urgently
text: into her speaker.
speaker_heading: UHURA
dialog: Scotty, you've got to see this.
scene_heading: 214 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOOM
text: Scotty is hard at work.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: I don't have the time. The Captain
dialog: told me to get this transporter
dialog: working and I'm not about to let
dialog: him down.
scene_heading: 215 EXT. PLANET
text: Kirk walks around the base of the tall peak as the CAMERA
speaker_heading: PULLS BACK
scene_heading: 216 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE
text: While the crew marvels at the viewscreen, CAMERA PANS
text: over to the defense station which is unattended.
text: The screen blinks to life. A graphic of the Bird of
text: Prey appears and a warning; "KLINGON VESSEL IN
scene_heading: QUADRANT. RECOMMEND: ACTIVATION OF DEFENSE SYSTEMS.
text: AWAITING COMMAND." A low warning BEEP. But no one's
dialog: there to respond.
scene_heading: 217 EXT. AMPHITHEATER
text: Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Sybok descend into the bowl of
text: the crater. They reach the center and stop. They
text: look at each other, wondering, "Is this all there is?"
text: Sybok tries to hide his disappointment. He looks around
text: for a sign that isn't there, then, after a moment of
text: deafening silence, he addresses their bleak surroundings.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: (shouting; a trace
dialog: of desperation)
dialog: We have traveled far by starship...
text: Nothing. It looks like a bust. Sybok's voice chokes
text: off and he lowers his head. Kirk and McCoy frown at
text: each other. Kirk whips out his communicator to address
dialog: the ship.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Enterprise, this is Kirk. We
dialog: have, er...
text: Spock goes to Sybok and puts a comforting hand on his
text: brother's shoulder.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Sybok, perhaps, er...
text: Spock's words are obscured by a rumble from within the
text: earth. A shadow engulfs the amphitheater.
scene_heading: 218 ANGLE - THE SKY ABOVE
text: Clouds turn ashen and threatening, transforming day
dialog: into night.
speaker_heading: 219 AMPHITHEATER
text: The ground comes to life beneath the feet of our
text: hero's. The earth buckles and ripples as if nature
text: herself were trying to break free.
text: Without warning a pillar of sheer rock rips through
text: the surface and climbs skyward. Then another pillar
text: shoots up, followed by another and another. They
text: encircle the amphitheater like giant fingers. We
text: INTERCUT Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Sybok reacting to this
text: dazzling display of power.
scene_heading: 220 EXT. AMPHITHEATER - WIDE SHOT
text: The fingers of rock form a crude cathedral.
scene_heading: 221 INT. AMPHITHEATER
text: Within this primitive cathedral, Kirk, Spock, McCoy and
text: Sybok watch as the ground in front of them melts like
text: molten lava. It swirls, creating a vortex. A RUSHING
text: SOUND comes from the planet's core, growing closer.
text: Something of incredible power is on its way to the
dialog: surface.
speaker_heading: 222 ANGLE
text: A shaft of energy EXPLODES out of the vortex. It
text: shoots skyward like an erupting power, blinding our
text: heroes with its beauty and raw power.
scene_heading: 223 EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - PLANET AND ENTERPRISE
text: The energy shaft rises from the planet like a beacon
text: light. Enterprise, just outside the shaft, is bathed
text: in its reflection.
scene_heading: 224 INT. AMPHITHEATER
text: Sybok staggers back. Like Kirk, Spock and McCoy, he
text: must shield his eyes from the intensity of the energy
dialog: shaft.
speaker_heading: 225 ENERGY SHAFT
text: It pulsates and throbs with life. A GOD-LIKE VOICE
text: comes from within.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Brave souls. Welcome.
text: Startled reactions.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: Is this the voice of God?
text: As if responding to McCoy's question, the energy shaft
text: throbs. From the swirling dust within it, a living form
text: begins to take shape. The shape is powerful, beautiful,
text: enticing.
text: Sybok and the others watch in wonder. The wind it kicks
text: up causes them to stagger back.
scene_heading: 226 CLOSER ANGLE - ENERGY SHAFT
text: Within this maelstrom of power, the form of humanity
text: begins to take shape. And it takes on many forms, each
dialog: reminding us of the holy paintings that have depicted
dialog: the Almighty through the ages.
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: One voice. Many faces.
text: 227 A SERIES OF SHOTS
text: We INTERCUT between the shifting images of God and
text: the reactions of the Enterprise crew. One moment the
text: figure is Ra. The next, Allah. He's black. White.
text: Female. Male. Andorian. Klingon. Each witness a
text: flash of his own God.
scene_heading: 228 KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY
text: They watch the "God Show" with mounting fascination.
speaker_heading: 229 ENERGY SHAFT
text: The Being synthesizes into the Biblical Heavenly Father
dialog: of our imagination. (Note: The Being is contained
text: within the perimeters of the energy shaft, unable to
dialog: venture out of it.)
text: The Being turns his gaze on Sybok, Kirk, Spock and
text: McCoy. He beams with pleasure. His eyes twinkle.
speaker_heading: BEING
dialog: Does this better suit your
dialog: expectations?
text: It does indeed. No one knows what to say. Sybok is
text: vindicated; he can barely contain his ecstasy.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: Qual se tu?
speaker_heading: BEING
dialog: It is I.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: The journey you undertook to reach
dialog: me could not have been an easy one.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: It was not. The Barrier stood
dialog: between us - but we breached it.
speaker_heading: BEING
dialog: Magnificent. You are the first to
dialog: find me.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: We sought only your infinite wisdom.
speaker_heading: BEING
dialog: And how did you breach the Barrier?
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: With a starship!
speaker_heading: BEING
dialog: This starship, could it carry my
dialog: wisdom beyond the Barrier?
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: It could. Yes.
speaker_heading: BEING
dialog: Then I shall make use of this
dialog: starship.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: (thrilled)
dialog: It will be your chariot!
text: Kirk politely raises his hand.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: BEING
dialog: (ignoring Kirk)
dialog: It will carry my power to every
dialog: corner of creation...
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (insistent)
dialog: Excuse me.
text: The Being regards Kirk like he was a pesky insect.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'd just like to ask a question.
text: McCoy looks at Kirk like he just farted in church.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What does God need with a starship?
text: The Being returns his attention to Sybok.
speaker_heading: BEING
dialog: Bring the ship closer.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I said... what does God need with
dialog: a starship?
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Jim, what are you doing?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I'm asking a question.
text: The Being once again regards Kirk. Kirk stands his ground.
speaker_heading: BEING
dialog: Who is this creature?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Who am I? Don't you know? Aren't
dialog: you God?
text: The smile leaves The Being's face. THUNDER RUMBLES
text: faintly in the distance, underscoring his displeasure.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: He has his doubts...
speaker_heading: BEING
dialog: You doubt me?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I seek proof.
speaker_heading: McCOY

text: A bolt of energy shoots from The Being's eye and strikes
text: Kirk full in the chest, knocking him to the ground.
text: Spock and McCoy look on in shock as Kirk, injured, tries
dialog: to rise.
scene_heading: 230 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (to Sybok)
dialog: Why.. is God... angry?
text: Sybok is confounded. He addresses The Being.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: Why? Why have you done this to
dialog: my friend?
speaker_heading: BEING
dialog: He doubts me.
text: Spock takes it upon himself to step forward.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: You have not answered his question.
dialog: What does God need with a starship?
text: The Being's countenance turns dark. Another bolt shoots
text: from his eye and heads for Spock. CRASH! Spock is
text: knocked to the ground.
text: The Being turns to McCoy.
speaker_heading: BEING
dialog: Do you doubt me?
text: McCoy looks at The Being's handiwork - his injured friends.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: I doubt any God who inflicts pain
dialog: for his own pleasure.
text: The Being is on the verge of zapping McCoy when Sybok
text: interrupts.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: Stop! The God of Sha Ka Ree would
dialog: not do this!
text: By way of reply, The Being smiles a truly wicked smile
text: and Sybok realizes to his horror that he's been tricked.
speaker_heading: BEING
dialog: Sha Ka Ree?
dialog: (scornful laugh)
dialog: A vision you created. An eternity
dialog: I've been imprisoned in this place!
dialog: The ship! I must have the ship!
dialog: Now give me what I want!
text: Spock shouts to his brother.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Sybok - this is not the God of
dialog: Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: I don't understand..
dialog: (to The Being)
dialog: Reveal yourself to me!
scene_heading: 232 ANGLE - THE BEING
text: Before our stunned eyes The Being changes into Sybok
text: himself - a dark, sinister reflection of Sybok. This Evil
text: Sybok laughs, enjoying the reaction.
speaker_heading: BEING
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: What's wrong? Don't you like this
dialog: face? I have so many. But this
dialog: one suits you best.
text: 233 ANGLE TO INCLUDE SYBOK
text: His self-realization is painful to behold.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: No, no, it's not possible.
speaker_heading: BEING
dialog: Bring me the ship or I will
dialog: destroy you!
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: (realizing The Being's
dialog: evil intention)
dialog: The ship....
speaker_heading: BEING
dialog: Bring it closer so that I might
dialog: join with it. Do it, or watch
dialog: these puny things die horribly.
text: The Being indicates Spock and McCoy.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: What have I done?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (into his communicator)
dialog: Kirk to Enterprise. Listen
dialog: carefully...
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: (turns to Spock;
dialog: in agony)
dialog: Spock...
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (urgently)
dialog: Sybok.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: (soul searching)
dialog: This is my doing. This is my
dialog: arrogance... my vanity...
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Sybok, we must find a way...
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: No. You must save yourselves.
dialog: Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
text: Sybok raises his hand to Spock in the Vulcan gesture of
text: farewell, then turns to face The Being, gathering up all
text: his power. Spock starts forward but Kirk holds him back.
scene_heading: 234 ANGLE - THE BEING AND SPOCK
text: Sybok has no fear as he confronts his evil mirror image.
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: (continuing; to The Being)
dialog: I couldn't help but notice you
dialog: pain.
speaker_heading: BEING
dialog: (caught off-guard)
dialog: My pain?
speaker_heading: SYBOK
dialog: It runs deep. Share it with me.
text: Sybok boldly enters the shaft and embraces his evil twin.
scene_heading: 235 ANGLE - ENERGY HAFT
text: An amazing spectacle. As they grapple, the good and evil
text: Syboks merge into one twisting, thrashing body, clearly
text: at battle with itself. The good Sybok tears himself
text: loose. He dominates the struggle until the evil Sybok
text: manages to rip through and fight back. The two Syboks,
text: good and evil, battle on... merging, tearing again.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (into communicator)
dialog: Enterprise... are you ready?
scene_heading: 236 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE
text: Sulu and Chekov in action. Sulu uses all the tricks
text: of the pilot's trade to angle the ship into the best
dialog: possible attack position.
text: Chekov punches commands into the weapons console,
dialog: plotting the correct torpedo trajectory. It's like
text: watching two master magicians play a symphony in a
text: windstorm. The screens in front of them blink and
text: flash with graphic displays and warnings.
speaker_heading: SULU
text: In firing position. Torpedo
dialog: armed.
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: But, Captain, we're firing

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Run! Go!
scene_heading: 240 INT. AMPHITHEATER
text: Impact is seconds away. Kirk, Spock and McCoy run for
text: cover. From far beneath the surface of the planet
text: comes the SOUND of the EXPLOSION. The ground blisters
text: and puckers.
scene_heading: 241 AMPHITHEATER - LONG SHOT
text: Our heroes dive for cover as a BLINDING EXPLOSION erupts
text: from the hole.
scene_heading: 242 INT. AMPHITHEATER
text: Smoke. Debris. The cathedral is in disarray. An
text: eerie silence. Kirk, Spock and McCoy emerge from cover.
text: The energy shaft is a memory. In its place there is
text: only a gaping hole, glowing raw and red like a wound.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Sybok...
text: A RUMBLING SOUND from within the earth. The hole
text: throbs. It pulsates.
speaker_heading: KIRK

scene_heading: 243 KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY

dialog: the planet below.
scene_heading: 245 ANGLE - DEFENSE STATION
text: The unattended screen still depicts the Bird of Prey.
text: "ESTIMATED TIME OF INTERCEPT: 4 MINUTES." Then,
text: the graphic of the ship vanishes and is replaced with
text: this warning: "CLOAKING DEVICE ENGAGED. POSITION
speaker_heading: UNKNOWN."
scene_heading: 246 EXT. AMPHITHEATER
text: Kirk, Spock and McCoy reach the top and rush to
dialog: Copernicus.
scene_heading: 247 INT. COPERNICUS
text: Kirk, Spock and McCoy make it inside. The door closes
text: behind them.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Spock, get us out of here!
text: Before Spock can act a tremendous blow rocks the shuttle.
dialog: There's something out there and it wants to get in.
text: Spock tries the controls.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
text: Thrusters are inoperative.
text: Kirk whips out his communicator.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Mr. Scott!
speaker_heading: SCOTTY'S VOICE
dialog: Scotty here, sir.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Please tell me the transporter is
dialog: working.
scene_heading: 248 INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER ROOM
speaker_heading: SCOTTY

scene_heading: 249 INT. COPERNICUS
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (into communicator)
text: Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy.
dialog: Now!
text: Before Spock and McCoy can protest, the transporter beam

speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Now just a damn min...
text: Spock and McCoy vanish in a glow of light as they are
text: beamed up.
scene_heading: 250 INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER ROOM
text: Spock and McCoy step off the platform. Scotty is at
text: the control console.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Scott. Beam up
dialog: the Captain.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Aye-aye.
scene_heading: 251 EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - ENTERPRISE AND BIRD OF PREY
text: The Klingon ship has decloaked and fired from a position

scene_heading: 252 INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER ROOM
text: Enterprise absorbs a terrific jolt. Spock, McCoy and

scene_heading: 253 EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON BIRD OF PREY
dialog: Firing.
scene_heading: 254 INT. COPERNICUS

scene_heading: 255 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE
text: The crew painfully pulls itself together. Fires are

speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (to Spock)
dialog: What about Jim? We can't just
dialog: leave him down there.
speaker_heading: SPOCK

speaker_heading: UHURA
dialog: Klingon Captain wishes to name

speaker_heading: SPOCK
text: On screen.

text: speaks English for the first time.
speaker_heading: KLAA'S IMAGE
dialog: This is Captain Klaa of the
dialog: Klingon Empire. Attempt to raise
dialog: shields or arm weapons and I will
dialog: destroy you. You are alive for a
dialog: single reason. The renegade James
dialog: T. Kirk. Hand him over and I will
dialog: spare your lives. My transporter
text: stands ready to beam him aboard.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Captain Kirk is not among us.
speaker_heading: KLAA'S IMAGE
dialog: You lie!
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I'm a Vulcan. I'm incapable of
text: lying. Captain Kirk is on the
dialog: planet below.
speaker_heading: KLAA'S IMAGE
dialog: Then give me his coordinates!
text: Spock glimpses a possibility. He turns to Korrd and
text: speaks with urgency.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: General, I am in need of your
dialog: assistance.
speaker_heading: KORRD
dialog: (scoffing)
dialog: My assistance?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: You are his superior officer.
speaker_heading: KORRD
dialog: I am a foolish old man.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Damn you, sir, you will try!
text: Korrd sees that Spock will not take no for an answer.
speaker_heading: CUT TO :

speaker_heading: 258 PINNACLE
text: With nowhere to go but up, Kirk scales a steep pinnacle.
text: He climbs with agility and speed.
scene_heading: 259 WIDE ANGLE SHOT
text: Kirk climbs up as a bolt of light hits the rock before
text: him. The blue light and smoke of The Being pulsates
text: from the rocky face of the mountain. The eyes of The
text: Being glow white.
text: There's a WHOOSHING SOUND from above. Kirk looks up.
scene_heading: 260 ANGLE - SKY ABOVE
text: The Bird of Prey drops out of the storm clouds. Its
text: guns come to life and strafe the rock creature.
speaker_heading: 261 KIRK
text: Vulnerable atop the pinnacle. The Bird of Prey hovers
text: directly above him, its guns swiveling in his direction.
text: Kirk is determined to go down fighting.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (shouting in defiance)
dialog: So it's me you want, you Klingon
dialog: bastards! What are you waiting
dialog: for?!
text: The Bird of Prey's transporter beam shimmers down and
text: engulfs him. Kirk disappears in its sparkling light,
text: saved from The Being who lets out an angry roar of
text: defeat. The Bird of Prey takes off with its prize.
scene_heading: 262 INT. BIRD OF PREY - TRANSPORTER ROOM
text: Kirk materializes. He's immediately seized by two
text: brutal-looking Klingons. They march him out of the
dialog: transporter room.
scene_heading: 263 INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE
text: The bridge doors slide open and Kirk is brought in.
text: The Klingon crew regard him from their stations.
text: Klaa is off to one side looking petulant. Korrd stands
text: beside him, chest puffed up with pride, obviously in
dialog: charge.
speaker_heading: KORRD
dialog: (to the guards)
dialog: Release him.
text: The guards step away from Kirk. Klaa glares at Korrd
text: but it's clear the older Klingon is now calling the
dialog: shots.
text: Kirk regards Korrd with surprise.
speaker_heading: KORRD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Kirk, my junior officer has
dialog: something he wants to say to you.
dialog: (speaks to Klaa in Klingon.)
speaker_heading: KLAA
dialog: I apologize.
text: Korrd speaks to Klaa in Klingon once again.
speaker_heading: KLAA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: The attack upon your vessel was
dialog: not authorized by my government.
speaker_heading: KORRD
dialog: Kirk, and now, may I present our
text: new gunner.
text: The command chair swivels around to reveal its occupant
text: to be Spock. He unstraps himself from the gunner's rig,
text: stands up and straightens his uniform in a dignified
dialog: manner.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Spock?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Welcome aboard, Captain.
text: Kirk regards the stoic Spock with affection and wonder.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (can't believe it)
dialog: Spock, I thought I was going to
dialog: die.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Not possible. You were never
dialog: alone.
text: Kirk fights back tears and clasps his friend in a hug.
text: Spock stiffens with embarrassment.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Please, Captain, not in front of
dialog: the Klingons.

text: The Klingon polishes off a tumbler of fluid. He frowns.
text: What he wants is a real drink. Scotty approaches him.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Would you care for a wee nip of
dialog: Scotch whiskey?
speaker_heading: KORRD
dialog: Ummmm...
text: Scotty produces a bottle and pours a splash into the
text: Klingon's tumbler. Korrd downs it with obvious relish.
text: Scotty smiles.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: I never thought I'd ever be drinking
dialog: with a Klingon, heh?
text: Korrd chortles agreeably and moves off. We FOLLOW him
text: over to Talbot and Caithlin.
speaker_heading: KORRD
dialog: What are you two conspiring
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: TALBOT
dialog: We were just saying how far we've
dialog: come in such a short space of time.
speaker_heading: KORRD

speaker_heading: 267 ANGLE - KLAA
text: Vixis walks to Klaa. When they see him, Chekov and
text: Sulu suddenly stop and turn away. Klaa waves off a
text: waiter who offers him a drink. He approaches a table
text: where Kirk sits talking to crewmen. Klaa gives him
text: the Klingon chest-thumping salute.
scene_heading: 268 ANGLE - KIRK
text: With a smile, Kirk returns the Klingon salute.
text: He notices Spock and McCoy standing at the window,
text: staring out, oblivious to the party around them. Kirk
text: approaches.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Cosmic thoughts, gentlemen?
dialog: McCoy
dialog: We were speculating.
dialog: (staring out)
dialog: ... is God really out there?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Maybe he's not out there, Bones.
dialog: Maybe he's right here... in the
dialog: human heart
dialog: (noticing Spock's
dialog: distant expression)
dialog: Spock?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I was thinking of Sybok. I've
dialog: lost a brother.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Yes. I lost a brother once.
dialog: I was lucky. I got him back.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: I thought you said men like us

speaker_heading: KIRK

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO :
scene_heading: 269 EXT. YOSEMITE - NIGHT
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK from a roaring campfire. McCoy pours
text: two cups full of bourbon and hands one to Kirk who
text: sets aside his marshmallow on a stick. Kirk and McCoy
text: clink cups in a silent toast and drink, distracted by
text: strange PLINKING SOUNDS from close by. Spock is
text: revealed, absently strumming his Vulcan lute, in search
dialog: of a tune.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: Are you just going to sit there
dialog: and pluck that thing? Or are
dialog: you going to play something?
text: The plinks and plunks gradually become a tune. The
text: unmistakable "Row Your Boat." Kirk and McCoy react with
text: delight. Kirk takes a hit of bourbon and clears his
dialog: throat.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (singing)
dialog: "Row, row, row your boat, gently
text: down the stream, merrily, merrily,
