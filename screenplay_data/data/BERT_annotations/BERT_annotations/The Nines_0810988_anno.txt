dialog: Written by
dialog: John August
speaker_heading: FINAL SCRIPT
dialog: November 2006
speaker_heading: READER NOTE
dialog: One thing that will be obvious to viewers, but not
dialog: to readers, is that the nine principal parts in this
text: film are played by only three actors:
dialog: 1) Gary, Gavin, Gabriel
dialog: 2) Sarah, Susan, Sierra
dialog: 3) Margaret, Melissa, Mary
dialog: It'll make more sense in context. Promise.
speaker_heading: 100 100
speaker_heading: A MAN'S HAND
text: unwinds a short length of green string. We're extremely
text: close, with a shallow, blurry focus. It's like the first
text: moments after a dream -- just fragments.
text: Scissors cut the string. The man wraps it around his left
text: wrist. A loop. A bracelet.
text: We see the man's teeth, the edge of his chin as he pulls the
text: knot tight.
text: His fingers pull against the string. Solid. It won't break
dialog: easily.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: 101 101
speaker_heading: PITCH BLACK
text: There's no music. No sound at all, really, except for some
text: distant birds CHIRPING.
text: Then a SQUEAK. A SQUEAL as rusty springs engage.
scene_heading: A GARAGE DOOR LIFTS,
text: revealing GARY BANKS in silhouette. He's 30, effortlessly
text: fit, with movie-star good looks. (Although for now, he's
dialog: merely a TV star.)
dialog: Like most Laurel Canyon garages, this one has never held a
text: car. Instead, it's the resting place for all the detritus of
text: bachelordom: shitty Ikea furniture, a drum set, a styrofoam
text: snowman, and the Harley he always meant to get running.
text: Gary spots what he was looking for.

scene_heading: EXT. BACK PATIO / LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR (DAWN)
text: Gary drags a beaten Weber kettle. One of its wheels is
text: broken, SCRAPING against the deck.
text: WIDER, we see Gary's house has an incredible view of the
dialog: city. He couldn't fucking care less.
text: He yanks the circular grill out of the Weber and throws it
text: down the canyon.
dialog: 2.
text: He empties a garbage bag into the barbecue: mostly women's
text: clothes, but also some stuffed animals and photos still in
text: their frames. There's too much to fit, so he tries stomping
text: it down with a flip-flopped foot.
text: He cracks open a container of lighter fluid and begins
text: drenching everything inside. He sprays until the container
text: is WHEEZING air. He shakes it, making sure it's really
text: empty.
text: Then he cracks open a new container and keeps spraying. And
text: spraying.
text: We follow the dripping fluid as it runs across a photo of
text: Gary and a BLONDE WOMAN. Her eyes are scratched out, making
text: her unrecognizable.
text: Under the grill, lighter fluid is dripping in a stream,
text: soaking into the wooden deck.
text: Finally satisfied, Gary throws the lighter fluid aside. He
text: takes five steps back and pulls a box of matches from his
dialog: pocket.
dialog: 103 103
text: EXTREMELY CLOSE as the match SCRAPES, erupting in flames.
text: On Gary's left wrist, we see a green string bracelet.
text: MUSIC STARTS: a pounding, hypnotic track that will carry us
text: through these MAIN TITLES.
text: In EPIC SLOW-MOTION, we follow the burning match as it sails
text: through the air, tumbling end-over-end.
text: Just as it's about to reach its target, we...

dialog: Prius. We are...
dialog: 105 105
scene_heading: INT. THE PRIUS - DAY
text: Gary's at the wheel, driving, as he finishes a fifth of
text: bourbon. JUMP CUTS take us out of Hollywood, heading
text: downtown. Our TRAVELLING MUSIC is serving us well.
text: Gary stops at a light. He looks left and sees himself on the
text: side of a bus. It's an ad for CRIME LAB ("This fall, Mondays
text: are killer.") Gary watches himself drive away.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 3.
text: 106 Further along, Gary spots two THUGGY TEENAGERS sitting on a 106
text: low wall. He calls out to them:
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Hey! Do you sell crack?
text: The boys look wary.
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
dialog: It's cool. I'm only a cop on TV.
speaker_heading: QUICK CUTS:
text: Money changes hands.
text: Gary holds a small ziplock bag -- and has no idea what to do
text: with its lumpy beige contents.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 107 107
scene_heading: HOLLYWOOD.
text: Gary pulls up to a curb. He's now on Sunset Blvd. A
text: matronly black streetwalker (OCTAVIA, 35) approaches the
text: passenger window.
text: Gary holds up the little bag.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Is this crack?
text: She takes a closer look.
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know how to do it?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: 108 108
scene_heading: INT. SHITTY MOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: Gary and Octavia jump up and down on the bed, each trying to
text: bounce higher than the other, LAUGHING all the while.
text: Gary bounces so high that he THUNKS his head against the
text: ceiling. He crumples, falling off the bed. But he's still
text: laughing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 109 109
text: LATER, Octavia is sleeping.

scene_heading: INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - DAY
text: Gary takes a shower with his jeans on.
dialog: 111 111
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Toweling off, Gary looks at his body in the mirror. He
text: notices something odd. He tries to wake Octavia up, but
text: she's down for the count.
text: Looking around, he finds his cell phone. Dials 911. Pacing,
text: he tries to sober up while it rings. The far side answers.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Yes, hello. I'm having a medical
dialog: situation. Yes. Okay. I don't
dialog: have a belly button.
dialog: (explaining carefully)
dialog: I do not have a belly button where
dialog: I should, on my belly. And I'm
dialog: concerned, because I don't know if
dialog: that's...
text: He sits down on the edge of the bed.
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Can a person live without a belly
dialog: button? Because if you think about
dialog: it, you're born with one. So if
dialog: you don't have one, you're unborn
dialog: and it's really hazy whether you're
dialog: alive or not. I guess I'm
dialog: wondering: am I alive?
dialog: (a sudden thought)
dialog: Or what if I'm God?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
dialog: No, no. I'm totally sober.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
dialog: No, I don't think I need an
dialog: ambulance. I don't seem to be
dialog: dying any faster than usual. But I
dialog: should probably go to the hospital,
dialog: don't you think? Yeah, I should.
text: He hangs up.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 5.
dialog: 112 112
scene_heading: INT. THE PRIUS - DAY
text: He's driving again, but most of his attention is focused on
text: trying to locate his missing navel.
text: He looks up in the rear-view mirror, where he sees two
speaker_heading: A113 A113
scene_heading: VERSIONS OF HIMSELF
text: sitting in the back seat. All three Garys give each other
text: thumbs-up.
text: Driver-Gary looks out the driver-side window, where he sees
text: shoes and asphalt. Only now do we ROTATE to reveal we're
speaker_heading: B113 B113
scene_heading: UPSIDE-DOWN.

text: MARGARET O'REILLY, 34, is speaking to herself.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: La la la la la. Like you've never
dialog: done worse.
text: From a NEW ANGLE, we see she's using a cell phone earpiece.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, yes. He totalled a car. But
dialog: it was an environmentally friendly
dialog: car. Why doesn't that get
dialog: reported?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: Please! He was heartbroken,
dialog: betrayed. You say you understand
dialog: but you don't. You can't. You're
text: like a big giant Vulcan.
dialog: 6.
dialog: Noticing something to her right...
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: He's coming. I'll call you later.
text: She hangs up, wrapping the earpiece around her phone. We
dialog: reveal
speaker_heading: GARY
text: being escorted through glass doors by a polo-shirted PAROLE
text: OFFICER. Margaret moves to intercept them, offering a hand.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: Hi. Margaret. I work for Lola.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Gary.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I know.
dialog: (to the Parole Officer)
dialog: We need to go out the back.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: INT. BACK HALLWAY - DAY
text: Margaret leads the way. She's been here before.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Are there reporters out front?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: A few. Not Hugh Grant level. More
dialog: like Robert Downey, Jr. when he
dialog: broke into that family's house and
dialog: slept in the kid's bed like
dialog: Goldilocks. "This bed is just
dialog: right." I handled episodes two
dialog: through four for Robert. This sort
dialog: of thing is my specialty.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: What is?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Famous fuck-ups. Don't worry.
dialog: Mama's gonna take good care of you.
text: A phone RINGS.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 7.
dialog: 116 116
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: A designer kitchen in Hancock Park -- spacious and kosher-
text: ready. The phone on the counter is RINGING.
speaker_heading: PAROLE OFFICER
dialog: Answer it.
text: Gary picks it up.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Hello? Yes. Yes.
text: He looks to Margaret while the other end of the call talks at
dialog: length. Then, very deliberately...
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
text: The weather in Toledo is rainy.
text: He says this like a sleeper agent repeating his trigger
dialog: phrase.
speaker_heading: PAROLE OFFICER
dialog: Use your normal voice.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (to the phone)
text: Nine dogs ran through the field.
text: The koala sits in the tree.
text: The Parole Officer takes the phone from him, punching in a
text: series of numbers and jotting notes on his work sheet.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
text: It's computer voice recognition.
dialog: The system can call you any time
dialog: day or night. If you don't answer
text: within five rings, the police come
dialog: and haul your ass off.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: What if I'm not here?
text: Catching the officer's concerned look...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: That's why it's called house
dialog: arrest. You stay inside your
dialog: house.
dialog: (to the officer)
dialog: He can take direction, I promise.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 8.
dialog: 117 117
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
text: Margaret pulls open curtains, flooding the room with light.
text: Gary wanders, checking it all out.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Okay, just so it's said, this house
dialog: is flammable.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I didn't mean to burn down my
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yeah, I didn't mean to eat my way
dialog: into a ten-year shame spiral, but I
dialog: did, and it's healthier to
dialog: acknowledge it.
dialog: (moving on)
dialog: This flammable house belongs to one
dialog: of Lola's other fabulous clients,
dialog: who is currently shooting a pilot
dialog: in Toronto.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Actor?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Writer. So for the next six weeks,
dialog: su casa es su casa. I say, feel
dialog: free to wear his clothes. He'll
dialog: probably get a sick thrill of out
dialog: it. The gays.
text: Noticing two crates...
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: He has dogs?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: They're away at summer camp. Now,
dialog: try the bed.
text: He lies back on it, feeling it out.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: It's fine.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Comfortable?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Sure.
text: She massages his besocked feet.
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Look, Gary, I know this has been
dialog: crazy and stressful. I want you to
dialog: feel safe. And comfortable.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm a fan of yours, you know. Your
dialog: number-one fan.
text: Gary looks over his toes at Margaret. From this angle, she
text: looks a bit like Kathy Bates from Misery.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: But if you fuck this up, I will
dialog: smash your ankles with a sledge
dialog: hammer.
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: That wouldn't be comfortable for
dialog: either of us.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Margaret boxes up the alcohol while Gary bounces a lime on
dialog: the island.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'll be coming by twice a day to
dialog: check up on you. I'm the only
dialog: person who should be coming by. No
dialog: buddies, no pals, no heroin
dialog: dealers...
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I don't do heroin.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yeah, crack is classy. And I'm not
dialog: buying you porn. There's spray-per-
dialog: view on cable.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Good. I really wasn't concerned
dialog: about my career, my family or my
dialog: future. I just wanted to jack off.
text: Margaret is a little impressed by this show of backbone.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Let me see your phone.
text: He hands over his cell phone. She drops it in the contraband
dialog: box.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: C'mon! All my numbers are in that.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
text: Dial ten digits at random. Whoever
dialog: answers will be better than the
dialog: people on this phone.
text: She picks up the liquor box, ready to go.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: You have my cell number. You have
dialog: delivery menus. You're fine.
dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I guess.
text: As she leaves, Margaret notices a long butane lighter by the
text: stove. She adds it to the box, just to be sure.
scene_heading: TIME CUT TO:
dialog: 119 119
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE / VARIOUS - DAY
text: Gary paces around his new home, trying to get a feel for it.
text: He plays a few NOTES on the piano.
text: He looks up at the painting over the staircase: a cliff near
dialog: the ocean.
text: He opens random drawers in a Chinese herb cabinet, wondering
dialog: if there's anything hidden in one of the 46 slots. There
dialog: isn't.
text: He takes a long beat to consider three paintings in the
text: dining room, which show the same thing in three different
dialog: ways.
speaker_heading: 120 120
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - SUMMER NIGHT
text: Gary swims laps, trying to exhaust himself.
text: He stands in the shallow end, listening to the quiet.

dialog: 121 121
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - SUMMER NIGHT
text: Wearing a fluffy white robe, he looks through the delivery
dialog: menus.
dialog: 122 122
scene_heading: INT. FOYER / FRONT DOOR - SUMMER NIGHT
text: He takes a bag of food from a college-age DELIVERY GUY, who
text: seems to recognize him. Gary pays him, shuts the door.
text: As he's walking to the kitchen with the food, Gary looks back
text: and sees the Delivery Guy watching him from the front walk.
text: The guy is a little embarrassed, but Gary is pretty used to
text: being stared at.
dialog: 123 123
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - SUMMER NIGHT
text: Gary unwraps the Thai food. Makes himself a plate.
text: He watches CRIME LAB on the plasma screen while eating
dialog: dinner.
speaker_heading: GARY (O.S. TV DIALOGUE)
dialog: Once we get these samples back to
dialog: the Crime Lab, we'll know who the
dialog: real killer is.
dialog: 124 124
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY / TV ROOM - NIGHT
text: Gary scans the shelves, looking for something to read. There
dialog: are five times more books here than Gary has opened in his
dialog: lifetime.
text: He settles on a paperback of Voltaire's Candide.
text: He lies back on the couch, reading it.
text: He flips a few pages ahead to see if it gets more
text: interesting. A beat.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: 125 125
scene_heading: GARY JACKING OFF
text: to soft-core pay-per-view. We're CLOSE ON Gary's straining
text: face, but we can hear the pleasured MOANS of the actresses as
text: they go down on each other.
text: Nearing climax, he looks for something to come on. He can't
dialog: find anything.
dialog: 12.
dialog: 126 126
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - NIGHT
text: His left hand cupped to hold the semen, he pads barefoot from
text: the TV room to the downstairs bathroom. We hear WATER
text: RUNNING as he washes his hands. Then it shuts off.
text: We hear a THUNK. Something hard was dropped on the wood
dialog: floor.
text: Gary hears it too.
text: He steps out of the bathroom, looks around. He takes a few
text: silent paces back in our direction, stopping just before he
text: reaches the two-story section of the foyer.
text: That's when he hears it: CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-CLICK on the
text: wooden floor. A JINGLE of metal.
text: We follow Gary's eyes up to the second-floor walkway. We can
text: hear the little FOOTSTEPS, toe nails CLICKING. Faint
text: PANTING. But there's no dog.
text: BACK ON Gary, increasingly unsettled. He's directly below
text: the walkway, and can't see up into it.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Is somebody there? Hello?
text: He CLAPS his hands twice. Listens.
dialog: Nothing.
text: He's about to venture a step forward when suddenly
text: THE PHONE RINGS.
text: He nearly jumps out of his skin. It RINGS two more times
text: before he ducks into the TV room to answer it.
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello?!
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Yes. Yes.
text: He turns his back to the foyer, listening to the instructions
text: on the phone.
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
text: Nine leopards run through the
dialog: jungle.
dialog: (listening)
dialog: I bought two cakes at the store.
text: His identity evidently confirmed, he hangs up. He looks back
text: into the foyer.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: GARY (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)
text: The house is haunted. There's a
dialog: zeitgeist, or something.
dialog: 127 127
scene_heading: EXT. UPSTAIRS DECK - DAY
text: Margaret's brought coffee and pastries from Susina.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Poltergeist, and no. Maybe they
text: were rats. L.A. is teaming with
text: rats. They live in the palm trees.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Sure. Maybe.
text: He's obviously not convinced.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Okay. You know I'm a licensed
dialog: psychotherapist.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: No. I'm a publicist. My job is
dialog: what other people think of you, not
dialog: what you think of yourself. So
dialog: pull your shit together. I am
dialog: thisclose to getting Christine
dialog: Walsh to do your piece in Parade.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Parade? I fucking hate Parade.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Everyone hates Parade. But the
dialog: people who watch "Crime Lab," they
dialog: love their Marilyn Vos Savant.
dialog: Give them a woman of indeterminate
dialog: age who solves riddles and they are
dialog: in hee-haw heaven.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
text: One heartfelt act of contrition and
dialog: maybe the showrunner won't kill off
dialog: your character between seasons.
text: He nods. He gets it.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: I swear to God, if you go batshit

scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
text: Gary is lying in the sun, eyes shut. Suddenly, a golf ball
text: hits him on the head.
text: He sits up, perplexed. For a long moment, he has no idea
text: where the ball came from, until he hears a voice from beyond
text: the wall that separates the properties.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Sorry! Really sorry.
text: (A practiced ear notices a Canadian accent.)
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Over here. To your left.
dialog: (correcting)
dialog: Right. Sorry. Right.
text: He follows the voice to a gap in the hedges at the far corner
text: of the yard, finding SARAH GLEASON. Late 30's, fresh-
text: scrubbed and girlish, she looks more fragile than she really
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'm working on my putting, if you
dialog: can believe it.
text: Indeed, she's holding a putter.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Okay. Maybe I was just looking for
dialog: a way to meet my infamous neighbor.
dialog: You see, I'm under house arrest,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: What did you do?
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I had sex with my husband.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: That's awful.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Nine months later, I had Jaden.
dialog: That's her over there.
text: She points to a small portable baby monitor.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: She's cute.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: She's sleeping for another...
dialog: (checks watch)
dialog: ...seventeen minutes. She keeps to
dialog: a schedule.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: She sounds really boring.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: She is.
text: A beat. A smile between them.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: You're rich. Shouldn't you have a
dialog: nanny from Ecuador?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'm Canadian.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (as if that explains it)
dialog: Ohhh...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I can't work in the U.S. Plus, I
dialog: want to maintain this air of moral
dialog: superiority by doing everything
dialog: myself.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Very Canadian.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Thanks.
text: Another pregnant pause.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: SARAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen, Jaden goes down again at
dialog: 2:30. Maybe I could stop by.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I'm pretty sure I'll be here.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It's a date.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Is it?
text: She picks up the baby monitor, heading back into her house.
text: Suddenly, she realizes...

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Strangely enough...
speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It wasn't arson. Probably.

dialog: that all there is?

text: There's only a little blood, but his toes really hurt.
text: Over Gary's shoulder, we see a blonde 8-year old girl

speaker_heading: GAVIN

speaker_heading: GAVIN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Gavin, are you alright?
speaker_heading: GAVIN
dialog: No. No.
text: He takes a long beat, psyching himself up. What spills out
text: is heartfelt but clearly rehearsed.
speaker_heading: GAVIN (CONT'D)
dialog: The network wants to replace you.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Oh my God.
speaker_heading: GAVIN
dialog: And I'm letting them, because I
dialog: really want the show on the air. I
dialog: have all these characters inside my
dialog: head, and they want to live. I'm
dialog: the only way they can. This is the
dialog: only way they can. I have five
dialog: seasons mapped out, and though it
dialog: sucks, either you go away, or the
dialog: show goes. I had to make a
dialog: decision, and that's the decision I
dialog: made. I'm sorry.
text: By the end of it, we can hear the emotion in his voice.
text: Melissa takes a beat to process.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: So it's done. Finished. Decided.
speaker_heading: GAVIN
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I understand. It's not your fault.
dialog: You're morally incapable of doing
dialog: the right thing.
text: Gavin doesn't rise to the challenge.
speaker_heading: MELISSA (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't get me wrong. I think you do
dialog: feel bad for me. But that's all
dialog: you feel for me. You still see me
dialog: as the fat girl you call on Friday
text: night when a date falls through.
dialog: Let's go to a movie! Let's go to
dialog: Fubar! And if you meet a hot piece
dialog: of ass, don't worry about Melissa,
dialog: you can apologize tomorrow. Or
dialog: don't! Same difference. It's not
dialog: like we're actually friends.
speaker_heading: GAVIN
dialog: I don't want to do this on camera.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: No, because you can't control it.
dialog: Your little puppets are off their
text: strings, running around. Saying
dialog: things you didn't write. Reality
dialog: terrifies you.
speaker_heading: GAVIN
dialog: Reality.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GAVIN
dialog: The reality is, you would not be
dialog: here without me. I gave you your
dialog: first few roles. And your career
dialog: is a result of that.
dialog: With exaggerated relief...
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: God, thank you. Thank you for
dialog: finally playing that card. I
dialog: always knew you were holding onto
dialog: it, the "I invented Melissa
dialog: McCarthy card." Congratulations,
dialog: you win. The game is over.
text: She gets up to go, then decides she has one more thing to

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What, you're the victim? The big

text: Finally, he looks INTO CAMERA:
speaker_heading: GAVIN
dialog: Look, I don't want to do this
dialog: anymore. My show's not going to
dialog: happen, so this show is over.
speaker_heading: (MORE)

scene_heading: OFF-SCREEN VOICE

text: Gavin looks left, where an African-American woman is waiting
dialog: for the same crosswalk. (We recognize her as Octavia, the
dialog: streetwalker from Part One.)
speaker_heading: GAVIN
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: OCTAVIA
dialog: Who were you talking to?
text: Gavin looks back towards camera, a strange expression.
speaker_heading: MUCH WIDER
text: We see Gavin and the woman on the corner. There's no camera
text: Gavin could have been talking to. He's understandably
dialog: perplexed: Where did the documentary crew go?
dialog: Was there ever anyone there?
text: Our CAMERA style has changed: instead of handheld and jerky,
dialog: we're smooth and slow.
text: The MUSIC has completely changed, underscoring a sense of
text: creeping dread.
text: We HOLD for a long beat. The light changes. Still a little
text: unnerved, Octavia begins to cross the street.
text: Only then do we notice something unusual floating above her
dialog: head:
text: A SPHERE OF BLUE LIGHT.
dialog: WIDER, we see that everyone on the street has the same kind
text: of sphere floating a foot above their heads. No one seems to
text: see the lights other than Gavin.
text: Gavin looks around in uneasy fascination, as if he's just
text: landed on an alien world.
text: A beat, then he has an unsettling thought.
text: He slowly looks up. Above his own head, he sees the same
text: sphere of light -- only his is bright white. Pulsing.
text: Blinding.
speaker_heading: GAVIN
dialog: Oh God.
dialog: 66.
text: We PULL BACK, RISING UP to a perspective above and behind
text: Gavin. As we do, the edges of the frame creep in, revealing
text: ICONS and unintelligible STATISTICS, changing moment by
dialog: moment.
text: A dialog box appears in the center of the screen, reading...

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Okay, then. Who am I?
dialog: With practiced calm...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You're a multi-dimensional being of
dialog: vast, almost infinite power. You
dialog: created this world on a whim, and
dialog: decided to stick around to see how
dialog: it turned out. You, this body
dialog: you're in, is just one of your
dialog: incarnations. Avatars. Call you
dialog: what you will.
text: Not sure he follows...
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Are you saying I'm God?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Technically, no. If God is a ten --
dialog: a theoretical ultimate, that-which-
dialog: no-greater-can-be-imagined --
dialog: you're more of a nine.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: So what are you?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Humans are sevens. Monkeys are

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: What are the eights?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Koalas. They're telepathic. Plus,
dialog: they control the weather.
dialog: She didn't mean to get on that tangent...

speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: What's important is that you,
dialog: you're the big cheese. El Supremo.
dialog: You could destroy the world with a
dialog: single thought.
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: Don't, incidentally. Just file
dialog: that away. But the truth is, you
dialog: hold all the cards: every church,
dialog: every candle, every sacrifice --
dialog: that's for you. When people pray,
dialog: they're not praying because they
dialog: want this thing or that thing.
dialog: They just don't want to be
dialog: forgotten.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: So you understand, I would have

text: Unlocks the door and climbs in. Opens the door for Mary and
dialog: Noelle.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I think we left the overhead light

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: How do we...?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: We call the service. That's all we
dialog: can do.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It's just the little battery that's
dialog: dead, right? The big one is
dialog: probably fine.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We can't jump it from one battery
dialog: to the other? Cross-over somehow?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Who did you marry? MacGyver?
dialog: 71.
text: He gets out of the car, retrieving his cell phone. Mary

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Are you getting a signal?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: No. Do you?
text: She checks her phone. A long beat.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yes! One bar.
text: They're both relieved. Finding the AAA card in his wallet,

text: It's at this moment we notice the familiar green string
text: bracelet around Gabriel's wrist.
text: In the back seat, Noelle KNOCKS on the window. She signs,
dialog: asking if everything is okay.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: We're okay. Daddy's calling people
dialog: to help us.
text: Gabriel pulls the phone from his ear. Looks at the screen.
dialog: Hits redial. Fuck.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: The minute you try to place a call,
text: the bar goes away.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Keep trying.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Okay, I'll keep trying, Mary. But
dialog: it will keep happening.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Well, what do you want to do?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: I don't know.
text: He tries redial.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Maybe if you hold it up higher.
text: Humoring her, he holds it at arm's length. No good.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: The problem is we're boxed in.
dialog: It's a canyon.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Where we turned off the main road,
text: it was more open. And higher, too.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That's at least a mile.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: I can run that.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: So...we stay here?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: You okay with that?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I don't think we have a choice, so,
dialog: yeah. Go.

speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Daddy's going to get a truck to
dialog: help us out. You take care of your

text: Noelle nods.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL (CONT'D)

text: He decides to head off to the right, downhill.

scene_heading: EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD - DAY

text: hiker. A moment's hesitation, then he YELLS out to her:
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Excuse me! Hi! Hello?
text: She stops, turns.
text: Gabriel jogs to close the distance. As we approach, we
dialog: reveal SIERRA, 38. In the past 10 years, she's "made a fresh

speaker_heading: SIERRA
dialog: No, I don't. There's no service up

speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: (re: his phone)
dialog: Yeah, I'm finding that out.
speaker_heading: SIERRA
dialog: You can usually get a signal up at

speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Okay...
text: She points in the opposite direction -- back the way he came.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: SIERRA
dialog: You follow the road. It's

speaker_heading: GABRIEL

speaker_heading: SIERRA
dialog: Oh...
text: She pulls a stray hair back from her mouth. Notices him
text: noticing her.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Yeah.
text: A beat. She takes a subtle step closer to the center of the
dialog: road.

speaker_heading: GABRIEL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: GABRIEL

speaker_heading: GABRIEL

speaker_heading: SIERRA

speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Well, I guess I'm flattered.
speaker_heading: SIERRA
dialog: You should be. I'm stingy with

speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: So your boyfriend plays videogames?
speaker_heading: SIERRA
dialog: Ex-boyfriend. And yes. Way too
dialog: many. He used to play Evercrack
dialog: back in the day, but yours, well,
dialog: that was like...what's worse than
dialog: crack?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Super-crack?
speaker_heading: SIERRA
dialog: Sure. He was this orc witch doctor

speaker_heading: SIERRA
dialog: So you play a lot of characters at

speaker_heading: GABRIEL

speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: What, like `God mode'?
speaker_heading: SIERRA
dialog: That's what you call it?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: That's when you have all the

dialog: It's fine when you're designing,

dialog: rules.
speaker_heading: SIERRA
dialog: And you make the rules.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Yes I do. I mean, you want to give

speaker_heading: SIERRA

speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: I wanted you close. In one
dialog: version, I even told you. I warned
dialog: you that some day they might come
dialog: for me, and...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: ...You'd have to leave. How many
dialog: versions were there?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
text: Ninety. This is the last one.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: I've destroyed billions of people
text: with a thought. Obliterated them.
dialog: And you'd like to think it's
dialog: painless...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Stop. You don't have to explain, or
dialog: apologize. Everything that is, is
dialog: because of you. If that's all,
dialog: that's enough.
dialog: With that, there's really nothing more to say.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: So.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: So.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Guess you don't really need to pack
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: I'm good.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You're great. It's been a
dialog: pleasure.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Likewise. I love you.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Love you, too. Ya big lug.
text: He kisses her. It's not a big, passionate, movie-ending
text: kiss, but rather a fond kiss farewell. At the end of it, he
text: WHISPERS into her ear:
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: You're my favorite.
text: She smiles.
text: With two fingers, Gabriel BREAKS the green string bracelet
text: around his left wrist.
text: And in that moment, a film passes over him, like the boundary
text: between water and air.
dialog: He's stepped out of this dimension.
text: Mary is frozen with the same smile on her face, but we notice
text: that she and the kitchen around her have flattened out to two-
dialog: dimensional images.
text: She and everything around her has become like wallpaper,
text: slowly curling away, revealing emptiness beneath.
text: Gabriel collapses into a single, spiky sphere of light.
text: The light moves through the kitchen, creating waves that
text: ripple through the tissue-thin walls.
text: Picking up speed, the sphere rushes through the window,
text: heading west.
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: 334 334
scene_heading: EXT. LOS ANGELES - DAY
text: As the light flies out over Hancock Park, the mansions and
text: skyscrapers seem unreal, like models.
text: Reaching Santa Monica, we pass over the ferris wheel at the
text: end of the pier.
text: We dive into the blue ocean beneath us, which becomes only a
text: swirling gray fog with a viscous thickness.
text: We see three lights in the distance. We join them, moving
dialog: with them.
text: Further ahead, more lights, circling. It's a loose spiral
text: made of stars, resembling nothing so much as the number 9.
dialog: As we get closer and closer, we...

speaker_heading: A PALE EYE,
dialog: opening. We are...

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Hands reach up, expecting to find glasses, but there are
dialog: none.
text: As we PULL OUT, we reveal it's not Mary, Melissa or Margaret,
text: but a fourth person -- just slightly different from any of
dialog: them. We'll call her M.
text: She looks first to the spot where Gabriel was standing.
dialog: Empty.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Honey, do we have nutmeg?
text: M looks over at husband Ben, who is busy making pancakes,
text: reading from a recipe.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: We should.
text: Coming around from behind Ben, Noelle checks through the
text: spice drawer. M watches her with cautious fascination.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Cinnamon, too.
dialog: 95.
text: M catches her reflection in the toaster. Notices she looks
dialog: different than she expected.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: (to Ben)
dialog: If I had a horse...
text: Noelle turns back with the spices, handing them to Ben one at
dialog: a time.
speaker_heading: NOELLE (CONT'D)
dialog: I would name her Cinnamon.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: And if I had another horse...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Nutmeg?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: No, Flash.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Sweetie?
text: She beckons Noelle over. Tucks back the little girl's hair.
text: Keeping her voice low enough so Ben can't hear:
speaker_heading: M (CONT'D)
dialog: This is going to sound really
dialog: strange, but...what's my name?
text: Noelle only gives her a half-crazy look.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Mmmmmmmmmm-Mommy.
text: Noelle smiles. M smiles too, a little embarrassed.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Right. Exactly.
text: Noelle looks her right in the eye.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
text: He's not coming back. But it's
dialog: gonna be okay. He put the pieces
dialog: together, it's like...
speaker_heading: M
dialog: The best of all possible worlds.
text: Noelle taps her nose.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Honey? Is it supposed to stick
dialog: like this?
text: Sharing a look...
speaker_heading: M
dialog: We should help him.
text: Noelle agrees. They head over to assist.
text: We MOVE ACROSS the family as they work on the pancakes,
text: Noelle directing how big the ears on hers should be.
text: We leave them in the middle of a messy kitchen, gooey
dialog: pancakes, and a good life.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: THE END
dialog: 97.
scene_heading: ADDITIONAL MATERIAL
text: The following scene (Scene 99) is the conversation between S
text: and G that plays near the end of Part Three. The plan is to
dialog: shoot this scene in almost every setup of the film that
dialog: involves both characters -- be it in Part One, Two or Three.
dialog: So we'll be shooting this scene a lot. We'll then be
dialog: intercutting the best of all these moments to create one
dialog: sequence.
dialog: 99 99
scene_heading: INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS
dialog: S.
dialog: It's not that hard to make a
dialog: universe. At first, you just
dialog: checked in every once in a while.
dialog: See how the Neanderthals were
dialog: doing. Move some continents
dialog: around. But then you got more into
text: it. Starting playing a couple of
dialog: characters of your own. Kings.
dialog: Slaves. Messiahs. Pretty soon,
dialog: you were playing 24/7.
dialog: G.
dialog: How long have I..?
dialog: S.
dialog: You've been gone for four thousand
dialog: years. Not that time means the
dialog: same for us, but...
dialog: G.
dialog: You came looking for me.
dialog: S.
dialog: That's what a girl does.
dialog: G.
dialog: Why now?
dialog: S.
dialog: We couldn't just storm in on a
dialog: fiery chariot. It's your universe.
dialog: We had to play by your rules. We
dialog: had to make you see how limited and
dialog: corrupt your little world was.
dialog: Don't get me wrong, this world is
dialog: nice. It's cozy. But do you
dialog: remember where you came from?
text: A few beats while it comes back to him. Tears start to build
text: in his eyes. What he's picturing is unspeakably beautiful.
dialog: 98.
dialog: G.
dialog: It was warm. And white. Like...
dialog: S.
dialog: You can't describe it with human
dialog: words. You can't think it with
dialog: human thoughts.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's why you have to come back.
dialog: Come back with us. With me.
