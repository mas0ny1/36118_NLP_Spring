speaker_heading: VLAD
dialog: Your basic public humiliation.

speaker_heading: DRACULA
dialog: Maybe we should help this along.
speaker_heading: VLAD
dialog: Okay, we can do that...we’ll need

speaker_heading: DRACULA
dialog: Wow. That’s necessary? He’s just a
dialog: nice little kid --
speaker_heading: VLAD
dialog: That’s the problem! We have to

scene_heading: HT2-RS/AS 3rd draft rev 4/11/14 89.

speaker_heading: VLAD
dialog: That’s what you do? You run a hotel?
speaker_heading: DRACULA
dialog: Yeah. For monsters. Only.
speaker_heading: VLAD
dialog: Well, of course, for monsters, what

speaker_heading: GRAMPA MIKE

speaker_heading: DRACULA
dialog: Perfect. I mean, I hate to see

speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: DRACULA

speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: It’s my daddy's family. They’re

speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: DRACULA
dialog: This is your vampire costume? What
dialog: were you thinking?
scene_heading: HT2-RS/AS 3rd draft rev 4/11/14 97.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY

speaker_heading: JOHNNY

speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: Nice to meet you don’t hurt me.
speaker_heading: VLAD
dialog: Yipe. Were you buried that big or

speaker_heading: FRANKENSTEIN

speaker_heading: FRANKENSTEIN (CONT’D)
text: This is Dracula’s son-in-law...
speaker_heading: VLAD
dialog: Johnny?!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (big accent)
dialog: I...am Count Jonafang! Bleh blehhh -

speaker_heading: VLAD
dialog: What’s on your head? It looks like

text: Vlad looks perplexed as Dracula call over.
speaker_heading: DRACULA
dialog: Two minutes, Dad!
speaker_heading: VLAD
dialog: Ah, okay.
text: Vlad walks over to the stage and starts setting up the ritual
text: sacrifice. Dracula is prepping the Cakey Guy, who’s almost in
dialog: costume.
speaker_heading: DRACULA
dialog: Okay, we’re ready to go, just one
dialog: more thing --
speaker_heading: CAKEY GUY
dialog: Make it quick.
speaker_heading: DRACULA
dialog: Sure. You just have to stand in
dialog: this one spot. The whole time.
text: Dracula stands in one spot. Right in front of him, Vlad has
text: just finished setting up thirteen red candles. Vlad mumbles
text: to himself as he sprinkles some items...
speaker_heading: VLAD
dialog: Mugwort...mustard seeds...ancient
dialog: earth...blood...
scene_heading: HT2-RS/AS 3rd draft rev 4/11/14 101.
speaker_heading: DRACULA
dialog: Hey, Frank, you might wanna leave..
dialog: (indicating candles)
dialog: ...ire-fay.
speaker_heading: FRANKENSTEIN
dialog: Oh...right...et me know when the
dialog: sacrifice is over-lay.
text: Dracula cringes.
speaker_heading: FRANKENSTEIN (CONT’D)
dialog: Still not right?
speaker_heading: CAKEY GUY
dialog: Okay, one spot? That’s a nonstarter,
dialog: dude. Cakey’s all about movement,
dialog: and flow, I do the Cakey shuffle,
dialog: it’s my big finish.
speaker_heading: DRACULA
dialog: I know, but it’s the acoustics.
dialog: They can’t hear you unless you’re
dialog: right here. See? Now --
text: He steps off the spot and fakes like he’s talking but without
text: sound. Mouths “you can’t hear me.) But now --” and steps back.
speaker_heading: DRACULA (CONT'D)
dialog: You hear me perfectly.
text: He demonstrates quickly a couple more times.
speaker_heading: CAKEY GUY
dialog: Okay. None of these parents better
dialog: review this on Yelp.
speaker_heading: DRACULA
dialog: You have my word as a Vampire.
speaker_heading: CAKEY GUY
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: DRACULA
dialog: Come on. A monster always shares.
speaker_heading: CAKEY GUY
dialog: Whatever.
speaker_heading: DRACULA
text: Johnny, start the show. Cakey time.
text: Johnny has Linda in a headlock. He lets go.
scene_heading: HT2-RS/AS 3rd draft rev 4/11/14 102.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Cakey? But I said the big kids
dialog: won't like--
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (nervous )
dialog: ‘kay, Drac! It’s all good, it’s all
dialog: good. Kids, everyone, have a seat.
dialog: You're gonna love this, because...
dialog: Dennis has a big surprise for
dialog: everyone. The one and only - Cakey
dialog: the Cake Monster!
text: Some younger kids cheer loudly (while the kids Dennis’ age
text: are less enthused) as Cakey enters and steps right on his
dialog: mark.
speaker_heading: CAKEY
dialog: Hey kids! It’s me, Cakey! What a
dialog: wonderful Cakey Day it is!
text: The KIDS are mostly unimpressed except for a few small ones,
text: and Winnie, who smiles encouragingly.
speaker_heading: CAKEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, I have a question. Who here,
dialog: loves cake?
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: (mixed energy)
dialog: Meeee...
text: Vlad slowly starts walking on the stage.
speaker_heading: VLAD
dialog: I love cake...
speaker_heading: CAKEY GUY
dialog: Whuh? Dude, what are you doin’ on
dialog: my stage?
speaker_heading: VLAD
dialog: Rise!
text: Cakey levitates. He floats toward the candles.
speaker_heading: CAKEY GUY
dialog: Whoa, whoa, whoa, dude, what are
dialog: you levitating me for? You’re
dialog: ruining my flow.
speaker_heading: VLAD
dialog: Rise!!
scene_heading: HT2-RS/AS 3rd draft rev 4/11/14 103.
text: Suddenly Vlad intensifies the flames from the candles, which
text: form a circle around Cakey.
speaker_heading: CAKEY GUY
dialog: Whoa, why the flames, man? This
dialog: costume’s hot enough!
speaker_heading: COUSINS
dialog: Yes! Awesome! Burn Cakey!
speaker_heading: DRACULA
dialog: You got ‘em right where you want
dialog: them, Cakey! Crowd’s loving it!
speaker_heading: CAKEY GUY
dialog: You're freaking me out, man!
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: Cakey? You okay?!
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: What’s going on?
dialog: Dracula gets nervous...
speaker_heading: VLAD
text: Cast off the poison spirit of
text: Cakey! “Beware!" scream the ravens
dialog: of the night!
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Johnny, who is that guy?!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Oh, it’s just your Dad’s, uh, Dad.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: What??! I have a grandfather?!
text: The fires grow closer to Cakey! But Cakey can’t escape
text: Vlad’s grip.
speaker_heading: CAKEY GUY
dialog: Aaaaugghhh! Dude, put me down right
dialog: now and you only have to pay half!
speaker_heading: VLAD
dialog: (ignoring him)
dialog: Bring forth the Vampyre in this
dialog: fangless child, that he may sustain
dialog: your diabolic will for generations!
scene_heading: HT2-RS/AS 3rd draft rev 4/11/14 104.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Cakey! No! Don’t hurt him!!
speaker_heading: DRACULA
dialog: Stop it!
text: Dracula extinguishes the flames to Vlad’s surprise. Everyone
text: stares for a moment.
speaker_heading: CAKEY GUY
dialog: ‘kay, I’m leaving! This was bogus!
text: Realizing he’s still levitating, Cakey Guy starts “swimming”
text: out of the room.
speaker_heading: VLAD
dialog: What did you just do?
speaker_heading: DRACULA
dialog: It’s not worth it!!
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: What’s not worth it?
speaker_heading: DRACULA
dialog: I was trying one last time to make
dialog: Dennis a vampire so you’d stay!
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: By sacrificing Cakey!? How could you
dialog: do that? When will you ever let go?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Let go of what? Dennis won’t be
dialog: happy in my town!
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Dennis hasn’t been there!
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: I said we shouldn’t get Cakey...
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: You know he won’t fit in there!
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Johnny, he’s not a monster!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: He’d rather be here!
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: He likes avocado!

speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Cuz he’s never eaten anything fun!
speaker_heading: DRACULA
dialog: He had fun with me!
speaker_heading: GRANDMA LINDA
dialog: Johnny, I think Dennis just wants
dialog: to be normal!
speaker_heading: GRAMPA MIKE
dialog: Don’t say that! He is normal!
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Can we stop using the word normal?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Where we live now he’s normal!
text: Suddenly, Dennis leaves and no one notices except Winnie. She
text: joins him and they run off.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: He really isn’t!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Well he won’t be happy there!
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: He is who he is! And you can’t
dialog: change him!
speaker_heading: DRACULA
dialog: I don’t want to change him! I don’t
dialog: care anymore if he’s a vampire! I
dialog: just want you all to stay!
speaker_heading: VLAD
dialog: You don’t care about the shame he
dialog: brings you? What’s become of you,
dialog: son?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Hey, back off, old man!!
speaker_heading: DRACULA
dialog: Johnny, be cool.
