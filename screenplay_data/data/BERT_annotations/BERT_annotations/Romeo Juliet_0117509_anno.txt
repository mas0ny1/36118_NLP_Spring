scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: A ribbon of freeway stretching into a blue and pink late
text: afternoon sky. A huge dark sedan, windows tinted gold,
text: headlights blazing, powers directly for us.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: A heavy, low-slung, pickup truck traveling toward
dialog: the sedan.
dialog: 
text: WIDE SHOT: Sky, freeway, the cars closing.
dialog: 
text: TIGHT ON: The sedan.
dialog: 
text: TIGHT ON: The pickup.
dialog: 
text: Like thunderous, jousting opponents, the cars pass in a
text: deafening cacophony of noise.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: TIGHT ON: The fat face of GREGORY, yelling at the
text: disappearing sedan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREGORY
text: A dog of the house of Capulet moves
dialog: me!
dialog: 
text: He and the pimply-faced front-seat passenger, SAMPSON,
text: explode with laughter.
dialog: 
text: The red-haired driver BENVOLIO, keeps his eyes on the road.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EXIT RAMP. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: The truck spirals down an exit ramp and screeches into busy
text: driveway of a large gas station.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: Attendants immediately run to the truck. Two clean
text: windshields and duco, the third fills the gas tank.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: Gregory in the back seat is boasting outrageously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: A dog of that house shall move me
dialog: to stand. I will take the wall of
dialog: any man or maid of Capulets.
dialog: 
dialog: Sampson, sarcastically.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMPSON
dialog: That shows thee a weak slave. For
text: the weakest goes to the wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: 'Tis true; and therefore women,
dialog: being the weaker vessels, are ever
dialog: thrust to the wall. Therefore, I
dialog: will push Capulet's men from the
text: wall, and thrust his maids to the
dialog: wall.
dialog: 
text: Benvolio, disgusted, gets out of the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: The quarrel is between our masters...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: (yelling after him)
dialog: ...and us their men.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: FOLLOW: Benvolio as he heads for the bathroom.
dialog: 
text: PICK UP: A mother wrangling three little boys out of a
text: station wagon - the smallest kid carries a toy pistol.
dialog: 
text: SUPER FAST SCAN TRACK: Past the mother to - the huge black
text: sedan pulling up outside the gas station mini-mart.
dialog: 
text: The front door of the sedan opens. Shiny black boots -
text: decorated with tiny, silver, cat-shaped spurs - plant
text: themselves on the ground. The boots are joined by two other
text: pairs of well-shod feet.
dialog: 
text: HOLD: The spurred boots move out of frame.
dialog: 
text: CRANE UP: The other feet belong to a tough-looking Latin
text: youth ABRA - and his goateed side-kick PETRUCHIO.
dialog: 
text: Abra and Petruchio enter the mini-mart, as four white-clad
dialog: girls exit.
dialog: 
text: FOLLOW: The girls as they head for their car.
dialog: 
text: SUPER FAST SCAN TRACK: Past the girls to:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: Sampson is trying to out boast Gregory.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMPSON
dialog: I will show myself a tyrant. When
dialog: I have fought with the men I will
dialog: be civil with the maids, I will cut
dialog: off their heads.
dialog: 
text: Gregory; mock outrage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: The heads of the maids?
dialog: 
text: Sampson leers lecherously at the girls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMPSON
dialog: Ay, the heads of the maids, or
dialog: their maiden heads, take it in what
dialog: sense thou wilt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: They must take it in sense that
dialog: feel it.
dialog: 
text: Gregory and Sampson pump up the song on the sound system and
text: sing out at the girls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREGORY/SAMPSON
speaker_heading: (SINGING)
dialog: I am a pretty piece of flesh!
dialog: I am a pretty piece of flesh!
dialog: Me, they shall feel while I am able
dialog: to stand;
dialog: I am a pretty piece of flesh!
dialog: 
text: The girls, pretending not to notice, get into the car.

scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - MINIMART. AFTERNOON.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Sampson - Their singing abruptly halts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMPSON
dialog: Here comes of the House of Capulet.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: Abra and Petruchio stare coldly toward the boys.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Sampson swallowing hard.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Gregory; eyes locked to the Capulets. With fake
text: bravado he nudges Sampson.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: Quarrel I will back thee.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Sampson trying to quell his rising panic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMPSON
dialog: Let us take the law of our sides.
dialog: Let them begin.
dialog: 
text: SUDDENLY: BANG! Gregory and Sampson jump.
dialog: 
text: WHIP PAN: It was the garage attendant slamming the hood.
dialog: 
text: Gregory and Sampson are mortally embarrassed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MINI-MART. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: Abra and Petruchio laugh contemptuously and move to their
speaker_heading: CAR:

dialog: 
scene_heading: SUPER FAST SCAN TRACK: To...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: Sampson furiously tries to save face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMPSON
dialog: I will bite my thumb at them; which
dialog: is a disgrace to them if they bear
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: Sampson quickly bites his thumb toward Abra's back as he
text: gets into the sedan.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SEDAN. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: Abra's eyes flick to the rear view mirror.
dialog: 
text: E.C.U.: The rear view mirror; Sampson biting his thumb.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, a blood curdling screech of tires - the sedan,
text: rubber burning, reverses full speed toward Sampson and
dialog: Gregory.
dialog: 
text: The mother in the station wagon brakes to avoid collision -
text: a sports car shunts into her vehicle. Mother and children
dialog: scream.
dialog: 
text: Attendants scatter.
dialog: 
text: The Capulet car shudders to a halt inches from the truck,
text: blocking its path.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BLACK SEDAN. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: A scurry of limbs scrabbling across seats and
text: reaching for door handles;
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: Abra hauls Sampson from the truck. Gregory leaps out,
text: Petruchio covers him. Abra slams Sampson against the side of
text: the vehicle - then, goading him to go for his gun, screams:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
dialog: 
text: Sampson's shaking hand hovers - ready to draw.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMPSON
dialog: I do bite my thumb, sir.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STATION WAGON. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: The panicked mother in the station wagon. She
text: motions her children to the floor.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: Customers run for cover.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Abra: An hysterical rage; he shrieks:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Do you bite you thumb at us, sir?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMPSON
dialog: (sweating, murmurs to Gregory)
dialog: Is the law on our side if I say "Ay"?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: No.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: The black cowboy boots, trousers down around them.
text: The sound of a toilet flushing.
dialog: 
text: PAN TO: The next cubicle, the door opens revealing Benvolio.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Sampson, still sweating.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMPSON
dialog: No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at
dialog: you, sir - but I do bite my thumb,
dialog: sir!
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Gregory; a ridiculous inquiry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: Do you quarrel, sir?
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Abra; a dangerous smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Quarrel sir, no sir.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Sampson; unconvincing bravado...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMPSON
dialog: But if you do, sir, I am for you. I
dialog: serve as good a man as you.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Abra; a lethal question.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: No better?
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Sampson, trapped.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMPSON
dialog: Well sir...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STATION WAGON. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Inside the station wagon. The mother does not
text: notice her five year old aiming a toy gun toward the boys.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Gregory's P.O.V.: Benvolio emerging from the
text: bathroom - he whispers maniacally.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: Here comes our kinsman. Say better!
dialog: 
text: EXTREME CLOSE UP: Sampson; he screams:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMPSON
dialog: YES SIR, BETTER!
dialog: 
text: EXTREME CLOSE UP: Abra demonically roars:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABRA
speaker_heading: THOU LIEST!
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Benvolio. Terror stricken, he sees the boys.
dialog: 
text: DISTORTED OUT OF CONTROL CLOSE UP: Abra shrieks:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: DRAW IF YOU BE MEN!
dialog: 
text: LIGHTNING CUT: Four hands reaching for guns.
dialog: 
text: SLAM ZOOM: To Benvolio - weapon outstretched he screams:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: Part, fools! You know not what you
dialog: do!
dialog: 
text: MUSIC STING; A SUPER MARCO SLAM ZOOM along the barrel of
text: Benvolio's gun; the engraved gun type reads:
dialog: 
dialog: 'Sword 9mm series S'
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Benvolio. He screams in desperation:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: Put up your swords!
dialog: 
text: Gregory, Sampson, Abra, and Petruchio freeze. A moment -
text: then from behind, the unmistakable sound of a gun being
dialog: cocked.
dialog: 
text: EXTREME CLOSE UP: The black cowboy boots.
dialog: 
text: CRANE UP: To find the dark cold eyes and feline smile, of
text: the wearer of the boots. His name is TYBALT; a cigarette is
text: clenched between his teeth and his gun is aimed at Benvolio's
dialog: head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYBALT
dialog: What, art thou drawn amoung these
dialog: heartless hinds?
dialog: Turn thee Benvolio.
dialog: 
dialog: Benvolio, a choked explanation:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: I do but keep the peace.
dialog: 
text: A mocking smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYBALT
dialog: Peace? I hate the word
dialog: As I hate hell, all Montagues, and...
dialog: 
text: EXTREME CLOSE UP: Tybalt's finger squeezing the trigger...
dialog: 
text: Suddenly we hear firing from Tybalt's blind side.
dialog: 
text: Tybalt redirects his weapon, cracking off a single shot at
text: the surprise attacker.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT./INT. MINIMART. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: It is the five year old from the station wagon. The bullet
text: smacks the toy gun from the child's hand, shattering the
text: wagon's window.
dialog: 
text: Mother and children scream.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: A panicked Benvolio falls back, accidentally his gun fires -
text: the bullet whistles past Tybalt's head.
dialog: 
text: Tybalt combat rolls, and using a screaming car load of girls
text: as cover, returns two quick shots, narrowly missing Benvolio.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: The gas station attendant hits a button and heavy metal
text: screens slam down.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Gregory firing - a bullet rips through Abra's arm.
dialog: 
text: Petruchio dives for cover; Gregory and Sampson leap into
text: Benvolio's truck. Rubber burns as they smash past the
text: Capulet vehicle.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Tybalt taking aim.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - SUPERMARKET. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: His first shot plugs the fuel tank, the second a tire. Out
text: of control and spewing gasoline the Montague truck careens
text: across the highway and through the glass front of a
dialog: supermarket.
dialog: 
text: Gregory and Sampson throw themselves from the truck moments
dialog: before...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SUPERMARKET. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: The gas tank erupts into an almighty fireball.
dialog: 
text: The screen fills with flame: the following images combust in
dialog: front of us:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - SUPERMARKET - FROM AIR. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: NEWS CHOPPER P.O.V.: Citizens run in the streets.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: A table of dark suited men and their wives.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: The powerful 60 year old face of FULGENCIO CAPULET.
text: Seated next to him is his much younger wife GLORIA.
dialog: 
text: SUDDENLY: Windows explode in a tidal wave of glass. Diners
dialog: take cover.
dialog: 
text: Capulet moves fearlessly toward the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: (to a waiter)
dialog: Give me my long sword!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: The word MONTAGUE fills the screen.
dialog: 
text: PULL BACK: We see the word is the number plate of a large
text: black limousine.
dialog: 
text: The limousine is stuck in the traffic snarl - bullets bounce
text: off its bullet proof windshield.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MONTAGUE'S LIMOUSINE. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: TED MONTAGUE, a 60 year old red-faced bulldog of a man,
text: bursts from the back of the limousine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONTAGUE
dialog: What noise is this!
dialog: 
text: As Ted draws an enormous pearl handed revolver, CAROLINE,
text: his conservatively dressed wife, tries to restrain him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Thou shalt not stir one foot to
dialog: seek a foe!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONTAGUE
dialog: (shrugging her off)
dialog: Hold me not, let me go!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Crouched behind a truck, Benvolio shakily tries to re-load.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: The barrel of Tybalt's gun enters frame and
text: presses into Benvolio's forehead. Tybalt whispers sweetly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYBALT
dialog: Look upon thy death, Benvolio.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Tybalt's finger on the trigger. Benvolio screams
text: a scream of mortal horror.
dialog: 
text: SUDDENLY Tybalt is blinded by a burning shaft of light. A
text: magnificently powerful helicopter gunship hovers above him.
text: A command booms from the chopper's public address system.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN PRINCE
dialog: (over PA)
dialog: Rebellious subjects, enemies to
dialog: peace,
dialog: Throw your mistempered weapons to
dialog: the ground.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHOPPER. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: The steely gray eyes of CAPTAIN PRINCE, chief of
text: the Verona Beach Police Department. He lifts the microphone
text: and repeats the command.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN PRINCE
dialog: Throw your mistempered weapons to
dialog: the ground!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VERONA BEACH. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Tybalt looks up to the chopper. Patrol cars screech to a
dialog: halt.
dialog: 
text: An almighty orchestral chord.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VERONA BEACH - MATTE SHOT. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: SUPER WIDE SHOT: A trail of devastation winds up through
text: grid-locked traffic to the burning supermarket.
dialog: 
text: In the distance looms an enormous statue of Christ flanked
text: by two glass towers. We push toward the towers. One is
text: neon-crowned MONTAGUE, the other, CAPULET.
dialog: 
dialog: We hear:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
text: Two households, both alike in
dialog: dignity.
dialog: In fair Verona, where we lay our
speaker_heading: SCENE
dialog: From ancient grudge break to new
dialog: mutiny,
dialog: Where civil blood makes civil hands
dialog: unclean.
dialog: From forth the fatal loins of these
dialog: two foes
text: A pair of star crossed lovers take
dialog: their life.
dialog: Whose misadventured piteous
speaker_heading: OVERTHROWS
dialog: Doth with their death bury their
text: parents strife.
dialog: 
text: A dark chord.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VERONA BEACH SKYLINE. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: A swarm of helicopters thunder into frame. We see
text: compressed, time-lapsed, images of their journey.
dialog: 
text: SLAM INTO: A coat of arms that labels a large tower - the
dialog: emblem reads; "Verona Beach Police Department: In God We
dialog: Trust".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLD:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAPTAIN PRINCE'S PRECINCT OFFICE. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Captain Prince's grim features. He eyes Capulet
dialog: and Montague.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN PRINCE
text: Three civil brawls, bred of an airy
speaker_heading: WORD
dialog: By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
dialog: Have thrice disturbed the quiet of
dialog: our streets.
dialog: 
text: Capulet's lawyer tries to intervene.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: My noble Prince I can...
dialog: 
text: Captain Prince overriding, slams the desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN PRINCE
dialog: If ever you disturb our streets
dialog: again,
dialog: Your lives shall pay the forfeit of
dialog: the peace.
dialog: 
text: Hold on Captain Prince's determined gaze.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VERONA STREET. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: A majestic sunrise; Ted Montague's limousine sulks through
text: deserted streets. In the distance, Jesus looks out over the
text: now peaceful city.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MONTAGUE'S LIMOUSINE. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: Ted Montague, his wife Caroline, and nephew Benvolio ride in
text: uncomfortable silence.
dialog: 
text: Caroline finally speaks her anger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: O where is Romeo? Saw you him
dialog: today?
dialog: (pointedly to Montague)
dialog: Right glad I am he was not at this
dialog: fray.
dialog: 
text: Montague snorts derisively and stares out the window.
text: Embarrassed, Benvolio tries to be of assistance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: Madam, underneath The Grove of
speaker_heading: SYCAMORE
dialog: So early walking did I see your son.
dialog: 
text: Ted Montague speaks with contempt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONTAGUE
dialog: Many a morning hath he there been
speaker_heading: SEEN
text: With tears augmenting the fresh
text: morning's dew.
dialog: 
text: Caroline struggles to contain her emotion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Away from light steals home my
dialog: heavy son
dialog: And private in his chamber pens
dialog: himself,
text: Shuts up his windows, locks fair
dialog: daylight out
dialog: And makes himself an artificial
dialog: night.
dialog: 
text: Montague barks into the car intercom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONTAGUE
dialog: Westward from this city side.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: The limousine U-turns heading west.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: To the melancholic strains of Mozart's "Serenade for Winds",
text: we see a blond nineteen year old boy sitting alone on an
text: empty beach.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: The boy, ROMEO. Looking out over the ocean he
text: sucks on the last of a cigarette and then writes intensely
text: in a small worn note book.
dialog: 
text: We hear his voice over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (V/O)
text: Love is a smoke made with the fume
dialog: of sighs;
text: Being purged, a fire sparkling in
dialog: lovers' eyes;
text: Being vexed, a sea nourished with
text: lovers' tears.
dialog: What is it else? A madness most
dialog: discreet,
text: A choking gall and a preserving
dialog: sweet.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MONTAGUE'S LIMOUSINE. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: The limo is parked in a cross street that runs down to the
dialog: beach.
dialog: 
text: Opposite the limo, young diehard clubbers, faded drag queens
text: and street people, hang outside a dilapidated nightclub. A
text: broken neon sign reads: "The Grove of Sick Amore."
dialog: 
text: Ted, Caroline and Benvolio sit watching the silhouette of
text: Romeo on the beach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONTAGUE
dialog: Black and portentous must this
dialog: humour prove
dialog: Unless good counsel may the cause
dialog: remove.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: P.O.V.: From the limousine. Romeo rises and listlessly
text: makes his way up the beach - seeing his father's car he
text: turns and heads for the path that hugs the beach front.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MONTAGUE'S LIMOUSINE. DAWN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: So please you step aside.
dialog: I'll know his grievance or be much
dialog: denied.
dialog: 
text: Benvolio clambers out of the limo.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Montague, an encouraging smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONTAGUE
dialog: Come Madam. Let's away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: The limousine pulls away and Benvolio heads after Romeo. He
text: pauses. A deck at the rear of "Sick Amore" sprawls onto the
text: beach. At the base of the deck, Benvolio can see Romeo
text: squatting in discussion with an old drunk. Benvolio
text: approaches with a not very convincing casualness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: Good morrow, cousin.
dialog: 
text: Romeo turns. Sore, red, unfriendly eyes squint back at
dialog: Benvolio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Is the day so young?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: But new struck, Coz.
dialog: 
text: Romeo rises, Benvolio follows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Ay me! Sad hours seem long.
dialog: 
text: Romeo stops as if taking in Benvolio for the first time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
dialog: Was that my father that went hence
dialog: so fast?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
speaker_heading: (GUILTY)
dialog: It was.
dialog: 
text: Benvolio chases Romeo down the path which divides the beach
text: from a string of cheap souvenir shops and sleazy bars.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Not having that which having makes
dialog: them short.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: In love?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: Of love?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Out of her favor where I am in love.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: Alas that love, so gentle in his
dialog: view,
dialog: Should be so tyrannical and rough
dialog: in proof!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Alas that love, whose view...
dialog: 
text: Romeo is halted by the sight of last night's disturbance
text: displayed on a small TV screen in an outdoor bar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
dialog: What fray was here?
dialog: 
text: Benvolio starts to reply.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
speaker_heading: (ANGRILY)
dialog: Yet tell me not, for I have heard
dialog: it all.
dialog: Here's much to do with hate, but
dialog: more with love.
dialog: 
text: Romeo turns the corner away from the beach. He strides
text: along the sidewalk raging.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
dialog: Why then, O brawling love, O loving
dialog: hate,
dialog: O anything, of nothing first
dialog: create!
dialog: O heavy lightness, serious vanity,
text: Misshapen chaos of well-seeming
dialog: forms,
text: Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold
dialog: fire, sick health,
dialog: Still-waking sleep, that is not
dialog: what it is!
dialog: 
text: Romeo screams at a huge bouncer who lounges in the doorway
dialog: of a sex club.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
dialog: This love feel I, that feel no love
dialog: in this!
dialog: 
text: The bouncer's hand moves to his gun. Romeo, ignoring him,
text: turns on Benvolio. A mocking laughter through tears:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
dialog: Dost thou not laugh?
dialog: 
text: Benvolio, nervously eyeing the bouncer, shepherds Romeo out

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: No, coz, I rather weep.
dialog: 
text: Romeo smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Farewell, my coz.
dialog: 
text: Romeo, breaking into a jog, leaves Benvolio behind. Benvolio
text: pursues him down the street.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ROMEO'S CAR. DAY.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: The sleeping face of a fourteen year old boy -
speaker_heading: BALTHASAR.
dialog: 
text: PULL BACK: Balthasar sleeps on the hood of a magnificent
dialog: silver car.
dialog: 
text: Three or four kids doze on the sidewalk. As Romeo
text: approaches, they jump up and begin vigorously polishing the
text: already gleaming car.
dialog: 
text: Balthasar wakes. He springs off the hood, chases the kids
text: away, then, producing a huge bunch of keys, opens the car
dialog: door for Romeo.
dialog: 
text: Benvolio intercepts Romeo at the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: Tell me in sadness, who is it that
dialog: you love.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: In sadness, cousin, I do love...a
dialog: woman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: I aimed so near when I supposed you
dialog: loved.
dialog: 
text: Romeo leans against the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: A right good marksman; and she's
dialog: fair I love.
dialog: 
text: Romeo pulls his shirt down to reveal a small shoulder tattoo.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: The tattooed word; ROSALINE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: Rosaline!
dialog: (he is impressed)
dialog: A right fair mark, fair coz, is
dialog: soonest hit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: She'll not be hit with Cupid's
dialog: arrow.
dialog: She hath Dian's wit,
dialog: And in strong proof of chastity
dialog: lives well armed.
dialog: 
dialog: Benvolio can't believe it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: Then she hath sworn that she will
dialog: still live chaste?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: She hath; and in that sparing makes
dialog: huge waste.
dialog: 
dialog: Benvolio - a plan.
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: Be ruled by me; forget to think of
dialog: her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: O, teach me how I should forget to
dialog: think!
dialog: 
text: Benvolio indicates one of the working girls already strutting
dialog: the foot path.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
dialog: Examine other beauties.
dialog: 
text: Romeo laughs dismissively. He throws the kids a few coins
text: and slides into the drivers seat. Balthasar jumps in back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Farewell. Thou canst not teach me
dialog: to forget.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: I'll pay that doctrine, or else die
dialog: in debt.
dialog: 
text: Benvolio leaps into the passenger seat of the moving vehicle.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAPULET OFFICE. DAY.
dialog: 
text: An orchestral fanfare. TRACK DOWN: Past monstrous letters
text: that read CAPULET and in through a window to discover
text: Fulgencio Capulet. He stares out the window toward the
text: other tallest building in Verona; the one crested with the
speaker_heading: word MONTAGUE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: But Montague is bound as well as I,
dialog: In penalty alike;
dialog: 
text: Capulet turns: on the other side of his desk sits DAVID
text: PARIS; a square-jawed young man in a red cashmere sweater.
text: Tea has been served from an exquisite silver tea service.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET (CONT.)
dialog: And 'tis not hard, I think, for me
dialog: so old as we to keep the peace.
dialog: 
text: Dave smiles obligingly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Of honorable reckoning are you
dialog: both,
dialog: And pity 'tis you lived at odds so
dialog: long.
dialog: 
text: An awkward pause: Dave sips tea, then, with a deep breath...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT.)
dialog: But now, my lord, what say you to
dialog: my suit?
dialog: 
text: Capulet considers the framed photograph on his desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: But saying o'er what I have said
speaker_heading: BEFORE;
dialog: My child is yet a stranger in the
speaker_heading: WORLD;
dialog: Let two more summers wither in
dialog: their pride,
dialog: Ere we may think her ripe to be a
dialog: bride.
dialog: 
text: Dave is politely insistent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Younger than she are happy mothers
dialog: made.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: (checking him hard)
dialog: And too soon marred are those so
dialog: early made.
dialog: Earth hath swallowed all my hopes
dialog: but she;
dialog: She is the hopeful lady of my earth.
dialog: 
text: Capulet rounds the desk and places a fatherly hand on Dave's
dialog: shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET (CONT.)
dialog: But woo her, gentle Paris, get her
dialog: heart.
dialog: My will to her consent is but a
dialog: part,
dialog: And she agreed, within her scope of
speaker_heading: CHOICE
dialog: Lies my consent and fair according
dialog: voice.
dialog: This night I hold an old Accustomed
dialog: feast.
dialog: 
text: Capulet leans close.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET (CONT.)
dialog: At my poor house, look to behold
dialog: this night,
dialog: Fresh female buds that make dark
dialog: heaven light.
dialog: Hear all; all see,
dialog: And like her most whose merit most
dialog: shall be.
dialog: 
text: Capulet smiles knowingly. Dave seems encouraged.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET (CONT.)
dialog: (a hearty slap)
dialog: Come go with me!
dialog: 
text: Capulet excitedly ushers Dave from the office.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POOL HALL. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Dim, smoke filled. Benvolio and Romeo play pool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: (chalking his cue)
dialog: Take thou some new infection to thy
dialog: eye.
dialog: 
text: He lines up the six ball top pocket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO (CONT.)
dialog: And the rank poison of the old will
dialog: die.
dialog: 
text: A hopeless shot that slams the eight ball toward the side
text: pocket. Romeo stops it with his hand and hurls it against
text: the other balls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
dialog: 
text: Romeo sinks the other balls with his hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Not mad, but bound more than a
dialog: madman is;
dialog: Shut up in prison, kept without my
dialog: food,
dialog: 
text: Romeo stalks away from the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
text: Whipped and tormented.
dialog: 
text: He stops at the gun check, rummaging in his pocket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Good day, good fellow.
dialog: 
text: A crusty old man looks up from the small television. His
text: entire face a tattooed shooting target, the bullseye between
text: his eyes.
dialog: 
text: The old man points to the sign that reads: "No ticket no
text: gun." Romeo finally produces a ticket. Crusty the Target
text: goes out back. Romeo's attention is caught by the television.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. T.V. STUDIO SET. DAY
dialog: 
scene_heading: CUT TO: TELEVISION.
dialog: 
text: An ostentatious woman and her over groomed partner Rich,
text: hosts what looks to be a kind of Entertainment Tonight show.
text: The graphic behind them reads "Solemnity Nights" with Susan
dialog: Santandiago and Rich Ranchidis.
dialog: 
text: Susan speaks conspiratorially to camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Now I'll tell you without asking.
dialog: The great
dialog: Rich Capulet, holds an old
dialog: accustomed feast;
dialog: 
text: Rich chimes in:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICH
dialog: A fair Assembly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I Pray you sir can you read?
dialog: 
text: A list of names begins to scroll across the screen. Rich

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICH

dialog: daughters,
dialog: Signor Martino, the Lady Widow
dialog: Of Utruvio and her lovely nieces,

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POOL HALL. DAY.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Benvolio, he leans into Romeo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: At this same ancient feast of
speaker_heading: CAPULET'S
dialog: Sups the fair Rosaline; whom thou
dialog: so loves,
dialog: With all the admired beauties of
dialog: Verona.
dialog: Go thither, and with unattained eye
dialog: Compare her face with some that I
dialog: shall show,
dialog: And I will make thee think thy swan
text: a crow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: One fairer than my love?
dialog: 
text: Crusty returns. He hands the boys their guns.

speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
dialog: The all-seeing sun Ne'er saw her

scene_heading: CUT TO: TELEVISION.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: If you be not of the house of

dialog: Come and crush a cup of wine!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICH
dialog: Rest you merry!
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Romeo, he considers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: I'll go along, no such sight to be
dialog: shown.
dialog: But to rejoice in splendour of mine
dialog: own.
dialog: 
text: The boys move off.
dialog: 
text: PUSH IN ON: THE TELEVISION.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAPULET STATE. DAY.
dialog: 
text: An aerial shot of a magnificent island estate. An Italianate
text: wonder of Florentine architecture. Armed guards patrol the
text: grounds. The telecaption reads "Capulet Mansion."
dialog: 
text: The file tape loses its television quality. We sweep down
text: through manicured gardens, where workers prepare decorations
text: for tonight's celebrations, and into the house. The music
text: darkens and we hear the desperate calling of a girl's name.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: J U L I E T !
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAPULET MANSION - CORRIDOR. DAY.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: J U L I E T !
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM. DAY.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: The still, serene, submerged features of a
text: beautiful young girl. Dark floating hair gently frames the
text: face. Heavy liquid eyes stare up through the water.
dialog: 
text: We hear, though faintly, the calling:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: J U L I E T !
dialog: 
text: With a rush JULIET surfaces. As she gulps air, we realise
text: that she is in fact, in a bath.
dialog: 
text: We hear the calling loudly again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: J U L I E T !
dialog: 
text: Juliet listens. For a moment she is very still, then she
text: closes her eyes and slides back beneath the surface of the
dialog: water.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ENTRANCE HALL CAPULET MANSION. DAY.
dialog: 
text: A Gothic, unfriendly environment heavy with religious
text: iconography. The entrance hall is crowded with workers and
text: servants preparing for tonight's party.
dialog: 
text: Gloria Capulet fiddles with a short black wig in the hallway
text: mirror. She is attired in full Cleopatra costume.
dialog: 
text: Dissatisfied with the wig, she rips it from her head and
text: calls maniacally.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: J U L I E T !
dialog: 
text: Gloria is met by the NURSE, a fat, grandmotherly Hispanic
dialog: woman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA (CONT.)
dialog: Nurse, where's my daughter? Call
dialog: her forth to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: I bade her come. God forbid!
dialog: Where's this girl?
dialog: Juliet!
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: The top of the stairs. As if from nowhere, Juliet
text: has appeared. She wears a bathrobe and her hair is wet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
speaker_heading: (COOLLY)
dialog: Madam, I am here. What is you will.
dialog: 
text: Gloria, startled, sweeps up the stairs and shuffles her
text: daughter toward a doorway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: Nurse, give leave awhile, we must
dialog: talk in secret.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GLORIA'S DRESSING ROOM. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Gloria shepherds Juliet into her opulent dressing room and
text: closes the door. She circles with nervous vexation searching
text: for words, stops, then suddenly opens the door and yells out
dialog: to the Nurse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA (CONT.)
dialog: Nurse, come back again.
dialog: I have remembered me, thou's hear
dialog: our counsel.
dialog: 
text: The Nurse enters. Gloria, still refusing eye contact,
text: checks her appearance once more in the mirror. She takes a
text: hairbrush and, feigning pleasantness, intensely brushes her
dialog: hair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA (CONT.)
dialog: Nurse, thou knowest my daughter's
dialog: of a pretty age.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: (to Juliet)
dialog: Thou wast the prettiest babe that
dialog: e'er I nursed.
dialog: 
text: The hair brush clatters onto the dresser. A moment of tense
text: silence. Gloria grips herself and pours a sherry.
dialog: 
text: Back still turned, she speaks to her daughter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: By my count, I was your mother much
dialog: upon these years
dialog: That you are now a maid.
dialog: 
text: A nembutal twists like a pin in the corner of Gloria's mouth.
text: She slugs it down with the sherry and turns abruptly to face
dialog: Juliet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA (CONT.)
text: Thus then in brief, the valiant
dialog: Paris seeks you for his love.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Juliet; an uncomprehending stare.
dialog: 
text: The Nurse, caught off guard, tries to buoy the situation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: A man, young lady! Lady, such a
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: As all the world - why, he's a man
dialog: of wax.
dialog: 
text: The medication takes immediate effect upon Gloria. She
text: joins Juliet on the couch and coos in Paris's favour.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: Verona's summer hath not such a
dialog: flower.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a
dialog: very flower.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: This night you shall behold him at
dialog: our feast;
dialog: Read o'er the volume of young
dialog: Paris' face
dialog: And find delight writ there with
dialog: beauty's pen.
dialog: This precious book of love, this
dialog: unbound lover,
text: To beautify him only lacks a cover.
dialog: So shall you share all that he doth
dialog: possess,
dialog: By having him, making yourself no
dialog: less.
dialog: 
text: Gloria probes Juliet's thoughts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: Can you like of Paris' love?
dialog: 
text: Juliet, adept at negotiating her mother's strange moods,
text: chooses her words precisely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I'll look to like, if looking
dialog: liking move,
dialog: But no more deep will I endart mine
dialog: eye,
dialog: Than your consent gives strength to
dialog: make it fly.
dialog: 
text: PETER the chauffeur enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
text: Madam. The guests are come.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: (checks the mirror)
dialog: We follow thee.
dialog: 
text: She exits, Nurse in tow.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Juliet stares out the windows and across the water.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the Nurse's face leers into shot. She whispers
text: enthusiastically into Juliet's ear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Go girl, seek happy nights to happy
dialog: days.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Juliet's face.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAPULET MANSION. DAY/NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: JUMP CUT: Aerial shot of Capulet Mansion. We time lapse
text: from late afternoon to night; fairy lights illuminate,
text: guests appear, music swells, and a single incandescent
text: flare, explodes pink against the inky sky.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Romeo: his face glows pink. He is sitting on the
text: grubby shoreline of Verona Bay dressed as a boy King Arthur,
text: with fake chain mail and sword.
dialog: 
text: Romeo watches the dying flare sink into the bay. The sound
text: of the party drifts across the water. Balthasar, dressed as
text: Frankenstein's monster, touches a lighter to a large bong
text: and Romeo inhales smoke.
dialog: 
text: Behind them, Benvolio, drunk and dressed as a pizza, is
text: yelling at Gregory, who, dressed as a Viking, is trying to
text: cut slices off his pizza costume. Sampson, also dressed as
text: a Viking, sits in the back of a car. One arm is bandaged
text: and he swigs from a bottle.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the darkness is slashed by headlights. A reckless
text: sports car speeds toward the boys. Stereo screaming, the
text: car skids to a halt.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Music blares from the sound system. A silver
text: stilettoed foot emerges from the car and plants itself
text: firmly in the dirt.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: The boys, eyes wide with amazement.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Another stiletto follows the first. Guitar groans.
dialog: 
text: PAN: Slowly up a shapely pair of black stockinged legs, past
text: a hint of garter belt to a black sequined mini-skirt and up
text: over a muscular dark skinned stomach and tiny sequined bra
text: top, to discover: the 21 year old male, African American
text: face of MERCUTIO.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: The boys. Recovering from the initial shock, they
text: laugh and cat-call raucously.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Mercutio. He roughly jams a short black wig onto
text: his head and yells above the music.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: Strike drum!
dialog: 
text: Mercutio magically produces invitations from somewhere
text: within his mini-skirt and dances down the beach to the boys.
dialog: 
text: Aggressively bumping and grinding, Mercutio distributes the
text: invitations. Reaching Romeo, he declares:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: We'll on without apology.
dialog: 
text: Romeo lets the invitation fall to the sand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: I am not for this ambling.
dialog: Being but heavy, I will bear the
dialog: light.
dialog: 
text: Romeo pulls on the bong once more.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Mercutio is upon Romeo. Hauling him to his feet,
text: he waltzes him through the sand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you
dialog: dance.
dialog: 
text: Romeo pushes Mercutio away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Not I, believe me. You have
dialog: dancing shoes
dialog: With nimble soles. I have a soul
dialog: of lead.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio in mock sympathy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: Too great oppression for a tender
dialog: thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Is love a tender thing? It is too
dialog: rough, too rude, too boisterous,
text: and it pricks like thorn.
dialog: 
text: Romeo lies staring up at the stars.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: If love be rough with you, be rough
dialog: with love.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio jumps on Romeo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (CONT.)
dialog: Prick love for pricking, and you
dialog: beat love down.
dialog: 
text: Romeo fights Mercutio off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Under love's heavy burden do I sink!
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Benvolio, impatiently honking the horn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: Every man betake him to his legs!
dialog: 
text: Mercutio heads Romeo toward the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: Come, we burn daylight, ho!
dialog: 
text: Romeo pulls away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: But 'tis no wit to go.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio turns, exasperated.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: Why, may one ask?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: I dreamt a dream tonight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: And so did I.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Well, what was yours?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: That dreamers often lie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
text: In bed asleep, while they do dream
dialog: things true.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio produces a tiny gold pill case.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: O, then I see Queen Mab hath been
dialog: with you.
dialog: She is the fairies' midwife, and
dialog: she comes
text: In shape no bigger than an agate
speaker_heading: STONE
text: On the forefinger of an alderman,
text: Drawn with a team of little atomies
text: Over men's noses as they lie asleep.
dialog: 
text: Tantalisingly, he passes the case beneath Romeo's nose.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (CONT.)
text: Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
text: Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat.
dialog: 
text: With a conjurer's dexterity Mercutio extracts a small, gray
dialog: pill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (CONT.)
dialog: And in this state she gallops night
dialog: by night
text: Through lovers' brains, and then
dialog: they dream of love;
dialog: 
text: He palms the pills. It reappears from behind Romeo's ear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (CONT.)
dialog: O'er lawyers' fingers who straight
dialog: dream on fees;
dialog: O'er ladies' lips, who straight on
dialog: kisses dream,
dialog: Which oft the angry Mab with
text: blisters plagues.
dialog: Because their breaths with
dialog: sweetmeats tainted are.
dialog: 
text: The pill box glints in the moonlight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (CONT.)
dialog: Sometime she driveth o'er a
dialog: soldier's neck;
dialog: And then dreams he of cutting
text: foreign throats.
text: And being thus frighted, swears a
dialog: prayer or two
text: And sleeps again.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio now intensely angry:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (CONT.)
dialog: This is that very Mab
text: That plaits the manes of horses in
dialog: the night
text: And bakes the elf-locks in foul
dialog: sluttish hairs
dialog: 
text: He screams into the night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (CONT.)
text: This is the hag, when maids lie on
dialog: their backs,
text: That presses them and learns them
dialog: first to bear,
dialog: Making them women of good carriage.
dialog: This is she, this is she...
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Mercutio. He breaks off. There is a strange
text: stillness amongst the group. Romeo goes to his friend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace.
dialog: Thou talkest of nothing.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio meets Romeo's gaze.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: True, I talk of dreams;
dialog: Which are the children of an idle
dialog: brain,
text: Begot of nothing but vain fantasy.
dialog: Which is as thin of substance as
dialog: the air
dialog: And more inconstant than the wind,
dialog: who woos
text: Even now the frozen bosom of the
speaker_heading: NORTH
text: And, being angered, puffs away from
speaker_heading: THENCE
text: Turning his attention to the dew-
dialog: dropping south.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Benvolio in the car. The alcohol has caught up with
text: him and he looks a little queasy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: This wind you talk of blows us from
speaker_heading: OURSELVES:
dialog: Supper is done and we shall come
dialog: too late.
dialog: 
text: Romeo looks toward the distant city.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: I fear, too early, for my mind
speaker_heading: MISGIVES
dialog: Some consequence yet hanging in the
speaker_heading: STARS
text: Shall bitterly begin his fearful
speaker_heading: DATE
dialog: With this night's revels, and
dialog: expire the term
dialog: Of a despised life closed in my
dialog: breast,
dialog: By some vile forfeit of untimely
dialog: death.
dialog: 
text: PAUSE: The water turns golden as fireworks explode across
text: the bay. Romeo smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
dialog: But he that hath the steerage of my
speaker_heading: COURSE
dialog: Direct my sail!
dialog: 
text: He takes the pill and drops it into his mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
dialog: On, lusty gentlemen!
dialog: 
text: With the rush of a mind altering cocktail, we ZOOM IN on
text: Romeo's eyes; they shimmer with the shooting star reflection
text: of exploding fireworks - a bending Eastern chord, we launch
text: into Donna Summer's 'I Feel Love', sung by the vocalist from
text: Soundgarden with orchestration by 'Deconstruction' and sitar
dialog: by Ravi Shankar.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MERCUTIO'S CAR - ON FREEWAY. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: PULL OUT: From Romeo's eyes. He is lying in the passenger
text: seat of Mercutio's convertible as it rockets along the
text: freeway. The camera is directly above Romeo. He stares up
text: at the fireworks that reflect in the windshield. The car
text: and freeway begin to rotate and the camera follows. We feel
text: that the car is now travelling upside-down. The camera
text: sways through a brilliant explosion of fireworks that fill
text: the screen with a zillion pixilating, colored dots of fire.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAPULET'S MANSION - BALLROOM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: PULL OUT: To discover the glittering dots of fire refracting
text: from the sparkling domed roof of the magnificently ornate
text: Capulet Ballroom. The camera swoops down over bizarrely
text: costumed revellers cavorting to a driving Latin big band.
text: The camera partners with a drugged Mercutio and Benvolio who
text: shamelessly caper with each other in a mock antic adagio.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Romeo gazing blankly at the dance floor.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Mercutio. He sweeps up a thirty-something
text: sophisticate and twirls her in Romeo's direction.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: Everyman betake him to his legs!
dialog: 
text: Romeo moves off through the crowd.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: ROMEO'S P.O.V.: Contorted images of costumed guests
text: eat, drink and laugh in a grotesque collision of Yves Saint
text: Laurent cocktail party and Bacchanalian romp.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly a large arm coils around Romeo's neck.
dialog: 
text: DISTORTED EXTREME CLOSE UP: A seriously intoxicated Fulgencio
text: Capulet; his puffy red face squeezes against Romeo's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: Ah, I have seen the day that I
speaker_heading: COULD
dialog: Tell a whispering tale in a fair
dialog: ladies ear.
dialog: Such as would please.
dialog: 
text: Capulet screams above the music:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET (CONT.)
dialog: Come musicians play!
dialog: 
text: Blood drums in Romeo's ears. Breaking free from Capulet's
text: grasp as he pushes through the crowd toward the bathroom.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Silent, underwater shot. Romeo's tranquil features submerged
text: in a basin of water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAT.
dialog: 
text: With a gasp, Romeo rises. A moment. His breathing calms.
text: Then, smoothing water into his hair, he gazes into the
text: bathroom mirror. He turns:
dialog: 
text: The entire wall opposite the mirror, is a magnificent salt-
dialog: water fish tank.
dialog: 
text: Romeo, drawn by it's submarine beauty, leans against the
text: fish tank. Applause echoes faintly through the bathroom
dialog: speakers.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BALLROOM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: As the applause dies, a dark-haired Latina Diva takes the
text: spotlight. The band ease into the opening bars of a love
dialog: ballad.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: As the music swells, Romeo watches a moustached catfish
text: glide past a medieval castle.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Romeo pulls away. Peering back at him through the
text: castle is a pair of exquisitely beautiful angelic eyes.
dialog: 
text: The Diva's first pure, achingly beautiful notes soar.
dialog: 
text: Confused, Romeo looks again. There is no mistake - it is a
text: girl. Through a shimmering curtain of ribbon weed, two dark
text: wide eyes, a childish nose and sumptuous full lips.
dialog: 
text: Romeo pushes his face closer to the glass. The other face
text: snaps abruptly away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POWDER ROOM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Juliet, dressed as an angel, on the other side of
text: the tank. We now realise that the girls' powder room and
text: the boys' bathroom are divided by this watery wonder world.
dialog: 
text: Juliet warily moves closer to the glass.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Romeo leans his face against the glass. The love ballad
dialog: builds.
dialog: 
text: SLOW TRACK: From Romeo's profile, in through the water, and...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POWDER ROOM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: ...out the other side, to find Juliet in profile, peering
text: into the tank.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Romeo presses his nose lightly against the glass.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POWDER ROOM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Juliet; a tiny smile.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, CRASH! The door slams open. Juliet turns,
text: startled. It is the Nurse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Juliet, your mother calls.
dialog: 
text: The Nurse bustles Juliet out the door. Juliet looks over
text: her shoulder at the mystery boy.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BALLROOM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Romeo, now without his mask, slams out of the bathroom -
text: Juliet and the Nurse have disappeared into the crowd.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Juliet being dragged along by the Nurse. She
text: glances back toward the mystery boy, but he is gone.
dialog: 
text: Juliet and the Nurse rejoin Dave Paris, who is dressed as an
text: astronaut, and Gloria, at the side of the dance floor.
dialog: 
text: Dave, irresistible smile, extends his hand to Juliet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Will you now deny to dance?
dialog: 
text: Juliet looks to Dave, desperately searching for a reason to
text: decline. Gloria, brushing aside her silly daughter's
text: protests, slugs the last of her champagne and corrals them
text: onto the dance floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: (whispering to Juliet)
dialog: A man, young lady, such a man.
dialog: 
text: As Juliet is dragged onto the floor her eyes furtively
dialog: search for the boy.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Romeo in the crowd. Desperate to find the girl, he
text: roughly shunts aside a reveller dressed as Lucifer, Prince
dialog: of Darkness.
dialog: 
text: HOLD ON: Lucifer. He removes his mask: it is Tybalt. He
text: turns to Abra, who's dressed as a demon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYBALT
dialog: What, dares the slave come hither
dialog: to fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
dialog: Now by the stock and honor of my
speaker_heading: KIN
dialog: To strike him dead I hold it not a
dialog: sin.
dialog: 
text: Tybalt moves off aggressively, but is halted as Capulet
text: slams a hand into his chest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: Why how now kinsman, wherefore
dialog: storm you so?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYBALT
dialog: Uncle, this is that villain Romeo.
dialog: A Montague, our foe.
dialog: 
text: Capulet peers across the ballroom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: Young Romeo is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYBALT
dialog: 'Tis he.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: Content thee gentle coz, let him
dialog: alone.
dialog: I would not for the wealth of all
dialog: this town
dialog: Here in my house do him
text: disparagement.
dialog: Therefore be patient; take no note
dialog: of him.
dialog: 
text: Tybalt can't believe it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYBALT
dialog: I'll not endure him.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Capulet, exploding with rage.
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: He shall be endured!
dialog: (slapping Tybalt viciously)
dialog: What, goodman boy! I say he shall!
dialog: Go to.
dialog: 
text: Capulet violently shoves Tybalt to the ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
dialog: 
text: A middle aged couple look on shocked - Capulet waves to them
speaker_heading: FESTIVELY:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: What? Cheerly my hearts!
dialog: 
text: Capulet snorts at Tybalt in disgust.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: You'll not endure him! Am I the
dialog: master here or you? Go to.
dialog: 
text: Smoothing his hair into place, Capulet turns back into the
dialog: ballroom.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Tybalt choking back tears of rage.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Romeo moving through the crowd. For a moment the
text: crush clears and he spies the Angel on the dance floor.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Romeo whispers:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Did my heart love till now?
dialog: Forswear it, sight.
dialog: For I ne'er saw true beauty till
dialog: this night.
dialog: 
text: Romeo begins to circumnavigate the dance floor in an attempt
dialog: to get closer to Juliet.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Dave slow dancing with Juliet.
dialog: 
text: Juliet's eyes search the room for the boy.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON: Romeo.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON: Juliet.
dialog: 
text: Their eyes connect.
dialog: 
text: Juliet looks quickly back to Dave who, oblivious, returns
text: his most devastating smile.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: The songstress, her voice soars.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Juliet. Unable to look away from the boy, she
text: stares over Dave's shoulder.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Romeo. Ignoring the danger, he continues to move
text: toward the Angel.
dialog: 
text: With the Diva's spiralling final notes, the ballad concludes.
dialog: 
text: A complete black out. As the crowd break into wild applause,
text: Juliet's eyes search the darkness, but the boy is gone.
dialog: 
text: The crowd cheers and screams its applause. An avalanche of
text: balloons, tinsel and confetti rains down from the roof;
text: swathes of red silk drop from the ceiling and the space is
dialog: transformed.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Juliet, searching for the boy.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly: A gasp, Juliet's eyes widen, shocked.
dialog: 
text: In the dark, a hand has shot out from the drape curtaining
text: off the stage and clasped hers. Juliet barely dares breathe.
dialog: 
text: She glances furtively to Dave Paris - he watches the stage.
dialog: 
text: Slowly Juliet turns toward the hand; there through a break
text: in the curtain she can see eye, cheek and lips of the
text: mystery boy. As the Diva reprises the chorus, Romeo gently
text: pulls Juliet behind the curtain.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEHIND CURTAIN. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Concealed from the party by the red velvet drape, hands
text: still clasped, the teenagers are so close their bodies
text: almost touch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: If I profane with my unworthiest
speaker_heading: HAND
dialog: This holy shrine, the gentle sin is
dialog: this.
text: My lips, two blushing pilgrims,
dialog: ready stand
dialog: To smooth that rough touch with a
text: tender kiss.
dialog: 
text: Romeo moves his lips toward Juliet's. She stops him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Good pilgrim, you do wrong your
dialog: hand too much,
dialog: Which mannerly devotion shows in
dialog: this.
dialog: For saints have hands that pilgrim's
dialog: hands do touch,
dialog: And palm to palm is holy palmers'
dialog: kiss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Have not saints lips, and holy
dialog: palmers too?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: (a gentle scolding)
dialog: Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must
dialog: use in prayer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: O, then, dear saint, let lips do
dialog: what hands do,
dialog: They pray: grant thou, lest faith
text: turn to despair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Saints do not move, though grant
dialog: for prayer's sake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Then move not while my prayer's
dialog: effect I take.
dialog: 
text: He kisses her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
dialog: Thus from my lips, by thine my sin
text: is purged.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Then have my lips the sin that they
dialog: have took.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Sin from my lips? O trespass
dialog: sweetly urged!
dialog: Give me my sin again.
dialog: 
text: He kisses her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: You kiss by th' book.
dialog: 
text: They kiss again.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly a harsh light falls across the entwined couple.
text: They break apart - Nurse has pulled open the curtain and
text: stands eyeing them severely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Madam, your mother craves a word
dialog: with you.
dialog: 
text: We see that the party is breaking up. But for groups of
text: die-hard revellers, the room is nearly empty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE (CONT.)
dialog: Come, let's away.
dialog: 
text: She takes firm control of her charge.
dialog: 
text: Juliet furtively motions for the startled Romeo not to
text: follow as he trails them across the room.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: ROMEO'S P.O.V.: The Nurse and Juliet reach the door,
text: but instead of leaving, they turn and ascend the staircase
text: that arcs around to the mezzanine level. They join a vexed
text: Gloria Capulet who clings to a patient Dave Paris.
dialog: 
text: Inaudible words are exchanged. Juliet flickers her eyes
text: nervously to Romeo.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Romeo. He halts at the foot of the stairs unsure.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Gloria. Catching Juliet's interest in the boy, she
text: indicates to her daughter to 'COME ALONG'.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Romeo; a dawning realisation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Is she a Capulet?
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Juliet. She stops and turns back.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Romeo, comprehending the reality of who she is.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Juliet. The Nurse whispers in her ear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
dialog: The only son of your great enemy.
dialog: 
text: An orchestral treatment of Joy Division's "Love will tear us
dialog: Apart" swells;
dialog: 
text: HOLD ON: Juliet. Like a cloud passing across the sun, a
text: dark coldness descends upon her.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Mercutio. He throws himself upon the shell shocked
dialog: Romeo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: Away, begone, the sport is at its
dialog: best.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio shuttles Romeo toward the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Ay so I fear,
dialog: 
text: A covert glance over his shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
dialog: The more is my unrest.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio bundles Romeo through the front door and down the
text: stairs to the waiting getaway car.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAPULET MANSION - STAIRS ALCOVE WINDOW - NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Juliet. Manoeuvred by the Nurse up the stairs, she
text: breaks away and rushes to a tiny, windowed alcove.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAPULET MANSION - MAIN ENTRANCE. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Mercutio's convertible and its noisy confederacy
text: joining the line of departing limos.
dialog: 
text: A huge sign combusts into blinding fireworks that write in
text: giant words "CAPULET."
dialog: 
text: As the convertible passes beneath the blazing words, Romeo
text: turns. Through a deluge of falling sparks, he glimpses the
text: mystery girl high up in the tower.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAPULET MANSION - WINDOW. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Juliet leaning out of the tower window. Brilliant
text: sparkles light in her eyes.
dialog: 
text: PUSH IN: We hear her secret whisper:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: My only love, sprung from my only
dialog: hate.
dialog: Too early seen unknown, and known
dialog: too late.
dialog: Prodigious birth of love it is to me
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAPULET MANSION - MAIN ENTRANCE DRIVE. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: JULIET'S P.O.V.: In slow motion Romeo, through the
text: falling curtain of fiery embers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET (CONT.)(V/O)
dialog: That I must love a loathed enemy.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAPULET MANSION - WINDOW. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Warm wind blows the smoke from the expended fireworks.
text: Juliet closes the window and leans against the glass.
dialog: 
text: CRANE DOWN: The side of the building past revellers who
text: don't know when to leave. Standing in the front doorway is
text: someone else who cannot take their eyes off the departing
text: Romeo. It is Tybalt. The music darkens as we push through
text: the smoky wind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYBALT
dialog: I will withdraw. But this intrusion
dialog: shall,
text: Now seeming sweet, convert to
dialog: bitterest gall.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MERCUTIO'S CAR. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Caught in the jam of departing vehicles, Mercutio's car
text: crawls along the bridge that links Capulet island with the
text: mainland. The boys sing along raucously with the radio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: "I am a pretty piece of flesh,
dialog: I am a pretty piece of flesh..."
dialog: 
text: PUSH IN: On Romeo, he whispers:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Can I go forward when my heart is
dialog: here?
dialog: Turn back, dull earth, and find thy
dialog: centre out.
dialog: 
text: Romeo leaps from the car. Benvolio yells after him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: Romeo! Cousin Romeo! Romeo!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAPULET BRIDGE. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Romeo runs back along the bridge toward the estate. At the
text: gates, armed guards supervise the exodus of vehicles. Romeo
text: uses the traffic to shield himself from view.
dialog: 
text: Romeo leaps from the bridge and into the shadows at the base
text: of the high stone wall that borders the compound.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAPULET BRIDGE. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio's car prowls back along the bridge. The last
text: guests have departed and the gates are swinging shut. The
text: convertible halts in front of them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: He ran this way. Call, good
dialog: Mercutio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: Nay, I'll conjure too.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio leaps from the car. He postures like a magician in
text: a low-budget variety special. The boys cheer him on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: Romeo! Humours! Madman! Passion!
dialog: Lover!
dialog: I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright
dialog: eyes,
text: By her high forehead and her
dialog: scarlet lip,
text: By her fine foot, straight leg, and
text: quivering thigh.
dialog: And the demesnes that there adjacent
dialog: lie,
dialog: That in thy likeness thou appear to
dialog: us!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAPULET WALL. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Romeo's fake chain mail shirt tangled in the
text: barbed wire at the top of the wall.
dialog: 
text: PAN DOWN: Romeo, now on the other side of the wall, pulls up
text: his undershirt and gingerly inspects the cuts inflicted by
dialog: the wire.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio's cavorting echoes from the bridge. Romeo smiles
dialog: ironically.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
text: He jests at scars that never felt a
dialog: wound.
dialog: 
text: Romeo moves off through the darkened grounds of Capulet
dialog: estate.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAPULET BRIDGE. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: The boys laugh hysterically as Mercutio staggers around the
text: bridge in imitation of a love sick fool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: O Romeo, that she were, O that she
speaker_heading: WERE
dialog: An open-arse and thou a poperin pear!
dialog: 
text: The hilarity is abruptly arrested as a security spotlight
text: blazes to life, pinning Mercutio in its beam. The sound of
text: automatic weapons cocking pierces the night.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Mercutio. He's brave but not stupid. He gets
text: back into the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (CONT.)
dialog: Come, shall we go?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE BACK OF CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: A pair of stone cherubs on top of the retaining
text: wall of a terraced garden. Romeo's face appears between them.
dialog: 
text: Romeo hauls himself up onto the wall. Below is a Greco-
text: Roman style pool area. To the right the darkened rear wing
text: of Capulet Mansion. Suddenly the back of the house explodes
text: with light. Romeo takes cover.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: But soft, what light through yonder
dialog: window breaks?
dialog: 
text: Romeo's question is answered as out onto the verandah comes
text: Juliet. She is still clad in her angel robe, but without
text: the halo and wings. She slowly descends to pool level.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: It is the East, and Juliet is the
dialog: sun!
dialog: Arise, fair sun, and kill the
dialog: envious moon,
text: Who is already sick and pale with
speaker_heading: GRIEF
dialog: That thou her maid art far more
dialog: fair than she.
dialog: Be not her maid, since she is
text: envious.
text: Her vestal livery is but sick and
dialog: green,
dialog: And none but fools do wear it.
text: Juliet stands on the top step of the pool stairs. She is
text: directly below Romeo as he whispers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
dialog: Cast it off!
dialog: 
text: Juliet sits on the edge of the pool, her legs dangle in the
dialog: water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
dialog: It is my lady. O, it is my love!
dialog: O that she knew she were!
dialog: 
text: Juliet sighs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Ay me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
text: She speaks.
dialog: O, speak again, bright angel!
dialog: 
text: Juliet looks longingly toward the stars.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: O Romeo, Romeo! - Whyfore art thou
dialog: Romeo?
dialog: Deny thy father and refuse thy
dialog: name.
dialog: Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn
dialog: my love,
dialog: And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Romeo. Incredulous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Shall I hear more, or shall I speak
dialog: at this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
dialog: Thou are thyself, though not a
dialog: Montague.
dialog: What's Montague? It is not hand
dialog: nor foot
dialog: Nor arm nor face nor any other part
dialog: Belonging to a man. O, be some
dialog: other name!
dialog: What's in a name?
dialog: That which we call a rose
dialog: By any other word would smell as
dialog: sweet.
dialog: So Romeo would, were he not Romeo
dialog: called,
dialog: Retain that dear perfection which
dialog: he owes
dialog: Without that title. Romeo, doff
dialog: thy name,
dialog: And for thy name, which is no part
dialog: of thee,
dialog: Take all myself.
dialog: 
dialog: Romeo wildly calls:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: I take thee at thy word!
dialog: Call me but love, and I'll be new
text: baptised.
dialog: Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
dialog: 
text: Romeo jumps down from the wall. Juliet screams, and turns,
text: toppling backwards. Romeo grabs her hand but her momentum
text: overbalances him and they both plunge headlong into the pool.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAPULET MANSION - POOL - UNDERWATER. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Underwater shot: A slow motion phosphorescent tangle of
text: arms, legs and bodies.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAPULET MANSION - BACK GARDEN. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: A security guard. Alerted by the noise he moves
text: toward the pool area.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAPULET MANSION - POOL GARDEN - NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Above water, real time: Romeo and Juliet surface
text: spluttering. Juliet thrashes the water in an attempt to get
text: distance from her attacker.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: What man art thou that, thus
text: bescreened in night,
dialog: So stumblest on my counsel?
dialog: 
text: Romeo: A calming gesture as he tries to tread water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: By a name I know not how to tell
dialog: thee who I am:
dialog: My name, dear saint, is hateful to
speaker_heading: MYSELF
dialog: Because it is an enemy to thee.
text: The ferocious barking of a guard dog arrests the teenagers
text: attention. A moment, then they slide beneath the water.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: The security guard and dog appearing above the pool
dialog: area.
dialog: 
text: GUARD'S P.O.V.: The rippling surface of the water.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO - UNDERWATER SHOT: Romeo and Juliet submerged, hair
text: streaming, stare at each other like two beautiful fish.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: The guard. He can see noisy caterers cleaning up
text: around the other side of the house. Frowning, he returns
dialog: the way he came.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Romeo and Juliet. Gasping for air, they cautiously
text: surface. A moment - then Juliet, a small smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Neither, fair maid, if either thee
dialog: dislike.
dialog: 
text: Juliet looks nervously toward the house. She drags Romeo
text: toward a small grotto at the end of the pool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: How cam'st thou hither, tell me,
dialog: and whyfore?
text: The garden walls are high and hard
dialog: to climb,
dialog: And the place death, considering
dialog: who thou art.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: (with splashy bravado)
dialog: With love's light wings did I o'er
dialog: perch these walls.
dialog: For stony limits cannot hold love
dialog: out,
dialog: And what love can do, that dares
dialog: love attempt.
dialog: Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop
dialog: to me.
dialog: 
text: Juliet drags Romeo firmly into the grotto.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: (a real fear)
dialog: If they do see thee, they will
dialog: murder thee.
dialog: 
text: Romeo slowly pulls Juliet toward him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: I have night's cloak to hide me
dialog: from their eyes.
dialog: And but thou love me, let them find
dialog: me here.
dialog: My life were better ended by their
speaker_heading: HATE
dialog: Than death prorogued, wanting of
dialog: thy love.
dialog: 
text: The lovers kiss long and deep. Then Juliet, suddenly
text: fearful, pushes Romeo away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Thou knowest the mask of night is
dialog: on my face,
dialog: Else would a maiden blush bepaint
dialog: my cheek,
dialog: For that which thou hast heard me
dialog: speak tonight.
dialog: Fain would I dwell on form - fain,
dialog: fain deny
dialog: What I have spoke. But farewell
dialog: compliment!
dialog: Dost thou love me?
dialog: 
text: Romeo tries to speak, Juliet silences him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET (CONT.)
dialog: I know thou wilt say 'Ay', and I
dialog: will take thy word. Yet, if thou
dialog: swearest,
dialog: Thou mayst prove false. O gentle
dialog: Romeo,

text: faithfully.
dialog: Or if thou think'st I am too
dialog: quickly won,
dialog: I'll frown, and be perverse, and
dialog: say thee nay,
dialog: So thou wilt woo. But else, not
dialog: for the world.
dialog: In truth, fair Montague, I am too
dialog: fond,
dialog: And therefore thou mayst think my
dialog: 'haviour light.
dialog: But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove
dialog: more true
dialog: Than those that have more cunning

speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,
dialog: That tips with silver all these
dialog: fruit-tree tops -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: O, swear not by the moon, th'
dialog: inconstant moon,
dialog: That monthly changes in her circled

dialog: Lest that thy love prove likewise
dialog: variable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: What shall I swear by?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Do not swear at all.

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: If my heart's dear love -
dialog: 
text: Confused, Juliet breaks away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Well, do not swear. Although I joy
dialog: in thee,
dialog: I have no joy of this contract
dialog: tonight.
dialog: It is too rash, too unadvised, too
speaker_heading: SUDDEN;
dialog: Too like the lightning, which doth

dialog: Ere one can say 'it lightens.'
dialog: Sweet, good night.
dialog: This bud of love, by summer's

dialog: May prove a beauteous flower when

dialog: Good night, good night. As sweet

dialog: Come to thy heart as that within my

dialog: 
text: She rushes up the stairs - Romeo follows desperately.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
dialog: 
text: Juliet - a shocked look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: What satisfaction canst thou have

dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON: Romeo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I gave thee mind before thou didst

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET (CONT.)
dialog: And yet I would it were to give

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: But to be frank and give it thee

speaker_heading: NURSE (O/S)
dialog: Juliet!
dialog: 
text: Juliet looks to the house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
speaker_heading: (BREATHLESSLY)

speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: A thousand times good night!
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: A thousand times the worse, to want
dialog: thy light.
text: Love goes toward love as schoolboys
dialog: from their books;
dialog: But love from love, toward school

dialog: 
text: Juliet re-appears at the upper balcony.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Romeo! What o'clock tomorrow
dialog: Shall I send to thee?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: By the hour of nine.
dialog:

speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I will not fail. 'Tis twenty year

dialog: Goodnight, goodnight! Parting is

scene_heading: INT. GREENHOUSE. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: Morning sunlight filters through the lush foliage of a
dialog: tropical rainforest.
dialog: 
scene_heading: PAN DOWN: As we hear:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE (O/S)
dialog: O mickle is the powerful grace that
speaker_heading: LIES
dialog: In plants, herbs, stones, and their
dialog: true qualities.
dialog: 
text: We discover the intensely concentrating features of FATHER
text: LAURENCE. Fifties, wiry and wearing a priest's collar,
text: Laurence delicately makes an incision in the bulb of a small
text: purple flowered plant.
dialog: 
text: A pair of fresh faced ten year old boys look on in wonderment
text: as a vivid blue sap oozes from the incision.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
dialog: Within the infant rind of this weak
speaker_heading: FLOWER
dialog: Poison hath residence, and medicine
dialog: power.
dialog: 
text: PULL BACK: The Priest carefully gathers the sap into a
text: beaker. We discover that we are in a small tropical
dialog: greenhouse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
dialog: (to the boys)
dialog: For this, being smelt, with that
dialog: part cheers each part;
dialog: Being tasted, stays all senses with
dialog: the heart.
text: The boys follow the Father as he moves out of the greenhouse
text: and into an adjoining work area. The walls are lined with
text: bottles of herbs and dried plants and a television flickers
text: in the corner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
dialog: For naught so vile on the earth
dialog: doth live,
dialog: But to the earth some special good
dialog: doth give;
dialog: 
text: With the precision of a chemist, Father Laurence funnels the
text: sap into a small bottle and places it in the refrigerator.
text: From out of the refrigerator he produces a large jar of
text: candy. He eyes the boys sternly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
dialog: Nor aught so good but, strained
dialog: from that fair use,
dialog: Revolts from true birth, stumbling
dialog: on abuse.
dialog: 
text: The boys take their candy and scram.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: The muted television. A morning news program shows
text: footage of a murder scene cordoned off with police tape. A
text: distraught mother is being restrained.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: The priest contemplating the television.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: Two such opposed kings encamp them
speaker_heading: STILL
dialog: In man as well as herbs: grace and
dialog: rude will;
dialog: And where the worser is predominant,
text: Full soon the canker death eats up
dialog: that plant.
dialog: 
text: A feverish knocking breaks the priest's reverie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (O/S)
dialog: Good morrow, father!
dialog: 
text: Father Laurence snaps off the television and exits the
dialog: workroom.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WALL. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: Romeo, dressed in last night's chain mail, pounds desperately
text: on a wooden door set into a high stone wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Good morrow, father!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: From the workroom, Father Laurence enters a courtyard which
text: encloses a tranquil tropical garden. He opens a door in the
text: wall of the courtyard and smiles as the costumed Romeo
text: bursts in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: Benedicite!
dialog: What early tongue so sweet saluteth
dialog: me?
dialog: 
text: Without pausing, the priest continues through the courtyard
text: and toward the church.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
text: Young son, it argues a distempered
speaker_heading: HEAD
dialog: So soon to bid good morrow to thy
dialog: bed.
dialog: Or if not so, then here I hit it
dialog: right -
dialog: Our Romeo hath not been in bed
dialog: tonight.
dialog: 
text: The priest enters the back of the church.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SACRISTY. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: Romeo, on fire to tell of his experience, follows the priest
text: into the sacristy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: The last is true. The sweeter rest
dialog: was mine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: (he stops)
dialog: God pardon sin! Wast thou with
dialog: Rosaline?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: With Rosaline, my ghostly father?
dialog: No.
dialog: I have forgot that name and that
dialog: name's woe.
dialog: 
text: The Father lays out the cut glass bottles and communion tray
dialog: for mass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: That's my good son! But where hast
dialog: thou been then?
dialog: 
text: Unconsciously, Romeo helps the priest prepare. It is clear
text: he knows the routine by heart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: I have been feasting with mine
dialog: enemy,
dialog: Where on a sudden one hath wounded
dialog: me.
dialog: That's by me wounded. Both our
speaker_heading: REMEDIES
text: Within they help and holy physic
dialog: lies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
text: (buttoning a long
dialog: black cassock)
dialog: Be plain, good son, and homely in
dialog: thy drift.
text: Riddling confession finds but
text: riddling shrift.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Then plainly know my heart's dear
dialog: love is set,
dialog: On the fair daughter of rich
dialog: Capulet.
dialog: We met, we wooed, and made exchange
dialog: of vow,
dialog: I'll tell thee as we pass. But
dialog: this I pray,
dialog: That thou consent to marry us today.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: The Priest, thunderstruck. The two kids, now
text: dressed in red altar-boy robes, enter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALTAR BOYS
dialog: Good morrow, Romeo.
dialog: 
text: The apoplectic priest waves the boys away. They get the
dialog: message and bolt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: Holy Saint Francis! What a change
dialog: is here!
dialog: Is Rosaline, that thou didst love
dialog: so dear,
dialog: So soon foresaken? Young men's
dialog: love then lies
dialog: Not truly in their hearts, but in
dialog: their eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Thou chid'st me oft for loving
dialog: Rosaline.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: (very angry)
dialog: For doting, not for loving, pupil
dialog: mine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: I pray thee chide me not. Her I
dialog: love now
dialog: Doth grace for grace and love for
dialog: love allow.
dialog: The other did not so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: O, she knew well
dialog: Thy love did read by rote, that
dialog: could not spell.
dialog: 
text: The Father falls into a chair and considers. He looks
text: through the sacristy door to where a small children's choir
text: has assembled. Their angelic voices soar into the purest of
dialog: hymns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHOIR
dialog: How can you just leave me standing
dialog: Alone in a world so cold,
dialog: Maybe I'm just too demanding,
dialog: Maybe I'm just like my father, too
dialog: bold,
dialog: Maybe you're just like my mother,
dialog: She's never satisfied.
dialog: Why do we scream at each other?
dialog: This is what it sounds like when
dialog: doves cry...
dialog: 
text: We recognise the hymn as "When Doves Cry" by Prince.
dialog: 
text: PUSH IN: On the Priest; moved, he looks to Romeo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: But come, young waverer, come, go
dialog: with me.
dialog: In one respect I'll thy assistant
dialog: be.
dialog: For this alliance may so happy
speaker_heading: PROVE
dialog: To turn your households' rancor to
dialog: pure love.
dialog: 
text: Romeo hurriedly assists the priest with his vestments.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: O, let us hence! I stand on sudden
dialog: haste.
dialog: 
text: Father Laurence holds Romeo in his powerful gaze.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
text: Wisely and slow. They stumble that
dialog: run fast.
dialog: 
text: The procession is joined by the two little altar boys and
text: the mass begins.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VERONA BEACH. DAY.
dialog: 
text: As the Angelic voices of the choir soar, we see a pay phone
text: etched with hyper-real starkness against the white sand,
text: green sea and blue sky.
dialog: 
text: A single leaning palm tree frames the image like a ridiculous
dialog: tourist postcard.
dialog: 
text: Benvolio speaks on the pay phone. Mercutio, torso naked but
text: for his holstered Sports Rapier 9mm, drums his fingers on
text: the side of the booth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: Where the devil should this Romeo
dialog: be?
dialog: Came he not home tonight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: (slamming down the phone)
dialog: Not to his father's. I spoke with
dialog: his man.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio storms off down the beach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: Why, that same pale hard-hearted
dialog: wench, that Rosaline,
dialog: Torments him so that he will sure
dialog: run mad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: (running to keep up)
dialog: Tybalt hath sent a letter to his
dialog: father's house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: (halts abruptly)
dialog: A challenge, on my life.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Benvolio, unsure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: Romeo will answer it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: Any man that can write may answer a
dialog: letter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: Nay, he will answer the letter's
dialog: master, how he dares, being dared.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio clamps Benvolio into a headlock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: Alas, poor Romeo, he is already
dialog: dead!
text: Stabbed with a white wench's black
dialog: eye,
dialog: 
text: He whispers into Benvolio's ear:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (CONT.)
text: Run through the ear with a love
dialog: song.
dialog: (in disgust)
dialog: And is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: (struggling to break free)
dialog: Why, what is Tybalt?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: (releasing him)
dialog: More than Prince of Cats, I can
dialog: tell you.
dialog: O, he's the courageous captain of
dialog: compliments.
dialog: The very butcher of a silk button.
dialog: 
text: Lightening fast, Mercutio draws his gun. He twirls it in an
text: impressive display of gunmanship which ends with the barrel
text: between the startled Benvolio's eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (CONT.)
text: A duellist, a duellist.
dialog: 
text: Romeo's car pulls into the beach side parking lot. Benvolio
text: heads toward it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - PARKING LOT. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Romeo alights from his car and throws his keys to Balthasar
text: who lounges outside the beach side hang. Mercutio saunters
text: up the beach with mock nonchalance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: Signor Romeo, Bonjour. There's a
dialog: French salutation to your French
dialog: slop. You gave us the counterfeit
dialog: fairly last night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Good morrow to you both. What
dialog: counterfeit did I give you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: The slip, sir, the slip. Can you
dialog: not conceive?
dialog: 
text: Romeo smiles smugly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Pardon, good Mercutio. My business
dialog: was great, and in such a case as
dialog: mine a man may strain courtesy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
speaker_heading: (SARCASTICALLY)
text: A most courteous exposition.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Nay I am the very pink of courtesy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
speaker_heading: (CAMPLY)
dialog: Pink for flower?
dialog: 
text: The boys laugh. Romeo feigns anger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: I will bite thee on the ear for
dialog: that jest!
dialog: 
text: Mercutio, goading Romeo to follow, backs off down the beach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: Come between us, good Benvolio! My
text: wits faint.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio flicks sand at Romeo, then sprints off down the
text: beach. Romeo, laughing, gives chase.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
text: Switch and spurs, switch and spurs,
dialog: or I'll cry a match.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - SHORELINE. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Romeo is gaining on Mercutio, who runs headlong into the sea.
text: With a yell, Romeo dives in after him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - AT SEA. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio splashes the laughing Romeo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: Why, is not this better now than
dialog: groaning for love?
dialog: 
text: Romeo tries to dunk Mercutio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (CONT.)
dialog: Now art thou sociable.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio, evading, heads for shore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (CONT.)
dialog: Now art thou Romeo. Now art thou...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - SHORELINE. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Romeo tackles Mercutio on the wet sand. Mercutio falls
text: suddenly serious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (CONT.)
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: What thou art, by art as well as by
dialog: nature.
dialog: 
text: A moment between the boys. A shadow falls across them.
text: Romeo looks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Here's goodly gear.
dialog: 
text: Standing above the boys is the Nurse. She wears a
text: ridiculous, all red, "Jackie O" style disguise of sunglasses,
text: scarf and parasol.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
speaker_heading: (BEMUSED)
dialog: God ye good e'en fair gentlewoman.
dialog: 
text: The nurse, ignoring Mercutio, speaks dramatically to Romeo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: I desire some confidence with you.
dialog: 
text: She turns and walks back to the parking lot where Peter the
text: chauffer waits beside the limousine.
dialog: 
text: Benvolio and the other boys look on curiously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!
dialog: 
text: But Romeo rises and to the amazement of Mercutio actually
text: follows this woman. Mercutio looks questioningly to
text: Benvolio, who shrugs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: She will endite him to some supper?
dialog: 
text: Even more strangely, Romeo gets into the limousine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: (taken by surprise)
dialog: Romeo, will you come to your
dialog: father's?
dialog: We'll to dinner thither.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: (as he closes the door)
dialog: I will follow you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell.
dialog: 
text: The car pulls away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DAY.
dialog: 
text: The limousine drives through Verona Beach.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MOVING LIMOUSINE. DAY.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Romeo jammed into the corner of the seat. The
text: Nurse's face is pressed alarmingly close to his. She speaks
text: in cold deadly earnest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: If ye should lead her in a fool's
dialog: paradise, as they say, it were a
dialog: very gross kind of behavior, as
dialog: they say. For the gentlewoman is
dialog: young; and therefore, if you should
dialog: deal double with her, truly it were
dialog: an ill thing and very weak dealing.
dialog: 
text: BEAT: Romeo chooses his words carefully.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Bid her to come to confession this
dialog: afternoon,
dialog: And there she shall at Friar
dialog: Laurence's cell
dialog: Be shrived and
scene_heading: (PUSH IN ON: Romeo)
dialog: married.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAY.

speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: O God she comes!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAPULETS MANSION - DRIVEWAY. DAY.
dialog: 
text: PULL BACK: JULIET'S P.O.V.: The limousine pulls up at the
text: front door, the Nurse alights.
dialog: 
text: Juliet bolts from the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LANDING. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Juliet hurries down the stairs - the Nurse, a way ahead,
text: disappears into a doorway.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWAY. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Juliet races down a dark stairwell that leads to the bowels
dialog: of the house.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. DAY.
dialog: 
text: The kitchen, obviously the Nurse's domain, is decorated with
text: a mixture of religious iconography and travel posters. Most
text: of the posters depict a strange city of decadent, decaying,
dialog: beauty.
dialog: 
text: Juliet bursts breathlessly into the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: O honey nurse, what news?
dialog: 
text: The Nurse, buried up to her ample hips inside the
text: refrigerator, does not turn around.
dialog: 
text: Juliet cries impatiently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Nurse!
dialog: 
text: The nurse emerges from the ice box laden with food. Moving
text: to the counter she starts to make a sandwich.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: I am aweary, give me leave awhile.
dialog: Fie, how my bones ache. What a
dialog: jaunce have I.
dialog: 
text: Juliet under her breath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I would thou hadst my bones and I
dialog: thy news.
dialog: 
text: Juliet goes to the nurse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Nay come, I pray thee, speak: good;
speaker_heading: GOOD
dialog: Nurse, speak.
dialog: 
text: Sandwich made, the nurse shuffles over to a corner couch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Jesu, what haste. Can you not stay
dialog: awhile?
dialog: Can you not see I am out of breath?
dialog: 
text: Juliet cannot stand the suspense any longer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: How art thou out of breath when
dialog: thou hast breath
dialog: To say to me that thou art out of
dialog: breath!
dialog: Is the news good or bad? Answer to
dialog: that.
dialog: 
text: The Nurse takes a big bite from her sandwich and answers
text: through thoughtful chews.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Well, you have made a simple
dialog: choice.
dialog: You know not how to choose a man.
dialog: Romeo? No, not he.
dialog: Though his face be better than any
dialog: man's, yet his leg excels all men's
dialog: and for a hand and a foot and a
dialog: body, though they be not to be
dialog: talked on, yet they are past
dialog: compare.
dialog: He's not the flower of courtesy,
dialog: but I'll warrant him as gentle as a
dialog: lamb. Go thy ways, wench, serve
dialog: God. What, have you dined at home?
dialog: 
text: Juliet is flabbergasted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: No, no. But all this I did know
dialog: before. What says he of our
dialog: marriage? What of that
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Lord how my head aches! What a
dialog: head have I:
dialog: My back -
dialog: 
text: This is a game that Juliet knows well. She moves behind the
text: Nurse and begins massaging her back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE (CONT.)
dialog: o' t'other side - ah, my back!
dialog: Beshrew your heart for sending me
speaker_heading: ABOUT
dialog: To catch my death with jauncing up
dialog: and down.
dialog: 
text: With sublime self control, Juliet coo's sweetly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I'faith I am sorry that thou art
dialog: not well.
dialog: Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me,
dialog: what says my love?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Your love says like an honest
dialog: gentleman,
dialog: And a courteous, and a kind, and a
dialog: handsome,
dialog: And I warrant a virtuous - Where is
dialog: your mother?
dialog: 
text: Juliet cracks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Where is my mother? How oddly thou
dialog: repliest!
dialog: 'Your love says, like an honest

speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: O God's lady dear are you so hot?

speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: These violent delights have violent

dialog: 
text: PULL BACK: Father Laurence is preaching energetically from
text: the pulpit. Hidden from the congregation, Romeo waits in a
text: small alcove chapel at the side of the altar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
dialog: The sweetest honey
dialog: Is loathsome in its own
dialog: deliciousness,
dialog: Therefore love moderately.
dialog: 
text: The Father glances toward Romeo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
dialog: Long love doth so.
dialog: Too swift arrives as tardy as too
dialog: slow.
text: Juliet pushes through the double doors at the far end of the
dialog: church.
dialog: 
text: Father Laurence motions to the middle-aged choir master who
text: leads the choir into a choral version of Led Zeppelin's "A
dialog: Whole Lot of Love" with Latin lyrics.
dialog: 
text: Father Laurence hurries from the altar over to Romeo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
dialog: Here comes the lady.
dialog: 
text: Juliet bursts into the tiny chapel. Trying to observe a
text: vestige of decorum, she greets Father Laurence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Good afternoon to my ghostly
dialog: confessor.
dialog: 
text: But before the priest can reply, the two lovers embrace,
text: kissing passionately.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
speaker_heading: (DRYLY)
dialog: Romeo shall thank thee, daughter,
dialog: for us both.
dialog: 
text: The choir completes the hymn and the priest, realising it is
text: his cue, rushes back to the altar. He quickly delivers a
text: prayer to the congregation while eyeing the increasingly
text: amorous smooching of the young couple.
dialog: 
text: The choir launch into a joyous chorus and the priest returns
text: to Romeo and Juliet. He delicately parts the couple.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
dialog: Come, come, and we will make short
dialog: work.
dialog: For, by your leaves, you shall not

text: A young boy with a voice like Jamiroquai steps forward. He

dialog:

scene_heading: INT./EXT. CHURCH. DAY.
dialog: 
text: CRANE UP: Through the majestic patterning of stained glass,
text: and out of the church to find Peter, the chauffeur, cradling

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH. DAY.
dialog: 
text: The music swells in celebration. Romeo and Juliet, now
text: newly-wed, rush from the side door of the church. The
text: priest follows, throwing handfuls of rice. Peter studiously
text: takes a snap as the bride and groom kiss.
dialog: 
text: Peter holds the door of the limousine open. Reluctantly

dialog: 
text: As the car pulls out of the driveway, Romeo runs alongside.
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER. DAY.
dialog: 
text: FISH-EYE VIEW: From the bottom of the ocean; Mercutio's

dialog: water.
dialog: 
text: A muffled BANG! and a bullet whizzes past the camera.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VERONA BEACH. DAY.
dialog: 
text: We see that Mercutio - wading in knee deep water close to
dialog: the beach - is hunting fish.
dialog: 
text: Benvolio shelters in the shade of an unmanned life guard
dialog: tower.
dialog: 
text: A shimmering heat haze blankets the deserted beach and the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's
dialog: retire.
dialog: The day is hot,
dialog: 
text: Mercutio, ignoring him, plugs away at another fish. Benvolio
text: nervously looks to see if there is any reaction to the sound
dialog: of the shot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO (CONT.)
dialog: The Capels are abroad. And if we
dialog: meet we shall not 'scape a brawl.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio strides out of the water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: Thou art like one of these fellows
text: that, when he enters the confines
dialog: of a tavern, claps me his sword
text: upon the table and says 'God send
dialog: me no need of thee!'
dialog: (he hands Benvolio
dialog: his gun)
dialog: and by the operation of the second
text: cup draws him on the drawer, when
dialog: indeed there is no need.
dialog: 
text: Another incredible sleight of hand routine and Mercutio has
text: managed to draw Benvolio's pistol, retrieve his own gun, and
text: trap Benvolio with a barrel at each temple.
dialog: 
text: The joke has worn thin for Benvolio; he pushes past Mercutio
text: toward where Balthasar, Sampson and Gregory lounge in the
text: shade of the beach-side hang.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly he stops dead - a monstrous black sedan prowls into
text: the beach side parking lot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: By my head, here comes the Capulets.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: By my heel, I care not.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - PARKING LOT. DAY.
dialog: 
text: The sedan mounts the curb and slides to a halt only metres
dialog: from Benvolio and Mercutio.
dialog: 
text: Tybalt, Abra and Petruchio alight from the sedan and walk
text: menacingly toward Mercutio and Benvolio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYBALT
dialog: Gentlemen, good day. A word with
dialog: one of you.
dialog: 
text: The boys from the hang, drawn the Capulet car, converge -
text: eyes dart nervously, hands stray towards guns.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio smiles mockingly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: And but one word with one of us?
dialog: Couple it with something. Make it
dialog: a word and a...
dialog: 
text: Leaning close to Tybalt, he camps the implication.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (CONT.)
dialog: ...blow.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio scores. The boys laugh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYBALT
speaker_heading: (FURIOUS)
dialog: You shall find me apt enough to
dialog: that, sir,
dialog: (clutching at his
dialog: side arm)
dialog: And you will give me occasion.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Mercutio. He stops, eyeing the hand on the gun.
text: No one moves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
text: (a breathy, coquettish
speaker_heading: VOICE)
dialog: Could you not take some occasion
dialog: without giving?
dialog: 
text: The boys fall about again. Tybalt cracks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYBALT
dialog: Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.
dialog: 
text: The accusation stings - Mercutio's anger flares.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: Consort? What, dost thou make us
dialog: minstrels? And thou make minstrels
dialog: of us look to hear nothing but
dialog: discords. Here's my fiddlestick.
dialog: 
text: Indicating his holstered gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (CONT.)
dialog: Here's that shall make you dance.
dialog: (barking at Tybalt)
dialog: Zounds,
dialog: (goading him to go
dialog: for his gun)
dialog: consort!
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON: Tybalt.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Mercutio. He will not back down. Benvolio tries
dialog: to diffuse things.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: Either withdraw unto some private
dialog: place.
dialog: Or reason coldly of your grievances.
text: Here all eyes gaze on us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: Men's eyes were made to look, and
dialog: let them gaze.
dialog: I will not budge for no man's
dialog: pleasure, I.
dialog: 
text: At that moment, Romeo's car pulls into the lot. Tybalt
dialog: smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYBALT
dialog: Well sir, here comes my man.
dialog: 
text: Tybalt moves toward Romeo who bounds from his car full of
dialog: happy news.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYBALT
dialog: Romeo, the love I bear thee can
speaker_heading: AFFORD
dialog: No better term than this:
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Tybalt. He clears his jacket from his side arm
dialog: and issues the challenge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYBALT (CONT.)
dialog: Thou art a villain!
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON: Mercutio.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON: Benvolio.
dialog: 
text: All eyes are on Romeo.
dialog: 
text: Romeo calmly approaches his now cousin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Tybalt, the reason that I have to
dialog: love thee
dialog: Doth much excuse the appertaining
speaker_heading: RAGE
dialog: To such a greeting: villain am I
dialog: none,
dialog: Therefore farewell. I see thou
dialog: knowest me not.
dialog: 
text: Romeo turns, and to the amazement of all, walks back to his
text: car. Tybalt, unable to shoot him in the back, is confused.
text: He hurls himself into his sedan.
dialog: 
text: Kicking it into a sand spraying U-turn, he careens the short
text: distance to Romeo's car. Slamming into the back of it he
dialog: blocks Romeo in.
dialog: 
text: Tybalt leaps out, maniacally kicking at bumper, door and
text: headlights. Romeo flicks the locks down. Tybalt shatters
text: the side window and hauls Romeo through the door, slamming
text: him against the savaged fuselage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYBALT
dialog: Boy, this shall not excuse the
speaker_heading: INJURIES
dialog: That thou hast done me!
dialog: 
text: He smashes Romeo across the face, Romeo crashes to the
dialog: roadway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYBALT
speaker_heading: (YELLING)
dialog: Turn and draw.
dialog: 
text: A cut has opened in the side of Romeo's mouth. He unsteadily
text: lifts himself up, and meeting Tybalt's gaze, speaks through
text: bloodied teeth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: I never injured thee,
dialog: And so, good Capulet, which name I
speaker_heading: TENDER
dialog: As dearly as mine own...
dialog: 
text: Romeo cautiously extracts his gun...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
dialog: ...be satisfied.
dialog: 
text: ...and throws it at Tybalt's feet.
dialog: 
text: Storm clouds obscure the sun as Romeo turns and walks from
text: the parking lot.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio, Benvolio and the others cannot believe their eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: O calm, dishonourable, vile
dialog: submission!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - VACANT LOT. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Tybalt's anger must be answered. He ceremoniously disarms,
text: gives his weapon to Abra, and sprints after Romeo who is now
text: passing a beach side lot that houses an abandoned grand
text: hotel. A bone-cracking kick sends Romeo crumbling into the
text: vacant lot. The boys swarm toward the fray.
text: Romeo, still refusing the fight, scrambles up the stairs of
text: the deserted hotel. Tybalt trips him and Romeo careens into
text: an ornamental wooden railing, smashing it to pieces.
dialog: 
text: Tybalt kicks savagely at the helpless Romeo.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Mercutio appears running full tilt down the
text: concrete terrace. He plucks up one of the splintered wooden
text: palings and yells...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (CONT.)
dialog: Tybalt, you ratcatcher,
dialog: 
text: ...as he bludgeons him across the face. Tybalt goes down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (CONT.)
dialog: Will you walk?
dialog: 
text: Tybalt leaps to his feet grabbing a lump of wood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYBALT
dialog: What wouldst thou have with me?
dialog: 
text: He swipes at Mercutio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
speaker_heading: (AVOIDING)
dialog: Good King of Cats, nothing but one
dialog: of your nine lives.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio jabs, Tybalt sidesteps.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYBALT
dialog: I am for you.
dialog: 
text: Tybalt aims a double-handed blow to Mercutio's head.
text: Mercutio blocks, hooking Tybalt's stick away.
dialog: 
text: Unarmed, Tybalt throws his full body weight upon Mercutio,
text: slamming him against a window that shatters in a storm of
dialog: glass.
dialog: 
text: Lightning fast, Mercutio jackknifes to his feet. He raises
text: his weapon to deliver a skull-crushing final blow to the
text: trapped Tybalt. Romeo rushes between them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio!
dialog: 
text: Seizing the opportunity, Tybalt lunges at Romeo with a
text: lethal triangle of broken glass. He misses, gouging instead
text: a slash of flesh from Mercutio's stomach.
text: A scream of excruciating pain as Mercutio grabs at his
text: bloodied side. Everyone is still. In the abrupt silence,
text: sirens are heard closing in the distance. Abra tugs at
dialog: Tybalt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Away Tybalt!
dialog: 
text: They bolt for their vehicle.
dialog: 
text: Benvolio goes to Mercutio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: Art thou hurt?
dialog: 
text: But Mercutio, covering his wound with his hand, laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: Ay, ay, a scratch.
dialog: 
text: He turns to his assembled fans at the bottom of the stairs.
text: With outrageous bravado he plays at being Caesar the
dialog: conqueror.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (CONT.)
dialog: A scratch!
dialog: 
text: The boys cheer their conquering hero. Romeo helps Mercutio
text: down the stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Courage, man. The hurt cannot be
dialog: much.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio holding his bleeding side, jokes through the pain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: 'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow
dialog: and you shall find me a grave man.
dialog: 
text: He turns the next thought to the assembled audience.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (CONT.)
dialog: (through crazy laughter)
dialog: A plague o' both your houses!
dialog: 
text: Mercutio turns from the cheering boys to Romeo who is
text: struggling to support his weight.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio - through weak and desperate breathing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (CONT.)
dialog: Why the devil came you between us?
dialog: I was hurt under your arm.
text: Romeo starts to register the panic in Mercutio's eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: I thought all for the best.
dialog: 
text: Like an animal trying to break free from a mortal trap,
text: Mercutio pushes Romeo away. He screams in horror, as if
dialog: falling in the dark:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO
dialog: A plague o' both your houses!
dialog: They have made worms' meat of me.
dialog: 
text: Mercutio staggers down the stairs and collapses in the dirt.
text: Romeo is there instantly, cradling his friend's head out of
text: the dust. The dying boy stares back at Romeo, smiling
text: through the chilling cold.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (CONT.)
dialog: (a silent whisper)
dialog: Your houses!
dialog: 
text: Everything stands still, everything is quiet. The storm
text: finally breaks.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - RAIN. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Tiny drops of water fall from the sky and bespeckle
text: Mercutio's lifeless body. The droplets grow to a heavy rain.
text: Romeo can hear the faint sound a thousand miles away of
dialog: Benvolio whispering:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENVOLIO
dialog: Mercutio is dead!
dialog: 
text: Tears streak Romeo's face. He cries out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Oh sweet Juliet,
dialog: Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
dialog: And in my temper softened valor's
dialog: steel!
dialog: 
text: The sound of Tybalt's vehicle starting brings back cold
text: reality. Romeo's sorrow turns to uncontrollable rage.
dialog: 
text: Shrugging aside Benvolio's attempts to restrain him, Romeo
text: runs to his car.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - PARKING LOT. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Up ahead Tybalt's sedan screeches into a fishtailing U-turn
text: and powers away.
text: Romeo jumps into his vehicle. In an effort to head Tybalt
text: off, he guns his damaged machine down a one way street.
dialog: 
text: The rain is now blinding. Romeo stops for nothing;
text: pedestrians flee, cars spin out of control.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VERONA BEACH STREETS - FROM AIR. DAY.
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHRIST ROUNDABOUT. DAY.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Romeo's car firing out of the one way street and
text: slamming into Tybalt's car. Tybalt's car careens out of

dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Tybalt scrambling from his upturned vehicle.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Romeo running toward him.
dialog: 
text: SUDDENLY Romeo is halted by Tybalt's drawn gun. Fearlessly
text: marching toward it, he screams through tears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Mercutio's soul
dialog: Is but a little way above our heads,
dialog: 
text: Romeo grabs the barrel of the gun; forcing it between his

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
dialog: Staying for thine to keep him
dialog: company.
dialog: 
text: Tybalt, unnerved, tries to back off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYBALT
dialog: Thou, wretched boy, shalt with him
dialog: hence.
dialog: 
text: Romeo, refusing to let go of the gun, forces Tybalt backward
text: through the torrential rain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: (with frightening intensity)
dialog: Either thou or I, or both, must go
dialog: with him.
dialog: 
text: Cars swerve, Romeo is relentless. He grips Tybalt's hand
text: trying to force him to shoot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
dialog: Either thou or I, or both, must go
dialog: with him.
dialog: 
text: Panicked, Tybalt wrenches free and lurches onto the roadway.
text: Blinded by the headlights of an oncoming car he thuds onto
text: its hood as it skids to a halt. The impact catapults his
text: gun high into the air.
dialog: 
text: Romeo coldly follows its slow motion, spinning trajectory.
dialog: 
text: Real time stretches as the gun dances high above his head.
text: Police sirens, cars swerving, people screaming, and the
text: yelling of panicked commands fade to a nothingness.
dialog: 
text: Romeo stands calmly considering the gun in the air. A
text: harrowing symphonic tone and the echo of Mercutio's voice
text: can be heard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCUTIO (V/O)
dialog: Why the devil came you between us?

text: CUT TO: Cops levelling their revolvers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: (Romeo in his sights)
dialog: Put up thy weapon.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Real time - Romeo fires three deliberate shots.
text: Tybalt's body convulses backwards against the car, hitting

dialog: 
text: The cop fires. A bullet grazes Romeo's arm - his gun drops
text: as he screams.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: O, I am fortune's fool!
dialog: 
text: At that moment a roaring hurricane wind hits; blinding police.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Oh God! Did Romeo's hand shed
dialog: Tybalt's blood?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: It did, it did! Alas the day, it
dialog: did!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Oh serpent heart, hid with a
text: flowering face.
dialog: Was ever book containing such vile
speaker_heading: MATTER
dialog: So fairly bound? O, that deceit
dialog: should dwell
dialog: In such a gorgeous palace!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: There's no trust, No faith, no
dialog: honesty in men. All perjured,
dialog: All forsworn, all naught, all
dialog: dissemblers.
dialog: Shame come to Romeo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Blistered be thy tongue
dialog: For such a wish! He was not born

text: ashamed to sit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Will you speak well of him that
dialog: killed your cousin?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Shall I speak ill of him that is my
dialog: husband?
dialog: Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall
dialog: smooth thy name
dialog: When I, thy three-hours wife have
dialog: mangled it?
dialog: But whyfore, villain, didst thou
dialog: kill my cousin?
dialog: That villain cousin would have
dialog: killed my husband.
dialog: All this is comfort, wherefore weep
dialog: I then?
dialog: Some word there was worser than
dialog: Tybalt's death:
dialog: I would forget it fain - exiled.
text: Tybalt is dead, and Romeo exiled.
dialog: To speak that word is father,
dialog: mother,
text: Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, all slain,
dialog: All dead.
dialog: 
text: Juliet sinks to the floor, overwhelmed by tears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET (CONT.)
dialog: Nurse, I'll to my wedding bed,
dialog: And death, not Romeo, take my
text: maidenhead.
dialog: 
text: Nurse looks down at Juliet. She goes and comforts her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Hie to your chamber. I'll find
speaker_heading: ROMEO

dialog: 
text: Romeo looks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Nurse!
dialog: 
text: She goes to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Ah sir! Ah sir! Death's the end
dialog: of all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Speakest thou of Juliet?
dialog: Where is she? And how doth she?
dialog: And what says
dialog: My concealed lady to our cancelled
dialog: love?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
text: O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps
dialog: and weeps,
text: And then on Romeo cries, and then
text: falls down again.
dialog: 
text: Romeo is wailing inconsolably.
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: As if that name,
text: Shot from the deadly level of a
dialog: gun,
dialog: Did murder her, as that name's
dialog: cursed hand murdered her kinsman!
dialog:

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: Go, get thee to thy love, as was
dialog: decreed.
dialog: Ascend her chamber. Hence and
dialog: comfort her.
dialog: But look thou stay not till the

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT.

speaker_heading: ROMEO

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Sobs echo through the house.
dialog: 
text: Dave Paris stands in the entrance hallway clutching a huge
text: bunch of flowers.
dialog: 
text: Fulgencio Capulet stands beside him, whisky glass in hand.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Gloria on the upper landing. There is a strange
text: faraway quality about her as she descends to Dave and Capulet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: She'll not come down tonight.
dialog: 
text: Dave, an understanding smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: These times of woe afford no times
dialog: to woo.
dialog: 
text: Capulet guides Dave into the house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: Look you, she loved her kinsman

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA
speaker_heading: (JOINING)
dialog: And so did I.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: (a cold glance at Gloria)
dialog: Well, we were born to die.
dialog: 
text: Capulet takes a large slug of whisky. Gloria leans close to
dialog: Dave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: I'll know her mind early tomorrow.
text: Tonight she's mewed up to her
dialog: heaviness.
dialog: 
text: As Gloria, Dave and Capulet exit down the hallway we CRANE
text: UP: toward Juliet's bedroom door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Juliet's face. Tears stream onto the pillow.
text: Without warning a hand lightly touches her cheek. Juliet's
text: eyes dart up to discover Romeo standing above her.
dialog: 
text: A still moment of disbelief. Leaning down, Roemo kisses
text: away the tears that fall from her dark, wide eyes.
dialog: 
text: Juliet's lips find Romeo's and they gently sink back onto
dialog: the bed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SITTING ROOM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Capulet sits in an armchair drinking. Dave and Gloria sit
text: opposite as Capulet whips himself into a frenzy of drunken
dialog: excitement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: We'll keep no great ado - a friend
dialog: or two.
dialog: For, hark you, Tybalt being slain
dialog: so late,
dialog: It may be thought we held him
dialog: carelessly,
dialog: Being our kinsman if we revel
dialog: much -
dialog: But soft what day is this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Monday my lord.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: Well Wednesday is too soon - what
dialog: say you to Thursday?
dialog: 
text: Gloria looks up alarmed; Dave is stunned.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: My lord I...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: (leaning close)
dialog: I will make a desperate tender of
dialog: my child's love.
dialog: (a drunken good humour)
dialog: I think she will be ruled in all
dialog: respects by me;
dialog: (exploding with
dialog: hearty laughter)
dialog: Nay, more, I doubt it not!
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Gloria, her face hardens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: (to Dave)
dialog: But what say you to Thursday?
dialog: 
text: Dave is trying to catch up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: My lord I...
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Capulet he eyes Dave intently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT.)
dialog: I would that Thursday were tomorrow.
dialog: 
text: Delighted, Capulet jumps to his feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: A Thursday let it be then!
dialog: 
text: Capulet holds out his glass in toast. Dave and Gloria rise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: Wife, go you to Juliet ere you go
dialog: to bed.
dialog: Tell her, a Thursday she shall be
speaker_heading: MARRIED
dialog: To this noble sir!
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: The glasses clink.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAPULET ESTATE. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: A pink and gold dawn breaks over Capulet Mansion.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: A tangle of young limbs.
dialog: 
text: Romeo and Juliet blissfully asleep. The dawn light creeps
text: into the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAPULET ESTATE. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: Balthasar's car covertly pulls into a side road near the
dialog: estate.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: Romeo and Juliet still asleep.
dialog: 
text: CRANE DOWN: Toward the sleeping innocence of the faces.
dialog: 
text: HOLD: A shadow of fear passes across Romeo's features.
dialog: 
text: With a cry of panic, he sits bolt upright.
dialog: 
text: Wide awake, but disorientated, Romeo stares around the
text: room - as Juliet stirs, he remembers where he is.
dialog: 
text: Slipping quietly from the bed, Romeo begins to dress.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Romeo. A pair of lips enter frame and find his
text: neck. It is Juliet. She hugs herself to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet
text: near day.
dialog: 
text: Romeo turns - softly he strokes her cheek.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: I must be gone and live, or stay
dialog: and die.
dialog: 
text: Juliet kisses his finger-tips.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Yond light is not daylight,
dialog: 
text: And then his cheek...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET (CONT.)
dialog: I know it, I
dialog: It is some meteor that the sun
speaker_heading: EXHALES
dialog: To light thee on thy way to Mantua.
dialog: Therefore stay yet. Thou needest
dialog: not to be gone.
dialog: 
text: Romeo, feverishly returning the kisses, throws himself on
dialog: Juliet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Let me be taken, let me be put to
dialog: death.
dialog: I have more care to stay than will
dialog: to go.
dialog: Come, death, and welcome! Juliet
dialog: wills it so.
dialog: 
text: Juliet is suddenly still. Romeo kisses her gently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
dialog: How is't, my soul? Let's talk. It
dialog: is not day.
dialog: 
text: Juliet pulls Romeo to his feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone,
dialog: away!
dialog: O, now be gone! More light and
text: light it grows.
dialog: 
text: Frantically she helps him into his clothes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
text: More light and light: more dark and
dialog: dark our woes.
dialog: 
text: There is an urgent knocking on the door. They freeze.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE (O/S)
dialog: Madam!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Nurse!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE (O/S)
dialog: Your lady mother is coming to your
dialog: chamber.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Then, window, let day in, and let
dialog: life out.
dialog: 
text: Desperately Juliet pulls Romeo out onto the balcony.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BALCONY. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: The storm, now past, has left a morning achingly pure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Farewell, farewell. One kiss, and
dialog: I'll descend.
text: Romeo climbs down from the balcony and into the shadows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: O, think'st thou we shall ever meet
dialog: again?
dialog: 
text: Romeo smiles up at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: I doubt it not;
dialog: 
text: Juliet's face darkens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: O God, I have an ill-divining soul.
dialog: Methinks I see thee, now thou art
dialog: so low,
text: As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
dialog: 
text: Romeo scrambles back up to the balcony.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Trust me, love, all these woes
dialog: shall serve
dialog: For sweet discourses in our times
dialog: to come.
dialog: 
text: From Juliet's bedroom comes the brittle sound of Gloria
text: Capulet's voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: Ho daughter! Are you up?
dialog: 
text: Juliet spins around. Gloria has parted the curtains and is
text: staring directly at her daughter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: Well, well.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Romeo sheltered just below the lip of the balcony.
dialog: 
text: FOLLOW: His hand, as it slowly reaches up and touches
text: Juliet's fingers hidden behind her back.
dialog: 
text: Gloria returns to the room. Juliet steals a glance toward
text: Romeo as he silently mouths:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Adieu, adieu!
dialog: 
text: As Romeo's face disappears into the shadows Juliet whispers
text: a little prayer to herself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: O Fortune, Fortune! Be fickle,
dialog: Fortune,
dialog: Fo then I hope thou wilt not keep
dialog: him long
dialog: But send him back.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: Juliet is trying not to cry as she goes in to her mother.
text: Gloria turns to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: Thou hast a careful father, child:
dialog: One who, to put thee from thy
dialog: heaviness,
dialog: Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
dialog: That thou expects not nor I looked
dialog: not for.
dialog: 
text: Juliet plays along.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Madam, in happy time. What day is
dialog: that?
dialog: 
text: Gloria takes a deep breath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: Marry, my child, early next Thursday
speaker_heading: MORN
dialog: The gallant, young, and noble
dialog: gentleman,
dialog: Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
dialog: Shall happily make thee there a
text: joyful bride.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Juliet. She can barely speak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Now by Saint Peter's Church, and
dialog: Peter too,
dialog: He shall not make me there a joyful
dialog: bride!
dialog: 
text: Fear passes across Gloria's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: Here comes your father. Tell him
dialog: so yourself.
dialog: 
text: Capulet - whisky glass in hand - ebulliently bursts into the
dialog: room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: How now, wife?
dialog: Have you delivered to her our decree?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: Ay, sir. But she will none, she
dialog: gives you thanks.
dialog: I would the fool were married to
dialog: her grave!
dialog: 
text: Capulet - a dangerous calm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: How? Will she none?
dialog: Is she not proud? Doth she not
dialog: count her blest,
dialog: Unworthy as she is, that we have
speaker_heading: WROUGHT
dialog: So worthy a gentleman to be her
dialog: bride?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Not proud you have, but thankful
dialog: that you have.
dialog: Proud can I never be of what I hate.
dialog: 
dialog: PAUSE: Capulet considers his daughter, then -
dialog: 
text: BAM! He hurls his glass against the wall, shattering it
text: into a thousand pieces.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: Thank me no thankings, nor proud me
dialog: no prouds,
dialog: But fettle your fine joints 'gainst
dialog: Thursday next ...
dialog: 
text: Capulet advances. Juliet, terrified, retreats into the
dialog: hallway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Hear me with patience but to speak
dialog: a word...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LANDING. DAY.
dialog: 
text: The Nurse appears as Capulet picks his daughter up and
text: shakes her like a rag doll.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: Speak not, reply not, do not answer
dialog: me!
dialog: 
text: He throws her to the floor. His fist thuds as it slams into
text: her face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA
speaker_heading: (SCREAMING)
dialog: Fie, fie! What are you mad?
dialog: 
text: Gloria tries to restrain Capulet. He back-hands her,
text: sending her flying against the wall - bellowing insanely, he
text: advances on his cowering daughter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: Hang thee, young baggage!
dialog: Disobedient wretch.
dialog: 
text: The Nurse throws herself between Capulet and Juliet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: God in heaven bless her!
dialog: You are to blame, my lord, to rate
dialog: her so.
dialog: 
text: Furious, Capulet shunts her aside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET
dialog: Peace, you mumbling fool!
dialog: 
text: Capulet yanks his daughter's face close to his.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPULET (CONT.)
dialog: I tell thee what - get thee to
dialog: church a Thursday
dialog: Or never after look me in the face.
dialog: And you be mine, I'll give you to
dialog: my friend.
dialog: And you be not, hang, beg, starve,
dialog: die in the streets,
dialog: Trust to it. Bethink you. I'll
dialog: not be forsworn.
dialog: 
text: Capulet storms off down the hall.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Juliet. She huddles, shaking at the top of the
dialog: stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: O sweet my mother, cast me not
dialog: away!
dialog: Delay this marriage for a month, a
dialog: week.
dialog: Or if you do not, make the bridal
speaker_heading: BED
dialog: In that dim monument where Tybalt
dialog: lies.
dialog: 
text: A trickle of blood issues from Gloria's cut lip. She checks
text: her appearance in the hall mirror.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: Talk not to me, for I'll not speak
dialog: a word.
dialog: Do as thou wilt, for I have done
dialog: with thee.
dialog: 
text: Gloria leaves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: O God! - O Nurse, how shall this be
dialog: prevented?
dialog: 
text: The Nurse doesn't reply.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET (CONT.)
dialog: What sayest thou? Hast thou not a
dialog: word of joy?
dialog: Some comfort, Nurse.
dialog: 
text: A heavy silence.
dialog: 
text: The Nurse goes to Juliet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Faith, here it is.
dialog: I think it best you married with
dialog: this Paris.
dialog: O, he's a lovely gentleman!
dialog: I think you are happy in this
dialog: second match,
dialog: For it excels your first; or if it
dialog: did not,
dialog: Your first is dead - or 'twere as
dialog: good he were
dialog: As living here and you no use of him.
dialog: 
text: Juliet is very still.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Speakest thou from thy heart?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: And from my soul too. Else beshrew
dialog: them both.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Amen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
speaker_heading: (UNSURE)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
dialog: Juliet is matter of fact.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Well, thou hast comforted me
dialog: marvellous much.
dialog: Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
dialog: Having displeased my father, to
dialog: Friar Laurence,
dialog: To make confession and to be
dialog: absolved.
dialog: 
text: The old woman nods. She strokes Juliet's hair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: This is wisely done.
dialog: 
text: Juliet does not look up.
dialog: 
text: A disturbing choral chant:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Sunlight pierces stained glass - the chant a sinister
text: underscoring. We hear Dave Paris' voice:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE (O/S)
text: Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's
dialog: death...
dialog: 
text: CRANE DOWN: Father Laurence and Dave Paris stand at the
text: front of the church.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT.)
dialog: ...Now, sir, her father counts it
speaker_heading: DANGEROUS
dialog: That she doth give her sorrow so
dialog: much sway,
dialog: And in his wisdom hastes our
speaker_heading: MARRIAGE
dialog: To stop the inundation of her
dialog: tears...
dialog: 
text: Father Laurence turns. Juliet stands framed in the white
text: glare of the doorway.
dialog: 
text: Dave smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Happily met, my lady and my wife.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Juliet's hand concealed beneath her coat - we can
text: just see the handle of a gun.
dialog: 
text: Juliet advances slowly, an icy calm:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: That may be, sir, when I may be a
dialog: wife.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: That 'may be', must be, love, on
dialog: Thursday next.
dialog: 
text: Juliet stares past Dave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: What must be, shall be.
dialog: 
text: Father Laurence, a forced cheerfulness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: That's a certain text.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Come you to make confession?
dialog: 
text: Juliet forces a smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Are you at leisure, holy father,
dialog: now?
dialog: Or shall I come to you at evening
dialog: mass?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: My leisure serves me, pensive
dialog: daughter, now.
dialog: (to Dave)
dialog: We must entreat the time alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: God shield I should disturb
dialog: devotion! - Juliet, on Thursday
dialog: early will I rouse ye;
dialog: 
text: Dave bends.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Juliet; she stares stonily ahead as Dave kisses
text: her cheek.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT.)
dialog: Till then, adieu, and keep this
dialog: holy kiss.
dialog: 
text: Dave leaves.
dialog: 
text: TRACK WITH: Juliet; she runs for the sacristy.
dialog: 
text: The priest follows.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SACRISTY. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Juliet, shaking with sobs takes refuge in the shadows of the
text: small room.
dialog: 
text: The priest goes to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: O Juliet, I already know thy grief.
dialog: 
text: Juliet pulls away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Tell me not, Father, that thou
dialog: hearest of this,
dialog: Unless thou tell me how I may
dialog: prevent it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: It strains me past the compass of
dialog: my wits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
speaker_heading: (DESPERATELY)
dialog: If in thy wisdom thou canst give no
speaker_heading: HELP
dialog: Do thou but call my resolution
dialog: wise,
dialog: And with this I'll help it presently!
dialog: 
text: She pulls the gun, pointing it towards herself.
dialog: 
text: Horrified, Father Laurence moves to her.
dialog: 
text: Juliet, panicked, levels the gun at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: Hold daughter!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: (through tears)
dialog: Be not so long to speak. I lone to
dialog: die!
dialog: 
text: Father Laurence holds out a soothing hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: I do spy a kind of hope,
dialog: Which craves as desperate an
speaker_heading: EXECUTION
dialog: As that is desperate which we would
dialog: prevent.
dialog: If, rather than marry Paris,
dialog: Thou hast the strength of will to
dialog: slay thyself,
dialog: Then it is likely thou wilt
speaker_heading: UNDERTAKE
dialog: A thing like death...
dialog: 
text: We hear the distended chords of Fauré's Requiem.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
dialog: to chide away this shame...
dialog: 
dialog: It continues throughout as;
dialog: 
text: The entire screen fills with a glinting tear drop of blue
dialog: liquid.
dialog: 
text: Reflected in the fluid's convex surface, the face of Father
dialog: Laurence.
dialog: 
text: The face disappears as the tear drop falls and splashes into
text: a clear water solution.
dialog: 
text: Like a comet in slow motion, the drop stains the water a
dialog: cobalt hue.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GREENHOUSE WORKROOM. DAY.
dialog: 
text: PULL BACK: The blue liquid fills a tiny glass vial held by
dialog: Father Laurence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
dialog: No warmth, no breath shall testify
dialog: thou livest.
text: Each part, deprived of supple
dialog: government,
text: Shall stiff and stark and cold
text: appear, like death.
dialog: Now when the bridegroom in the
speaker_heading: MORNING
dialog: Comes to rouse thee from thy bed,
dialog: there art thou, dead.
dialog: Thou shalt be borne to that same
dialog: ancient vault
dialog: Where all the kindred of the
text: Capulets lie.
dialog: In the meantime, against thou shalt
dialog: awake,
dialog: Shall Romeo by my letters know our
dialog: drift,
dialog: And hither shall he come.
dialog: And that very
dialog: Night shall Romeo bear thee hence
dialog: to Mantua.
dialog: 
text: The priest cautiously hands Juliet the vial.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
dialog: Take thou this vial, being then in
dialog: bed,
dialog: And this distilling liquor drink
dialog: thou off.
dialog: I'll send my letters to thy lord
dialog: with speed to Mantua.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH. DAY.
dialog: 
text: As Father Laurence speaks, the screen fills with an express
text: envelope addressed "Romeo - Mantua." The envelope pulls away
text: from the camera and falls into a canvas bag brimming with
text: hundreds of like envelopes.
dialog: 
text: TRACK: With the canvas bag. It continues its journey into
text: the back of an express delivery van.
dialog: 
text: Heavy double doors slam shut, filling the screen with the
dialog: slogan 'Speed Express.'
dialog: 
text: The van pulls away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MANTUA. DAY.
dialog: 
text: A burning red sun is setting over an endless vista of ragged
text: wasteland.
dialog: 
text: CRANE DOWN: A weathered sign reads - Mantua: Behind it a
text: vast colony of permanent trailer homes stretches into the
dialog: distance.
dialog: 
text: The rap, rap, rap of knocking echoes through the park...
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: The source of the knocking. An express delivery
text: man, envelope in hand, raps vigorously on the door of an
text: unremarkable trailer.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRAILER. DAY.
dialog: 
text: TOPOGRAPHICAL SHOT: Romeo lies flat on a single bed in the
text: crampled trailer.
dialog: 
text: The rap, rap, rap is very loud now. We move toward Romeo
text: and realise he cannot hear the knocking because he has
text: Walkman headphones on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRAILER. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Unsuccessful, the delivery man is filling out a "WE CALLED"
text: card. He pushes it under the door.

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: The heraldic 'Wedding Chimes' by JS Bach. Juliet stands
text: resplendent in a radiant bridal gown. The image floats
text: ethereally in a towering slab of mirror.
dialog: 
text: PULL OUT: From the mirror. The wedding dress is in fact
text: being held in front of Juliet by two members of the house
text: staff. Juliet is dressed in her night gown. The Nurse
text: suggests various pairs of shoes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
speaker_heading: (DISINTERESTED)
dialog: Ay, these attires are best.
dialog: 
text: The fuss dispensed with, the staff leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: But, gentle Nurse,
dialog: I pray thee leave me to myself
dialog: tonight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Why Bride?
dialog: 
text: Juliet navigates the Nurse toward the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: (almost in tears)
dialog: To move the heavens to smile upon
dialog: my state,
dialog: Which, well thou knowest, is cross
dialog: and full of sin.
dialog: 
text: Juliet holds the Nurse in a pleading stare. She leaves.
dialog: 
text: Alone now, Juliet hurries to her bedside drawer. She
text: cautiously removes a rolled piece of cloth from which she
text: produces the glass vial.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: What if this mixture do not work at
dialog: all?
dialog: Shall I be married then tomorrow
dialog: morning?
dialog: 
text: She cautiously begins to unscrew the tiny black lid.
text: Suddenly, a knock at her door. Palming the vial, Juliet
text: swings around to meet the arrival of her mother. Gloria
text: probes her daughter's uneasiness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: What, are you busy, ho? Need you
dialog: my help?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: (makes light of it)
dialog: No, madam. We have culled such
speaker_heading: NECESSARIES
dialog: As are behoveful for our state
dialog: tomorrow.
dialog: So please you, let me now be left
dialog: alone,
dialog: And let the Nurse this night sit up
dialog: with you.
dialog: 
text: Juliet begins to pull down the covers on her bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET (CONT.)
dialog: For I am sure you have your hands
dialog: full all
dialog: In this so sudden business.
dialog: 
text: Gloria, sensing Juliet's distress, moves cautiously toward
text: her. Taking hold of the bed covers she helps her daughter
text: into bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: Good night.
dialog: 
text: Juliet slides into bed. Gloria covers her with the blanket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLORIA (CONT.)
dialog: Get thee to bed, and rest, for thou
dialog: hast need.
dialog: 
text: A brief moment between mother and daughter. Gloria, unable
text: to cross that final barrier, moves to the door; but she is
text: stopped by the urgency in Juliet's voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Farewell!
dialog: 
text: Gloria turns to Juliet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET (CONT.)
dialog: God knows when we shall meet again.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Gloria. A faint perplexity, and then with an
text: almost warm smile she turns out the light and leaves.
dialog: 
text: The room is in darkness but for patterns of moonlight
text: through windows.
dialog: 
text: TRACK: Toward Juliet. The sombre tones of Fauré's Requiem
dialog: seep into our consciousness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I have a faint cold fear thrills
dialog: through my veins
text: That almost freezes up the heat of
dialog: life.
dialog: 
text: She brings the vial her mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET (CONT.)
dialog: Come, vial. Romeo, I drink to thee.
dialog: 
text: Juliet drinks, a sudden violent convulsion, her face contorts
dialog: in fear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAPULET ESTATE. DAY.
dialog: 
text: The sky is filled with green and grey clouds. A gusty rain
text: blows the flower arrangements across the lawn. Large white
text: wedding marquees flap in the wind.
dialog: 
text: Through blurring rain, we see ambulances and police vehicles,
text: lights flashing. Father Laurence, accompanied by a dour
text: looking man in black, alights from his car. We follow their
text: P.O.V.: We hear snatches of radio calls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEDIC ONE (OVER RADIO)
dialog: Mortal drugs?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEDIC TWO (OVER RADIO)
dialog: Of lethal quantity as 'twould

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAPULET MANSION - DINING ROOM. DAY.
dialog: 
text: They enter the house and pass the vast dining room, bedecked
dialog: with wedding decorations.
dialog: 
text: Capulet sits at the large mahogany table. In the background
text: Gloria stares vacantly.
dialog: 
text: Moving swiftly toward a doorway, the music builds.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAPULET MANSION - JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAY.
dialog: 
text: The door opens. On the bed Juliet's still body. Father
text: Laurence closes the door. The priest kneels and hastily
text: examines Juliet's pupils. He looks to the man in black who
text: retrieves the glass vial from the floor and pockets it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: (to the man in black)
dialog: As the custom is,
dialog: In all her best array bear her to
dialog: church.
dialog: 
text: When the man in black allows two other dark suited men into
text: the room, it becomes clear he is the undertaker.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNDERTAKER
dialog: She shall be borne to that same
dialog: ancient vault
dialog: Where all the kindred of the
text: Capulets lie.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAUSOLEUM. DAY.
dialog: 
text: A thousand voices proclaim the 'Song of Ascension.'
dialog: 
text: PAN DOWN: From the vaulting glass ceiling of the Capulet
dialog: mausoleum.
dialog: 
text: On view, enshrined in literally thousands of lit candles, is
text: Juliet's peaceful body.
dialog: 
text: We move through lines of Capulet mourners. In the shadows
text: of the front door a young man hides.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: The young man. We recognise the distressed face
dialog: of Balthasar.
dialog: 
text: PUSH IN: Balthasar rushes from the Mausoleum.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MANTUA. DAY.
dialog: 
text: We are high above Mantua. Beyond the trailer park stretches
text: a long ribbon of black highway.
dialog: 
text: As a Speed Express van turns off the highway and into the
text: park, we hear Romeo's voice over:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (V/O)
dialog: If I may trust the flattering truth
dialog: of sleep
dialog: My dreams presage some joyful news
dialog: at hand...
dialog: 
text: CRANE DOWN: The Express van pulls up at the front office.
text: The driver alights and goes inside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRAILER. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Romeo sits at the trailer's small kitchen table smoking and
text: writing in his notebook. The "WE CALLED" card lies next to
text: an overflowing ashtray.
dialog: 
text: His voice over continues.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (V/O)
dialog: And all this day an unaccustomed
speaker_heading: SPIRIT
text: Lifts me above the ground with
text: cheerful thoughts.
dialog: I dreamt my lady came and found me
speaker_heading: DEAD
dialog: And breathed such life with kisses
dialog: in my lips
dialog: That I revived and was an emperor.
dialog: Ah me, how sweet is love itself
speaker_heading: POSSESSED
dialog: When but love's shadows are so rich
dialog: in joy.
dialog: 
text: Stubbing out his cigarette, Romeo gazes through the trailer
text: window to see Balthasar's speeding car turn off the highway
text: and into the trailer park.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: News from Verona!
dialog: 
text: An excited Romeo rushes from the trailer.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRAILER PARK. DAY.
dialog: 
text: CRANE HIGH: Romeo sprints across open ground to intercept
text: Balthasar's car. We see, but Romeo cannot, the Express van
text: approaching from the office. The car slews to a halt and
text: Balthasar jumps out.
dialog: 
text: Romeo yells joyously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: How now, Balthasar?
dialog: 
dialog: Bathlasar cannot speak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
dialog: Dost thou not bring me letters from
dialog: the Priest?
dialog: How doth my lady? Is my father
dialog: well?
dialog: How doth my lady Juliet? That I
dialog: ask again,
dialog: For nothing can be ill if she be
dialog: well.
dialog: 
text: Balthasar does not know how to say what he has come to tell.
text: He looks away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BALTHASAR
dialog: Then she is well and nothing can be
dialog: ill.
text: Her body sleeps in Capels' monument,
dialog: And her immortal part with angels
dialog: lives.
dialog: I saw her laid low in her kindred's
dialog: vault.
dialog: 
text: For a long moment Romeo is profoundly still. When he
text: speaks, it is with a chilling calm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Is it e'en so?
dialog: 
text: Balthasar nods.
dialog: 
text: Romeo turns and stares into the distant wasteland.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: He speaks with bitter determination.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Then I defy you stars.
dialog: 
text: Romeo moves to the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: I will hence tonight.
dialog: 
text: Balthasar tries to restrain him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BALTHASAR
dialog: Have patience...
dialog: 
text: Exploding with fury, Romeo throws Balthasar against the
dialog: vehicle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Leave me!
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: The Speed Express messenger. Returning to his
text: truck, the priest's undelivered envelope in his hand, the
text: messenger looks toward the two boys.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: The boys. Balthasar pleads with Romeo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BALTHASAR
dialog: Your looks are pale and wild and do
speaker_heading: IMPORT
text: Some misadventure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: (with cold serenity)
dialog: Tush, thou art deceived.
dialog: (a niggling thought)
dialog: Hast thou no letters to me from the
dialog: Priest?
dialog: 
text: Balthasar shakes his head.
dialog: 
text: Romeo smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: No matter - I will hence tonight.
dialog: 
text: Romeo climbs into the passenger seat of the car. Balthasar
text: reluctantly gets behind the wheel.
dialog: 
text: As silent tears begin to flow, Romeo turns his face to the
text: setting sun.
dialog: 
text: PUSH IN: As he whispers:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Well Juliet, I will lie with thee
dialog: tonight.
dialog: 
text: Balthasar's car roars out of the park.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: The delivery man. He looks to the envelope in his
text: hand, then gets back into his truck.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Balthasar's car speeds along the night-time highway.
dialog: 
text: CRANE UP: In the distance the glow of city lights.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Balthasar's car pulls into an alley and stops outside a
text: decrepity apartment block.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BLOCK. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: A bespectacled eye peers through the crack of a
text: partly open doorway. Below the face, the barrel of a
text: shotgun protrudes menacingly.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Romeo in the dark, paint peeling hallway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Let me have
dialog: A dram of poison, such soon-
dialog: speeding gear
dialog: As will disperse itself through all
dialog: the veins
dialog: That the life-weary taker may fall
dialog: dead.
dialog: 
text: The eye considers, a voice rasps back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APOTHECARY
dialog: Such mortal drugs I have, but
dialog: Verona's law
dialog: Is death to any he that utters them.
dialog: 
text: Romeo speaks with fury.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: The world is not thy friend, nor
dialog: the world's law.
dialog: Then be not poor, but break it and
dialog: take this.
dialog: 
text: Romeo shoves a wad of money at THE APOTHECARY'S face.
dialog: 
text: BEAT. The rattle of a latch chain and the door swings open.
dialog: 
text: Standing in the doorway is The Apothecary. Sixty something,
text: he has a face scarred with age and abuse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APOTHECARY
dialog: My poverty, but not my will consents.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON: Romeo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: I pay thy poverty and not thy will.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PRESBYTERY. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Father Laurence. He speaks into the telephone
dialog: with concern.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: Who bore my letter then to Romeo?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SPEED EXPRESS DEPOT. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: A bored clerk is on the other end of the line. The priest's
text: letter is on the counter beside him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: I could not sent it - here it is
dialog: again.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PRESBYTERY. NIGHT.

text: Father Laurence is worried.

speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: By my brotherhood, unhappy fortune!
dialog: The letter was of dear import.
dialog: (PAUSE: the priest listens)
dialog: Adieu.
dialog: 
text: He hangs up the receiver and looks at the wall clock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
dialog: Now must I to the monument alone.
dialog: Within this hour will fair Juliet
dialog: awake.
dialog: 
text: DISSOLVE FROM: The clock to...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. APOTHECARY'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: A cat skitters across a stained formica table.
dialog: 
text: PULL BACK: The Apothecary's apartment is filled with cats.
text: Dozens of feline eyes glow in the dim room. Romeo stands
text: nervously. The Apothecary extracts a small chemist's vial
text: from inside a 'Statue of Our Lady' table lamp - he now
text: speaks with cool professionalism.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APOTHECARY
dialog: Drink it off and if you had the
dialog: strength of twenty men it would
dialog: dispatch you straight.
dialog: 
text: Romeo takes the vial and hands over the money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: There is my gold - worse poison to
dialog: men's souls
dialog: Than these poor compounds that thou
dialog: mayst not sell.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BALTHASAR'S CAR. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Motor running, Balthasar waits in the alley outside the
text: apartment building. He checks the rear view mirror and
text: freezes. At the end of the alleyway a police car crawls to
text: a halt.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Romeo exits the building, and as he does so, the streetlight
text: catches his face. The Cop's and Romeo's eyes meet.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: The cop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: This is that banished haughty
dialog: Montague.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BALTHASAR'S CAR.
dialog: 
text: Balthasar cracks; he guns the engine and the car lurches
dialog: forward.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Tires screech as Romeo dives into the passenger seat of
text: Balthasar's moving vehicle.
dialog: 
text: Siren blaring, the police car gives chase.
dialog: 
scene_heading: AERIAL SHOT. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Balthasar's car winds through traffic - the patrol car

scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER PART OF TOWN. NIGHT.

scene_heading: EXT. BALTHASAR'S CAR. NIGHT.

dialog: 
text: CRANE UP: Red and blue police light approach fast.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PRECINCT OFFICE. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Captain Prince barrels through the corridors of police
text: headquarters pulling on his flying jacket.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: TIGHT ON: A smoking tire as it lays rubber to the asphalt.
dialog: 
text: Balthasar grits his teeth as he weaves the car through the
text: impossibly tight space between a container truck and a bus.
dialog: 
text: WHIP PAN: The patrol car is almost upon them when... in a
text: seemingly suicidal manoeuvre Balthasar throws his car into a
text: right-angle turn across four lanes of oncoming traffic.
text: Horns blare.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: A skidding, squealing, out of control sedan, braking
dialog: to avoid collision.
dialog: 
text: Miraculously, Balthasar's vehicle shoots out of it its path
text: and onto the other side of the roadway.
dialog: 
text: The sedan slams into the following patrol car.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Balthasar's car speeds into the driveway of the Verona Beach
dialog: Eternal Rest Cemetery.

scene_heading: INT. CHOPPER. NIGHT.

scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY. NIGHT.

text: CLOSE ON: A stone angel etched against the night sky.
dialog: 
text: PAN DOWN: Romeo pulls a crowbar from the trunk of the parked

dialog: 
text: Romeo eyes Balthasar intently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Upon thy life, whatever thou
speaker_heading: HEAREST
dialog: Or seest, stand all aloof. Give me
dialog: the light -
dialog: 
text: Balthasar stands motionless - Romeo rips the torch from his
text: hands and strides into the cemetery. Balthasar follows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BALTHASAR
dialog: I do beseech you...
dialog: 
text: Romeo turns, punching Balthasar hard; he goes down, blood
text: spurting from his nose.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Do not interrupt me in my course or
dialog: By heaven I will tear thee joint by
speaker_heading: JOINT
dialog: And strew this hungry churchyard
dialog: with thy limbs!
dialog: 
text: Balthasar slowly rises. Both boys are trying hard not to cry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
dialog: The time and my intents are savage
dialog: wild,
text: More fierce and more inexorable far
text: Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BALTHASAR
dialog: I will be gone and not trouble ye.

text: CLOSE ON: A crowbar wrenches at ornate glass and iron doors.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Thou detestable maw, thou womb of
dialog: death,
dialog: Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to
dialog: open.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 
text: ROMEO'S P.O.V.: An endless marble corridor lit by hundreds
text: of tiny flickering eternal flames.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Romeo. He murmurs:
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: In despite I'll cram thee with more
dialog: food.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly a hurricane wind and whirr of machinery: like a
text: huge black insect, Captain Prince's chopper swoops down over
dialog: the mausoleum.
dialog: 
text: Romeo is caught in the glare of the chopper's burning arc
text: light. Sirens scream, police units race through the cemetery.
text: Blinded, Romeo fires wildly toward the chopper.
dialog: 
text: The police cars screech to a halt.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: A police marksman in the chopper. His finger
text: squeezes the rifle trigger.
dialog: 
text: BANG! A bullet slams into Romeo's shoulder. The other cops
text: open fire and Romeo is sent reeling backwards into the
text: mausoleum in a fusillade of bullets.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHOPPER. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: An angry Captain Prince bellows into the radio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN PRINCE
dialog: Hold! Hold!
dialog: 
text: The police hold their fire.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Bleeding from the shoulder wound, Romeo drags shut the heavy
text: double doors of the chapel. He bangs off three shots
text: through a pane of broken glass and screams at the police.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Stand all aloof!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Outside the chopper hovers. Police take up siege positions.
text: Captain Prince's voice echoes through the bullhorn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN PRINCE
dialog: Romeo, come forth, come forth.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Romeo uses the crowbar to wedge the doors shut. He bangs

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Tempt not a desperate man!
dialog: 
text: Romeo waits. There is no response from the cops.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHOPPER. NIGHT.

speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE

scene_heading: INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: TRACK: Down the marble corridor lit by the eternal flames.
dialog: 
text: DISCOVER: Romeo. He weakly stands at the entrance to the
dialog: viewing chapel.
dialog: 
text: The chapel is dark.
dialog: 
text: As Romeo's eyes adjust he can just see, picked out by a
text: shaft of blue moonlight, the glowing figure of a sleeping
text: girl. He moves down the aisle past the tombs of long-dead
dialog: Capulets.
dialog: 
text: Romeo is close now. He halts as if in the presence of an
text: unbelievable vision. He lights a match and the room glows
text: gold. The warm light reveals a Juliet even more beautiful
text: in seeming death.
dialog: 
text: Romeo lights some of the hundreds of candles that surround
dialog: her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: O my love, my wife,
dialog: Death, that hath sucked the honey

dialog: Is crimson in thy lips and in thy
dialog: cheeks,
dialog: And death's pale flag is not
dialog: advanced there.
dialog: 
text: Romeo kneels close, as if not wanting to wake a sleeping
text: child. Unconscious tears fall from his eyes as he whispers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
dialog: Ah, dear Juliet, why art thou yet
dialog: so fair?
dialog: Shall I believe that unsubstantial
speaker_heading: DEATH
dialog: Is amorous and keeps thee here in
speaker_heading: DARK
dialog: To be his paramour? For fear of
speaker_heading: THAT
dialog: I still will stay with thee. Here,
dialog: oh here
dialog: Will I set up my everlasting rest
dialog: And shake the yoke of inauspicious
speaker_heading: STARS
dialog: From this world-wearied flesh.
dialog: 
text: He lays himself close.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
dialog: Eyes, look your last.
dialog: Arms, take your last embrace. And,
dialog: lips, O you
text: The doors of breath, seal with a
dialog: righteous kiss...
dialog: 
text: Gently Romeo kisses Juliet's lips. Ever so slightly,
text: Juliet's hand moves - Romeo does not notice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
text: A dateless bargain to engrossing
dialog: death.
dialog: 
text: Romeo drinks from the vial; the power of the compound is
text: immediate. He convulses and falls, his head resting on
dialog: Juliet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO (CONT.)
dialog: (fighting for breath)
dialog: O true apothecary, thy drugs are
dialog: quick.
dialog: 
text: Behind Romeo's head we can see Juliet's eyes opening. Romeo
text: sucks the last few breaths of life into his lungs. Through
text: a blurry consciousness Juliet becomes aware of Romeo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Oh Romeo, what's here?
dialog: 
text: Forcing herself up, she cradles his head in her arms.
text: Romeo's clear wide eyes stare back, he is completely still
text: but for the sound of weak breaths desperately drawn across
text: motionless lips.
dialog: 
text: Juliet finds the vial clenched in Romeo's hand. Tears slip
text: from her eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET (CONT.)
dialog: Drunk all, and left
dialog: No friendly drop to help me after.
dialog: I will kiss thy lips.
dialog: Haply some poison yet doth hang on
speaker_heading: THEM
dialog: To make me die with a restorative.
dialog: 
text: She delicately kisses Romeo's lips.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET (CONT.)
dialog: (a heart-broken whisper)
dialog: Thy lips are warm.
dialog: 
text: Desperately the lovers cling to each other. With all his
dialog: desire to stay alive, Romeo whispers:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Thus with a kiss I die.
dialog: 
text: There is no breath. He is still. Silence. Sobbing, Juliet
text: hugs the lifeless Romeo to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Romeo. O' my true love Romeo.
dialog: 
text: She looks to the gun in his hand.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: TRACK: Quickly past Captain Prince and the Capulets taking
text: cover behind a patrol car.
dialog: 
text: Two police officers urgently convey Montague and his wife
text: toward them.
dialog: 
text: Discover Father Laurence arriving.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: Father Laurence's P.O.V.: Patrol cars, lights
text: flashing, surround the mausoleum.
dialog: 
text: He sees, through the open door of a police car, a hand-
text: cuffed youth. It is Balthasar. Father Laurence hurries to
dialog: him.
dialog: 
text: It is dawning on Father Laurence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: Balthasar?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BALTHASAR
speaker_heading: (DESPERATELY)
dialog: I brought news of Juliet's death...
dialog: And then in post came Romeo from
speaker_heading: MANTUA
dialog: To this same place... to this same
dialog: monument.
dialog: 
dialog: CLOSE ON: Father Laurence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: How long hath he been there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BALTHASAR
text: Full half an hour.
dialog: 
text: Father Laurence turns towards the mausoleum.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: Romeo.
dialog: (a shock of realisation)
text: The lady stirs...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: TRACK SLOW TOWARD: Juliet: Sobbing uncontrollably she prises
text: the gun from Romeo's hand.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Father Laurence, desperate, breaks through the police line
text: and runs toward the mausoleum.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: The parents and Captain Prince.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN PRINCE
dialog: Hold! Go not forth!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Juliet turns the gun on herself.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Father Laurence, he screams as he mounts the
text: mausoleum stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER LAURENCE
dialog: The lady stirs!
dialog: 
text: CRACK! The sound of a single gun shot rips through the night.
dialog: 
dialog: CUT TO: Captain Prince.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: The parents, a look of cold shock.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: The priest - his cry echoes through the night.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Juliet lies peacefully on Romeo's chest. Her eyes awake. A
text: wash of deep red blood floods across them both. As we move
text: away from the forms of the two young lovers lit by a ring of
text: candles, the police burst in, guns ready to resolve what has
text: already been resolved. Continuing up, we pass through the
text: glass dome of the viewing chapel, and over the building.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: There, huddled at the base of the Mausoleum steps, are the
text: Montague and Capulet parents and Father Laurence.
dialog: 
text: From high up we see Captain Prince emerge from the Mausoleum
text: and speak to the group. A moment, then their cries float
text: gently up.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SKY. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: We are travelling high into the sky now. The cries of the
text: parents and the buzz of radio calls fade to nothing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VERONA BEACH STREET - CHRIST ROUNDABOUT-FROM AIR. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: As the sun struggled to rise, we push toward the figure of
text: Jesus silently surveying the city.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VERONA BEACH - CHRIST ROUNDABOUT. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: As Jesus' face fills the screen, droplets of water begin to
text: streak his cheeks.
dialog: 
text: HOLD: Music swells; the droplets grow to a torrent, and a
text: heavy rain begins to fall.
dialog: 
dialog: For a long beat, we stay with this image.
dialog: 
text: CRANE DOWN: From the Jesus. A sea of black umbrellas
text: stretches back from the steps of Freedom Tower.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FREEDOM TOWER. DAY.
dialog: 
text: At the top of the steps are a pair of flower strewn caskets.
text: Before the caskets stand Fulgencia and Gloria Capulet, and
text: Ted and Caroline Montague. They stare with blank,
text: uncomprehending sorrow.
dialog: 
text: Among the crowd we see the distraught faces of Benvolio,
text: Balthasar, Father Laurence and the Nurse.
dialog: 
text: The caskets are gently slid into a pair of long black cars.
text: Montague and Capulet descend the stairs. Captain Prince
text: blocks their path. He holds them in his gaze.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN PRINCE
dialog: See what a scourge is laid upon
dialog: your hate,
dialog: That heaven finds means to kill
dialog: your joys with love;
dialog: And I, for winking at your discords
dialog: too,
dialog: Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All
dialog: are punished.
dialog: 
text: The Prince steps aside. The procession moves off. Montague
text: and Capulet look to one another, a moment, and then the two
text: adversaries together follow the bodies of their dead children.
dialog: 
text: AERIAL SHOT: The rain falls. Two black cars lead the people
text: of Verona Beach in a sorrowful parade.
dialog: 
text: As the cars pass beneath the towering effigy of Jesus, the
text: image pixilates into a television picture.
dialog: 
text: PULL OUT: A TV anchor woman watches the image on a studio
dialog: monitor.
dialog: 
dialog: She turns:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANCHOR WOMAN
dialog: (to camera)
text: A glooming peace this morning with
dialog: it brings:
dialog: The sun for sorrow will not show
text: his head.
dialog: Go hence, to have more talk of
dialog: these sad things.
dialog: Some shall be pardoned, and some
dialog: punished,
dialog: For never was a story of more woe
dialog: Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
dialog: 
text: The anchor woman changes beat to the next story; but her
text: dialogue fades, and her image gets smaller as the television
text: recedes into a black distance.
dialog: 
dialog: The music that reminds us most of these two lost lives
text: swells. When the television is very small it is switched off.
dialog: 
text: BLACK SCREEN. HOLD A BEAT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE END
