text: LONE STARR takes the card off the SELF-DESTRUCT
text: GUARD'S belt. He inserts it into a panel and moves a switch to pull
dialog: up
text: the green bars. The green bars disappear. LONE STARR walks up to the
dialog: self-destruct
text: button. It says, &quot;DO NOT PUSH UNLESS YOU REALLY, REALLY, MEAN
dialog: IT.&quot;
text: LONE STARR begins to press the button.
text: HELMET (mask down) Not so fast, Lone Starr. (walks
dialog: in)
text: LONE STARR Helmet. So, at last we meet for the
dialog: first time for the last time. (thinks about what he said) Yeah.
dialog: HELMET Before you die, there is something you
dialog: should know about us, Lone Starr.
speaker_heading: LONE STARR What?
dialog: HELMET I am your father's brother's nephew's cousin's
dialog: former room-mate.
dialog: LONE STARR What's that make us?
dialog: HELMET Absolutely nothing. Which is what you are
text: about to become. Prepare to die.
text: HELMET puts his Schwartz ring on. He puts his
text: hands next to his crouch. A green light beam similar to a light
text: saber.
text: LONE STARR does the same.
dialog: HELMET You have the ring, and I see your Schwartz
dialog: is as big as mine.
text: Both look at their beams.
dialog: HELMET Now let's see how well you handle it.
text: HELMET walks over to LONE STARR and starts to
text: fight with him. They swipe at each other with their beams. HELMET
dialog: pulls
text: back a little too far and knocks off the sound manager from the
dialog: stage crew.
text: He screams and falls off a ledge. LONE STARR and HELMET stop
dialog: fighting.
dialog: HELMET Ummm, he did it.
speaker_heading: LONE STARR What?
text: LONE STARR swipes at HELMET. HELMET blocks it.
text: They start fighting again. They swipe at each other until their
dialog: beams become
dialog: twisted.
dialog: HELMET Shit. I hate it when I get my Schwartz
dialog: twisted. Okay, maybe if my put leg up on yours we can split apart.
text: HELMET puts his foot on LONE STARR'S leg.
dialog: HELMET Good, yeah. On three; one, two, three,
dialog: go.
text: HELMET and LONE STARR pull away from each other.
text: Their beams disappear. HELMET looks up and recreates his beam. He
dialog: points
text: it at LONE STARR. LONE STARR does the same and points his at HELMET.
dialog: They
text: move in closer. Their beams touch ends. They are trying to cause the
dialog: other
text: to lose their beam. HELMET loses his beam. LONE STARR swipes at
speaker_heading: HELMET'S
text: helmet. It doesn't make a mark. He tries again, same. He tries
dialog: again, same.
text: HELMET lifts his mask up and laughs at him. LONE STARR'S beam
dialog: disappears.
text: He punches HELMET'S face. HELMET'S mask falls down. He recreates his
dialog: beam
text: and charges at LONE STARR. LONE STARR holds him back with his hand.
speaker_heading: HELMET
text: swipes at him several times. LONE STARR lets go of HELMET. HELMET
dialog: runs
text: into a locker with his helmet.
dialog: HELMET So, Lone Starr, Yogurt has taught you well.
dialog: If there is one thing I despise, it is a fair fight. But if I must
dialog: than
dialog: I must. May the best man win. Put 'er there. (offers to shake his
dialog: hand)
text: LONE STARR goes to shake his hand. HELMET takes
text: the ring off LONE STARR'S hand.
dialog: HELMET The ring. I can't believe you fell for
dialog: the oldest trick in the book. What a goof. What's with you man? Come
dialog: on.
dialog: You know what? No, here let me give it back to you. (offers the ring
dialog: back)
text: LONE STARR goes up to get the ring back. HELMET
text: throws it in a grate. The ring goes in the grate. LONE STARR tries
dialog: to catch
text: it and falls to the grate.
dialog: HELMET Oh, look. You fell for that, too. I can't
dialog: believe it man.
text: LONE STARR gets up and runs to a corner.
dialog: HELMET So, Lone Starr, now you see that evil will
dialog: always triumph, because good is dumb.
text: HELMET fires a green beam at LONE STARR. LONE
text: STARR dodges. HELMET tries again. LONE STARR dodges. HELMET tries
dialog: again.
text: LONE STARR dodges. LONE STARR backs into another corner.
dialog: HELMET Very impressive, Lone Starr. Too bad this
dialog: isn't the Wide World of Sports.
dialog: YOGURT'S VOICE Use the Schwartz, Lone Starr. Use
dialog: the Schwartz.
dialog: LONE STARR I can't. I lost the ring.
scene_heading: YOGURT'S VOICE(O.S.) Forget the ring. The ring
dialog: is pumpkin. I found it in a Cracker Jack box. The Schwartz is in

dialog: LONE STARR All right. I'll try.
dialog: HELMET Say goodbye to your two best friends, and
dialog: I don't mean your pals in the Winnebago.
text: LONE STARR points his fist at a mirror on a shelf.
text: It starts to move towards him. HELMET fires another green beam at
text: his crouch.
text: LONE STARR catches the mirror, and cover his crouch. The beam
dialog: reflects
text: off the mirror to HELMET. It hits HELMET'S crouch. HELMET falls back
dialog: into
