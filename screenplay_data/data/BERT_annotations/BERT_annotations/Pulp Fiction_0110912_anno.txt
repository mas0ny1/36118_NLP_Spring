scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP  MORNING
text: A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles.
text: It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed,
text: there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching
text: on bacon and eating eggs.
text: Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The
text: Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and,
dialog: like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're
text: going out of style.
text: It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or
text: how old she is; everything she does contradicts something
text: she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is
text: to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm
dialog: through doin' that shit.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: You always say that, the same thing
dialog: every time: never again, I'm through,
dialog: too dangerous.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: I know that's what I always say. I'm
dialog: always right too, but 
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog:  but you forget about it in a day
dialog: or two -
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog:  yeah, well, the days of me
dialog: forgittin' are over, and the days of
dialog: me rememberin' have just begun.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: When you go on like this, you know
dialog: what you sound like?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: I sound like a sensible fucking man,
dialog: is what I sound like.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: You sound like a duck.
dialog: (imitates a duck)
text: Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,
dialog: quack, quack...
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Well take heart, 'cause you're never
dialog: gonna hafta hear it again. Because
dialog: since I'm never gonna do it again,
dialog: you're never gonna hafta hear me
dialog: quack about how I'm never gonna do
dialog: it again.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: After tonight.
text: The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in
text: there, back and forth.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: Correct. I got all tonight to quack.
text: A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Can I get anybody anymore coffee?
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Oh yes, thank you.
text: The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man
text: lights up another cigarette.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: I'm doin' fine.
text: The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his
dialog: smoke.
text: The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her
dialog: coffee.
text: The Young Man goes right back into it.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: I mean the way it is now, you're
dialog: takin' the same fuckin' risk as when
dialog: you rob a bank. You take more of a
dialog: risk. Banks are easier! Federal
dialog: banks aren't supposed to stop you
dialog: anyway, during a robbery. They're
dialog: insured, why should they care? You
dialog: don't even need a gun in a federal
dialog: bank. I heard about this guy, walked
text: into a federal bank with a portable
text: phone, handed the phone to the teller,
text: the guy on the other end of the phone
dialog: said: "We got this guy's little girl,
dialog: and if you don't give him all your
dialog: money, we're gonna kill 'er."
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Did it work?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm
text: talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in
text: a bank with a telephone, not a pistol,
dialog: not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone,
dialog: cleans the place out, and they don't
dialog: lift a fuckin' finger.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Did they hurt the little girl?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: I don't know. There probably never
dialog: was a little girl  the point of the
dialog: story isn't the little girl. The
dialog: point of the story is they robbed
text: the bank with a telephone.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: You wanna rob banks?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks,
dialog: I'm just illustrating that if we
dialog: did, it would be easier than what we
dialog: been doin'.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: So you don't want to be a bank robber?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Naw, all those guys are goin' down
dialog: the same road, either dead or servin'
dialog: twenty.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: And no more liquor stores?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: What have we been talking about?
dialog: Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides,
dialog: it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too
dialog: many foreigners own liquor stores.
dialog: Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't
dialog: fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em:
dialog: "Empty out the register," and they
dialog: don't know what it fuckin' means.
dialog: They make it too personal. We keep
dialog: on, one of those gook motherfuckers'
dialog: gonna make us kill 'em.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: I'm not gonna kill anybody.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: I don't wanna kill anybody either.
dialog: But they'll probably put us in a
dialog: situation where it's us of them. And
dialog: if it's not the gooks, it these old
dialog: Jews who've owned the store for
dialog: fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got
dialog: Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the
dialog: counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try
dialog: walkin' into one of those stores
dialog: with nothin' but a telephone, see
dialog: how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget
dialog: it, we're out of it.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Well, what else is there, day jobs?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Not this life.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Well what then?
text: He calls to the Waitress.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Garcon! Coffee!
text: Then looks to his girl.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: This place.
text: The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: (snotty)
dialog: "Garcon" means boy.
text: She splits.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Here? It's a coffee shop.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: What's wrong with that? People never
dialog: rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor
dialog: stores, gas stations, you get your
text: head blown off stickin' up one of
dialog: them. Restaurants, on the other hand,
dialog: you catch with their pants down.
dialog: They're not expecting to get robbed,
dialog: or not as expecting.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: (taking to idea)
dialog: I bet in places like this you could
dialog: cut down on the hero factor.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Correct. Just like banks, these places
dialog: are insured. The managers don't give
dialog: a fuck, they're just tryin' to get
dialog: ya out the door before you start
dialog: pluggin' diners. Waitresses, forget
dialog: it, they ain't takin' a bullet for
text: the register. Busboys, some wetback
dialog: gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour
dialog: gonna really give a fuck you're
dialog: stealin' from the owner. Customers
dialog: are sittin' there with food in their
dialog: mouths, they don't know what's goin'
dialog: on. One minute they're havin' a Denver
dialog: omelet, next minute somebody's
text: stickin' a gun in their face.
text: The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man
text: continues in a low voice.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: See, I got the idea last liquor store
dialog: we stuck up. 'Member all those
dialog: customers kept comin' in?
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Then you got the idea to take
dialog: everybody's wallet.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: That was a good idea.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: We made more from the wallets then
dialog: we did the register.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Yes we did.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: A lot of people go to restaurants.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: A lot of wallets.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Pretty smart, huh?
text: The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new
dialog: information.
text: She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The
text: tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the
text: motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the
text: COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Pretty smart.
dialog: (into it)
dialog: I'm ready, let's go, right here,
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Remember, same as before, you're
dialog: crowd control, I handle the employees.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Got it.
text: They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on
text: the table. He looks at her and she back at him.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: I love you, Pumpkin.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: I love you, Honey Bunny.
text: And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons,
text: stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona
text: is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is
text: that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: (yelling to all)
dialog: Everybody be cool this is a robbery!
speaker_heading: HONEY BUNNY
dialog: Any of you fuckin' pricks move and
dialog: I'll execute every one of you
dialog: motherfuckers! Got that?

scene_heading: INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING)  MORNING
text: An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS
text: down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front
dialog: seat are two young fellas  one white, one black  both
text: wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long
text: green dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES
text: WINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog:  Okay now, tell me about the hash
dialog: bars?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What so you want to know?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Well, hash is legal there, right?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a
dialog: hundred percent legal. I mean you
dialog: can't walk into a restaurant, roll a
dialog: joint, and start puffin' away. You're
dialog: only supposed to smoke in your home
dialog: or certain designated places.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Those are hash bars?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's
dialog: legal to buy it, it's legal to own
dialog: it and, if you're the proprietor of
dialog: a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
dialog: It's legal to carry it, which doesn't
dialog: really matter 'cause  get a load of
dialog: this  if the cops stop you, it's
dialog: illegal for this to search you.
dialog: Searching you is a right that the
dialog: cops in Amsterdam don't have.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: That did it, man  I'm fuckin' goin',
dialog: that's all there is to it.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You'll dig it the most. But you know
dialog: what the funniest thing about Europe
dialog: is?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: It's the little differences. A lotta
dialog: the same shit we got here, they got
dialog: there, but there they're a little
dialog: different.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Examples?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer
dialog: in a movie theatre. And I don't mean
dialog: in a paper cup either. They give you
text: a glass of beer, like in a bar. In
dialog: Paris, you can buy beer at
dialog: MacDonald's. Also, you know what
dialog: they call a Quarter Pounder with
dialog: Cheese in Paris?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: They don't call it a Quarter Pounder
dialog: with Cheese?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: No, they got the metric system there,
dialog: they wouldn't know what the fuck a
dialog: Quarter Pounder is.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: What'd they call it?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
text: Royale with Cheese.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: (repeating)
dialog: Royale with Cheese. What'd they call
dialog: a Big Mac?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call
dialog: it Le Big Mac.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Le Big Mac. What do they call a
dialog: Whopper?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger
dialog: King. But you know what they put on
dialog: french fries in Holland instead of
dialog: ketchup?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Mayonnaise.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Goddamn!
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a
text: little bit on the side of the plate,
dialog: they fuckin' drown 'em in it.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Uuccch!

speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: We should have shotguns for this

speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: How many up there?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Three or four.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Counting our guy?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I'm not sure.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: So there could be five guys up there?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: It's possible.
speaker_heading: VINCENT

dialog: We TRACK alongside.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What's her name?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Mia.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: How did Marsellus and her meet?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I dunno, however people meet people.
dialog: She usta be an actress.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: She ever do anything I woulda saw?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I think her biggest deal was she
dialog: starred in a pilot.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What's a pilot?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Well, you know the shows on TV?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I don't watch TV.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Yes, but you're aware that there's
dialog: an invention called television, and
dialog: on that invention they show shows?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Well, the way they pick the shows on
dialog: TV is they make one show, and that
dialog: show's called a pilot. And they show
dialog: that one show to the people who pick
dialog: the shows, and on the strength of
dialog: that one show, they decide if they
dialog: want to make more shows. Some get
dialog: accepted and become TV programs, and
dialog: some don't, and become nothing. She
dialog: starred in one of the ones that became
dialog: nothing.
text: They enter the apartment building.
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING)  MORNING
text: Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait
dialog: for the elevator.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-
dialog: black, half-Samoan, usta call him
dialog: Tony Rocky Horror.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Yeah maybe, fat right?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I wouldn't go so far as to call the
dialog: brother fat. He's got a weight
dialog: problem. What's the nigger gonna
dialog: do, he's Samoan.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I think I know who you mean, what
dialog: about him?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up
dialog: good. And word around the campfire,
dialog: it was on account of Marsellus
dialog: Wallace's wife.
text: The elevator arrives, the men step inside.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR  MORNING
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What'd he do, fuck her?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: No no no no no no no, nothin' that
dialog: bad.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Well what then?
speaker_heading: JULES
text: He gave her a foot massage.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: A foot massage?
text: Jules nods his head: "Yes."
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: That's all?
text: Jules nods his head: "Yes."
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What did Marsellus do?
speaker_heading: JULES
text: Sent a couple of guys over to his
dialog: place. They took him out on the
text: patio of his apartment, threw his
text: ass over the balcony. Nigger fell
dialog: four stories. They had this garden
text: at the bottom, enclosed in glass,
dialog: like one of them greenhouses  nigger
dialog: fell through that. Since then, he's
dialog: kinda developed a speech impediment.
text: The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: That's a damn shame.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY  MORNING
text: STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline
text: down the hall.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Still I hafta say, play with matches,
dialog: ya get burned.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Whaddya mean?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You don't be givin' Marsellus
text: Wallace's new bride a foot massage.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: You don't think he overreacted?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Antwan probably didn't expect
dialog: Marsellus to react like he did, but
dialog: he had to expect a reaction.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: It was a foot massage, a foot massage
dialog: is nothing, I give my mother a foot
dialog: massage.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
text: It's laying hands on Marsellus
text: Wallace's new wife in a familiar
dialog: way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out
dialog:  no, but you're in the same fuckin'
text: ballpark.
text: Jules stops Vincent.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right
dialog: there. Eatin' a bitch out, and givin'
dialog: a bitch a foot massage ain't even
dialog: the same fuckin' thing.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
text: Not the same thing, the same ballpark.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: It ain't no ballpark either. Look
dialog: maybe your method of massage differs
dialog: from mine, but touchin' his lady's
dialog: feet, and stickin' your tongue in
dialog: her holyiest of holyies, ain't the
dialog: same ballpark, ain't the same league,
dialog: ain't even the same fuckin' sport.
dialog: Foot massages don't mean shit.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Have you ever given a foot massage?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Don't be tellin' me about foot
dialog: massages  I'm the foot fuckin'
dialog: master.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Given a lot of 'em?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Shit yeah. I got my technique down
dialog: man, I don't tickle or nothin'.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Have you ever given a guy a foot
dialog: massage?
text: Jules looks at him a long moment  he's been set up.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Fuck you.
text: He starts walking down the hall. Vincent, smiling, walks a
text: little bit behind.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: How many?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Fuck you.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Would you give me a foot massage 
dialog: I'm kinda tired.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Man, you best back off, I'm gittin'
dialog: pissed  this is the door.
text: The two men stand in front of the door numbered "49." They
dialog: whisper.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (checking his watch)
text: Seven-twenty-two in the morning.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: It ain't quite time, let's hang back.
text: They move a little away from the door, facing each other,
text: still whispering.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Look, just because I wouldn't give
dialog: no man a foot massage, don't make it
dialog: right for Marsellus to throw Antwan
text: off a building into a glass-
dialog: motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the
dialog: way the nigger talks. That ain't
dialog: right, man. Motherfucker do that to
dialog: me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause
dialog: I'd kill'a motherfucker.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I'm not sayin' he was right, but
dialog: you're sayin' a foot massage don't
dialog: mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does.
dialog: I've given a million ladies a million
dialog: foot massages and they all meant
dialog: somethin'. We act like they don't,
dialog: but they do. That's what's so fuckin'
dialog: cool about 'em. This sensual thing's
dialog: goin' on that nobody's talkin about,
dialog: but you know it and she knows it,
dialog: fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan
dialog: shoulda known fuckin' better. That's
dialog: his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna
dialog: have a sense of humor about that
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: That's an interesting point, but
dialog: let's get into character.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What's her name again?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Mia. Why you so interested in big
dialog: man's wife?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida
dialog: and when he's gone, he wants me to
dialog: take care of Mia.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Take care of her?
text: Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Not that! Take her out. Show her a
dialog: good time. Don't let her get lonely.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace
dialog: out on a date?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: It ain't a date. It's like when you
dialog: and your buddy's wife go to a movie
dialog: or somethin'. It's just... you know...
dialog: good company.
text: Jules just looks at him.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: It's not a date.

speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Hey kids.
text: The two men stroll inside.
text: The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:
text: MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the
text: scene progresses, back into the corner.
text: ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of

text: table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.
text: BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.

speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: How you boys doin'?
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: JULES

dialog: Am I trippin', or did I just ask you
dialog: a question.
speaker_heading: BRETT
dialog: We're doin' okay.
text: As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Do you know who we are?
text: Brett shakes his head: "No."
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: We're associates of your business
dialog: partner Marsellus Wallace, you
dialog: remember your business partner
dialog: dont'ya?
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: (to Brett)
dialog: Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here:
dialog: you're Brett, right?
speaker_heading: BRETT
dialog: I'm Brett.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I thought so. Well, you remember
dialog: your business partner Marsellus
dialog: Wallace, dont'ya Brett?
speaker_heading: BRETT
dialog: I remember him.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Good for you. Looks like me and
dialog: Vincent caught you at breakfast,
dialog: sorry 'bout that. What'cha eatin'?
speaker_heading: BRETT
dialog: Hamburgers.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any
dialog: nutritious breakfast. What kinda
dialog: hamburgers?
speaker_heading: BRETT
dialog: Cheeseburgers.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: No, I mean where did you get'em?
dialog: MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-
dialog: Box, where?
speaker_heading: BRETT
dialog: Big Kahuna Burger.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Big Kahuna Burger. That's that
dialog: Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they
dialog: got some tasty burgers. I ain't never
dialog: had one myself, how are they?
speaker_heading: BRETT
dialog: They're good.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Mind if I try one of yours?
speaker_heading: BRETT
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Yours is this one, right?
speaker_heading: BRETT
dialog: Yeah.
text: Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.
dialog: (to Vincent)
dialog: Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna
dialog: Burger?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: No.
text: Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: You wanna bite, they're real good.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I ain't hungry.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Well, if you like hamburgers give
dialog: 'em a try sometime. Me, I can't
dialog: usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's
dialog: a vegetarian. Which more or less
dialog: makes me a vegetarian, but I sure
dialog: love the taste of a good burger.
dialog: (to Brett)
dialog: You know what they call a Quarter
dialog: Pounder with Cheese in France?
speaker_heading: BRETT

speaker_heading: ROGER
text: It's under the bed.
text: Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out
text: a black snap briefcase.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Got it.
text: Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see
text: what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent
text: just stares at it, transfixed.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: We happy?
text: No answer from the transfixed Vincent.
speaker_heading: JULES

speaker_heading: BRETT
dialog: I just want you to know how sorry we

dialog: between us and Mr. Wallace. When we
dialog: entered into this thing, we only had
dialog: the best intentions 
text: As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger
text: three times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.
text: Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.
text: Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering,
text: but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: (to Brett)
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your
dialog: concentration? I didn't mean to do
dialog: that. Please, continue. I believe
dialog: you were saying something about "best
dialog: intentions."
text: Brett can't say a word.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through
dialog: anyway. Well, let me retort. Would
dialog: you describe for me what Marsellus
dialog: Wallace looks like?
text: Brett still can't speak.
text: Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing
text: the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits
text: in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in
text: front of an interrogator.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: What country you from!
speaker_heading: BRETT
dialog: (petrified)
dialog: What?

speaker_heading: JULES

speaker_heading: BRETT
dialog: (in agony)
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: BRETT
dialog: (in spasm)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: There's a passage I got memorized,
dialog: seems appropriate for this situation:
dialog: Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the
text: righteous man is beset on all sides
dialog: by the inequities of the selfish and
dialog: the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is
dialog: he who, in the name of charity and
dialog: good will, shepherds the weak through

speaker_heading: ENGLISH DAVE
text: He's over there, finishing up some

text: VINCENT'S POV: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with

speaker_heading: MARSELLUS (O.S.)
text: Vincent Vega has entered the building,
dialog: git your ass over here!
text: Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another

text: looking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching
dialog: business.
text: BUTCH'S POV: Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure

speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: ...I'll lend it to you. It's a great
dialog: book on body piercing.
text: Jody, Vincent and a young woman named TRUDI sit at the kitchen
text: table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Even though Vince is
text: at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.
speaker_heading: TRUDI
dialog: You know how they use that gun when
dialog: they pierce your ears? They don't
dialog: use that when they pierce your
dialog: nipples, do they?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Forget that gun. That gun goes against
dialog: the entire idea behind piercing. All
dialog: of my piercing, sixteen places on my
dialog: body, every one of 'em done with a
text: needle. Five in each ear. One through
dialog: the nipple on my left breast. One
dialog: through my right nostril. One through
text: my left eyebrow. One through my lip.
dialog: One in my clit. And I wear a stud in
dialog: my tongue.
dialog: Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear
text: and out the other, until that last remark.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm
dialog: curious, why would you get a stud in
dialog: your tongue?
text: Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious
dialog: thing in the world.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.
text: That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it
text: makes sense. Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent

speaker_heading: LANCE (O.S.)

scene_heading: INT. LANCE'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

speaker_heading: VINCENT

speaker_heading: LANCE

scene_heading: EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S  NIGHT
dialog: In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over
dialog: L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're
text: all basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book,
text: Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer,
text: saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the
text: Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and
dialog: over prices that pay for all this bullshit.
text: But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's
text: diners.
dialog: Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of
dialog: view.
text: Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with
text: a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a

text: the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that
dialog: is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine."
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What the fuck is this place?
speaker_heading: MIA

speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: After you, kitty-cat.
scene_heading: INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S  NIGHT
text: Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint
text: English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over
dialog: the wall
text: ("ROCK ALL NIGHT," "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL," "ATTACK OF
text: THE CRAB MONSTER," and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that
text: the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s
dialog: cars.
text: In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign
text: on the wall states, "No shoes allowed." Some wannabe beboppers
dialog: (actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or
dialog: barefeet.
text: The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead,
text: B &amp; W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The
text: WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons:
scene_heading: MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and
text: LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing
dialog: appropriate costumes.
text: Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red

speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.
speaker_heading: BUDDY

speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Bloody as hell. And to drink, a

speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger 

speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: How d'ya want that shake, Martin and

speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Martin and Lewis.
speaker_heading: VINCENT

speaker_heading: MIA

speaker_heading: VINCENT

speaker_heading: MIA

speaker_heading: VINCENT

speaker_heading: BUDDY

speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Just checking.
text: Buddy exits.
text: Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are

speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Whaddya think?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
text: It's like a wax museum with a pulse

speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Rollin' a smoke.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Here?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: It's just tobacco.
speaker_heading: MIA

speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You can have this one, cowgirl.
text: He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to
text: her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's
text: hand. He lights it.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Think nothing of it.
text: He begins rolling one for himself.
text: As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner,
text: making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a
text: square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS
text: the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out
text: a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.
text: Back to Mia and Vincent.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Marsellus said you just got back
dialog: from Amsterdam.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: That was my fifteen minutes.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What was it?
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: It was show about a team of female
dialog: secret agents called "Fox Force Five."
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: "Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a
dialog: bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in
dialog: we're a force to be reckoned with.
dialog: Five, as in there's one... two ...
dialog: three... four... five of us. There
dialog: was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal
dialog: from that show "Baton Rouge," she
dialog: was the leader. A Japanese one, a
text: black one, a French one and a brunette
dialog: one, me. We all had special skills.
dialog: Sommerset had a photographic memory,
dialog: the Japanese fox was a kung fu master,
dialog: the black girl was a demolition
dialog: expert, the French fox' specialty
dialog: was sex...
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What was your specialty?
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Knives. The character I played, Raven
dialog: McCoy, her background was she was
dialog: raised by circus performers. So she
dialog: grew up doing a knife act. According
dialog: to the show, she was the deadliest
text: woman in the world with a knife. But
dialog: because she grew up in a circus, she
dialog: was also something of an acrobat.
dialog: She could do illusions, she was a
dialog: trapeze artist  when you're keeping
dialog: the world safe from evil, you never
dialog: know when being a trapeze artist's
dialog: gonna come in handy. And she knew a
dialog: zillion old jokes her grandfather,
dialog: an old vaudevillian, taught her. If
dialog: we woulda got picked up, they woulda
dialog: worked in a gimmick where every
dialog: episode I woulda told and ol joke.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Do you remember any of the jokes?
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Well I only got the chance to say
dialog: one, 'cause we only did one show.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Tell me.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: No. It's really corny.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: C'mon, don't be that way.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: No. You won't like it and I'll be
dialog: embarrassed.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You told it in front of fifty million
dialog: people and you can't tell it to me?
dialog: I promise I won't laugh.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: That's what I'm afraid of.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: That's not what I meant and you know
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: You're quite the silver tongue devil,
dialog: aren't you?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: That's not what you said Vince. Well
dialog: now I'm definitely not gonna tell
dialog: ya, 'cause it's been built up too
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What a gyp.
text: Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around
text: the straw of her shake.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Yummy!
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Can I have a sip of that? I'd like
dialog: to know what a five-dollar shake
dialog: tastes like.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Be my guest.
text: She slides the shake over to him.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: You can use my straw, I don't have
dialog: kooties.
text: Vincent smiles.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Yeah, but maybe I do.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Kooties I can handle.
text: He takes a sip.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin'
dialog: good milk shake.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Told ya.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I don't know if it's worth five
dialog: dollars, but it's pretty fuckin'
dialog: good.
text: He slides the shake back.
text: Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Don't you hate that?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Uncomfortable silences. Why do we
dialog: feel it's necessary to yak about
dialog: bullshit in order to be comfortable?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: That's when you know you found
dialog: somebody special. When you can just
dialog: shit the fuck up for a minute, and
text: comfortably share silence.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I don't think we're there yet. But
dialog: don't feel bad, we just met each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to
dialog: the bathroom and powder my nose,
dialog: while you sit here and think of
dialog: something to say.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I'll do that.
scene_heading: INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM)  NIGHT
text: Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the
text: bathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: (imitating Steppenwolf)
dialog: I said goddamn!
scene_heading: INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA)  NIGHT
text: Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his
text: eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.
text: Mia comes back to the table.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Don't you love it when you go to the
dialog: bathroom and you come back to find
dialog: your food waiting for you?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy
text: Holly doesn't seem to be much of a
dialog: waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn
dialog: Monroe's section.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Which one, there's two Marilyn
dialog: Monroes.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: No there's not.
text: Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: That's Marilyn Monroe...
text: Then, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and
text: capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS 
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: ... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I
dialog: don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it
dialog: must be her night off.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Pretty smart.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I have moments.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Did ya think of something to say?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Actually, there's something I've
dialog: wanted to ask you about, but you
dialog: seem like a nice person, and I didn't
dialog: want to offend you.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like
dialog: mindless, boring, getting-to-know-
dialog: you chit-chat. This sounds like you
dialog: actually have something to say.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Only if you promise not to get
dialog: offended.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: You can't promise something like
dialog: that. I have no idea what you're
dialog: gonna ask. You could ask me what
dialog: you're gonna ask me, and my natural
dialog: response could be to be offended.
dialog: Then, through no fault of my own, I
dialog: woulda broken my promise.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Then let's just forget it.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: That is an impossibility. Trying to
dialog: forget anything as intriguing as
dialog: this would be an exercise in futility.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Is that a fact?
text: Mia nods her head: "Yes."
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Besides, it's more exciting when you
dialog: don't have permission.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What do you think about what happened
dialog: to Antwan?
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Who's Antwan?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Tony Rocky Horror.
speaker_heading: MIA
text: He fell out of a window.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: That's one way to say it. Another
dialog: way is, he was thrown out. Another
dialog: was is, he was thrown out by
dialog: Marsellus. And even another way is,
text: he was thrown out of a window by
dialog: Marsellus because of you.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Is that a fact?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: No it's not, it's just what I heard.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Who told you this?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: They.
text: Mia and Vincent smile.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: They talk a lot, don't they?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: They certainly do.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Well don't by shy Vincent, what
dialog: exactly did they say?
text: Vincent is slow to answer.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Let me help you Bashful, did it
dialog: involve the F-word?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: No. They just said Rocky Horror gave
dialog: you a foot massage.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: And...?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: No and, that's it.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror
text: out of a four-story window because
dialog: he massaged my feet?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: And you believed that?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: At the time I was told, it seemed
dialog: reasonable.
speaker_heading: MIA
text: Marsellus throwing Tony out of a
dialog: four story window for giving me a
dialog: foot massage seemed reasonable?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: No, it seemed excessive. But that
dialog: doesn't mean it didn't happen. I
dialog: heard Marsellus is very protective
dialog: of you.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: A husband being protective of his
dialog: wife is one thing. A husband almost
dialog: killing another man for touching his
text: wife's feet is something else.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: But did it happen?
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: The only thing Antwan ever touched
dialog: of mine was my hand, when he shook
dialog: it. I met Anwan once  at my wedding
dialog:  then never again. The truth is,
dialog: nobody knows why Marsellus tossed
dialog: Tony Rocky Horror out of that window
dialog: except Marsellus and Tony Rocky
dialog: Horror. But when you scamps get
dialog: together, you're worse than a sewing
dialog: circle.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: ED SULLIVAN AND MARILYN MONROE STAND ON STAGE
speaker_heading: ED SULLIVAN
dialog: (into microphone)
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment
dialog: you've all been waiting for, the
dialog: worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist
dialog: contest.
text: Patrons cheer.
text: Ed Sullivan is with Marilyn Monroe, who holds a trophy.
speaker_heading: ED SULLIVAN
dialog: ...One lucky couple will win this
dialog: handsome trophy that Marilyn here is
dialog: holding.
text: Marilyn holds the trophy.
speaker_heading: ED SULLIVAN
dialog: ...Now, who will be our first
dialog: contestants?
text: Mia holds her hand.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Right here.
text: Vincent reacts.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: I wanna dance.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do
dialog: believe Marsellus, my husband, your
dialog: boss, told you to take me out and do
dialog: whatever I wanted, Now, I want to
dialog: dance. I want to win. I want that
dialog: trophy.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: So, dance good.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: All right, you asked for it.
text: Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.
speaker_heading: ED SULLIVAN
dialog: (into microphone)
dialog: Let's hear it for our first
dialog: contestants.
text: Patrons cheer.
text: Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone.
speaker_heading: ED SULLIVAN
dialog: Now let's meet our first contestants
dialog: here this evening. Young lady, what
dialog: is your name?
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: (into microphone)
dialog: Missus Mia Wallace.
speaker_heading: ED SULLIVAN
dialog: (into microphone)
dialog: And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: (into microphone)
dialog: Vincent Vega.
speaker_heading: ED SULLIVAN
dialog: (into microphone)
dialog: All right, let's see what you can
dialog: do. Take it away!
text: Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's "YOU NEVER CAN TELL".
text: They make hand movements as they dance.
scene_heading: INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME  NIGHT
text: The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-
text: style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the
text: previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.
dialog: Then...
text: The two just stand face to face looking at each other.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Was than an uncomfortable silence?
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: I don't know what that was.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Music and drinks!
text: Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his
text: overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I'm gonna take a piss.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: That was a little bit more information
dialog: than I needed to know, but go right
dialog: ahead.
text: Vincent shuffles off to the john.
text: Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs
text: and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high
text: energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She
text: dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's
text: overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It
dialog: feels good.
text: Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch.
text: Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco
text: on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks
text: the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a
text: little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so
text: anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out
text: his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg,
dialog: trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you
text: know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly
text: brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up,
text: then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.
text: The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she
text: takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in
text: the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something
text: else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder
text: inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance.
text: Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: (like you would say
dialog: Bingo!)
dialog: Disco! Vince, you little cola nut,
dialog: you've been holding out on me.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE)  NIGHT
text: Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to
text: himself in the mirror.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: One drink and leave. Don't be rude,
dialog: but drink your drink quickly, say
dialog: goodbye, walk out the door, get in
dialog: your car, and go down the road.
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines
text: on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred
text: dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the
dialog: fat line.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP  MIA
text: Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels
dialog: like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong.
dialog: Then... the rush hits...
speaker_heading: BATHROOM
text: Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his
text: dialogue with the mirror.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: ...It's a moral test of yourself,
dialog: whether or not you can maintain
dialog: loyalty. Because when people are
dialog: loyal to each other, that's very
dialog: meaningful.
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but
text: it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from
text: her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her
text: stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.
speaker_heading: BATHROOM
text: Vince continues.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: So you're gonna go out there, drink
dialog: your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had
dialog: a very lovely evening," go home, and
dialog: jack off. And that's all you're
dialog: gonna do.
text: Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's
text: ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of
text: that door. So he goes through it.
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to
text: the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like
text: a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are
text: down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the
text: tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her
text: face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open.
text: Slack-jawed.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Jesus Christ!
text: Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body.
text: Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck
text: to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.
text: Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (sounding weird)
dialog: Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?
text: But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles,
dialog: but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.
text: Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
dialog: (to Mia)
dialog: Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer
dialog: me honey, what did you take?
text: Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.
text: Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the
dialog: rack.
text: He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent
text: makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (yelling to Mia)
dialog: Okay honey, we're getting you on
dialog: your feet.
text: He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: We're on our feet now, and now we're
dialog: gonna talk out to the car. Here we
dialog: go, watch us walk.
text: We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-
text: unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.
scene_heading: EXT. VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING)  NIGHT
text: INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred.
text: Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws,
text: speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.
scene_heading: INT.VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING)  NIGHT
text: Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting
text: like Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when
text: he glances over at Mia.
text: Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag
dialog: of water.
text: Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket. He punches
dialog: a number.
scene_heading: INT. LANCE'S HOUSE  NIGHT
text: At this late hour, LANCE has transformed from a bon vivant
text: drug dealer to a bathrobe creature.
text: He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-
text: out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, "TAFT,
text: CALIFORNIA", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe. In his hand
text: is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries. In front of
text: him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n
text: Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in
text: an ashtray.
text: On the big-screen TV in front of the table is the Three
text: Stooges, and they're getting married.
speaker_heading: PREACHER (EMIL SIMKUS)
dialog: (on TV)
dialog: Hold hands, you love birds.
text: The phone RINGS.
text: Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone.
text: It RINGS again.
text: Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up.
speaker_heading: JODY (O.S.)
dialog: Lance! The phone's ringing!
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: (calling back)
dialog: I can hear it!
speaker_heading: JODY (O.S.)
dialog: I thought you told those fuckin'
dialog: assholes never to call this late!
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: (by the phone)
dialog: I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna
dialog: tell this fuckin' asshole right now!
dialog: (he answers the phone)
dialog: Hello, do you know how late it is?
dialog: You're not supposed to be callin' me
dialog: this fuckin' late.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: VINCENT IN THE MALIBU
text: Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching
text: the phone to his ear. WE CUT BACK AND FORTH during the
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big
dialog: fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way
dialog: to your place.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Whoa, hold you horses man, what's
dialog: the problem?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You still got an adrenaline shot?
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: (dawning on him)
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I need it man, I got a chick she's
dialog: fuckin' Doing on me.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Don't bring her here! I'm not even
dialog: fuckin' joking with you, don't you
dialog: be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt
dialog: to my house!
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: No choice.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: She's ODin'?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Yeah. She's dyin'.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take
dialog: 'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Negative.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: She ain't my fuckin' problem, you
dialog: fucked her up, you deal with it 
dialog: are you talkin' to me on a cellular
dialog: phone?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: I don't know you, who is this, don't
dialog: come here, I'm hangin' up.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Too late, I'm already here.
text: At that moment inside Lance's house, WE HEAR VINCENT's Malibu
text: coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his
text: curtains and YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH
text: in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn
text: and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out
text: of SHATTERS from the impact.
speaker_heading: JODY (O.S.)
dialog: What the hell was that?
text: Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front
dialog: lawn.
scene_heading: EXT. LANCE'S HOUSE  NIGHT
text: Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Have you lost your mind?! You crashed
dialog: your car in my fuckin' house! You
dialog: talk about drug shit on a cellular
dialog: fuckin' phone 
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: If you're through havin' your little
dialog: hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get
dialog: your needle and git it now!
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Are you deaf? You're not bringin'
dialog: that fucked up bitch in my house!
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: This fucked up bitch is Marsellus
dialog: Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin'
dialog: croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But
text: before he turns me into a bar soap,
dialog: I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about
dialog: how you coulda saved her life, but
dialog: instead you let her die on your front
dialog: lawn.
scene_heading: INT. LANCE'S HOUSE  NIGHT
text: WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom.
text: Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's
text: wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone
text: on it.
text: We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking
text: through the hall into the living room.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: It's only one-thirty in the goddamn
dialog: mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on
dialog: out here?
text: As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance
text: standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of
dialog: the room.
text: From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a
text: DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference
dialog: here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Who's she?
text: Lance looks up at Jody.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Get that black box in the bedroom I
dialog: have with the adrenaline shot.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: What's wrong with her?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: She's ODing on us.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Well get her the hell outta here!
scene_heading: LANCE AND VINCENT
dialog: (in stereo)
dialog: Get the fuckin' shot!
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Don't yell and me!
text: She angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking
dialog: for the shot.
text: WE MOVE into the room with the two men.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (to Lance)
dialog: You two are a match made in heaven.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay?
dialog: While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta
dialog: get a medical book.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What do you need a medical book for?
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: To tell me how to do it. I've never
text: given an adrenaline shot before.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You've had that thing for six years
dialog: and you never used it?
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: I never had to use it. I don't go
dialog: joypoppin' with bubble-gummers, all
dialog: of my friends can handle their highs!
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Well then get it.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: I am, if you'll let me.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin'
dialog: to her.
text: WE FOLLOW Lance as he runs out of the living room into a...
scene_heading: INT. SPARE ROOM
text: With a bunch of junk in it. He frantically starts scanning

speaker_heading: JODY (O.S.)
dialog: What are you lookin' for?
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: My black medical book!
text: As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit,
text: Jody appears in the doorway.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Whata're you looking for?
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: My black fuckin' medical book. It's
text: like a text book they give to nurses.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I never saw a medical book.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Trust me, I have one.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Well if it's that important, why
dialog: didn't you keep it with the shot?
text: Lance spins toward her.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: I don't know! Stop bothering me!
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: While you're lookin' for it, that

dialog: never gonna find it in all this shit.
dialog: For six months now, I've been telling
dialog: you to clean this room 
speaker_heading: VINCENT (O.S.)
dialog:  get your ass in here, fuck the
dialog: book!
text: Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the SHOT
text: heading for the living room.
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance
text: reenters the room.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Quit fuckin' around man and give her
dialog: the shot!
text: Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He
text: opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: While I'm doing this, take her shirt
text: off and find her heart.
text: Vince rips her blouse open.
text: Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Does it have to be exact?
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving
dialog: her an injection in the heart, so I
dialog: gotta exactly hit her in the heart.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Well, I don't know exactly where her
dialog: heart is, I think it's here.
text: Vince points to Mia's right breast. Lance glances over and
dialog: nods.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: That's it.
text: As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I need a big fat magic marker, got
dialog: one?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I need a big fat magic marker, any
dialog: felt pen'll do, but a magic marker
dialog: would be great.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Hold on.
text: Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her
text: enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents
text: of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor.
text: The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: It's ready, I'll tell you what to
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You're gonna give her the shot.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: No, you're gonna give her the shot.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I've never does this before.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: I've never done this before either,
dialog: and I ain't starting now. You brought
dialog: 'er here, that means you give her
dialog: the shot. The day I bring an ODing
dialog: bitch to your place, then I gotta
dialog: give her the shot.
text: Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic
text: marker in her hand.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Got it.
text: Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes
text: a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Okay, what do I do?
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Well, you're giving her an injection
text: of adrenaline straight to her heart.
text: But she's got a breast plate in front
dialog: of her heart, so you gotta pierce
dialog: through that. So what you gotta do
text: is bring the needle down in a stabbing
dialog: motion.
text: Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like "The
text: Shape" killing its victims in "HALLOWEEN".
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I gotta stab her?
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: If you want the needle to pierce
dialog: through to her heart, you gotta stab
dialog: her hard.
dialog: Then once you do, push down on the plunger.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What happens after that?
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: I'm curious about that myself.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: This ain't a fuckin' joke man!
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: She's supposed to come out of it
dialog: like 
dialog: (snaps his fingers)
dialog:  that.
text: Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing
dialog: motion.
text: He looks down on Mia.
text: Mia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her.
text: Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Count to three.
text: Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know
dialog: what to expect.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: One...
text: RED DOT on Mia's body.
text: Needle raised ready to strike.
speaker_heading: LANCE (O.S.)
dialog: ...two...
text: Jody's face is alive with anticipation.
text: NEEDLE in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike.
speaker_heading: LANCE (O.S.)
dialog: ...three!
text: The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard.
text: Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the
dialog: chest.
text: Mia's head is JOLTED from the impact.
text: The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline
text: out through the needle.
text: Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of
text: the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck
text: in her chest  SCREAMING.
text: Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in
text: front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.
text: Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of
dialog: air.
text: The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken
dialog: to their bones, look to see if she's alright.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: If you're okay, say something.
text: Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a
text: relatively normal voice.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Something.
text: Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and
text: shaking from how close to death Mia came.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Anybody want a beer?

text: a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway
text: toward her front door.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (O.S.)
dialog: Mia!
text: She turns around.
text: Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big

speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What are your thoughts on how to

speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: What's yours?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus
dialog: can live his whole live and never

text: Mia smiles.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Don't worry about it. If Marsellus
dialog: ever heard of this, I'd be in as

speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I seriously doubt that.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: If you can keep a secret, so can I.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Let's shake on it.
text: The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to

speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Mum's the word.
text: Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-

text: Vincent smiles.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home

speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE

text: Vincent turns around.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Sure, but I think I'm still a little

speaker_heading: MIA

dialog:  and says: catch up.
text: They both smile, but neither laugh.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: See ya 'round, Vince.
text: Mia turns and walks inside her house.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP  VINCENT
text: After Mia walks inside. Vincent continues to look at where

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: BUTCH'S POV
text: We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in
text: Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish,
text: stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to
text: her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force
text: officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old
dialog: boy.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Butch, stop watching TV a second. We
dialog: got a special visitor. Now do you
dialog: remember when I told you your daddy
dialog: dies in a P.O.W. camp?
speaker_heading: BUTCH (O.S.)
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Well this here is Capt. Koons. He
dialog: was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.
text: CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and
text: bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's
text: eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas
dialog: accent.
scene_heading: CAPT. KOONS
dialog: Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard
dialog: a bunch about you. See, I was a good
dialog: friend of your Daddy's. We were in
dialog: that Hanoi pit of hell over five
dialog: years together. Hopefully, you'll
dialog: never have to experience this
dialog: yourself, but when two men are in a
dialog: situation like me and your Daddy
dialog: were, for as long as we were, you
dialog: take on certain responsibilities of
dialog: the other. If it had been me who had
dialog: not made it, Major Coolidge would be
dialog: talkin' right now to my son Jim. But
dialog: the way it worked out is I'm talkin'
dialog: to you, Butch. I got somethin' for
dialog: ya.
text: The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.
scene_heading: CAPT. KOONS
dialog: This watch I got here was first
dialog: purchased by your great-granddaddy.
dialog: It was bought during the First World
text: War in a little general store in
dialog: Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought
dialog: by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge
dialog: the day he set sail for Paris. It
dialog: was your great-granddaddy's war watch,
dialog: made by the first company to ever
dialog: make wrist watches. You see, up until
dialog: then, people just carried pocket
dialog: watches. Your great-granddaddy wore
dialog: that watch every day he was in the
dialog: war. Then when he had done his duty,
dialog: he went home to your great-
dialog: grandmother, took the watch off his
dialog: wrist and put it in an ol' coffee
dialog: can. And in that can it stayed 'til
dialog: your grandfather Dane Coolidge was
dialog: called upon by his country to go
dialog: overseas and fight the Germans once
dialog: again. This time they called it World
dialog: War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave
dialog: it to your granddad for good luck.
dialog: Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as
dialog: good as his old man's. Your granddad
dialog: was a Marine and he was killed with
text: all the other Marines at the battle
dialog: of Wake Island. Your granddad was
dialog: facing death and he knew it. None of
dialog: those boys had any illusions about
dialog: ever leavin' that island alive. So
dialog: three days before the Japanese took
dialog: the island, your 22-year old
dialog: grandfather asked a gunner on an Air
dialog: Force transport named Winocki, a man
dialog: he had never met before in his life,
dialog: to deliver to his infant son, who he
dialog: had never seen in the flesh, his
dialog: gold watch. Three days later, your
dialog: grandfather was dead. But Winocki
dialog: kept his word. After the war was
dialog: over, he paid a visit to your
dialog: grandmother, delivering to your infant
dialog: father, his Dad's gold watch. This
dialog: watch. This watch was on your Daddy's
text: wrist when he was shot down over
text: Hanoi. He was captured and put in a
dialog: Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew
dialog: if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd
dialog: be confiscated. The way your Daddy
dialog: looked at it, that watch was your
dialog: birthright. And he'd be damned if
dialog: and slopeheads were gonna put their
text: greasy yella hands on his boy's
dialog: birthright. So he hid it in the one
dialog: place he knew he could hide somethin'.
dialog: His ass. Five long years, he wore
dialog: this watch up his ass. Then when he
dialog: died of dysentery, he gave me the
dialog: watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk
dialog: of metal up my ass for two years.
dialog: Then, after seven years, I was sent
dialog: home to my family. And now, little
dialog: man, I give the watch to you.
text: Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes
dialog: into FRAME to accept it.

dialog: Now if anybody should ask you about
dialog: who your fare was tonight, what're
dialog: you gonna tell 'em?
speaker_heading: ESMARELDA
text: The truth. Three well-dressed,
text: slightly toasted, Mexicans.
text: He gives her the bill.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Bon soir, Esmarelda.
speaker_heading: ESMARELDA
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: Sleep well, Butch.
text: He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away.
text: She drives off.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX)  NIGHT
text: Butch enters and turns on the light.
text: Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to
dialog: us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Keep the light off.
text: Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Is that better, sugar pop?
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Oui. Hard day at the office?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Pretty hard. I got into a fight.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Poor baby. Can we make spoons?
text: Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.
text: When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in
dialog: babytalk.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
text: I was looking at myself in the mirror.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Uh-huh?
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: I wish I had a pot.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: You were lookin' in the mirror and
dialog: you wish you had some pot?
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
text: A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are
dialog: sexy.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Well you should be happy, 'cause you
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot!
dialog: I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna
dialog: when she did "Lucky Star," it's not
dialog: the same thing.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: I didn't realize there was a
dialog: difference between a tummy and a pot
dialog: belly.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: The difference is huge.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: You want me to have a pot?
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: No. Pot bellies make a man look either
text: oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a
dialog: woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The
dialog: rest of you is normal. Normal face,
dialog: normal legs, normal hips, normal
text: ass, but with a big, perfectly round
dialog: pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a
dialog: tee-shirt two sizes too small to
dialog: accentuate it.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: You think guys would find that
dialog: attractive?
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: I don't give a damn what men find
dialog: attractive. It's unfortunate what we
dialog: find pleasing to the touch and
dialog: pleasing to the eye is seldom the
dialog: same.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: You'd punch me in my belly?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
text: Right in the belly.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your
dialog: right on your face 'til you couldn't
dialog: breathe.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: You'd do that to me?
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Did you get everything, sugar pop?
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Yes, I did.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Good job.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Did everything go as planned?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: You didn't listen to the radio?
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: I never listen to your fights. Were
dialog: you the winner?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: I won alright.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Are you still retiring?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Sure am.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: What about the man you fought?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Floyd retired too.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Really?! He won't be fighting no
dialog: more?!
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Not no more.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: So it all worked out in the finish?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: We ain't at the finish, baby.
text: Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?
text: Butch nods his head: "yes."
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: If they find us, they'll kill us,
dialog: won't they?
text: Butch nods his head: "yes."
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: But they won't find us, will they?
text: Butch nods his head: "no."
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Do you still want me to go with you?
text: Butch nods his head: "yes."
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: I don't want to be a burden or a
dialog: nuisance -
text: Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her
text: crotch.
text: Fabienne reacts.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Say it!
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Fabienne, I want you to be with me.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Forever?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: ...and ever.
text: Fabienne lies her head back.
text: Butch continues to massage her crotch.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Do you love me?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Oui.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?
text: Butch kisses her on the mouth.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Will you kiss it?
text: She nods her head: "yes."
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: But you first.
text: Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral
text: pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: (in French, with
dialog: English subtitles)
dialog: Butch my love, the adventure begins.
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
speaker_heading: FADE UP:
speaker_heading: MOTEL ROOM
text: Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in
text: the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We
text: see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow
dialog: her up.
text: She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower
text: washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the
text: smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom.
text: Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his
dialog: head out.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: I think I cracked a rib.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Giving me oral pleasure?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
text: No retard, from the fight.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Don't call me retard.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: (in a Mongoloid voice)
dialog: My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Shut up fuck head! I hate that
text: Mongoloid voice.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it
dialog: back! Can I have a towel please,
dialog: Miss Beautiful Tulip.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Oh I like that, I like being called
text: a tulip. Tulip is much better than
dialog: Mongoloid.
text: She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban
text: on her head.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I
dialog: called you a retard, but I took it
dialog: back.
text: She hands him a towel.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Merci beaucoup.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Butch?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: (drying his head)
dialog: Yes, lemon pie.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Where are we going to go?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want.
dialog: We're gonna get a lot of money from
dialog: this. But it ain't gonna be so much,
dialog: we can live like hogs in the fat
dialog: house forever. I was thinking we
dialog: could go somewhere in the South
dialog: Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll
dialog: carry us a long way down there.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: So if we wanted, we could live in
dialog: Bora Bora?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: You betcha. And if after awhile you
dialog: don't dig Bora Bora, then we can
dialog: move over to Tahiti or Mexico.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: But I do not speak Spanish.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: You don't speak Bora Boran either.
dialog: Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta
dialog: el zapataria?
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Where's the shoe store?
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Donde esta el zapataria?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Excellent pronunciation. You'll be
dialog: my little mama ceta in no time.
text: Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes
dialog: her teeth.
text: Butch keeps on from the other room.
speaker_heading: BUTCH (O.S.)
dialog: Que hora es?
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Que hora es?
speaker_heading: BUTCH (O.S.)
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: BUTCH (O.S.)
dialog: Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.
text: Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or
text: two, then she remember something.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Butch.
text: She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only
text: to find him sound asleep in bed.
text: She looks at him for a moment.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Forget it.
text: She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the
text: WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
speaker_heading: FADE UP:
scene_heading: MOTEL ROOM  MORNING
text: SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still
text: asleep in bed.
text: Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the
text: bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still
text: wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.
text: ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking
text: on the entire Vietnamese army in the film "THE LOSERS".
text: Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing
dialog: him.
text: His start startles Fabienne.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Merde! You startled me. Did you have
dialog: a bad dream?
text: Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to
dialog: focus.
text: Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV
text: Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: What are you watching?
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the
dialog: name.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Are you watchin' it?
text: Fabienne enters the room.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: In a way. Why? Would you like for me
dialog: to switch it off?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Would you please?
text: She reaches over and turns off the TV.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: It's a little too early in the morning
dialog: for explosions and war.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: What was it about?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: How should I know, you were the one
dialog: watchin' it.
text: Fabienne laughs.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: No, imbecile, what was your dream
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Oh, I... don't remember. It's really
dialog: rare I remember a dream.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: You just woke up from it.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I
dialog: don't remember.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Well, let's look at the grumpy man
dialog: in the morning. I didn't say you
dialog: were lying, it's just odd you don't
dialog: remember your dreams. I always
dialog: remember mine. Did you know you talk
dialog: in your sleep?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk
dialog: in my sleep?
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: You did last night.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: What did I say?
text: Laying on top of him.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: I don't know. I couldn't understand
dialog: you.
text: She kisses Butch.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Why don't you get up and we'll get
dialog: some breakfast at that breakfast
text: place with the pancakes.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: One more kiss and I'll get up.
text: Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Satisfied?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Then get up, lazy bones.
text: Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of
dialog: the suitcase that Fabienne brought.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
text: Almost nine in the morning. What
dialog: time does our train arrive?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Eleven.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: I'm gonna order a big plate of
dialog: blueberry pancakes with maple syrup,
text: eggs over easy, and five sausages.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: (surprised at her
dialog: potential appetite)
dialog: Anything to drink with that?
text: Butch is finished dressing.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: (referring to his
dialog: clothes)
dialog: Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a
dialog: tall glass or orange juice and a
dialog: black cup of coffee. After that, I'm
text: going to have a slice of pie.
text: As he goes through the suitcase.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Pie for breakfast?
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Any time of the day is a good time
dialog: for pie. Blueberry pie to go with
text: the pancakes. And on top, a thin
dialog: slice of melted cheese 
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog:  where's my watch?
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: It's there.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: No, it's not. It's not here.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Have you looked?
text: By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Yes I've fuckin' looked!!
text: He's now throwing clothes.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: What the fuck do you think I'm doing?!
dialog: Are you sure you got it?
text: Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTCH
text:  on the little kangaroo.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Well it's not here!
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: (on the verge of tears)
dialog: Well it should be!
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Oh it most definitely should be here,
dialog: but it's not. So where is it?
text: Fabienne is crying and scared.
text: Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more
dialog: menacing.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin'
dialog: watch. You know what my father went
dialog: through to git me that watch?... I
dialog: don't wanna get into it right now...
dialog: but he went through a lot. Now all
dialog: this other shit, you coulda set on
dialog: fire, but I specifically reminded
dialog: you not to forget my father's watch.
dialog: Now think, did you get it?
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: I believe so...
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: You believe so? You either did, or
dialog: you didn't, now which one is it?
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Then I did.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: (shaking)
dialog: No.
text: Butch freaks out, he punches the air.
text: Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the
text: motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.
text: Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.
text: Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: (to Fabienne)
dialog: No! It's not your fault.
dialog: (he approached her)
dialog: You left it at the apartment.
text: He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.
text: He touches her hand, she flinches.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: If you did leave it at the apartment,
dialog: it's not your fault. I had you bring
dialog: a bunch of stuff. I reminded you
dialog: about it, but I didn't illustrate
dialog: how personal the watch was to me. If
dialog: all I gave a fuck about was my watch,
dialog: I should've told you. You ain't a
dialog: mind reader.
text: He kisses her hand. Then rises.
text: Fabienne is still sniffling.
text: Butch goes to the closet.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: Butch puts on his high school jacket.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Don't be. It just means I won't be
dialog: able to eat breakfast with you.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Why does it mean that?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Because I'm going back to my apartment
dialog: to get my watch.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Won't the gangsters be looking for
dialog: you there?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: That's what I'm gonna find out. If
dialog: they are, and I don't think I can
dialog: handle it, I'll split.
text: Rising from the floor.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: I was so dreadful. I saw your watch,
dialog: I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.
text: Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing
dialog: you could ever do would make me
dialog: permanently angry at you.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I love you, remember?
dialog: (he digs some money
dialog: out of his wallet)
dialog: Now here's some money, order those
dialog: pancakes and have a great breakfast.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Don't go.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: I'll be back before you can say,
text: blueberry pie.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Blueberry pie.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Well maybe not that fast, but fast.
dialog: Okay? Okay?
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Okay.
text: He kisses her once more and heads for the door.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Bye-bye, sugar pop.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Bye.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: I'm gonna take your Honda.
speaker_heading: FABIENNE
dialog: Okay.
text: And with that, he's out the door.
text: Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.
scene_heading: INT. HONDA (MOVING)  DAY
text: Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his
text: fists as he drives down the street.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Of all the fuckin' things she coulda
dialog: forgot, she forgets my father's watch.
dialog: I specifically reminded her not to
dialog: forget it. "Bedside table  on the
dialog: kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't
dialog: forget my father's watch."
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET  DAY
text: The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is
dialog: little engine will take it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the
text: arrow pointing at one hour.
scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER  DAY
text: Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a
text: couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before
text: he goes boppin' through the front door.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY  DAY
text: Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street,
text: then he discreetly glances out.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET  BUTCH'S APARTMENT  DAY
text: Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of
text: cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of
text: place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.
text: Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of
dialog: Butch's home.
text: Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.
text: Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He
text: crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.
text: Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a
text: combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign
text: sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a
text: graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.
scene_heading: EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD  DAY
text: Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment
text: building. Once again, everything appears normal  the laundry
text: room, the pool, his apartment door  nothing appears
dialog: disturbed.
text: Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12.
text: He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.
text: Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening
dialog: it.
scene_heading: INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT  DAY
text: His apartment hasn't been touched.
text: He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick
text: look around. Obviously, no one is there.
text: Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the
dialog: refrigerator.
text: He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.
text: With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he
text: goes to the bedroom.
text: His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment  neat, clean
text: and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a
text: few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue
text: of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of
dialog: Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.
dialog: Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On
text: the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.
text: He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He
text: opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting
text: down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and
text: puts them in the toaster.
text: Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.
text: What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun
text: with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Holy shit.
text: He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines
dialog: it.
text: Then... a toilet FLUSHES.
text: Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to
text: the kitchen. There is someone behind it.
text: Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not
dialog: knowing what to do.
text: The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the
text: bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book
text: "MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.
text: Vincent and Butch lock eyes.
text: Vincent freezes.
text: Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's
dialog: direction.
text: Neither man opens his mouth.
text: Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.
dialog: That's all the situation needed.
text: Butch's finger HITS the trigger.
text: MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.
text: Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets
text: SIMULTANEOUSLY  LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him
text: through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door
text: at the end of the bathroom.
text: By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent
text: is annihilated.
text: Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look
text: goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once
text: Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.
text: With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61
text: back on the kitchen counter.
text: Then he exits the apartment, quickly.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD  DAY
text: Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the
dialog: courtyard...
text: ...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...
dialog: ...goes through the alley...
text: ...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.
scene_heading: EXT. HONDA  DAY
text: Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide
text: smile of a survivor breaks across his face.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET  DAY
text: The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his
dialog: apartment building.
scene_heading: INT. HONDA  DAY
text: Butch looks out the window at his former home.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: That's how you're gonna beat 'em,
dialog: Butch. They keep underestimatin'
dialog: ya.
text: This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips
text: a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he
text: SINGS along with it.
text: He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on
text: the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.
text: Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we
dialog: see:
text: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
text: The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut,
text: carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam
text: cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street
text: in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see
text: Marsellus clearly.
text: Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front
dialog: of him.
text: When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances
text: to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!
scene_heading: DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"
text: Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question.
text: He STOMPS on the gas pedal.
text: The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts
text: and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.
text: Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold
text: Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending
text: it up on the sidewalk.
text: Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what
text: at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his
text: nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play.
text: A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.
speaker_heading: PEDESTRIAN
dialog: Jesus, are you okay?
text: Butch look at him, spaced-out.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: I guess.
text: Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS
text: gather around the body.
speaker_heading: GAWKER #1
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: He's dead! He's dead!
text: This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.
text: TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.
text: The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.
speaker_heading: GAWKER #2
dialog: If you need a witness in court, I'll
dialog: be glad to help. He was a drunken
dialog: maniac. He hit you and crashed into
dialog: that car.
speaker_heading: MARSELLUS
dialog: (still incoherent)
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: GAWKER #2
dialog: (pointing at Butch)
dialog: Him.
text: Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge
text: down the street, looking a shambles.

dialog: Well, I'll be damned.
text: The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back

dialog: him.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Sacre bleu.
text: Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt,
text: shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.
text: He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground,
text: screaming.
scene_heading: LOOKY-LOO WOMAN
dialog: Oh my God, I've been shot!
dialog: That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.
text: Marsellus RUNS after him.
text: The CROWD looks agape.
text: Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.
text: The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.
text: Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a
text: sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP".
scene_heading: INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP  DAY
text: MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter
text: of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of
text: Butch RACES into his world.
speaker_heading: MAYNARD
dialog: Can I help you wit' somethin'?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Shut up!
text: Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands
text: next to the door.
speaker_heading: MAYNARD
dialog: Now you just wait one goddamn minute
dialog: 
text: Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in.
text: He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist
text: in Marsellus' face.
text: The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man
text: FALLS FLAT on his back.
text: Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.
text: Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in
text: the face.
text: Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold
text: of his middle finger.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: So you like chasing people, huh?
text: He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound. Butch
text: then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS
text: back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to
text: shield the splatter.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Well guess what, big man, you caught
dialog: me 
speaker_heading: MAYNARD (O.S.)
dialog:  hold it right there, godammit!
text: Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a
text: pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Look mister, this ain't any of your
dialog: business 
speaker_heading: MAYNARD
dialog:  I'm makin' it my business! Now
dialog: toss that gun!
dialog: Butch does.
speaker_heading: MAYNARD
dialog: Now you on top, stand up and come to
text: the counter.
text: Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he
text: gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face
text: with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.
text: After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on
text: the counter and moves to the telephone.
text: Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily
text: watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on
text: the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.
speaker_heading: MAYNARD
dialog: Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just
text: caught a coupl'a flies.
text: Marsellus passes out.
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
speaker_heading: FADE UP:
scene_heading: INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM  DAY
scene_heading: TWO SHOT  BUTCH AND MARSELLUS
text: They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are
text: two S&amp;M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and
text: a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are
text: unconscious.
text: Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both
text: guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two
text: prisoners look up at their captors.
text: Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one
text: hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in
text: his belt.
speaker_heading: MAYNARD
dialog: Nobody kills anybody in my place of
dialog: business except me or Zed.
text: A BUZZER buzzes.
speaker_heading: MAYNARD
dialog: That's Zed.
text: Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs
text: that lead to red curtains and goes through them.
text: WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed
text: inside the store.
text: Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of
text: the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking
text: in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other,
text: all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both
dialog: share at what they've gotten themselves into.
text: Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even
text: more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible.
text: The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is
text: a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and
text: stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a
dialog: long time, then says:
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: (to Maynard)
dialog: You said you waited for me?
speaker_heading: MAYNARD
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Then how come they're all beat up?
speaker_heading: MAYNARD
dialog: They did that to each other. They
dialog: was fightin' when they came in. This
dialog: one was gonna shoot that one.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: (to Butch)
dialog: You were gonna shoot him?
text: Butch makes no reply.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front
dialog: of this place?
speaker_heading: MAYNARD
dialog: Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: No, it's Thursday.
speaker_heading: MAYNARD
dialog: Then she'll be fine.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Bring out The Gimp.
speaker_heading: MAYNARD
dialog: I think The Gimp's sleepin'.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em
dialog: up then, won't you?
text: Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.
speaker_heading: MAYNARD
dialog: (yelling in the hole)
dialog: Wake up!
text: Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a
dialog: leash.
text: He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises
speaker_heading: THE GIMP.
text: The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black
text: leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs
text: here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather
text: mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth.
text: They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large
dialog: dog.
text: Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners,
text: then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed,
text: then backs away.
speaker_heading: MAYNARD
dialog: (to The Gimp)
dialog: Down!
text: The Gimp gets on its knees.
text: Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.
speaker_heading: MAYNARD
dialog: Who's first?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I ain't fer sure yet.
text: Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany,
text: miney, moe... " just his mouth mouthing the words and his
text: finger going back and forth between the two.
text: Butch are Marsellus are terrified.
text: Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.
text: The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.
text: Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving
text: left to right, then it stops.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT  BUTCH AND MARSELLUS
text: After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on
dialog: Marsellus.
text: Zed stands up.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Wanna do it here?
speaker_heading: MAYNARD
dialog: Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old
dialog: room.
text: Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old
dialog: room.
dialog: Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the
text: misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop.
dialog: Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and
text: Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the
text: back room, is empty.
text: As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before
text: he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.
speaker_heading: MAYNARD
dialog: (to The Gimp)
dialog: Up!
text: The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on
dialog: the ceiling.
speaker_heading: MAYNARD
dialog: Keep an eye on this one.
text: The Gimp bows its head: "yes." Maynard disappears into
text: Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because
text: suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.
text: Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath
text: the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history
dialog: of comedy.
text: From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:
speaker_heading: MAYNARD (O.S.)
dialog: Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight
dialog: in 'em!
text: We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.
speaker_heading: ZED (O.S.)
dialog: You wanna fight? You wanna fight?
dialog: Good, I like to fight!
text: Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic,
text: hurriedly struggles to get free.
text: The Gimp is laughing wildly.
text: The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.
text: The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:
speaker_heading: MAYNARD (O.S.)
dialog: That's it... that's it boy, you're
dialog: goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like
dialog: that... that's good.
dialog: (grunting faster)
dialog: Stay still... stay still goddamn ya!
dialog: Zed goddammit, git over here and
dialog: hold 'em!
text: Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite
text: easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it
dialog: were never connected by a bolt.
text: The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.
speaker_heading: THE GIMP
dialog: Huhng?
text: The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook.
text: He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles
text: and grunts.
text: Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S
text: PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making
text: him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash
text: attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then
text: silently makes his way through the red curtains.
scene_heading: INT. PAWNSHOP  DAY
text: Butch sneaks to the door.
text: On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected
text: to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he
text: stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their
dialog: way with Marsellus.
dialog: Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in
text: a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the
text: pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in
dialog: with.
text: He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards
text: it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks
text: about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large
text: Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots
dialog: what he's been looking for:
text: A Samurai sword.
text: It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the
text: wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign.
text: Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its
text: sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten
text: in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his
text: thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not
dialog: on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems
text: made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the
text: sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears
text: through the red curtains to take care of business.
scene_heading: INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM  DAY
text: Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.
text: Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind
text: the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.
scene_heading: INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM  DAY
text: Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It
text: swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched
dialog: positions.
text: Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden
dialog: horse.
text: Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.
text: Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up
text: behind him with the sword.
text: Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus,
text: red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see
text: Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Hey hillbilly.
text: Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.
text: Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across
text: the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on
dialog: Zed.
text: Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.
text: Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword
text: behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing
text: the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.
text: Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go
text: from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic,
text: which lies within reach.
text: Butch's eyes follow Zed's.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.
text: Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.
text: Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.
text: Zed studies Butch.
text: Butch looks hard at Zed.
dialog: Then a VOICE says:
speaker_heading: MARSELLUS (O.S.)
dialog: Step aside, Butch.
text: Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him,
text: holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.
dialog: KABOOM!!!!
text: Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.
text: Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the
dialog: used shotgun shell.
text: Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: MARSELLUS
dialog: Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from
dialog: okay!
dialog: Long pause.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: What now?
speaker_heading: MARSELLUS
dialog: What now? Well let me tell you what
dialog: now. I'm gonna call a couple pipe-
dialog: hittin' niggers, who'll go to work
text: on homes here with a pair of pliers
text: and a blow torch.
dialog: (to Zed)
dialog: Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I
dialog: ain't through with you by a damn
dialog: sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on
dialog: your ass.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: I meant what now, between me and
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MARSELLUS
dialog: Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell
dialog: ya what now between me an' you. There
dialog: is no me an' you. Not no more.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: So we're cool?
speaker_heading: MARSELLUS
dialog: Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I
dialog: ask  two things I ask: Don't tell
dialog: nobody about this. This shit's between
dialog: me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-
dialog: the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-

dialog: leave town. Tonight. Right now. And
dialog: when you're gone, stay gone. You've
dialog: lost your Los Angeles privileges.
dialog: Deal?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Deal.
text: The two men shake hands, then hug one another.
speaker_heading: MARSELLUS
dialog: Go on now, get your ass outta here.
text: Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.
text: Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.
speaker_heading: MARSELLUS
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta

scene_heading: EXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP  DAY
text: Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He

text: Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has
text: the name "GRACE" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys
text: with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES

scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL ROOM  DAY

speaker_heading: FABIENNE (O.S.)

speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Honey, grab your radio and your purse

speaker_heading: FABIENNE (O.S.)
dialog: But what about all our bags?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train

speaker_heading: FABIENNE (O.S.)

speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: We're cool. In fact, we're super-

speaker_heading: FABIENNE

speaker_heading: BUTCH

speaker_heading: BUTCH

speaker_heading: FABIENNE

speaker_heading: BUTCH

dialog: to stick their head through that door.
text: Then he listens to them talk.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (O.S.)
dialog: Friend of yours?
speaker_heading: JULES (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.

speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Yeah, maybe.
speaker_heading: JULES

speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Yeah, I think so. That means God

speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Yeah, man, that's what is means.
dialog: That's exactly what it means! God

speaker_heading: JULES

speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: If he kicks us out, whadda we do?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made

speaker_heading: VINCENT

speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Put yourself in his position. It's
text: eight o'clock in the morning. He
dialog: just woke up, he wasn't prepared for

speaker_heading: VINCENT

speaker_heading: JULES

speaker_heading: JULES

speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You watched me wash 'em.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I watched you get 'em wet.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to

dialog: I coulda done a better job.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I used the same soap you did and
dialog: when I dried my hands, the towel
dialog: didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie

speaker_heading: JIMMIE
dialog: She won't at that.
speaker_heading: THE WOLF
dialog: That gives us forty minutes to get

speaker_heading: JIMMIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: THE WOLF
dialog: Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I

speaker_heading: JIMMIE
dialog: Sure, how do you take it?
speaker_heading: THE WOLF
dialog: Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.
text: Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.
speaker_heading: THE WOLF

speaker_heading: JULES
text: Aside from how it looks, the car's

speaker_heading: THE WOLF
dialog: Thank you, Jimmie.

speaker_heading: THE WOLF
dialog: Okay first thing, you two.
dialog: (meaning Jules and
dialog: Vincent)
dialog: Take the body, stick it in the trunk.
dialog: Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty
dialog: domesticated house. That would lead
dialog: me to believe that in the garage or
dialog: under the sink, you got a bunch of
dialog: cleansers and cleaners and shit like
dialog: that, am I correct?
speaker_heading: JIMMIE
dialog: Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.
speaker_heading: THE WOLF
dialog: Good. What I need you two fellas to
dialog: do is take those cleaning products
dialog: and clean the inside of the car. And
dialog: I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You
dialog: need to go in the backseat, scoop up
dialog: all those little pieces of brain and
dialog: skull. Get it out of there. Wipe
dialog: down the upholstery  now when it
dialog: comes to upholstery, it don't need
dialog: to be spic and span, you don't need
dialog: to eat off it. Give it a good once
dialog: over. What you need to take care of
dialog: are the really messy parts. The pools
dialog: of blood that have collected, you
dialog: gotta soak that shit up. But the
text: windows are a different story. Them
dialog: you really clean. Get the Windex, do
dialog: a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to
dialog: raid your linen closet. I need
dialog: blankets, I need comforters, I need
dialog: quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker
dialog: the better, the darker the better.
dialog: No whites, can't use 'em. We need to
text: camouflage the interior of the car.
dialog: We're gonna line the front seat and
text: the backseat and the floor boards
dialog: with quilts and blankets. If a cop
dialog: stops us and starts stickin' his big
text: snout in the car, the subterfuge
text: won't last. But at a glance, the car
dialog: will appear to be normal. Jimmie 
text: lead the way, boys  get to work.

speaker_heading: THE WOLF

text: The Wolf takes a step toward him.
speaker_heading: THE WOLF
dialog: Set is straight, Buster. I'm not
dialog: here to say "please."I'm here to
dialog: tell you want to do. And if self-
dialog: preservation is an instinct you
dialog: possess, you better fuckin' do it
dialog: and do it quick. I'm here to help.
dialog: If my help's not appreciated, lotsa
dialog: luck gentlemen.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your
dialog: help is definitely appreciated.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I don't mean any disrespect. I just
dialog: don't like people barkin' orders at
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: THE WOLF
dialog: If I'm curt with you, it's because
dialog: time is a factor. I think fast, I
dialog: talk fast, and I need you guys to
dialog: act fast if you want to get out of
dialog: this. So pretty please, with sugar

dialog: in my Porsche. Now if we cross the
dialog: path of any John Q. Laws, nobody
dialog: does a fuckin' thing 'til I do
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: (TO JULES)
dialog: What did I say?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Don't do shit unless 
speaker_heading: THE WOLF
dialog:  unless what?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Unless you do it first.
speaker_heading: THE WOLF
dialog: Spoken like a true prodigy.
dialog: (to Vincent)
dialog: How 'bout you, Lash Larue? Can you
dialog: keep your spurs from jingling and
dialog: jangling?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went
dialog: off, I dunno how.
speaker_heading: THE WOLF
dialog: Fair enough.
dialog: (he throws Vince his
dialog: car keys)
dialog: I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep
dialog: up. If I get my car back any different
dialog: than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna
text: be disposing of two bodies.
scene_heading: EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW  MORNING
text: Jules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: We cool?
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Like it never happened.
text: Jules and Vincent bump fists.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all
dialog: this will be hers.
speaker_heading: RAQUEL
dialog: (to the boys)
dialog: Hi. You know, if they ever do "I
dialog: SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys,
dialog: I'd be great. What's with the
dialog: outfits. You guys going to a
dialog: volleyball game?
text: Winston laughs, the boys groan.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast.
dialog: Maybe I can drop you two off. Where
dialog: do you live?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Redondo Beach.
speaker_heading: JULES
text: Inglewood.
text: Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a
text: "DEAD ZONE" trance.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: (painfully)
dialog: It's your future: I see... a cab
dialog: ride.
dialog: (dropping the act)
dialog: Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.
dialog: (to Raquel)
dialog: Say goodbye, Raquel.
speaker_heading: RAQUEL
dialog: Goodbye, Raquel.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: I'll see you two around, and stay
dialog: outta trouble, you crazy kids.
text: Winston turns to leave.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Mr. Wolf.
text: He turns around.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I was a pleasure watchin' you work.
text: The Wolf smiles.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Call me Winston.
text: He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: You hear that, young lady? Respect.
dialog: You could lean a lot from those two
dialog: fine specimens. Respect for one's
dialog: elders shows character.
speaker_heading: RAQUEL
dialog: I have character.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Just because you are a character
dialog: doesn't mean you have character.
speaker_heading: RAQUEL
dialog: Oh you're so funny, oh you're so
dialog: funny.
text: The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.
text: The two men left alone look at each other.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Wanna share a cab?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You know I could go for some
dialog: breakfast. Want to have breakfast
dialog: with me?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Sure.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP  MORNING
text: Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a
text: big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto.
text: Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a
text: muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a
dialog: refill for both men,
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Thanks a bunch.
dialog: (to Jules, who's
dialog: nursing his coffee)
dialog: Want a sausage?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Naw, I don't eat pork.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Are you Jewish?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig
dialog: on swine.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: They're filthy animals. I don't eat
text: filthy animals.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin
dialog: pie. I'll never know 'cause even if
dialog: it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy
text: motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in
dialog: shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't
dialog: wanna eat nothin' that ain't got
dialog: enough sense to disregard its own
text: feces.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: How about dogs? Dogs eat their own
text: feces.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I don't eat dog either.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Yes, but do you consider a dog to be
dialog: a filthy animal?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I wouldn't go so far as to call a
dialog: dog filthy, but they're definitely
dialog: dirty. But a dog's got personality.
dialog: And personality goes a long way.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: So by that rationale, if a pig had a
dialog: better personality, he's cease to be
dialog: a filthy animal?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one
dialog: motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd
dialog: have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.
text: The two men laugh.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Good for you. Lighten up a little.
dialog: You been sittin' there all quiet.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I just been sittin' here thinkin'.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (mouthful of food)
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: The miracle we witnessed.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed
text: a freak occurrence.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Do you know that a miracle is?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: An act of God.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: What's an act of God?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I guess it's when God makes the
dialog: impossible possible. And I'm sorry
dialog: Jules, but I don't think what happened
dialog: this morning qualifies.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't
dialog: matter. You're judging this thing
dialog: the wrong way. It's not about what.
dialog: It could be God stopped the bullets,
dialog: he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found
dialog: my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge
dialog: shit like this based on merit. Whether
dialog: or not what we experienced was an
dialog: according-to-Hoyle miracle is
dialog: insignificant. What is significant
dialog: is I felt God's touch, God got
dialog: involved.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: But why?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I
dialog: don't know why. But I can't go back
dialog: to sleep.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: So you're serious, you're really
dialog: gonna quit?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: The life, most definitely.
text: Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In
text: the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.
speaker_heading: PATRON
dialog: Garcon! Coffee!
text: We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene
text: of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: So if you're quitting the life,
dialog: what'll you do?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: That's what I've been sitting here
dialog: contemplating. First, I'm gonna
dialog: deliver this case to Marsellus. Then,
dialog: basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What do you mean, walk the earth?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU."
dialog: Just walk from town to town, meet
dialog: people, get in adventures.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: How long do you intend to walk the
dialog: earth?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Until God puts me where he want me
dialog: to be.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What if he never does?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: If it takes forever, I'll wait
dialog: forever.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: So you decided to be a bum?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I'll just be Jules, Vincent  no
dialog: more, no less.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: No Jules, you're gonna be like those
dialog: pieces of shit out there who beg for
text: change. They walk around like a bunch
dialog: of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in
dialog: garbage bins, they eat what I throw
dialog: away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got
dialog: a word for 'em, they're called bums.
dialog: And without a job, residence, or
dialog: legal tender, that's what you're
dialog: gonna be  a fuckin' bum!
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Look my friend, this is just where
dialog: me and you differ 
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog:  what happened was peculiar  no
dialog: doubt about it  but it wasn't water
dialog: into wine.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: All shapes and sizes, Vince.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: If you find my answers frightening,
dialog: Vincent, you should cease askin'
dialog: scary questions.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I gotta take a shit. To be continued.
text: Vincent exits for the restroom.
text: Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin
text: and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!
speaker_heading: HONEY BUNNY
dialog: Any of you fuckin' pricks move and
dialog: I'll execute every one of you
dialog: motherfuckers! Got that?!
text: Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the
text: table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it
text: out, COCKING IT.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
text: Customers stay seated, waitresses on
dialog: the floor.
speaker_heading: HONEY BUNNY
dialog: Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die,
dialog: do it or fucking die!
text: Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While
text: Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them
dialog: terrified.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out
dialog: here! Asta luego!
text: Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: On the floor or I'll cook you ass,
dialog: comprende?
text: They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: I'm the manager here, there's no
dialog: problem, no problem at all 
text: Pumpkin heads his way.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: You're gonna give me a problem?
text: He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the
text: Manager's neck.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: What? You said you're gonna give me
dialog: a problem?
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you
dialog: any problem!
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks
dialog: like the hero type to me!
speaker_heading: HONEY BUNNY
dialog: Don't take any chances. Execute him!
text: The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his
text: hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm
dialog: just a coffee shop manager. Take
dialog: anything you want.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll
dialog: be all over.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Everybody just be calm and cooperate
dialog: with them and this will be all over
dialog: soon!
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: Well done, now git your fuckin' ass
text: on the ground.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM  MORNING
text: Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside,
text: reads his "MODESTY BLAISE" book.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP  MORNING
text: Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from
text: the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter
text: with a trash bag in his hand.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: Okay people, I'm going to go 'round
dialog: and collect your wallets. Don't talk,
dialog: just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?
text: Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his
text: .45 ready to spit under the table.
text: Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet,
text: briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more
text: respectful, him manner more on guard.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
text: In the bag.
text: Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer,
text: Pumpkin points to the briefcase.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: What's in that?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: My boss' dirty laundry.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: You boss makes you do his laundry?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: When he wants it clean.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: Sounds like a shit job.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Funny, I've been thinkin' the same
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: Open it up.
text: Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: 'Fraid I can't do that.
text: Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the
text: gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the
dialog: hammer.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: I didn't hear you.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Yes, you did.
dialog: This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard
text: it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.
speaker_heading: HONEY BUNNY
dialog: What's goin' on?
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: Looks like we got a vigilante in our
dialog: midst.
speaker_heading: HONEY BUNNY
dialog: Shoot 'em in the face!
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I don't mean to shatter your ego,
dialog: but this ain't the first time I've
text: had gun pointed at me.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: You don't open up that case, it's
dialog: gonna be the last.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: (on the ground)
dialog: Quit causing problems, you'll get us
dialog: all killed! Give 'em what you got
dialog: and get 'em out of here.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat
dialog: man, this ain't any of your goddamn
dialog: business!
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: I'm countin' to three, and if your
dialog: hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna
dialog: unload right in your fuckin' face.
dialog: Clear? One...
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: ...two... three.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: You win.
text: Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: It's all yours, Ringo.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: Open it.
text: Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to
text: Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case.
text: Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across
dialog: the room, can't see shit.
speaker_heading: HONEY BUNNY
dialog: What is it? What is it?
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Is that what I think it is?
text: Jules nods his head: "yes."
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: It's beautiful.
text: Jules nods his head: "yes."
speaker_heading: HONEY BUNNY
dialog: Goddammit, what is it?
text: Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering
text: the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to
text: pick up the case.
text: Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of
text: Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand
text: comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45
text: hand under Pumpkin's chin.
text: Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.
speaker_heading: HONEY BUNNY
dialog: Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow
dialog: your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya!
dialog: I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're
dialog: gonna fuckin' die bad!
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: (to Pumpkin)
dialog: Tell that bitch to be cool! Say,
dialog: bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: Chill out, honey!
speaker_heading: HONEY BUNNY
dialog: Let him go!
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Tell her it's gonna be okay.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: I'm gonna be okay.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Promise her.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: I promise.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Tell her to chill.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: Just chill out.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: What's her name?
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: Yolanda.
text: Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only
dialog: at Pumpkin.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: (to Yolanda)
dialog: So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna
dialog: do anything stupid, are we?
speaker_heading: YOLANDA
dialog: (crying)
dialog: Don't you hurt him.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're
dialog: gonna be like three Fonzies. And
dialog: what' Fonzie like?
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?
speaker_heading: YOLANDA
dialog: (through tears, unsure)
dialog: He's cool?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Correct-amundo! And that's what we're
dialog: gonna be, we're gonna be cool.
dialog: (to Pumpkin)
dialog: Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three
dialog: and I want you to let go your gun
dialog: and lay your palms flat on the table.
dialog: But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?
text: Pumpkin looks at him.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: One... two... three.
text: Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.
dialog: Yolanda can't stand it anymore.
speaker_heading: YOLANDA
dialog: Okay, now let him go!
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be
dialog: cool. When you yell at me, it makes
dialog: me nervous. When I get nervous, I
dialog: get scared. And when motherfuckers
dialog: get scared, that's when motherfuckers
dialog: get accidentally shot.
speaker_heading: YOLANDA
dialog: (more conversational)
dialog: Just know: you hurt him, you die.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: That seems to be the situation. Now
dialog: I don't want that and you don't want
dialog: that and Ringo here don't want that.
dialog: So let's see what we can do.
dialog: (to Ringo)
dialog: Now this is the situation. Normally
dialog: both of your asses would be dead as
dialog: fuckin' fried chicken. But you
dialog: happened to pull this shit while I'm
dialog: in a transitional period. I don't
dialog: wanna kill ya, I want to help ya.
dialog: But I'm afraid I can't give you the
dialog: case. It don't belong to me. Besides,
dialog: I went through too much shit this
dialog: morning on account of this case to
dialog: just hand it over to your ass.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (O.S.)
dialog: What the fuck's goin' on here?
text: Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.
text: Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at
dialog: Yolanda.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't
dialog: do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's
dialog: cool baby, nothin's changed. We're
dialog: still just talkin'.
dialog: (to Pumpkin)
dialog: Tell her we're still cool.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still
dialog: cool.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (gun raised)
dialog: What the hell's goin' on, Jules?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Nothin' I can't handle. I want you
dialog: to just hang back and don't do shit
dialog: unless it's absolutely necessary.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Check.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Yolanda, how we doin, baby?
speaker_heading: YOLANDA
dialog: I gotta go pee! I want to go home.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Just hang in there, baby, you're
dialog: doing' great, Ringo's proud of you
text: and so am I. It's almost over.
dialog: (to Pumpkin)
dialog: Now I want you to go in that bag and
dialog: find my wallet.
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: Which one is it?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: It's the one that says Bad
dialog: Motherfucker on it.
text: Pumpkin looks in the bag and  sure enough  there's a wallet
text: with "Bad Motherfucker" embroidered on it.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: That's my bad motherfucker. Now open
dialog: it up and take out the cash. How
dialog: much is there?
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
text: About fifteen hundred dollars.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Put it in your pocket, it's yours.
dialog: Now with the rest of them wallets
dialog: and the register, that makes this a
dialog: pretty successful little score.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen
dialog: hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on
dialog: general principle.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing,
dialog: now hang back and shut the fuck up.
dialog: Besides, I ain't givin' it to him.
dialog: I'm buyin' somethin' for my money.
dialog: Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Your life. I'm givin' you that money
dialog: so I don't hafta kill your ass. You
dialog: read the Bible?
speaker_heading: PUMPKIN
dialog: Not regularly.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: There's a passage I got memorized.
dialog: Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the
text: righteous man is beset on all sides
dialog: by the inequities of the selfish and
dialog: the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is
dialog: he who, in the name of charity and
dialog: good will, shepherds the weak through
dialog: the valley of the darkness. For he
dialog: is truly his brother's keeper and
dialog: the finder of lost children. And I
dialog: will strike down upon thee with great
dialog: vengeance and furious anger those
dialog: who attempt to poison and destroy my
dialog: brothers. And you will know I am the
dialog: Lord when I lay my vengeance upon
dialog: you." I been sayin' that shit for
dialog: years. And if you ever heard it, it
dialog: meant your ass. I never really
dialog: questioned what it meant. I thought
dialog: it was just a coldblooded thing to
dialog: say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped
dialog: a cap in his ass. But I saw some
dialog: shit this mornin' made me think twice.
dialog: Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're
dialog: the evil man. And I'm the righteous
dialog: man. And Mr. .45 here, he's the
dialog: shepherd protecting my righteous ass
text: in the valley of darkness. Or is
dialog: could by you're the righteous man
dialog: and I'm the shepherd and it's the
dialog: world that's evil and selfish. I'd
dialog: like that. But that shit ain't the
dialog: truth. The truth is you're the weak.
dialog: And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But
dialog: I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to
dialog: be a shepherd.
text: Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.
text: Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to
dialog: Yolanda.
text: She looks back.
text: Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the
dialog: door.
text: Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time,
text: takes a sip of coffee.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: It's cold.
text: He pushes it aside.
text: Vincent appears next to Jules.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I think we oughta leave now.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: That's probably a good idea.
text: Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the
dialog: briefcase.
text: Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the
dialog: Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes
text:  wearing UC Santa Cruz and "I'm with Stupid" tee-shirts,
text: swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics  walk out of
text: the coffee shop together without saying a word.
