text: Darkness. Distant sounds of freeway traffic. Then the closer
text: sound of a car - its headlights illumine an oleander bush and
text: the limbs of an Eucalyptus tree. Then the headlights turn - a

text: The man who got out of the car tries the woman's door, but it
text: is locked. He smiles as he reaches in through the front door
text: and unlocks her door. He opens her door. As he reaches for
text: her, the woman's face becomes flooded with light. Her eyes
text: dart to the front windshield. The driver, flooded with light,
text: turns just as the late model sedan slams into the Cadillac
text: limousine. There is an explosion of metal and glass amidst
text: thunderous tearing sounds as the two cars become one in
text: death. The convertible screams past with hardly a notice.
text: The driver of the limousine dies instantly as his body is
text: jettisoned through the windshield. The other man is torn as
text: the cars screech over him. The woman is brutally thrown into
text: the back of the front seats as a cloud of dust and flying
text: rocks engulfs her. The disastrous moving sculpture of the two
text: cars wants to climb up the hill, then stops and slides back
text: toward the road The Cadillac tips onto its side. Then all is
text: silent. A fire erupts in the sedan and as the dust clears we
text: see the woman appear, then crawl out of the Cadillac to the
text: road. Her face is vacant. There is a bleeding cut just above

text: out with her purse in self defense. The coyote backs away -
text: snarling. The woman then loses control and runs at the coyote
text: and it races off. She falls to the ground. We can hear the

dialog: a great actress than a movie star, but
dialog: sometimes people end up being both and
dialog: that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I

text: denim shirt open, T-shirt underneath, black denim jeans and
text: motorcycle boots. His black belt has silver studs. He's
text: smoking a cigarette and is laughing at something the man at
text: the desk has said. His laugh is easy and his grin is
dialog: infectious.
dialog: 
text: The man at the desk, Ed, wears a clean, crisp black suit,
text: like a business man's but unlike a business man his blonde
text: hair is long enough to go over his shoulders.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: So man, that's unheard of ... an accident

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Unreal ... so, you're looking good.
dialog: Whatcha doin' these days?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Making ends meet, huh.

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Hardly.

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope
dialog: you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It was just a thing. The story made you
dialog: laugh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah, that's a funny story.
dialog: 
text: Looking like he's rubbing the small of his back Joe moves
text: over to Ed at his desk. Joe looks down to the surface of the
text: desk - to a small worn black book.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: So, there it is ... Ed's famous black book.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah, the history of the world in phone
dialog: numbers.
dialog: 
text: Joe's hand still at the small of his back moves into view
text: holding a silenced pistol and in one swift move reaches out
text: and fires a hole through Ed's temple - blowing Ed's brains
text: out across the desk, carpet and wall. Ed's head bangs down
text: on the desk, then is still save the leaking of blood from the
text: wounds. Joe flips his finished cigarette out the open window
text: behind Ed's desk, wipes the gun clean with a handkerchief and
text: places the cleaned gun in Ed's right hand. He places Ed's
text: right forefinger gently onto the trigger. As he puts the
text: finger on the trigger he presses a little too hard and the
text: gun goes off. The bullet shoots out and penetrates the cheap
text: wall at the far end of Ed's office. Joe hears a muffled
dialog: scream.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: (disgusted with himself)
dialog: Oh...man!
dialog: 
text: With a sense of "just more stuff I got to do" Joe moves
text: slowly and begrudgingly out of Ed's office, checks the
text: corridor and goes toward the screaming which still persists.
text: He opens up the office door next to Ed's and finds a heavy
text: set woman screaming bloody murder as she is grabbing her
text: buttock and lower back. He sighs and walks over to her and
text: cups his hand tightly around her mouth to squelch the
text: screaming. Wide-eyed, she tries to fight him off and he
text: begins dragging her out of her office. Joe's foot catches on
text: a computer cable clumsily taped across the floor and he falls
text: backwards bringing the heavy woman down with a bone-crushing
text: blow on top of him. The woman begins beating his face with
text: her meaty fists. Joe snaps her head back, instantly stilling
text: her violent activity. He wrestles the stunned heavyweight
text: back to her feet and out her door. He pushes and pulls her
text: into Ed's office. Just before they enter, Joe notices a man
text: with a vacuum cleaner watching him from the far end of the
text: corridor. He stops and calls to the man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: Hey man. She's hurt bad. Get down here
dialog: and use the phone. Help me out. You
dialog: gotta call the hospital.
dialog: 
text: The man hesitates...not sure if this jives with what he's
dialog: seeing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: I mean it! Get down here quick! She's
dialog: hurt and I can't do everything myself,
dialog: man.
dialog: 
text: Joe pushes the woman inside Ed's office, throws a glance back
text: down the corridor and sees the man is on his way to him,
text: pushing his industrial vacuum and trailing a 200 ft. long
text: thick black cord as he goes. Joe goes in to Ed's office
text: with the woman. He throws her down on the floor in line
text: between Ed's desk and the bullet hole in the wall. She
text: starts screaming immediately and struggles to get up. Joe
text: grabs the pistol from Ed's dead hand and lifts it to fire,
text: but the woman has turned around and is almost standing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: No, no, no. You gotta be turned around.
dialog: 
text: He goes to her, slaps her hard in the face and spins her
text: around. Before she can turn again Joe races back to place
text: himself in the proper line at Ed's desk and quickly fires two
text: silenced shots into the back of her head. The man with the
text: vacuum enters. His eyes begin to widen in reaction to the
text: scene. Just then Joe fires a bullet into the man's chest.
text: The man inadvertently flicks on the vacuum cleaner as his
text: hands rush up to the wound. As the vacuum cleaner whines Joe
text: rushes to the man before the man falls back out into the
text: corridor. He pulls him into the room - the man moaning and
text: clutching his chest, starting to collapse. Joe releases him
text: and the man goes down. The vacuum cleaner seems to be
text: screeching now in the threshold. Joe fires the last bullet
text: into the heavy duty vacuum cleaner. The bullet shorts out
text: the internal wiring of the vacuum. That in turn blows the
text: building's circuit breaker and all the lights go out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: (disgusted with himself)
dialog: Oh ... man!
dialog: 
text: Now he hears voices - voices moving into the corridor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: What the hell .... what happened? What's
dialog: this cord doing here? It's the vacuum.
dialog: It's the vacuum what did it.
dialog: 
text: Joe cleans the pistol once again and places it back in
text: Eddie's hand - Eddie's finger on the trigger. Joe picks up
text: the black book - turns and makes his escape by going out the
text: office window and quickly descending the rusty fire escape.

dialog: longer your film," they meant it, but
dialog: they didn't mean you were not going to
dialog: direct it. I want you to go back to work
dialog: tomorrow. You were re-casting the lead
dialog: actress anyway ... audition many girls for
dialog: the part. When you see the girl that was
dialog: shown to you earlier today, you will say
dialog: " This is the girl." The rest of the
dialog: cast can stay- that is up to you, but
dialog: that lead girl is not up to you. Now,
dialog: you will see me one more time if you do
dialog: good. You will see me two more times if
dialog: you do bad. Good night.

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I was playin' off 'em. They say,
dialog: "They'll arrest you"... and stuff like

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You're still here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I came back. I thought that's what you

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Nobody wants you here.
dialog:

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: But you won't.
dialog: 
text: He grabs Betty by the wrist again and pulls her in to him.
text: He puts his hand on her waist and it accidently slips and
text: keeps going down her hips. He jerks his hand back. Betty
text: looks down and sees Jimmy's hand hovering above her thigh.
text: Betty takes her hand and gently presses down on Jimmy's hand.
text: She slowly looks up with the most seductive smile. Jimmy
text: lets his hand rest more firmly on her thigh, and squeezes her
text: thigh as he sees her smile. With his other hand Jimmy gently
text: pulls her closer. Something has started coming over Betty
text: and she catches the drift of this scene in a different way.
text: She's surprising herself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (almost a hot whisper)
dialog: You're playing a dangerous game here. if
dialog: you're trying to blackmail me... it's not
dialog: going to work.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy now surprises himself. He becomes almost tender and
text: genuinely worked up from the heat coming off Betty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You know what I want...it's not that
dialog: difficult.
dialog: 
text: Where the scene should turn to anger from Betty it can't now
text: and Betty plays it as she feels it. She stays in very close
text: to Jimmy - looking him right in the eyes.

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What about you? What will your dad think
dialog: about you?
dialog: 
text: Betty still playing it in a dreamy whisper... lost in heat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Stop... just stop! That's what you said
dialog: from the beginning. If I tell what
dialog: happened... they'll arrest you and put
dialog: you in jail, so get out of here before...

speaker_heading: JIMMY
text: (caught by her transfixing,

text: breathless ... he finds himself
dialog: taking an extra long pause)
dialog: Before what?
dialog: 
text: As scripted Betty pretends to pull the knife from behind her
text: back, but wraps the knife around behind Jimmy and pulls him
text: into a kiss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: (as she kisses him - whispers)
dialog: Before I kill you.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy panics and pushes Betty away with his hands on her
text: shoulders as if forcing himself to come out of a trance. He
text: finally is able to say his line.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Then they'd put you in jail.
dialog: 
dialog: As scripted Betty is supposed to cry now and it is very easy
dialog: for her to do this because she's ashamed at how the sex of
text: the scene took her over. Tears begin running down her
text: cheeks. She backs away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I hate you... I hate us both!
dialog: 
text: She pretends to drop the knife. The scene ends.
dialog: 
text: Everyone in the room has become mesmerized by Betty, but they

speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Well, thank you Betty, and I mean that.
dialog: That was very impressive. You've done

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Well, thank you.

speaker_heading: SARAH JAMES
dialog: Thank you, Wally. I'm sure you all have a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH JAMES (cont'd)
dialog: Oh, not you Betty. You were stellar and

scene_heading: INT. - RECORDING STUDIO - DAY
text: We see what looks like a recording studio right out of the
text: 1960's. We're looking through a plate of glass. A blonde
text: girl is standing at a vintage microphone. Behind her are
text: three back-up male vocalists dressed in three tone, shiny
text: 60's suits. We hear strings soar up and the blonde girl
text: begins to sing SIXTEEN REASONS by Connie Stevens. The male
text: vocalists backing her up flawlessly.
text: We move back and realize we are on a movie set inside a sound
text: stage. A screen test is being shot of the girl and as we
text: continue moving back we see the director Adam Kesher
text: surrounded by his crew. Behind them there are many people
text: standing, eating, watching, working. The stage is full and
text: bustling. The song plays loudly over. Sarah and Nicki bring
text: Betty into this scene through a giant stage door. A guard
text: mimes for them to be quiet as they approach the set. The
text: song continues to play over.
text: As Sarah leads Betty up close Adam turns and his eyes fall on
text: the beautiful face of Betty Elms. Sensing something Betty
text: turns and sees Adam. They each seem to feel the thrill of
text: the thunderbolt, but each embarrassed to stare longer than
text: they already have turn back and watch the girl finish the
dialog: song.
speaker_heading: ADAM

dialog: script! Where do I sign?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Look... I love you, but there's no way

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I know you will ... cause my manager's

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: It'll be my pleasure. Now, get out of

speaker_heading: ADAM

dialog: See ya later.
dialog: 
text: Adam turns and goes back out of the set onto the stage floor.

speaker_heading: ADAM (cont'd)
dialog: Who's next, Hank?

speaker_heading: HANK

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: All ready.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADAM

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (through walkie-talkie)
dialog: Camilla Rhodes next!
dialog: 
text: Adam looks up - a beautiful blonde steps into the set in
text: front of the microphone. IT IS THE GIRL! The back-up
text: singers step in behind her.
dialog: 
text: Adam nods to Hank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANK (cont'd)
dialog: Turn over!
dialog: 
text: The cameraman calls out, "Speed".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (through megaphone)
dialog: Playback!
dialog: 
text: Countdown before the music begins.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADAM (cont'd)
dialog: ACTION!
dialog: 
text: The strings soar up and Camilla Rhodes begins to sing.
dialog: 
text: On the set Betty hears the song again and turns and watches.
text: Once again her eyes find Adam as his eyes are finding hers.
text: This time Adam turns away. He watches Camilla for a moment.
text: She is passable, but not spectacular. Adam reaches out and
text: pulls Hank over to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 
text: Adam pauses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Get Jason over here.
dialog: 
text: Hank gets on his walkie-talkie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANK
text: Cindy ... Adam wants to see Jason.
dialog: 
text: Adam continues to watch Camilla Rhodes sing. JASON GOLDWYN,
text: a tall sixty year old silver-haired man, comes through the
text: crowd and stops at Adam's side. He looks down at Adam, but
text: Adam continues watching Camilla Rhodes. Jason follows Adam's
text: gaze and he watches Camilla sing then turns back to Adam.
text: Adam slowly looks up right into Jason's eyes - wondering how
text: much Jason knows, but Jason's face doesn't give away a thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Did you want to tell me something, Adam?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: This is the girl!
dialog: 
text: At that moment Ray, having overheard, comes to Jason's side.
text: He smiles at Adam.

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Excellent choice, Adam.
dialog: 
text: Adam is sick with himself.

text: Across the room Betty panics when she looks at her watch.

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Oh ... oh...I have to be somewhere. I
dialog: promised a friend.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (whispering back)

dialog: trouble.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You're not going to get in trouble.

dialog: That's it ... 2590.
dialog: (nudging Rita)
dialog: Does it look familiar?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Selwyn ... number 12.

speaker_heading: BETTY (cont'd)
dialog: It's this way.
dialog: 
text: They set off down another sidewalk toward Bungalow #12. As
text: they near it and actually can see it just ahead they pass a

text: a man in a dark suit wearing sunglasses.
dialog: 
text: Both girls dive for the bushes.
dialog: 
text: The man in the black suit turns reacting to the noise and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY (cont'd)
dialog: (panting whisper)
dialog: Now, you've got me scared.
dialog: 
text: Peering through the bushes they see the man still looking in

text: to his left.
dialog: 
text: He hurries off, but soon returns carrying two heavy
text: suitcases, followed by an older woman in a yellow dress.
text: Both Betty and Rita crawl further forward. They see the limo
text: and realize that the man they were afraid of is an ordinary

text: up, relieved and a little embarrassed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY (cont'd)
dialog: See, I told you there was nothing to be

speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Oh no ... don't.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RITA (cont'd)
dialog: No one's ...

speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN

speaker_heading: MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I guess you're not Diane.
dialog: 
text: Rita, still fighting her fear doesn't answer.
dialog: 
text: They reach Bungalow #17. It's set back beneath tall bushes
text: and an old Eucalyptus tree. The front door is in deep shadow.
text: Without even looking at Rita Betty knocks quickly. There's no
text: answer. She knocks again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY (cont'd)
dialog: Still not home I guess.
dialog:

text: lying on a bed. Great chunks of mattress are standing upright
text: having been ripped and torn by shotgun blasts. A dried sea of

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
text: Betty is sitting on the bed opposite. Rita opens the hatbox

text: money. She sits down on the bed and while staring at the
dialog: money she thinks of what to say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You've been so good to me ... now we know
dialog: why ... why I was so afraid. We know what
dialog: kind of trouble I'm in. I shouldn't...
dialog: ask you... I only have this to offer.
dialog: I'll give you this if I can stay here for
dialog: awhile. I don't know what else to do.

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Rita... I want you to stay here and you

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: But I want to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: No. We shouldn't touch that money. We
dialog: don't know about that money. That might
dialog: be dangerous money. You have to start all

dialog: person and you can be a brand new
dialog: person... whoever you want to be.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody

dialog: 
text: The girls race up the stone steps toward us. Soon their wind-
text: blown, smiling faces fill the screen as they look out. There
text: before them are the lights of Hollywood with silhouetted
text: palms, slow-moving theater kleig lights, and floating above
text: it all the giant sign in the hills reading HOLLYWOOD.

text: We drift along the red bricks past the payphone, along the
text: wall until we come to the corner. Slowly we round the corner
text: and move to a dark alley. There amongst the dumpsters and
text: trash cans is the dark silhouette of a figure. We move closer
text: to the figure. It is the bum and the bum sits. We move
text: closer and the bum's face fills the screen. It's face is
text: black with fungus. It's eyes turn and they seem to be red.
