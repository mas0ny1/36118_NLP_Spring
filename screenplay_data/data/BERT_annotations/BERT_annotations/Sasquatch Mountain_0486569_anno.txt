text: DEVIL ON THE MOUNTAIN
dialog: "The way grows narrow and dark...Suddenly you find yourself
text: face to face with a towering figure, a shadow composed of all
dialog: your doubts and fears and well armed to defend a treasure"
dialog: - Joseph Campbell, The Hero's Journey
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN ROADWAY - NIGHT
text: A long stretch of road. Pretty damn lonely. We are way up
text: there. Surrounded by dark trees and darker mountains.
scene_heading: WALNUT CREEK, VERMONT - 15 YEARS AGO
text: A LONE WOMAN, sits road side, her car steaming. This we will
text: get to know as SARA. Late 20s, pretty, vulnerable.
text: A TOW TRUCK's red lights appear through the night mist
text: casting an eerie glow across the road. The truck pulls up
text: behind the car, the door opens and the driver steps out.
text: This is CHASE JACKSON, 30 to 40, strong fellow. The two
text: approach each other, stopping a few feet short.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Car trouble huh?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Nothing better at this time of
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Well mam, let me see what I can do.
text: Chase moves to the front of the car, looks it over as Sara
text: watches over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Is it bad?
speaker_heading: CHASE
text: Could be worse. Busted water
text: heater hose.
text: Chase faces the woman, his eyes penetrating hers.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Expensive, huh?
text: He looks her up and down.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Well, at this time of night, it
dialog: might be extra costly.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: (taken a bit by surprise)
dialog: Oh really? You mean, you'll charge
dialog: me more for a night call?
text: It is obvious where Chase is going with this flirting.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Well, it's possible...I might be
dialog: able to accept payment... in other
dialog: ways.
text: She seems to be giving in.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Well....this doesn't sound ethical.
text: He moves in...very close.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Well, let's just call it a barter.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I see...
text: Then the two engage in a long kiss. Sara pulls back and
text: punches Chase in the chest
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Chase...How could you let me go to
dialog: work with a busted water hose?
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: (rubs his sore chest)
dialog: Honey, I told you about that hose a
dialog: week ago.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Telling me and fixing it are two
dialog: different things.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: What about all that women's 1ib?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I'm still happy being a woman thank
dialog: you very much.
speaker_heading: (MORE)

dialog: Who is watching Raquel?
text: Chase moves back to his truck
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: You know for an twelve year old,
dialog: she can almost run the shop
dialog: herself. She's fine honey, she can
dialog: get us on the CB if she needs to.
text: Chase fishes through his TOOL BOX for a clamp and hose.
text: And then we hear that _sound..... The HAUNTING CACKLE OF THE CB
text: RADIO from his truck. It cuts through the rustic silence
text: like a knife.
speaker_heading: RADIO
dialog: ....hey...someone out
dialog: there....anybody?...
text: Chase Stands up slowly, wipes his hands. He listens as the
text: radio once again goes silent, suddenly making his
text: surroundings feel a lot more spooky.
speaker_heading: RADIO (CONT'D)
dialog: (CRACK!) Somebody on the
dialog: line?....Holy mother that thing was
text: huge....moves like the wind
dialog: too...bigger than a bear....Hello?
text: Chase slowly moves towards the radio, as if it were alive.
text: He reaches across the seat and grabs a hold of the mic.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: This is Chase Jackson. Who is
dialog: that? Over.
text: Nothing. He waits a moment, maybe hoping there will be no
dialog: answer.
speaker_heading: CHASE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on back. Over.
text: A beat. Then...
speaker_heading: RADIO
dialog: Hey....hey....What's your ten four?
text: Chase jumps, sighs.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: CHASE
text: Highway twenty four, just east of
dialog: Lonesome Trail.
text: Another beat, maybe longer. Feels like it.
speaker_heading: RADIO
dialog: ....Did you see it then? It's
dialog: incredible. It's heading your way.
dialog: Have you seen.....
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Hello? What's headed my way? Come
dialog: back friend.
text: Wham! A FLASH OF LIGHT hits Chase like a club. Sara stands
text: near by with an OLD TIME VIDEO CAMERA, filming her husband
dialog: playfully.
speaker_heading: CHASE (CONT'D)
dialog: Geez honey...you can blind a guy
dialog: with that thing.
text: She smiles, shifts it around the area.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Grumpy husband...that's what you
dialog: are. Grumpy, stubborn, wants to do
text: things his way, full of pride. But
dialog: you know what...you also believe in
dialog: the best in life like no one I have
dialog: ever known. No matter how bad times
dialog: get, no matter how hard you want to
dialog: resist..you always find a way to
text: come shining through.
text: He smiles and gets back to work. Her light crosses the
text: forest, illuminating the thick trees in an eerie light.
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: This video camera was worth every
dialog: penny...
text: Suddenly SOMETHING HUGE MOVES THROUGH FRAME, in the thicket!
text: Sara jumps, startled. Her eyes now riveted on the tree-line
text: and what it holds. She moves, hypnotized towards where the
text: disturbance was, across the highway, her camera still trained
text: on the trees.
text: Chase continues to fidget with his gear, not noticing.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Grumpy, huh? Why not? I support
dialog: my family driving a tow truck. I
dialog: live in a town that isn't even on
dialog: some maps. My accomplishments I
dialog: could count on one hand. Yeah, me
dialog: grumpy...?
text: Sara is still transfixed on what she saw in the dark, moving
text: towards it. The air is almost completely SILENT.
text: WHAM! A CAR smashes into her from out of nowhere! Chase
dialog: spins...
speaker_heading: CHASE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sara!!!
text: Too late. Her body is thrown into the air.
text: Chase runs to his wife in a panic, dropping to his knees at
text: her crumpled body. He cradles her easily in his lap, knowing
dialog: damn well what is about to happen.
speaker_heading: CHASE (CONT'D)
dialog: No sweetheart....no. Please don't
dialog: go.
text: Beside her is the camera. Battered and torn.
text: The car weaves onward, it's drunken driver has no intention
dialog: of stopping.
text: Chase watches his wife slip from him as he rocks her slowly.
text: Her eyes reaching out to him.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Did you... see it?....Did you?
dialog: Wasn't it...amazing...?
text: And she is gone.
text: Then..... something appears just ahead of him. Something in
text: the darkness, quiet but yet very overpowering. The huge
text: figure appears to be standing upright, watching Chase from
text: the depths of the trees. It's breathing low, from the bowels
dialog: of the earth.
text: Whatever it is....it is enough to draw Chase's attention to
text: it, his teary eyes straining in the night to see what his
text: wive's eyes had.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5)
speaker_heading: THEN WE:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: BLACK SCREEN
text: The SHORT TITLES BEGIN as we hear the VOICE OF AN
scene_heading: INTERVIEWER.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER
dialog: So, have you actually ever seen a
dialog: Sasquatch?
dialog: And then:
scene_heading: EXT. WALNUT CREEK - DAY
dialog: The kind of sleepy village you'd expect to find. The one
text: where the local grocery store sponsors the yearly fair.
text: Rustic but beautiful. Grandma-town.
text: A WIRE-RIMMED GLASSES WEARING RED HEADED KID about 12, looks
text: INTO LENS, the subject of an obvious news piece. We are
text: seeing this through the grain of 16mm or the pixilation of
text: video. A FESTIVITY IN THE BACKGROUND.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Yeah....I saw him once. He was
dialog: stealing a chicken from our yard.
text: He was big and scary and hairy.
dialog: (beat)
text: Then he got back on his giant space
text: ship and flew back to outer space.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And they had really bright lights.
scene_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS - TITLES
scene_heading: WALNUT CREEK - TODAY
text: We move through the town of Walnut Creek as our CREDITS ROLL.
dialog: A Rockwellian picture. Not much has changed here. But like
text: Roswell, it is apparent this town has grown famous for
text: something else: Bigfoot. Images, some absurdly humorous, of
text: the hairy man beast adorn everything from shoe stores to gas
text: stations. A sign with the giant humanoid reads; HOME OF THE
scene_heading: FAMOUS JACKSON FOOTAGE.
text: A tourist trap if there ever was one. And it's in full swing
text: here as cars and trucks move down the small street, tooting
text: their horns. It's NATIONAL BIGFOOT DAY, at least according
text: to the sign in the hands of the guy in THE GORILLA SUIT.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: CONTINUED: ; ; ;
text: Disposable cameras click away, capturing the town's big
dialog: event.
text: WE SEE THROUGH THE UNSEEN NEWS CREW'S CAMERA as they grab
text: sound bites from THE MANY RESIDENTS who either shun or delve
text: heavily into the idea of Bigfoot roaming their land.
text: All these home spun interviews are penetrated by QUICK BURSTS
text: of OLD BIGFOOT STYLE PHOTOS, Men holding giant feet casts and
text: sketches of what might be. There is also clips of SARA'S
text: VIDEO FOOTAGE. That _night...in the dark. Something giant
text: moving through the trees.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER
dialog: We are here in Walnut Creek, a once
text: sleepy town awaken by the now
dialog: famous video clip known in the
dialog: Bigfoot community as the Jackson
text: Footage. Captured by the late Sara
dialog: Jackson who was killed in an
dialog: accident that same night, it has
dialog: become the Holy Grail in the
dialog: cryptozoology circles, the greatest
dialog: find in Sasquatch studies. Asa
dialog: result, this once obscured village
dialog: now shares in it's own kind of
dialog: celebrity.
text: The news crew approaches who we will get to know as Sheriff
text: HARRIS ZEFF, but you might not know it. The early side of
text: 70, he is dressed in his civies. Probably past his prime but
dialog: the job here requires only so much from him. He seems a bit
text: uncomfortable on camera, but smiles all the same.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Have I seen him? Uh no sir I
dialog: haven't. I have seen the
text: occasional prankster in a monkey
dialog: suit. But all this attention does
text: put smiles on most people's faces
dialog: here. Not to mention a few helpful
dialog: tourist dollars.
text: Next we see KEN ROBINSON. Deputy, 30s, dark features,
text: fixated, his eyes scanning the area. The kind of guy that
text: takes charge. He smiles, humoring the TV crew.
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Sasquatch is a very old legend.
dialog: Teddy Roosevelt even wrote about an
text: apparent Sasquatch attack in his
dialog: book back in 1890. The tradition
dialog: hasn't died out yet.

scene_heading: CONTINUED: (2) (nie KEMGRONTUDLy )
dialog: Now what does that tell you?
text: It is obvious this town has finally earned a spot on the map.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: A nice corner of the town. A TRADITIONAL FAMILY walks
text: through frame. And then...like some demented Abbey Road
text: satire a VERY differently dressed group enters THE FRAME.
text: Dressed in black city-slick style, they clash with the
text: surroundings like Rosie O'Donnel and a bikini.
speaker_heading: END CREDITS
text: The apparent leader we will come to know as TRAVIS JENSEN,
text: mid 40s, seasoned, the most focused. A SAMLL EAR CELL PHONE
text: hangs from his lobe. DUSTIN, 40, a slick competitor.
text: Sauntering next to them is KAYLA KELLER. Let's just say she
dialog: is the sexiest bank robber you ever saw. Then we have WADE
text: and KYLE THOMPSON, 30s, street honed, trouble. These two
text: brothers would be joined at the hip again if they could.
text: They move across the street to a parking lot, grabbing some
text: looks as they go. They pull around a corner, stop ina
text: parking lot next to a beat up LINCOLN. wade turns to Kyle.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: What do you think, Chupacabra or
dialog: Loch Ness Monster?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Easy Bro...
text: The same thought hits their head.

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Usually, but it ain't an exact
dialog: science. Some say..
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: ...it's all baloney anyway. But..
text: The two hold up fists.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: ..it makes rock, paper, scissors a

speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Where's lover boy?
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: INT. SERGIO'S CAFE - DAY
dialog: The kind of place you'd expect to find in the middle of
dialog: nowhere. Quiet, Uneventful. SIROM,30s, our local law man
text: sits at the bar with his coffee moving at the speed of syrup.
text: The kitchen door opens. Our BUXOM WAITRESS moves slightly
text: disheveled over to Sirom's table. She fumbles for her note
text: pad from her badly buttoned shirt, the name tag reads
text: “PRISCILLA”.
speaker_heading: PRISCILLA
dialog: Sorry about the wait, Sirom. You
dialog: want some more coffee?
speaker_heading: SIROM
dialog: Naw. This should do me fine.
speaker_heading: PRISCILLA
dialog: Well, have a good day Sirom. Say
dialog: hi to Louise.
text: Priscilla shrugs, licks her lipstick smeared lips, and moves
text: down the diner.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Priscilla moves through the hall, into the darker kitchen. A_
text: PAIR OF TATTOOED ARMS WRAP AROUND HER, COVER HER MOUTH.
speaker_heading: LUKE (0.C.)
dialog: Shhhhhhhhh.
text: The man steps back and into the light. LUKE STEWART is 30s
text: a shirt louder than his personality. Years of tortured flesh
text: wrapped around a child. He taps his gun against his thigh.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Take off your top.
text: Priscilla watches him closely, starts to take off her shirt
text: Luke stares as she gets down to her skirt and bra. He moves
text: over to her, grabs her face and kisses her hard. He pulls
text: back, after a beat....she blows a bubble.
speaker_heading: PRISCILLA

speaker_heading: LUKE

dialog: A second? Guess you really don't

speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: I know those insurance companies

speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: (recovering)
dialog: Sir...I just mean...I know you can
dialog: do it...I just wanted to help if

text: Harris places a hand on Ken.
speaker_heading: HARRIS

speaker_heading: TRUCK.
scene_heading: EXT. BANK - DAY
text: The band of would-be robbers step from the shadows of the

speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Looks good. Every one on their
dialog: game?
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: As long as that boy Luke is here on
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS

text: The crew take one last look around the empty street and start
text: towards the bank...their masks going on as they near the
dialog: doors.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Priscilla is fixing her shirt while Luke sits on the stove,
text: lighting a cigarette off the flames. He now sports a hat that

speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah? Well, you'll love it there.
dialog: Got buildings and everything.

scene_heading: EXT. SERGIO'S DINER - DAY
text: Luke moves from the store and over to the waiting VAN. He

text: takes a look at Priscilla's number, kisses the paper and
text: throws it into the wind.
text: The van speeds off and Sirom steps out to watch it go....
scene_heading: EXT. BANK - DAY
text: Luke's van pulls up to the front of the van. His eyes dart
text: back and forth on the street.
text: Inactive. Perfect. He reaches up and strokes the FUZZY DICE
text: on the mirror as he slowly pulls up to the front.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Come on seven.
text: Once parallel with the window, he peers in.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Through the window we see what must be Wade and Kyle
text: animatedly waving their guns around the room at the few

text: Kayla carries TwO BIG BAGS in her hand, motioning to the
dialog: others.
text: Luke begins to put on the mask when he notes in the side view
text: mirror....Sirom! The cop is walking slowly towards the van
text: from across the street.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: This really sucks.

speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)

dialog: Mask scenario or face scenario?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Face.
text: He jumps out of the van, faces Sirom, acting confused.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Officer, thank god you are here. I

dialog: left and right...well of course if
dialog: I'm driving in circles it's got to

speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: What are you doing Luke?!
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Watching TV. What do you think?
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: He saw your face.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You don't like my face?
text: The group moves into the van quickly.
text: Sirom rolls over, moans as he pulls his gun, fires, breaking
text: out the van window. Sirom gets to his feet, his gun still
dialog: firing.
speaker_heading: SIROM
dialog: Stop!
text: Kyle sticks his gun through the window and shoots...hitting
dialog: Sirom in the chest!
text: As the van speeds off through a group of screaming people,
text: Sirom falls to the warm cement, his blood staining the
text: asphalt pretty quickly.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
scene_heading: NINE MINUTES EARLIER
text: A gas station whose clock stopped working around the 1969
text: rests just off the side of the road.
text: An S.U.V. Pulls up to the pumps. The door opens and we see
text: ERIN PRICE, late 20s. A face to fall in love with but eyes

text: Erin stretches a moment and then turns to her finger.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: An ENGAGEMENT RING, catches the light of the sun. She stares

speaker_heading: RAQUEL (0.C.)

speaker_heading: ERIN (CONT'D)
dialog: So, what's special about this?
speaker_heading: RAQUEL
dialog: This tape is kind of infamous, or
dialog: even famous depending on who you

speaker_heading: RAQUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: It's the last thing my mother ever

text: Erin reacts to this, her attention now locked.
speaker_heading: RAQUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: And in some ways, it's now the
dialog: first thing my father ever seems to
dialog: remember.
dialog: (beat)
text: It only lasts a couple seconds, and
dialog: kind of hard to see as is usually
dialog: the case, but there is something
dialog: there. Maybe a bear, someone in a
dialog: suit...but it's there.
dialog: (Raquel tries to remain
dialog: strong)
dialog: It's grabs your attention, like it
dialog: did my mother that night.
text: Erin, lost in the moment, wanting to hear more, begins to
text: speak when Raquel snaps back into today, pulling out of the
text: past, laughs.
speaker_heading: RAQUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You want me to fill her up?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Uh...yeah. Please.
text: Raquel moves to the pumps while Erin watches her go.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Here ya go.
speaker_heading: RAQUEL
dialog: Thanks. So where you running to?
text: Erin almost looks caught in the headlights.
speaker_heading: ERIN

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Raquel nods to the sealed boxes in the back seat, taped up in

speaker_heading: RAQUEL
dialog: Not that I'm being nosey...well,
dialog: maybe a bit. I watch a lot of
dialog: those detective shows. I saw all
dialog: them boxes taped up like you were
text: in arush. But everything else in
dialog: your car looks so neat. Made me
dialog: think you aren't sloppy so you must
dialog: have been in a real hurry.
text: Erin laughs, knowing she has been pegged.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: That is pretty good. Yeah....Guess
dialog: I am in a hurry. Trying to leave
dialog: one life behind and start a new
dialog: one.
dialog: (beat, plays with ring)
dialog: Maybe I was in too much of a rush.
text: Raquel looks at Erin, thinks a beat and then hands her the
dialog: tape.
speaker_heading: RAQUEL
dialog: You take this. I really don't know
dialog: what I could have sold this for
dialog: It would have either been too much
dialog: or not enough. I think if anyone
dialog: should take this out of my life
dialog: it's someone who knows how to move
dialog: on.
dialog: (re: The Indian Totem)
dialog: I'll even toss this in for free.
dialog: For luck.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Thanks. That means a lot.
speaker_heading: RAQUEL
dialog: Believe me, my pleasure.
text: Erin begins to drive off. She stops a moment at the road
text: when she notices something. She tilts her rear view mirror
text: to see the side of the gas station.
text: Standing there, watching her leave, is a man, 50s. Partially
text: obscured by the screen door. His piercing gaze hits her even
text: from there. This is CHASE JACKSON, twenty years older since
dialog: we last saw him.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: BANG! BANG!

text: he disappears around the back. Erin shrugs and drives off.
scene_heading: EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY
text: We PAN ACROSS the beautiful landscape of this mountain oasis
text: but the view soon turns into something not so beautiful...
text: The totem from Erin's vehicle lies broken on the ground. We

text: automobile carcass.
text: On it's side, is Erin's truck, its body already engulfed in
dialog: flames!
scene_heading: INT. S.U.V. - DAY
text: Erin's eyes flutter open. Blood drips down from her
text: forehead. She looks through her cracked windshield and sees:
text: Another car up on a rock. Wade stumbles around aimlessly.
text: The window is kicked open as Travis moves out with Kayla.
text: Flames erupt around Erin's cab. She reaches for her seat
text: belt, releases it, drops to the ground and looks to A
text: BACKPACK at her feet. She tosses it to the ground outside.
text: As she scrambles to get out, she notices a hand grabbing her
text: backpack. As she moves towards the window, the same hand
text: suddenly reaches in and yanks her out.
scene_heading: EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY
text: Dragged from the burning vehicle she looks up to her savior
text: and sees Luke's bloody face, her backpack in his hand.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: How ya feel?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I...I don't know. Okay, I guess.
speaker_heading: LUKE

speaker_heading: TRAVIS

speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: ERIN

speaker_heading: WADE

text: Erin slowly gets to her feet, the gravity of the scene
text: sinking in.
text: Dustin starts laughing.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Something funny to you Dustin?
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Yeah it is. This is sucha
dialog: metaphor of your life Travis. One
text: frickin car wreck to another.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Shut your mouth Dustin.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: I don't feel sorry for your
dialog: brother, Wade. No one here can

dialog: you and especially not Travis.
dialog: We'd all turn on each other for an
dialog: extra dollar and you know it.
text: Travis shoves Dustin to the ground.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I take it the crash got you
dialog: thinking funny. Whatever redeeming
dialog: qualities we pissed away in our

dialog: remain. Loyalty. Because without
dialog: that... were just some kind of

dialog: Grab her.
text: Luke moves to the others as Kayla yanks up Erin.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Just your friendly neighborhood
text: bank robbers.
text: Ken's car and the truck pull up to a skidding halt. They
text: jump from their vehicles, weapons drawn. They are joined by
text: CRAIG STONE, young and probably never really sure why he took
text: this job. His uniform unbuttoned, sloppy. STANLEY VAUGHN is
text: the new one of the bunch, ready for the next step. And he's
text: about to get it.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Geez...there they are! There they
dialog: are! The ones that killed Sirom.

speaker_heading: HARRIS

speaker_heading: HARRIS

dialog: hostage. Let's keep from shedding
dialog: any more blood.
text: Behind the over turned S.U.V., The crew wait huddled for
text: orders from Travis. Their attention drawn to the new threat
text: Dustin spots a WAD OF CASH and grabs it. He then takes a
text: beat and moves quietly to the mountain edge....and
dialog: disappears.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
text: There's only four of them.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: That's a nice truck too. Toyota

speaker_heading: TRAVIS

dialog: (beat, touches ear phone)
dialog: Hey Charlie...How much is it?
dialog: Okay, buy two thousand shares then.
dialog: Listen, got to go.
dialog: (looks at the cops)
dialog: Okay, let's try not to hit anything
dialog: but the cops.
text: And then they begin to unload!
text: Bullets bounce off of the hood of the car and truck as the
text: local law hits the ground.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: They're shooting! They're
dialog: shooting!
text: Craig drops behind his truck.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Stan you got a damn knack for
text: stating the obvious.
text: Ken returns fire. The chain reaction begins and bullets are

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5)

text: As the cops continue to fire, Harris throws his hands up.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Seize fire!
text: Ken watches, or more appropriately listens, carefully.
text: Harris gets back on his bullhorn, clears his throat.
speaker_heading: HARRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen up. We don't want any more
dialog: getting killed. What do you say we
dialog: talk?
dialog: No response.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What are they waiting for? Should
dialog: we keep shooting?
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Sheriff?
text: Harris takes a breath then looks into the cab of his truck
text: and sees: A DUSTY KOREAN WAR MEDAL, hanging from the visor.
text: Next to that, a photo, somewhere in the 1950s, of Harris and
text: his WIFE. A past long gone.
text: He takes a breath and moves forward into the street, his gun
text: held high.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Sheriff! What are you doing?
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Cover me.
speaker_heading: KEN

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (6)
text: Harris tries to maintain his breathing, tapping into an

text: He pops around the overturned car and sees...nothing.
text: They're gone! He quickly moves to the edge of the road and
text: looks down.
text: The open range dwarfs the small group of robbers as they
text: vanish into the dense trees below. Harris catches his
dialog: breath.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: They're in the timber!
text: The men move over to him quickly, looking over the small
text: perimeter. Craig is pumped.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Wow. Wow. We got ourselves some
dialog: real damn bad guys!
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Should I get Gary on the horn and
dialog: get back up?
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Tell him we need everyone. Make

scene_heading: EXT. FOREST #1 - DAY

dialog: further....
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST #1 - DAY

speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: I always thought Dustin was a
dialog: loser.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Well, it's too late now.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Which way do we go?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS

speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: You look nervous there sweetheart

speaker_heading: WADE

scene_heading: EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY
text: Dustin, disheveled and tired, moves to the water where he
text: bends down and begins to slowly rub his hands in the water,
text: watching the dirt and grime flow from his finger tips. He
text: pulls them out and begins to caress it over his face,
text: cleansing what filth he can from himself.
text: He lets his eyes settle on the river bed as the ripples flow
text: away and his face begins to take shape in the reflection. He
text: stares a moment at himself, shakes his head.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: We'll never be clean enough.

text: through the river.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY
text: Harris, Ken and Craig show up at the area where the bridge

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: We haven't seen one of Eli's damn

speaker_heading: CRAIG

speaker_heading: KEN

speaker_heading: HARRIS

scene_heading: EXT. FOREST #2 - DAY
text: The group of bank thieves move through the visibly more
dialog: confusing area of trees. Hard to get a lead on which way you

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What is that?
text: Ken moves to it, looks it over. His face frowns.
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: If there wasn't so much, I'd

speaker_heading: KEN

speaker_heading: CRAIG

speaker_heading: KYLE (V.0.)
dialog: She killed me.
text: Wade shakes his head, snaps towards Erin.
speaker_heading: WADE
text: She's just holding us back Travis.
speaker_heading: KAYLA

speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Watch your step around here.

text: in the valley.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Break it up.
text: They don't listen. Travis starts to move in on them when....
text: CRASH! A tree, or something, crashes into another tree. The

speaker_heading: KAYLA

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

dialog: Don't screw with me again.
text: As the group enjoy their moment of relief, Erin moves back
text: slowly in the bushes...and bolts!
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST #2 - DAY
text: Erin moves through the trees as fast as her legs will carry
text: her. Twigs snap below her feet, branches slap against her
text: face. Her muscles pound into the dirt like an Olympic
dialog: sprinter and then...
text: A BROWN MASS Crosses in front of her!
text: She stumbles, hits the ground. Erin rolls over, her eyes
text: darting around where the intruder just was. Nothing. Her

text: Footsteps! She turns..... Luke catches up to her, his gun in
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Woah, you run fast for a chick.
text: Erin continues to look the area over, not entirely sure what

speaker_heading: RAQUEL
dialog: Dad...what are you doing out there?

dialog: happy.
text: Raquel pours some wine.
speaker_heading: RAQUEL (CONT'D)

text: Raquel moves back to the table.
speaker_heading: RAQUEL
dialog: Why'd you bring it back here?
speaker_heading: CHASE

text: Raquel sighs.
speaker_heading: RAQUEL
dialog: Look him over?

speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Look...something killed the deer.

speaker_heading: RAQUEL
dialog: Dad, there are a lot of mysterious

text: as the three of them move out into the field.
text: Ken grabs Erin and turns to Harris.
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Move!
text: The men move down the hill, the trio of robbers not far
text: behind them.
text: Harris turns and fires as the dark beast moves from the dense
text: trees. There is a ROAR and then the monster is gone.
dialog: 55.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST #3 - NIGHT
text: The group move quickly down a hill, barely stealing glances
text: behind them out of fear of what they might see. They move
text: through the forest as fast as they can, stealing quick
text: glances back occasionally as the sounds of trees snapping
text: continues behind them.
text: Erin turns and sees:
text: A WOOD CABIN, old, un-cared for.
text: She quickly turns and heads towards it
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Come on.
text: The group pushes quickly towards it.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN - DAY
text: The group blast through the front door, seeking solace in
text: between it's flimsy walls. Wade slams the door shut
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: What is going on?! What the hell
dialog: was that?
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Check the windows.
text: They all move to the windows.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Anything?
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: I don't see anything.
text: A moment of pause and then their current situation comes back
text: into play. Travis spins his weapon at the cops.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Okay, drop em!
text: Harris and Ken are quick with their own draw. The Mexican
dialog: stand off.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Don't do this. Put ‘em down.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: No cowboy...I asked first.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You guys drop them or I swear I'll
dialog: start shooting. I really don't
dialog: care. I'll start shooting.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Easy now son, just stay cool.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Calm down Wade.
dialog: (to Harris)
dialog: Now look, this is going to get us
dialog: nowhere.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: That's the right attitude.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: We ain't putting our guns down
dialog: Travis. Not now, no way.
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Lady, please just relax and
dialog: surrender your arms.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (agitated, scared)
dialog: Not happening! I just saw the
dialog: biggest, freakiest animal I have
dialog: ever seen and whatever it is, it's
dialog: really pissed off.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: (feeling the strain)
dialog: What the hell was that?
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Look, we can help with this.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Oh yeah? You going to go talk to
dialog: it for us?
text: Erin, still pressed against the wall, looks out the window in
text: the kitchen.
text: Something LARGE moves quickly through the bushes!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: She walks towards the window, crossing behind Harris in the
text: line of fire. Everyone slowly turns to her, almost reading
dialog: her thoughts.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: It's out there.
text: CRASH! A ROCK barrels throw the window, flying past Erin's
text: head, destroying a STACK OF SHELVES.
text: Wade FIRES out the window! Harris throws his hands up.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Hold it! Hold it!
text: The shooting stops. Everyone remains quiet, waiting for what
dialog: is to follow.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: What is out there!!??
text: Wade looks to Ken.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Well? Go on, talk to it.
text: Travis, takes the moment and seizes his opportunity: He spins
text: his sights on Erin.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Okay folks, time to settle this
dialog: right now. I don't shoot the nice
dialog: lady and we can all make it out of
dialog: here okay.
text: Wade and Kayla do the same, all three weapons trained on a
dialog: single target.
text: Harris and Ken look to each other.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST #2 - DAY
text: Luke hangs upside down from the tree branches. Blood streams
text: down his face, his eyes shut. The CRACKLING OF TWIGS brings
text: him slowly back to his painful life. His eyes look around,
text: blurry as the MUZZLE OF A SHOTGUN pokes him in the face.
text: Chase leans his head in.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Well, you are still alive.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Help...help me.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Sure.
text: Chase grabs his shirt and yanks him down...hard.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST #2 - MOMENTS LATER
text: Luke looks across at Chase who sits on a rock, his shotgun
text: across his lap, the barrel still pointed at Luke. The blood
text: runs down Luke's hand.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: How'd you find me?
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Not too many gigolos out here.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What are you doing hanging around
dialog: in that tree?
text: Luke becomes more alert as it all starts to come back to him.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Look, whatever the hell that thing
dialog: was it's still out here.
text: Chase tightens.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Thing?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah. I don't know what it was. A
dialog: weird gorilla.
text: This grabs the older man's attention.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: (looking for some
dialog: reaffirming)
dialog: Weird gorilla?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: Thought gorillas were only in
dialog: Russia or someplace.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: You sure it wasn't a bear?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I don't know bears that well...But
dialog: it didn't look like one. I mean
dialog: it hit me like a damn truck.
dialog: (lifts his hand)
dialog: I think it bit me.
dialog: (concern)
dialog: I'm not going to turn into one of
dialog: them am I?
text: Chase's face grows alive as he looks the area over.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: That's a werewolf.
dialog: (beat, excited)
dialog: Where was it? How big?
text: Luke stands, trying to get his bearings, points.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Over there somewhere.
text: Chase prods him.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Let's go.
text: Luke moves forward, staggering.
speaker_heading: CHASE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hurry up.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Hey...I just got my ass kicked,
dialog: give me a break.
text: Chase forcefully sticks his rifle into Luke's gut.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Your lucky I don't take you out
dialog: right now! You killed a police
dialog: officer and I'd have every right to
dialog: gun your miserable self down. Had
dialog: himself a family.
text: Luke looks as if this may effect him...just a bit.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I tried to knock him out.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Stop here.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Luke stops as Chase scans the area, bends down to check the
text: tracks and the blood. His face lights up.
speaker_heading: CHASE (CONT'D)
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: I knew it. I always knew it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But what are you doing?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What did you say?
text: Chase looks back to Luke.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: You stumble on to this thing
dialog: feeding or something? Threaten it?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Threaten it? Let me tell you
dialog: something, there is nothing that
dialog: could make me threaten that thing.
text: Chase nods, his face shows it all.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Tell me where your friends are
dialog: headed.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN - NIGHT
text: WE MOVE with Ken ACROSS the quiet living room until we see
text: Erin and Harris seated on the couch, gun-less. He joins
dialog: them.
text: Travis is seated at the fireplace, the warm glow lighting the
text: room. Kayla watches the windows.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: So....Can one of you two fine
dialog: gentleman tell me what the hell is
dialog: out there?
text: Everyone in the room is quiet. Maybe unsure...maybe too
text: afraid to speculate.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Some help you all are. Well, it's
dialog: nothing that can't be cured with
dialog: enough bullets.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: We're going back out there?
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: We're going to have to sometime.
dialog: No pissed off bear is going to
dialog: stand between me and my money.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Seems nothing stands between you
dialog: all and your money. Some people
dialog: have strange loyalties.
text: Travis notes this key word.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Meaning?
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Just what it is son. Life is all
dialog: about loyalty. Question will
dialog: always be, where do you place
dialog: yours?
text: Travis smiles at the older man.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: You are a pretty smart ol' guy,
dialog: aren't you? A lot going on
dialog: upstairs in that head of yours.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Ain't no more in here than in yours
dialog: partner. I've just been making the
dialog: right choices.
text: Travis is locked into this guy now, something between them.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Whose the one staring down the
dialog: barrel of the gun?
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Is that your criteria for the right
dialog: choice?
text: Travis stands, uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: We are going to need you two to get
dialog: us safe and sound to the Canadian
dialog: border.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Now it's Harris' turn to laugh.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: What's so funny?
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: You lookin for Canada, huh? well,
dialog: I would say you were a hell of a
dialog: lot closer to it this morning. But
dialog: somewhere a long the way, you
dialog: started walkin back to our fine
dialog: little village.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: What? A circle?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Well, take us about ninety minutes
text: at a slight jog to be back in town.
text: BUMP! Something upstairs! Everyone shifts their focus.
text: Travis motions to his two partners. The group pulls back
text: from the stairwell, their guns trained on it in grasped in
text: their shaky fingers.
text: Harris, Ken and Erin eyeball the stairwell.
speaker_heading: KEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Give us a gun.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Shhh.
text: Something moves down the stairs....approaching cautiously.
text: Everyone's eyes trained on it when...LUKE STEPS OUT!
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Hey...thanks for leaving me back
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Damn boy.
text: As they lower there guns slightly....Chase appears, pushes
text: Luke into the center of the room, his gun popping back and
text: forth between the crooks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Drop the guns.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Put it down now!
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Drop ‘em.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: We just went through this partner
dialog: and I'm not about to again. You
dialog: want to get out of here alive, be
dialog: smart.
text: Luke looks to Erin, winks.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Hey.
text: She shakes her head, but is probably still glad to see him.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: I'm the only chance you have of
dialog: getting out of here alive.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: How you figure that farmer Fred?
text: This realization is almost hard for Chase to say after all
dialog: these years.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Because... I think I know.. what's
dialog: out there.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Oh yeah? What's your guess?
dialog: Yeti?
speaker_heading: LUKE
text: The Yeti is actually the Abominable
text: Snowman, it lives in the Himalayas.
dialog: In Tibet it means "little man-like
dialog: animal".
text: (everyone looks at him,
dialog: Luke shrugs)
dialog: This guy is an encyclopedia on all
dialog: that stuff.
text: Travis turns back to Chase, all eyes now on him, maybe buying
text: he does have the answers.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: What you have out there right now
dialog: is something very powerful, very
dialog: smart and for some reason he seems
dialog: to want you all dead.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: How do you figure?
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Because he's been following you a
text: good four miles and it looks to be
text: a bit more than curiosity.
text: Travis fidgets with this, finding for once they must be up
text: against a wall.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: So you trying to tell me you can
dialog: get us safely out of here?
text: Chase laughs at the absurdity.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: I just said I'm the only chance you
dialog: got.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Travis, we can't shoot that son of
dialog: a bitch if we don't have guns.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: And you can't shoot if you don't
dialog: have arms.
text: WHAM! A LOUD METALLIC BANG OUTSIDE.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What's that noise?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: At this point it could be a great
dialog: white shark...
text: WHAM! This sounds more deliberate. And then...WHAM! The
text: lights go out! The GENERATOR HUM quickly dying out.
text: Ken moves to the window and peers out.
dialog: 65.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN - NIGHT
text: Ken presses his face close to the glass to see what's out
dialog: there.
text: A HUGE FORM MOVES BY FRAME! Ken falls back, startled.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN - NIGHT
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: What's going on out there?
text: Glares at him.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Well, since there are no monsters
dialog: out there I guess nothing could
dialog: have taken out the generator.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: What? It can't be that thing, can
dialog: it? I mean, it doesn't have a
dialog: brain.
dialog: (turns to Chase)
dialog: Does it?
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Got a better idea?
text: SLAM! Something heavy and hard hits the front porch.
text: Everyone spins to the door. Wham! Again the noise. Wade
text: grabs his face, looking like he's losing it. Wham!
text: Luke jumps up and moves over to Travis, taking his sidearm
text: from his belt. Travis looks at him.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: You want to check that out?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: I'm just dying to.
text: They move towards the door together....slowly. Wade and
text: Kayla aim their guns as steady as they can. Luke grabs for
text: the handle and stops, whispers to Travis.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me ask you..... why are we even
dialog: opening this door?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Travis just gives him that glare and Luke shrugs, turns the
text: handle. The door creaks open, everyone tenses.
text: The air outside is cold and still and very, very dark....
text: Luke peers outside, his gun ready. Nothing. All is quiet.
text: He closes the door slowly...
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Nothing.
text: Then it happens! Eli's body flies through the open door
text: knocking Luke to the ground.
dialog: Wade fires at them!
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Come on Kyle! Let's take him
dialog: out!!!
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Stop!
text: Travis slams the door, backs up. Luke pulls out from under
text: the body and charges on Wade.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Wade you idiot!
text: Wade sticks his gun on Luke.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I didn't know what it was!
text: Kayla tries not to come unwound.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Who is that old man!
text: Chase appears to be at a loss as everyone else.
text: Erin looks to the corner of the room, her back pack sitting
text: unguarded. She moves to it quickly, flips it open and pulls
text: out from a small zipper inside....A GUN!
text: She charges up to Travis in the commotion and sticks the gun
text: in his ear.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I start shooting in three...
dialog: (cocks gun)
dialog: Two....
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Okay!
text: He drops his. Kayla stares at her a moment and then finally
text: drops hers. Luke snatches Wades from his hands as well.
text: Erin looks at Luke.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You too lover boy.
text: A moment of stunned silence and he tosses his gun. Harris
text: and Ken go for the guns when Erin...
speaker_heading: ERIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold it.
text: They stop, trying to get this figured out.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Well, looks like our damsel in
text: distress has a dark side.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: You okay there little darling?
text: Erin is shaking. Rage, nerves...but shaking.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Oh I'm just fine. I'm real fine
dialog: now. And why am I fine you ask?
text: Trapped in a cabin with a bunch of
text: bank thieves with guns and some
dialog: angry rock throwing monster?
text: She grabs hold of her quickly tensing fingers.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Easy darlin'....
text: Erin looks at Ken and Harris.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: That's easy. Because if you spend
dialog: your life doing everything to
dialog: please someone else, eating the way
dialog: they want, living the way they
dialog: want...even marrying the way they
dialog: want. You can feel pretty...dead.
text: She begins to flick the ring again on her finger, dangerously
text: close to the trigger. Luke moves slowly towards her
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: ERIN (CONT'D)
dialog: So, I go from one man who my whole
dialog: life would never show he cared to
dialog: nearly marrying another who cared
dialog: too much. And for once in my life
dialog: I just do something for myself and
dialog: just leave. And look where I find
dialog: myself?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And the funny thing is, that's what
dialog: makes me feel fine. If things can
dialog: go from that bad to this worse...
dialog: then by all means they got to be
dialog: able to get a whole fuckin lot
dialog: better.
text: Erin looks the group over closely, coming back to reality.
speaker_heading: ERIN (CONT'D)
dialog: So...you want to know what I think?
dialog: If even one of you wants to try and
dialog: get out of here and start your damn
dialog: life over again right...Then quit
dialog: pointing these things at each other
dialog: and start backing each other up!
text: Erin tosses Luke the gun.
speaker_heading: ERIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Here's your chance lover boy. Take
dialog: this thing and use it right. For
dialog: once.
text: Luke slowly, almost apprehensively, takes the gun....He turns
text: to everyone, takes a breath.
text: There is a tacit consensus in the room as every one reaches
text: for the guns and slowly pick them up. No one points them at
text: each other this time, they just go back to checking the
text: windows and doors.
text: Erin sits by the fire place, staring into the flames.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN - NIGHT
text: The rear door to the cabin opens slowly....Harris sticks his
text: head out, looks around, SMALL FLASHLIGHT in his hand.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
text: Can't see nothing.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Travis and Chase step into the door frame cautiously, looking
text: outside as well.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: "Can't see nothing"? Does that
dialog: comfort you?
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Son, at my age I'm comforted
dialog: knowing I am still standing here
text: talking to somebody.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: So, “at your age" can you still fix
dialog: that generator?
text: Harris shoots him a glance, offers out his hand.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Age before beauty.
text: Travis smirks and moves out, Harris follows behind. Chase
text: presses himself up against the door, rifle ready.
text: Harris and Travis move over to the SMALL GENERATOR along side
text: of the wall. A CABLE has been broken off, the dents and
text: scratches on the generator very apparent. They rotate the
text: flashlight to the side where a LARGE ROCK sits.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: How did it know?
text: Harris looks back to Chase who has the same worried look on
text: his face. The sheriff bends down for a closer look at the
dialog: damage.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Looks pretty clean. I think I can
dialog: reattach it.
text: He fumbles around with the cable as both Chase and Harris
text: scan the area closely, nervously. Everything seems to move.
text: The trees. The bushes. The night itself.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
text: Hurry up pops, it's starting to
dialog: feel funny out here.
text: Harris finally reattaches the cable, reaches around to a
text: switch and it hits it. WHOOMP! The generator hums to life.
dialog: 70.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN - NIGHT
text: Kayla and Luke look around the room as the lights come back
dialog: on.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN - NIGHT
text: Travis smiles.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Nice work.
text: And as he light from the cabin slowly illuminates the trees
text: behind Travis we see the blurry but distinct image of the
dialog: giant watching them!
dialog: 
text: Chase sees it first, his face in a momentary state of shock
text: and awe. Then, he is back on reflex.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Move it!!
text: He shoulders his rifle and fires, tearing up the bushes as it
text: roars in anger. Travis and Harris quickly stumble back to
dialog: the door as the thing charges!
scene_heading: INT. CABIN - NIGHT
text: The three men move in the door as quick as they can as the
text: violently moving shape descends on them. They slam the door
text: just in time...backing down the hall, their guns trained on
text: the door.
text: Nothing. Quiet once again. The pounding and roaring never
text: comes. The three drop to the ground, exhausted as the others
text: file in the shadows of the background, silently watching.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN - NIGHT
text: Ken and Wade stand near each other, looking out into the
text: darkness. Occasionally, they steal glances at one another
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: So what are we going to do? Just
dialog: mope around here like a bunch of
dialog: sitting ducks?
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Sitting ducks? That's like a
dialog: thirties gangster term isn't it?
text: Wade casually waves the gun towards Ken.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Be careful Mr. Mountie. When the
dialog: shooting starts again you don't
dialog: want to get caught in front of a

text: Luke moves from the kitchen looks to Ken.
dialog: Luke moves
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Hey what?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You scrap pretty good.
dialog: (turns to Wade)
dialog: Guy hits pretty hard.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Well, not hard enough apparently.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Thanks. That's real nice.
text: off, spots Erin by the fire.
text: Ken looks to Wade and the two exchange a quick uncomfortable
dialog: glance.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN
dialog: Erin plays
speaker_heading: - NIGHT
text: with the videotape in her hands. An OLD TV near
text: by. Luke stands over Erin, stands near her. Kayla rolls her

speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Sounds like you've had a pretty
dialog: crappy day.
text: She doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, you made a move. You said
dialog: screw what everyone else thinks,

dialog: good.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Oh this coming from the womanizing
dialog: bank robber. Well, thanks for the
dialog: moral booster, but somehow it lacks
dialog: a bit of credibility.
text: This stings Luke, but he hides it as well as he can.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What? Like I can't have morals?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You just can't see it can you? Go
dialog: look in the mirror Luke. But look
text: real hard, past the smile and green
dialog: eyes. Look at the heart...if you
dialog: can.
text: Luke tries to find his posture-of-cool again while facing
text: this onslaught of truth.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I'm past all this okay. You don't
dialog: want my friendly pick me up, that's
dialog: fine.
text: He moves away, drops into the couch, looks to Kayla smiling.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Shot down....
text: Luke reaches for a PACK OF SOMETHING on the table. Pulls out
text: a food substance and starts to chew it, reacts and looks to
text: Chase in the corner.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What is this stuff?
speaker_heading: CHASE
text: Freeze dried jerky.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (takes another bite)
dialog: I really want to get out of here.

speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Do you just not realize what you do

speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: He knows when something is going to

speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: No...you don't owe anyone anything,

scene_heading: INT. CABIN KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Chase takes a seat at the kitchen table, trying to peak out

dialog: some estrangement here.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: I'm sorry about your officer. He
dialog: seemed like a good kid.
speaker_heading: HARRIS

speaker_heading: HARRIS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: You don't have to apologize for no

speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Well, okay. I'll apologize for
dialog: myself then. I always figured

dialog: night you lost Sara...it wasn't...I
dialog: also know I had a lot to say about
dialog: you not being a part of my

text: Chase stands. It's uncomfortable, but he can also
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: No hard feelings Harris. What are
dialog: you going to do. I have to pull
text: over some guy speeding through
text: town, he looks up at me and says
dialog: with a snicker: "Hey officer, ain't

text: Then, to both of their surprise, the VOICE OF SARA laughing
text: begins to drift from out of the living room...
speaker_heading: SARA (0.S.)
dialog: Grumpy husband...that's what you
dialog: are. Grumpy, stubborn, wants to do
text: things his way, full of pride.
text: Chase moves from the table as if in a dream, towards the
dialog: living room.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN - NIGHT
text: As Chase rounds the corner, he notes the TV on, the haunting
text: image of himself and his wife on the screen and the group in
text: the living room watching closely, riveted. The tape in the
speaker_heading: VCR.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: But you know what...you also
dialog: believe in the best in life like no
dialog: one I have ever known. No matter
dialog: how bad times get, no matter how
dialog: hard you want to resist..you always
dialog: find a way to come shining through.
text: Chase stops, her words returning to him once again for the
dialog: first time in who knows how many years.
text: And then the large image crosses the screen and pulls
dialog: everyone at_a_new attention.
text: Chase grabs a REMOTE on the table and hits the pause. The
text: creature's misshapen form frozen on the screen. He places
text: the remote back down, looks to the others.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What is this thing? You're old

speaker_heading: LUKE

scene_heading: INT. CABIN BATHROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Admiring my beautiful legs? See, I

speaker_heading: KAYLA (CONT'D)
dialog: That's right. We all got our

scene_heading: INT. CABIN HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Kayla and Erin move down the narrow hallway. As they pass a
dialog: door....
speaker_heading: THUMP !
text: Something on the other side. The two women stop, looking
text: towards it. Erin readies her gun. Nothing more. Kayla
text: looks to Erin and reaches for the handle.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Easy.
text: She turns it slowly and the door creaks open...
speaker_heading: POV
text: The two look into the room, it's darkness hardly inviting.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN - NIGHT
text: The others in the living room align themselves to see down
text: the hall. Chase moves closer. Wade stands near the front
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Don't know old timer...probably
dialog: nothing.
text: As Chase moves closer, those in the living room stand stark

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: There's that stink ag....
text: BOOM! The front door explodes forward and Hell follows with

scene_heading: INT. CABIN HALLWAY - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. CABIN - NIGHT
text: Harris tries to get a shot and then...
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Damn it to hell...
text: He shoots the creature in the leg. It roars and spins Wade

text: him out the front door
speaker_heading: HARRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Everyone out now!
text: Luke spots the cash on the counter and moves for it. Erin
text: pops in the room seeing him grab it. He turns to her, a
dialog: beat, then.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Come on.
text: She runs towards Luke as the rest of them move outside

speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Stay there.

text: SCREAMING AND DESTRUCTION suddenly halt. The silence is
text: deafening. All look towards the dark house staring back at
dialog: them.
text: Ken reaches over and grabs the cash bag from Luke's hand.
text: Footsteps in the trees! They all swing to look and see Kayla
text: moving as fast as she can through the dark.
text: WHAM! The creature charges the front door!
text: All the guns open fire! Tearing the front of the cabin up as
text: the beast roars back inside.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Hold it. Hold it.
text: The gun fire stops, the SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS TEARING THROUGH
text: THE HOUSE. A GLASS BREAKS. Instinctively all look around
text: the side of the house.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Dude, I think he's back outside.
text: Snap! A noise in the cabin again, guns trained to the door
text: instantly. And then...Wade stumbles out! A bloody mess. He
text: collapses to the porch, dead as they get
text: AWHO00000000000000000! A howl that chills everyone's blood,
text: off in the distance. But not far enough.
text: Harris turns to Travis, tosses him a gun.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Let's go.
text: The group starts at a run, the same direction Kayla vanished
dialog: in.
dialog: 80.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST #3 - NIGHT
text: The anxious group plows through the darkness, the moonlight
text: their only guide. Their hearts carrying their legs faster
dialog: and further than they're used to.
text: Harris' breathes deeply, his gasps painful.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST #3 - NIGHT
text: Kayla moves quickly through the trees, not sure where she is
text: going and not caring. Instincts on auto drive. As she
text: pounds through the mud and earth, the sound of crashing trees
text: grabs her attention.
text: She stops, waiting, listening. THE SOUND AGAIN. Her
text: breathing speeds up, the sound too close.
text: Kayla turns to a tree and frantically begins to climb. Her
text: arms grasping for any branch. We grit our own teeth watching
text: her climb. Then beneath her, Sasquatch appears!
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST #3 - NIGHT
text: The group stops, KAYLA'S SCREAMING off in the distance.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Which way?
text: They all look around, tense.
scene_heading: EXT. TREE - NIGHT
text: Kayla struggles up the tree. The Sasquatch begins to ram
text: it's massive body against the tree! Kayla aims her gun un
text: steadily at the monster and fires off several shots to no
text: avail. And then the gun finally clicks!
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST #3 - NIGHT
text: As they stand by, listening hopelessly, Luke raises his shot
text: gun and fires off a blast in the air. The others turn to
text: him, getting the idea and also fire shots off into the air.
scene_heading: EXT. TREE - NIGHT
text: The Sasquatch turns for a moment, the shots grabbing his
text: attention. Kayla makes some distance...but not enough. She
text: has hit the top of the tree! She turns back to see the
text: Sasquatch now once again focused on her.
text: Kayla's face grow's defiant as she spits at the beast.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: You don't get the pleasure you ass!
text: And Kayla dives from the tree!
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST #3 - NIGHT
text: The group are now suddenly aware of the quiet. The screaming
text: and growls no more.
text: Harris, his face in immediate pain, clutches his chest as he
text: collapses to the ground. Ken turns to him.
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Sheriff!
text: The younger cop moves to him, grabbing him.
speaker_heading: KEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Sheriff. Take a breath. Come on.
text: Travis watches closely, shakes his head. Something about
dialog: this sight, he knows.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Breathing ain't going to help him.
text: Ken snaps.
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Shut up you ass! What do you care!
text: And then, in an agonizing moment, Harris goes limp, his
text: breath passing his lips in a final wheeze. Ken places his
text: head to the older man's chest. He then begins to press hard
text: on his chest, over and over.
text: The others watch, feeling the helplessness.
text: Travis takes a deep breath and tosses his gun to Chase,
text: moving towards Harris. As he approaches Ken, the young cop
text: grows defensive, like a lioness over her dead cub.
speaker_heading: KEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Back off!
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Cool your heels Gomer. Let me in.
dialog: (beat, firmer)
dialog: Come on!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Ken pulls back, sensing that it may be the best thing as
text: Travis moves over the fallen sheriff. Travis cracks his
text: fingers. What takes place over the following dialogue is the
text: difficult and desperate CPR tactics for a heart attack. It's
text: hard to tell if the tension in his voice is from his action
dialog: or his memory.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I was thirteen years old and my old
dialog: man could drink an Irish Man blind.
dialog: Drag me to more beer buddy drinkin
dialog: contests than I can remember. But
dialog: one night, he pushed his limit. I
dialog: new that bastard had let his ego
dialog: get the best of him. We were
text: walkin down the docks, Chesapeake
dialog: Bay, I saw him take this big gulp
dialog: of air, thinkin maybe he was trying
dialog: to get some fresh sea salt in his
text: lungs. Then he fell flat on his
text: face. I turned his big bloated
text: belly over and began beating on his
text: chest like a drum...over and
text: over...screamin and cryin. Trying
dialog: to get that rusted heart of his
dialog: going. I said "come on you old
dialog: heart. Beat you son of a bitch!"
text: Then, Harris' eyes open! His breath snapping back into his
text: lungs as he sits up. Travis falls back, exhausted from the
text: effort as Ken moves to Harris.
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Harris! Thank God...
text: All eyes turn back to Travis who slowly rises as if he never
text: once broke from his story, lost in thought.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: ..But, that old boy's heart never
dialog: did start beating again.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Dumb bastard.
text: Travis moves over to get his gun back from Chase, who hands

scene_heading: EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: This clearing up ahead, it's

text: They continue to look behind them, nervously.
text: Erin looks back to see Luke writing something on AN ENVELOPE
text: and sticking it into his pocket. She frowns, knowing there
text: is cash inside of it from the bag. She moves over to him.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Still have your mind on
dialog: "priorities" huh?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What are you talking about?
text: Erin realizes as she speaks...
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You know, it's really not hard to
dialog: change if you want to. It's only
dialog: hard when you really don't give a
dialog: damn.
text: She moves off, leaving Luke alone once again.
text: Ken is walking with Harris, sticking close. He turns to look
text: behind him, seeing the dark length of forest they have
text: managed to clear. But he seems to be looking further than
dialog: that.
text: Harris moves ahead, up to Travis. The two men look to each
text: other, nodding.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Sure.
dialog: (beat, smiles)
dialog: Just don't tell any of my friends.
text: That's when it happens: SASQUATCH vaults from the trees and
text: blasts into Travis, his gun flying from his hand. Chase is
text: knocked to the ground.
text: Luke and Ken charge up firing their weapons into the
text: monster's back. It flinches, but is so far gone in it's
text: primal rage, they don't slow him down at all.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
dialog: Click. Click.
text: Their guns empty. The beast turns a menacing face to them
text: that would freeze the most hardened man. It raises it's arms
text: in what can only be taken as some sort of primitive warning.
text: Travis groans at it's feet, crawls towards the nearby trees,
text: where his gun lies. He grabs it, just as the thing turns to
text: him. And then....We hear the CELL PHONE RING! Both Travis
text: and Sasquatch react.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello? Charlie?
text: The Sasquatch moves to Travis, whose face now registers the
text: inevitable, smiles.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah what the hell Charlie. Sell it
dialog: all....
text: Then the giant grabs Travis and slings him into a tree!
text: Ken's gun empty, grabs for his knife, and in a sudden
text: impulsive moment, charges the beast, jumping on it's back.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Hey!
text: The thing thrashes around trying to throw the human parasite
text: off of him.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Ken!
text: Luke goes for a log and then...
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Forget it! You two cut back
dialog: through the trees. Keep running
dialog: and don't stop.
text: Luke pauses a moment as Chase pulls Harris with him through
text: the trees, back into the forest. He fires off a shot at the
text: beast as it begins to pummel both Ken and Travis. The beast
text: turns to Chase as Luke and Erin slip away in another
dialog: direction.
text: IT TURNS TO THEM, FANGS GLISTENING.
text: Boom! Chase fires another shot and Sasquatch turns back to
text: the older men, moving towards them.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)

scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
text: Erin and Luke tear through the woods, their hearts racing as

dialog: opening up.
dialog: Bam! Bam!
text: The sound of gun fire stops them. They both listen, the loud
text: voices and growls in the distance.
speaker_heading: CHASE (0.C.)
dialog: Hah! Come on!!
dialog: Bam!
text: Then it's quiet. CRICKETS. The wind.
text: WHOOMP! A TRUCK DRIVES by them! It's huge carcass of metal
text: passing by at seventy miles per hour. The two jump. They
text: look to the ground and see the cement.
text: They are on a road! They turn to the truck, yelling. But it
text: continues down the road, the light slowly dissolving into the
text: dark and then it's gone.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Damn it.
text: And then the two look to each other, realizing the CRICKETS
text: are no longer chirping. They turn to the woods, the LOW
text: BREATHING suddenly audible. The hot steam becoming clear in
text: the trees. They step back slowly, watching.
text: Luke turns to look at Erin, catches the look on her face. We
text: see the change in his eyes.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: It would have been nice.
text: She turns to him.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Just start running and don't stop.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Just go!
text: She does, her feet carrying her down the road. Luke turns to
text: the dark form taking shape in the trees and charges.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on big boy.
text: He charges into the darkness. Erin turns and sees as the
text: arms reach out from the blackness and carry Luke up into the
text: air! She stops.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Luke!
text: Slam! Like a car hitting you at 50 mph hour, the SOUND of
text: Luke's breath leaves his body in an explosion. The SOUND OF
text: FLESH HITTING BARK, over and over. It is hard to tell where
text: the crunching noise is coming from.
text: Erin is unable to leave him behind.
speaker_heading: ERIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey! Stop! I'm here!!
text: Luke's limp body sails out of the trees onto the cement.
text: Erin begins to move to him when....the giant steps forward
text: onto the road! He moves over to Luke, reaches down and
text: touches him. Luke groans but offers no resistance.
text: Then, the Sasquatch turns to Erin and begins moving slowly
text: towards her.
speaker_heading: CHASE (0.C.)
dialog: Erin!
text: She turns, surprised to see Chase and Harris limp their way
text: from the trees. Chase's gun now trained on the simian. They

speaker_heading: CHASE (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, come on then!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: But then, something begins to happen...the creature begins to
text: slow, moving at an exhausted walk. His head begins to drop,
text: his once vicious snarl slowly replaced by a softening face.
text: That_is when we notice the trail of blood he is leaving
text: behind. His wounds from the battle leaving their mark on the
text: cold cement.
text: As the three step back, the giant then turns slowly toward
text: the tree-line and drops to his knees, still trying to move
text: forward. He no longer seems to want to get them, he just
dialog: wants to move...somewhere.
text: It crumples to the ground, a sigh of breath escaping from
text: it's collapsing lungs. It's long arm reaching for the trees
text: as if to touch them one more time.
text: The three watch as the giant loses it's battle to life. Erin
text: moves over to Luke, cradling him.
text: And then with one final groan....the Sasquatch dies.
text: The two men move towards it cautiously.
text: Luke looks up to Erin, blood coming from his mouth.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: That....that...was intense....
text: She nods, stroking his hair lightly.
text: Then...another NOISE catches all their attention...in the
text: forest. Chase raises his rifle as the trees part...
scene_heading: ANOTHER SASQUATCH!
text: Harris, Chase and Erin freeze.
text: This one a female, lighter in color. The face of the new
text: comer turns to them, it’s expression a calm that we have not
dialog: yet seen on one of these animals.
text: After a beat, she pulls her gaze from the smaller invaders
text: and moves over to the fallen one. She smells him, twice, and
text: then lets out a noise that could only be a sigh of pain.
text: She knows her mate is dead.
text: She then grabs the fallen body and slowly begins to drag her
dialog: mate back to their green world.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: At the trees, it stops one final moment, the dead creature
text: cradled in it's arms and turns to Chase. Chase returns the
dialog: look to this new one, and we now feel that we may have been
dialog: somewhere like this once before, a long time ago.
text: And that's when we notice the BABY SASQUATCH on her shoulder
dialog: 
text: It's small newborn arms wrapped around her neck, grasping her
text: fur tightly. It's matted hair, still wet from it's recent
dialog: birth.
text: Chase lowers his rifle, Harris lowers his head and Erin holds
text: back what may be a tear as they all come to realize who have
dialog: been the real invaders here.
text: With one final breath, mother and child step back with the
text: fallen father and disappear into the darkness of the timber.
text: Luke's eyes return to Erin.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Reach...reach in my...pocket.
text: She reaches in, careful as he flinches from the pain. She

speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I made a lot of promises...For
dialog: once, I wanted one to be more than
dialog: just a promise.
text: Erin nods, knowing what he means.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I guess even a guy like you has
dialog: something good going on in that
dialog: heart of yours.

speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Even a broken watch....is right
dialog: twice a day....
text: She smiles, then turns, sees Chase and Harris watching them.

speaker_heading: STANLEY

speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Someday. Someday when I want to.
