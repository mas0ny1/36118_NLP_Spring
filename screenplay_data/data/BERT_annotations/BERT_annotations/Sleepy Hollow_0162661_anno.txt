dialog: Sleepy Hollow
dialog: Being the true storie of one Ichabod Crane
dialog: and the Headless Horseman
dialog: Kevin Yagher and Andrew Kevin Walker
dialog: Based on "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" by Washington Irving
dialog: Screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker
dialog: Third Draft
speaker_heading: 4/10/95
dialog: A pleasing land of drowsy head it was,
text: of dreams that wave before the half shut eye...
scene_heading: EXT. GNARLED FOREST -- NIGHT
text: An UGLY MAN charges through on a horse, holding a lantern
text: forward on a long pole. He looks back, terrified.
scene_heading: INSERT TITLE: 1799 Sleepy Hollow, New York
text: THUNDEROUS HOOFBEATS are HEARD behind.
text: The ugly man glances back again. His lantern swings wild...
text: SHATTERS against a tree. The jammed-up pole SLAMS the ugly
dialog: man off his horse...
text: He hits the ground. He runs, trips, falls and scrambles up.
text: DEEP IN THE FOREST, we glimpse the source of the HOOFBEATS: a
text: HUGE FORM on a HUGE BLACK HORSE, already gone.
text: The ugly man pushes through thorny bushes. Jagged branches
text: slit his hands and cheeks.
text: He bursts from the briar patch and tumbles to a trail. He
text: lifts his bloodied face. He runs.
text: IN THE FOREST BEHIND: the hooves of the black horse rip
text: underbrush. HOOFBEATS DEAFENING. A spur digs into the
text: snorting steed's already bleeding flank.
text: The pursuer's gloved hand draws a SWORD, blade RINGING.
text: ON THE TRAIL, the ugly man runs on. The shrill WHISTLE of a
text: SWORD SWING is HEARD as the pursuer blurs past.
text: The ugly man is still running when his head lolls back, at an
text: impossible angle... tumbles off his shoulders... His headless
text: body hits the dirt.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS -- NIGHT
text: Empty cobblestone streets. Crooked buildings. A RAPIDLY
text: CLANGING BELL breaks the silence from afar.
scene_heading: INSERT TITLE: New York City
text: TWO CONSTABLES clamor round a corner, lanterns held high,
text: listening. They rush into an alleyway.
text: ELSEWHERE, piers border the Hudson River. The BELL is
text: LOUDER. The two constables arrive, searching. No one around.
text: Constable One hefts his pistol, scared.
speaker_heading: CONSTABLE ONE
dialog: Where are you?!
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Here! Over here!
text: They hurry to the river's edge. Down a hill, the MAN,
text: another constable, stands with his back to us. He's waist
text: deep in water, tossing away his ALARM BELL.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I need your help with this.
text: Constable Two crosses on the peir above. Constable One moves
text: forward, wary. The MAN grunts, lifting something.
speaker_heading: CONSTABLE ONE
dialog: Constable Crane? Ichabod Crane...
dialog: is that you?
text: The MAN turns. Meet ICHABOD CRANE, handsome, eyes piercing.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Yes, it is me. But, not only me...
dialog: (lifting, struggling)
dialog: I found someone here...
text: He drags a bloated MALE CORPSE up from the murky water.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Someone quite dead.
scene_heading: EXT. WATCHHOUSE/JAIL -- NIGHT
text: The elderly HIGH CONSTABLE lifts a blanket off the corpse on
text: a wheelbarrow manned by Constable Two. A snobby MAGISTRATE
text: looks, disgusted. Constable One and Ichabod wait.
speaker_heading: HIGH CONSTABLE
dialog: Burn it.
speaker_heading: CONSTABLE ONE
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Constable Two wheels the corpse inside. Ichabod's dismayed.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Just a moment... if I may. It is
dialog: possible this man was murdered.
speaker_heading: HIGH CONSTABLE
text: He drowned. Anyone could see.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: There are surgical ways of telling
dialog: how he died... by the water in his
dialog: lungs...
text: Ichabod follows the High Constable and Magistrate in.
scene_heading: INT. WATCHHOUSE, NIGHT WATCH QUARTERS -- NIGHT
text: Constable Two wheels the body ahead past many "booking"
text: tables. A JAILER moves to unlock a massive door.
speaker_heading: HIGH CONSTABLE
dialog: He will be burned pursuant to
dialog: statutes of health.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I could determine if he were dead
dialog: before he went into the Hudson.
speaker_heading: HIGH CONSTABLE
dialog: Must we again hear these heretical
dialog: rantings?
speaker_heading: MAGISTRATE
dialog: Yes, must we?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: There is nothing heretical about
dialog: science, sir. The Chinese have
dialog: written on it for hundreds of
dialog: years... procedural study used to
text: solve seemingly unsolvable crimes.
text: The door is opened. The corpse again leads the way.
scene_heading: INT. WATCHHOUSE, JAIL -- NIGHT
text: A two-tiered prison, alive with MOANS of AGONY and CRIES of
text: INSANITY. Cells are full of wretched men in chains and iron
text: gags. Many are against the bars, watching.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Our first night watch is adequate
dialog: against fire and some violence,
dialog: but if we were more often able to
dialog: ensure justice, after the fact,
dialog: then criminals would truly have
dialog: something to fear from law
dialog: enforcement.
speaker_heading: HIGH CONSTABLE
dialog: Have they nothing to fear presently?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Without disrespect, look around you.
dialog: (motioning to cells)
dialog: We overflow. As do our courts.
speaker_heading: HIGH CONSTABLE
dialog: And, with disrespect, Constable,
dialog: if jails and courts overflow, it is
dialog: testimony to success, not failure.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: But, how many innocents rot here?
dialog: And, how many victims are buried
text: without reprisal while guilty men
dialog: roam our streets?
text: The High Constable reaches a desk, taking a seat. Guards
text: wait to process beaten, bloody prisoners.
speaker_heading: HIGH CONSTABLE
dialog: Very few, if any.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Even though I have seen confessions
text: pried from the lips of the accused,
dialog: often quite literally?
speaker_heading: HIGH CONSTABLE
dialog: For one who calls himself a
dialog: Federalist, your mouth reeks of
dialog: Republican liberalism.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Not Liberalism. Equanimity.
speaker_heading: MAGISTRATE
dialog: (to High Constable)
dialog: Um, sir... might I suggest...
text: The Magistrate WHISPERS in the High Constable's ear. Ichabod
text: notices with worry that Constables One and Two wheel the
text: corpse onwards into another room.
text: The Magistrate finishes. The High Constable smiles faintly.
speaker_heading: HIGH CONSTABLE
dialog: (to Ichabod)
dialog: There is a farming community
dialog: upstate, Constable... ten days
dialog: journey north in the Hudson
dialog: Highlands. It is named Sleepy
text: Hollow. Within a fortnight, three
dialog: persons have been murdered there.
text: Each with their head lopped cleanly
dialog: off.
dialog: (holds up papers)
dialog: The elders of the Hollow have sent
dialog: dispatches to me, requesting
dialog: assistance, and now, just this very
dialog: moment, I have chosen you.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Chosen me?
speaker_heading: HIGH CONSTABLE
dialog: These "methods" of yours... there
dialog: has been no practical application.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Not for lack of trying.
speaker_heading: HIGH CONSTABLE
dialog: Just so. Granted. And so you take
dialog: your experimentations to Sleepy
dialog: Hollow and catch the murderer who
dialog: has tainted the place. Bring him
dialog: here to face our good justice.
dialog: Will you do this for me?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (swallowing doubt)
dialog: I shall, gladly.
speaker_heading: HIGH CONSTABLE
dialog: Excellent. Then, you are excused
dialog: till morning.
text: Ichabod moves away, heading to where the corpse was taken.
speaker_heading: HIGH CONSTABLE
dialog: Oh, and, Constable...
dialog: (off Ichabod's look)
dialog: Do make certain that you meet with
dialog: success. Otherwise... perhaps you
dialog: should not come back at all.
text: The High Constable smiles a sardonic smile.
scene_heading: INT. WATCHHOUSE, INCINERATION ROOM -- NIGHT
text: The corpse burns in a raging furnace. Flesh sizzles.
text: Constable One pumps bellows which fan the flames. Ichabod
text: steps from darkness nearby. He watches with bitter regret as
text: the corpse is consumed.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY -- DAY
text: Market town streets bustle. Filthy. Pigs roam free.
scene_heading: INT. ICHABOD'S HOME, SECOND FLOOR -- DAY
dialog: Decorated in Early-American Mad Scientist: books, papers and
text: jars of chemicals. Charts of anatomy above a small bed.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD (o.s.)
dialog: Such a day for such a sad farewell.
dialog: But, this is goodbye, my sweet.
text: At the window, Ichabod holds a bird cage with a red CARDINAL
text: inside. He opens the cage. The bird flies free.
text: Ichabod watches it go, then looks down. A COACH halts in the
text: street below. The forlorn DRIVER looks up.
scene_heading: INT. ICHABOD'S COACH -- DAY
text: In motion. Ichabod absently studies his hands, touching the
text: strange SCARS on both palms: evenly dispersed, tiny dots of
text: tissue. Many scars.
text: Ichabod lifts a LEATHER SATCHEL, checking its contents.
scene_heading: EXT. UPSTATE FORESTS -- DAY
text: TWO FAMILIES of MIGRANT WORKERS travel a path, leading over-
text: burdened horses. Ichabod's coach approaches from the other
text: direction. Ichabod looks out, unnerved.
text: One GAUNT MAN watches Ichabod pass. There is a dead, worried
text: look in the man's eyes. Others stare at Ichabod.
scene_heading: EXT. SLEEPY HOLLOW, THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- DAY
text: Ichabod faces two massive, vine-covered PILLARS, unsure. He
text: turns to watch the driver lead the coach away.
text: Ichabod walks between the pillars to a long straight road.
text: He does not notice, above: THREE DEAD RAVENS hang from a tree
text: limb, twine wrapped round their necks.
scene_heading: EXT. SLEEPY HOLLOW, TOWN SQUARE -- DAY
text: Ichabod walks on with baggage. The square is empty, a CHURCH
text: and GRAVEYARD at one end. The road ahead is bordered by
dialog: businesses and homes.
text: CONVERSATION DRIFTS from a tavern. A criminal sits in
text: stocks. A quiet CRYING is HEARD. Ichabod hears...
text: He looks for its source. It's from a window above, LOUDER.
text: SOUNDS like the SOBBING of an OLD WOMAN.
scene_heading: EXT. VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- DAY
text: ICHABOD'S P.O.V.: a BELLTOWER stands tall, like a mast pole
text: with a crow's nest basket atop. There's a man in the basket
text: and a huge BELL.
text: Ichabod ponders this as he continues. Ahead on a hill: the
dialog: grand Van Tassel Manor House.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL MANOR HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- DAY
text: MANY CHILDREN, in a circle, taunt a BLINDFOLDED YOUNG WOMAN
text: spun round by the handsome, barrel-chested man, BROM VAN
text: BRUNT. A few YOUNG MEN and LADIES watch. Brom releases the
text: woman. Everyone quiets and avoids her searching hands.
speaker_heading: BLINDFOLDED WOMAN
dialog: This is such a silly game.
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: Be a sport and stop complaining.
text: The woman moves to Brom's voice. He backs away, flanked by
text: peers GLENN and THEODORE. Children laugh.
text: Ichabod enters, clearing his throat. No one notices. The
text: blindfolded woman keeps grasping. One LITTLE GIRL sees
text: Ichabod and goes to him, finger to her lips.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: Play along. You must.
text: She tugs him. Before Ichabod can protest, he is placed in
text: the blindfolded woman's grip.
speaker_heading: BLINDFOLDED WOMAN
dialog: There, I have someone. Am I
dialog: finished?
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: You have to tell who it is.
text: The woman touches Ichabod's face. He is uncomfortable,
text: affected by this caress. Brom watches jealously.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: At least make a guess.
speaker_heading: BLINDFOLDED WOMAN
dialog: I don't know. Is it Brom Bones?
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: Certainly not.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Excuse me, Miss...
dialog: (takes her hands)
dialog: They have a laugh at your expense.
text: She takes the kerchief off to reveal a stunning beauty:
text: KATRINA VAN TASSEL. Ichabod tries to compose himself.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Forgive me, I didn't know.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I... I am looking for Baltus Van
dialog: Tassel.
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: We haven't heard your name yet,
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Well, unless your name is Baltus,
dialog: you should not worry over mine.
text: Brom grabs Ichabod's collar, pissed. Ichabod's baffled.
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: You need some manners.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Brom!
text: Brom looks at her, then reluctantly releases Ichabod.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: What is this, then... ?
text: BALTUS VAN TASSEL, 45, has entered, a working-class
text: aristocrat. LADY VAN TASSEL, 40, stands behind, a mix of
text: home-spun wife and well-kept lady.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: Can I help you, sir?
dialog: Ichabod's relieved to have a proper focal point. Children
text: gather around Katrina and hide behind her.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I have been sent from the city
text: with a letter of introduction.
dialog: I am told you offer me room and
dialog: board.
text: Ichabod hands over papers. Baltus reads, furrows his brow.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: If we could speak alone.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: (nods, looks to Katrina)
dialog: This is not a time for frivolity,
dialog: Katrina, is it? Am I mistaken?
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: They're only children, father.
text: Baltus snorts, then exits with Ichabod. The others huddle to
text: gossip, except Katrina, who moves beside Lady Van Tassel to
text: watch Ichabod and Baltus walk down the hall.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, PARLOR -- DAY
text: DOCTOR LANCASTER, 50, dour and always sweaty, takes a seat by
text: the fire, joining Baltus and three other elders. A pretty
text: servant, SARAH, brings a pipe cradle while Lady Van Tassel
text: sets down food. Ichabod is standing.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: That will be all, ladies.
dialog: (waits as they exit)
dialog: We are joined by Doctor Thomas
dialog: Lancaster, Constable. And to his
text: left are, Clergyman Steenwyck and
dialog: our able magistrate, Samuel Philipse,
text: both keeping order in their own ways.
text: PHILIPSE is youngest, eyes bloodshot, mug in hand and pipe in
text: mouth. CLERGYMAN STEENWYCK is formidably built, wearing a
text: constant look of disapproval.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: I myself am in charge of financial
dialog: matters and the regulation of
dialog: currency in our commonwealth. And,
dialog: lastly, this fine fellow is James
dialog: Hardenbrook, our Notary.
text: HARDENBROOK is oldest, ancient, with one eye pale and blind.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: An honor, gentlemen. In time I
dialog: will need every detail of the
dialog: three murderings you've had, but,
dialog: for now, I ask only if you have
dialog: any theory at all as to who the
dialog: killer might be?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LANCASTER
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I say, is there any one person
dialog: suspect in these acts?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LANCASTER
dialog: I was afraid of this.
text: Philipse shoots a look to Baltus. Angst amongst the elders.
speaker_heading: PHILIPSE
dialog: Well, Constable... are you aware...
dialog: to be honest, you are not what we
dialog: expected. We sent for the militia.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: The militia?
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: Why not tell us what you have heard?
dialog: Hmm? How much have your superiors
dialog: bothered to tell you?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: All I know is three are slain, their
dialog: heads found severed from their
dialog: bodies...
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
text: The heads were not found severed.
text: The heads were not found at all.
text: Withered Hardenbrook leans forward, his voice cragged.
speaker_heading: HARDENBROOK
text: Taken. Taken by the Headless
text: Horseman. Taken back to hell.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Pardon me?
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: You have not been well informed of
dialog: our troubles, sir. If you would...
text: Baltus gestures for Ichabod to sit. Baltus lights his pipe.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: The Horseman... he was a Hessian
dialog: mercenary, sent to our shores by
dialog: German princes to help keep
dialog: Americans under the thumb of
dialog: England. However, unlike his
dialog: compatriots who came as muscle in
dialog: trade for currency, he came
dialog: willingly. For love of carnage.
scene_heading: FLASHBACK -- AMERICAN BATTLEFIELD -- DAY
text: The HESSIAN HORSEMAN rides his black steed into a gory,
text: close-quarters clash, his cloaked uniform adorned with edged
text: weapons. He cuts down Americans left and right.
speaker_heading: BALTUS (v.o.)
dialog: He was infamous for taking his
text: horse, Daredevil, hard into
text: battle... chopping off heads at
text: full gallop.
text: He dismounts, hoisting a battle axe. With sword and axe, he
text: annihilates. Blood gushes. Bones crack.
speaker_heading: BALTUS (v.o.)
dialog: Just to look on him made your
dialog: blood run cold, for he had filed
dialog: down his teeth to rapiers... to
dialog: add to the ferocity of his
dialog: appearance.
text: The Horseman lets out a war cry. Jagged teeth. Grotesque.
scene_heading: FOREST BATTLEFIELD -- DAY
text: Winter. CANNONS can be HEARD BOOMING from afar. Daredevil
text: lies dead in red snow. FOLLOW FOOTPRINTS away...
speaker_heading: BALTUS (v.o.)
dialog: He would not finally meet his end
dialog: till the winter of seventy-nine,
dialog: when New York City was held by
dialog: Henry Clinton and Washington
dialog: occupied West Point. It was
dialog: between those two places, not far
dialog: from here...
text: The Horseman flees, cloak flowing, chased by FIVE rag-tag
text: REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIERS. Ahead, a steep, rocky area prevents
text: escape. Soldier one aims a rifle and FIRES...
text: Blood explodes from the Horseman's arm as he runs. His sword
text: falls from his now functionless hand.
text: Soldier Two grabs the sword.
text: At the rocks, the Horseman faces the men. Another Rifleman
text: raises his rifle. The Horseman reaches over his shoulder to
text: grasp a sheathed knife, THROWS --
text: THOCK! The Rifleman jerks back, knife in his eye socket.
text: The Horseman readies an axe. The Revolutionaries move in
text: with swords. They battle, STEEL AGAINST STEEL. The Horseman
text: fends off blows from all sides.
text: Soldier Three lunges, stabs his blade deep into the
text: Horseman's side. The Horseman roars, brings his axe DOWN...
text: BREAKS the sword at the hilt...
text: An UPWARDS stroke sends Soldier Three head over heels in a
text: fountain of blood.
text: The Horseman staggers, howling, trying to pull the blade from
text: his ribs. The remaining soldiers close in.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Pipe smoke wafts from Philipse's mouth.
speaker_heading: PHILIPSE
text: Cut off his head with his own sword.
dialog: It's a legend told for twenty years.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: But, only recently has the Headless
text: Hessian been seen prowling the
text: Hollow, in search of a head to suit
text: his shoulders.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Just a moment...
dialog: (sits back, incredulous)
dialog: Are you saying it is he?
speaker_heading: HARDENBROOK
dialog: (aggravated, loud)
text: When a goblin leaps from the nether
text: world, others follow. Poltergeists
dialog: of the air, water and earth follow
dialog: and cheer his desecrations!
text: Hardenbrook BANGS his cane on a table. Baltus puts a calming
text: hand on senile Hardenbrook's shoulder.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LANCASTER
dialog: No one knows why he chose to now to
text: climb out from his grave.
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: It is very clear why. Citizens
dialog: here have long tried to hide sins
text: behind closed doors. Their failed
dialog: faith has saturated the soil and
dialog: called forth one of Satan's own.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who
dialog: has seen this Horseman?
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: Many have.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Then, name one person who has seen
text: him with their own eyes.
text: A long wait. No reply from the elders. Ichabod rises.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: While I will do everything I can
dialog: to find your assassin, I will look
dialog: for a man of flesh and blood. Not
dialog: some goblin-demon from hell.
scene_heading: EXT. BELLTOWER FIELD -- EARLY EVENING
text: The Belltower is covered in defensive spikes. A man climbs
text: down a rope ladder. Below, many ARMED MEN gather. Everyone
text: grim. Philipse moves to the center, on horseback.
speaker_heading: PHILIPSE
dialog: Gather round! Gather and quiet!
dialog: The hour has come to choose for
dialog: this night. Each man's name is
dialog: in this box and has been checked.
text: A box is handed up. Ichabod and Baltus arrive on foot at the
text: back of the mob. Ichabod looks...
text: At a nearby forest, men light TORCH POSTS in a line bordering
text: the forest edge for at least a half mile.
text: Philipse draws a folded paper from the box, holds it up.
speaker_heading: PHILIPSE
dialog: May the Lord watch over him...
dialog: (unfolds paper)
dialog: "Jonathan Masbath." Are you here?
speaker_heading: JONATHAN (o.s.)
dialog: I am. I take my responsibility.
text: The crowd parts as JONATHAN MASBATH, a dirt-poor farmer with
text: a bow and quiver of arrows, moves forward. His son, YOUNG
text: MASBATH, 14, grips his arm.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: No, father. Wait...
dialog: (up to Philipse)
dialog: He's already been up once. Why
dialog: does he go again?
speaker_heading: JONATHAN
dialog: It is a lottery, son. It just as
dialog: easily might have been one of them.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Then... I go with you.
speaker_heading: JONATHAN
dialog: No. You obey my wishes.
dialog: (looks to crowd)
dialog: Brom. Look after him, will you?
text: Brom steps up, nodding. Jonathan kisses his son's cheek,
text: then heads to the rope ladder. Men pat him on the back.
speaker_heading: PHILIPSE
text: Someone leave him a horse.
text: Young Masbath watches his father go. Brom coaxes him away.
text: At the back of the crowd, Ichabod watches skeptically, looks
text: to Young Masbath as he and Brom pass.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: You worry for naught, little man.
dialog: Nothing will harm him there.
dialog: (looks up, sotto)
dialog: It is problems here on the ground
dialog: you people need begin to worry
dialog: about.
text: Ichabod watches Jonathan climb, very high above.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod makes notations in a LEDGER BOOK.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (v.o.)
dialog: You will dream.
text: Katrina strolls in, sits on the bed. Ichabod is nervous.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Did they tell? It is something in
dialog: the air so that dreams come to
dialog: everyone. According to the elders,
text: an Indian prophet held powwows here
dialog: before the land was taken, and
text: spells cast then still linger to
dialog: this day.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Do you often make a habit of
dialog: sitting on strange men's beds?
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: You are horribly old-fashioned,
dialog: aren't you?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Feel free to form your own opinion.
dialog: (facing his ledger)
dialog: Though it appears you already have.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Well, I intended to apologize for
dialog: the behavior of my friend Brom Van
dialog: Brunt, but it seems I've made
dialog: matters worse.
dialog: (getting up to go)
dialog: I'll leave you to your business.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Excuse me... I should apologize. I,
dialog: um... I... have no great love of...
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Other people?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Small talk.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: It might have been more. Might have
dialog: been positively grand talk.
text: Ichabod offers his chair, backing away. Seeing it is the
text: only one, he remains standing. Katrina sits.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Is it me, or are you this nervous
dialog: around all women?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Perhaps it is because your suitor's
dialog: hands were recently very nearly
text: wrapped around my throat.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: My suitor?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: The massive fellow... Brom. For
dialog: someone you call "friend," he
text: misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: He has proposed to me twice.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Which may explain his temperament.
dialog: To have asked twice means the answer
dialog: was "no" at least once.
text: Katrina looks down, discards this with a smile.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: I've read a great deal about your
dialog: New York City. Do be a dear and tell
dialog: me all about it. Sounds like an
dialog: extraordinary place to live a life.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Extra ordinary, yes. But first, you
dialog: tell me about the Headless Horseman.
scene_heading: EXT. BELLTOWER FIELD -- NIGHT
text: The torches burn bright. ABOVE, in the Belltower, Jonathan
text: Masbath loads a rifle. THUNDER BOOMS.
text: Jonathan stands, looking to a sky that is all stars and moon.
text: A HORSE is HEARD SHRIEKING. Below, the horse tied at the
text: base of the tower is spooked.
text: A COMMOTION is HEARD, ground rumbling. Jonathan grips a
text: rifle, cocks it and moves to look...
text: At the forest edge, a herd of deer stampedes out. They
text: sprint past the tower and across the field.
text: Jonathan crosses to watch the herd scatter. He crosses back
text: to peer at the forest. Bad news...
text: A thick FOG creeps from the woods.
text: As the fog overtakes the base of each torch, a tentacle of
text: mist snakes up to the flame, killing it. All along the
text: forest, arms of vapor snuff torches... one by one by one...
text: Above, Jonathan sights the rifle along the trees.
speaker_heading: JONATHAN
dialog: Come out, devil... come....
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod leans on a dresser. Katrina's still seated.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Not all think it is the Horseman.
dialog: Many say witches come from the
dialog: Western Woods to steal skulls for
dialog: their cauldrons. Some believe a
dialog: person in this very town kneels
dialog: before Lucifer, offering death as
dialog: tribute. And, still others believe
dialog: none of it.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Are you so superstitious?
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: To call a person superstitious is to
dialog: imply they fear magic, but not all
dialog: magic is black.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: There is no such thing as magic.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Really? Then... what is your
dialog: rebuttal to those romantic poets
dialog: claiming proof of magic in a rose at
text: full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Poets have silly notions about

speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: You are funny.
dialog: Ichabod doesn't get what's so funny about that. The DISTANT
text: TOLL of a BELL is HEARD. Katrina looks fearful.
text: She goes to open a window. The BELL TOLLS...
scene_heading: EXT. SLEEPY HOLLOW, OVERVIEW -- NIGHT
text: ... TOLLS mournfully over farms and forests...
scene_heading: EXT. FARM -- NIGHT
text: ... TOLLS as a MAN comes from his barn, listening, then
text: sprinting towards his home.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT
text: ... TOLLS across the deserted square. Windows go dark.
text: Shutters are slammed shut.
scene_heading: EXT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: ... TOLLS. Ichabod bounds out to the lawn, halting to
text: listen. Katrina and Baltus come out on the porch.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: Constable, where are you going!?
text: ... TOLLS... TOLLS... then, SILENCE. Ichabod chases away.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: Come back, sir...
dialog: (watches him go)
dialog: Madness.
text: Baltus ushers Katrina back in. The door slams.
scene_heading: EXT. BELLTOWER FIELD -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod charges across the rocky field. He slows, awed...
text: The Belltower is down, its mast is splintered. The horse is
text: gone. Ichabod moves to where the crow's nest lies smashed.
dialog: No sign of Jonathan.
scene_heading: EXT. SLEEPY HOLLOW FOREST -- NIGHT
text: Jonathan runs past, gripping his bow. It's QUIET... till
text: HOOFBEATS are HEARD in pursuit.
text: Trees are silhouetted against the sky. As HOOFBEATS get
text: LOUDER, branches bend like arms and fingers yearning to
text: touch. As HOOFBEATS ROAR PAST, the trees relax.
text: FURTHER ON, Jonathan runs. WIND begins to BLOW.
text: BEHIND, in motion, WE SEE Daredevil's snorting visage; eyes
text: lizard-like, with vertical slits literally aglow.
text: The Horseman's hand yanks a wooden WAR HAMMER from a saddle
text: mount. (No clear view of the Horseman.)
text: HORSEMAN'S P.O.V.: closing in on Jonathan.
text: Jonathan is overtaken. The Horseman swings the hammer WHOOMP
text: -- sends Jonathan sprawling.
text: HOOFBEATS FADE. Jonathan tries to get up, but pain shoots
text: through him. He crawls to retrieve his bow.
text: Against a tree, he takes an arrow from his shoulder quiver
text: and readies it. Waiting. A metal TAPPING is HEARD O.S.
scene_heading: CLINK... CLINK... CLINK. A HORSE SNORTS.
text: Jonathan pulls the bow taut, pained, lips bloody.
text: Elsewhere, Daredevil approaches slow. The Horseman taps his
text: sword on his spur, CLINK... CLINK... CLINK...
text: Foliage moves as the Horseman's form pushes through.
text: Jonathan releases -- the arrow WHISTLES...
text: THWACK! -- imbeds in the Horseman's chest.
text: CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... continues -- Jonathan readies a
text: second arrow. Pulls and releases -- O.S. THWACK!
text: CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... Jonathan cries out, crawling away
text: desperately. Crawling through underbrush, over roots and
text: rocks. CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... Jonathan gives up, spent,
text: face to the dirt. He closes his eyes.
text: CLINKING STOPS. Daredevil halts astride Jonathan; two legs
text: on each side of Jonathan's body.
scene_heading: EXT. SLEEPY HOLLOW FARMLAND -- MORNING
text: Baltus and a large, DULLARDLY MAN ride. Behind, Ichabod
text: rides with Magistrate Philipse.
text: Ichabod is not adept at riding his old nag, Gunpowder.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: The Van Garretts died first; a man
dialog: and his son, survived by a wife and
dialog: two infants. And the Widow Windsor
dialog: was next...
speaker_heading: PHILIPSE
dialog: And now Jonathan Masbath.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (looks back, ponders)
dialog: Why would he flee this direction,
dialog: with so much open ground to cross
dialog: before he reached cover?
speaker_heading: PHILIPSE
dialog: He would not have gone into the
dialog: Western Woods. No sane man would.
text: Philipse drinks from a whiskey flask, sees Ichabod watching
text: and offers some. Ichabod declines.
speaker_heading: PHILIPSE
dialog: Van Ripper there...
text: Ahead, the dullard, VAN RIPPER, sloppily spits tobacco.
speaker_heading: PHILIPSE
dialog: ... found the body this morning.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You do believe now, don't you?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Believe?
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: You said yourself. What mere man
dialog: could have downed the Belltower?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: It is a prime tenet of science,
dialog: Philipse, that because one thing
dialog: appears improbable does not mean
dialog: you embrace the utterly fantastical.
speaker_heading: PHILIPSE
dialog: You need less big words, and more
dialog: common sense.
text: Philipse fingers an IRON KEY talisman he wears on a cord.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: What is that you wear?
speaker_heading: PHILIPSE
dialog: My talisman. It will, protect
dialog: against the Horseman if I show a
dialog: brave face. But, I cannot run. If
dialog: I run in fear, it is worthless.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Well... so much for common sense.
scene_heading: EXT. SLEEPY HOLLOW FORESTS, FURTHER ON -- MORNING
text: Brom and Baltus stand at a HORSE'S CORPSE amongst jagged
text: boulders. The flesh has been stripped, guts exposed.
text: Philipse and Ichabod arrive and dismount.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: Was this Jonathan's?
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: Yes. Seems he panicked across here
dialog: and broke two legs.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Who took the meat?
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: Must have been the Redman. A Lenape
text: Indian lives in the Western Woods.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: These woods of yours sound a bit
dialog: crowded, what with all the witches,
text: ghouls and Indians living there.
text: Brom climbs up onto his own horse, a black beauty.
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: There's only one Lenape. He eats
dialog: small animals and lost children...
dialog: and the occasional constable when he
dialog: can get it.
text: Brom rides. Ichabod goes to the dead horse, digs in his
text: satchel for a thin iron tool, which he uses it to pry off one
scene_heading: HORSESHOE. A WHISTLE is HEARD O.S.
text: Everyone looks far ahead to where Van Ripper has ridden. The
text: doctor and others are there. Van Ripper waves.
scene_heading: INT. FOREST, MASBATH MURDER SITE -- MORNING
text: Doctor Lancaster stands with SEVERAL ARMED MEN. A coffin on
text: a cart is covered by a blanket. Ichabod is crouched nearby.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Why did you move the body, Doctor?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LANCASTER
dialog: To place it inside its coffin.
text: Ichabod, nods, vaguely annoyed. He puts the horseshoe into a
text: hoofprint in the dirt. It fits.
text: Ichabod rises, walks, studying the ground, kicking up leaves.
text: Brom, Van Ripper, Baltus and Philipse watch.
text: Ichabod finds a deep hoofprint. Huge. He compares the
text: horseshoe. The hoofprint is much larger.
text: Ichabod pulls his satchel off his shoulder, takes out a bowl,
text: bottle of water and bag of brown powder; begins mixing water
text: and powder with a fork to make plaster.
text: The others watch, finding this bizarre, whispering. Brom
text: comes up to stand over Ichabod, irritated.
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (ignoring pause)
dialog: You are the blacksmith. Ever shod
dialog: a horse with a hoof this large?
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: Never. A shoe that size I would
dialog: have remembered.
text: Ichabod starts to fill the print with plaster.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Van Ripper. Can you show where the
dialog: body lay?
speaker_heading: VAN RIPPER
dialog: I can show exactly.
text: Van Ripper dismounts, wiping tobacco drool. Ichabod rises to
text: follow with his satchel.
speaker_heading: VAN RIPPER
dialog: Here... in front of this oak, facing
dialog: north. Horrible...
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: To the best of your recollection,
dialog: where did the open wound fall?
text: Van Ripper points. Ichabod takes a BOTTLE of WHITE POWDER
text: from his pocket.
text: He uncorks the bottle, cautiously pouring powder in an x on
text: the dirt there, then waiting.
text: A chemical reaction causes the powder to bubble a bit.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: There was not much blood, was there?
speaker_heading: VAN RIPPER
dialog: I didn't see none.
text: Ichabod stands, puzzled. He walks to the coffin cart,
text: rolling up his sleeves. Others come to watch, but keep
text: distance. Ichabod removes the blanket...
text: Reveals Jonathan's headless corpse.
text: Philipse can't look. Ichabod takes strange spectacles from
text: his satchel; wire-framed with many lenses. MAGNIFICATION
text: SPECTACLES. He examines the gross neck wound, sniffs it.
text: He pokes the flesh and severed spinal cord.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: No bleeding.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LANCASTER
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: This should have bled by the pint.
text: Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh.
dialog: How... ? Whatever weapon was used...
dialog: it cauterized somehow....
text: Ichabod straightens, eyes weirdly big in the spectacles.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
text: It instantly burnt the wound shut.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- DAY
text: A coffin in a grave. Headstone reads "MASBATH, 1799." A
text: CROWD gathered. Young Masbath broods. Clergyman Steenwyck
text: steps forward to take a handful of newly dug dirt.
text: Men with guns stand at the outskirts, like on guard.
text: Steenwyck sprinkles dirt into the grave with prayerful words.
text: In the crowd people whisper. They steal glances at Ichabod,
text: who stands with the Van Tassels.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DINING/VARIOUS ROOMS -- DAY
text: Dining room. Sarah and two other servants collect plates. A
text: few people still sup, including Van Ripper, his warty WIFE
text: and two kids. Van Ripper guzzles ale, laughs at something
text: his also-drunk wife says.
text: IN the HALL and FOYER, funeral goers socialize quietly.
text: FURTHER ON, in the SITTING ROOM, men smoke. Young Masbath
text: is confronting Ichabod, who is leaving...
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I am not here for revenge. I am
dialog: here to bring justice.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Whatever. You still need a second
dialog: to tend to your things.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I manage fine alone.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: I deserve to help you. Don't you see
dialog: how much this means? My father...
dialog: he... he was a good man...
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (faces Masbath)
dialog: Young Masbath, I am sorry for your
text: loss. It is a great and sad tragedy.
dialog: However... I cannot be the one to
dialog: look after you now.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: (angry)
dialog: I did not ask you to, did I?
text: Young Masbath exits. Ichabod remains impassive.
scene_heading: EXT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- DAY
text: Ichabod comes out. KILLIAN, a dashingly rustic man, carries
text: his son, THOMAS, 5, and chats with Baltus. Doctor Lancaster
text: peers off at something through a SPYGLASS.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: Hail, Constable. How are you?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Well enough. Your gathering does
dialog: honor to the deceased.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LANCASTER
dialog: (still using spyglass)
dialog: We must be a curious sight to him.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: What are you spying on?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LANCASTER
dialog: (offers the spyglass)
text: The Lenape. He comes to gawk at
dialog: civilization from time to time.
scene_heading: ICHABOD'S POINT OF VIEW -- THROUGH SPYGLASS
text: Searching a line of trees and foliage far away...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LANCASTER (o.s.)
dialog: Do you see the Redskinned bastard?
text: There he is -- the LENAPE. A towering savage with misshapen
text: features covered in tumors. He ducks away.
text: BACK TO SCENE ON PORCH
text: Ichabod lowers the spyglass, a little awed.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
text: He is a behemoth.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LANCASTER
text: A diseased monster.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: If you gentlemen will excuse the
dialog: doctor and I... we have financial
dialog: matters to discuss.
text: Ichabod and Killian nod as Baltus and Lancaster head in.
speaker_heading: KILLIAN
dialog: Master Crane, sir. I'm glad we have
dialog: time alone. You've been told plenty
dialog: about the Horseman, I'm certain.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: More than enough, actually.
dialog: (tired laugh)
dialog: I beg you, no more, please.
speaker_heading: KILLIAN
dialog: No, sir, no. If you ask me, I say
dialog: you just laid eyes on our murderer
dialog: through that glass.
text: Ichabod ponders, folding the spyglass.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Tell me something.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: What becomes of Young Masbath?
speaker_heading: KILLIAN
dialog: Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take
dialog: him. They have children and a good
dialog: home and good land.
text: Ichabod nods. He turns to look THROUGH THE WINDOW. In the
text: DINING ROOM, Van Ripper rises, ill. His wife questions his
text: health, but he holds her off and vomits.
text: Ichabod notes this with a deep sigh.
scene_heading: EXT. VAN TASSEL ORCHARD -- EARLY EVENING
text: Ocher dusk. Ichabod rides to Young Masbath, seated on the
text: ground, miserable. Young Masbath does not look up.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Find yourself a place in the servants'
dialog: residence and wake me before dawn.
dialog: Our first task will be an unsavory one.
text: Ichabod rides. Young Masbath runs to his horse and follows.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- DAWN
text: Steenwyck is on horseback, looking down at Ichabod, furious.
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: It is sacrilege!
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I cannot proceed without examining
dialog: the previous victims.
text: Steenwyck looks to men with shovels. Killian's there.
text: Philipse, hung-over, stands beside Young Masbath.
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: Magistrate Philipse, surely you can
dialog: stop this.
text: Philipse just looks up with a helpless expression.
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: I will not allow it. I will not!
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Protest to my superiors if you like.
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: Your superiors are two days away!
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Then, you should have left two days
dialog: ago, because I have men willing to
dialog: help me today.
text: Ichabod motions. Killian leads the men to the graveyard.
text: Steenwyck watches, enraged. He kicks his horse and rides.
text: Philipse looks worried.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- LATER MORNING (TIME CUT)
text: A PSALM is HEARD READ by STEENWYCK O.S. while a coffin is
text: exhumed. Ichabod guides the lifting. The coffin is put near
text: the headstone "WINDSOR." Ichabod looks...
text: At the church, Steenwyck faces about fifty people who now
text: take up the PRAYER.
text: Across the cemetery, two coffins, one small, one large, are
text: pried open. "VAN GARRETT, 1799." Killian leads the effort
dialog: with Young Masbath's aid...
text: The lids come off, revealing the HEADLESS BODIES of a MAN and
text: a little BOY. Young Masbath backs away.
text: At the "WINDSOR" coffin, nails creak as Ichabod opens the
text: lid. WE DO NOT SEE inside, but when Ichabod does, he is
text: aghast. He looks to the men, angry.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Why was I not told of this?
text: No answer. Killian arrives, nods solemnly.
speaker_heading: KILLIAN
dialog: The Widow Windsor.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Is that all you say? Look at her.
speaker_heading: KILLIAN
dialog: It's not something people speak of
text: openly. She did not remarry.
text: Ichabod kneels, studying. Now, WE SEE: the belly of the
text: headless corpse is bulbous, because the Widow Windsor was
text: very far along in a pregnancy.
text: Ichabod notices: a tear in the cloth of widow's blouse. He
text: reaches through the tear, feeling the stomach.
text: He straightens, greatly troubled.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- MORNING
text: Scissors cut open the widow's blouse. There's an inch-long
text: WOUND on the moldering belly; a sword puncture.
text: Ichabod examines the corpse on a table. Lancaster watches,
text: anxiously mopping his face. Young Masbath's in a corner.
text: Ichabod goes to write in his ledger full of notes.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: What is the common thread between
dialog: these victims?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: I'm sure I don't know.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: We must discover it. The reason the
dialog: murderer chose these persons.
text: Ichabod goes to look at the widow's corpse, pondering.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
text: The wounds are the same. Cauterized.
dialog: No chopping or half-measures either.
dialog: One stroke took the head. Have you
dialog: seen, doctor... ?
dialog: (pointing to it)
dialog: Even the spinal bone... sliced as
dialog: smooth as butter.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LANCASTER
dialog: I do not care. You are welcome to
dialog: use my work area, but I beg you...
text: return her to her resting place.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: In time, doctor. Soon as I finish.
text: Ichabod picks up an iron knife. He looks to Young Masbath.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: You should step outside.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCHYARD CEMETERY -- EARLY EVENING
text: Ichabod and others restore graves. Ichabod looks to the
text: church, where Clergyman Steenwyck stands in the door.
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: The devil sent you, Ichabod Crane.
dialog: The Lord will not forgive your sins.
text: Steenwyck shuts the creaky doors.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod sleeps, dreaming...
scene_heading: ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FARMLAND -- DAY
text: A young BOY, 10, stands in a wheat field with his back to us.
text: A FEMALE VOICE is HEARD FAINTLY, getting LOUDER.
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Ichabod! Ichabod... come along.
text: The boy, YOUNG ICHABOD, turns, smiling. He runs. We FOLLOW
text: to a clearing behind a frontier home. MOTHER waits. Lovely
text: woman. She kisses him.
scene_heading: ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Dark. Young Ichabod, in bed, has one eye open. Across the
text: room, Mother has her back to him. She's WHISPERING something
text: to no one. She turns...
text: Young Ichabod pretends he is asleep.
text: A DRAWER is HEARD SHUTTING. Mother exits. Ichabod gets up,
text: curious, opens a drawer... finds something behind clothing.
text: It's a piece of reed grass, woven into an elaborate pattern
text: with shafts of wheat twisted into the center. Young Ichabod
text: replaces it, closes the drawer.
scene_heading: ICHABOD'S DREAM -- MARKET SQUARE -- DAY
text: A busy, muddy street lined by wares and produce. Young
text: Ichabod walks with FATHER, an emotionless man. Father stops
text: to examine tools. Young Ichabod stays by him, but something
text: captures his attention...
text: Across the way, Mother is involved in a argument with a
text: FREAKISH-LOOKING WOMAN. They shout. People stop to watch.
text: Can't make out words, but Freakish Woman is furious.
scene_heading: ICHABOD'S DREAM -- STORM SKY -- NIGHT
text: LIGHTNING flashes over tree tops. THUNDER BOOMS.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod jerks awake in his bed.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod enters with a lantern and his ledger. He sits,
text: studies notes, then notices there's a light down the hall.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Opposite an elaborate loom, Katrina reads by candlelight.
text: She looks up, seeing Ichabod enter.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Sorry for disturbing you. I thought
text: a forgotten candle was burning.
text: Katrina self-consciously closes her shabby book, puts it with
text: another on her lap and covers them.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: You do not disturb me. Please stay.
dialog: Having trouble sleeping?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: May I ask... why do you cover your
dialog: book that way?
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: You pay great attention to small
dialog: things. I hide these as I hide all
dialog: my books. Father would not approve,
dialog: lest it were the Bible.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I, um... I have something to show you,
dialog: if you have a moment.
text: Ichabod sits, looking through his ledger.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: These are strange... may I?
text: She takes his hand, spreads the fingers to the palm. She
text: touches the many evenly spaced scars.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: These scars. How did you get them?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I have had them since childhood. I
dialog: cannot remember what from.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: It would be interesting to find out.
text: Their eyes meet. Ichabod gets back to the ledger. Katrina
text: seems to relish the effect she has. Ichabod finds a paper
text: disk on string, illustrated thusly:
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
text: Here it is. A bird on one side.
text: His cage on the other. Now,
text: stare at it.
dialog: (spinning it)
text: The bird seems to be in his cage.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Yes, he does. May I try?
text: Ichabod gives it. She spins it, smiling.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
text: He only appears to be inside the
dialog: cage. The point being...
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: You made this, and the drawings?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Yes, but listen. The illusion is
text: easily explained. The eye retains
dialog: each image, till they combine. And
dialog: yet, some would call this toy magic.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Don't you see why? Look closely a
dialog: moment. Put your intellect aside.
dialog: (spinning it)
dialog: Can't you see what is inexplicable?
text: Ichabod watches it spin. He shakes his head, unimpressed.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Oh, you are hopeless. May I keep
dialog: it at least?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: If you want. But...
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Then, I also have a gift for you.
dialog: True magic which even you will not
dialog: be able to deny.
text: She hands him a book. "ROMEO AND JULIET." Ichabod stands,
text: offering it back, but she will not take it.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Thank you. No. Here...
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: I insist that you have it.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (resigned, leaving)
dialog: Very well. But, it will only sit
text: gathering dust.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: That would be a pity. Those words
dialog: might show you something you've never
dialog: seen before.
text: Ichabod stops at the door, looks back. He exits.
scene_heading: EXT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: A light glows in Ichabod's window. LOOKING IN: Ichabod's in
text: bed, fully dressed. He sits up. Pause. He crosses to pick
text: up "Romeo and Juliet." He begins to read.
scene_heading: EXT. PHILIPSE'S FARM -- DUSK
text: Ichabod walks with Philipse. Young Masbath follows with the
text: horses. CICADAS CHATTER from a vast corn field.
speaker_heading: PHILIPSE
dialog: Not more than a year ago, a mob hung
dialog: a man for stealing a horse. For
dialog: stealing a horse! And, you dig up
dialog: our dead.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Are you saying I should be frightened?
dialog: Is this a message passed on from
dialog: Clergyman Steenwyck?
text: The CICADAS SUDDENLY go SILENT. Young Masbath notices.
speaker_heading: PHILIPSE
dialog: We are farmers here, not lawyers or
text: bankers, or even constables. Every
dialog: penny we earn comes from what we
dialog: send down the Hudson.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I know it.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Um.... excuse me, sirs...
speaker_heading: PHILIPSE
dialog: (still to Ichabod)
dialog: Because of the Horseman, our migrant
text: workers flee for their lives. There
dialog: is a danger that our crops will rot.
dialog: So, if you are going to help us, you
dialog: stop the Horseman. That is your
dialog: task... to kill an undead thing.
text: Young Masbath looks to a fenced grazing area, worried. The
text: sheep there are agitated, all running one direction away.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Listen to what you say....
speaker_heading: PHILIPSE
dialog: No, you listen! You may think we are
dialog: a pack of superstitious dullards...
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: At times I do.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Sirs... please!
speaker_heading: PHILIPSE
dialog: What will it take for you to realize
dialog: this is no laughing matter?
text: The horses go crazy, braying and rearing. The reins yank
text: Young Masbath off his feet as the horses flee.
text: Ichabod and Philipse look to Masbath. A SOUND is HEARD,
text: distant: THUNDERING HOOFBEATS. Wind kicks up. HOOFBEATS
text: seem to come FROM ALL DIRECTIONS.
text: Philipse looks to the corn field. A flock of birds alights;
text: a great sheet of black against the sky.
speaker_heading: PHILIPSE
dialog: Oh my... oh my oh my oh my...
text: Philipse runs towards his house, past Masbath. HOOFBEATS are
text: LOUDER, CLOSER. Ichabod faces the corn field.
text: The field explodes open, stalks bending to make way as the
text: Headless Horseman gallops into view atop Daredevil.
text: Young Masbath runs, following Philipse.
text: Ichabod's stunned. He looks down to draw his flintlock
text: pistol, but the Horseman blows by before he can raise it. A
text: blast of air knocks Ichabod off his feet.
text: The Horseman chases Masbath and Philipse.
text: Ichabod follows.
text: The Horseman draws his sword.
text: Young Masbath falls in the grass...
text: Daredevil's pounding hooves will certainly crush him.
text: Daredevil leaps over Young Masbath, continuing the charge.
text: Philipse has a long way to go before home. He looks over his
dialog: shoulder. No way he'll make it.
text: Ichabod, running, watches Philipse slow.
text: Philipse gathers all his courage and stops, turning. The
text: Horseman is closing, sword held high.
text: Philipse raises his talisman.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Philipse!
text: Philipse holds the talisman up, trying to be fearless. The
text: Horseman swings -- WE HEAR the CLANK of sword on talisman...
text: Philipse's severed head spins. His body falls and folds.
text: Ichabod runs past Young Masbath.
text: The Horseman halts just as Ichabod reaches a point in front
text: of dead Philipse, aiming his pistol. Daredevil lets out a
text: SCREECHY CRY. The Horseman rides toward Ichabod.
text: Ichabod gets on one knee, trying to steady his pistol. The
text: Horseman closes. Ichabod sweats bullets. FIRES...
text: The slug SLAMS the Horseman dead center -- bursts through and
text: rends his uniform without slowing him.
text: The Horseman is almost on Ichabod. Ichabod cringes, arms
text: up... as the Horseman passes.
text: The Horseman leans to skewer Philipse's head with his sword.
text: With the head as his prize, the Horseman races away.
text: Ichabod gets up, watches the Horseman head to the forest.
text: Ichabod looks to Young Masbath, finds his legs will not
text: support him, falls, trembling. THUNDER BELLOWS.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT
text: Lady Van Tassel comes to a door, knocks. Sarah stands behind
text: with a tray of food. Young Masbath is seated near.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: (to Young Masbath)
dialog: Has he not come out at all?
text: Young Masbath shakes his head.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: KNOCKING is HEARD. Ichabod sleeps restlessly.
scene_heading: ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: THUNDER BOOMS. WIND and POUNDING RAIN blast open a window.
text: Mother comes to it, then moves to comfort fearful Young
text: Ichabod in bed.
speaker_heading: MOTHER'S VOICE (v.o.)
dialog: Don't be afraid... don't be afraid.
scene_heading: ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY
text: A keyhole. Young Ichabod's eye peers in...
scene_heading: ICHABOD'S DREAM -- P.O.V. THROUGH KEYHOLE
text: Mother is kneeled before flour on the floor. She draws
text: patterns in it, whispering. She blows the flour away.
scene_heading: ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY
text: The Freakish Woman (who argued with Mother) walks towards the
text: home, supported by a SAD MAN. She weeps, carrying something
text: in a blanket.
text: Young Ichabod comes a window, watching, scared.
text: The Freakish Woman is so weak that she falls. The blanket
text: opens... the corpse of an infant tumbles to the dirt. The
text: Freakish Woman's WAILING GROWS LOUDER.
scene_heading: ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FRONT OF YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- NIGHT
text: TWO MEN in black drag Mother to a coach. She looks back,
text: fearful, pulled along. A THIRD MAN in black follows.
text: Young Ichabod struggles as Father restrains him.
speaker_heading: YOUNG ICHABOD
dialog: No... mother... no... !
text: The Third Man peers back, a gray-haired, Cotton Mather-ish
text: man with a villainous face.
speaker_heading: FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.)
dialog: The night of the great storm, I saw
dialog: her cross my windows.
scene_heading: ICHABOD'S DREAM -- COURTROOM -- DAY
text: Many people in the gallery. The Third Man stands in front of
text: the tearful Freakish Woman in the witness box.
speaker_heading: THIRD MAN
dialog: You are certain it was she?
speaker_heading: FREAKISH WOMAN
text: In the lighting, I did see her.
dialog: (points)
dialog: Her. Lady Crane...
text: Mother sits in shackles.
speaker_heading: FREAKISH WOMAN
dialog: I will never forget. The next moment,
dialog: I found my infant dead... with the
text: blood welt on his breast.
text: Those in attendance cry out at this. Ichabod is seated
text: beside Father, eyes filled with tears.
scene_heading: ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: As before, a STORM RAGES. Ichabod is in Mother's arms.
speaker_heading: FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.)
dialog: The night of the great storm, I saw
dialog: her cross my windows.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Don't be afraid...
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- DAY
text: KNOCKING is HEARD. Ichabod gasps awake.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (o.s.)
dialog: Constable Crane?
text: Ichabod looks at his hands balled into fists. He opens them
text: -- has ONE HALF of PHILIPSE'S TALISMAN in each palm.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- NIGHT
text: Katrina holds a tray of food. The DOOR is HEARD UNLOCKING.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Katrina enters. Ichabod sits at his work table.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Are you hungry?
text: Ichabod shakes his head, won't look up. Katrina crosses.
text: She begins picking up pieces of the PLASTER HOOFPRINT CAST
text: which lies shattered on the floor.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: You promised justice.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: If these are the random stalkings of
dialog: a monster, what good am I?
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: People have put their trust in you.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: They have done nothing of the sort.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Won't they still have that justice?
dialog: (patience waning)
dialog: Or, was it a vain promise?
text: Ichabod stews, head in his hands. Someone is HEARD
text: RUNNING... Young Masbath enters, frightened.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Constable Crane... something has
dialog: happened.
scene_heading: EXT. WESTERN WOODS -- DAY
text: The Lenape Indian hangs dead in a tree, lynched. TOWNSFOLK
text: are gathered. Ichabod makes his way through, followed by
text: Young Masbath, looking up.
speaker_heading: BROM (o.s.)
dialog: We do not need you, Constable...
text: Brom strides towards Ichabod from a group of men spreading a
text: sheet under the tree. Van Ripper's there.
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: The men who did this have been taken.
dialog: We do not need you here.
text: Brom points to where TWO FILTHY MEN in chains sit in a
text: horse-drawn cart. An armed man guards them.
speaker_heading: ONE FILTHY MAN
dialog: You should thank us. The killings
dialog: will end. We saved you all!
text: The armed man shoves the filthy man to shut him up.
speaker_heading: BROM
text: They spend two days in chains.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Two days... ? For murder?
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: For poaching. Or, would you remake
dialog: our laws now that Magistrate Philipse
dialog: has given up the ghost?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Does that look like an animal hanging?
speaker_heading: BROM
text: Looks like an Indian.
text: Van Ripper cuts the noose rope at the trunk. The Lenape
text: corpse free falls, landing hard.
text: The Lenape lies in a heap on the sheet. Van Ripper and
text: others come to lift the sheet with the Lenape in the middle.
text: Ichabod watches, noticing...
text: The Lenape wears a WOVEN PIECE of REED GRASS a cord on his
text: loin cloth, twisted in a pattern.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Wait. Give me a moment...
text: Ichabod kneels. He removes the woven piece, looking across
text: the diseased Lenape's body. Something else...
text: The Lenape's mouth is agape; teeth rotting. Ichabod looks
text: around, finds a twig. He uses it to pull the Lenape's mouth
text: open... gets close to peer inside the Lenape's mouth.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- DAY
text: A DRAWING of the Lenape's WOVEN PIECE in Ichabod's ledger.
text: The piece lies near.
text: Ichabod sits staring at it, trance-like. Masbath waits.
dialog: Long silence.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: The Lenape Indian had much to tell
dialog: once I opened his mouth.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: How could he?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
text: His teeth. Someone had cut them and
text: chipped off rotten pieces far back
dialog: in his mouth. The Lenape could not
dialog: have done that for himself.
dialog: (closes his journal)
dialog: Someone out there cared for him.
text: Ichabod rises, deciding. He picks up his satchel and exits.
text: Young Masbath is surprised. He follows.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL -- DAY
text: A massive, wooden WINDMILL, raised off the ground on a 7'
text: center post. Ichabod and Masbath walk to it.
scene_heading: INT. WINDMILL -- DAY
text: Ichabod and Young Masbath enter via a ladder from the
text: underbelly. Gears and counter wheels turn millstones. A few
text: men work in the grain powder filled air.
text: Ichabod leads the way to a staircase, up twists and turns.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Up.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL ROOF -- DAY
text: Ichabod and Young Masbath climb out a door to the roof. The
text: rotors spin nearby. Ichabod searches the countryside.
text: Below, MANY MEN are ride up the long straight road.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: It's payment day. Loan monies are
dialog: given to Baltus the last day each
dialog: month. Almost everyone borrows...
dialog: for tools or to hire workers.
text: Ichabod sits, takes a bowl from his bag and gives it to
text: Masbath, then produces a bottle of water... fills the bowl.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (points)
dialog: Out there. What do you see?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: The Western Woods.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Look again.
text: A plume of smoke rises from woods, far.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
text: Smoke. Chimney smoke.
text: Ichabod holds a piece of straw in his mouth, rubs the point
text: of a sewing needle against a small BLACK ROCK.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Are you familiar with magnets?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: What kind of nuts?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Not for eating, I assure you. Watch
dialog: here.
text: Ichabod shows the magnet grab the needle. Young Masbath is
text: amazed, reaching for it. Ichabod watches him play with it.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: It's spectacular.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (smiles, pause)
dialog: Yes... I suppose it is. Keep it.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: No, I couldn't...
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I have others. All I need is this.
text: Ichabod takes the needle, poking its butt end into the tip of
text: the straw. Young Masbath studies the rock, pockets it.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (nods, almost shy)
dialog: Now, hold the bowl steady. Back to
dialog: business.
text: Young Masbath lifts the bowl. Ichabod drops in the
text: needle/straw which floats and turns compass-like.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: If the Western Woods are truly the
dialog: Devil's Glen, we will see for
dialog: ourselves.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: (uneasy)
dialog: Father said witches live there.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Witches do not exist. However...
text: Ichabod uses a knife to notch the bowl lip where the needle
text: points, then surveys the smoke, making a second notch.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Not long ago, I would have said the
dialog: same for Headless Horseman.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (o.s.)
dialog: Constable... !
text: Katrina's on horseback below, unhappy.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: I need to speak with you. Alone.
scene_heading: EXT. VAN TASSEL GREAT LAWN -- DAY
text: Ichabod and Katrina lead their horses. A heated argument.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Why would you do such a thing?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
text: No stone may be left unturned. It
dialog: may appear harsh...
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: I have misjudged you I think. I did
dialog: not imagine you were so cruel.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: You are not regarding it in full.
dialog: The Widow Windsor had been run
dialog: through by a sword. I followed the
text: bloodless wound, a wound whose path
dialog: I could not comprehend till I had
dialog: seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: What are you on about?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: The child she carried was eight
dialog: months grown at least... near to
text: birthing. The sword had pierced its
dialog: tiny heart exactly.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Must I hear this?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: There was no blind stabbing. This
dialog: singular thrust found its target
text: omnipotently, as if the Horseman made
dialog: certain the unborn child died with
dialog: its mother.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: And this gives worth to butchery?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: It was not butchery.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: What is it then? Scientific method?
dialog: How can any of this matter in the
dialog: slightest?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I have no solution for its meaning
dialog: yet, but I could not just ignore it.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Take a lesson from Young Masbath's
text: desires, Ichabod Crane. He follows
dialog: with you to avenge his father's death.
dialog: That I understand. But, what do you
dialog: want?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
text: To avenge his father, and the others.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: But, why? Tell me why.
text: Ichabod struggles for a reply.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: You falter with your answer because
dialog: you strive without putting the whole
dialog: of your heart into it. Can't you see?
dialog: You'll bring dignity to the dead even
dialog: if you have to chop them into little
dialog: pieces to do it.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (fed up, growing anger)
dialog: If it had been surgery on a living
dialog: person, done to save that person's
dialog: life, you would not question it. Not
dialog: for a moment. So, let me be the first
dialog: to tell you, dear girl... on the other
dialog: side of these sheltering mountains, a
dialog: whole world has advanced beyond such
dialog: plebeian thinking as yours. And
dialog: someday, no matter how much you fear
dialog: it, that world will come to roust
text: Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
text: Katrina storms away. Ichabod's already regretting.
scene_heading: EXT. BELLTOWER FIELD -- DAY
text: Ichabod and Young Masbath ride to the Western Woods, horses
text: loaded for expedition. At the Belltower remnants, Ichabod
text: slows, looking to the wreckage.
text: At forest's edge, Young Masbath waits.
text: Ichabod circles the tower. With a sigh, he rides to join
text: Young Masbath. They head into the woods.
scene_heading: EXT. WESTERN WOODS -- DAY
text: Dark, dense and creepy. Ichabod and Young Masbath move
text: through. Young Masbath halts his horse and looks around.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Listen.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (listens, looks)
dialog: I hear nothing.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: No crickets or cicadas calling. No
dialog: bird songs.
text: Stark quiet. Ichabod notes this unhappily.
scene_heading: EXT. WESTERN WOODS -- LATER DAY
text: Ichabod's hand drops the needle/straw in the water bowl. The
text: needle spins. The bowl is turned to match notches.
text: Ichabod points the way to Young Masbath.
text: ELSEWHERE, SOMEONE WATCHES: A MOVING P.O.V. WATCHES them as
text: they ride, FOLLOWS.
scene_heading: EXT. WESTERN WOODS, FURTHER ON -- LATER DAY
text: Ichabod and Masbath reach a hill crest. They stop, uneasy.
text: Below: a CAVE with a rock archway. An ill-fitting door
text: covers the mouth. The chimney spews smoke.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: We have apparently arrived.
scene_heading: EXT. CAVE HOME -- DAY
text: The horses are tied to a tree. Ichabod walks to the cave
text: door. Unsure, he hesitantly knocks.
scene_heading: INT. CAVE HOME -- DAY
text: Ichabod and Young Masbath step in.
text: Walls are hung with skins and skeletons, dry flowers and reed
text: grass in patterns. An OLD CRONE sits facing away.
text: The old Crone, a mountain woman with matted hair and grey
text: features, sits disinterested. Ichabod edges closer.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Pardon. You did not answer when I
dialog: knocked. Are we intruding?
speaker_heading: OLD CRONE
dialog: You are from the Hollow?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: In a way, yes.
text: Ichabod looks at tables of gourd bowls of dead insects and
text: acorns. Knifes, scissors, yellow bones. He takes the
text: Lenape's piece of reed grass from his pocket.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: The Lenape who lived in these woods...
dialog: do you know him? The Redman?
dialog: (uncomfortable wait)
dialog: I should tell you... he has been
dialog: murdered.
speaker_heading: OLD CRONE
dialog: Leave me. You are not welcome here.
text: The old Crone places something on a table beside her -- a
text: dead cardinal, bright red.
text: Ichabod is afraid, backing away, but Young Masbath takes the
text: woven piece and steps to the Crone.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Were you a friend to the Indian?
dialog: (waits)
dialog: You should have this... if you were
dialog: his friend.
text: Young Masbath puts the woven piece beside the cardinal. He
text: walks to join Ichabod in leaving.
speaker_heading: OLD CRONE
dialog: You seek remedy against the Horseman?
text: The Old Crone reaches to pick up the weaving. She stands,
text: faces them. Tall. Ichabod nods.
speaker_heading: OLD CRONE
dialog: (to Young Masbath)
dialog: Go out and keep away, child.
dialog: (to Ichabod)
dialog: You stay. Follow with me.
text: The Old Crone takes a candle and walks, deep into the cave.
scene_heading: INT. CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY
text: The Old Crone comes through a passage in the wet walls.
text: Ichabod enters, scared, bent under low ceiling.
speaker_heading: OLD CRONE
text: I hear him. He rides to the Hollow
dialog: and back.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: The Horseman. Yes.
speaker_heading: OLD CRONE
dialog: Sit.
text: Ichabod sits on crooked stool. The old Crone kneels with her
text: back to him, gathers straw in a pile on the floor.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Can you help?
speaker_heading: OLD CRONE
dialog: You want to see into the nether world...
dialog: I can show you. Whatever you see, do
dialog: not move or speak. I will hold him.
text: She gathers bowls, putting grass and powder on the pile.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: What... what are you doing?
speaker_heading: OLD CRONE
dialog: (turns, furious)
dialog: Close your mouth! Keep silent.
text: She takes two jars from a table, pours ashes on the pile from
text: one. She shakes the other roughly, takes the lid off and
text: upends it. A baby bat squirms on the floor, dazed.
text: The Old Crone holds the bat, using a knife to cut off its
text: head. She soaks the straw with blood, SPEAKING IN TONGUES,
text: guttural. Using a wick, she lights the straw.
text: She grasps two METAL CUFFS with chains attached, slides these
text: onto her bony wrists, then bends to inhale smoke.
speaker_heading: OLD CRONE
text: He comes now.
dialog: Ichabod would like to leave now.
scene_heading: EXT. CAVE HOME -- DAY
text: Young Masbath, waiting by the horses, looks up. Through the
text: trees, black clouds billow and block the sun.
scene_heading: INT. CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY
text: The old Crone slumps, still with her back to Ichabod. She
text: does not move. Wind howls through a hole/window. Rain.
text: Candles blow out. Ichabod stands, worried.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Excuse me... um...
text: She remains motionless. The STORM outside intensifies.
text: WE SEE the skin of the Crone's wrists transform; swelling in
text: the cuffs, hardening, cracking and bleeding.
text: Some thing Ichabod cannot see. He inches closer.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Are you alright... ?
text: The Crone turns, hideous, leaping erect -- a half-human,
text: half-demon CREATURE. Its black clawed hands reaching.
text: Ichabod recoils, crying out.
text: Chains on restraining cuffs yank the creature back.
text: Ichabod hits the floor, knocking over a table of bones. The
text: creature is chained, but still wants Ichabod. It SCREECHES.
text: The Old Crone's face seethes from transformation, eyes blood
text: red, nostrils dripping, teeth now jagged.
speaker_heading: CREATURE/OLD CRONE
dialog: You seek the warrior bathed in
dialog: blood... the Headless Horseman.
text: Ichabod slides back as far as possible while the creature
text: claws the rock floor, yearning.
speaker_heading: CREATURE/OLD CRONE
dialog: Follow the Indian trail to where the
text: sun dies. Follow to the tree of the
dialog: dead.
text: The creature pulls, testing the chains. Behind, the BOLT
text: holding the chains to the wall slips. The wall cracks.
speaker_heading: CREATURE/OLD CRONE
text: Climb down to the Horseman's soulless
text: place and let loose his silent
text: shrieking. Do you hear? Do you hear?!
text: Ichabod nods, quaking, aghast. He glances to the exit.
text: The chain bolt gives more... coming loose...
speaker_heading: CREATURE/OLD CRONE
text: He who holds fast the Horseman's
dialog: desire will guide his reaping hand.
text: Catch hold of his desire.
text: Ichabod bolts for the door. The creature HOWLS, leaping...
text: The chain bolt breaks...
text: Ichabod cries out, tackled to the floor...
text: It is the Old Crone who landed on him. She has returned to
text: human form, semi-conscious. Ichabod shoves her off.
scene_heading: EXT. CAVE HOME -- DAY
text: Ichabod runs out into the howling storm, past Masbath.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: We are leaving.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: What happened?
text: Ichabod scrambles onto Gunpowder, heading further into the
text: woods, glancing back. Young Masbath follows.
scene_heading: EXT. WESTERN WOODS, FURTHER ON -- EARLY EVENING
text: No rain. Dark. A lantern's glow creates shifting shadows as
text: Ichabod and Young Masbath ride.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Follow the Indian trail to where the
text: sun dies. To the tree of the dead.
dialog: (looking back)
dialog: Maybe we passed it by.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: How could something named "the tree
dialog: of the dead" fail to draw attention?
text: A BIRD CRIES OUT. Ichabod's startled, looking up. The BIRD
text: is HEARD ALIGHTING. Leaves float downwards.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: We should not go much further in
dialog: this murk.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Should we go back?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: We are far from the Hollow.
dialog: (dismounts, troubled)
dialog: Loath to say it... better to get our
text: backs against a tree and stay till
dialog: morning.
scene_heading: EXT. WESTERN WOODS (TIME CUT) -- NIGHT
text: Horses are tied. Ichabod is seated against a tree. A
text: campfire burns. Young Masbath lies on a blanket, rifle cross
text: his chest, staring to treetops.
text: Leaves and branches shift in the wind. Bats fly wildly.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: What does it mean... climb down to
dialog: the Horseman's soulless place?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
text: "Let loose his silent shrieking."
dialog: Who knows, till we work at it? I
dialog: admit not being anxious to find out.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: "He who holds the Horseman's desire
dialog: will guide his reaping hand."
dialog: Whatever the Horseman's desire is,
dialog: other than extinguishing lives.
text: A SNAPPING BRANCH. Ichabod raises his pistol.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (to Young Masbath)
dialog: Do not move.
text: Ichabod rises. He creeps forward, pistol and lantern
text: forward. Foliage is thick. CRUNCHING LEAVES are HEARD.
text: Ichabod crouches, puts down the lantern and picks up a
text: branch. He tosses the branch to the foliage...
text: SOME ANIMAL darts away, a running blur.
text: Ichabod rises, following with his pistol.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE, MOVING P.O.V.: low to the ground,
text: moving swiftly at Ichabod...
text: Ichabod spins, blindsided.
text: Young Masbath fires his rifle -- CRACK!!
text: The ANIMAL is KNOCKED DOWN mid-leap, yelping...
text: The beast lands, a mass of grey fur.
text: Ichabod comes to stare down. Young Masbath arrives. They
text: both look to the beast, horrified.
text: The creature lies helplessly spastic; a TWO-HEADED WOLF, with
text: one head blown open to brain and gore. Its living head
text: lifts, MEWING sadly, eyes pleading.
text: Ichabod step up with pistol. FIRES. MEWING STOPS.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: What God-forsaken hell is this?
text: Ichabod swallows back sickness, looking away. Something
text: catches his eye.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Christ...
text: Through the forest: the SKY'S LIT UP. Distant fire.
scene_heading: EXT. WESTERN WOODS, CAVE HOME -- EARLY EVENING
text: Ichabod and Masbath ride up, confronted by the Crone's cave
text: vomiting flame out all orifices.
text: Ichabod approaches. Embers swirl everywhere. The Old
text: Crone's body lies amongst bloodied leaves. Headless.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE, DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT
text: Much commotion. A MOB in front of the home marked
text: "LANCASTER, PHYSICIAN." Steenwyck addresses the rabble.
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: You all stand idle, while this man
text: goes about with a book of secrets and
dialog: a bag filled with magic. You all
text: stand idle, while the shadow of the
dialog: Devil falls over our town.
text: Baltus, Lady Van Tassel and Katrina watch at safe distance.
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: I say, if you do nothing, you share
dialog: in the blasphemy of Ichabod Crane!
text: Killian, on horseback beside his wife, BETH, and son, Thomas,
text: rides to one side of the shouting crowd.
speaker_heading: KILLIAN
dialog: Listen to me! Do you want to save
dialog: your crops? Or would you rather see
dialog: your farms go to ruin?
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: How is he saving our farms? How?
dialog: Ichabod Crane has brought into our
text: midst the soulless, moldering corpse
dialog: of a heretic!
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod examines the Crone's neck wound with magnification
text: spectacles. Young Masbath is seated, ledger in his lap.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: The wound is neither smooth nor
text: cauterized, but jagged. She bleeds
text: like a fountain.
text: Ichabod lifts her dead hand to show bruises and cuts.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: She did not go quietly.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, PARLOR -- NIGHT
text: Doctor Lancaster wrings his hands. His WIFE rocks nervously
text: in a rocking chair. The CROWD outside ROARS as a bonfire
text: lights up the curtained windows.
text: The front door is POUNDED open. ANGRY MEN enter. Lancaster
text: stands, lips quivering. He points insistently to a door.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Angry men break in. Ichabod looks up.
speaker_heading: ANGRY MAN
dialog: Step aside, Constable. Step aside...
text: Ichabod is shoved aside, spectacles knocked off.
text: The group grasps the Crone. Masbath stands on his chair,
text: clutching the ledger. Ichabod grabs one man.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: What are you doing?
text: The man slams Ichabod back.
text: Magnification spectacles are crushed under foot.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT
text: Angry men carry the corpse to a raging bonfire. The mob
text: makes way. Steenwyck cheers them.
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: Let her burn! Let her burn!
text: Ichabod comes out, followed by Young Masbath. The Crone's
text: corpse is thrown in the fire. Cheers all around.
text: At Ichabod's side, a man tries to grab the ledger Young
text: Masbath holds. Young Masbath cries out, hanging on to the
text: book. Ichabod joins the struggle.
text: Katrina watches, emotions conflicting.
text: Other men grab Ichabod. One punches Ichabod in the face.
text: Katrina rides forward as Baltus calls for her to stop.
text: Katrina leaps down, into the crowd, pulls men off Ichabod.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Stop this! Leave them alone!
text: A SHOT RINGS OUT. Chaos halts. Everyone turns, quieting.
text: The men around Masbath and Ichabod turn to face Brom Bones.
text: Brom holds a smoking pistol, flanked by Theodore and Glenn.
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: Let them go
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Are you going to beat an orphaned
dialog: child, imbecile?
text: Masbath is released, along with the ledger. Steenwyck moves
text: forward, pushing people aside.
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: Are you Ichabod Crane's protector,
dialog: Brom Bones?
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: Only for the moment.
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: You side with him in this?
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: No. I agree he has only made matters
dialog: worse. But, that will change, if you
dialog: listen.
text: He trades with Theodore, pistol for a long rifle. Brom hefts
text: the rifle, taking a round slug from his pocket.
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: Theodore, Glenn and I offer to ride
dialog: each day and night to watch over the
dialog: Hollow. We will stalk the border of
dialog: the Western Woods and haunt the
text: Horseman for a change, with rifles
dialog: like this... and slugs like this...
text: Brom brings the slug to his lips, blows. It WHISTLES.
speaker_heading: BROM
text: Hollowed out and filled with powder.
text: Brom smiles at Katrina, who watches unimpressed.
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: Constable Crane is not the only one
text: who fights with science on his side.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I fired upon the Horseman and the
dialog: bullet did nothing.
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: You must have missed your mark.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I hit him square.
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: (to the crowd)
dialog: I say... if the Horseman is solid
dialog: enough to take the lives of our
dialog: people, he's solid enough to feel
dialog: this...
text: Brom aims the rifle at a BARREL down the road. FIRES.
text: PLUNK -- the barrel is hit -- EXPLODES. Smoke wafts.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: In bed, Ichabod is having unpleasant dreams once more.
speaker_heading: FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.)
dialog: The night of the great storm, I saw
dialog: her cross my windows.
scene_heading: ICHABOD'S DREAM -- COURTROOM -- DAY
text: Young Ichabod is seated beside Father, eyes tearful. We are
text: back in the court where Mother stands trial.
speaker_heading: FREAKISH WOMAN
dialog: In the lightning, I did see her.
dialog: (points to Mother)
dialog: Her. Lady Crane... I will never
dialog: forget it. The next moment, I found
dialog: my infant son was dead, with the
text: blood welt on his breast.
text: The evil Third Man turns to a jury of TWELVE MEN.
speaker_heading: THIRD MAN
dialog: You have heard it. The blood welt
dialog: is the mark of Satan's touch.
text: As the crowd murmurs in fear, Young Ichabod looks to Father,
text: who sits with hands clenched, emotionless.
scene_heading: ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- NIGHT
text: In the quiet kitchen, Young Ichabod looks across the table.
text: Father stares into his food.
speaker_heading: YOUNG ICHABOD
dialog: She was with me, father.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Nothing can be done against them.
speaker_heading: YOUNG ICHABOD
dialog: She was with me that night.
text: Father doesn't even look up.
scene_heading: ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH -- NIGHT
text: Empty church. Young Ichabod carries a lantern past pews. A
text: soldier is seated near the altar with a rifle.
speaker_heading: YOUNG ICHABOD
dialog: May I see her?
text: The soldier exits through a white door. Young Ichabod waits,
text: looking up at the vast church. The white door opens and the
text: Third Man steps out.
speaker_heading: THIRD MAN
dialog: Go home.
speaker_heading: YOUNG ICHABOD
dialog: May I see my mother?
speaker_heading: THIRD MAN
dialog: You do not want to be here. Go home
dialog: to your father.
speaker_heading: YOUNG ICHABOD
dialog: She did not do it... please listen...
speaker_heading: THIRD MAN
text: She is guilty.
speaker_heading: YOUNG ICHABOD
dialog: No, sir, please... she is innocent...
speaker_heading: THIRD MAN
dialog: She has confessed.
speaker_heading: YOUNG ICHABOD
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: THIRD MAN
dialog: She has admitted to her evil and
dialog: signed a written confession. Do
dialog: you know what confession is?
dialog: (off Ichabod's nod)
dialog: All that is left for you now is to
dialog: pray for her soul.
text: The Third Man leaves through the white door.
scene_heading: ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- MORNING
text: Young Ichabod buttons his shirt.
scene_heading: ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S YARD -- MORNING
text: Young Ichabod comes out, looks to the lawn, not
text: understanding. Father loads a wagon full of belongings.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: We are leaving.
dialog: (long pause)
text: She has gone away.
text: Realization comes to Young Ichabod. He runs, away across the
text: lawn as Father calls after him.
scene_heading: ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FOREST TRAIL -- MORNING
text: Young Ichabod runs, weeping.
speaker_heading: THIRD MAN (v.o.)
dialog: She has confessed.
scene_heading: ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH -- MORNING
text: Empty. Doors are thrown open and Young Ichabod enters. He
text: goes down the aisle, towards the white door.
speaker_heading: THIRD MAN (v.o.)
dialog: She has admitted to her evil and
dialog: signed a written confession.
speaker_heading: YOUNG ICHABOD
dialog: Mother.
scene_heading: ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH, BEYOND WHITE DOOR -- MORNING
text: Young Ichabod enters, halting. The room contains TORTURE
text: DEVICES: iron cuffs, thumb screws, knifes and needles.
speaker_heading: THIRD MAN (v.o.)
dialog: Do you know what confession is?
text: He walks, numb, eyes locked forward...
text: In the corner is a SPIKED CHAIR, adorned with sharp iron
text: spikes. Hundreds of spikes. It is fitted with straps for
dialog: holding down the "accused."
text: Tears stream down Young Ichabod's face. He kneels, hands on
text: the spikes of the chair, pressing hard.
text: As he sobs, blood runs down from his hands.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: In bed, Ichabod opens tear filled eyes. He sits up, bringing
text: his trembling hands to wipe his cheeks. His hands trail
text: blood. He looks to them...
text: The old scars are bleeding.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Katrina comes to the door. Ichabod is seated by the fire,
text: eyes bleary, palms wrapped with bloodied cloth.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Constable Crane?
text: Katrina comes beside Ichabod's chair.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Allow me some time. I have spent
text: every hour in the company of others.
dialog: I need to be alone.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: What troubles you?
text: She moves in front. Ichabod gets up and crosses to sit
text: facing away. Katrina takes the chair he deserted.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: The things I said to you before...
dialog: I was wrong to say them.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: No, actually, you were not. Every
dialog: word you spoke had truth in it.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: What has happened?
text: Ichabod sits silent, puts his head back, eyes closed.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Lady Van Tassel... she is your
dialog: stepmother, isn't she? She bears so
dialog: little resemblance.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: She is not your birth mother, is she?
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: No, but... why do you ask that?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: What happened to your mother? Is she
dialog: still alive?
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: She died. Her lungs were diseased...
dialog: two years ago. What is this about?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Memories have come back. I had them
dialog: forgotten, and wish I could forget
dialog: them again... but they are here now.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Lord, how I hate this place.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: If you want me to go, I will. Do you
dialog: want me to leave?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I... I do not know. I no longer know
dialog: what I think or what I feel.
text: Katrina walks to him. She touches his back.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Why are you so afraid of that? Is
dialog: there truly such harm in uncertainty?
text: She kneels, smiles a little for him. She reaches to touch
text: his face, holds his head in her hands. Leans to kiss him.
text: He rests his head against hers, weary, putting his arms
text: around her. They kiss passionately.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HOLLOW -- EARLY MORNING
text: Dawn light, is visible over forests pounded by rain.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALL -- MORNING
text: Ichabod exits his room, satchel in hand. He looks down the
text: hall, then steps back in to take a white rose from a vase.
text: AROUND A CORNER, Ichabod comes to the last door. He bends,
text: slipping the white rose under the crack of the door.
scene_heading: EXT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- MORNING
text: Rain. Ichabod comes out. Across the lawn, Young Masbath is
text: bringing the horses.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL (o.s.)
dialog: Good morrow, Constable.
text: Ichabod turns to see Lady Van Tassel in a chair, sewing.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: Returning to the Western Woods?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Yes, actually.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: Use caution.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (nods, studies her)
dialog: Do you know... I think those are the
dialog: first words I have heard from you my
dialog: entire time here.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: As my husband says, a wife should be
text: always like an echo, and at the same
text: time, quite unlike an echo.
dialog: (off Ichabod's confusion)
text: Like an echo, she should speak only
dialog: when spoken to, and unlike an echo,
dialog: should never try to have the last
dialog: word, or, at least that is what he
dialog: believes.
text: Baltus comes out the door, irritable, skillet in hand.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: Constable... did you notice anything
dialog: out of the ordinary during the night?
text: Ichabod eyes the skillet, ill at ease, trying not to be.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Um... I... I did not... no. Why?
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: Sarah has gone missing... my servant
dialog: girl. Her things are gone. Damn it.
dialog: She has joined the migration out of
dialog: town.
dialog: (to Lady Van Tassel)
dialog: What about breakfast, woman? Or, am
dialog: I to starve to death?
text: Lady Van Tassel gets up and goes in, taking the skillet.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I should be going... good day to you.
text: Ichabod heads towards Young Masbath. Baltus watches from the
text: porch, disgruntled. He goes in.
scene_heading: EXT. WESTERN WOODS -- DAY
text: Heavy rain. Ichabod and Young Masbath ride side by side.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: If the Crone's wound bled hard, that
dialog: means she was not killed by the
dialog: Hessian. Someone only tried to make
dialog: it look that way.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: You grow sharper by the minute, little
dialog: man. It boggles my mind, but I begin
dialog: to prefer your company over all others.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Well... I'm one of the few people who
dialog: likes you.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: True enough.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Then, who murdered the Old Crone? And
dialog: why?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Good questions, deserving answers, of
dialog: which we are in short supply.
text: A SOUND is HEARD. Ichabod looks back, then to Masbath.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
text: Quicken pace.
text: Ichabod rides faster. Young Masbath keeps up.
text: FURTHER ON, they charge over a hill. Ichabod halts Gunpowder
text: and climbs clumsily off.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Ride on.
text: Young Masbath obeys. Ichabod takes out his pistol and wades
text: into forest growth, backtracking.
text: INSIDE THE FOREST, Ichabod bounds through underbrush, low. A
text: HORSE is HEARD SNORTING. He pushes through branches...
text: Moving behind a FIGURE IN A GREY CLOAK on horseback.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Halt and turn. I have a pistol aimed
dialog: at your head.
text: The figure stops, pushes off the cloak hood. Katrina.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: It is only me.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Katrina. Why do you follow?
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: I apologize if I worried you.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: A woman should not be out alone in
dialog: these woods.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: But, I am not alone, am I? I only
dialog: wished to see what you were up to,
dialog: and...
dialog: (takes out WHITE ROSE)
dialog: To thank you.
text: Ichabod softens, but doesn't want to.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Come along.
scene_heading: EXT. WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- DAY
text: Raining still. Ichabod, Masbath and Katrina come into a
text: clearing, mouths falling open at the sight of...
text: A monstrously huge TREE OF THE DEAD, at the clearing's
text: center, with branches reaching far and wide, knotted and
text: gross, like agony captured in wood sculpture.
text: Ichabod dismounts, crossing a line beyond which grass and
text: weeds will not grow. Young Masbath and Katrina dismount.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: You were right... it does draw
text: attention to itself.
text: Ichabod stares up into the endless, dead canopy of branches.
text: He circles the incredibly wide trunk.
text: There's a VERTICAL WOUND in the bark, as if the tree once had
text: a terrible vertical in it, now partially healed and
text: disgustingly scarred. Ichabod approaches.
text: He feels the mushy scar, picking at its scabs till much sap
text: begins to trickle. It is red and Ichabod fingers it.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Blood.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: What did you say?
text: Ichabod goes to where Katrina and Masbath wait with the
text: horses, digs in a saddle bag for a hand axe.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Stay back.
text: At the trunk, Ichabod thumps the flat end of the axe against
text: the suture. It sounds hollow. Ichabod begins to chop.
text: He pulls away loose bark. The tree drips more blood and a
text: clear goo. Ichabod uses both hands on the axe to hack at the
text: festering suture.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Just... keep where you are.
text: Ignoring, Young Masbath moves closer. Ichabod keeps
text: chopping, then grips a large, loose flap of wood, trying to
text: bend it. It's not easy. Ichabod struggles.
text: Katrina follows Masbath's slow advance.
text: Ichabod's pulling... the flap suddenly gives, revealing a
text: blood-soaked, wide-eyed, gap-mouthed HUMAN HEAD.
text: Ichabod recoils. Behind him, Katrina stifles a scream,
text: taking Young Masbath in her arms to keep him from looking.
text: It is Philipse's head, hanging off the trunk flap, held by
text: roots grown around and into the flesh.
text: Ichabod reapproaches, back of his hand to his mouth.
text: FOUR other SEVERED, DECAYING HEADS are held by ingrown roots
text: within the dewy innards.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: My God... what has happened?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: He... he tries to take the heads...
dialog: they will not pass.
text: He looks to the branches towering above.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Must be some sort of gateway. But,
dialog: why this place... ?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: We should go.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Why this tree?
text: Ichabod begins looking at the ground, moving around the tree.
text: He gets to his knees, pushing mud away.
text: Uncovering a flush HEADSTONE carved with "666."
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: "Climb down to the Horseman's
dialog: soulless place."
dialog: (to Masbath)
dialog: Bring the shovel.
scene_heading: EXT. WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- LATER DAY
text: Rain. Young Masbath's crouched, muddy, rifle across his
text: knees. He's watching the tree.
text: Behind him, Katrina climbs out of the shallow grave near a
text: pile of mud. Ichabod hands up the shovel.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Masbath, we've found it.
text: Young Masbath goes to the grave. Ichabod pulls at thick
text: burlap cloth, straining as it comes away.
text: Ichabod looks down, disbelieving.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: It cannot be true.
text: WE SEE: roots have gripped the Horseman's bones and tattered
text: uniform. The skeleton is all there -- except the skull.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Why is it every grave I open holds
dialog: a new mystery inside?
speaker_heading: KATRINA
text: The skull is gone.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Yes. I did notice that, thank you.
text: Ichabod climbs out, weary in body and spirit. LIGHTNING.
text: THUNDER. He stares at the bones.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
text: This is his silent shrieking... and
text: his desire, to reclaim his head.
text: Ichabod turns, looking to the bordering forest.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: "He who holds fast the Horseman's
dialog: desire will guide his reaping hand."
dialog: (pause)
text: Someone controls the Horseman.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (o.s.)
dialog: Ichabod!
text: Ichabod turns, looks...
text: Katrina and Young Masbath back away, because the ROOTS in the
text: grave are ALIVE, further entwining around remains.
text: Ichabod spins to the twisted tree...
text: The vertical SUTURE SEETHES, pulling inwards... sucking
text: Philipse's head back in and closing, bubbling.
text: Ichabod bounds over grave dirt pile, hastening Katrina and
text: Young Masbath along as he flees.
text: At the tree, the suture swells.
text: Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath pass where their freaking
text: horses are tied to a fallen trunk, heading for cover.
text: A RUMBLING is HEARD from the twisted tree, which suddenly
text: BURSTS wide, spitting smoldering cinders.
text: At the tree line, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath cower,
text: looking back.
text: From the tree wound, a glow brightens, till the Headless
text: Horseman and Daredevil EXPLODE into existence...
text: They hit the ground running.
text: Ichabod watches the Horseman ride away with bolts of
text: LIGHTNING STRIKING the GROUND BEHIND.
text: The Horseman disappears in the forest.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: His next victim is chosen!
dialog: (to Masbath)
dialog: Give me distance, then guide her
text: back to the Hollow.
text: Ichabod runs towards the horses.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Constable!
scene_heading: EXT. WESTERN WOODS -- DAY
text: The Horseman rips past on Daredevil.
scene_heading: EXT. BEHIND IN WESTERN WOODS -- DAY
text: Ichabod rides as fast as Gunpowder is able.
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY
text: Small home. Killian, Thomas and Beth have finished supper.
text: Beth clears plates as Killian picks his teeth with a knife.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: May I be excused, father?
speaker_heading: KILLIAN
dialog: Do you deserve to be?
speaker_heading: THIRD MAN
dialog: (shyly)
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: KILLIAN
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Then, go.
text: Thomas gets down from his chair. He goes to the fireplace to
text: light a tallow wick, which he takes to the next room.
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY
text: Thomas plops on the floor and lights his MAGIC LANTERN: a
text: lantern with an outer sleeve of glass painted with
text: silhouettes of lions and monsters.
text: Thomas turns the lantern and looks to the walls where the
text: creatures, shadows are thrown. He roars for them, imagining
dialog: them real and having a grand time.
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY
text: Beth comes for more dishes.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Don't pick teeth. You teach Thomas
dialog: bad habits.
text: Killian pulls her to him, playful.
speaker_heading: KILLIAN
dialog: I am a bad habit. There's nothing
dialog: for it.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (kisses him)
dialog: No one knows better than I.
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY
text: Thomas continues his fun, shadow animals circling him.
text: In the shifting light, a baby spider comes from a crack in
text: the wall. Then, another spider skitters out. More follow.
scene_heading: EXT. FORESTS -- DAY
text: A black horse runs, hooves pounding the ground. THUNDER is
text: HEARD. The horse slows and stops... it is Brom's horse, with
text: Brom aboard. Brom looks skyward.
text: The storm harshens, roaring through the trees. Distant
text: HOOFBEATS can be HEARD. POUNDING.
text: Brom takes his rifle off his shoulder. The HOOFBEATS grow
text: LOUDER and PASS, far away. Brom turns in the saddle and
text: WHISTLES. He kicks his horse and rides.
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY
text: Thomas still watches shadow beasts, but sees something else.
text: He goes to the crack where hundreds of spiders flee all
text: directions. Thomas is amused.
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY
text: Behind Killian, mantelpiece stones pulse, breathing almost
text: imperceptibly. Demonic faces form, then disappear and reform
text: again, shifting. WIND HOWLS.
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY
text: Beth enters, looking at Thomas.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What are you doing there?
text: The magic lantern stops spinning. Shadow creatures freeze.
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY
text: The ENTIRE HOUSE CREAKS. Killian looks up. CREAKING STOPS.
text: The HOWLING WIND is LOUD.
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY
text: Beth comes to Thomas' side as he points.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Spiders.
text: Beth bends to see the swarming spiders. She looks up,
text: noticing the FEROCITY of the WIND.
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY
text: Killian stands, looking up. The HOUSE CREAKS again, then
text: suddenly the WIND CEASES. Silence.
speaker_heading: KILLIAN
dialog: Beth...
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY
text: Beth picks up Thomas. The magic lantern creatures begin
text: spinning anew, all around.
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY
text: With a ROAR, the fire flares. Killian looks.
text: WHHOOOSH the fire shoots up the fireplace. Gone.
text: Behind Killian, the DOOR SPLINTERS INWARDS. The Horseman
text: steps in, a battle axe in each hand. WIND BLASTS...
text: The DOOR to the other room SLAMS.
text: Killian grabs a kitchen chair and hurls it at the Horseman.
text: The Horseman swings, smashing it aside.
speaker_heading: KILLIAN
dialog: Beth... run!
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY
text: Beth hugs Thomas to her as she backs away.
speaker_heading: KILLIAN (o.s.)
dialog: (from kitchen)
dialog: Get out!
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY
text: Killian grabs an iron skewer from the fireplace, swings it to
text: fend off a blow from the Horseman.
text: The Horseman swings the other axe. Killian ducks. The axe
text: cracks fireplace stone, throwing sparks.
text: Killian lunges, jamming the skewer into the Horseman.
text: The skewer comes through the Horseman's back. The Horseman
text: swipes with the flat of one axe -- pounding Killian aside.
text: Killian hits the wall, bashing his head. Hits the floor.
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY
text: Beth kicks a carpet to reveal a trap door.
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY
text: The Horseman pulls the skewer out of his body, throws it. He
text: goes to lift Killian by the hair with one hand, brings back
dialog: the axe in the other...
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY
text: At the trap door, Beth lowers Thomas to stairs leading to the
text: cellar. Thomas is crying.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Don't let him get you.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Mommy...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You hide now... go...
text: Beth closes the trap door, frantically replacing the carpet.
text: The room's door flies open and the Horseman strides in,
text: carrying Killian's severed head. Beth shrieks.
text: The Horseman steps forward, knocks over the magic lantern.
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY
text: Beth's SCREAMS are abruptly CUT OFF. Her BODY is HEARD
text: HITTING the floor above. Thomas crosses the cellar,
text: stumbles. He scurries into the shelter of a wheelbarrow
text: propped against the wall. FOOTSTEPS are HEARD.
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY
text: The Horseman's hands place Killian's and Beth's heads in a
text: sack, cinching the sack shut.
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY
text: The Headless Horseman enters, bends to retrieve the battle
text: axe he left. He stands. Pause.
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY
text: Thomas' trembling hands pull the wheelbarrow closer. QUIET.
text: He tries to control his sobbing.
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY
text: The Horseman turns, falls to his knees. He starts to chop at
text: the floor with both axes. CHOPping, CHOPping, CHOPping...
dialog: making quick work of it...
scene_heading: INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY
text: A hole appears in the ceiling as debris falls.
text: Thomas looks up, terrified. He gets up to run away...
text: The Horseman's arm shoves through above, grasping Thomas and
text: yanking him up.
scene_heading: EXT. KILLIAN'S FARM -- DAY
text: Brom rides from the forest, charging across Killian's field.
text: At Killian's house, Daredevil rides up as the Headless
text: Horseman walks out with his sack of heads. The Horseman ties
text: the sack to the saddle and leaps up.
text: Brom puts his reins in his mouth, raising his rifle.
text: The Horseman heads away, past the barn, as Brom gains.
dialog: Brom aims... FIRES!
text: BOOM -- the slug EXPLODES, blowing the Horseman off
text: Daredevil. Daredevil keeps going. The Horseman's smoldering
text: body is left "face down."
text: Brom halts his horse. He climbs down, pleased.
text: The Horseman moves.
text: Brom backs away, satisfaction diminishing.
text: The Horseman gets on his knees.
text: Brom falls to one knee, begins reloading. He fills the gun
text: from his powder horn.
text: The Horseman stands, unsheathes his sword and turns. The
text: blast has blown apart his uniform at the chest and shoulder,
text: exposing rotten flesh and maggot-infested muscle.
text: Brom readies his ramrod, jamming powder in the barrel.
text: The Horseman charges.
text: Brom stands, pulling out the ramrod. The Horseman is on him.
text: Brom swings the rifle, blocking. Sparks fly.
text: The battle is on, with Brom fending off the Horseman's sword
text: with the gun -- CLANK -- CLANK -- CLANK.
text: ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod and Gunpowder break into the open.
text: UP THE FIELD, the Horseman makes a backhanded swing. Brom
text: goes down, his rifle sent flying.
text: Brom rolls to avoid as the Horseman slashes.
text: Brom flees. The Horseman pulls and throws a knife...
text: THWAP -- the knife imbeds in Brom's thigh.
text: The Horseman runs towards Brom.
text: Ichabod closes in, pulling an unlit lantern off his saddle.
text: Brom tries to get up, bends to extract the knife.
text: The Horseman, mid-run, changes his sword grip, blade down.
text: He plants one foot on Brom's back, raising his sword, about
dialog: to skewer...
text: Ichabod arrives full gallop, SMASHES the lantern into the
text: Horseman -- knocking the Horseman off Brom.
text: AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST, Theodore and Glen arrive on
text: horseback. They hold a moment, watching.
text: Brom runs, limping, to the barn, goal in sight: farm
text: implements propped there. Brom grabs SCYTHES with long
text: curved blades, one in per hand.
text: The Horseman rises.
text: Ichabod turns Gunpowder and leaps off, runs to Brom.
text: The Horseman moves towards them, hefting a battle axe in his
text: free hand. Ichabod steps up, pistol aimed, furious.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: For what it's worth...
text: FIRES -- the bullet rips through the Horseman's stomach to
text: reveal putrid innards as he keeps advancing.
text: At the forest, Theodore looks to Glenn, turns and flees.
text: Brom steps up, scythes ready. He and the Horseman go at it.
text: Brom blocks axe and sword, catching and deflecting blows.
text: At the forest, Glenn follows Theodore away.
text: Ichabod grabs a long handled SICKLE.
text: Brom swings the scythes. The Horseman avoids.
text: Ichabod moves to the side, looking for an opening. He swings
text: the sickle. The Horseman blocks.
text: The Horseman battles both at once, catching blows...
text: countering every strike, METAL RINGING.
text: Brom catches the Horseman's sword in one scythe, holding it
text: off. Catches the axe handle in the other scythe.
text: The Horseman flatfoot KICKS Brom's chest, sending him down.
text: Ichabod swings the sickle blade...
text: Hits the Horseman, the blade embedding to the hilt.
text: The Horseman drops his axe and grasps the sickle, jerking...
text: The sickle handle SLAMS Ichabod's, knocking him away.
text: Ichabod crawls, tries to shake off the blow.
text: He looks up. The Horseman staggers, spastically trying to
text: pull the blade from his body.
text: Brom limps to Ichabod, yanks him to his feet.
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: We cannot win this.
text: They head towards the forest.
text: Behind, the Horseman extracts the sickle, throws it. He
text: strides after them, picks up his axe on the way.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERBANK -- DAY
text: Ichabod and Brom stumble down a hillside. Brom points.
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: There...
text: They run to a DOCK at the edge of a wide, rapid river. They
text: jump into a FLAT BOAT barge.
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: Go to the front and guide it.
text: Ichabod goes. Brom uses a scythe to slash the ropes.
text: Ichabod picks up a GUIDE POLE. The barge lurches, set free.
text: Ichabod struggles to push the boat out. it moves swiftly,
text: caught in rain swollen current.
text: Brom looks back. No Horseman. He leaves the scythe and
text: moves to the front, hefting another pole to help guide.
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: Let's see him catch us now.
text: Ichabod looks to the shore. Horror.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Look.
text: LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES -- ahead, the Horseman stands on the
text: bank with Axe and sword. Daredevil near.
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: We'll pass right by the son of a bitch.
text: Ichabod and Brom push with the poles, trying for speed.
text: At the bank, the Horseman walks directly to the water...
text: Just as he takes a step onto the water, the rain churned
text: surface TRANSFORMS -- instantly BECOMING a SHEET of ICE...
text: SPREADING and supporting the Horseman as he advances.
text: ICE SHOOTS OUT ahead of him, towards a point in the river
text: where it will intercept the barge.
speaker_heading: BROM
dialog: My Christ...
text: The Horseman's ICE BRIDGE engulfs the barge, HALTING IT.
text: Ichabod and Brom are thrown. The barge is trapped.
text: The Horseman nears.
text: Brom runs to the rear to retrieve his scythe. Ichabod holds
text: up the only weapon he has, his guide pole.
text: The Horseman steps on board. Ichabod swings. The Horseman's
text: axe cracks the pole in half...
text: The Horseman thrusts with sword -- into Ichabod's chest --
text: clean through. It SIZZLES as Ichabod screams.
text: The Horseman lifts Ichabod up, flips him, pulling the sword
text: out as Ichabod goes...
text: SMASHING through the ice and under.
text: UNDERWATER: water carries Ichabod, slams him against ice
text: above. He's pulled down by undertow.
text: ABOVE WATER, beyond the edge of the ice bridge: Ichabod comes
text: up, gasping, choking on rain.
text: He treads water, looking to the barge.
scene_heading: ICHABOD'S P.O.V. -- FROM THE WATER
text: Aboard the barge, the Horseman cuts Brom down... stands over
text: him, chopping with sword. Our VIEW grows BLURRY, and...
speaker_heading: FADES OUT/IN
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Candlelight. Ichabod, shirtless, feverish, opens his eyes.
text: The wound at the top of his chest is raw. Katrina inserts a
text: needle in the skin around it.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Lay still, Ichabod. Do not move.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
text: Doctor, he is awake.
text: Ichabod tries to sit. Pain stops him. Lady Van Tassel helps
text: bleed the wound with the needle and a tube leading to a
text: SUCTION JAR of blood.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (barely a voice)
dialog: What... what are you doing... ?
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
text: Doctor Lancaster comes to the bed.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LANCASTER
dialog: Keep still, Constable. You were
dialog: half-drowned when they found you.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: ... Brom Bones...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LANCASTER
dialog: He is dead. You would be also, if
dialog: your wound had not somehow shut.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Bring Young Masbath here.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LANCASTER
dialog: You need to sleep.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Bring him.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LANCASTER
dialog: You need rest.
text: Ichabod gives up, closes his eyes. Katrina, needle in one
text: hand, brings her other hand to hold Ichabod's.
text: Blood drips into the suction jar.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- LATER NIGHT
text: Ichabod is soundly asleep. Across the room, Katrina is at
text: his work table. Ichabod stirs. Katrina looks to him.
text: Once she is satisfied he will not wake, she returns to what
text: she was doing, turning a page. She is reading his ledger.
scene_heading: EXT. SERVANT'S QUARTER'S, MASBATH'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Young Masbath lies awake. A glint of light crosses the
text: window. Masbath looks to it, gets up, peers out.
text: THROUGH THE WINDOW, he can see the Van Tassel Manor House in
text: the distance. Lantern LIGHT crosses the lawn.
scene_heading: EXT. VAN TASSEL ESTATE, ORCHARD -- NIGHT
text: The lantern light moves through the orchard, away from the
dialog: house. We cannot make out the person.
text: Elsewhere, Young Masbath runs in pursuit. He hides against
text: one tree, leans to look...
text: The light enters forest. Young Masbath follows.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- MORNING
text: Ichabod's hurting. Masbath helps with a shirt.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Someone left last night. Looked
text: like they headed to the square, but
dialog: I lost them in the forest.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Man or woman?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: All I saw was their lantern.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Business, best hidden is hidden best
dialog: at night.
text: Ichabod goes to his work table, organizing his satchel.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: If someone has the Horseman's skull...
dialog: if they control the Horseman, then why
dialog: haven't they sent him for your head
dialog: yet?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Because, I serve a fine purpose alive.
dialog: It is perfection for our murderer if I
dialog: return to New York City with nothing
text: more than tales of a galloping ghoul.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: We must uncover the reason these
dialog: victims were targeted. What was taken
dialog: from them... other than their lives?
dialog: Who benefits by their deaths?
text: Ichabod fumbles the bottle of white powder.
text: It bounces, cork popping out... rolls under the bed.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Damn it.
text: Ichabod kneels, pained. A trail of the blood-detecting
text: powder has spilled. The bottle is out of reach.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: I'll get it.
text: Young Masbath gets down, ready to crawl for it, but Ichabod
text: stops him, peering under.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Wait...
text: Far under, near the bottle, some powder is bubbling.
text: Ichabod moves to the end of the bed and lifts, in pain.
text: Young Masbath helps. They drag the bed to one side.
text: Under the bed: a Satanic PENTAGRAM has been DRAWN IN BLOOD.
text: Ichabod stares, trying to grasp the implication. Masbath is
text: about to speak, but Ichabod puts a finger to his lips.
text: Ichabod moves to lock the door.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Who did this?
text: Ichabod does not answer. He picks up a wash basin and dumps
text: the water to wash the Pentagram away.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE/CHURCH -- DAY
text: WAGONS, HORSES and TOWNSPEOPLE swarm. A CROWD loots the
text: town's general store. Provisions are passed along man to man
text: and loaded on wheelbarrows.
text: All up and down the long straight road, home owners board up
text: windows with lumber.
text: Ichabod and Young Masbath ride, passing many angry faces.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
text: Panic has set in.
text: They stop, tying their horses and climbing stairs to the door
text: of the "NOTARY." Ichabod looks off...
text: DOWN THE ROAD, at the far end, people head to the church.
dialog: Much activity there as well.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Sanctuary. Or, so they hope.
text: Families put up tents all around the church within the
text: bordering wrought-iron fence. Supplies abound.
text: People work to build and erect massive wooden crosses.
scene_heading: INT. NOTARY PUBLIC, HARDENBROOK'S OFFICES -- DAY
text: Tidy room. Young Masbath watches Ichabod hand a slip of
text: paper to the elderly Notary, Hardenbrook.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Do you have these persons' wills?
speaker_heading: HARDENBROOK
dialog: I have everything... last testaments...
dialog: birth certificates, death certificates...
dialog: deeds.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
text: Hardenbrook studies the paper with his one good eye.
speaker_heading: HARDENBROOK
dialog: Certainly... certainly.
text: Hardenbrook nods, handing the list back, grinning. Ichabod
text: stands waiting. Hardenbrook is still nodding.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
speaker_heading: HARDENBROOK
dialog: Hmm? See them?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: May we look at them now?
speaker_heading: HARDENBROOK
dialog: Of course. You want them... it shall
dialog: not take long. Wait here.
text: Hardenbrook heads across the room. Ichabod offers the list.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Maybe you should take this.
speaker_heading: HARDENBROOK
dialog: A fine idea.
text: Hardenbrook takes it and exits. Young Masbath sits.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: What good is this?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: To discover what might have been taken
dialog: from those who died, it will help to
dialog: know what was there that could be
text: taken in the first place.
text: Ichabod waits. After a moment, he looks uncertain. He
text: crosses to the half-open door...
scene_heading: INT. NOTARY PUBLIC, RECORDS ROOM -- DAY
text: Ichabod sticks his head in, not liking what he sees.
text: Hardenbrook's amidst unbelievable disarray. Tables, shelves,
text: and baskets of unevenly piled documents.
text: Hardenbrook looks on a shelf, confused, then goes to a table,
text: lifting papers, mumbling.
speaker_heading: HARDENBROOK
dialog: Damn... damn... damn...
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Master Hardenbrook...
text: Hardenbrook turns, a bit startled.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
speaker_heading: HARDENBROOK
dialog: Well... that might be... helpful.
scene_heading: INT. NOTARY PUBLIC, RECORDS ROOM (TIME CUT) -- DAY
text: Hardenbrook is asleep in a chair, snoring, blind eye open.
text: Ichabod and Young Masbath face official-looking documents,
text: with Ichabod focused on one will in hand.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: My father had farm land. It was the
dialog: only thing we owned of any value.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (still reading)
dialog: And it now belongs to you, according
dialog: to Baltus. I heard him say it.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Yes.
text: Ichabod turns the will in his hand to Masbath.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Then look here at your father's will,
dialog: and tell me why you are not listed.
text: Young Masbath takes it, boggled. Ichabod grabs another.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Van Garrett had denoted his elder son
dialog: in his last wishes; the same son
text: murdered along with him. But Van
dialog: Garrett's wife and two infant children
dialog: are not written... and they were spared.
dialog: (picks up another will)
dialog: Do you see? Philipse had no family to
dialog: bestow his farm to. But, here...
dialog: (picks up another)
dialog: The Widow Windsor was listed on her
dialog: late husband's will. After her
dialog: inheritance, she amended the document
dialog: to include her bastard child. This is
dialog: why the Horseman made absolutely
text: certain to impale the unborn descendant.
text: Ichabod sits back.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Only the heirs were killed. Proof that
text: the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: But, if the farm is not mine, who stole
dialog: it away?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: No one yet, far as I can tell. It has
dialog: gone intestate.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: In test... what?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Intestate. Your farm... all the
dialog: farms... they belong to no one.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: What does it mean?
text: Ichabod stares off.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Often in such cases, property which
dialog: has gone intestate legally passes to
dialog: whomever the deceased was indebted to.
dialog: And, who in this town is owed a great
dialog: many debts?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: (realization)
dialog: Baltus Van Tassel.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Did your father take a loan?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Yes. I rode with him on payment days.
text: Ichabod stands, grim, gathering wills and his ledger.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Tonight, we answer questions. And, to
dialog: discover who moves about the Van Tassel
dialog: house after dark... all we need is a
dialog: candle.
text: A LOUD NOISE is HEARD from the other room. Ichabod looks.
scene_heading: INT. HARDENBROOK'S OFFICES -- DAY
text: Ichabod bursts in. No one there. A chair has been knocked
text: over and the front door is ajar. Ichabod moves...
scene_heading: EXT. NOTARY -- DAY
text: Ichabod exits. All around is the commotion in the square as
text: before. No telling who it was who just fled.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- DAY
text: Young Masbath is seated, bored. Ichabod writes in his
text: ledger. A KNOCK on the door. They both look up.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (o.s.)
dialog: (from outside door)
dialog: Constable... are you there?
dialog: (long pause)
dialog: Ichabod?
text: The knob is tried and found locked. Pause. At the bottom of
text: the door, a red rose is passed under.
text: This saddens Ichabod.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH -- NIGHT
text: Quiet night. The church is a sight, with a yard resembling
text: an empty squatter's tent city, surrounded by crosses.
text: Boarded over windows leak shafts of light.
text: MOVING PAST THE WINDOWS: many eyes peer out from the slats.
text: UP IN THE BELFRY, TWO RIFLEMEN are on watch.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod and Masbath are in darkness, still waiting. Ichabod
text: takes the cover off a lantern, looks at a clock. Midnight,
text: straight up. Ichabod stands, picks up an unlit candle.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Midnight seems an appropriate time.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod and Young Masbath look out, cautious. They move to
text: the nearest door.
text: Ichabod crouches, using the candle to mark the seam of the
text: door and door frame. He's making a low, wax seal. If the
text: door opens, the seal will break.
text: They move to a second door, quietly. Ichabod makes another
text: low wax mark.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, MAIN ENTRANCE -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod and Masbath come downstairs to a hall. Ichabod
text: continues his wax marking at each door.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, BALTUS' OFFICE -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod and Young Masbath enter, shutting the door. Ichabod
text: walks to shelves at Baltus' desk, looks through ribbon bound
text: DOCUMENTS and hands some to Masbath.
text: Young Masbath pulls off the ribbon, pages through these "LOAN
text: AGREEMENT" parchments. Ichabod brings another pile.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: They are alphabetical.
text: Young Masbath has the M's. "MARYIE," "MEGAPOLENISIS," AND
text: "MELYN..." Not finding what he wants.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: There is no Masbath here. My father's
dialog: loan papers are missing.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (regarding his documents)
dialog: There are none for Magistrate Philipse
dialog: either. "Paasch, James" "Pieter,
dialog: Thomas" "Pos, William."
text: A FLOORBOARD CREAKS. Ichabod looks, blows out the lantern.
text: He and Young Masbath stand frozen.
text: Across the room, light comes under the door, stops, then
text: continues. A DOOR is HEARD OPENING and SHUTTING. Ichabod
text: crosses to follow, pointing back.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Keep looking. Then, hide in my room
text: and bolt the door till I return.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST -- NIGHT
text: Lantern light moves, far ahead. Ichabod follows.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST, FURTHER ON -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod stops, hidden. He can see the light ahead, but it is
text: no longer in motion. He advances.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST CLEARING -- NIGHT
text: A lantern sits on a rock. On a blanket, a semi-naked MAN and
text: semi-naked WOMAN are in the midst of rough SEX.
text: Ichabod crawls to peer from underbrush.
text: The couple keeps coupling, with the man on top. His grunts
text: and gasps are particularly desperate. He's all over the
text: woman, who lays back... it is Lady van Tassel.
text: Ichabod swallows, inches closer.
text: Lady van Tassel pulls the man's shirt, exposes his flesh.
text: She raises a small, sharp KNIFE behind his back.
text: Ichabod's eyes widen.
text: Lady Van Tassel brings the blade to her own hand, slicing
text: deep in her palm. Blood flows. She rubs her cut hand over
text: her partner's arching back, smearing blood.
text: Lady van Tassel caresses the man's chest, neck, face...
text: trailing blood. The man lifts his head, in ecstasy, sucks
text: the woman's bloody fingers... it's Clergyman Steenwyck.
text: Ichabod backs away, having seen more than plenty.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Young Masbath unlocks the door. Ichabod enters.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: I was getting worried. Who was it?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Lady Van Tassel.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: What was she doing?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Something I really wish I had not seen.
dialog: Never mind it. Did you find the
dialog: victims' loan agreements?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: No. They are all missing.
dialog: This troubles Ichabod.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: There is more, though. While you were
dialog: gone, I could hear someone else
text: walking through the house.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod and Young Masbath creep round a corner. Going to the
text: LAST DOOR, Ichabod crouches, eyes narrowing...
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (whispers, to himself)
dialog: Katrina.
text: The wax seal is broken, flecks of wax on the floor.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FOYER AND HALL -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod and Masbath come downstairs, checking all the wax
text: marks. Young Masbath finds one broken.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Here.
text: Ichabod comes over, pushes the door...
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: They enter. The kitchen is empty. Ichabod crosses to
text: another door, crouches. Another broken wax mark.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: They enter... the room with the elaborate loom. Ichabod
text: moves his lantern to make a quick search, goes to table.
text: He touches the top of a candle. His finger comes away with a
text: bit of still wet wax.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: There are no other doors. This is as
dialog: far as she could have gone.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: It is nothing. She comes to read books,
dialog: so her father will not find her.
dialog: (to convince himself)
dialog: It is absolutely nothing.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: What books?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Fiction plays and novels. Baltus does
dialog: not approve. Now, come. It may not be
text: long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: But, sir... what books? Where are they?
text: Ichabod stops, looking around. No books anywhere.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: If there is a secret place for books...
dialog: it could be just as good for the
dialog: missing loan agreements.
text: Ichabod ponders this without saying anything.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- LATER NIGHT
speaker_heading: SEARCH MONTAGE:
text: - Drawers are opened and searched, quietly.
text: - Young Masbath uses a candle to look up the fireplace.
text: - Ichabod opens a linen cabinet, unfolding blankets.
text: - Young Masbath looks in a closet filled with big spools of
text: sewing thread, on his knees, pulls a wooden box forward.
text: Inside it, he finds only old cups and silverware.
text: Ichabod pulls up a rug, feeling along the floorboards.
text: Young Masbath crawls, doing the same. He climbs under the
text: loom, tapping on the floor. TAP... TAP... TAP...
text: He crawls further under the loom. TAP... TAP... PLONK. A
text: hollow sound. He taps again... PLONK... PLONK.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Constable.
text: Ichabod comes over as Young Masbath lifts a loose board.
text: Under the floor, there are piles of books. Masbath brings
text: them up, handing them to Ichabod, who studies the spines.
text: Young Masbath reaches in up to his shoulder. He comes up
text: with "LOAN AGREEMENTS."
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Fie! Here they are.
text: Ichabod takes them. Names are near the top: "Masbath," "Van
dialog: Garret," "Philipse," and "Killian."
text: Ichabod sits back, numb, his heart bitterly broken.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MORNING
text: Lady Van Tassel prepares food with two servants at the open
text: fireplace/oven. Ichabod enters, rushed.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina
text: is not in her room.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: No. She has gone out.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: She has taken the last of our grain
dialog: to be milled.
dialog: (crossing to him)
dialog: You do have a background in the
dialog: medical arts, don't you, Constable?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Very little. I must be going...
text: Lady Van Tassel holds out her cut palm, the gash sewn shut.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: Will you look at this? I cut my hand
dialog: this morning: I sewed it myself, but
dialog: I am afraid it will go bad.
text: Ichabod takes her hand, distracted and nervous.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
text: It appears well. It has already
text: clotted.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: Look closer. Do you have anything to
dialog: clean it with?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: It is fine. Now, I must...
text: Lady Van Tassel grabs Ichabod by the wrist, tight.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: (whispering, close)
dialog: I know you saw me.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: What... ?
text: Lady Van Tassel glances to servants, keeps her voice low.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: I know you followed last night. You
dialog: must promise not to tell Baltus...
text: Ichabod tries to pull away, but she grips tighter. The FRONT
text: DOOR is HEARD SLAMMING. Ichabod is panicky.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: Have mercy on me. Please... have mercy.
text: Ichabod pulls away just as Baltus enters. Lady Van Tassel
text: goes back to work as if nothing happened.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: Constable, it is urgent that we speak.
scene_heading: EXT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE FRONT PORCH -- MORNING
text: Baltus leads Ichabod to the porch.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a
text: meeting. This time he is determined
dialog: to have you forced out, or worse.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: How did you hear this?
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: He came to me. He promised great
dialog: violence. Said I should cast you out
dialog: for my own protection.
dialog: (troubled pause)
dialog: I must speak honestly. There is no
dialog: reason to think he will not meet with
dialog: success.
text: Ichabod looks to barn, sees Masbath bringing the horses. The
text: CHURCH BELL is HEARD TOLLING far away.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: That is the meeting bell already
dialog: calling. With the murder of Killian
dialog: and Brom, no one sees any good from
dialog: you. If... if you were to leave...
dialog: you might be saving your own life.
text: Ichabod studies Baltus, then offers his hand. They shake.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I appreciate your concern. I thank
dialog: you, sir.
text: Ichabod hurries off, across the lawn, exasperated. He runs.
text: Masbath runs to him. Ichabod takes Gunpowder and climbs up.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: (mounting his horse)
dialog: What now? Where is she?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Things have become complicated.
text: Katrina is at the mill. Ride ahead,
dialog: find her and bring her to meet me
dialog: outside the church. Find her at all
dialog: costs. Quickly.
text: They ride, fast.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST -- DAY
text: A conjuring pile of straw burns. Gloved hands unfold a paper
text: filled with clippings of human hair. The hair is sprinkled
text: on the fire.
text: A cloaked FIGURE is kneeled at the pile. The figure turns to
text: remove A human SKULL from a cloth bag.
text: The skull is placed at center in the flames. It's teeth are
text: sharp, cut to points. The HORSEMAN'S SKULL.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH -- DAY
text: In the church yard refugee camp, food is prepared over fire.
text: People inhabit the tents.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH, STEENWYCK'S QUARTERS -- MORNING
text: IN THE CHURCH: it's crowded with families. Pews filled with
text: bedding and belongings. Steenwyck comes to CLOSE the DOUBLE
text: DOORS of his quarters, turning, angry.
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: You are astonishing, Constable. Do
dialog: you truly think your ridiculous
dialog: accusations frighten me?
text: Ichabod is doing nothing to hide his disdain.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Only if I repeat them outside this
dialog: room. And, I will if I must...
dialog: (points to doors)
dialog: Out there, for all to hear. Or...
dialog: you may speak, as planned. But, you
dialog: tell them you feel compelled to move
text: on to greener pastures.
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: No. You will not run me out. No one
dialog: will believe a word of what you say.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Oh? Far as I can tell, a rumor does
dialog: not travel alone for long here.
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: Are you a deist? Is that it? A free
dialog: thinker who does not believe in
dialog: divinity.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: It is only important what you are.
dialog: An adulterer...
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: I am the Lord's voice in this town.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Wallowing in sin and lust...
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: They need guidance.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
text: Wallowing quite literally in blood.
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: (snapping, quaking)
dialog: Damn you, sir! God damn you to hell!
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: He may. But, not soon enough for
dialog: you, and not on your behalf.
text: Ichabod walks. Steenwyck is humiliated.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: You are so upset now... and yet, you
dialog: seemed in such good spirits last night.
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: You cannot do this. I am a man of God!
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
text: Climb to the top of the tallest ladder
dialog: you can find, Father. That is the
dialog: closest you ever come to God.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- DAY
text: Pews are packed. Steenwyck enters, walks to the altar.
text: EVERYONE QUIETS. Steenwyck has composed himself, barely.
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: My friends... dear friends. Those of
dialog: you still on your farms, I thank you
dialog: for coming.
text: He sees Ichabod near the back. THUNDER is HEARD OUTSIDE.
scene_heading: FATHER STEENWYCK
dialog: I... I address unfortunate business.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I am forced to take my leave from
dialog: Sleepy Hollow. I will be moving on to
dialog: do the Lord's work elsewhere.
text: The GATHERERS MURMUR shock. Ichabod walks out.
scene_heading: EXT. THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- DAY
text: Raining hard. Baltus and Lady Van Tassel ride.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: Hurry along. The meeting has most
dialog: certainly already begun. We do not
dialog: want Steenwyck as our enemy.
text: Lady Van Tassel trails. WOOD is HEARD SPLINTERING...
text: Just off the road, a tree falls...
text: The trunk catches Lady Van Tassel's horse on its rear flank.
text: The horse falls. Lady Van Tassel hits the dirt.
text: Baltus looks back, halting.
text: Lady Van Tassel looks up to Baltus in fear, then turns.
text: Behind her, the Headless Horseman trots from, the forest on
text: Daredevil, stops. Calm. He takes his axe in hand.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH -- DAY
text: Storming. The meeting is letting out. Near the churchyard
text: gate, Young Masbath rides with Katrina following on a horse
text: cart. Ichabod walks up as Katrina dismounts.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: What is so urgent?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Come with me.
text: Ichabod leads her to where they can talk away from others.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Why have I not seen your face for so
dialog: long? You look much better.
text: She touches his face, but he takes her hand, places the loan
dialog: agreements there.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Explain these. I found them secreted
text: away in the sewing room.
text: Katrina's expression changes just so slightly to guilt.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Why... why have I scrambled and run
dialog: and clawed in all directions, only to
dialog: find you against me?
text: He stares at her. Katrina stares back, in a small way
text: defeated. She looks for an out, but there is none.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: I have been reading your journal.
dialog: I'm sorry. I found it too fascinating
dialog: to resist.
dialog: (pause, ashamed)
dialog: I rode to catch up with you at the
dialog: Notary, out of curiosity. Before I
dialog: found you though, I overheard what you
dialog: were said.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: It was you there?
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: When... when you spoke father's name
dialog: along with accusations, I could not
dialog: believe it. I had to hide these... at
dialog: least till I could confront him myself.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: And, what did he say?
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: He did not do these things. If you
dialog: knew him, you would realize...
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: What did he say, Katrina?
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: I have not been able to face him yet.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: The loans give the land to your father.
dialog: It does not matter survivors are still
dialog: on their farms. They could be thrown
dialog: off... tomorrow... a year from now.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Yes, I have seen that, and I told you
dialog: why I hid them.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: What would you have me believe?
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: (tiring, angry)
dialog: If you think I am behind this, say it.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: The name Van Tassel is blackened. You
dialog: share that name.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Call me a liar, then, and a murderess.
dialog: Say it, out and out.
text: Many people are starting to notice the confrontation.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Katrina...
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Speak the words, Constable. What is
dialog: stopping you? What has happened to your
dialog: ability to transcend sentimentality?
text: Emotions tear at him. Rain seems to pound down harder.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Oh, no. No. Please... don't dare stand
dialog: looking as if you still care for me,
dialog: after all that you have said. If I were
dialog: to confess, would that ease your
dialog: suffering? Would that make it easier
dialog: for you to hate me?!
scene_heading: A TORTURED CRY is HEARD O.S.
text: Baltus comes charging through the square on his horse.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: The Horseman is coming!
text: He's barely hanging on. He stops, practically falling off,
text: running towards Katrina and Ichabod.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: Save me...
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Father?
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: He killed her...
text: Baltus grasps Katrina, fearful. HOOFBEATS are HEARD.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
text: The Horseman has killed her.
text: Far behind, the Horseman rides to follow, axe held up.
text: Instant mayhem -- people scatter all directions, screaming.
text: Baltus runs headlong to the church.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Father!
text: Katrina runs after Baltus. Ichabod backs away, watching the
text: Horseman come, then heads to the church with Masbath.
text: Baltus pushes through the iron gate, into tent city, joining
text: the swarm of townsfolk pouring into the church.
text: The Horseman rides behind, closing the gap. Men, women and
text: children run for cover all along the square.
text: Amidst the churchyard panic, Ichabod looks back...
text: The Horseman reaches the open gate and Daredevil suddenly
text: rears up, snorting, unwilling to enter.
text: The Horseman grabs Daredevil's reins, tries to move forward
text: again. Same result. Daredevil freaks out.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- DAY
text: Baltus makes his way in, shoving. People are still clamoring
text: in through the doors.
text: Men pass rifles from stockpiles and climb onto pews at
text: boarded windows. Women herd children into a cellar.
text: Baltus searches for a hiding place. He looks across the
text: church to see Steenwyck closing the doors of his living
text: quarters. Baltus moves...
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: Steenwyck!
text: At the front doors, Katrina squeezes in with Ichabod and
text: Young Masbath just as people are forcing the doors closed.
text: It's madness. People outside begin pounding.
dialog: Katrina searches.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Father!
text: Ichabod goes to a window, looking out between boards.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH -- DAY
text: Across the yard, the Horseman gives his axe an underhand toss
text: to the ground inside the gate.
text: The AXE instantly BEGINS TO DEGRADE TO DUST in the rain.
text: The Horseman rides, keeping outside the fence.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- DAY
text: Ichabod comes away from the window, looking to panicked
text: citizens. He sees Katrina moving up the aisle...
text: She's heading towards Baltus, who slams against the door to
text: Steenwyck's room.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: Damn you, Steenwyck! Help me!
dialog: Let me in!
text: RIFLES BOOM LOUDLY as men at the windows begin firing.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH -- DAY
text: The Horseman circles, under fire.
text: Great clouds of gun smoke shoot from the church.
text: Men fire down from the belfry.
text: Parts of the Horseman and Daredevil splatter red into the
text: rain as slugs hit without effect.
text: AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHURCH, the Horseman comes around,
text: heading to the town square.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- DAY
text: Rifleman shout to each other, running to the opposite windows
dialog: to follow the Horseman.
text: Young Masbath grabs a rifle and leaps to join the brigade.
text: Baltus is still beating Steenwyck's door when a HUGE FARMER
text: grips Baltus angrily and throws him...
speaker_heading: HUGE FARMER
dialog: You'll kill us all!
text: Baltus falls, knocking over pews. Katrina's nearby.
speaker_heading: HUGE FARMER
dialog: You're the one the Horseman wants.
dialog: Why should we die for you!?
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: NO!
text: The huge farmer picks Baltus up, dragging him and shoving
text: Katrina aside as she approaches.
text: Ichabod's pushing past people, trying to reach them.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH/TOWN SQUARE -- DAY
text: The Horseman brings Daredevil to a halt, yanking a large coil
text: of ROPE off a hitching post.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- DAY
text: The huge farmer shoves Baltus to the floor again.
speaker_heading: HUGE FARMER
dialog: Get out!
text: Others join the rage, pulling Baltus towards the front of the
text: church, shouting. Ichabod struggles to push them off.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Stop this!
text: Ichabod gets to Baltus' side, trying to protect.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: The Horseman cannot enter! It does
dialog: not matter who he wants, he cannot
dialog: cross the gate!
text: At the windows, ONE RIFLEMAN turns, crying out.
speaker_heading: ONE RIFLEMAN
dialog: He's coming back!
text: More panic. The huge farmer moves towards Baltus.
speaker_heading: HUGE FARMER
dialog: We have to save ourselves!
text: Baltus pulls the pistol from Ichabod's holster, brandishing.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: No! Get away from me!
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH -- DAY
text: The Horseman rides past the front, fired upon.
text: He halts at the wrought iron gate, reaching to yank off one
text: POST which is pointed on top, like an arrow head.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- DAY
text: Baltus holds everyone's back with the pistol.
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: The next person to lay hands on me
dialog: will have a bullet. Stand off!
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Father...
speaker_heading: BALTUS
dialog: No! We're safe here.
dialog: (points at Ichabod)
dialog: You said it. The Horseman will not
dialog: have me.
text: CRASH, the harpoon-like post SPEARS through a window,
text: trailing rope tied to it...
text: CRACK -- SKEWERS Baltus from behind, the bloodied point
text: bursting out his breast bone.
text: Baltus looks down, drops the gun... clutching the post with
text: both hands. Blood streams out his mouth. Katrina screams.
text: The rope yanks Baltus back. He SLAMS into the WINDOW...
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH -- DAY
text: Baltus CRASHES out, hits the ground, dragged...
text: Outside the fence, Daredevil runs with the rope tied around
text: his saddle pommel. The Horseman strides forward, sword out.
text: Baltus SLAMS the fence and the rope snaps. He is held there
text: awkwardly, gurgling blood.
text: The Horseman reaches Baltus... chops off his head.
scene_heading: INT. SLEEPY HOLLOW FORESTS -- DAY
text: The storm has passed. Empty forest. Long, peaceful pause,
text: till Ichabod makes his way through, searching the ground.
text: Ichabod comes to look down a small hill. The corpse of Lady
text: Van Tassel lies headless, in a dirty, torn dress.
text: Ichabod walks to the body. Lady Van Tassel's arm is twisted
text: behind. The sewn cut on the palm of her hand faces up.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (shouting back)
dialog: Here! I have found her...
dialog: (looking at corpse,
dialog: quiet and miserable)
dialog: Here she is.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALL -- EARLY EVENING
text: Doctor Lancaster comes out from where Katrina is asleep. He
text: closes the door, wipes his sweaty face. Ichabod waits.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LANCASTER
dialog: It has been a terrible jolt to her
dialog: nerves.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: You will stay at her side?
text: Doctor Lancaster nods. Ichabod walks.
scene_heading: EXT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- EARLY EVENING
text: It's getting dark. Ichabod comes out and crosses the porch.
text: A few of the Hollow's residents are here. Young Masbath gets
text: up and follows Ichabod onto the lawn.
text: Ichabod walks without waiting.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: She's the one who controlled the
dialog: Horseman, isn't she, sir? Sir?
dialog: (no answer)
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I need time for thinking. Without you
dialog: hanging on my coattails for a change.
text: Ichabod keeps walking. Young Masbath stops, wounded.
scene_heading: EXT. WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod stands holding a torch, looking up. The whole area
text: is bright from the light off a giant fire.
text: There are broken lanterns and barrels around the agonized,
text: twisted tree. The tree is aflame, fire dancing up the trunk,
text: and through every branch to lick the sky.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST -- DAY
text: Dawn. Ichabod is seated overlooking the Hudson. He stares
text: at the beauty around him, brooding through bleary eyes.
text: Gunpowder is tied to a tree. BIRDS SING.
text: The ledger is open in Ichabod's lap. He thumbs pages
text: absently, just keeps staring off.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST -- DAY (TIME CUT)
text: A fire burns in a circle of rocks. Ichabod's ledger is
text: thrown in. The pages catch quickly.
text: Ichabod watches, then walks away. He's about to climb onto
text: Gunpowder, but on second thought he opens his satchel and
text: digs out a BOOK. He walks back to the fire, throws it on...
text: "Romeo and Juliet." Flames devour it.
scene_heading: EXT. WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- DAY
text: The clearing is silent. The twisted tree still stands,
text: smoldering, impressive as ever, or perhaps even more so with
text: the alien appearance its blackened skin now affords it.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod packs up baggage. Young Masbath is miserable.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Won't you change your mind, sir?
dialog: What can I say to convince you?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Nothing. To hell with this place
dialog: and all the people here.
text: Ichabod closes a bag, throws it with others.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Why... why are you like this?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (pause, softening)
dialog: You do not know all that has happened.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You cannot understand.
scene_heading: EXT. VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- NIGHT
text: A coach, with Gunpowder as one of its team, waits in the
text: orchard. Van Ripper comes to meet Ichabod and Masbath.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Half now. Half when we reach the
dialog: city.
text: Ichabod hands Van Ripper money. Van Ripper takes the
text: baggage. Ichabod looks to the Manor House. Only one light
text: shines, in a second floor window.
text: Katrina can be seen there a moment as she closes curtains.
text: Ichabod turns to Young Masbath, who is beginning to cry.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: This is farewell.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Take me with you. There's nothing
dialog: left for me here.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I cannot.
dialog: (bends to Masbath)
dialog: You should not worry.
dialog: (pause, sorrow)
dialog: Van Ripper and his wife will look
dialog: after you. They will. You will be
dialog: well cared for.
text: Young Masbath hugs. Ichabod hugs back, swallowing.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I am sorry.
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Forgive me. I failed you.
text: Ichabod releases and goes quickly away, finding this misery
text: unbearable. He climbs in the coach.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Do not go, Constable. How can you
dialog: leave?
text: INSIDE THE COACH, Ichabod slumps back in darkness and closes
text: his eyes. He pounds twice on the coach wall.
text: OUTSIDE, Van Ripper whips the reins. The coach starts.
text: Young Masbath follows. The coach picks up speed on the long
dialog: straight road.
text: Young Masbath stops, wiping tears.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE/CHURCH -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod's coach moves through the town square. A few people
text: in the churchyard's tent city come out to watch it pass.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: The door is pushed open. Young Masbath enters, looks around
text: the empty room. He goes to sit in a chair at the work table,
text: crossing his arms and resting his head.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: A plate of food sits untouched. Katrina is slumped down in a
text: chair, heartbroken, staring into the fireplace.
text: Behind her, a shadow moves across the room.
scene_heading: EXT. THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT
text: Van Ripper leads the coach through the stone pillars marking
text: the entrance of Sleepy Hollow.
scene_heading: INT. ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod takes off his hat, sets it on the seat. The window
text: between him and the driver slides open.
speaker_heading: VAN RIPPER
dialog: Sir... this is yours.
dialog: (offering something)
dialog: The Van Tassel girl said to give it
dialog: to you after you were gone.
text: Ichabod takes it. It is the bird/cage spinning toy. He
dialog: studies it. What melancholy.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Katrina sits with her eyes closed. A BOARD is HEARD
text: CREAKING. She sits up. Suddenly, a FIGURE in black is behind
text: her as she turns. WHACK! -- a gloved fist strikes.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: A dull THUD is HEARD downstairs, like a body falling. Young
text: Masbath takes notice. He moves to the door...
scene_heading: INT. ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod turns the strings on the bird/cage toy, ponders it.
text: The paper disk spins, images flickering until the bird
text: appears to be inside the cage.
text: Ichabod keeps spinning it, looks out the window.
text: A tear rolls down his cheek.
text: The bird cage toy's rotation slows... stops.
text: Ichabod looks at it a long moment, then pockets it and leans
text: forward to the window at front.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE COACH
text: Ichabod's face appears behind Van Ripper.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
speaker_heading: VAN RIPPER
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Turn around. Now!
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FOYER -- NIGHT
text: Young	Masbath comes down the stairs, looking around meekly.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Hello? Katrina?
text: Masbath starts down a hall. He does not see, in another
text: room, Katrina's body is dragged across the floor.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE, DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT
text: The coach comes to Lancaster's. Ichabod climbs out before it
text: even stops fully, satchel in hand. He hurries...
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, PARLOR -- NIGHT
text: Doctor Lancaster, half asleep, comes to answer BANGING on his
text: door. Ichabod pushes past, taking Lancaster's lantern.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Pardon the intrusion...
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod enters. There are two coffins on the floor.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I never examined these bodies.
text: Ichabod removes the lid from one coffin. Lancaster is about
text: to say something indignant, but then just looks disgusted.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LANCASTER
dialog: ... help yourself, you pompous ass.
dialog: I will be in bed.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Would you stay, doctor? I may need
dialog: assistance.
text: Lancaster reluctantly remains. Ichabod stares at the dead
text: Lady Van Tassel. The neck wound is covered by a stained
text: brown cloth, which Ichabod unwraps.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
text: Stains of blood.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LANCASTER
dialog: What of it?
text: Ichabod takes out one of the lenses that survived the
text: magnification spectacles, bends to examine the neck.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
text: Jagged flesh.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: The Horseman did not do this.
text: Ichabod moves to the side of the coffin, lifting the hand
text: with the stitched gash on its palm.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Here, Doctor. Hold this just so...
text: Lancaster holds the lens so that Ichabod can study the cut
text: through it. Ichabod takes a scalpel-like knife from his
text: satchel, lifts the hand and cuts stitches.
text: THROUGH THE LENS: the gash spreads easily, soft, bloodless.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: No clotting or gathering of pus. No
dialog: healing at all.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LANCASTER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: When this cut was made, this person
dialog: was already dead.
dialog: (stands straight)
dialog: This is not Lady Van Tassel.
scene_heading: INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: Young Masbath enters. The door swings shut.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Katrina.
dialog: (steps forward)
dialog: Is anyone here?
text: Behind him, the door SLAMS open -- Lady Van Tassel reaches to
text: grab Young Masbath by the throat.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH/TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod charges up to the church doors, pounding.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Open the door. Open up, damn it!
dialog: (pounds, shouting)
text: Lady van Tassel is alive. The Horseman
dialog: is her puppet. Please...
text: The door opens and Huge Farmer points a rifle at Ichabod.
text: Frightened people peer out from behind.
speaker_heading: HUGE FARMER
dialog: Aren't we rid of you?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Listen to me. Lady Van Tassel has
dialog: faked her death. I need able men...
speaker_heading: HUGE FARMER
dialog: She's dead, and you have gone mad.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: HUGE FARMER
dialog: (steps forward)
dialog: Get out! Isn't it enough that you have
dialog: ruined this town? Go!
text: Ichabod backs away from the gun, frustrated, runs...
text: At the DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, Van Ripper is still on the coach.
text: Ichabod sprints over, breathless, taking out his pistol.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
speaker_heading: VAN RIPPER
dialog: Yes. Here...
text: Van Ripper hold up a rifle. Ichabod holds out his hand.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: May I see it?
text: Van Ripper's confused, but hands the rifle over. Ichabod
text: immediately points his pistol at Van Ripper.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Get down. Hurry!
text: Van Ripper climbs off. Ichabod climbs up, whips the horses.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Sorry.
text: Van Ripper watches the coach leave, still with his hands up.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST -- NIGHT
text: In a wooded area, Katrina lies unconscious. Gloved hands
text: reach to her hair and cut off a clump with SCISSORS.
text: A conjuring pile has been made, containing a small animal's
text: heart with an iron nail through it. Katrina's hair is added
text: and the pile is lit to burn.
text: Nearby, Young Masbath watches, on his belly with his hands
text: tied behind his back.
text: Lady Van Tassel whispers over the fire, her white horse tied
text: nearby. She looks to Katrina, who stirs.
text: Lady Van Tassel takes the Horseman's skull from a bag over
text: her shoulder, places the skull in the flames. THUNDER is
text: HEARD. Lady Van Tassel looks up, smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT
text: The wind tosses leaves in swirls. The twisted tree opens
text: wide, with a RUMBLE -- shafts of light shooting out.
scene_heading: EXT. THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod drives the coach hard ahead.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST -- NIGHT
text: Katrina sits up, groggy. Lady Van Tassel looks down at her.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: You... you are alive.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: Am I? Or, are you and Young Masbath
dialog: dead along with me?
text: Katrina sees Young Masbath, and beyond him, the dying fire.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
text: She commands the Horseman.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: And, quite beautifully done, wouldn't

text: THUNDER again. Wind starts to pick up.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: (of the wind)
dialog: He rides tonight.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Father saw you die.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman
text: looming over me as I fled. Things I
dialog: wanted him to see. But, as long as
dialog: I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm
dialog: me. Baltus did not stay enough to
dialog: see that. He ran as a coward,
dialog: unfettered by my fate.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Then, whose body was it... ?
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: The precious servant girl Sarah. I
dialog: killed her and kept her body hidden,
dialog: till I needed it. And, when I
dialog: return to the Hollow tomorrow, my
dialog: version of the truth will come to
dialog: pass.
dialog: (faking meekness)
dialog: I mean, there I was that fateful day,
dialog: following Baltus into the woods. I
dialog: did not know what he was up to...
dialog: where he was going. I worried for
dialog: his safety.
text: Katrina cautiously moves the hand she's supporting herself
text: with, feels a rock and clutches it.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: Imagine my surprise, finding him on a
text: liason with a common servant. A girl
dialog: who had apparently become his secret
dialog: love.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: No one will believe your lies, whore.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: This whore will see your mouth shut
dialog: forever very soon. But... I am not
dialog: going to kill you. Not me...
text: She picks up the Horseman's skull in her gloved hand.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: He will have that honor.
scene_heading: EXT. WESTERN WOODS -- NIGHT
text: The Horseman rides Daredevil, a freight train of moldering
text: flesh, heading towards a chasm with no bridge.
text: They reach it, galloping in mid-air to the other side.
scene_heading: EXT. LONG STRAIGHT ROAD/VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod guides the coach into the Van Tassel orchard.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST -- NIGHT
text: Lady Van Tassel admires the skull.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: (mock sorrow)
dialog: Woe is me... that spying on my husband
dialog: in his filthy indiscretion, I saw he
text: and Sarah attacked by the Horseman.
dialog: Oh pity me... so overcome was I that
dialog: I wandered in the Western Woods...
text: dazed... nearly blind from terror.
text: Lady Van Tassel crouches, rubbing dirt on her face.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: And, tomorrow is my grand performance,
dialog: having barely survived the elements...
dialog: (more emoting)
dialog: By sheer luck I found my way back to
dialog: the Hollow. But... what do I find
dialog: here... ? My dear, sweet step-daughter
dialog: Katrina is dead. Why has God forsaken
dialog: her?
dialog: Seeing that Lady Van Tassel lavish attention on Katrina,
text: Masbath takes this opportunity to ease onto his knees.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: (of herself, pleased)
dialog: No one will suspect this sad woman who
dialog: has been through such an ordeal. With
text: only the empty solace of her money and
dialog: land to comfort her.
scene_heading: EXT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod leaps from the coach, bounds up the porch.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Katrina!
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST -- NIGHT
text: ICHABOD is HEARD. Lady Van Tassel turns, astonished.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Murderer!
text: Katrina slings the rock -- strikes Lady Van Tassel in the
text: head, a glancing blow that knocks her down. Katrina runs.
text: Katrina grips Young Masbath, helping him up...
text: But, Lady Van Tassel scrambles up, grabs Katrina and throws
text: her back to the ground.
text: Lady Van Tassel steps hard on Katrina's ankle, touches her
text: forehead, bleeding, pissed.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: You've been a naughty girl.
text: Young Masbath leaps to action, charging head first -- slams
text: into Lady Van Tassel, sends her backwards.
text: Katrina runs and pulls Masbath up. They flee.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Ichabod!
text: Lady Van Tassel rolls, recovering, not very concerned.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: Little bitch.
scene_heading: EXT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod comes out the open front doors... hearing...
speaker_heading: KATRINA (o.s.)
dialog: (far away)
dialog: Ichabod!
text: Ichabod climbs back on the coach, taking off.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST -- NIGHT
text: Katrina and Young Masbath run out from a line of trees.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Ichabod!
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Here we are!
text: BEHIND IN THE FOREST, Lady Van Tassel rides her white horse,
text: in no hurry. Wind kicks hard. HOOFBEATS are HEARD.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: Run, Katrina! Fast as your pretty
dialog: legs will carry you. It makes no
dialog: difference.
text: ON THE LAWN, Ichabod drives towards Katrina and Masbath.
text: Behind, at the tree line, Lady Van Tassel holds up the
text: Horseman's skull, wind tossing her dress and hair.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: Nothing will stop him now!
text: At mid-field, Ichabod reaches Katrina and Masbath.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Climb up!
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Lady Van Tassel...
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I know. Hold on.
text: With Katrina and Masbath on board, Ichabod turns the coach.
text: Katrina unties Masbath's hands. HOOFBEATS GET LOUDER.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: Olly-olly oxen-free!
text: Ichabod looks back towards Lady Van Tassel.
text: At the treeline, the Horseman breaks into the open, hell on
text: horseback. Full speed ahead.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Christ.
scene_heading: EXT. THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT
text: The coach hits the long straight road, away from the house.
text: Katrina and Masbath hold on as the coach shakes violently.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I do not know. Away.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Here he comes!
text: Behind, the Horseman can be seen on the forest bordered road.
text: Closing fast. Breakneck pace.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: We might make it to the church.
text: Masbath takes a lantern, crawls back to the roof.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Masbath... !
text: He ignores, reaching the rear of the coach and throwing the
text: lantern at the Horseman. It smashes on the trail.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Damn it, boy, get back here!
text: Young Masbath slides back. Katrina helps him.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: What can we do?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Take the reins.
text: Young Masbath takes them. Ichabod slings Van Ripper's rifle
text: over his shoulder and starts back. Katrina grips him.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Masbath is right. We must do something.
text: She releases. Ichabod gets to the luggage area at the rear,
text: struggling to open a storage box.
text: Behind, the Horseman draws his sword, closer.
text: Ichabod opens the box, hefting out a long, jagged SAW.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Ichabod!
text: Ichabod looks. The Horseman rides up, swinging...
text: Ichabod recoils -- THWACK -- just missed by sword.
text: The Horseman lets the coach get ahead, shifting to the
text: other side of the trail... coming along side.
text: Ichabod backpedals, looking to Masbath.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Keep him off! Block him!
text: Masbath guides the horses over. The Horseman must fall
text: behind to avoid the wheels.
text: The coach hits a large, fallen tree trunk.
text: Ichabod bounces, falling...
text: He hangs off the side of the coach.
text: Katrina climbs to offer her hand. Ichabod offers the saw.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Take it!
text: Katrina takes the saw. Now with both hands, Ichabod tries
text: for better purchase. He grips the coach door. It opens...
text: Ichabod clings to the open door as branches slam him.
text: He's reaching to the coach threshold, reaching...
text: Ichabod pulls himself inside.
text: BOOM -- the door hits a tree trunk, bashed to pieces.
text: Ichabod looks out from the coach, dazed. He climbs.
text: Katrina looks back as Young Masbath guides the coach to block
text: the Horseman again.
text: The Horseman sheaths his sword, riding... reaching to grip
text: the back corner of the coach.
text: The Horseman dismounts, clinging, climbing...
text: Ichabod takes the rifle off his shoulder, aiming...
text: BANG! -- splattering the Horseman's hand point blank. The
text: Horseman hangs on with his other hand.
text: The Horseman re-grips with the blasted hand, amazing since
text: it's now all mush and bone.
text: Ichabod throws the rifle on his way to the driver's perch,
dialog: taking the saw from Katrina.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Move forward!
text: Katrina looks to the horses, then at Ichabod.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Go!
text: Ichabod takes the reins from Young Masbath.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Help her.
text: Reins in one hand and saw in the other, Ichabod waits. The
text: Horseman rises up and moves in, taking out his sword.
text: Young Masbath climbs down to the wooden pole connecting the
text: coach to the bridles, puts out his hand. Katrina takes it.
text: Behind, the Horseman swings. Ichabod blocks with the saw.
text: Young Masbath guides Katrina as she leaps onto one horse.
text: Bareback. Young Masbath straddles the horse beside her.
text: The Horseman swings, backhanded knocks the sword from
text: Ichabod's hand as Ichabod falls back...
text: Ichabod hits the bridle post, hanging onto straps for dear
text: life. His feet drag on the trail.
text: Above, the Horseman comes to the driver's perch, close enough
text: to kill Katrina. He raises his sword...
text: Katrina screams, ducking, helpless...
text: Below, Ichabod pulls a bolt from the coach's hitching-rod.
text: He shoves off with his feet.
text: The Horseman swings.... missing.
text: The horses detach from the coach, dragging Ichabod along.
text: The coach careens out of control.
text: It flies off the trail, hits an incline and sails off,
text: throwing the Horseman.
text: The coach hits a tree trunk and SMASHES.
text: FURTHER DOWN THE TRAIL, the coach horses stop. Young Masbath
text: and Katrina climb off as Ichabod gets to his feet, hurting,
text: clutching his previously wounded shoulder.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: What now?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: I doubt that's the end.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: The church.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
text: He moves too fast.
text: Ichabod unhooks a lantern off the bridle rail. The trail
text: behind is silent, till a bone chilling SCREECH is HEARD.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
text: His horse.
text: They start moving. Ichabod looks around. He sees...
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: There...
text: Through the tree line, the Hollow's massive windmill can be
text: seen against the sky. Katrina and Young Masbath run.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL FIELD -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath book into this open area,
text: heading to the windmill. Another HORRIBLE SQUEAL echoes.
text: Ichabod looks over his shoulder.
text: Heavy, low hanging BRANCHES and VINES at the forest edge
text: creep to life, parting... forming a sort of black tunnel.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: He's coming!
text: The Horseman gallops out, throwing leaves in his wake.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Hurry!
text: The Horseman readies a battle axe.
text: Ichabod gets under the windmill, helping Young Masbath up the
text: ladder and in. Katrina next.
text: The Horseman is almost there.
text: Ichabod follows Katrina. He gets in, feet dangling. The
text: Horseman dismounts...
scene_heading: INT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod leaps up and struggles with the heavy trap door...
text: slams it. He closes the latch just as the Horseman hits.
text: The door buckles.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: It won't hold.
text: Ichabod goes to a large GRINDSTONE against a wall. He
text: struggles to roll it.
text: Young Masbath helps him roll it to the trap door. It falls
text: on top with a thud. The Horseman's sword jabs up through the
text: grindstone's center hole.
text: The sword withdraws. A POUNDING begins.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT
text: The Horseman chops at the door with his axe.
scene_heading: INT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT
text: POUNDING CONTINUES. The grindstone shifts. Katrina and
text: Young Masbath back away. Ichabod holds his lantern up,
text: desperate for ideas, searching.
text: Above, to the right, is the milling platform, where grain is
text: ground and bagged. To the left is the crooked staircase.
text: Ichabod picks up a bailing hook, a plan forming. He gives
text: his lantern to Katrina and points.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Get up those stairs. Open the door to
text: the roof and wait.
text: Katrina and Young Masbath obey. Ichabod crosses and climbs
text: the ladder to the milling platform. He grasps a wooden
text: lever, pulling it. Gears above begin to turn.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT
text: The windmill's rotors CREAK to life, spinning.
text: UNDER THE WINDMILL, the Horseman keeps chopping. His axe
text: exposes grindstone, throwing sparks.
scene_heading: INT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT
text: Katrina looks down from the stairs.
text: The Horseman's axe pries at the seam of the trap door.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Ichabod...
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Keep climbing. I will follow...
text: Ichabod pulls bags of grain, lining them up at the edge of
text: the milling platform.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Hopefully.
text: ABOVE, Young Masbath reaches the ceiling, throws open the
text: door to the roof.
text: BELOW, Ichabod cuts holes into the grain bags, so milled
text: grain spills out and falls to the floor, creating dust.
text: He grabs one open bag and dumps it. More grain dust.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT
text: Masbath and Katrina come out. Rotors spin behind them.
scene_heading: INT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod sees below... the Horseman sticks a hand through,
text: trying to push the grindstone aside, then withdrawing. The
text: RACKING axe continues. Won't be long.
text: Ichabod grabs one half-full bag of grain, swings it with
dialog: effort, throws...
text: The bag smashes on the grindstone, busting the door...
scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT
text: The grindstone falls through, SLAMMING the Horseman down...
scene_heading: INT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod slices into a sack hanging from a pulley system.
text: More and more dust rises.
text: Below, the Horseman enters. Katrina shouts from above.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Look out!
text: The Horseman moves toward the ladder milling platform ladder,
text: but Ichabod grabs it, pulling it up...
text: The Horseman just misses the final rung.
text: Ichabod throws the ladder aside as the Horseman backs off.
text: Ichabod looks to the staircase. No way to climb down from
dialog: the milling platform and get there.
text: The Horseman runs and leaps, grabbing a hanging chain...
text: The Horseman climbs the chain, swinging...
text: Ichabod runs across the platform, jumps...
text: Ichabod grasps the frail rail of the staircase, barely.
text: The rail creaks, about to break. Behind, the Horseman lands
text: on the milling platform.
text: Ichabod is losing grip. Young Masbath races down the stairs,
text: grabs his hand. He pulls Ichabod up.
text: Ichabod's pistol slips from its holster and falls.
text: Ichabod and Young Masbath look...
text: The Horseman, following Ichabod's lead, runs across the
text: milling platform and leaps...
text: Grabs the staircase rail, only a few feet from Ichabod and
text: Masbath. Ichabod kicks the rail, breaking it...
text: The Horseman falls in billowing dust, crashing below.
text: Ichabod pushes Masbath up the stairs.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT
text: Katrina helps them onto the roof.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: Quickly, close it.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: No.
dialog: (takes lantern, points)
dialog: Get to the crest of the roof and be
text: ready to jump.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Jump? Jump where?
scene_heading: INT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT
text: The Horseman runs, agile, up stairs.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT
text: Ichabod shepherds Katrina and Young Masbath to the edge where
text: the rotors spin close.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: The blades will carry us to the ground.
dialog: Face front and wait for me.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: I... I can't do this.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: We have no choice.
text: Ichabod moves back to the trap door.
text: Katrina and Young Masbath look at the rotors, and down at the
text: long distance between them and the ground.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Be ready...
text: Ichabod throws the lantern into the windmill and runs.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Now!
scene_heading: INT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT
text: The Horseman continues up. The lantern falls past.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL, ROOF -- NIGHT
text: Young Masbath jumps. Ichabod grips Katrina and jumps...
text: They hit one rotor and cling to the frame and cloth. The
text: rotor begins its downwards swing.
scene_heading: INT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT
text: The lantern hits the ground and shatters. FLAMES EXPLODE!
text: Grain dust is consumed instantaneously -- FLAMES ROAR
text: upwards, filling the windmill...
text: Engulfing the Horseman.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT
text: The rotor is halfway to its lowest point. Masbath, Katrina
text: and Ichabod hang on as the entire structure trembles.
text: BOOM -- flames shoot out the windows, doors and seams,
text: lighting up the night.
text: On the rattling rotor, Ichabod struggles to hold the frame
text: with one hand and keep a grip on Katrina.
text: Masbath drops. Ichabod releases Katrina, then drops.
text: They hit the ground. Ichabod rolls, gasping, holding his
text: shoulder. They all look at each other in disbelief a moment.
text: Ichabod lets out a sort of rasping laugh, standing.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Okay... come on...
text: Ichabod ushers them across the field, uphill. Running.
text: Lightning flashes across the sky. THUNDER RUMBLES.
text: A bolt strikes the windmill, and it EXPLODES...
text: SHOCKWAVE DEAFENING. The rotors bust apart. Splinters of
text: burning wood spin all directions.
text: ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath keep
text: running. There is a WOODEN CART parked ahead.
text: IN THE WINDMILL RUBBLE, the Horseman rises, shoving off
text: burning debris. His flame-ravaged uniform smolders.
text: ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod stumbles onwards, but notices
dialog: something horrible...
text: In the distance, Lady Van Tassel's white horse roams free.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: (as this registers)
dialog: Oh, no...
text: Young Masbath and Katrina are just past the cart when Lady
text: Van Tassel rises from behind it, swings a plank...
text: SLAMS Ichabod in the chest and sends him down.
text: Lady Van Tassel grabs Katrina's hair, drags her.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: Should have stayed away, Constable.
text: Ichabod gets up slow, furious, reaches to his holster, only
text: to find it empty. He moves forward.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: Keep back, or I kill her.
text: She takes out scissors, holds them to Katrina's neck.
text: Katrina ceases struggling.
text: Ichabod keeps Masbath behind him, keeps his distance. Lady
text: Van Tassel shoots a glance...
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: See him...
text: Par off, the Horseman strides from the wreckage.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: You cannot kill what is already dead.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Let her go!
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: Yes... yes. I think I will...
text: Lady Van Tassel spins and throws Katrina in the cart, shoving
dialog: against it.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: No!
text: The cart rolls downhill. Ichabod moves forward.
text: Lady Van Tassel turns, brandishing the scissors, slashing and
text: missing. Ichabod backs off.
text: DOWNHILL, the cart picks up speed, headed for the Horseman.
text: The Horseman starts running to meet it.
text: UPHILL, Lady Van Tassel grins.
speaker_heading: LADY VAN TASSEL
dialog: Say goodbye to her.
text: Lady Van Tassel lunges, stabbing. Ichabod avoids, puts all
text: his fury behind his fist -- punches her in the face.
text: Lady Van Tassel hits the ground and her bag falls open,
text: sending the Horseman's skull rolling out...
text: The skull rolls... rolls... landing far away.
text: DOWNHILL, Katrina leaps out from the cart...
dialog: She lands hard...
text: The Horseman shoves the empty cart aside, still on the move.
text: UPHILL, Ichabod sees the skull. He runs towards it.
text: Lady van Tassel grabs Ichabod by the ankle. He falls.
text: DOWNHILL, Katrina runs back. The Horseman is catching up.
text: UPHILL, Ichabod tries to pull f ree from Lady Van Tassel.
text: Young Masbath comes behind her - BAM - hits her in the head
text: with the wooden plank. She's out.
text: Ichabod scrambles to his feet.
text: DOWNHILL, the Horseman catches Katrina, taking her by the
text: hair as she falls to her knees and screams.
text: UPHILL, Ichabod runs... grasps the Horseman's skull.
text: He runs towards the Horseman and Katrina.
text: DOWNHILL, Katrina struggles, but the Horseman holds her ready
text: by her hair... raises his sword...
text: UPHILL, Ichabod throws the skull...
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: Horseman!
text: The skull spins through the air...
text: The Horseman drops Katrina, reaches up...
text: Catches the skull.
dialog: Katrina runs.
text: Ichabod runs to meet her, grabs her as she falls, exhausted.
text: Together, they back away from the Horseman.
text: The Horseman holds the skull out, then brings it to his
text: shoulders, to its rightful place. THUNDER POUNDS.
text: TRANSFORMATION begins -- blood and flesh rise up from the
text: Horseman's throat and grip the skull.
text: Young Masbath drops the plank, watching in awe.
text: The Horseman's reformation continues. Muscle forms. Liquids
text: become solids. He is made whole once more, the same evil,
dialog: human face we saw in Baltus' stories.
text: He looks to Ichabod and Katrina, touches his restored face.
text: Daredevil rides up, SCREECHING. The Horseman replaces his
text: sward and climbs into the saddle.
text: He rides towards Katrina and Ichabod, but passes them by.
text: They are so exhausted they fall down.
text: Young Masbath backs up as the Horseman comes, but the
dialog: Horseman does not want him either.
text: The Horseman leans to grab Lady Van Tassel's unconscious
text: form, pulls her up across Daredevil's back.
text: He rides away with her.
text: Ichabod and Katrina watch him go. They look at each other,
text: then kiss gratefully.
text: Ichabod looks to Young Masbath.
speaker_heading: ICHABOD
dialog: How are you?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MASBATH
dialog: Tired.
text: Ichabod smiles and holds out his arm. Masbath comes over.
text: Group hug. Lightning brightens the farmland around them.
scene_heading: EXT. WESTERN WOODS, BURIAL GROUND -- NIGHT
text: HOOFBEATS. The Horseman enters the clearing, keeping a hand
text: on Lady Van Tassel. Ahead, the twisted tree awaits.
text: Lady Van Tassel is awakening, face bloody. She turns her
text: head and looks forward. She screams.
text: The twisted tree's wound opens, wide and glowing.
text: Daredevil picks up speed...
text: Daredevil leaps just as a lightning bolt blasts down,
text: striking the Horseman.
text: For an instant, Horseman and horse are transformed, SKELETONS
text: OF LIGHT, entering the tree.
text: Silence and smoke. At the tree, Lady Van Tassel's hand
text: sticks out from the tight-shut suture.
text: The sewn wound on her palm seeps blood.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET, ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY
text: A bright, busy day in New York. A coach pulls up to
text: Ichabod's home. Ichabod is the driver. He gets off, goes
text: and opens the coach door. He helps Katrina down. Next,
text: Young Masbath sticks his head out.
text: Ichabod goes about unloading bags. Katrina holds Young
text: Masbath's hand, and they look down the street in wonder.
