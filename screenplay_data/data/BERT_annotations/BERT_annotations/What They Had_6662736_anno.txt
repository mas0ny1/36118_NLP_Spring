dialog: WHAT THEY HAD
dialog: by
dialog: Elizabeth Chomko
text: Somewhere, a clock ticks.
text: We are CLOSE on a black and white PHOTOGRAPH.
text: In a simple frame, it is nestled among the evergreen needles
text: of a moonlit Christmas tree.
text: It’s the summer of ‘61. A YOUNG MAN stands in front of a
text: movie theatre, holding a YOUNG WOMAN in his arms. Her legs
text: hang limp over his forearm. They grin madly at us.
text: With the tick of the clock, another photo on the tree:
text: The same couple. 1962. She beams from an armchair in dark
text: taffeta; he rests on the chair arm in Navy dress blues. A
text: tiny diamond on her hand. A cane against her skirt.
text: Another tick, another photo:
text: Black and white, 1968. He’s dashing in a suit and Buddy Holly
text: glasses. She’s stunning, a strapless gown and opera gloves.
text: They are BERT AND RUTH KELLER.
dialog: And this is a love story.
scene_heading: INT. OAK PARK CONDO - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The same clock ticks here too.
text: A PAIR OF FEET touch down on blue shag carpeting. The feet
text: are small, old, the toes polished red.
text: The feet pad softly over the carpet. In the silvery
text: moonlight, blue veins peek through translucent skin.
scene_heading: INT. OAK PARK CONDO - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: ON THE TREE -- Three more photos:
text: 70s, black and white. An INFANT in a Christening gown.
text: 70s, color. The same child, now 3, on a darling white rocker,
text: wearing a darling yellow dress.
text: 70s, color. A Christmas Card. The child is 6 now, holding her
text: baby brother. Bert and Ruth sit on either side.
text: She is BRIDGET.
dialog: And this love story belongs to her.
scene_heading: INT. OAK PARK CONDO - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: RUTH, now late 60s, sits on a chair, her leg silhouetted in
text: the moonlit window as she pulls on silk knee-highs. She is
text: thinner now, but not frail. She is still very beautiful.
scene_heading: INT. OAK PARK CONDO - NIGHT
text: ON THE TREE -- A series of early 80s wedding portraits:
text: Bridget is a young bride, in head to toe lace, smiles
text: lovingly at EDDIE, handsome, top hat and tails.
text: Bert bursts with joy as he gives his father-of-the-bride
text: speech, scotch in one hand, cigarette in the other.
scene_heading: INT. OAK PARK CONDO - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Ruth selects pearl earrings from a jewelry box. A rosary is
text: draped over the mirror, funeral cards tucked into it’s frame.
text: In the bed behind her, BERT, now 70s, is sound asleep.
scene_heading: ON THE TREE:
text: 1990s. Bridget looks down at an INFANT of her own.
text: 1990s. Her brother, NICK, graduation gown, stands on the lawn
text: of a midwestern college, flanked proudly by Bert and Ruth.
text: 1990s. Two Polaroids, framed side by side. In one, Nick sits
text: in a canoe holding a huge rainbow trout. In the other, Bert
text: is in the same canoe, holding a tiny minnow.
scene_heading: INT. OAK PARK CONDO - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: In the moonlight, Ruth steps to a long antique mail table.
text: She fluffs her hair in the mirror above it.
scene_heading: ON THE TREE:
text: 1990s. Bridget walks down a Chicago street, beaming at us,
text: holding the hands of TWO LITTLE GIRLS.
scene_heading: INT. OAK PARK CONDO - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Ruth pulls a short jacket from the hall closet and drapes it
text: over her shoulders. She lifts her purse from the table and
text: starts down the hall.
scene_heading: ON THE TREE:
text: 2005. Bert sits in a hammock, Ruth on his lap. She kisses him
text: like she means it, dislodging his rose-tinted glasses. He
text: grins at us like the Cheshire Cat.
text: As the clock ticks, we pull slowly back, and back, and back.
text: There are lights on this tree. A garland of stars. But no
dialog: ornaments. Just the pictures we’ve seen and a dozen others.
text: We pull back further. Sheer white curtains float in a breeze,
text: framing SLIDING GLASS DOORS, open just wide enough for...
text: Ruth to stand between them.
text: She faces the snowy night. Her purse dangles at her side.
text: Under the jacket, her white nightgown glows in the moonlight.
text: In her sensible heels, she steps into the snow.
scene_heading: EXT. OAK PARK CONDO - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT
text: Ruth walks away from us, framed by the alley, through the
text: immaculate blanket of snow.
text: And then, slowly, the image of her fades from frame. Until
text: her footprints are the only evidence she was there at all.

dialog: WHAT THEY HAD
scene_heading: EXT. MENLO PARK SUBDIVISION - NIGHT
text: Gray light is just beginning to crack over the horizon.
text: BRIDGET, now 40s, in athletic gear, sprints down a street of
text: basically identical houses, basically identically decorated
text: for the holidays with tidy strings of white lights.
text: She picks up her pace, racing now, faster and faster, hitting
text: agony, pushing past it, around the corner into a cul-de-
dialog: sac...
dialog: 4.
text: She comes to a stop in front of another basically identical
text: house, the only one with colored lights strung out front.
text: Chest heaving, she puts her hands on her knees and recovers.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGET AND EDDIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
text: EDDIE, now late 40s, in a bathrobe, pours himself cereal in
text: their high-ceilinged, well-appointed kitchen. Bridget comes
text: in with the newspaper. In silence, she pours coffee.
text: They weave around each other, a chilly, well-practiced dance.
text: They settle on either side of the counter with coffees and
text: breakfast. He peruses the Business section, she the Arts.
dialog: Without looking up from their papers:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You're picking up Emma?
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Yep.
scene_heading: INT. DORM - EMMA'S FLOOR - DAY
text: At the end of a long, near-deserted dorm hallway, Bridget
text: knocks on a door. There’s no answer. She knocks harder.
text: Halfway down the hall, an RA stands with two GIRLS, who sit
text: on a couch with suitcases, whispering in Bridget’s direction.
speaker_heading: RA
dialog: Is she not answering?
text: Bridget looks at her and shakes her head. The RA approaches
text: and puts her master key in Emma’s dorm room door.
scene_heading: INT. EMMA’S DORM ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The curtains are closed; the room is dark. Bridget hurries
text: in, past the tidy side belonging to Emma’s roommate, and into
text: Emma’s filthy half of the room. Her suitcases are packed up.
text: There’s a lump in bed. Bridget yanks away pillows, revealing
text: EMMA, 20, sleeping in headphones. Bridget shakes her awake.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Emma.
text: Emma cracks open her eyes and blinks at her mother.
scene_heading: INT. EMMA’S DORM ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY
text: Emma and Bridget pull a CART packed with Emma’s belongings
text: into the hall. Bridget notices something written on the dry-
text: erase board hanging on her door.
dialog: For a good time... KNOCK
text: Bridget moves swiftly to erase it, but Emma has already seen
text: it. She stares, punched in the gut.
text: Bridget marches down the hall toward the two girls. Emma
text: follows, knowing exactly what her mother is about to do.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Mom. Mom.
text: Bridget ignores her and steps up to them, furious. She glares
text: at the girls. They stare back at her.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Shame on you girls. What is the
dialog: matter with you?
text: She turns toward Emma, who waits, mortified, by the elevator.
text: As Bridget walks up, Emma glares at her.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET (CONT'D)
dialog: What? You have to stand up for
dialog: yourself, you have to fight back.
dialog: Show some self-respect, don’t be a
dialog: doormat --
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Shhhhhh!
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Oh whatever, you're kicked out of
dialog: this stupid dorm anyway. Drug and
dialog: Alcohol Free, it’s college for
dialog: chrissakes.
text: The elevator doors open. Emma ducks inside. Bridget struggles
text: to push the cart in. The girls giggle from the couch.
text: Bridget gives them the finger as the doors close.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Mom!
scene_heading: EXT. DORM - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY
text: Bridget pushes the cart out the door. Emma follows behind,
text: furiously digging through her backpack.
text: Emma stops to light a cigarette. Bridget whirls around.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: You should not be smoking. It is
dialog: terrible for you.
dialog: (then)
dialog: What is going on with you?
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Nothing.
text: Bridget watches Emma puff awkwardly on the cigarette.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: You look absolutely ridiculous.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGET AND EDDIE’S HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - DAY
text: Bridget changes into nicer clothes. Eddie brushes his teeth.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Maybe she shouldn’t go back.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Don’t even go there, Eddie.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Why? She’s a mess, let’s take a
text: semester off and regroup.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Because she’ll never go back,
dialog: that’s why, and then she’ll be
dialog: kicking herself. Just encourage
dialog: her, would you please?
text: Bridget spots headlights in the driveway out the window.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s them.
text: She hustles out of the room into --

scene_heading: INT. BRIDGET/EDDIE'S HOUSE - HALLWAY/EMMA’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Emma’s door has a NOTE on it that reads:
speaker_heading: HOW IT WORKS
dialog: YOU: Knock

dialog: one fluid motion.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGET AND EDDIE’S HOUSE - EMMA’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

dialog: David! David David David --
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGET AND EDDIE’S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
text: Bridget heads toward MARY, her eldest, who is stepping away
text: from her fiancee DAVID’S BMW, parked on the curb. A diamond
text: sparkles on her finger.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: You made it!
text: They embrace. As they pull away, Bridget’s eyes go straight
dialog: for Mary's hair.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Stop looking at my hair.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: I’m not.
text: Behind Mary, David is pulling a SHOPPING BAG of gifts and a
text: platter out of the trunk of the BMW.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Merry Christmas, Bridget.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Merry Christmas!
text: Mary quietly reminds Bridget:

text: Mary and David head toward the front door as Bridget trots to

speaker_heading: BRIDGET (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit.
scene_heading: INT. OAK PARK CONDO - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: We are back in that condo with the ticking clock.
text: Bert sleeps in bed. A distant train horn rouses him.
text: His eyes open. He reaches for the other side of the bed.
text: Feeling it empty, he sits up and reaches for his glasses. His
text: gray comb-over stands on end.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Ruth.
scene_heading: INT. OAK PARK CONDO - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Bert flips on the light and squints into the brightness. A
text: gold crucifix glints in his salt and pepper chest hair.
text: He feels a draft and stiffens. Walks into the LIVING ROOM.
text: The sliding door is open. The curtains wave in the breeze.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Goddammit!
text: He sprints, panicked, for the door.
scene_heading: EXT. CONDO BUILDING - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. NICK'S BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: NICK, now 45, sleeps on an air mattress in a corner. On the
text: floor beside it, his phone rings with the ALARM ringer, the
text: one that sounds like an accident in a nuclear power plant.
text: He pries himself awake and squints down at the phone on the
text: ground, next to a stack of books and a bottle of booze.
text: He reaches for the phone and answers it.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Dad.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGET AND EDDIE’S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Mary stands in front of the mirror, wearing Bridget’s wedding
text: dress. Emma buttons the zillion buttons.
text: The dress is lace and satin, long sleeved, high necked.
text: Bridget sits on the bed, trying to feign enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Pretty, right? If I get rid of the
dialog: sleeves?
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Or the whole thing.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I like it.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Just get your own dress.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I wanna wear Mom’s.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: I didn’t even pick it out.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Who picked it out?
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Grama. There was this other one, it
dialog: was off the shoulder, it had these
dialog: ribbons... I loved that dress.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: So where the hell is it?
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Grama thought it was too revealing.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Well. I want to wear a family
dialog: dress, so.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: You could get married in winter.
dialog: It’s more appropriate for winter.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We're getting married in June. We
dialog: already have a venue. Undo me.
text: Mary backs up to Emma for her to undo her.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: You don’t get married because you
dialog: have a venue.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I’m getting married because I wanna
dialog: get married, Mom.
text: Bridget tries to drop it but can’t help herself.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: He’s a lot older than you, Mare.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Mom.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: What? What’s the big rush? Why not
dialog: be engaged for a couple of years?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Can we not talk about this right
dialog: this second?
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: It’s just - lot of people have a
dialog: long engagement, it’s really not a
dialog: big deal, it’s --
speaker_heading: MARY AND EMMA
dialog: Mom.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGET AND EDDIE’S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Bridget and Eddie are in bed. She’s awake, staring up at the
text: ceiling. Her cellphone on the night stand rings.
text: Eddie rouses as Bridget reaches for it. It’s Nick.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Nicky?
text: She listens.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you mean she’s gone?

scene_heading: EXT. O'HARE AIRPORT/NICK’S RANGE ROVER - DAY

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: NICK
text: He’s looking for her, looking

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hospitals, St. Giles, the Rotary

speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Did you call the police?
speaker_heading: NICK

dialog: he’s white as a ghost. When he

text: another heart attack.
text: Bridget looks out the window and sips her latte, taking in

speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)

dialog: tellin’ him for years, figure out
dialog: what you wanna do with Mom when the
dialog: time comes, ‘cause we all know it’s

dialog: works.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET

text: They all turn to look at Bert’s reaction. He is staunch, arms
text: folded stubbornly across his chest. She tries another tactic.
speaker_heading: DR. ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, the reason I did a pelvic
dialog: exam is... during wandering

dialog: cleaning bag.
scene_heading: INT. OAK PARK CONDO - BOUDOIR - A MOMENT LATER
text: Bridget buttons the blouse in the mirror. It’s sheer; her bra

text: The doorbell RINGS.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Shit.
text: She grabs one of her mother’s lipsticks and swipes it on her

text: races out toward the front door.
scene_heading: INT. OAK PARK CONDO - FOYER - DAY
text: Bridget, in the blouse, bra showing underneath, stands at the

speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: I was thinking a lock with a key
dialog: but the key on the inside, you
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Right, so you can lock it and hide

speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Smart. Back door too?
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Yeah, if you have time, that’d be -
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: For you? I got all the time in the

text: An awkward beat, then Gerry covers nervously.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean ‘cause it’s an easy thing to

dialog: With an s. Take me twenty minutes,
dialog: half hour tops, so.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Great.
text: Another awkward beat, then:
speaker_heading: BRIDGET (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you want some coffee?
scene_heading: INT. OAK PARK CONDO - KITCHEN - DAY
text: Bridget pulls the crock of corned beef out of the fridge and
text: makes Gerry a sandwich as he pours coffee into mugs.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Sorry about your mom.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Oh, thanks. That’s okay.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: No. No it isn’t.
dialog: His unwillingness to dismiss things people generally dismiss
text: catches her off guard.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Dad's been gone two years, Mom
dialog: eleven Easter Sunday. Still not
dialog: okay.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Doesn’t matter how old you are.
dialog: Life is just harder when you don’t

dialog: A beat, then:
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you have sugar?
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Sugar? Sugar.
text: She opens the cabinet to the left of the sink. A bag of sugar
text: is high on a shelf. She jumps for it.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Here.
dialog: 62.
text: He comes behind her and reaches over her for it, his other
text: hand on the small of her back. There is nothing forward or
text: inappropriate about this, but something about him behind her,
dialog: his smell, his touch...
text: Her knees begin to buckle. She literally swoons.
text: She steps away before her knees give completely, and fumbles,
text: light-headed, to steady herself on the counter.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: You all right?
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Mm-hmm!
text: Utterly flustered, she pulls her blouse away from her chest.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry, I just - got hot, is it hot?
dialog: I have low blood pressure. Blood
dialog: sugar. I think I’m starving.
text: A beat, then Gerry points, obviously, at the sandwiches. She
text: grabs a bagel from the plate from this morning and pulls the
text: insides out and eats the edges.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t eat... things.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: California girl.
text: She nods, mortified. He picks up his coffee and smiles
text: knowingly at her.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I get it, you know? I’m divorced
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I have a radar. Like gay-dar.
dialog: Divorce-dar. Plus no ring, so.
text: She waits for herself to correct him... but is suddenly mute.
text: He blushes, thinking he’s overstepped.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: So, I'll just - get started.

dialog: Gotcha! Funny!

scene_heading: EXT. OAK PARK CONDO - PORCH - DAY - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: BRIDGET

speaker_heading: BRIDGET (CONT'D)
dialog: I haven't smoked in twenty years. I

dialog: eat things.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You know, everybody thinks being

dialog: know what’s lonely? Laying awake in

speaker_heading: BRIDGET (CONT'D)
dialog: That is loneliest thing. That.

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Jesus Christ, Bitty, goddamn.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Alone? Alone is great! I went from

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: God you smell good, you always

speaker_heading: BRIDGET

scene_heading: INT. OAK PARK CONDO - HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER
text: The Zeppelin plays on a boom box on the mail table.
text: Gerry appears in the back doorway and heads down the hall

text: walks into the living room.
text: She races back down the hallway, waving the smoke away, and
text: shuts off the music.
text: The new dead bolt locks the door from the inside; the key is

speaker_heading: GERRY

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Good. You shouldn’t smoke.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Either should you.
text: He caves and tosses her his Pall Malls. She takes one and

text: He watches her puff awkwardly on the cigarette.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Well if you’re gonna do it at least
dialog: look cool for chrissake. Here.
text: He adjusts the cigarette in her fingers. She tries it.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: There you go, now you don’t look

speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: I cannot deal with her.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Nothing happened with that dude.
dialog: Your mom’s a pain in the ass but

speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: She’s a hypocrite.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I hate watching her hate herself.
dialog: But it’s like if I don’t see her

speaker_heading: EMMA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Hate yourself too, huh?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Go on, get outta here, you’re

text: Emma gets out of the car.
scene_heading: EXT. OAK PARK CONDO —- SIDEWALK - A MOMENT LATER
text: Emma walks up to Bridget, still holding the cigarette. They
text: stop a few feet away from each other.
text: Neither of them say a word.
text: And then Emma holds out her cigarette, sly, pointed, offering
text: it to Bridget. She doesn’t take it.
text: Emma tosses it and walks past her toward the condo.
text: Bridget’s eyes meet Nick’s, who has been watching from the
text: car. He flips her the bird and pulls off.
scene_heading: INT. OAK PARK CONDO - GUEST ROOM - NIGHT
text: Bridget and Emma sleep in bed. The door is open.
text: Ruth, in her white nightie, passes by the doorway several

text: Bridget starts awake. Ruth’s face is inches away.
speaker_heading: RUTH

speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: It’s Dad.

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I sleep with our Dad?

dialog: what Nick said.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Yeah.
text: Ruth’s face relaxes. She pads softly out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. OAK PARK CONDO - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Ruth crawls into bed, rousing Bert.
speaker_heading: BERT

speaker_heading: RUTH

speaker_heading: BERT

scene_heading: INT. OAK PARK CONDO - GUEST ROOM - DAY
text: Bridget and Emma sleep. On the night stand, her cell phone
text: vibrates.
text: Bridget reaches over and grabs it. It’s Eddie. She sends it
text: to voicemail.
scene_heading: INT. OAK PARK CONDO - BATHROOM - DAY
text: Bridget brushes her teeth. Her phone is on the counter,
text: playing Eddie’s voicemail on speaker.
speaker_heading: EDDIE’S VOICEMAIL
dialog: Hi, um, your father just called.
text: Bridget stops brushing and stares at the phone.
speaker_heading: EDDIE’S VOICEMAIL (CONT'D)

dialog: 81.
scene_heading: INT. OAK PARK CONDO - FOYER / LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Bridget peers in, looking for Bert. Ruth is peering at

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Is that my baby?
text: Bridget ignores her and heads around the foyer corner into
text: the KITCHEN DOORWAY.
text: Bert is pouring a cup of coffee. Bags of groceries sit on the
text: counter. Bridget stands in the doorway and seethes at him.
text: He holds the coffee out to her.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: I don’t want it.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: It’s coffee.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: I don’t want it.
speaker_heading: BERT

text: She explodes.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: I am a grown-up! If I don’t want

speaker_heading: BRIDGET (CONT'D)
dialog: What did you tell him?
text: Ruth wanders in.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Nobody. Go turn on the Road Runner.
text: Ruth wanders out.
speaker_heading: BERT (CONT'D)
dialog: I told him I bought you plane
dialog: tickets and to pick you up at the
dialog: airport, that’s what I told him.
dialog: 82.
text: He unpacks his groceries angrily, shaking his head.
speaker_heading: BERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Floozin’ around with some

dialog: know who you are.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: He put locks on, Dad, and you’re

text: Bert slams down a can of peas.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: What am I, some horse’s ass?
text: He returns to his groceries.
speaker_heading: BERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Eddie is as much a son to me as
dialog: your brother is.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: I think you like Eddie more than
dialog: you like me. And my brother, for
dialog: that matter.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Oh for chrissake, Bitty, what kinda
dialog: thing is that to say?
dialog: (then)

speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: All my life you've been telling me,

speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: There isn’t.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: How can you say that? You have more
text: bells and whistles than anybody.
dialog: 83.
dialog: She’s losing her mind and you still
dialog: can’t live without her. Didn’t you
dialog: want that for me?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Of course I wanted that for you,
dialog: that’s all I want for you, why do
dialog: you think I’m sending you home?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Love is commitment, Bit, you work
dialog: at it.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: I been working at it for 20 years.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Well you work at it 20 more if you
dialog: want what we got. Go home and think
dialog: about why you married him in the
dialog: first place.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: I married him because you told me I
dialog: couldn’t do better.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: You couldn't! Eddie’s a home run!
dialog: Your wedding was the best day of my
dialog: life, walking you down the aisle to
dialog: a man who might deserve you.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You know what your problem is?
dialog: California, that’s what, everybody
dialog: out there flowin’ in the wind, re-
dialog: inventing, what the heck is that?
dialog: You are who you are. I’m a husband,
dialog: a father, a Catholic, I know it
dialog: ‘cause I am it and I never had to
dialog: think about it. You go home to your
dialog: husband or you go stay with your
dialog: brother. There’s no reason to be
dialog: unhappy in a perfectly good
dialog: marriage.
dialog: The only thing she can think of to make him understand is:
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Why were you unhappy in your
dialog: perfectly good Camry?
text: He looks at her, appalled at the comparison.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: I don’t wanna look at you. Go sit
dialog: with your mother.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: I never said I was leaving, I’m
dialog: saying I don’t have what you have.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: You do too! You think we didn’t
dialog: have rough patches? You aughtta go
dialog: talk to a priest.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: I’m not a Catholic anymore.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Well there’s your problem right
dialog: there.
text: Bridget explodes.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: How do you know?
text: He looks at her, startled.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET (CONT'D)
dialog: How did you always know what my
dialog: problem was? Do I do that to you?
dialog: Did I march in here saying Mom's
dialog: going in a home, if you don’t like
dialog: it, go talk to a priest?
dialog: (then)
dialog: I listened to you, Dad. I asked you
dialog: what you wanted and I fought like
dialog: hell to get it for you because you
dialog: matter to me, what you want matters
dialog: to me, why don’t I matter to you?
dialog: (losing it)
dialog: Why did I never matter? I’m
dialog: capable, I coulda done something, I-
dialog: - Mom was a feminist for chrissake,
dialog: didn’t it occur to anybody to ask
dialog: me what I wanted?
text: Bert is astonished.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: We did, honey. We did ask you. You
dialog: said you couldn't wait to be a
dialog: mother.
dialog: 85.
text: It lifts something massive from Bridget’s shoulders. There is
text: a still moment. The Road Runner wafts from down the hall.
text: And then - there’s a knock/barge at the door. It’s Emma.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Is Grama in here?
text: Bridget and Bert’s eyes go wide. They race out into the
text: HALLWAY and look into the doorway of the DEN.
text: It’s empty.
text: They race to the FOYER. The front door is wide open.
text: Bert sprints through it. Bridget throws her feet into a pair
text: of Bert’s shoes and races after him. Emma sprints the other
text: way, down the building hallway.
scene_heading: EXT. OAK PARK CONDO - BUILDING ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS
text: Bert bolts out the doors and scans the landscape for Ruth.
text: She’s nowhere. He sprints off toward the elevated tracks.
text: Bridget flies out the building doors and down the walkway,
text: hand over her eyes, scanning into the sun.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Mom!
text: There is no sign of Ruth. Bridget sprints across the lawn.
text: A moment later, Emma races down the walkway behind her.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Mom!
text: Bridget whips around to Emma.
speaker_heading: EMMA (CONT'D)
dialog: I got her! She’s at Marion's!
text: Bridget whips around to Bert. He is kneeling on the ground,
text: head down.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Dad!
text: Bridget races to him, clumsy in his too-big shoes.
text: He doesn’t move. She arrives at him and kneels, terrified.
text: He is sweating, head down, shoulders shaking.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET (CONT'D)
dialog: Is it your heart?
text: Then she realizes: he is crying.
scene_heading: INT. OAK PARK CONDO - DINING ROOM - DAY
text: The clock ticks. Bridget and Bert sit at the table. His head
text: is down, but he’s recovered.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: I’ll stay. I’11 stay and help.
text: He is still for a long moment. Then he rises and leaves the
dialog: room.
text: Moments later, he returns, carrying the Reminiscence Folder.
text: He sits, opens it, and pulls out a pen.
scene_heading: EXT. O’HARE AIRPORT - NIGHT
text: The T-Bird idles on the curb. Bert and Emma pull suitcases
text: out of the trunk. Emma watches Bridget and Ruth embrace.
text: When they part, Ruth’s eyes are filled with tears.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: It’s okay, Mom. I’1l be back ina
dialog: couple weeks.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Oh, I won't be here.
text: She’s so earnest that Bridget can’t help smiling.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Yeah? Where you going?
dialog: As though it were the most obvious thing in the world:
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I expect my mother’1l want me home
dialog: by then.
text: Bridget and Emma stare, haunted. Bert goes to get in the car.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Let’s go, Ruth, it’s cold.
text: Bert gets in. Emma helps Ruth into the front seat.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: BERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Love you, Bit.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Love you, Dad.
text: They watch the car pull off, then head into O’Hare.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGET AND EDDIE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Bridget, Eddie and Emma sit at the dining table, Emma in
text: between her parents, eating the dinner Bridget has made.
text: They eat in silence for a long moment. And then:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: So? How was it?
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Fine.
text: Eddie nods and looks at Emma.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Fine.
text: And it occurs to Bridget that Nick might be right, that she’s
dialog: raising two women not to say what’s really going on.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Are they all set? Your dad signed
dialog: everything?
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Mm-hmm. Yes. I have to go back ina
dialog: couple week, help them get moved.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Sure. It’s good. It was time.
dialog: (then)

speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Emma)
dialog: Did you register for classes?

speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Mm-hmm.

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Oh. Well. Good.
scene_heading: INT. NICK’S BAR - DAY
text: Sun bounces off the copper bar. TWO QUIET REGULARS watch the
text: muted Bears game on the flat screen. Nick is behind the bar
text: with a clipboard, doing inventory. The front door opens.
text: Bert enters, in his coat and hat, newspaper under his arm.
text: He checks it all out as he takes a seat at the bar.
text: Nick goes over. Puts a cocktail napkin down and looks at Bert
text: expectantly. He’s not saying the first word.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: You do a Manhattan?
text: Nick turns and mixes it expertly. This very moment is the
dialog: reason he’s perfected his manhattan.
text: Bert reads his paper. Nick strains the manhattan into a
text: martini glass in front of him, then rinses the shaker.
text: He pretends not to watch Bert take his first sip.
speaker_heading: BERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn good manhattan, Nicholas.
text: Head down, cleaning, Nick smiles.

scene_heading: INT. BRIDGET AND EDDIE’S HOUSE - EMMA’S ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Just - let me.

dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry. I just look at you...
dialog: and all I see is my baby.
speaker_heading: EMMA

speaker_heading: BRIDGET

speaker_heading: EMMA

scene_heading: INT. OAK PARK CONDO - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The clock ticks. Ruth sits cross-legged on the floor, looking

speaker_heading: RUTH

speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: You got drunk on Christmas.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (pious)
dialog: I did not.
speaker_heading: BERT

speaker_heading: BERT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RUTH

speaker_heading: BERT

speaker_heading: BERT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Thank you honey.
text: She smiles at him as he leans down and kisses her.
speaker_heading: BERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Your turn. Open up.
text: She looks down at the box, not sure what to do. Bert reaches
text: down and gently pulls open a flap.
speaker_heading: BERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Now rip it.
text: She starts to, unsure.
speaker_heading: BERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Just rip it, honey.
text: She does. Inside is a long skinny jewelry box.
speaker_heading: BERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Open it up.
text: She does, carefully, and gasps. It’s an antique locket on a
dialog: silver chain.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Ooh!
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: C’mere, now, lemme show you.
text: She shuffles to Bert spryly on her knees. He opens the locket
text: and shows her the picture inside.
speaker_heading: BERT (CONT'D)
dialog: You know who that is?
text: She stares at it hard for a moment. Then she remembers.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: That’s you ‘n me.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: That’s right. You ‘n me.

dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: BERT (CONT'D)
dialog: (brightly)
dialog: So when you forget, you can just
dialog: look at it. All right?
text: Tears well in her eyes. She knows exactly what he means. She

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I’m so sorry, Bertie.
text: He blinks back tears and holds her just as tightly.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: It’s all right, honey. I’m all

speaker_heading: NATE

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Merry Christmas.

speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Oh!

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Did I? Open it, they said it was

speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Oh. Maybe it has a new feature or --

speaker_heading: EDDIE
