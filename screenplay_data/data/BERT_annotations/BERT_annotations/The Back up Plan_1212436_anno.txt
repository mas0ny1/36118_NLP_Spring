scene_heading: INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY
dialog: We're not exactly sure where we are. And we're not exactly
dialog: sure who's talking. All we know is that we are looking at a
text: foot. One bare foot with chipped red polish.
speaker_heading: ZOE (V.O.)
dialog: I can't believe I didn't get a
dialog: pedicure for this. How
dialog: embarrassing. Look at that...
text: The toes open and then curl down as if trying to hide.
speaker_heading: ZOE (V.O.)(CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong with me? If I were
dialog: with a real guy doing this, I
dialog: would've gotten a pedicure. And a
dialog: wax. I'm pathetic.
text: The CAMERA PANS to the other foot, which is also chipped.
speaker_heading: ZOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck, that one's even worse. And
dialog: when did my toes get so fat? No
dialog: wonder I'm alone. I'm a fat-toed
dialog: animal.
text: Zoe lets out a sigh. She speaks out-loud now.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry I didn't get a pedicure.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: What?
text: DR. HARRIS (mid-fifties, jovial) looks up from between Zoe's
text: knees, the light on his head flashing right in Zoe's eyes.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: My toes...sorry.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: I'm not looking at your toes.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Right. Duh.
text: Dr. Harris stands and takes off his gloves.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: All done.
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: That's it?
text: And now, for the first time, we see ZOE. Despite the paper
text: gown and worried look on her face, she's a late-30-something,
dialog: girl-next-door type. She could be your best friend.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: I'll elevate your legs for ten
dialog: minutes and then you're good to go.
text: He sets a kitchen timer and then pushes a button to raise her
text: legs. We hear the loud TICK TOCK of the timer.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: This is the first time I've heard
text: that ticking clock sound and it
dialog: doesn't freak me out.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: Good. Just relax.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I can't, I'm totally freaking out.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: Everything's going to be great. I
dialog: have a feeling you and...
dialog: (checks empty syringe)
dialog: Number CRM-101404 are going to make
dialog: beautiful babies together.
text: Zoe smiles. Maybe he's right. Yeah...of course he's right.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (V.O.)
dialog: Number CRM-101404? Are you high?
scene_heading: INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY
scene_heading: TITLE UP: FOUR WEEKS AGO
text: BOBBY, 39 (but says he's 33,) gay and gorgeous, opens a file
text: and points to a piece of paper.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Says here he has red hair and
text: freckles.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: And glasses, too.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: And why are we picking him?
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Because he's honest.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: He's ugly.
text: Zoe points to a stack of potential donors.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: You think they're all telling the
dialog: truth? If they're so smart and
dialog: good looking, why are they beating
dialog: off into a cup?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Have you ever fucked a guy with red
dialog: hair and freckles?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No, and I won't have to.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: But what about your kid? No one's
dialog: going to want to fuck your kid.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That came out wrong.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Yeah...it's a good thing you're not
dialog: going to be the father.
scene_heading: INT. WAVERLY INN - NIGHT
scene_heading: TITLE UP: EIGHT WEEKS AGO
text: Bobby spits out a mouthful of Sauvignon Blanc.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What? I can't be the father!
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Come on, we don't have to have sex.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Oh, Jesus, I didn't even think
dialog: about that. Rewind, rewind,
dialog: rewind...
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: You're one of my best friends.
dialog: Don't you want to help me?
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, but...that's too much. I'll
dialog: walk your dog, tell you when you
dialog: look fat, be honest about your
dialog: eyebrows...
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Just a few sperm. Big deal. You
dialog: waste billions of them every night.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You know I flee at the slightest
dialog: chance of intimacy. Do you see
dialog: these bags under my eyes? Ricardo
dialog: slept over last night, and he
dialog: wanted to hold me. I actually had
dialog: to fake a seizure.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Forget it. Forget the whole thing.
text: Zoe sighs and puts her head in her hands.
speaker_heading: MONA (V.O.)
dialog: Forget the whole thing. It's just
dialog: a phase...
scene_heading: INT. MONA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: TITLE UP: TWELVE WEEKS AGO.
text: Zoe and MONA, Zoe's age but looks much older, sit at the
text: kitchen table.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: You don't want kids. Trust me.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Easy for you to say. You have
dialog: four.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Yeah, and it's awful.
text: Three CHILDREN run through the kitchen yelling and screaming.
text: A beat later, a TODDLER runs after them crying.
speaker_heading: MONA (CONT'D)
dialog: They've ruined my life.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Come on...
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Have you seen my vagina?
text: Zoe shakes her head.
speaker_heading: MONA (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you want to?
text: Zoe shakes her head again.
speaker_heading: MONA (CONT'D)
dialog: I would do that for you. To prove
dialog: to you that you don't want to have
dialog: kids, I will show you my vagina.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I don't want to see your vagina. I
dialog: want a baby. My own baby.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Is it possible you're just a little
dialog: lonely? You know, you haven't met
dialog: the right guy and--
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: It's not about a guy. I don't need
dialog: a guy. I don't even think I want a
dialog: guy at this point. I've dated a
dialog: hundred guys in the last five
dialog: years, and not one of them is even
dialog: close to being the one. How long
dialog: am I supposed to wait?
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: You never know. He could be right
text: around the corner.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Well, then he's late. And I hate
dialog: people who are late. And what if
dialog: he's not right around the corner?
dialog: What if he's miles away?
text: Zoe shakes her head. She becomes very serious.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: I want to have a baby. And time is
text: running out. I hear a clock
text: ticking every time I close my eyes.
dialog: I need it to stop.
text: We hear a loud DING.
dialog: 6.
scene_heading: INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY
text: Zoe opens her eyes. We're back in the exam room. She looks
text: at the timer, which just hit zero. She smiles.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Ding.
text: Then a tear forms in the corner of her eye. She wipes it
text: away. She wipes a tear from the other eye. Happy tears.
text: Then she looks at her legs high above her on the table.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: How the fuck am I supposed to get
dialog: down from here?
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE HALLWAY - LATER
text: Zoe walks down the hall with her legs pressed firmly
text: together, moving only from the knees down. Dr. Harris
text: passes.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: You don't have to walk like that.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Oh. Okay.
text: Zoe separates her legs an inch. And then closes them.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Should we hug? We might have just
dialog: made a baby together.
scene_heading: INT. WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Zoe walks through the waiting room with her legs still
text: pressed together. She sees two PREGNANT WOMAN, touches her
text: own stomach and smiles. She finally feels part of this
dialog: exclusive baby club.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: PREGNANT WOMEN
dialog: Hi.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
text: Zoe enters the elevator where there is a WOMAN holding a
text: BABY. Zoe smiles at them. Another member of the club...
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Hi.
text: The elevator descends. Zoe continues to stare at the baby
text: with a big smile. She stares for an uncomfortably long time.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You're starting to freak me out.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Sorry.
text: Zoe looks down. After a beat, she sneaks another look.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Stop it.
scene_heading: EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY
text: It's POURING outside. The kind of rain that turns umbrellas
text: inside out. NEW YORKERS run for cover with newspapers over
dialog: their heads.
text: Despite the rain, Zoe skips out of the building with her
text: hands in the air and twirls around. Realizing that she's
text: spread her legs too far apart, she snaps them back together.
text: A WOMAN pushing a baby stroller covered in plastic runs by.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Hi!
text: Zoe looks uptown for a cab. Nope. Nothing. She starts to
text: walk, still keeping her legs firmly pressed together. She
text: rounds the corner towards the subway station and then,
text: miraculously, spies a cab.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Taxi!
text: She runs (little steps) across the street.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI - MOMENTS LATER
text: Zoe closes the door behind her.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Hallelujah!
dialog: 8.
text: As soon as the word comes out of her mouth, she notices
text: someone entering the cab from the other side.
text: This is STAN, early 40s, but looks more like a college kid --
text: faded jeans, t-shirt, cute, messy hair.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Uh...excuse me. This is my cab.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You own it?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No, but I'm about to rent it.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Actually, if we're being technical,
dialog: you kind of stole it.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: If you see someone about to get in
dialog: a cab, you can't just run in from
dialog: the other side and say it's yours.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I didn't see you.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I saw you see me.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (to the cabbie)
dialog: Sir, who saw you first?
text: The CABBIE picks up his paper and starts to read.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Maybe you're not from around here,
dialog: but there's a code. It's like war,
text: even though it's brutal and bloody,
dialog: there are still certain rules we--
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Fine. Forget it. I'll get out.
text: Zoe grabs the door handle and then turns back.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: But not because you're right, but
dialog: because I am in a terrific mood,
dialog: and you are ruining it.
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: No. I'll get out.
text: They each get out.
scene_heading: EXT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS
text: Zoe and Stan stand on opposite sides of the taxi in the
text: POURING RAIN. Zoe crosses her arms.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Now what?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I don't know. You tell me.
text: That question is answered by the cabbie, who now peels out.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What? Where's he going?!
dialog: (waving her hands, then)
dialog: Come back!
text: They both stand there with a taxi's width between them.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, that was stupid. Why'd you
dialog: get out, you, stupid-head?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You said you were in a great mood
dialog: and I was ruining it. I felt bad.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Did you just call me stupid-head?
text: Zoe storms off with her little steps.
scene_heading: INT. 68TH STREET SUBWAY STATION - DAY
text: Stan and Zoe each swipe their Metrocards at the same time.
text: They enter the subway platform which is jam packed with all
text: the other NEW YORKERS who are shit-out-of-luck in the cab
text: department. Rain droplets drip from the ceiling above.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Oh, man...
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: How's your great mood now?
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: INT. 6 TRAIN - DAY
text: A packed subway car. Zoe and Stan are back-to-back, pushed
text: together by the crowd. Zoe tries to read her paper.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: How `bout now?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Please stop talking to me.
scene_heading: INT. UNION SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - DAY
text: Zoe and Stan walk up the stairs a few feet apart from each
text: other. Zoe does her best to ignore the obvious.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: So, why are you in such a good mood
dialog: anyway?
text: They reach the top of the stairs. The rain has stopped, and
text: the sun is just starting to peek through. Everything is wet
dialog: and has a magical quality.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Not that it's any of your business,
dialog: but...good things are happening to
dialog: me.
text: Stan is moved by this. What a thing to say.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: That's nice. I hope it continues.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Thanks. Well, have a nice life.
dialog: Try not to steal any more cabs.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You do the same.
text: They nod and separate.
scene_heading: INT. HUDSON PETS - DAY
text: Hudson Pets is a small but quaint West Village pet store
text: filled with dogs, cats and a few rabbits.
text: Zoe enters. Her dog, NUTS, a raggedy, pug-like dog with hind
text: legs in a WHEELCHAIR, bounds/wheels towards her, barking.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Hey, Nutsy. How's it going?
text: She gives Nuts a good scratch. JALISA, mid-30s, Latina
text: hottie, and Bobby run from the back.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Oh, my God, you're glowing.
dialog: (to Jalisa)
dialog: She's glowing, right?
speaker_heading: JALISA
dialog: Glowing. Tell us everything.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Everything.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: There's not much to tell.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You just got shot up with a wad of
text: red-headed-freckle sperm. There's
dialog: something to tell.
speaker_heading: JALISA
dialog: He had red hair and freckles?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I tried to talk her out of it.
speaker_heading: JALISA
dialog: Why'd you do that, Mami?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (to Jalisa)
dialog: I know, right?
speaker_heading: JALISA
dialog: Red pubes. Eek...
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'm never going to see his pubes!
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You'll see your kid's pubes.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I doubt it.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: But you'll know they're there.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What is wrong with you?
speaker_heading: JALISA
dialog: So, what happened? Come on...
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I lay down, put my feet up, five
dialog: minutes later it was over. I
dialog: barely felt a thing.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Sounds like Ricardo.
speaker_heading: JALISA
dialog: Tell me about it, Papi.
text: Bobby and Jalisa high five. Bobby then turns to Zoe.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: So...what happens now?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Now, we wait.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That's no fun, I want to know if
dialog: I'm going to be a fairy godmother.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: We'll just have to wait and see.
text: Zoe smiles and heads for the back.
scene_heading: EXT. HUDSON PETS - NIGHT
text: The lights in the pet store go dark. Moments later, Zoe,
text: Bobby, Jalisa and Nuts exit.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Come on, Zoe, one drink. You can
dialog: have an O'Dhouls or something.
speaker_heading: JALISA
dialog: We'll go to the piano bar and get
text: Bobby to sing some Ace of Base.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Forget it, she's not coming. I can
text: tell by the dull look on her face.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Love you.
dialog: 13.
text: They all hug. Bobby and Jalisa walk away arm-in-arm,
dialog: singing.
speaker_heading: BOBBY/JALISA
text: I saw the sign and it opened up my
dialog: eyes, I saw the sign...
text: Zoe turns to lock up. While her back is turned, Stan appears
text: from the shadows.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Aahhh!
text: Zoe screams and drops the keys. Nuts, overexcited by Zoe's
text: reaction, starts to run/wheel in circles and then tips over.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: You scared the hell out of me!
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Oh, wow. Is he...okay?
text: Nuts is still on the ground, his wheels spinning. Zoe sets
text: him upright.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare
dialog: you. Or hurt your dog. Don't
dialog: worry, I'm not a stalker.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: How'd you know I worked here?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I followed you after the subway.
dialog: (thinks, then)
dialog: That sounds a little stalkery, huh?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I just really wanted to see you
dialog: again. Almost like I had to see
dialog: you again. Can I walk you home?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Is it me or does everything I say
dialog: make me sound more like a stalker?
dialog: 14.
text: Zoe allows a small smile.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I just give you my card? Here.
dialog: Take my card. I'm not a freak.
dialog: Really. I sell cheese.
text: This hangs out there for a beat.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Cheese?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Yeah. My family has a goat farm.
dialog: We make cheese. You like cheese?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I guess. I've never really thought
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Little Goat. Maybe you've seen us
dialog: at the Farmer's market? Come by
dialog: sometime and you can taste my
dialog: cheese.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Okay, I'm going to go. This has
dialog: not gone as planned.
text: Stan smiles meekly and then turns to go.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Bye.
text: Stan lifts his hand to wave but doesn't even turn around.
text: Clearly, he feels like an idiot. Zoe watches him go.
scene_heading: EXT. WEST VILLAGE BROWNSTONE - MORNING
text: Establishing shot of a cute brownstone with window boxes and
text: a front stoop. We TILT UP to the third floor window.
scene_heading: INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING
text: Zoe is asleep with the morning sun on her face. Nuts is
text: beside her, his two little, lame legs hanging off the pillow.
text: Zoe opens her eyes.
text: After a beat, she gets up and walks to the mirror. She lifts
text: up her pajama top and looks at her stomach, sticking it out
text: as far as it will go. It's flat as a board.
dialog: 15.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Seven WOMEN sit around the cramped living room of this small,
text: East Village apartment. At least one woman is nursing a
text: child that looks entirely too old to still be nursing.
scene_heading: This is the SINGLE MOTHERS BY CHOICE Support Group. CAROL,
text: 40's, short hair, tank top and no bra, is the leader.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Everyone, please say hello to Zoe.
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Hi, Zoe.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Welcome to Single Mother's By
dialog: Choice. As the name suggests, we
dialog: are all single mothers by choice.
dialog: Some of us have adopted, some
dialog: conceived with a donor, every story
text: is different, but with the same
dialog: common denominator. We wanted to
dialog: have a child, and we didn't need a
dialog: partner to make it happen.
text: The women smile and nod. They are a proud, no-nonsense,
text: somewhat masculine bunch. LORI, pregnant with a buzz cut,
text: turns to Zoe.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Are you a doer or a tryer?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Are you already a single mother or
dialog: are you trying to become one?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Oh, I guess I'm trying. I was just
dialog: inseminated a few days ago.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Inseminated...makes me feel like a
dialog: cow or something.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Well, when we don't have partners
dialog: with penises, we do what we've got
dialog: to do, right?
dialog: (then)
dialog: So, tell us a little bit about
dialog: yourself.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Okay. Let's see...um, I own a pet
dialog: store on Hudson Street. Dogs,
dialog: cats, rabbits...no birds, they
dialog: creep me out. Before that, I
dialog: worked for Google, which I
dialog: completely hated. One day, I
dialog: decided life was too short, and,
dialog: against my accountant's advice, I
dialog: quit Google, cashed out and bought
dialog: the pet store. Now I'm really
dialog: happy on the work front, but I
dialog: still haven't found, you know, the
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Ah, yes. The elusive "one."
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I always imagined I'd be married
dialog: with kids by now, but it doesn't
dialog: look like it's going to happen that
dialog: way. So, time for Plan B.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Society tells us we're supposed to
dialog: find that special person to make us
dialog: happy and complete. But guess
dialog: what...you have to create your own
dialog: happiness. You don't need someone
dialog: to complete you, some...man. You
dialog: already are complete.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Amen, sister.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: If you want to have a baby, we here
dialog: at Single Mothers By Choice can be
dialog: your partners. We will be your
dialog: emotional rocks.
text: Zoe looks around at her new "partners." There's SARA, the
text: one nursing the toddler. And TABITHA, a tall women with an
text: even taller afro and a nose ring. BRIDGET, a young girl
text: covered in tatoos. And several more...
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: From inception to college
dialog: graduation and everything in
dialog: between. We're here for each
dialog: other.
text: Sara smiles and nods at her nursing child.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Dakota was actually born right here
dialog: in this very room. Right where
dialog: you're sitting, actually.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (uncomfortable)
dialog: Really? Right here? Imagine that.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Best day of my life.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: And how old is she now?
text: Dakota looks up from the breast.
speaker_heading: DAKOTA
dialog: I'm three.
scene_heading: INT. LE PAIN QUOTIDIEN - DAY
text: Zoe and Mona are sitting by the window sharing a plate of
text: pastries and a pot of coffee.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Why did you join a support group of
dialog: unattractive, militant lesbians
dialog: when you have me?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Because you're really not that
dialog: supportive.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Sure I am.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: You just told me that if I breast-
dialog: feed "my girls" will end up looking
text: like empty tube socks.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: I'm just being honest. And don't
dialog: even get me started on what
dialog: childbirth does to your bladder.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What does it do to your bladder?
text: Mona cracks up and then stops abruptly.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: I just peed a little bit.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I don't think I'm pregnant. The
dialog: doctor says it will probably take
dialog: several tries. Something about
dialog: frozen sperm being lazy.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Good. Take your time.
text: Zoe takes a sip of coffee and looks out the window.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: So, should I call this guy? Do you
dialog: think that would be weird?
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Do I think it's weird that you're
dialog: pursuing someone at the exact
dialog: moment in time that you might be
dialog: most unavailable? No. Because
dialog: that's what you do. You sabotage.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (ignoring her)
text: He works at the Farmer's market.
text: And it's right around the corner.
dialog: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: I look fat and old?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Then, no.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Let's go spy on him. Come on. It
dialog: will be fun. Like high school.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: I can't.
dialog: (checks watch)
dialog: This twenty minute breakfast
dialog: concludes my "me" time for the
dialog: week. More proof that you should
dialog: not have kids.
dialog: 19.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - DAY
text: The Farmer's Market is crowded with people. We hear the
text: sounds of a bluegrass band playing somewhere nearby.
text: Zoe spies the LITTLE GOAT sign. But Stan is not there. She
text: looks around the neighboring stalls for him, but no luck.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Oh, well.
text: She walks towards 14th street. We see the bluegrass band on
text: the steps by the subway station. It's not a big band, just a
text: few guys with an open banjo case and a sign that reads, "The
text: Organics." The country twang of the music is in sharp
text: contrast with the tall buildings all around.
text: As she gets closer, she notices that Stan is in the band.
text: He's playing banjo.
text: Zoe quickly ducks into the nearest food stall, OLIVIA'S
text: BERRIES. OLIVIA, mid-twenties, natural beauty, approaches.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: No, I'm fine.
text: Zoe watches Stan. She mindlessly starts eating some
text: blueberries out of the display pint. Olivia sees that Zoe is
text: looking at Stan.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Tasty, huh?
text: Zoe nods and takes another berry.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA (CONT'D)
text: All ripe and juicy. And firm, too.
dialog: Bet you could just eat him up in
dialog: one bite, right?
text: Zoe now turns, confused.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: And don't look now, but he's coming
dialog: this way.
dialog: 20.
text: Olivia winks and moves off. Zoe turns back and is now face-
text: to-face with Stan, who's smiling from ear-to-ear, his banjo
text: slung over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: A-ha! I didn't scare you away
dialog: after all.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (trying to be casual)
dialog: I was just in the neighborhood. I
dialog: thought I'd come by and get some
dialog: blueberries. I'm going to make a
dialog: pie.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I love blueberry pie.
text: Stan takes two pints of blueberries and hands them to Zoe.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'm confused. I thought you made
dialog: cheese or something.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: What makes you think I don't?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I don't know, you're over there
text: playing the banjo.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Can't someone do both?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Honestly, I didn't know anyone did
dialog: either.
text: Olivia returns.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Aren't you going to introduce me to
dialog: your new friend?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Nope.
dialog: (to Zoe)
dialog: Come on. Let me show you around.
text: Stan puts his arm around Zoe and leads her away. Olivia
text: watches them go with her arms crossed.
dialog: 21.
scene_heading: EXT. THE LITTLE GOAT CHEESE STAND - LATER
text: Stan walks Zoe through his cheese stand.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: This is our basic chevre, probably
dialog: our best seller. The cheese that
dialog: started it all, as they say. Then
dialog: over here we have our surface-
dialog: ripened cheeses. These are the
dialog: aged/raw milk cheeses.
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: This is really boring, huh?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No, not at all.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: It's like you're in a foreign
dialog: country and the only thing to watch
text: on tv is a documentary on cheese.
dialog: You don't want to watch it, but
dialog: somehow you can't stop...
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I think it's interesting. Really.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: All right, you asked for it...
dialog: (boring voice)
dialog: The aged/raw milk cheeses are made
dialog: from raw milk and then aged for
dialog: four to six months. Sometimes
dialog: more. Sometimes less. Usually
dialog: more. Depends on the cheese.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Stop. You're killing me.
text: FRED, early twenties, white guy with Rasta-type dreads, looks
text: up from behind the counter.
speaker_heading: STAN
text: Fred, Zoe, Zoe, Fred.
dialog: (then)
dialog: She's the one I followed from the
dialog: subway the other day like a total
dialog: psychopath.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Right...I heard about you.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I don't know whether to be
dialog: flattered or terrified.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Be afraid.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Don't scare her away. I'm trying
dialog: to redeem myself.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Then you should put down the banjo.
dialog: You look like a doofus.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Doofus?
dialog: (then, to Zoe)
dialog: Do you think I look like a doofus?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I don't really know what a doofus
dialog: looks like.
text: Fred points to Stan.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Okay. If I put the banjo down, can
dialog: I take you to lunch or something?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I should really get back to work.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Come on, say the word and we can
dialog: have a six-course tasting menu at
dialog: Union Square Cafe. I know the
dialog: chef.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: That sounds nice, but, I should
dialog: probably go.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Well, can I call you?
text: Zoe smiles.
scene_heading: INT. HUDSON PETS - DAY
text: Zoe enters the pet store with two big bags of vegetables. As
text: soon as she steps foot in the store, Bobby and Jalisa accost
dialog: her.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Okay, spill it.
speaker_heading: JALISA
dialog: Who is he? What does he do? How
dialog: do we know him?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: JALISA
dialog: Stan from the Farmer's Market?
dialog: He's called twice already.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Is he a farmer? Because that's not
dialog: okay.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No. He makes cheese.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: He's a pilgrim?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I don't know what he is. He's cute
text: and different and plays the banjo.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I think I like him.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What about the, you know, bun in
dialog: the oven?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I really doubt I'm pregnant.
speaker_heading: JALISA
dialog: You want to be pregnant. You don't
dialog: want to be pregnant. I'm confused.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I want to be pregnant. Of course I
dialog: want to be pregnant. I mean, I put
dialog: a lot of thought into this, right?
dialog: (then)
dialog: So what did Stan say?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: He says to name any restaurant you
dialog: want to go to.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: He'll be there with bells on.
dialog: (then)
dialog: He didn't say the "bells on" part.
dialog: I added that. Sounds a little too
dialog: gay, though, so I take it back.
scene_heading: EXT. 8TH STREET - NIGHT
text: Zoe walks down 8th street. This is the first time we've seen
text: her really pulled together, and she looks hot. She turns
text: into the restaurant she's chosen for the big date.
scene_heading: INT. GRAY'S PAPAYA HOT DOGS - NIGHT
text: Zoe and Stan stand at the counter with an array of hot dogs
text: in front of them. Stan looks at the hot dogs skeptically.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: We could have gone anywhere.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Just take a bite. You'll see.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Per Se, Jean Georges, Nobu...
speaker_heading: ZOE
text: Gray's Papaya. Cheers.
text: She clinks his dog and then they each take a bite.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Good, right?
text: Stan nods, covering his mouth because the bite is so big.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: You've lived here your whole life
dialog: and never been to Gray's Papaya.
dialog: What's wrong with you?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I actually haven't lived here my
dialog: whole life. We moved out of the
dialog: city when my parents bought the
dialog: farm....not died, but actually
dialog: bought a farm and moved upstate.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: That must have been a nice place to
text: grow up. On a farm.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: What about your family?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: It's just me and my grandmother.
text: She lives in a retirement community
dialog: in Queens.
dialog: (an awkward beat)
dialog: My parents died when I was young.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I'm so sorry.
text: There is a long silence. They both stare at the hot dogs.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know what to say now. I've
dialog: made it all awkward and sad.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: It's okay.
dialog: (then)
dialog: My dad was kind of a bad guy,
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Shit. I'm so sorry, Zoe.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No, come on, we'll get all this
dialog: stuff out of the way so we never
dialog: have to talk about it again. Let's
dialog: ask all the awkward, get-to-know-
dialog: you questions right now.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Okay. Good idea.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Let's see...are you religious?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Nope. What about you?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Have you ever been married?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Aren't you sick of going to
dialog: weddings?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: If I have to listen to one more
dialog: couple write their own vows...
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I hate when they write their own
dialog: vows!
text: They clasp hands. Not in a high-fivey way, but in a
dialog: connected, we have so much in common way. Their hands stay
text: together, feeling the charge between them.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What about kids?
text: Zoe feels the blood rush to her cheeks. Like everyone there
text: must now be looking at her.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What about them?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Well, do you want them?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Yeah. I want kids.
text: She pulls her hand away. This has all gotten suddenly real.
text: She looks at Stan, almost afraid to ask the next question.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Yeah. Absolutely.
text: Zoe nods. Slowly, she starts to breathe again.
scene_heading: EXT. PERRY STREET - NIGHT
text: They are now walking home together, arm-in-arm.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Okay, first kiss...
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Jen Salzer. Seventh grade. She
dialog: wore a head-gear. What about you?
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Summer camp. I think his name was--
text: Stan interrupts by kissing her. And it's a great kiss. Full
text: of promises and answers. They linger there for a moment...
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: That was way better.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: When can I see you again?
text: Zoe feels her heart jump. She kisses him again.
scene_heading: INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Zoe is lying in bed with Nuts on the pillow next to her. The
text: sun is shining and they are both waking up.
text: She gets up and goes to the mirror. She lifts up her
text: nightgown and looks at her stomach, this time with a slight
text: look of concern on her face.
scene_heading: INT. EQUINOX - DAY
text: Zoe and Mona are side-by-side on the elliptical machines.
text: Zoe is going very fast, while Mona is barely moving at all.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What if I'm pregnant?
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Then you'll get fat and hormonal
dialog: and I'll say, "I told you so."
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: But what if this could go somewhere
dialog: with Stan? Like, really go
dialog: somewhere.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Then it will work out perfectly.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Because just when you really like
dialog: him, you'll break up because you're
dialog: pregnant and then you never have to
dialog: put yourself out there and possibly
dialog: get hurt. That's your dream.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (thinks, then)
dialog: I'm not pregnant.
text: She gets off the machine.
scene_heading: INT. EQUINOX STEAM ROOM - DAY
text: We are in a foggy steam room with Zoe, Mona and a few other
speaker_heading: WOMEN.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: So, when are you seeing him again?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Tonight.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Well, don't have sex with him.
dialog: That's the last thing we need. You
dialog: get knocked up and we'll have no
dialog: idea who the father is.
text: A few women look over.
speaker_heading: MONA (CONT'D)
dialog: And then we'll have to do a
dialog: paternity test. Is it the cheese
dialog: farmer or the red-pubed bandit?
text: More women look over.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'm not going to have sex with him
dialog: tonight. It's too soon.
dialog: (for the women's benefit)
dialog: I'm not a slut.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Well, bring condoms, just in case.
dialog: (thinks, then)
dialog: And a pregnancy test.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Very funny.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: I'm not joking.
text: All of the women are now staring at Zoe.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'm really not a slut.
dialog: 29.
scene_heading: INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Zoe sits on the bed, holding a pregnancy test in her hands.
text: Nuts is beside her. He looks up at her.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: There's no way, right?
scene_heading: INT. ZOE'S BATHEROOM - NIGHT
text: Zoe pees on the stick. Nuts is beside her, watching with his
text: head tilted.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Stop looking at me like that. I'm
dialog: not pregnant.
text: Zoe finishes peeing and looks at the test. Nothing yet.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, come on, come on...
text: We hear the doorbell RING.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit.
text: Zoe looks down at the test. Still nothing. We wait and
text: watch the test. The doorbell RINGS again.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit!
text: A faint PLUS SIGN is forming.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Shitshitshitshit...
text: The plus sign then turns BRIGHT PINK. Zoe's heart stops.
text: There it is. Plain as day. Pregnant.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: No, shit.
text: Zoe stands. Looks at herself in the mirror. And then...
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Holy fucking shit!
dialog: 30.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI - NIGHT
text: Manhattan fades into the distance, as they drive over the
text: Brooklyn Bridge. Zoe cracks the window.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Are you feeling okay?
text: Zoe nods. Her face looks pale.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Good, because this should really
dialog: be a culinary adventure. This is
text: an underground restaurant that
dialog: moves from apartment to apartment,
dialog: depending on the chef.
text: Zoe nods again. Hasn't heard a word he's said. She rolls
text: the window all the way down and hangs her head out.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: And some of the guys from the band
dialog: will be there. So, we might get a
dialog: little jam going. Sounds fun,
dialog: right?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Zoe?
text: Zoe's POV. Headlights from passing cars whiz by, and the
text: wind swirls her hair into her face. Brooklyn approaches like
text: a bad dream.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Stan walks down a long table filled with appetizers. He is
text: making a plate for each of them. Zoe trails behind, beads of
text: sweat on her forehead.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: And this looks like a mache salad
dialog: with grapes and feta.
text: He takes some for each of them.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: And this, oh this must be white
dialog: beans and lamb's tongue. You've
dialog: got to have some of this. Etienne
text: is famous for his lamb's tongue.
text: Olivia approaches.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Hey, stranger.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Oh, hey, Olivia. You remember Zoe.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Right. How'd that blueberry pie
dialog: turn out?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: You bought blueberries from me?
dialog: Said you were going to make a pie?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Um, can you excuse me for a second?
text: Zoe hurries off. Olivia watches her go. Eyes narrowing.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: No way she knows how to bake a pie.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Zoe hovers by the window, whispering into the phone.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'm pregnant.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (O.S.)
dialog: What?! Where are you? I'm on my
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Brooklyn.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (O.S.)
dialog: Where's that?
text: Zoe hangs up the phone.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Zoe is now on the phone with Mona.
speaker_heading: MONA (O.S.)
dialog: Don't panic. Could be a false
dialog: positive. Take another test.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I can't. I'm at some underground
dialog: foodie party in Brooklyn. Where am
dialog: I gonna--
text: Out the window and across the street, we see a drugstore.
scene_heading: INT. DRUGSTORE - NIGHT
text: Zoe runs down the aisle and empties one, two, three...what
dialog: the fuck, every pregnancy test into her basket.
text: Her cell phone RINGS. It's Bobby. She picks it up.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (O.S.)
dialog: Okay, I'm looking at a subway map.
dialog: Which way is Brooklyn?
text: She hangs up again.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Zoe hurries through the living room, a packed drugstore bag
text: hidden under her arm. Stan comes up behind her.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Where have you been?
text: Zoe jumps and accidentally drops the bag. The tests spill
text: out onto the floor. She quickly scoops everything back in.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Sorry. You scared me.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Did you just go to the store?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Yeah, I had a little emergency. I
dialog: have a, a, um...corn, and I needed
dialog: to get those little...corn pads.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Corn pads?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I know, it's gross. Do you know
dialog: where the bathroom is?
text: Zoe walks off leaving him to ponder.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: What's a corn pad?
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Zoe pees on eight sticks at once.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Corn pad? What the hell is wrong
dialog: with you?
text: Someone KNOCKS on the door.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Corn pad. Jesus Christ.
text: The knocking turns to an angry BANGING.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Relax! I'll be out in...
dialog: (checks box)
text: Three to five minutes.
text: Zoe holds up the tests. One by one, the little windows all
text: show PLUS SIGNS and CHECK MARKS and DOUBLE HASH MARKS.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Zoe exits the bathroom with a wide-eyed, terrified look on
text: her face. By the bar, she sees a PREGNANT WOMAN sipping a
text: glass of wine. She rushes over.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Excuse me, are you allowed to drink
dialog: when you're...
text: Zoe makes hand motions at her belly, but can't say the word.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: You know...
text: More hand gestures.
speaker_heading: PREGNANT WOMAN
dialog: Pregnant?
dialog: (off Zoe's nod)
dialog: My doctor says one glass is--
text: Zoe doesn't wait for her to finish. She rushes the bar,
text: pours a glass of wine and downs it like a frat boy funneling
dialog: a beer.
dialog: 34.
text: Outside, we hear a banjo and guitar tuning up.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK PATIO - SAME
text: Stan, JERRY and SCOOTER are just starting to play. A small
text: crowd gathers round. Stan starts to sing an old tune called
dialog: "Sweet Little Miss Blue Eyes."
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Who makes me forget all the other
dialog: girls I met, sweet, little Miss
dialog: Blue Eyes. Who's sweeter to me,
dialog: than she really ought to be, sweet
dialog: little Miss Blue Eyes.
text: Zoe appears at the door to the patio. Stan smiles at her
text: while he sings.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Who's gonna start takin' care of my
dialog: heart, she makes me realize. And
dialog: it's lucky for me and I really want
dialog: to be with...
dialog: (winks at Zoe)
dialog: sweet, little Miss--
text: Stan's POV as Zoe covers her mouth with two hands and bolts
text: for the bathroom, puking.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Blue eyes?
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Zoe's head is in the toilet. Just when we think she's done,
text: she pukes again. Finally, she lifts her head.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Ohhhhhhhh.
text: She spies an unused pregnancy test on the floor. One that
dialog: must have dropped. Maybe this will be the one with the
text: answer she's looking for. She sits back on the toilet,
text: mustering up all of her focus to pee again. She closes her
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Please, God...
text: But she can't pee. She tries and tries.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Water, water everywhere, but not a
dialog: drop to...
text: She doubles over and pukes between her knees. When she's
text: done, she holds up the test.
text: CU of the stick, which has no pee on it but is covered in
text: vomit. Slowly the test reveals a PLUS SIGN.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck me.
scene_heading: EXT. PERRY STREET - NIGHT
text: Stan and Zoe walk towards Zoe's brownstone. Stan is
text: practically holding her up. Zoe stumbles along.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: My singing made you vomit.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No. It's not that.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Sure, we were a little out of tune,
dialog: but...
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I really don't feel well.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Is it your corns? Hurts to walk?
text: ANGLE on Carol, from Single Mother's By Choice, approaching.
text: Zoe's face pales.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Zoe?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Wow. Hi. Hey, there...
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Where have you been? You haven't
dialog: been coming to any--
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (cutting her off)
dialog: Right. I know. I've been so busy.
dialog: Next one, I'm there. For sure.

dialog: This is my friend, Stan.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (eyeing Stan suspiciously)
dialog: Hello. Are you two--
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Late. Yes. We are. We really
dialog: are.
dialog: (pushing Stan along)
dialog: I'll see you at the meeting. Bye.
text: They walk on. Stan looks at Zoe.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: An old...boyfriend?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Her name is Carol. We're on
dialog: a...committee together.
text: They reach Zoe's front stoop. Zoe peers over Stan's shoulder
dialog: to make sure Carol's gone.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: All right. I have to go to bed
dialog: now. I'll call you, okay?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Hey, I was thinking, if you don't
dialog: have any plans this weekend, maybe
dialog: you'd like to come up to the farm
dialog: and get away for a few days.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'll call you tomorrow.
dialog: Something's not agreeing with me.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Was it the lamb's tongue?
text: Zoe runs inside holding her hand over her mouth. Stan stands
text: there for a beat. He calls after her.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, well...this weekend. Think
dialog: about it.
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: ZOE

scene_heading: EXT. SHADYBROOK RETIREMENT COMMUNITY - DAY
text: Establishing shot of a retirement compound in Queens.
scene_heading: INT. SHADYBROOK LOBBY - DAY
text: The lobby is well-appointed and cheery. A young STAFF works
text: behind a front desk area. Were it not for a scattering of
text: PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS, you might think we were at a Ramada.
text: Zoe walks by the front desk. ANNIE, an employee, looks up.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Hi, Zoe. You look fantastic.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I don't know how that's possible.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Something's different. Did you get
dialog: highlights or a spray tan? Your
text: face looks like it's...
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Please don't say glowing.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yes! Exactly!
scene_heading: EXT. SHADYBROOK COURTYARD - LATER

speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Morning, Arthur.

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Hello, my dear!

speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No, no, no, don't get up.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Good, because I can't get up. Came

speaker_heading: ZOE

speaker_heading: NANA

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: That's what I'm talking about.
dialog: Work it.
text: Horrified, Zoe quickly runs after Nana.
scene_heading: EXT. SHADYBROOK COURTYARD - LATER
text: Zoe is now speed walking with the ladies. She mimics the
text: same strong arm movements and heel-toe foot action.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: Do you want a nose guard? I have
dialog: an extra.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No, I'm fine.
speaker_heading: SHIRLEY
dialog: Are you sure? Ethel Silverbeck
dialog: just had another carcinoma removed
text: from her nose.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (to Nana)
dialog: I kind of need to talk to you.
dialog: Alone.
dialog: 39.
text: Nana gives her friends a nod, and they fall back several
text: paces. Zoe waits for them to be out of earshot.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: Don't worry, they can't hear
dialog: anything anyway.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'm pregnant.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: (can't hear her)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'm pregnant.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'm pregnant.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: I can't hear you, darling.
speaker_heading: SHIRLEY
dialog: Jesus, Judy, she's pregnant. Turn
dialog: your hearing aide up.
text: Zoe closes her eyes. Nightmare.
scene_heading: INT. NANA'S ROOM - LATER
text: Nana hands Zoe a cup of tea. Zoe's eyes well with tears.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What am I going to do?
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: I'm confused. Isn't this what you
dialog: wanted? You bought sperm and were
dialog: inseminated by your doctor. This
dialog: isn't what we would call an
dialog: accident.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: But now it's all happening so fast.
dialog: Did I really think this through?
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: We talked about it for months. You
dialog: said it was what you wanted more
dialog: than anything in the world.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: But this guy, he's...special. It's
text: all going to fall apart now.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: What makes him so special?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I don't know. He's very...real.
dialog: And funny. And different. The
dialog: other guys I've been with all had
dialog: their briefcases and their five-
dialog: year plans and their secretaries
dialog: they were fucking. Stan doesn't
dialog: have a five-year plan. I don't
dialog: even know if he has a plan.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: What about a secretary?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Some kid named Fred.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I like him, Nana.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: Well, if he's the right one, he'll
dialog: stay.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Do you really think so?
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: Gosh, I don't know. I hoped that
dialog: would be enough to appease you.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Should I still visit him for the
dialog: weekend? Or should I just vanish
dialog: and hope he forgets I ever existed.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: Don't be silly. Go up there for
dialog: the weekend. Spend some time with
dialog: him and see what he's really like.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Yeah. You're right.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: You might find out he's a total
dialog: douchebag and then the whole thing
dialog: is moot.
text: Zoe looks at Nana. Douchebag?
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY
text: Zoe is in the car. We are CLOSE on her as she talks rapidly
text: and a bit maniacally.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Okay, so we'll just hope that he's
dialog: a douchebag. Could happen, right?
text: WIDEN to reveal Nuts in the passenger seat. He's yawning.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry. Am I keeping you up?
text: Nuts closes his eyes and lays down.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: My whole life is falling apart and
dialog: you can't keep your bug-eyes open?
dialog: (yawning)
dialog: Thanks. Now I'm yawning. But why
dialog: am I so tired? I slept nine hours.
dialog: (thinks, then)
dialog: And I'm starving, too. What the
dialog: hell is going on?
text: Zoe sees a gas station and jams on the breaks.
scene_heading: INT. GAS STATION MINI MART - DAY
text: Zoe pours a massive cup of coffee. One of those gas station
text: Big Gulp cups. Even the TRUCKER next to her chooses a
text: smaller cup. Then, a look crosses her face.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Am I even allowed to drink coffee?
text: The trucker looks at her. She looks at him.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know anything about being
dialog: pregnant?
dialog: 42.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR - LATER
text: Zoe's car is now parked on the side of a highway in the
text: middle of nowhere.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - SAME
text: Zoe is sound asleep with her head back and her mouth open. A
text: small, empty coffee cup in her hand, crumpled candy bar
text: wrappers on the floor, and an almost empty bag of Cheetos is
text: in her lap.
text: Her cell phone RINGS. Zoe doesn't move. After the third
text: ring, she lifts her head and looks around. It takes her a
text: few moments to realize what's happened. She looks at the
text: little coffee cup.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Thanks a lot, decaf.
text: She picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: STAN (O.S.)
dialog: Where are you?
text: Zoe looks around.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I have no idea.
scene_heading: EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - DAY
text: Zoe bumps along the winding driveway of this idyllic Hudson
text: River farm. There are red barns in the distance and green
text: pastures filled with goats and sheep. The house is an old
text: carriage house with a rusty weather-vane on top.
text: Zoe parks the car and takes in the whole scene. Stan opens
text: the front door, with a huge smile on his face. Zoe sighs.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: He's so not a douchebag.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: They enter the front door. Zoe takes in the charming
text: carriage house.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I can't believe you live here.
dialog: This is ridiculous.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I just come on weekends. My
dialog: parents really live here.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Oh. Where are they now?
speaker_heading: STAN
text: In the kitchen.
text: Zoe stops short.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Wait, they're here? Now? Is this
dialog: a "meet the parents" kind of thing?
dialog: I wasn't prepared for this.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: No. Not at all. I mean, you'll
dialog: meet them, but--
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: When you said come up for the
dialog: weekend, I assumed it was just us.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I think I need to lay down.
scene_heading: INT. STAN'S BEDROM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Zoe lies in the small bed with the covers pulled up to her
text: chin. Stan stands above her with an odd look on his face.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Are you hung-over or something?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'm just...not myself. Give me ten
text: minutes. A ten-minute power nap
dialog: and I'm good. I need to regroup.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Are you sure you're okay?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Zoe? Hello?
text: But she's already out. Stan gives her a little poke.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Stan enters the kitchen. His parents, JOAN and EDWARD look
text: up expectantly, as if about to meet their new daughter-in-
dialog: law.
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Oh. It's just you.
speaker_heading: STAN
text: She's taking a nap.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: A nap? Now? She just got here.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Mom, I need you to not be
dialog: judgemental, okay. I like this
dialog: girl a lot.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: How can I be judgemental? We
dialog: haven't even met her yet.
text: We hear a SQUEAK, SQUEAK, SQUEAK coming down the hall.
speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What the heck is that?
text: The SQUEAKING continues and then all eyes turn as Nuts rolls
text: into the kitchen and stops. He tilts his head.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Oh. This is Nuts.
text: Joan and Edward take in the raggedy/wheelchair-bound dog and
text: then look at Stan. Stan shoots his mom a look.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Who's judging?!
scene_heading: INT. STAN'S BEDROOM - LATER
text: It's now dark. Zoe is asleep in the exact same position.
text: Suddenly, we hear a loud GRUMBLE. Her eyes open.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What was that?
text: We hear the GRUMBLE again. It's her stomach. She puts her
text: hands over it.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoa.
text: Zoe gets out of bed and goes right for the Cheetos. The bag
text: is empty. She smears her hand on the inside of the bag and
text: then licks the orange cheese from her fingers.
dialog: 45.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Zoe peeks out of the bedroom and looks both ways.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Stan?
text: No one in sight. She waits a beat and then whispers louder.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Stan!
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Zoe peers her head into the empty kitchen. Nuts is with her.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Stan? Hello?
text: Zoe stands there unsure of what to do next. Then we hear her
text: stomach GROWL again. Her eyes turn to the stove. Something
text: smells out of this world. She tiptoes over and opens the
dialog: pot. It's beef stew.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, my God.
text: She makes sure the coast is clear and then looks for a spoon.
text: She can't find one. She spies a loaf of white bread. Grabs
text: a piece, folds it and then scoops up a heaping bite of stew
text: and devours it.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: (mouth full)
dialog: Oh, my God.
text: She replaces the lid on the pot. And now she just stands
text: there. And stands there some more.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, who am I kidding?
text: She quickly takes two slices of bread and goes back in. This
text: time, she uses one piece of bread as a ladle and then the
text: other to turn it into a sandwich. She takes a huge bite.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh. My. God.
text: Stew dribbles down her chin. She takes a third piece of
text: bread to wipe her face and then takes a bite of that one.
dialog: 46.
text: Nuts starts to whine and beg. Zoe uses her bread-ladle to
text: toss some stew on the floor for him. It lands with plop.
text: And now Joan enters. Zoe and Nuts turn, their mouths
text: bursting. Joan doesn't quite know what to do. All she knows
dialog: is she's supposed to be open-minded.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Would you like a plate?
text: Zoe shakes her head no. Wow. This is embarrassing.
speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: A napkin?
text: Zoe nods her head. Joan gives her one. Zoe holds it over
text: her mouth as she tries in vain to swallow this inhuman bite.
speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm Joan.
text: Zoe nods. Still can't swallow the bite.
speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: And you must be Zoe.
text: Zoe nods again. She tries to shake Joan's hand. It's the
text: best she can do. Unfortunately, her fingers are fluorescent
text: orange from the Cheetos powder. Joan pulls her hand back.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - LATER
text: The dining room is warm and lovely. There's faded wallpaper
text: and an old stagecoach lamp serving as a chandelier. Despite
text: the inviting room, Zoe looks very uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: The stew is delicious, honey.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Yeah, Mom, it's awesome.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (to Zoe)
dialog: Have you ever in your life had stew
dialog: like this? Come on, be honest.
text: Zoe looks at Joan. Joan smiles. It will be their secret.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Uh...no. Never.
dialog: 47.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: They are having coffee and dessert in the living room.
text: Things seem more comfortable now. Zoe actually looks like
text: she might be enjoying herself. Nuts sits beside her.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: So are all the animals in your pet
dialog: store...differently abled?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Oh, you can say paralyzed. He
dialog: doesn't mind.
dialog: (then)
dialog: No, our pets are all in great
dialog: shape. Purebreads mostly, but not
dialog: from puppy mills.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Those puppy mills are terrible. I
dialog: read about them in the paper.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Well, that's actually how I ended
dialog: up with Nuts. I bought him from
dialog: this pet store near my house. Six
dialog: months later, I had thousands of
dialog: dollars in vet bills and had to put
text: him in a wheelchair.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You should have sued that place.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I thought about it, but what was
dialog: that really going to do? They were
dialog: still going to sell inbred dogs.
dialog: So...I took the money I made when I
dialog: left Google and just bought the
dialog: place figuring I would do better.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You worked for Google?
text: Zoe nods.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: How could I not know that?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: You never asked.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: And you made a lot of money and
dialog: then bought a pet store?
text: Stan puts his arm around her and gives her a squeeze.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I love that.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: It's been fun. Beats brand
dialog: management, that's for sure.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (to Edward)
dialog: That sounds like us, honey.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: It's true.
dialog: (to Zoe)
dialog: When we bought this farm we just
dialog: wanted to make cheese because we
dialog: couldn't find anything we liked in
dialog: the stores. And now, twenty years
dialog: later, here we are...
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Sometimes in life you just have to
dialog: take matters into your own hands.
dialog: Make things happen your own way,
dialog: you know?
text: Zoe forces a smile. If only they knew.
scene_heading: EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - NIGHT
text: The moon is full and fireflies dot the air as Zoe and Stan
dialog: walk the grounds of the farm.
text: Nuts trots/rolls ahead of them in a different wheelchair.
text: This one is more rugged, with mountain-bike-type wheels.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I can't believe that Nuts has an
text: off-road wheelchair.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: He's got one for snow, too. With
text: little skis on the bottom.
text: Stan smiles and shakes his head.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You're really something.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Are you making fun of me? Do you
dialog: think I spoil him?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: No, I really think you're amazing.
dialog: I mean, that story you told
dialog: tonight. You just quit your whole
dialog: professional life because of this
dialog: little dog? Started your own
dialog: business, just like that?
text: Zoe shrugs.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You're very...unique.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Well, you're a dime a dozen. I
dialog: can't tell you how many banjo
dialog: playing, cheese makers I've been
dialog: with.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I keep waiting for the other shoe
dialog: to drop. Like, how can you be so
dialog: perfect? Why are you even still
dialog: single? I can't believe no one's
dialog: snatched you up by now.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I drive them all away, I guess.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Yeah, right.
text: Stan takes her in his arms.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, I know this is all going
dialog: fast...the time we're spending
dialog: together, meeting my parents and
dialog: everything...but, I'm okay with
dialog: that. I want it to go fast.
speaker_heading: ZOE
text: It is going fast.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: But isn't that okay? Aren't we old
dialog: enough to skip all the bullshit?
dialog: What are we waiting for? I...want
dialog: to be with you.
text: Zoe opens her mouth. She's got to tell him. Before this
text: goes any further, she has to tell him.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Stan.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Come on. There's something I want
dialog: to show you.
scene_heading: INT. CHEESE CAVE - NIGHT
text: It's floor to ceiling wooden shelves all filled with cheese.
text: Stan ceremoniously unwraps a wheel.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: It's cheese.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I can see that.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: It's a new kind of goat's milk
dialog: we're using. I've been developing
dialog: the recipe, and now it needs to
dialog: age. It'll be ready for market in
dialog: several months.
dialog: (then, excited)
dialog: Want to know what it's called?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Zoe.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: You named a piece of cheese after
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Not just one piece. The whole
dialog: line. This will forever in history
dialog: be known as the Zoe.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Unless, of course, it tastes like
dialog: shit, and then we'll just scrap it.
dialog: (with a wink)
dialog: But that'll never happen.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Because it's going to be fantastic.
text: Sweet and sassy and very complex.
dialog: Why do you think I'm calling it
dialog: Zoe?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No one's ever named a piece of
dialog: cheese after me before.
text: Zoe stares at the cheese for a long time.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You're kind of hard to read right
dialog: now. You're either seriously
text: flattered or totally repulsed.
text: Zoe smiles.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I want to kiss you right now, but
dialog: it really smells like cheese in
dialog: here.
scene_heading: EXT. DAIRY - MOMENTS LATER
text: The door to the dairy kicks open and Stan carries Zoe out.
text: Her legs are around his waist and they are making out like
dialog: crazy.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Stan carries Zoe up the stairs. They are tripping and
text: kissing and now tearing at each other's clothes.
scene_heading: INT. STAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Stan throws Zoe on the bed and then peels off his shirt. His
text: body looks amazing in the shadowy moonlight. Zoe lies there,
text: looking at him before he jumps on top of her.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: You're such a douchebag.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: What?
text: Zoe shakes her head and then melts into him.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. STAN'S ROOM - LATER
text: They are now on their backs staring at the ceiling. They
text: look happy and worn out
text: Their P.O.V. Those little glow-in-the-dark star stickers are
text: all over the ceiling. There's barely any glow left.
text: Stan lets out a big sigh as he looks at the "stars"...
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: That was amazing. I mean, like,
dialog: totally and exceptionally, over-the-
dialog: top, amazing.
text: Zoe turns to him. Takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Stan.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: There's something I really have to
dialog: tell you.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: There's something I have to tell
dialog: you, too.
text: Now Stan turns to her. They are face-to-face.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I go first? `Cause if we're
dialog: going to say the same thing, I want
dialog: to say it first.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: We're not going to say the same
dialog: thing.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Well, let me go, because this is
dialog: really embarrassing, and I just
dialog: have to say it.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I've dated a lot of women. I mean,
dialog: not tons, but a lot. And, the
dialog: thing is, I've never...been in love
dialog: before. I've never even told
dialog: anyone I love them before. Because
dialog: I just never felt it. But from the
dialog: day we met, from the first time our
dialog: backs accidentally touched in the
dialog: subway, I feel this, this...
dialog: (he shakes his head)
dialog: Maybe this is too much to say right
dialog: now, but...I love you, Zoe. I
dialog: really do.
text: Stan finishes. He looks at her and smiles. Zoe just stares
text: at him.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: In my mind, you were supposed to
dialog: say, I love you, too.
text: Instead, Zoe covers her mouth and runs to the bathroom. A
text: beat later, we hear her vomit.
scene_heading: INT. STAN'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Zoe is at the sink, furiously brushing her teeth. Stan
text: enters.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Zoe?
text: He looks at her. Sees the tears in her eyes.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Why are you crying? Everything's
dialog: perfect.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: It's not.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Sure it is.
dialog: 54.
text: Zoe takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'm pregnant.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Uh, I'm pretty sure it doesn't
dialog: happen that fast.
text: Zoe shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I just found out.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Pregnant? As in you're going to
dialog: have a baby?
text: Zoe nods.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I know. It's hard to explain.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Well, who's it?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I don't know who the father is. I
dialog: kind of know him. I just don't
dialog: know his name exactly. It was sort
dialog: of anonymous.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Anonymous?
speaker_heading: ZOE
text: He's a donor. From a sperm bank.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Seriously, what the fuck are you
dialog: talking about? Sperm bank? What?
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I know, this is so fucked up.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: When did all of this happen?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: The day we met. That same day.
dialog: And I didn't tell you because I
dialog: didn't think there was any way I
dialog: could be pregnant.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: But...why?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Because supposedly with frozen
dialog: sperm it takes a few tries and...
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: No, why would you do this?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Because I wanted a baby. And I'm
dialog: almost forty, and I never met the
dialog: right guy. I was afraid if I
dialog: waited any longer it would all pass
dialog: me by, and I'd miss my chance.
text: Stan just looks at her. Speechless.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn't know you. I would have
dialog: never done it if--
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I just told you I loved you.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Well....do you not now?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You're pregnant.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Don't say it like that.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You're pregnant.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Yes. I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant!
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I tell you I'm in love with you and
dialog: you tell me your pregnant with some
dialog: stranger's child?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Don't say it like that. You make
dialog: it sound dirty.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I'm sorry. I...I'm stunned. I
dialog: don't know what to say. What the
dialog: fuck am I supposed to say?! This
dialog: is great fucking news?
dialog: Congratulations?! Why did you wait
dialog: so long to tell me?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Because I'm freaking out, okay! I
dialog: didn't know what to do. I made
dialog: this big decision to do this and
dialog: then I met you--
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Well, what am I supposed to do now?
dialog: This isn't how it was supposed to
dialog: be. This isn't what--
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? Life
dialog: isn't perfect. It's not all neat
dialog: and tidy like your perfect family
dialog: and your perfect farm and your
dialog: bluegrass band. It's messy. It's
dialog: fucked up. This is real life,
dialog: okay? I'm sorry to break it to
dialog: you.
text: They both stand there. After the raised voices, the silence
text: feels more pronounced.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Sorry? What's sorry going to do?
text: Stan walks out. Zoe stands there. And stands there. And
text: then she starts to cry.
scene_heading: INT. STAN'S BEDROOM - LATER
text: Zoe lies in bed awake. Nuts is beside her. They are alone.
dialog: 57.
scene_heading: EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - DAY
text: It's daybreak at the farm. FARM HANDS move herds of goats
dialog: from one pasture to another.
scene_heading: INT. GUEST ROOM - MORNING
text: Stan lies awake in a small guest room. Joan enters and is
text: startled to find him in there.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Oh, I thought you were in your
dialog: room. Sorry.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Everything okay?
text: Stan doesn't answer. Joan sits on the corner of the bed.
speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, she seems really terrific.
dialog: Dad and I both think so. She's
dialog: smart and poised and...
text: Next door, we hear Zoe puking again. Joan stops. Then,
text: wanting to seem open-minded, continues.
speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: And warm and gracious...
text: Another very LOUD HURL.
speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: And pretty and...
text: Another HURL. Joan looks at Stan.
speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell's going on in there?
speaker_heading: STAN
text: She's pregnant.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Oh, dear God.
text: We hear the toilet FLUSH.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY
text: Zoe sits in the passenger seat with the key in the ignition.
text: Stan leans against the car. They are both quiet.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I don't know what to say.
text: Neither does Stan, who says nothing. He runs his foot back
text: and forth in the gravel.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: I guess I'd given up on meeting
dialog: someone like you, and I did what I
dialog: thought was best.
text: Stan still doesn't say anything.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: But, for what it's worth...I love
dialog: you, too.
text: She puts the car in gear and pulls out. Stan watches her go.
text: His hands in his pockets.
scene_heading: EXT. MONA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Zoe stands in the hallway of Mona's apartment building. A
text: beat later, Mona opens the door and holds out her arms.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Come here.
text: Zoe walks slowly into her embrace. They stand like this for
text: a long time. Just holding each other. Until Mona's three
text: kids run out with wiffle-ball bats and chase each other down
text: the hall. A beat later, the toddler runs after them crying.
scene_heading: INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Zoe lies in bed with Nuts. She opens her eyes and stares at
text: the ceiling. Then, with a sigh, she gets up and does her
dialog: morning ritual.
text: She pulls up her nightgown and sticks out her stomach. For
text: the first time, we actually see a little bump.
scene_heading: INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY
text: Zoe lies on the table with a paper gown over her lap. She
text: looks down at her feet in the stirrups. Sadly, we notice a
dialog: perfect pedicure.
text: Dr. Harris comes in with a big smile.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: Congratulations! What luck to get
dialog: pregnant on the first try, huh?
dialog: And with frozen sperm, too. So,
dialog: how are we feeling?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (unconvincing)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: You sure about that?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: It's been hard. I don't know if I
dialog: was really prepared for this.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: Well, your hormones aren't helping,
dialog: and going through this without a
dialog: partner must be difficult.
text: Dr. Harries readies the ultrasound wand and inserts the
text: device. He turns the monitor so that Zoe can see.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, the good news is everything
dialog: looks great. You are now eight
dialog: weeks pregnant, which is an
dialog: important milestone. With a little
dialog: luck, we should be able to see a
dialog: heartbeat today.
text: On the screen we see a small flickering dot. Dr. Harris
text: smiles.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: That's it? That's...my baby?
text: Saying these words out loud for the first time hits Zoe.
text: Tears fill her eyes.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hi, Baby.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Is it okay? Is it healthy?
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: Everything's just...
dialog: (makes a face, then)
dialog: Wait, a minute...
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What? Wait a minute, what?
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
text: Well...I see another heartbeat.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (freaking out)
dialog: It has two hearts?
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: No...but you have two babies.
text: Zoe's mouth falls open.
scene_heading: NT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: We're back at Single Women By Choice. The women are sitting
text: on the floor. Sara is still nursing Dakota. Zoe has her
text: head in her hands.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Twins! That's fantastic!
text: Zoe bursts into tears.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Why are you crying? That's so
dialog: lucky.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Yup. That's me. Lucky, lucky, me.
text: The women are sensing the sarcasm, but not getting it.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Are you okay? Is it a financial
dialog: concern? There are many programs--
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No. I'm fairly loaded, actually.
dialog: Used to work for Google.
dialog: (blows nose)
dialog: I'm sorry. This is hard for me. I
dialog: don't know if I can talk about it
dialog: yet.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Take your time. When you feel like
dialog: sharing, we're here for you. We're
dialog: all sisters here.
dialog: (then, to the group)
dialog: Let's give Zoe some space. When
dialog: she's ready to talk, we're ready to
text: listen. Deep, cleansing breaths,
dialog: Zoe.
dialog: 61.
text: Carol takes a deep breath and then lets it out.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, in the meantime, does anyone
dialog: else have anything they want to
dialog: discuss? Problems? Concerns?
text: Tabitha, the tall woman with the nose ring, raises her hand.
speaker_heading: TABITHA
dialog: I'm having a hard time. Luca keeps
dialog: asking why he doesn't have a daddy,
dialog: and I just don't know what--
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (blurting out)
dialog: There's this guy. His name is
dialog: Stan. And he's fantastic.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I knew it!
speaker_heading: TABITHA
dialog: Uh...wasn't I just speaking?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I knew you were with that guy!
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: What guy?
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Zoe, this group is called Single
dialog: Mother's By Choice.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I know. I'm sorry--
speaker_heading: TABITHA
dialog: Um, excuse me. What about Luca?
dialog: He's been really, really sad.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (floodgates opening)
dialog: Have you ever met a guy and you get
dialog: butterflies and you think this is
dialog: the kind of man who could take care
dialog: of me forever? The kind of guy who
dialog: makes you re-examine everything?
dialog: Like, maybe I can be a stay-at-home
text: mom and be barefoot and pregnant.
text: The women stare blankly at Zoe.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: He actually lives on a farm! Plays
dialog: the banjo! Maybe I could learn to
dialog: sew and take care of the animals.
dialog: Like Laura Ingalls.
text: Even Dakota stops nursing and looks over at that one.
scene_heading: EXT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - LATER
text: The women file out. No one dares look at Zoe. It's very
text: awkward, although Zoe seems unaware. She turns to Carol.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Carol, thank you. This has been
dialog: really helpful. Just getting it
dialog: all out and being with other women
dialog: who--
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I'm going to have to ask you not to
dialog: come back.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What? Why?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I don't think we can help you, and,
dialog: quite frankly, you're against
dialog: everything we stand for.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: But, I thought we were all sisters.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: No. Not you.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Do you know how long it took me to
dialog: conceive? Five years. I had three
dialog: miscarriages and spent every last
dialog: dime on in-vitro. And Dana? The
dialog: woman with the short hair?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Which one?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: The one with the really short hair?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Yeah, that doesn't really narrow it
dialog: down much.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: She just flew to Memphis to watch
text: her baby being born. Seconds after
dialog: the birth, the birth mother changed
dialog: her mind and refused to give it up.
text: Zoe's face changes. She starts to get it.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: So, as you can see, we are really
dialog: dedicated and choosing to be single
dialog: mothers, and you seem to be in a
dialog: slightly different place. You're
text: carrying two healthy babies, and
dialog: you have no idea how lucky you are.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: You're right.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I like you, Zoe. We all like you.
dialog: But you kind of need to figure out
dialog: where you are.
text: Zoe nods.
scene_heading: EXT. SHADYBROOK RETIREMENT COMMUNITY - DAY
text: Zoe and Nana are walking the loop around the courtyard. Zoe
text: looks terrible. Like she hasn't slept in days. They
text: complete a lap. Arthur gives them the double thumbs up sign.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: That man is obsessed with my ass.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I know. It's kind of upsetting.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: He wants to take me on a cruise so
dialog: that we can finally tie the knot.
dialog: But, I don't know. What's the
dialog: hurry?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: You've been engaged for nine years.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: No reason to rush into anything.
text: Nana looks over at Zoe. She sees the bags under her eyes.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: NANA (CONT'D)
dialog: You look terrible, dear.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: You must really love him, huh?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I guess I do.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: Honey, I'm sure he's wonderful, and
dialog: I'm sure he loves you, too. But,
dialog: you have put him in a really
dialog: awkward position. Having a baby is
dialog: a big adjustment for any couple.
dialog: And you're not married. And he's
dialog: not the father. And you've only
dialog: been together a little while. And
dialog: now you're having twins. And--
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Please stop.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: I'm just saying, if he actually
dialog: wanted to stay with you right now,
dialog: he'd be the greatest man in the
dialog: world, and, quite frankly, I don't
dialog: think any man is that great.
text: They complete another lap around the courtyard. Arthur
text: smiles at them and then "raises the roof."
speaker_heading: NANA (CONT'D)
dialog: Arthur's just about the best man I
dialog: know, and look at him. He's a
dialog: fucking idiot.
scene_heading: EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - DAY
text: Stan leans against the fence looking at the goats. He has
text: the beginnings of a beard growing. The scruff makes him look
text: older. Thinner.
text: Joan approaches and stands next to him for a bit.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: You know, people thought we were
dialog: crazy when we bought this farm.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: All of our friends in New York,
dialog: they thought we'd lost our minds.
text: Stan nods. We get the feeling he's heard this before.
speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I guess I'm saying that you may
dialog: have envisioned your life going one
dialog: way, but the reality is, it could
dialog: go a totally different direction.
dialog: You just have to be open to it.
text: Stan watches a nearby goat coaxing her baby to nurse. He
dialog: shrugs.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Having a baby with someone I barely
dialog: know, someone else's baby...it's
dialog: just not how I pictured it.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I used to work on Wall Street. Now
dialog: I wear boots covered in goat shit.
dialog: This isn't how I pictured it,
dialog: either. But guess what...I'm
dialog: happy.
text: She gives him a sympathetic hug and walks away.
scene_heading: INT. STAN'S BEDROM - NIGHT
text: Stan lies in bed looking up at the "stars." There's even
text: less glow now than last time. He sighs and then turns over
dialog: to try and sleep.
text: ANGLE ON Nuts' off-road wheelchair in the corner of the room.
text: Stan looks at it and can't help but smile.
scene_heading: INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Zoe and Nuts lie in the bed. They are looking at each other
text: on the pillow. Zoe scratches behind his ears.
text: Zoe goes to the mirror and does her usual. The bump is
text: growing. For the first time, we see a smile.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: The Single Mother's By Choice women are sitting in their
text: usual circle. Lori is passing around a list.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Make sure you put your numbers
dialog: down. I want to have everyone's
dialog: number handy in case I go into
dialog: labor early.
text: Zoe enters. All eyes turn. She waves sheepishly.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Hi, guys.
dialog: No one knows what to say.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Hi, Zoe.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I just wanted to apologize. I'm
dialog: sorry I got into a relationship and
dialog: wasn't honest with you guys, and
dialog: I'm sorry I interrupted you,
dialog: Tabitha. I hope Luca is doing
dialog: better.
speaker_heading: TABITHA
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (to Carol)
dialog: And I've thought a lot about what
dialog: you said, about how lucky I am. I
dialog: got into this whole situation
dialog: because I wanted to have a baby.
dialog: And, somehow, I lost sight of that.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Anyway, I need partners in this,
dialog: and I hope you'll take me back.
text: Lori smiles and hands her the piece of paper.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: It's a phone tree. I'm due next
dialog: month, but my midwife thinks I may
dialog: go sooner. I want everyone to be
dialog: there. Are you in?
text: Zoe smiles.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'm in.
dialog: 67.
scene_heading: EXT. HUDSON STREET - DAY
text: Zoe has her head held high and her cute belly pushed out as
dialog: far as it will go.
text: A WOMAN with a double stroller approaches. Zoe smiles.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: TWIN TODDLERS
dialog: Hi./Hi.
text: Zoe walks on. She sees her reflection in a store window and
text: smiles. She looks like an actual pregnant person now. As
text: she is walking and smiling to herself, we hear a familiar
dialog: voice.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Hi.
text: Her P.O.V. Stan appears next to her in the reflection. For
text: a brief second, they look like a family.
text: Zoe turns. They both stop. Unsure of whether to hug or
text: what. They just stand there.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: You said that already.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You...look great.
text: Zoe touches her belly. Proud but protective.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: How are you feeling?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Good.
text: A long silence.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: You have a beard.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Yeah, it's awful isn't it.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Don't lie.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Did I tell you how pretty you look?
text: Zoe nods. Another silence.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I miss you.
text: A group of SCHOOL KIDS, lost in their own conversations, push
text: up the block, separating Zoe and Stan for a moment. This
text: separation makes the moment all the more tense.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I miss you, too.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: This whole time we've been apart,
dialog: I've been trying to figure out what
dialog: it is about you that I love so
dialog: much. And I think that it's that a
dialog: lot of people talk about doing
dialog: things, but you actually do them.
dialog: You're really kind of daring. How
dialog: you quit your job and took over a
dialog: pet store all because some asshole
dialog: sold you a lame dog. You came and
dialog: found me at the Farmer's Market
dialog: even though the night before I
dialog: acted like a total stalker...
text: Zoe smiles at the memory. Stan continues.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: And now you're pregnant. Because
dialog: you wanted to have a baby and
dialog: didn't think you could wait any
dialog: longer. Well, that's just the same
dialog: kind of thing. It's...brave. And
dialog: I can't love you for being that way
text: but then walk away for the same
dialog: reason.
text: Stan takes her hands.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I love you. I've been waiting my
dialog: whole life for you. And I can't
dialog: let one little baby get in the way
dialog: of that. I just...can't.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: There's something I need to tell
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: It's big. And you're allowed to
dialog: take all of this back when I tell
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: What.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: It's not just one baby....I'm
dialog: having twins.
text: Stan looks at her. Is she joking? Her look says no. He
text: takes a beat. And then, even though it's not a joke, he
text: starts to laugh. A little laugh at first and then a big one.
text: And then, Zoe starts laughing too. The whole thing is just
dialog: so ridiculous.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: This is insane.
scene_heading: INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: It's late. Zoe and Stan are naked in bed, lying face to
text: face. Stan puts his hand on her stomach. He feels the
text: little bump, new since he's last been with her.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Do you feel any kicking?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Sometimes.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: What does it feel like?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Like butterflies.
dialog: 70.
text: Stan smiles. He likes this image. He runs his hand over her
text: belly. Zoe moves in closer. Touches his cheek.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you really sure you want to do
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Yeah. I'm really sure.
text: They look at each other for a long time. Finally, Zoe closes
text: her eyes and settles in for sleep, with Stan watching her as
text: she dozes off.
scene_heading: INT. EXAM - ROOM
text: CU of a MONITOR where we see two distinct baby shapes
text: floating head-to-toe.
text: Dr. Harris holds the ultrasound wand to her belly. Stan
text: doesn't say anything. He looks on in total amazement.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: They're so...perfect. They look
dialog: like real babies.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: Would you like to know the sexes?
text: They look at each other. Zoe smiles. Stan shrugs. Zoe
text: nods. Stan does, too.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Yes. Tell us.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: You're having two healthy little
dialog: girls.
text: Stan gets tears in his eyes.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Two girls?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Two girls.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: Congratulations.

scene_heading: EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY
text: Stan and Zoe walk down Madison Avenue. All of the other NEW
text: YORKERS are on some kind of mission -- shopping, rushing to
dialog: meetings, or fighting for cabs.
text: But Zoe and Stan just walk slowly hand-in-hand. Every so
text: often looking at each other and just smiling or laughing.
text: Then, suddenly, Stan picks her up in the middle of the
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Two girls!
text: A WOMAN with a BABY in a Baby Bjorn passes by. Stan smiles.

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Hi.
scene_heading: INT. UNION SQUARE CAFE - NIGHT
text: We PAN past several small plates of food on a table. A chef
dialog: tells us what delectable items we are looking at.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Here we have a yellowtail sashimi
text: with ponzu sauce and pea shoots.
text: This is carpaccio with shaved white
dialog: truffles. And, finally, an
dialog: heirloom tomato salad with fresh
dialog: Buratta flown in from Italy this
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Thanks, Sam. It looks incredible.
text: Sam tops off their champagne and exits. Stan picks up his

speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Aren't you hungry?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I can't eat any of this.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (pointing to each dish)
text: Raw. Raw. Unpasteurized.
dialog: (re: champagne)
dialog: Alcohol.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Let me get Sam back. He'll make
dialog: you anything you want.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I don't want to hurt his feelings.
dialog: You go ahead. I'm fine.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Well, what are you going to eat?
scene_heading: INT. MCDONALD'S - NIGHT
text: The CASHIER reads back Zoe's order.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with

dialog: piece chicken McNuggets?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Make that an eight, no, ten-piece
dialog: McNuggets.
dialog: (to Stan)
dialog: You'll have some, right?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (back to the cashier)
dialog: Ten-piece. Someone will eat them.
text: Stan stands behind Zoe with an incredulous look on his face.
scene_heading: INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Zoe and Stan lie in bed, each reading a copy of "What to
dialog: Expect when You're Expecting."
text: Zoe has the McNuggets box on her chest. She dips each nugget
text: in three different sauces and then takes a bite. Stan
text: watches with a mixture of amusement and revulsion.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (re: book)
dialog: Have you gotten to page 79 yet?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: No. I stopped reading when you
dialog: ripped out one of my pages and used
text: it as a napkin.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Says here many women in the second
dialog: trimester experience an increased
dialog: sexual appetite.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Really?
text: Zoe smiles and then slowly triple dunks another McNugget.
text: She takes a seductive bite.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you coming on to me? It's kind
dialog: of hard to tell right now.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Yeah. I'm coming on to you.
text: Zoe throws the McNuggets on the floor and climbs on top of
text: him. She puts his hands on her body and then starts to kiss
text: him voraciously. After a beat, Stan stops.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You have chicken in your hair.
scene_heading: INT. EQUINOX GYM - DAY

dialog: allowed to let it go.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Because look at me. I just keep
text: getting bigger and bigger.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Well, yeah. That's kind of how it
dialog: goes.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'm afraid I'm going to scare him
dialog: away. I'm like one of those giant
dialog: bouncy castles. Soon I'm going to
text: take over the whole back yard.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Come on. He loves you for you.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'm just getting kind of freaked
dialog: out by everything. He asked me to
dialog: go to this wedding with him. What
dialog: kind of first impression am I going
dialog: to make on all of his friends?
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Well, you're knocked up with some
dialog: stranger's twins. So, already
dialog: you're not exactly...
speaker_heading: ZOE

speaker_heading: MONA

scene_heading: INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Everything okay in there?
text: A cocktail dress FLIES out and hits him in the head.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Never mind.
text: He waits a few beats. Another dress FLIES out.
speaker_heading: ZOE (O.S.)
dialog: This SUCKS!!!
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Honey, whatever you wear is fine.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: ZOE (O.S.)
dialog: I don't have anything to wear!

text: Another dress sails through the air.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuuuuuuck!
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You always look great. I've never
dialog: seen you not look great.
text: Stan goes to the closet. Zoe is pulling on a long black
text: dress. She tries to smush her boobs down into the top.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: That's perfect. You look hot.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Really? You think?
text: Zoe turns to reveal the back. The two sides of the zipper
text: are ten inches apart.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Do you have a shawl or something?
text: Zoe bursts into tears.
scene_heading: EXT. PERRY STREET - LATER
text: A cab pulls up in front of Zoe's brownstone. Stan opens the

text: it's certainly hugging every curve and bump, it looks great.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You look smokin'.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Thanks, honey.
text: Zoe pauses in front of the open taxi door.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Let's go. We're super late.
text: She tries to bend at the waist, but the dress is too tight.
text: Then she tries to go in butt first and swing her legs around,

dialog: Hmmmm...
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Why don't you sort of go in...head
text: first and then turn around.
text: Zoe leans her head in and then has no other choice but to lie
text: down sideways on the seat. Stan tries not to laugh.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Shut up and push me.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Push you?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Just do it.
text: Stan pushes her legs, and Zoe disappears inside the cab.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS
text: Zoe lies down straight across the seats like a board.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I hate everyone.
text: She sucks in her breath and tries to sit up. As soon as she
text: bends at the waist, we hear a horrific RIP. She bursts into
text: tears again.
scene_heading: INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - LATER
text: We PAN over the coffee table. There's a pint of melty Ben
text: and Jerry's, a roll of cookie dough (half eaten,) US Weekly,
dialog: and The National Enquirer.
text: Zoe and Bobby lie on the floor looking at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Do you think he's telling everyone
dialog: why I didn't go? I'm too much of a
dialog: fat-ass walrus to go to the
dialog: wedding?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You're not a fat ass walrus.
dialog: You're pregnant.
text: Zoe eyes well up with tears again.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Why are you crying? So what? You
dialog: missed a stupid wedding.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: You got to have girls' night with
dialog: me. This is way more fun.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I don't know. I'm just so
dialog: emotional lately. It's the
dialog: hormones.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You can't help it. Being pregnant
dialog: sucks. You're emotional, and
dialog: irrational, and you get back fat.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I have back fat?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No. I'm just kidding.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Okay, yes. You have back fat.
text: Zoe feels her back.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: How's Stan going to stay with me
dialog: through this? I'm disgusting.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: We'll go shopping tomorrow. We'll
dialog: get some hip maternity clothes...
dialog: whatever that means.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Look at me, Bobby.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (pinching back fat)
dialog: Look at me. What do you see?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I see the most amazingly wonderful
dialog: person I know.
text: Zoe smiles. Tears come to her eyes again.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: With back fat.
dialog: 78.
scene_heading: INT. PUCK BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Stan leans against the bar with a beer in hand. He is
text: watching all of the Farmer's Market girls and his co-worker,
text: Fred, on the dance floor. Everyone looks drunk and happy.
text: Olivia stumbles towards him with an empty glass of champagne.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Why aren't you dancing?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I'm just about to go. It's late.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Come on, one dance.
text: The spaghetti strap of her dress falls over her shoulder.
text: Stan notices. She steps in closer.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: For old time's sake.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I have a girlfriend, Olivia.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Never stopped you before.
text: She tries to kiss him. Stan steps away.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: It's serious this time.
text: Olivia pulls back, surprised.
scene_heading: INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - LATER
text: Zoe is asleep in the bed. Her bump looks very cute under the
text: covers. Stan quietly gets ready for bed. She turns to him,
text: half asleep.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: How was it?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Boring.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Good.
text: Stan gets in bed next to her. Zoe scoots into him.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: I miss my old ass.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: It was one of my best features.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You know what's weird? I never
dialog: knew your old ass.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: It's kind of like this ass but way
dialog: hotter.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I also don't know what you really
dialog: like to eat and what's just a
dialog: craving, or when you start laughing
text: hysterically and then crying and
dialog: you say, this isn't me, if that's
dialog: true because I don't really know
dialog: the real you. All I know is the
dialog: pregnant you.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: That is weird.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Or like how you're horny all the
dialog: time? Is that you? Or is that
dialog: pregnant you?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (lying)
dialog: That's me.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: When all of this is over, who will
dialog: you be?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Hopefully, myself again.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: But...who is that?
dialog: 80.
scene_heading: INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - LATER
text: The clock by the bed says 2:30 a.m. Stan is snoring
text: slightly. Nuts is on the pillow beside him. Zoe's side is
text: empty.
scene_heading: INT. ZOE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Zoe sits on the floor of the living room sifting through a
text: box of photographs.
text: We FOLLOW her back into the bedroom and onto the bed. As
text: Stan slowly opens his eyes, she holds up a photograph.
text: His P.O.V. It's a picture of a woman's ass.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: This is my old ass.
text: Stan blinks a few times. His eyes adjusting.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Why do you have a picture of your
dialog: ass?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: My college boyfriend took it. So,
dialog: I guess in fairness, my ass doesn't
dialog: look exactly like this anymore, but
text: it's pretty close. It's held up.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: It's a nice ass.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: You said you don't know the real
dialog: me, so I thought I'd show you.
text: She picks up another photograph. This one is of Zoe at
text: twelve and at her most awkward -- short hair, braces and
dialog: acne.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is me in seventh grade.
text: Stan props himself up in one elbow.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I know.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You look like Anthony Michael Hall.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: This period, as horrible as it was,
dialog: made me who I am. I think every
dialog: person should go through a
text: hideously ugly phase. It builds
dialog: character.
dialog: (then)
dialog: It also taught me that I should
dialog: never, under any circumstances,
text: have short hair and a perm again.
text: She picks up another picture. It's Zoe in a bathing cap and
text: Speedo. She's holding up a yellow ribbon and has her arm
dialog: around Nana.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is one of my favorites because
dialog: look how happy I am. I don't even
dialog: know what place yellow is, but I'm
dialog: sure it's not good.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Fifth place.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: But I still look super happy,
dialog: right? That's all because of Nana.
dialog: Whatever I did, she thought it was
dialog: the best.
text: The next picture is a Halloween shot of Bobby, Mona and Zoe.
text: Bobby is all in green, Zoe is all in yellow and Mona is in
dialog: regular clothes.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: These are my best friends, Bobby
dialog: and Mona. Mona and I met in high
dialog: school and Bobby passed out on my
dialog: couch in college and never left.
dialog: You haven't met them yet because
dialog: they might scare you away.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Why are you dressed like that?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Halloween. We were supposed to be
text: a traffic light but Mona bagged out
text: at the last minute and so Bobby and
dialog: I just look like idiots. That's
dialog: typical Mona, by the way.
dialog: 82.
text: Zoe puts the picture down and picks up another. It's a woman
text: in a hospital bed. She's giving the thumbs up sign.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is my mom.
text: Stan takes the picture and studies it.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You look just like her.
speaker_heading: ZOE
text: This is the last picture of her
dialog: that I have. She lived for a few
dialog: more years, but we never took any
dialog: pictures because she didn't want us
dialog: to remember her like that. I was
dialog: eight when she died.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I...can't imagine.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: She had a great laugh. And really
dialog: soft hands. She used to rub my
dialog: back before I went to sleep.
text: Zoe puts the picture on the bedside table, propping it up
text: next to her clock.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Do you have any pictures of your
dialog: dad?
text: Zoe doesn't say anything.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry. If you don't want to
dialog: talk about it...
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: My mother was in a coma for two
dialog: years before the end. That's when
dialog: my dad left her.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: So...that's when he died. To us,
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: God, Zoe. I'm so sorry.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: It's okay. It was an important
dialog: lesson. That's when I realized
dialog: that nothing lasts forever.
text: This sad statement hangs in the air for a few moments.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: So, that's my story. That's the
dialog: real me.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Things can last forever, you know.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Not for me they can't.
text: Stan takes her hand, and they stay like that for a while.
text: Just holding hands on the floor of her moonlit room.
text: Finally, the silence is broken by the telephone RINGING.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: That's weird.
scene_heading: INT. LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT
text: Zoe and Stan enter the lobby of an old building in Tribeca.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I'm confused. Why did you say you
dialog: would come witness this birth in
dialog: the first place?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I don't know. Seemed like a good
dialog: idea at the time. I was trying to
dialog: get back in their good graces. Go
dialog: home. I'll meet you there. I
dialog: don't want them to see you anyway.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: It's four in the morning. I'm not
dialog: letting you walk home alone.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Fine. I'll just pop in, show my
text: face and leave. Ten minutes, tops.
dialog: 84.
scene_heading: INT. LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: There are candles everywhere and a table of food and drinks.
text: Kind of like a birthing cocktail party. Zoe eats a brownie.
text: Carol approaches with Lori, who is wearing a caftan and
text: rubbing her large stomach. They all hug.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Zoe, it's so nice of you to come,
dialog: especially at this crazy hour.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: You're really one of us now.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Are you sure you're in labor?
dialog: You're so calm.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Oh, I'm sure.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Well, I just wanted to come and say
dialog: a quick hi and good luck.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: You're not staying?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You have to stay. Lori wants us
dialog: all to be together for this.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Well, I really want to be here
dialog: but...um, the truth is...actually
dialog: I've been wanting to tell you guys
dialog: for a while but, the truth is...
text: Lori drops her head on Zoe's shoulder and lets out a giant
text: MOAN. It's long and it's awkward.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (whispering)
text: She's having a contraction.
text: Zoe nods. This is weird. Lori breathes through it.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Okay. What was it you were saying?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'm back with Stan.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Stan who?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: The farmer?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Actually, he makes cheese. He
dialog: named a cheese after me. Isn't
dialog: that romantic? Sort of?
dialog: (off their blank stares)
dialog: Well, anyway, I'm not technically a
dialog: single mother by choice anymore.
dialog: So, if you want me to leave right
dialog: now, I totally understand. I'll
dialog: just walk out the door and--
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: No, I really want you to stay.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (bummed)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Listen, Zoe, if you're happy, we're
dialog: happy. We'd love to meet him.
dialog: Bring him to group any time.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Well, actually, he's downstairs, so
dialog: I should probably get back to--
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Great. Invite him up.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Oh, no, no, no...
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: I'm not shy. I've been through
dialog: this before. It's quite beautiful,
dialog: really.
text: Zoe stands there trying to come up with another excuse.
text: After a few moments, it's clear that she cannot.
scene_heading: INT. LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Stan looks up from the Hunan Lotus take-out menu he's been
dialog: reading to pass the time.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: ZOE
text: Just a few minutes.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I don't know, Zoe.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: You have to come up. They begged
dialog: me. And truthfully, I'm kind of
dialog: scared of them. Please?
scene_heading: INT. LORI'S APARTMENT - LATER
text: Zoe and Stan hover over the dessert table. They both eat
text: brownies and keep their eyes down. Sara is next to them
dialog: nursing Dakota.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: This is weird.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Good brownies, though. This one
text: has peanut butter in it.
text: Carol walks by with a little DRUM, which she bangs
text: rhythmically.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Come on everybody, it's time.
text: She's getting into the water.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: The what?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Oh, it's a water birth. Didn't Zoe
dialog: tell you?
text: Carol starts banging the drum again and moves off.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: What's a water birth?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I don't know. But just so we're
dialog: clear, this...
dialog: (re. the whole scene)
dialog: Is not the real me.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I'll wait here.
text: Zoe grabs another brownie and exits.
scene_heading: INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: In the middle of this very small, very cramped living room is
text: an inflatable baby pool. And in this baby pool is Lori, who
text: is now naked and pushing.
text: Zoe watches, horrified, the brownie still in her hand. Carol
text: is beside her, playing the drum and chanting.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (eyes wide)
dialog: Wow. Wow. Wow.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I know. It's amazing how the body
dialog: can open up like that.
text: Zoe covers her mouth. It looks like she is going to throw
text: up. She stumbles for the door.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'm just going to get some air.
dialog: I'm feeling a little...
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Don't move, Zoe, you're my focal
dialog: point.
text: Lori then GRUNTS through another big contraction.
speaker_heading: MIDWIFE
dialog: Push, Lori. Push.
text: While Lori's eyes are closed, Zoe tries to sneak out. Carol
text: chases after, still beating the drum.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You can't leave. You're her focal
dialog: point.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Can't she use someone else?
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: She's in labor. You want to argue
dialog: with her now?
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: Carol beats the drum faster now. Some of the other Single
text: Mothers by Choicers join her in the chant.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.
text: Lori lets out a SCREAM as Tabitha and the MIDWIFE pull her
text: legs back. Zoe watches with both hands over her mouth.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Oh, Jesus.
dialog: (then)
dialog: What is...that?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Sssshh. It's perfectly natural.
dialog: Sometimes the bowels just let go.
dialog: (then, back to chanting)
dialog: Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.
text: The midwife fishes out the poop with a plastic bag. Zoe
text: turns away, gagging. She drops her brownie.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Don't move, Zoe, I need you!
dialog: You're my focal point.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What does that even mean?
text: Zoe turns back. Her face white as a sheet. Lori lets out
text: another WAIL.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: I need to turn over. Please!
speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: Do it, Lori. We're here for you.
dialog: We're all here for you.
text: Carol beats the drum faster as Lori gets on all fours. The
text: midwife lifts Lori's leg up to the side. Lori lets out a
text: loud, WHALE-LIKE MOAN.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Here comes the head.
text: Lori's moan turns into a DONKEY-LIKE BRAY.
speaker_heading: JESSIE
text: We can see the head, Lori.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: There's so much hair!
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (woozy, afraid)
dialog: I don't think that's the baby's
dialog: hair.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: I want to see the head. Get me a
text: mirror. It's in the bedroom.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'll get it.
text: Zoe makes a desperate attempt to run from the room.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: GOD DAMN IT ZOE, DON'T MOVE!!!!
scene_heading: INT. LORI'S FOYER - SAME
text: Out in the foyer, Stan is paralyzed. Next to him is Dakota,
text: who is crying.
text: Through the hallway mirror, he can see what's going on in the
text: living room: a hefty woman on all fours in a dirty inflatable
text: swimming pool with a hairy head coming out of a hairy vag.
speaker_heading: CAROL (O.S.)
dialog: Stan, get the mirror!
scene_heading: INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Stan, walks backwards with his head down, holding a mirror.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Excuse me. Hello. I'm Stan.
dialog: Excuse me. Hi. I'm Stan.
text: Carol grabs the mirror and holds it under Lori. Lori lifts
text: her leg like a dog taking a piss and then starts to cry.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Look at all that wet, curly hair.
text: Stan steals a look, starts to dry heave and rushes to Zoe.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (freaking out)
dialog: Let's get the hell out of here.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I can't. I'm her focal point.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I don't know.
text: Suddenly, we hear a huge SCREAM.
text: Zoe and Stan turn just in time to see the baby emerge and
text: plop into the water.
text: CU of the baby in the dirty water still attached to the
text: umbilical cord.
text: CU of Zoe and Stan's horrified faces.
text: Zoe's eyes roll back and we:
text: FADE TO BLACK.
text: OVER BLACK we hear silence. Blessed silence. No drums. No
text: chants. No screams. Nothing. Until, we hear the SPLASH.
scene_heading: INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: We are CLOSE on Zoe's face. She opens her eyes. Blinks a
dialog: few times.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I don't know. Why am I wet?
text: WIDEN to reveal that Zoe is lying in the inflatable pool.
text: Her eyes go from side to side. The horror of the situation
text: becoming clear. A spongy, purple thing floats by.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: What is that?
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (afraid)
dialog: I think it's the placenta.
text: Zoe's eyes roll back again and we...
text: FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: EXT. 14TH STREET - DAY
text: 14th street is just coming to life as the FARMERS start to
text: unload their wares.
text: Zoe and Stan head up the street slowly, wearily, like
text: soldiers back from battle.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Wow. We really shouldn't have seen
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I did mention that I barely know
dialog: those people, right?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Like forty times.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I feel the need to say it again.
text: They turn into the Farmer's Market.
text: ANGLE ON Fred unloading cheese from the back of the Little
text: Goat truck. Stan and Zoe slowly walk towards him.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: It won't be like that for us.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Well, for starters, you wax.
text: ANGLE ON Olivia crossing from her berry stand to the cheese
text: stand with a blueberry pie. She is about to place the pie on
text: Stan's table when she looks up and sees Stan and Zoe.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Oh, hi.
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Hi.
dialog: (awkward beat, then)
dialog: You remember Zoe.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Right, hi.
text: And then Olivia notices Zoe's pregnant belly.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Wow.
dialog: (then, to Stan)
dialog: Wow.
text: At the same time, Zoe notices the post-it on the pie. It
text: says, SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What is that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: It's nothing.
text: Olivia crumples the post-it and turns to Stan.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: (re. Zoe's pregnant belly)
dialog: I had no idea it was that serious.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I told you it was serious.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: What the hell does, "sorry about
dialog: last night" mean?
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: It's stupid. I was drunk and...
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: It was nothing.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What was nothing?
text: Olivia turns back to Stan, flabbergasted.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: You're having a baby? I didn't
dialog: know you'd been together that long.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Well, they're not mine...but, yeah,
dialog: we're having a baby. Two actually.
dialog: On Zoe's look of shock we...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - MOMENTS LATER
text: The fruits and vegetables and flowers become a blur as Zoe
text: runs out of the Farmer's Market. Stan chases after her.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Nothing happened.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Get away from me.
text: Stan runs in front of her, forcing her to stop.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Nothing happened!
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: You said, "they're not mine."
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I didn't mean to say it.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: How could you say that?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I don't know. I was flustered.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Flustered?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I'm sorry, I'm not exactly thinking
dialog: straight. I've been up all night
dialog: watching Orca give birth!
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: "They're not mine?"
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (at a loss )
dialog: Well, I mean...technically, they're
dialog: not.
dialog: 94.
text: The minute he says this, he wishes he could take it back.
text: Zoe just looks at him. She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: You know, all this time you're
dialog: trying to figure out who the real
dialog: me is, but who the fuck are you?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Zoe.
text: She runs to a nearby cab and slams the door.
scene_heading: INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Zoe enters the apartment and slams the door behind her. She
text: runs to the couch and collapses in tears. Nuts wheels over
text: and stands beside her.
scene_heading: INT. LE PAIN QUOTIDIEN - DAY
text: Zoe and Mona are at their usual table. Zoe looks like she
dialog: hasn't slept.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Do you really think something
dialog: happened with the berry girl? They
dialog: both said nothing happened.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Well, are they going to come out
dialog: and tell me? And that's not even
dialog: the point. He said, the babies
dialog: weren't his. And if he says that,
dialog: he thinks that. And if he thinks
dialog: that, he's not really committed.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: So, now you run?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Why should I stick around for the
dialog: end of the story when I know what
dialog: it's going to be?
text: Mona says nothing. She looks like she might say something
text: and then doesn't.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: What? If you want to say
dialog: something, say it.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Do you know the end of the story?
dialog: Can't you just give him the benefit
dialog: of the doubt? He seems like such a
dialog: good guy.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: You haven't even met him.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Yeah, and don't think I don't know
dialog: the reason for that. You were
dialog: never going to see this through,
dialog: Zoe. Never. It was doomed before
dialog: it began. Just like all of your
dialog: relationships. You get out before
dialog: you get hurt.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: You don't think I'm hurt right now?
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Every man is not your father. When
dialog: are you going to realize that?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: You don't know what you're talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: I've known you for thirty years. I
dialog: know you don't trust people. You
dialog: and your grandmother, both. She's
dialog: been engaged to Arthur for how long
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Leave Nana out of this.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: She's never going to marry him.
dialog: Just like you'd never marry Stan.
dialog: No wonder you ended up with a sperm
dialog: donor. He'll never let you down.
dialog: It's your ideal boyfriend.
text: Zoe's face changes. She looks incredibly hurt.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I used a donor because I wanted a
dialog: baby.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: I'm sorry. I went too far.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Because I wanted to have a family.
dialog: Because Nana is the only one I've
dialog: got and she's eighty-four years
dialog: old. And then it will just be me.
dialog: So, yeah, you went a little too
dialog: far.
text: Zoe leaves Mona at the table.
scene_heading: INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING
text: Zoe and Nuts lie on the pillow together. Zoe scratches
text: behind his ears.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Guess it's just you and me again.
text: Nuts licks her face. She gets out of bed and goes to check
text: her belly in the mirror. It's actually getting kind of huge.
scene_heading: EXT. ZOE'S BROWNSTONE - DAY
text: Zoe walks down the steps. Stan is waiting for her on the
text: sidewalk. His hands in his pockets.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: It's Thursday. We have a doctor's
dialog: appointment.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: There is no "we", Stan.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Come on, I didn't mean to say it,
dialog: and that's not how I feel.
text: Zoe shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I made a mistake trusting you.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Don't say that. That's not true.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: You're not good for me. You made
dialog: me think I needed you, and I don't.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: So that's it? Because of one
dialog: stupid, asinine thing that I said,
dialog: it's all over? This is how it
dialog: ends?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Yes. This is how it ends.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I don't know why you're so
dialog: surprised. I told you, nothing
dialog: lasts forever.
text: Zoe gives him a matter-of-fact shrug and walks off.
scene_heading: INT. DR. HARRIS' OFFICE - DAY
text: Dr. Harris moves the ultrasound wand over Zoe's belly. Zoe
text: holds up her shirt and watches the monitor.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: Things look great.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: So, I'll see you back in two weeks,
dialog: and we'll start checking to see if
text: the babies are dropping.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: It's hard to believe we're in the
dialog: home stretch.
text: Dr. Harris helps Zoe sit up.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: Now's the time I start discussing a
dialog: birthing plan with my patients. Do
dialog: you want me to wait until next time
dialog: when Stan's here?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Oh. Uh, no. He won't be here.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: He's out of town or something?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No. He's just...out.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: It's back to just you and me now.
dialog: We've come full circle.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: Well, don't you want anyone with
dialog: you in the delivery room? You
dialog: know, like a birthing partner?
scene_heading: INT. SHADYBROOK COURTYARD - DAY
text: Zoe and Nana are speed-walking. Nana stops, excited.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Yeah. Is that okay?
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Good. `Cause you're all I've got.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: What do I have to do?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I don't know. It will be a
dialog: c-section, so, basically, just
text: stand there and try not to faint.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: I can do that.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Thanks, Nana. It means a lot to me
dialog: that you'll be there.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: Are you kidding me? I've been
dialog: waiting my whole life for this.
text: They pass Arthur, who is in his usual spot, but instead of
text: leering at Nana, he's in his chair with his head back and
text: eyes closed.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Holy shit, is he dead?
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: Sleeping.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: How can you tell?
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: He's been like that all morning. I
dialog: wore him out last night.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Wow. I did not need to know that.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: We were celebrating.
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: We finally set a date.
text: Zoe stops dead in her tracks.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Excuse me?
scene_heading: INT. SHADYBROOK DINING ROOM - DAY
text: Nana walks Zoe through the Shadybrook dining room.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: So, we'll put the band here and the
dialog: dance floor right here.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I can't believe you're getting
dialog: married. What made you change your
dialog: mind?
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: All of a sudden it just hit me,
dialog: what am I waiting for? I love him.
dialog: He loves me. What am I so afraid
dialog: of?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Wow. This is...really big news.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: You don't seem happy.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No, I am. It's just...it just
dialog: makes my situation seem all the
dialog: more tragic. You're getting
dialog: married and here I am...
dialog: 100.
text: Her voice trails off.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: Zoe.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Don't worry. I'm fine. I'm really
dialog: happy for you.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: I'm worried about you, honey.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: I just don't want you to make the
dialog: same mistakes I made. I've been
dialog: alone for over thirty years now,
dialog: and that's too long. Sometimes in
dialog: life you have to forgive and move
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Are you talking about my father or
dialog: Stan?
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: Both, baby.
scene_heading: INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Zoe has her box of photographs. She pulls out a picture from
dialog: the very bottom.
speaker_heading: NANA (V.O.)
dialog: Because if you don't learn how to
dialog: forgive, you will always be stuck
dialog: in the past.
text: The photo is Zoe at age four and a man who looks so much like
dialog: her, that it can only be her father.
text: After a long beat, she puts it on her bedside table, next to
text: the one of her mother. The two pictures, side-by-side make
text: up a family. Zoe and her father in one shot and her mother
text: from the hospital bed giving the thumbs up sign in the other.
text: Over this image, we hear a quartet playing WEDDING MUSIC.
dialog: 101.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - DAY
text: The music takes us into the church and there we find Nana,
text: lovely in her wedding gown, and Arthur, dashing in his
text: morning suit, standing at the alter holding hands. Both have
text: tears in their eyes. Arthur lifts her veil and gives her the
dialog: sweetest kiss.
text: ANGLE ON Zoe and Bobby in the first pew, passing a
text: handkerchief back and forth.
scene_heading: INT. SHADYBROOK REC ROOM - LATER
text: Bobby leans against the piano singing a beautiful rendition
dialog: of "What a Wonderful World."
text: Nana and Arthur are alone on the dance floor. It's their
dialog: first dance as husband and wife.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (singing)
text: I see trees of green, red roses
dialog: too. I see them bloom for me and
dialog: you...
text: Zoe watches, her hands on her belly. Mona stands beside her.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: This song always makes me cry.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Me, too.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Is it happy or sad? The words are
text: happy but the song is so sad.
speaker_heading: ZOE
text: I guess it's both. Happy and sad.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (singing)
text: I see skies of blue and clouds of
text: white. The bright blessed day, the
dialog: dark and sacred night...
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: I'm sorry about the things I said.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I know.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: It was really shitty of me.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: It was. Especially because you
dialog: were right.
text: Mona takes Zoe's hand.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (singing)
dialog: And I think to myself...what a
dialog: wonderful world...
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I don't want to be alone forever,

speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Then don't be.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - DAY
text: Stan stares off into space. His beard is back. A CUSTOMER
text: surveys the different cheeses on the table.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: Is this new? The Zoe?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Yeah. This is the first week it's
dialog: been out.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: Can I have a sample? What's it
dialog: like?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: It's...very stubborn, overly
text: suspicious and distrustful of men.
text: The customer looks up at Stan.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: Huh?
scene_heading: INT. SHADYBROOK REC ROOM - LATER
text: Bobby pulls Zoe onto the dance floor.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Come on, you old maid.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Dance with me. One dance.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Forget it.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Fine. But it doesn't mean that I
dialog: won't dance with you.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What?
text: Bobby starts dancing. But really dancing. Justin Timberlake
text: style. Zoe smiles at the absurdity and then tries to walk
text: away. But Bobby won't let her escape. He blocks her path
text: and keeps dancing. This time turning around and shaking his
dialog: ass triple-time, like Beyonce.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Haaaaaay.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Go away, you freak.
text: A crowd of old people gather round. They start clapping,
text: thinking this is some kind of young person's dance routine.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Smack it, Bitch.
text: Bobby takes Zoe's hand and smacks his ass with it.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know you love it. Uh-huh.
dialog: That's right. Smack it.
text: The old people do the same. Trying to learn the hip new
text: dance the kids are doing. Several octogenarian couples
text: smacking each other's asses.
text: While this is happening, a weird look crosses Zoe's face.
text: Bobby jumps up and turns around to face Zoe. But when he
text: lands on the ground, his feet slide out from under him and he
text: hits the floor.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell?
text: An OLD MAN in the crowd looks down at the puddle.
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Damn it. Not again.
dialog: (then, checks pants)
dialog: Nope. Not me.
text: A few other old people look down and check themselves. At
text: which point, Zoe looks down and realizes.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I think my water just broke.
scene_heading: EXT. SHADYBROOK RETIREMENT HOME - DAY
text: The whole retirement community is outside throwing rice as

speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'll drive.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: You're in labor. You can't drive.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I'll drive.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: You don't have a car or a license.
dialog: (then, to Bobby)
dialog: You drive.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: We're in Queens. I don't even know
dialog: what side of the road they drive on
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Will someone please just drive me
dialog: to the fucking hospital?
text: All of a sudden, a white ROLLS ROYCE pulls up. Mona's at the
text: wheel. She leans out and waves.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: This was my surprise for after the
dialog: wedding, but let's hit it.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: This works.
text: They all pile in.
dialog: 105.
text: And then the car pulls off, revealing a sign that says, JUST
text: MARRIED...FINALLY! "Ensure" cans tied to strings bump along
text: behind them.
scene_heading: INT. ROLLS ROYCE - LATER
text: Things are a bit frantic in the car.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: Are you okay? Remember to breathe.
dialog: Breathe in, breathe out, breathe
dialog: in.
text: Mona looks at Zoe in the rearview and does Lamaze breaths.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, hee-hee.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: (joining in)
dialog: Hoo-hoo. Hee-hee...
speaker_heading: MONA/NANA
dialog: Hoo-hoo. Hee-hee...
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Please stop. It's getting really
dialog: breathy in here. I'm fine.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What about me? I have amniotic
dialog: fluid on my Gucci tux.
text: ANGLE on the mini bar, which is fully stocked.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Who needs a drink?
text: Everyone (including Zoe) raises their hands.
scene_heading: INT. LENOX HILL HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Zoe is being wheeled into Labor and Delivery with the gang in

speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Bobby...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What?
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: I don't know if I can do this.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: I can't go in with her.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Well, I certainly can't do it. I
dialog: don't do vaginas.
text: They look at Arthur, who struggles to keep up with his
dialog: walker.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Don't look at me.
text: Nana starts to hyperventilate.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: Help me, Bobby.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Nana, pull yourself together. This
dialog: is the biggest moment of Zoe's
dialog: life, and you can't let her down.
dialog: I'd slap you right now, but I'm
dialog: afraid your teeth would fly out.
scene_heading: INT. LABOR AND DELIVERY ROOM - DAY
text: Zoe is now alone in a room wearing a hospital gown.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, hee-hee, hoo-hee.

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Hey, girl. How ya doing?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Good.

speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What???
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Everything's under control. Good

text: Zoe jumps out of bed.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Get back in bed. All is well.
dialog: Arthur's with her. Now, on to
dialog: bigger and better...who do you want
dialog: to be your birthing partner? Your
dialog: choices are me or Mona.
text: Zoe starts to cry.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I know. They're shitty choices.
dialog: Do you want me to call your scary
dialog: lesbian friends from your group?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: We're going to get through this,
dialog: okay? You just have to really
dialog: think about it. Who do you want
dialog: with you in the delivery room?
text: Zoe wipes her tears.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Who is the one person you want by
dialog: your side?
scene_heading: EXT. 77TH STREET - DAY
text: Zoe runs down the street with a blanket over her hospital
dialog: gown.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Taxi!
scene_heading: INT. TAXI - MOMENTS LATER
text: Zoe jumps in. The cabbie looks at her in the rearview mirror
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: You're not an escaped mental
dialog: patient, are you?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Kind of.
scene_heading: EXT. 14TH STREET - DAY
text: Zoe runs across 14th street. The blanket flaps behind her
text: like a cape. She looks like a hugely pregnant super-hero.
text: And suddenly, she has to slow down and then stop completely
text: for a contraction. She leans against a parked van to steady
dialog: herself.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Ow. Son of a bitch, that hurts.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Are you okay?
text: Out of the corner of her eye, Zoe sees an enormous strawberry
text: on the side of the van. And then next to it, she sees
dialog: Olivia.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you in labor?
text: As soon as the contraction ends...
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Fuck off.
text: Zoe takes off again. Olivia watches her go.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - LATER

text: ANGLE ON Stan's truck, where Stan and Fred are unloading
dialog: cheese.
speaker_heading: ZOE

speaker_heading: ZOE

speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Stan!
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Are you okay? Don't run!
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I can't help it!
text: She keeps running towards him. He now runs towards her.
text: They finally meet. Zoe is out of breath and can barely talk.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Are you all right?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (panting)
dialog: Great. I'm great.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Why are you in a hospital gown?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'm in labor.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: What? What the hell are you doing
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: It's you.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Nana's my birthing partner, but she
dialog: passed out and needed stitches, and
dialog: Bobby asked me who I most wanted
dialog: with me, and...it's you. It's only
dialog: you.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I don't want to be alone anymore.
dialog: I love you. You don't know how
dialog: much I love you.
dialog: 110.
text: Stan doesn't know what to say. He's literally speechless.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: More than anything in the world, I
dialog: love you.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I've been in love with you since
dialog: the moment you stole my cab.
text: Zoe bends over, holding her stomach. A contraction.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, it was my cab,
dialog: hee-hee, hoo-hoo.
text: The contraction ends. Zoe can finally smile again. Stan
text: laughs and throws his arms around her.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ow. Ow. Ow.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. I just
dialog: love you. I love you so much.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Let's get the hell out of here.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Yeah. I think I really need to go
text: to the hospital now.
text: They kiss again. And then pull apart and look at each other.
text: Stan has tears in his eyes.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Let's go have our babies.
text: People clap and cheer as they hurry out of the Farmer's
text: Market. Even Olivia, watching from a distance, can't help
text: but applaud the big moment.
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY
text: Some fantastic song that makes us want to cry is playing...
text: We are CLOSE on Zoe's face. She is smiling. She does not
text: look scared. And she does not look alone.
text: WIDEN to reveal Stan by her side.
dialog: 111.
text: And we PULL BACK and above the operating table and see Dr.
text: Harris performing the C-section. He pulls out the babies one
dialog: by one.
text: We FOLLOW the babies as they get swaddled tight and handed
text: back to Zoe and Stan.
text: Zoe and Stan look at the little girls and then at each other.
text: They are both in tears. Even Dr. Harris can't help but cry.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
text: It's night. Zoe is asleep.
text: She opens her eyes and takes a moment to figure out where she
text: is. She turns to the side and finds Stan sleeping next to
text: her, curled up against her in the tiny hospital bed.
text: To the side of the bed are two bassinets. Each baby sleeping
text: soundly in a little pink hat.
text: And in the next bed is Nana, asleep with a bandage on her
dialog: forehead.
scene_heading: EXT. 6TH AVENUE - DAY
text: Nuts trots/rolls down the sidewalk wearing a sweater that

text: We TILT up and see Zoe and Stan strolling arm in arm, each
text: with a Baby Bjorn with a rosy-cheeked baby girl in it. Both
text: girls have flaming red hair.
text: A woman pushing a stroller passes by. She smiles at Zoe and

dialog: (then)
dialog: Cheers.
text: They clink dogs and each take a bite.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What a year, huh?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Incredible. Wouldn't change a

dialog: where you dumped me.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: And the part where you dumped me.
dialog: (to the babies)
dialog: Girls...Mommy and Daddy were
dialog: stupid.
text: The babies smile and coo.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (baby-talk)
dialog: Yes, we were. Yes, we were.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: The first time we held hands was in
dialog: here. It started out as a high-
dialog: five, but then I strategically
text: turned into a hand-hold.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: How do you remember that?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: We both agreed that we were totally
dialog: sick of weddings and hated when
dialog: people wrote their own vows.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: That's right. I remember that.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: So...I hope you won't hold it
dialog: against me.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What?
dialog: 113.
text: Nana and Arthur come through the door smiling. Zoe looks at

speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing here?
text: And then Bobby comes through the door.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Bobby?
dialog: And then Mona.
speaker_heading: ZOE (CONT'D)
dialog: What's happening?
text: And Joan and Edward. And Jalisa. And Fred. And Carol, Lori

dialog: And we...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. GRAY'S PAPAYA HOT DOGS - LATER
text: Zoe and Stan, still wearing the Baby Bjorns, stand face to
text: face in front of the guests and the priest.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I promise to love you even though
dialog: you still eat chicken McNuggets in
dialog: bed. I promise to name cheeses
dialog: after all of our children no matter
dialog: how embarrassed they are by it. I
dialog: promise to always check out your
dialog: ass when you walk away, and I
dialog: promise to love you more tomorrow
dialog: than I do today, which doesn't even
dialog: seem impossible...
text: And slowly, the sound of Stan's voice fades out and the sound
text: of Louis Armstrong's voice fades in...
text: And we watch Zoe's face as she realizes that there are some
dialog: things that really will last forever.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
