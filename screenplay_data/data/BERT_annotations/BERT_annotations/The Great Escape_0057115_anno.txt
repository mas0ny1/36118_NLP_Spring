dialog: "In its essence this is the story of a group of
dialog: men - and of one man, Roger Bushell, who was the
dialog: colorful leader. And yet through it all runs the
dialog: theme that even in death man can triumph over any
dialog: obstacle.
dialog: "To my mind this is also the story of a Tower of
dialog: Babel. The fact that this tower was in reverse
dialog: and happened to be a tunnel is a minor point.
dialog: What was important then - and is more so now -
dialog: is that this Tower of Babel was successfully
dialog: erected. It proves something important. In one
dialog: magnificent gesture the seventy-six ragged,
dialog: verminous men of all nationalities who climbed out
text: of that stinking hole in the ground in Silesia on
dialog: that windy March night in 1944 thumbed their
dialog: collective nose at the entire Third Reich ané all
dialog: it stood for.
dialog: "They triumphed, through the only means left to .
dialog: them, over an idea that was rotten from the core
dialog: out. And. they proved for all posterity that men,
dialog: working together, can dig a damned deep hole in
text: the ground - or build a shining Tower of Babel.
