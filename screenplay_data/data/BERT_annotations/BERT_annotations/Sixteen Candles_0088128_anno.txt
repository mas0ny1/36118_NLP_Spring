scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAWN
text: A quiet, upper-middle class, North Shore Chicago suburb. A

text: Papers are pitched out the window. A dog runs between the
text: houses. It's early autumn.
scene_heading: EXT. BAKER HOUSE
text: An attractive, old, three-story brick colonial. A news-
text: paper flies into frame, strikes the corner of the house and
text: drops into the bushes, a good twenty feet from the porch.
text: An alarm clock goes off with a jarring bzzzzz!
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY
text: The alarm continues for a beat. It stops and the house
text: explodes with activity as the Baker family wakes and
text: scrambles about their morning activities. There's Jim
text: Baker, midforties, father, insurance executive, tall, lean,
text: somewhat meek-looking, in his suit pants and handlebar
text: undershirt scurrying to the bathroom.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Let's go! Chop, chop! We've got
dialog: relatives invading this afternoon!
text: He slams’the bathroom door. His wife, Brenda, whips out of
text: the bedroom in her housecoat and heads down the stairs.
text: She's also in her midforties, strong, attractive and
text: dominant. Mike Baker, ten, wanders out of his bedroom,
text: . stratching his rear end, yawning. He's young trouble,
dialog: preteen maniac boy.

dialog: Mike! Come on, pal, we're having a
dialog: wedding tomorrow. Why can't you
dialog: cooperate?
text: Ginny Baker, twenty-one, comes out of her room in panties
text: and a sweatshirt. She's very pretty, very pampered and
text: very sloppy. She slips past Jim as he scolds Mike, goes
text: into the bathroom and locks the door. Sara turns and
text: marches into the bathroom at the other end of the hall.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Dad, I didn't hit her. I'd like to
dialog: very much and I probably will later,
dialog: but give me a break, you know my

speaker_heading: MIKE

scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - THIRD FLOOR BEDROOM 11
text: It's a girl's bedroom done in antiques and frills. In
text: contrast to the mayhem on the first two floors, the third
text: floor is quiet and serene. A brilliant shaft of morning
text: sunlight shines down through a skylight above the brass
text: bed. The sheets and blankets are rumpled and kicked aside.
text: Samantha Baker stands before a floor mirror in the corner
text: of the room. Her back is to camera. A bath towel is
text: wrapped around her waist. She's staring at her body in the
text: mirror. She was up long before anyone else in the house
text: _ and has already showered. She puts a hand on her hip and
text: strikes a pose. She doesn't like it. She tries the other
text: hand. Both hands. She cocks her hip. Finally, she raises
text: both arms and strikes a Charles Atlas pose. She holds it
text: for a moment, then drops her arms. She groans.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - SAMANTHA'S FACE 12
text: She's young and pretty. No seething, precocious sexuality.
text: Just a pretty, young girl. She's frowning. Obviously dis-
text: pleased with her looks.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Chronologically, you're sixteen
dialog: today. Physically, you're still
dialog: fifteen.
text: She lifts her damp hair off her face and neck and examines
text: the effect. She's not pleased.

dialog: (drops
dialog: the hair)
dialog: Worthless.
text: She reaches down, out of frame, and comes up with a

dialog: No, I didn't expect to wake up trans-

dialog: sixteen is so major I'd wake up with
dialog: an improved mental state that would
text: show on my face. All that shows is
dialog: the fact that I don't have any tan
dialog: left.
dialog: (with a closing
dialog: sigh)
dialog: My family's probably pissed that I
dialog: haven't come down to let them wish
dialog: me ‘Happy Birthday'. I'll see you

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Hi, Sam. Better hurry.

speaker_heading: GEEK
