scene_heading: EXT. RURAL MAINE - NIGHT
text: LONG AERIAL SHOT over a sea of DARK WOODS. The moon hangs
text: over the trees on the horizon, obscured by thin clouds.
text: A cluster of lights below us. The sleepy town of LUDLOW,
text: MAINE. We pass over HOUSES nestled around ponds, a quaint
text: downtown, tiny roads branching into the surrounding hills.
text: The last of the houses slips away below as we move further
text: out over the endless trees, slowly descending down into --
scene_heading: EXT. DARK WOODS - CONTINUOUS
text: We're inside the woods now. Moon flickering through branches
text: as we pick up a NARROW PATH winding through the trees. Our
text: POV slows as we settle on a wooden sign nailed to a tree.
text: In hand painted childish scrawl it reads: PET SEMATARY.
dialog: 
text: As we HOLD on the sign, there’s a NOISE in the darkness.
text: ANIMAL FEET crunching through pine needles.
dialog: 
text: The shape of a DOG comes into view. Just a shadow standing
text: in the trail. Hulking, fur clumped and dirty. Eyes black.
text: The ragged dog walks down the trail past us as we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT
text: A wide, grassy lawn near the edge of the woods. Toys left
text: out for the night. A sprinkler tapping softly somewhere.
text: There’s a LIGHT in the second story window as --
text: The dog from the woods moves into frame. It stands still for
text: a long BEAT in the darkness. Looking at that window as we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BOY'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
text: A YOUNG BOY (9) sleeping in bed. A model of the solar system
text: travels in mechanical circles over his head. After a BEAT --
dialog: 2.
text: The boy opens his eyes, sensing something. After a BEAT, he
text: slides out of bed. As his feet come to the floor we NOTICE --
text: A shovel and some dirty clothes stashed under the bed.
text: The boy crosses to the window, peering out to --
text: THE BACKYARD. Toys. Sprinkler. No sign of the dog.
text: He walks to his bedroom door, slowly opening it to REVEAL --
text: Nothing there. Just an empty dark hallway.
scene_heading: INT. LONG DARK HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: The boy moves down the hall followed by his elongated SHADOW
text: that bends up the wall. He pauses by his parent’s room,
text: glancing at his MOTHER and FATHER sleeping in their bed.
text: He continues past their door, turning down the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Clothes and toys. A clock ticking softly. After a BEAT --
text: The Boy comes down the stairs. He moves across the room to
text: the front window, pulling the curtain back to peek out --
text: POV of the porch... the stairs... the empty lawn. Then --
text: A DARK SHAPE slips past!
text: The boy presses against the wall, terror rising as we HEAR --
text: Two soft SCRATCHES on the outside of the door.
text: Something wants to come inside. The boy stands for a BEAT,
text: not believing what he knows to be true. Afraid to move.
text: After a BEAT, he steps closer, reaching for the door --
text: CLOSE as he turns the knob, pulling it open to REVEAL --
dialog: Nothing there.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT LAWN - MOMENTS LATER
text: The sprinkler taps lightly along the side of the house as the
text: BOY comes down the porch stairs to the lawn in his pajamas.
text: He squints into the shadows, barely able to form the words --
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Buck? That you, boy?
text: The house looms behind him, front door hanging open as the
text: boy steps further out onto the lawn. BEHIND HIM we notice --
text: A dog shaped SHADOW slinking across the lawn.
dialog: 
text: The boy hears the noise and spins to SEE --
text: BUCK, the dog from the woods, standing in the shadows. The
text: dog's head hangs low, breathing slow and ragged.
text: The boy steps closer, eyes filled with wonder and awe.
speaker_heading: BOY (CONT'D)
dialog: I knew you'd come back. Jesse said
dialog: it wouldn’t work but I just knew...
text: The boy stops as Buck moves into the light. Drool swings
text: from his mouth, eyes heavy. A bloody scar over his eye.
speaker_heading: BOY (CONT'D)
dialog: You hungry? Want some food?
text: Buck just stares back. Dead eyes locked on the boy.
speaker_heading: BOY (CONT'D)
dialog: Buck, it’s me. You’re okay now.
text: Buck steps forward. A hint of BLACKNESS swirls in his eyes.
dialog: 
text: The boy glances at the open door. He desperately wants to
text: turn and run as the dog’s mouth tightens into a growl.
speaker_heading: BOY (CONT'D)
dialog: Stay outside, okay? 1I/’11 bring you
dialog: some food...
text: The boy turns toward the house, trying to walk slowly as --
text: SQUEEEK!!! He steps on a plastic DOG TOY on the lawn.
text: The boy looks over his shoulder as the dog charges. He runs
text: for the house in his pajamas, the dog gaining ground behind
text: him. The boy hits the stairs, slipping and scrambling onto
text: the porch... the open front door only a few feet away --
text: But he slips. Crashing to the ground on his chest. Lights
text: go on in the house. We hear voices coming from upstairs.
text: CLOSE on the boy’s terrified face as he slowly lifts himself
text: onto his hands to look back over his shoulder and SEE --
text: The dog in the shadows. Eyes pure black. Teeth bared.
text: The boy scrambles for the open door as the dog --
text: LUNGES RIGHT INTO CAMERA and we --
text: SMASH TO BLACK.
text: The screaming, snarling dog attack fades into the fluttering
text: sound of a playing card in the spokes of a bike as we --
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
text: CLOSE on the wheel of a bike with two PLAYING CARDS pinned to
text: the front forks with laundry pins. PULL OUT to REVEAL --
text: ELLIE (9), hair flowing behind her, eyes shining with life as
text: she steers her bike up onto the sidewalk and into --
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - CONTINUOUS
text: The driveway of a modest, single story home on a block with a
text: dozen identical single story homes. Ellie slows down by the
text: real estate sign in the front yard that exclaims: SOLD!
text: GAGE (3) sees Ellie on her bike and his face lights up --
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: Ellie home!
text: Ellie’s parents RACHEL and LOUIS look up from cramming the
text: last of their belongings into a station wagon. They’re
text: sweating and tired from packing. Rachel glances at Louis.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Let me talk to her.
text: Rachel comes over to Ellie, looking a little concerned --
speaker_heading: RACHEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Where'd you go, honey? Thought you
dialog: were just saying goodbye to
dialog: Stephanie?
text: Ellie pulls a cute mouse-shaped CAT TOY out of her pocket.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I didn’t want Church to be bored.
text: Rachel’s heart melts. Ellie is thoughtful and sensitive.
text: Louis comes up behind them to grab Ellie’s bike. He pauses
text: for a moment, checking in with her.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You gonna be okay?
text: Ellie nods but we can see she’s a little unsure.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: You think the kids at my new school
dialog: will be nice?
text: Louis kneels down, brushing the hair out of her eyes.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: They're going to love you, El.
text: Rachel comes over, taking a last look at their old house --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Good bye, Boston.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: AERIAL SHOTS over BOSTON, bays and bridges spill out below.
text: A tangle of buildings, roads and waterways as we PICK UP --
text: The STATION WAGON crossing the ZAKIM BRIDGE, heading out of
text: the city. The car drives up I-95, through coastal towns, and
text: waterways, finally past a sign reading: WELCOME TO MAINE.
text: Rural and beautiful. The car turns inland on a small highway
text: winding up into the woods as the sun sinks behind the trees.
scene_heading: INT. STATION WAGON - SUNSET
text: Louis drives while Rachel navigates. Ellie and Gage sit in
text: back, Church in his pet carrier between them. Gage bangs on
text: Church's carrier with a toy to get Ellie’s attention.
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: Ellie. Ellie. Ellie-phant!
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Mom? It’s not fair to Church.
text: Rachel glances back. Church is sleeping with his new toy.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I’m pretty sure Church is okay.
text: Ellie turns to the window, ignoring Gage as Louis slows down.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Must be some kind of ordinance
dialog: against road signs around here?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Are we lost?
text: Louis stares out an intersection leading into endless trees.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: No. We’re not lost.
dialog: (to Rachel)
dialog: Are we?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: If we don’t like it in Maine do we
dialog: get to move back to Boston?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Daddy's new job is here, honey.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Think about it, El. Your back yard
dialog: is going to be a whole forest.
text: Ellie looks out the window.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
text: Forests are boring.
text: UP AHEAD we see a small market advertising bait and tackle.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: That’s it. Remember that market?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Hang on, everyone.
text: Louis makes the turn onto a narrow two lane road.
scene_heading: EXT. RURAL MAINE - LATER
text: The station wagon cruises down a long stretch of empty road.
scene_heading: INT. STATION WAGON - DUSK
text: Louis rubs his eyes. Gage has fallen asleep. Rachel stares
text: out at big homes set back in the trees. After a BEAT --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: So quiet out here.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Good quiet?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Just quiet.
text: He glances over --
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Having second thoughts?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: We could never afford a place like
dialog: this in Boston.
text: Louis studies her face. That didn’t answer his question.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Daddy! Watch out!
text: The DOG from the opening stands in the road.
text: Louis hits the brakes, screeching to a halt. The creepy dog
text: stands in the headlights, unmoving. Its fur is clumped and
text: dirty, eyes red and dark. Just staring into the light.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Everyone okay?
text: Ellie and Rachel nod as the dog walks slowly around the car.
text: Gage opens his sleepy eyes as the dog pauses, looking at him.
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: Doggie...
text: The dog turns, slipping off into the trees.
speaker_heading: GAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Bye bye.
scene_heading: EXT. CREED HOUSE - EVENING
text: Crickets so loud it’s almost unnatural. Headlights flicker
text: in the trees as the station wagon creeps up the driveway.
text: Louis parks by a large two-story home with wraparound wooden
text: porch and swing. The same house from the opening sequence.
text: Rachel pulls Gage out of his seat as Ellie walks to her
text: father, taking his hand, staring up at the stars overhead.
text: The night is warm. A light wind. Dark and magical.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Why don’t we have stars like this
dialog: in Boston.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: We do. You just can’t see ‘em.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What do you think of the house, El?
text: Ellie walks forward, looking up at the massive house.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: This whole place is ours?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Front door should be open. Movers
dialog: dropped everything off today.
text: Ellie opens the door, standing for a moment in the doorway.
text: Then she takes off running from room to room, switching on
text: lights, her excited voice echoing through empty spaces.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (0.S.)
dialog: It’s so big! I love it!!
text: Louis walks with Rachel and Gage into the house as we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: The house is partially unpacked, boxes and rugs lying around.
text: Church lies on his favorite cushion in the front window as
text: Louis and Rachel unpack boxes in the living room.
text: Louis prepares to nail a picture hanger into the wall --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Hey, don’t. Gage is napping.
text: Louis leans the picture against the wall, looking around --
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Did Ellie finish her room?
text: BEHIND HIM Church stretches and jumps down to the floor.
text: As Rachel and Louis continue talking we drop into --
text: CAT POV weaving through boxes, down the hallway into the
text: kitchen, across the room to his food bowl.
text: Church pauses, hungrily finishing what’s left in the bowl.
text: Back in CAT POV as we slip under the table and out into the
dialog: hallway.
text: Our POV turns to see a door sitting open. We approach.
text: Church stands at the door, sniffing the damp air. We hear
text: Louis looking for Ellie somewhere in the house.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Ellie? Where’d you go?
text: Church pushes the basement door open, slipping down into --
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: CAT POV as we come down the stairs, slipping under the work
text: bench and finally crossing to some shelves where we FIND --
text: A_ small CUBBY HOLE covered by a faded curtain.
dialog: 
text: Church pauses. There’s something in there. As he sniffs --
text: TWO HANDS shoot out pulling the cat into the tiny space.
dialog: 
text: INSIDE THE CUBBY Ellie sits curled up and trying not to
text: giggle as she holds Church in her lap.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Quiet, okay? We’re hiding.
text: After a BEAT we hear heavy feet coming down the stairs. A
text: shape moves behind the curtain. Two feet are standing there.
text: Ellie screams as Louis suddenly pulls the curtain back!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Found you!
text: He grabs Ellie as she giggles and squirms away.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: No fair! Church gave me away!!
text: Church takes off up the stairs. Ellie follows.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s my special hiding place.
dialog: Don’t tell anyone, okay?
dialog: 10.
text: Louis follows them out of the basement.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE YARD - DAY
text: Rachel works in her vegetable garden, setting up tall stakes
text: and strings for her bean plants. Ellie comes around down the
text: porch stairs, walking over to her mother.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Can I watch a show? I’m bored.
text: Rachel pulls off her gloves, wiping her brow --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Why don’t you play outside? It’s
dialog: so nice out.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: (sulking)
dialog: There’s nothing to do...
text: Her voice drifts off as we HEAR a soft repetitive DRUM BEAT
text: somewhere. Dry and sad. Ellie and Rachel walk around the
dialog: side of the house to SEE --
text: A procession of CHILDREN marching toward the woods.
dialog: 
text: A SOMBER BOY in the front pushes a wheelbarrow with a LUMP
text: wrapped in a sheet and some pieces of WOOD and a SHOVEL.
text: He is followed by a single file line of children in ANIMAL
text: MASKS, walking slowly. At the end of the line, a GIRL ina
text: CAT MASK pounds out the funeral march. Strange and surreal.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: What are they doing?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: Looks like some kind of procession.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: What’s a procession?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: Like a parade but not for fun.
text: Ellie walks closer, mesmerized as the strange children make
text: their way into the trees. The drum beat echoing.
text: The Girl at the end of the line in the Cat Mask glances back
text: at Ellie as she turns up into the woods. Ellie follows,
text: walking to the edge of the lawn where the trail begins.
dialog: 11.
text: ELLIE'S POV of the hand painted sign reading: PET SEMATARY.
text: The same trail we saw in the opening.
dialog: 
text: Ellie starts up the trail, then stops. There’s something
dialog: about this place. It’s too dark. Too frightening.
text: A HAND touches Ellie’s shoulder and she jumps. It’s Rachel.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Must be a pet cemetery up there...
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: (sad)
dialog: One of their pets died?
text: Rachel can see Ellie’s frightened --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Let’s go help daddy. Gage will be
text: waking up from his nap soon.
text: Ellie looks relieved as they turns back. As they walk back
text: down the trail, she glances over to SEE --
text: Their NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE peeking through the woods.
dialog: 
text: A cottage with gray shingles, smoke rising from a chimney,
text: dark and mossy. There’s someone in the window.
text: Ellie looks up, noticing her mother has continued walking.
text: She quickly runs to catch up to Rachel as we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ELLIE’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Stuffed animals, posters, books. A night light sends purple
text: butterflies across the walls in lazy circles. Ellie lies in
text: bed as Rachel and Louis tuck her in. She seems worried.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You okay?
text: Ellie speaks softly, her mind racing with scary thoughts.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: When is Church going to die?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Everyone has to die sometime.
dialog: That’s how life works.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Even you and mommy?
text: Rachel comes over, sitting on the side of the bed --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You're thinking about all this
dialog: because of that place in the woods?
text: Ellie nods. Louis takes a breath, then launches in --
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: When someone dies... even a cat or
text: a doggie... their body goes into
dialog: the ground but that doesn’t mean
dialog: they’re gone forever...
text: OFF Ellie’s confused look --
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Remember when Nana passed away and
dialog: we all flew down to Florida?
text: Ellie nods.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What daddy’s saying is Nana’s body
dialog: went into the cemetery but her
dialog: spirit went up to heaven. She’s up
dialog: there right now. I bet she can
dialog: even see your new room.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: People in heaven can watch us?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I don’t know if it works like that
dialog: exactly. No one really knows --
text: Rachel shoots Louis a look and he quickly switches gears.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You don’t need to worry about any
dialog: of this stuff because Church and me
dialog: and mommy are going to be around
text: for a long, long time.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: You promise?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Promise.
text: Louis and Rachel lean in to kiss Ellie good night as we --
dialog: 13.
text: PUSH past Ellie’s worried face to the dark WOODS outside.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MASTER BEDROOM —- LATER
text: Louis stands in his pajama bottoms brushing his teeth. As he
text: spits out and rinses, Rachel comes up behind him --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (imitating him)
dialog: Everyone has to die sometime, kid.
dialog: Deal with it!
text: He turns around to face her, a playful smile on his face.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You're the one who said dead people
dialog: watch us from the sky. That’s
dialog: pretty creepy for a kid.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: They are!
text: She pushes him over to the bed.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Why do you doctors have such a hard
dialog: time with spirituality? You really
dialog: think people are just flesh and
dialog: bones with no soul?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I’m just injecting an element of
dialog: reality into her life. Everything
dialog: you're selling is a fairy tale.
text: A flicker of pain in Rachel’s eyes --
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean your
dialog: sister...
text: Rachel sits on the edge of the bed.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I know what it’s like to lose
dialog: someone when you’re a kid. I don’t
dialog: want her thinking about this stuff
dialog: yet. Let her have the fairy tale.
text: He lies down, pulling her into her arms --
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You're right. I’m sorry. Let’s
dialog: live the fairy tale.
text: Rachel folds into Louis’ chest, kissing him.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CREED HOUSE - MORNING
text: The sun rises over the Creed home and surrounding woods.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK YARD - DAY
text: Ellie stands in the grass, staring at the trail leading up
text: into the woods. She takes a breath, heading up the trail.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER
text: Ellie walks past the PET SEMATARY sign, winding up the narrow
text: trail, heading deeper into the forest.
text: Trees block the light as Ellie grows smaller in the trail,
text: disappearing around a corner. Swallowed up by the woods.
scene_heading: EXT. PET CEMETERY - DAY
text: Ellie comes to a clearing of grass with tiny GRAVESTONES.
text: She slows down, taking in the sudden presence of death all
text: around her. Each name represents a family pet who died.
dialog: 
text: She pauses by a freshly dug grave. The wooden sign reads:
text: TALULAH. Best dog in the world. June 6, 2016. A dog collar
text: hangs on the sign. This must be the pet from the procession.
text: She walks around the rings of graves. Birds, cats and
text: hamsters. She stops at one: Biffer. One Helluva Sniffer.
text: Oct. 1958. The ones in the innermost ring are old and
text: decayed, clumps of grass obscuring the names: SMUCKEY. 1917.
text: The wind blows through the trees, catching Ellie’s attention.
text: She notices the path through the cemetery stops abruptly at a
text: pile of branches and trees. Ellie looks for a way around the
text: huge pile but it’s blocked by thorny THICKET and BRAMBLE.
dialog: 15.
text: Someone built a DEADFALL to block the path.
dialog: 
text: Ellie reaches for the first limb. It creaks under her
text: weight. She moves higher, branches bending as she makes her
text: way to the top of the pile. Suddenly, a VOICE behind her --
speaker_heading: OLD MAN (0.S.)
dialog: Get off of there!
text: Ellie turns and loses her balance. She tumbles backwards to
text: the ground, cutting her knee open on a rock as the OLD MAN
text: runs up behind her, glancing nervously at the deadfall.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You kids shouldn’t be up here.
text: Ellie touches the blood on her leg, eyes fluttering.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I cut my knee...
text: FADE TO BLACK.
text: BOOTS crunching through underbrush as we FADE IN to --
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
text: The OLD MAN carries Ellie down the trail in his arms. His
text: hands are huge and rough, face hard as if carved from stone.
text: Ellie’s head lolls as he walks. Her eyes drift open --
text: ELLIE'S UPSIDE DOWN POV: the trees bouncing up and down with
text: the movement of his gait. She passes out again.
scene_heading: FADE TO BLACK:
text: The sound of water running as we FADE IN to --
scene_heading: INT. JUD'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Ellie wakes up on a couch in a dark cottage. It smells like
text: cigarettes and stale beer. Water runs in a sink somewhere.
text: Ellie sits up, realizing she’s in a stranger’s home.
dialog: 
text: Her head is still foggy as she looks around at DEAD ANIMALS
text: mounted on the walls. Taxidermy. A rifle on the wall.
text: Ellie stands, heart racing. This feels dangerous. Suddenly,
text: the OLD MAN appears in the door behind. Ellie spins around --
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Who are you? How did I get in
dialog: here?
text: The OLD MAN from the pet cemetery steps into filtered light.
text: This is JUD (60's), unflinching, a reclusive hunter with a
text: five day beard and some hard years etched in his eyes.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: You fell off the deadfall. Must
dialog: have passed out when you saw blood.
text: Ellie takes a step backwards, assessing the threat.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I should get home. My mom...
text: Jud drags an ottoman across the floor with a heavy scratch.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Sit down. Not gonna bite you.
text: Ellie senses something in Jud’s eyes. This guy is shy, not
dialog: mean. He’s not intimidating. Just _a_sad_ and lonely man.
text: Ellie sits down putting her leg on the ottoman. Jud sits
text: across from her, cleaning the scrape with a warm washcloth.
text: She watches him as he works, concentrating. After a BEAT --
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: What’s your name?
text: Jud ignores her for a BEAT, then --
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: You first.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Eleanor Creed. We just moved here
dialog: from Boston.
text: Jud nods, glancing up --
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Jud.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I saw you in the window the other
dialog: day. You're our neighbor.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Lived in this house for sixty three
dialog: years. Seen a lot of people come
dialog: and go from yours.
text: Jud walks to the bathroom to look for something.
speaker_heading: JUD (CONT'D)
text: (mumbling as he rummages)
dialog: Kids shouldn't be up in those
text: woods. Not safe up there.
text: Ellie notices a PHOTO on the table nearby and picks one up.
text: ANGLE on the photo: Jud in a suit, much younger, standing
text: proudly next to a PRETTY GIRL in a bridal gown.
text: Ellie notices Jud in the doorway holding a Band-Aid.
speaker_heading: JUD (CONT'D)
dialog: You make a habit of going through
dialog: people’s things?
text: Ellie sets the photo down. She studies him a moment, then --
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Is that your wife?
text: Jud sits again, unwrapping the Band-Aid. He glances up.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Her name was Norma.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: She’s pretty.
text: Jud busies himself with the Band-Aid. Hiding his sadness.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened to her?
text: Jud looks up. This girl is confounding him.
speaker_heading: JUD
text: She was sick. Passed away.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: She's still here, you know. She's
dialog: watching us from heaven.
text: Ellie smiles at Jud. A layer of ice melts off his heart.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: That so, Ellie?
dialog: 18.
text: Ellie nods, jumping up. She walks to the door --
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: You want to come and meet my cat?
dialog: His name is Church.
text: Jud stands up.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: I don’t keep pets. Not around
dialog: here.
text: Ellie nods to the animals stuffed on the walls --
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: You only like to shoot them?
text: Jud sighs, following her to the door --
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Fine. I’11l come meet your damn cat
dialog: if you want...
scene_heading: INT. CREED HOUSE - DAY
text: Ellie walks out of the woods with Jud. Rachel looks up from
text: her garden, surprised to see Ellie with some strange man.
text: She comes over, wiping her hands on her work pants --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: El? Everything okay?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
text: I fell on a rock. Jud helped me.
text: Ellie points to the Band-Aid. Rachel kneels down.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Oh, sweetie. You okay?
text: Ellie nods. Rachel stands, holding out her hand to Jud.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ELLIE

text: She points to her bedroom window upstairs --
speaker_heading: ELLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: My room’s on the second floor. Our

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Jud sits in a chair as Ellie performs a dance for him. Louis

text: This is Ellie’s favorite thing, spinning through the room,
text: free and easy, swooping past her parents to make them laugh.
text: Jud sips a beer, enjoying the show as Ellie finishes with a

speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: You can’t dad. She died.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Ellie, hey. That’s not polite.
text: Jud waves this idea away, standing up --
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Ellie didn’t mean anything by it.
text: He turns to Louis --
speaker_heading: JUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Been a long time since I got to sit

speaker_heading: LOUIS

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY

scene_heading: INT. JUD’S HOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: JUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Go on! Get out of here.

text: The woman’s face knits into a grimace of disappointment.
speaker_heading: MRS. HUGHES
dialog: Who the hell are you? Never seen

text: Louis slides a chair over, preparing to examine her foot.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: That’s because I’m new. My name’s
dialog: Doctor Louis Creed. I’m taking
text: over for Bill Jacobson.
text: The woman begrudgingly extends her swollen foot.

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: NURSE
text: A boy got hit by a truck.
text: Louis turns, following them around the corner as --

text: Louis waves the EMT’s through, falling in beside the gurney.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What do we know?
speaker_heading: EMT
dialog: (visibly shaken)
dialog: His, uh, name is Paskow. Victor

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Victor? Can you hear me?
text: The Boy moves his head, his single working eye finding Louis.

speaker_heading: VICTOR PASKOW
dialog: Don’t want to die...
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You're not dying, Victor. Stay
dialog: with me, okay? Stay with me...
text: They turn a corner into a TREATMENT AREA as the paramedics

speaker_heading: NURSE
text: Life Flight is on the way from

text: Louis nods. That’s too long. He goes back to Victor.
speaker_heading: LOUIS

speaker_heading: VICTOR PASKOW
dialog: I’m dying...
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: No, Victor. Just stay with me.

dialog: We need a hemostat on the femoral

text: There’s a buzz on the machine as Victor’s heart stops.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Goddammit. He’s coding!
text: Louis immediately begins compressions on Victor’s chest as --
text: Victor’s hand shoots out, gripping Louis’ arm. He pulls
text: Louis down toward his gasping mouth. Trying to form words --
speaker_heading: VICTOR PASKOW
text: I can feel it inside me now.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Feel what, Victor?
text: Victor takes a ragged inhale. Eyes locked on Louis.
speaker_heading: VICTOR PASKOW
dialog: Death.
text: Victor's body seizes up, going rigid as his eyes slip away.
text: Then he softens. His hand loosens its grip. He’s gone.
text: After a BEAT, Louis lifts Victor’s hand away, laying it
text: across the boy’s chest. Louis turns to the Nurse, eyes down.

text: We hear a rustling as Church turns to SEE --
text: That evil Dog from the opening emerges from the woods.
dialog:

text: Church hisses, backing up.
scene_heading: INT. JUD’S HOUSE - SAME TIME
text: Jud dumps a pile of broken plate and food into the trash as --

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Sonofabitch!!

scene_heading: EXT. JUD’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

text: CRACK! We hear the SICKENING SNAP of bone breaking as the
text: Dog drops Church, racing off into the trees.
text: ANGLE on Church, blood seeping from puncture wounds.

speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: He’s probably out exploring.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: He shouldn’t be out in those woods.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Shhh, honey. Church will be fine.
dialog: You need to get some sleep.
text: Ellie lies back. Her mind spinning bad thoughts.

text: A HUGE 18 WHEELER roaring right toward his car.
dialog: 
text: The truck veers into the shoulder, missing his car by inches.
text: Louis watches in the mirror as the huge truck rumbles past, a

dialog: It’s Jud.

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Jesus... what happened?
text: Jud pulls the sheet back to reveal Church, bloody puncture
text: wounds on his side, blood crusted on his nose and mouth.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Wild dog. All kinds of animals in
dialog: those woods...
text: Louis touches Church’s body. It’s already going stiff.
speaker_heading: JUD (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s my fault. Church had jumped
dialog: in here and made a mess. I got so
text: steamed, I shoved him out the door.
text: Jud pours two shots from a bottle of whisky. He throws one
text: back, hands shaking. He hands the other to Louis.
speaker_heading: JUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Animals out here are scavengers.
dialog: Bet that old dog had his eye on
dialog: Church since you guys moved in.
text: Louis tosses his whisky back, taking a moment to think.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What do I tell Ellie? The move has
dialog: already been so hard for her. This

text: Jud watches Louis. An idea brewing in his head.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I don’t know.
text: Louis nods as he pulls the sheet back over the cat.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You mind keeping him here while I

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I saw him myself. His neck is

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Dammit, Church. Loved that cat...
text: Louis glances at the stairs to make sure Ellie isn’t there.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Maybe we can do a little burial up

dialog: chance to say a proper goodbye.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No, I don’t want her to start
text: obsessing about death and dying
dialog: like I did when I was her age.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: So what do we do?
text: Rachel wipes her tears, formulating a decision --

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I don’t know... sometimes cats run

scene_heading: EXT. JUD’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Jud? You asleep?
text: No answer. Louis turns, thinking what to do when he SEES --
text: A flashlight heading up through the trees.
dialog: 
text: It’s Jud and he’s carrying something over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PET CEMETERY - NIGHT
text: Jud stands amongst the graves, eyes bleary from too much

text: and tosses his shovel to the ground. Then he turns --
text: Taking a couple wobbly steps through the markers as his light
text: comes to rest on the one that reads: BIFFER.
text: Jud sways in the moonlight, taking another slug of whisky.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: There you are.
dialog: 30.
text: His eyes move up to notice something else --
text: The DEADFALL across the cemetery lit by the moon.
dialog: 
text: Jud stares at the twisted pile of dead branches, unable to
text: turn away as the wind picks up in the trees. Finally, he
text: kneels down in front of Biffer’s grave, tears on his cheeks --
speaker_heading: JUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Goddamn, I miss you, boy...
text: A SHADOW appears behind Jud, growing as it approaches --
text: Jud_startles, turning to see Louis standing behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I saw the flashlight.
text: Louis reaches for the bottle in Jud’s hand, taking a swallow.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Didn't think I’d make you do this
dialog: all by yourself, did you?
text: Jud gathers himself, pointing at his dog’s grave.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: That's my dog Biffer right there.
text: Jud’'s gaze drifts to the deadfall again, lost in memory.
speaker_heading: JUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Death changes you when you’re a
dialog: kid. Gets into your bones.
text: Louis takes another swig of whisky, studying Jud’s face.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Let’s get this done.
text: Louis hands the bottle of whisky back to Jud, grabbing the
text: shovel off the ground to dig a hole. As he starts to work --
text: Jud takes a step toward the deadfall --
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I need to see it...
text: Jud picks up the sheet with the cat and walks away.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: See what? Jud?
dialog: 31.
text: Jud ignores him, walking toward the deadfall. Louis follows,
text: holding the shovel in his hand as he stumbles in the dark.
text: But Jud is already climbing, scrambling over dead branches.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Where the hell are you going?
text: Louis shouts as Jud disappears over the top of the deadfall.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: This is fine right here!

speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Crazy old bastard.
text: Louis starts to climb.
scene_heading: EXT. BEYOND THE DEADFALL - CONTINUOUS
text: Louis drops to the ground on the other side. He takes a few

text: the dark trees. There’s nothing. No sign of Jud. Then --
text: The flicker of Jud’s flashlight. Louis follows.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Jud, wait up!
text: Louis pushes through the trees, losing the trail. It’s pitch
text: black as dead branches scrape at his arms. He pauses,
text: noticing something carved into the trunk of a tree --
text: A primitive SYMBOL. Native and ancient. Foreboding.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: The hell..?
text: LOUIS’ POV blurs for a moment. The symbol on the tree wavers
text: as a buzzing sound builds in his head. Under that sound --
text: A whispering in the trees. The sound of voices long dead.
text: Louis pushes forward. There are more symbols now. Different
text: ones. Carved into the trees like some ancient warning.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: JUD? ?

text: water. Fog curls as Jud wades out into the shallow marsh.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
text: Jud ignores him, wading into the water. Louis comes to the
text: edge of the bog. He pauses, his vision blurring again.
text: Shadows shift and move. The darkness is alive.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Jud, man. Stop.
text: Jud pauses in the water, pointing at something --
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Over there.
text: Louis follows Jud’s finger to SEE --
text: A circular MOUND OF DIRT sticking out of the marsh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUD (CONT'D)
dialog: It has to be right there.
text: Jud sloshes up onto the mound of dirt. Louis calls out --
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I don’t understand. What is this
dialog: place?
text: Jud drops the sheet with the cat on the ground, turning back
text: to Louis. The wind swirls with that soft whispering voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Can’t you hear that? It’s alive.
text: Louis shakes his head, sloshing out into the bog. He steps
text: up onto the mound of dirt, tossing the shovel down.
text: Church’s dead face stares up at him in the moonlight.
speaker_heading: JUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Bury your cat. Right here.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: This is crazy...
text: Louis turns, stumbling back in the water. Then he stops.
dialog: 33.
text: The grass rustles around him. Wind whispering. He can’t
dialog: leave and Jud knows it. This place won’t let him.
text: Louis turns back to see Jud holding out the shovel.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Bury your cat.
text: CLOSE as the shovel slams into the ground.
text: Dirt. Shovel. Dirt. Shovel. Dirt. Shovel. Low and
text: rhythmic like a heartbeat as a hole opens in the ground.

text: sound asleep. His hands are still caked with dirt.
text: Louis sits on the edge of the bed, trying to piece his memory

speaker_heading: RACHEL

dialog: Come back. It’s too early...
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Can't sleep.

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Morning, sweetie.

speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Church, honey. Jud and I went to
dialog: look for him last night.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Remember how I was telling you how
dialog: sometimes when cats move to a new
dialog: home they get the urge to explore?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: It’s okay. He didn’t run away.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Well, we don’t know for sure...
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Yes we do, dad. He was outside my
dialog: window last night so I let him in.
text: Louis notices CAT PRINTS on the comforter. Thick black mud.
text: His bloods turns to ice. It can’t be Church.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Oh, honey. That was a different
dialog: cat... one of the neighbor’s...
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: No it wasn’t. Look.
text: Ellie points behind him to the closet.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (CONT'D)
text: He’s right there.

text: Church innocently licking his paws. Alive and well.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (barely audible)
dialog: Can't be...
text: Rachel comes up next to Louis, giving him a “what the fuck”
text: look. He shakes his head, completely at a loss, reeling.
text: Louis kneels down, reading the cats collar: CHURCHILL.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: Poor guy’s all covered in mud.
text: Louis reaches out for Church, his hand getting closer.
text: Church backs away, his ears going flat, growling low.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Easy. Just want to take a look...
text: Louis tries to reach for Church but the cat hisses, swatting
text: his finger. Louis pulls his hand back.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Ouch!
text: Church darts past Louis, running out of the room. Ellie
text: slides out of bed, glaring at her dad.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Leave him alone, dad.
text: Louis puts his finger in his mouth as Ellie runs after her
text: cat. Rachel turns to Louis once she’s gone.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You said he was dead?
speaker_heading: LOUIS

speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: That’s what you wanted, wasn’t it?
text: Louis thinks about this. There’s some truth to that.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
text: That cat was dead, Jud. His body

speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Ellie happy he’s back?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
text: Of course she is. She’s thrilled.

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Hmm? No... not real...

text: Louis puts his plate in the sink, glancing out to the woods.
text: Then he notices something else in the window --
text: THE REFLECTION of Church sitting on the table behind him.
dialog: 
text: Church’s image is surrounded by the trees outside, half in
text: shadow. Sinister and evil. Louis turns around.
text: He stares at the cat for a moment, sensing something strange.
text: Church just stares back with his yellow eyes.
dialog: 
text: Louis goes to the cabinet, taking out a bag of kibble.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Down to eight lives, buddy.
text: Louis pours food in Church’s bowl, jiggling the bag.
text: Church ignores him. Just staring back at Louis.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Not hungry? That’s a first.
text: Louis moves closer. He can see the puncture marks on
text: Church's ribs, now scabbed and matted under dirty fur.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: (softly)
dialog: What the hell happened to you?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Louis lies on the bed as Rachel walks past him in her

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Maybe he was paralyzed? You said
dialog: it was his neck.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I said his neck was broken.
text: She comes back to the bed with a JOINT in her hand. She
text: offers it to Louis. He shakes his head --
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I can’t tonight. My head.
text: Rachel puts the joint in her side drawer, lying next to him.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You guys were drinking. Maybe
dialog: Church was in shock or something?
text: Louis rolls onto his stomach, mumbling into the pillow.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Didn’t seem like shock. Seemed
dialog: like dead.
text: Rachel crawls onto Louis’ back to rub his shoulders.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Well, Ellie’s happy.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: That’s what Jud said.
text: Louis closes his eyes, finally relaxing a little. She leans
text: down close, her hair spilling across his body.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It’s been a tough month. Your new
dialog: job and Church. We need to have
dialog: some fun. Let’s throw a party for
dialog: Gage’'s birthday. Have our Boston
dialog: friends come out, my parents..?
text: Louis sighs, flipping over to face her.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I love all of that except the part
dialog: about your parents.
text: Rachel makes a face, pushing down on his chest.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Jerk...
text: He pulls her close, kissing her.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Stoner.
text: They kiss more passionately now, rolling together on the bed.

text: CAT POV watching Rachel and Louis make love. After a BEAT --
text: The POV turns, gliding low and smooth over the floor, down

text: CHURCH sits outside Gage’s bedroom, nudging the door open
text: with his nose.
scene_heading: INT. GAGE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Back to CAT POV as Church slinks into the room, looking
text: around, clocking the mobile on the wall, the night light, the

text: We hear Ellie’s voice from somewhere in the house.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (0.S.)

dialog: As it settles we HEAR --
dialog: Those soft voices we heard in the woods.
dialog: 
text: Louis suddenly opens his eyes in bed. Wide awake.
text: He swallows, trying to assess if he is awake or dreaming.
dialog: 41.
text: The wind rises and the curtain billows, the paper flutters.
text: He shivers, sitting up on his elbows. Something doesn’t feel
text: right. The house is too quiet. He glances over --
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Rach? Hey, you awake..?
text: No answer from Rachel. She’s sleeping on her side, facing
text: the other way. Louis reaches over, shaking her gently --
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you close the window in Ellie’s
dialog: room? Rach..?
text: Louis shakes her again and she rolls back to REVEAL --
dialog: It’s Victor Paskow.
text: White jaw bone gleaming through his shredded face. Louis
text: pushes backwards, getting tangled in the sheets as --
text: Victor's hand clamps onto his leg.
speaker_heading: VICTOR PASKOW
dialog: It’s cold, Louis. Cold...
text: Louis screams, shoving himself backwards out of bed. He

text: It’s only Rachel. She clicks on the light, groggy.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Louis looks up at Rachel, unable to speak. Then --
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (unsure)

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (re. Victor)
dialog: That’s so sad. Why didn’t you tell
dialog: me what happened?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: The whole thing with Church
dialog: happened that night. Guess I just
dialog: tried to put it out of my mind...
text: Rachel comes over, sliding a chair close to him --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Please don’t do that. I need to
dialog: know what’s going on with you.
text: Louis nods, memories of Victor washing over him --
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: He was a kid, Rach. Maybe five or
text: six years older than Ellie.
dialog: (glancing at her)
dialog: If we were in Boston, I could have
dialog: done more. Maybe saved his life.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Oh, honey. You were there for him.

dialog: lands.
text: Louis leans closer. There is a shaded area with a header
dialog: explaining: Area of Extinction Event (1788).
text: Louis clicks another link and suddenly we SEE --
text: The SYMBOLS that were carved into the trees. Below each one

text: Louis sits back as a charcoal sketch of the LAST TRIBAL CHIEF
text: loads on the screen. His eyes are pure black.

text: Church tries to squirm away but Ellie holds him down --
speaker_heading: ELLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hang on, Church! There’s something
dialog: gross in your hair.
text: She tries to brush the cat but Church SPINS and HISSES,

speaker_heading: LOUIS

speaker_heading: ELLIE

speaker_heading: LOUIS

scene_heading: INT. COUNTRY RECORDS OFFICE - DAY
text: Louis follows LIONEL HAVERING (70's), administrator of public

speaker_heading: HAVERING
dialog: They've been talking about putting

dialog: for years but with all the budget
dialog: cuts we’ve had...
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Our house, 2116 Bear Creek. It

text: Havering glances at Louis --
speaker_heading: HAVERING

dialog: town... but that one tends to come
text: up in the system more than others.
text: He pulls out a surveyors map from the 1950's, spreading it
text: out across his desk. Louis joins Havering as he points --
speaker_heading: HAVERING (CONT'D)
dialog: Here’s your house. Top of Bear
dialog: Creek Road. Only other person

speaker_heading: LOUIS

speaker_heading: HAVERING (CONT'D)

dialog: under your house was part of the

dialog: ‘til the early 1900's that it got
dialog: officially incorporated.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I thought the Mi’kmagq died off in
dialog: some kind of extinction event?
speaker_heading: HAVERING
dialog: Some say they moved north. Some
dialog: say they got smallpox. All we know
dialog: for sure is they never came back.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What about the people who had the
dialog: house before us? The Pearsons.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: HAVERING
dialog: Moved away after they lost their

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: And the people before them?

scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
text: Rachel and Louis stand by the grave holding Gage’s hand.
text: It’s cold. Summer has broken. Fall around the corner. This
text: time the image doesn’t fade. Instead, we stay on Rachel and
text: Louis as the MINISTER finishes his eulogy.
text: As he lowers his bible, all eyes turn to Rachel. She steps
text: up to a pile of FRESH EARTH, a small shovel sticking out.
text: RACHEL’S POV into the grave. A_kid size coffin below.
text: She reaches for the shovel but can’t bring herself to do it.
text: Louis’ hand closing around hers. They’1ll do it together.
text: Now looking up from inside the grave as Louis and Rachel
text: scoop a pile of dirt and toss it down into the hole.

scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY - THREE DAYS LATER
text: RACHEL’S PARENTS wait in their Mercedes with Gage as Louis
text: loads the bags into the trunk. Rachel approaches behind him
text: and he turns. She’s shattered, eyes red from crying.
dialog: 57.
dialog: For a BEAT there’s nothing to say. Then --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I can’t do this, Louis... please...
dialog: I don’t want to leave you here.
text: Louis holds her close, trying to stay strong.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I have to transfer my patients and
dialog: close my office. Three days tops.
text: The sun flickers through the trees. Louis squints at Rachel.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You shouldn’t be by yourself. We
dialog: can stay with you...
text: Louis glances over at Gage waiting in the car --
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: It’s better Gage isn’t here. I’11l
dialog: come and meet you.
text: He closes the trunk of the car, turning to Rachel. A long
text: BEAT as he moves the hair out of her eyes. They hug again.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: God, Louis, I miss her so much.
text: Louis holds Rachel tighter, eventually glancing up to SEE --
text: Church sitting on the porch in the background. Watching him.
text: His blood turns to ice. He pulls out of the hug.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Better get going. Your parents
dialog: don’t like to drive in the dark.
text: Rachel gets in the car as Rachel’s father backs down the

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY - LATER

text: He’s carrying a white garbage bag with a CAT SIZED LUMP.

dialog: 58.
text: Louis shoves the bag into the trash bin and drops the lid.
text: He turns and walks away. Numb. As he comes around the front

text: LOUIS POV of the trail leading up to the cemetery and beyond.
dialog: 
text: He pushes that thought away walking quickly inside.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Louis sits in front of a plate of untouched food. His knee

text: He pushes the food away, going to the cabinet and pulling
text: down a bottle of whisky.
scene_heading: INT. JUD’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Footsteps on the porch. The door swings open to REVEAL --
text: Louis standing there, poison thoughts stirring in his head.
dialog: 
text: He holds out a bottle of scotch.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I could use some company.
text: Jud goes to fetch a couple glasses. He drops ice into them
text: and comes back, setting them on the coffee table.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Saw Rachel leave earlier. Imagine
dialog: she took Gage with her?
text: Louis pours two stiff whiskies. Jud takes his and sits back
text: in his chair, firing up a cigarette. Louis nods.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
text: Boston. Her parent’s house.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: What about the cat?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I took care of it.

scene_heading: INT. JUD'S HOUSE - LATER
text: Time has passed. Ashtray full. Louis on the couch, watching
text: as Jud tries to stamp out his cigarette. He’s drunk.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: This is my fault. I should never
dialog: have shown you that place...
text: Louis looks down, barely able to hear those words.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: We both had a hand in it.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Grief poisons a man. It makes you
dialog: do things...
text: Louis watches Jud. The old man is slurring now, delirious.
speaker_heading: JUD (CONT'D)
dialog: It won’t stop now. It used Church
dialog: to get to Ellie. It wants more.
text: Jud looks up at Louis, suddenly focused, eyes wet with tears.
speaker_heading: JUD (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry, Louis. Ellie was the
dialog: first person to touch my heart ina
dialog: a long time. I didn’t want to see
dialog: her go through all that pain...
text: The glass slips from Jud’s hand, falling to the rug.
speaker_heading: JUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Dammit...
text: Jud tries to stand up, losing balance. Louis comes over.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Take it easy. I’11 clean this up.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Just need to close my eyes.
text: Louis stands over Jud, looking down as he passes out, then --

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
text: The sound of tires as LANE MARKERS whiz below us.
scene_heading: INT. STATION WAGON - CONTINUOUS
text: Louis drives through town, face dark and determined.

text: TARP, a BUCKET. The bottle of whisky.
scene_heading: EXT. LOCAL CEMETERY - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
text: Louis drives slowly past the FUNERAL HOME where we saw
text: Ellie's service, following the brick wall around to the back.
text: He shuts off the engine and lights, coasting quietly to a
text: stop by the WROUGHT IRON GATES of the rear service entrance.
scene_heading: EXT. LOCAL CEMETERY - GRAVEYARD - MOMENTS LATER
text: A tarp wrapped around tools hits the ground with a THUD.
text: A moment later, Louis drops to the ground. He stands up,
text: wiping dirt of his torn pants. As he starts to collect his
text: tools, we hear a CAR approaching. He turns to SEE --
text: A POLICE CAR making rounds.
text: Louis quickly grabs his tools, diving behind a pair of
text: headstones. He rolls onto his back, holding his breath.
text: The police car slows outside the gate, using a SEARCHLIGHT to
text: scan the lock and the chains.
text: The light sweeps just over Louis’ head.
dialog: 
text: Then he notices his SHOVEL lying out in the open grass.
text: As the light swings away, he reaches out and pulls the shovel
text: out of sight. The light swings back. It holds for a BEAT --
text: Then the police car moves on.
dialog: 61.
text: Louis gets up on his knees, watching as the police car rolls
text: around the corner. He quickly gathers his tools and ducks
text: into the graveyard.
scene_heading: EXT. LOCAL CEMETERY - ELLIE'S GRAVE - LATER
text: A headstone by a freshly dug grave: May 9, 2006 - July 19,
dialog: 2016. Eleanor Rose Creed. Our beloved daughter.
text: Louis drops his tools, staring at the name. The gruesome
text: nature of his task sinking in. He leans on a nearby tree and
text: vomits. Then he unfolds the tarp and picks up a shovel --
text: And starts to dig.
text: VARIOUS SHOTS of Louis digging. Shovel hitting ground. Back
text: breaking work. Dripping with sweat. The hole goes deeper.
text: He’s waist deep now using the bucket to bring the soil up.
text: LATER Louis is deep in the hole. We can only see the top of
text: Louis’ head and the occasional shovel moving. More dirt.
text: THUD! The dull, hollow sound of wood. Louis clears away
text: soil from around the lid of the casket and slides the tip of
text: the shovel into the seam. He leans down --
text: CRAAAACK!!! Wood creaks and groans, starting to give way.
text: CASKET POV looking up as the casket opens to REVEAL --
text: Louis standing over us. A length of rope in his hand. He
text: stares down, emotions washing over him as he whispers --

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CREED HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Louis crosses the lawn with Ellie’s body slung across his

text: Jud_is still passed out.
text: Louis slips up the trail, disappearing into the woods.
dialog: 62.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
text: Louis hikes up the dark trail, cradling Ellie’s body as he
text: walks. He passes under the PET SEMATARY sign, heading deeper
text: into the woods. Determined. Possessed.
text: As he passes some trees we catch a quick GLIMPSE of --
text: A PERSON standing in the shadows. Watching him.
text: Louis doesn’t notice as he continues up the dark trail.
scene_heading: EXT. PET CEMETERY - NIGHT
text: Louis steps out into the pet cemetery, thin shafts of
text: moonlight illuminating the tilted markers and stones.
text: He still holds Ellie in his arms, her dress spilling out over
text: his hands, legs bouncing stiffly as he walks.
text: Louis approaches the DEADFALL, pausing to shift Ellie’s body
text: in his hands as he prepares to climb the pile of branches.
speaker_heading: VICTOR PASKOW (0O.S.)
dialog: Stop, Louis... this is wrong...
text: Louis pauses. Sensing the presence in the cemetery.
text: He turns, squinting into the darkness.
text: Mist curls around the stones. There’s no one there.
text: Louis takes a breath, collecting himself. He’s exhausted.
text: Finally, he turns back to the deadfall into --
text: Victor Paskow blocking his way. Face still wet with blood.
text: Louis stumbles back, nearly tripping over a grave marker.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Get away from me!!!
text: As his voice rings out he looks again. Victor is gone.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: (quietly to himself)
dialog: You're not even real...
text: Louis looks down at Ellie’s face in the moonlight. She’s
text: beautiful and innocent. Even in this horrible state.
text: He approaches the deadfall again and begins to climb.
dialog: 63.
scene_heading: EXT. MARSHY BOG - NIGHT
text: Louis stumbles into frame, coming to the edge of the water
text: with Ellie’s body in his arms. He stands for a moment, a
text: silhouette against the black water. Staring out at --
text: The mound of dirt peeking up through the fog.
dialog: 
text: Louis pushes out into the water, wading over to the ground in
text: the center of the bog. As he lays Ellie’s body down --
text: We hear the WHISPERING VOICES in the trees.
dialog: 
text: The voices rise, swirling like the wind in shifting layers.
text: ANGLE on Ellie’s face. Eyes closed in the moonlight.
text: Louis reaches for a stone on the ground, slamming it into the
text: dirt. CLOSE as he digs, rips, pulls away dirt. Obsessed.
text: As he digs we WIDEN to REVEAL --
text: The wild dog from the opening on the shore of the marsh.
dialog: 
text: Watching Louis dig with its pure black eyes.
speaker_heading: LATER.
text: Louis sits over a shallow grave. Hands black with dirt.
text: As he turns to pull Ellie’s body into the hole he SEES --
text: Her eyes are open now. Staring right at him.
text: The VOICES are louder now. Powerful. Growing urgent as --
text: Louis quickly drags Ellie into the shallow grave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I’m sorry, baby...
text: Ellie's feet disappear, her legs, her dress, her hands.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m so sorry...
text: Louis pulls the last of the dirt over Ellie’s face.
text: The voices suddenly stop. Louis turns away from the grave,
text: ashamed and sick to his stomach in the horrible silence.
text: Then his face changes. What has he just done?
text: He drops to his knees, pulling the loose dirt away --
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: No, Ellie... no, no! I’m sorry..
text: But there’s nothing there. Ellie’s body is gone.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM — MORNING
text: HOT WATER pounds Louis as he sits on the floor of the shower.
text: He’s been there for hours trying to scrub the black dirt off

text: Louis ignores it. In the background we HEAR --
speaker_heading: RACHEL (ON MACHINE)
dialog: Louis, hey it’s me. Please pick
dialog: up. I really need to talk to you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Shit, okay. I’11 try you at the

scene_heading: EXT. BACK YARD - DAY
text: Louis busies himself in the yard, picking up the kid’s toys.
text: He glances over at the woods.
text: LOUIS’ POV of that trail leading up into the trees.
text: There’s no sign of movement. No sign of Ellie.
text: He goes back inside.
scene_heading: INT. ELLIE’S ROOM - DAY
text: Louis pushes the door open and steps inside. He hasn’t been
text: in here since Ellie’s death. It’s dark and musty.
text: He opens the shades and cracks the window. He strips the bed
text: and puts on new sheets. He arranges her stuffed animals.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY
text: Louis shoves his muddy clothes in the trash. He looks down --
text: The bag with Church’s body is there.
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
text: Then we hear a SOUND nearby, something moving through the
text: trees. Louis walks slowly around the side of the house --
text: There’s nothing. Just trees and shadows. He seems deflated.
text: When he turns back around --
text: JUD IS STANDING BEHIND HIM.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: What time you leave last night? I
dialog: must’ve passed out...
text: Louis closes the garbage bin to conceal his muddy clothes.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I don’t know, around midnight...
text: Jud notices Louis’ hands. Raw_and blistered from digging.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Wanna play some cards? I could
dialog: cook something on the grill.
text: Louis slides his hands into his pockets, moving to the door.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Maybe tomorrow. I need to start

speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: I'll bring some food over. You're

speaker_heading: LOUIS (INTO PHONE) (CONT'D)

text: He walks down the hallway into --
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Louis stands in the middle of the room. We can hear Rachel
text: still talking on the other end as he looks around.
text: There’s a soft tapping noise. He turns around to SEE --
text: The front door is open. The screen tapping in the wind.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Rach, sorry. I think Jud is coming
dialog: over. Let me call you in the
dialog: morning. I will. Love you, too.
text: Louis hangs up the phone, setting it down. He walks toward
text: the front door, peering out the window at the empty yard.
text: He opens the door, stepping out onto --
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - CONTINUOUS
text: Wood creaks under his weight, moths flutter around the light.
text: Louis comes down onto the grass, standing for a moment in the
text: yard. The screen door taps behind him in the wind.
text: Louis shivers, his mind playing tricks. Still nothing there.
text: As he comes back up the porch, Louis freezes on the top step.
text: ELLIE'S MUD COVERED SHOES SIT BY THE FRONT DOOR.
dialog: 
text: Louis steps closer, barely able to breathe.
text: The shoes Ellie was buried in. Thick with black mud.
text: There’s a small muddy HAND PRINT on the wall by the door.
dialog: 
text: Louis pulls the screen door open, stepping back into --
dialog: 67.
scene_heading: INT. CREED HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Louis steps into the room. Empty spaces and shadows suddenly
text: feel huge, the silence filled with tension and dread.
text: We hear a creak on the ceiling and he looks at the stairs.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (barely audible)
dialog: El?
text: Louis starts up the stairs, pausing at the top. The hallway
text: is dark and long. Ellie’s door hangs open --
text: A light spills out of her room. The purple night light.
text: Then something moves. A SHADOW fluttering inside the room.
text: Louis comes down the hallway, heart pounding. The shadow
text: inside the room twists and turns as he reaches for the door --
text: Louis approaches the door, pulling it open to SEE --
scene_heading: INT. ELLIE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The night light on. Purple butterflies float across the
text: wall. Both windows are open, curtains fluttering in the
text: breeze. That’s what was making the shadow.
text: Louis walks across the room, closing the windows. Then he
text: pauses, sensing something behind him in the closet --
text: The same closet where Church hid when he first returned.
text: Louis walks over, hand pulling the door open to REVEAL --
text: Nothing inside but Ellie’s clothes and toys.
dialog: 
text: He turns back to the room, thinking, nerves tense.
text: There’s something under the bed. A dark shadow. He comes
text: over to the bed, slowly lifting up the skirt to SEE --
text: A rumpled white dress caked in mud.
dialog: 
text: Louis pulls Ellie’s dress out, unfolding it in his hands.
text: Lace ripped and stained with black muddy dirt.
dialog: 
text: As he stares down in shock at the dress we HEAR --
text: BARE FEET running down the hall.
dialog: 68.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Louis comes out of door, looking around. The hall is empty.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Ellie?
text: She's playing a game. He steps out, heading down the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: A HAND reaches inside, clicking on the overhead light. Louis
text: looks into the darkness, terrified of what he might find.
text: The bulb overhead makes his shadow long as he comes down the
text: stairs. He peeks under the work bench. Nothing there.
text: He turns to the CUBBY HOLE. Ellie’s secret hiding place.
text: Louis comes over, kneeling down. He reaches out, taking hold
text: of the small curtain, hands shaking as he pulls it open --
text: The cubby is empty.
text: Louis deflates again. Is this real? Is he losing his mind?
text: As he sits back up we NOTICE --
text: ELLIE CROUCHED IN THE SHADOWS BEHIND HIM!!
dialog: 
text: Her head is lowered, looking out of the top of her eyes, body
text: caked with dried black mud, hair hanging in stringy clumps
text: RACK FOCUS to bring her into focus. Eyes glued to Louis.
text: Louis doesn’t see her. He’s too absorbed in disappointment
text: as she rises up to standing, coming closer, reaching out with
text: tiny mud caked fingers, hand coming to rest on his shoulder --
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Daddy.
text: Louis screams, spinning around. He slides backwards across
text: the floor, breathing rapidly, terrified. Staring at Ellie.
text: But she’s shivering. Her body cold. Terrified _and_ confused.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Where am I?
text: Louis’ terror melts away, his father instincts kicking in as
text: he goes to Ellie, wrapping his arms around her.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You’re home, baby.
text: CLOSE on Louis’ face, holding Ellie tight --
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Home.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - LATER
text: Ellie sits in the tub, knees sticking out of dark grey water
text: with pieces of SWAMP GRASS floating around her.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Tilt your head back.
text: She does. Louis gently pours water over her head, careful
text: not to get it in her eyes. She looks straight ahead.
text: Louis brushes out Ellie’s hair, pulling gently down through
text: heavy strands. Ellie winces as he gets caught on a tangle.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Ouch.
text: Louis notices clumps of hair in the brush. He pulls them out
text: and drops them in the wastebasket, going back to brushing.
text: Ellie winces again --
speaker_heading: ELLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Daddy.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Sorry. Mom usually does this.
text: He pulls the brush away from her head. There’s something
text: under the hair he keeps getting snagged on --
text: Louis uses his fingers to slide her hair aside to REVEAL --
text: MORTICIAN’S STAPLES holding the back of her scalp down.
text: Louis closes his eyes, turning away. He lets the hair fall
text: back over the wound. Ellie looks up in the mirror.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: What is it?
text: Louis swallows, pushing the horrific truth away.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
text: Just a tangle.
dialog: 70.
scene_heading: INT. ELLIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What is it, honey?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Church is gone. Isn’t he?
text: She watches his face, searching for the truth --
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (lying)
text: The truck in the road hit him.
text: Ellie sits up, eyes locked on Louis --
speaker_heading: ELLIE
text: No, it didn’t. The truck hit me.
text: Louis freezes. Ellie’s eyes clear and dark. Focused on him.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Church is dead, honey. I’m sorry.
text: Louis gets up to turn down the light. Behind him we HEAR --
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: (soft whisper)
dialog: So am I.
text: Louis spins around. Did he just hear that correctly?
text: Ellie looks up at him with huge, sorrowful eyes.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I sleep with you tonight? I’m
dialog: scared.
text: Louis swallows, blood going cold. He nods slowly --
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Of course, honey. Come on...

text: out of bed, reaching for Louis’ hand.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 71.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATER
text: Louis lies in bed, staring at the ceiling. Ellie lies facing

speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Where’s mommy and Gage?
text: Louis glances over at her --
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: They went to Grandma and grandpa’s
dialog: for a couple days.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: When are they coming back?
text: She watches his eyes. Searching his face for the truth.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: A couple more days...

speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Does mommy know what you did?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Shh, baby. It’s late. Time to
dialog: sleep.
text: Louis reaches over and clicks off the light. As he lies back
text: on his pillow, Ellie has moved closer. Inches from his face.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Love you, daddy.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (terrified)
dialog: Love you too, El.
text: Louis closes his eyes, praying for sleep to take him.
text: MOVE IN on Ellie’s face, lying in the darkness, eyes open.
text: Staring at Louis in the moonlight.
scene_heading: EXT. CREED HOUSE - MORNING
text: Gage’s tricycle sits in the driveway, grass slick with dew.
dialog: 72.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME
text: Louis wakes up in bed with a start. He rolls over but Ellie

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Ellie???
text: Then we hear something. Music on the stereo downstairs.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Louis comes down the stairs in disbelief. Ellie is there and
text: she’s doing what she loves most. She’s dancing.
text: Louis comes into the room, watching as she gets lost in the
text: graceful joy of the dance. Spins around. Alive and free.
text: It’s beautiful, sweet, tender, gentle. Tears flow down
text: Louis’ face but he’s not sad. His heart is full again.
text: Ellie sees him and smiles. Spinning faster and laughing.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Careful, sweetie...
text: Ellie lets out an excited yell as she twirls past Louis.
text: Now her movements are too fast. Aggressive and dangerous,
text: striking the wall, kicking over a chair.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Ellie, stop it! Stop!
text: But she can’t. She won’t. She’s out of control.
text: Louis tries to grab her but she bites his arm and ducks away.

scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Ellie bursts out of the house, laughing and breathing hard.
text: She pauses for a moment, feeling the sun on her face. It’s

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Ellie! Dammit! Get back inside.
text: Ellie’s face sharpens, her eyes convicting him --
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: No! I like it out here.

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Goddammit, Ellie... come back!!

scene_heading: EXT. BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS
text: Ellie swoops across the open lawn with her arms outstretched

speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Ellie.
text: Jud looks up at Louis. His secret exposed.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (sharp, to Ellie)
dialog: Get back inside.

speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Can’t I just stand right here?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: No. Inside. Now.

speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JUD

speaker_heading: JUD (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: She's gonna go bad. Just like

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What was I supposed to do? I just
dialog: wanted to tuck her into bed one
dialog: more time, kiss her goodnight...
text: Louis hands his head, ashamed.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Ellie’s not a cat, Louis. She’s
dialog: dangerous.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: She’s my daughter.
text: ELLIE'S POV: listening and watching as Jud speaks --
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Not anymore.

speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: BOO!!!
text: Ellie jumps out from behind the door, laughing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Jesus, El. Please don’t do that.
speaker_heading: ELLIE

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: Ellie sits on the couch, watching quietly as Louis begins
text: packing up the house into boxes.
text: We see his DOCTOR BAG sitting on the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Why are you packing up?
text: Louis stops packing for a moment, glancing over --
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: We're going back to Boston for a
dialog: little while.
text: Ellie watches him closely. Searching for the truth.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: All of us?
text: Louis looks her straight in the face --
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yes. All of us.

speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s mommy.
text: Ellie gets up, coming closer --
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Oh, can I talk to her?
dialog: 76.
text: Louis steps back, holding the phone away from Ellie --
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Not quite yet, okay? I don’t think

text: Ellie pouts, standing just behind Louis as he answers --
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Rachel, hi. How are you guys?
text: MOVE in on Ellie’s face listening as we --
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. BEAUTIFUL BOSTON HOME - DAY

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I was getting worried. You've
dialog: haven't been calling me back.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Been busy with the house.
text: Something is off in Louis’ voice.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Don’t keep things from me. If
dialog: you're having a hard time, I should
dialog: be there with you.
text: Louis glances at Ellie, lowering his voice --
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I just need some space right now.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: God, Louis. Why do you do this?
dialog: Gage misses you. I miss you.
text: Louis closes his eyes, tears streaming down his cheeks --
speaker_heading: LOUIS

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I’m bringing Gage back for the

speaker_heading: LOUIS

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Ellie in her pajamas sitting in front of a bowl of cereal.
text: Louis sits across from her, watching as she lifts the spoon
text: to her mouth. Food tastes strange to her now. Foreign.
text: She sets the spoon down, pushing the bowl away.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Not hungry.
text: Louis nods, taking the bowl to the sink. He pauses for a
text: moment, looking out at the trees.
dialog: Then he NOTICES --
text: Ellie standing behind him in the reflection.
dialog: 
dialog: Just like Church did that first night he came back.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: What did you and Jud talk about?
text: Louis turns, facing Ellie. She moves closer, watching him.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: He was just surprised to see you
dialog: back, is all...
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I can tell when you lie.
text: Louis looks over at her. What else does she know?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
text: It’s nothing. He’s just concerned.
text: Ellie moves closer, staring up at him. Louis can’t move back
text: any further, body pressing up against the sink.
text: Then Ellie holds out her hand with a creepy smile.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Can we go to bed now?
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Louis sleeps in the bed as wind rattles the windows.
dialog: PAN over to SEE --
text: Ellie watching him in the darkness. After a BEAT --
text: She quietly slips out of bed.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Ellie stands in front of her father’s medical bag on the
text: table. Her hand slips inside, feeling for something.
text: CLOSE as she pulls out his shining SCALPEL.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
text: Rain pours down through the trees, hitting the leaves in
text: heavy wet drops. We hear something moving in the woods as --
text: Jud steps into frame. His huge body in silhouette, watching
text: the Creed House through the trees.
text: Jud moves closer, moving a branch to get a better look --
text: A light is on in Ellie’s room. The window open, curtains
text: billowing in the wind. After a BEAT they settle, revealing --
text: Ellie standing in the window. Looking out at the woods. Her
text: eyes are closed, head tilted slightly back.
text: Jud moves closer, pulling a branch aside to see better.
text: The curtains billow again, blocking our view of Ellie. As
text: the wind settles she comes back into view and we SEE --
text: SHE’S LOOKING RIGHT AT US!
text: Jud pulls back into the trees, heart racing. Rain comes down
text: around him as he builds the courage to look again --
text: This time, Ellie is gone. The window is empty.
text: Jud turns back, heading for his house.
dialog: 79.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER
text: Ellie comes out the front door. Looking around. She steps
text: slowly down the stairs, walking out into --
scene_heading: EXT. BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS
text: Ellie crosses the grass. There’s something in her hand.
text: The moonlight hits the tiny SCALPEL, glinting in the light.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS
text: Ellie sneaks through the trees toward Jud’s house. She
text: pauses, seeing a light in the window. As she moves closer --
text: Jud_lunges out of the bushes, trying to grab her!
dialog: 
text: Ellie swings the knife, slicing Jud’s hand. He slips
text: backwards as she scampers away into the woods.
text: Jud pulls himself up, reaching for his light.
text: JUD’S POV of the dark woods. Ellie is nowhere to be found.
scene_heading: EXT. JUD'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Jud comes around the front of his house to SEE --
text: The front door is open.
text: He comes up the wooden steps, pausing at the threshold.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Ellie. Come on out of there.
text: FOLLOW as Jud walks slowly through the door into --
scene_heading: INT. JUD'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Jud stands in the dark room, eyes adjusting to the light. He

text: As he crosses to the kitchen we catch a GLIMPSE of --
text: Ellie passing across a doorway behind him.
dialog: 
text: Jud spins around, heart pounding.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Dammit, Ellie. Just come out.
text: Jud walks to a drawer, reaching in to pull out a REVOLVER.
text: He clicks it open to check the bullets. It’s full. He flips
text: the chamber closed, walking to the kitchen.
speaker_heading: JUD (CONT'D)
dialog: I just want to talk to you.
text: No answer from the house. He moves through a door into a
text: long, dark hallway leading to his bathroom and bedroom.
text: Jud stands in the hallway for a beat. His bedroom door is
text: open. He takes a few cautious steps, gun held out.
speaker_heading: JUD (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you’re scared. I’m scared,
dialog: too.
text: Jud moves down the hallway to the bathroom. He holds the gun
text: with one hand as he slowly turns the knob with the other --
text: Pushing the door open and sweeping the gun around.
dialog: 
text: The bathroom is empty. Just a toilet, empty bath, sink.
text: Jud backs up, continuing down the hallway to his bedroom.
text: He taps the door with his foot and it swings open slowly with
text: a horrible creak. He inches forward into the room --
text: The bedroom is empty. Moonlight filtering through curtains.
text: Jud moves around the bed to the closet. He opens it to SEE --
text: Nothing but old clothes hanging there. He peeks behind them.
text: He turns, walking past the bed as we DRIFT DOWN to reveal --
text: Ellie under the bed. Gleaming SCALPEL clutched in her hand.
dialog: 
text: She screams, swinging her hand out with the blade and --
text: Slicing Jud’s ACHILLES TENDON.
text: Jud screams, falling to the ground. He rolls over on his
text: side to see Ellie sliding backwards under the bed and aims --
text: BAM! BAM!! Jud fires two shots under the bed but Ellie is
text: gone. He moans, his leg bleeding badly as he tries to pull
text: himself up but his foot won’t support his weight.
dialog: 81.
text: Jud rolls onto his back, taking a breath --
speaker_heading: JUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on out, Ellie. Where are you?
text: He pushes himself up with one hand, craning his head to look
text: around the dark room. No sign of Ellie anywhere.
text: He rolls onto his knees, sitting up higher as we NOTICE --
text: Ellie crouched on the dresser behind him like a FERAL CAT.
dialog: 
text: Jud freezes, sensing Ellie’s presence --
text: CLOSE on his hand: silently cocking his revolver.
text: Ellie screams, leaping from the dresser into the air --
text: The knife flashing in the light as Jud spins and fires!
dialog: 
text: The bullet hits a photo on the wall, shattering the glass as
text: Ellie lands on Jud, knocking him to the ground and SLAMMING --
text: The scalpel into his chest.
text: Jud gasps, grabbing Ellie with his hands, holding her back --
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: (struggling)
dialog: I thought we were friends?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: I was friends with Ellie. Not you.
text: Ellie smiles at Jud. Her eyes have gone PURE BLACK.
dialog: Evil like that black swamp water.
speaker_heading: JUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Let your parents live. Ellie's
dialog: death was punishment enough...
text: Ellie reaches down, forcing the revolver in Jud’s hand to
text: point back under his chin.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: You don’t know what punishment is.
speaker_heading: HARD CUT TO:
dialog: 82.
scene_heading: EXT. JUD’'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
text: A muffled pop from inside the house as we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CREED HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER
text: Louis asleep in the bed. His bedroom door swings open to
text: reveal Ellie standing in the doorway. Just a silhouette.
text: Then she steps into the room and we see she’s returned to
text: normal. Her eyes are clear. Just an innocent little girl.
text: She walks to the edge of the bed, standing over Louis to
text: watch him sleep. He seems so defenseless. Vulnerable.
dialog: For a horrible BEAT we wonder what she’s about to do --
text: Then Louis wakes up. He sits, startled to see Ellie there.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: El, you okay?
text: She drops her eyes, pouting a little.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I had a nightmare.
text: Louis pulls the covers back. Ellie slides into the bed.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: You're okay. Just a dream..
text: As Louis falls asleep we TRACK in on Ellie lying in his arms,
text: staring out the window at the rain falling outside.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAWN
text: The storm has passed. Water drips through heavy leaves.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME
text: Louis wakes up to the sound of tires rolling over gravel.
text: He slides out of bed, walking to the window to SEE --
text: Rachel pulling up the driveway in her father’s car.
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
text: Ellie sits up behind him in the bed. She smiles.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
text: Mommy’s home.
text: Louis comes to Ellie, pleading with his eyes. He knows that
dialog: she’s the one in control.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Maybe you can give her a little
dialog: time to get adjusted before. .?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Don’t you think she’1ll be happy to
dialog: see me?
text: Something in Louis melts. He still sees her as his daughter.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Of course, honey. It’s just, it’s
dialog: going to take some time.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Maybe I should hide? Like a game?
text: Louis gets the chills. This doesn’t feel like a game to him.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Okay, great. I’11 go talk to her.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Louis comes slowly down the stairs as we HEAR --
text: Footsteps on the porch. The front door opens and Gage bursts
text: inside, running up to his father.
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: Daddy, daddy, daddy!!!
text: Louis scoops Gage into his arms, hugging his son.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I missed you so much. Wait a
dialog: second, did you get bigger?
text: Gage squeals with laughter as his dad lifts him up and down.
text: Then Louis notices Rachel in the doorway. He sets Gage down.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Hi.
text: They come together, hugging. This is the first time in days
text: that Louis has felt fully alive. He doesn’t want to let go.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Oh, babe. I missed you.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I missed you, too.
text: Rachel walks into the house. She pauses, looking around.
dialog: Nothing has been packed.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What happened? I thought you’d
dialog: been packing this whole time?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: It was hard, Rach...
text: Rach moves around seeing Ellie’s sneakers by the wall, her
text: scooter by the door, her sweatshirt on a chair.
text: She shakes her head, looking back at Louis --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What are you doing? This is all
dialog: Ellie’s stuff.
text: Gage walks to the stairs as a SHADOW appears on the wall.
text: But Rachel is absorbed with Louis, deeply concerned --
speaker_heading: RACHEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you doing this on purpose?
dialog: Trying to punish yourself?
text: ON THE STAIRS Ellie moves into view. She puts her finger to
text: her lips indicating for Gage to be quiet.
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: Mommy !
text: Rachel doesn’t respond. She’s staring at Louis. Furious.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Rach, it’s not like that --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: This is why I wanted to leave. How
dialog: do we explain this to Gage?
dialog: 85.
text: Gage is tugging on his mother’s shirt now, pointing at
text: something. Rachel looks down at him --
speaker_heading: RACHEL (CONT'D)
dialog: What is it, honey?
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: Ellie. Ellie. Ellie-phant!
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Don’t call me that.
text: Rachel looks over in shock as Ellie steps closer.
dialog: 
text: Rachel screams, pushing herself backwards along the floor
text: until she hits the wall. She’s going into shock.
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: See, mommy? Ellie!
text: Rachel gasps, trying to form words. She looks to Louis --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: How this is happening..?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: That place behind the Pet Cemetery
dialog: where Jud and I buried Church...
dialog: it’s a special place, Rach. It has
dialog: power.
text: Rachel glances at Ellie in horror, then back to Louis --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I don't... this can’t be real...
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: It’s real. It worked with Church,
dialog: too. It brings things back.
text: Ellie stands in front of Rachel now. Looking down at her
text: mother, majestic and powerful. Somehow alive and dead.
text: Rachel looks at Louis, fear turning to dread --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You moved her body? You took her
dialog: into the woods?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Of course, I did. How could I not,
dialog: knowing it would bring her back?
dialog: 86.
text: Ellie reaches out for her mother. A moan slips out of
text: Rachel’s mouth as Ellie’s hand traces across her cheek.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Aren’t you happy, mom? I missed
dialog: you.
text: Rachel turns to her dead daughter, voice trembling --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I missed you, too.
text: Rachel stiffens as Ellie moves in to hug her. It’s horrible
text: and awkward. But it’s also her daughter so something melts.
text: Gage comes over, trying to soothe his mother, hugging both
text: Rachel and Ellie. This makes Rachel cry and hug them both.
text: Finally, Louis kneels down, wrapping his arms around them.
text: The family reunited.
text: As the family hug continues we come around to Ellie’s face
text: looking over her mother’s shoulder to the dark woods outside.
text: Ellie smiles. Her eyes pure black.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - LATER
text: Rachel sits on the lid of the toilet, eyes red from crying.
text: We hear Louis knock softly, his voice through the door.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Rachel? Can I come in?
text: The door opens and Louis slips inside, looking down at her.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (terrified)
dialog: I don’t understand. What is going
dialog: on?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
text: It doesn’t matter. She’s back.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It matters to me. You can’t just
dialog: say there’s some place in the
dialog: woods. That’s not good enough! !
dialog: 87.
text: Louis glances into the hallway, pulling the door closed --
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Shhh, okay. Keep your voice down.
text: Louis sits on the edge of the bathtub, taking a deep breath.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s been like this for hundreds of
dialog: years. That place has power.
text: As he continues to explain we CUT OUTSIDE THE DOOR --
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME TIME
text: To find Ellie standing in the shadows, listening to her

text: After a BEAT, she backs away, turning down the stairs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Gage eats a cookie as Ellie approaches him from behind.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Want to play a game, Gage?
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Turn around.
text: Gage turns around, obeying his sister. She takes a cloth
text: napkin and ties it over his eyes like a bandana.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn’t like being gone. I like
dialog: being with you and mom and dad.
text: Gage holds out his hands nervously, trying to balance --
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: I can’t see.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: That’s how the game works. It’s
dialog: called Marco Polo. Every time you
dialog: say Marco, I say Polo and then you
dialog: try to find me. Understand?
dialog: 88.
text: Gage nods as she steps back. He turns, feeling for her.
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: Marco.
text: Ellie steps back as Gage takes a step forward.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Polo.
text: GAGE’'S POV from behind the blindfold: we can only see a tiny
text: slice of the room at the top and bottom of the frame.
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: Marco.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: (further away)
dialog: Polo.
text: Gage moves into the room, feeling with his hands as we --
scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Rachel has stopped crying now, leaning close to Louis --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You were supposed to be the strong
dialog: one. A medical doctor. You see
dialog: death all the time...
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: It was different with Ellie.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: She's changed, Louis. Her skin. I
dialog: want to remember her like before.
text: Louis sighs closing his eyes. He knows she’s right.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Not just that. Remember what
dialog: happened with Church. We need to
dialog: think about Gage. He needs you.
dialog: This makes Rachel think of something --
scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
dialog: 89.
scene_heading: INT. CREED HOUSE - SAME TIME
text: Ellie slides backwards around the dining room table as her
text: brother comes into the room, his hands out, feeling his way.
text: She has her father’s scalpel in her hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: Marco.
text: Ellie jumps out of the way, dropping the scalpel on the
text: ground. Gage turns, hearing the noise.
text: Gage turns around, waving his hands.
speaker_heading: GAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Marco?
text: GAGE’S POV inside the blindfold: we see Ellie reaching for
text: something on the ground. She doesn’t answer Gage’s call.
speaker_heading: GAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Marco. Marco?
text: An excruciating BEAT inside the blindfold. Then, finally --
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Polo.
text: Ellie is right in front of him. Gage pulls his blindfold up.
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: Got you!
text: Ellie smiles at him. Her hand hidden behind her back.
text: Then her eyes move to something else --
text: Rachel coming down the stairs. She walks quickly over to
text: Gage, gently pulling him back from Ellie.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Let’s play outside. Get some air.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - LATER
text: Ellie plays with Gage on the lawn, chasing and giggling as
text: they roll around in the grass. BEHIND THEM --
text: Rachel watches from the porch. Her face is blank. Numb.
dialog: 90.
text: Louis comes out, sitting next to her. After a BEAT --
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: We'll do it tonight. After dinner.
text: She glances over at him, a glimmer of hope in her eyes.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: It was wrong... I’m so sorry...
text: His eyes tear up. Rachel pulls him close, hugging him.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Shhh, okay... it’s gonna be okay.
text: Ellie turns away from Gage on the lawn. Listening to them.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispering)

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - SUNSET

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: That’s it, Gage. One fork for

text: Ellie enters with a bowl of spaghetti and red sauce.
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: Bas-getti!
text: Gage tries to reach into the bowl, Ellie lifts it away --
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Careful, Gage... it’s hot...
text: Everyone takes their seats.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Should we do our thankful fors?
text: Louis nods at Ellie as they all hold hands.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I’m thankful mommy and Gage came
dialog: home.
dialog: 91.
text: She smiles at Rachel.
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: I’m thankful for bas-getti!
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I’m thankful we’re all together.
text: They all look at Rachel. She’s barely able to speak.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I’m thankful... for Ellie...
text: Rachel quickly looks down, not able to continue. Louis
text: breaks the tension by serving up food onto everyone’s plate.
text: Ellie just watches Rachel. Studying her.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: You're lying.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No, I am thankful. I love you.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: (to Louis)
dialog: You didn’t tell her I was back
dialog: because you knew she wouldn’t let
dialog: me stay. She wants me dead again.
text: UNDER THE TABLE we see Ellie holding the scalpel in her hand.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Rachel)
dialog: I know you’re planning on killing
dialog: me. I can see it in your face.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Ellie... stop... please...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: We're your parents. We will always
dialog: love you. No matter what --
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: That’s another lie!
text: The house rumbles as if an earthquake were starting. A

text: CLOSE on Ellie’s face, glaring at her mother --
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (cold)
dialog: You chose Gage over me.
text: Rachel doesn’t answer. She can’t. Her ability to speak
text: arrested by the realization they are now suddenly outside.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
text: Somehow the family is sitting around the dining room table --
text: IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD WHERE ELLIE WAS HIT BY THE TRUCK.
dialog: 
text: Rachel looks at Louis, terror rising in her throat.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: She's doing this...
text: Louis looks around. Wind blowing through the trees. Asphalt
text: under his feet. Lane markers stretching out behind them.
text: Gage giggles, banging on his plate --
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: I like trees!
text: Ellie stands, scalpel by her side as she walks toward Rachel.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: The day of Gage’s party. You saw
text: him in the road and made a choice.
text: Rachel keeps her eyes on Ellie but we notice something else --
text: Bright HEADLIGHTS approaching behind her.
dialog: 
text: We hear the sound of a truck downshifting. The grinding of
text: gears. The bellowing of exhaust. But --
text: Rachel keeps her eyes on Ellie, shaking her head --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I didn’t choose... I didn’t have
dialog: time... I just saw Gage there...
text: Louis looks behind Rachel into the oncoming headlights.
text: LOUIS’ POV of the TRUCK barrelling right at them.
dialog: 
text: When he looks back at Ellie he sees blackness swirling in her
text: eyes. For the first time Louis clearly sees her as something
text: other than his daughter. A monster. Hungry and evil.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Stop...
text: The headlights swallow them up as Ellie stands in front of
text: Rachel, hair blowing in the wind, streaks of swamp water
text: leaking out of her black eyes and down her face. She smiles.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: How does it feel knowing you’re
dialog: about to die?
text: The scalpel in her hand glints as she moves her arm but --
text: Louis lunges from behind, pulling Ellie down to the table.
text: WIDE on the family in the road: table cloth billowing in the
text: wind, Louis holding Ellie down by her shoulders.
text: The truck approaching from the side at 70 miles per hour.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE on Louis’ face --
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Stop it, El.... STOP IT!!!
