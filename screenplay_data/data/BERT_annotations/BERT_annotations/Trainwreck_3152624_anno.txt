dialog: them.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Girls, your mother and I are
dialog: getting divorced. Don’t cry. I know
dialog: you're upset. I know you’re
dialog: confused. I don’t know what you’re
dialog: mother told you, but let me explain
dialog: it from my side in terms you can
dialog: understand. You got your doll,
dialog: right? You got your doll there.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: You like your doll, right? You love
dialog: your doll.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: You love the doll. But what if I
dialog: told you that was the only doll you
dialog: were allowed to play with the rest
dialog: of your life? How would you feel?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Sad.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: You'd feel sad of course because
dialog: there’s a lot of other dolls on
dialog: your shelf. And if you play with
dialog: the other dolls you can’t have that
dialog: doll anymore. Even though that doll
dialog: doesn’t really want to play with
dialog: you at this point. You're both
dialog: living a lie. There’s other dolls
dialog: you like and they’re making new
dialog: dolls every year. You want a
dialog: stewardess doll?
speaker_heading: AMY & KIM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: What about a slightly overweight
dialog: cocktail waitress doll?
speaker_heading: AMY & KIM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: What about a doll who happens to be
dialog: best friends with your main doll?
speaker_heading: AMY & KIM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: It could happen, right?
speaker_heading: AMY & KIM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: What about a doll you only play
dialog: with one day and never see again?
speaker_heading: AMY & KIM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: What about if your friend’s playing
dialog: with a doll and needs you to kind
dialog: of man up with the other doll? You
dialog: don’t even want to play with that
dialog: doll, but you do it because your
dialog: friend’s playing with that doll and
dialog: you don’t want to sit there and
text: leave the other doll unattended.
speaker_heading: AMY & KIM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: So that’s why me and Mom are
dialog: getting divorced. Monogamy isn’t
dialog: realistic.
speaker_heading: AMY AND KIM
dialog: (chanting)
dialog: Monogamy isn’t realistic.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Again.
speaker_heading: AMY & KIM
dialog: Monogamy isn’t realistic.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Again.

speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You would get totally cut up.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Yeah, but he’d feel so bad about

speaker_heading: DIANNA

speaker_heading: DIANNA

speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: Thank you, it’s a big opportunity.
speaker_heading: DIANNA
dialog: Right, pitch me. Pitch me hard.
dialog: Schultz?
speaker_heading: SCHULTZ
dialog: I was thinking something called the

dialog: How not to get caught?
speaker_heading: DIANNA
dialog: How to get caught?
speaker_heading: SCHULTZ
dialog: Makes it more fun. Already started
dialog: the research.
speaker_heading: DIANNA
dialog: Bryson?
speaker_heading: BRYSON
dialog: I got one. You’re Not Gay, She’s
dialog: Boring.
speaker_heading: DIANNA
dialog: Fantastic. I can see it.
speaker_heading: BRYSON

speaker_heading: BRYSON

speaker_heading: AMY

dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: SCHULTZ

speaker_heading: DIANNA
dialog: Right, assignments. Schultz. You're
text: covering the Ryan Phillippe piece.
speaker_heading: SCHULTZ
dialog: Yes! “Crash” was epic.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I was thinking I would take a stab
text: at the Phillippe piece.
speaker_heading: DIANNA
dialog: No, Ryan is in a major funk right
dialog: now. He’‘ll respond much better to a
text: male figure who isn’t attractive or
dialog: masculine.
speaker_heading: SCHULTZ
dialog: Blam! That's me right here.
speaker_heading: DIANNA
dialog: Bryson, I’ve got a red mark by your

speaker_heading: BRYSON
dialog: I am pitching Dr. Aaron Conners. He
dialog: works with some of the Knicks. He’s
dialog: this incredible, young sports

dialog: Amar’e Stoudemire. It’ll be the

speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: I've heard of that guy. He fixed

speaker_heading: SCHULTZ
dialog: Yeah and Metta World Peace’s. Thabo

speaker_heading: AMY

dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: DIANNA
dialog: What’s that Amy, I want your
dialog: thoughts.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm sorry, I just don’t know why we
dialog: treat these athletes like heroes
dialog: just cause they can skate fast or
dialog: kick a ball into a net. I just
dialog: think it’s weird. No offense, but I
dialog: just think that sports are stupid
dialog: and anyone who likes them is just a
dialog: lesser person. And has a small
dialog: intellect.
speaker_heading: DIANNA
dialog: Killer. I want you to write the
dialog: piece.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BRYSON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh no. I literally can’t stomach

speaker_heading: DIANNA
dialog: I know. Your opposition is

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I think this feels like a Bryson
dialog: article.
speaker_heading: BRYSON
dialog: This feels like a me article. I
dialog: pitched it.
speaker_heading: DIANNA
dialog: Yeah, you pitched it. I’m giving it
dialog: to Amy. What’re you saying? Are you
dialog: giving me attitude here? This isn’t
dialog: a fucking medical journal.
speaker_heading: BRYSON
dialog: I can do opposition. I can do sexy.
speaker_heading: DIANNA
dialog: I want that. I want that hatred.
dialog: I'm giving it to Amy. Don’t sulk at

speaker_heading: BRYSON
dialog: I’m not sulking.
speaker_heading: DIANNA
dialog: This is my decision. I’m giving it

speaker_heading: BRYSON

speaker_heading: DIANNA
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: BRYSON
dialog: Nothing, I’m fine. I’m having fun.

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Yeah. Talk about the first time you

speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: AMY

dialog: welcome me back. But they did. They
dialog: welcomed me with open arms and an
text: open heart.
speaker_heading: AARON

dialog: Cleveland. But I appreciate the
dialog: thought.
speaker_heading: LEBRON JAMES

dialog: Roll Hall of Fame? Or maybe we go
dialog: down to Canton to the Pro Football

speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: LEBRON JAMES
dialog: What’s wrong with that? I’ve got
dialog: free texting.
speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: LEBRON JAMES
dialog: When are you gonna come to
dialog: Cleveland?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I’1l come when I have time. I don’t

dialog: Why do I have to pick up the check?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Because you’re Lebron James.
speaker_heading: LEBRON JAMES
dialog: Don’t look at me different just
dialog: cause I got a little money. I don’t
dialog: how long this could last. Anything
dialog: could happen. I’m not gonna end up
dialog: like MC Hammer. You owe thirty two
dialog: dollars and forty three cents.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I'll pay for it. But you’ve got to
dialog: pick up a check every once ina
dialog: while.
speaker_heading: LEBRON JAMES

speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Ok.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: So off the record, do you want to

speaker_heading: WENDY

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)
dialog: So a couple days later, I started
dialog: wondering where the condom was and
dialog: I looked online and found out that
dialog: a lot of times they get trapped
dialog: inside, like up by your cervix. It
dialog: said if that happens you need to
dialog: get it out. It says just “bear
text: down” (Air quotes) and fish it out.
dialog: So I sat on the toilet and sure

dialog: a drunk. He once apologized to me
dialog: for missing my volleyball game.
text: That he was at. He had made signs
dialog: with my name on them. When I was 11
dialog: this kid Brandon Lipinsky stole my
text: bike. Maybe he was just borrowing
dialog: it. But our dad went to his house
text: and beat up his dad, and his

dialog: personally offended everyone here.
dialog: Raise your hand if our dad ever
dialog: offended you.
text: Most people raise their hands.
speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, he was an asshole. When I
dialog: asked him to tell me the story of
dialog: how he proposed to our mom, his
dialog: response was, who? I know he was
dialog: joking. He loved her a lot. He was
dialog: really sick for a really long time,
dialog: which isn’t fair because I don’t
dialog: think anyone else was more alive
dialog: than him when he was younger. He
dialog: thought it was payback. He thought
dialog: it was karma and that’s why he got
dialog: sick. But I don’t think so. I think
dialog: he was the greatest Dad. He always
dialog: made me feel loved and important. I
dialog: know he fucked up.
speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: KIM

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: It was because of all this shit

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: You know the thing about
