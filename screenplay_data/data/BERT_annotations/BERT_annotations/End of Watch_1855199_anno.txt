text: This gritty, suspenseful drama follows Los Angeles Police Officers Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and
text: Zavala (Michael Pefia) as they face off against crack addicts, human traffickers and Mexican drug
text: cartels in the daily battle for control of the city’s meanest streets. Giving the story a gripping, first-
text: person immediacy, the action unfolds entirely through footage from the ubiquitous handheld HD
text: video cameras now commonly used by those on both sides of the law. After each grueling shift, the
text: partners and best friends return home to their families as husbands and fathers, leaving the
text: brutality of their jobs behind and making light of the courage it takes to go out into the streets every
text: day. Despite moments of self-doubt, they prove so effective as a law enforcement team that they
text: quickly become the targets of Sinaloan drug lords. When word gets out that the top bosses want
text: Taylor and Zavala “taken care of,’ the partners swear they’ve got each other covered, not realizing
text: their friendship is about to be tested to its limits. A powerful story of family, friendship, love, honor
text: and courage, END OF WATCH uses cutting edge technology to create a riveting portrait of the city’s
dialog: darkest, most violent corners, the cops who risk their lives there every day, and the price they and
text: their families are forced to pay.

scene_heading: “END OF WATCH” DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT
scene_heading: IMPORTANT PLEASE READ
dialog: 
dialog: To the reader from the writer and director:
dialog: 1 would like to help you understand my vision for “End of Watch.” In the simplest terms, this is a
text: film about two best friends who happen to be policemen. We follow their lives over a period of
text: several months as they fall in love, have children, get married and otherwise live their lives. The
text: film also has a strong crime story and plenty of action of great scope. It is a film that will have
text: something for everyone and touch upon universal themes of friendship, love, honor and courage.
dialog: These are real people leading real lives.
dialog: Today’s young people create and consume video media in very different ways. They film their daily
text: lives and share these videos through social media. It is this novel use of video and the intimacy of
dialog: reality that I wish to emulate. This film will be shot in many of the same ways that young people
dialog: create media today. My concept is simple: The characters themselves are placing and operating the
text: cameras. This creates a very visceral reality, much like watching real dramatic action on the
dialog: Internet. One could term this method “French New Wave Cinema meets You Tube.”
dialog: Often “found footage” films are difficult to watch due to excessive camera movement. Please keep
text: in mind that these will not be shaky, unsteady “Cloverfield” type images. “End of Watch” will be shot
text: in anormal theatrical resolution using many standard production techniques. Image quality will be
text: high, the colors will be vibrant and beautiful. The shots will be incredibly lyrical and smooth.
text: Although the actors will be wearing cameras, the images produced will be much like typical
text: Steadicam shots, with the same grace and beauty, although from angles before unachievable.
dialog: 1 am working with camera manufacturers to develop new cameras that will capture the images of
text: theatrical level quality yet be very small and compact. The extremely small, yet full resolution
text: cameras will be able to record the drama and action in ways that have not been possible before. In
dialog: success these new cameras will be nothing short of revolutionary. I believe the techniques used
dialog: will be groundbreaking unto themselves and will become an important talking point in the release
dialog: of the film. Of course there will also be standard camera coverage; my intent is to use all tools
dialog: available to tell this wonderful story. This film will be beautiful, clearly shot and will immerse the
text: viewer in it’s world in an intimate way.
text: “End of Watch” will deliver an exciting and fresh viewing experience for audiences of all
text: backgrounds. There will be nuanced and powerful performances by some of the best actors
dialog: working today. The audience will see police as they have never seen them, the journey will be
text: vibrant, fun and exciting. It will have the entertainment value of a “popcorn movie” yet deliver the
dialog: depth and sophistication of a powerful drama. I hope you enjoy the script and come on this
dialog: filmmaking journey with me.
dialog: Kind regards,
dialog: David Ayer
