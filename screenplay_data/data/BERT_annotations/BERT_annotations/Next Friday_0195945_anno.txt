scene_heading: BACK ON COUCH

text: Uncle Elroy and Suga making love.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ELROY (O.S.)

speaker_heading: SUGA

text: out the door.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: ...and if you come back, it's gonna be
dialog: worse.
text: Roach can't believe what just happened.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Did you see that? That was a W.W.F. hit
dialog: right there, huh, Day-Day?
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Yeah, it was. How you get up here?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I walked.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: You walked?
speaker_heading: CRAIG

text: He gives it to Day-Day.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Craig, this Roach. Roach, this is my
dialog: cousin, Craig.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: What up, bro?
text: Craig nods his head.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I tried to wake up Uncle Elroy but he
dialog: thought I was Suga.
text: Day-Day reads the notice.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: You know what this is?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: What it say?
text: Day-Day ignores Roach.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: How can they do this?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I don't know. Did ya'll forget to pay it
dialog: or something?
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: What it say?
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Ever since my momma died the bills are
dialog: always late.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: See how much it is?
text: Day-Day opens it. A PHONE starts to RING.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Don't worry about it, man. Get the
dialog: phone.
text: Roach skateboards over to the phone.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Pinky's.
text: Day-Day reads on.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Damn...how much money ya'll got left from
dialog: the lottery?
text: Day-Day goes for his bank book. He flips a few pages.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: $247.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Okay, plan B.
text: Day-Day is overwhelmed. Roach skates back over.
speaker_heading: ROACH
text: That was a girl on a cell phone. She
text: said she's outside in the parking lot
dialog: waiting for you to take her to lunch.
text: Day-Day looks at Craig. He runs over to the door.
text: OUTSIDE IN THE PARKING LOT
text: D'Wana sits in her car with her play sister BABY'D (her name
dialog: does not fit her body).
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Oh my God. That's D'Wana. And she got
dialog: Baby'D with her.
text: Day-Day locks the door and runs into the back. Craig and
dialog: Roach follow.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: That the big one, huh?
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: You damn right that's the big one.
text: The PHONE starts to RING again. D'Wana and Baby'D are at the
text: door. D'Wana is on her phone. Baby'D starts to knock.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY (cont'd)
dialog: Craig, go out there and tell 'em I'm
dialog: gone.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I ain't trying to get in it.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: You already in.
text: The knocking gets louder.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: No I'm not.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: I'll do it.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: No. You can't handle a girl like D'Wana.
dialog: It's got to be Craig.
speaker_heading: AT FRONT DOOR
text: They observe the "Yes We're Open" sign.
speaker_heading: D'WANA
dialog: That white boy said he was in there.
speaker_heading: BABY'D
dialog: Day-Day, don't make me break this window!
text: Craig is peeking out. He hesitates.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Watch out for Baby'D.
text: Craig walks out the back. He steps over the door. Unlocks
text: it, and cracks it open.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Day-Day ain't here.
dialog: They don't believe him.
speaker_heading: D'WANA
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I'm his cousin.
speaker_heading: BABY'D
dialog: You suppose to work here now or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah, I work here now.
speaker_heading: D'WANA
dialog: We didn't come here for Day-Day.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yes you did.
speaker_heading: D'WANA
dialog: No we didn't. We came to buy a CD.
speaker_heading: BABY'D
dialog: Now move.
text: Baby'D kicks the door. Craig has no choice but to let 'em
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: D'WANA
dialog: Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I don't know... I think he went out the
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: D'WANA
dialog: Can I look for myself?
text: Suddenly Roach is pushed into the front area.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Hey, ladies.
speaker_heading: D'WANA
dialog: Where's Day-Day?
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: I don't know, he must've left.
text: D'Wana looks at Baby'D.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I thought ya'll wanted to buy a CD?
speaker_heading: BABY'D
dialog: I do... can you help me find the jazz
dialog: section?
text: Craig looks at Roach for directions. He nods over towards
text: the front of the store.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Right this way. You know damn well you
dialog: don't listen to no jazz.
text: Baby'D checks out Craig as he leads the way. D'Wana looks
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: D'WANA
dialog: If Day-Day comes back, tell him I came by
dialog: and need to see him. Lamaze classes are
dialog: Wednesday.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Will do.
text: D'Wana starts to walk towards Craig and Baby'D.
speaker_heading: D'WANA
dialog: Come on, 'D, let's go.
text: But first she doubles back towards the storage room.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Where you going?
speaker_heading: D'WANA
dialog: Ain't the rest room this way? I gotta
dialog: pee.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: D'WANA
dialog: Thank you.
text: As she's walking in the back, Roach realizes his mistake.
scene_heading: BACK STORAGE AREA
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Shit.
text: Day-Day makes a run for it. She spots him ducking out the
text: back door.
speaker_heading: D'WANA
dialog: He's in there!
speaker_heading: INSIDE STORE
text: Baby'D knocks Craig out of the way.
speaker_heading: BABY'D
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: D'WANA
text: He ran out the door.
text: Baby'D gives chase with D'Wana, Craig and Roach close behind.
scene_heading: EXT. PINKY'S RECORDS AND DISC - CONTINUOUS
text: Day-Day runs around the side of Pinky's Records store. He
text: stops to see if anyone is coming. It's Baby'D with the three
text: others trailing. Baby'D is chasing Day-Day all through the
text: parking lot. Craig, D'Wana and Roach stop to watch.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Haul ass, dude. Don't stop.
dialog: ...and he is.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: You better stop running from that girl.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Fuuuuuuck -- U!
text: He runs back towards his BMW. The chase continues around his
text: car. Baby'D is starting to tire.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY (cont'd)
dialog: I'mma shoot yo' big ass.
text: D'Wana watches from a distance. Craig and Roach are close.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: (smiling)
text: She moves well for a big girl.
text: Just then, out of nowhere, Karla appears behind them carrying
text: a couple of bags. She taps Craig on his shoulder. He turns
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Hello, remember me?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Hell yeah, I remember you.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: I'm sorry for what my brother did this
dialog: morning. They're assholes.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: It's cool. You ain't got to apologize
dialog: for your brothers. They're big boys.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: I just wanted to give you this.
text: She hands him a card with her number on it.
speaker_heading: KARLA (cont'd)
dialog: If my brothers wasn't so over-protective,
dialog: I'd have you call the house. But for now
dialog: just page me when you get a chance.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Most definitely.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Better sooner than later.
text: She picks up her shopping bags and walks away. Over at the
text: chase: Baby'D is winded. She bends over trying to catch her
dialog: breath.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Baby'D, you're not going to catch me as
dialog: usual. So what can we do to end it this
dialog: time? What you want? Another Big Pun
dialog: CD? 'Cause I gotta get back to work.
text: Baby'D looks over at Craig.
speaker_heading: BABY'D
dialog: Okay, I know what I want this time.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Anything you need.
speaker_heading: BABY'D
dialog: Yo' cousin, Craig. Hook us up.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: That's it?
speaker_heading: BABY'D
dialog: Just tell him to come over here and talk
dialog: to me.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: And I can go free?
speaker_heading: BABY'D
dialog: Go, fo' I change my mind.
text: Day-Day carefully walks back over towards the store. D'Wana
text: pouts and walks towards Baby'D. (If looks could kill.)
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Great moves, Day-Day.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What happen?
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: We worked out a deal. All you gotta do
dialog: is go over there and talk to Baby'D.
text: Craig looks over at Baby'D. She's waiting.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What you mean talk to her?
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: (still smiling)
dialog: You know what he mean, dude.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I'm gone.
text: Craig turns and sprints into the store. Baby'D looks
text: concerned. Day-Day grabs Roach and they run into the store.
speaker_heading: BABY'D
dialog: I'mma get you, Day-Day! You gotta come
dialog: out sometimes!
text: D'Wana hands her a brick.
speaker_heading: D'WANA
dialog: I told you.
text: Baby'D screams and throws the brick through Day-Day's
scene_heading: WINDSHIELD.
scene_heading: INT. PINKY'S RECORDS AND DISC - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: (looking out window)
dialog: You don't wanna know.
text: Day-Day is devastated.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Thanks a lot, Craig.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I know we cousins and all, but don't try
dialog: an' hook me up with the big little
dialog: sisters.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Big bitches need love, too, Craig.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: For sure. That's how I like 'em.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Not me.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Are they still out there?
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Negative...they vamped.
text: Day-Day starts to walk into the back storage area.
speaker_heading: ROACH (cont'd)
dialog: Shouldn't we straighten up out here
dialog: before Pinky gets back?
text: Day-Day is like a zombie now. He doesn't answer, just keeps
dialog: walking.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Day-Day?
text: No answer. Craig looks at Roach. They follow.
scene_heading: BACK STORAGE AREA
text: Day-Day sits with the notice in hand.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Today ain't my day.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Bummer, huh? And Friday is suppose to be
dialog: a kick-ass day.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah it is...the best day before the
dialog: weekend.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
dialog: Day-Day is still sad.
speaker_heading: ROACH (cont'd)
dialog: I know how you feeling. And if I had my
dialog: bong right now, I'd let you 'toke 'til
dialog: you choke.' Dude, right here. All out.
dialog: No lungs. All I got is this.
text: Roach pulls out a big, smashed brownie with green shit in it.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What's the green stuff poking out?
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: That's cron-don, sir. My mom hates for
dialog: me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies.
dialog: Wanna bite?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Naw, I already ate.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Come on, Day, try it. For moms.
text: Day-Day shakes his head. Craig reaches into his fifth
dialog: pocket.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: It ain't a bong but, wa-la!
dialog: He has the joint from this morning.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Wo!
text: Roach snatches it.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Hey.
text: Craig snatches it back.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Sorry, bro, reflexes. How did you do
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Black magic.
text: Day-Day snatches the joint and puts it in his mouth.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Give me dat. I'm the one with the
dialog: problem.
text: Roach pulls out a mini-skateboard that's actually a lighter.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Weed doesn't solve problems. It eases
dialog: the mind, and the soul. Enjoy.
text: He lights the joint. Day-Day takes a hit.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: (letting out the smoke)
dialog: I don't.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: (taking the joint)
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint. I
dialog: didn't even pass it.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: (hitting it good)
dialog: Sorry, dude.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: You better open up a window or something
text: before the smell gets out.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Ain't no windows in here.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: I got an idea.
text: He hands the joint to Craig. Gets up and closes the door.
text: Then he grabs the vacuum out of the corner.
speaker_heading: ROACH (cont'd)
dialog: This is a little theory of mine... it
dialog: should work.
text: He plugs in the VACUUM and TURNS it ON. He puts the nozzle
text: in Day-Day's face.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Blow.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: That ain't gonna work.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Fuck yeah.
text: Day-Day hits the 'J and blows into the nozzle. It quickly
text: sucks up the smoke.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: (passing the 'J)
dialog: It works.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Still gonna smell it.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: No way. Watch this.
text: Roach hits the joint harder than anyone else. Smoke starts
text: to come out of his ears. Craig and Day-Day get a kick out of
dialog: that.
scene_heading: EXT. PINKY'S RECORDS AND DISC - CONTINUOUS
text: A pink limo pulls to a stop. The chauffeur gets out wearing
text: his suit just a little too tight. He opens the door and a
text: pair of pink boots hit the pavement. The CAMERA PANS UP TO
text: PINKY (35), the asshole owner.
speaker_heading: PINKY
dialog: Look, man, you hittin' them goddamn
dialog: corners too fast. Slow down. I almost
dialog: spilled my Hennessy on this 300 dollar
dialog: suit.
text: He walks over to the door. He thinks it's open. It's not.
speaker_heading: PINKY (cont'd)
dialog: I be damn.
text: He shakes the door. It's locked. He looks inside. No one's
text: at the counter. Cassettes all over the floor. Pinky looks
text: around making sure no one sneaks up on him. He reaches under
text: his shirt and pulls out a Glock 9mm. Sticks his key in the
text: door and steps in.
scene_heading: BACK STORE AREA - CLOSE UP - ROACH
text: is upside down. All the blood has rushed to his head. He
text: has Chinaman eyes and a big smile on his face.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Roach, what are you doing?
speaker_heading: ROACH
text: R-U-S-H Intensely.
text: A big cloud of smoke rolls out of his mouth and he falls and
text: hits the deck.
speaker_heading: ROACH (cont'd)
dialog: My spleen.
text: Craig and Day-Day laugh at Roach. The VACUUM is still GOING
text: but the room is very smoky. Craig jumps in.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: (unplugging the vacuum)
dialog: This vacuum don't work. Where's the
dialog: restroom?
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
text: Out the door and to the left.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: I thought the vacuum would work.
speaker_heading: IN HALLWAY
text: Craig makes a left and grabs the knob. He feels something
text: pressing on the back of his head (gun).
speaker_heading: PINKY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Don't move or I'll blow your head smooth
dialog: off.
text: Craig throws his hands up.
speaker_heading: PINKY (cont'd)
dialog: Now back up slowly... and don't say a
dialog: word.
text: He obeys. Pinky backs Craig into the store.
speaker_heading: PINKY (cont'd)
dialog: Get on the floor.
text: Craig gets down.
speaker_heading: PINKY (cont'd)
dialog: Little mothafucka trying to rob me.
dialog: I'mma show you how I do 'em.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I ain't trying to rob you...
speaker_heading: PINKY
dialog: Shut up! Fo' I pump this Glock in yo'
dialog: ass! What did you do wit Day-Day and
dialog: Roach?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Man, Day-Day is my people!
speaker_heading: PINKY
dialog: I said shut up! Now who sent you?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Nobody!
speaker_heading: PINKY
dialog: If you say another word, it's over. I'm
dialog: not playing!
text: Pinky starts to pat down Craig's pockets.
speaker_heading: PINKY (cont'd)
dialog: You ain't got no gun, but where's the
dialog: weed at? I smell it.
text: Craig says nothing.
speaker_heading: PINKY (cont'd)
dialog: I'mma tie you ass up!
text: Pinky backs up and steps on Roach's skateboard. The gun goes
text: flying and so does he. Pinky falls on his ass. The 9mm
text: lands in front of Craig. There's a big scramble for the gun.
scene_heading: BACK STORAGE AREA
text: The mood is serious.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: I gotta think of a plan to get this money
dialog: before tomorrow.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: You could sell your Beamer.
text: Day-Day gives Roach the evil-eye.
speaker_heading: ROACH (cont'd)
dialog: My bad.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: I don't know. I hope Craig got a good
dialog: idea. We gotta ask him when he comes
dialog: out. Let's go and clean up before Pinky
dialog: gets here.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Maybe you can ask him to loan you the
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Yoooo, that's it. You ain't as dumb as I
dialog: think you are, Roach.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: I know.
scene_heading: BACK INSIDE STORE
text: Pinky and Craig are still scrambling for the gun. The store
text: looks like a tornado hit it. Twice. Craig comes up with the
text: pistol. Pinky jumps on the ground.
speaker_heading: PINKY
dialog: Don't kill me.
text: Craig is exhausted. He stands over Pinky with the gun.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Shut up. I been trying to tell yo' ass
dialog: that... Day-Day is my cousin. They're
text: right there in the back.
speaker_heading: PINKY
dialog: Whatever you say, man. I didn't see
dialog: shit. The safe combination is 34-5-27.
dialog: Just take it all.
text: Just then, Day-Day and Roach come from the back.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Craig, what the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: PINKY
dialog: Day-Day, is this your cousin?
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: PINKY
dialog: Good. You fired...and, Roach, your fired
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Why me?
speaker_heading: PINKY
dialog: I smell weed.
text: He looks up at Craig.
speaker_heading: PINKY (cont'd)
dialog: And you...you lucky. I was just about to
dialog: get in yo' ass. Now give me my pistol
dialog: back and get the hell out my store.

text: The Beamer pulls into the driveway. Our trio get out with
text: very long faces.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.O.)
dialog: In a strange way, I feel responsible for
dialog: Day-Day getting fired. If I wouldn't
dialog: have fought Pinky, and gave Day-Day the

text: on the porch.
scene_heading: INT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - MONTAGE SEQUENCE

scene_heading: EXT. FREEWAY - MONTAGE SEQUENCE - AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: MR. JONES

text: He knocks.
speaker_heading: MR. JONES (cont'd)

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Sorry about today, man.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Yeah, me too. Later.

speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: Man, sit down. I can't think with you

text: Day-Day tries to turn around. Craig grabs him.
speaker_heading: CRAIG

text: Day-Day realizes that Craig is right. He takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (cont'd)
dialog: Now all we gotta do is find out where the

dialog: see what's in it.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: You make it sound so easy.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: It is easy. You know why? 'Cause they're
dialog: not expecting it.

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Cheeco.
text: Roach crawls away on his hands and knees.
scene_heading: EXT. JOKER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Roach sneaks past Joker's lowrider. He slowly approaches the

speaker_heading: ROACH

speaker_heading: ROACH (cont'd)
dialog: Cheeco's got to be the dumbest fuckin'
dialog: mutt in the whole wide U.S.A.
text: CHEECO is running at Roach full speed. He jumps on the fence

scene_heading: CRAIG AND DAY-DAY
text: ...hear the DOG BARKING and freeze in their tracks. Day-Day
text: tries to run. Craig grabs him, again.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Wait.
speaker_heading: DAY-DAY

dialog: Wait for what?
text: A LOT of BARKING. Nothing coming.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
text: He's still over by Roach.
speaker_heading: ROACH

scene_heading: INSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The chrome pump is open and filled with money. Baby Joker's

speaker_heading: BABY JOKER
dialog: Want me to take a look?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No, keep working.
text: In the mirror behind Joker, we see a stick slide through the

text: looking in.
text: Just then, Li'l Joker bursts through the door with his shirt
text: off and two half-naked girls on his arms.
speaker_heading: LI'L JOKER
dialog: Yo, man fuck that shit. Do it later.

speaker_heading: DAY-DAY
dialog: I got the B-G's.
speaker_heading: ROACH
text: ... his meat supply is almost gone. He tries to think fast.
text: Cheeco starts to look for more meat. Roach grabs the smashed
text: brownie out of his pocket and throws it to Cheeco. He
text: swallows it in one big gulp. He's looking for more. There
text: is no more. Roach smiles. CHEECO GROWLS.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Good boy. Nice dog.
text: CHEECO'S STILL GROWLING. Suddenly Cheeco falls back on his
text: butt and lets out a slight moan.
speaker_heading: CHEECO'S POV
text: Cheeco is looking up at Roach. He's seeing double, even

speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: No lungs, baby. No lungs.
scene_heading: INSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Craig is in. The bedroom door is cracked. Craig walks over

text: Everybody looks confused.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont'd)

text: Joker starts to kick the door.
scene_heading: INSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Craig hurries to put the pump back. He's about to go for the

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Why didn't she put'em out?
speaker_heading: KARLA
