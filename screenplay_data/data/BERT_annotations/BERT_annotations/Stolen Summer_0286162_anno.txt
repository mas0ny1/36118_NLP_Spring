scene_heading: EXT. O'MALLEY FRONT YARD - MORNING
text: MARGARET O'MALLEY, an auburn haired, sunburned 38-year old
text: mother of eight, stands outside next to the running station
text: wagon. Two children sit in the front seat while three are
text: crammed into the back seat.
text: Margaret is waiting on her two youngest boys to fill the two
text: way back seats that face backwards. KATIE, 4 years old, with
text: strawberry blond hair, rosy cheeks, and a pot belly, sticks
text: her head out the window.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Mom, I told them to be ready by nine
dialog: twenty. They just don’t listen.
text: Margaret ignores Katie. Katie pops back into the car.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PETE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: PETE, 7 years old, who looks like a poster boy for Ireland,
text: lays on his stomach in front of the board game "All Star
text: Baseball". He spins the dial. The dial lands on nine, which
text: is the number that coincides with a strikeout. SEAMUS, nine
text: years old, blondish brown hair, white skin, crystal blue
text: eyes, angelic smile, jumps to the air in celebration.
speaker_heading: SEAMUS:
text: Another comeback stopped.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Reggie Jackson stinks!
speaker_heading: SEAMUS
dialog: We gotta get going. Mom's gonna freak.
text: Seamus heads for the door.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What should we tell her?
text: Seamus looks back at Pete. Pete's hand me down plaid pants
text: barely fit him and fall as he stands up.
speaker_heading: SEAMUS:
dialog: You couldn't find your belt.
text: Seamus takes off down the stairs. Pete, with one hand holding
text: up his pants, follows him down the stairs. Seamus runs out
text: the front door and past his mom.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Why are you late?
text: Seamus, never breaking stride, climbs into the station wagon
text: through the back window.
speaker_heading: SEAMUS
text: Pete couldn't find his belt.
text: Pete runs past his mother.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Why are you late?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Seamus lost my belt.
text: Pete never breaks stride. He jumps into the back of the
text: station wagon. Margaret turns and walks to the car with the
dialog: kind of steam that only eight kids in 18 years can produce.
text: She opens the car door, sits down, calmly puts the car in
text: reverse, and turns her head for the reverse shoulder check.
text: And then all hell breaks loose. Margaret screams at the top
text: of her lungs.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: God gives you 168 hours in a week.
dialog: Can you not give him one full hour
dialog: back? Is that too much to ask?
text: Katie at four years doesn't understand rhetorical questions.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: I've been ready for three hours.
text: EDDIE, 14, brown curly hair, brown eyes, athletic, is at the
text: point in his life when he realizes he has more answers than
dialog: his mom.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (to Katie)
dialog: Shut up you kiss ass.
text: Margaret, with no hesitation, stops the car and smacks Eddie
text: across the face. Eddie winces while TOMMY, 17, also dark
text: haired and dark eyed, laughs. Margaret puts the car in drive
text: and cruises down the street like one big, happy family. WE
text: FOLLOW the camera through the front of the car to the back.
text: PATRICK, 18, blondish brown curly hair and green eyes, holds
text: MOLLY, six months old, in the front seat. Car seats have yet
dialog: to be invented.
text: MARY, 17, auburn haired like her mother and Tommy's twin,
text: sits behind the driver seat because she has learned the long
text: hand of Margaret's wrath cannot reach her in that seat. Tommy
text: reads Eddie the Bazooka Joe joke from his gum wrapper and
text: the two laugh. In the back seat facing out, Pete and Seamus
text: sit. Seamus holds electronic football in his hand and the
text: electronic sound of electronic football players running
text: reverberates throughout the car. WE GO TIGHT on PETE.
speaker_heading: PETE (V.0O.)
dialog: My dad is a fireman.
text: WE PULL BACK and see all of the kids hang out the window and
text: wave at JOE, 40, who is Dark Irish, handsomely weathered,
text: and happy to be at work when his wife takes the kids to
text: church. WE GO TIGHT on JOE as he waves back to the kids.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (sarcastic to fellow
dialog: firemen)
dialog: I wish I could be with them more.
speaker_heading: PETE (V.0O.)
dialog: And my mom?
text: WE GO TIGHT on MARGARET.
speaker_heading: PETE (V.0O.)
dialog: And my mom? She's a part time cook,
text: maid, and nurse. But her full time
dialog: job? She's a front line sergeant in
dialog: God's army.
text: Pete screams as Seamus scores another touchdown on electronic
dialog: football.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Goddammit, would you two shut up
dialog: with that game!
text: Katie puts her hand over her mouth with the sound of the
dialog: swearword.
text: Tommy prepares for battle by holding back his laughter.
text: Margaret erupts.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: The lord's name in vain? Son of a
dialog: bitch.
text: At forty miles an hour in front of the firehouse Margaret
text: lunges her open fist into the backseat and starts swinging
text: like a tornado.
text: Kids scurry, hoping to avoid the path of the tornado. The
text: wagon swerves into the other lane. Joe and his buddies watch
text: from their lounge chairs outside the firehouse. He takes a
text: swig from a plastic cup.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Dying in a fire sometimes doesn't
dialog: sound so bad.
text: The station wagon pulls up to church and the children jump
text: out like clowns from a small car. Margaret drives off as the
text: children exit the station wagon. Patrick lifts Katie up to
text: the basin of holy water.
text: Katie splashes water on her forehead and makes a sign of the
dialog: cross.
text: Patrick, annoyed, puts her down and points his finger at
text: her. He gently touches the water with his index and middle
text: finger and slowly makes the sign of the cross. Katie shakes
text: her head in agreement.
text: Seamus dips his hand in the water and fake sneezes on Pete.
text: Pete punches him in the shoulder. Margaret walks in and
text: proceeds to lead her ducklings down the aisle as the heads
text: in church turn to watch.
text: Each kid genuflects, some better than others, and sit. Pete
text: sits between Seamus and Patrick. He looks at Margaret. She
text: smiles and winks at him. Pete looks up to the life-size Jesus
text: hanging high behind the altar. WE SLOWLY go TIGHT on JESUS
text: hanging on the cross.
speaker_heading: PETE (V.0O.)
dialog: My cousins' families are similar to
dialog: mine. Except some of the dads are
dialog: cops. In my world, there's Irish
dialog: Catholics, and then there's everybody
dialog: else. The only part of this picture
dialog: that doesn't fit for me is Jesus.
dialog: From what I've learned, and according
dialog: to my brother Seamus I've learned
dialog: shit, that's why I'm in second grade,
dialog: but from what I've learned, Jesus is
dialog: not Irish Catholic. My dad says that's
dialog: only a technicality, like Knute
dialog: Rockne, but, still, Jesus is not
dialog: Irish Catholic. He is Jewish. I don't
dialog: know any Jewish people, they don't
dialog: go to Holy Cross, but if I ever meet
dialog: a Jewish person, my mom says my job
dialog: would be to convert them to
dialog: Catholicism. So they could go to
dialog: heaven. I have decided this summer,
dialog: the summer of 1976, I will help a
dialog: Jewish person get to heaven. It will
dialog: be my holy quest.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KEENEY/JONES FUNERAL HOME - A FEW DAYS LATER
text: REVERSE CAM - Looking out through Jesus's eyes. A WAKE. An
text: Irish wake. Two little boys approach the casket. They kneel
text: in front of the casket. Seamus looks at Pete. Pete's eyes
text: are wide in anticipation. Seamus nudges Pete. Pete nudges
text: Seamus back. Seamus makes the sign of the cross and Pete
text: copies him. The two stand and walk away. WE FOLLOW them
text: through the crowd. The boys continue to walk through the
text: crowd but WE STOP at a circle of men holding drinks.
text: JOE, holding a Rum and Coke, is talking out the side of his
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: So? What do I do? Go up to Aunt
dialog: Maggie. Hey Aunt Maggie, did I mention
dialog: Uncle Jim owed me a nickel?
text: The other men laugh. Joe's fat brother, ROGER, answers as if
text: he's Jim's wife. He pulls out a coin
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: I know things are tight, Joe, but
dialog: this is cheap. Even for you.
text: Roger hands Joe the nickel.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well, we'll call it even. That idiot.
dialog: You know if he was up a nickel with
dialog: the book, he would have lived to
dialog: collect.
text: The men laugh heartily.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: A new way to fend off death. Be up
dialog: money with your bookie.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: May old Uncle Jim be in heaven thirty
dialog: minutes before the devil knows he's
dialog: dead.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: He might need more time. What if the
dialog: devil has extradition rights?
text: All of the men laugh. A man hands Joe a drink. He finishes
text: the drink in his right hand as he accepts the fresh drink in
text: his left hand.
text: Seamus and Pete come running back through the crowd. Margaret,
text: standing with four women and smoking, calls them over.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Did you pray for your great uncle's
dialog: soul?
text: Pete looks at Seamus. Seamus looks down at Pete. Pete looks
text: up at his mom.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We didn't know his soul.
text: The women laugh.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Cause he didn't have one.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Go back up there and pray to Jesus
dialog: for the soul of your Uncle Jim. He
dialog: needs your prayers.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: So I've heard. But Mom, how do we
dialog: know our prayers will help Old Uncle
dialog: Jim get to heaven?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Faith. Now go ahead.
speaker_heading: SEAMUS
dialog: Mom, we can't go back up there. We
dialog: already prayed to Jesus for his soul.
text: Mom looks at Pete for affirmation. Pete looks up to Seamus.
text: He looks back up to Mom.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Did you pray to Jesus?
text: Pete looks at Seamus. Seamus gives him that scared look of
text: having to look at that dead body up close again. Pete looks
text: at the dead body.
text: He looks back at his mom. He nods his head in the affirmative.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Well, nobody can have too many
dialog: prayers. Go again.
text: Pete and Seamus head toward the casket.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: How did she know I was lying?
speaker_heading: SEAMUS:
dialog: You weren't convincing. And she's
dialog: got some kinda built in lie detector.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: How many lies do we get till we go
dialog: to hell?
speaker_heading: SEAMUS
text: Forty-seven.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I don't think I have many left. And
dialog: I got my whole life ahead of me.
speaker_heading: SEAMUS:
dialog: That one doesn't count. You just
text: nodded. Nodding up and down in China
dialog: is like saying no.
speaker_heading: PETE
text: Things are upside down in China.
text: Seamus begins to nod yes but changes it to a shake. Margaret
text: watches the boys as they approach the casket. The boys
text: approach the dead body.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What's faith?
text: Seamus's eyes are bugging out.
speaker_heading: SEAMUS:
dialog: A word grown ups use when they don't
dialog: have the answer.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - NEXT DAY
text: WE GO TIGHT on an ELECTRONIC FOOTBALL GAME. WE HEAR the noises
text: of the game. WE PULL BACK to see Pete playing the game in
text: the back of the room. A nun stands at the front of the class
text: and is talking to the class.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: This summer, take time to reflect on
dialog: your past year in the second grade.
dialog: And how you can make third grade
dialog: better.
text: The electronic defense tackles Pete and makes a double click
dialog: noise.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: Mr. O'Malley? Do you disagree with
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No, Sister Leonora Mary. I agree.
text: The bell rings. The kids scream with happiness. School's out
dialog: for the summer.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: See you at church. And next year in
dialog: third grade.
text: The boys run for the door.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: Mr. O'Malley, may I speak to you for
dialog: a moment?
text: The boys stop. Pete looks at them. The guys don't hesitate.
text: They run out of the room. Sister Leonora Mary and Pete are
dialog: alone.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yes, Sister Leonora Mary.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: How many times did I have to pull
dialog: you by your ears to the front of the
dialog: class and give you the ruler?
text: Pete looks around for the answer.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: A lot!
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: Probably too many times, don't you
dialog: think?
text: Pete nods.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: I don't enjoy having to do that, you
dialog: know.
text: Pete looks at the ground and scratches the back of his neck.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: I think this is an important summer
dialog: for you. This is the summer that you
dialog: can choose to keep following the
dialog: devil's way, or create a new path
dialog: toward Jesus. Which path do you want
dialog: to take?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: The Jesus path.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: Good. I expect to see a difference
dialog: in you next year.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You will, Sister Leonora Mary. I've
dialog: got a plan. A quest!
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: Good! You may go. Enjoy your summer,
dialog: I know you will.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You too Sister Leonora Mary.
text: Pete heads toward the door. He turns around.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Do you know where I can find a
dialog: synagogue?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SYNAGOGUE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Pete stops his bike outside the synagogue. He looks to the
text: top to see if there is a cross. No cross. A small family
text: walks out of the synagogue. The men wear yarmukles. Pete
text: stares at the yarmukles. He walks his bike to the door. He
text: tries to open the door and maneuver the bike through the
text: door. He is unsuccessful. A bearded, tiny gray man with
text: glasses opens the door. Rabbi Kenny Jacobsen smiles at the
text: young leprechaun.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: May I help you, son of Saint Patrick?
text: Pete looks at him weird but shrugs off the name calling. He
text: notices the rabbi wears a yarmukle also.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Whadaya got on the top of your head?
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: The rabbi
dialog: It's a yarmukle.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Doesn't really block the sun.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: No but it covers bald spots.
text: leans over, takes off the yarmukle, and shows Pete
text: his bald spot.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It does cover the bald spot. My old
dialog: Uncle Jim could have used that.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: So what can I do you for?
text: Pete looks around.
dialog: The rabbi
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Jewish people go here?
dialog: nods.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I'm looking to see if I can help
dialog: Jewish people get to heaven.
speaker_heading: RABBI
text: A noble endeavor.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: A quest!
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: A noble quest! What can I do to assist
dialog: your quest?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Well, I just wanted to check out the
text: synagogue. But there's no bike rack.
dialog: Don't kids go here?
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Yes. But not for school. How ‘bout I
dialog: hold onto your bike in the back of
dialog: the Temple as you look around?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Thanks.
text: Pete enters the temple with Rabbi Jacobsen following him
text: with the bike. The place is round and expansive. Pete looks
text: around. After looking, Pete heads to the back of the temple
text: where the rabbi waits for him with his bike.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No cross?
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: No cross.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I find the cross fun to look at.
dialog: Sometimes I think about climbing the
text: wall at Holy Cross and unscrewing
text: the nails, and letting him go. Makes
dialog: mass go faster. You should think
dialog: about putting in a cross.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: I'll look into that. So what are you
dialog: thinking?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: That this is where the quest starts.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Well, if I can be of service, you
dialog: let me know. My office is just over
dialog: there. I've got to get home to my
dialog: family. I have a boy around your
dialog: age. How old are you?
speaker_heading: PETE
text: Seven. Almost eight.
speaker_heading: RABBI
text: He's six. Almost seven.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You can have a family?
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Then what do they call you?
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Well, my boys call me father. But my
dialog: congregation calls me Rabbi. Rabbi
dialog: Jacobsen.
text: Rabbi Jacobsen puts his hand out. Pete shakes it.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I'm Pete. Pete O'Malley. Nice to
dialog: meet you Rabbi Jacobsen.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Nice to meet you.
text: The rabbi and Pete head out of the temple.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN TABLE - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: The O'Malley's sit at the dinner table. Three things are a
text: constant at the dinner table. Meat, potatoes, and chaos.
text: Katie starts to yelp.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Can I have your attention? Please. I
dialog: got something to say. Please!
text: Everyone at the table slowly quiets down.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Better make this good Katie.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: I will.
text: The room is quiet. Katie looks at everyone.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Today. I was on my bike. And I pedaled
dialog: my bike to the O'Connors. And I
text: pedaled back. And it was sunny.
text: Everyone stares at her.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: That's it.
text: Eddie shakes his head in amazement and grins.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Katie, you need to come up with a
dialog: more exciting story.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: I will.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You know, like maybe crash your bike,
dialog: and get really bloody and do the
text: wounded soldier back to the house.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Eddie!
text: The older kids laugh.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Anyone know what a yarmukle is?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: A beanie?
text: Patrick looks at Pete.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Jewish people wear them. It's
dialog: traditional headwear.
speaker_heading: SEAMUS
dialog: Like feathers for an Indian?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What's it for?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: To hide their horns.
text: The older kids laugh. Margaret winces.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: They got horns?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: No. They do not have horns. Joe,
dialog: please. The young ones don't need
dialog: this. Let's change the subject.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Patrick, your Uncle Charlie says he
dialog: could get you an interview over at
text: the city planners office.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What about the fire department?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That's always there. Well, kid, what
dialog: the hell are you going to do?
text: The kids react to the word hell.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I've applied for some scholarships.
dialog: I should hear about them soon. Until
dialog: then, I can keep life guarding. Saving
dialog: money .
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Life guarding? I've raised a
text: professional lifeguarder. In Chicago.
dialog: Work three months a year.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: And he doesn't even look like Sheila
text: Moran in his suit.
text: Tommy blushes.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Sheila! Oh Sheila. Save me!
text: Joe laughs.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Don't let her old man catch her saving
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
text: Eddie doesn't know what he's talking
dialog: about. I don't like her.
text: Mary speaks matter of factly.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Francis Demos told me Sheila likes
dialog: you so all you need to do is ask her
dialog: out.
text: Patrick gets up from the table as Tommy, Mary, and Eddie
text: continue to talk about Sheila Moran. Seamus is bent over
text: showing Pete where the horns protrude from the head. Katie
text: feeds the cocker spaniel her mashed potatoes under the table
text: while Molly drinks from the bottle in Nancy's arms. Joe
text: watches Patrick walk out of the room. He looks at Margaret
text: for some answer. Margaret shrugs her shoulders.
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NEXT DAY
text: Pete and Seamus walk down the tree lined city block in their
text: neighborhood. The two sip milkshakes.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: There's nothing better than a bubble
dialog: gum milk shake. How come that girl
dialog: looks at us so funny when we order
dialog: it?
text: Seamus shrugs.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I mean, it's a two for one. Ice cream
text: shake, and then the bubble gum sinks
text: to the bottom, and when the shake's
dialog: done, you got a whole pack of bubble
dialog: gum to chew. All for the price of
dialog: one shake.
text: Seamus takes the lid off the cup and tries to finish the
text: shake in one big gulp. He succeeds. Seamus now chews on a
text: wad of gum. Pete and Seamus pass a lemonade stand.
text: Ten cents a cup. Pete motions to the lemonade entrepreneurs
text: that his shake has bankrupt him for the day.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You ever feel that there's more out
dialog: there? Like there's more for you to
dialog: do than just play ball and eat ice
dialog: cream?
text: Seamus shakes his head. He blows a bubble. Pete blows a
dialog: bubble.
speaker_heading: SEAMUS:
dialog: You gonna play baseball at 11?
text: Pete shakes his head.
speaker_heading: SEAMUS:
dialog: You heading over to the synagogue?
text: Pete nods. Seamus blows a bubble.
speaker_heading: SEAMUS:
dialog: You know, this whole thing's kinda
dialog: weird. You going there, the quest.
text: Pete nods.
speaker_heading: SEAMUS:
dialog: Well, at least you know it's weird.
text: Pete and Seamus walk down the street in silence. Enjoying
dialog: another day without responsibility.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SYNAGOGUE - LATER THAT MORNING
text: Pete knocks on the door of Rabbi Jacobsen's office.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Come in.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Hey Rabbi Jacobsen, Pete O'Malley.
dialog: We met the other day.
text: The rabbi stands up from his desk. He puts his hand out.
text: Pete shakes it.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Mr. O'Malley. How are you today?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I'm good thanks. Ready to start my
dialog: quest. But I thought I might ask you
dialog: for your permission first.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: What are your plans?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Sort of a "lemonade-free trip to
dialog: heaven" stand.
text: The rabbi chuckles. He stops.
speaker_heading: RABBI
text: Enterprising.
text: Pete shrugs off that word.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yep. Jewish people gotta like
dialog: lemonade?
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Very much so. I believe Moses set
dialog: one up at Mount Sinai.
text: Again Pete shrugs off that statement.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I figured I might set up the stand
dialog: right at the door. And I'm not going
dialog: to charge.
speaker_heading: RABBI
text: A future car salesman.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Right. OK then. Thanks. I'll let you
dialog: know how it goes.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: You know, Jewish people believe in
dialog: heaven. It's just that we believe
dialog: it's not open yet.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Well, maybe I can get the people
dialog: that don't want to wait.
text: The rabbi laughs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SYNAGOGUE - MINUTES LATER
text: The rabbi walks back to the door. He turns back to look at
text: Pete taping the poster to the wall. FREE LEMONADE. FREE TRIP
text: TO HEAVEN.
text: The rabbi laughs. He opens the door and heads into the
dialog: synagogue.
text: Pete takes a seat at his stand.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SYNAGOGUE - HOURS LATER
text: The rabbi watches Pete through a window in the synagogue.
text: Pete looks around. No business. He looks around again. He
text: pours himself a cup of lemonade and gulps it. He puts the
text: lemonade back in its place.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SYNAGOGUE - END OF THE DAY
text: The rabbi walks out to the stand. Pete looks dejected.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Rome wasn't built in a day, Pete.
text: Pete doesn't understand.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: How do you make any money here? I'm
text: free, and still nobody.
text: The rabbi pats Pete on the top of the head.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: I envy your youth. Come back tomorrow.
text: Pete looks at all of his stuff.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: I'll store your office right here
dialog: inside the front door. For free.
text: Pete smiles.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You and I seem to be the only two on
dialog: this block that care about free stuff.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Because we're the only two that
dialog: realize that you can't buy what we
dialog: have to offer. It's free.
text: Pete and the rabbi place the desk, chair, and poster inside
text: the synagogue. Pete shakes the rabbi's hand and rides his
dialog: bike home.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SYNAGOGUE - NEXT DAY
text: Pete sits at his stand. The rabbi parks his car on the street
text: 100 feet from Pete's stand. The rabbi doesn't want to block
text: Pete's storefront billboard. The rabbi steps out of his car.
text: His secretary, Julie, a pretty, voluptuous, middle aged woman
text: who obviously was waiting for the rabbi, walks out the door
text: and greets the rabbi. Pete watches her.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Rabbi Jacobsen, you've received six
dialog: messages.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Door to door service. Julie, I don't
dialog: pay you enough.
text: Julie hands the rabbi his telephone messages. The rabbi reads

speaker_heading: RABBI
text: Most of the members don't seem to
dialog: notice this temple, except during
dialog: the high holidays or when they need
dialog: something. Pete's giving us free
dialog: advertising.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: But he's advertising Christianity.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: No, he's advertising thought. He's
dialog: asking people to have a cup of free
dialog: lemonade with him and maybe get some
dialog: insight into how to get to heaven.
dialog: Doesn't seem like this neighborhood

speaker_heading: SEAMUS
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Hey.
text: Seamus gets off his bike and pours himself a cup of lemonade.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Don't pour it all.
text: Seamus looks around. As if there was a public stampede for
text: Pete's lemonade. Seamus waves to Rabbi Jacobsen. The rabbi
text: walks toward the stand.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Rabbi Jacobsen, this is my older
dialog: brother Seamus. He's nine.
text: The rabbi shakes Seamus's hand.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: I'm Rabbi Jacobsen. I'm forty-four.
dialog: How many are there?
speaker_heading: SEAMUS
dialog: Eight. But my oldest brother might
dialog: go to college, so then there will be
dialog: seven. And maybe we'll get his room.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Quite a flock.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Got a dog too. Wanna cup of lemonade
dialog: Rabbi?
speaker_heading: RABBI

speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: YOUNG BOY
dialog: Rabbi! Rabbi!
text: A young boy comes running full speed around the corner.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BOY
dialog: Rabbi! Rabbi!
text: The rabbi's face turns white.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: What is it Steven?
text: The sounds of fire engines roaring fill the air. A huge fire
text: engine turns the corner and races past.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Rabbi, your house is on fire. Big
dialog: fire!
text: The Rabbi doesn't hear the last line. He takes off in a full
text: sprint back the way Steven came. Another fire engine races
text: past. WE FOLLOW the fire engine. WE PASS OVER THE TOP of the
text: FIRE ENGINE to the other side where JOE O'MALLEY hangs on.
text: WE FOLLOW THE FIRE ENGINE up the block where people stand
text: outside watching a house burn. The rabbi reaches the house
text: at the same time the fire engine does.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: My boys! Where are my boys? David?
dialog: Danny?
text: The rabbi furiously searches the crowd. Joe O'Malley reaches
text: the rabbi. A quick exchange between the two. The rabbi takes
text: off toward the stairs of his house. Two other firemen catch
text: him and hold him back. Joe motions to the firemen to pull
text: him back and the rest of the crowd to the other side of the
text: street. He grabs a couple of other firemen who aim the hoses
text: at the front door. Joe runs into the house and disappears
text: into the smoke.
text: A CLOSE SHOT on Pete and Seamus, who have been watching from
text: the corner. Mrs. Jacobsen arrives. The rabbi grabs her. Mrs.
text: Jacobsen starts to cry. Everyone watches for Joe to reappear
text: with two boys in hands. The firemen hose the flames. The
text: rabbi makes another run for the house, but this time policemen
text: hold him back. The rabbi goes limp as the two policemen hold
text: him up. The rabbi's eyes are fixated on the front door. Where
text: there is just smoke, the outline of Joe O'Malley appears. He
text: has a child, Danny, wrapped in a blanket in his arms. He
text: runs down the stairs and across the street. He hands the boy
text: off to the paramedics. Danny is suffering from smoke
text: inhalation but is OK. His parents surround him.
text: The rabbi screams at Joe. Joe can only read his lips. David!
dialog: David! My other boy! David!
text: Joe looks back at the house. The flames rage uncontrollably
text: and the other houses are now in danger of catching fire. The
text: rabbi grabs Joe by the shoulders and screams. This time Joe's
text: eyes are only on the fire. Joe takes off toward the house. A
text: firemen tries to stop him but Joe bounces off him like a
text: running back. As he reaches the front steps, an explosion
text: knocks him back ten feet and flames roar out the front door.
text: Firemen trample Joe as his coat catches on fire. They stamp
text: out the fire while they hold him down. Joe rolls over and
text: stares at the Jacobsens. Mrs. Jacobsen is hysterically crying
text: as the rabbi stares aimlessly. The rabbi turns slowly and
text: buries his wife's head in his chest. Danny, his youngest
text: son, stares over his oxygen mask and up at his parents. Joe
text: stands up and is escorted toward the ambulance as other
text: firemen storm the house with more hoses. A CLOSE SHOT of
text: PETE. His face is void of any emotion other than a look that
text: says he thought his dad was dead. A CLOSE SHOT of SEAMUS.
text: Tears stream down his face. As his dad clears the crowd and
text: reaches the ambulance on his own two feet, Seamus takes off
text: in a full sprint and covers the fifty yards in seconds. Pete
text: stands still.
speaker_heading: SEAMUS
dialog: Dad! Dad! Dad!
text: Joe looks up and before he knows it Seamus is jumping into
text: his arms.
text: Joe puts Seamus down instantly and starts to scream.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What the hell are you doing here?
dialog: Jesus Christ Seamus! Jesus Christ!
text: Seamus's face turns white. Joe looks up and sees Pete standing
text: on the corner frozen.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: And you brought your brother?
text: Joe slaps Seamus across the face.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: How many times have I told you not
dialog: to chase fire engines! It's dangerous.
dialog: You could have killed yourself and
dialog: your brother. Go home! And wait for
dialog: me in your room!
text: Seamus turns around and walks toward Pete. Seamus reaches
text: Pete, who is still frozen. Seamus never looks up from the
dialog: pavement.
speaker_heading: SEAMUS
dialog: Come on.
text: Pete looks at his dad, who now sits on the back of the
text: ambulance as paramedics care for him. Pete looks further at
text: Rabbi Jacobsen. Danny Jacobsen, six years old and bald,
text: catches Pete's eye. They look at each other. Pete turns and

text: WE GO UP THE STAIRS AND DOWN THE HALLWAY to Pete and Seamus's
dialog: room.
text: They both sit on their beds staring quietly at the ceiling.
text: Seamus throws a tennis ball to himself. The front door opens
text: and screams of DAD fill the house. Pete turns and looks at
text: Seamus. Seamus fixates on the rotation of the ball as it
text: leaves his hand. He repeats this over and over. Joe enters
text: the bedroom and closes the door behind him.
text: Pete and Seamus sit up. Joe grabs a chair and flips it around
text: so he's leaning forward on the back of the chair.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: How many times have I told you boys?
text: Seamus begins to speak. Joe cuts him off.
speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Rabbi Jacobsen's son died?
text: Joe nods.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What were you two doing in that

text: Pete and Seamus stay silent.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You're both grounded. You can't leave

speaker_heading: SEAMUS

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That's it.

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Jewish people can't go to heaven.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Mom says they can be converted.
dialog: Through Jesus. I asked Father Kelly

dialog: another sip.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: So I've been going over to the temple
text: on Oakley. Looking for Jewish people.
dialog: I met Rabbi Jacobsen. He's like a

dialog: been real nice. And I feel really
dialog: bad for him now that his son has
dialog: died.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: How old are you?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Seven. And a half. You know.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You should be playing baseball and

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Seamus was just seeing how things

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Don't go to that synagogue anymore.
dialog: You go to church. Let the Jewish

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: MARGARET

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Too much weight? You're skinnier and

speaker_heading: MARGARET

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (sarcastic to the

dialog: Tell me about your day.
dialog: (As wall)
dialog: Well, it was a day like any other

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Whaddaya want from me?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Not the tough guy I'm being

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm not finding that as funny.

speaker_heading: MARGARET

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I can't watch these kid's every move.

dialog: calling to say he was trouble.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Now that's parenting 101. My kid's

speaker_heading: MARGARET

speaker_heading: ROGER

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Why you try to convince us? You never
dialog: bet against the Sox. Ever.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: I like their lineup. It's explosive.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You ever think about betting the
dialog: other team. When you're betting,
dialog: don't let your heart get in the way
dialog: of a good decision.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Yeah, but when your heart and mind
dialog: are in together, it's a sure bet.
speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Shut the hell up Roger. Jack's

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I do it to win. Five hundred to two

speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Gentlemen.

speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: My wife, my son, and I wanted to

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Thank you.
text: The men, still quiet, nod. Jack takes a tray from Joe and
text: the other tray from the rabbi. Joe puts out his hand.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Rabbi, Joe O'Malley. I'm sorry for
dialog: your loss.
text: The men nod in agreement.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Thank you. My son David was a good
dialog: boy.
text: The rabbi looks at the shiny red fire trucks.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: He loved you firemen. Never understood
dialog: why I couldn't be a fireman on the

dialog: the house.
text: The men laugh. Danny smiles. Joe nudges Roger and points to
text: his head. Roger nods knowingly and walks into the firehouse.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: My wife figures the best way to thank
text: a man is through his stomach. She
dialog: baked some lasagna for all of you in
dialog: appreciation.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It's real good.
text: Joe looks at Danny.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I bet it is.
dialog: (To Rabbi)
dialog: My guys love a good meal, but I wish

dialog: just doing our job.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: A heroic job you do. My wife wanted
dialog: to thank you personally. My synagogue
dialog: will want to thank you formally.
dialog: Joe looks down. Not heroic enough to save your other son,
dialog: Joe thinks.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: I don't know if you're allowed to
dialog: drink red wine on the job, but lasagna
dialog: just isn't as good without a fine

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nothing is as good without a fine

speaker_heading: ROGER

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: You're welcome. You a big Sox fan?
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: Huge. Zisk crushes the ball.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Especially against lefties. You wanna
dialog: check out the firetruck?

text: other men follow.
text: Joe stays out with Rabbi Jacobsen. The rabbi breaks the
dialog: silence.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: It is Jewish custom to sit chiva at
text: the house of the deceased. It is a
dialog: sign of support to the family of the
dialog: deceased.
speaker_heading: JOE
text: Like a wake.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Yes, like a wake. I know you are a
dialog: busy man, but if you have time, I

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You bet.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Obviously, it is not at my home. But

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: RABBI

text: Danny is on the back of the truck.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Dad! Check me out!

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: RABBI

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I found out he's been a nuisance at

speaker_heading: RABBI

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: JEFFREY

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: JOE

scene_heading: MRS. JACOBSEN

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Leukemia. It's cancer. I take this

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Does it hurt?
speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: My friend Charlie's got red hair.
text: They throw the ball back and forth.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I'm sorry about your brother.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Thanks. You know, since my cancer,

dialog: brothers?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Four older brothers.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Wow. You must get your butt kicked?
text: Pete nods.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: My older sister's worse. My brothers

dialog: my hair. That hurts. I wish I were
dialog: bald then.
text: Danny smiles.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Was the fire scary?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I don't know what happened. David
text: was watching cartoons in the TV room.
dialog: I was upstairs playing baseball. And
dialog: then I noticed a lot of smoke. I
dialog: opened my door but there was a lot
text: of fire. I tried to open my window,
dialog: but I couldn't. I couldn't see the
dialog: fire anymore because the smoke got
dialog: so thick. And then your dad came in.
dialog: He saved my life, I think. It was
dialog: nothing like the fire drills you do
dialog: in school.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Where do you go to school?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Briarwood. How ‘bout you?
speaker_heading: PETE
text: Holy Cross. Going into third grade.
speaker_heading: DANNY

text: The boys throw the ball back and forth.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What's it like to be Jewish?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I don't know. Good.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I'm Catholic.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What's that like?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Noisier.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Things are usually noisier around
dialog: here. But everyone's really sad.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: My Uncle Jim died a few weeks ago.
dialog: He was old. He was really my
dialog: grandfather's brother, but we still
dialog: called him Uncle Jim.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I got an uncle like that. Harvey.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You would have thought my uncle's
dialog: funeral was a birthday party.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Sounds like fun.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah it is. My mom says that people
dialog: are sad because they love the person,
dialog: but are happy cause they get to go
dialog: to heaven. Jewish people can't go to
dialog: heaven.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Cause they're Jewish. God doesn't
dialog: let Jewish people in heaven.
text: Danny's quiet.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: If you're interested, I think I can
dialog: show you how to get to heaven.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yep. I would just have to convert
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: How do you do that?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I don't know. I haven't converted
dialog: anyone before.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What can I do in heaven?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Anything you want. They call it
dialog: paradise.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Sounds good. When can we start?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Tomorrow.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I got my last chemotherapy treatment

speaker_heading: PETE

dialog: But it doesn't hurt. I'm gonna convert
dialog: him.
text: Joe shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Leave him alone.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: He wants to.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: But his parents don't. Look, he's
dialog: Jewish. His family's Jewish. If they
dialog: wanted to be Christian, his parents
dialog: would change.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: But it's a quest.
speaker_heading: JOE
text: The quest has been called off.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I promised Danny. We're meeting at
dialog: the synagogue.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well, I'm breaking that promise. You
dialog: can't go converting Jewish kids the
dialog: same way they don't go converting
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: But he wants to.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I said no. No more lip from you. Do
dialog: not go to that synagogue and do not
dialog: bother Danny or his family anymore.
dialog: Do you understand me?
text: Pete doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Do you understand me? If I find out

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What's our mission?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: To get you to heaven.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Right. How we gonna know I got to
dialog: heaven?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We'll just know.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: So what are we gonna do?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We got to set up some tests.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Like school.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah. But those tests aren't fun.
dialog: What's the purpose of making it to
dialog: heaven if the tests aren't fun?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Have you taken any of these tests?
text: Pete thinks.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Since I'm Catholic, I don't think I
dialog: have to. It's just automatic.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: That's cool.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah. But you know what. For my first
dialog: communion next year, I have to
dialog: complete first communion training.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What's communion?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: This piece of bread that is Jesus.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: And you eat it?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Gross.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I watch people eat it and they don't
dialog: gross out. And my brothers say it
dialog: tastes like wheat bread.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Not as good as white. So I should do
dialog: the first communion training.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I haven't done it yet, so I don't
dialog: know what it is.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Darn.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: But we can make up our own.
dialog: The kids think.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: How about something like Bruce Jenner
dialog: and a decathlon? Win the decathlon,
dialog: go to heaven.
text: Pete thinks.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah, something like that.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: And then we should have a gold medal

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Communion can be your medal.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: The Jesus wheat bread?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I'd rather have a medal.
speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: DANNY

text: Pete and Danny head toward the water.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Look, I'm not asking you to do

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Do I have to get to the buoy and
dialog: back under a certain amount of time.
text: Pete looks at the buoy. He looks at Danny.
speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Don't worry. I'm here. And there are

text: Halfway to the buoy, he tries to pick his head up to see

text: grabs him.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You OK?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I couldn't make it. And then I
dialog: remembered what my swim teacher taught

speaker_heading: DANNY

text: Danny nods.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: The first time I took chemotherapy,

dialog: a second time, I was the only one.
dialog: The others died.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: I asked. The nurses got all quiet.
dialog: Grown ups always get quiet when they

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Not at my uncle's funeral.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Sometimes I hear my parents talk
text: about it late at night and they cry.

dialog: if I die.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No, I wouldn't want that either.

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: No. I gotta do it alone.

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Your problem is when you look up and

dialog: and panic.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I don't get scared.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah you do.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: No I don't.
speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Well, I'ma little bigger so it's
dialog: going to take you a few more strokes.
dialog: Can you count to sixty?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Well then, just count to sixty strokes
dialog: and then swim back. It might take

dialog: back.
speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: DOCTOR

scene_heading: MRS. JACOBSEN

speaker_heading: DOCTOR

speaker_heading: RABBI
text: Yep. Chemotherapy. It zaps him of

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Yes it does. But that's how doctors

text: snow white hair, skin cancered face, cantankerous old man,
text: notices Pete and walks over.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Mr. O'Malley? Are you lost?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Hey Father. No, I promised a friend
dialog: I'd pray for him. He's sick.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Well, maybe I can say a prayer for
dialog: him also.
text: Father Kelly sits down next to Pete.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: His name's Danny. He's got cancer.
text: Father Kelly does the sign of the cross. He closes his eyes.
text: Pete stares at him. Father Kelly opens one eye at Pete.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: You finish your prayer?
text: Pete nods.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Well, let me finish my prayers without
dialog: you bothering me.
text: Pete stands up and walks toward the altar. Father Kelly
text: watches him.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Just checking out how this place
dialog: looks from your seat.
text: Pete takes a seat in a chair to the left of the altar. Father
text: Kelly stands and walks toward the altar.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: That's my seat. Don't mess it up.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You get nervous with everyone looking
dialog: at you?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: I'm used to being looked at.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You ever get nervous that you won't
dialog: know what to say or you'll forget
dialog: what you wanted to say?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: How do you get paid?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: That's between me and the IRS.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Do you get the collection money?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: No. Someone tell you I did?
text: Pete shakes his head.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Do you need to get home?
text: Pete shakes his head.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Your job's to help people to get to
dialog: heaven, right?
text: Father Kelly nods.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: How do you know if you've done your
dialog: job good?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Well. I pray that I do it well. why?
dialog: You have any complaints?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You ever actually seen someone in
dialog: heaven?
text: Father Kelly shakes his head.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Then how do you know if the people
dialog: you're helping made it to heaven?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Faith.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Faith?
speaker_heading: FATHER
text: Yep. Believing in something completely
text: without actually having proof of it.
dialog: Faith. I don't have any proof of
dialog: heaven, but I have faith it exists.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What's the best way to get to heaven?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: By believing in Jesus and doing as
dialog: he taught us.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: How do we know if we're doing that?
dialog: Is there some test?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Life is a test.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: But then you need to die to figure
dialog: out how you did on the test?
text: Father Kelly laughs. He nods. He opens the altar and fills
text: the chalice with hosts.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Don't you just once want to know if
dialog: one of the people you prayed for
dialog: made it to heaven?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: In due time.
text: Father Kelly finishes filling the chalice with bread.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What's the purpose of communion?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: To have a piece of Jesus be a part
dialog: of us.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Why do I have to wait till third
dialog: grade for that? Wouldn't that help
dialog: me now?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: The Church believes that Catholics
dialog: should fulfill a few requirements
dialog: before they earn communion.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Pete runs
dialog: Like passing a few tests?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: So if I pass all the tests, I get to
dialog: have communion.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Thanks Father. You've cleared up a
dialog: few things for me.

dialog: could stop by after work. I said
dialog: fine.
text: Pete's eyes light up but he doesn't want to say anything
dialog: that would get him in trouble.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: This gratitude stuff is becoming
text: intrusive.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: If the only fault you can find with
dialog: a person is that they go overboard
dialog: with kindness and gratitude, I can
dialog: live with that.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah. Yeah.
dialog: (To Patrick's chair)
dialog: Where's knucklehead?
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: He said he'd be home late for dinner.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh yeah. Did he say why?
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: He told me to mind my own business.
speaker_heading: JOE
text: He's probably sitting on his ass

speaker_heading: SEAMUS:
text: Tommy and Eddie have a game up north.
text: Another doubleheader. And Mary's
text: eating at a friends.
text: The doorbell rings. Pete and Katie run to get it. Pete lets
text: Katie open the door. Rabbi Jacobsen stands with a tray of
dialog: rugala, a Jewish pastry.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Hello. I know Pete, and whom may I
dialog: ask are you?
text: Katie puts her hand out. The rabbi goes to shake her hand
text: but she put her hand out to take the tray.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: This might be too big for you.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: I handle bigger trays than that in
dialog: the kitchen. How do you think I feed
dialog: eight kids?
text: The Rabbi nods and hands the dish to Katie. She carries it
text: into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: How's Danny doing?
speaker_heading: RABBI
text: He's doing better. Still not ready
dialog: to play but he said to say hi and
dialog: he'll stop by to see you when he can
dialog: play again.
text: Pete looks back to see if his dad heard that. He didn't.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Come on in. We're just eating dinner.

speaker_heading: SEAMUS
dialog: Rabbi Jacobsen.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Seamus. Nice to see you.
text: Joe stands up and shakes the rabbi's hand. The rabbi walks
text: over and says hello to Margaret and pats little Molly on the
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Would you like some dinner? There's
dialog: plenty.
text: The rabbi looks at the well sliced pieces of ham and huge
text: bowl of mashed potatoes.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: No thank you. My wife knows when
dialog: I've been eating other people's
text: dinner. She considers it a form of
dialog: adultery.
text: Margaret laughs.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: How ‘bout some coffee?
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Sure.
text: Katie stands up and walks toward the coffee pot.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Black? Cream? Sugar?
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Two sugars. Thank you.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: You're welcome.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Please sit.
text: The rabbi takes a seat at the table.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: How's your little boy?
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Hanging in there, thank you. He just
dialog: finished more treatment and hopefully
dialog: this works.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: We hope so too.
text: Margaret comes back with the rugala on a plate. Katie hands
text: the rabbi his coffee. Margaret takes a bite of the rugala.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It's absolutely delicious.
text: The rabbi takes a little.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: She can't get mad at me if I'm eating
dialog: her own stuff. Rugala, a Jewish
dialog: pastry. My favorite.
text: Margaret hands the rugala out to the boys and Joe. They're
text: all very happy.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: So what's going on?
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Well, remember when I told you that
dialog: my congregation will want to formally
dialog: thank you for your bravery.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: There's no need, Rabbi. And that's
dialog: the end of that.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Well, maybe Margaret and you would
dialog: like to talk about it more in private?
text: Joe looks at the boys. Seamus's busy eating his rugala and
text: Pete stares at the rabbi.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That's OK.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Well, you personally showed bravery
dialog: beyond the call of duty when you
dialog: saved Danny, and if it weren't for
dialog: the gas pipe blowing up, you were
dialog: going back in against the wishes of
dialog: your partners.
text: Joe is embarrassed and quiet.
speaker_heading: RABBI
text: The firemen saved the fire from
dialog: spreading and many of the people
dialog: from my temple live in that
dialog: neighborhood.
text: Patrick enters the front door. He walks into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Patrick, I would like you to meet
dialog: Rabbi Jacobsen.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Patrick, your brother Peter has told
dialog: me much about you. Nice to meet you.
text: They shake hands.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Nice to meet you, Rabbi. I'm sorry
dialog: for your loss.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Thank you. Well, Patrick, I was just
dialog: telling your father that my temple
dialog: would like to say thank you to him.
dialog: And it might interest you.
text: Patrick sits down.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Pete has told me of your wish to go
dialog: to college and study medicine.
text: Patrick looks at Pete. Joe looks at Pete. Pete knows his
text: dad's look is not the same as Patrick's and Pete looks down.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: My temple gives educational
dialog: scholarships to deserving students,
dialog: and the scholarship board has
dialog: recommended Patrick for a full
dialog: scholarship to a state university.
text: Patrick's jaw drops. Margaret sits shocked and Joe stands
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Rabbi Jacobsen, that is an extremely
dialog: kind offer, but one that we cannot
dialog: accept.
text: Patrick looks at Joe and tears form in his eyes.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: It would mean a lot to our
dialog: congregation and personally to my
dialog: family if you would accept it.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Other men risked their lives that
dialog: day and every other day.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: We understand that. But, to be frank,
dialog: it's more personal than say giving
text: the fire department a sculpture in
dialog: gratitude. Your fire chief approved
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You spoke to my boss?
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Yes. We wanted to make sure it was
dialog: within the rules. The scholarship
dialog: board can only grant one scholarship,
dialog: and when Pete told me of Patrick's
dialog: desire, I recommended Patrick.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I imagine they want to give it to
dialog: him in a big ceremony?
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Yes, I would imagine so. I think it
dialog: would be a good public gesture.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Free publicity for the temple.
text: Patrick stands up at that last comment.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Joe!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Rabbi, thank you for stopping over.
dialog: The rabbi
dialog: My son Pete has a big mouth, and my
dialog: family doesn't need your handouts.
dialog: We thank you for your kindness.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: You can't do this to me.

speaker_heading: RABBI

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Rabbi, you have been anything but
dialog: harmful. Thank you.
text: pats Pete and Seamus on the head. He heads for the
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Mr. O'Malley. I did not intend for
dialog: this to be thought of as a handout
dialog: or a payout. But I did hope it would
dialog: serve as a steppingstone for our two
dialog: communities to come together. Have a
dialog: good night.
text: walks out the front door.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: You're so proud that you won't let
dialog: me accept it.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You have done nothing to deserve it.
dialog: It's a publicity stunt.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It is not a publicity stunt. It is
text: returning an act of kindness with an
dialog: act of kindness.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Dad, the rabbi is the nicest man in
dialog: the world.
text: at Pete furiously.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You have a big mouth. You tell the
dialog: rabbi that we don't have enough food
dialog: to eat? Maybe he'll set up a food
dialog: drive for our family?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I never said that. We talk a lot.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I thought I told you to leave those
dialog: people alone?
text: Pete stays quiet.
dialog: Pete puts
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You've been going to the temple?
text: his head down.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You disobeyed my orders.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I was on a quest. To get Danny to
dialog: heaven. And we're almost there.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: On a quest for heaven? By disobeying
dialog: me, all you have done is put yourself
dialog: on the road to hell. Go to your room
dialog: and don't come out 'till I tell you
dialog: to.
text: Pete starts to cry.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Joe!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I was just trying to do the right
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (To Margaret)
dialog: He disobeyed my word.
dialog: (To Pete)
dialog: The right thing? You're not even
dialog: eight. You don't know what the right
dialog: thing is. You know what I tell you,
dialog: and what your mother tells you. Jewish
dialog: people believe in their own thing.
dialog: They do not go to heaven. And neither
dialog: do Christians who disobey their
dialog: fathers. Now get upstairs. Now!
text: Pete walks up the stairs. Joe walks into the kitchen and
text: grabs a beer. Patrick follows him.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I'm going to see the rabbi myself
dialog: and work out a deal.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Over my dead body. Do you understand
dialog: it's not about you? It's not about
dialog: kindness. It's about good publicity.
dialog: The Jews help out a poor Irish
dialog: Catholic family and they get on the
dialog: news and the people think, how nice
dialog: is it that the Jews share their money.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Why are you so cynical? You're too
dialog: proud to take a handout?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Too proud? Maybe a little pride
dialog: wouldn't hurt you. Instead of sitting
dialog: there with your hand out, maybe if
dialog: you took pride in a little hard work,
dialog: you'd understand.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: There you go again. I work hard. My
dialog: dad worked hard. You will work hard.
dialog: I will work hard. At school. To get
dialog: a good job.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Bullshit! We are not discussing this
dialog: anymore tonight. I didn't spend my
dialog: day at the beach. I'm tired!
dialog: 
text: Patrick begins to speak. Joe gets in his face and puts his
text: finger in Patrick's face.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No more! No more!
text: Patrick storms out of the kitchen. He stops to look at his
text: mother, who holds Molly in her arms.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: How can you just stand there? You're
dialog: married to an asshole and you just
dialog: stand there like this innocent
dialog: bystander.
text: Joe rushes into the living room.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You will not speak to your mother
dialog: like that. Get the hell out of my
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Your house? Who wants your house? Or
dialog: your bullshit rules.
text: Joe holds his ground though he wants to whack Patrick. Patrick
text: walks out the front door. Seamus still sits at the table
text: eating pastries.
text: Joe walks out of the living room. Margaret, with tears
text: beginning to form in her eyes, looks at Seamus. Seamus shrugs
text: his shoulders, takes a bite of his pastry, and stands up. He
text: puts his arms out to take Molly from her arms.
speaker_heading: SEAMUS:
dialog: Mom. You know how after you send me
dialog: to my room, you come into my bedroom
dialog: and we talk? I think Dad needs you

scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Honey, I know what you're going to
dialog: say. And my decision about the
dialog: scholarship is final.
text: Margaret stares at the sunset.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You know, when Father Murphy married
dialog: us...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Don't start with this crap.
text: Margaret stops.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Father Murphy said...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Father Murphy was an idiot.
text: Margaret grabs the beer right out of Joe's hand. She throws
text: it against the fence.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I have got something to say and you
dialog: will not interrupt me until I am
dialog: finished.
text: Joe shrugs but realizes this isn't the time to fight her.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: We agreed on a partnership. And our
dialog: partnership has been for you to
dialog: provide for the family while I raise
dialog: the family. But somewhere along the
dialog: line, this partnership has gotten
dialog: out of whack. You come home, the
dialog: house is clean, your food is hot,
dialog: and your kids are behaved. You then
dialog: bark orders at these children like a
dialog: drill sergeant.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Cause they need discipline.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I am not finished. Trust me, these
dialog: kids are disciplined. You think I
dialog: run this house without discipline?
dialog: Joseph, the older ones, they need
dialog: more guidance than sterness. We've
dialog: done our work with them, they now
dialog: need to feel they can bounce things
dialog: off us.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That's a bunch of crap. You think I
dialog: bounced things off my dad? Hell no.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You hated your dad growing up.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah, he was an asshole, but I
dialog: respected him. And looking back, he
dialog: did a great job.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
text: But looking back is too late. It
dialog: would be nice for Patrick to feel
dialog: close enough to you so that he could
dialog: tell you his dreams, tell you that
dialog: even though he doesn't want to grow
dialog: up to be you, that you are still his
dialog: hero.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That's bullshit.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Everything is not bullshit. I will
dialog: not allow you to take away the chance
dialog: for Patrick to pursue his dream. The
dialog: rabbi is being generous and you think
dialog: it reflects poorly on you.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That's not...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes it is. You can't afford to put
dialog: your children through college, so
dialog: you've decided that college is bad.
dialog: You know what, I agree college is a
dialog: waste of time for most kids. But not
dialog: Patrick. He wasted his first few
dialog: years of high school, but the last
dialog: two years he has worked his butt off
dialog: and he generally loves to learn.
dialog: That's what college is all about.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: How do you know what college is about?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Just because I didn't go doesn't
dialog: mean I didn't think about it. But I
dialog: fell in love, had babies, and haven't
dialog: regretted one thing about the last
dialog: nineteen years. Until now! You will
dialog: not squash your children's dreams
dialog: because they aren't your dreams.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It's not about dreams, it's about
dialog: what's right. If Patrick really wanted
dialog: college, he could have gotten better
dialog: grades and earned a scholarship.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: He didn't take school seriously.
dialog: Why? Cause he thought it was a waste
dialog: of time because he would work for
dialog: the city whether he got A's or C's.
dialog: But one day he woke up and decided
dialog: that not doing his best was not the
dialog: O'Malley way. And he learned that
dialog: from his father. And he's got nothing
dialog: but A's that day forward. And he
dialog: will do the same in college. From a
dialog: scholarship that he accepts from
dialog: Rabbi Jacobsen, or so help me God,
dialog: Joe, the only thing colder than your
dialog: food when you get home will be your
dialog: bed.

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: He's earned the right. He passed the
dialog: tests.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: What tests?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Tests we made up to see if he's worthy
dialog: of Jesus. And he is Father Kelly,
dialog: he's as worthy as any Catholic I
dialog: know. And just because he's not old
dialog: enough, well that's not fair, because
dialog: he may not live long enough to be

dialog: still have to listen to them.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: But they're wrong.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: They're not wrong. They're just
dialog: teaching one way to get to heaven.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Sister Leonora Mary says there is
dialog: only one way.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well then, you and I will have to
dialog: keep a secret from Sister Leonora
dialog: Mary.
text: Pete laughs. The dogs brings back the ball and drops it at
text: Pete's feet.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SYNAGOGUE - LATER
text: Joe and Pete enter the synagogue. Rabbi Jacobsen stands at
text: the pulpit and he is speaking to a quarter full audience.
text: Pete grabs a yarmukle and puts it on his head. He looks at
dialog: his dad to do the same thing.
text: His dad, reluctantly, puts on a yarmukle. The two take a
text: seat in the back row. The rabbi finishes speaking and the
text: people disperse. Pete waits for them all to pass the last
text: row when he stands up. Rabbi Jacobsen has his back to Pete
text: as he gives instructions to his assistant. Pete heads toward
text: the altar as Joe stays in the pew.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Rabbi Jacobsen.
text: The rabbi turns. He smiles at Pete. He notices Joe in the
text: back and waves to him. Joe gestures back.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: You cleaned up well from your game.
dialog: What can I do for you?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Do you have a moment to talk?
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You know how I had my quest to get a
dialog: Jewish person to heaven?
text: The rabbi nods.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Did you realize that my quest is
dialog: just like your quest as a rabbi,
dialog: it's just that I called mine a quest
dialog: and you call yours a job.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: I didn't realize that but it seems
dialog: to be true.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Well, my quest ended with Danny.
text: The rabbi nods.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: But your quest never ends cause it's
dialog: your job.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: I think you're right.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Well I learned something on my quest
dialog: that might help you on your quest.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: What did you learn?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I learned that just saying you believe
dialog: or just praying to Jesus isn't how
dialog: you get to heaven.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Nope. Jesus is only a symbol, like a
dialog: letter or a number. You could really
dialog: use anyone's name just so long that
dialog: the person's name symbolized being
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: That is interesting.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah. I thought you might think so.
dialog: My dad says I better stick to praying
dialog: and acting like Jesus because the
dialog: nuns wouldn't understand as well as
dialog: you and him do.
text: The rabbi looks up and smiles at Joe. Joe waves back.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: But, my dad and I think if the Jewish
dialog: people don't want to copy the
dialog: Christians by praying to Jesus, you
dialog: guys can make up your own name to
dialog: pray to.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Do you have a suggestion for a name
dialog: that I can bring to my congregation?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Danny.
text: The rabbi's eyes fill with tears and he puts his arms out
dialog: for Pete.
text: Pete hugs him. And the rabbi squeezes tight. Pete lets go.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I thought that might help you in
dialog: your job. On your quest.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: Thank you. It will.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I'll see you later.
text: Pete turns and walks toward his dad, who stands at the back
text: of the temple. Pete turns back to the rabbi.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I almost forgot to tell you the most
dialog: important thing.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: That Danny is in heaven.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Faith.
text: Pete smiles and turns around. He walks to his dad and Pete
text: and his dad walk out of the temple together.
speaker_heading: THE END
