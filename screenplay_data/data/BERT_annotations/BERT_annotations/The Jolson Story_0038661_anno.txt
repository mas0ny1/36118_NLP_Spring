dialog: Asa
dialog: Oh, I've thought about that. I mean, I could sing much better
text: on the stage.
dialog: Steve
dialog: You don't tell me!
dialog: Asa
dialog: Yes, because then I could sing right to 'em instead of the backs

dialog: Faces?

speaker_heading: DOCKSTADER
dialog: You see, I've seen Baron work before. Hammerstein hasn't.

dialog: Oh, you mean the job calls for a singer?
dialog: Steve
dialog: What are you talkin' about? What did you think?
dialog: Jolson
dialog: (to Dockstader)
dialog: Oh, then I wouldn't be interested. See, I like whistling.
dialog: Steve and I argue about that all the time. He -- he keeps
dialog: wanting me to sing, but at heart I'm just a whistler. Only
dialog: thing that makes me happy.

dialog: it's fast and happy. But they tell me it won't go, Papa. It's
dialog: never been done. In fact I'll tell you a secret. They say your

dialog: Papa
dialog: Well, Mama, our son is a little crazy. But what can we do? He
dialog: is our boy. We have got to love him. But about crazy people,

text: like a family. Like some girl.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: Don't worry, pal. There's always been a girl. Look, when do we
dialog: play Washington?
dialog: Steve
dialog: Two weeks.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: The night we open there, let's make it a real celebration. Get

dialog: hours. Of course, I shouldn't be rushing you like this. You'll
dialog: think I'm kidding. But look. Y'see, I've been waiting for
dialog: something for a long time. I didn't know what it was. Steve's
dialog: been trying to tell me, it was about -- well, about getting
dialog: everything and nothing out of life. I didn't know what he was
dialog: talking about, and then I saw you. Yes sir, then I saw you! --
dialog: Look, got a great idea. Suppose you and I got married and went
dialog: to California together? How about it?
dialog: Julie
dialog: Well, of course, I'm rehearsing "Show Girl" and we open in two
dialog: weeks.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: Ah, yeah. That's too bad. If it just wasn't for that, huh?

dialog: whole life, too. But I don't think it'll ever be mine.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: Why, it's gonna say "Julie Benson" down there in great big
dialog: lights. Do you mean to say you don't want that?
dialog: Julie
dialog: Oh, yes, I want that. I'm just normal enough to want that.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: Sure. You're just a little scared now. Wait'll you get some
dialog: confidence! You'll begin to love it, begin to feel it in your
dialog: blood!
dialog: Julie
dialog: That's the big difference.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: What's the big difference?
dialog: Julie
dialog: It was in your blood when you were born. But I'm just a pretty
dialog: good hoofer, and I got a lucky break. All I know is, I -- I
dialog: want a lot besides this.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: Like what, Julie? Gotta know.
dialog: Julie
dialog: Well, in the first place, like -- like a real home.

dialog: Sure, everybody wants a home.
dialog: Julie
dialog: Nah, you wouldn't care for the kind I'm thinking of.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: Why not? Why wouldn't I?
dialog: Julie
dialog: It would have to be far enough away -- maybe way out in the
dialog: country -- so that by the time you got there, and closed the
dialog: door, you'd have forgotten all about show business.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: It's funny. All of a sudden that's what I've always wanted, to

dialog: No waits, no delays in the life of the Jolsons.
dialog: Steve
dialog: Just a matter of putting your foot down once.
dialog: Julie
dialog: He'll know the right time, Steve. He's happy, so am I.
dialog: (taps his tummy)
dialog: And it's not nice to put your foot down.
dialog: (pinches his cheek)

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Julie, remember those plans you had for that house in the east?
dialog: Julie
dialog: (stopping)
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: Steve
dialog: Well, I just happened to think of that the other day. Why don't
dialog: you find a piece of land out in the country around here, over in
dialog: the Valley, for instance, and get the thing built? You'd get a
dialog: big kick out of that, wouldn't you?
dialog: Julie
dialog: (turning back)
dialog: Oh, I don't know, Steve. That was just a romantic idea I once
dialog: had. What's wrong with this house? It's got marble, even.
dialog: (pats his shoulder)
dialog: Good night, Steve. I'm absolutely dead.

dialog: Well, what do you know? A big Jolson preview and no mob waiting
dialog: at home!
dialog: Jolson
dialog: What do you suppose happened?
dialog: Julie
dialog: Well, it -- it could be me.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: It could be you?
dialog: Julie
dialog: Well, I told Henry to tell any callers that we went straight
dialog: from the theater to Santa Barbara for the weekend. Suppose that
dialog: did it?
dialog: Jolson
dialog: You're kidding.
text: The doorbell rings.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Shh!

text: They hear the front door close.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Simple.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: Sweetheart, that's cute.
dialog: Julie
dialog: Should have thought of it a long time ago. You don't really
dialog: mind, do you, Al?
dialog: Jolson
dialog: Mind?
dialog: Julie
dialog: You see, tonight's a different night. The last picture's
dialog: finished. We're free. Not a contract in the world.
dialog: Steve
dialog: The governor sent the pardon.
dialog: Julie
dialog: That's right. So I thought a quiet evening around the fire,
dialog: discussing plans for the future.
dialog: (takes their arms)
dialog: Look, sandwiches, coffee...
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: SHE WALKS THEM FURTHER INTO THE ROOM.
speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Have some coffee, Steve?
dialog: Steve
dialog: Thanks, Julie. I believe I will.
text: Jolson walks up to her as she pours a cup for Steve.
speaker_heading: JOLSON
dialog: Y'know, honey, you sound like a gal with a program all figured
dialog: out.
dialog: Julie
dialog: Uh-hmm. First we shake this town for points east. Maybe
dialog: farther east than that -- across the Atlantic, who knows? --
dialog: Cream for you, Steve.
dialog: (she adds cream to
dialog: his cup)
dialog: And when that's out of our system, there's a little matter of
dialog: building that house.
text: DOLLY BACK as Jolson sits on a couch across from Steve. Julie hands Steve
text: his coffee and starts to pour a cup for herself.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: That I gotta see if I never see another house in the world.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: Y'know, I kinda got a hankerin' to see it myself.
dialog: Julie
dialog: I'm glad to hear that, because I can have it up in no time. I
dialog: know every room in the place. I've even got it furnished. Just
dialog: one thing: in our travels to find the right place to put that
dialog: house.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: You, uh -- you don't mean the east, do ya, baby?
text: She almost responds but hesitates.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: That was the original idea. Why change it?
dialog: Jolson
dialog: We've gotten used to this country out here. I like it. I don't
dialog: know, it feels more like home than any place in the world. And
dialog: it doesn't matter too much to you, does it, sweetheart?
dialog: Julie
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: No, not really. And if it does to you, Al...
dialog: Jolson
dialog: Well, don't put it that way, honey. There's nothing so special
dialog: you want in the east, is there?
dialog: Julie
dialog: Well, no. That's true. That settles it. It's going to be
dialog: here.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: Wonderful.
dialog: Julie
dialog: (to Steve)
dialog: And you keep quiet.
text: Jolson sits on the couch again. Julie sits beside him.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Only, Al... we could get out in the country a little way,
dialog: couldn't we?
dialog: Jolson
dialog: Sure, why not?
dialog: Julie
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (kisses his cheek)
dialog: That's all I wanted.
dialog: Steve
text: With no number on the house and a couple of vicious dogs in the
dialog: yard, you can keep the callers down to practically nothing.
text: Jolson laughs.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well, this is Friday. What about train tickets out of here,
dialog: say, Sunday?
dialog: Julie
dialog: I can be ready tomorrow, but Sunday will have to do.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: Hey, what's the rush? Let's give ourselves a little time.
dialog: Let's say a week or so.
dialog: Julie
dialog: What will we want with a week or so?
dialog: Jolson
dialog: No kidding. A week would wrap up everything fine for me.
dialog: Julie
dialog: What have you got to wrap up?
dialog: Steve
dialog: (rising)
dialog: Nothing. He just thinks he has. Nothing important at all.
dialog: (to Jolson, quickly)
dialog: Have a cup of coffee, Al. It's great.
dialog: Julie
dialog: Look, boys, is something cooking?
dialog: Steve
dialog: No, there's nothing cooking.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: No, Baby, it was just an idea, that's all. There's a
dialog: proposition come at us about putting a company together and
dialog: making our own pictures. And --
text: Steve, looking over Julie's shoulder, waves to Jolson to be quiet.
speaker_heading: JOLSON
dialog: (adding quickly)
dialog: Oh, nothing definite, just talking about it. Of course, in a
dialog: week or so, it could gel. It might be a pretty exciting thing
dialog: to come back to. And, well -- that's all it was.
dialog: Julie
dialog: (holding his arm)
dialog: Sorry, darling. No gelling. First thing you know, you've set a
dialog: date to make a picture. Then we'll have to travel with one eye
dialog: on the calendar --
dialog: Jolson
dialog: I promise you, baby.
dialog: Julie
dialog: Or something just as bad: talking about a picture all the time
dialog: we're gone.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: No, sir. Not a peep. Give you my word.
dialog: Julie
dialog: Fine, darling. But -- well, I know this is silly, but it's --
dialog: it's gotten to be a sort of principle. Once we do say we're
dialog: going to quit for a while --
dialog: Jolson
dialog: Oh, who said we weren't?
dialog: Julie
dialog: Well, then whatever this proposition is, it'll still be there in
dialog: three months, or six months --
dialog: Steve
dialog: And just as hot, so why bother now? Why don't you lay off, Al?
dialog: Jolson
dialog: (paces away)
dialog: Wow! What a beating I'm taking here!
dialog: (turns back)
dialog: But look, honey. Remember me? This is Jolson. I go with the
dialog: principle every time. But all I'm talking about is a couple of
dialog: days!
dialog: Julie
dialog: But when you want to spend them that way, Al, that's where the
dialog: principle is! It isn't the days.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: Julie (cont'd)
dialog: It doesn't have anything to do with time.
dialog: (crying)
dialog: If you can't see that, Al, I wouldn't know how to --
dialog: (wipes her eyes)
dialog: Holy smoke, this is a kid stunt, isn't it?

dialog: Steve

scene_heading: INT. JULIE'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
text: SHE SITS IN FRONT OF A MIRROR CRYING. IN THE MIRROR WE SEE JOLSON OPENING
text: THE DOOR BEHIND HER AND ENTERING. HE TAKES A FEW STEPS TOWARD HER.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Al, you're going to hate to stop work and go away, aren't you?
dialog: Jolson
dialog: No, baby.
dialog: Julie
dialog: It's going to be awfully tough, isn't it? Not singing always
dialog: is. And here I am asking you to go away without any plans,
text: without even any work to come back to.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: Honest, it doesn't matter that much, baby. You know how it is
text: when an old fire horse hears the bell.
dialog: Julie
dialog: I didn't say it was your fault.
dialog: (rises and faces him)
dialog: That's not what I'm trying to say. What we've got to discuss is
dialog: you and me.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: Julie --
dialog: Julie
dialog: Please, Al, just listen hard for once, will you?
dialog: (she turns away)
dialog: You see, I'm like somebody with one desperate chance left. I
dialog: couldn't go on this way if I wanted to. That means you'd have
dialog: to change. You'd have to get off this merry-go-round and quit
dialog: for once, for a long time. And I know you'd make promises and
dialog: try to keep them. But I'd know how you felt. And I couldn't
dialog: have any happiness out of wishing the tiniest misery on you. So
dialog: you see, Al, any way you look at it, there's got to be misery
dialog: for both of us. And the way we feel about each other, and
dialog: rather than let that die a slow, painful death, I think we ought
dialog: to have the courage to quit now.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: That's the one thing that can't happen, baby.
dialog: Julie
dialog: (turns to him)
dialog: Be honest, Al.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: I never understood a thing.
text: She walks past him. He speaks to her from behind.
speaker_heading: JOLSON
dialog: Look, Julie. You've heard of fellas who hit the bottle and wind
dialog: up hopeless drunks. Well, whatever drives me that way and won't
dialog: let me understand, it's the same thing. I've been like a fella
dialog: who's been drunk all his life. And you know, a guy like that'll
dialog: get so bad he'll pass up the thing he wants more than anything
dialog: else in the world.
dialog: Julie
dialog: You don't have to tell me how you feel about me, Al. I know
dialog: that.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: No, listen, baby. I do have to tell you because, listen. I've
dialog: been kicked around in my time. I thought I could take anything.
dialog: But having you say you want to quit because -- Well, look,
dialog: baby. If it means losing you, it isn't even a contest. I don't
dialog: want any part of any more contracts, or shows, or any singing in
dialog: the world.
dialog: Julie
dialog: Al, you can't make me a gift of your whole life. I just
dialog: couldn't take it.
dialog: Jolson
dialog: No, look, baby. It's given you nothing, except this show
dialog: business, and that's cheated me all my life. It stands to cheat
dialog: me right now, because I know what would happen. I'd just go on
dialog: the same way, working my head off, living everybody's life but
dialog: my own, and at the same time lose the only thing I was lucky to
dialog: get out of it. I know what you're thinking, baby. I'm kidding
dialog: myself and don't know it. Well, maybe yes. I -- I don't know.
dialog: When you've been like I have all my life like a drunk, you can't
dialog: quit all of a sudden. Sometimes you crave the stuff.
text: DOLLY IN closer as he turns her around.
speaker_heading: JOLSON
dialog: But I am sober now, baby. And I want you to help me. If I
dialog: start yelling, hit me over the head, tie me down. Because when
dialog: you go, baby, I got nothing left. So be a pal, Julie. Do what
dialog: I ask you.

dialog: Yeah, that's right. Go ahead.

dialog: Well, that's right. Naturally --
dialog: Jolson
dialog: Well, you wasted a trip, Tom. You can turn around and go back.

text: Julie looks on alarmed.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Al, wait a second!
dialog: Jolson
dialog: I've quit. I've worked enough. Yes, and for you in my time,

dialog: Julie
dialog: Al, what's the matter with you?!
text: Jolson catches himself.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: You happen to be wrong, Al. You see, to cast a Broadway show

dialog: Baron
dialog: No, I really --
dialog: Julie
dialog: That's settled. And tomorrow night you will attend the wedding

dialog: Jolson
