scene_heading: EXT. LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH  DAY
text: Our attention is concentrated on a sign reading: "THIS IS
text: WHERE IT IS  PARALLEL 38." Below these words, arrows point
text: to "NORTH KOREA" in one direction, "SOUTH KOREA" in opposite
text: one. Two Air Rescue helicopters are coming in low from the
text: north, descending to a point just outside the entrance to
dialog: the hospital Admitting Ward.
text: Transferring our attention to the helicopters, our gaze goes
dialog: from the first sign to a second one, on which all we can
text: read at first are the very large letters: "M-A-S-H." Moving
text: closer to the helicopters as they hit the ground, we can
text: make out the rest of the sign. Above the four large letters
text: it says: "4077TH," and then we see there is the remainder of
text: a word following each of the large letters, but in much
text: smaller print, so that "M-A-S-H" becomes "Mobile Army Surgical
text: Hospital." The helicopters land and enlisted men of the U.S.
text: Army Medical Corps Carry two wounded soldiers from each into
dialog: the Admitting Ward.
text: LIEUTENANT COLONEL HENRY BLAKE, a permanent member of the
text: Medical Corps and Commanding Officer of the 4077th, watches
text: grimly as the wounded are borne from the helicopters into
text: his hospital. CORPORAL "RADAR" O'REILLY, with a long thin
text: neck, large ears and a knack for anticipating his Colonel's
text: wishes, moves up close behind him.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: O'Reilly!
speaker_heading: RADAR
dialog: (at his side)
dialog: Yes, sir?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you!
dialog: Tell Major Burns...
speaker_heading: RADAR
dialog: One of the surgeons from the day
dialog: shift will have to stay on duty
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Yes, dammit, and...
text: He interrupts himself, frightened by the intense expression
text: on Radar's face. The Corporal's head is turning back and
text: forth like an actual radar receiver, monitoring the northern
text: horizon where the valley of a river meanders between
text: mountainous ridges.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: O'Reilly, what is it?
dialog: (appalled at the
dialog: thought)
dialog: There aren't more choppers coming?
speaker_heading: RADAR
dialog: I'm afraid so, Colonel.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: We've got too many wounded for us to
dialog: handle now! Get on the phone right
dialog: away and...
speaker_heading: RADAR
dialog: Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach
dialog: General Hammond in Seoul for you.
dialog: You think he'll finally break down
dialog: and give us two more surgeons?
text: The DISTANT SOUND of more HELICOPTERS becomes faintly audible
text: to the normal human ear, and a moment later one appears over
text: a ridge.

scene_heading: EXT. MOTOR POOL AND RAILROAD DEPOT  325TH EVACUATION
scene_heading: HOSPITAL  YONG-DONG-PA  DAY
text: Two officers come from opposite directions toward a Jeep,
text: each carrying a Valpac and trailing a barracks bag. Though
text: they still wear such later-to-be-discarded refinements as
text: captain's bars on their caps and overcoats, they are far
text: from West Point standards in dress and manner. DUKE, 29, is
text: still solidly built like the fullback he once was. HAWKEYE,
text: 28, a former end, is taller and rangier, wears glasses. Their
text: accents, Georgia and Maine respectively, are in sharp
text: contrast. A MOTOR POOL SARGEANT who has driven the Jeep up
text: climbs out.
scene_heading: MOTOR POOL DRIVER
dialog: You the guys going to the 4077th?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I'm one of 'em.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (state of Maine
dialog: affirmative)
dialog: Ayuh. I'm the other then.
text: As they stow their gear in the back of the Jeep.
scene_heading: MOTOR POOL SARGEANT
dialog: Lots of luck.
text: He leaves.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Duke Forrest.
text: Hawkeye takes the driver's seat. Duke, getting into the right-
text: hand side, has no objection, just a question.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You got directions?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink
dialog: to wake me up.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I got some.
text: He turns around and opens his barracks bag, where he finds a
text: pint bottle conveniently located near the top.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Make it yourself, or is it real?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Georgia, where I come from, it's
dialog: real if you make it yourself. But I
dialog: been buying from the Yankee Government
dialog: since they put me in this soldier
dialog: suit and give me a rate.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Tax-free booze. It's about all you
dialog: can say for army life.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (passing bottle)
dialog: Where you from with that crazy way
dialog: of talking?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: Crabapple Cove. Maine.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Damn! That must be about as far north
dialog: as you can get.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Pretty near. What do you know about
dialog: the outfit we're going to?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant
dialog: Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of
dialog: them regular army clowns. Push you
dialog: around so it's hard to get any decent
dialog: work done.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: We got to head them off, right at
text: the start. Push them around first.
text: They have exchanged the bottle a couple of times. In the act
text: of raising it to his mouth, Hawkeye looks toward the hospital
dialog: doorway.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: I think we already caught their eye.
text: Two MPs have emerged from the hospital administration offices
text: and are heading toward them. Hawkeye goes into action quickly,
text: starting the Jeep engine.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: What's the initials 'MP' stand for,
dialog: Hawkeye?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
text: The Jeep starts off at its maximum takeoff speed and
text: accelerates dangerously as it careens out of the hospital
dialog: grounds.
speaker_heading: TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD NEAR OUIJONGBU  DAY
text: Hawkeye and Duke are driving the Jeep along the muddy road 
text: they come upon a sign which fills a large part of the screen:
text: "Last chance before Peking". A short distance behind the
text: sign, it is now revealed are three parked U.S. Army trucks,
text: in front of which parades a group of Korean prostitutes from
text: fourteen to forty-five.
text: Despite the autumn weather, their costumes, mixed American
dialog: mail order and Korean, are chosen for seductive appeal rather
dialog: than warmth.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore
dialog: 
dialog: (pronounced 'howah')
dialog: House. You in the market Duke?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (in negation)
dialog: I done my shopping in Seoul last
dialog: night.
text: They now have a fairly clear view of a GI and a Korean female
text: lying in tight formation in the bed on one of the trucks,
text: their activity only partially concealed by a blanket.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Curb service is right.
speaker_heading: TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: EXT. APPROACH TO 4077TH MASH  DAY
text: Hawkeye stops the Jeep as they come to a place in the road
text: where they can get a downward look at their future home. The
text: river valley in which the 4077th Mash is situated is almost
text: surrounded by mountains. The components of the post are spread
text: out in a rough horseshoe with a large compound of level ground
text: in the middle. At the closed end of the horseshoe is the
text: main hospital building, made of wood with a tin roof marked
text: by a large red cross; everything else is canvas. To the left
text: of the main building are strung out the Admitting Ward,
text: Laboratory, Dental Clinic, Mess Hall, PX, Showers Tent, Barber
text: Tent and the Enlisted Men's Tents. On the right side are the
dialog: Postop Ward, Officers' Tents, Nurses' Tents, Korean Domestics'
text: Tents and finally, the Officers' Club. In the f.g., from
text: Duke and Hawkeye's angle are four helicopters belonging to
dialog: the 5th Air Rescue Squadron, and the signs we have already
text: seen marking the post and the 38th Parallel.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Well, there it is. Jesus!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: The spot we picked to spend the
dialog: winter. Maybe we ought to look a
dialog: little harder.
speaker_heading: BRIEF TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: INT. MASH MESS HALL  DAY
text: As Hawkeye and Duke enter. The large tent has two floor levels
text: separated by a railing into a section for officers and one
dialog: for enlisted men, the two groups being much closer to
dialog: numerical equality here than in an ordinary military
text: installation. There is a further voluntary piece of
dialog: segregation within the officers' section: the men  medical
text: officers plus a couple of administrative officers and a
text: helicopter pilot  are at one long, rectangular table; the
dialog: nurses, ranging in rank from second lieutenant to captain,
dialog: at another.
text: Hawkeye starts to lead the way to an empty table in the
text: officers' section, but Duke calls his attention to the
text: outstanding feature of the nurses' table: LIEUTENANT DISH,
text: 24, blonde and clearly, even in her winter fatigues, the
dialog: sexiest looking nurse in military history.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: What do you think of that piece of
dialog: scenery, Yankee boy?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Finest kind. We'll sit where we can
dialog: get the best view.
text: Accordingly, they select seats close to the nurses and facing
text: the Lieutenant. Some personnel are on duty in the hospital
text: during this lunch period, but beside Dish, two of the
dialog: following three nurses with whom we will become acquainted
dialog: are present here:
text: KNOCKO, who is black, a captain in her thirties, solidly
text: built, very strong and very competent in her job; LESLIE,
text: also a captain, not more than thirty, bright, attractive,
text: cheerful, the kind of girl that brings out the latent male
text: matrimonial instinct but who, strangely, is treated as
dialog: inviolate by the by the sex-starved men of the post; and
text: LIEUTENANT SCORCH, who can't match Dish or Leslie by physical
dialog: standards but has the asset of instant availability.
text: A Korean boy, not yet of military age, in green fatigue pants
text: and an off-white coat, appears promptly and heaps Duke and
text: Hawkeye's plates with food. Duke is hungry enough to turn
text: his whole attention to the meal, but Hawkeye is unable to
text: keep his eyes off Lieutenant Dish while eating. Thus neither
text: of them is aware of the attention they are getting from the
text: male officers' group, which includes HENRY, a couple of
text: medical captains named MURRHARDT and BANDINI; DAGO RED
dialog: (officially, Father John Patrick Mulcahy, red-haired Catholic
dialog: Chaplain of the area) and the PAINLESS POLE (Captain Walter
text: Zaldowski, Dental Officer), both in their thirties; and
scene_heading: CAPTAIN UGLY JOHN BLACK, an Australian anesthesiologist.
text: There is also curiosity about the newcomers from the unlisted
text: men's section, where we see among others RADAR; VOLLMER,
text: Henry's overweight Sargeant Major; CORPORAL JUDSON, young,
text: black and fresh from Mississippi; PRIVATE BOONE, who looks
dialog: too young and nervous to be in any man's army; and PFC
text: SEIDMAN, whose first trip out of New York has taken him
text: halfway around the world.
text: Henry, who alone has reason to be personally affronted by
text: Duke and Hawkeye's unmilitary behavior, gets up and crosses
text: to where they are sitting.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just
dialog: passing through?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Nope, we're assigned heah.
dialog: With which reminder we will abandon all indications of the
dialog: Maine accent.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Y'all were short a couple cutters
dialog: and we're what the Army sent.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Don't you know the first thing you're
dialog: supposed to do at a new post is
dialog: present yourself to the commanding
dialog: officer with your orders?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Reckon so, but we been boozing all
dialog: day and you work up an appetite.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (taking out orders
dialog: and handing Duke a
dialog: copy)
dialog: You're welcome to one of these,
dialog: whatever they are.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (finding his orders)
dialog: They give you copies to burn.
text: Henry scans both papers to find what he considers the most
text: important part. There is a RUMBLE OF ARTILLERY in the
dialog: distance.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Good. You've both been working close
text: to the front.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (listening to artillery)
dialog: Never this close.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I
dialog: just got word. We have our slack
text: periods but when the action starts,
dialog: you'll have more work in twelve hours
dialog: than a civilian surgeon does in a
dialog: week.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye
dialog: and Duke are here.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (to Henry)
dialog: That's right, pal. You just sit up
dialog: front and sign the mail, and leave
dialog: the cutting to us.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I may need you to go to work
text: practically immediately. But meanwhile
dialog: perhaps you'd like to meet some of
dialog: your fellow officers.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Just one for a start.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: The blonde dish.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: If you mean...
dialog: (looking toward
dialog: Lieutenant Dish)
dialog: She is a lieutenant in the Army
dialog: Nursing Corps, Captain.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's
dialog: already... involved with somebody
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: They've all tried. Nobody's got to
dialog: first base.
text: He is interrupted by the fact that Dish and Knocko have risen
text: from their table and are passing right by them on their way
text: to the door.
dialog: The Lieutenant has just as nice a walk as you would hope
text: for, and the men's eyes follow her till she is again out of
dialog: hearing distance.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Why bother with first base? I'd go
dialog: right for the home run.
text: The Painless Pole and Dago Red have come over.
speaker_heading: DAGO RED
dialog: This the new talent, Henry?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Captain Pierce, Captain Forrest...
dialog: Father Mulcahy, the Catholic Chaplain
dialog: of the area, and Captain Waldowski,
dialog: our Dental Officer.
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
dialog: Better known as Painless Pole.
text: Murrhardt and Bandini come over and all ADLIB introductions
dialog:  asking each other their backgrounds, etc.
speaker_heading: BANDINI
dialog: We all call him Dago Red.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I'm Duke and he's Hawkeye.
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
dialog: Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic
dialog: anytime you feel like playing a little
dialog: poker, or even if a tooth is bothering
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Poker sounds great. When do you play?
speaker_heading: MURRHARDT
dialog: He said anytime. Day and night, seven
dialog: days a week. The players change but
text: the game never stops.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (to Hawkeye and Duke)
dialog: You'll be living with Major Burns.
dialog: O'Reilly!
text: Before his name is uttered, Radar has already risen from the
text: enlisted men's group, and is now at Henry's side.
speaker_heading: RADAR
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Don't do that, Radar! You make me
dialog: nervous.
speaker_heading: RADAR
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Don't come so quickly when I call. I
dialog: want you to take these officers...
speaker_heading: RADAR
dialog: To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Stop that, O'Rielly!
speaker_heading: RADAR
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Oh, get out of here!
speaker_heading: RADAR
dialog: Yes, Colonel.
speaker_heading: BRIEF TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: EXT. / INT. "THE SWAMP" (PRESENTLY FRANK'S TENT)  DAY
text: Hawkeye and Duke drag their bags from the Jeep, which Radar
text: drives away. They look over their new residence, a standard
text: army tent, square with peaked roof, a wooden door attached
text: to the canvas. Then as they approach it, they become aware
text: of a youthful Korean voice reading, in heavily accented
text: English, words that have no meaning for the speaker.
speaker_heading: HO-JON'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: 'Yea, though I walk through the valley
dialog: of the shadow of death... '
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Jesus Christ!
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: One of his ancestors, I think.
speaker_heading: HO-JON'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: 'I shall fear no evil for Thou art
dialog: with me...'
text: They open the door of the tent and go in. There are three
text: canvas cots with sleeping bags on them, a plank floor, an
text: oil stove, electric light, a few crude shelves, one table
text: and one chair plus assorted crates serving as same.
text: MAJOR FRANK BURNS, 35, from Wisconsin, is sitting on one of
text: the two more favorably situated cots listening to HO-JON, a
text: Korean boy of 16, read from the Bible. He corrects the word
dialog: that has given Ho-Jon the most trouble.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Thou. For Thou art with me.
dialog: (sees Duke and Hawkeye,
dialog: jumps up)
dialog: Welcome, welcome, welcome!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: What the hell's going on here?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our
dialog: houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Where's he gonna use that kind of
dialog: talk? 'The valley of the shadow of
dialog: death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...
dialog: (rummages in barracks
dialog: bag)
dialog: I got something for you.
text: He takes out sex magazine, gives it to Ho-Jon in such a way
text: that we see the nude on the cover, but Frank doesn't.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (to Frank)
dialog: Little light reading matter. Just
dialog: right for his age.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (to Duke)
dialog: Well, southern boy, I suppose you
dialog: want the sack that's convenient to
text: the door.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: And gets the wind every time it opens.
dialog: No, thanks. I'll take that one.
text: He indicates the unoccupied cot which, like Frank's, is at
text: the rear of the tent with the stove between it and the front
text: door. Hawkeye shrugs and reaches into his barracks bag.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Let's choose for it.
dialog: (finds baseball bat,
dialog: hands it to Duke)
dialog: You toss.
text: Duke tosses the bat vertically in the air. As it comes down
text: Hawkeye grabs it expertly at the tape with his left hand.
text: Duke puts his left hand above that, and Duke is left with
text: his right hand waving in the air with nothing to grab.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (to Ho-Jon)
dialog: Part of your education. Always use
dialog: your own bat.
text: He tosses Valpac onto the desired cot.
speaker_heading: TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: INT. ADMITTING WARD  NIGHT
text: It's pretty full already and more wounded are being brought
text: in by corpsmen. In contrast to the opening scene, where the
text: casualties were a generalized fact seen at a distance, in
text: this scene they are viewed individually and at close range,
text: and the effect, both on the eye and the ear, is almost
text: unbearable. Hawkeye, in a white gown as are all the surgeons
text: and nurses, moves from a patient he has just examined to one
text: who is letting out a number of unintelligible SOUNDS mixed
text: in with such clear and frequently repeated words as "Christ,"
text: "Mother," "God damn" and "Please." As Hawkeye approaches,
text: Lieutenant Scorch removes enough of the bandaging done in
text: the field to display an abdomen with part of its contents on
dialog: the outside.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Two-man job. How much blood has he
dialog: had?
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT SCORCH
dialog: Second pint.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Duke...
text: Duke has just examined a patient. He takes a step towards
dialog: Hawkeye.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: This kid's ready but we won't know
dialog: all the damage till we get in and
dialog: see what's happened. What have you
dialog: got?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Nothing can't wait. Shall we check
dialog: it out with the Major?
text: He indicates a Major who is standing a short distance away,
text: looking like a boss but not actually doing anything. Also in
text: Admitting Ward are, Murrhardt, Lieutenant Dish, PFC Seidman,
dialog: Corporal Judson.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Naw, I already found out. The only
dialog: thing he doesn't like about being in
dialog: charge is making decisions.
speaker_heading: TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT
dialog: NOTE: All principal cast should be available for all operating
dialog: scenes.
text: There are three operations going on at once. Here all
text: personnel wear white caps and masks and it is hard to identify
dialog: individuals except that at close range we can distinguish
text: Hawkeye by his glasses and Duke by his eyes and his build.
text: They are working together with great efficiency and an
dialog: instinctive collaboration that seems to require no verbal
dialog: exchange. What we see them do, without necessarily recognizing
text: the portion of anatomy involved, is to cut out a section of
text: bowel damaged by a shell fragment, and start sewing the
text: divided ends together.
speaker_heading: TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT
text: Hawkeye and Duke are working together on the last stages of
text: a leg amputation. This time there is no doubt about the
text: surgical process we are watching; we see the almost severed
dialog: leg and the process of controlling bleeding; then the limb
text: is actually separated from its stump and handed by Duke to a
text: corpsman. Hawkeye speaks to the nurse standing behind him.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Hot pack.
text: Watching her dip the pack into a warm solution and wring it
text: out, he recognizes, despite cap and mask, that it is
text: Lieutenant Dish. His eyes linger on hers for a brief moment.
speaker_heading: TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT
text: Lieutenant Dish comes out of the Operating Room, tears in
text: her eyes, trying to control her sobs, and moves just outside
text: the circle of light from the fixture over the entrance. There,
text: no longer under observation, she lets herself cry. Hawkeye
text: comes out the door, registers surprise at the sight of her
text: just as if he hadn't followed her out. He moves to her side
text: and puts a comforting arm around her.
text: She looks up just long enough to see who it is, then buries
text: her head on his shoulder as his other arm goes around her.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six
dialog: months I've been here and there are
dialog: still times when I can't stand it. I
dialog: just go to pieces.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: There's nothing ridiculous about it.
text: (turns her face up to
dialog: his)
dialog: A kid like you...
text: She doesn't move her head from the way he has arranged it,
text: and her lips are very close to his. He kisses her and it
text: turns out, from the ardent way she responds, that's what she
dialog: wanted him to do.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: Thank you, Captain Pierce.
dialog: (her voice full of
dialog: need)
dialog: It's been so long.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: No trouble at all.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Hawkeye.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: How did you get called that?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: 'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only
dialog: book my father ever read.
text: He kisses her again and again she clings to him.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: You're getting a workout, you and
dialog: Captain Forrest, your first night.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: It isn't always this rough?
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: Oh, no. We have dull stretches every
dialog: week or so, thank God, when there's
dialog: nothing to do after midnight.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: They don't have to be dull. I mean
dialog: if you and me put our minds
dialog: together...
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: Our minds?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: For a start. I just have a hunch...
dialog: well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: You're an attractive man.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: You have a certain modest charm
dialog: yourself.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: (continuing her own
dialog: thoughts)
dialog: But I'm married.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Something else we have in common.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
text: Very happily married.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Same here.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: And absolutely determined to be
dialog: faithful to my husband. Do we have
dialog: that in common, Captain?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: It's a matter of definition. Faithful
dialog: in spirit, yes.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: I don't make the distinction. But
dialog: the sex urge is a powerful force. In
dialog: women just as much as men.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Ayuh.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: You'd think now, with only six weeks
dialog: before they ship me back home, it
dialog: would be easier. But it isn't.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Of course not.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: It's terribly hard. Sometimes the
dialog: temptation is just too much.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Then why not, as long as it wouldn't
dialog: hurt anybody...?
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: (not hearing him,
dialog: just continuing her
dialog: own thought)
dialog: But you've made me feel strong again,
dialog: Captain. Hawkeye.
dialog: (smiling, tears gone,
dialog: ready to return to
dialog: work)
dialog: You helped me pull together when I
dialog: needed it.
text: With a grateful look at him, she goes back inside. Hawkeye
text: contemplates the accomplishment she has credited him with,
text: and finds it appalling.
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT
text: Hawkeye and Duke are working across the table from each other
text: again, this time inside a man's chest, stopping a hemorrhage
text: and debriding the wound.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Now that's what I call real pretty.
dialog: We can close up here and go into his
dialog: belly.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: He can't take much more time on the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: So we got to cut him fast. I figure
dialog: from the X-ray it ain't just the
dialog: spleen. We also got to snatch his
dialog: right kidney.
scene_heading: EXT. MASH COMPOUND  MORNING
text: Wearing fatigues now, Hawkeye and Duke are making their weary
text: way from the hospital to their tent after a night's work.
text: There is an announcement coming over the post-wide public
dialog: address system, but it doesn't concern them.
scene_heading: SARGEANT VOLLMER'S VOICE

text: Hawkeye and Duke open the door and come in. Ho-Jon straightens

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: You can cut the bow.
speaker_heading: HO-JON

speaker_heading: HO-JON

speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Good, because we got a fine old

text: He is so disturbed he fails to shut the door.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Is that liquor?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: DUKE

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: So long, Ho-Jon.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You make a mean martini, kid.

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Our Father who art in Heaven Hallow'd

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: We've stuck it out for a whole week
dialog: now... Pretty girl.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: We sure don't aim to cause any
dialog: trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow

speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You don't aim to cause any trouble 
dialog: But?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: But we strongly suspect something
dialog: will happen to screw up this splendid
dialog: organization of yours if you don't
dialog: get that sky pilot out of our tent.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Your tent?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She

speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I have been in this Army a long time.
dialog: I know just what you guys are up to.
dialog: But there are limits...
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: We'll find out what they are when
dialog: you throw us out.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: That's all the commitment you're
dialog: offering me?
dialog: (to Duke)
dialog: Or do you have some more extravagant
dialog: gesture of cooperation?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: No, Hawkeye just said it all.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Except we forgot one other small
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: The chest-cutter.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Yeah, that's right.
dialog: (to Henry)
dialog: You better get us a chest-cutter
dialog: before there's trouble.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: This outfit needs somebody who can
dialog: find his way around the pulmonary
text: anatomy when the bases are loaded.
speaker_heading: DUKE
text: And it's the ninth inning.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Forget it. No Mash unit has a chest
dialog: surgeon and we aren't about to get
dialog: one. Your housing problem I'll give
dialog: some thought to in the next couple
dialog: of weeks.
text: Radar O'Reilly comes in with "Emergency" written all over
text: his expressive face. He makes a hand gesture to Henry that
text: could loosely be construed as a salute.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Yes, O'Reilly?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: How you, Radar?
speaker_heading: RADAR
text: They're running behind in the OR,
dialog: sir, and the Preop Ward is all jammed
text: up. Two choppers and three ambulances
dialog: full.
dialog: This is the most serious kind of crisis for the outfit, and
text: Henry's expression shows it.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (to Duke and Hawkeye)
dialog: You boys'll have to go to work early.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You fixing to add overtime to a twelve-
dialog: hour day? The union ain't gonna like
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: You work those kind of hours, you
dialog: got to have rest. Which you can't
text: get with somebody jabbering away on
dialog: a direct line to heaven.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (crisply)
dialog: Major Burns will be out of your tent
dialog: in twenty-four hours.
dialog: (to Radar)
dialog: Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain

text: Radar goes out. Duke gets to his feet and Hawkeye makes a
dialog: preliminary move toward doing so.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: About that chest-cutter...
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE

scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: Even if I weren't.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Maria...
text: He kisses her and they cling together, standing outside a

scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: Oh, Hawkeye, I don't think I could
dialog: stick it out these next few weeks
dialog: without you.
text: Hawkeye opens the door of the Officers' Club, looks in.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Nobody here.
text: He steps aside to let her precede him in. There is nothing
text: inside except a pool table. She hesitates. He takes her in
text: his arms again, this time pressing his hands against the

scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: You understand why I still can't...
text: Ho-Jon appears in his line of vision, not hers.
speaker_heading: HO-JON

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
speaker_heading: HO-JON
dialog: Finest kind. Captain Forrests say
dialog: you better haul ass home quick. We

speaker_heading: BRIEF TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: EXT. THE SWAMP  DUSK
text: The wooden front of the tent has a new sign identifying it
dialog: as "THE SWAMP."
scene_heading: INT. THE SWAMP  DUSK
text: First we see Hawkeye sitting on his cot, looking across the
text: tent at the newcomer. Attached to the canvas wall behind him
text: is a photograph of his wife and two sons, aged four and two.
text: Next we turn our attention to Duke on the adjoining cot
text: (formerly Frank's). He also has a family picture on display:
text: his wife, two-year-old daughter and an infant. Then we get
text: our first glimpse of TRAPPER JOHN, their new tentmate, about
text: 30, tall and very thin, his head pretty well hidden inside
text: the hood of a parka. He is using cellophane tape to install
dialog: one of the popular nude photos of the day (such as the one
dialog: of Marilyn Monroe that circulated so widely in the early
dialog: 1950's).
text: Completing the group is Ho-Jon, who sits on the floor,
text: silently taking in everything that is done or said.
text: Finished with his decorating effort, Trapper reaches into
text: the depths of his parka to produce a can of beer. He digs
text: into the other side, finds an opener and opens the beer.
text: Then his head goes back inside the parka along with the can
text: as he takes a swig from it.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (to Hawkeye)
dialog: Now I got you for a witness, I'm
dialog: going to try again. So far all I
text: dragged out of him is he's from
dialog: Bahston and he's only been in the
dialog: Army two months.
dialog: (to Trapper)
dialog: Where were you when they drafted
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Home.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I mean, what were you doing? Were
dialog: you a resident or on a staff
dialog: someplace?
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Hospital.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Which hospital?
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
text: Back home.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Is there any reason why we shouldn't
dialog: know the name of it?
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: No.
dialog: (a long swig of beer)
dialog: Or why you should.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (to Duke)
dialog: I think I've seen this nut somewhere.
dialog: (to Trapper)
dialog: Haven't I?
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: If you don't know what you've seen,
dialog: why should I?
text: Hawkeye is unsatisfied. He keeps staring at Trapper, sure
dialog: he's seen him before.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (to Trapper)
dialog: You ready to switch to a little tonic
dialog: we generally take us about this time?
dialog: Ho-Jon...
text: Ho-Jon goes to the table and takes a few ice cubes from a
text: hospital ice-bag, puts them into the pitcher along with gin
text: and a dash of vermouth.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Don't you use olives?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Where you think you are, boy? They
dialog: probably never seen a olive in this
dialog: country.
text: Ho-Jon pours three water-glasses full of martini and starts
dialog: to distribute them.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (to Trapper)
dialog: That's the front up the road a few
dialog: miles. We have to get by without
text: some of the comforts of home.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: I like an olive.
text: He reaches into his parka, comes up with a bottle of olives,
text: takes one out and puts it into the martini Ho-Jon serves
text: him. Then, as Hawkeye and Duke gape at him, he offers them
dialog: the bottle.
speaker_heading: TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM  DAY
text: There are two operations going on, one of them being a simple
text: procedure requiring one surgeon and one nurse. The other by
text: contrast is a very special event. Trapper is operating,
text: assisted by another surgeon, a couple of nurses, a corpsman,
text: and the anesthesiologist, UGLY JOHN BLACK. Beside these actual
dialog: participants almost all the nurses and doctors from both
text: shifts, including Duke, Hawkeye (with Lieutenant Dish), Frank
text: and Henry, are in a circle around the operating table as
dialog: spectators.
text: Trapper's job is repairing a lacerated pulmonary artery, or
text: some other delicate piece of surgery close to the heart and
text: involving a large chest incision. We see enough of the process
text: to observe that it is gory and deep inside a critical area,
dialog: but necessarily it is the reactions of the people watching,
dialog: especially Duke and Hawkeye, that tell us how tricky an
text: operation it is and how expertly Trapper is handling it.
text: The sequence is silent except for incidental operating room
dialog: noises.
text: Even Trapper's occasional terse instructions to his assistants
text: and his brief exchange with Ugly John are spoken too low for
dialog: us to hear.
text: There are four stages to the action:
text: 1. The beginning of the operation before an attentive
text: audience, drawn by their interest in the new man and by the
dialog: fact that this is a surgical procedure they have never dared
dialog: to attempt.
dialog: 2. Limited approval and professional respect for the assurance
text: with which Trapper plots his incision and starts working his
text: way to his destination.
text: 3. Mounting tension as the crucial stage is reached. The
text: suspense reaches its crest during the few moments when Trapper
dialog: is doing the actual mending job to which all the preliminaries
text: have led. The faces of his colleagues express anxiety and
dialog: hope that he can accomplish what he set out to do, and
dialog: accomplish it quickly enough to permit the patient to survive.
text: Henry, not certain of his own judgment, looks to Duke for
text: confirmation, and Duke nods to indicate he thinks Trapper
text: has the situation under control.
text: 4. The tension breaks as Trapper finishes the job to his
text: satisfaction and begins, along with his assistant surgeon,
text: to close up. Henry's smile of relief is unsure and only
text: tentative until he catches Hawkeye's signal that the job has
dialog: been done to perfection.
speaker_heading: TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: EXT. MASH COMPOUND  DAY
text: Trapper, Hawkeye and Duke emerge from the hospital in
text: fatigues. Some enlisted men are tossing a football around.
text: One of them makes a wild throw and the ball rolls to a stop
text: at Trapper's feet. He stops to look at it and the other two
text: halt with him. Then very slowly, Trapper leans over and picks
text: up the ball, waving Hawkeye downfield.
text: Hawkeye complies unquestioningly and when he is about thirty
text: yards away, Trapper whips a perfect pass into his arms.
text: Hawkeye just stands where he is, holding the ball, oblivious
text: of the enlisted men who want it back, as Trapper and Duke
text: continue toward him.
text: Revelation jolts him with apocalyptic force.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around!
dialog: Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat
dialog: Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Sixteen times.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: We didn't have a chance, little
dialog: Androscoggin College against the Big
dialog: Green, but there was this blizzard
dialog: and we held then nothing nothing
text: till the last twenty seconds. Then
dialog: this great passer of theirs let one
dialog: go, snow and all...
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Lucky you didn't have your mouth
dialog: open or it would have gone down your
dialog: throat.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: He's Trapper John! Only man in history
dialog: who ever found fulfillment in the
dialog: ladies' can of a Boston and Maine
dialog: Railroad car! When the Conductor
dialog: caught him in there with his Winter
dialog: Carnival date, she screamed: 'He
dialog: trapped me!' What have you been doing
dialog: since those days, Trapper?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: What does he have to do? A score
dialog: like that, a man could just live on
dialog: his reputation.
text: The enlisted men, increasingly concerned about their football,
text: are muttering mutinously to each other. Hawkeye is too carried
text: away about Trapper's identity to notice this till Trapper
text: calls it to his attention.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: (to Hawkeye)
dialog: Ball.
text: Hawkeye looks at the football and at the enlisted men, and,
text: finally getting the point, throws it back to them.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: (relieved to find
dialog: another subject)
dialog: What gives over there?
text: They look across the compound to the Shower Tent, behind
text: which an Army truck full of GIs has just pulled up. While
text: Hawkeye and Duke explain what's going on to Trapper, and the
text: three of them move in for a closer look, we see the visiting
text: GIs drop one by one from the rear of the truck, pay their
dialog: admission fees and take their places in the line leading up
text: to the strategically placed peep hole in the rear corner of
dialog: the tent.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Must be Painlees Pole Day in the
dialog: Shower Tent.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (to Trapper)
dialog: You met him. Walt Waldowski, the
dialog: Dental Officer.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Nice guy, for an enamel surgeon.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: What are they peeking at? Captain
dialog: Waldowski in the shower?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: Part of him. Painless is the owner
dialog: and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack.
dialog: That's where he comes from...
dialog: Hamtrack, Michigan.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Best equipped dentist in the whole
dialog: goddam Army. Care to have a look, a
dialog: man with your background?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE

speaker_heading: DAGO RED
dialog: There's sort of a built-in prayer
dialog: for the sick man to get well, but of
dialog: course that's not the basic intention.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: I don't care about the intention. I
dialog: just know your Cross Action is a
dialog: plus on our side. I've seen it come
dialog: through four times.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: And you've had a natural four times
dialog: in a row in a crap game. Right? Does
dialog: that mean...?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Not without lots of praying and
text: kissing the dice.
dialog: (to Dago Red)
dialog: It's a different ritual but it works
dialog: the same.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: What do you think, Trapper?
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Me? I was raised a mackerel-snapper...
text: Dago Red gives him a quick, intent look, which Hawkeye notes.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: ...But I turned in my knee pads.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Ho-Jon, give the Father some more

speaker_heading: DAGO RED
dialog: Just a taste, Ho-Jon.

speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You came because we asked you, for a

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: We wanted to tell you how you were
dialog: helping us with your fixes.
speaker_heading: DAGO RED
dialog: Well, sure, but I'm also worried
dialog: about Walt Waldowski  Painless. His
text: poker players got in an argument and
dialog: asked him for a ruling, and he said
dialog: what difference did it make, it was
dialog: just a card game.
text: It's obvious from the shocked reactions of the Swampmen that

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: I guess I'm getting a toothache I
dialog: better have looked at.
speaker_heading: BRIEF TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: INT. DENTAL CLINIC  DAY
text: There is no activity around the dental chair, but the nonstop

text: PILOT) and enlisted men (VOLLMER, RADAR and JUDSON).
speaker_heading: UGLY JOHN

speaker_heading: RADAR

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Tell me the whole story, Walt.
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
dialog: There's this native broad works in
dialog: the laundry. I don't know if you've
dialog: noticed.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: There's only one worth noticing.
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
dialog: You noticed. I wasn't going to fool
dialog: around over here. I've got these
dialog: three girls I'm engaged to back
dialog: home...
text: He indicates three photographs of young women, displayed
dialog: with equal prominence. Any one of them could make Miss
dialog: America.
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
dialog: But I had this feeling I ought to
dialog: make the effort. To test myself. And
dialog: I flunked.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: What did you have to test, for God's
dialog: sake... the dental Don Juan of
dialog: Detroit?
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
dialog: Don Juanism is just a cover... I've
text: been reading up on it.
dialog: (emotionally overcome,
dialog: turning away)
dialog: I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been
dialog: living a lie!
text: Moved by the intensity of his self-denunciation, Hawkeye
text: bends down close to Painless, puts a comforting hand on his
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Painless, you mustn't talk that way.
dialog: It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
dialog: Homosexuality.
text: Hawkeye straightens abruptly, his hand rising from Painless'

speaker_heading: PAINLESS

dialog: up to me last night.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: You've been drawn to other males?
dialog: Since you were a kid?
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
dialog: No, never in the slightest.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Just in dreams?
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
dialog: Or in dreams either. I repressed it
dialog: completely. Classic pattern of
dialog: inhibition.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: That's what you've been doing all
dialog: these years with every dame you could
dialog: lay your hands on? Repressing your
dialog: real self?
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
dialog: But it's all over now, and I can't
dialog: face it. Imagine if you found out
dialog: you were one, you wouldn't like
dialog: breaking the news to your wife. Well,
dialog: I got the same problem multiplied.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: You don't have any problem. You've
dialog: got thirty good years ahead of you,
dialog: easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down
dialog: as you grow older, get along with
dialog: just two fiancees, but...
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
dialog: No, one thing I finally know for
dialog: sure, I'll never function with a

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: There ought to be a law against

speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: How you, Walt? We was just fixing to
dialog: have a nightcap.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: (to Ho-Jon)
dialog: Pour one for Painless.

text: of the hosts tries to think of a conversational opening.
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
dialog: I thought you guys ought to know.
dialog: I'm going to commit suicide.
text: This leads to another silence, broken by Trapper, who doesn't
text: go so far as to stand up but leans way out from his sack to
text: grasp the dentist by the hand.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Miss you, Walt.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: He said it for us all, Walt.
speaker_heading: BANDIDI
dialog: How about leaving me your record

speaker_heading: DUKE

speaker_heading: MURRHARDT
dialog: Reliable though.
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
dialog: That's really what I came here for.

speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Easy, pleasant, never-miss ride.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: In the direction you want to go.

dialog: How they goin', Losing Preacher?
dialog: What do you hear from the Pope?
speaker_heading: DAGO RED
dialog: You talked to Walt?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: He's parted his moorings.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: We're throwing him a Last Supper. We

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: The Painless Pole plans to cross the

dialog: your help to straighten him out.
speaker_heading: DAGO RED
dialog: What do you want me to do?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows
text: he's loused himself with the Church,
dialog: but it's part of our plan to make
dialog: him think he has the keys to the
dialog: kingdom. Which he will think if you
text: grease the skids for him.
speaker_heading: DAGO RED
dialog: I don't think I can give absolution
text: to a man who's about to commit
dialog: suicide. It's a mortal sin.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: What is, Red, the intention or the
dialog: act?
speaker_heading: DAGO RED
dialog: (confused)
dialog: I believe it takes both. I'd have to
dialog: look it up.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Just use common sense. Your job is
dialog: preventing sin, and the way to do
dialog: that is give him your best Cross
dialog: Action.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Or you can let him knock himself
dialog: out. You personally'd be sending him

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: An eternal damnation.

scene_heading: INT. DENTAL CLINIC  NIGHT
text: The poker table, and dental chair have been removed to make
text: room for two long tables from the Mess Hall. At these a
text: sumptuous, candlelit, stag banquet is coming to an end. The
text: guests are doctors, administrative officers, chopper pilots
text: and enlisted men. Duke is on his feet, raising a glass of
text: champagne in a toast. (All our male cast except Henry and
dialog: Frank)
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Y'all come here to say a final goodbye
dialog: to our old friend Walt. But maybe it
dialog: ain't so final. Maybe he's just going
dialog: on ahead into the Unknown to do a
dialog: little recon job for us all.
text: During this tribute the guests rise, their eyes on the guest
text: of honor, who sits with his food untouched, a vacant
text: expression on his face. When Duke has finished and everyone
text: has drunk the toast, they applaud and sit down again. Trapper
text: raps for attention and indicates Hawkeye, who rises.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: I just got this one thing to say.
dialog: Nobody ordered Walt to take on this
dialog: mission. He volunteered, for certain
dialog: death. That's what we award our
dialog: highest medal for. That's what being
text: a soldier is all about.
text: Except for Painless himself, the gathering is deeply moved
text: by this thought, some of them to the point of tears. Again
text: Trapper restores order.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Only one man here can add anything
dialog: to that.
text: He looks to Dago Red, who stands up, dressed for the first
text: time in the priestly vestments he wears for Sunday Mass. He
text: walks to where Painless sits and there begins the viaticum
dialog: (holy communion for those in danger of death).
speaker_heading: DAGO RED
dialog: Receive, my brother, this food for
dialog: your journey...
text: A coffin, borne into the room by two enlisted men while Red
text: is still speaking, is lined with blankets, equipped with a
dialog: pillow for comfortable reclining prior to the onset of death,
text: and furnished with mementos of Painless' earthly career: two
text: fresh decks of cards, a box of poker chips, a fifth of scotch,
text: some basic dental instruments and the photographs of his
text: three fiancees. It is set down on the floor next to Painless,
dialog: who regards it with the first show of interest he has
text: manifested during the proceedings.
speaker_heading: DAGO RED
dialog: (bestowing the sacred
dialog: host)
dialog: ...The body of our Lord Jesus Christ,
dialog: that He may guard you from the wicked
dialog: enemy and lead you into everlasting
dialog: life. Amen.
text: Red is making the sign of the Cross when Painless' curiosity
text: asserts itself.
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
dialog: What the hell's that?
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Coffin. Yours.
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
dialog: I'm not even dead yet.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: You're a pretty heavy guy to lug
dialog: around. Be a hell of a lot more
dialog: convenient for everybody if you got
dialog: into the box as soon as you've taken
dialog: the capsule.
text: He produces and opens a small box, inside which, surrounded
text: by pure white cotton, a black capsule is displayed like a
text: rare jewel. Dago Red, meanwhile, preferring not to know what
text: happens from here on, makes his way out.
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
dialog: (scrutinizing the
dialog: capsule)
dialog: How do you take it?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (appearing at his
dialog: side with tumbler of
dialog: whiskey)
dialog: With whiskey. A good swallow first
dialog: and a big one afterwards. Speeds it
text: into the bloodstream.
text: Painless takes the tumbler from him with one hand, the capsule
text: with the other. He downs a good-sized swig of whiskey, then,
text: with the capsule in front of his face, hesitates.
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
dialog: You guys sure this'll do the job?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: We wouldn't give you nothing but the
dialog: best.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
text: We stand behind all our work.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: You want it straight? Medical history
dialog: records no instance of anyone taking
dialog: this particular prescription and
dialog: surviving.
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
dialog: Here goes nothing.
text: He pops the capsule into his mouth and washes it down with a
text: large drink of whiskey. Hawkeye gestures to the waiting
text: coffin. Painless gets up and lowers himself into it.
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
dialog: How much time do I have?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Just about enough to say goodbye to
dialog: everybody.
dialog: (announcing)
dialog: Line up over here, men, if you want
dialog: to pay your last respects. Keep moving
dialog: and file on out when you're through.
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
dialog: I wonder, if Red's fix swings it for
dialog: me, what's heaven really like?
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
text: It's a bedroom where a man is always
text: at his peak and doesn't have to take
dialog: any time outs.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: And all the angels are built like
dialog: Lieutenant Dish.
text: The Last Supper guests are filing by the coffin, bending low
text: to shake Painless' hand and murmur words of farewell.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Drink up, Walt. One for the glory

text: He holds the glass to Painless' lips, helps him down the
dialog: rest of the whiskey.
speaker_heading: TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: INT. POSTOP WARD  NIGHT

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Thanks for coming, Maria.
text: (takes her arm and

dialog: exit)
dialog: Sorry it had to be so late.
scene_heading: EXT. MASH COMPOUND  NIGHT
text: Hawkeye and Lieutenant Dish walk from the Postop Ward.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: You're leaving tomorrow?
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: In less than twelve hours I'll be on
dialog: my way.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: That's when the real strain starts.
text: Three weeks on a troopship.
dialog: (embraces her)
dialog: Poor baby.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: (kissing him)
dialog: Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Though I guess who it'll really be
dialog: rough on is your husband.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: You're on his side all of the sudden?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: A man would be more considerate. He
dialog: wouldn't come home to his wife a
text: nervous wreck.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: How would he avoid it... as if I
dialog: needed to ask?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: It could be a purely impersonal thing.
dialog: What matters is the therapeutic value
dialog: of relieving your tensions.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: You should have been a marriage
dialog: counselor.
text: (drawing his head
dialog: closer to hers)
dialog: But I'll show you what's wrong with
dialog: your theory.
text: They kiss passionately. Dish is shaken by it and that shows
text: in her voice when she continues making her point.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: Do you think anything between us
dialog: could be impersonal? Or pure? You
dialog: better forget logic, because you're
dialog: proving why I shouldn't go to bed
dialog: with you.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (after a moment of
dialog: massive internal
dialog: struggle)
dialog: I didn't mean with me.
text: It takes a couple of seconds for what he has said to penetrate
text: her consciousness. She looks at him incredulously.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: You're asking for somebody else?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: It happens to be a matter of life
dialog: and death.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: A man is going to die if he doesn't
dialog: have my fair young body?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have
dialog: the same privilege that comes on
dialog: rare occasions to the chief executive
dialog: of some state or nation... the
dialog: privilege of restoring life, by one
dialog: tender act of mercy, to a doomed
dialog: fellow creature.
text: While he is speaking, a blue light goes on in a tent in the
text: background. As they turn to see what is going on, four men
text: carrying a heavy box approach the tent.
scene_heading: EXT. BLUE-LIT TENT  NIGHT (OFFICER'S CLUB)
text: At closer range the box is revealed to be Painless' coffin
text: with the departed dentist inside it. The four men who carry
text: it into the tent are Radar, Judson, Boone and Seidman. This
text: tent doesn't have a wooden door like the Swamp, just a flap.
speaker_heading: BRIEF TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: EXT. BLUE-LIT TENT  NIGHT
text: The four enlisted men carry the coffin, empty, out of the
text: tent. Then Hawkeye and Dish appear, moving slowly toward the
text: tent as he continues to break down her resistance.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: He should come to now for a while,
dialog: but he's got so much dope in him by
dialog: tomorrow he won't know fact from
dialog: fantasy.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: You think he won't.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: What do you care? You'll be on your
dialog: way to Japan.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel
dialog: terrible if anything happened to
dialog: him...
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: It's your decision, Maria. I don't
dialog: want to high-pressure you.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: I'd be crazy to think my virtue,
dialog: such as it is, was more important
dialog: than his life...
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: In fact I'd rather not try to
dialog: influence you at all.
dialog: (opening tent flap)
dialog: Let's just go in and take a look,
dialog: and then you think it through for
dialog: yourself.
scene_heading: INT. BLUE-LIT TENT  NIGHT
text: The tent has been fixed up with all the resources at their
text: disposal  cushions, parachute cloth, mirrors and little
text: touches of elegance gathered from all over the post  to
text: resemble a luxurious bedroom on the home front. Lying in bed
text: (the pool table) between clean, inviting sheets is Painless.
text: The boys have undressed him as we can see by his bare
text: shoulders. Hawkeye takes Dish by the hand and leads her to
text: the side of the bed.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: One last look at him...
dialog: (raises sheet,
text: uncovering Painless
dialog: to the knees)
dialog: ...still alive...
dialog: (slips raised sheet
dialog: into Dish's grasp)
dialog: ...the whole man.
text: Dish's eyes pop at what she sees. So astounded is she that
text: she doesn't notice Hawkeye has given her the sheet and made
dialog: off.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT DISH
dialog: My God, Hawkeye, I never realized...
dialog: I never even dreamed...
dialog: (becoming aware he's
dialog: no longer at her
dialog: side)
dialog: Hawkeye! Hawk...
text: She finds he's disappeared altogether. She can't resist
text: turning her gaze back to the uncovered Painless. Then she
text: drops the sheet.
scene_heading: EXT. BLUE-LIT TENT  NIGHT
text: The tent flap drops into place, continuing the movement of
text: the sheet. Our attention is drawn up the front of the tent
text: to its peak, which points firmly upwards.
speaker_heading: TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: EXT. THE SWAMP  MORNING
text: There is the SOUND of a HELICOPTER overhead. Hawkeye emerges
text: from the tent to look at it, verifying that it is coming
text: from the peaceful south rather than the embattled north.
text: Then he sees Lieutenant Dish coming out of her tent, wearing
text: her Army uniform and followed by one of the enlisted men
text: carrying her bags. Hawkeye waves goodbye but Dish doesn't
text: see him. Her face, seen up close, has a serene, faraway look,
text: neither happy nor unhappy, but enriched by experience.
text: Hawkeye is not distressed by her failure to acknowledge him;
text: he understands it's a question of preoccupation and not a
text: deliberate snub. He starts across the compound to the Mess
text: Hall, noting that the helicopter is descending to land on
text: the far side of the hospital.
scene_heading: EXT. LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH  MORNING
text: There is a small welcoming party on hand, headed by Henry
text: himself, to greet the passenger arriving in the helicopter.
text: When it lands the door is opened and HOT LIPS (as she will
text: soon be known) gets out smartly, which is the way she does
dialog: everything. Her official name is Major Margaret Houlihan and
text: she is tallish, willowish, blondish, fortyish, prettyish.
text: She and Henry exchange salutes and then shake hands. The
text: others in the greeting party are out of the habit of saluting,
dialog: and have to be reminded by a stern look from their Commanding
dialog: Officer.
text: As Henry and Hot Lips, followed by the others, head for the
text: hospital entrance, Lieutenant Dish appears with the enlisted
text: man behind her.
text: She gets into the helicopter and he lifts her bags in after
text: her. A moment later the chopper is airborne again.
scene_heading: INT. MESS HALL  DAY
text: One of the first people Hawkeye sees in the officer's section
text: is Painless, who is eating an enormous breakfast with great
dialog: gusto.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Morning Painless. How they goin'?
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
text: Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
scene_heading: INT. POSTOP WARD  DAY
text: Frank is listening gravely to a wounded soldier's heartbeat
text: through a stethoscope. Standing by awaiting orders is Private
text: Boone. Frank has a disturbed reaction to the lack of vital
text: signs from the patient.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (to Boone)
dialog: Get me one c.c. of adrenaline and a
dialog: cardiac needle.
speaker_heading: BOONE
dialog: What's a...?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Never mind questions. Get them!
text: As Boone dashes off with no comprehension of the errand he
text: is supposed to perform, Trapper, a couple of beds away, in
text: the soiled fatigues he wears on nonoperating room duty, can
text: see and hear what is going on. While he watches, Frank checks
text: the patient further and establishes that he is dead. With a
text: disappointed sigh, he drops the man's lifeless arm and throws
text: the bedcovers back over him up to his neck.
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM  DAY
text: Henry is showing Hot Lips through the hospital and introducing
text: her to personnel. At the moment he is presenting Knocko.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Captain Williams, Major.
dialog: (to Knocko)
dialog: Major Houlihan is our new Chief Nurse.
text: Knocko holds out her hand in friendly greeting, and is
text: startled to find Hot Lips expects a salute instead.
scene_heading: INT. POSTOP WARD  DAY
text: Trapper, having observed Frank's recognition of the fact his
text: patient is dead, is unprepared for what the Major does when
text: Boone comes running back with a syringe, a small vial and an
text: ordinary hypodermic needle.
speaker_heading: BOONE
dialog: (anxiously)
dialog: This what you wanted, Major?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (looking at vial)
dialog: No, you idiot. I said adrenaline.
text: And a cardiac needle.
text: He turns back to the patient and goes all over again through
text: the same checking process he followed before.
speaker_heading: BOONE
dialog: (desperately)
dialog: I'll ask a nurse!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's too late. You killed him, Boone.
text: A ghastly look appears on Boone's face. He tries to say
text: something, can't get it out, and bursts into tears instead.
text: Then additionally ashamed of himself for this weakness, he
text: runs out. Frank, deciding not to discipline the boy for the
text: display of unsoldierly conduct, is proceeding about his
text: business when Trapper accosts him.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: You got a moment, Frank?
text: He indicates the Utility Room, which leads off the Operating
text: Room and the Postop Ward. When Frank assents, Trapper opens
text: the door and ushers him in.
scene_heading: INT. UTILITY ROOM  DAY
text: It's a small room containing, among other items, a table
text: with a pot of coffee and cups which are available to medical
dialog: personnel at all hours.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: You all through work for the day?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yes, I am. Why do you want to know?
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Make sure you got time to sleep this
dialog: off.
text: He puts his whole hundred and thirty pounds behind a right
text: uppercut that lands squarely on Frank's jaw. At the same
text: instant the door from the Operating Room opens, and Henry
text: gallantly makes way for Hot Lips to precede him.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: This is the...
text: Frank drops to the floor, momentarily knocked out.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: T-Trapper!... C-C-Captain McIntyre...
dialog: what the hell... ?
speaker_heading: HOT LIPS
text: (staring at Trapper
dialog: incredulously)
dialog: That's a captain?
text: Frank is coming to and could probably get back into the fight
dialog: by a count of eight if he had any desire to.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (to Trapper)
dialog: What's going on? Who started this?
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: You mean who hit who?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Yes, that's what I mean.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: I did. First and only blow. So far.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: He wouldn't have touched me if I'd
dialog: had my guard up. Let us settle this
dialog: between ourselves, Colonel. Alone.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What do you think I'm running, an
dialog: English boarding school? McIntyre,
dialog: you're under arrest. Confine yourself
text: to quarters, pending an investigation.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: If you say so, Henry. But remember
dialog: my claustrophobia.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (to Hot Lips)
dialog: I deeply regret this unfortunate
dialog: incident. We try to remember we're a
dialog: military organization.
speaker_heading: HOT LIPS
dialog: I certainly would have thought so.
speaker_heading: TIME LAPSE:

speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: What's wrong with you?
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: I don't know. I must have lost my
dialog: punch. I didn't think the son-of-a-
dialog: bitch would get up.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Stop acting like a colonel, Henry.
dialog: You know Trapper wouldn't sock him
dialog: without a good reason.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: There's no reason good enough for
text: one medical officer to strike another.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: That there Frank Burns is a menace.
text: Whenever a patient croaks on him
dialog: it's either God's will or somebody
dialog: else's fault.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: This time he did it to a kid who's
dialog: simple enough to believe him. Why
dialog: don't you dump the mother, Henry? He
dialog: creates more work than he gets done.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I should fire him because he got in
dialog: the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've
dialog: put up with a lot from you guys, but
dialog: now I finally have to take
dialog: disciplinary action.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Christ. All of a sudden it's West
dialog: Point.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: What are you going to do with him?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Well...
dialog: (to Trapper)
dialog: I was going to name you Chief

dialog: To consult on both shifts, yours and
dialog: Frank's.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Hey, that's great, Henry! Good
dialog: thinking!
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: First decent idea you've had in a
dialog: month.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Now I'll have to wait at least a

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Honey, nobody as pretty as you could

dialog: Coffee?

speaker_heading: HOT LIPS
dialog: Captain, I've been observing the
dialog: nurses on your shift. But naturally
dialog: your own opinion is more informed
dialog: than mine.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: I'm glad you feel that way, Major,
dialog: because you see it's a team effort...
dialog: doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and
dialog: I feel responsible for my whole team,
dialog: and I want you to know I'm satisfied
dialog: with them.
speaker_heading: HOT LIPS
dialog: All of them?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: That's right. We work well together.
speaker_heading: HOT LIPS
text: Major Burns is far from satisfied.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE

speaker_heading: HOT LIPS
dialog: On the contrary, I've observed he's
dialog: not only a good technical surgeon,

speaker_heading: HOT LIPS

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly

speaker_heading: HOT LIPS
dialog: That kind of familiarity is

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Okay, Major, honey.

speaker_heading: HOT LIPS
dialog: No, leave all the rowdiness to them.
dialog: Calm down, drink your coffee.

dialog: distinctly.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Tell me, Frank, is that stuff you're

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE

scene_heading: INT. KOREAN ARMY INDUCTION CENTER  DAY
text: The locale is established by the presence of military
text: personnel in uniform and the fact that a KOREAN ARMY DOCTOR,
text: with the aid of one assistant, is examining in quick
text: succession a long line of naked young Korean boys. Ho-Jon's
text: turn comes up and we see how perfunctory the process is: a
dialog: brief overall scrutiny for visible defects, a blood pressure
text: reading, and the application of a stethoscope to a few key
text: spots. Ho-Jon looks healthy and the doctor is startled by
text: the unexpected reaction he gets on applying the stethoscope
text: to the boy's heart. He turns to check the blood pressure
text: figure which his assistant is about to record on the form he
dialog: has taken from Ho-Jon.
text: Apparently the pressure is just as out-of-line as the
dialog: heartbeat, and the doctor feels Ho-Jon is ineligible for
dialog: military service.
speaker_heading: KOREAN DOCTOR
dialog: (to assistant, in
dialog: Korean)
dialog: We can't take this one. His heartbeat
dialog: is much too fast, and his blood

dialog: (to Ho-Jon)
dialog: Have you ever seen a doctor before?
dialog: (abruptly, to assistant)
dialog: Wait a minute! What does it say there
dialog: about where he's been working?
dialog: (takes Ho-Jon's form
dialog: and reads the
dialog: information for
dialog: himself; then, to
dialog: assistant)
dialog: Get the check on his urine sample
dialog: right away.

speaker_heading: KOREAN DOCTOR
dialog: I don't liking it at all, what I

dialog: such a blood pressure for so young a
dialog: boys. Is frightening.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: I'm sorry to hear that. You think
dialog: he's unfit for military service?
speaker_heading: KOREAN DOCTOR
dialog: At first is no doubt. But then I am
dialog: seeing on his paper he work in
dialog: American hospital. And I think there
dialog: are so many drugs in such a places,
dialog: he could take some by mistake.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Why would he do that?
speaker_heading: KOREAN DOCTOR
dialog: Who is knowing? But the drug I have
text: find in his urine is solving all
dialog: mysteries. By tomorrow will be gone
dialog: his fast heart and high blood
dialog: pressure. So I think maybe you will
dialog: like to tell him goodbye. Okay?

dialog: choice but to admit defeat.

dialog: that we can identify them as golf balls. A closer look at

text: ALong with their soiled fatigue pants, Hawkeye wears a torn,
text: dirty T-shirt of some unlikely color, Trapper a sport shirt
text: that looks as if he had picked it up in Hawaii on the way
text: over and worn it ever since. Both are unshaven.
text: Each has a well-equipped golf bag into which he now replaces
text: the iron club he has been using for the medium-range shots
text: they have been practicing. Taking out drivers, they set tees
text: in the ground and, as the houseboys run up with the balls,
text: Trapper indicates they will be shooting down the longest
text: dimension of the field. After addressing the balls with a
text: few practice swings, they deliver expert drives that are not
text: only in the 250-yard range but fairly straight in the intended
dialog: direction.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (pleased with himself)
dialog: I came within about ten yards of
dialog: you. You know something, Trapper,
dialog: the way we been going, if we ever
dialog: got to see a real golf course again,
dialog: I bet we could burn it up.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: As far as the greens maybe. I don't
dialog: know if my putting would come back
dialog: or not, without some practice.
text: The SOUND of the helicopter taking off again doesn't concern

speaker_heading: TRAPPER

speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: '...Proceed immediately to Kokura,

speaker_heading: TRAPPER

dialog: These his X-rays?
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Yes, sir. Apparently some big chest
dialog: surgeon in Boston told the Congressman
dialog: the only man to take care of his son
dialog: was Captain John McIntyre.
dialog: (his doubt undiminished)
dialog: I suppose there could be more than
dialog: one doctor with that name...

text: when Hawkeye puts a question to her.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Where's the Congressman's son at,
dialog: honey?
speaker_heading: PRETTY WAC
dialog: Ward Six.
text: But then she does glimpse enough of their costumes to take a
text: full look, and her reaction indicates clearly that she is
text: not prepared for unkempt, unmilitary-looking men carrying
dialog: golf bags.
speaker_heading: PRETTY WAC
dialog: Hey you can't go in there! Who are
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: I'm the pro from Dover and this is
dialog: my favorite caddie.
speaker_heading: PRETTY WAC
dialog: Well, you can't go in. No till you
dialog: tell me your business and I check
text: with Colonel Merrill's office.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (relenting)
dialog: Well, if you must know...
text: But Trapper has meanwhile made a feint toward the door, to
text: which the Pretty Wac responds by rising and interposing
text: herself in his path.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: (to Hawkeye)
dialog: Hold it. If this soldier enforces
dialog: her own orders. I'm ready to take
text: her on. Anxious. Single combat.
text: He moves toward the girl, who holds her ground staunchly
text: till they are almost in contact. Then she takes a step back,
text: and continues to take one step backwards for each one of his
text: in her direction. When they get close to the door, her
text: resistance collapses entirely and she scurries back to her

text: Hawkeye march through the door.

scene_heading: INT. WARD SIX  DAY

text: WARD NURSE hovers near him, not actually cooperating with
text: them but not defying them either.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (to Congressman's son)
dialog: Don't worry, son. That's Captain
dialog: McIntyre, and he's the best chest
dialog: surgeon in the Far East and maybe in
dialog: the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you
dialog: up fine. Your daddy saw to that.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Just like we thought, it's a routine
dialog: problem. Nurse, who's in charge of
dialog: operating room preparations?
text: By the time he has begun his question to her, the WARD NURSE
text: has spotted someone approaching of whom she is in obvious
text: dread. And it is at this figure that she points by way of
text: answer: a firece looking NURSE CORPS CAPTAIN.
speaker_heading: WARD NURSE
dialog: Sh-sh-she is.
text: Anticipating that a major confrontation is about to take
text: place, Trapper and Hawkeye decide to keep it away from their
text: patient's beside. Accordingly they pick up their golf bags
text: and go to meet the advancing Captain.
scene_heading: NURSE CORPS CAPTAIN
dialog: What are you hoodlums doing in this

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (politely)
dialog: We're surgeons, ma'am, we're here to

scene_heading: NURSE CORPS CAPTAIN
dialog: You can't even look at a patient
dialog: here till Colonel Merrill says it's
dialog: okay. And he's still out for lunch.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Look, Mother. I want to go to work
dialog: in one hour. We're the pros from
dialog: Dover and we figure to crack that
text: kid's chest and get out to the golf
dialog: course before it's dark. So find the
text: gas-passer and tell him to premedicate
dialog: the patient. Then bring me the latest
dialog: pictures on him; the ones we saw
dialog: must be forty-eight hours old by
dialog: now. And tell the kitchen to rustle
dialog: up some lunch. Ham and eggs'll do;
dialog: steak would be even better. And give
dialog: me at least one nurse who knows how
dialog: to work in close without getting her
dialog: tits in my way.

speaker_heading: TRAPPER

speaker_heading: COLONEL MERRILL

speaker_heading: COLONEL MERRILL

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Beat it, Pop. If this chest gets

dialog: who did it.
text: To everyone's astonishment, including the Colonel's, it works.
text: He turns around and walks out without another word. Most
text: affected of all by Hawkeye's audacity is Me Lay, who reacts
text: with a sharp look in Hawkeye's direction and then by picking
text: up his anesthesia chart and writing, in the space labeled
dialog: "First Assistant," the name "Hawkeye Pierce."
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
speaker_heading: ME LAY

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (to Trapper)
dialog: Did I ever tell you about Me Lay
dialog: Marston?
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Your high school friend who went

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Well, he wouldn't score more than

text: It is this last feature that attracts Hawkeye's attention.
text: He squats down to feel its texture and with a look invites

speaker_heading: TRAPPER

speaker_heading: ME LAY

text: with her in his embrace.
speaker_heading: ME LAY

speaker_heading: TRAPPER

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE

speaker_heading: ME LAY

speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: (releasing Michiko
dialog: and sitting up
dialog: reluctantly)
dialog: We don't have to see him. Call that

speaker_heading: ME LAY
dialog: But it's ten-thirty at night. We

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE

dialog: We stumbled on this deal. We didn't

dialog: Six cases ready for surgery, sir,
dialog: and four more that just need a little
dialog: more blood or a little more time for
text: the antibiotics to take hold.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I guess we can handle them, if there
dialog: aren't any six o'clock choppers.
dialog: Every time they fly while it's still
dialog: daylight, they've got wounded that
dialog: can't wait.
speaker_heading: BRIEF TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: EXT. LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH  LATE AFTERNOON
text: Henry's watch says a minute or two after six o'clock. Once
text: more, as at the beginning, he is standing outside the
text: Admitting Ward with Radar, listening for helicopters coming
text: from the north. Radar, straining his superhearing to listen,
text: reacts unhappily to a sound neither we nor Henry can catch.
speaker_heading: RADAR
text: Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of
dialog: them, I'm afraid.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Damn.
speaker_heading: RADAR
dialog: (a puzzled look)
dialog: And another one, but it's from the
dialog: south.
dialog: (looking south)
dialog: There.
text: Henry looks eagerly to the south as the COMBINED SOUND of
text: three helicopters becomes audible and quickly mounts in
dialog: intensity.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY TO THE SOUTH  DAY
text: A helicopter (the type that came from Seoul to pick up Trapper
text: and Hawkeye, rather than the Air Rescue Squadron ones that
text: bring the wounded from the front) approaches the landing
text: area and starts to make its descent. There is a golf bag
text: full of clubs attached to each of its pods.
speaker_heading: BRIEF TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: INT. ADMITTING WARD  DAY
text: Trapper and Hawkeye, conspicuous because they are still in
text: their golf costumes, are among the surgeons checking the
text: newly arrived wounded. More cases are still being brought in
text: from helicopters and ambulances, mainly on stretchers, a few
text: under their own power assisted by a Medical Corpsman or two.
text: This is really the most hideous face of war; the mangled
text: bodies and limbs and faces, the expressions alive with pain
text: and dulled by shock, are more terrible than any number of
text: quiescent corpses. Trapper finishes examining a man and speaks
dialog: to Hot Lips.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: This one goes right to the OR. Tell
text: Duke to do him ahead of the busted
dialog: spleen.
dialog: (moving on to another
dialog: patient, a Korean)
dialog: And this kid can't wait. I'll take
dialog: him myself, before I get to that
text: ruptured diaphragm.
speaker_heading: HOT LIPS
dialog: Captain...
dialog: (securing his attention)
dialog: 'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: HOT LIPS
dialog: It's an American boy's rupture you're
dialog: supposed to close.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Listen, we get a deluge like this,
dialog: just deciding priorities on a medical
dialog: basis is hard enough. So never mind
dialog: the side issues.
speaker_heading: BRIEF TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT
text: A few days later. Duke is working deep inside a belly with a
text: new young surgeon, CAPTAIN LAPHAM, assisting him. Lapham
text: glances at the patient's face.
speaker_heading: LAPHAM
dialog: Duke...
text: Duke looks, too, and the patient's eyes are enough to tell
text: him the job he's doing no longer has any function. After an
text: almost superfluous check of the heartbeat, Lapham closes the
text: man's eyes.
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT
text: Hawkeye, with Ugly John handling the anesthetic, is digging
text: out pieces of metal from a face that will never quite look
text: like a face again.
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT
text: Trapper, with Painless filling in as anesthesioloigist, is
text: working in close to a patient's heart. Suddenly all the lights
text: in the OR go out. This is not an unprecedented event, and
text: one by one three corpsmen appear in different locations around
text: the operating table with flashlights whose combined beams
dialog: make it possible for Trapper to carry on.
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT
text: With the electric light restored, Duke and Lapham are at
text: work on another case, removing several feet of small bowel
dialog: no longer useful to the owner.
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT
text: Henry and Murrhardt, with Scorch assisting, are amputating
text: an arm.
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT
text: A dead patient, face covered with a sheet is removed from an
text: operating table by two corpsmen. Immediately two other
text: corpsmen bring a stretcher to the other side of the table
text: and unload a new patient onto it. Ugly John and a nurse start
dialog: to prepare him for surgery.
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT
text: Hawkeye, with Knocko helping, is sewing up an incision which
text: we can see is in the area of the groin. Dago Red comes by.
speaker_heading: DAGO RED
dialog: Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: He'll live if that's what you mean.
dialog: But somebody better be around when
text: he comes to and finds out there's
text: nothing left between his legs.
speaker_heading: TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: INT. ADMITTING WARD  DAY
text: A few days later. A new group of patients is being brought
text: in on stretchers by corpsmen. Trapper and Duke are examining
text: an unconscious Negro private. Trapper looks at him with
text: special attention to the eyes. The right pupil is dilated
text: and fixed. Duke meanwhile checks his pulse and blood pressure.
speaker_heading: DUKE
text: Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Look at that right eye.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Epidural hematoma?
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: I don't know what else. You've been
dialog: that route a little, haven't you?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Not enough to be a pro.
text: He moves to another case. Duke continues to examine the
text: private with particular attention to the right side of the
text: head. The more he observes, the more alarmed he becomes.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (to corpsman)
dialog: Into the OR! Right now.
text: He runs ahead of the stretcher through the Preop Ward. At
text: the entrance to the OR he runs into Knocko.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Quick, Knocko, get me gloves, knife,
text: hammer, chisel, Gelfoam and a drain.
speaker_heading: BRIEF TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM  DAY
text: Knocko finishes saving and cleaning the right temporal area
text: of the unconscious private's head, and Duke wastes no time
text: making an incision down to the bone.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Okay, give me the hammer and chisel.
dialog: There are drills you can make nice,
dialog: neat holes in the skull with, but we
dialog: ain't got none.
dialog: (taking hammer and
dialog: chisel, fortifying
dialog: himself for the act)
dialog: So here goes.
text: He pounds the chisel into the private's skull and keeps at
text: it till he cracks his way through. Blood flows out in a
text: torrent. Duke pulls his tools away and just watches. Very
text: quickly he is rewarded by the sight of a torrent diminishing
text: to a dribble.
speaker_heading: KNOCKO
dialog: What happens now?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: We sew him up.
text: He stuffs Gelfoam down into the bleeding site, puts in a
text: rubber drain and starts to sew the skin back together with
text: silk sutures.
speaker_heading: BRIEF TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM  DAY
text: The private is moaning and stirring restlessly on the table
text: as Duke finishes closing the incision and Knocko takes the
text: Patient's pulse.
speaker_heading: KNOCKO
text: Pulse is way back. Nearly sixty.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: We took the pressure off his brain.
dialog: You know, Knocko, this boy might
dialog: just make it, and if he does you and
dialog: me ought to be ready with a story.
speaker_heading: KNOCKO
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: One thing everybody knows for sure
dialog: that don't know hardly anything else,
dialog: is how delicate any kind of brain
dialog: surgery is. So I certainly wouldn't
dialog: like it if there was somebody going
dialog: around saying all I did was crack
text: him on the head with a hammer and
dialog: chisel.
speaker_heading: BRIEF TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: INT. ADMITTING WARD  DAY
text: Hawkeye is examining a young PRIVATE FIRST CLASS who is in
text: shock, semiconscious and saturated with mud over his whole
text: uniform, hair and skin. There is a muddy, bloody bandage
text: around his neck.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (to a corpsman)
dialog: Get that bandage off so I can see
dialog: what the hell's underneath.
text: He moves on to the next stretcher. The corpsman undoes the
text: bandage and pulls it away. The Private First Class turns his
text: head to the left, and blood spurts two feet into the air
text: from a hole in the right side of his neck.
scene_heading: PRIVATE FIRST CLASS
dialog: Mama, Mama! Oh, Mama, I'm dying!
text: The blood continues to gush as the people in the immediate
text: vicinity watch in fascination. As it comes down again if
text: falls on the PFC's face and into his mouth. He reacts by
text: coughing, spraying his audience with blood. Hawkeye runs
text: back and sticks his index finger down the hole, blocking off
text: the severed artery and stopping the flow of blood.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (to corpsmen)
dialog: Bring him to the OR right on this
dialog: stretcher. I can't take my finger
dialog: out. Somebody find Ugly John and get
dialog: his ass in there.
text: They are already in motion toward OR, Hawkeye moving along
text: beside the stretcher with his finger in the hole. On the way
text: they pass near Leslie.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: This one is urgent, Les. Start
text: somebody cutting off his clothes.
dialog: Tell the lab to come in with a couple
dialog: of pints of low titre O, and type
dialog: and cross-match him for five or six
dialog: more. Get somebody to do two
text: countdowns and start the blood. Come
dialog: to think of it, get somebody to start
dialog: rounding up donors, and send some
dialog: cowboys to Seoul for all the goddam
dialog: blood they can get. And get that
dialog: miserable gas-passer in here!
speaker_heading: UGLY JOHN
dialog: (at OR entrance)
dialog: I'm here.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Good. Get him asleep and a tube in
dialog: him if you can. His common carotid
dialog: is cut and I can't do anything with
text: the son-of-a-bitch jumping all over
dialog: the place.
dialog: (to Leslie)
dialog: Find somebody to help me. I got to
dialog: keep a finger on this or we lose
dialog: him, and I can't get it clamped with
dialog: my left hand.
speaker_heading: BRIEF TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM  DAY
text: The PFC has been transferred to an operating table without
text: Hawkeye losing his finger pressure on the artery. The clothes
text: have been cut off him, and Ugly John has both blood and
text: anesthetic going into him, the latter through an intratracheal
text: tube. Hawkeye has a scalpel in his left hand and with it he
text: enlarges the wound around his right index finger. Then he
text: tries to slide a Kelly clamp down his finger into the wound
text: to clamp the artery but he can't manage it lefthanded.
text: He looks desperately around the OR only to observe that every
text: surgeon and nurse is fully engaged, including Henry and Hot
text: Lips. Ugly John is having a hard time fulfilling his dual
dialog: function as it is, and can't possibly take on another. Hawkeye
text: tried again with the clamp and fails, and then, to his great
text: relief, there appears within in his peripheral vision as he
text: concentrates his attention on the PFC's neck, a male figure,
text: gowned, capped, masked and gloved. It doesn't matter to
text: Hawkeye which of his colleagues it is; he just tells him
dialog: what assistance he needs from him.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Grab this Kelly, ride it down my
dialog: fingers and we'll have this mother
text: under control.
text: The newcomer, though Hawkeye doesn't realize it, is Dago
dialog: Red.
text: Following instructions, he takes the clamp and inserts it in
dialog: the wound.
speaker_heading: DAGO RED
dialog: What do I do with it Hawk? This is a
dialog: little out of my line.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Didn't recognize you, Red. When you
dialog: get the clamp all the way down, open
dialog: it as wide as you can and see if you
text: can close it on the artery.
text: Dagor Red obeys these orders cautiously. When he widens the
text: clamp and starts to close it again, he has the satisfying
text: sensation of feeling something substantial, and seizes it
dialog: vigorously.
speaker_heading: DAGO RED
dialog: I got it! I got it!
text: But what he has grabbed with the clamp is Hawkeye's finger
text: and Hawkeye, by reflex action, pulls it out to where we can
text: see it with the clamp grasping it. The blood starts to spurt
text: again and Hawkeye goes back into the wound, but this time
text: with his left index finger.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: You got my finger for Christ's sake.
dialog: But maybe I can do better with my
dialog: right hand.
text: (inserts a retractor
dialog: into wound, puts the
dialog: working end of it in
dialog: Dago Red's hands,
dialog: taking back the Kelly
dialog: clamp)
dialog: Pull it toward you. More. Good.
dialog: (rides clamp down his
dialog: left index finger
dialog: and this time he
dialog: closes it on the
dialog: right place)
dialog: There. That does it for now.
dialog: (to Ugly John)
dialog: We'll keep him right where he is
dialog: till Trapper John can give me a hand
text: sewing that artery back together.

scene_heading: EXT. LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH  LATE AFTERNOON
text: Two helicopters descend to the ground, and corpsmen start

text: stepped outside the Admitting Ward entrance to watch. They

speaker_heading: CORPSMAN
dialog: This kid is pretty bad.
text: Out of habit Hawkeye looks at the X-ray first.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: For you, Trapper.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: (looking at X-ray)
dialog: Okay, but I'll need you to help.
dialog: Duke, will you take that belly back

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: It's in pretty deep.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood.
dialog: I'm afraid it's hit more that just

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a

speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: (to Radar)
dialog: Has that A-negative come from Seoul?
dialog: We'll need some in the OR.
speaker_heading: RADAR
dialog: There isn't any. We keep ordering
dialog: and they don't deliver.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: We got to have at least one pint.

speaker_heading: BRIEF TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT
text: Hawkeye is assisting Trapper in making the incision in Ho-
text: Jon's right chest. Ugly John is giving the boy additional
dialog: anesthetic.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: If we squeeze him through, I'm going
dialog: to get him into Androscoggin College.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: How about squeezing him through into
dialog: Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is
dialog: catch lobsters, he can learn that
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Dartmouth's too big and too expensive.
dialog: If he's as good as I think he is, he
dialog: can move into the big league later.
dialog: But Androscoggin first.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: (studying the incision)
dialog: We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Never mind the conversation. Do it,

speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: You aspirate the blood from the chest
dialog: cavity. Damn, there's more of it

text: Henry stirs.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (mumbling in sleep)
dialog: Not now, honey. Gobacksleep.
text: The lab technician tightens the sleeve of Henry's T-shirt to

text: into the vein and starts extracting blood into a pint
dialog: container.
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT
text: Hawkeye has finished aspirating the blood. Trapper reaches
text: down into the wound.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: (triumphantly)
dialog: I got it. Here, feel. In the cava.
text: He takes his hand out and lets Hawkeye put his in.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: I don't feel anything.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Oh, Jesus.
text: He indicates that he wants to feel again. Hawkeye withdraws

speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: I can't feel it now either. The mother
text: must have gone in.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: I don't get it.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
text: It was in the cava and the hole sealed
dialog: itself off. I must have jiggled it
dialog: just enough to turn it loose. I can't
dialog: feel it in the heart or the right
dialog: pulmonary artery. So it's in the
text: left pulmonary artery.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: What do we do?
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: We'll have to close this hole and
text: make one on the other side.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Be kind of rough on him if there's
dialog: no blood. Why don't we close up and
dialog: sit on him a couple of days?
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Sure, that's the right way... at
dialog: John Hopkins or someplace. But how
dialog: do we know there won't be even more
dialog: of a jam-up a few days from now?
dialog: Maybe we won't be able to get to him

text: The door of the tent is closed behind Hot Lips, and after a
text: moment there is the sound of water being turned on. Then our
text: attention is drawn to the peak of the tent, to which a thin
text: scarcely visible strand of wire has been attached. The wire
text: is drawn taut and runs across the peak of the barbershop
text: tent next door and down the far side of it to where Duke
text: sits on the ground operating a sort of windlass upon which
text: the wire is wound. He turns the crank with a quick burst of
dialog: energy.
text: Back at the shower tent the force of the wire pulls the canvas
text: tight, the loosened stakes come out of the ground, and the
text: whole tent is whisked right off its center pole, revealing
text: Hot Lips nude under the shower.
scene_heading: EXT. BARBERSHOP TENT  DAY
text: Duke abandons his machine and moves to where he can get the

speaker_heading: HOT LIPS
dialog: This isn't a hospital, it's an insane

dialog: them!
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What do you expect me to do?
speaker_heading: HOT LIPS
dialog: Put them under arrest! See what a
text: courtmartial thinks of their drunken
dialog: hooliganism. It started with their
dialog: calling me Hot Lips and your letting
dialog: them get away with it. You let them
dialog: get away with everything! And if you
dialog: don't turn them over to the MPs now,

speaker_heading: GENERAL HAMMOND
dialog: ...These are very serious accusations,

text: looks in, doesn't like what he sees and steps inside. All
text: six players are immediately aware of his presence but decide
dialog: to act as if they weren't.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (to British Officer,
dialog: who is dealing)
dialog: Gimme three.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HAMMOND
dialog: At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a

dialog: you are responsible. Yet I find you
text: in a poker game.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: You betcher ass, Dad.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HAMMOND
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BRITISH OFFICER
text: One to the dealer.
dialog: (to Hawkeye)
dialog: You're the opener.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Check.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HAMMOND
dialog: Pierce! That soldier requires
dialog: immediate attention. I'm a surgeon
dialog: and I know.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: You betcher ass, General.
speaker_heading: BRITISH OFFICER
dialog: I'll wager a dollar.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I fold.
speaker_heading: PAINLESS
dialog: See the bet.
speaker_heading: NORWEGIAN OFFICER
dialog: Me likewise.
text: Hawkeye and the Australian throw in their hands.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HAMMOND
dialog: Are you going to take care of your

dialog: poker?
speaker_heading: BRITISH OFFICER
dialog: King-high flush.
text: Painless and the Norwegian throw in their hands, and the
text: Englishman pulls in the pot.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (to the general)
dialog: I'm going to play poker until three
dialog: a.m. or until the patient is ready
dialog: for surgery. However, if you'd like
dialog: to operate on him yourself right
dialog: now, be my guest. I get the same
dialog: dough whether I work or not.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HAMMOND
dialog: I want to talk to you, Pierce.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: There's nothing to talk about,
dialog: General. You take the case yourself
dialog: or join me at three o'clock. Either
dialog: way you're liable to learn something.
text: The General is far from pleased with the disrespect accorded

scene_heading: INT. SURGEONS' WASH-UP ROOM  NIGHT
text: General Hammond joins Hawkeye at the scrub sink, prepared to
dialog: take part in the coming operation.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: General, at one-thirty when I checked
dialog: him last, this guy had had less than
text: a pint of blood, and he'd lost two
text: or three. His pulse then was 120 and
dialog: his blood pressure was about 90.
text: Now, at three o'clock, he's had three
text: pints of blood. His pulse is 80 and
text: his pressure 120. His collapsed lung
dialog: has been expanded and he's had a
dialog: gram of terramycin intravenously. We
dialog: can operate on him safely and we
dialog: should do it quickly, but we don't
dialog: have to do it frantically or
text: carelessly.
speaker_heading: TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT
text: Hawkeye has been doing the repair work in the patient's belly,
text: with General Hammond functioning as a largely nonparticipating
dialog: assistant.
text: The incision is still open with sections of bowel on which
text: repairs have been done still exposed.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Now, General, I'm going to sandbag
dialog: you. Do you think we're ready to get
dialog: out of this belly?
speaker_heading: GENERAL HAMMOND
dialog: Obviously you don't think so, and I
dialog: don't know why.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes
dialog: in the large bowel. They've all been
text: in the small bowel, but the smell is
dialog: different. I caught a whiff of large
dialog: bowel, but it ain't staring us in
dialog: the face, right?
speaker_heading: GENERAL HAMMOND
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: So if it ain't staring us in the
text: face, it's got to be retroperitoneal.
dialog: And that, along with the look of the
dialog: wounds, makes me figure he's got a
dialog: hole in his sigmoid colon that we
dialog: won't find unless we look for it.
text: He has been working all the time he has been talking, and
text: now, after a little more manipulation within the incision,
text: is able to indicate the perforation he has hypothecated.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: And there it is.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HAMMOND
dialog: I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally,
dialog: the kind of job I have, I don't get
dialog: much chance to keep up with what
text: goes on in the OR.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Neither does Henry Blake. But I'll
dialog: tell you what makes him the best
dialog: C.O. you've got in any of your
dialog: hospitals. He leaves all the medical
dialog: decisions to the men who do the day-
dialog: to-day work and understand what
dialog: meatball surgery is.

scene_heading: INT. THE SWAMP  DAY
text: The following day. General Hammond is having a drink with

speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot
text: Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Or her figger.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: She's so square she's even against
dialog: our having a football team.
text: This stirs the General's curiosity, but Duke speaks before
text: he has a chance to ask his question.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You don't think we'd be speaking up
dialog: for a goddam Regular Army colonel,
dialog: do you, if it wasn't important?
dialog: Begging your pardon, General. I
dialog: forgot.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HAMMOND
dialog: (to Hawkeye)
dialog: Football?
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Anybody you replaced Henry with
dialog: couldn't last. We guarantee that.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HAMMOND
dialog: I didn't know you had a football
dialog: team.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Well, it's still pretty much in the
text: talk stage.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HAMMOND
dialog: We had a team at the 325th Evac last
dialog: fall. I coached the boys myself.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: I think I heard about that.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HAMMOND
dialog: Now we're working out a schedule of
dialog: the outfits we're going to play this
dialog: year. We all chip into a pool and
dialog: make bets.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Must be fun. But the point we want
dialog: to make about Henry...
speaker_heading: GENERAL HAMMOND
dialog: (rising)
dialog: I'm sure we could find a date for
dialog: your team. Why don't I take it up
dialog: with Henry?
dialog: (exiting)
dialog: Thanks for the drink, boys.
text: After the General has left, the other two Swampmen look at
text: Hawkeye uncomprehendingly.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Where the hell we going to get us a
dialog: football team?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: All three of us played for our
dialog: schools. And there are at least four
dialog: other guys...
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: But he's got five times the man-power
dialog: to draw on.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: We can balance that by getting
dialog: ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say
text: he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a
dialog: specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon
dialog: Jones.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Never heard of him.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker'
dialog: Jones.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: The nigra boy with the Philadelphia
dialog: Eagles?
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: He only lasted one season.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: On account he got caught in the doctor
dialog: draft. He was a surgical resident
dialog: playing semi-pro ball weekends when
dialog: the Eagles signed him.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: How come nobody knows about him? And
dialog: you do?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: I worked with Spearchucker my first
dialog: month over here, at the 72nd Evac in
dialog: Taegu. Most of the colored guys know
text: who he is but they're not talking
dialog: because he asked them not to.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: So what makes you think he'll play
dialog: for us?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: We'll cut him in on the bets we make.
dialog: And still have enough profit to send
dialog: Ho-Jon to college.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Might make kind of a social issue,
dialog: not having any other Negro officer.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: He can move in here with us.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a
dialog: long way, learning to put up with a
dialog: couple of crazy Yankees, but...
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Don't tell me about your problems,
dialog: boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
scene_heading: INT. HENRY'S OFFICE  DAY
text: Henry, nervous at what he thinks is going to be his showdown
text: with General Hammond, is startled by the General's unexpected
dialog: proposal.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HAMMOND
dialog: If we had closer relations, there
dialog: wouldn't be any misunderstandings.
dialog: That's where a football game would
dialog: help. Between your outfit and mine.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: A football game?
speaker_heading: GENERAL HAMMOND
dialog: Special Services in Tokyo are all
dialog: for it. They say it's one of the
dialog: main gimmicks we have to keep the

speaker_heading: HENRY

speaker_heading: GENERAL HAMMOND

speaker_heading: TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: EXT. LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH  DAY
text: It is September. A helicopter descends to the ground in the
dialog: familiar location and, as on earlier occasions, Medical
text: Corpsmen come from the hospital to aid in unloading it. But
text: this time the cargo, instead of wounded men, turns out to be
text: boxes which the corpsmen rip open and which contains football
text: uniforms: black shoes, cardinal red jerseys, white helmets
text: and white pants.
speaker_heading: TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD BEHIND OFFICERS' LATRINE  DAY
text: A day or two later. Fifteen men are wearing uniforms from
text: the chopper load. Practice at this point is confined to
text: kicking and passing the three footballs at their disposal,
text: and the uniforms still look clean and new. Trapper is a good
text: passer, Hawkeye is a better-than-average receiver, and Duke
text: punts well, but generally speaking, the balls are dropped
dialog: more often than they are caught, and the overall effect is
text: pretty ragged. Among the other players are Vollmer, Ugly
text: John, Boone, Painless and Judson. On the sidelines watching
text: are Henry, with a whistle tied to a piece of rubber hospital
text: tubing around his neck, and, in uniform, SPEARCHUCKER, a
text: very big, broad-shouldered black man in his early thirties.
speaker_heading: SPEARCHUCKER
dialog: If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: The way I run an organization, any
dialog: man in it has the right to speak his
dialog: mind.
speaker_heading: SPEARCHUCKER
dialog: In that case, here are ten basic
dialog: plays. I think that's about all this
dialog: bunch can handle.
text: He hands Henry ten sheets of paper, on each of which a running
text: or pass play is diagrammed down to the finest detail.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll
dialog: certainly take a look at these. Where
dialog: the hell did you ever get that name?
speaker_heading: SPEARCHUCKER
dialog: I used to throw the javelin.
text: Hawkeye catches a pass from Trapper and runs with the ball
text: right to where Henry and Spearchucker are standing.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Listen, we look pretty lousy out
dialog: there, right?
speaker_heading: SPEARCHUCKER
dialog: Well, for college players that have
dialog: been out of training seven or eight
dialog: years...
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: I'm thinking about how we can make
dialog: more money.
dialog: (to Henry)
dialog: Suppose we bet only part of our dough
dialog: and keep this big animal out of the
dialog: game the whole first half and let
dialog: them roll up some points. Then you
dialog: could bet the rest of our bundle
dialog: between the halves and get the General
dialog: and his friends to give us some real
dialog: odds.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: It's the only way we can make enough
dialog: to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
scene_heading: EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD, 325TH EVAC HOSPITAL  DAY
text: It is November. The Mash team, in uniform, comes out of the
text: quonset hut assigned to it as dressing quarters. Already on
text: the bench toward which the players head are a few supporters
text: including Dago Red, Knocko and Leslie. Radar is also there
dialog: serving as water boy.
text: Spearchucker has a blanket wrapped over his head and held
text: together at the chin to eliminate the chance of his being
text: recognized as he looks over their opponents, who now file
text: out of their quonset hut.
dialog: The first notable thing about them is that they number twenty-
dialog: five as opposed to a total of fifteen in uniform for the
dialog: Mash team.
dialog: Second is the even more discouraging fact that two of them,
text: one black and one white are enormous, bigger than
text: Spearchucker. The uniforms are orange and black.
speaker_heading: SPEARCHUCKER
dialog: Those two big guys were tackles on
dialog: the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead
dialog: played halfback with the Rams.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: They can't do that to me!
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: The bastards outconned us.
speaker_heading: SPEARCHUCKER
dialog: I think we could still have a chance.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: If you start the game instead of
dialog: waiting, you mean?
speaker_heading: SPEARCHUCKER
dialog: No, let's stick to that strategy
dialog: till we see whether you boys can do
dialog: two things. The first is get that
text: halfback out of the game. He had one
dialog: year with the Rams before the Army
dialog: got him, but he didn't play too often
dialog: because he's one of those hot dogs.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SPEARCHUCKER
text: When he sees a little running room,
dialog: he likes to make a show... you know,
text: stutter steps and cross-overs and
dialog: all that jazz. Also he never learned
dialog: to button up when he gets hit, so if
dialog: you two can get a good shot at him
dialog: once, you can hurt him.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: But we'd have to break his leg or
dialog: something to keep him out of the
dialog: game for good.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Not necessarily.
speaker_heading: UGLY JOHN
dialog: As long as there's a pile-up, we can
dialog: do our bit to encourage his permanent
dialog: withdrawal from the contest.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: It's a technique Ugly John and I
dialog: worked out in case something like
dialog: this came up.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (gazing across at
dialog: opposition tackles)
dialog: Look at the size of those two beasts.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: I don't think I could hurt one of
text: them with a sledgehammer.
speaker_heading: SPEARCHUCKER
dialog: You can make them run. They've got
dialog: the occupational disease of oversized
dialog: ex-athletes. They're carrying thirty
dialog: pounds extra apiece. So we run
dialog: everything wide, wide, wide... make
dialog: them move more then they want to on
dialog: every play.
scene_heading: EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD, 325TH EVAC HOSPITAL  DAY
text: The Mash team is lined up to kick off, which is Duke's
dialog: function.
text: There is only one official, a REFEREE, dressed in conventional
dialog: white.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: The pro halback is playing safety.
dialog: Kick it to anybody else.
text: Duke accordingly kicks the ball about thirty yards and angled
text: to his left. But the player who takes it on the thirty-yard
text: line simply runs to his left and back a little toward his
text: own goal line in order to hand it to the RAM HALFBACK as he
text: charges downfield from his safety position. He sidesteps,
text: straight-arms or otherwise eludes all eleven of the Mash
text: players and runs unimpeded for a touchdown. A few moments
text: later he kicks the ball over the bar for the point after
dialog: touchdown.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (screaming from
dialog: sidelines)
dialog: Stop him! Stop that man!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (as they line up to
dialog: receive)
dialog: Sure, you just blindfold him first
text: and tie him to a stake.
text: Duke is the one to receive the kickoff, which he takes on
dialog: the ten.
text: He runs it back about twenty yards, dodging several enemy
text: tacklers, then sees the black tackle from Cleveland bearing
text: down on him. Duke runs back and forth sideways a few times,
text: not gaining any ground but making the other man move.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Hawkeye!
text: He throws a lateral pass to Hawkeye, toward whom both tackles
text: from Cleveland now run. Hawkeye leads them almost from one
text: side of the field to the other, then reverses direction,
text: keeping them on the move till he sees a chance to throw a
text: lateral to Trapper.
speaker_heading: SPEARCHUCKER
dialog: (from the bench)
dialog: That's the stuff! Run the hams off
dialog: those big hogs!
text: Trapper returns the ball to Duke, who manages to make a couple
text: of yards forward and a lot more sideways before the Ram
text: halfback cuts him down from the rear. The Mash team goes
text: into its first huddle.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: (to huddle)
dialog: Okay, don't give them a chance to
dialog: get their breath. Hawkeye wide to
dialog: the right.
text: They are near the sideline to their left, playing a winged T
text: formation. Trapper takes the ball from Vollmer, the center,
text: runs back as if to pass but really gives it to Hawkeye at
text: left half as Hawkeye goes by him in a wide sweep that takes
text: him all the way to the right sideline with the two Cleveland
text: tackles in pursuit.
text: Hawkeye then cuts in quick and tries to get by them but one
text: of them brings him down for a gain of no more than two yards.
text: On the next play Trapper really goes back to pass, but his
text: blockers are of no use against the pro tackles, whom he sees
text: descending on him. Trapper starts running straight back for
text: a while, then makes a dash to the right followed by a dash
text: to the left. He is almost tackled again, and his only route
text: of escape is back toward his own goal line.
speaker_heading: SPEARCHUCKER
dialog: (from the sideline)
dialog: Throw it! Throw it!
text: Faced with a loss of about twenty-five yards, Trapper spots
text: Hawkeye in the area of the line of scrimmage and whips the
text: ball to him.
text: Hawkeye catches it but there are tacklers all around him and
text: he goes down almost immediately for no gain on the play.
dialog: Moving faster than they have to in order not to give the
text: opposition any rest, the team huddles.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: (to huddle)
dialog: Wide to the left. Duke, you're the
dialog: pacesetter this time.
text: They go into action again. This time Trapper, taking the
text: ball from Vollmer, gives it to Duke, who makes a feint at an
text: off-tackle play, then turns back and into a wide end run
text: instead. Duke is still a good ball carrier by college
dialog: standards and he has little trouble shaking off the amateurs
text: who try to tackle him, and is thus able to make it a running
text: duel with the professionals. When they finally nab him, he
text: is no more than two or three yards ahead of the scrimmage
text: line, but the ex-tackles from Cleveland are visibly panting
dialog: and wishing they hadn't allowed all that extra poundage to
text: accumulate. On the fourth down, of course, they have to punt.
text: Duke goes back to receive the ball from Vollmer at center.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Don't try to get it far down. Kick
dialog: it up high so we can get there and
dialog: surround that son-ofa-bitch.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Yeah, if I can.
text: He does a good job of it. The kick is high enough so there
text: are several red jerseys around the Ram halfback when he gets
text: under it.
text: He raises his right arm for a fair catch. The would-be Mash
text: tacklers, including Hawkeye and Trapper are frustrated. They
text: array themselves defensively while their opponents have a
text: huddle and line up to take the offense.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (to Duke and Trapper)
dialog: Let's get him this time. I don't
dialog: think they've got anyone else who
dialog: can carry the ball.
text: As Hawkeye anticipated, the opposing quarterback slips the
text: ball to the Ram halfback, who starts to go wide of the tackle,
text: sees Hawkeye, untouched by blockers, closing in from the
text: outside, and makes his beautiful cross-over to cut back in.
text: At the same time he is hit at the knees by Hawkeye, and high
dialog: by Duke. And there are quite a few other Mash players in the
text: immediate vicinity, Trapper and Ugly John in the forefront,
text: so that a lot of weight is piled up on top of the flashy
dialog: halfback.
text: A close look at Ugly John reveals him to be reaching inside
text: his jersey and under a shoulder pad, from which he extracts
text: a hypodermic needle. With the skill of an expert
text: anesthesiologist he pulls up the sleeve of the tackled and
text: stunned halfback, and plunges the needle into his arm.
text: The Referee meanwhile is indignantly pulling at the Mash
text: players on top of the pile and orally expressing his
dialog: disapproval.
speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: Get off the guy! He's tackled. You
dialog: don't all need to jump on.
text: The Mash players quickly remove themselves. Duke and Hawkeye
text: are the last to get up. Remaining on the ground is the former
text: halfback for the Rams, still firmly clutching the ball but
text: looking as if he needed to get a lot of air into his lungs.
text: His captain, the white pro tackle, takes one look at him and
text: speaks to the Referee.
speaker_heading: 325TH CAPTAIN
dialog: Time! Time!
text: The Referee blows his whistle to stop the clock. The captain
text: waves for assistance from the sidelines, and the trainer and
text: water boy come running in. Radar also appears from the
text: opposite sideline with water for his team. Ugly John takes
text: advantage of his presence to slip the hypodermic he has been
text: concealing in his hand into Radar's pocket.
text: Meanwhile there is agreement in the opposition camp that the
dialog: Ram halfback should go out of the game for a while to rest
text: up. A couple of his teammates assist him to the bench. The
dialog: Mash players observe this.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Well, he's taken care of. Scratch
text: one hot dog.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You really think we hurt him that
dialog: bad?
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: Hell, no, all you did was knock the
dialog: wind out of him. But he won't be
dialog: playing any more football today.

scene_heading: EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD, 325TH EVAC HOSPITAL  DAY
text: The two teams have taken the field again. Hawkeye has switched
text: to left end, Spearchucker replacing him in the backfield.
text: This time General Hammond's men are kicking off to Henry's.
text: It's a long kick but it doesn't go toward the center of the
text: goal line, where Spearchucker is waiting for it, but to Duke,
text: who runs toward Spearchucker and tosses him an easy lateral.
text: The two pro tackles from the Browns run down the field so as
text: to converge on Spearchucker around the Mash twenty-five. But
text: the other Mash players divide themselves into equal units of
text: five to do nothing but take out the two tackles. The other
text: opposing players are no problem for Spearchucker, who runs
text: around or right through them, and crosses their goal line
text: for a touchdown. The ball is brought out for the extra point
text: which Duke scores with a place kick. Before the teams
text: reassemble for the next kickoff, the captain of the 325th
text: team detours a few yards toward his bench and calls something
text: to General Hammond, whose reaction is to stand up and shake
text: his fist in Henry's direction. On the Mash bench, Radar leans
text: over to Henry.
speaker_heading: RADAR
dialog: General Hammond, sir, has just been
dialog: informed about the identity of Captain
dialog: Jones. His ringers recognized our
dialog: ringer.
text: On the field Duke is preparing to kick off.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (to Spearchucker)
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: SPEARCHUCKER
dialog: We may be in trouble, I can't catch
dialog: my breath. I've got the occupational
dialog: disease of oversized ex-athletes.
speaker_heading: TIME LAPSE:
scene_heading: EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD, 325TH EVAC HOSPITAL  DAY
text: Spearchucker is trying to block or intercept a forward pass,
text: but the two tackles from Cleveland still have enough strength
text: left to put him out of action with their combined efforts.
text: They block him so forcibly, in fact, that he drops to the
text: ground and has some trouble getting up. The pass is completed
text: and the receiver tackled on the Mash thirty-five yard line.
speaker_heading: SPEARCHUCKER
dialog: Timeout!
dialog: (to Referee as latter
dialog: blows whistle)
dialog: How much left?
speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: Minute and twenty-five seconds. And
dialog: that's a first down.
text: Radar comes out to the Mash huddle with his water-bucket and
dialog: towels.
speaker_heading: SPEARCHUCKER
dialog: We got to stop them right here.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: And get ourselves another touchdown
dialog: to win.
dialog: (looking to opponents'
dialog: huddle)
dialog: I wish to hell we knew what they
dialog: were plotting.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (getting an idea)
dialog: Radar!
speaker_heading: RADAR
dialog: All you have to do is ask.
dialog: (concentrates on the
dialog: huddle twelve yards
dialog: away)
dialog: The quarterback is saying they'll
text: run the old Statue of Liberty. Their
dialog: left end will come across and take
text: the ball out of his hand and try to
dialog: get around our left end.
speaker_heading: SPEARCHUCKER
dialog: What else?
speaker_heading: RADAR
text: Everyone's talking at once, but now
text: the captain is telling them to shut
dialog: up. The quarterback says, if the
dialog: Statue of Liberty doesn't work,
dialog: they'll go into the double wing with
text: the left halfback taking the handoff
text: first and then slipping it to the
text: right halfback heading to the left.
text: The Referee blows the whistle and the two teams line up to
text: resume action. The 325th Evac quarterback drops back as if
text: to pass, his left end starts to his right, and the whole
text: Mash eleven starts to their left. Only Ugly John finds himself
text: temporarily buried under a 265-pound tackle. The other ten
text: men in red meet the enemy left end after he takes the ball
text: off the quarterback's hand, and they bring him down for a
text: loss. The opposing team goes into another huddle but their
text: strategy remains as Radar overheard it. When the left halfback
text: starts to his right, the Mash players start to their right,
text: and after the right halfback takes over possession and tries
text: to turn in, he finds himself hopelessly outnumbered.
text: Spearchucker hits him first with a tackle so fierce it throws
text: him back five yards and induces him to fumble the ball. A
text: pile of half a dozen MASH players pounces on it, causing
text: some damage to each other.
speaker_heading: SPEARCHUCKER
dialog: (to Referee)
dialog: Time!
text: He goes over to the Referee and exchanges a few words with
text: him, then walks into his team's huddle.
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: (to Spearchucker)
dialog: You got to be the one. We're all
dialog: agreed on that.
speaker_heading: SPEARCHUCKER
dialog: No, it's too far and we're all too
dialog: bushed. I just told the referee we're
dialog: going to try something different. We
dialog: make the center eligible by...
speaker_heading: VOLLMER
dialog: Me? I can't catch a pass.
speaker_heading: SPEARCHUCKER
dialog: You don't have to. We line up with
dialog: everybody to the right of center
text: except Hawkeye, who drops back a
text: yard just before the snap. At the
text: same time Duke moves to the right
text: side of the line.
dialog: (to Vollmer)
dialog: That makes you eligible but all you
dialog: have to do is take the ball right
dialog: back from Trapper between your legs
dialog: and hide it under your belly. Trapper,
dialog: you make like you got the ball, fake
dialog: to me and keep going. One of the big
dialog: guys will hit you, maybe both...
speaker_heading: TRAPPER
dialog: No! I only got my GI insurance.
speaker_heading: SPEARCHUCKER
dialog: (to Vollmer)
dialog: As soon as that happens, Sergeant,
dialog: you start walking, not running to
dialog: their goal line. Remember that, don't
dialog: run! Come on, we just got time!
text: They break out of the huddle and line up as directed, with
text: all the linemen except Hawkeye on Vollmer's right. Their
text: opponents have trouble adjusting to this and are even more
text: confused when, just as Trapper bends down to take the ball
text: from Vollmer, Hawkeye steps back into the backfield and Duke
text: squeezes into the already crowded right line. Returning the
text: ball to Vollmer, Trapper turns his back, fakes a pitchout to
text: Spearchucker, who is racing toward the line, and continues
text: backward, holding himself as if he still had the ball and
text: were fading for a long pass. So successfully does he create
text: this impression that the two tackles from Cleveland, seeing
text: clearly that Spearchucker hasn't received the ball, descend
text: on Trapper with their last burst of energy. Two other orange-
text: and-black linemen also fall on top of him. Meanwhile, Vollmer,
text: holding his arms crossed under his stomach to further hide
text: the ball, and looking as if her were suffering from a painful
text: blow beneath the belt, starts walking down the field at an
text: angle toward his own sideline, making the opposition think
text: he is heading for the bench to seek relief from his injury.
text: Spearchucker stops running at about the enemy thirty, looks
text: back to where Trapper's tacklers are beginning to remove
text: themselves, but also notes out of the corner of his eye that
text: only the opposing safety man is anywhere near Vollmer and
text: that he isn't paying much attention to him.
text: From the bench a frantic Henry looks indignantly at the sight
text: of his center and Sergeant Major coming off the field.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What's going on? What the hell are
dialog: you doing?
text: He opens his arms enough for Henry to see the pigskin cradled
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Then run for God's sake! Run!
text: Vollmer begins to run straight toward the goal line, which
text: has the unfortunate effect of alerting the safety man to
dialog: what is happening.
text: He races across the field to cut Vollmer off. Spearchucker
text: starts into motion at the same instant and gets down there
text: so fast that just as the safety man is tackling Vollmer in a
text: way that would throw him out of bounds on the two-yard line,
text: Spearchucker hurls himself against the safety man with a
text: strong and well-aimed block that sends both men across the
text: goal line.
text: General Hammond runs onto the field in vehement protest.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HAMMOND
dialog: Illegal! Illegal!
text: The Referee, looking at his watch and raising his Army .45
text: to signal the end of the game, goes over to meet the General
text: and explain the sad truth to him.
scene_heading: INT. MASH TEAM'S DRESSING ROOM  DAY
text: Some of the players are partly undressed but most of them
text: are too exhausted to begin that process. Trapper is stretched
text: out on a bench, apparently unconscious. Henry enters

speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as
dialog: Androscoggin... if there is such a

text: A covered Army truck pulls up with the victorious football
dialog: team breaking the normal rule for hospital zones by singing

text: in their hands as they descend to the ground. Hawkeye and
text: Duke are among the first and the noisiest until they notice
dialog: Lapham (the new surgeon we saw the first time during the
text: deluge) standing under the light at the hospital entrance.
text: There is something in his expression that makes them break
text: off their singing abruptly. Trapper and Spearchucker, jumping
text: down after them, react the same way, and their sudden silence
text: affects the others so that in a matter of seconds the singing
text: has died out entirely. Hawkeye and Duke run toward the
text: hospital entrance, Trapper and Spearchucker a little behind
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: BRIEF TIME LAPSE:
