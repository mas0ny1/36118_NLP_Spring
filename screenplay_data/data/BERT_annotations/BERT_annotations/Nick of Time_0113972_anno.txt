scene_heading: INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:06PM
text: Union Station, that gorgeous fifty-year-old monument to Art
text: Deco/California Mission architecture. Still beautiful. Still
dialog: grand.
text: A sign at one of the departure/arrival gates in the main
text: concourse-says the "San Diegan", number 2 64, is due at 12:00.
text: Set above the gates, a big clock - six feet in diameter.
speaker_heading: THE TIME -
dialog: 12:06.
text: We see the big hand slam into "7".
dialog: A loudspeaker - you can just about understand this guy.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: Amtrack 2 64, the San Diegan, from
dialog: San Diego, Del Mar...
scene_heading: EXT. UNION STATION PLATFORM - DAY - 12:06PM
text: The "San Diegan" pulls into the terminal and comes to a slow,
text: grinding stop.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: ...San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano,

scene_heading: INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:07PM
text: A MAN and A WOMAN stand with a view of the arrival doors.
text: He's a blue-collar tough guy, dressed for church. She's his
dialog: beefy counterpart.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: ...Santa Barbara, Lompoc...
text: THE GUY (MR. SMITH) checks his watch.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: ...Santa Maria, San Luis Obispo...
text: Then he looks up to the big clock.
dialog: 12:07.
text: The minute hand slams into the "8".
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
text: ...and points north.
text: He resets his watch as DISEMBARKING PASSENGERS pour out of
text: the gate. PEOPLE run forward with kisses and hugs.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Look sharp.
text: They stand like a couple of rocks, their eyes scanning the
dialog: crowd.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: That one.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Nah. Hates his wife.
text: They're talking about a couple in their forties. She
text: motormouths her way across the terminal and the husband
text: follows with the suitcases.
text: WHOOSH! A couple of TEENAGE BOYS on rollerblades zip by.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: I hate rollerblades.
scene_heading: EXT. UNION STATION - PLATFORM - DAY - 12:08PM
text: The train.. A PRETTY SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL (LYNN) , who is holding
text: a stuffed animal almost as large as she is, climbs down the
text: steps. She reaches the platform, looks around. From within
dialog: the train:
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Lynn! Lynn!!
text: GENE WATSON, thirtyish, a regular Joe in appearance and
text: inclination, appears above, carrying a couple small suitcases.
text: He takes a relieved breath when he sees her.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Lynn, don't walk ahead of me, OK?
text: As he comes down the steps:
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of
dialog: my sight, all right? I want you to
dialog: stay right by me. Will you do that
dialog: for me?
speaker_heading: LYNN
text: Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the
text: platform and gives out an exaggerated
dialog: sigh.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: We made it.
speaker_heading: LYNN nods back.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: We made it.
scene_heading: INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:08PM
text: WHOOSH! A SECURITY GUARD approaches the two ROLLERBLADING
text: TEENS. They circle him, toss off a few taunts and roll away,
text: laughing.
text: MR. SMITH and MS. JONES continue trolling the PASSENGERS as
text: they come through the gate.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: Skate-boarders I don't mind, even
dialog: though they dress like fuckin' idiots,
dialog: but when I see some pin-head on
dialog: rollerblades, I get the definite
dialog: urge to grease the grill of my car
dialog: with 'em.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Keep your eyes peeled.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: What about them?
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Too old.
text: They're talking about a COUPLE IN THEIR SIXTIES, warmly
text: greeting each other.
speaker_heading: MR. JONES
dialog: Him!
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: If you ever had an idea it would die
dialog: of malnutrition. First those blue
dialog: hairs then some Spic. Leave this to
dialog: me. I know people. It's my job. I'm
dialog: a people person.
text: MR. SMITH laughs at his joke.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: What the fuck are you looking for?
text: MR. SMITH has spotted someone.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: I'm looking for them.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Right there.
text: He starts walking towards the exit gate.
scene_heading: INT. UNION STATION -ARRIVAL CONCOURSE - DAY - 12:09PM
text: GENE has emerged with LYNN. They pause there, getting their
text: bearings. Next to them, a YOUNG COUPLE is kissing. They can't
dialog: keep their hands off each other.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I gotta make a phone call, Lynn. Do
dialog: you see a phone?
text: LYNN has seen the YOUNG COUPLE. She secretly points to them,
text: covers her mouth, and does a "tee, hee, hee" number. GENE
dialog: laughs.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Come on, you.
text: They start walking across the concourse, towards MR. SMITH
text: and MS. JONES.
speaker_heading: GENE
speaker_heading: (to LYNN)
dialog: Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss
dialog: like that?
speaker_heading: LYNN
text: On TV.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: You never saw your Mom and me kiss
dialog: like that?
text: LYNN suddenly gets very sad. She looks at the ground, slows
text: down. GENE notices. He stops, crouches down to her level.
text: MR. SMITH and MS. JONES, nearing them, split apart, move
text: around them, and keep going.
speaker_heading: GENE
speaker_heading: (to LYNN)
dialog: Hey, it's OK to talk about her. You
dialog: can talk about her all you want. You
dialog: know that, don't you?
speaker_heading: LYNN nods.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: So, come on. You never saw us kiss
dialog: like that?
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: How did you see us kiss?
text: LYNN gives her own hand a little peck of a kiss.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: That's it? That little peck of a
dialog: kiss? Oh, brother, you missed some
dialog: kisses.
text: LYNN laughs and throws herself on her dad. He holds her to
text: him, looks to the sky for help.. He finds himself staring at
dialog: the big clock.
dialog: 12:10.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Ooh, I'm gonna be late. I gotta call.
scene_heading: INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:10PM
text: MR. SMITH and MS. JONES are making a beeline for their target:
text: the YOUNG KISSING COUPLE.
text: WHOOSH! The-ROLLERBLADING TEENS almost collide with them.
text: MS. JONES wants to do something about it, but MR. SMITH pulls
text: her along. They have a mission to complete. They close in on
dialog: the couple.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Look at 'em. He'd do anything for
dialog: her.-
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: Young love.
text: The couple are murmuring sweet talk between kisses. The words
text: themselves are unclear until MR. SMITH and MS. JONES are
text: only a few feet away. French. They are speaking French. MR.
text: SMITH makes an instant one-eighty turn. MS. JONES follows.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: (sotto voce)
dialog: Foreigners! Fuck!
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and
dialog: when we need their help in Kuwait,
dialog: where the fuck are they?
text: MR. SMITH looks at the partner he's been saddled with.
scene_heading: INT. UNION STATION - PAY PHONE AREA - DAY - 12:10PM
text: GENE has found a pay phone. He keeps an eye on LYNN who has
text: wandered a few yards away.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Hello, is Mr. Conners there? I have
dialog: an interview with him at twelve-
dialog: thirty. Hi, Mr. Conners, this is
dialog: Gene Watson. Sorry to call you at
dialog: the last minute like this but...
dialog: Hey, hey!
text: He reacts to the ROLLERBLADING TEENS who swoop past LYNN,
text: one on each side, too close for a father's comfort.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Watch that! Lynn, come here!
text: She does. He keeps an eye on the TEENS, who, having found a
text: victim, are circling around, passing MR. SMITH and .MS. JONES.
text: MR. SMITH has noticed GENE.
text: GENE at the phone.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Sorry. There's some crazy kids on
dialog: skates. Listen, the train just got
dialog: in, I'm afraid I'm going to be a few
text: minutes late.
text: The TEENS make their pass, flip him the bird, engage in other
text: objectionable behavior, begin to circle again. MR. SMITH
text: watches GENE watch the TEENS, then notice a sturdy, sand-
text: filled ashtray next to him.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Great. OK, I'll get there as soon as
dialog: I can. Bye, now.
text: He hangs up. Keeping one eye on the circling TEENS.
speaker_heading: GENE
speaker_heading: (to LYNN)
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Nods.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Let' s do it.
text: He picks up a suit-case and accidently-on-purpose uses it to
text: knock over the ashtray, just as the TEENS approach. The
text: ashtray spills its Load of sand into their path. When they
text: hit it, their skates stop, they don't. They sprawl, doing
text: nasty things to knees and wrists.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Whoops.
text: He stands over them with LYNN.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Now, see, this is why you should
dialog: always wear a helmet and knee pads.
dialog: You never know when you're going to
dialog: fall down and go boom. Right?
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Right.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON MR. SMITH AND MS. JONES. - 12:11PM
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Perfect.
text: He starts forward.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: (not so sure)
dialog: Perfect.
text: She follows. They intercept GENE. MR. SMITH flashes a badge.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Could I see some identification,
dialog: sir?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: (ditto with the badge)
dialog: I.D. Could we see some?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Uh, sure. What's, what's the problem?
dialog: Will a driver's license do?
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: That'll do just fine.
text: GENE pulls out his wallet, surprised and confused. MR. SMITH
text: looks at it.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Is this about those kids? Look, I'm
dialog: sorry about that. But they darn
dialog: near...
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: Where's that?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Near Lompoc, north. What's...
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Come with us, sir.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I'd like to know what...
speaker_heading: MR."SMITH
dialog: Don't cause a ruckus, sir.
text: He pulls open his coat, putting his hands on his hips, not-
text: so coincidentally revealing the butt of a holstered gun.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: You don't want to cause a ruckus,
dialog: with the little girl and all.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: Come with me, honey.
text: MS. JONES swoops LYNN up and heads for the station entrance.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take
dialog: the girl!
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Don't worry. She's good with kids.
text: GENE hurries after MS. JONES. MR. SMITH grabs up the
text: suitcases.
scene_heading: INT. UNION STATION - SOUVENIR SHOP - DAY - 12:11PM
text: MS. JONES nears a souvenir stand. The OWNER is looking the
text: other way. Without breaking stride, MS. JONES reaches out,
text: snatches a child's coloring book and crayons.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You stole that.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: No, I didn't. I confiscated it.
dialog: There's a difference.
text: And they're out the door, GENE hurrying after. The big hand
text: on the big clock moves.
dialog: 12:12.
scene_heading: EXT. UNION STATION PARKING LOT - DAY - 12:12PM
text: MS. JONES heads for-a van with smoked windows. She gets inside
text: with LYNN. GENE stops a few feet away.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: What is going on?
text: MR. SMITH prods him in the ribs.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
text: Into the van, Mr. Watson. Front seat.
text: GENE looks desperately around for help. There is none. He
text: lets MR. SMITH push him toward the van.
scene_heading: INT. VAN -.DAY - 12:13PM
text: LYNN and MS. JONES are in the back.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: Let's get your seatbelt on. Always
dialog: gotta wear your seatbelt, isn't that
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: LYNN resists.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I want my daddy.
text: GENE climbs into the front passenger seat.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: There's your daddy. See? We're your
dialog: daddy's friends.
text: MR. SMITH climbs into the driver's seat.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: That's right. The policeman is your
dialog: friend. Isn't that right, Daddy?
text: GENE looks down. MR.. SMITH has pulled his gun. He points it
text: casually so it's aiming through the seat in the general
text: direction of the little girl.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Daddy?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: Hey, would you look at this crazy
dialog: car? Everybody has their own radio.
dialog: What do you think of that?
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Everybody does?
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: Yep. And you can listen to it without
dialog: anybody else listening. Let's try it
dialog: out.
text: She puts some ear phones on her. She holds up the plug-in
dialog: end.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: This is what they call the jack. Hi,
dialog: Jack!
speaker_heading: LYNN
text: Laughs.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
text: It goes in that little hole.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Let me do it.
text: She plugs the jack in. MS. JONES turns on the radio. LYNN
text: gets a big smile on her face.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: It's loud!
text: She goes to work, playing with the radio, changing stations,
text: etc., oblivious to all else.
speaker_heading: MS JONES
dialog: Removes a Pro Label Machine from
text: under the seat. She begins to type
dialog: in several characters.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Let's get down to business.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Who are you? You're not the police.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: Brilliant.
text: MS JONES presses PRINT on the Labeller. A strip of plastic
text: emerges that she begins to apply to a Name Tag. He looks
text: back to her. MR. SMITH whacks him on the knee with the gun.
dialog: It hurts.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay
dialog: attention and your daughter won't be
dialog: hurt.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: You wouldn't...
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: Try us.
text: He looks back. She is caressing LYNN's hair.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Get your hands off her.
text: He makes a move. MR. SMITH whacks his knee again, harder.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Mr. Watson, you're not paying
dialog: attention. Your daughter's life
dialog: depends on you. Do you understand
dialog: that?
text: GENE looks from MR. SMITH to MS. JONES and back. He's having
text: a hard time focussing.
text: She slips the NameTag into a manila envelope beside her MR.
dialog: SMITH Do you understand?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Yes, yes, I understand.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Good.
text: He takes the manila envelope from MS JONES, tosses it in
text: GENE'S lap.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: This is for you. In it there is a
text: picture of a woman and an itinerary.
dialog: It is her itinerary. She is presently -
dialog: are you listening, Mr. Watson?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Yes, I'm listening.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
text: She is presently at the Bonaventure
dialog: Hotel. That's right near here.
text: He gestures. GENE looks. The glassy Bonaventure Hotel is
text: glimpsed surrounded by taller, newer high-rises.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: When you leave this van you will get
dialog: yourself a cab and take it to the
dialog: Bonaventure Hotel. Then you will
dialog: take this.
text: MR. SMITH holds up his hand, snaps his fingers. From the
text: back, MS. JONES hands him a cloth-wrapped bundle. He puts it
text: in GENE's hand, shows him what it is: a gun.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: ...and you will kill the woman whose
dialog: picture is in there. Not just shoot
dialog: her, mind,! kill her. I'd recommend
dialog: you empty the gun into her. Close
dialog: up. Got all that?
text: It takes a moment for it all to sink into GENE'S brain.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: You're out of your mind.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: What's your point?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I will do no such thing.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
text: A "snap!" from the back seat. GENE looks. MS. JONES has broken
text: a carrot stick. She breaks another.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: Don't worry. We'll take good care of
dialog: the kid.
text: She gives half the carrot stick to LYNN, pops the other half
text: in her mouth and grinds it to pulp. MR. SMITH is checking
dialog: his watch.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
text: It is now 12:16. If the woman in the
text: picture is alive at 1:30...
text: (holds up a walkie-
dialog: talkie)
dialog: ...I call my partner, your daughter
text: is dead.
text: He looks in the rear-view mirror to MS. JONES.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: And what happens if I don't call
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: I kill her anyway.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Did you hear that, Mr. Watson? Do
dialog: you understand?
text: He taps the manila envelope.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
text: The woman in the picture...
text: He indicates the back seat with his head.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: ...or your daughter.
text: GENE looks at his daughter.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Oh, my God...
text: MR. SMITH reaches over, puts the gun and manila envelope
text: into GENE'S pockets.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only
dialog: you can help her.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: Only you.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: You're wasting time.
text: He reaches across GENE, opens the door and pushes him out,
text: then follows him. LYNN takes off the ear-phones, tries to
text: undo her seatbelt.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Where is my daddy going?
text: MS. JONES wraps a big arm around her.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: He's going to help the police. Your
dialog: daddy is going to be a hero.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: My daddy is going to be a hero? Like
dialog: Power Rangers?
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: Just like Power Rangers.
scene_heading: EXT. UNION STATION PARKING'LOT - DAY - 12:18PM
text: MR. SMITH activates the walkie-talkie, speaks into it.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Let's test this thing. You on?
text: He holds it up for GENE to hear.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES (O.S.)
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Reading you.
text: MR. SMITH still has GENE'S wallet. He opens it, pulls out
text: some cash, puts it in GENE's breast pocket.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: You'11 need some cash.
dialog: (re: the wallet)
dialog: I'll hang onto this for the time
dialog: being. Oh, and...
text: He grabs one of GENE's hands.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: You'll need these.
text: He dumps six bullet's into GENE's palm from a cloth Chivas
text: Regal bag.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Get moving, Mr. Watson. Time's a
dialog: wastin'.
text: GENE just stands there, transfixed by the bullets in his
text: hand. MR. SMITH reaches out, turns him around and gives him
text: a shove away from the van and into the midst of...
scene_heading: EXT. UNION STATION - PARKING LOT - BUS STOP - DAY - 12:19PM
text: ...a LARGE CROWD OF TOURISTS, that have just exited an
text: arriving mini-bus. GENE is caught up in the crowd and carried
text: along like a leaf in a stream.
text: Amid the chattering CROWD, GENE is pushed along as if in a
text: trance. He touches the pocket with the gun. He looks at the
text: Bullets in his hand, then at the people around him. It's
text: like a splash of cold water. He quickly pockets the bullets,
text: turns and pushes against the tide of tourists. They resist
text: him, pushing him along until he breaks free and can see...
dialog: The van is gone!
scene_heading: ANGLE ON GENE -- 12:19PM
text: He stands there, a lost man. Fear sweeps over him. He looks
text: desperately around. He is within himself, oblivious to his
text: surroundings, his mind racing, his face a tangle of emotions.
text: He is a man alone in a crowd. He takes a step.
text: A LITTLE LATINO GIRL, chased by HER BROTHER, runs into GENE'S
text: legs. He instinctively grabs her before she can fall, finds
text: himself, crouched down, holding her by the arms. His heart
text: plunges - she isn't Lynn. His intensity scares her.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: Mama!
text: She pulls away, flees to HER MOTHER, who hoists her up,
text: reprimanding her in Spanish. GENE stays crouched, watching
text: the LITTLE GIRL staring at him over HER MOTHER'S shoulder.
text: Until a COP crosses his line of sight. A LOS ANGELES TRANSIT
text: POLICEMAN, foot-patrolling the station.
text: It's like a gift from above. Relief floods GENE's face. He
text: is saved. He stands, hurries toward the COP, each step more
dialog: confident.
text: Then, just beyond the COP, MR. SMITH casually slides into
text: view, pointedly holding the walkie-talkie. GENE walks right
text: past the COP heading towards a cab stand. MR. SMITH falls in
text: behind him speaking in his ear.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: You talk to a cop, you even look at
dialog: a cop too long and your daughter is
dialog: dead.
dialog: (into walkie-talkie)
dialog: Do it.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES (O.S.)
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Go ahead, sugar Die.
speaker_heading: LYNN (V.O.)
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Lynn calling Daddy. Lynn calling
dialog: Daddy. Come in, Daddy.

speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Lynn!
speaker_heading: LYNN (V.O.)
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: I can hear you good. Can you hear
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Yes. Yes, I can hear you.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: That's enough.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES (V.O.)
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: 'Daddy has to go now.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: He has to say "over and out". Daddy,
dialog: you have to say "over and out".
speaker_heading: GENE
text: Over and out.
text: MR. SMITH clicks off the walkie-talkie.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Look at your watch. Look at it! At
dialog: one-thirty your little girl is dead.
dialog: Say it with me. At one-thirty my
dialog: little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: At one thirty my little girl is dead.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Unless you do what you're told. Go
dialog: do it!
text: He pushes GENE on, toward a cab.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: And don't forget I'll be watching
dialog: you.
text: GENE looks back at him, full of impotent rage. MR. SMITH
text: raises the walkie-talkie. GENE reaches the first cab at the
dialog: stand.
scene_heading: EXT. UNION STATION - CAB STAND - DAY - 12:21PM
text: The CABBIE, talking to ANOTHER DRIVER, throws away his
text: cigarette, ambles over to the Driverside-of the cab.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Where to, sir?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure
dialog: Hotel. Do you know where that is?
text: The CABBIE is disappointed, but he nods and GENE gets into
dialog: the cab.
scene_heading: INT. CAB - DAY - 12:21PM
text: The CABBIE gets in and they take off. GENE stares at the
text: manila envelope in his hand. He starts to open it, is stopped
dialog: by:
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Amtrack?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: You just come in on Amtrack?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Uh, yes..
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Business or pleasure?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Business.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Where'd you come from?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: San Diego.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Oh, San Diego? I've thought about
dialog: moving to San Diego. It's hard to
dialog: make a living in this town. These
dialog: short hops. Can't make a dime on
dialog: 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can
dialog: make a buck. These little hops cost
dialog: me money.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: 'S okay. What do you think?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Better in San Diego? More opportunity
dialog: there? What?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I really don't know. I don't live
dialog: there. I was just visiting...a grave.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Aw, too bad.
text: They lapse into silence. GENE starts to open the envelope
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Somebody close?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: The grave. Somebody close?

dialog: divorce.
text: GENE notices the dashboard clock -
dialog: 12:22
text: GENE leans forward.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Look...I've... I've got a problem. A
dialog: big problem...
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Oh, yeah?
text: He hits the horn and swerves to the left.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Jesus! Watch it, buddy!
scene_heading: EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - DAY - 12:22PM
text: GENE looks out his window and finds himself staring at MR.
text: SMITH, staring back at him, driving the van, next to him. He
text: throws himself back in the seat.
scene_heading: INT. CAB - DAY - 12:22PM
text: The cab pulls into the drive front of the Bonaventure Hotel
text: and stops.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: I'd love to hear about your problem,
text: but the ride's over. Three-fifty.
text: GENE looks out the back window, watches the van pulls up to
text: the curb on the other side of the street.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Three-fifty. I hope your problem
dialog: doesn't have anything to do with my
dialog: three-fifty.
text: GENE looks back at the CABBIE, waiting for his fare.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Right. Right.
text: GENE digs through his pockets and comes up with one of his
text: business cards. He hurriedly writes on it: "HELP. VAN KIDNAP
text: CHILD." He wraps a five around it, pushes it into the CABBIE'S
text: hand, gives him a meaningful look and gets out of the cab.
scene_heading: EXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - DAY - 12:23PM
text: GENE stops a few yards from the cab, watching the CABBIE.
scene_heading: INT. CAB - DAY - 12:23PM
text: The CABBIE finds the secreted card, but looks at the wrong
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: What do I want with an accountant?
text: A DOORMAN leans down at the window.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: I got one for the airport. You free?
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: You bet.
text: The DOORMAN plants a PASSENGER in the cab. As he pulls away,
text: the CABBIE again glances at the business card, crumples it
dialog: up.
scene_heading: EXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - DAY - 12:23PM
text: GENE watches the cab leave. As it exits, the CABBIE's arm
text: snakes out and tosses the card in the trash. GENE knows what
text: it is. He looks around.
text: VALETS, BELLMEN, ARRIVALS and DEPARTEES, cars coming and
text: going. No one pays particular attention to him.
text: GENE looks at the van across the street. MR. SMITH gets out
text: and walks across the street towards him. The van drives away.
text: GENE watches the van disappear around the corner, desperately
text: hanging onto the last glimpse of it.
text: MR. SMITH takes the walkie-talkie out of his pocket. GENE
text: goes into the hotel.
scene_heading: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM
text: GENE enters. It's like another world. A busy, humming, air-
text: conditioned planet. PEOPLE hustle around the restaurants,
text: waterfalls - a definite ant farm ambiance.
scene_heading: HIGH DOWN ANGLE ON GENE - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM
text: Suddenly we have cut to a VIDEO IMAGE of Gene looking around
text: this Hotel, complete with scrolling TIME AND DATE. Shot by
text: someone high above.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON GENE - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM
text: GENE is bumped and buffeted about by the bustling crowd. He
text: breaks free to a clear spot, looks up and freezes. Then he
text: starts tracking all around him, seeing...something.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Oh, my God. Oh, no.
text: He desperately fumbles in his pocket.
text: Facing and above him, some WORKMEN ON LADDERS are securing a
text: huge, rolled up banner.
text: GENE finds what he's looking for - the manila envelope. He
text: rips it open. As he pulls out the photograph that is inside,
text: the WORKMEN let their banner unfurl. We do a simultaneous
text: reveal. The woman in the photograph in the envelope is the
text: same as depicted on the banner. Written across the bottom of
dialog: it in your best red, white, and blue:
scene_heading: "RE-ELECT ELEANOR SAMARA GRANT GOVERNOR"
dialog: And an addendum:
dialog: "HERE TODAY!"
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Oh, shit.
text: It dawns on him. He looks around him again. This time we see
text: what he sees. Campaign posters and banners everywhere.
text: On some of them she is posed with a handsome man, several
dialog: years her junior. These have the caption, "Governor Grant
dialog: and husband Brendan".
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Oh, sweet Jesus...
text: His eyes fall on MR. SMITH, standing inside the entrance,
text: walkie-talkie in hand, watching him.
text: GENE looks at a poster, at MR. SMITH, who smiles, nods and
text: gives GENE a move of the head - "Get to it."
text: GENE shoves the photograph away as if it could incriminate
text: him, then slides out the itinerary.
text: The itinerary says "California Educators' Association - 12:00
dialog: noon - Emerald Bay Room - Opening Address - Governor Eleanor
dialog: Samara Grant".
text: GENE checks his watch.
dialog: 12:26.
text: He looks around him at the confusion and spots a Bellboy,
text: GUSTINO, who's cleaning out ashtrays.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Could you tell me where the Emerald
dialog: Bay Room is?
text: GUSTINO points up.
speaker_heading: GUSTINO
dialog: Third floor. Yellow stairwell. Follow
dialog: the signs.
text: GENE turns away without a word, starts to walk, then turns
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.
text: GUSTINO smiles.
speaker_heading: GUSTINO
dialog: No problem.
scene_heading: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - "YELLOW STAIRWELL" - DAY - 12:26PM
text: GENE mounts a set of stairs that will take him to the third
text: floor. MR. SMITH follows him as he climbs.
scene_heading: INT. "YELLOW STAIRWELL" - DAY - 12:2 6PM
text: The whole lobby and entrance of the hotel are seen as Gene
text: ascends.
text: GENE forces himself not to look at MR. SMITH behind him. His
text: nerves are rising in anticipation of his destination.
scene_heading: INT. THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 12:26PM
text: GENE sees the arrow and sign for the Emerald Bay Room. He
text: walks that way. MR. SMITH follows.
scene_heading: INT. THIRD FLOOR - SHOP ARCADE AREA - DAY - 12:27PM
text: GENE and MR. SMITH pass gift shops, snack bars. The walkway
text: is crowded and GENE is going against the tide of REPORTERS,
text: POLITICIANS, SUPPORTERS, and just a lot of PEOPLE WITH NAME
speaker_heading: TAGS.
text: GENE plows on through...
text: ...and runs smack into BRENDAN GRANT.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Whoops!
text: The two men reel back from each other. A SECURITY MAN,
text: earphones and gray suit, steps immediately between them.
text: BRENDAN GRANT is a charmingly smooth man.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: Nice body check.
text: He continues on, talking to an ATTRACTIVE WCMAN COMPANION.
dialog: BRENDAN GRANT What the Governor really admires, Mrs. Wentzel,
dialog: and Eleanor has said this to me on more than one occasion,
dialog: are pecple like you who take a personal tragedy and turn it
text: into a positive force.
text: He slides a familiar hand around her waist.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: You know my wife has a deeply personal
dialog: reason for going after repeat drunk
dialog: drivers. They are felons and they
dialog: should be treated as such. A drivers
dialog: license is a privilege, not a right.
text: And he is hustled away. Right past an election poster
text: featuring him and Governor Grant.
text: Still stunned by the encounter, GENE turns back and watches
text: the Governor's husband, but keeps walking.
scene_heading: INT. EMERALD BAY ROOM - DAY - 12:28PM
text: It is emptying, that's where the crowd came from. GENE comes
dialog: in.
text: A WOMAN is heading for the door with a centerpiece she's
dialog: just copped.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Excuse me, is the...thing over?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Yes. You didn't miss much. The
dialog: food...chicken again.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Eleanor Grant is gone?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Yes. Nice speech. But it's the same
dialog: at all these...
text: But GENE has turned away. The WOMAN gives him a face, grabs
text: another centerpiece and exits. A CLEAN-UP CREW is starting
text: to go through the room. GENE leans against a wall, breathing
text: through a combination of relief and agony.
text: MR. SMITH is suddenly next to him.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Check your itinerary. Move along.
dialog: GENE gets out the itinerary. "12:30 - 12:45 - Hors d'oeuvres/
scene_heading: Buffet w/Friends of Eleanor Samara Grant - INVITATION ONLY -
dialog: Bona Vista Lounge".
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: This says "invitation only".
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Of course you're invited. You're a
dialog: big donor to the campaign. They love
dialog: you.
text: MR SMITH digs into the manila envelope, comes out with a
text: handful of security badges, name tags, invites. He plucks
text: the name tag that MS JONES printed earlier. It has a red
text: ribbon signifying a Major Donor to the Campaign. He fastens
text: it to Gene's lapel.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: This'11 get you in anywhere. Red
text: Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Where did you get these? Who are
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: I'm the guy who's going to kill your
dialog: daughter if you don't get moving.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY ENTRANCE TO THE "RED" ELEVATOR - DAY - 12:28PM
text: GENE approaches. He notices a flurry of movement, a small
text: GROUP OF PEOPLE moving determinedly through the lobby. It is
text: GOVERNOR ELEANOR GRANT with a small entourage! She is a
text: handsome woman in her fifties. The entourage consists of
text: KRISTA BROOKS, Eleanor's, late-twenties assistant, a few
text: assorted POLITICAL AIDES and a couple of PEOPLE WITH NAME
text: TAGS. GENE is not sure what to do. The group reaches the
text: elevator. KRISTA pushes the button.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: They-didn't hear a word I said. The
text: mike was too low on the podium.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: How much did we pay for that room?
speaker_heading: CHIEF AIDE
dialog: We didn't.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: Somebody did.
text: KRISTA turns to an Aide.
speaker_heading: KRIST
dialog: A Have Nolin pre-check the PA systems.
text: The elevator doors open. They crowd in. The doors start to
dialog: close.
dialog: Gene looks around, where did Mr. Smith go?
text: GENE springs forward, thrusts his hand between them. The
text: doors stop, then bounce open. GENE is startled, finding
text: himself face to face with a cold eyed bodyguard.
speaker_heading: BODYGUARD
dialog: Excuse me, sir, this car is for the
dialog: Governor. You can take the next one.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: Don't you dare, Franco. This is one
dialog: of our biggest supporters.
text: She smiles charmingly, offers her hand to GENE.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial
dialog: incumbent. That's a mouthful isn't-
dialog: it? I love saying that.
text: GENE steps aboard, shakes her hand.
scene_heading: INT. "RED ELEVATOR" - DAY - 12:29PM
text: The elevator begins to rise.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: Whose idea was it to have a lunch
dialog: right after the brunch? I'm about to
dialog: bust as it is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: We'll just walk through, do a little
dialog: grip-and-grin, then get ready for
dialog: the press con.
scene_heading: INSERT FLOOR INDICATOR
text: We are on the third floor.
text: The doors have closed and the elevator begins to rise.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Governor...
text: It comes out a little louder then he intended. He has turned,
text: his back to the door. Everyone looks at him. He's committed.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I need your help.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Its'...ah...about my daughter....
text: The elevator slows and stops on the next floor above.
scene_heading: INSERT FLOOR INDICATOR
text: We are on the fourth floor.
text: Behind GENE, the doors open.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH (O.S.)
dialog: Room for one more?
text: GENE freezes.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: I think we can accommodate you.
text: She offers her hand to MR. SMITH as he steps on board.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial
dialog: incumbent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: A pleasure to meet you, Governor.
text: The car begins to rise again. ELEANOR .GRANT turns back to
speaker_heading: GENE.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: You were saying? Your daughter....?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: Yes?
scene_heading: ANGLE ON MR SMITH
dialog: Yes???
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON GENE
dialog: What to do now?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure
dialog: to get your autograph.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: Of course. I wish everything were
dialog: that easy.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: I've got the pen if you've got the
dialog: paper.
text: GENE looks at her. She smiles back.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: How about that?
text: He looks at what she refers to: the manila envelope he holds,
text: the one MR. SMITH gave him.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: Is that something precious?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: No, that's,..that's fine
dialog: 
text: He gives it to ELEANOR GRANT. KRISTA hands over the pen.
text: GENE's eyes flick over to MR. SMITH who is staring at the
dialog: envelope.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: What's her name?
text: GENE looks at the Governor, only inches away, back to MR.
text: SMITH, who raises his eyes, nods, his silent message curt -
text: do it! GENE pulls his eyes away.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Her name? Her name is Lynn.
text: ELEANOR GRANT writes the autograph. MR. SMITH'S eyes drill
text: into him. GENE looks over. MR. SMITH raises a hand to his
text: face, pretends to scratch an itch. His other hand taps his
text: wristwatch. GENE's hand slides toward his jacket pocket.
text: Sweat beads on his forehead. He's barely aware of KRISTA
text: talking to him.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: It's funny. I don't even keep a pad
dialog: of paper with me anymore, everything's
dialog: gone so electronic.
text: He gives her a quick, weak smile. His free hand wipes the
text: sweat from his face.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: If it wasn't for double A batteries
dialog: I'd be in big trouble.
text: He is slowly reaching into the pocket with the gun, but stops
text: when he notices MR. SMITH'S hand slide into his jacket, where
text: his gun is.
text: He looks at the other MR. SMITH, earphone, crewcut-Security.
text: There is the hint of a gun on his hip.
text: GENE's eyes widen, dart to MR. SMITH'S face, his hand sliding
text: into his coat. His hand hovers over his gun, trembling. Is
text: the SECURITY MAN staring at him?
text: ELEANOR GRANT hands over the autograph.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: Are you all right? Elevators make me
dialog: queasy, too.
text: GENE gives her a sick smile, abruptly turns away. He takes
text: his hand out of his pocket. It's shaking. He clenches it to
dialog: stop the shakes.
text: The doors open, startling him.
scene_heading: INT. THIRTY-FIFTH FLOOR - DAY - 12:2 9PM
text: ELEANOR GRANT and her entourage exit to greetings and
dialog: applause.
text: GENE stays in the elevator, frozen, alone with MR. SMITH.
text: The doors close and the elevator descends.
scene_heading: INT. "RED ELEVATOR" - DAY - 12:29PM
text: MR. SMITH is fuming, his face red. He explodes.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: She was right in front of you! What's
dialog: wrong with you!?
text: His fists clench. He seems about to lose control. He backs
text: GENE into a corner, physically terrified.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Are you 'fucking with me!?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: The gun...
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: What about the gun?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the
text: bullets in it.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: You...
text: He raises a fist. Struggles with the impulse to smash GENE,
text: controls it. Angrily, he takes the gun from GENE's pocket,
text: expertly loads it with bullets from his own pocket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: You won't get many chances like that,
dialog: Mr. Watson. That's the way life works.
dialog: Don't blow the next one.
text: He indicates the glass,wall of the elevator with his eyes.
text: GENE looks out and down.
speaker_heading: GENE'S POV
text: The van. It's moving into a parking spot across from the
text: Bonaventure, on Flower Street.
scene_heading: INT. THE VAN - DAY - 12:29PM
text: LYNN is coloring a picture in her stolen book. MS. JONES
text: takes a look.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: That's pretty good.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I've done much better ones than this.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: You have, huh?
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much
text: more colors at home.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: That's good.
dialog: (checks her watch)
dialog: That's good, sweetie pie.
scene_heading: INT. RED ELEVATOR - DAY - 12:29PM
text: The elevator continues its descent and the van disappears
text: from view. GENE strains to see it again, but it's impossible.
text: MR. SMITH jams the loaded gun into GENE's pocket.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: There, all loaded. Ready for the
dialog: hunt.
text: The elevator, doors open into the lobby.
scene_heading: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - YELLOW ELEVATOR LOBBY -
speaker_heading: DAY - 12:29PM
text: MR. SMITH walks out. GENE follows. MR. SMITH, suddenly becomes
text: self-conscious, walks away from GENE. The object of his
text: shyness: A JAPANESE TOURIST COUPLE nearby. The man is taping
text: his wife with a video camera.
scene_heading: VIEW THROUGH VIDEO CAMERA - 12:31PM
text: We see what the camera is seeing, the WIFE, smiling. Behind
text: her, we see GENE, looking confusedly after Mr. Smith. He
text: turns, walks out of frame. In the corner of the picture, a
dialog: read-out of the TIME:
text: 12:31:00.
scene_heading: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 12:31PM
text: Back in real life, GENE walks toward a shoeshine stand outside
text: the Men's Room. "Huey's Polished Act" and below that, hand-
text: lettered, "Disabled Veteran" where HUEY himself, a fiftyish
text: black man, reads a "Smithsonian" magazine.
text: He sees GENE and perks up - a customer.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Having a rough day? Down at the heels
dialog: as they...?
text: But GENE goes right past HUEY and into the Men's Room.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: (calling after him)
dialog: You don't see your face, you don't
dialog: pay!
text: HUEY gives up, goes back to his magazine.
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S ROOM. - DAY - 12:31PM
text: Gene goes- over to one of the sinks, runs the cold water,
text: splashes his face, looks in the mirror, into his own eyes.
text: He tries to find an answer, a way out. A pay phone, on the
text: wall behind him, comes into focus. Then a hand reaches in,
text: grabs the receiver...and yanks it, snapping the wire. Gene
text: spins around. It is MR. SMITH, of course.
dialog: 
text: MR. SMITH smiles. GENE doesn't. MR. SMITH leaves.
scene_heading: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY
text: GENE exits the Men's Room and walks back the route he came.
scene_heading: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 12:32PM
text: HUEY sets down his magazine again.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Having a rough day? Down at the heels
dialog: as they say? What you need is a shoe
dialog: shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today.
text: It's HUEY's usual patter, he's said it a thousand times.
text: GENE looks around.
text: MR. SMITH is in the lounge area, facing the Flower Street
text: entrance, able to keep the Men's Room and GENE in view.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Take ten, take a break, take a seat,
dialog: take a load off. Put the world in
dialog: perspective.
text: GENE lets HUEY usher him into a chair.
text: The gun in his jacket pocket clunks against the arm of the
text: chair. A grim reminder. He pulls out the itinerary.
speaker_heading: ECU - ITINERARY
text: 12:45 - Governor Eleanor Samara Grant - Pacific Rim
dialog: Multi-Cultural Conference - Pool Deck - Fourth Floor
text: GENE looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: ECU WATCH
dialog: 12:32.
text: The minute hand clicks to 12:33 as he watches.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON HUEY - 12:33PM
text: He works away at GENE's shoes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: So, are you a visitor or lucky enough
dialog: to live in The City of Angels?
text: It's more of HUEY's patter, no real substance to the inquiry.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I'm...I'm visiting.
text: GENE watches MR. SMITH frown and amble toward the shoeshine
dialog: stand.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: What do you do, if I may be so bold?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: (looking at MR. SMITH)
dialog: I'm just an accountant.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Don't denigrate yourself, my friend.
dialog: Where would the government be without
dialog: accountants? They wouldn't know how
dialog: hard they can squeeze us before we
dialog: pop, isn't that right?
scene_heading: ANGLE ON MR. SMITH - 12:33PM
text: He takes note of the conversation and wanders back to his
dialog: chair.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON HUEY - 12:33PM
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Now you take tips. Time was a tip
text: was between a man and his customer.
dialog: Not any more. They've figured out
dialog: what they call a formulae, don't
dialog: laugh, it ain't for babies. They
dialog: take your sales, see, and slap a
dialog: percentile on there, figuring that
dialog: somewhere between your lies and your
dialog: bad luck they'll hit on the mean
dialog: amount, mean meaning "in the middle",
dialog: but if you ask me it means "just
dialog: plain mean". Why you can have Uncle
dialog: Scrooge wring a nickel over your
dialog: poor out-stretched palm, or Daddy
text: Warbucks dropping pearl stick-pins
dialog: like manna from heaven, don't make
dialog: no difference, they'll tax your behind
dialog: according to that same figure. Doesn't
dialog: seem quite right., does it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: No. No, it doesn't.
text: The Bellboy GUSTINO walks by, calls out to HUEY.
speaker_heading: GUSTINO
dialog: Hey, Huey, how's it hangin'?
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: It's a load, my friend, but somebody's
dialog: got to carry it.
text: GUSTINO laughs, waves.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I have to do something.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: What's that? You have to speak up.
dialog: (taps his ear)
dialog: I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between
dialog: that and my wooden leg I'm a mess.
dialog: Compliments of the United States
dialog: Army Artillery Corps.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I said I have to do something.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: I'll have you out of here in two
dialog: shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Is within himself.
dialog: GENE I keep wondering what she would do if she was here.
text: She'd figure it out. She'd run it down like a column of
dialog: numbers. Pro's and cons. That's the way she was: Lists all
text: over the house.
text: HUEY's manic shoe-shining slows down: who has he got in his
dialog: chair?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Drove me crazy. There must have been
dialog: one on me. I didn't add up so she
dialog: left. That's what attracted me to
dialog: her In the first place. She made up
dialog: her mind and she did it. She wouldn't
dialog: sit around waiting for...whatever.
dialog: She'd do something. She'd do
dialog: something.
text: HUEY keeps his eyes on his work. He's afraid he's got a live
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Yes, well, you know, for a quality
dialog: shoe you can't beat a good wingtip.
dialog: Wears like iron. You're a wise man.
dialog: There ya' go. Two bucks.
text: HUEY gestures for GENE to get down. GENE steps to the floor.
text: He pays HUEY with a twenty.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: You got anything smaller?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Keep it.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: It's a twenty.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Keep it.
text: GENE is thinking about something.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Well...thanks muchly...
text: GENE looks around the lobby, at MR. SMITH, the Flower Street
text: entrance, the rest of the area, feeling the gun in his pocket.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Can I get out to Flower Street from
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you
dialog: right out there.
text: HUEY nods toward the bar.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Thanks.
text: GENE walks toward the bar. HUEY shakes his head: time for
text: the boys in white.
scene_heading: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:35PM
text: GENE looks towards the Flower Street entrance. The van is
text: still there. A bus pulls up.
text: GENE walks past MR. SMITH.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: You get another chance in ten minutes.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Then I have time for a drink.
text: He heads up to the bar.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: All right, Mr. Watson, but make it
dialog: just one. I don't want you...
text: But GENE is long gone.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BAR AREA - DAY - 12:3 6PM
text: GENE walks into the area of the bar. The BARTENDER is just
text: returning to chat with a customer, a REPORTER who is getting
text: sloshed. GENE moves slowly along the bar, into an area where
text: MR. SMITH'S view of him is blocked.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: So where was I?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: I don't know. Something about the
dialog: Governor's new regime.
text: GENE hears this and glances towards them.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Oh yeah. She's dumping the Good Old
dialog: Boys like yesterday's newspapers.
text: GENE sees that MR.SMITH can no longer see him. He scans the
text: lobby, sees a smaller door that leads onto Flower Street.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: The white boys are in for it. When
dialog: they got her elected they never
dialog: thought she was gonna make the
text: Governor's office look like the United
dialog: Nations.
text: The BARTENDER laughs. GENE quickly cuts across the lobby and
text: out the smaller door onto Flower Street.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: We're talking Custer's Last Stand
dialog: here. The only minorities not on her
dialog: staff are the ones still lost in the
dialog: Rain Forest.
scene_heading: EXT. FLOWER STREET - DAY - 12:3 6PM
text: GENE comes out the door, dashes across the street, weaving
text: through the traffic.
text: Once across, he heads up the sidewalk toward the van, keeping
text: low, sneaking up behind it. He crouches by the front door,
text: one hand sliding into his pocket for the' gun, the other -on
text: the door handle. He raises his head cautiously and looks
text: inside the cab.
text: No MS. JONES up front at least. He takes a breath, braces
text: himself. With one motion he jerks the back door open, yanks
text: out the gun.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - DAY - 12:37PM
text: The first thing he sees, fixates on, is LYNN. She is stretched
text: out on the seat, eyes closed, mouth open. She appears dead.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: (a gasp)
dialog: Lynn!
speaker_heading: MS. JONES (O.S.)
dialog: Shhh. You'll wake the baby up.
text: MS. JONES is sitting on the seat behind the one LYNN is on.
text: GENE points the gun at her face. She smiles.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: (softly)
dialog: What we have here is what they call
dialog: a Mexican standoff. The thing you
dialog: gotta ask yourself is, "What's behind
dialog: the seat?" Now, a twenty-two'd go
text: right through it, but even a button
dialog: will throw a twenty-two off so there's
dialog: a good chance it'd get screwed up
dialog: somewhere along the way, miss the
dialog: target. Maybe a thirty-eight? A
dialog: thirty-eight'11 drill pretty straight,
dialog: unless it hits metal, then it'll
text: bust up in little bitty pieces.
dialog: They'll keep going but they'll be
dialog: slowed down quite a bit. How's about
dialog: a three-fifty-seven? It'll go through
dialog: the seat, her, you, the dashboard,
dialog: shit, it'll go through the engine
dialog: block before it knows it's hit
dialog: anything, end up in some pedestrian
dialog: three blocks away. What do you think?
dialog: What's my poison?
text: GENE look at Lynn's sleeping face - the gun in his own hand.
text: He lowers the gun, defeated.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: Well it's a comfort to know you've
dialog: got the co-Jones to pull that thing
dialog: out. Whether you've got the balls to
dialog: pull the trigger we've still got to
dialog: see.
scene_heading: EXT. FLOWER STREET - DAY
text: GENE climbs out of the van, shuts the door, leans there. The
text: gall of his defeat is hard to swallow. He realizes he's
text: holding the gun, hurriedly tucks it away.
scene_heading: INT. THE VAN - DAY - 12:38PM
text: MS. JONES puts her gun down, raises a walkie-talkie.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: (into the walkie-talkie)
text: He's coming back in.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: I've got him in the crosshairs.
scene_heading: INT. BUFFET AREA - DAY - 12:38PM
text: MR. SMITH near the entrance, eating some food. He watches
text: GENE walk past him. Their eyes meet.
scene_heading: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:39PM
text: GENE looks at his watch, then checks the itinerary once more.
speaker_heading: ECU - ITINERARY

scene_heading: ANGLE ON GENE-NEAR BUFFET AREA - 12:39PM

speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Pool Deck?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Fourth Floor. Take that escalator.
text: GENE thanks him and moves across the lobby MR. SMITH follows
speaker_heading: GENE
scene_heading: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - BAR AREA - DAY - 12:39PM
text: GENE heads toward the escalators. Ahead of him, he sees
text: ELEANOR GRANT and BRENDAN GRANT surrounded by AIDES and
text: SECURITY MEN facing a crowd of PRESS PEOPLE. The Governor
text: and her husband have an arm around each other. They are
text: smiling, relaxed, quite the" happy couple. They give each
text: other a warm kiss. Camera flashes, recording the moment.
text: GENE, heading toward them, has to thread his way through a
text: large WEDDING PARTY - tuxedos and bridesmaid gowns. When he
text: clears them he has neared the impromptu press conference.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BRENDAN GRANT - 12:3 9PM
text: He is now alone in front of a campaign poster, fielding
text: questions from a few remaining REPORTERS.
text: Farther on, ELEANOR GRANT and her entourage can be seen taking
text: the escalator up. GENE heads that way, passing BRENDAN GRANT.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: My wife is not interested in negative
dialog: campaigning. She wants to accentuate
dialog: the positive. I don't know about you
dialog: but I find that refreshing.
speaker_heading: A REPORTER
dialog: Have you ever thought of running for
dialog: office yourself?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: (smiles, charmingly)
dialog: Me?
text: A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN walks by. The Governor's husband's eyes
text: follow her appreciatively as he says:
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: I'm just a business man.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON GENE - 12:40PM
text: He nears the escalator. It's crowded and GENE is pulled into
text: the midst of NEWS PEOPLE, TV, RADIO, PRESS. He joins the
text: flow and lets it pull him along.
text: GENE rides the escalator to the Second Floor and follows the
text: crowd up two flights of the circular stairs.
text: Down a short tunnel and out onto the Pool Deck.
scene_heading: EXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - POOL, DECK - HIGH ANGLE - 12:41PM
text: About an acre of grass on the Fourth Floor. Skyways connect
text: the Pool Deck to the office buildings across Flower and
text: Figueroa. A platform has been set up with chairs and
text: microphones in front of a podium.
scene_heading: EXT. POOL DECK - CLOSE ANGLE ON GENE - 12:41PM
text: GENE blinks in the sudden, bright sunshine. When his eyes
text: adjust, he finds himself in a line that is approaching A
text: SECURITY MAN with a hand-held metal detector. He panics,
text: turns, trying to escape, but finds himself bumped along,
text: trapped. The line shuffles forward. He turns, determined to
text: make a supreme effort to escape and finds himself facing a
text: 2ND SECURITY MAN, who waves him to one side.
scene_heading: 2ND SECURITY MAN Excuse me, sir, You don't have to wait. I
dialog: can take you over here.
text: GENE is dragged forward. He looks around; no way out. He
text: stands, expectant, as the detector slides down one side of
text: his body, is lifted over to the other. Down it slides, toward
text: the pocket concealing the gun. GENE waits for the alarm -
text: which doesn't come. The SECURITY MAN operating the gizmo
text: deftly switches it off as it passes the weapon. GENE is pushed
text: on, looking back, confused, alarmed, finds himself among:
text: PRESS by the dozens. Eleanor Samara Grant SUPPORTERS by the
text: hundreds. SECURITY MEN and COPS IN UNIFORM. GENE moves through
text: them, trying to figure out what just happened. He glances
text: back to the 2ND SECURITY MAN, and bumps into one particular
text: POLICE OFFICER, plain clothes, badge in pocket, who reacts
text: with a quick laugh.
dialog: POLICE OFFICER Easy, sir. Got to watch where you're going in
dialog: a crowd like this.
dialog: He is a handsome, solid-looking guy. You'd trust him. Call
text: him OFFICER TRUST. OFFICER TRUST seems to be in charge. He
text: moves off through the crowd, giving LOCAL POLICE orders in
dialog: an easy way.
text: GENE looks around. He can't see MR. SMITH. He edges his way
text: after OFFICER TRUST, who reaches the wall beyond which is
text: the drop to the street. He leans there comfortably, scanning
text: the crowd, GENE reaches the wall a few yards away from him.
text: He looks out at the city, getting his courage up. Just as he
text: turns to approach OFFICER TRUST:
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH (O.S.)
dialog: I know what you're thinking.
text: GENE freezes! MR. SMITH appears from the crowd, joins him.
text: He smugly flips his walkie-talkie into the air, catches it.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: What would you do in my place?
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Me?
text: He flips the walkie-talkie, catches it.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: The bitch would be dead. Course I
dialog: ain't sayin' which bitch.
text: He flips the walkie-talkie. GENE lashes out, smacks the walkie-
text: talkie. It sails over the edge, falls and smashes onto the
text: sidewalk four stories below.
text: MR. SMITH goes ballistic.
text: GENE walks away from him - right up to OFFICER TRUST.
speaker_heading: GENE
text: There's a plot to kill the Governor.
dialog: If you don't believe me, check that
text: guy right there. He has a gun.
text: OFFICER TRUST looks at MR. SMITH and then at GENE.
speaker_heading: OFFICER TRUST
dialog: So do you, Mr. Watson.
text: And OFFICER TRUST reaches in his hip pocket for a spare Walkie-
text: Talkie that he tosses to MR. SMITH.
speaker_heading: OFFICER TRUST
dialog: You got this under control?
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: OFFICER TRUST
text: It doesn't look like it.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
text: It's under control.
speaker_heading: OFFICER TRUST
dialog: It better be.
text: OFFICER TRUST walks away.
text: MR. SMITH stares at a devastated GENE. He sticks the walkie-
text: talkie into his pocket, grabs GENE under the arm, drags him
text: to an isolated corner.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: I oughta throw you after that walkie-
dialog: talkie but I'm going to give you a
dialog: break because you're an amateur.
speaker_heading: WAITER M (O.S.)
dialog: Gentlemen...
text: The WAITER offers a tray of hors d'houvres.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Yeah, thanks. Have a cracker.
text: GENE shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Have a cracker, Mr. Watson.
text: GENE woodenly takes one. The WAITER moves on.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: There was this guy. Big guy. Irish-
text: Italian. Red-faced, black-haired,
dialog: jolly son-of-a-bitch.
text: We see them from a distance - just a couple guys chatting.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Nobody could make me laugh like him.
dialog: We closed more bars together than I
dialog: can count. He was my pal. I loved
dialog: that crazy mick, I'm not ashamed to
dialog: say it. But he was fuck-up. He had
dialog: this image of himself. Thought he
dialog: was con man. Always trying to shave
dialog: the edge. Nickel and dime. I'll always
dialog: miss him. Tell me why.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: What...?
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Tell me why I miss him.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: He's dead?
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: That's right. He's dead. Tell me
dialog: why.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: How should I...?
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Tell me why he's dead.
text: GENE stares at him for a beat.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: You killed him.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: That's right, I killed him. He fucked
dialog: up one too many times so I put a
dialog: bullet in his eye. Then I put two
dialog: more into him just to make sure. Now
dialog: that was somebody I loved.
text: He moves in on GENE, crowding him. He breathes hard, looks
text: like one insane piece of work.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: I loved that motherfucker but I got
dialog: the call and I put him down like a
dialog: sick animal. So if you've got any
dialog: doubts about what's going to happen
dialog: if you don't deliver let me tell you
dialog: something. I'd make gravy out of
dialog: your little girl just to season that
text: black Irish cocksucker's meat.
text: A wave of applause catches their attention.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON ELEANOR GRANT
text: She and her entourage enter the Pool Deck and walk toward
text: the platform. ELEANOR GRANT gladhands people on the way.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON MR. SMITH - 12:45PM
text: He turns' back to GENE.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Do what you're supposed to do. Do it
dialog: now.
text: He grabs GENE and gives him a push. There is a general
text: movement in the crowd toward the platform. GENE is buffeted
text: along. MR. SMITH follows him, keeping him in sight, but then
text: a PACK OF PHOTOGRAPHERS move in, start snapping, lifting
text: their cameras high to shoot over the crowd. MR. SMITH
text: instinctively turns away, hiding his face. He moves around
text: the PHOTOGS and finds himself separated from GENE by the
text: mob. He searches, trying to spot him.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Shit!
scene_heading: ANGLE ON GENE - 12:4 6PM
text: In the crowd, GENE is bumped this way and that. His face
text: displays an inner devastation. His eyes focus desperately on
dialog: something ahead:
text: It is the back of ELEANOR GRANT'S head. She is turning this
text: way and that, greeting supporters.
text: GENE's hand slides into his pocket, grips the gun. He is at
text: the end of his rope. He is going to do it.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON ROSTRUM
text: A local POLITICO mounts the platform, taps the microphone.
scene_heading: LOCAL POLITICO Can I have your attention Please! Please
dialog: welcome a man who was for 19 years the distinguished Mayor
dialog: of Los Angeles. The honorable Tom Bradley.
text: The CROWD reacts loudly, yells and whistles. GENE-pushes his
dialog: way forward.
speaker_heading: TOM BRADLEY
dialog: It is my extreme pleasure this
dialog: afternoon to introduce to you...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON GENE - 12:4 6PM
text: He is now a few yards from ELEANOR GRANT. He comes up against
text: the SECURITY MAN who gave him the once-over with the metal
text: detector. The man's eyes slide over him, then he looks away.
text: He nonchalantly steps aside, moves off through the CROWD.
speaker_heading: TOM BRADLEY
dialog: ...a woman who can only be
dialog: characterized as a one-of-a-kind.
text: GENE is close to ELEANOR GRANT. She is just a few bodies
text: away, visible between them. His hand moves in his pocket. He
text: swallows. The impulse sweeps over him and...
speaker_heading: KRISTA (O.S.)
dialog: Feeling better?
text: KRISTA BROOKS, the young woman from the elevator is next to
text: him, smiling. He looks at her in confusion.
speaker_heading: TOM BRADLEY
dialog: An iconoclast with class...
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: The elevator. You weren't feeling
dialog: well.
text: GENE looks at ELEANOR GRANT.
speaker_heading: TOM BRADLEY
dialog: A genuine lady who's not afraid to
dialog: get into the trenches...
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: Are you better now?
text: GENE turns, scans the crowd - no sign of MR. SMITH.
speaker_heading: TOM BRADLEY
dialog: ...and go to the mat with greedy
dialog: special interests...
text: GENE looks at KRISTA, studies her intensely. She's a bit
text: unnerved.
speaker_heading: TOM BRADLEY
dialog: The finest Governor our state has
dialog: ever had...
text: Again GENE looks at ELEANOR GRANT. She's turning around,
text: facing the crowd, facing him.
speaker_heading: TOM BRADLEY
dialog: My friend and yours, Governor Eleanor
dialog: Grant!
text: ELEANOR GRANT raises her arms. A perfect target. The CROWD
text: roars as GENE turns back to KRISTA. He leans into her, speaks.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: My wife always said I had a problem
dialog: trusting people.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara
dialog: Grant.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: You don't understand. I'm going to
dialog: trust you. And you have to trust me.
text: Krista looks at Gene.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Look...my daughter ... she's going
dialog: to die...unless you can help me.
text: Krista assesses Gene, his desperate tone of voice. Obviously
text: a nut case. A well-dressed nut case, but a nut case
text: nevertheless. Krista, nervous, looks around for help.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: Sure, sure, I'll help you. Let me
dialog: get Mr. White. I'm sure he can assist
dialog: you, he's our...
text: Gene pulls the gun, holding it in Krista's sight only,
text: unnoticed by anyone else.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: (sotto voce)
dialog: No! You have to listen to me.
text: Krista stares wide-eyed at the gun, at Gene.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: I'm listening, I'm listening.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE ROSTRUM
text: ELEANOR GRANT takes over the microphone from the beaming
scene_heading: LOCAL POLITICO.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: My friends, my good friends...
text: ANGLE ON THE CROWD
text: Gene and Krista are gone.
scene_heading: EXT. BEHIND THE PLATFORM - DAY - 12:47PM
text: Hidden by potted plants and campaign posters at the fringe
text: of the CROWD, GENE confronts KRISTA, covering her with the
text: pocketed gun. In the background, ELEANOR GRANT delivers a
text: ringing speech, accented with applause.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Please...please...you have to believe
dialog: me... They have my daughter. They
dialog: want me to kill Eleanor Grant  or
dialog: they'll kill my daughter.
text: KRISTA tries to edge away.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: All right, let's just...let's get
dialog: security in on this.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: No! You can't! They're in on it.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: I don't see how they could be in on
dialog: it. They're the best. They're hand-
dialog: picked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I don't know. One of them is following
dialog: me. If he knew what I'd just told
dialog: you they'd...
text: GENE pulls the gun from his pocket. She recoils, thinking
dialog: he's going to shoot her.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Look, how did I get in here with
dialog: this!?
text: KRISTA stares at the gun. She can't deny the fact.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: You've got to trust me. I'm putting
dialog: my daughter's life in your hands.
dialog: She's only six. She's just a little
dialog: girl. Please, please, trust me.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: It's a little hard to trust you under
dialog: the circumstances.
text: GENE looks at her intently.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: You're right, it is.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Here.
text: GENE offers KRISTA the gun. She is surprised, to say the
text: least. She takes it gingerly, with only the tips of her
dialog: fingers.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Will you trust me now?
text: She stares at the gun, at the strange man.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: I guess I'll have to. Come on, there's
dialog: one person we can go to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: The man following me has a walkie-
dialog: talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll
dialog: call his partner. I do anything out
dialog: of line and he'll send the word to
dialog: kill my daughter.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: He'll think you're in the crowd until
dialog: the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
text: She steps closer to the platform/ listens. ELEANOR GRANT'S
text: voice is heard.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT (O.S.)
dialog: ...I remember that horrible night as
dialog: if it were yesterday. A phone call
dialog: pulling me out of sleep, the terrible
dialog: news...
text: KRISTA checks her watch.
dialog: 12:48.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT (O.S.)
dialog: My husband and child senselessly
text: killed by a drunk driver.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: We've got about ten minutes.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: I've heard this speech a lot. Come
dialog: on. We'll take care of him. We will.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: Trust me. You asked me for help. Let
dialog: me help. Trust me.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Okay...
text: She starts to lead him away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Hey.
text: He stops her, points to the gun she still holds.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I think you better put that away.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: I think you're right.
text: She pulls out a handkerchief, covers the gun and tucks it
text: out of sight as she leads him behind the platform and away.
scene_heading: EXT. POOL DECK - DAY - 12:4 9PM
text: MR. SMITH still roams the crowd, looking for Gene.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: But tragedy, if it doesn't destroy
dialog: us, has a curious way of giving us
dialog: strength.
text: He sees OFFICER TRUST who gives him a questioning look. He
text: ignores it.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: I doubt if I would be before you
dialog: now, if I hadn't been put through
dialog: that crucible of loss.
text: MR SMITH notices the JAPANESE TOURIST COUPLE we met before.
text: The man has the video camera pointed at a sharp up angle.
text: MR. SMITH glances up toward what the man is shooting.
text: Consternation and anger fill his face.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON RED BONAVENTURE TOWER - 12:4 9PM
text: What he sees is one of the exterior elevators rising. KRISTA
text: stands at the glass looking down. Behind her, just glimpsed,

scene_heading: ANGLE ON MR. SMITH
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: And though I can never forget William
dialog: and Bill Junior or the love I felt
dialog: for them...

speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: I have found joy again in serving

dialog: Where are we going?
scene_heading: INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - SECURITY TABLE - DAY - 12:50PM
text: KRISTA leads GENE past the SECURITY GUARD stationed in the

speaker_heading: HALL GUARD
dialog: Ms. Brooks ...
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: Is he in?
speaker_heading: HALL GUARD
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
text: They walk past him. He's a bit curious about GENE, but shrugs
dialog: it off.
text: GENE and KRISTA reach a door and knock.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Who is this? Are you sure we can
dialog: trust him?
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her
dialog: Campaign Manager.
text: The door opens. BRENDAN GRANT is framed there.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: What is it? Is there a problem?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: We need to see you, Brendan.

speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone
text: is trying to kill Eleanor.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: What? What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: We need people we can "trust. We
dialog: only have a few moments...
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: This is...this is insane. How do you
dialog: know this?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I know it because I'm the one who's
dialog: supposed to kill her.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: You are!?
speaker_heading: (to KRISTA)
dialog: You brought this man here!? You
dialog: brought this man to my room!?
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: I had to. Her Security people may be
dialog: involved...
text: There is the sound of a toilet flushing in an adjacent
text: bathroom. The door opens and A MAN emerges drying his hands
text: on a hotel towel. He is late-middle-aged, white, mild-looking,
text: perhaps wearing glasses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: Is there a problem, Brendan?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: There certainly is. This man says
dialog: he's been hired to kill Eleanor.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Not hired. They're blackmailing me.
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: Who is this "they"?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I don't...I don't know. Please, Mr.
dialog: Grant! They have my daughter. I'm
dialog: not some lunatic. Your wife is in
text: trouble. Someone is trying to kill
dialog: her. Someone is trying to make me
dialog: kill her. Please, listen...
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: And on the strength of this story,
dialog: you bring this man to Brendan's suite?
dialog: Does that show good judgment, Ms.
dialog: Brooks? I'm just a friend of
dialog: Brendan's, but it seems to me...
speaker_heading: KRISTA
text: He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KRISTA
text: He got onto the pool deck with a
dialog: gun. How did he get past her Security
dialog: carrying a
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: I see. Where is this gun?
speaker_heading: KRISTA I
dialog: Have it.
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: Well, is it real? Do we know anything
dialog: about it?
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: It looks real. I don't know anything
dialog: about guns.
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: Could I see it?
text: KRISTA gets out the gun, wrapped in the handkerchief, hands
text: it to him. It lays in the palm of his hand. He unwraps it
text: awkwardly, examines it.
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: My goodness. It certainly looks real.
text: He looks beyond them, towards the entrance to the suite.
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: What's your opinion? You're the expert
dialog: in these matters, supposedly.
text: GENE turns, to see who he is talking to.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON DOORWAY - 12:.53PM
text: MR. SMITH stands by the open door. Before GENE can speak,
text: MR. SMITH moves. It is fluid and cohtroled and fast. He
text: marches across the room, detouring to grab a pillow from the
text: couch. He takes the gun, shoves" it- into the pillow and
text: goes face to face with KRISTA. She just has time to wonder
text: what is going on There is a double muffled gunshot. Shock
text: fills her eyes, she slides to the floor. GENE can only stand
text: there, unbelieving, freaked to the gills.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: Jesus Christ!
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
text: (calmly, staring at
speaker_heading: GENE)
dialog: Yeah, I'd say it's real.
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: Are you out of your fucking mind!?

speaker_heading: OFFICER TRUST
dialog: Somebody mind telling me...
dialog: (sees KRISTA's body))
dialog: What the hell happened!?
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Help me get her off the rug.
text: OFFICER TRUST checks the hall, shuts the door. They begin to
text: drag her body to the bathroom. The MYSTERY MAN watches.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: What have you done to me!? Christ
dialog: almighty!
text: GENE's eyes follow them. As if rousing from a sleep he comes
dialog: to life.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: No!
text: He tries to rush to the bathroom but MR. SMITH is right there,
text: gripping him. GENE struggles frantically, uselessly, watching
text: the bathroom door close. MR. SMITH is beyond anger. He grabs
text: GENE'S throat, muscles down. GENE grips the iron hand that's
text: cutting off his air.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: You fucked up.
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN (O.S.)
dialog: That's enough.
text: The MYSTERY MAN grabs MR. SMITH'S arm, tries to pry him loose.
text: MR. SMITH is beyond reason.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: You want me to kill your kid!? You
dialog: want me to kill you!?
text: GENE's eyes begin to roll back in his head. Everything begins
text: fading to black.
text: The blackness retreats in a rush and GENE finds himself
text: staring at the butt of MR. SMITH'S gun, visible under his
text: coat. He reaches for it, yanks it out, fires point-blank
dialog: into
dialog: 
text: MR. SMITH, again, again. MR. SMITH'S shocked face falls away.
text: GENE heads for the door.
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: Don't let him go!
text: OFFICER TRUST steps between GENE and the door. GENE shoots
text: him down and is out the door.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: GENE stumbles out in the hall, gun in hand. He hurries down
text: the hall, looking back to see the MYSTERY MAN and a wounded
text: OFFICER TRUST spill out of Room 2503. The HALL OFFICER pulls
dialog: his weapon MYSTERY MAN Get him!
text: GENE fires at the HALL OFFICER who goes down. GENE rushes
text: down the hall. One of the guest room door's opens and a MAN
text: staggers out. It is a bloody, wounded MR. SMITH! GENE stops
text: in shock.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I killed you.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: You fucked up.
text: And MR. SMITH grabs him by the collar and throws him over a
dialog: railing.
scene_heading: INT. THE LOBBY - MID-AIR - DAY
text: GENE is falling, falling. He passes the ascending elevator
text: and gets a glimpse of MS. JONES and LYNN, pressed against
text: the glass, her face a mask of terror. The floor rushes up to
dialog: meet GENE and...
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 2503 - DAY - 12:5 6PM
text: ...he hits the floor, thrown there by MR. SMITH. His escape
text: has been a dream. A wrist-watch fills the frame.
dialog: 12:56.
text: It is GENE's. We are seeing his P.O.V. He's laying on the
text: floor, his watch-hand in front of his face.
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN (O.S.)
dialog: You nearly killed him, too, you idiot!
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH (O.S.)
dialog: Nearly doesn't count.
dialog: Lose the P.O.V.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: I'm on record. I never wanted this.
dialog: I wanted simplicity; a telescopic
text: sight, a powerful rifle, but no.
dialog: What was good enough for Oswald wasn't
dialog: good enough for you two. You had to
dialog: get fancy. Drag some shmuck in off
text: the street, stick a gun in his hand.
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: It's academic now. She had to be
dialog: killed.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: What were you going to do, Brendan?
dialog: Lock her in a closet? You're in the
dialog: fucking kitchen now. Get used to the
dialog: heat. He's been seen all over the
text: hotel, looking like some Loony Tunes.
dialog: We even got him on video. It'll work.
dialog: Don't worry about it.
text: GENE stirs on the floor.
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: (about GENE) Is he awake?
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Yeah.
text: He yanks GENE to his feet.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: Oh Great. Why don't we just give him
dialog: our home phone numbers while we're
dialog: at it?
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
text: It doesn't matter what he hears.
text: He pulls GENE over to the bathroom door. Throws it open.
text: GENE reacts to what he sees within.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: That's what it looks like. She was
text: alive a minute ago. Now she's dead.
dialog: Because you wouldn't do what I told
dialog: you to do.
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: Get going. You've only got a few
dialog: minutes to pull it together.
text: MR. SMITH takes GENE out of the suite into the hall. The
text: door closes. Brendan, the Mystery Man and Officer Trust are
dialog: alone BRENDAN GRANT I don't know if we should go through
dialog: with this.
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: It's too late for that.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: There is a dead woman on my bathroom
dialog: floor!
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAM
dialog: What about it? She's Eleanor's
dialog: assistant and they will have been
text: shot with the same gun, by the same
text: lunatic. Some, anonymous loser who
text: went over the edge.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: (breathing easier)
dialog: Only thing better would be if he
dialog: were a postal worker.
speaker_heading: OFFICER TRUST
dialog: He won't be doing any work once I
dialog: get through with him.
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: And in a few months you're in the
dialog: Governor's mansion. The people'd
dialog: make you king of California if they
dialog: could.
dialog: 
text: BRENDAN GRANT laughs.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY - 12:57PM
text: OFFICER TRUST exits from the room and engages the HALL OFFICER
text: in conversation down the hall. GENE and MR. SMITH turns the

speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I'm not stupid.. I know how this is
dialog: supposed, to work.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Do you now, Mr. Watson?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I kill her - and you kill me.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Keep your voice down.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Even if you don't, Her Security men
dialog: will.
scene_heading: INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - ELEVATOR FOYER - DAY - 12:58PM
text: They reach the elevator. MR. SMITH punches the button. GENE
text: turns on him.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: How am I supposed to get away?
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
text: He gets out the walkie-talkie, keys it.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: (into the walkie-talkie)
dialog: Come back.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: How do I know you won't kill my
dialog: daughter once I'm gone?
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: (into the walkie-talkie)
dialog: Come Back....Fucking Radio.
text: MR. SMITH is getting nothing but static. He angrily keys
text: off, hisses at GENE:
speaker_heading: MR.SMITH
dialog: I told you she'd be alright, if you
dialog: do your job.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: And I'm supposed to trust you?
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: What choice do you have?
text: The elevator doors open. MR. SMITH gestures graciously.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: After you.
scene_heading: INT. "BLUE" ELEVATOR - DAY - 12:58PM
text: They step into the elevator. Stare at each other. The doors
text: close. MR. SMITH erupts. He grabs GENE slams him into the
text: outside window. GENE's face is smashed into the glass by MR.
text: SMITH'S shoulder. His body presses GENE against the glass
text: wall and he speaks, his mouth an inch from GENE's ear.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Look out there! You see the van?
text: The van can be seen below on Flower Street.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: You see it?!
text: WHAM! He slams GENE's head against the window. He lifts up
text: the walkie-talkie.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Come back.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES (V.O.)
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Do it!
text: He jabs the walkie-talkie next to GENE's ear.
speaker_heading: LYNN (V.O.)
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Daddy...?
text: And then a scream. The horrible sound of a little girl in
text: terrible pain. It cuts through GENE like a stab in the heart.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Lynn!
text: He struggles to turn around. MR. SMITH kidney punches him,
text: hard! GENE goes down on one knee.
text: The car stops. SOMEONE starts to board it, stops in surprise.
text: MR. SMITH sticks a badge in their face.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Security. Take the next car.
text: They back off. The doors close, the car continues its descent.
text: MR. SMITH lifts the walkie-talkie.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Again.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: (a gasp)
dialog: No, please...
text: Another bone-chilling scream from the walkie-talkie. GENE is
text: ripped to his soul. MR. SMITH hauls him to his feet, shoves
text: him against the glass.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: You got one last chance. Half an
dialog: hour and that kid is dead. I'll kill
dialog: her myself. I'll rip her fucking
dialog: head off right in front of you!
text: MR. SMITH releases GENE, who goes limp. The elevator doors
text: open onto the lobby.
text: MR. SMITH gets out, straightening his tie, wiping the sweat
text: from his face.
scene_heading: INT. THIRD FLOOR "GREEN" ELEVATOR LOBBY - DAY - 12:59PM
text: GENE gets out of the elevator, almost getting caught in the
text: closing doors. He can't even fight back at the doors. They
text: pound him a couple of times before he is able to step clear
text: of the elevator. GENE stifles a retch, hurries away.
text: MR. SMITH is standing there. Childish giggles erupt from the
text: walkie-talkie.
speaker_heading: LYNN (O.S.)
dialog: (filtered, giggling)
dialog: Daddy, did you hear me scream?
scene_heading: INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:00PM

speaker_heading: OMIT
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:01PM
text: GENE staggers over to the row of sinks. Leaning on one sink
text: with both hands, his body shudders violently. And he throws
dialog: up.
text: A man exits a toilet stall and walks toward the sinks. He
text: sees GENE retching, turns away in disgust, and leaves quickly.
text: GENE turns on the faucets.to wash the mess away.
text: He tries to clean up, but catches his reflection in the
text: mirror. He has trouble looking himself in the eye.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THIRD FLOOR LOBBY - DAY - 1:01PM
text: MR. SMITH is fuming. Into the walkie-talkie:
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: The next time I tell you to do
dialog: something, you goddamn well do it!
scene_heading: INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:01PM
text: MS. JONES tries to be private on the walkie-talkie.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
dialog: Hey, fuck you! You want to baby-sit
text: a screaming kid in traffic, come out
dialog: here and do it yourself. He got the

text: LYNN watches her, knowing something's not quite right.
scene_heading: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - EXT MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:02PM
text: GENE comes out of the Men's Room, stands there at a loss.
speaker_heading: HUEY (O.S.)
dialog: Having a rough day? Down at the heels
dialog: as they say? What you need is a shoe
dialog: shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today.
text: GENE looks around. HUEY has his nose in his magazine, calling
text: out his patter for whoever drifts by.
scene_heading: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 1:02PM
text: GENE walks over, climbs into a chair.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: (still not looking up)
dialog: Take ten, take a break, take a seat,
dialog: take a load off. Put the world in
dialog: perspective.
text: GENE has settled into the chair. HUEY tosses the magazine
text: aside, swings into action...
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: So, are you a visitor or are you
dialog: lucky enough to...
dialog: 
text: ...and freezes, staring at the familiar pair of shoes.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: (as he looks up)
dialog: You got a complaint?
text: GENE looks down at him.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: You remember me?
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: I remember. The big tipper.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Something is going to happen. When
dialog: it's over you'll know what I was
dialog: talking about.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Oh, man...
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Please. Something is going to
dialog: happen...
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: What? The end of the world? Man,
dialog: don't give me your mad rap. I'm not
dialog: a bartender. I don't want to hear
dialog: it. I raise a family doing this
dialog: bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your
text: crazy white ass out of my chair.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Please...
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the
dialog: right to crap in my ear. You want
dialog: change? You got it, brother. What
dialog: was that you gave me, a twenty?
text: HUEY kneels down, gets his cashbox, starts to open it up.
text: From behind him:
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Come on, let's get some privacy.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: He's deaf.
text: It spills out of GENE almost without volition. There's a
text: note of pleading hidden in it. GENE slowly points a thumb at
text: HUEY's "Disabled Veteran" sign.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: He can't hear a word we're saying.
text: MR. SMITH looks at the sign. HUEY stops what he's doing -
text: "What the fuck?" He almost says it aloud, then:
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: You wouldn't be kidding me now, would
dialog: you, Mr. Watson?
dialog: (to HUEY's back)
dialog: Hey, nigger! Is that right? You can't
dialog: hear me? Nigger?
text: HUEY's face settles into something cold. What's he going to
text: do? He stands, looks at GENE, who stares back at him, then
text: slowly turns around, looks at MR. SMITH - and breaks into a
text: jive-ass grin.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Why, looky-here. My customer-quotient
dialog: just got multiplied by two. What do
dialog: you think of that? You'll have to
dialog: forgive me, sir. Didn't hear your
dialog: approach. Fact of the matter is, I'm
dialog: deef as a post. Compliments of the
dialog: United States Army...
dialog: (does a snappy salute)
dialog: ...Artillery Corps. Can I give you a
dialog: shine, sir? You don't see your face,
dialog: you don't pay.
text: MR. SMITH is suspicious but he climbs into the second chair.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: Yeah, sure, give me a shine...
dialog: (looks at GENE)
dialog: ...shine.
text: HUEY goes to work on his shoes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: I'm putting your toy back in your
dialog: pocket, Mr. Watson.
text: Unseen by MR. SMITH, HUEY takes a peek and sees the gun being
text: transferred to GENE's pocket.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: It's all wound up. Now let's get out
dialog: your itinerary.
speaker_heading: GENE does.
dialog: "1:'30 - California Leads the Nation into the 21st Century -

dialog: 1:04.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: ...twenty-six minutes to get your
dialog: shit together.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Let me talk to her again.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I want'to talk to her.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Forget about it.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I talk to her or you can forget about
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Don't you threaten me.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: What are you going to do about it,
dialog: shoot me?
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: (glances again at HUEY) You know
dialog: what I'm gonna do.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: What? Walk out there and twist her
dialog: arm off?
text: MR. SMITH doesn't reply.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: It would be a lot less trouble just
dialog: to let me talk to her.
text: They stare at each other for a few beats. Then MR. SMITH
text: checks HUEY out and gets out the walkie-talkie.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: (into it)
dialog: Come Back.
speaker_heading: MS. JONES (O.S.)
dialog: (filtered)

dialog: something Daddy has to do.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: To be a hero?
scene_heading: INT. BONAVENTURE LOBBY - DAY - 1:05PM
text: MR. SMITH, GENE and HUEY in situ.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: No, honey, not to be a hero. But I
dialog: want you to remember something for

speaker_heading: LYNN (O.S.)
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: He's doing it for you. No matter
dialog: what anybody tells you, no matter
dialog: who they are, he's doing it for you,
dialog: because he loves you.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: That's enough.
text: He reaches for the walkie-talkie, but GENE stares him down.
text: Back to the walkie-talkie:
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Will you promise me that?
speaker_heading: LYNN (O.S.)

dialog: up.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: You done yet?
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Just about.
text: He gives the shoes a final wipe, stands away.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Two dollars, if it pleases you.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: It doesn't. I remember when it was a
dialog: fuckin' quarter.
text: He throws a couple dollars to HUEY. To GENE as he stalks
dialog: away:
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
text: Twenty-five minutes.
scene_heading: TO HIS BACK:
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Thanks for the tip.
text: HUEY turns back to GENE. They stare at each other.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Mister, what are you dragging me
dialog: into?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I'm not dragging you into anything.
dialog: I don't expect...
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Cover your mouth.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: This gorilla's watching you, is that
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Then don't let him be seeing you
dialog: talking to me. I don't want him
text: twisting my arm off.
text: GENE lowers his head, covers his mouth with a hand. HUEY
text: pretends to work on his shoes.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: That was your kid on the walkie-
dialog: talkie?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: My daughter. They have her in a van
dialog: across the street. They say they'll

speaker_heading: HUEY

speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Kill the Governor.
text: HUEY checks his perimeters, then:
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: I knew I should have packed up and
dialog: gone home as soon as I got that
dialog: twenty. What am I supposed to do
dialog: about this situation?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: One of them is in on it. He might
dialog: even be in charge. Her Security is
dialog: in on it. There's only one person I
dialog: know for sure isn't in on it.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: The Governor. If I could just talk
dialog: to her...
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Oh, Jesus ...
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: No way, there's nothing you can do
dialog: to help me.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Then why'd you drag me into it?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: (getting emotional)
dialog: It's my kid. I've got to...to
dialog: somehow...do right by my little girl.
text: He gets out her picture, stares at it.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: It's about time I did. I was one of
dialog: those guys, workaholics. I worked my
dialog: ass off for them - my wife, my
dialog: daughter. That's just what I thought
dialog: I was supposed to do.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Yeah, all right, listen...
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: (running on)
dialog: So when she wanted a divorce...I
dialog: was...I didn't know what I'd done
dialog: wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see
dialog: it....
text: HUEY takes his wooden brush and whacks GENE on the foot,
text: snapping him from his downward spiral.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Why don't you tell me about the early
dialog: years some other time?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I'm sorry. You understand I don't
dialog: mind dying if I could save my
dialog: daughter. I mean that.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Yeah, now listen. I can't mess with
dialog: these shoes any more or it's gonna
dialog: look funny. You go down get yourself
dialog: something to drink. Make sure Godzilla
dialog: there, follows you.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: I haven't the faintest idea. Go on
dialog: now. I'll get word to you.
text: GENE gets down.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: If nothing else, someone heard my

text: He gives HUEY a twenty.
speaker_heading: GENE

speaker_heading: HUEY

speaker_heading: BARTENDER

speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: It's on the Special Interest at the

scene_heading: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOP ARCADE - DAY - 1:13PM

dialog: clocks everywhere.
text: A. set of four clocks over the registration desk with the
dialog: time for Tokyo, Los Angeles, New York, and Paris.

text: over one number in a thunderous chorus.
scene_heading: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 1:16PM
text: He's near the Men's Room. HUEY's stand has a sign on the

scene_heading: INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:16PM
text: HUEY turns to see GENE and GUSTINO just looking at each other,
dialog: uncomfortable, to say the least.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: C'mon, ladies. No time to be shy.
text: GENE kicks off his shoes, shucks his pants. He trades his
text: pants and jacket with GUSTINO, who has done the same.
text: GUSTINO's pants are too big for GENE. His pants are too small
speaker_heading: for GUSTINO.
text: GUSTINO goes into a stall and closes the door.
text: HUEY comes back from the door.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Gustino! Drop 'em!
text: GUSTINO has taken a seat inside the stall, but with GENE's
text: pants still up. He drops them.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: And cover up them socks. Man, who
dialog: dresses you?
text: HUEY leads GENE to another door. "Service Personnel Only".
text: He taps on it. It is opened by a Latino JANITOR. HUEY and
text: GENE slip through the door, shut it. The JANITOR begins
text: mopping the floor as MR. SMITH comes in.
text: His eyes come to rest on the stall. All he sees are GENE's

text: MR. SMITH smirks and leaves.
text: The Janitor raps on GUSTINO's stall with the mop.
speaker_heading: JANITOR

scene_heading: INT. SERVICE HALL - DAY - 1:17PM

speaker_heading: GENE

scene_heading: INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - DAT - 1:17PM

speaker_heading: HUEY

speaker_heading: IRENE

speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: What am I supposed to say to her?
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: It'll come to you. See if you can

speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Irene...?
text: The service elevator stops. IRENE pushes her cart out into

scene_heading: INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - SECURITY TABLE - 1:17PM

scene_heading: INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY
text: GENE uses the key to let himself into
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 2510 - 1:18PM
text: Lit only by a bedside lamp. ELEANOR GRANT is laying on the
text: bed, dressed, towel across her eyes, bare feet elevated on a
text: pair of pillows. GENE edges over slowly to her. He stands
text: over her, not knowing how to begin.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Excuse me...
text: ELEANOR GRANT lifts a hand, moves the towel from her eyes.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: Who the hell are you?
text: She sits upright, reaches for the phone! GENE moves, putting
text: his hand on top of hers on top of the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: No, please.
text: They stare at each other for a beat.
text: She bolts for the door! Gene beats her to it! She backs up
text: to the bed.
dialog: Eleanor Grant is a strong, tough woman, but she's not
dialog: fearless.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: My security people are right next
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I appreciate that.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: One loud scream will bring them in
dialog: here instantly. You won't get very
dialog: far. Think it over.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: If I were here to hurt you I would
dialog: have done it already.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: That's...a comfort to hear.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I have a problem.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: Ah.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Only you can help me. I'm also sorry
dialog: to say, my problem is your problem,

text: She studies him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: I remember you...in the elevator.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: You were very nervous.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: It was because I had this...in my
dialog: pocket
text: He slowly pulls out the gun. She takes it in.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I need you to listen to me. Carefully.
dialog: Three lives depend on you listening
dialog: very carefully to what I have to
dialog: say.
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: (friendly as can be)
dialog: Of course. But suppose we set up an
dialog: appointment. I have an important
dialog: speech to deliver and you're cutting
dialog: into my nap time.
text: Very slowly, she moves to the table, lifts the phone ELEANOR
dialog: GRANT My assistant, Krista Brooks, takes care of
dialog: constituent...
speaker_heading: GENE
text: Krista Brooks is dead.
text: She freezes, slowly replaces the phone.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: How do you know that?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I saw her die. She was shot. With
dialog: this gun.
text: She turns to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: You shot her?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: Who did?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I don't know. The only thing I know
dialog: about him is that he works for your
dialog: husband.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: And your husband works for somebody
dialog: else.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: What the hell are you saying?
text: GENE glances at the bedside clock.
dialog: 1:19.
text: He looks back to the Governor.
scene_heading: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 1:19PM
text: An increasingly edgy MR. SMITH is looking at the Men's Room
text: door. He glances over to OFFICER TRUST who's keeping an eye
text: on him. He looks at his watch again, then gets up and heads
dialog: for the Men's Room.
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:19PM
text: MR. SMITH enters. HECTOR is at the urinal.
text: MR. SMITH checks out the feet under the stall. He has to
text: bend over to check properly. GENE''s shoes, GENE' s pants
dialog: legs.
text: HECTOR notices MR. SMITH'S actions.
text: MR. SMITH is aware that he's been noticed, but he is very
dialog: suspicious.
dialog: 
text: HECTOR flushes the urinal.
text: MR. SMITH stays by the stall. He is going to look over the
text: top of the stall. He rises on his tiptoes.
text: But HECTOR is staring at him like he's a pervert.
text: MR. SMITH is suddenly embarrassed. He backs away from the
dialog: stall.
text: HECTOR washes his hands, watching MR. SMITH in the mirror.
text: MR. SMITH leaves.
text: HECTOR dries his hands. He walks over to the stall and knocks
text: on the door.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
text: He's gone.
text: And GUSTINO tosses a Bellboy jacket over the top of the stall.
text: HECTOR puts it on.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Hey, Gustino, what takes you so long?
dialog: You need to eat more fiber.
speaker_heading: GUSTINO (O.S.)
dialog: You got anything to read?
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 2510 - DAY - 1:21PM
text: The clock on the nightstand.
dialog: 1:21.
text: ELEANOR GRANT sits against the headboard. GENE sits on the
text: edge of the bed, the gun all but forgotten, held loosely in
text: his hand.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I knew you wouldn't believe me.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: I said I'd listen to you, not
dialog: necessarily believe you. You're
dialog: telling me my people are in a plot
dialog: against me. You're telling me my
dialog: husband wants me killed. What do you
dialog: expect?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I don't blame you. I don't have any
dialog: proof. But nothing like this occurs
dialog: in a vacuum. You can't be totally
dialog: oblivious. You must suspect something.
dialog: You're doing things which are making
dialog: people angry. People who have been
dialog: in power a long time are losing their
dialog: jobs. You know them better than me.
dialog: How much does it mean to them? How
dialog: far would they go to hang onto it?
text: Her eyes go inward, reflecting a vague doubt. GENE sees it,
text: hurries to follow up on this possible chink in her armor.
text: Excited by it, he gets up, forgets to cover her so closely.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: There's only one way to find out for
dialog: sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: (smiling, covering
dialog: her inner thought)
dialog: I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as
dialog: my last speech.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: It's the last chance they have for
dialog: me to kill you. Try to get out of
dialog: it. They won't let you. They can't.
dialog: Try to change the schedule and you'll
dialog: know I'm right. What have you got to
dialog: lose? It comes down to who you trust,
dialog: them or me? Test them.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: I love it when pistolero's talk of
dialog: trust.
text: GENE, across the room looks at the gun in his hand. He takes
text: the plunge.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: This? I've never even fired one.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: Indeed.
text: ELEANOR GRANT'S hand sweeps the lamp off the table, plunging
text: the room into blackness.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: (in the blackness)
dialog: Franco! Franco.'
text: GENE slips out into the hall as the connecting room door
text: flies open. Light from the other room spills in. FRANCO rushes
text: in, pulling a gun.
scene_heading: INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - SECURITY TABLE - DAY - 1:22PM
text: The HALL OFFICER jumps from his chair and runs into the suite
scene_heading: INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY
text: GENE quickly moves to the Service Elevator and pushes the
dialog: button.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 2510 - DAY - 1:23PM
text: ELEANOR GRANT stares up at FRANCO, back-lit by the light
text: coming from the next room. It gleams off the gun he holds in
text: his hand. She stares from the gun up to his hulking frame.
speaker_heading: FRANCO
dialog: What is it, Governor!? What's wrong!?
text: She hesitates.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: I...I'm afraid I've had a bad dream,
dialog: Franco.
scene_heading: INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1:23PM
text: The service elevator opens and GENE rushes out. He hurries
text: down the dim service corridor. Suddenly an arm snakes out of
text: the blackness and grabs him! HUEY steps into the light.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: What are you going to do now?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I don't know. I have to get back.
text: GENE keeps moving fast. HUEY limps to keep up
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: What are you going to do!?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: This is about power and you haven't
dialog: got any. There's nothing more you
dialog: can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
text: HUEY watches him disappear.
scene_heading: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:23PM
text: MR. SMITH sees the T.V. TECHNICIAN and REPORTER leaving the

speaker_heading: OFFICER TRUST (O.S.)

text: MR. SMITH looks at the man who has appeared behind him.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH

dialog: 1:23.
speaker_heading: OFFICER TRUST
dialog: Get moving.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: You' oughta learn to relax. I told

speaker_heading: OFFICER TRUST
dialog: It's time. It's time now.

scene_heading: INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:24PM
text: A different watch. The minute hand moves to:
dialog: 1:24.
text: It is MS. JONES'. She is in the driver's seat. She looks
text: back at LYNN who is trying to amuse herself one way or
text: another. She checks her gun. She pulls out her walkie-talkie,
text: puts it on the seat beside her. She starts the car.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: MS. JONES
text: Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at
dialog: all.
text: She pulls the van out into traffic.
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:24PM
text: MR. SMITH bursts into the Men's Room. He goes to the stall
text: and lifts his fist to pound on the door.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Out of there, Mr. Watson! Your time's
dialog: up!
text: The stall door opens and GENE comes out, zipping up his pants.
text: He brushes right past MR. SMITH, heads for the door. MR.
text: SMITH reaches out, grabs him.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: You forgot to wash your hands.
text: He throws him against the sinks. GENE washes his hands. MR.
text: SMITH leans against the sink next to him In the mirror above
text: the sink, GENE sees the stall door swings open. GUSTINO Is
text: huddled in the corner, feet up on the toilet. MR. SMITH
text: doesn't notice.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: I've got faith in you, Mr. Watson. I
dialog: know you're not just a regular guy,
dialog: see, I know that. Even if you don't
dialog: know it yourself. Maybe that's why I
dialog: picked you.
dialog: 
text: GENE steps between MR. SMITH and the open stall door.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I know what I have to do. I'll do
dialog: it. Let's go.
text: And'they exit the Men's Room. GUSTINO slumps with relief.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 2510 - DAY - 1:25PM
text: Other lights have been turned on. ELEANOR GRANT is fixing
text: her hair in the mirror. FRANCO is cleaning up the broken

dialog: the background.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: Hey, El, how's the head?
text: She turns, locks eyes with the MYSTERY MAN.
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: Eleanor.
text: She nods, turns back to the mirror.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm
text: thinking of canceling the speech.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: It's an important speech.
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: I'd say critical, not that it's any
dialog: of my business.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: It's just another speech in a Tower
dialog: of Babel so high that Nimrod himself
dialog: would be put to shame. Cancel. Make
dialog: my apologies.
text: In the mirror she takes note of BRENDAN GRANT and the MYSTERY
text: MAN exchange a look.

speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: I'll trot along. Nice to see you,
dialog: Eleanor.
text: BRENDAN steps into the room, shuts the door.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: During a campaign every speech is
dialog: important. This is free media
dialog: exposure. Primetime news coverage
dialog: that we couldn't buy.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: What's he doing here?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: Who, him? Just visiting.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT T

speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: Don't remind me.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT

speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: Nothing. I broke a lamp.
text: Brendan steps behind Eleanor and puts his arms around her

speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: Eleanor, please. I'll put it this

dialog: rubber chicken-fund raisers. What do
dialog: you say?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: Truth is, besides the headache I've
dialog: come down with a little lower
dialog: intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll
dialog: get you some Pepto, you'll make one
dialog: of your patented tributes to the
dialog: common person, then back to
dialog: Sacramento. This is no time to lay
dialog: down on the job. I don't care what
dialog: the polls say, you can't afford to
dialog: relax. Look what happened to Bush.
dialog: Tell you what, if you want to blow
dialog: off the Sacramento speech, fine. But
dialog: do this one and we'll get out of the
dialog: smog.
text: ELEANOR GRANT looks at him, almost sadly. She steps toward
text: the dressing table to fix her hair
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: All right, I'll do it.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: That's my girl.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: But I want to make some changes. Get
dialog: Krista in here right away won't you?
text: BRENDAN looks at her for a beat, then snaps his fingers like
dialog: he just remembered something.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
dialog: Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR GRANT
dialog: You sent my assistant on an errand.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN GRANT
