text: This is the future. Video tape tells the truth.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I have a stable of actors and actresses.

dialog: and they know how to fuck well --
speaker_heading: FLOYD
dialog: That's right, Jack and by that

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You come in here, at my party, tell me about

dialog: under contract to me. Period.
speaker_heading: FLOYD
dialog: Wait a minute, Jack. I'm not a complicated man.
dialog: I like cinema. In particular, I like to
dialog: see fucking on film. I don't want to win
dialog: an Oscar and I don't want to re-invent the
dialog: wheel -- I enjoy simple pleasures like butter
text: in my ass and lollipops in my mouth.
dialog: That's me -- call me crazy, call me a pervert,
dialog: but this is something I enjoy. One other
dialog: small thing I want to do in this life is make
dialog: a dollar and a cent in this business -- I'm not
dialog: trying to hurt you. I'm trying to help you stay
dialog: one step ahead of the game --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We're repeating ourselves now, Floyd.
speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: Jack, I think this is about cost and future --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The future is as bright as we make it --

speaker_heading: COLONEL

dialog: gonna be able to walk into their local
dialog: supermarket and buy or rent a videocassette --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: True film fans won't watch that shit.

speaker_heading: COLONEL
