text: The rumble of a lonely FOGHORN. Low. Faint.
scene_heading: TITLE: THE LIGHTHOUSE
scene_heading: EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY
text: EXTREMELY WIDE SHOT: Fog. Nothing else in sight. Slowly, a
text: SMALL STEAM BOAT emerges: A LIGHTHOUSE TENDER. It chugs
text: along, a tiny blip in a vast ocean. Black smoke puffs from
text: its crooked chimney. Its old engine sputters softly.
dialog: Hold.
text: The FOGHORN again, louder now. Closer.
scene_heading: EXT. LIGHTHOUSE TENDER. PROW - LATER
text: CLOSE ON: The rotten, rusty prow carves through the waves.
text: The third-rate engine rumbles.
dialog: Hold.
scene_heading: EXT. LIGHTHOUSE TENDER. DECK - SUNSET
text: WIDE: SHADOWS stand on the bow of the boat (back to CAMERA).
dialog: They might be men, but they could just as easily be ghosts.
text: THE FOGHORN BLASTS. It’s close enough to feel.
text: A FLASH OF LIGHT breaks through the fog, revealing...
text: The silhouette of a bleak stone island, no bigger than an
text: acre: PILOT ROCK. A few ramshackle outbuildings cling to the
text: surface like barnacles. On the highest point of the island
text: stands a tall, crumbling LIGHTHOUSE TOWER. An ominous flock
text: of SEAGULLS screech and caw around it.
text: THE FOGHORN and LIGHT bellow and flash again.
text: THE ISLAND itself seems to draw the boat and the men closer.
scene_heading: EXT. PILOT ROCK. SHORE - SUNSET
text: It’s dark in the fog, even with the flashing light above.
text: A TRANSFER BOAT is beached on the shore. TWO RELIEF MATES
text: doll out provisions to TWO MEN in dark uniforms and caps. The
text: hand-over is challenging.
text: The TWO UNIFORMED MEN come in and out of view, carrying
dialog: supplies.
text: One lags behind, carrying the heavier load.
text: They walk past a small, dilapidated BOATHOUSE with no door. A
text: poorly mended DORY -- THE LIFE BOAT -- is tied up inside,
text: sitting on the twisted runners of the launch that stretch out
text: into the lapping waves.
scene_heading: EXT. PILOT ROCK. NEAR THE LIVING QUARTERS - SUNSET
text: TWO OTHER MEN (late 60s, same uniforms) exit the one-story
text: CLAPBOARD SHACK that adjoins THE LIGHTHOUSE by a remarkably
text: long breezeway. They are the departing LIGHTHOUSE KEEPERS --
text: “WICKIES,” as they refer to themselves. They lug gunny sacks
text: over their shoulders, and drag their rope-handled ditty boxes
text: by their sides, keeping their heads down. Their bearded faces
text: are craggy and leaden. They reek of tobacco, must, and salt.
text: They shuffle toward their relief: THE MEN FROM THE TENDER,
dialog: carrying their supplies.
text: The four almost exchange glances. But they don’t bother.
text: THE FOGHORN bellows.
scene_heading: EXT. PILOT ROCK. NEAR THE LIVING QUARTERS - LATER
text: The new wickies stand utterly still, next to each other,
text: their gazes fixed on the same distant spot.
text: One man is YOUNG (early 30s). Tall, athletic -- but starved.
text: His deep set eyes are haunted, and his left eye is healing
text: from a week-old shiner. His crooked expression is severe.
text: There’s an eerie disquiet about him. He’s like a dog that’s
text: been beaten and caged too many times. A small mustache shows
dialog: his vanity.
text: The other is OLD (Haggard 60? Spry 70?). He’s weathered,
text: feral bearded, and hunched, with hands like vises. His lack
text: of visible lips suggests some missing teeth. He tremors a
text: bit, but he’s lean and sturdy as a lead pipe. His high
text: cheekbones smile even when he grimaces. His wild eyes shine
text: like jewels. He’s an old Pan. A Satyr.
dialog: Both of them seem like the kind of man you might find
text: muttering to himself in the corner of an empty bar room with
text: a distant look in his eye.
text: They watch THE TENDER depart the island, ever-so-slowly
text: disappearing -- swallowed up again by the fog.
text: THE FOGHORN bellows louder than ever, penetrating deep
text: through the bodies of the two men. IT SHAKES THE YOUNG MAN -
text: shocks him - but not the OLD one. He’s used to it.
text: OLD puts the stump of an unlit clay PIPE in his mouth (upside
text: down). He lumbers out of frame, limping a bit, and happy to
dialog: finally be “home again.”
text: YOUNG stays standing, staring out. A bit of fear strikes him.
dialog: There’s no turning back now.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY - EVENING
text: YOUNG throws down his heavy supplies.
text: They thud against the warped, mildewed floorboards.
text: He walks through the kitchen and takes a look around...
text: It’s run-down and spare: A coal range, a farmhouse sink with
text: a water pump by the sole window, a small cupboard, a table
dialog: and two chairs.
text: The wind blows. It’s depressing.
text: He keeps walking.
text: He hears the sound of dribbling water (0.S.)...
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS. PARLOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Entering the parlor, he sees: A reed splint rocker with a
text: busted seat, a rattling potbelly stove, and a small, very
text: dusty, government issue book chest.
text: A CLOCK ticks monotonously.
text: Then, YOUNG spots a fine DESK with a ship in a bottle on top.
text: It’s rolled shut. He looks around, shifty eyed, to be sure no
text: one is watching him...
text: Instinctively, he passes his hand along the top of the desk
text: to the LOCK. He jiggles it. Locked. Damn.
text: Then, there is that persistent sound of dribbling water
dialog: (O.S.)...
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS. STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS
text: The sound grows louder as he climbs the narrow stairs, every
text: tread creaking along the way. The dribbling grows louder...
text: He enters the sleeping quarters...
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS. BUNKROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: THUD! YOUNG bumps his head on the low ceiling...
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Son-of-a--
text: He shakes it off...
text: The bunkroom is also dismal. Not much more than two sagging
dialog: cast-iron single beds.
text: OLD stands near his bed, PISSING INTO HIS CHAMBER POT.
text: Pause. YOUNG absorbs the scene.
text: YOUNG walks to the unoccupied bed and sits down. As soon as
text: he does, OLD FARTS about three feet away from YOUNG’S face. A
text: deliberate display of power.
dialog: 
dialog: Pause.
text: OLD finishes relieving himself. He shakes his member. He
text: buttons up, and kicks the pot under his bed. The piss nearly
text: sloshes out. Mercifully, it doesn’t.
text: OLD limps away whistling (the song “Tis Brasswork”).
text: He pauses briefly...
text: FARTS again.
text: He leaves frame, his UNEVEN GAIT disappearing: Walk-drag,
dialog: walk-drag, walk-drag...
text: YOUNG sits on his bed. Still. Simmering. He’s not pleased.
text: But he'll try to keep that to himself. He holds his head.
text: The CLOCK from downstairs ticks...
text: Just then, YOUNG feels something strange under him...
dialog: He feels around...
text: He discovers a hole in the mattress. Something is poking
dialog: out...
text: He digs his finger into the hole...
text: He removes some horsehair stuffing...
text: He pulls out a small trinket, about six inches long... It’s a
text: MERMAID carved from ivory, with scrimshawed scales on her
text: tail. A primitive but pretty effigy. Strange.
text: YOUNG looks at it with a hungry curiosity...
text: He rubs his thumb over her body... her breasts...
text: He feels a bit guilty and puts her in his pocket.
speaker_heading: HOLD.
scene_heading: INT. FOG SIGNAL HOUSE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON: The hulking steam-powered foghorn engine. A piston
text: pumps, gears grind, a huge flywheel spins and spins.
text: CAMERA BOOMS DOWN TO: THE MOUTH ON THE HUNGRY FURNACE GLOWING
speaker_heading: WITH FIRE.
text: A SHOVEL FULL OF COAL enters frame and feeds the flames.
text: Another shovel full.
dialog: And another.
text: THE FOG SIREN BLOWS EXCRUCIATINGLY LOUDLY.
text: CLOSE, REVERSE: YOUNG shovels coal into the furnace, dripping
text: with sweat, wincing from the intense heat.
text: He shovels again and again.
scene_heading: THE FOG SIREN BLOWS: LOUD. CLOSE. PAINFUL.
text: YOUNG BRACES HIMSELF, REELING FROM THE SOUND.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY/VESTIBULE - NIGHT
text: The contents of a kitchen cabinet are strewn about the floor.
text: OLD is inside the built-in cabinet up to his waist, butt out.
text: If he had a tail, it’d wag. He’s looking for something.
dialog: Something secret.
text: YOUNG watches from afar in the staircase. OLD crawls out
text: with a wooden crate. He grins with relief, pulling out a sea
text: glass LIQUOR BOTTLE. He tremors a bit, it’s been too long.
speaker_heading: OMITTED
speaker_heading: - LATER
text: It’s dark.
text: The two men sit in the cramped galley. A kerosene lamp
text: flickers on the table between them, it is bent to one side,
text: but still works fine. YOUNG looks at their meal, trying to
text: hide his contempt: Lukewarm scrod and potatoes wait on
text: battered mess plates. He rolls a cigarette on the table. His
text: coal-blackened hands stain the paper.
text: OLD sets down two cups. Tin. Chipped china.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Should pale death with treble dread
dialog: make the ocean caves our bed,
dialog: God who hear'st the surges roll,
dialog: deign to save the suppliant soul.
text: He pours a strange, thick liquid into the cups. Homemade
dialog: hooch?
text: He holds his up for a toast.
speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)
dialog: To four weeks.
text: YOUNG pauses. Damn, it looks good. He could use a drink. But
text: he hesitates as if he thinks he is being tested.
text: He decides to stay focused on the cigarette.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: No, sir. Thank you.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Bad luck to leave a toast
dialog: unfinished, lad.
text: YOUNG tucks his cigarette behind his ear.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Meanin’ no disrespect, sir.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: A man what don’t drink, best have
dialog: his reasons.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Ain't it--
dialog: 7.
text: YOUNG stops himself to rephrase, more respectfully. It’s not
text: easy for him to be well-mannered. He takes his time, so as
text: not to fumble with the multisyllabic words.
dialog: I'd -- I had understood it’s
dialog: ‘gainst regulations, sir.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Did you?
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Yessir.
text: OLD won’t budge. His cup is still raised.
speaker_heading: YOUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: From them’s manual.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Didn't picture you was a readin’
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Ain’t trying for trouble--
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Then y’do as I say. That’s in yer
dialog: book, too.
dialog: Long pause.
text: YOUNG smiles. His expression seems to say: “This old guy is a
dialog: piece of work.”
text: YOUNG takes his cup very deliberately.
text: He stands up.
dialog: Pause.
text: He walks to the farmhouse sink and pours out the booze.
text: He pumps some water into his cup.
text: He sits back down.
text: He holds up his cup to toast. He’s proud. He won.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: To four weeks.
text: OLD smiles -- a little too wide. They click cups.
dialog: They drink...
dialog: 8.
text: Just as soon as they do: YOUNG RETCHES! A terrible taste. He
text: spits-up into his cup. A bit on the floor.
text: OLD revels in the mishap.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Aye. The cistern needs a-lookin’
dialog: to. One of yer duties, lad. Or
dialog: didn’t y’read yerself about it?
dialog: Polishin’, swabbin’. Swabbin’ and
dialog: polishin’. You’ll clean the brass
dialog: and the clockwork, and you can tidy
dialog: the quarters after. There’s well-
text: more to be mended outside.
text: YOUNG nods yes, his dry heaving subsiding.
speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)
dialog: D’y’hear me, lad?
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Yessir--
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: (correcting him)
dialog: “Aye, sir!”
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Aye, sir.
text: OLD starts eating his supper. Happy. His habits are a bit
dialog: uncouth.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: When the fog clears, you'll work
dialog: through the dog watch--
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Doggin’ it? Was ‘spectin’ I'd git
text: up to the lantern.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: I tend the light.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: The rules is alternatin’ shifts--
text: OLD is startlingly stern. Unblinking. No tremors. A speck of
text: scrod hangs in his beard.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: It’s the mid watch that’s to dread,
dialog: lad: night to morning. My watch.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)
dialog: Some new junior man I’m fixed with--
dialog: Y’act like y’never been to sea
text: a’fore.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: I...
text: YOUNG hesitates, he hasn’t been at sea before -- clearly. But
dialog: not worth the trouble getting into it now.
speaker_heading: YOUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: Aye, sir.
text: OLD looks at him with disgust.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: That uni’form don’t fit ye.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Well, sir, it’s the one them
dialog: establishment fellers gave me--
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: I’m meanin’ y’ain’t fit fer the
dialog: wearin’ of it. See to yer duties.
text: The light’s mine.
speaker_heading: OMITTED
scene_heading: EXT. PILOT ROCK - NIGHT
text: EXTREME WIDE SHOT: THE LIGHTHOUSE flashes. THE FOGHORN
dialog: blasts.
scene_heading: INT. FOG SIGNAL HOUSE - NIGHT
text: YOUNG shovels more coal into the furnace. ANGRY!
text: He casts a mean glance to the BOOK that rests on a chair by
text: the hot, whirring machinery: “Instructions to Light-Keepers,
dialog: July, 1881.” He curses the manual:
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Son-of-a-bitch.
scene_heading: THE FOGHORN BLASTS.
speaker_heading: YOUNG (CONT'D)
scene_heading: SON-OF-A-BITCH!
dialog: 10.
text: THE FOGHORN BLASTS AGAIN! YOUNG KICKS THE CHAIR OVER... THE
text: MANUAL FALLS TO THE GROUND.
scene_heading: INT. LIGHTHOUSE. TOWER STAIRS - NIGHT
dialog: MUSIC CUE: Weird, haunting, ancient.
text: THE CAMERA BOOMS UP THROUGH: The clinking and clanking gears
text: of the light’s clockwork...
text: A heavy lead weight on a chain slowly rises up through the
text: center of the tower’s cast-iron spiral stairs...
text: Wondrous patterns of swirling light move through the
dialog: ironwork.
text: The patterns shift rhythmically -- hypnotically.
dialog: Otherworldly.
scene_heading: INT. LIGHTHOUSE. LANTERN ROOM - NIGHT
scene_heading: MUSIC CONTINUES.
text: OLD sits in a sweat, mesmerized by the LIGHT. The machinery
text: whirs and clicks. THE HEAT from the huge THIRD-ORDER FRESNEL
text: LENS is immense. He is haloed in his pipe smoke.
text: His jacket is off...
dialog: Not cool enough.
text: He opens his union suit...
speaker_heading: - LATER
text: Now he’s bare-chested. His alcoholic's gut protrudes from his
text: wiry frame. His strong, sinewy arms shine with sweat. There’s
text: a faded three-masted ship tattooed on his chest, and several
text: crooked stick-and-pokes elsewhere -- all glistening.
text: He pours grog into his tin cup. He toasts the light. Drinks.
text: His eyes are heavy.
text: He’s not drunk yet. But he wants to be.
text: He pours another drink.
text: Toasts.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: To ye, me beauty!
scene_heading: EXT. FOG SIGNAL HOUSE - NIGHT
scene_heading: MUSIC CONTINUES.
text: YOUNG is staring up at the magical light. Eight beams -- a
text: rotating starburst. Weird light patterns dance across the
text: rocks below. It truly is a wonder. He yearns for it. It’s
dialog: primal.
text: He’s outside the signal shed. It’s an odd looking building
text: with a huge protruding trumpet, held up by rickety struts.
text: YOUNG tries to light his cigarette. The wind and dampness of
text: the foggy air makes it impossible.
text: His match won’t light.
scene_heading: THE FOGHORN BLASTS.
text: YOUNG strikes the match again. The match is lit... the wind
dialog: blows it out. Damn!
text: He strikes the match again...
scene_heading: THE FOGHORN BLASTS.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. BOATHOUSE/SHORE - MOMENTS LATER
scene_heading: MUSIC CONTINUES.
text: YOUNG is finally smoking his cigarette. He slowly walks
dialog: toward the shore...
text: HE IS DRAWN TO THE LIGHT from the lighthouse reflecting on
dialog: the water.
text: He pauses, the waves lapping against the rocks.
text: He starts walking into the tide...
text: He walks further, he doesn't stop... HYPNOTIZED by the
dialog: water...
text: THE LIGHT...
text: IS THAT A BALL OF LIGHT OUT IN THE SEA...?
dialog: Further...
dialog: 12.
dialog: Further...
text: Seaweed, moss, and slime surround his knees.
dialog: Further...
text: Then, slowly, A HUGE LOG, forty feet long and still sheathed
text: in bark, floats toward him...
dialog: Another log...
dialog: Another!
text: He looks ahead and THE SEA IS FULL OF LOGS: A RIVER LOG
text: DRIVE. He wants to run, but he can’t... he keeps wading
text: deeper into the ocean of logs...
text: He is almost up to his neck in water... Suddenly, he sees:
text: THE BODY OF A MAN floating face down in the logs:
text: HE WEARS A WOOL MACKINAW COAT AND LEATHER CAULK BOOTS WITH
text: THICK HOBNAILED SOLES.
text: Nearby is some kind of tool floating: A WOODEN POLE WITH A
text: SINISTER IRON HOOK at the end of it (a peavey or “CANT HOOK”
dialog: for moving logs in a log drive).
text: THE LOGS BEGIN TO JAM...
text: THE BODY FLOATS TOWARD YOUNG!
text: YOUNG wants to scream. He is almost totally submerged now...
text: WATER RISES ABOVE HIS MOUTH, HIS SCREAMS TURN TO SALT WATER
speaker_heading: GURGLES!
speaker_heading: QUICK CUT TO:
text: IMAGE, WIDE: Underwater, A MERMAID swims gracefully --
text: MENACINGLY -- in the sea toward CAMERA.
speaker_heading: QUICK CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS. BUNKROOM - MORNING
text: Water drips on YOUNG'S FACE
dialog: Drip. Drip. Drip.
text: He opens his eyes, startled.
text: OLD is disrobing in the mirror, carefully -- he’s drunk.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Shingles.
dialog: 13.
text: YOUNG looks up. Water gets into his eye.
text: OLD waddles to his bed, his pants around his ankles.
speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)
dialog: Tend to ‘em after the cistern. And
dialog: the lamp, she needs oil.
text: He flops down on the sagging mattress. Asleep instantly.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Aye, sir.
scene_heading: EXT. PILOT ROCK. PATHWAY - DAY
text: YOUNG lugs a heavy BAG OF CHALK up the incline of the island.
dialog: It’s hard work.
text: The wind blows like hell.
scene_heading: EXT. PILOT ROCK. CISTERN - DAY
text: YOUNG, cigarette in his mouth, opens the hatch of a porridged
text: brick water tank: It lets out a putrid stench that knocks
text: YOUNG'S face back a few inches.
text: He tosses away the cigarette and covers his mouth and nose
text: with the handkerchief around his neck.
text: He looks inside: It’s full of mold and frothy sludge.
dialog: It’s what he’s been drinking.
text: He pours in the chalk. It slowly sinks.
text: YOUNG drops in the mixing stick and swirls the water around.
text: It looks sort of beautiful.
scene_heading: EXT. LIVING QUARTERS. ROOF - DAY
text: YOUNG scrapes at old cedar shakes.
text: Scrape. Scrape. Scrape.
text: He balances precariously on a rickety rung ladder. The wind
text: blows hard, nearly knocking him off. It’s monotonous work. He
text: takes it seriously, but with a chip on his shoulder.
text: He looks up to the lighthouse: Curtains drawn in the lamp
dialog: room.
dialog: 14.
text: He rips out several rotted shingles. The roof boards below
dialog: are ravaged with rot, too. Yep, here’s that leaky hole.
text: He leans in...
text: HE CAN SEE THROUGH A HOLE IN THE ROOF:
text: OLD is asleep. But he’s moving...
text: YOUNG leans in closer...
text: OLD is softly HUMPING his sweaty mattress, just gently
text: thrusting his hips. It’s subtle. A reflexive motion.
dialog: YOUNG watches.
dialog: Hold.
scene_heading: EXT. SUPPLY SHED - DAY
text: YOUNG opens a wooden door that almost falls off its hinges:
text: The shack is full. Barrels of dried fish, shelves of tools,
text: tapers, paper-wrapped parcels, wooden crates, casks, kegs,
dialog: rope...
scene_heading: EXT. COAL HOUSE - DAY
text: YOUNG opens the door: COAL. Heaps of it.
text: This door does fall off its hinges.
scene_heading: EXT. COAL HOUSE - LATER
text: He loads up a wheelbarrow overfull with coal.
scene_heading: EXT. PILOT ROCK. PATHWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: He pushes the wheelbarrow down the rock. (Needless to say,
text: the wheel squeaks.)
dialog: He keeps pushing. One wrong step could cause the whole pile
text: to tumble off of the wheelbarrow and down the island....
scene_heading: EXT. FOG SIGNAL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: He makes his way to the door with the wheelbarrow...
text: A SEAGULL stands in front of the old door, guarding it.
dialog: 15.
text: YOUNG flaps his hand, trying to scare it.
text: THE GULL SQUAWKS. It turns its head, revealing: A MISSING
text: EYE. The empty socket is gruesome and twisted. A war wound.
text: YOUNG is motionless, staring at the strange deformity...
text: SUDDENLY, THE GULL YEOWS, LUNGING at him, clicking its beak.
text: Instinctively, YOUNG HURLS a lump of coal at it...
dialog: He misses...
text: THE GULL mews this time, looks with its single eye, and flies
dialog: away.
text: YOUNG watches the bird’s path...
text: It flies past the lighthouse...
text: The OLD man is looking down at him from the TOWER CATWALK (an
text: exterior observation deck), puffing his pipe. Watching.
scene_heading: INT. LIGHTHOUSE. OIL ROOM - DAY
text: The double-doors of the breezeway open, revealing: Oil drums
text: at the bottom of the staircase. THE OIL ROOM. YOUNG looks
dialog: up...
text: That is one tall staircase.
text: The chains of the light’s clockwork weights look sinister as
text: they dangle down the center of the iron spiral steps and
text: their shadows creep across the stone wall. They clink and
text: clank, echoing ominously...
text: YOUNG looks at the OIL DRUMS hiding beneath the stairs. They
text: are much larger and more imposing than the heavy chalk bag.
scene_heading: INT. LIGHTHOUSE. TOWER STAIRS - DAY
text: Clunk. YOUNG lugs an immense OIL DRUM up the steps.
dialog: 16.
dialog: Clunk.
scene_heading: INT. LIGHTHOUSE. MACHINE ROOM - DAY
text: Finally, YOUNG reaches the top of the stairs. The oil drum
text: SLAMS down. His muscles tremor, sweat drips.
text: He looks at the hatch to the LANTERN ROOM above...
dialog: He is drawn to it... what’s in there?
text: Slowly, he reaches toward the handle...
dialog: He pushes...
text: It’s closed. Stuck. Locked?
speaker_heading: OLD (0.S.)
dialog: You don’t go in there!
dialog: OLD startles YOUNG. Where did he come from?
text: OLD emerges from the shadows: walk-drag, walk-drag, walk-
dialog: drag.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Oil, sir.
dialog: Says YOUNG, feeling somehow caught.
text: He steps away from the drum, showing it to the old man,
text: trying to hide an ounce of pride. He wipes the sweat from his
text: brow, panting.
text: OLD limps around him, smoking his pipe.
text: HE BLOWS SMOKE IN YOUNG’S FACE. YOUNG closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Tired?
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: No, sir.
text: Says YOUNG, still panting.
text: OLD throws a small, empty, THREE-GALLON BRASS OIL CANISTER at
dialog: him.
text: YOUNG CATCHES it awkwardly.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Use this next time. Save you a
dialog: helluva lotta trouble.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
text: OLD continues to taunt him.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Catch yer breath, lad.
dialog: Pause.
dialog: I said catch your breath, lad!
text: YOUNG grits his teeth.
speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)
dialog: Then bring that drum back down the
dialog: ladderwell where y’found it. ‘Less
dialog: yer fixin’ to burn the whole light
dialog: down.
dialog: 17.
text: OLD climbs the ladder to the LANTERN ROOM. YOUNG watches with
dialog: spite.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Aye, sir.
text: OLD pulls out a KEY RING attached to his watch chain. A half
text: dozen BRASS KEYS in varying sizes.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Then see to the rest of yer duties.
dialog: Yer behindhand already.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Aye, sir.
text: YOUNG watches him unlock the door with the largest
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Yer too slow. You a dullard?
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Fooled me.
text: OLD slams the door and locks it from the inside.
text: HOLD on YOUNG.
speaker_heading: KEY.
dialog: 18.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY - NIGHT
text: Scrod and potatoes again.
text: YOUNG has his water. OLD pours himself a dram.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Should pale death with treble dread
dialog: make the ocean caves our bed, God
dialog: who hear'st the surges roll, deign
dialog: to save the suppliant soul.
text: They drink. YOUNG winces a little. OLD is satisfied and
text: starts eating.
speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)
dialog: (between chewing)
dialog: Still tastes o’the head?
dialog: YOUNG won’t nod yes.
text: They eat in silence.
text: OLD looks up at YOUNG... YOUNG ignores him.
speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah, find some chirk in ye, lad. Now
dialog: is the time for gab and chatter.
dialog: Y’best be enjoying it. Come a
dialog: fortnight and the brace of us’‘1l be
dialog: wantin’ to be ever silent as the

speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Reckon yer the first?
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: No, sir. I don’t.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Y’ain’t. Y’ain’t. Aye, the
dialog: Chicopee, a fine-un, she were.
dialog: Clean-built and trig-lookin’! None
dialog: more fleet in ‘64 than she... We
dialog: were on the breaks -- a mutiny it
dialog: were. And why, ask ye? Why? What’s
dialog: the terrible part of the sailor's
dialog: life ask ye, lad? T’ain’t Cap’n,

speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Stupid.
text: Pause. The two men stare at each other for a moment.

text: YOUNG smiles in spite of himself, it’s hard not to.
text: OLD pours another and toasts.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Curse me if there ain’t an old

dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: YOUNG

speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Aye, went mad, he did. First a

dialog: fancies struck him. Ravin’ ‘bout
text: sirens, merfolk, bad omens and the
dialog: like. In the end, no more sense
text: left in him than a hen’s tooth. He
dialog: believed there were some
text: enchantment in the light.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: He notioned St. Elmo did cast his
dialog: very fire into it. Salvation, said
dialog: he.
text: YOUNG laughs.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Tall tales.

speaker_heading: OLD

speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)
dialog: Best y’leave ‘em be. Bad luck to

speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: More tall tales?
text: As YOUNG starts to put the cigarette to his lips... OLD GETS
text: UP AND SLAPS HIM HARD IN THE FACE, out of nowhere!
text: YOUNG stands in shock, knocking back his chair to the
text: floor... He looks at OLD, stunned... YOUNG raises his fist in
dialog: defense...
scene_heading: OLD IS ANGRY. DEAD SERIOUS.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Bad luck to kill a sea bird.
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 21.
text: OLD breathes. He calms down a bit. He realizes how strange
dialog: that was.
speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)
dialog: Pay me no mind, lad. None. Fix us
text: up some coffee. Long night ahead.
dialog: Drop o’coffee‘ll do us good.
text: OLD doesn’t need to say he’s drunk.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Aye, sir.
text: YOUNG looks again at OLD: He’s shaken. Terrified. A shell of
text: himself. More frightening than his outburst of anger was.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS. BUNKROOM - NIGHT
text: YOUNG lies in bed, smoking a cigarette. Reading the manual.
text: Can’t get comfortable. Restless. He holds the CARVED MERMAID
text: in his hand, rubbing it reflexively in all the wrong places.
text: The CLOCK ticks monotonously.
dialog: Hold.
text: OUT OF FOCUS IN THE BACK GROUND: A SEAGULL lands on the
dialog: window.
dialog: Pause.
text: THE GULL starts tapping on the window.
dialog: Tap. Tap.
dialog: YOUNG hears it.
dialog: Tap.
text: Just as he turns to face it... THE SEAGULL has flown away.
text: YOUNG feels uneasy. He sits up.
text: Back to his bed: the MERMAID CARVING is nestled in his
text: sheets. Waiting for him.
scene_heading: INT. SUPPLY SHED - NIGHT
text: YOUNG'S head moves up and down, shaking slightly. He is
text: hiding in the shadows of the shed. The sound of rustling
text: cloth and a clinking belt buckle are heard. CAMERA BOOMS
dialog: DOWN...
dialog: 22.
text: He’s masturbating.
text: CAMERA DOLLIES INTO: YOUNG’S head and into ...
speaker_heading: BLACK.
scene_heading: EXT. SUPPLY SHED - A BIT LATER THAT NIGHT
text: YOUNG emerges from the darkness of the shed, smoking. He
text: closes the door behind him and leans against it. He sighs.
dialog: Soothed. Calm.
text: The LIGHTHOUSE LIGHT illuminates YOUNG in waves of hot white
text: panels, otherwise, the soft glow of his cigarette indicates
text: his location in the dark.
text: Suddenly, he notices something odd, a DARK SPOT in the center
text: of the light. The panels of light streaking across him have a
text: MAN'S SILHOUETTE within them. YOUNG looks up to the tower:
dialog: YOUNG'S POV: Is that OLD... hugging the lens?
text: YOUNG is startled, confused. He looks again.
text: YOUNG'S POV: Somehow, OLD is now on the CATWALK. Surveying.
text: He pulls suspenders over his shoulders, as if getting dressed
text: after a night with a woman. A lantern in his other hand helps
dialog: him look below....
text: YOUNG skulks beneath the eaves of the roof, wary of the man
text: above. He puts out his glowing cigarette... Hiding.

speaker_heading: OLD

speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Sir?
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY - DAY
text: OLD stands in the galley, pointing at the floor in horror. It

speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: What d’y’call this?
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: I mopped and swept. Twice over,

speaker_heading: YOUNG

dialog: right! These lodgings is more
dialog: ramshackle than any shanty boy’s

speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: And I say y’did nothin’ o’the sort.

dialog: to pull up and apart every

text: Long, painful pause.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Aye, sir.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Now swab, dog. Swab!
text: YOUNG does as he’s told - he grabs the mop and pail, finally

text: OLD smiles.
speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)
dialog: Now that’s a good lad. That’s what
dialog: I like to see.
text: YOUNG starts to mop.
text: OLD sings mockingly:
speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Oh what be the bane of a

dialog: What cause him to worry, to

dialog: ‘Tis Brasswork.
scene_heading: INT. OIL ROOM - LATER

speaker_heading: OLD

dialog: And cause him despair and drives
dialog: him to sin.'
dialog: ‘Tis Brasswork.
dialog: YOUNG keeps polishing... harder... faster... harder...
scene_heading: EXT. PILOT ROCK - DAY
text: YOUNG pushes the wheelbarrow through the storm (now in the

speaker_heading: OLD (V.O.)
dialog: (singing)
dialog: The oil containers I polish until,
dialog: My poor back is broken, aching; and
dialog: still...
text: He’s struggling... The wheelbarrow falls...
text: Coal scatters all over the place. YOUNG stands still.

scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY - NIGHT

speaker_heading: BLACK.
scene_heading: EXT. LIGHTHOUSE TOWER - DAY
text: ANGLE ON: OLD is looking down from CATWALK of the tower, he
text: smokes his pipe. The sun shines behind him.
text: CAMERA BOOMS DOWN TO: YOUNG, sitting on a KITCHEN CHAIR held
text: up by ropes, attached to a jerky BLOCK AND TACKLE. One of the
text: wheels is coming off the pulley.
text: YOUNG is whitewashing the tower, some 50 feet above the
text: ground. A bucket of whitewash dangles on another rope.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Keep ‘em still, lad.
text: YOUNG can’t. As usual, the wind blows wildly.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Aye, sir.
text: His "paintbrush," a stick with a horsehair brush at the end,
text: shakes in his hands.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Whitewash must be even, lad.
dialog: Bright! Shinin’!
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)
text: Like a silver whorehouse token.
dialog: Give ‘em sailors a proper daymark.
text: OLD lets the rope slip a bit. It truly scares YOUNG.
text: Whitewash drips onto YOUNG’S face and clothes. He yells:
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: They're not going to see it ina
dialog: Goddamn storm!
text: OLD laughs.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: They will after! And'1ll be glad to
dialog: see it! Keep your temper now, lad.
dialog: ‘Tis fine work. Yer makin’ high
dialog: marks in me logbook. Them’s gospel!
text: “Logbook?” thinks YOUNG. He stares at Old... for too long.
speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll drop y’down a few feet.
text: OLD lowers him some more; YOUNG slips quickly. Suddenly...
text: The pulley whirls too fast... YOUNG and the moving block
text: shift quickly and SLAM to a halt.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Easy.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Never been in better hands.
text: Another shift: HARD.
text: Is OLD struggling? He anchors his good leg to the catwalk.
text: SHIFT! Further than the last one. THE WHITEWASH SPLASHES.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Easy!
text: YOUNG thrashes in the wind...
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Quit yer flailing, lad.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: I ain’t!
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Y'are!
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)
dialog: Keep still!
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: I am--
text: THE PULLEY’S BUSTED WHEEL FLIES OFF... the rope springs
dialog: backward...
text: YOUNG, the chair, and the block and tackle plunge to the
dialog: ground!
speaker_heading: BLACK.
scene_heading: EXT. FOOT OF THE LIGHT TOWER - LATER
dialog: YOUNG comes to...
text: He's covered in whitewash.
text: How long was he out? He looks around... THE KITCHEN CHAIR is
text: shattered -- no more than kindling... OLD is nowhere to be
dialog: seen...
text: But THE SEAGULL with the missing eye is perched on his leg.
text: It pecks him, scavenging the fresh meat.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Shoo.
text: It pecks again. TAP. TAP. TAP. On his leg. The GULL blurts
dialog: out a hostile kek
speaker_heading: YOUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: You! Git!
text: It persists, pecking with its sharp beak.
dialog: YOUNG is afraid of the bird. Afraid to harm it...
dialog: TAP. TAP. TAP. Damn! It hurts!
dialog: YOUNG KICKS IT HARD!
text: THE GULL flies away, mocking him with mews and yeows
dialog: 29.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS. PARLOR/VESTIBULE - EVENING
text: OLD peers through tiny, delicate spectacles worn at a cant.
text: The left temple tip is too high, and not looped round his
dialog: ear.
text: He is finishing writing an entry in his LOG BOOK. He writes
text: the “period” with gusto.
text: Pen down. Book closed. Glasses off.
text: He rolls his desk top shut with a slam, and locks it with the
text: littlest KEY on his key chain.
text: CAMERA pushes into the lock.
text: REVERSE: YOUNG IS HIDING IN THE SHADOWS of the vestibule...
text: WATCHING.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY - NIGHT
text: OLD sits on the same chair he’s been sitting in for the past
text: weeks. YOUNG sits on an upturned NAIL KEG.
text: YOUNG turns HARDTACK in his hand. He’s debating eating it. He
text: KNOCKS it against the table. The biscuit clangs like metal.
dialog: Nope.
text: YOUNG pours OLD a drink instead. Passes it to him.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Thankee, lad.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Winslow.
speaker_heading: OLD

speaker_heading: YOUNG

speaker_heading: YOUNG

speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Winslow -- What brings you to this

speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Timber.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Timber...
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Big timber. Up north. Canada ways.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Hudson Bay outfit?
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: The same.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: True what they say? “Forest far as
dialog: the eye can see.”
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Yessir. Spruce, tamarack... white
dialog: pine. “Bush,” them folk up there
dialog: call it.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Had enough of trees, that it, then?
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Yessir.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Can’t say I blame ye. I hearn tell

dialog: wantin’ fer me.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Miss it?
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Miss it? I ain’t never know’d
dialog: anything but it.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Sailing.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Ah... Aye. Aye.
text: OLD sees the sea life clearly in his eyes. The stories he
dialog: must have.
speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)
dialog: Ain’t nothing what can touch it.
text: He snaps himself out of it:
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)
dialog: But can’t be draggin’ me old stump
dialog: about...
dialog: (Referring to his limp)
dialog: Nay... not worth the trouble... now
dialog: I’m a wickie and a wickie I is. I’m
dialog: damn-well wedded to this here

speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Ever married?
speaker_heading: OLD

speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)
dialog: ‘Tis fer the better.
dialog: Pause.
dialog: It’s clear that OLD has regrets. But rather than dwell ona
text: painful past, he changes the subject.
speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)
dialog: Since we're getting too friendly,
dialog: Ephraim Winslow, tell me, what’s a
dialog: timber man want with being a
dialog: wickie? Not enough quiet for ye up
dialog: north? Sawdust itching yer nethers?
dialog: Foreman found ye too high-tempered
dialog: for carrying an axe?
text: That last comment rubs YOUNG the wrong way, but he tries not
dialog: to give in to the feeling.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Like you says, just had enough of
dialog: trees, I guess.
text: OLD looks him over suspiciously as he lights his pipe.
text: YOUNG focuses on his cigarette. Lights. Draws.
speaker_heading: YOUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: Since I left Dad, well... I done
dialog: every kind of work can pay a man.
dialog: Some I ain’t near proud of.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Drifter, eh?
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: No sir! Just can’t find a post I
dialog: can take a real shine to, so I keep
dialog: movin’ along. And I ain’t the kind
text: to look back at what’s behind him,
dialog: see.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: On the run?
dialog: YOUNG gets defensive. Did he say too much?
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: No sir -- now look here, now -- I
dialog: mean, nothin’ wrong with a man
dialog: startin’ fresh, startin’ new,
dialog: lookin’ to earn a living--
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: ...like any man, tryin’ to settle
text: down quiet-like with some
dialog: earnings...
dialog: I read a man could earn six hundred
dialog: and thirty -- I read one thousand
dialog: dollars a year if he’s willing to
dialog: tend a light far off shore... the
dialog: further away, the more he earns. I
dialog: read that, and hell, I says,
dialog: yessir. Work. Save my earnings.
dialog: Soon enough, I’1ll raise my own
text: roof, somewheres up country, with
dialog: no one to tell me “what for”...
dialog: That’s all.
text: YOUNG smiles. He thinks he is doing a pretty good job
text: covering up his fear that OLD may sense more than he lets on.
dialog: The cigarette helps.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Same ol’ borin’ story, eh?
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: You asked.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS. PARLOR - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: OLD sits in his rocker, knitting, smoking his pipe.

text: closes the door.
text: He takes a drag.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Say, why’s it bad luck to kill a
dialog: gull?
text: OLD puffs his pipe gravely.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: In ‘em’s the souls o’ sailors what

text: YOUNG tries not to scoff again. OLD senses it.

speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)
dialog: You a prayin’ man, Winslow?
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Not as often as I might. But I’m
dialog: God fearin’ -- if that’s what yer
dialog: askin’.
text: YOUNG tries to take another drag of his cigarette. He can't.
dialog: It’s gone out... but he just lit it...
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: Russian Tar once told me: yer

dialog: someone somewhere’s a-thinkin’ bad
dialog: thoughts of ye.
text: YOUNG looks at OLD. OLD stops rocking.
speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)
dialog: They be a-cursing yer name.
text: YOUNG re-lights the cigarette and takes a drag, not knowing
dialog: what to make of that.
speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)
dialog: A toast to Ephraim Winslow, the God
dialog: fearin’ man. Let ‘im settle down
dialog: with none to tell ‘em “what for,”

text: OLD toasts and drinks.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Amen.
text: YOUNG feels uneasy.
scene_heading: INT. LIGHT STATION. VARIOUS - A DAYS WORK
text: - YOUNG sweeps the galley.
text: - OLD ascends the tower stairs. He pauses, out of breath.
text: - YOUNG is inside the fog trumpet, cleaning it.
text: - OLD swiftly rolls his DESK closed and LOCKS IT.
dialog: 
text: - YOUNG winds the clockwork mechanism.
dialog: 35.
text: - YOUNG cleans the clockwork. Leaning in a strange position,
text: his TOBACCO POUCH falls to the ground.
text: - OLD goes into the LANTERN ROOM and LOCKS IT.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS. BUNKROOM - NIGHT
text: YOUNG is tossing and turning in bed. Restless. Hot. Sweaty.
text: The sound of the waves crashing on shore is relentless.
text: The CLOCK ticks monotonously.
text: He tries to find a cool spot on the bed.
text: He turns his pillow over... kicks off the linens like an
text: angry toddler...
text: He’s only in his underwear. The MERMAID carving is in bed by
dialog: his side.
text: (Pinned on the wall behind him are clippings of desired
text: objects from a Sears and Roebuck catalogue, a Tenderloin
text: music hall program, and a few pornographic playing cards.)
text: Kicking off the linens doesn’t help. He sits up. He puts his
text: hand behind his ear... no cigarette.
text: He goes to his shirt pocket hanging on the foot of the bed
dialog: rail...
text: The TOBACCO POUCH isn’t there.
speaker_heading: YOUNG
dialog: Shit.
scene_heading: INT. LIGHTHOUSE. MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT
text: MUSIC CUE: The eerie “light” music.
text: YOUNG sees the POUCH resting on top of the spinning
text: clockwork. He grabs it and quickly starts to head down
dialog: stairs, but...
text: Something stops him.
text: A feeling. A question.
text: The clockwork spins, the light hums on its brass track, the
text: sea and wind sing their lilting song.
dialog: 36.
text: He looks up at the LIGHT swirling magically, undulating
text: through the cast-iron lens deck. It is beautiful. Hypnotic.
text: THE LIGHT DRAWS HIM IN...
text: But there’s something else... another noise...
text: Whispering.
dialog: Above.
text: In the LANTERN ROOM.
text: YOUNG tries to look through the iron grates of the lens deck:
text: the bright LIGHT of the lamp makes it hard to see... he needs
dialog: to get closer...
text: He grabs a chair from the shadows and stands on it.
text: He listens.
text: The whispering is more audible, though hard to define. He
text: listens, trying to block out the white noise of the light:
text: It’s OLD all right, but YOUNG can only hear bits of whispers.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: The light... seed...
text: There’s another noise, now that his ear is more focused.
text: It's a sticky, sweaty, slapping of flesh. Constant...
dialog: It’s familiar...
text: He puts his face closer to the iron and through glimpses of
text: the light and shadow above, he sees:
text: PIECES OF OLD, IN AND OUT OF SHADOW. HIS SINEWY TORSO IS
scene_heading: VIBRATING. HIS RIGHT ARM IS MOVING. VIGOROUSLY. UP. DOWN. UP.
speaker_heading: DOWN.
dialog: Is he...?
text: JUST THEN, WHITE, VISCOUS FLUID DRIPS FROM THE GRATES...
text: YOUNG QUICKLY AVOIDS IT IN DISGUST.
text: HE LOOKS UP AGAIN...
text: A HUGE, SLIMY, TRANSLUCENT SQUID’'S TENTACLE SLITHERS ACROSS
text: THE IRONWORK...
text: ...IT DISAPPEARS INTO THE DARKNESS.

speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY - DAY
text: YOUNG pumps water into a cup in the sink.
text: He drinks. Pumps again. Drinks. Goes to pump again, but
text: something stops him..
text: At the bottom of the cup is a dark film.
text: He sweeps it up with a finger and looks: strange.
text: Then, TAP, TAP, TAP on the window. He doesn’t seem to hear it
text: YOUNG pumps the water once again... it makes a rusty gurgling
text: sound... the water is more and more tainted, almost black.
text: Just then, he hears THE PLAINTIVE CRY OF A GULL, outside.
scene_heading: EXT. PILOT ROCK. CISTERN - DAY
text: YOUNG exits the back door of the quarters. He looks out to
text: the cistern.
text: The CRY continues.
text: He walks slowly toward the cistern.
text: THE CISTERN'S HATCH IS OPEN.
text: The CRY gets louder as he approaches.
dialog: He looks in:
text: DEAD GULLS float in the bloody cistern. ONE SEAGULL is trying
text: to escape -- pathetically, desperately -- crying. Its wing is
dialog: broken.
text: JUST THEN, A LOUD FLUTTER OF WINGS IS HEARD ABOVE... and the
text: sound of a gull landing.
text: YOUNG LOOKS UP...
text: THE ONE-EYED GULL STANDS ON TOP OF THE CISTERN... HE RAISES
text: HIS WINGS AND STANDS STRAIGHT UP, STRUTTING AGGRESSIVELY...
text: HE STRETCHES HIS BEAK WIDER THAN EVER AND LETS OUT A LOUD
scene_heading: HORRIFYING LONG-CALL TOWARD YOUNG!
dialog: 38.
dialog: YOUNG is frozen.
text: Then, THE GULL swoops his beak into the cistern... he grabs
text: the gull in his beak, and begins to eat it.
text: YOUNG tries to intervene...
text: ONE-EYE ATTACKS YOUNG’S FACE!

text: He sits and breathes.
text: He tries again. He gets one off.
text: He tries the other... no use... He pulls harder, it comes
text: loose, but the force is so great, YOUNG hits his head on a
text: lamp, mounted on the wall...
text: He and the lamp crash to the floor. He passes out with his

scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS. BUNKROOM - MORNING
text: YOUNG wakes up.
text: He is so hung over. He wants to die.
dialog: He needs water...
text: The pitcher... the basin... both empty. He knocked them over

dialog: He goes to Old's: piss and shit.
scene_heading: EXT. PILOT ROCK - LATER THAT MORNING
text: YOUNG wears his oilskins, smokes a cigarette, and carries the

scene_heading: EXT. PILOT ROCK. CLIFFS - LATER
text: YOUNG stands over the cliffside.

scene_heading: EXT. PILOT ROCK - LATER THAT MORNING
text: YOUNG stumbles around the slippery rocks, pushing an empty
text: wheelbarrow. Rain pissing on him. The hangover beating down
text: upon his head.
text: THE FOGHORN blasts relentlessly.
dialog: 46.
text: As he rounds a corner, he sees something WHITE in the black
text: rocks of the shore... He walks a few more paces...
text: It is a BODY, lying still. Is it a dead sailor?
text: He gasps... He drops the wheelbarrow and runs toward it!
text: THE FOGHORN blasts.
text: As he gets closer, it appears to be a WOMAN... A NUDE WOMAN
text: washed up on the rocks. White legs and arms splayed out.
text: He calls for Old, but he can’t hear him.
text: He runs closer.
text: THE FOGHORN blasts again.
text: THE WOMAN appears to be DEAD, entangled in seaweed.
dialog: YOUNG has to save her if he can.
text: YOUNG goes to his knees...
text: Wipes seaweed away from her face...
text: SHE IS BEAUTIFUL. The most beautiful woman he has ever seen.
text: The blood rushes to his head. His heart throbs. He looks her
text: over. He wants to touch her. He hesitates... but he does.
text: He checks her pulse...
text: Puts his head to her chest: Dead.
text: Slowly, he touches her cheek, then her mouth...
text: He moves his hand down her body, in the horror and grief of
text: her death, but also fascinated by her beauty, her perfect
text: feminine shape... He makes his way past her breasts, to her
dialog: ribs...
text: Her ribs seem to have wounds -- deep slices. They aren’t
text: bloody. They look almost like... GILLS.
text: He moves his hand past her waist, toward her genitals, then
dialog: he sees:
text: SHE HAS A FISH’S TAIL! SHE IS A MERMAID!!
text: He is frozen in terror. Then he looks back at her face...
text: She opens her eyes and smiles at him.
dialog: 47.
text: She raises her arms, wanting his embrace...
text: YOUNG opens his mouth to scream in horror...
text: THE FOGHORN blasts!
text: YOUNG runs away, fast as he can, flailing, stumbling over
text: himself. He has almost no control over his body as he hurls
text: himself across the island, his screams drowned out by the
speaker_heading: FOGHORN.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS. PARLOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: YOUNG is out of breath from screaming. Wild eyed.

scene_heading: EXT. PILOT ROCK. NEAR THE SHORE - LATER

scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. PILOT ROCK. CLIFFS - NIGHT

dialog: other hand.
text: He counts the waves as they crash onto the shore.
speaker_heading: OLD
dialog: -..Four ...Five ...Six
dialog: The waves are growing higher!
speaker_heading: OLD (CONT'D)

dialog: 49,
text: THE WAVE FLOUNDERS AND DIES...
text: OLD smiles at himself. I’ve still got it, he thinks. He takes
text: a swig from his bottle...
dialog: Did he really make the wave descend? Or is it a coincidence?
text: Regardless, the wind comes back with a vengeance ...
text: Behind him, the DORY that’s tied up wracks in the wind,
text: beating against the sides of the boat house.
text: The foghorn calls. The light flashes.

scene_heading: INT. FOG SIGNAL HOUSE - NIGHT
text: ANGLE ON: THE BAROMETER. The needle is falling. It falls from

dialog: No.
text: He corks it.
text: He lights a cigarette instead.
dialog: YOUNG turns...
text: OLD is in the doorway soaking wet, and crazed.

scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS. BUNKROOM - DAY
