scene_heading: EXT. FARMLAND - DAWN
dialog: 
text: IN BLACK AND WHITE, A black 1930s Cadillac speeds down
text: the only visible road amidst endless plains of farmland.
text: The road curves sharply ahead - the car accelerates.
text: Ignoring the turn, the Caddy drives directly off the road
text: and through a massive field of emptiness.
dialog: 
text: The car abruptly stops in the middle of the vacant field.
text: GENERAL BRAT (58, a patch covers one of his eyes) and
text: AGENT BLACK SUIT (an agent in a black suit) step out of
dialog: the car.
dialog: 
text: Although there is clearly nothing in sight for miles, the
text: General scans his surroundings with concern.
dialog: 
text: TITLE CARD UP: THE PAST
dialog: 
text: Agent Black Suit crouches down and pulls open a METAL
text: HATCH in the ground. Both men walk down the hatch and
text: into the earth.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: They descend a metal staircase and walk with great
text: urgency down a narrow corridor. The hallway spills into a
text: hauntingly huge metal room with a lone SCIENTIST standing
text: in the middle. The Scientist immediately begins leading
text: them across the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GENERAL BRAT
dialog: When did it start?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
text: At 05:00. We're seven minutes in.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION LAB - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The three men enter a large room divided by a one-way
dialog: mirror.
dialog: 
text: On their side, numerous SCIENTISTS, utilizing several
text: archaic devices, are busy at work monitoring the subject
text: on the other side of the mirror.
dialog: 
text: The subject: PRIVATE MILLER (22, naive and dutiful) sits
text: at a small table with a microphone on it. Miller raises
text: his hand, REVEALING a smoldering JOINT.
dialog: 
dialog: 2
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He takes a long and awkward hit from the joint and bursts
text: into a coughing fit.
dialog: 
text: The scientists begin to scribble profusely as their
text: devices blink manically. General Brat and Agent Black
text: Suit exchange a concerned look. The General lights a
text: cigarette as the Scientist steps up to a small microphone
text: in the corner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: (into microphone)
dialog: Private Miller, we are now going to ask
dialog: you several questions. How do you feel?
dialog: 
text: His voice booms through large speakers on Miller's side
text: of the room. Miller leans towards the microphone.
dialog: 
scene_heading: PRIVATE MILLER
dialog: Uh, I feel a little queer sir. But...
dialog: It's good. Good queer.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Sir. Good queer, Sir.
dialog: 
text: The scientists scribble madly. One of them mumbles into
text: General Brat's ear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRIVATE MILLER (CONT'D)
dialog: But...uh...even though I feel queer, Sir,
dialog: I should mention that I'm also feeling
dialog: quite gay...so, a little queer, but
dialog: mostly gay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: Private Miller. When you think of your
dialog: superiors, what emotions do you feel?
dialog: 
scene_heading: PRIVATE MILLER
dialog: (holding out the joint)
dialog: This went out...Sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: We will send someone in. Now answer the
dialog: question.
dialog: 
text: A door opens beside Private Miller and an AGENT steps out
text: wearing an intricate uniform that resembles an old
text: fashioned diving suit, an air hose leading out the door
text: that he came from. He slowly walks toward the Private,
text: who looks at him in shock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST (CONT'D) (O.S)
dialog: (through speakers)
dialog: Private Miller? Answer the question.
dialog: 
dialog: 3
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: PRIVATE MILLER
dialog: Oh...um...what was the question again?
dialog: 
text: The Agent in the strange suit reaches the private and
text: holds a lighter up to the joint.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST (O.S.)
dialog: (through speakers)
dialog: What are your emotions towards your
dialog: superiors?
dialog: 
text: Miller pulls at the joint until it is lit again. The
text: Agent exits the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: PRIVATE MILLER
dialog: COUGH COUGH Fucking shit.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Well, now that I think of it, it's
dialog: strange that they are called my
dialog: `superiors'. Does that make me their
dialog: `inferior'? I mean, that's pretty fucked
dialog: up.
dialog: 
text: General Brat scowls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GENERAL BRAT
dialog: (curtly to the scientists)
dialog: I've seen enough. Shut it down. Bury the
text: hatch, sell the land, and dispose of him.
dialog: This never happened.
dialog: 
text: Instantly, the scientists start packing up their
text: equipment. Staring at Miller, General Brat grabs a RED
text: PHONE and dials. Two Agents in the scuba-like suits
text: emerge from behind Miller and start aggressively dragging
text: him away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: PRIVATE MILLER
dialog: (freaking out)
dialog: Hey! What the...what are you guys doing!
dialog: Let go of me!
text: (desperately looking at the
dialog: mirror)
dialog: Sir!!! Sir!!! Help me!!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GENERAL
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: This is General Brat. We've reached a
text: final conclusion on Item 9.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Illegal.

scene_heading: INT. DALE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: DALE DENTON (late 20s, out of shape, slightly unkempt)
text: looks out of place in his black suit as he drives he sits
text: in his cluttered and worn old lady car. He smokes a joint
text: while listening to talk radio.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TALK RADIO DJ
dialog: Well, let's look at the facts.
dialog: Financially, coins are better because
dialog: they're cheaper, and environmentally,
dialog: forget-about-it, coins win hands down.
dialog: For those just joining us, we're with
dialog: caller Dale Denton discussing if America
dialog: should lose the paper dollar bill.
dialog: 
text: We see that Dale has a wireless ear piece in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Of course not! Who wants a pocket full of
dialog: coins? Seriously. Weighs down your pants,
text: clangs around. With all this unnecessary
dialog: new security everywhere, we'll be setting
text: off alarms left and right!
dialog: 
scene_heading: TALK RADIO DJ
dialog: We certainly do, Mr. Denton. Crude, but
dialog: to the point. Next caller!
dialog: 
text: Dale puts away his phone and pulls up in front of a nice
dialog: house.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Dale, wearing a name tag that reads "Garth", holding a
text: clip board and wearing a greenpeace hat, knocks
text: repeatedly on the door. A woman cautiously answers the
dialog: door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Um, I didn't order a pizza.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Excuse me, miss? Are you Sandra Danby
dialog: 
dialog: 5
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Uh...yea-
dialog: 
text: Dale shoves an envelope into her hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Sorry, miss, but you've failed to show up
dialog: to your divorce proceedings 4 times under
dialog: court order. You've been served.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Oh great! Thanks a lot asshole! Real
dialog: clever! Go fuck yourself!
dialog: 
text: Dale dashes back to his car as the upset woman starts to
text: open the envelope.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DALE'S CAR - SOON AFTER
dialog: 
text: Dale is driving and smoking a joint. He looks at his
text: check list - it is a list of people he served that day.
text: He's only got a few left. He listens to a different talk
text: radio dj while playing music from a tiny iPod boom box
text: that sits in his passenger seat.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TALK RADIO DJ 2
dialog: ...forget about Area 51, Roswell
text: sightings, Atlantis and the Boogie Man,
dialog: let's talk about real threats, threats to
dialog: our home and security...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Fuckin' eh.
dialog: 
text: His iPod starts playing HOT STEPPA by INI KAMOZE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice! Hot Steppa!
dialog: 
text: Dale turns down the talk radio and puffs away at his
text: joint; he enthusiastically dances in his car while
text: singing along.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: (singing)
dialog: You think you know, chico/I know what Bo,
dialog: don't know/touch them up and go - uh oh!/

scene_heading: INT. OFFICE BUILDING - LATER
dialog: 
text: Dale, wearing a Zerox hat, walks into the building.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Can I help you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Just here to check out some units.
dialog: 
text: The secretary nods and goes back to her work. Dale
text: casually waltzes down the office halls looking at the
text: names on the doors. He glances down at his clipboard, it
dialog: read: Walter Tandum.
dialog: 
text: He finds the office and knocks on the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER (O.S.)
dialog: Come in.
dialog: 
text: Dale enters to see Walter, a 40 year old accountant,
text: seated at his desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh! Hey there. Are you here to fix the
dialog: fax machines?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Nope.
dialog: 
text: Dale drops a blue envelope on Walter's desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: You owe American Express $4068 dollars.
dialog: Sorry, but you've been served.
dialog: 
text: Dale turns and walks away. As he does, he notices a small
text: kitchen. He enters and is delighted at the array of
text: snacks and beverages. He helps himself.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DALE'S CAR - LATER
dialog: 
text: Dale is parked at a look-out enjoying the food, smoking
text: weed and has his ear piece in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RADIO DJ 3
dialog: What gives you the right to say that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Everything! They should be able to
dialog: collect garbage TWICE a week. Why not?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 7
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: As a tax payer, can't I say that? Come
dialog: get my garbage a bit more! Is that so f-
dialog: ing crazy? I'm not asking for free beer
dialog: Tuesday's or anything. And the whole city
dialog: would be more aesthetically pleasing and
dialog: smell better. And don't pretend you can't
dialog: smell it. Ever been to New York? Great
dialog: place, smells like piss, though.
text: (takes a hit and starts
dialog: coughing)
dialog: Twice a week, cough might fix that.
dialog: (starts coughing harder)
dialog: Hold on one sec.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL - LATER
dialog: 
text: Dale gets out of his car, followed by some plumes of
text: smoke, and goes to his trunk. He chuckles as he takes out
text: a lab coat and walks towards the hospital.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - SOON AFTER
dialog: 
text: Dale, looking very professional in his lab coat, rushes
dialog: to reception.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I need Dr. Terrence, immediately.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Of course. One moment.
dialog: 
text: The receptionist immediately picks up the phone.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: DR. TERRENCE runs towards reception, where Dale is still
dialog: waiting.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DR. TERRENCE
dialog: (to Dale)
dialog: Hi there, I don't think we've met, I'm-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Dr. Edgar Terrence. You're the guy who
dialog: repeatedly refused to take care of the
dialog: monkey tree that spills onto your
dialog: neighbors property. And now, because of
dialog: that, you've been served.
dialog: 
dialog: 8
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DALE'S CAR - LATER
dialog: 
text: Dale hits a pipe. It is clear he strongly disagrees with
text: what the DJ is saying.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TALK RADIO DJ
dialog: ...stay in your own country. Five simple
dialog: words. And stay the hell out of mine! I'm
dialog: not a racist, per se, but I'm not some
text: hippy tree humper.
dialog: 
text: We see his ear piece and hear that he is on hold.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Let me through, damnit.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL - VALET
dialog: 
text: Dale, wearing a chauffeur hat, stands by the main
text: entrance holding a sign that reads: JOSH CORBER. A man
text: walks out of the hotel and, seeing the sign, approaches
dialog: Dale.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBER
dialog: My name's Corber.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: You're Joshua Aaron Corber?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBER
dialog: (overjoyed)
dialog: Get out of town! Clarice did this, didn't
dialog: she? I was just telling her before I left
dialog: how I've never been in a limo. Can you
dialog: believe it? 35 and I've never been in a
dialog: limo. Man! It's not stretched, is it?
dialog: 
text: Dale hands him a BLUE ENVELOPE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Sorry, but you've been served.
dialog: 
text: Dale walks away. CORBER opens the envelope and reads it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBER
dialog: Ah fuck!
dialog: (reads more)
dialog: Fuck! You fucking asshole!!! FUCK!
dialog: 
dialog: 9
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Dale completely ignores Corber as he dumps the sign and
text: walks out of the airport. Then, a huge smile comes across
text: his face. He has noticed a nearby Burger King.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Hey! Nice. New chicken fries.
dialog: 
text: He happily walks toward the food.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT - DALE'S CAR - DAY
dialog: 
text: Dale sits in his car outside a high school. An array of
text: Burger King wrappers surrounds him as he rolls a joint
text: with the last of his weed on top of a Batman comic. He
text: lights the joint and turns on the radio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RADIO DJ
dialog: ...3:09 in the PM and we-
dialog: 
text: Dale turns off the radio, takes one last haul, and then
text: snubs out the joint. He then pulls out a small leather
text: kit and sifts through it's contents: handi-wipes, hand
text: sanitizer, a little vial of cologne, Visine, mouthwash
text: and breath mints.
dialog: 
text: Dale vigorously wipes his hands, face, and mouth with wet
text: naps and then starts futilely attempting to put visine in
text: his blazing red eyes. Frustrated, he squirts Visine all
text: over his finger tips and simply rubs them into his eyes.
text: He uses the mouthwash, chews up a mint, dabs on some
text: cologne, and then gets out of the car.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Dale walks towards the school.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: Dale!
dialog: 
text: Dale turns to see his attractive 19 year old girlfriend,
text: ANGIE ANDERSON, walking towards him with her group of
text: friends. She kisses him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mmm. Minty.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGIE'S MALE FRIEND
dialog: Yo Dale. `sup.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Hey Kyle.
dialog: (to Angie)
dialog: So, should we head back to my place and
dialog: finish up the trilogy? Matrix:
dialog: Revolution. Whose it gonna be, Angie? Man
dialog: or machine?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: Of course. But can we just head to my
dialog: locker first? I left some stuff by
dialog: mistake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL - SOON AFTER
dialog: 
text: Dale and Angie walk hand in hand towards the locker.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: So, are you going to come over for dinner
dialog: tomorrow, `cause my parents are beginning
dialog: to think I made you up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Well, yeah, I really want to meet them.
dialog: Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow...let me
dialog: think.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: You don't have to feel weird about it.
dialog: They know how old you are and they're
dialog: fine with it. They just want to meet you
dialog: and see that you're a cool guy and that
dialog: I'm not dating you just because you're
dialog: older.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Of course. I know that. It's
dialog: just...tomorrow's tight. I've got a whole
dialog: bunch of cases that I can finish
dialog: tomorrow. It's probably going to take me
text: into the night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: Fuck. Well, then you have to just come
dialog: over sometime this week or something,
dialog: okay? `Cause it's getting weird for them.
dialog: 
dialog: 11
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I will. I promise. I'm not trying to
dialog: avoid this, for real, I've just been
dialog: crazy busy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Hello? Can I help you?
dialog: 
text: Dale and Angie turn to see a TEACHER, a guy about the
dialog: same age as Dale.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Pardon?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: You can't just waltz in here and hit on
dialog: the students. Get out now before I-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: Mr. Edwards, he's my boyfriend.
dialog: 
text: Mr. Edwards looks at Dale, then shoots Angie a confused
dialog: look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. EDWARDS
dialog: This is your boyfriend? How old are you,
dialog: 30?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. EDWARDS
dialog: And you're dating an 18 year old?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: I'm 19. I moved here from Morocco.
dialog: 
text: Dale doesn't know what to make of Mr. Edwards comments
text: and looks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. EDWARDS
dialog: Alright, well this school is for students
dialog: and faculty only. Friends can't just stop
dialog: by.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Dude, you may be a teacher here, but
dialog: we're about the same age, so don't get
dialog: all high and mighty. It's not that weird.
dialog: Frankly, it's natural.
dialog: 
dialog: 12
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. EDWARDS
dialog: Well, in that case, get off school
dialog: property or I'm calling the Police
dialog: Liaison officer. Angie, no offense to
dialog: you, but if this guy's dating someone
dialog: your age, it's because nobody his age
dialog: will date him.
dialog: 
text: Then, four HANDSOME AND FIT STUDENTS walk by.
dialog: 
scene_heading: HANDSOME STUDENT
dialog: Hey Angie. You were hilarious in drama
dialog: today.
dialog:

speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I'll wait in the car.

scene_heading: INT. DALE'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: So, do you want to get some food?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: No...actually I can't. I have to go serve
dialog: a guy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: Now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Yeah. It sucks. I'm sorry. We can hang
dialog: out later though. You can come over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: We'll see if Neo is truly the one.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: They share a long kiss, and Angie gets out of the car.
text: Dale watches her walk away, then whips out his cell phone
text: and hits speed dial.

scene_heading: INT. SAUL'S APARTMENT - LATER
dialog: 
text: SAUL SILVER is constructing a CROSS-SHAPED JOINT (two

speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: (unpleasantly surprised)

speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Brass tacs. I've got this new bud.
text: Unfortunately, it's a few more bones, but

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Better than that Blue Oyster weed?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Dude. Seriously. It's like if that Blue
dialog: Oyster shit and the Afghan Kush I got had
text: a baby, and meanwhile, the craziest
dialog: Northern Lights and that red-ass Espresso
dialog: Snowflake had a baby, and then by some
dialog: miracle those babies met, and fucked -
dialog: then this would be the shit they'd birth.
dialog: 
text: Saul pulls out a big bag of weed. He places it on the

text: large bud.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Smell it.
dialog: 
text: Dale takes the weed and looks at it. It looks
text: spectacular. Bright red hairs and large crystals, huge
text: purple and blue leaves - just spectacular! Dale smells it
text: and is taken aback.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: What is this? It's spectacular.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: It's called Pineapple Express. My guy Red
dialog: told me it's when this Hawaiian flood
dialog: takes special dirt to the weed or some
dialog: shit. It's pretty scientific. And I'm the
dialog: only guy in the whole city who has it.
dialog: And, its only ten bones more for a
dialog: quarter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: So...can I get a quarter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: No doubt. Just let me grab my scale.
dialog: 
text: Saul walks into another room. Dale looks around
text: anxiously; he clearly wants to go.
dialog: 
dialog: 15
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A moment later, Saul comes back into the room and sits
text: down. Dale notices that he didn't bring anything back
text: from the other room. Saul notices Dale looking at him
dialog: strangely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: What's with the look? What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Where's the scale?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Oh shit! The scale. Be right back.
dialog: 
text: Saul hustles into the other room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: (from other room)
dialog: You know what's weird? How sometimes,
dialog: your brain just chooses to like, not keep
dialog: things in it, you know?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Fucking scale.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Shit. Where is it?
dialog: 
text: Dale checks his watch and then looks at the door;
text: suddenly, something catches his eye - it's the cross-
dialog: joint Saul was constructing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Holy shit! What the fuck is this thing?
dialog: 
text: Saul comes back in and puts a small electronic scale on
text: the coffee table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: (nonchalantly)
dialog: Ah, the cross-joint. You've never seen
dialog: one of these? Not surprising. They are,
text: like, the apex of the vortex of joint
dialog: engineering. NASA built the first one in
dialog: the eighties.
dialog: 
text: Saul chuckles at his joke as he places some weed on the
dialog: scale.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: You light all three ends at the same
dialog: time, then, you smoke it as it resonates
text: the main section, creating a "trifecta"
dialog: of smoking power. It's like, three times
text: as powerful as a normal joint.
dialog: 
text: Dale hands Saul some money and Saul gives him his weed.
text: Dale lingers for a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Well, be careful with that thing.
dialog: 
text: Dale gets up and heads to the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Dude...you wanna smoke this thing with
dialog: me?
dialog: 
text: Dale turns around. He clearly wants to smoke it, but he
text: tries to play it cool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't even light it on my own.
dialog: 
text: Dale sits back down on the couch, giddy as a schoolgirl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Wow. So like, uh...so like, so like what
dialog: do I do?
dialog: 
text: Saul gathers three lighters from the coffee table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Alright. Firstly you light these two
dialog: ends. Then I will light the tip, making
dialog: the trifecta complete. Are you ready?
dialog: 
text: Dale nods and they light the joint. Saul tokes hard;
text: plumes of smoke fill the air as he bursts into a COUGHING
speaker_heading: FIT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Holy...
dialog: 
text: Dale takes the joint and hits it, exploding into a
text: coughing fit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: It's...uh, it's good to cough. COUGH It
dialog: opens the COUGH capillaries...gets you
dialog: twenty-five percent higher.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 17
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: And that, combined with the pineapple
dialog: weed, and the cross-joint COUGH you're
dialog: a good thirty to forty times higher. I
dialog: don't know the exact math, but, pff,
dialog: you're pretty fucking gong-showed. You
dialog: know what I mean?
dialog: 
text: Saul takes a toke. Dale coughs HARDER and HARDER. He
text: seems like he might throw up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: It's crazy. The better the weed, the more
dialog: I wish I could think of how to explain
dialog: what's so good about it, but the...uh,
dialog: the better it is, the less shit I can
dialog: think of in total, you know?
dialog: 
text: Saul passes Dale the joint, obliviously dropping ash all
text: over his suit. Slightly agitated, Dale brushes it off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, so, like, you've been buying from
dialog: me for, like, a few months now and I
dialog: really gotta ask.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What's with the suit?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I'm a process server.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: No, process server.
dialog: 
text: Saul looks confused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm hired to give people papers they
dialog: don't want. It's pretty much the easiest
dialog: job on earth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Nice, man. Where'd you get that job?
dialog: 
text: Dale takes a big hit from the joint.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Well...uh, I got a totally useless degree
dialog: two years ago, then I did nothing for a
dialog: year, then my dad got so fed up he hooked
dialog: me up.
dialog: 
dialog: 18
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: They both revel in the thought.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: I got it pretty sweet, though. Today? I

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Hey man, did you get those new chicken
dialog: fries?
dialog: 
text: Dale passes the join to Saul.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Yeah man. I'd get on that shit. They're
dialog: fucking mind blowing. So, then I hot-
dialog: boxed my car and then...got some action
dialog: from my girlfriend.
dialog: 
text: Saul laughs at this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Does she smoke pot?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
text: A little. She's in high school.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: That's fuckin' sweet! Ilegal love! You're

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: No, no. She's 19.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: (dissappointed)
dialog: Oh. It's still cool I guess.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Yeah, it's awesome, although I think
text: she's getting old enough where she's
dialog: realizing I don't do much. And these high
dialog: school guys these days. They're all
text: roided out and going to Harvard. Even on
dialog: my best days, I look like a fat, dumb
text: piece of shit next to them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Whatever, man. It sounds like you got it
dialog: pretty good. I wish I had a job that

speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Dude...you've got, like, the actual

speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Hey! You're right, man. I never thought

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE

dialog: 
text: Dale passes Saul the joint.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: That's totally true. Except tomorrow.

speaker_heading: DALE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Yo, so, like, what have these people done

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Let's see...tonight I'm going after-
dialog: 
text: Dale pulls a blue envelope out of his pocket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ted Jones. He forgot to pay his-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Dude! My guy, Red, gets his weed from a
dialog: Ted Jones. He's, like, #1 supplier in
dialog: town. Maybe it's him!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I doubt that, man. There's probably a lot
dialog: of Ted Joneses's out there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Yeah, but not like this one, man! He's
dialog: what I want to be one day. He's like the
dialog: "Jesus of Weed". So...I guess he's like
dialog: Jah. Or Scarface.
dialog: 
dialog: 20
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Saul points to his Scarface poster. The joint ends. After
text: a few moments it seems as though their ability to have a
text: conversation burnt out with the joint. They sit in
text: awkward silence. Dale gets up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Well Saul, that was crazy. Thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: No worries dude, peace.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. DALE'S CAR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Dale cruises down side streets and locates Ted's house.
text: It is a large well-to-do home. Having difficulties, Dale
text: parks in between two cars across the street. He turns off
text: the engine and starts smoking a joint. SUDDENLY - FLASH!
text: Two head lights appear up the street. Holy shit! It's a
speaker_heading: COP CAR!
dialog: 
text: He sits still, holding the joint between his legs as the
text: cop car drives past and...parks a few cars down! The
text: FEMALE COP walks up the block - TOWARDS DALE'S CAR!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Oh shit on me.
dialog: 
text: Fortunately, the COP crosses the street and walks towards
text: Ted's house. Confused, Dale watches as she is let in.
text: Dale waits a moment and then re-lights the joint. He
text: tries to see into Ted's house as he takes a MASSIVE TOKE.
dialog: 
text: BANG! A SILENCE SHATTERING BLAST comes from Ted's house.
text: Dale holds the toke in and tries to keep quiet as he
text: focuses on the large front window. SUDDENLY, the drapes
text: are torn down by an ASIAN MAN as he falls forwards and
text: crashes through the front window!
dialog: 
text: Dale watches in horror as a LARGE GREY-HAIRED MAN and the
text: Female Cop step forward and shoot the Asian man! BLAM!
text: BLAM! Blood splatters!
dialog: 
text: Dale starts COUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY! He starts the car
text: and, in a panicked fit, tries to pull out. CRASH!!! He
text: smashes directly into the car in front of him! He flicks
text: the roach out onto the grass and slams the car in reverse
text: - CRUNCH!!! He backs into the car behind him! Still
text: hacking his lungs out, Dale drives away!
dialog: 
dialog: 21
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The Grey-Haired Man and the Female Cop sprint out of the
text: house in time to see Dale's distant tail lights vanish
text: into the darkness. Something catches the Grey-Haired
text: Man's eye - a trail of smoke rising from the grass. He
text: lowers his blood-stained hand and picks up...DALE'S
text: ROACH! He brings it to his nose and sniffs, then rips
text: open the paper and examines the weed closely.

speaker_heading: DALE

speaker_heading: SAUL

speaker_heading: DALE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Yeah. So, we're the only guys.

speaker_heading: DALE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL

speaker_heading: DALE

speaker_heading: SAUL

speaker_heading: DALE

speaker_heading: SAUL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: There's no way. He could only find out
dialog: from Red.

speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Who is this Red guy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Red's pretty much a middleman between Ted

dialog: five minutes of me meeting her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: But let's say someone calls asking who he

dialog: you, because...why wouldn't he?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL

dialog: 
dialog:

scene_heading: ANGLE ON: AN ASIAN ASSASSIN
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Ted stands over Dale, aims the gun to his head, and-
dialog: 
text: KA-BOOM!!! THE BRIEFCASE EXPLODES!!!. Flames sweep over

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The air thick with weed smoke, Dale slowly rises to his

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Sorry, Ted...

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Dale turns to see the exit blocked by a wall of fire. The
text: air is thick with smoke and he can barely breath. Dale
text: looks around desperately. He spots the FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
text: He looks at the flames. He takes a deep breath, picks up
text: the fire extinguisher, hurls it with all his might at the
text: fire, and then quickly whips out his gun and shoots at
dialog: it!
dialog: 
text: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! He hits the extinguisher and it
text: explodes, blasting out the fire in the hallway towards

scene_heading: INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Holy fuck! Holy fuck! Aaaahhhh!!!

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Saul!
dialog: 
text: He grabs one of the unconscious Saul's feet and starts to
text: drag him out of the barn. Just a they exit, the barn
text: COLLAPSES in on itself, crumbling into a massive heap of
text: burning wood. Dale pulls Saul onto the grass. Saul starts
dialog: coughing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Saul! Cough Cough You're okay!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I have absolutely no idea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: They were fighting Asian dudes, man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Asian dudes? So, okay...maybe this is
dialog: revenge for that Asian dude I saw Ted
dialog: kill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: So we're, like, in a drug war. That's
dialog: cool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE

speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Hell no! I was scott-free. But how the

dialog: you came to save me? Fuck that.
dialog: 
text: They take a few deep breathes and each cough a bunch.
text: Suddenly, they see something moving in the rubble. RED
text: emerges, lightly crisped with his clothes on fire. He
text: roles around in the dirt trying to put himself out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Motherfuckers. Motherfuckers. Light me on
dialog: fire? Kill my Fiesta? Fuckers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: What should we do now? Can we go home?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE

speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Tell her you cut off your ear for her,
dialog: like that crazy artist.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But, seriously dude, your joking right?
dialog: She'll never take you back, ever. Just
dialog: grow up and date a woman your own age.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Do you think we should have looked for
dialog: the ear? They probably could've re-
dialog: attached it, eh? I mean, this ear thing
dialog: kind of fucking sucks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Oh my god, they blew your ear off, man!
dialog: Fuck that's gross. Can you dudes switch
dialog: sides? I don't want to look at it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Don't worry, man. Look at Evander
dialog: Holyfield, he looks totally normal. And
dialog: plus, I saw this thing on the Discovery
dialog: Channel, they can actually grow ears,
dialog: like, in a petri dish, or even on the
dialog: side of a mouse. And you only need half
dialog: of one. It'll be a fuckin' cinch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I just realized I've 100% lost my job by
dialog: now. I haven't called in for days.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Who fuckin' cares? I thought you wanted
dialog: to be a talk radio dude anyways? And,
dialog: like, I never said anything, but you do
dialog: have the voice. Like, when I didn't know
dialog: what you did, I kind of thought you might
dialog: have been doing cartoon voices, you know,
dialog: like that Shrek shit, and that's why you
text: wore a suit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: You do have a good talk radio voice. I

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: What? Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: You're that dude whose always calling

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Saul, what're you going to do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
text: Work at a bong shop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: I'm still selling weed. Fuck you guys.
dialog: 
text: They walk together in silence, delighted at their new
text: prospects. After a brief moment, Saul suddenly seems
text: afraid. He starts nervously looking back towards the
dialog: barn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Do you hear something?
dialog: 
text: Dale motions at his wounded ear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
text: All I hear is ringing.

dialog: them all?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: What the fuck are you guys talkin' about?
dialog: I don't hear shit.
dialog: 
text: Dale starts getting nervous, but tries to hide it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Well...the barn did collapse in a ball of
dialog: fire, and we probably each inhaled about
dialog: ten pounds of weed smoke, so...it's just,
dialog: you know-
dialog: 
text: Dale suddenly looks over his shoulder, but sees nothing.
dialog: 
dialog: 114
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: ...a little paranoia.

speaker_heading: DALE

speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Fuck this noise!

dialog: darkness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I'm following him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Wait! Me too!
dialog: 
text: With the barn's flaming remains the only light in sight,
