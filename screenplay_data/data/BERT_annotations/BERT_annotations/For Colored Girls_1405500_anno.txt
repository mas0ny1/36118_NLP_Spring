text: center is housed in a state funded facility with several
text: other volunteer operations. Juanita’s free clinic and
dialog: Yasmine’s Rhythms, a dance studio, are two of them. We
text: enter the dance studio where Yasmine is dancing alone. We
text: see soft shots of her hands and feet dancing about the
text: room. The fabric from her yellow leotard move gracefully
text: in the wind as she dances to the sound of a solo piano.
text: The slow speed of the film catches her face in the light
