speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: TIGHT CLOSE - JOE THERRIAN - MORNING
text: He's in his mid-thirties, his face relaxed in sleep,
text: childlike. Nestled soundly a tangle in the arms of his wife.
text: THE CAMERA STAYS CLOSE. SLIGHTLY BLURRED, SOFT, SLOWLY
speaker_heading: SWINGS ROUND
scene_heading: TIGHT CLOSE - SALLY THERRIAN
text: She's in her mid-thirties, with large deep eyes. She watches
text: her husband unguarded in sleep. Her pretty face, alert,
text: she's barely breathing. Traces the just visible lines around
text: his eyes, and mouth. Brushes fingertips against his
text: eyelashes.
scene_heading: TIGHT CLOSE - SALLY'S HAND PULLS THE BEDROOM SHADE.
text: It retracts with a loud WHACK, sun, sky, trees.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (O.S.)
dialog: And breath...and chataronga...
scene_heading: EXT. POOL AREA - DAY
text: We're in the middle of a yoga lesson. Joe and Sally stand on
text: their mats. Steven, their instructor, wanders around the
text: couple issuing soft-spoken instructions.
text: A large room with hard wood floors, dominated by a huge
text: fireplace. The dining room on one side, living room on the
text: other. Floor to ceiling windows overlook the back porch
text: garden pool... The house is classic Neutra. All GLASS and
scene_heading: SMOOTH LINES.
text: The calm is broken by the telephone. Joe and Sally ignore it
text: until the answering machine picks up. They break their yoga
text: poses and listen.
text: The CAMERA hovers over the answering machine.
speaker_heading: LUCY (O.S.)
dialog: (over answering machine; sweet,
dialog: British, slightly desperate)
dialog: Joe, it's Lucy. Remember me? It's the
dialog: black sheep here. Bah...not funny.
dialog: Haven't heard from you, need you, call
dialog: me. Love you madly. Hi, Sally. Joe,
dialog: I'd love to talk to you before I go...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Go where?
speaker_heading: LUCY (O.S.)
dialog: (over answering machine)
dialog: It's a damn nuisance you aren't here, big
dialog: brother. Sorry I drone on. I miss you.
dialog: I lo--
text: The machine cuts her off.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: Joe and Sally have resumed their positions. This wasn't the
dialog: call they were waiting for.
speaker_heading: WIDE SHOT
text: AMERICA, forty-one, and ROSA, fifty, struggle up the steps of
text: the back porch carrying grocery bags and packages, come
text: through the sliding glass door...
text: THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM
text: Through the dining room and into the kitchen, watches the two
text: unpack groceries, flowers, etc., and start to dress the
text: dining room table. They speak quietly to each other in
dialog: Spanish.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: America, could you just...
text: America closes the sliding doors between the kitchen and the
text: dining room, giving the couple their privacy.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: (calls out)
dialog: Thank you, America!
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Okay, let's just take a deep breath, let
dialog: your ribs expand and relax. And reach up
text: and into downward dog.
text: Otis, the Bisenji/Sheperd mix, sleeping on his leopard
text: pillow, stirs, stretches and groans.
speaker_heading: JOE AND SALLY
dialog: Good boy, Otis.
text: The phone RINGS again.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: (over answering machine)
dialog: Hello, I have Dr. Harmon calling for
dialog: Sally Therrian.
text: Sally jumps out of the down dog position and runs to the
dialog: phone, all angles.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Hello, hi, hi...and? Thank God.
text: Sally stands with the phone to her ear, her back to Joe.
scene_heading: EXT. POOL AREA - CONTINUOUS
text: Joe watches her from his position, not concentrating on the
text: teacher waiting a sign. Sally returns to the lesson. They
text: do their handstands against the wall, on either side of the
text: front door.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: No luck.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh, well, we'll just have to try again.
dialog: Sound like a plan?
text: Sally nods, she and Joe, at Steven's instructions, come out
text: of their handstands and lie on the floor in a stretched
dialog: relax, facing one another.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Happy anniversary, baby.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Happy anniversary.
text: They smile.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: And change sides...
text: America slides open the dining room doors. The dining table
text: is covered with bundles of freshly cut flowers. Rosa is
text: singing in Spanish.
speaker_heading: AMERICA
dialog: (with the authority of long
dialog: years of service)
dialog: Mr. Joe, we have to have the house. If
dialog: you please now...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It's yours.
text: The CAMERA glances off photos of the couple: portraits and
text: candids, their wedding day, with friends, on vacation,
text: tumbling on the lawn, and the like.
text: Some framed and hung, some taped to the fridge or simply
text: leaning on a shelf. It's clear that at least a handful are
text: by the same photographer, black and whites, grainy and
dialog: beautiful.
text: There are lots of photos of Joe and his sister Lucy,
text: documenting their relationship from childhood. There's an
text: ANNIE LEIBOWITZ photo-shoot of Sally carelessly displayed
dialog: somewhere.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - LATER
text: Joe stands behind Sally in front of the full length mirror,
text: his arms around her, stroking her belly.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I love you. Most beautiful woman in the
dialog: world.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Hardly...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Accept a compliment.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I think you're the most beautiful woman
dialog: in the world.
text: They move toward the bed.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What did you get me?
speaker_heading: SALLY
text: In the morning, after everyone's gone and
dialog: there's just us.
text: She pushes him on the bed.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Kiss my eyes.
dialog: She does.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: My wrists.
dialog: He does.
speaker_heading: JOE
text: Kiss the back of my knees.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Through the sweats or not?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Not.
text: She pulls down his sweats. She kisses the back of his knees.
text: He turns, stares up at her.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did
dialog: you?
text: Sally shakes her head.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: No. Did you?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: No. I missed that.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I missed all of you. We're okay, aren't
dialog: we?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: We're great.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I mean, you're really back.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: For good.
text: They begin to make love...the phone RINGS.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't get it.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Well, it might be Clair. They're
dialog: threatening not to come...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: They can't find a sitter...
dialog: (into the receiver)
dialog: Hello? Excuse me? Yes, uh, hold on.
dialog: (she looks at Joe)
text: Just a moment.
dialog: (puts the call on hold)
dialog: It's Skye Davidson. She needs directions
dialog: to the house. You invited Skye fucking
dialog: Davidson to our anniversary party?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Okay. I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell
dialog: you. It was the only chance I had to
dialog: meet her.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: You invited her to our anniversary party?
dialog: I didn't even invite my mother.
speaker_heading: JOE
text: She goes on location tomorrow. Sally,
dialog: I'm sorry. Look, I can't keep her on
dialog: hold.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (pissed)
dialog: No, no of course not. It's Skye fucking
dialog: Davidson, for fuck's sake.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (regards her)
dialog: You want me to uninvite her?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: No, no of course not. How old is she?
dialog: Twenty-fucking-two?
text: She gets out of bed, starts into the bathroom. The CAMERA is
dialog: with her.
speaker_heading: SALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: (into the bathroom mirror)
dialog: And she's a stinking fucking actress, for
dialog: fuck's sake.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (into the receiver)
dialog: Skye!
dialog: (his face lights)
dialog: I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's
dialog: our sixth, actually.
dialog: (flattered)
dialog: You read the book again? Well, no, the
dialog: ending to chapter six...it's just that
dialog: it's not filmic.
dialog: We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it
dialog: just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can
dialog: absolutely look at that again. If you're
dialog: coming from Laurel, you want to take
text: Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers
text: State Park. Three blocks west of that,
dialog: you want to hang right. It's about three
text: quarters of a mile up a big white thing
text: on the left.
text: Sally's started the bath, and is watching him from the
text: doorway. He meets her eyes mid-sentence.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh? I don't think tonight. I'm sure
dialog: they're well behaved. All our friends
dialog: have dogs, and they always want to bring
dialog: them. We'd be outnumbered, you see? So
dialog: we sort of put a ban on it. Sorry.
text: He rolls his eyes. Sally walks back into the bathroom, she
dialog: isn't buying it.
speaker_heading: JOE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm looking forward to meeting you, too.
dialog: And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're
dialog: willing to take this leap with me.
dialog: Eternally grateful, really.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (into the bathroom mirror)
dialog: I'm going to throw up.
speaker_heading: JOE (O.S.)
dialog: I can't imagine anyone else playing
dialog: Genna.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (sanguine)
dialog: Really?
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - LATER
text: The doorbell rings. There are two closed doors on either
text: side of the room. The bed shows no sign of consummated sex.
text: Joe comes through the left hand door, nearly dressed.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Who the fuck can be here at this time?
dialog: It's not even seven!
text: Sally comes through the other door, one shoe off, one on.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Oh Jesus, who else is always early for
dialog: Christ's sake?
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: Sally kisses his cheek on her way to the door.
speaker_heading: SALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'll say as little as possible.
text: Sally exits the bedroom.
speaker_heading: HOLD ON JOE
text: For a moment, then Sally re-enters, kisses him deeply.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I love you.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - EARLY EVENING
text: The house is filled with exquisite flower arrangements,
dialog: candles everywhere.
text: JERRY and JUDY ADAMS are on the porch, just beyond the glass
text: of the front door. Their argument is inaudible. They're in
text: their mid-thirties, conservatively dressed. She's stunning,
text: genetically nervous. Jerry carries a briefcase. She's got
dialog: the gift.
text: Sally opens the door. Hugs and buses them, hello.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I know we're early, we're so early.
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: You have to sign your taxes anyway.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (a grin)
dialog: Of course we do.
dialog: (to Judy)
dialog: We have to sign our taxes.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (kisses Judy; all charm)
dialog: You can never be too early or too thin.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Happy anniversary, buddy! Six months
dialog: ago, who would have thunk it?
text: Jerry hugs Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Well, not me, to be honest.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Don't fuck up again. It's got a ripple
dialog: effect. Sally suffers, we all suffer.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (offers)
dialog: We have a gift?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Thanks, I'll take that. Champagne?
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Lovely.
text: Joe moves toward the kitchen.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (a moment, to Sally)
dialog: We closed.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Fantastic.
dialog: (takes his hand)
dialog: Out here.
text: They step out onto the porch. Judy's left alone, unsure
dialog: whether to follow or not.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (finally, to no one, and to no
dialog: response)
dialog: The house looks beautiful, are those
dialog: hydrangeas?
text: She stands awkwardly in the middle of the foyer.
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk,
dialog: Chelsea, London, England. No small
dialog: doing.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I love you, you're a genius.
text: Behind them, in the foyer, Judy wanders aimlessly.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I suppose. Sally, that's quite a gift.
dialog: I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I adore him.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the
dialog: morning. The house had to go on the
dialog: market to insure the loan on the London
dialog: flat.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I know. I know that. Don't spoil it.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: What you earn has to double in order to
dialog: cover expenses in London, it's an
dialog: outrageously expensive city.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: We've only been over this how many times?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: You only made half your quote this year.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Well, you're a tower of support.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I worry because you don't. It's my job.
dialog: I'm feeling guilty. I would've liked it
dialog: if you waited until the two of you were
text: on more solid ground.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (direct, simple)
dialog: We couldn't be on more solid ground.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Whatever you say. Listen, I love you.
text: Otis is barking.
speaker_heading: JOE (O.S.)
dialog: Otis! No barking!
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (touched)
dialog: And Joe's huge in Europe. He's like a
dialog: rock star in London. His novels sell
dialog: millions.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Not millions.
speaker_heading: SALLY
text: He's directing now.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: They're paying him scale.
text: The CAMERA catches sight of Joe behind them. He moves
text: through the foyer and into the living room with a tray of
text: glasses and Judy in tow.
speaker_heading: SALLY
text: He gets huge advances on his novels.
dialog: He's going back to that. You know how he
dialog: hates it here.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: There's still time to undo this.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (kisses his cheek)
dialog: We'll be fine.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (re: barking dog)
dialog: Did you invite them?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: The Roses? And of course they said yes.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: That was the plan. And you're thrilled
dialog: to have them.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Whatever you say.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Did you tell Joe to behave?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Did he promise?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Scout's honor.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Before I forget.
dialog: (pulls a novel from his
dialog: briefcase)
text: Put it on the bookshelf.
text: She flips the book -- on the back is a full page picture of
speaker_heading: RYAN ROSE.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: You're out of your mind.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Just do what I say, alright?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: How much bowing and scraping do you want
dialog: us to do?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Beats a lawsuit.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Joe and Judy sit on opposite sides of the sofa -- slightly
text: uncomfortable with each other.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to fill the silence,
dialog: conspiratorial grin)
dialog: I love gifts. What did you guys get us?
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (chokes on the champagne)
dialog: Nothing that can't be exchanged.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh. Well. Good.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Congratulations on the deal. How
dialog: exciting. Is Sally doing Sally? I mean
dialog: it's Sally. The character that's based
text: on Sally. The character that's based on
text: Sally in the book.
speaker_heading: JOE
text: The novel. No, Skye Davidson is playing
dialog: the lead.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan.
dialog: She's very beautiful.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes, she is.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (trying harder)
dialog: But I am right, yes? She's based on
dialog: Sally.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It's a novel.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Still. Well. Let's drop it.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I'm not much of a reader, but I do love
dialog: autobiographies, even biographies
dialog: sometimes. Mostly non-fiction. Did you
dialog: read the new Styron?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: It's very good.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: I understand you won the Booker Prize.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes I did.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (another moment)
dialog: Is your script much like the novel?
dialog: Jerry says it's very good. But you know,
dialog: you read the novel, and then you see the
dialog: movie - and most of the time you say,
dialog: "what's this?" You know? I sometimes
dialog: think we're better off not reading the
dialog: novel at all. Because, we come with
dialog: expectations... and of course, we know
dialog: where we're going. Don't you find?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Don't I find what?
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I don't know why Joe, we've known each
dialog: other how long...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Not long.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (benign)
dialog: Don't be silly.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Joking.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Yes I know. I started to say... I
dialog: started to say Joe that --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Do I put you off?
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: You manage to throw me off balance. I
dialog: adore you.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: And I you.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: But I'm always afraid I'll say something
dialog: stupid.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Ah.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: And so I always manage to, do you see?
dialog: Like the book/script thing, do you see?
speaker_heading: JOE
text: Mmm hmmm.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER
text: CAL and SOPHIA GOLD are there with their children - JACK and
text: EVIE - eight and six respectively. Carrying gifts and totes
text: with toys and changes. Jerry and Sally have gathered them up
dialog: and ushered them in.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: You know Jerry.
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: Yes, of course.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I'm the wife. We've met.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (hugs her)
dialog: You, I know.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (to Evie)
dialog: Hey, beautiful girl.
text: She picks up the four-year-old, swings her around. Jack
text: hides behind his father's legs.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (a grin)
dialog: Jack? Jack, you promised.
text: The little boy comes out from behind his father's legs,
text: covers his eyes with his hands.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (sings)
dialog: Happy anniversary to you. We're glad Joe
dialog: came home. Don't split up again. Cause
dialog: we like the food.
text: Much laughter and clapping.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (in the archway)
dialog: Jack. Did you compose that yourself?
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Had a little help?
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: Absolutely not.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It has your ring.
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: I'm not that good.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Cal, my wife Judy.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Nice to meet you.
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: I think we've met, actually. No? At
dialog: another one of these things?
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: No, I don't think so.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (to Cal)
dialog: Congratulations on the Academy Award.
dialog: Great performance. Really warranted.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: He thought so.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Sally always manages to get robbed.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (a mortified grin)
dialog: Enough about me.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Evie has a little something for you.
text: Evie shakes her head.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA (CONT'D)
dialog: You do.
speaker_heading: EVIE
dialog: (even)
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Since when are you so shy?
speaker_heading: EVIE
dialog: (her mother's daughter)
dialog: Never.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (bright smile)
dialog: Honey, we have gifts for you and all
dialog: sorts of surprises. Where is America? I
dialog: know she's here somewhere.
text: Joe reaches for the gifts.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'll take them.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: No, I have a little talking to do with
dialog: America. Privately. I'll find her.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (to Sophia)
text: In the kitchen.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Who'd like to go and find Otis?
speaker_heading: EVIE
dialog: Me!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: The infamous dog?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: He's the best dog in the world.
dialog: (to Judy)
dialog: They're both coming tonight. Not my
dialog: idea.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Ours.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It's Jerry's worst idea.
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: The neighbors from hell. The kind that
dialog: lay in wait. I'd rather move actually.
dialog: Wouldn't I?
dialog: (to Sally)
dialog: Wouldn't I?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (small smile)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to the kids)
dialog: Okay. Last one to find Otis is a smelly
dialog: old bum.
text: Joe goes off with the children to find Otis. Cal sits at the
text: piano, plays.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Joe holds Evie in one arm. Jack stands beside him, holds his
text: hand. MONICA and RYAN ROSE face him across the threshold --
text: the NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS. She's in her late twenties - and
text: beautiful, eyes everywhere - star struck and house struck.
text: Ryan is somewhat older, a little awkward in company,
text: swallowing resentment and a little self righteous.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well, hello you two.
dialog: (putting Evie down; to Jack)
dialog: These are the people who live next door.
dialog: Say hello.
text: Jack does.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: And close the door, Jack. Because if we
dialog: leave it open, Otis will run out and you
dialog: know what will happen then?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Uh, uh.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: He'll run next door into their backyard
dialog: and he'll bark and bark and bark and eat
dialog: their pitbull for his dinner. Is it a
dialog: pitbull?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (not amused)
dialog: No, actually.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: Oh whatever. We don't want that to
dialog: happen, do we?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: RYAN
text: It's a rottweiler, actually.
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: I don't think our rottweiler is in any
dialog: danger, Jack.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well, Jack and I are very relieved.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I thought this was a party. Are we going
dialog: to talk about the dog thing?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Please, Ryan.
speaker_heading: JOE
text: (kisses her cheek and shakes
dialog: his hand)
dialog: No, he's absolutely right. You're
dialog: absolutely right, Ryan. Dog talk must be
dialog: banned. Canine conversations are
dialog: completely discouraged... it's really
dialog: good of you to join us. Can I get you a
dialog: drink?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Not for me, thanks.
text: An awkward moment.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: (checks with Ryan)
text: Something soft.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Right away. Are you sure you wouldn't
dialog: like something soft, Ryan?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I'm sure, yes.
text: Sally has watched some of this from the archway, joins them
dialog: super-friendly.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Hi. Monica and Ryan?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Sally?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Yes. And you've met Joe.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (a deep breath)
dialog: Well, so glad you decided to come.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: We could hardly say no.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Oh?
text: Joe slips the coke into Monica's hand.
speaker_heading: SALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: (takes the gift)
dialog: Thank you. This was so unnecessary. I
dialog: hope you've noticed that Otis isn't
dialog: barking as much. We keep him in at
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: At 4:30 today he barked for a solid
dialog: fifteen minutes. I have it on tape.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: You're keeping a record, are you?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: It's just very distracting when you're
text: trying to work.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Ryan.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: I'm sure you understand.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Well the neighborhood is full of dogs,
dialog: and it's not always Otis.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Well today it was Otis. And you should
dialog: keep him away from our yard. Because
text: Sheila will defend herself.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Ryan!
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (cuts off response from Joe; to
dialog: Ryan)
dialog: Are you working on a new book?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (caught short; flattered)
dialog: Well, yes, actually.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: He always has two or three going...
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Really? Joe can't manage more than one
text: at a time. With huge gaps in between.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: MAC and CLAIR FORSYTHE wave from the door. Clair's arms are
text: full of presents. Mac carries three video cameras under his
text: arm. He's got Otis by the collar.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: You lose this?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (re: Otis)
dialog: Ah there's our snookums now.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yes, well, but I haven't won a Booker
dialog: either. Or the Whitebread.
speaker_heading: MAC
text: The gate was open.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Well, not yet.
dialog: (she reacts to Mac)
dialog: The gate was open?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It's taken care of.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I think Ryan needs a new publisher. I
dialog: think he's outgrown him. They're just
dialog: not doing their job.
text: A silence. Awkward smiles go all around.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Hors d'oeuvres or something?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Yes, great! It's a beautiful house.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Thank you. I understand you're an
text: interior decorator.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I so wish I'd known.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Well, whoever did this is amazing.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I did it.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (comes on them with the
dialog: Forsythes in tow)
dialog: She rarely cops to it.
dialog: (kisses Sally's cheek)
text: Otis is home.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: (re: the gifts)
dialog: Where can I put these?
text: Sally takes the gifts from her.
speaker_heading: CLAIR (CONT'D)
dialog: What a fucking day! We only just got a
dialog: sitter. I don't know her from fucking
dialog: Adam. She could be a serial killer. I'm
dialog: going to have to call every ten minutes.
dialog: You have to let me give out the number.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: She already has.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: It's alright, isn't it?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Of course it's alright.
speaker_heading: MAC
text: Clair is a hovering mother.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: I'm not.
speaker_heading: SALLY
text: This is Monica and Ryan. Mac and Clair.
text: Clair takes a glass of champagne off the tray as they make
text: their way down the hall.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: (a wide professionally
dialog: ingratiating smile)
dialog: So nice...
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: And for us... Truly.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: You will never know.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (to Sally)
dialog: I have a four-thirty call. AM. So we
dialog: may have to leave early.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Why didn't you bring him?
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Why didn't you bring him?
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: (searches)
dialog: He's allergic.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: To dander. Otis.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: Didn't I say?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Well, probably.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: They can tell from the eyelashes, you
dialog: know? He's got eyelashes yay long. They
dialog: must be a foot long. The older you are
dialog: when you have a baby, the more likely
dialog: this stuff is to crop up.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (muted)
dialog: Oh.
text: The Roses are happy to stand there on the fringe. Next to
text: someone they've only seen on screen and magazine covers.
text: Clair's not in the least put off by them. She manages to
text: smile at them inclusively from time to time.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: So they tell me. Not soon enough, of
dialog: course.
dialog: (kisses her cheek)
dialog: How are you, Sal? You look fantastic.
dialog: It changes your life, you know. A baby.
dialog: It puts everything in perspective,
dialog: doesn't it. Doesn't it, Mac? You can't
dialog: be the center of your own world, anymore.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (as grounded as Clair isn't)
dialog: It's an object lesson in grace.
dialog: (on seeing Cal Gold on the back
dialog: porch)
dialog: Wow! Look who's here before me! My
text: leading man is on time for once.
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: (at the piano)
dialog: Those who can't direct.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Fuck you.
scene_heading: EXT. POOL AREA
text: Mac and Cal sit on the porch sharing a joint. Cal is maybe
text: the only living complete works of Shakespeare and pulls out
dialog: his most arcane quotes on occasion.
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: Are those our dailies? You're totally
dialog: outrageous. It's their anniversary. Is
dialog: nothing sacred! Well...so...how am I?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Oh man, you are so fucking funny in the
text: kitchen scene.
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: I liked the third take, the accidental
text: disaster with the silverware.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Nothing you do is accidental...
scene_heading: MEDIUM FULL SHOT
text: The CAMERA spots GINA TAYLOR through moving bodies. Tall,
text: beautiful, centered grace. She's got a Leica around her
text: neck... drops her two large camera bags on the floor.
text: Several of the other guests greet her, Mac among them.
speaker_heading: TIGHT CLOSE
text: Joe sweeps her up to his arms. It's an intimate,
text: appreciative embrace. Theirs was a mid-30s relationship,
dialog: certainly pre-Sally. Maybe his first important love.
speaker_heading: GINA
dialog: (re: the cameras)
dialog: I'm the hired help.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (affectionate)
dialog: Fuck you.
speaker_heading: GINA
dialog: I never put myself in harm's way.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Anymore.
speaker_heading: GINA
dialog: No, not anymore. Happy anniversary,
dialog: scout.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: Sophia bursts from the kitchen.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Oh my God! America told me your
dialog: neighbors are coming?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: And here they are!
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: And she was saying how happy you were to
dialog: finally have them over. Because you're
dialog: both, so, what - introspective? And you
dialog: should have done it ages ago. I'm Sophia
dialog: Gold.
dialog: (rescuing Sally)
dialog: Come meet my husband, Cal.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Cal Gold?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: The very one. And you are...
speaker_heading: SALLY
text: Monica and Ryan.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Rose.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Ryan Rose.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Yes.
text: She shakes his hand. He's amazed at the solid grip.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: He's a novelist.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Ah.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Like Joe.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Hmm.
dialog: (to Sally)
dialog: Where are my kids?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: In the guest room. I've laid out a paint
dialog: table for them.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I hope they're watercolors!
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Nevermind.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (to Monica)
dialog: Would you like to meet my husband?
text: It's all Monica can do to keep from putting her hand to her
dialog: chest.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I'd be thrilled.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Then he'll be thrilled.
text: She ushers them toward the living room.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (re: Sophia, appreciative)
dialog: She's such pure evil.
text: Sally approaches, gives Gina a warm kiss on the chest.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Thanks for coming.
speaker_heading: GINA
dialog: Happy anniversary. You're a good match,
dialog: you two.
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: Can you help me with this stuff?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (re: one of her bags)
dialog: That for us?
speaker_heading: GINA
dialog: What a nose. You missed your calling.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Can I open it?
speaker_heading: GINA
dialog: (defers)
dialog: Sally?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Please?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: He's impossible. Go on then.
text: Joe rips open the gift. It's a framed black and white of
text: Joe, Sally and Otis lying on the couch. It's clear which
text: photos in the house are Gina's. It's a breathtaking print,
text: an amazing caught moment. All light and shadow. A touching
dialog: study.
speaker_heading: SALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: (respectful of the talent)
dialog: It's beautiful, thank you so much.
text: Joe, moved somehow, hugs Gina to him. Kisses her.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I love you, Gina Taylor.
text: Sally's uncomfortable, a little jealous... feels intrusive.
dialog: Aware that Gina got there first. Knew him when. And always
text: captures something naked and vulnerable in his face.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GUEST ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: In the center of the room a low table with paints and crayons
text: and glue and baubles. Two child size chairs either side.
text: Empty, the table hasn't been touched.
text: Evie stands against the far wall. She wears a helmet and is
text: surrounded by toy suction arrows. The arrows make a perfect
text: outline of her head and body. Jack stands three feet away,
text: bow in hand -- the archer prepares his next shot.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: Cal is at the piano, charming the neighbors. Judy chats with
text: Mac. Jerry is on his cellphone, holding his Palm Pilot, his
text: hand pressed against his ear to block out the chatter. Sally
text: joins Cal on the piano stool. Sophia moves to Clair on the
text: couch, kisses her cheek.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You look so well, Clair. A wraith.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: You think so!? I've been working out a
dialog: lot since the baby.
dialog: And I've been working. And that takes
dialog: it's toll, you know.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I'm glad that's all over for me.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: Don't you miss it?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Never.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Not for a second. Cal can have all that.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: So where is young Jonah?
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: With a sitter. We have a sensational
dialog: sitter. Jonah's really comfortable with
dialog: her. You know, a second mom sort of.
dialog: Like part of the family. Amazing with
dialog: kids.
text: She inadvertently touches the beeper on her belt, and it
text: beeps. She jumps.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: What is that thing?
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: So this sitter can always reach me. I'm
text: still not used to leaving him.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You should have brought him.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Dander. He's allergic. Otis.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Oh. Do you have any pictures?
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: Pictures. They're always in my tote. I
dialog: left my tote in the damn trailer. But!
dialog: He's Mac all over again. Imagine Mac
text: shrunk to two-and-a-half feet. The fact
dialog: is they probably didn't even need me for
dialog: this birth.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Are you the funniest person I know, or
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: I can't think how you gave it all up,
dialog: Soph.
text: Sophia sends her a soft, content smile. Otis comes over and
text: nuzzles Clair's knee.
speaker_heading: CLAIR (CONT'D)
dialog: (freeks)
dialog: Oh my God, the dog!
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN/HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Clair leads Sally towards the bedroom.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
text: It sounds hysterical, but Otis just
dialog: rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like
dialog: to change into something of yours. You
dialog: know it could be disaster. He's so
dialog: allergic. It's terrifying.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Borrow whatever you like.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: I'll change back before we leave.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (pointed)
dialog: Whatever you like. I'm afraid it'll all
dialog: be too big for you.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: Are you alright, Clair?
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: I'm fine. I'm fine. Well, I'm a little
dialog: stressed. And I've been taking pills to
dialog: get my weight down since the baby.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I'd say it was down.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: And the doctor said they might make me a
dialog: little jumpy. I've got a ghastly
dialog: headache, actually.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: You want a Tylenol, or something?
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: I'd love a Xanex.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm
dialog: not breast feeding.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Why would she care?
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: You know Sophia. She's so damned
dialog: judgemental. And she's so damned...
text: perfect. And so fucking... serene. Just
dialog: fucking don't tell her. Because you know
dialog: Mac thinks she's God. And I can feel him
dialog: comparing.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: Just don't fucking tell her.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: It's not going to come up.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - LEVI PANES THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR - DAY
text: A Peter Sellers look-a-like holding a violin case.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (opens the door)
dialog: Panes! How are you?
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: Oh, you know, I am.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Has she called?
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: She'll never call again. She called last
dialog: week to tell me she'll never call again.
dialog: Where's Sally?
speaker_heading: SALLY (O.S.)
dialog: Here I am. Panes, my love!
text: Sally starts down the hallway.
speaker_heading: SALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: (for Panes; a long supportive
dialog: hug; a kiss)
dialog: Good, you brought your violin. I want
dialog: you to play.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: It's a machine gun. I thought I'd kill
dialog: myself.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Are you lovesick?
speaker_heading: PANES
text: Suicidal. It's much less codependent.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Will champagne help?
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: Not enough.
text: Sally takes Panes into the living room where everyone chats,
text: drinks, smokes. They all like each other out of habit, if
text: nothing else. Ryan and Monica are on the fringe, stand at
text: the edges of conversation. There's always someone at the
text: piano, and they can all pretty much play.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Panes is here!
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: (gives everyone a shy, pained
dialog: little wave)
dialog: Oh great.
text: Everyone stops, turns, toasts.
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Panes!
speaker_heading: MONICA/RYAN
dialog: (a little late; into silence)
dialog: Panes.
text: Panes gives them another little wave. Doorbell rings.
scene_heading: TIGHT CLOSE - SKYE DAVIDSON
speaker_heading: SKYE
dialog: Hi.
dialog: She's the young, beautiful actress who'll play the lead in
dialog: Joe's film.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (his face lights up)
dialog: Skye!
text: She's in jeans, but somehow looks dressed to the 9s.
speaker_heading: SKYE
dialog: You're Joe, aren't you?
dialog: (nods knowingly)
dialog: I recognized you from the book jacket.
text: Joe grins from ear to ear. Uncharacteristically star struck
text: in front of this beauty.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: How do you do, Skye?
speaker_heading: SKYE
dialog: Oh, I love that.
dialog: (throws arms around him)
dialog: I'm just great. I'm so happy to be here.
dialog: And I apologize for invading you. And
dialog: I'm so happy you asked me to. I'm so
dialog: touched. I know how private you and
dialog: Sally are.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (uncomfortable)
dialog: Yeah, well, it's just us and a few
dialog: hundred of our closest friends.
speaker_heading: SKYE
dialog: (genuine)
dialog: When I read your work I felt that you
dialog: knew me. Women must tell you that. And
dialog: this one in particular speaks to me, do
dialog: you know? I am Genna. How many women
dialog: must tell you that. And the script is
dialog: wonderful. Wonderful and lean and
dialog: visual...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm so happy you like it. I'm so
dialog: relieved you said yes, and I'm really,
dialog: um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to
dialog: finally meet you.
speaker_heading: SKYE
dialog: You're going to be a remarkable director,
dialog: a brilliant director.
text: There's a long moment.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (finally)
dialog: I think you're my first Goddess.
text: Sally and Panes have been watching from the living room.
speaker_heading: PANES
text: She's even better looking in the flesh.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Really? I need a drink. Come hide with
dialog: me.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
text: America and Rosa are working at the counter, Panes and Sally
dialog: come through.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Oh, Jesus, Panes. I can't, I can't
dialog: believe that bitch is in my house.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: You don't know she's a bitch.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: She's all over him, are you blind?
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: It could be worse.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: PANES
text: She could be playing the role in Joe's
dialog: movie that should be yours.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Fuck you, Panes.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: You see, that's worse.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I just wanted tonight to be with the
dialog: people we love.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: Like your business managers?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: They're not just our business managers,
dialog: Panes.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: Oh, okay, forgive me. Your neighbors are
dialog: here, for fuck's sake.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Exactly what I mean. It's all ruined.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: It's not ruined, for fuck's sake. It's
dialog: one of your parties.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I don't want it to be just one of our
dialog: parties.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: "How are you really doing, Panes?"
dialog: "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Like the last time.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: No. No, not like the last time. She was
dialog: the rest of my life.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Like the last time.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: I wasn't finished.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: "We can't stand seeing you like this,

dialog: "I'd love to, thanks."
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: It's our anniversary, Panes.
speaker_heading: PANES

speaker_heading: SALLY

speaker_heading: SALLY

speaker_heading: PANES

dialog: Come on in.
speaker_heading: SKYE
dialog: I'm in the same room with Sally Nash. Oh
dialog: my God. You're my icon. I've been
dialog: watching your films since I was a little
dialog: girl. Like, four years ago I followed
dialog: you all around the Beverly Center - at
dialog: least half a day, working up the courage
dialog: to introduce myself.
text: Joe enters the kitchen, watches.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I don't think I ever spent half a day in
dialog: the Beverly Center.
speaker_heading: SKYE
dialog: Whatever, do you remember? I've seen all
dialog: your movies. When I was in rehab, the
dialog: second time, they wouldn't even let us
dialog: see your drug addict movie. They said
dialog: you were too real. I worship you. And I
dialog: couldn't be more flattered, because I
dialog: know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie
dialog: is based on you as a young woman.
text: Joe winces, uncomfortable, picks up the bottle of wine and
dialog: leaves.
speaker_heading: SKYE (CONT'D)
dialog: And I'm overwhelmed. And I want to do it
dialog: justice. And I hope we can spend time
dialog: together. And I'm gushing. It's my
dialog: worst quality.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: Not at all.
speaker_heading: SKYE
dialog: Oh my god. I've been so rude. I'm Skye
dialog: Davidson. Has anyone ever told you, you
dialog: look like Peter Sellers?
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: No, never.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (overlapping Panes)
dialog: Everyday.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: I'm Levi Panes. Will you excuse us,
dialog: Skye? It's time for Sally's meds.
text: Panes steers Sally out of the kitchen.
speaker_heading: SALLY

speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (a moment; sotto)
dialog: Shit!
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: (re: the dress)

speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Shit. It's my Galiano.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: About five thousand dollars. With my
dialog: discount.

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: GINA (CONT'D)
dialog: I saw Lucy when I was in London, she

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Shit, I forgot to call her back. She's
dialog: off on a trip somewhere. Oh God, my
dialog: grandad's flat in London's been sold.
speaker_heading: GINA
dialog: In Cheyene Walk? Lucy's going to have a
dialog: meltdown. Oh, I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I should have damn well bought it. Well,
dialog: we can't afford it. The movie's going to
dialog: eat up a year of my life and I'm getting
dialog: paid next to nothing. Do you know how
dialog: much Skye Davidson's getting? Four

speaker_heading: GINA

speaker_heading: SALLY

speaker_heading: PANES

speaker_heading: SALLY

dialog: Having the time of my life. Mac's a
dialog: fantastic director. And what can anyone
dialog: say about Cal that hasn't been said. And
dialog: it's great working with friends, blah
dialog: blah blah.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: (a moment; little smile)
dialog: Um. Happy for you.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: So tell me, how's it going?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Oh you know. No doubts. No second
dialog: thoughts. Am I a monster?
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: You're my best friend.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: That's not an answer, is it?
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: Yes, you're a monster.
text: She takes his hand. Sounds of the party come from below.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: Thank you, Panes.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: You don't need to thank me.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (another moment)

speaker_heading: PANES

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: SANFORD JEWISON is at the piano playing his own stuff,

text: through the French doors at the pool, alone, a glass of

speaker_heading: MEDIUM CLOSE
text: Monica alone, uneasy, starts to pour herself a glass of

speaker_heading: JEFFREY

speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Monica.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY

speaker_heading: JEFFREY

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Hi. A little close in there.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Yup.
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS
text: A small, narrow room. Not much more than an alcove. With
text: space for a desk, stereo equipment, and shelves packed with
text: CDs. The topmost shelf is a line of record albums.
text: Joe's picking through the CDs. Monica wanders in from the
text: living room, toting a glass of champagne... watches him for a
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Your Eames table is incredible. And the
dialog: B&amp;B. I just put that in a client's home,
text: actually, but in red.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You're an interior decorator, right?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Sally did all this herself?
speaker_heading: JOE
text: In fits and starts -- and then, later, of
dialog: course, she had to accommodate me. So
dialog: things shifted a little bit then, became
text: more eclectic. And it keeps changing.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: (somehow at a loss)
dialog: Mmm. It says something about the two of
dialog: you maybe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.
dialog: (re: champagne)
dialog: I see you've moved up from the soft
dialog: stuff.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Oh, yes. You know Ryan's been sober
dialog: eight years. And it's difficult if I...
dialog: you know. It's better if I don't.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I'm a little nervous, so...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: A little out of my element.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No you're not.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Well, yes. Yes, in fact. A little on
dialog: the outside, yes. And there's been all
dialog: this friction.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Hm.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I don't know why, but these
dialog: misunderstandings have a way of
text: escalating.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Very well put.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I think a lot of this could have been
dialog: avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: But you're very private people. You
dialog: know, there's a kind of elitism...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (pissed)
dialog: Elitism?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: The wrong word, maybe. Delete that.
dialog: And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: And you know, he really does not.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: And Ryan works at home.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: And your phone calls are nasty and
dialog: abusive. And I've come this close to
dialog: suing you for harassment. And you're
dialog: only here because we're supposed to be
dialog: sucking up to you.
text: Her eyes well with tears.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh shit. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Well, that's what Ryan thought. I was
dialog: more generous, actually.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh shit. I'm sorry. I'm a total fucking
dialog: maniac. Delete all that, okay? I spoke
dialog: for myself, this needn't rub off on my
dialog: wife. Oh shit. I get pissy sometimes.
text: Much worse than Otis. Otis doesn't bite.
dialog: It's just, I really love my dog and he
dialog: doesn't really bark a lot.
dialog: We live in a canyon. We hear dogs
dialog: barking at night, too. And it's not
dialog: Otis.
text: Monica starts to laugh.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Alright.
text: It appears she's consumed more than one glass of champagne.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Easy tiger.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Alright. Please don't tell Ryan I'm
dialog: drinking.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Scout's honor.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: (grins)
dialog: I'll be your best friend.
text: She feels they've bonded. She pulls a well-thumbed copy of
text: Joe's novel from her purse.
speaker_heading: MONICA (CONT'D)
dialog: Would you sign it for me.
dialog: (digs for a pen)
dialog: I'm sure this is inappropriate.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: We're way past inappropriate.
text: Monica giggles, presses back the bubble rising in her chest
text: and moving toward her throat. Manages not to burp.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: (as he signs it)
dialog: I'll treasure this.
text: He moves towards the doorway, Monica at his heals.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I need to leave you now.

speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Oh. Well, yes. It's extraordinary. You

speaker_heading: RYAN

speaker_heading: JUDY

speaker_heading: JERRY

speaker_heading: SOPHIA

speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Funny.

speaker_heading: SANFORD
dialog: Funnies?
text: Panes does an "ON THE NOSE." Gets on all fours. Licks his

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: The Katzenjammer Kids.
text: The team applauds delight. Panes preens. Joe's team looks
text: over at Monica.
speaker_heading: JERRY

text: Jerry reaches into the hat. Looks at the clue.
speaker_heading: MAC

speaker_heading: JERRY

speaker_heading: TEAM (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: TEAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck...sounds like... Fork. Flock...
text: he does the finger sign again.
speaker_heading: TEAM (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SKYE

text: Jerry looks at her, amazed. She stands, throws hands up in

scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSE - AMERICA

speaker_heading: AMERICA
dialog: Dinner.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Dinner.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It's an unfair advantage.
speaker_heading: SALLY

speaker_heading: SALLY

text: Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
speaker_heading: SALLY

dialog: Oh how sweet.
text: The furball bares teeth and growls.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
text: She's insanely jealous.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - MEDIUM CLOSE ASTRID - NIGHT

text: her teeth.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: That's revolting, Astrid.
text: People sit in small groups, eating dinner, catching up.

text: Panes finds room next to Skye.
speaker_heading: PANES

speaker_heading: SKYE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PANES

speaker_heading: SKYE

speaker_heading: SKYE

speaker_heading: PANES

speaker_heading: SKYE

speaker_heading: PANES

speaker_heading: PANES (CONT'D)
dialog: (still Indian)
dialog: So you are well acquainted with this
dialog: Shostackovich, as am I.
text: Other arrivals pick their way through bodies and plates.
text: Walk over to Sally and kiss her cheek. Joe and Gina and

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I hate the idea of some one else living
dialog: in it.
text: Joe pulls Sally to him and wraps his arms around her.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Have I ever told you how Lucy and I

scene_heading: GINA/JEFFREY/SALLY
dialog: Yes./Often./I stopped counting.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: The dumb waiter was our...
speaker_heading: GINA
dialog: Escape hatch.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (eyes her)
dialog: Escape hatch. And Dad was having a go
dialog: about the garden. Something was
dialog: misplanted...
speaker_heading: SALLY
text: Not properly watered.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Whatever!
dialog: (to Gina)
dialog: You know how he gets. Well, he went
dialog: absolutely bonkers. Lucy and I were
text: frantically trying to scramble into the
dialog: dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more.
dialog: It was almost fatal. And that, my dear
dialog: friends, is the day...
speaker_heading: SALLY/JEFFREY

speaker_heading: GINA

speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: You're not upset that I brought the dog?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Would it make a difference?
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: Anouk isn't like a dog, really. More
dialog: like a small person. So is there anyone
dialog: here for me? No one looks new.
dialog: (fixes on Ryan)
dialog: Who's that?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: You don't want that. It's married and
dialog: it's the neighbor.

speaker_heading: CAL

text: Cal and Sophia carry sleeping children down the hall.
text: There are speeches about Sally and Joe, outrageously dirty,

speaker_heading: SKYE

speaker_heading: ASTRID

speaker_heading: SALLY

dialog: I want to try it, Ryan.
scene_heading: EXT. POOL - LATER
text: The drug has begun to take effect. The party is now in full
text: swing. Music is playing, and Sophia and Clair are dancing.
text: People are swimming, some naked, some in swimsuits. Judy
text: floats around the pool on an inflatable dog.
text: Sally and Skye cuddle together on one of the benches round
text: the pool, chatting; a friendly, feely touchy conversation.
text: Joe passes around bottles of water and chewing gum to
text: everyone, emceeing the event.
text: Everyone is relaxed and open, except Ryan, who sits beside
text: Monica at the edge of the garden, separated from the others.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I love it here. Don't you love it here,
dialog: Ryan? I love it here. And I love
dialog: tonight. And I love these people. And
dialog: this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.
text: (touches her own cheek, ever so
text: lightly; shivers against the
dialog: sensation)
text: Utterly fantastic.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: You know what Sally Therrian was saying
dialog: about your spine and your brain? She
dialog: didn't pull that out of thin air. It
dialog: causes brain damage. You'd better drink
dialog: a lot of water.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Do you want to go home, Ryan?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I think you should then. You should look
dialog: in on Sheila.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I'm not going to leave you alone.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: They're really nice people, Ryan.
dialog: They're like us...
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: They're nothing like us.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I think you need to speak for yourself,
dialog: Ryan. But I think you're really nice
dialog: people...
text: She puts arms around him, kisses his cheek. He stiffens.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Are you making an ass of yourself?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: There's only you, Ryan. You know what,
dialog: Ryan? You're beautiful. I love you so
dialog: much... You need...
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I don't need a drug.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: You need a good review and you'll be
dialog: fine. The whole color of the world will
dialog: change, mark my words.
text: She gets up.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Ready to go?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I'm going to go get my swimsuit. I do
dialog: know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you
dialog: mustn't worry.
dialog: (turns back)
dialog: Ryan, you're a great man.
text: The CAMERA follows Monica along the side of the pool. She
text: passes Sophia and a very exuberant Clair.
text: The CAMERA stays at the pool. Clair tears off Sally's
text: Galiano, flings it to the ground and dives topless into the
dialog: pool.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: This water is great!
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (swimming past her)
dialog: Wanna dive for a baton?
scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSE UP - JUDY
text: She stands at the side of the pool.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Okay, I'm about to throw five colored
dialog: batons in the water. Then I'm going to
dialog: count to three, and then you may start
dialog: diving. I'm playing too. The red one is
dialog: ten extra points. Ready?
dialog: (she throws batons in)
dialog: One, two, three, go!!
text: There is a melee of diving and screaming.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD LANDING
text: It's at the end of a bridge, overlooking the pool. Voices
text: drift up from below. Mac and Joe walk in circles pacing
text: around one another.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: You got your DP?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What? Oh yeah, the camera man? They
dialog: gave me a list.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: And you got Skye Davidson. Pretty big
dialog: leagues for a first timer. Do you even
dialog: like movies?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Not particularly. Weird, isn't it? God
dialog: I'm rally up. Do you feel anything yet,
dialog: Mac?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Kind of. Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver
dialog: Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're
dialog: friends. And great DP's I could give
dialog: them a call for you.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Thanks, Mac.
dialog: (regards him)
dialog: And thanks for being so supportive about
dialog: all this.
text: (throws arm around him, hugs
dialog: him close)
dialog: I really love you, you know.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy. Anything
dialog: I can do.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (lets go of Mac)
dialog: God, I really need to jump about a bit.
dialog: (begins jumping)
dialog: How's your film going?
speaker_heading: CAL
text: It's going. It's going.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: And how's the diva doing?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Well, you know...good days, bad days.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I meant Sally.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I meant Sally.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (stops jumping, studies him)
dialog: Oh. You're serious.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (throws and arm around him)
dialog: No. No.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Let me tell you something. Directing's
dialog: the best preparation possible for
text: fatherhood. The sleep depravation alone.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh don't. Everyone says that.
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC LIBRARY
text: Sally's taken Gina's photograph of them from the mantelpiece
text: in the living room, and looks for a spot for it on the CD
text: shelves. Sophia is studying the CDs very intently. They are
text: both bopping to the music.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (re: the photograph)
dialog: Isn't this a fabulous picture?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: She's such a great photographer.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Hm.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: So where should I put it?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I thought it was okay where it was.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: It's much more personal in here.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
text: A notch above the storage room.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: We're always in here.
dialog: (regards the photo)
dialog: She really gets him, doesn't she?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: The both of you.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: But she really gets to the heart of Joe,
dialog: doesn't she? She's a genius.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: So how much do you hate her?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Big time.
text: They both laugh, then...
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Well, I don't trust her. I never have.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: She took our wedding photos, for
dialog: chrissakes. You don't trust anyone.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (a moment simply)
dialog: I trust you.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Oh Soph...
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You'll hate it in London. It's wet and
text: miserable. A medical hellhole Sally.
text: It's socialized. Beds in the corridors.
text: Terrible plumbing.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: And the food sucks, I know.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You are not having your baby in London.
dialog: You're going to have your baby at Cedars
dialog: in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by
dialog: Dr. Milton Cohen. Period.
dialog: And you're getting that epidural right
dialog: away, don't let anyone talk you into any
dialog: of that Lamase bullshit. There's no
dialog: excuse for pain like that.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Sophia! I'm not even pregnant!
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Well good. Thank God.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Let's go in the kitchen and spy on
dialog: everyone.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Oh honey, let's.
text: They've started to walk through the house.
speaker_heading: SALLY
text: (stops short; turns to her)
dialog: What do you mean, thank God?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Well, are you sure about this baby thing?
dialog: It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: No, no, not at all... I mean I've still
dialog: got plenty of time. Don't I? I mean I
dialog: still have a good six years, whatever.
dialog: We could have three kids yet, if we
dialog: wanted. And I know I've always said I
dialog: never wanted kids, and I didn't... but
dialog: this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Honey, I'm not worried about you. You
dialog: are going to be a fantastic mom. Not an
dialog: issue. I pressed you, remember? Joe, on
text: the other hand, is a different story.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Oh Soph, Joe loves kids. Joe wants kids.
dialog: Joe thinks he needs kids.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: He wants playmates. Oh he's a
dialog: sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him.
dialog: But he's not going to be a good father.
dialog: He's just not parenting material.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Hey, let's sit down. I bet the rug feels
dialog: really nice against your skin.
text: Sally drops out of frame.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Don't try and change the subject.
dialog: (sitting, joining Sally)
dialog: Oh God, it feels great! He's just a
dialog: little narcissistic, irresponsible and
dialog: unreliable.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: And Cal's this massive adult?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Cal knows who he is. Did you notice how
dialog: happy Joe was when the drugs came out
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: You weren't exactly horrified.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I don't have a drug problem.
speaker_heading: SALLY
text: Neither does Joe.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: His sister does. Big time. And the New
dialog: York Times says addiction is genetic --
dialog: I'll e-mail you the article.
text: Sally stares at her friend suddenly mute, eyes wide.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't have kids to keep a marriage
dialog: together, Sally. It's only five months
dialog: since Joe came back.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: We're fine. We're great. We're having a
dialog: baby and we're moving to London.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (following her)
dialog: Well, you weren't fine last summer when
dialog: you went Sylvia Plath on me in
dialog: Connecticut.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Not nice. Not kind.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Ha! Not half so not kind as your husband
dialog: was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Why are you doing this?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: His image of you is a possessive, fragile
dialog: neurotic.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (tearing up)
dialog: But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (also tearing up)
dialog: No you are not. You're Sally Nash.
dialog: Listen to me, you're Sally Nash. You're
dialog: my best friend and I love you more than
dialog: anyone, and you're not going to move to
dialog: London to have the offspring of a
dialog: sexually ambivalent man-child. "Oh now
dialog: I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director..."
dialog: English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's
dialog: probably going to leave you for Skye
dialog: Davidson anyway.
text: They hug a bit weepy.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA (CONT'D)
dialog: He's always one step removed, always
text: looking over his shoulder always looking
dialog: for something else, something more
dialog: intoxicating, and I don't mean drugs. I
dialog: love him, Sal, but he's a child. He's
dialog: not ready.
text: (a choked sob, tears well and
dialog: fall)
dialog: Oh God, you're so lucky you don't have
dialog: kids. You can't stick your head in the
dialog: oven. You can't take a handful of
dialog: Percoden if you want to, or slit your
dialog: wrists. You can't do yourself in. Kids
dialog: rob you of that option. Trust me.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Oh my God, this ecstacy must be really
dialog: good.
scene_heading: EXT. POOL SIDE - CONTINUOUS
text: Joe and Cal sit by the edge of the pool watching Skye dance
text: by herself at the far end. Joe has his hand on Cal's chest.
text: Cal is stroking Joe's hair.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Isn't Skye amazing?
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: She's got great tits.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: She's a constant surprise.
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: And you've only just met.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty
dialog: seven and...
dialog: (taps his head)
dialog: The wisdom. She's an old soul. She knew
dialog: that Shostakovich thing. Did you notice?
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: Absolutely. And she's got great tits.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah, God she really does have great
dialog: tits, great tits. i can't wait to work
dialog: with her.
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: The camera loves her. A great actress.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: With great tits. I'm going to ask her if
dialog: I can touch them.
text: He gets up to go towards Skye, is stopped by...
scene_heading: EXT. MEDIUM SHOT - CLAIR
text: Clair is climbing up the pool steps.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: Has anyone seen Mac?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (pointing further up the
dialog: property)
dialog: I saw him wandering over there, I think.
dialog: How're you feeling, Clair?
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: I'm so good.
text: She kisses Joe and Cal, and goes off to find her husband.
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: Poor Mac. It's been a bit of a struggle.
dialog: I'm sure Sally's told you.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No, what?
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: The movie.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh, she's really enjoying it. I think.
dialog: Is Mac okay?
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: I don't know what's going on. I don't
dialog: care to guess. Mac's really unhappy.
dialog: She isn't there, that's all. She's no
text: idea what she's playing, not a clue.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Who, Sally?
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: And, you know it isn't rocket science,
dialog: this script. She can barely get the
dialog: lines out. There was a scene last week -
dialog: she sobbed, through every take. I know
dialog: crying's easy for her but it's a fucking
dialog: comedy, Joe. Something's gone. You
dialog: know, that thing that was Sally - that
dialog: always surprised you. It's gone. I
dialog: think she's scared. And that's death.
speaker_heading: JOE
text: I still think she sails above the rest.
dialog: I mean not like her early films. But
dialog: those were all such great directors.
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: Mac's a pretty great director, Joe. He's
dialog: a woman's director. And nothing's
dialog: happening. Course he won't fire her,
dialog: because of the friendship... But it was
dialog: discussed. He had to battle his studio
dialog: to get her in the first place.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: Hey, listen, I love her. She's Sophia's
dialog: best friend.
dialog: (to Joe's stare)
dialog: I never said any of this, alright. I'll
dialog: deny it on the stand...
dialog: (into the silence)
dialog: You guys are gonna have kids. That is so
dialog: great. Maybe that's what this is all
dialog: about. Maybe she doesn't want to do this
dialog: anymore. You know adults don't do this
dialog: for a living. You guys are gonna have
dialog: your kids, you'll be directing -- one
dialog: asshole in the family is enough. Sophia
dialog: knew that intuitively. Look at Clair.
dialog: Clair's a mess.
text: (throws an arm around him)
dialog: Make sure she gets the epidural. Forget
dialog: that natural childbirth shit.
dialog: Everything's going to be what it's
dialog: supposed to be. "Life is but a walking
text: shadow. A poor player who struts and
text: frets his hour upon the stage and then is
dialog: heard no more..." And speaking of me, the
dialog: role of Leo in your film?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (stares at him)
dialog: Leo?
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: Any thoughts on casting yet?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (regards him)
dialog: Leo? It was out to Jude Law. Jude
dialog: passed.
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: Well, I can't make any promises, and of
dialog: course I haven't read the script but I
dialog: loved the novel...when are you shooting?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: October-ish.
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: I have a small window of time.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Leo. Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
speaker_heading: CAL
text: Scratch the two, write in a four.
speaker_heading: JOE
text: Scratch the two, write in a four.
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: You've got a lot of fucking gall. Thirty
dialog: nine.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Five years ago, I was at the party,
dialog: remember?
text: Joe looks up and sees Sally standing in the sun room. He
text: blows her a kiss. She kisses her finger tips and puts her
text: hand flat against the window pane.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM CLOSET - TIGHT CLOSE - SALLY
text: She's in her wardrobe pacing back and forth a bit frantic.
text: Trying on clothing, tossing garments to the ground. The
text: floor is a heap of discarded ideas. She pulls on jeans and a
text: t-shirt. Very similar to what Skye is wearing. She sits a
text: moment on the floor. The sounds of the party below are
dialog: muted.
speaker_heading: SALLY (O.S.)
dialog: Oh Warren, that was awful, I can't sing.
text: The CAMERA stays with Sally as she gets to her feet, walks

scene_heading: INT. DAILIES ROOM - NIGHT
text: Mac is on the edge of the couch, elbows on knees, staring at

scene_heading: INT. MOVIE SET
scene_heading: CAL'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S.)
dialog: You sing like a bird.
scene_heading: SALLY'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S.)
text: A bird with dropsy. A caged bird. That
dialog: hasn't long to live.
scene_heading: CAL'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S)
dialog: You seem so alive up there.
text: Sally stands at the open door. Stunned. Watches Mac watch
text: her. Watches herself, with a professional, acute eye. More
dialog: critical than Mac's could ever be.
speaker_heading: SALLY (ON TV)
dialog: I was faking it. I've been feeling caged
dialog: for sometime. Funny, huh?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (moans)
dialog: No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - CLOSE SHOT - SALLY
text: She backs up into the corridor mortified. Leans against the

scene_heading: CAL'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S.)

speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: You can cut around it, whatever it is.
dialog: You always do.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Not this time.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: It's always not this time. If you can do
dialog: it around me, you can do it around
dialog: anyone.
text: She walks in front of the television set, blocks it with her
text: body, switches it off.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (an observation)
dialog: You don't have any clothes on.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: How nice for everybody. Come swimming.
dialog: The water's glorious.
dialog: (re: the film)
dialog: You'll fix it. You'll come up with one
dialog: of your brilliant ideas.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Or I won't. I can't help her. I'm out
dialog: of my depth.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: Things always look much worse in the
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I don't know how to make her funny.
speaker_heading: CLAIR
dialog: You're coming swimming in the pool, and
dialog: in a few minutes you won't even remember

speaker_heading: MAC

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: MONICA

speaker_heading: JOE

scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD LANDING - NIGHT
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I've never done this before.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh? It's easy. You just put one foot in
dialog: front of the other... That's a good girl.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I'm a little in the puke zone.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (giving her some water)
dialog: Here, drink this. Drink lots of water.
dialog: (puts the bottle in her hand)
dialog: Hold on to this. Take deep breaths.
dialog: Nice and slow.
text: (sits her down; produces a
dialog: lollipop)
dialog: Would you like a lolly?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: What am I, five?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You're never too old for a lolly. I'm
dialog: having one.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: (a grin)
dialog: Okay.
text: He pulls out another one.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Lemon or raspberry?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Lemon.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Lemon it is.
text: The two suck on their lollipops for a moment.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: (finally)
dialog: Ryan's really angry with me.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I think he's really angry with me too.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: It's really not the same thing.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: He was really nicer when he drank.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Eight years, though. That's quite an
dialog: accomplishment.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That's a lot of those.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Medallions.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: A lot of cakes.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: And he doesn't smoke?
speaker_heading: MONICA
text: He has to find non-smoker's meetings that
dialog: used to be almost impossible, you know?
dialog: It's gotten much better.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: How long have you been married?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Nine...nine, yes? Nine years, just
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You must have been a baby.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Oh yes. Nineteen...just.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: I'm cold.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Come here.
text: Joe holds Monica.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: That's very nice.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I like you.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I'm so glad. You know, I recognize that
dialog: passage in your book. The bit about us
text: running into each other in the movie
dialog: theatre.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I know you changed it to a bookstore.
dialog: And the color of my hair. But the moment
dialog: was exactly the same. The same, you
dialog: know, dynamic. And almost verbatim,
dialog: wasn't it?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (humors her)
dialog: Yeah, it was. For a writer nothing's
dialog: sacred.
dialog: (thinks a moment)
dialog: No, nothing at all.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I think it's great that I made an
dialog: impression at all, you know.
text: Joe regards the open trusting face, is touched by it. Leans
text: in, kisses her lips very lightly... and again. Her arms
text: can't make up her mind, whether to come up around him or not.
dialog: Finally do.
speaker_heading: SALLY (O.S.)
dialog: Otis!! Otis, come! Oh fuck!
text: She appears beside them.
speaker_heading: SALLY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: How long ago was it?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
speaker_heading: MONICA

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: SALLY

speaker_heading: SALLY

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: So you were here when they were doing the

speaker_heading: AMERICA
dialog: Oh yes.
speaker_heading: RYAN

speaker_heading: AMERICA

speaker_heading: RYAN

speaker_heading: AMERICA

speaker_heading: RYAN

speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: AMERICA

speaker_heading: MONICA

speaker_heading: RYAN

speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I left the gate open and Otis got out!

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: God willing.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: We have to find the dog, Ryan.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: (regards him)
dialog: Because we're nice people, and because
text: what goes around comes around.
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: Because, God help you if something

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: All the ugly phone calls? We're not the

scene_heading: EXT. CANYON - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: Otis!! Shostakovich identified with the
dialog: Jew. He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed
text: under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
speaker_heading: SKYE
dialog: Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis,
dialog: come!!
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: Andre Zhdanov? How the hell do you know
dialog: about Andre Zhdanov?
speaker_heading: SKYE
dialog: Who doesn't know about the infamous
dialog: composer's conference of 1948 where
dialog: Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet
dialog: Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and
dialog: Myaskovsky.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute
dialog: girls don't know.
speaker_heading: SKYE
dialog: Do Peter Sellers again.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: (a la Sellers)
dialog: Otis you crazy dog! Otis are you in this
dialog: God forsaken Canyon? My people are very
dialog: hungry.
speaker_heading: SKYE
dialog: I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I
dialog: played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who
text: gets shot in the head, and they used
text: Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
speaker_heading: SKYE
dialog: Exactly! So I dug it, and I did a lot of
dialog: research.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: Do you really, you really, like
dialog: Shostakovich?
speaker_heading: SKYE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: Would you, like, marry him?
speaker_heading: SKYE
dialog: If he were still alive, maybe.
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: How about someone who really really liked
dialog: Shostakovich?
speaker_heading: SKYE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Are you asking me to marry you?
speaker_heading: PANES
dialog: No, I'm just testing to see how deeply

speaker_heading: SKYE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Very.
speaker_heading: PANES

dialog: Otis!!!!
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Otis, good boy, come here. Oh my god, oh
dialog: my god, oh my god.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: This is a nightmare. We should have kept
text: him upstairs.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: It was done. When Sophia put the kids to
dialog: bed, America brought Otis in the room and
text: closed the door. It was done.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well someone clearly let him out before
text: Monica opened the gate.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're
dialog: at it. But I guess that's what I
dialog: interrupted.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Jesus, Sally. You are a medical miracle.
dialog: The only person who's ever taken ecstacy
text: and become angrier.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Yeah, let's talk about that. You seem to
dialog: be rather an expert. I don't remember in
dialog: the last five months of counselling your
dialog: ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage
dialog: parties.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Rave parties?! That's so typical - you
dialog: would think it was called rage. Perfect!
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: What else don't I know about, Joe? Let's
dialog: get really clear here.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Sally, so I took a few pills. I went out
dialog: dancing. I tried to forget how upset I
dialog: was about splitting up with you. I
dialog: haven't lied to you. I told you about
dialog: the people I've slept with. I just
dialog: didn't mention the few occasions I took
dialog: drugs because you're so fucking
dialog: judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end
dialog: of it, and you have so little faith and
dialog: so little trust in me. Sally, we're
dialog: back, I love you. Trust that. Please
dialog: let's not do this.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Otis! Come! Good boy! Come!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Otis!
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I'm not sure we understand that word in
dialog: the same way.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Love?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: You walked out on a five year marriage.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That hasn't the first fucking thing to do
dialog: with love. It's whether we can live
dialog: together... like this! All the time.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: It's not like this all the time.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: DO I want anyone else? No. Do I want to
dialog: be with you for the rest of my natural
dialog: life? I'm trying.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: And how hard it hit?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Just stop right there, Sally. We've been
dialog: through this.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: You've been through it. That's how you
dialog: love people. When it's easy for you,
dialog: when it's convenient for you.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Sally, first of all, you're talking
dialog: bullshit. And second...
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: You want to talk about bullshit? Lucy
dialog: called you three times this week. She's
dialog: a fucking mess, Joe. Your sister is a
dialog: fucking mess. She needs you. I talk to
dialog: her more than you do.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That is not true.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: It is true. You know how you love, Joe?
dialog: You dedicate a book to someone.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Every novel I've had published in every
dialog: language I've dedicated to Lucy.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Right. And when was the last time you
dialog: spoke to her?
text: Joe is silent.
speaker_heading: SALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: And how fucking dare you cast Skye
dialog: Davidson in that part? Have you any idea
dialog: how humiliating that is for me? I'm an
dialog: actress! It's about our marriage for
dialog: fuck's sake. Everybody knows that...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It's a novel.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: About me!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Who the fuck do you think you are? The
dialog: part of Genna is not just about you.
dialog: It's about every woman I've ever loved in
dialog: my entire life. Including my mother.
text: The character is also clearly in her
dialog: early twenties, Sally.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: What are you saying?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Hello? Last birthday was?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I don't look my age, Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Sally, I have never considered you for
dialog: this part because you are too old to play
dialog: it. And you are out of touch with
dialog: reality if you think differently.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: It's a shit novel anyway.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well there you go. I let you off the
dialog: hook. You're one goddamn lucky actress.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Not really. I mean your books have
dialog: always been pop, but this is the
dialog: shallowest of the bunch. That's what all
dialog: our friends think, anyway.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Okay. If we could've, by some miracle,
dialog: stripped ten years off your face, still
dialog: couldn't have got the thing made.
dialog: Because I don't mean anything as a
dialog: director, and your name doesn't mean fuck
dialog: all anymore. And the people that can
dialog: hire you are afraid to, because they
dialog: think you're phoning it in. That you
dialog: don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Who? Who? Who thinks that?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Your director and your co-star of your
dialog: current movie. Don't dish if you can't
dialog: take it, Sally.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Mac? Mac says it? Cal?
text: Joe doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: SALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Cal, too?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Sally, for Christ's sake.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Anyone else?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: This is insanity.
dialog: (moves toward her)
dialog: Sally...
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Don't.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Don't push me away.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I had an abortion two weeks ago.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Don't do this.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I found out I was pregnant and it scared
dialog: the shit out of me.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (threatens)
dialog: Don't do this!
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I told you when we met I never wanted
dialog: children. I don't want kids in my life.
dialog: We talked about it. You weren't
dialog: listening.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You changed your mind.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I wanted you back.
text: Joe slaps her hard across the face.
speaker_heading: SALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: You think this was to hurt you?! My God,
dialog: Joe. It isn't about you.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What?! You aborted our child?!
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I'm a monster. Exactly.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You're not ready.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Don't make allowances. I'll never be
dialog: ready. Some people just shouldn't have
dialog: children. I'd be a terrible fucking
dialog: mother, Joe. I did want it for us. But
dialog: I couldn't do it. I don't really think I
dialog: can do it.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I wasn't part of that picture at all, was
dialog: I? I wasn't part of that decision. Did
dialog: I occur to you at all? It's a fucking
dialog: farce. It's a fucking farce. How long
dialog: did you think you could keep it going.
dialog: You're amazing. Do you have any idea
dialog: what you've done to us?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'll never forgive you.
speaker_heading: SALLY

text: Oblivious, Judy and Clair turn somersaults.

text: He pulls a towel off a stack and they all fall on the floor.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh shit. I can't fucking do anything

dialog: for having Jerry here to save me. I
dialog: promise I will never cheat on my wife
