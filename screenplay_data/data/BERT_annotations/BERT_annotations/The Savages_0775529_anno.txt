scene_heading: SUPERTITLE: SUN CITY, ARIZONA
dialog: We are floating through America’s premiere master-planned

scene_heading: ON A RESIDENTIAL STREET 5
text: A handsome ELDERLY COUPLE on A BICYCLE BUILT FOR TWO.
dialog: 
text: As soon as the bicycle has cleared frame, the CAMERA
text: PICKS OUT A HOUSE and begins to MOVE SLOWLY toward the
text: drawn curtains of the front window. This is one of Sun
dialog: city’s more humble model-home offerings. Eventually we
dialog: are transported into —-
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - DAY 6
text: It's dark in here, but bright sunlight peeks in around the
text: closed drapes making dust particles visible.
text: Still on the move, the CAMERA locates --
text: LENNY SAVAGE, 80, sitting at one end of a dining room table,
text: hunched over a bowl of cereal. He is shirtless and moves
text: slowly. Lenny has the labored chewing style of a man who
text: wears dentures, but that does not deter him from indulging
text: in his favorite crunchy cereal: Wheat Chex.
dialog: It might be “fun in the sun” for others in this retirement
dialog: community, but here, where Lenny lives, life ain't so grand.
text: From another room, A MAN’S VOICE wafts i
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (0S)
dialog: Upsy daisy, thatta girl. We're gonna get

text: THE CAMERA, following the sound of the voice, PANS AWAY
text: from Lenny’ and LOOKS DOWN A HALLWAY INTO —
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A BEDROOM 7
text: Through the door we see an obstructed view of DORIS METZGER,
text: 80, a frail woman sitting on the side of her hospital-style
text: bed, staring into space. She is being attended to by a home-
text: health-care worker, EDUARDO, 45, in green surgical scrubs
text: and a hair-net. He WALKS IN AND OUT of VIEW as he prepares
dialog: Doris for her day.
speaker_heading: EDUARDO
dialog: We're gonna get you all fixed up nice and
dialog: take some pictures for your daughter --
text: He exits the room HUMMING CHEERFULLY then disappears into

speaker_heading: EDUARDO (OS) (CONT’D)
dialog: Somebody forgot something in the
dialog: bathroom!
text: Then, the DISTINCT SOUND OF A TOILET SEAT BANGING against

scene_heading: THE DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 8
text: He stops in front of Lenny.
speaker_heading: EDUARDO (CONT'D)
dialog: Lenny, you forgot to flush.

speaker_heading: LENNY
dialog: I’m eating my cereal, don’t ya see?
speaker_heading: EDUARDO
dialog: I need to use the restroom.

speaker_heading: LENNY
dialog: You do it.
speaker_heading: EDUARDO
dialog: As you already pointed out, you are not

text: Eduardo marches over to Lenny, SNATCHES THE BOWL OF
text: CEREAL and takes it into the ADJOINING KITCHEN.
speaker_heading: LENNY
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
text: Eduardo puts the BOWL inside the REFRIGERATOR.
speaker_heading: EDUARDO
dialog: Take care of your business in the
dialog: bathroom and then I/1l return you your
dialog: Wheat Chex.
text: Eduardo FLINGS the REFRIGERATOR DOOR SHUT and exits.
dialog: 
text: THE CAMERA PUSHES IN ON THE REFRIGERATOR where we see -
text: A MAGNET HOLDING A PHOTO OF DORIS AND LENNY
text: on a cruise, in happier and healthier times. They hold
text: glasses of Champagne, frozen in a festive toast.
dialog: 
text: AT THE DINING TABLE --
text: Lenny is humiliated and bereft, with only his spoon to
text: comfort him. He gets up and shuffles out of the room,
text: revealing that he’s not wearing pants, just high-waisted
text: JOCKEY BRIEFS and a pair of BLACK NYLON KNEE SOCKS.

scene_heading: CLOSE ON LENNY’S FACE -
text: frozen in an expression of doom. ‘This confrontation with
text: his own excrement seems to confirm what Leonard Savage
dialog: already knows to be true -- that his life is shit and
dialog: it’s almost over. But then -- What's this? Lenny has an

scene_heading: INT. OFFICE BUILDING - BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT 16
text: A large sparsely populated room with many desks and

text: WENDY SAVAGE, 39, sits at a desk with a scribbled upon
text: FOLDER before her. On the tab it reads: FELLOWSHIP AND
text: GRANT APPLICATIONS. After a furtive glance around the
dialog: room, Wendy types.
speaker_heading: WENDY (VO)
dialog: Dear Selection Committee. If awarded your

text: Wendy glances over the top of her cubicle and SEES the
text: disembodied HEAD OF MATT, her manager, fast approaching.
text: With a quick click of her mouse, she brings a SPREADSHEET
text: up on the computer then covers her FOLDER with AN
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTING FILE.
speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (hard working employee act)
dialog: Hey, Matt.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: How's it going? You getting anywhere?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Just trying to power through.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Do what you can. Don’t kill yourself.
text: As soon as Matt is gone, A NEIGHBORING FEMALE CO-WORKER
text: with a pierced lower-lip smirks conspiratorially at
text: Wendy. Wendy acknowledges the look, but as she returns
dialog: to writing her letter it’s clear that she wants to
dialog: believe she has a higher calling than the other temps.
speaker_heading: WENDY (VO)
dialog: Inspired by the work of Jean Genet, the

scene_heading: EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT 18
text: Wendy exits, bundled up in a vintage coat and scarf. She
text: crosses the deserted street and arrives at ——
speaker_heading: A MATLBOX -
text: where she removes SEVERAL MANILA ENVELOPES from her satchel.
text: In a private little ritual, she presses them against her

scene_heading: EXT. EAST VALLEY STREET - NIGHT 1g
text: Wendy walks down the street with a BAG OF TAKE-OUT and
text: arrives at her APARTMENT BUILDING.
text: She is about to unlock the front door when it swings open
text: and a YOUNG EAST VALLEY COUPLE emerge, followed by a
text: group of their care-free friends. Wendy finds herself
text: stuck holding the door open as they pass, painfully aware
text: that they are all at least ten years younger.
text: As the last friend exits, he thanks Wendy as though she
dialog: were a doorman.
scene_heading: INT. WENDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 20
text: Wendy enters carrying her TAKE-OUT BAG, KEYS and a SMALL
text: PILE OF MAIL in her teeth.
text: GENGHIS KHAN, Wendy's cat, jumps off the couch and greets

dialog: wanders over to —~
text: THE TELEPHONE TABLE where the answering machine BLINKS. Wendy

scene_heading: A LOUD BUZZER BUZZES.
text: Wendy, slightly startled, clicks the machine off and, still
text: holding the can of cat food, heads to the door.
text: THE CAMERA stays behind, PANNING OFF of Wendy and PUSHING INTO
text: A CLOSE UP OF THE ANSWERING MACHINE still blinking ominously.
speaker_heading: AT THE DOOR -~
text: Wendy presses her eye to the peephole.
scene_heading: THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE -~
text: LARRY, an attractive middle-aged guy, stands in the hall.
text: With a quick fluff of her hair, Wendy opens the door.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Hi.
text: A strange pause as they stand in the doorway.
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT’D)
dialog: Is this a bad time? I saw your lights
dialog: come on.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: No. I'm just...you know...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Oh, okay, then I don’t want to disturb...
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: No. Do. Imean, if you can. Can you?
text: Larry nods yes and smiles -- a naughty gleam in his eye.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I got Marley.
text: Wendy looks down to see Marley, AN OLD GOLDEN LAB with a
text: greying muzzle. Wendy smiles at Marley and opens the
text: door to let them in.
scene_heading: A MOMENT LATER ——
text: (HE CAMERA PUSHES IN FAST -- Larry has Wendy up against a
text: wall and is kissing her hungrily, undoing her pants and
text: pulling at her clothes.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (coming up for air)
dialog: Let's go to the bed.
text: He continues to devour her.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I like it here. Let’s do it on the floor.
text: He slides to the floor and tries to pull her down with him.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: No, come on Larry.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I need you. Feel how hard my cock is.
text: Wendy is disgusted. She pulls away from him.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I don’t want to. The floor is gross.
text: Wendy turns and begins to toss pillows off the nearby
speaker_heading: FUTON COUCH.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: You used to like it on the floor -- when
dialog: you first moved in, remember?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Yeah, well, not any more.
text: In a well practiced maneuver, she yanks at the base of
text: the couch, pulling it forward -- FLUMP! -- transforming
text: it into a bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
text: It's middle-aged and depressing. It
dialog: makes me want to cry.
text: Without a trace of romance, Wendy begins to remove her
dialog: shirt.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What's the matter?
dialog: lo.
text: Wendy shakes her head, dismissing the question. Marley
text: wants to climb up onto the bed but is too arthritic to
text: manage so Wendy hoists her up by her haunches. She plops
text: down next to Marley and Larry sits down beside her.
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I've got things going on.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What things?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Just things, Larry. Things. It's
dialog: personal.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (kissing her neck)
dialog: I thought this was personal.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: It's personal medical, okay? It’s
dialog: cervical.
text: Larry stops kissing her neck and gives Wendy his full
dialog: attention.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT’D)
dialog: I had a Pap Smear. Something was
dialog: irregular. And then I had to have
dialog: another Pap Smear. They just called with
dialog: the results —-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: And -- ?
dialog: Wendy wants special attention -- even if it means
dialog: fabricating tragedy.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: 
dialog: And it’s... not, you know, for sure yet,
dialog: but they might have to go in and take
dialog: something out to test and see if it’s...
dialog: you know, God forbid...
text: Larry presses his head against her chest and rubs her
text: belly protectively.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I’m sorry, Wen.
text: Wendy basks in the affection, UNTIL
dialog: 
dialog: ql.
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Annie had that.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: A cervical thing. Some kind of
dialog: procedure.
text: Wendy looks at him, her disbelief mounting.
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I went with her to the appointment. She
dialog: said it was pretty painless. A little
dialog: sore afterwards, but basically--
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I really don’t need to hear about your
dialog: wife's cervix, right now.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I'm trying to be comforting.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Yeah, well it’s not. It’s upsetting.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Okay. Sorry.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: God.
text: A silent moment as they just sit there side-by-side.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Do you want me to go?
text: Wendy shakes her head no.
dialog: cur To:
text: OVERHEAD CLOSE-UP of Wendy with Larry on top, moving
text: rhythmically. She tries to get lost in the sex but can’t.
text: She opens her eyes and looks at the ceiling. After a few
text: moments, she turns her head and finds herself staring into
text: the sad eyes of Marley. She reaches for a paw. Wendy and
text: Marley stay like that gazing into each other’s eyes while
text: Larry fucks her.

speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: c'mon Marley.
text: Marley licks Wendy’s face, hobbles off the bed and joins
dialog: Larry.
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Goodnight.
text: Wendy watches from the bed as Larry and Marley leave.
speaker_heading: STILL LATER ~~ 25
text: Wendy shuffles out of the kitchen eating her take-out. She

dialog: answers.
speaker_heading: JON

speaker_heading: WENDY (ON PHONE)

dialog: them there for this guy Eduardo to find

speaker_heading: JON
dialog: Wendy, what the fuck are you talking
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I am talking about Dad!
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: There’s something wrong with him. I got
text: a phone call. He’s losing his mind or
dialog: something. He's acting out with his

dialog: using it to piss this guy off.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: What guy?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Doris’s caregiver guy. Here, listen.

speaker_heading: JON

speaker_heading: JON
dialog: I’m not leaving you alone, I’m just

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: We don’t even know where the man lives

speaker_heading: JON
dialog: Wendy, we are not going to have to go out

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: We have to do something. This is a
dialog: crisis.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: Look, I’m not sure if this actually
dialog: qualifies as a crisis. It’s an alarm,
dialog: okay. But it’s not a crisis. Not yet.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (after a reflective pause)
dialog: You mean it’s like we’re in orange?
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: What--? Yeah, right. Exactly. But

speaker_heading: JON

speaker_heading: LENNY

speaker_heading: WENDY

scene_heading: EXT. BUFFALO STREET - DAY 59

speaker_heading: JON

speaker_heading: WENDY

speaker_heading: JON
dialog: (shivering, but amused)
dialog: oh yeah?
speaker_heading: WENDY
text: With a big mouth full of metal. How come

speaker_heading: JON
dialog: Have you ever looked at my teeth?
dialog: ‘They're still crooked.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Yeah. How come?
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: ‘cause Dad never paid the bills and the

text: Wendy snort-laughs.
speaker_heading: JON (CONT'D)
dialog: So, I think I found something.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: A place with an opening that can take him
dialog: right away.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: What kind of place?
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: A facility for older people. In this
dialog: country we call them nursing homes.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I thought we were gonna try assisted
dialog: living.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: They're not going to take him in assisted
dialog: living, Wendy! Let’s be real. He’s got
dialog: dementia.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Well don’t lead with that.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: Look, if it’s any consolation -- this
dialog: place -- they don’t call it a nursing
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: What do they call it?
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: A Rehabilitation Center. It’s called The

dialog: 
text: Lenny, sitting in a wheelchair, all ready to go. He’s been

text: with SUSPENDERS, TROUSERS and a BASEBALL CAP, like a kid
dialog: dressed for school by somebody else’s mother-
text: Wendy is struck by the poignancy of this but moves on
dialog: with the business at hand.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Hi Dad.
text: After a little delay, Lenny pulls his attention away from

dialog: 62
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: LENNY
dialog: Hi ya.
text: There is a glimmer in his eye, a tiny smile on his face.
text: Lenny seems to have some vague feeling of hope, not unlike the
text: way a dog senses that his beloved family is planning a

text: baseball cap and gives him a kiss on the forehead.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: How're you feeling?
speaker_heading: LENNY
dialog: Not bad.
text: She tosses the cap on the bed and begins unclipping his
text: suspenders. Lenny does not resist.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You don't need these, right, Dad? Not

speaker_heading: NURSE

dialog: 
text: Out of nowhere, the two airline employees produce A FOLDED
text: METAL CONTRAPTION and pull open a series of METAL FLAPS,
text: transforming it into A BOARDING CHAIR. Unlike a wheelchair,
text: it’s narrow enough to fit down the aisle of an airplane.
text: Wendy stands by and watches as they transfer Lenny to the
text: boarding chair. Lenny’s beseeching eyes are fixed on
text: Wendy as he is handled by these human furniture movers.
text: They arrange his arms across his chest, straight-jacket

speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, Dad ~
text: Wendy takes Lenny’s hands and helps him shimmy into the

speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: That's good, Dad.

speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Dad, what?
text: Wendy looks down and lets out a TINY GASP.
text: A WIDE SHOT reveals that Lenny’s pants have collapsed
text: around his ankles -- he’s standing in the middle of the

speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Dad, open your mouth.

speaker_heading: JON
dialog: You're wasting our time on fantasies.

speaker_heading: WENDY

speaker_heading: JON
dialog: This thing isn’t about Dad, it’s about

speaker_heading: JON
dialog: Of course you do. You're the consumer that

scene_heading: INT. VAN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 131

speaker_heading: oIMMy
dialog: This place is crazy, right?

speaker_heading: oIMMy
dialog: She dead? That's why she never comes

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: No, just kind of obsolete in the parent

dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You actually want to read one of my plays?
speaker_heading: oIMMY

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: In my world nobody really wants to read

speaker_heading: WENDY
speaker_heading: omMMy

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: No way, really? You didn’t think it was

speaker_heading: omMMy
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I was scared that you’d think that I was

dialog: Not at all.
speaker_heading: omMMy
dialog: I thought it was sad.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: But you're from Haiti.

speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: That's probably a really hard place to be
dialog: from.
speaker_heading: omMMy
dialog: Yeah, but my parents didn’t scream at

speaker_heading: WENDY
text: Pathologically narcissistic.
speaker_heading: oIMMY

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: It wasn't.

speaker_heading: WENDY

speaker_heading: oIMMy
dialog: It's good to cry.

text: She picks them up and puts them on. They are over-sized
text: and odd looking on her, and her eyes are hugely
text: magnified. She goes to the mirror over the dresser and
text: looks at herself.

text: She takes them and brings them to her nose to smell them.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: They don’t have a scent. They're from
dialog: the deli. I never understand why that is

speaker_heading: WENDY

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: It's not the same. She stopped eating.
dialog: There's a surgery, but the vet says
dialog: there's no guarantees. And the
dialog: rehabilitation is brutal. She's old,
text: Wen. She’s in pain.
text: Larry breaks down crying. Wendy tries to comfort him. They

speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry about your Dad.
speaker_heading: WENDY
