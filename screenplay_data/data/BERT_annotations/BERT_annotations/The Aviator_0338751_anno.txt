text: We see Howard from behind. He is siumped in a chair, long legs

dialog: Getting the feel for the stick. Feels good.

dialog: I'm a urologist.
speaker_heading: MRS, HEPBURN .

speaker_heading: LUDLOW

speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LUDLOW

speaker_heading: MRS. HEPBURN
dialog: We don't care about money here, Mr. Hughes.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (terse)
dialog: That's because you have it.
text: A beat. An actual moment of silence.
speaker_heading: MRS. HEPBURN
dialog: Would you repeat that?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: You don't care about money because you have it. And
dialog: you've always had it. My father was dirt poor when I was
dialog: born--
speaker_heading: LUDLOW
dialog: Back in torrid Houston would this be?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Excuse me! -- (back to Mrs. Hepburn) -- I care about
dialog: money, because I know what it takes out of a man to make
dialog: it. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some "airplane guff"
dialog: to take care of.

speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Good afternoon, gentlemen. Sorry I'm late.
speaker_heading: CHAIRMAN
dialog: Will the secretary record that Mr. Hughes has arrived

speaker_heading: BREEN :
dialog: Mr. Hughes, members of the committee ... I have reviewed
text: Mr. Hughes' photoplay entitled THE OUTLAW and can state
dialog: categorically that I have never seen anything quite so
text: unacceptable as the shots of the mammaries of the
text: character named "Rio." Throughout almost half the
text: picture the girl's mammaries, which are quite large and
dialog: prominent, are shockingly uncovered. For this reason I
dialog: have concluded that the picture appeals only to prurient
dialog: interest and should be denied the Motion Picture

text: He sits.
speaker_heading: CHAIRMAN
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Breen ... Mr. Hughes you may address the

speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (stands)
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Breen ... Now the situation

speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: May I introduce Dr. Ludlow Branson from Columbia

dialog: Branson will now demonstrate that, in fact, Miss

dialog: these other fine ladies.
text: He hands the stunned Professor Fitz a pair of calipers from his

speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: You forgot your calipers, Doctor.

text: He goes into the men's room...
text: The bathroom is empty. Howard moves to a sink, taking his little
text: bar of lye soap from his pocket.
text: “He begins washing his hands. Scrubbing his hands.
text: He looks into the mirror as he scours his hands. His hands move
text: more quickly now. A certain urgency to the washing. And then
text: almost violence. He does not look down.
text: His hands are raw now. His face almost passive as he looks at
text: himself in the mirror.
text: One of his hands is bleeding now. The lye stings him. He stops,
text: looks down.
text: A little bit of blood. He stares at it. Surprised.
text: He quickly rinses off his hands and puts the soap back in his
text: pocket. Dries his hands with a towel, dabbihg away the tiny bit
dialog: of blood.
text: Then he goes to leave the bathroom. Reaches for the door--
text: Stops.
text: He stares at the doorknob.
text: HOWARD'S POV -- EXTREME CLOSEUP -- the glistening gold doorknob.
text: His hands are clean now. He can't touch the doorknob. What to

speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Hello.
text: No one else is in the bathroom.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He looks at the doorknob again. Frustrated.

dialog: door.
scene_heading: INT. COCOANUT GROVE NIGHT

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Pan Am owns Europe. But he's smart, we ought to think

speaker_heading: HOWARD

speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
text: He owns Pan Am. He owns Congress. He owns the Civil

speaker_heading: HOWARD

dialog: Corps delegation. Are they impressed? Will they pay?
text: The Emcee leans into the microphone:
speaker_heading: EMCEE
dialog: Imagine, if you dare, this beautiful lady towering over
dialog: your head. And inside? 700 brave American soldiers! A

text: into the Grand Canyon. Thé hanger is 800 feet long.
text: Hundreds of workers labor in every corner of the massive hanger.
text: Most of them swarming over...
text: The skeletal frame of the Hercules' fuselage. The combination of
text: wood and plastic molding soars up, disappearing into the
text: darkness of the top of the cathedral.
text: Howard is particularly intense -- in overdrive -- his mind
text: racing, battling to keep up with the many, many pressures of his
text: life. He flips through renderings for a new TWA logo as he

dialog: them.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Senator Brewster is saying that domestic competition
dialog: will kill expansion into the global market -- because

scene_heading: HOWARD'S POV -- EXTREME CLOSEUP -- the dust tornadoes swirling

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Name's Josh or something like that.
speaker_heading: HOWARD

speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: I don't know.

speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Fire him. And make sure they use damp brooms from now
dialog: on. Respiratory diseases are expensive and I don't want
dialog: a bunch of damn lawsuits...
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Okay. But can we at least proceed with the instrument
dialog: panel we discussed? The tool shop is ready to go~-
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: No, I wanna see the blueprints again--
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: (cracking a bit)
dialog: You've seen all this stuff a hundred times -- it's just
dialog: like the goddamn wheel -- you can't keep changing your
dialog: mind -- we're eight goddamn months behind schedule as it
dialog: is--!
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: It's all gotta be right -- it's got to feel right.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Look, you gotta face it, the deadline is now totally
dialog: unrealistic. At this rate the war will be over by the

speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (calming)
dialog: Odie, take it easy ... I understand you're under a lot
dialog: of pressure, but it's gonna do me no good if you crack
dialog: up on me. Take a couple hours off...

speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: --. Relax a little bit, take some time off. See your

text: prepares himself. He slowly removes his hands.
text: Silence. He opens his eyes. Prepares himself again, and dares to

speaker_heading: HOWARD
scene_heading: Quarantine. Q-U-A-R-A-N-T-I-N-E. Quarantine.

dialog: Sleek Art Deco hood ornament.
dialog: Howard once called her "the most beautiful plane ever built." He
dialog: was not wrong.
text: Title: July 7, 1946. Inaugural flight of the XF-11.
scene_heading: NT. /EXT F-11 DAY
text: Howard, wearing his lucky fedora, is settling into the cockpit.
text: Built for military reconnaissance, the cockpit is incredibly
text: complicated; a womb of gauges and dials and switches and levers
text: and weapons controls and camera relays.
text: Howard gazes at the chaos of controls as he fastens his safety
text: harness across his chest.
text: Meanwhile, Glenn is at the Command Post at the side of the
text: runway. An army of technicians and engineers await. Professor
text: Fitz as well, monitoring a weather radar console. Glenn settles

text: A delegation of Air Force officers are there as well, checking

text: Inside the XF-11, Howard activates his radio:
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Odie, you reading me okay?
speaker_heading: GLENN (V.O. ON RADIO)
dialog: Yeah, Howard, you're a-okay.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Starting ignition sequence.
text: He throws a series of toggles and presses ignition. The engines
text: begin to hum. The propellers begin to spin. He watches them
text: through the plexiglass bubble dome of the cockpit.
text: He takes the wheel gently, manipulates the plane's controls,
text: efficiently preparing the plane.
speaker_heading: GLENN (V.O. ON RADIO)
dialog: Okay, Howard, confirm visual action. She's all yours.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Howard gently caresses the foot pedals, hand levers and wheel.
text: Outside, the mighty XF-11 begins to roll.
text: Inside, smooth as silk. Stasis and calm as the world slowly
text: rolls by outside.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: She's goddamn spotless, Odie! No wiggle on the wheel or
text: throttles.
speaker_heading: GLENN (V.O. ON RADIO)
dialog: Take it easy, Howard...
speaker_heading: HOWARD
text: Preparing for starboard turn 1-8-0.

dialog: How does she sound, Howard?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: She's whispering to me,. buddy.
speaker_heading: GLENN (V.O. ON RADIO)
dialog: All right. Make her sing.
text: Howard smiles and sets the plane in motion. She begins to zoom
text: down the runway, gaining momentum.
text: She ROARS past Glenn and the others at the Command Post.
text: The XF-11 gracefully soars into the sky.
text: Inside, silk.
text: Howard laughs. Giddy.

speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: No ... goddamn ... way.
text: He pulls back on the wheel and the XF-11 streaks through the
dialog: sky.
text: And is lost in the clouds.
text: An eternal moment as Howard soars. His dream. The world behind
text: him, the heavens before him. Airborne. Clean. Free.
text: The glorious XF-11 responds to his every tiny cue, melting to

text: Still burning, he tries to pull himself up from the nose of the

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

dialog: flowers.
scene_heading: EXT. LOS ANGELES AIRPORT DAY
dialog: The magnificent Constellations are everything we have waited
text: for. Sleek and aerodynamic and enormous.
dialog: And grounded.
text: Howard slowly limps with Noah and Jack Frye past a fleet of the
text: idle planes. Bold red-and-white TWA colors on the Connies.
text: Howard is a skeleton. He has lost 35 pounds off his already lean
text: frame. He is weak, walking with a cane, trying to focus.
text: It is soon apparent that his face will never be what it was.
text: Plastic surgery has helped, but he has lost much of the natural
text: elasticity on the left side of his face. His amazingly pure
text: beauty is just gone, although a darker, more saturnine intensity
text: gives his face a very commanding aspect.
text: He now sports a mustache to cover a scar above his lip.

speaker_heading: JACK
text: Until they finish their investigation of the Reading

speaker_heading: NOAH (CONT'D)
dialog: ++. it all comes down to this: you gotta choose. Do you
dialog: want to be bankrupt by the big plane or by the big

text: A long beat as he looks at the Constellations. Then:
speaker_heading: HOWARD

dialog: Howard ... ? Howard ... ?
text: Senator Brewster is standing, looking over a table set for an
text: elegant lunch for two in his palatial Washington apartment.
dialog: Title: February 12, 1947. Mayflower Hotel, Washington DC.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Puts a thumb print on it. Clearly visible as he holds it to the

text: A buzz from the front door.
text: Brewster walks through the apartment, meets Howard being
text: escorted in by a MAID. Howard wears his dark suit. White shirt.
dialog: No tie. White sneakers.
text: Howard is making a superhuman effort to appear "normal."
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: Howard, hello.
text: He strides up, offering his hand. Howard forces himself te take
text: Brewster's hand and shake firmly.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Owen, nice to see you again.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: (to maid)
dialog: Emma, you can set up lunch now ... (he ushers Howard
dialog: into the living room) ... Come on in.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
text: Really lovely room ... (checks the panoramic view from
dialog: the window) ... View, too. That's nice.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: Sit down... (Howard sits on a sofa) ... Thanks for
dialog: coming by. Just thought you and I should have a chance
text: to talk privately. Away from the office.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I appreciate that, Owen.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: So ... you're coming out pretty strong against the C.A.B
dialog: bill.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: You're coming on pretty strong for it.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: It's my bill, Howard, I sincerely believe America cannot
dialog: afford more than one international carrier.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: You think it's fair for one airline to have a monopoly
dialog: on international travel?
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: I think one airline can do it better without
dialog: competition. All I'm thinking about is the needs of the
dialog: American passenger.
text: Howard's eye is drawn to a painting on a wall. A llama in a.
dialog: Peruvian setting.
speaker_heading: . HOWARD
dialog: Now that's just beautiful. What is that, a yak? Some
dialog: kinda yak?
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: A llama. The wife picked it up when we were in Peru last
dialog: year.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: A llama, sonofagun, a real llama. In Peru?
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: Yeah, last year.
text: Brewster doesn't like way the conversation is getting off-point.
text: Thankfully, the maid enters:
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Lunch is served, Senator.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: (standing)
dialog: Come on, let's have some lunch.
text: He leads Howard into the dining room as:
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Did you actually see any llamas?
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: No. My wife just liked the painting.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Hell of an interesting animal. Gotta read up on those.
dialog: How do you spell it? Like Fernando Lamas?
text: Brewster ushers him into the dining room. Points him to a chair:
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: No, no, the animal. It has two 1's. Sit down, please...
text: Their lunch plates are covered with metal domes. The maid pulls
text: them away. Brewster watches for Howard's reaction. “
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The plates are filled with Brook Trout and heaps of asparagus
text: and Brussel sprouts. The trout is served with the head on. A
text: glassy eye stares up at Howard.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER (CONT'D)
dialog: It's Brook Trout. Hope you like fish.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Love it, thanks.
text: Brewster is disappointed. Howard forces himself to dig in. The
text: maid pours water into their glasses. Howard has the glass
text: Brewster smudged with his thumb print before.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: I know you're not a drinking man, so I hope water is
dialog: fine.
text: Howard sees the thumb print. Takes the glass and drinks.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Thanks.
text: Brewster is disappointed that his childish game of psychological
text: warfare is failing so miserably.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: All right, let's talk turkey ... My investigators have
dialog: turned up a lot of dirt. It could be really embarrassing
dialog: if this stuff got out. I'd like to save you that
dialog: embarrassment.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: That's very kind of you, Owen.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: My Committee has the power to hold public hearings. I'd
dialog: like to spare you that.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Would you now?
text: Howard's sang froid is rather angering Brewster. A beat.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: You wanna go down in history was a war profiteer,
dialog: Howard?
text: Howard stops eating. Looks at him.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: CONTINUED :
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: Agree to support my C.A.B. bill and Z won't hold public
dialog: hearings.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I can't do that, Owen. The C.A.B. would kill TWA.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: Sell TWA to Pan Am. You'll get a fair price.
text: At last. The deal.
text: Howard resumes eating, not looking at Brewster.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: And then you won't go public?
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: That's right. The investigation is closed and no one
dialog: knows a thing. Better for everyone.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: You know I'm still wondering one thing...
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: That picture of the llama you got last year. Where'd you
dialog: sail from?
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: We didn't. We flew.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Oh.
text: Brewster stares at him. Howard returns the stare evenly. Then,
text: his voice low and cold:
speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: You sure you wanna do this, Owen? You wanna go to war
dialog: with me?
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: It's not me, Howard -- it's the United States
dialog: government.
text: Howard stands.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Listen, tell Juan Trippe something for me ... Thank you
dialog: for the flowers. And he can kiss my ass.
text: He goes. Brewster glowers.
scene_heading: INT MAYFLOWER HOTEL -—- CORRIDOR DAY
text: Howard moves down the corridor, away from Brewster's apartment.
text: He rounds a corner, where he has left his cane, and almost
text: instantly deflates. He leans against a wall, shaking
text: dangerously, panting for breath. The effort of appearing
text: "normal" for Brewster has totally exhausted him.
text: He can't control the tremors in his body. He finally implodes --
text: sinking down the wall.
text: Then we hear Howard's voice, whispering:
speaker_heading: HOWARD (V.O.)
dialog: Someone tell me where I sleep...
dialog: Taking us to...
scene_heading: INT. 7000 ROMAINE -- SCREENING ROOM DAY
text: Stark desert landscapes. Clouds. Black and white.

speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: I need to Sleep .... No. No. No. ..I should drink
dialog: something first.
text: He. stands looking at a neat collection of milk bottles across
text: the room. He mimes the action with his hands slowly as he
text: describes it. He is unaware his hands are moving.
speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll walk over there and pick up a bottle of milk with
dialog: my ... right hand ... and I'll take off the top with my
dialog: .-. left hand ... with two fingers ... of my left hand
dialog: .. I'll take off the top and put it in my pocket ... my

speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: How long has it been here? It might be bad ... (he

dialog: gestures he used a moment before) ... So if the miik is
dialog: bad I shouldn't walk over there ... and pick up the
dialog: bottle of milk with my ... right hand ...and take off
dialog: the top with my ... left hand...
text: His mental loop is broken when the red light above the screening
text: room door begins to flash. Someone is outside.
text: He goes to the door. He talks through the door, waging a
text: terrible battle to sound sane.
speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Who is it?
dialog: Split-screen to:
text: Kate Hepburn, outside the screening room.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Howard, it's Kate. I need to see you.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Howard, do you hear me? I'm coming in.
text: She tries to open the door. It is locked.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Unlock this door immediately.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Did you say something?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (tormented)
dialog: I can't.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You mean you won't.
text: Howard is dissolving, wanting more than anything in life to see

text: She is deeply concerned. Leans against the door.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: HOWARD

speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I can hear you ... I could always hear you. Even in the
dialog: cockpit, with the engines...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That's because I'm so goddamn loud.
text: He smiles. Tears coming to his eyes. He leans his whole body
text: against the door, wanting to be closer.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Howard, I came to thank you ... I found out what you did
dialog: for Spence and me. Buying those awful pictures.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: You love him.
speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: HOWARD

speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Go away now. Would you do that?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (tears)
dialog: Howard...
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Go away, just for now, I'll see you soon. We'll go
dialog: flying.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Please take me flying again ... I can take the wheel ...
dialog: Howard? ... Are you there?
text: A long beat and then she turns and walks down the long corridor,
text: devastated. He hears her footsteps echoing away...
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: On her half of the split-screen we see her walking away as...
text: Howard sinks to the floor. He holds his knees and rocks like a
text: feral child. Inarticulate moans coming from deep within him...
text: She disappears around a corner, the hallway is empty. Howard is
dialog: alone.
dialog: End Split-screen.
text: And Howard's journey into hell begins.
text: He never leaves the screening room. For months.
scene_heading: INT._______SCREENING ROOM SEQUENCE __ DAY/NIGHT
text: A line of ants creeps across a plate of cookies.
text: We see don't see Howard. We see his hands.
text: He carefully removes a Kleenex from-a box. And then another. And.
text: then. another. And then a handful. He methodically wraps his hand
text: in a wad of Kleenex and then uses the Kleenex to press the
text: RECORD button on a tape recorder.
text: We watch the tape in the machine begin to spin.
text: Then we explore Howard's strange realm -- slowly coming to
text: realize the depths of his descent -~- as we hear an aural mosaic
text: of various memos, ebbing and flowing:
speaker_heading: HOWARD (V.O.)
dialog: Memo to All Staff ... There has been some confusion on
dialog: the topic of my lunch. I will clarify. The employee
dialog: delivering my lunch is to use no less than four Kleenex
text: brand tissues to carry the bag into the screening room.
text: He is to open the bag with his right hand and then hold
dialog: the bag out to me at a forty five degree angle so I may
text: reach into the .bag without touching the paper. .
text: Another memo is heard as the first continues...
speaker_heading: HOWARD (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: ...it doesn't take a genius to read a blueprint. Note
text: the hydraulics for the right aileron shown on print
text: number 2,187-B, it is out of alignment by almost an
text: eighth of an inch. This lack of attention to detail is
dialog: unacceptable...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: We see engine parts scattered about like corpses after a battle.
text: We see brown paper bags and newspapers are stacked messily all
text: around. We see grainy surveillance photos of Ava out on dates
dialog: with other men...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Another memo is heard as the others continue...
speaker_heading: HOWARD (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: ++. You must understand this is the most important thing
dialog: in my life. When the milk bottles are delivered to the
text: screening room, the employee with the bottles must wear
text: a white shirt and no jacket. His cuffs must be
text: completely buttoned and he must not wear a watch or
dialog: jewelry or cologne of any kind. He must use no less than
text: fifty Kleenex brand tissues to form a paddle. He will
text: then use this Kleenex paddle to press the door light
dialog: button...
text: We: see mountains of discarded Kleenex. And boxes of Kleenex
text: stacked in strange, geometric patterns. We see hundreds and
text: hundreds of starlet headshots, haphazardly piled in chairs...
text: Another memo is heard as. the others continue...
speaker_heading: HOWARD’ (V.O.) © (CONT'D)
dialog: -.-- I would like to remind the TWA board of directors
dialog: that I own 78 percent of the airline, and the Finance
dialog: Committee's recommendation to raise 20 million dollars
dialog: in capitalization through the sale of common stock is
dialog: contrary to my intentions at this time...
text: We see reels of movie film, some unspooled, the film stretching
text: around the room like celluloid tendons. We see his clothes,
dialog: discarded.
text: The "milk bottle" memo is heard again as the others continue...
speaker_heading: HOWARD (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: ... The employee with the milk bottles must press the
dialog: button seven times exactly. When he has heard me repeat
dialog: the words "Come in with the milk" ten times, with no
dialog: variation, "Come in with the milk", ten times, he must
text: then use his left hand to open the door and enter. He
dialog: must not to look at me. He is to set the milk bottles
text: down directly inside the door to the right, three feet
text: away from the door. He is to use his left hand only...
text: We return to the ants, slowly creeping across the plate of
text: cookies. Tenacious. Omnivorous. Unstoppable.
text: As all the memos, and hundreds more, now join together for
dialog: versions of the final, all-important instruction:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HOWARD (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: -.. If there is any variation of these instructions,
dialog: even to the smallest degree, the entire process must be
dialog: repeated from the beginning ... repeated from the
dialog: beginning ... repeated from the beginning..
dialog: And we finally see Howard.
text: He stands, naked.
text: He stands in front of the screen. Silent images from HELL'S
text: ANGELS are being projected. A dogfight scene. The planes twist
text: and-soar over his naked body.
text: The only sane order in this hellish place seems to be a neat row
text: of empty milk bottles against one wall. :
text: Howard slowly backs away from the screen. His whole psyche
text: concentrating on a series of sounds ... syllables ... letters
text: ... fighting to find order in chaos. It is painfully emotional.
dialog: Every correct letter is a huge victory, every incorrect letter
dialog: is a crushing defeat. :
speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Q...U...A...R...
text: He slowly walks to the pristine row of empty milk bottles.
speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Q...U... A...
text: He picks one up. Pees in it.
speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
scene_heading: -R...A--E--A...N...
text: He finishes peeing. Carefully carries the bottle across the room
text: to the opposite wall.
speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
scene_heading: Q...U... E...R..-
text: He sets the milk bottle down. We realize there is an endless
text: line of the milk bottles on this side of the room. All filled
dialog: with urine. Precisely ordered.
text: He looks at them. Trying not to weep. Concentrating intensely.
speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
scene_heading: -A...R...N...7... Bee. Ewe. De. Nee.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Then a red light reflects off the milk bottles. The door light.

speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello ... ?
dialog: Split-screen to:
text: A rather mystified Juan Trippe outside the screening room door.
text: A chair has been placed in the hallway. Noah waits down the
dialog: hall.
speaker_heading: TRIPPE
dialog: Howard, it's Juan.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Oh, Juan, right, right. We had an appointment, I
dialog: remember that -- Listen I got a hell of a cold here.
dialog: Why don't you sit down out there?
dialog: Don't wanna get you sick. Never forgive myself if I got
dialog: you sick. You don't wanna get sick--
text: Howard clamps a hand over his mouth, fighting with himself.
text: Outside, Trippe sits.
speaker_heading: TRIPPE
dialog: Okay, Howard, I'm sitting ... (he begins pulling
dialog: documents from his briefcase) ... Now, I've brought all
text: our accountings. Pan Am is trading at 13.66 a share. TWA
dialog: is trading at 4.24. If we--
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Come on, come on, come on, come on -- we both know I'm
dialog: not going to sell TWA. You couldn't afford her anyway.
dialog: Our domestic routes alone are worth more than twice Pan
dialog: Am.
speaker_heading: TRIPPE
dialog: Considering our stock is valued at three times yours, I
dialog: find that a dubious claim, Howard.
text: Howard forces himself to concentrate, eyes shut.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I mean you have no domestic routes. You get TWA and you
dialog: span the globe -- I'm not gonna sell, and you know I'm
dialog: not going to sell -- Here's the point: Owen Brewster
dialog: works for you.
text: Outside, Trippe prepares his pipe.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: SONTINUED:
speaker_heading: TRIPPE
dialog: I didn't elect Senator Brewster. We can thank the vote
dialog: of Maine for that.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: If I appear at his hearings, it might get nasty for a}
dialog: of us.
speaker_heading: TRIPPE
dialog: I think considerably more for you. While the good peo;
dialog: of America lost sons at Anzio, you produced a dirty
dialog: movie and built airplanes that don't fly.
text: nutside, Trippe lights his pipe.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Now that's just not fair. The XF-11 flew quite well f
dialog: an hour and forty five minutes. I wish you’d been up
dialog: there with me. It was very exciting.
text: oward smiles gleefully. Take that, you sonofabitch. Then he
text: otices a wisp of smoke from Trippe's pipe coming under the

speaker_heading: TRIPPE
dialog: Be that as it may, you still have to answer for the

speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (calling from across the
dialog: room)

speaker_heading: TRIPPE

speaker_heading: HOWARD

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: TRIPPE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm going to get it anyway. You're going to default on
dialog: your loan from Equitable when Senator Brewster destroys
dialog: your reputation and you can't raise additional capital
dialog: for the airline. The hearings will also show Hughes
dialog: Aircraft to be mismanaged and incompetent. It will go
dialog: bankrupt. But you won't be insolvent. You'll still have
dialog: Toolco ... Perhaps you'll go back to Houston and rebuild
dialog: your empire. I rather hope you do. By that time Pan Am
dialog: will have bought TWA and painted all those magnificent
dialog: Connies blue and white. So, when you do return, it will
text: be on a Pan Am plane.
text: Howard stands right at the door.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: You seem to have me in a corner, buddy. Not a position
dialog: in which I'm very comfortable.
speaker_heading: TRIPPE
dialog: I think you'll be less comfortable at Senator Brewster's
dialog: hearings. Very public, Howard. Lots of cameras and
dialog: newsmen. I understand you're not particularly
text: comfortable in crowds.
text: Trippe's droll understatement makes Howard smile.
speaker_heading: TRIPPE (CONT'D)
dialog: Perhaps we should spare you that.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Thanks for your concern. I find that very moving ...
dialog: It's been a real pleasure, Juan. Noah will take you back
dialog: to the airport. Fly safe.
text: Outside, Trippe stands.
speaker_heading: TRIPPE
dialog: Thank you, Howard. Take care of that cold.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I certainly will. Bye bye.
text: He thrusts his ear to the door, listening. Making sure Trippe is
text: gone. He hears Trippe and Noah moving away.
text: End split-screen.
text: Howard leans against the door, panting. The exertion of talking
dialog: with Trippe has absolutely éxhausted him.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

scene_heading: iT. 7000 ROMAINE -- CORRIDOR NIGHT
text: The door to the screening room opens slightly. Howard peeks out.
text: A few employees move about in the corridor.
text: He carefully steps from the screening room, standing in the

speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: I don't have any shoes. Can you get me some shoes?
scene_heading: NT. MUIRFIELD. NIGHT
text: Howard sits on the floor in his den, wearing only an old
text: bathrobe. He is unshaven, his eyes red with exhaustion and spent
dialog: tears.
text: He aimlessly sorts through a mountain of legal documents, trying
text: to prepare himself for his upcoming appearance in Washington.
text: The doorbell rings. He pulls himself up and slowly moves through
text: the silent house. He is fragile, moving unsteadily. He is a man
text: made of straw, as if a wisp if air could blow him way.
text: He looks through the peephole and then pulls a wad of Kleenex
text: from a waiting box. He uses the Kleenex to open the front door.
text: It is Ava. She looks at him, stunned. Recovers quickly.
speaker_heading: AVA :
dialog: How nice of you to dress for me ... Can I come in?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: You can come in.

text: He looks at her wrap. Doesn't move.
speaker_heading: AVA (CONT'D)

dialog: No, wait, wait, wait -- you can't move -- you're safe
dialog: here. You're in the germ free zone now, you understand?
text: Ava glances down, notes this area of the entry hall is marked
text: off by a square of black electrical tape on the floor.
speaker_heading: AVA
dialog: T'll take my chances.
text: She steps over the tape and moves into the house.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: No, no, honey, please...
text: Howard follows nervously as she strides through the airless,
text: darkened house to the living room. She notes all the windows are
text: taped shut with black electrical tape.
text: Even more, she cannot help noticing the mountains of Kleenex
text: discarded everywhere on the floor.
speaker_heading: AVA
dialog: Love what you've done with the place ... (she pours
dialog: herself a drink) ... Kleenex carpet's a cute idea. Now
dialog: let me look at you.
text: She switches on a table lamp. He stands before her. Holding his
text: robe closed tightly.
speaker_heading: AVA (CONT'D)
dialog: Drop the robe.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He removes the robe. He stands naked. She gazes over hin.
speaker_heading: AVA (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, you need to eat for one ... and a shower might be
text: in order ... (her eyes play over him a bit more,
dialog: mischievous) ... Well, I always said they don't call it
dialog: Hughes Tool for nothing.
text: He actually smiles.
speaker_heading: AVA (CONT'D)
dialog: There's my boy. Get the robe, come on...
text: He picks up the robe. Looks at it. He seems to have forgotten
dialog: how to put it on.
text: Ava goes to him and gently helps him--
speaker_heading: AVA (CONT'D)
dialog: Put your arm through the hole -- right, good, all the
dialog: way through -- okay, now the other...
text: She helps him put the robe on and then takes his hand and leads
text: him toward the stairs...
scene_heading: INT. UTRFIELD -— T) THROOM. NIGHT
text: He stands. She shaves him.
speaker_heading: AVA
dialog: When do you go to Washington?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: A week. No, just under a week. I don’t know the date
dialog: today. But I have to be ... I have to be...
speaker_heading: AVA
dialog: All right, take it easy.
text: A silent beat as she shaves him. His eyes are drawn to the sink,
text: the running water, the soap.
scene_heading: HOWARD'S POV ~- EXTREME CLOSEUP -- the gleaming white porcelain
text: sink, the tap water rinsing off the shining razor, the tiny
text: beard hairs swirling down the drain--
speaker_heading: AVA (CONT'D)
dialog: There's nothing there, Howard.
text: A silent pause as she shaves him.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I see things.
speaker_heading: AVA
dialog: I know, baby. Rinse your face off now.
text: She steps aside. He faces the sink. Slowly reaches forward.
text: Stops.
speaker_heading: AVA (CONT'D)
dialog: Put your hands in the water and wash off the soap. I'm
dialog: right here. I'm not going anywhere.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Does it look clean to you?
speaker_heading: AVA
dialog: Nothing's clean, Howard. But we do our best, right?
text: He slowly reaches forward and puts his hands into the running
text: water. He carefully washes the soap off his face. A triumph. He
text: looks at her.
speaker_heading: AVA (CONT'D)
dialog: Great. Now I want you in the shower.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Don't go anywhere.
speaker_heading: AVA
dialog: Hell, I'd soap you up myself but I know how frisky you
dialog: get.
text: He smiles and steps toward the shower.
scene_heading: EXT. MUIRFIELD -- MASTER SUITE DAY
text: Howard stands unsteadily before a mirror, as presentable as Ava
text: can make him. Clean, hair slicked down, nails cut, new suit.
speaker_heading: AVA
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I look all right...
speaker_heading: AVA
dialog: You look great.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Will you marry me?
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: AVA
dialog: You're too crazy for me.
text: She looks at him tenderly in the mirror.
speaker_heading: AVA (CONT'D)
dialog: I gotta go, baby.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Okay ... Thanks.
text: She kisses him gently.
speaker_heading: AVA
dialog: You'd do it for me.
text: He nods. She goes. He stands for a moment, looking at himself in
text: the mirror. Cosmetically at least, he has improved. But his eyes
text: still reflect the chaos inside him.
scene_heading: INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM DAY
text: Barely controlled hysteria.
text: The Senate Caucus Room is jammed. 1,500 spectators and reporters
text: are packed into a chamber built to handle 600. Hundreds more
text: crowd the hallway outside.
text: Title: August 6, 1947. Brewster Senate Hearings. Day One.
text: The witness table holds a cluster of microphones from seven
text: radio stations. Six newsreel cameras purr alongside an amazing
dialog: new invention: a television camera. This was the first
dialog: congressional hearing in history to be televised live.
text: Across from the witness table, Owen Brewster sits at a long dais
dialog: with the rest of his committee.
text: Then a sound, growing from outside the chamber, a building
text: rumble of excited voices. Brewster glances up from his notes to
text: see Howard walking into the chamber with Noah. Howard wears a
text: crisp new grey suit.
text: The photographers snap photos, a barrage of flashbulbs, an
text: excited clamor from the ‘spectators.
text: Howard ignores the press and spectators and goes to the witness
text: table. Sits. Noah sits next to him, begins unloading two heavy
text: briefcases full of documents.
text: Then blinding lights suddenly snap on, focused on Howard. They
text: are the lights to assist the new TV camera.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The lights are so powerful that many of the reporters put on
text: sunglasses. It is a surreal image as the reporters don the
text: sunglasses and the cold eye of the TV camera gazes at Howard.
text: Howard looks almost robotic, flattened, unfocused.
text: Brewster knows he is going to slaughter him. He bangs a gavel
dialog: for order.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: The committee will come to order. Mr. Hughes, will you
dialog: raise your right hand and be sworn?
text: Howard stands, raises his right hand. Another barrage of
text: flashbulbs. Howard's pupil's dilate and undilate furiously in
text: the strobe-like flashes.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you solemnly swear that in the matter now pending
dialog: before this committee, you will tell the trzth, the
dialog: whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I do-
text: He sits.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: Mr. Hughes, it is the intention of this committee--
speaker_heading: NOAH
text: Mr. Hughes has a statement.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: Very well. Mr. Hughes, you may proceed.
text: Noah holds out a piece of paper to Howard. Howard glances at it.
text: Glances away. He says nothing.
text: An awkward beat.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Hughes? You may proceed...
text: Noah is getting nervous. He offers the statement to Howard
text: again. Howard won't take it. Then Howard looks off to the press,
text: who stare back at him. At the cruel eye of the TV camera. Then
text: Howard looks back to Brewster.
text: And his eyes begin to flicker with something we've seen before.
text: Howard ignores the prepared statement.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: You know, I'm gonna attempt to be, um, honest here...
text: A beat. Noah is terrified of what Howard is going to say. Howard
text: focuses, glaring at Brewster.
speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Senator Brewster, if you hadn't gone too far overboard,
dialog: I might have been willing to take a certain shellacking
dialog: in this publicity spree of yours. I might have been
dialog: willing to sit back and take a certain amount of abuse
dialog: simply because I am only a private citizen while you are
dialog: a Senator with all sorts of powers -- But I think this
dialog: goddamn circus has gone on long enough--
text: Brewster bangs his gavel--
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: That's quite sufficient, Mr. Hughes--
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (angry) . .
dialog: You have called me a liar, sir. In the press. You have
dialog: called me a liar and a thief and a war profiteer--
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: (banging gavel)
dialog: The witness will restrain his comments and--
text: Howard stands, a stunningly simple act that silences Brewster
text: and rivets the entire room. He leans forward on the table,
text: speaking with clipped, barely controlled anger:
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Why not tell truth for once, Senator? Why not tell that
dialog: this investigation was really born on the day that TWA
dialog: first decided to fly to Europe? On the day when TWA
text: first invaded Juan Trippe's territory. On the day when
dialog: TWA first challenged the generally accepted theory that
dialog: only Juan Trippe's great Pan American Airways had the
dialog: sacred right to fly the Atlantic!
text: The bombshell explodes. The spectators love seeing Howard, still
text: America's Aviation Hero, defending himself. The photographers
text: flash pictures. Brewster bangs his gavel to no avail.
text: Howard continues to stand.
text: We sweep across the approving spectators and then sweep back to
dialog: the next day...
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Howard is sitting, leaning an elbow on the table, holding an
text: amplifier earpiece to his ear to hear Brewster.
dialog: focused.
dialog: Completely
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: Title: Day Two.
speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: - and on February 12th of this year, in your suite at
dialog: the Mayflower Hotel, did you or did you not tell me that
dialog: if I would sell TWA to Pan Am this investigation would
dialog: be called off?
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: (shrill)
dialog: I did not.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: How long have you known Juan Trippe?
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: I have known Mr. Trippe for several years. But--
text: Noah slides Howard a piece of paper, he doesn't need to look at
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Is it not true, Senator Brewster, that Juan Trippe
dialog: donated 20,000 dollars to your last campaign and--?
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: I have a personal friendship with Mr. Trippe that is --
dialog: um -- divorced from my duties as a Senator.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Is it not true that you accept free tickets from Pan Am
dialog: so you can circle the globe in support of your C.A.B.
dialog: bill?
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: It is not.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Who wrote that bill, Senator?
speaker_heading: . BREWSTER
dialog: I don't understand the purpose of--
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Who actually wrote the C.A.B. bill? The actual words in
dialog: the bill. Did you write them, Senator?
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: Mr. Hughes, this is--
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I have it here, maybe that will refresh your memory ...
text: (Noah hands him a copy of the thick bill) ... Here we
dialog: go. Bill S. 987 to amend the Civil Aeronautics Act. You
dialog: introduced this bill into the Senate. Lotta words. You
dialog: write all of them?
text: Brewster sputters.
speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: You write any of them?
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: Now see here, Mr. Hughes--
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: This entire bill was written by Pan Am executives and
dialog: designed to give that airline a monopoly on
dialog: international travel! And you've been flogging this bill
dialog: on their behalf all around the world, have you not?!
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: My duties take me to--
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: What in hell does a Senator from Maine need to visit
dialog: Peru for?
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: I was -- ah -- seeking outlets for our trade goods.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: They buy a lot of lobsters down there, do they?
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: [--
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: How many times have you been to Mr. Trippe's office in
dialog: New York in the last three months? ... (Brewster stops
dialog: cold) ... Would you like me to tell you, Senator?
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: This has gone on long enough -- Juan Trippe is a great
dialog: American and his airline has advanced the cause of
dialog: commercial aviation in this country for decades! Juan
dialog: Trippe is a patriot! Juan Trippe isn't a man interested
dialog: in making money!
text: Howard lets Brewster's absurd final words echo around the
text: chamber. He leans back, smiles.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Well, I'm sure his stockholders will be happy to hear
dialog: that.
text: Chuckles from the spectators.
text: We sweep over the spectators and sweep back to the next day...
text: Howard is leaning back, holding the amplifier earpiece to. his
text: ear. Noah is exhausted, the days of grueling testimony taking a
text: toll. Howard is completely on top of his game.
text: The chamber is silent, the reporters and spectators straining to
dialog: catch every word. This is really it.
dialog: Title: Day Three.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: Did you receive 43 million dollars to manufacture 100 XF-
dialog: 11 spy planes for the United States Air Force?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER .
dialog: How many functional planes were delivered to the United
dialog: States Air Force?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: None. . “
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: Would you lean a little closer to the microphones, sir?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (leaning in)
dialog: None.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: Did you receive 13 million dollars from the United
dialog: States Air Force to manufacture a protctype flying boat,
dialog: know as The Hercules?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: Did you deliver that plane?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I did not.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: So, by your admission in this chamber you received 56
dialog: million dollars from the United States government for
dialog: planes that you did not deliver.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: That is correct.
text: Brewster thinks he has him. But can't help pushing the dagger in
dialog: a bit.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: Well, excuse me for asking, Mr. Hughes, but where did
dialog: all that money go?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: It went into the planes. And a lot more.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: (leans back, satisfied)
dialog: More? ... Do tell, Mr. Hughes, what other larcenies have
dialog: you committed?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I mean my money, sir.
text: Brewster is immediately alarmed, realizes he has stumbled badly.
text: He has given Howard the opening he has been waiting for.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: Mr. Hughes, your personal finances are not the--
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ANOTHER SENATOR
text: Brewster glances at the other Senators. They stare back at him
text: coldly. Brewster sees the waiting press and spectators.
speaker_heading: BREWSTER
dialog: Proceed, Mr. Hughes.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (very quietly)
dialog: You see the thing is I care very much about aviation.
dialog: It's been the great joy of my life. So I put my own
dialog: money into these planes ... I've lost millions, Mr.
dialog: Chairman. And I'll go on losing millions. It's just what
dialog: I do.
text: The chamber is silent. Hanging on every word.
speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: And if I lost a lot of the government's money during the
dialog: war, I hope folks will put that in perspective ... More
dialog: than 60 other airplanes ordered from such firms as
dialog: Boeing and Lockheed and Douglas and Northrop never saw
dialog: action either. In all, more than 800 million dollars was
dialog: spent during the war on planes that never flew. More
dialog: than 6 billion on other weapons that were never
dialog: delivered.
text: A beat. The coup de grace:
speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: And yet Hughes Aircraft ~- with her 56 million -- is the
dialog: only firm under investigation here today.
text: A tremor through the chamber.
speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't help but think that has a little more to do with
dialog: TWA than with planes that didn't fly.
text: Brewster slumps.
speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: I have only one more thing to say to this committee, and
dialog: that's about the Hercules ... Now, I'm supposed to be
dialog: many things which are not complimentary. I am supposed
dialog: to be capricious. I have been called @ playboy. I have
dialog: even been called an eccentric. But I do not believe I
dialog: have the reputation of being a liar ... I put the sweat
dialog: of my life into this thing. My reputation is wrapped up
dialog: an it.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: CONTINUED: .
speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: So believe me when I say that if the Hercules fails to
dialog: fly, I will leave the country and I will not return. And
dialog: I mean it.
text: Then Howard slowly stands.
speaker_heading: (CONTINITED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, Mr. Chairman ... you can subpoena me, you can
dialog: arrest me, you can claim I've taken a run-out powder
dialog: but I've had enough of this nonsense. Good afternoon.
text: He turns and begins walking out. Noah is stunned. The spectators
text: heartily approve. A smattering of applause.
text: Brewster sinks in his chair. It's over. Howard has won.
text: Howard continues to walk out of the chamber as the crowd
text: applauds.
text: This image is exactly mirrored in...

text: He stares at the globe for a moment, clearly seeing the future.
speaker_heading: TRIPPE (CONT'D)
text: The C.A.B. bill will be defeated in the Senate. TWA will
dialog: begin flights from New York to Paris. And then on to
dialog: Moscow to Japan to Hawaii to Los Angeles to New York.
text: He continues to looks at the globe. The world. His world. Not

text: gazes around at everything.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Come up front, Professor...
text: Professor Fitz walks with Howard and Glenn to the forward

text: Howard settles into the pilot's seat as Professor Fitz nervously

dialog: harbor are very far below.
speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: GLENN

text: obediently.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: How does she sound, Odie?
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Sounds good.
text: Howard glances to Professor Fitz.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Professor, would you do me a favor? Would you look out
dialog: that window there and tell me what the wind's doing?
text: Professor Fitz peers out the window, trying to gauge the wind.
text: His eyes dart from the waves below to a bird flying above,
dialog: anything to give him a sense of speed and direction.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR FITZ
dialog: I would say we have a ... 15 knot wind.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Would you call that a tailwind, Professor?
