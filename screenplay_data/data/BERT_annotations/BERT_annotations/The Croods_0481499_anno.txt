text: A cave painting of the Dreamworks logo. Push past the

dialog: TO:
dialog: 
dialog: Cave paintings of a family of cavemen -- we will come to
dialog: know them as The Croods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EEP (V.O.)
text: With every sun comes a new day. A new
dialog: beginning. A hope that things will be
dialog: better today than they were yesterday.
dialog: 
text: The Croods scurry out of their cave like mice looking for
text: food. Scared. Fast.
dialog: 
text: The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They
text: escape from creatures up trees. They hide behind rocks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EEP (V.O.)
dialog: But not for me. My name's Eep. This, is
dialog: my family, the Croods. If you weren't
text: clued in already by the animal skins and
dialog: sloping foreheads - we're cavemen. Most
dialog: days we spend in our cave, in the dark.
text: Night after night, day after day. Yep.
dialog: Home sweet home. When we did go out, we
dialog: struggled to find food in a harsh and
dialog: hostile world. And I struggled to
dialog: survive my family.
dialog: 
text: The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They
text: escape from creatures up trees. They hide behind rocks.
speaker_heading: EEP (V.O.)
dialog: We were the last ones around. There used
text: to be neighbors. The Gorts, smashed by a
text: mammoth. The Horks, swallowed by a sand
text: snake. The Erfs, mosquito bite. Throgs,
dialog: common cold. And, the Croods. That's
dialog: us. The Croods made it...
dialog: 
text: Grug protects his family from a GIANT BEAR OWL.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EEP (V.O.)
dialog: Because of my Dad. He was strong... and
dialog: he followed the rules.
dialog: 
text: A shadow falls across their feet and Grug ushers his
dialog: family home.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EEP (V.O.)
dialog: ... the ones painted on the cave walls.
dialog: Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad,
dialog: going out at night is bad. Basically,
dialog: anything fun is bad. Welcome to my
dialog: world.
dialog: 
text: They all run back into the cave where Grug slams the rock
text: door closed.
dialog: 
text: SLOWLY LIGHT ON CAVE PAINTINGS COMES UP AGAIN. But this
text: time the light casts an ominous tone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EEP (V.O.)
dialog: But this is a story about how all that
text: changed in an instant.
dialog: 
text: RAPID SHOTS OF THE GREAT SPLIT CUTTING THROUGH THE LAND.
text: HEADED TOWARDS CROOD VALLEY.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SHOTS OF CATACLYSM. CUT FASTER AND FASTER UNTIL...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EEP (V.O.)
dialog: Because what we didn't know, was that our

dialog: there were no rules on our cave walls to
dialog: prepare us for that.
dialog: 
text: CAVEMAN HANDS PRESS against the rock wall. They PUSH. A

speaker_heading: GRUG
scene_heading: Raaaaar grooooOOOOoooowwwll ERF ERF

dialog: 
text: As suddenly as he began, Grug stops. Panting, he waits
text: for the echoes of his outburst to fade.
dialog: 
text: Grug TURNS to the cave entrance, he prepares to BELLOW a
text: signal, but before any sound escapes his lips--
dialog: 
text: A CAVE GIRL, EEP, bursts from the cave.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRUG (CONT'D)
dialog: You're supposed to wait for my signal
dialog: Eep. Eep?
dialog: 
text: Eep scares a pack of nearby Liyotes away. They pounce on
text: Grug briefly before scampering off. Eep spreads out on
text: an overhanging rock. She BASKS IN THE SUN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EEP
dialog: We've been in that cave forever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRUG
dialog: Three days is not forever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EEP
dialog: It is with this family.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRUG
dialog: Eep would you come down here? You're
dialog: being so dramatic.
dialog: 
text: A LITTLE GIRL, SANDY, charges out next. Her display is
text: more terrier-like.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRUG (CONT'D)
dialog: No, no, no Sandy, come back here.
dialog: Remember the signal. Good girls wait for
dialog: the signal.
dialog: 
text: A CAVE WOMAN, UGGA, scrambles out next. She is mostly
text: focused on catching Sandy, giving only cursory effort to
text: her display.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Ugga.
speaker_heading: UGGA
dialog: As soon as I get Sandy, I'll go back in,
dialog: and you can give the signal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRUG
dialog: No, I mean, you're already out now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THUNK (O.S.)
dialog: I am waiting for the signal, dad.
dialog: 
text: We HEAR the voice of Grug's nine-year-old son from inside
text: the cave. THUNK is eager to please his dad and emulates
dialog: his every move.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRUG
dialog: Never mind, Thunk. Just, come out.
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THUNK
dialog: (not so fast)
dialog: Uhh, but if you don't give the signal,
dialog: how do I know you're my dad?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRUG
dialog: The signal isn't so you know it's me,
dialog: it's so you know I wasn't eaten by an
dialog: animal.
dialog: 
dialog: Beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THUNK
dialog: Then why is the signal an animal noise?
dialog: I mean, doesn't that just confuse things?
dialog: 
text: Grug sighs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THUNK (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know... I'm still waiting for the
dialog: signal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRUG
dialog: Sigh. Hoo hooooo! Hoo hooooo!
dialog: 
text: Thunk comes out growling, and barrels into Grug. Thunk
text: picks up a boulder and throws it. It ricochets off the
text: cliff wall and careens into Grug. Grug gets plowed over
text: by the boulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UGGA
dialog: Mom, we're ready to leave.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRUG
dialog: Who's up?
dialog: 
text: Eep's hand SHOOTS up. Thunk is less than enthusiastic.

speaker_heading: GRUG (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: GRUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Ok. Thunk. Go. Come on Thunk.
dialog: 
text: Thunk BREAKS COVER. He dashes into the open, SNATCHES
dialog: the egg.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Hah! Way to go. Take it to the cave!
dialog: 
text: Thunk PASSES Grug and makes a bee-line for Crood Canyon.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Oooh!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Release the baby.
dialog: 
text: Eep and Sandy MOVE IN on the bird. Sandy NIPS at its
text: heels while UGGA CLIMBS up onto its head. She PULLS the
text: egg from its beak.
dialog: 
text: Down range, TRIP GERBILS SURFACE. They STRETCH their
text: shared tail across the Ramu's path like an arresting
text: cable on a carrier.
dialog: 
text: Ugga RISES to THROW the egg to Grug - the gerbils WRAP
text: their tail around the Ramu like a bola. The Ramu GOES
text: DOWN hard. Ugga and the egg ROLL forward. The Trip
text: Gerbils SNATCH up the egg and make off with it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UGGA
dialog: Get um Mom! Do it for the Croods!
dialog: 
text: Gran's cane HOOKS the gerbils in the middle of their tail
text: and WHIPS them up and over her shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON GRAN
dialog: 
text: DRIBBLING the egg down-range with her cane like a hockey
text: player. LIYOTES POP UP from behind hoodoos. They SWARM
text: in behind her.
dialog: 
text: The Liyotes TRIP Gran. They steal the egg, and HIT THE
text: GAS. They are INCREDIBLY FAST.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAN
dialog: Old lady down! Eep, avenge me.
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON EEP
dialog: 
text: Crouched in the shade of a scrubby bush, like a runner on
text: the blocks - she has the Liyotes in her sights. Eep
text: LAUNCHES.
dialog: 
text: Eep runs after the Liyote with the egg, cutting him off
text: in his tracks he slams into a cactus launching the egg
text: into the air. Eep leaps into the air taking back the egg.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EEP
dialog: Thanks!
dialog: 
text: A bunch of Jackrobats see Eep and swarm around her. She
text: loses her footing and throws the egg to Grug.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRUG
dialog: Eep!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EEP
dialog: Heads Up!
dialog: 
text: Grug catches the egg and runs by the entrance of a small
text: cave. Thunk following close behind accidentally trips
text: over the tail of a sleeping Bear Owl knocking Grug to the
text: ground and fumbling the egg once again.
dialog: 
text: Thunk catches the egg just as the Girelephant bears down
text: on him from behind and lifts him onto one of its tusks.
text: The family members meet up as they begin their long run
text: back to the cave.
dialog: 
text: An entire swarm of animals chase the Croods as they head
text: back to their cave.
dialog: 
text: The Bear Owl is awakened and goes after everyone on the
dialog: chase.
dialog: 
text: Grug protecting his family from the BearOwl tosses each
text: family member onto the Girelephant's back.
dialog: 
text: Grug dodges the BearOwl's attack and uses him as a
text: launching pad to get himself safely on the Girelephant.
dialog: 
text: Thunk is happy to see Dad is safe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THUNK
dialog: Oh hey Dad, can we eat now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRUG
dialog: Just wait till we get home. Eep put on
dialog: the brakes.
dialog: 
text: The entrance to Crood canyon appears on the horizon.
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Eep hangs off the edge of one of its tusks as Grug takes
text: over the other. Together they dig their heels into the
text: ground, slowing down the Girelephant.
dialog: 
text: The Bearowl continues the chase. The Croods maneuver the
text: Girelephant to fend off the Bearowl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Eep!
dialog: 
text: The Girelephant moving way too fast readies for the
text: crash. The Girelephant crashes into the entrance of the
text: canyon, sending the Croods flying in. They all tumble.
text: Grug makes an extraordinary football catch. He holds
text: tight to the meal as he slams into a rock. Grug holds up
dialog: the egg.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Who's hungry?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THUNK
dialog: Alright! Good one, dad!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRUG
dialog: Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.
dialog: 
text: Grug tosses the egg to Thunk, Thunk fumbles it and it
text: cracks open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THUNK
dialog: Sorry, dad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UGGA
dialog: Looks like fast food tonight!
dialog: 
text: The family passes the leaky egg around quickly, each
text: Crood gets a taste. Thunk is the last Crood to get a
text: mouthful, he hands it over to Grug-- the egg is empty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRUG
dialog: That's alright. I ate last week.
dialog: 
text: A SHADOW TOUCHES Grug's feet. He looks up - the sun is

speaker_heading: GRUG (CONT'D)
dialog: A long time ago, this little bear was
text: alive. She was alive because she
dialog: listened to her father and lived her life

dialog: terrible problem. She was filled with...

speaker_heading: GRUG
dialog: And no sooner than she climbed to the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: THUNK
dialog: Just like that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRUG

dialog:

dialog: 
text: Eep presses her face against the cold boulder, trying to

dialog: 
text: Desperate to see more, Eep braces her back against the
text: cave and PUSHES the plug rock with her legs. Slowly, she

text: The canyon beyond is quickly swallowing the light - it
dialog: will be gone in another few seconds. With one of her

dialog: 
text: But camouflaged against the rock wall behind her,

text: the creature. She THROWS and FLIPS it over her shoulder.

speaker_heading: GUY (CONT'D)
