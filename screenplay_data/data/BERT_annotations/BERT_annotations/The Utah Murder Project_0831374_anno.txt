scene_heading: INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY
text: In total darkness we hear the almost deafening sounds of a
text: HEART SLOWLY BEATING. The loud sound is up close and in our
text: ears. It continues as we slowly --
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: E.c.U. OF A HAND GRIPPING A .45 CALIBER AUTOMATIC. The heart
text: beating continues as we TILT UP to reveal the face of
text: undercover narcotics detective CHARLIE DESANTIS (30s). He is
text: unkempt with wild long hair, goatee and beard.
text: The gruff and scruffy cop is leaning his back against a car
text: door, hiding. He is nervous and shaking -- panting and
text: sweating like a thirsty animal. Obviously scared for his
dialog: life.
text: In the b.g. we barely make out the sounds of RANDOM GUNSHOTS
text: ECHOING THROUGH THE AIR. With each shot, DeSantis flinches
text: just a bit. These gunshots are faint, though. Dimmed out by
text: the deep, pulsating sound of the detective’s HEART BEAT.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET CURB - EAST LOS ANGELES - DAY (SLOW MOTION
speaker_heading: SEQUENCE )
text: Hiding next to DeSantis is his partner JEFF SPEARS (30s) --
text: scruffy and unkempt. Spears looks to have had a few more
text: years on the force. In his eyes we see that he is also
text: visibly frightened.
text: The two men are undercover and have just closed in ona
text: suspect. It appears that a deal has just gone bad. Very
text: bad. The constant barrage of gunfire SHATTERS THE WINDOWS OF
text: THE PARKED CAR. Shards of glass attack the two men as they
dialog: cover themselves from harm.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: In a slow and steady movement...the detective stands and
text: rests his hands on the roof of the unmarked squad car --
text: aiming his weapon down the street and in the direction of
text: their suspect RAMON VASQUEZ (30s) also hiding safely behind a
text: row of parked cars.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: VASQUEZ
text: instantly returning the cops fire with shots from a large,
text: automatic machine gun. Like an uzi, only more high-tech and
dialog: deadly.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: quickly ducks down, dodging the gunfire and hitting the
text: ground with his partner.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
text: continues to sit in a state of shock, unable to move due to a
text: gunshot wound to the leg. He peeks from the corner of his
text: eye and turns his head slightly --
speaker_heading: HIS P.O.V.
text: He notices a young boy (7) trapped under his bicycle. He is
text: erying and covering his ears -- muffling the deafening
text: gunfire.
text: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
text: wants desperately to help the child but cannot move.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: turns and notices his partner’s catatonia. He abruptly grabs
text: him by the collar and mouths the words “Get the boy!”
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
text: simply cannot move an inch.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: recklessly runs into the line of fire to cover the young
text: child. He instantly catches some stray fire in the back and
text: falls, wounded. As he struggles to get up, he manages to
text: pull the boy from his bicycle -- almost out of harm’s way.
text: Unfortunately, the detective cannot dodge the constant blaze
text: of sporadic gunfire.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
text: watches as his partner is hit with several more shots as he
text: and the boy struggle to take cover behind the vehicle.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: falls to the ground, dying.
speaker_heading: THE BOY
text: lay still on the ground, frozen and unable to move.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
text: desperately reaches out to the boy -- who is crying heavily.
speaker_heading: THE BOY
text: reaches his arm to DeSantis -- who successfully pulls him
text: from the line of fire.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
text: holds the scared child in his arms as BULLETS CONTINUE TO
text: SPRAY THE VEHICLE they’re hiding behind. The detective turns
dialog: and notices --
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: desperately reaching his hand out to him, begging for help.
text: He is blood-soaked, dying. He mouths the words “Help me!”
dialog: Before DeSantis can react we quickly...
dialog: cur TO:
scene_heading: INT. DESANTIS’ HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: DESANTIS jumping up and awaking from the nightmare. He is
text: completely drenched in sweat and cannot catch his breath. He
text: slowly manages to compose himself. The detective is a very
text: different looking man than in his dream. Short hair, no
text: beard. Just some five o’clock shadow.
text: He lays on a beaten, old couch in the middle of his living
text: room. The coffee table before him is completely covered with
text: EMPTY LIQUOR AND BEER BOTTLES. Not five or six, but forty or
text: fifty bottles. The floor surrounding him is also covered
text: with empty bottles and other trash.
text: DeSantis calms himself -- looks down at his pants and notices
text: that he’s urinated. A few moments pass before he stands and
text: continues toward the bathroom to get cleaned up. As he
text: passes through the filthy home, he kicks and muddles his way
text: through the trash and debris.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: DeSantis enters and flicks on the light. Without hesitation
text: he removes his pants and tosses the urine soaked sweat pants
text: into the bathtub -- which is filled with ten or more other
text: pairs of urine stained sweats and boxers. We stay on the
text: bathtub a few moments... taking it all in. This is a sad,
text: deeply haunted and disturbed man.
dialog: cur TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL - DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: A small, dusty motel in the middle of nowhere. A NEON
text: VACANCY SIGN FLICKERS on and off. A total of three cars sit
text: parked in the dusty lot. The night is suspiciously quiet,
text: with only a slight wind in the air.
speaker_heading: SUPERIMPOSE:
speaker_heading: BRYERSON, UTAH
speaker_heading: APRIL 13, 2004
speaker_heading: 11:49 PM
text: The long stretch of road in front of the motel is empty. It
text: seems to stretch into eternity with no sign of a vehicle in
text: sight. Then...suddenly...TWO BRIGHT HEADLIGHTS are seen in
text: the distance. A CAR coming up the road.
text: The LIGHTS become BRIGHTER and BRIGHTER as the car draws
text: nearer. As it becomes visible we see that it’s a Grey DODGE
text: PICK-UP with a DIRT BIKE mounted in the cab. The truck draws
text: nearer to the motel, turns into the barren lot.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL - CONTINUOUS
text: The truck parks in an empty spot. From the truck steps an
dialog: unseen MAN, from the waist down. We’1ll call him “The
text: Cowboy”. Dressed in typical cowboy apparel. Blue jeans,
text: boots. He steps to the rear of the vehicle and pulls a long
text: AREA RUG from the truck’s cab. He begins toward the room.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM
text: The cowboy enters, leaving the door wide open. We see a pair
text: of HANDS in RUBBER GLOVES as he unrolls the rug in front of
text: the bathroom door.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: A PINK BLOUSE and pair of BLUE JEANS lay on the un-made bed.
text: The man grabs the clothing and stuffs it into a large garbage
dialog: bag.
text: A PICTURE appears to be missing on the motel room wall.
text: There is a hook where a picture used to hang. We TILT DOWN
text: to reveal several shards of BROKEN GLASS AND A SHATTERED
text: PICTURE AND FRAME on the carpet.
text: Suddenly...A HAND reaches down and grabs the picture from the
text: floor. He tosses the broken picture frame into the garbage
dialog: bag.
speaker_heading: BATHROOM
text: The cowboy grabs the white shower curtain and pulls it from
text: its rings. As the shower curtain is removed we are shocked
text: to see A BLOODY HANDPRINT on the shower wall. The print is
text: small and delicate. The print of a young woman. We then
dialog: quickly...
text: CUT TO BLACK.

scene_heading: INT. MEN’S LOCKER ROOM - L.A.P.D. - DAY
text: DeSantis opens up his locker and packs a few personal
text: belongings into a small gym bag. This includes a nickel-
text: plated .22 CALIBER HANDGUN. His backup weapon. Taped to the
text: inside of his locker door is a PHOTO of a young woman (20s) --
text: blonde and beautiful. DeSantis spots the photo out of the
text: corner of his eye. He takes a moment and gazes at the young
text: woman. He peels it from the locker door and tosses it into
text: his bag.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE OF CAPTAIN EDDIE GRUBER - NARCOTICS DIVISION
scene_heading: CAPT. GRUBER P.O.V.

text: DeSantis peers through the glass.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN GRUBER (0.S.)
dialog: Yeah. I just got off the phone
dialog: with IA five minutes ago and got an
text: earful.
text: DeSantis gives a quick knock before entering.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN GRUBER (0.S.)
dialog: I got trouble knocking on my door
dialog: right now. I/’11 call you later.
text: DeSantis shuts the door behind him and stands respectively
text: with his hands crossed and rested on his lap. We hear
text: Captain Gruber HANGING UP A PHONE.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN GRUBER (0.S.)
dialog: I hear you’ve officially requested
dialog: a stress leave. Ninety days?
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: That’s right.
text: The sound of Captain Gruber shifting in his chair, sighing
dialog: uncomfortably.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN GRUBER (0.S.)
dialog: Well that’s pretty damn irregular
dialog: considering the present
dialog: circumstances, don’t you think,
dialog: DeSantis?
text: The detective doesn’t respond. His eyes remain locked on the
text: Captain. He doesn’t even blink.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN GRUBER (0.S.)
dialog: Put yourself in my shoes, Charlie.
dialog: It’s only been two weeks since IA
dialog: cleared you on assault charges and
dialog: now you’re asking for a three month
dialog: leave.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: I know how it must look.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN GRUBER ({0.S.)
dialog: Good. Cos it looks real fuckin’
dialog: bad. I went to bat for you with
dialog: Internal Affairs to convince them
dialog: you weren’t losing it.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN GRUBER (0.S.) (cont'd)
dialog: Now you’re going on a psycho leave
dialog: and giving them every excuse to re-
dialog: open the investigation.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: I need to figure some things out.
dialog: About this place. About where I
dialog: stand.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN GRUBER (0.S.)
dialog: So you’re thinking about a
dialog: transfer?
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: Like I said...I need some time.
dialog: That’s all I can really tell you
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN GRUBER (0.S.)
dialog: All right. You listen and listen
dialog: good.
text: We slowly close on DeSantis’ face.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN GRUBER (0.S.)
dialog: As far as I’m concerned if you
dialog: wanna run off for three months and
dialog: ruin your record, that’s fine with
dialog: me. But let me make one thing
dialog: crystal clear to you. I don’t want
dialog: you in this building. I don’t want
dialog: to see you. I don’t wanna hear
dialog: about you harassing Vasquez. The
dialog: best advice I can give you...get
dialog: the hell as far away from here as
dialog: possible. Cos Internal Affairs
dialog: will be watching and so will I.
text: A slight grin on DeSantis as the Captain approves his three
dialog: month leave.

scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - UTAH - DUSK
text: The camera travels quickly down a two lane desert road. An
text: ORANGE SUN AND SKY illuminate the RED DESERT TERRAIN. It’s
dialog: beautiful. Nothing bad could ever happen here.
scene_heading: INT. DESANTIS’ CAR
text: The detective cruises down the long desert highways of Utah.
text: He passes the time by anxiously flipping through the channels
text: on his stereo -- not picking up much.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN BRYERSON - DAY
text: DeSantis slowly passes through the downtown avenues of
text: Bryerson, Utah. Population 3,459. It’s an old fashioned
text: burg that hasn’t seen a touch of remodeling since the
dialog: Eisenhower years.
text: The streets consist mostly of small, family owned businesses
text: and shops. An old movie palace, five and dime stores. An
text: ice cream parlor, etc. It’s very quaint in a dull and dreary
dialog: kind of way.
scene_heading: INT. DESANTIS’ CAR
text: He peeks out his window and spots the Sheriff’s office in the
text: near distance. He slows to a halt, approaching the front
text: door of the office. A SIGN ON THE WINDOW reads “Closed for
dialog: Sunday dinner”.
text: DeSantis grins at the sign -- shaking his head in amusement.
text: He continues down the street, headed for Sunday dinner.
scene_heading: EXT. HOME OF SHERIFF DAN PATTERSON
text: DeSantis pulls up to the front of the home. A real down home
text: southern cottage with a giant front yard and picket fence.
text: Children are running about the yard, playing tag, wresting,
dialog: rough-housing.
text: The detective attempts to park but there are cars up and down
text: both sides of the street -- as far as the eye can see.
text: DeSantis stares in amusement at the very basic innocence of
dialog: this town.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: Can Opey come out and play?
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD
text: The backyard is where the party is. A barbecue is going.
text: Music is playing. And rows of townspeople sit at picnic
text: tables, eating, socializing. Enjoying the simple life. It’s
text: a regular Sunday afternoon event for the people of Bryerson.
text: DeSantis and SHERIFF DAN PATTERSON (50s) stone faced and
text: rugged -- sit at a corner table, away from most of the crowd.
text: Also sitting with them is DEPUTY BILLY BRACKEN (20s) a short
text: and thin but fierce looking young man with a menacing stare
text: and something to prove. DeSantis hands The Sheriff a manila
dialog: folder.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: This is a missing person’s report
dialog: filed by The Gold’s in November of
dialog: 1996. After week four and no
dialog: contact was made, Darcy was
text: presumed dead. A little under two
text: weeks later...she shows up back at
dialog: home.
text: The Sheriff turns his attention from the paperwork to
text: DeSantis. He squints in confusion.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS (CONT’D)
dialog: Turns out she was staying with a
text: girlfriend and her brother at his
text: place. Some secluded cabin in the
text: woods, 40 miles up state. At the
dialog: time of her disappearance, her
text: parents were in the middle of an
dialog: ugly divorce. Darcy admitted to me
dialog: that she used this as a ploy to
dialog: keep her parents together.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: Why didn’t the Golds mention any of
dialog: this before?
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: They probably don’t want the past
dialog: drudged up any more than I do.
dialog: Being that Mr. and Mrs. Gold were
dialog: still contract players for NBC, the
dialog: whole incident became a huge media
dialog: case. Sheriff, what I’m asking is
dialog: this. I was hoping...for now...we
dialog: could keep this incident quiet.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The Sheriff stares over at Deputy Bracken who watches with
dialog: equal suspicion.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS (CONT’D)
dialog: You know if word of this leaks,
dialog: your town is flooded with
text: reporters. If her kidnapper is
dialog: continuing to make contact with
dialog: you, odds are he’s still here. I
dialog: think a media presence would only
dialog: scare this guy off. But I know you
dialog: already know that, Sheriff.
dialog: Otherwise you would’ve called the
dialog: state police and FBI the moment
dialog: Darcy was picked up.
text: The Sheriff cracks a smile -- SMIRKS at the young detective.
text: He’s blown away by his up front, in-your-face directness.
text: DeSantis is a force to be reckoned with. Whether the Sheriff
dialog: likes it or not.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: Anything else, Detective?
text: Deputy Bracken lets out a SMIRK as he devours another slice
dialog: of the pie.
text: DeSantis pays the Deputy no mind and stays focused on the
text: Sheriff’s eyes.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: I’d like permission to stick
dialog: around. Review your case files.
dialog: Talk to any witnesses you may have
dialog: questioned. You have a sketch of
dialog: this man. I’d like to help show
dialog: his picture around. See if we can
dialog: pinpoint who this man is. I’d like
dialog: to make myself useful, Sheriff.
text: Sheriff Patterson sighs in frustration. He sits, staring at
text: DeSantis with uncertainty.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK
text: Sheriff Patterson and DeSantis take a stroll down a sidewalk
text: in front of his home. Children are still running about.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: Since your friend disappeared, I’ve
text: been flooded with phone calls.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: ll.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON (cont'd)
text: People are coming in off the street
dialog: asking questions about a kidnapping
dialog: I don’t have any answers to. Like
dialog: you said, the only good lead we
dialog: have is the fact this man’s
dialog: Maintained contact. Until we get
dialog: something better, I don’t wanna
dialog: draw any more attention than I have
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: That includes flashing an LA badge
dialog: and making everyone even more
dialog: nervous. Next thing you know...the
dialog: whole town’s calling. Asking
dialog: questions. Wanting to know if
dialog: there’s some crazy bastard out
text: there abducting girls. Darcy’s
dialog: friends, The Golds, they don’t
dialog: wanna believe she’s gone.
text: Sheriff Patterson stops in his tracks -- faces DeSantis.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON (CONT’D)
dialog: Maybe they think you’1l tell them
dialog: something different. Something
dialog: they’d rather hear. You say you
dialog: wanna help?
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: Whatever I can.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: You keep them calm and out of my
dialog: hair so me and my men can do our
dialog: jobs.
scene_heading: INT. CASEY AND LEANNE’S MOTEL ROOM
text: At a corner table. DeSantis sits across from CASEY BRENNER
text: (20s) dark hair, as beautiful as Darcy.
text: Sitting on the edge of a nearby bed is Darcy’s other friend
text: LEANNE BOWMAN (20s) red hair, cute.
text: Sheriff Patterson leans his back comfortably against the
text: wall, listening in on the conversation. He remains silent
text: and passive despite his obvious disgust with DeSantis.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: He called twice. Yesterday and
dialog: today.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: At what time did you get the first
dialog: call?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Real early. I’d say around five in
dialog: the morning or so. Maybe Five
dialog: thirty.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: What did he have to say?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: He just wanted to let us know what
dialog: a great time he and Darcy were
dialog: having. Then he said whatever you
dialog: do, don’t leave your room for the
dialog: next few days. Either him or Darcy
dialog: would be calling back.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: Did you ask to speak with Darcy?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: He said she couldn’t come to the
text: phone. She was in the shower.
dialog: Getting cleaned up from their long,
dialog: hot night. He was disgusting.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: And what about this second call?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: He didn’t call again until
dialog: today...a little bit after two
dialog: o’clock. This time Sheriff
dialog: Patterson was here.
text: DeSantis notices Sheriff Patterson leaning on the wall. The
text: two men exchange stares.
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT’D)
dialog: He didn’t say anything about Darcy.
dialog: He just asked if I spoke with the
dialog: police. He said he had a message
dialog: for them.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 13.
dialog: (2)
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: A message?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: When I told him The Sheriff was
dialog: here and wanted to talk, he hung
dialog: up. I guess he panicked. That’s
dialog: when I called you. Darcy said to
dialog: call you if I ever needed help.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: You did good, Casey.
dialog: (to Sheriff)
dialog: Sheriff? You think I could have a
dialog: few minutes with the girls?
text: Sheriff Patterson gives DeSantis an angry stare, but
text: Maintains his cool composure.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: I’m gonna check on The Golds.
text: He continues out.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: Casey -- when we spoke the other
dialog: day, you mentioned that Darcy was
dialog: drinking a lot the night she
dialog: disappeared.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Yes she was. We all were. So
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: Do you know if Darcy’s been in any
dialog: kind of trouble lately? Like with
dialog: her drugs? Has she been depressed
dialog: at all?
text: Leanne visibly grows suspicious of the detective’s
text: questioning. As does Casey.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: What’re you saying?
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: Before The Sheriff and I can
dialog: continue any further we need to
dialog: establish Darcy’s mind set at the
dialog: time of her abduction.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: Casey seems to be growing impatient with the detective’s line
dialog: of questioning.
speaker_heading: LEANNE
dialog: What the hell does her mood have to
dialog: do with anything? She was picked
text: up in broad daylight in front of
dialog: two witnesses. What’s your
dialog: problem?
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: I know you’re both scared of the
dialog: publicity Darcy would get if this
dialog: thing went public. We all know
dialog: this isn’t the first time she’s
dialog: disappeared.
speaker_heading: LEANNE
dialog: That’s bullshit. That was eight
dialog: years ago. She was just a kid. I
dialog: can’t even believe you’re bringing
dialog: that up now.
dialog: (to Casey)
dialog: Please tell him he’s crazy.
text: Casey is awkwardly silent -- refusing to take sides with
dialog: Leanne. She’s already contemplated this.
speaker_heading: LEANNE (CONT’D)
dialog: Casey?
text: Leanne awaits an answer and doesn’t get one. She sits ina
text: state of total dismay and utter disgust, folding her arms and
text: looking away in protest.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
text: She jumped in a strange car
dialog: although the two of you strongly
dialog: advised against it. When the Feds
dialog: get wind of this, they’re gonna
dialog: find this behavior a little
dialog: suspicious. Especially with her
dialog: history of running away.
text: Leanne sighs, completely disgusted. She buries her face,
text: unable to even look at the detective.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS (CONT’D)
dialog: The reality is, if we can’t get her
dialog: back soon, this will go public.
text: That means FBI. A statewide APB.

speaker_heading: LEANNE
dialog: But she didn’t run away! She was
dialog: kidnapped!
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: I know she was. But in order for
dialog: me to find out exactly what
dialog: happened to Darcy, I’m gonna need
dialog: all the facts. I need to know if

dialog: dramas of the last ten years. She is a very important woman
dialog: and she knows it.
speaker_heading: MS. NEWMAN
dialog: I’m sorry to call you in here like
dialog: this. It’s been a long week. And
dialog: a stressful one at that.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: What is it you wanna talk about?
speaker_heading: MS. NEWMAN
dialog: We’ve been making provisions to re-
dialog: write Jennifer’s character back
dialog: into the show. We’re gonna be
dialog: bringing her back for next season.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I don’t understand. Didn’t we kill
dialog: her off?
speaker_heading: MS. NEWMAN
dialog: Yeah, but the fans miss her. They
dialog: miss her a lot.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I know. It takes time for any show

speaker_heading: MS. NEWMAN
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: No. I’m afraid our problem runs a

dialog: liquor.
text: Darcy notices this and becomes visibly worried.
speaker_heading: MS. NEWMAN
dialog: We’ve had a thirty percent drop in
dialog: ratings since last season. The
dialog: network feels it’s because of
dialog: Jennifer’s absence. Quite frankly,
dialog: they don’t feel we can last another

dialog: competition is just too stiff.

text: of her desk.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Did she say something to you about
dialog: coming back?
speaker_heading: MS. NEWMAN
dialog: No. But I don’t think that will be
dialog: a problem. Her new program hasn’t
dialog: taken off the way we expected.
dialog: There’s already talks of a mid
dialog: season replacement. She can easily
dialog: make the transition back to Beverly
text: Manor. Make a surprise appearance
dialog: on the season finale...and our
text: ratings will go through the roof.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: A surprise appearance? But we
dialog: already wrapped for this season.
speaker_heading: MS. NEWMAN
dialog: We’re gonna be re-shooting this
dialog: season’s last two episodes. It’s
dialog: the majority opinion that in order
dialog: to get us back in the race, our
dialog: last episode should be more of a
dialog: cliff hanger. Something that will
dialog: wet the viewer’s appetite. Make
dialog: them wanna tune in for another
dialog: season. The producers feel with
text: focusing the story line on
dialog: Jennifer, it could be our best year
dialog: ever.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: MS. NEWMAN
dialog: It seems the only logical way of
dialog: bringing Jennifer back this season
dialog: is if she exacts her much-awaited
text: revenge on Kristen. Unfortunately,
dialog: that would mean --
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: That would mean killing me off.
speaker_heading: MS. NEWMAN
dialog: It’s a ratings war, Darcy. And
dialog: we're losing fast. In the end, it
text: all comes down to the numbers.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWAY - DARCY’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: Darcy begins up a flight of stairs with a large bag of
text: groceries, looking completely disgusted. Her annoying
text: neighbor MICHAEL (20s) boyishly handsome, but a bit cocky,
text: looks over a railing and notices her coming up the stairs.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Darcy.
text: Darcy SIGHS in frustration -- continuing up the steps toward

text: ear to ear.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Funny running into you like this.
dialog: You coming up the steps just as I’m
dialog: leaving.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: And how did I know I’d be running
dialog: into you today?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: So you’ve been thinking about me?

speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT’D)

dialog: You’re red as a beet.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I’m having a hot flash. Now excuse

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I won’t keep you. I was just
dialog: wondering if you’d had time to re-
dialog: think my offer for dinner.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I have.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: So what did you decide?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I haven't.
text: Darcy passes Michael and continues up.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Okay. I can see I got you at a bad
dialog: time. If you change your mind --
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I know where you live.
text: Darcy disappears around a corner, out of sight.
scene_heading: INT. DARCY’S APARTMENT - DUSK
text: The BRIGHT SUN peaks itself through Darcy’s blinds and into
dialog: her living room.
text: Darcy is sprawled out on the couch, asleep. On the table in
text: front of her sits a GIN AND TONIC and a half-empty bottle.
text: Her PHONE RINGS. This startles Darcy, causing her to jump.
text: She lets the phone ring, eventually letting the answering

speaker_heading: MRS. GOLD (0.S.)

speaker_heading: DARCY

speaker_heading: MRS. GOLD (0.S.)
dialog: Just checking to see if you’re
dialog: still coming to dinner. Your
dialog: father’s expecting you, you know?
text: Darcy quickly wakes herself. Sits up.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Oh, man. What time is it?
text: She checks her watch and grabs her head in pain from sitting
text: up too fast.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: MRS. GOLD (0.S.)
dialog: It’s quarter till’ six. What’s
dialog: wrong?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Nothing. I have a headache.
speaker_heading: MRS. GOLD (0.S.)
dialog: Oh. So are you still coming?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I don’t know. I’ve kind of had a
dialog: bad day.
speaker_heading: MRS. GOLD (0.S.)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: DARCY
text: It’s a long, complicated story.
dialog: One I really don’t wanna get into
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: MRS. GOLD (0.S.)
dialog: Well it sounds to me like the last
dialog: thing you should do is be alone

speaker_heading: DARCY

speaker_heading: MR. GOLD
dialog: So what’s the big deal? I thought

speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I do. I guess.
speaker_heading: MR. GOLD
dialog: So what’s the problem? I think
dialog: it’1l be good for the show if she
dialog: came back. Especially for your
dialog: character.
speaker_heading: MRS. GOLD
dialog: I think Darcy’s concerned there
dialog: might not be room for both of them
dialog: on the show.
speaker_heading: MR. GOLD
dialog: Hey, Darcy. You’ve got no reason
dialog: to be upset about this. She’s been
dialog: on that program for seven years.
dialog: It’s only your first season. You
dialog: can’t just expect to win over her
dialog: fans just like that. You’1l have
dialog: to give them time to develop your
dialog: character.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: real truth.
speaker_heading: MR. GOLD (CONT’D)
dialog: But all that doesn’t matter. What
dialog: matters is your mother and I are
dialog: proud of you. You’ve accomplished
dialog: a lot this year. I know we haven’t
dialog: exactly been supportive. But you
dialog: surprised the hell out of a lot of
dialog: people by staying sober the way you

text: Darcy looks anything but proud.
speaker_heading: MRS. GOLD
dialog: He’s right, Darcy.

speaker_heading: MRS. GOLD (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: No. I guess I’m just not that
dialog: hungry.
speaker_heading: MR. GOLD
dialog: Listen to your father. Don’t let

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING

scene_heading: INT. DARCY’S APARTMENT

scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL’S APARTMENT - MINUTES LATER
text: Michael is in bed, asleep. He hears a LOUD KNOCKING coming
text: from the other room. He quickly gets up, tosses on a robe
text: and continues to the door. He answers and is in shock to see
text: DARCY standing before him.
text: Her makeup is a mess from crying. She stands silent and
text: still. Michael finally breaks the silence.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: It’s 11:30. A little late for
dialog: dinner, don’t you think?
text: Darcy invites herself inside -- still crying. She begins
text: kissing Michael. He is taken back at first, but doesn’t stop

text: chest -- forcing him against a wall as they continue.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL’S BEDROOM - SOME TIME LATER

scene_heading: INT. DARCY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Darcy enters. She is completely disheveled and seemingly

scene_heading: BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

speaker_heading: DARCY

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: And that’s pretty much it.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: And you don’t know anything else?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: No. But I could tell something was
dialog: wrong by the way she was acting. I
dialog: could hear her crying. When I
dialog: asked what it was, she wouldn’t
dialog: tell me. It was obvious she didn’t
dialog: feel like talking about it, so I
dialog: didn’t push.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: But she did tell you she lost her

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: No. Wot then. I didn’t hear about
dialog: that until later. But I knew she
dialog: had a bad day. You could tell she
dialog: just wanted to get the hell out of

text: Darcy doesn’t respond. She simply stares over at Casey with
dialog: disgust.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Sorry. I had to tell her.
speaker_heading: LEANNE
dialog: So what’s his problem anyway? Is
dialog: he, like, leaving dead flowers on
dialog: your doorstep and writing you poems
dialog: in his own blood?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: It’s not like that. He’s harmless.

speaker_heading: CASEY

speaker_heading: LEANNE
dialog: You slept with him?! You little
dialog: skank!
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: It was a mistake.
dialog: (to Casey)
dialog: Why did you even do that?
speaker_heading: LEANNE
dialog: Oh, I see. You could tell her you
dialog: porked some weird stalker guy you
dialog: barely even know, but you can’t
dialog: tell me?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Maybe it’s because I know you’d
dialog: freak out and call me pretty names
dialog: like ho-bag and skank.
speaker_heading: LEANNE
dialog: Well, I’m sorry, Darcy, but I’m not
dialog: the one who’s constantly breaking
dialog: our pact.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: A pact? There’s a pact?
speaker_heading: LEANNE
dialog: Darcey and I decided that the next
dialog: relationship we were in, we were
dialog: gonna hold out on our man for at
dialog: least three months. The idea being
dialog: that any man that can last three
dialog: months is in it for more than sex.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: (to Leanne)
dialog: Oh, yeah. While we’re on the

speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Busted! Now who’s the skank?
speaker_heading: LEANNE
dialog: Okay. First of all, that wasn’t
dialog: mine.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: It wasn’t mine! I know it wasn’t
dialog: Darcy’s, so who else could it be?
speaker_heading: LEANNE
dialog: If you’d shut up a second, I could
dialog: tell you, Casey!
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Okay, fine. Tell us. We’re all
dialog: ears.
text: Darcy breaks out in hysterics.
speaker_heading: LEANNE (CONT’D)

dialog: and you’re, like, re-directing
dialog: everything at me. Getting all in
dialog: my face.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: And how many times exactly did you
dialog: and Roger go out before he climbed
dialog: the great peaks of Mount Leanne?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Yeah, really. It couldn’t have

speaker_heading: LEANNE

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Great going, Leanne. I should’ve
dialog: known better than to tell you

dialog: everything and...
text: Leanne stops mid-sentence when she notices a suspicious MAN
text: (30s) blocking Darcy from entering the convenience store. He

text: shades and cowboy hat.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: LEANNE
dialog: That cowboy won’t let Darcy inside.

text: greasy cowboy as he continues to taunt Darcy.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: Just kick him in the balls, Darcy.
text: The cowboy finally gives up and lets Darcy pass. He

text: far end of the lot.
text: Casey watches the mysterious man as he returns her stare. He
text: grins and points his finger at her, all the while holding a
text: bottle of beer in the same hand. He flicks his thumb as if
text: he’s pulling an imaginary trigger.
text: Casey is visibly frightened by this.
text: The cowboy crawls in his truck, cranks up the engine. He

dialog: brick?
text: Casey checks with Darcy.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: So maybe it isn’t the most sincere
dialog: of toasts. I’m just trying to bea
dialog: good sport.
dialog: (changing the subject)
dialog: Okay. For real this time. All
dialog: joking aside. Here’s to my mother
dialog: and father, Henry and Sharon Gold.
dialog: May their love only grow stronger
dialog: in these very difficult days that

text: tap glasses, throw back another shot.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: (to Darcy)
dialog: Why don’t you ease up a bit. Don’t
dialog: you think you’re hitting the booze
dialog: a little hard?
speaker_heading: DARCY

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: I don’t want him hassling us again.
speaker_heading: DARCY

speaker_heading: CASEY

speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: No. You’re just drinking too
dialog: little.
speaker_heading: SOME TIME LATER

speaker_heading: CASEY

speaker_heading: CASEY

speaker_heading: DARCY

speaker_heading: CASEY

speaker_heading: LEANNE

dialog: What? Did you forget something?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: No. Back there in that car. I saw
text: someone. They were bleeding and
dialog: they weren’t moving!
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: I didn’t see anything.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I did! And he was bleeding! Look!
dialog: Somebody could be hurt! Now will
dialog: you just go back!
speaker_heading: LEANNE
dialog: I saw something too, Casey. Maybe
dialog: we should check it out.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Are you kidding me? We’re in the
dialog: middle of nowhere. You don’t know
dialog: that guy. He could have a gun or
dialog: something. He could stuff the
text: three of us in his trunk.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: It’s my truck and I’m telling you
dialog: to turn around right now!
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: No way, Darcy! Forget it!
text: Darcey forcefully grabs the wheel, jerking it to the right,
text: forcing them onto the soft shoulder. Casey quickly steps on
dialog: the brakes.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: What the fuck, Darcy! What the
dialog: hell’s the matter with you?! Are

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Alright, Darcy. We’ll go back.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY
text: Casey pulls a quick u-turn and heads back toward the idle

speaker_heading: INT. S.U.V.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Wait here.
speaker_heading: CASEY

scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY

scene_heading: INT. STATION WAGON
speaker_heading: CAMERA P.O.V.

speaker_heading: LEANNE
dialog: Now would be a good time to go get

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Let me guess. You want me to do

speaker_heading: LEANNE
dialog: Well, you’re closer.
text: Casey smirks at Leanne, shakes her head and steps out.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. S.U.V.

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Darcy!
speaker_heading: DARCY

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: LEANNE
dialog: What the hell is she doing?
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Darcy, I’m serious! Let’s go!

dialog: friend. She has to know.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSEAT - STATION WAGON
text: Darcy picks up the wallet from the seat. She opens it and
text: notices that it is completely empty. No loose cash, no
text: nothing. Suddenly...THE MAN BEHIND THE WHEEL sits up and

scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY
text: Casey watches in horror.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: DARCY!!!

speaker_heading: INT. S.U.V.

speaker_heading: LEANNE
dialog: OH MY GOD!!!
dialog: 39.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY
text: Casey chases after the car on foot as a panicked Darcy smacks

speaker_heading: LEANNE
text: Jumps from the car and yells for Casey to return.
speaker_heading: LEANNE

speaker_heading: INT. S.U.V.
speaker_heading: CASEY

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: The phone’s not working!
text: They gain on Darcy’s kidnapper but quickly begin to slow
text: down. Leanne hits the gas repeatedly, but seems to do no

text: Leanne looks down at the gauge. The tank is empty.
speaker_heading: LEANNE

scene_heading: EXT. DINER

speaker_heading: DESANTIS

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: So you heard about that did you?
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: You wanna tell me about Janet
dialog: Cooney?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: Not much to tell. She was this
text: hooker. Drifted in to town some
dialog: years back. She was out there on
dialog: the highway, sellin’ her ass for
text: about two years. One night, some
text: john picks her up, beats her damn
text: near to death, then drops her in
dialog: the desert right where he found
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: No leads?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: No. She’s got no known family. We
dialog: couldn’t get anyone to claim the
dialog: body. After the autopsy, we had
text: her cremated. Outside her
dialog: occupation, no one seems to know
dialog: much about her.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: So what’s your take on what
dialog: happened?
text: Sheriff Patterson stares suspiciously over at DeSantis.
text: Reluctant to answer.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: We found a switchblade in the dirt
text: near Cooney’s body, covered in
text: blood. Her right thumb and finger
dialog: were sliced up real good.
dialog: Examiner said she cut herself with
dialog: the blade. So I’m thinking, he
text: starts getting rough with her so
text: she pulls the knife.
text: DeSantis going over the case in his head and comparing his
dialog: theories with the Sheriff.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON (CONT’D)
text: He tries to knock the knife out of

speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON (CONT’D)

dialog: Only he don’t stop. When he’s
text: done, he drags her into the desert
text: and off he goes into the sweet bye
dialog: and bye.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: What about the possibility this
dialog: guy’s local?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: I don’t think so. Her house was
text: only a quarter mile up the road
dialog: from where we found her. That’s
dialog: where she usually took her johns.
dialog: I think this guy wanted a quickie
dialog: for the road. Besides. A local
dialog: knows about a thousand better
dialog: hiding places for that body than on
text: the side of the highway in plain
dialog: view. No. This guy was ina
dialog: panic.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: That would be true. Unless he
dialog: wanted you to find her body.
text: Sheriff Patterson turns and gives DeSantis a discerning
dialog: stare.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: I know what you’re getting at. Now
dialog: just in case you’re thinking
dialog: there’s a connection between the
dialog: Cooney murder and your girl getting
dialog: snatched, you can hold it right
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: I didn’t say that.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: No, but you’re hinting at it. I’m
dialog: not as slow as you think, DeSantis.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: You got a small town, Sheriff. I
dialog: wouldn’t think this type of thing
dialog: happens every day.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: No, it doesn’t.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: And you don’t think there’s a
dialog: possibility of a connection?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: I watched that girl for years,
text: peddling her ass on that highway.
dialog: It was a matter of time before some
dialog: nut job passing through town broke
text: her neck or cut her throat. The
dialog: last thing I wanna do is scream
dialog: serial killer and get everyone in
dialog: town into an uproar. They’ll be
dialog: burning up my phone line every time
dialog: little Susie’s late getting home
dialog: from cheerleading.
text: DeSantis visibly grows weary of Sheriff Patterson’s uncaring,
dialog: lazy attitude.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: This isn’t LA. It’s peaceful here.
dialog: For the last twenty years these
dialog: people have been looking to me to
dialog: keep it that way. If word gets out
dialog: I’m losing control, then all hell
text: breaks loose.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - CRIME SCENE
text: The sound of a door being unlocked. Enter DeSantis and
text: Sheriff Patterson. The first thing DeSantis notices are the
text: MINUTE DROPS OF BLOOD on the carpet, leading into the
dialog: bathroom.
speaker_heading: HIS P.O.V.
text: DeSantis looks into the bathroom and instantly notices the
text: BLOODY HANDPRINT on the interior wall of the shower. (No
dialog: shower curtain)
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: The two men continue further into the room. DeSantis takes
text: notice of the barren hook on the wall where a picture once
dialog: hung.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: I figured they started fighting
dialog: right about here.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Sheriff Patterson stands near the center of the room where
text: the picture fell from the wall.
text: DeSantis notices small pieces of broken glass and a BLOODY
text: RIGHT HANDPRINT. The small print of a young woman.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON (CONT’D)
dialog: Looks like they started fighting,
text: he throws her into the wall,
text: knocking the picture down and
dialog: shattering the frame. That’s
text: probably where she cut herself.
dialog: She falls right about here and
text: bleeds out.
text: DeSantis turns his attention from the bloody spot to yet
text: another BLOOD STAIN about ten feet away. A good foot from
text: that stain are TWO MORE BLOODY HANDPRINTS. The prints are
text: small and delicate.
text: He approaches the blood evidence, kneels down to take a
text: closer look.
text: In the corner of the room sits a small round table. There is
text: a small BLOOD SMEAR on the edge of the table.
text: DeSantis then motions toward the BLOOD STAIN and HANDPRINTS
text: on the carpet -- connecting all the dots in his head.
text: He stands and motions toward the bed. The blankets are
text: turned down on only half of the bed, as if only one person
dialog: has slept in it.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: You get the lab results from
dialog: forensics?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
text: Yeah. They pulled a blonde hair
text: from the bed sheets and crossed it
text: with a sample from Darcy’s hair
dialog: brush. Wo match.
text: DeSantis stays focused on the crime scene, completely
text: ignoring Sheriff Patterson.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: DeSantis kneels over the bathtub, takes a peek. Sheriff
text: Patterson hovers behind him. DeSantis notices the prints of
text: THREE BLOODY FINGERTIPS on the edge of the tub.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: You notice anything missing?
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
text: The shower curtain.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
text: He used it to wrap the body.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
text: There’s three print smears on the
dialog: edge of the tub, plus the
dialog: handprint. But the rest of the
dialog: shower’s immaculate. It’s like he
dialog: cleaned around it.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: Looks like she regained
text: consciousness and tried to get out.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: What’s wrong with this picture?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: The handprint. It’s too high up
dialog: the wall. If your girl were flat
dialog: on her back, there’s no way she’d
dialog: reach.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: Very good, Sheriff, but what does
dialog: it mean?
scene_heading: INT. SHERIFF PATTERSON’S HOME - OFFICE - NIGHT
text: DeSantis sifts through a stack of CRIME SCENE PHOTOS from
text: both the Janet Cooney murder and the motel room where Darcy
text: was assaulted. Sheriff Patterson sits comfortably with his
text: feet kicked up on a desk, waiting for DeSantis to finish.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: I don’t know what you think you’re
dialog: gonna find, but we’ve been over
dialog: every inch of those things a
dialog: thousand times.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: It never hurts to have a fresh pair
text: of eyes.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: Look. If I don’t get to bed, my
dialog: wife’s gonna come looking for me.
text: DeSantis picks up a large PHOTO OF JANET COONEY’S BODY from
text: the desk. It is a FULL SHOT of her body, laying idle in the
text: desert. Her LEFT ARM lay fully extended and exposed. Her
text: RIGHT ARM is carefully place behind her back.
text: He lays the picture down and reviews the next; a CLOSE UP of
text: the deceased’s LEFT HAND. There are severe cuts on the
text: woman’s thumb and index finger. Self-inflicted wounds caused
text: by a switchblade.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: Wait a minute.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: What?
text: DeSantis picks up another CRIME SCENE PHOTO from the desk;
text: the BLOODY HANDPRINT of Darcy’s LEFT HAND on the shower wall.
text: He lays the photo down and picks up another; a shot of
text: another BLOODY HANDPRINT on the motel room’s carpet. Darcy’s
text: wounded RIGHT HAND after she is violently tossed to the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: There’s only one print on the
dialog: carpet.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: If Darcy cut both her hands on the
dialog: glass, then why is there only a
dialog: right hand print on the carpet?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: Simple. Her left hand never
text: touched the floor.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: Maybe. Or someone else cut it for
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: What’re you saying?
text: DeSantis tosses down a photo and picks up another. This one
text: is a CLOSE UP of Cooney’s RIGHT ARM, placed carefully behind
text: her back.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
text: Cooney’s arm was found behind her
dialog: back. I don’t think this was
dialog: coincidence. This is how your guy
dialog: restrained her. She didn’t die in
dialog: that car. Your guy walked her into
dialog: the desert first.
text: The wheels begin to turn in Sheriff Patterson’s eyes.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS (CONT’D)
text: Then he wraps her arm around her
text: back and listens to her scream in
dialog: pain as she begs for her life. You
dialog: know what else? I think he did the
dialog: same thing to Darcy.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: Now hold on. Don’t you think
dialog: you’re getting a little ahead of
dialog: yourself? All this could be
dialog: coincidence.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: That’s why the left hand print. He
text: pulls Darcy’s arm around her back.
dialog: Just like he did to Cooney. That’s
text: when he cut her. He cuts her left
text: hand and plants her print on the
dialog: shower wall.
text: DeSantis picks up the photo of Cooney’s LEFT HAND, severely
text: wounded from a knife.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS (CONT’D)
dialog: Darcy’s left hand print. That’s
dialog: what he wanted us to find. That’s
dialog: the connection.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: Find what? And what connection?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: I think I know what this guy was

dialog: Come and get me, cop.
scene_heading: INT. SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: DeSantis, Sheriff Patterson and The Golds sit at a large
text: conference table, discussing the investigation.
text: The Golds appear very weary. They look as if they’ve been
text: erying non-stop for days.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: Has Darcy mentioned anything to you
dialog: about getting strange phone calls
dialog: or if someone might be following
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: MR. GOLD
dialog: If there were someone like that,
dialog: she wouldn’t tell us.
speaker_heading: MRS. GOLD
dialog: She doesn’t like to worry us.
dialog: We've always been very protective
dialog: with Darcy. When her drugs started
dialog: getting out of control, we put her
text: in a hospital. When she got out,
dialog: we insisted she come stay with us
dialog: for awhile. She didn’t want any
dialog: part of it. But the network
dialog: insisted she stayed under strict
dialog: supervision those first few months
text: out of the program. She’s barely
dialog: spoken with us since.
text: DeSantis is locked into every word. A look of intense
text: concentration consumes his face.
speaker_heading: MR. GOLD
dialog: She was hell bent on jumping right
dialog: back into her career. No matter
dialog: how much we were against it.
text: DeSantis looks to be in deep thought, pondering what The
text: Golds have told him. He snaps out of it and turns his
text: attention back to The Golds.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 49.
scene_heading: EXT. SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - DAY
text: Mr. Gold takes his dog for a short walk across the parking
text: lot, leash in hand. Sharon stands in front of the office,
text: puffs away at a cigarette, taking one nervous drag after the
text: next as DeSantis exits the building. He spots her, quietly
text: having a seat on an outside bench.
speaker_heading: MRS. GOLD
dialog: It really is beautiful country,
dialog: isn’t it?
text: DeSantis stares off into the mountains, as if for the first
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: Yes, it certainly is. I guess I
dialog: never stopped to notice.
speaker_heading: MRS. GOLD
dialog: I forgot how much I missed it here.
dialog: It’s so quiet. Sometimes I wonder
dialog: if Darcy were better off being
text: raised in a small town. Someplace
dialog: where people don’t walk all over
dialog: you, or spit on you so much as look
dialog: at you.
text: Sharon nervously reaching for another smoke, sparking it up.
text: DeSantis noticing her slowly growing angry, almost breaking
text: out into tears.
speaker_heading: MRS. GOLD (CONT’D)
dialog: But we were the typical Hollywood
dialog: family. Darcy spent most of her
dialog: childhood either listening to Henry
text: and I argue or watching us drink.
dialog: Our whole world revolved around the
dialog: next audition or getting picked up
dialog: by some stupid pilot. And it was
dialog: always a competition. We thought
dialog: our lives would change if we had a
dialog: baby and stopped thinking about
dialog: ourselves. But it didn’t. Nothing
dialog: ever changed.

text: ball with his dog.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MRS. GOLD (CONT’D)
text: Except now, instead of two angry
dialog: people in the house, there were
dialog: three. I remember when things got
dialog: too hot between Henry and me at the
dialog: dinner table...Darcy would ask if
dialog: the three of us could go get ice
dialog: cream. We would always give in.
dialog: Every time. It seems like every
dialog: other night, after dinner, we were
text: sitting down at Scoops. Watching
dialog: each other eat ice cream. None of
dialog: us saying a damn thing. But it
text: always put a smile on Darcy’s face.
dialog: Henry and I would just look at each
text: other, smiling at what a little con
dialog: artist she was. She was funny that
dialog: way.
text: Sharon turns, smiling at DeSantis, who politely returns her
dialog: grin.
speaker_heading: MRS. GOLD (CONT’D)
dialog: I guess she had to have a sense of
dialog: humor living with the two of us.
dialog: Imagine our shock when Darcy
dialog: announced she wanted to be an
dialog: actress like her mommy. I guess,
text: in a way, she’d been performing her
dialog: whole life. That’s all she ever
dialog: knew how to do.
text: DeSantis slowly drifts off into a daydream, contemplating
dialog: what Sharon has told him.
scene_heading: INT. DESANTIS CAR - NIGHT
text: DeSantis cruises down a long, dark stretch of highway. He

text: makes his way down the path until he approaches TWO PATROL
scene_heading: CARS -- LIGHTS FLASHING.
text: Parked in the middle of the road is the BLUE STATION WAGON

scene_heading: INT./EXT. DESANTIS CAR
text: DeSantis steps out and approaches the abandoned car. He is
text: greeted by Sheriff Patterson.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: Is she...?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: No. But we did find this.
text: Sheriff Patterson walks to the rear of the station wagon and
text: motions inside. He grabs one of FIVE LARGE RED GAS CANS from
text: the trunk. They are all filled to the brim with gasoline.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON (CONT’D)
text: Looks like he siphoned the gas out
text: of Darcy’s truck the night before.
dialog: And so the game continues.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: You get a lead on the owner?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: No tags, no registration and not
text: one visible VIN on the entire car.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: Anything else?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: Take a look for yourself.

text: Sheriff Patterson motions toward bright RED BLOOD on the
text: outside of the driver’s door.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON (CONT’D)
text: Red paint. It’s all over the
dialog: interior.
text: DeSantis peeks his head inside, taking in the carefully
text: staged crime scene. Fake blood is carefully spattered on the

speaker_heading: DESANTIS

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
text: To the untrained eye, like Darcy,

text: DeSantis pulls his head from the window and faces The
dialog: Sheriff.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON (CONT’D)
dialog: And just when she figures him for

text: his ID and off he goes.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: I.D.?
text: Sheriff Patterson hands DeSantis a black wallet.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
text: Found it in the backseat along with
text: a mess of stolen credit cards, no
dialog: cash. The cards were scattered
dialog: everywhere and the wallet was
dialog: empty. Your girl probably spotted
text: it in the backseat and got in to
dialog: get a closer look.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: It’s a set-up. He makes it so he
dialog: got shot by some drifter who
text: snagged his cash.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: This guy sure went through a lot of

speaker_heading: DESANTIS

speaker_heading: CASEY

speaker_heading: DESANTIS

speaker_heading: CASEY

text: Mr. Gold simply stands in shock, unsure of his next move. He

text: Mrs. Gold runs to the doorway and notices something taped on

text: Mrs. Gold SCREAMS out in horror. Mr. Gold runs back into the

dialog: (to The Golds)
dialog: I assume you and your wife don’t

speaker_heading: MR. GOLD
dialog: No. We've got about $100,000 in

dialog: close.
speaker_heading: MRS. GOLD
dialog: Maybe if we made a good faith
dialog: payment it could buy us some more
dialog: time...
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: It won’t work. It’s got to be
dialog: $500,000. Not a dime less or he

speaker_heading: LEANNE

speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: If this goes public and the press

speaker_heading: MRS. GOLD
dialog: I don’t understand. Darcy’s
dialog: missing, possibly dead and you’re
dialog: talking about publicity.
speaker_heading: DESANTIS
dialog: As twisted as it may sound, putting

dialog: booster. Once we get her back, a
dialog: lot of people are gonna want to

speaker_heading: CASEY

speaker_heading: MRS. GOLD

speaker_heading: FORENSIC EXAMINER (CONT’D)
dialog: The victim also suffered a

text: DeSantis focuses on the body closely.
speaker_heading: FORENSIC EXAMINER (CONT’D)
dialog: Upon first examination, we find
dialog: Maggot mass aggregation in the
dialog: pelvic and genital regions of the
text: body and also in the skull and
dialog: nasal cavities. It was the
dialog: particularly small size of the
dialog: larvae that I found interesting.
dialog: The fact that these maggots
dialog: remained stabilized and didn’t
dialog: continue their growth cycle
dialog: suggests the body remained in a
dialog: cooler climate. I also found empty
text: puparium on the underside of the
text: body and on the remains of the
dialog: shower curtain.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: FORENSIC EXAMINER
dialog: It means that the victim had

dialog: The size of the maggots in the

speaker_heading: SHERIFF PATTERSON

speaker_heading: MR. GOLD
dialog: Damn it.
text: Darcy pulls a tissue from her pocket.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Here.

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: Darcy walks in and over to the sink -- begins filling the

text: She can’t help but notice a stack of magazines sitting to the

scene_heading: page marked SECTION 2: THE TRANSPLANT PROCESS.

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Why the hell would I do that?
speaker_heading: DESANTIS

dialog: You played it cool in Utah when I
