scene_heading: MONTAGE. EXT. KENSINGTON GARDENS. DAY. FLASHBACK. 1A
text: A little girl’s feet walk on a gravel path beside a woman’s heavy
text: skirts. From behind, the child holds the hand of a governess. A
text: couple passes. They see her and stop. The man bows, removing his
text: top hat. The woman curtseys. We see the young face, accepting this
text: deference from strangers.

text: The red Robe of State is laid out on a chair. A dog has curled up

text: The door of a gilded carriage is opened and gloved hands unroll its

dialog: the nursery table.
text: The finger moves across to the childless Duke of York, “died 1803.”
text: Next, King William IV, and his two dead daughters. On to the dead
text: Duke of Kent, his widow and, finally, his daughter Victoria, “born
dialog: 1819.”
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (V.0.)
dialog: The first four sons of King George III
dialog: could boast only one living child... And
dialog: that was me.
text: The tiny finger hesitates, poised over the name.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (V.0.)
dialog: And so I learned that I was nearer to the
dialog: Crown than I had thought...
text: A young girl, with ringlets and a simple dress, is looking at the

text: in brilliant colours with an elaborate hair style, and a sharply
text: dressed man. They study the child’s reaction. She runs away.

text: We cut to a spectacular wide shot. The whole of Westminster Abbey
text: is laid out before us in dazzling magnificence, with gallery after
text: gallery, tier upon tier, packed with Government, Court and
text: Aristocracy, all standing, all exultant. The banks of peers,
text: gorgeous in red velvet and ermine, put on their own coronets while
text: the peeresses, in separate stands, reach up to place their coronets
text: among their head-dresses of feathers and diamonds. Their long,
text: white gloves raised in unison, backed by the colours of the
text: costumes, make their arms seem like a thousand swans in flight.
text: The whole effect is more thrilling, more exciting, more glamorous,
dialog: than can almost be imagined.
text: At last, and for the first time, we see the face of the new Queen
text: of England. She is eighteen, soft, innocent and almost childlike, a
text: poignant contrast to the glittering diadem on her head, proclaiming
dialog: centuries of tradition. The title appears:
dialog: The Young Victoria
text: As it disappears, Victoria turns her head to look at someone: A
text: smiling Melbourne is in the viscounts’ stand. The premier mouths
dialog: “Perfect”. As serious as the new Queen tries to be, she can’t
text: refrain from the faintest trace of a smile. Now, we pull focus. In
text: the background, in a gallery defined as Royal by the coats of arms
text: upon it, we see a handsome, middle aged woman, deeply moved by the
text: events she witnesses. This is the Duchess of Kent. As we close in
text: on her and see the very real emotion in her eyes, a new voice is
dialog: heard.
speaker_heading: DUCHESS OF KENT (V.OC.)
dialog: You are sure? That we’re doing the right
dialog: thing?
scene_heading: INT. VICTORIA'S BEDROOM. KENSINGTON PALACE. NIGHT. 2

text: 1830s. A title appears...
dialog: One year earlier
speaker_heading: CONROY
dialog: We've waited long enough! For the last
dialog: time, you will sign this order.
text: Sir John Conroy, the Duchess’s Controller, handsome, vain and
text: arrogant, throws a cold look at the Duchess. Striding past a
text: canopied four poster, he.comes to a smaller bed where Victoria
text: lies, flushed with fever, barely awake. He puts in front of her, a
text: paper on a board and, with it, a pen.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I will not sign it.
speaker_heading: CONROY
dialog: I say you will!
text: He pushes the pen into her hand, holding it over the paper.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: And I say I will not!
text: With a supreme effort, she pulls her hand free and flings the pen
text: to the floor, pushing paper and board after it, as she collapses
text: onto the pillows. His anger bursts as he pounces on it with a roar,
text: lifting his hand to strike her -
speaker_heading: LEHZEN
dialog: Sir John.
text: Baroness Lehzen, Victoria’s governess, stands, immobile, in the
text: doorway. She is a dour figure next to the weak bird of paradise
dialog: that is Victoria’s mother.
scene_heading: DUCHESS OF KENT
dialog: Ah, Baroness, Sir John was just...
text: She tails away. How can she justify the scene?
speaker_heading: LEHZEN
dialog: It’s time for the Princess’s medicine.

dialog: Of course. Shall I...?

scene_heading: DUCHESS OF KENT
dialog: Well, if you’re sure... good night, mein
dialog: liebling.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Good night, Mama.
text: As she speaks, Victoria eyes her mother coldly. Pointing up the
text: irony of this relationship is a nearby portrait of the Duchess with
text: her baby daughter. Things have clearly changed. The Duchess glances
text: nervously at Conroy and, after a moment of angry indecision, he
text: picks up the discarded pen and the paper. The Duchess leaves. She
text: passes Lehzen, who sinks low into a court curtsey. Standing, she
text: turns her face away as Conroy marches out.

dialog: fhe Royal Palace, Brussels.
text: In a sumptuous setting, two men walk together, one proud and
dialog: splendid, King Leopold of the Belgians, the other wizened and
text: dressed in black, Baron Stockmar. They are trailed by equerries.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: My sister says she won't sign the order for
dialog: a Regency.
text: Stockmar is not surprised. Leopold waits for an explanation.
speaker_heading: STOCKMAR
dialog: Why would she sign it? The Princess is
dialog: nearly eighteen. Why would she sign away
dialog: her own powers?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Because she’s an ignorant baby! Because she
dialog: needs guidance and time, to prepare for her
dialog: role as Queen! And until she’s ready, my
dialog: sister will take her place as Regent!
text: The last is added lamely, which Stockmar almost reprimands.
speaker_heading: STOCKMAR
dialog: Sir John Conroy would be Regent.

speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: According to your spy. Does Victoria know
dialog: her governess is writing to you?
speaker_heading: STOCKMAR
text: Baroness Lehzen has a wide correspondence.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: So? What are you suggesting?
speaker_heading: STOCKMAR
text: When the Princess succeeds to the Throne,
dialog: she’ll turn away from anyone who's helped
dialog: her enemies. It may be in Your Majesty's
dialog: interest to consider abandoning Conroy and
dialog: your sister before it’s too late, and
dialog: instead support the future Queen.
text: Leopold looks at him. Reluctantly, he gives a slight nod.
speaker_heading: STOCKMAR
dialog: Of course the Duchess won't like it.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Baron, I was born the younger son of a
dialog: penniless duke. Now, I am King of the
dialog: Belgians. Such journeys are not managed

speaker_heading: KING WILLIAM
