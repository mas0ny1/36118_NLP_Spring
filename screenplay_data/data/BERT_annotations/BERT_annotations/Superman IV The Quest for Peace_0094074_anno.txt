dialog: Lawrence Konner
dialog: Revised 30th October, 1986
dialog: 1	EARTH
text: Rolls into FRAME. A bauble of green and blue and white swirls of cloud cover. The eerie clip and whistle of cosmic rays is drowned out by static and someone singing 'MY WAY' - in Russian.
dialog: 2	MOVING INTO FRAME - A SOVIET CAPSULE
text: Gleaming white. Black letters on its side, CCCP. A Russian COSMONAUGHT in his space suit is outside, repairing radio antenna. He's the one singing.
dialog: 3	INSIDE THE CAPSULE
text: Three COSMONAUGHTS, two men and a woman, in gym shorts and red T-shirts, are busy floating to their stations. The CAPTAIN, teases his space walker.
dialog: CAPTAIN
dialog: (Russian with subtitles)
dialog: Spare us the serenade, Comrade
dialog: Sinatra. You're not at home.
dialog: 4	OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE
speaker_heading: COSMONAUGHT
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: At home my kids tell me to save my
dialog: singing for outer space...
dialog: 5	RACING INTO VIEW
dialog: A piece of spare debris! The discarded chunk of a failed satellite.
dialog: 6	INSIDE THE CAPSULE
text: The COSMONAUGHTS notice the debris on its deadly course toward the COSMONAUGHT outside. Looks of consternation are exchanged.
dialog: 7	OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE
dialog: The COSMONAUGHT sees the debris moving toward him. He tries to react, moving first
dialog: right then left.
dialog: 8	CONTACT
dialog: The debris hits the ship sending the COSMONAUGHT into space.
speaker_heading: COSMONAUGHT
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: I'm lost! Goodbye!
dialog: 9	THE CAPSULE
text: Tumbles helplessly out of orbit, head over heels, out of control. The door hatch is clearly
dialog: damaged.
dialog: 10	INSIDE - THE CREW
dialog: Trying desperately to regain control of the ship. They are tossed about like clothes in a spin dryer.
speaker_heading: 11	SUDDENLY
dialog: The spinning stops! The COSMONAUGHTS exchange startled looks.
dialog: CAPTAIN
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: What the...
dialog: 12	OUTSIDE
text: The SPACE SHIP moves slowly through the FRAME, now upright and in control, gliding through space.
dialog: 13	TILT ANGLE - JUST BELOW - SUPERMAN!
dialog: Carrying the SHIP gently.
dialog: 14	CLOSE ON SUPERMAN
dialog: His face shines with the same familiar resolve, the same steady strength, the same calm in the
dialog: heat of crisis the world expects. He turns and sees the lost COSMONAUGHT moving away
dialog: in space.
speaker_heading: 15	SUPERMAN
dialog: Flies off towards him.
dialog: 16	BACK TO SPACE
dialog: The COSMONAUGHT is losing consciousness.
dialog: 17	P.O.V. - MOVING TO THE COSMONAUGHT
dialog: Something overtakes him. He stops tumbling! Through his helmet, we can see his 	surprise.
text: SUPERMAN carries the COSMONAUGHT to the capsule. He maneuvers the COSMONAUGHT to the airlock. Eases him through the hatch, then repairs the damaged door.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: (in perfect Russian - subtitled)
dialog: I think you'll be safer in here, Sir.
dialog: 18	INSIDE THE CAPSULE
dialog: The COSMONAUGHTS strain to look out their porthole. SUPERMAN slides by the
text: window. The CREW clasps hands in thanks. SUPERMAN smiles humbly and then
dialog: dives backward toward Earth.
dialog: ROLL OPENING CREDITS as . . .
dialog: 19	SUPERMAN HEADS FOR HOME
text: Daylight comes with a new dawn from the east. SUPERMAN shoots over the horizon.
dialog: (IMAX footage of Earth taken by the space shuttle.)
dialog: 20	THE EARTH BELOW
dialog: The warm sunlight highlights recognizable landmasses. This is home. Africa rolls
dialog: slowly by. Then we see SUPERMAN float above Europe. Over the Atlantic, the ocean
dialog: sparkles in shades of blue.
dialog: 21	THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
dialog: The continental states appear as precisely detailed as every map in every school room in
text: America. SUPERMAN hovers for a moment as if to admire the view. He arcs TOWARD us
dialog: and then disappears below.
speaker_heading: CREDITS END
scene_heading: 22	EXT. SMALLVILLE - THE KENT FARM - DAY
text: The old wooden farmhouse is now weathered and shuttered. A 'FOR SALE' sign in front.
dialog: 23	TWO HEADSTONES - GEORGE AND MARTHA KENT
dialog: Fresh wildflowers adorn the graves.
speaker_heading: 24	CLARK KENT
dialog: Shares a silent moment with the good people who raised him. Hands in his old jeans. Sleeves
dialog: rolled up on his workshirt. He's for now just an orphan boy from the Midwest.
scene_heading: 25	CLARK'S X-RAY VISION P.O.V. - FAR DOWN THE ROAD
text: He can see the dirt cloud of a car heading his way. CLARK turns and hurries toward the barn.
dialog: 26	INT. THE BARN
text: In the middle of the barn, CLARK has excavated a deep hole. He jumps out and hurries
dialog: under the hayloft, reaching for...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 27	A HAY-COVERED TARP
dialog: CLARK brushes off the hay, removes the canvas cover.
dialog: 28	PUSH IN TO REVEAL - KAL-EL'S ROCKET
dialog: The metallic carcass of the space vessel that carried the young KAL-EL from KRYPTON to
dialog: Earth.
dialog: 29	CLARK DRAGS THE SHELL ACROSS THE BARN
dialog: He maneuvers it deep into its new hiding place.
dialog: 30	CLOSEUP CLARK'S HAND BRUSHES INTERIOR OF THE SHIP
text: A soot-covered CONTROL PANEL begins to glow with a soft GREEN LIGHT.
dialog: 31	AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT
text: Startled, CLARK crouches inside the space vessel. A VOICE, at first distorted, is familiar.
dialog: CLARK
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Father!
dialog: Now we HEAR what is an old message from JOR-EL.
dialog: JOR-EL
dialog: by now Kal-El you are entering the
dialog: atmosphere of the planet known as earth ...
dialog: CLARK is overwhelmed by JOR-EL'S voice.
dialog: CONTINUED
dialog: 31	CONTINUED
speaker_heading: JOR-EL (Cont.)
dialog: ... I pray you have made a safe journey. The
dialog: yellow sun of your new home will give you
dialog: great physical powers ... but it cannot console
dialog: your spirit. Placed aboard this vessel is an energy
dialog: module ... all that remains of a once powerful
dialog: civilisation -- Krypton, your mother planet. It is
dialog: my last gift to you. Once removed, the ship will
dialog: grow cold and silent, and you will be finally
dialog: alone. The power in the module can be used
dialog: but once. Use it wisely . . . my son.
dialog: 
text: The message whirrs slowly down and is finally drowned in static. For a moment the vessel glows then fades out. CLARK reaches under the "dashboard'. and carefully retrieves the module.
speaker_heading: 32	A WHIRLWIND
text: Small, but strong, starts to envelop CLARK as he climbs from the ship. His hair blows as the wind and dust increase in intensity.
speaker_heading: 33	OUTSIDE THE PIT
dialog: 
text: CLARK reaches the top as the whir1wind peaks and then, as quickly as it appeared, it's gone. All is silent and calm.
dialog: 34	THE BARN FLOOR
text: As the last of the dust settles' we see the pit has been filled in. CLARK, carefully crad1inq the module, stares, saying a final, silent farewell to his past, his childhood, his innocence.
dialog: 35	OUTSIDE THE BARN - A CAR HORN BLARES
dialog: CLARK quickly stashes the module under a tarp.
dialog: 36	THE BARN
text: A big OLDS is parked by the barn door. LEVON HORNSBY, a grey-haired banker, is about to enter the barn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HORNSBY
dialog: Clark! You in there?
dialog: CLARK pops out of the shadows.
dialog: CONTINUED
dialog: 36	CONTINUED
dialog: CLARK
dialog: Hello, Mr. Hornsby. It's been a
dialog: long time.
text: HORNSBY tries to peer over CLARK'S shoulder into barn. CLARK distracts him with a handshake.
speaker_heading: CLARK(Cont.)
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I've just been tidying up for when
dialog: you show the place.
speaker_heading: HORNSBY
dialog: (slyly)
dialog: Didn't I mention that there was an offer
dialog: to buy ... sight unseen?
dialog: CLARK
dialog: (politely)
dialog: I'm sorry, but I don't want to sell the farm to
dialog: a big developer. Whoever buys it has to want
dialog: to keep a working farm. I don't think we need
dialog: another shopping center.
dialog: HORNSBY frowns like he's heard it too many times.
speaker_heading: HORNSBY
dialog: Darn it, Clark Kent, why are you so stubborn? Today
dialog: nobody wants a farm. Blink your eye and they'll all be
dialog: gone. That's progress!
text: HORNSBY catches CLARK off-guard and the barn. strolls into the barn.
dialog: CLARK
dialog: (running after)
dialog: Mr. Hornsby!
dialog: 37	INSIDE THE BARN
speaker_heading: HORNSBY
dialog: (spotting something)
dialog: My, oh my! Look at this!
text: CLARK is relieved to see it's not the module, which barely protrudes from under the tarp but a baby's CRIB off to the side. Its wooden headboard has been cracked perfectly in two.
dialog: CONTINUED
dialog: 37	CONTINUED
speaker_heading: HORNSBY (Cont.)
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: What a joker old George Kent was.
dialog: (fingering the crack)
dialog: I asked your dad what happened to the
dialog: baby's crib.
dialog: (mimics)
dialog: "Oh, Clark must have kicked it."
dialog: CLARK
dialog: Dad liked a good joke.
text: HORNSBY indulges himself with a laugh. CLARK chuckles politely. But changes the subject. CLARK grabs an old mitt, a ball and a bat.
speaker_heading: CLARK (Cont.)
dialog: Maybe your grandchildren would like these,
dialog: Mr. Hornsby.
speaker_heading: HORNSBY
dialog: (taking them)
dialog: Hey, thanks, Clark.
dialog: CLARK ushers MR HORNSBY out of the barn.
dialog: 38	BACK OUTSIDE
dialog: HORNSBY rolls the ball in his hand.
speaker_heading: HORNSBY
dialog: Hey! Batter up!
text: He tosses CLARK the bat, then jogs several yards away. He makes a dramatic wind-up.
text: CLARK sights, then assumes a batter's position. HORNSBY throws. For a minute CLARK
dialog: looks like he'd love to take a mighty cut. Instead he misses completely.
speaker_heading: HORNSBY
dialog: (remembering)
dialog: Oh, yeah, you never could hit a
dialog: curve ball.
dialog: CLARK
dialog: (polite, but resolute)
dialog: I think I'll hold out for a real farmer, Mr.
dialog: Hornsby.
dialog: CONTINUED
dialog: 38	CONTINUED
speaker_heading: HORNSBY
dialog: (walking back)
dialog: . . . and you were just as obstinate as your
dialog: father.
text: CLARK walks HORNSBY back to his car. HOLDS the door for him.
speaker_heading: HORNSBY
dialog: (after he starts it up)
dialog: Be careful in that big City, Clark. You're a long,
dialog: long way from where you were born.
dialog: CLARK
dialog: I never forget that, Sir.
text: HORNSBY guns his car and disappears down the road. CLARK smiles and picks up the ball and bat. A naughty young boy's smile creeps over his face. He throws up the ball, takes an easy swing. CRACK! The ball sails endlessly way, way, up into the sky.
dialog: 39	A YOUNG CHILD
text: Swaddled in red and blue cloth is carried through a smoky hall. Explosions thunder outside.
speaker_heading: 40	CHILD'S P.O.V.
text: The VOICES are distorted, the noises terrifying. The child is placed lovingly into a cradle-like capsule. Around him, bright flashes of fire. A glass canopy is gently lowered.
dialog: 41	THE PLANET KRYPTON
text: Against the blackness of space. Silent for a moment. The planet erupts in fire. Exploding in a
dialog: hellish apocalypse. A streak of white escaping from the dying planet marks the child's rocket.
dialog: 42	INT. CLARK KENT'S APARTMENT MORNING
dialog: The ringing of the telephone blends with the roar of the dream.
dialog: 43	AN ANSWERING MACHINE
dialog: 
dialog: Clicks on. CLARK'S voice on the tape. He was clearly uncomfortable when he recorded the
dialog: message.
speaker_heading: CLARK (V.O.)
dialog: Uh, Hi, this is Clark ... Kent. Please leave a
dialog: message at the beep.
dialog: BEEP
dialog: 43	CONTINUED
speaker_heading: LOIS (V.O.)
dialog: Clark ... it's Lois. I hope you're up. Perry wants
dialog: us in the office on time. Something big is going
dialog: on. . . Au Revoir.
dialog: CLARK Jumps up and reaches for the phone.
dialog: CLARK
dialog: Hi, Lois. I'm up. Gee, I wonder what Perry's
dialog: got in mind ...
text: It takes a moment for CLARK to realise that he is talking to himself. LOIS has clicked off and all that's left is the dial tone.
dialog: CLARK
dialog: Oh well, bye Lois.
dialog: 44	BREAKFAST TABLE - MINUTES LATER
text: CLARK rushes to pour a bowl of Wheaties, but realises too late the milk has turned sour. Now he scrambles for his briefcase. The radio is on.
dialog: D.J. (V.O. )
dialog: And ... in the news, we have word that the East-West
dialog: arms control talks have broken down. The President
dialog: is scheduled to address the nation later ... and that is
dialog: the good news - just kidding ...
dialog: CLARK grabs his jacket, checks the time and flies out the door.
dialog: D.J. (Cont.)
dialog: ... so chin up, Metropolis! It's a typical Monday
dialog: morning ... !
dialog: 45	INT. SUBWAY STATION MORNING
dialog: CLARK patiently filing slowly follows a long line of commuters through the turnstiles.
dialog: 46	ON THE PLATFORM
text: A train has appeared. LOIS steps on board just as CLARK arrives on the platform. He calls
dialog: after her.
dialog: CLARK
dialog: Lois!
text: She turns just as the doors close behind her. She points to her watch and gives CLARK a 	disapproving look through the glass. The train pulls out, leaving CLARK.
speaker_heading: 47	CLOSE ON CLARK - X-RAY P.O.V.
text: CLARK squints slightly and follows the train into the tunnel, peering through the walls to see
dialog: 48	THE LEAD CAR
text: An elderly ENGINEER sits before computerised controls. Suddenly, he clutches his heart.
speaker_heading: ENGINEER
dialog: Oh, please. . .no. . .
dialog: He pitches forward unconscious. The train gathers speed.
dialog: 49	ON THE PASSENGER CARS
text: CLARK continues to scan with his X-RAY VISION. He sees LOIS, reading "FRENCH
dialog: PHRASES FOR TRAVELLERS", unmindful, as are the other passengers, of the impending
dialog: disaster.
dialog: 50	CLARK ON THE PLATFORM
text: Realising a disaster in the making, he moves out of sight and slips off his glasses. This is a job for ...
dialog: 51	SUPERMAN!
dialog: He's off in a flash.
scene_heading: 52	SUPERMAN'S P. O. V. - INTO THE TUNNEL
dialog: Skimming just above the tracks, Superman tries to overtake the train.
speaker_heading: 53	SIDE ANGLE
text: As SUPERMAN begins to fly past the cars, "startled PASSENGERS spot him out the window. The relative speed of the train makes SUPERMAN seem to move in slow motion. LOIS looks up from her reading just in time to see SUPERMAN fly by. She runs to the window.
dialog: Amendment No: 1 (pink)							Revised 05-Aug-86
dialog: 53	CONTINUED
dialog: LOIS
dialog: Superman!
text: He turns his head just long enough to acknowledge her with a half-smile. He speeds ahead to
text: meet the speeding subway. He stands calmly right in its path. The headlights grow larger and
text: larger, bearing down on SUPERMAN! He takes one step back and purposely kicks his foot
dialog: into the third rail!
speaker_heading: 54	CLOSE ON SUPERMAN
text: As an electric current roars through him. A blinding white-hot penumbra glows about him. He has become a human sun! Sparks shoot off like fireworks. The lights flash and go out. The electric current is shorted. One by one the green signal lights flash off. The out-of-control train is cut off from its energy source. In the ENGINEER'S booth the control lights flicker off. Inside the cars, the passengers stand in darkness as their train loses speed. Now SUPERMAN leaps behind the last car and, pulling gently, helps ease the train to a stop. In a flash, he's at the ENGINEER'S booth and flies the unconscious man onto the platform where a RESCUE SQUAD is just arriving.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: (to the MEN)
dialog: I'll take this man to the hospital.
dialog: As SUPERMAN leaves.
dialog: 55	LOIS IN WINDOW
dialog: LOIS
dialog: (waving)
dialog: Superman . . . thank you.
dialog: From the look on her face, we know it all. SUPERMAN is the only man in her life who's
dialog: super!
dialog: 56	EXT. QUARRY -DAY
dialog: A stone quarry - a white scar on the landscape.
dialog: 57	A PRISON CHAIN GANG
dialog: Knee-deep in ooze, they shovel out debris near a track into the quarry. Overseeing the forlorn
text: rednecks are TWO ~FEDERAL MARSHALS, toting rifles. A dumpy farm truck is parked on the shoulder.
dialog: Amendment No: 1 (pink)							Revised 05-Aug-86
dialog: 58	PAN DOWN THE LINE OF CONVICTS
text: Most are shirtless in the heat, dripping sweat. A sunburnt inmate with Elvis sideburns is wailing a country lament. Most of the other MEN hum along.
dialog: 59	AT THE END OF THE LINE
dialog: Suddenly we HEAR what sounds like classical music being whistled just loud enough to
dialog: bother a CHUBBY CON. The con turns to the last man on the chain.
dialog: CON
dialog: What is that god-awful noise you're makin'?
dialog: 60	THE LAST MAN ON THE CHAIN -- LEX LUTHOR !
text: The only man whose work clothes are still clean, still pressed, still fashionably accented with a tie. He merely leans on his shovel.
dialog: LEX
dialog: Mozart, my low-forehead friend. Even this
dialog: wretched pit can't diminish the spirit of true
dialog: genius ...I while you've been bending your
dialog: back in this foul slime, I've been inspired!
dialog: Life itself began in a murky pool much like
dialog: this. And a genius such as myself learns to
dialog: seize the moment. You are the first to know
dialog: that I now have a plan to recreate life itself!
text: LUTHOR expects awe. Instead, all he gets is a vacant stare as the CON squishes a huge
dialog: mosquito.
dialog: ONE DEPUTY
dialog: (splashes water at LEX)
dialog: You better be breakin' a sweat, Luthor, or we'll
dialog: feed you to the wolves!
dialog: 61	THE TALL MARSHAL

dialog: The sound of an engine makes the FAT MARSHAL jump to his feet.
dialog: 62.	A CADILLAC CONVERTIBLE
text: Driving down the middle of the track, screeches to a halt by the WORK CREW. Music blaring: from a: state-of-the-art wall-to-wall stereo system.
dialog: 63	OUT OF THE CAR - A TEENAGE KID
text: Reeking of snotty sarcasm and bratty insults. He's dressed in a careful distillation of the worst effects of punk and heavy metal. A Walkman permanently about his neck.
dialog: KID
dialog: (tapping the MARSHAL)
dialog: Yo pops, where the hell is this and
dialog: how do I get to Ft. Lauderdale?
text: The FAT MARSHAL shakes his head laughing and walks over to admire the CADILLAC and its sound system.
speaker_heading: FAT MARSHAL
dialog: Son, you're on the wrong side of the State.
dialog: (touching the CADILLAC)
dialog: You got yourself one heck of a sound there,
dialog: son.
dialog: The TALL MARSHAL has wandered over to investigate.
dialog: KID
dialog: I guess you yo-yo's have never seen

dialog: KID
dialog: (big, friendly smile
dialog: to the MARSHALS)
dialog: Go on, get in. Only way to hear it.
text: He opens the door to the CADDIE. The MARSHALS exchange naughty grins and slip inside. The FAT MARSHAL tweaks the controls and the music gets louder.
speaker_heading: FAT MARSHAL
dialog: Hot dog!
speaker_heading: TALL MARSHAL
dialog: Amen.
dialog: 64	ON THE KID
text: His smile disappears. He steps back. He slips his WALKMAN from around his neck.
dialog: 65	CLOSE ON THE WALKMAN
text: As the KID turns it over to REVEAL a REMOTE CONTROL UNIT. He quickly punches in
dialog: orders. . .
dialog: 66	ON THE CADILLAC
text: The top quickly closes down and locks. Startled, the TWO MARSHALS are frozen by
text: confusion. The car door locks click shut. Engine starts. Windows up. All in a flash.
speaker_heading: FAT MARSHAL
dialog: (yells through window)
dialog: What's going on?
dialog: The KID hits another button and ...
dialog: 67	THE CADILLAC ROARS OFF

scene_heading: 68	MARSHALS' P. O.V. - STRAIGHT AHEAD - OVER THE EDGE
dialog: A sheer drop to the quarry floor. The KID increases the speed and OVER THE EDGE INTO

dialog: LENNY
dialog: Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?

dialog: 72	INT. CITY ROOM - MORNING
text: The cavernous sprawl of desks and word processors. CLARK runs in and freezes. Every desk
dialog: is empty. Not a soul is stirring. Not even a copy boy.
speaker_heading: PERRY (O.S.)
dialog: You're late, Kent!
text: CLARK turns around in time to see PERRY WHITE march past the door. The editor-in-chief
dialog: stops just long enough to scowl at CLARK.
dialog: 73	DOWN THE HALLWAY
dialog: CLARK catches up with PERRY.
dialog: CLARK
dialog: Right, sir. I promise it won't happen
dialog: again.

dialog: 74	INTO THE CONFERENCE ROOM
dialog: CLARK
dialog: . . . everybody?

dialog: REPORTERS, EDITORS and STAFF are there.
dialog: 75	THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE - DAVID WARFIELD
text: Impeccably dressed with a folded pocket handkerchief, the aristocratic tycoon slips 	contemptuously through the morning edition of THE DAILY PLANET. Behind him are a
dialog: few unctuous CRONIES.
dialog: 76	A STYLISH YOUNG WOMAN
text: Sits on WARFIELD'S RIGHT. She's in her mid-20's with a natural beauty carefully moulded to fit VOGUE.

dialog: WARFIELD and PERRY WHITE are squared off like two frontier gamblers.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Don't tell me. You only read the pictures.
speaker_heading: WARFIELD
dialog: In fact, Mr. White, I only read the ledger.
dialog: A ledger which the previous owners paid
dialog: so little attention to that I was able to buy
dialog: the paper out from under them. The Daily

dialog: with me mock copies of our new layout.
text: She holds up a tabloid-sized paper with a giant headline screaming: 'SUMMIT KAPUT! IS
dialog: WORLD AT BRINK?' Underneath is a picture of a model in a bikini with her hands folded

speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: (points to WARFIELD)
dialog: Rash? There's the rash that infects world
dialog: journalism. If you think I'm going to let you

dialog: Miss Warfield, I think I speak for all of us when I say

dialog: even farther.
dialog: TEACHER
dialog: I know you're all upset by the crisis. The best thing

dialog: we can do?
dialog: ONE BOY
dialog: Yeah, let's hold class in a bomb shelter. Maybe some

dialog: Anyone else ...
text: JEREMY looks out the window to the blue sky. Then he stands up. Surprised at himself.

dialog: 92	CLOSE ON - A GLOBE OF THE EARTH
dialog: Made out of solid steel. Branded on it is its weight: lOOO lbs. It hangs suspended by a long
dialog: thin strand of what seems to be black wire, attached to a crossbeam. All protected by a glass
dialog: case.
dialog: GUIDE
dialog: (pointing it out)
dialog: Superman has graciously donated a strand of
dialog: His hair to the museum. So we all could have
dialog: the fun of seeing how strong he really is.
dialog: Here you can see a 1000-pound globe easily
dialog: suspended by his single hair.
dialog: Oohs and aahs from the GROUP.
dialog: GUIDE (Cont.)
dialog: Now let's move on to our primate exhibit.
dialog: 93	THE GROUP LEAVES
dialog: But not the 'father' and 'son.' Once the pitter patter of feet on the linoleum floor fades, the
text: 'father' takes off his hat and glasses. We see his bald pate. It's LEX LUTHOR. He saddles
dialog: right up to the statue.
dialog: LEX
dialog: (addressing the statue)
dialog: Guess who! . . . Of course it's me! Your old buddy!
dialog: Lex Luthor . . . Hey, you don't look too bad yourself.
dialog: 'Course I've put on a few pounds, but what the hey!
dialog: They feed you a lot of starch when you've in prison.
dialog: (his Jokey tone becomes

speaker_heading: 94	ON LENNY
text: He's standing by the glass case containing SUPERMAN'S hair. He slips an iron MALLET

dialog: LEX
dialog: (to LENNY)
dialog: Do you realize what I can create with a single

dialog: LENNY
dialog: (thinking hard)
dialog: A toupee that flies?
dialog: LEX
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: . . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans
dialog: felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
dialog: LENNY
dialog: But why the hair?
dialog: LEX
dialog: (gazes into the case)
dialog: That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic
dialog: material. The building blocks of his body. With
dialog: my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate
dialog: those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . .
dialog: but with absolute allegiance to me!
text: LEX nods at LENNY. LENNY raises the iron mallet above the case. CRASH. Alarms
text: SOUND all over the museum. As LEX reaches for the hair, LENNY lights several SMOKE BOMBS and tosses them down the wind. In moments the SMOKE begins to bellow, creating a shroud around LEX and LENNY.
