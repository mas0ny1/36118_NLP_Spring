scene_heading: EXT. VALLEY -- DAY
dialog: 
text: A MYSTERIOUS WARRIOR treks across the rugged landscape.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Legend tells of a legendary warrior
dialog: whose Kung Fu skills were the stuff
dialog: of legend.
dialog: 
text: The warrior, his identity hidden beneath his flowing robe and
text: wide-brimmed hat, gnaws on a staff of bamboo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: He traveled the land in search of
dialog: worthy foes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BAR
dialog: 
text: The warrior sits at a table drinking tea and gnawing on his
text: bamboo. The door BLASTS open. The MANCHU GANG rushes in and
text: surrounds him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GANG BOSS
dialog: (to warrior)
dialog: I see you like to CHEW!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Maybe you should chew on my FIST!!
dialog: 
text: The Boss punches the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: The warrior said nothing for his
text: mouth was full. Then, he swallowed.
dialog: 
text: He swallows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And then, he spoke.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WARRIOR
dialog: (dubbed hero voice)
dialog: Enough talk. Let's FIGHT!
text: SHASHABOOEY!
dialog: 
text: WHAM! The warrior delivers a punch and the whole gang goes
dialog: flying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: He was so deadly in fact that his
dialog: enemies would go blind from
dialog: overexposure to pure awesomeness.
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The gang members blindly flail about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINJA CAT
dialog: MY EYES!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATOR
dialog: HE'S TOO AWESOME!
dialog: 
text: ONLOOKERS swoon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SMITTEN BUNNY
dialog: And ATTRACTIVE!
dialog: 
scene_heading: GRATEFUL BUNNY
dialog: How can we repay you??
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WARRIOR
dialog: There is no charge for awesomeness,
dialog: or attractiveness.
dialog: 
text: ONE HUNDRED ASSASSINS appear and surround the warrior.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The entire bar swells, packed to the rafters with ninjas.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WARRIOR
speaker_heading: KABLOOEY!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The roof EXPLODES and a cloud of ninjas erupts into the sky.
text: Like a tornado, the warrior spins and knocks them all down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: It mattered not how many foes he
dialog: faced. They were no match for his
dialog: bodacity.
dialog: 
text: The warrior beats up a thousand ninjas, delivering his final
text: blow while doing a split between two trees.
dialog: 
text: The warrior stands amongst a field of vanquished foes as god-
text: rays shine down upon him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Never before had a panda been so
dialog: feared... and so loved.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Even the most heroic heroes in all
dialog: of China, the Furious Five, bowed
dialog: in respect to this great master.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONKEY
dialog: We should hang out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WARRIOR
dialog: Agreed.
dialog: 
text: As the Five salute the warrior, he turns to see more bandits
text: approaching. The Five strike an attack pose. The warrior
text: brandishes a shiny green sword and leaps off the mountain
text: into the sea of bandits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: But hanging out would have to wait.
dialog: `Cause when you're facing the ten
dialog: thousand demons of Demon Mountain,
dialog: there's only one thing that
dialog: matters. And that's--
dialog: 
text: In mid air, the Five talk to the warrior in a strange voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONKEY
dialog: Po! Get up!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIGRESS
dialog: You'll be late for work!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Whu?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PO'S ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Po lands hard on the floor. He tries to clear his head and
dialog: wake up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD (O.S.)
dialog: Po! Get up!
dialog: 
text: We see his room is filled with various kung fu posters
text: (including a poster featuring all of the Five) and souvenirs,
text: and a wooden version of the Sword of Heroes (the green
dialog: sword).
dialog: 
speaker_heading: Po SIGHS.
dialog: 
text: He attempts to kick himself to his feet but alas, his belly
dialog: is too worthy a foe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Po! What are you doing up there?
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Uh, nothing!
dialog: 
text: Po hops to his feet, imitating his Kung Fu action figures.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper!
dialog: Tigress! Rowrrrr...
dialog: 
text: OUTSIDE on the balcony of the neighboring house, a pig
text: watering flowers stares at Po. Po tries to play it cool and
text: then quickly ducks out of sight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD (O.S.)
dialog: Po! Let's go! You're late for work!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Coming!
dialog: 
text: He takes a ninja star from his floor and chucks it at the
text: wall. It bounces off.
dialog: 
text: He throws the star again, but it bounces off again. He picks
text: it up and heads downstairs. He trips and falls the rest of
dialog: the way.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: Po falls flat on his face on the kitchen floor. A panda-
text: shaped shadow looms over Po.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Sorry, Dad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: Sorry doesn't make the noodles.
dialog: 
text: Reveal that the shadow is actually caused by a basket being
text: carried by a small DUCK. This is PO'S DAD. Po gets to work,
dialog: which is not easy since the kitchen's not really made for a
text: panda his size.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: What were you doing up there? All
dialog: that noise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Oh, nothing. Just had a crazy
dialog: dream.
dialog: 
text: He gets back to work.
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: About what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: The dream. What were you dreaming
dialog: about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: What was I... eh, I was dreaming
dialog: about uh... heh...
dialog: 
text: Push in on Po -- is he going to admit his dream? He hides his
text: throwing star behind his back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: Noodles.
dialog: 
text: THOK. Dad stops chopping vegetables.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: Noodles. You were really dreaming
dialog: about noodles?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Uh, yeah. What else would I be
dialog: dreaming about?
dialog: 
text: Po hands a noodle bowl to a customer, then realizes his
text: throwing star is sitting in it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: (to customer)
dialog: Careful, that soup is... sharp!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: Oh, happy day! My son, finally
dialog: having the noodle dream!
dialog: 
text: He throws his arms around Po.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't know how long I have been
dialog: waiting for this moment.
dialog: 
text: When Dad pulls out of the hug, Po is now wearing a noodle
dialog: apron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: This is a sign, Po!
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Po looks at the apron nervously -- what has he gotten himself
dialog: into?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Uh...a sign of what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: You are almost ready to be
dialog: entrusted with the secret
dialog: ingredient of my "Secret Ingredient
dialog: Soup." And then you will fulfill
dialog: your destiny and take over the
dialog: restaurant, just as I took it over
dialog: from my father, who took it over
dialog: from his father, who won it from a
text: friend in a game of mahjong.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Dad Dad Dad, it was just a dream.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: No, it was the dream. We are noodle
dialog: folk. Broth runs through our veins.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: But Dad, didn't you ever, I dunno,
dialog: want to do something else?
dialog: Something besides noodles?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: Actually...
dialog: 
text: Po looks surprised.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: When I was young and crazy...
dialog: 
text: Dad gets a wistful look in his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought about running away and
dialog: learning how to make tofu.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: So why didn't you?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: Oh, because it was a stupid dream.
dialog: Can you imagine, me making tofu?
dialog: (laughs at the thought)
dialog: No. We all have our place in this
dialog: world. Mine is here. And yours is--
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: I know. Is here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: No, it's at tables two, five,
dialog: seven, and twelve.
dialog: 
text: He loads Po's arms with bowls of soup.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: Service with a smile!
dialog: 
text: A GONG sounds in the distance. Po looks out the window at the
text: distant JADE PALACE.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. JADE PALACE - DAY
dialog: 
text: SLAM ZOOM in towards Palace.
dialog: 
text: End next to palace on an old red panda (SHIFU) playing a
text: FLUTE. He is surrounded by the bushes and trees that nestle
text: between the Palace buildings.
dialog: 
text: Wider: We dolly around from behind the bushes. Stealthy dark
text: shapes move in the foreground.
dialog: 
text: Back on Shifu, still playing. He seems oblivious.
dialog: 
text: Five figures explode from the undergrowth simultaneously,
text: diving on Shifu.
dialog: 
text: Shifu moves like lightning - the flute now wielded like a
text: staff - he deflects, blocks, dodges, parries - the attackers
dialog: go flying -
dialog: 
text: They roll and pick themselves up, turning to face Shifu, who
text: is now standing - poised - ready for their next move.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: Well done, students... if you were
dialog: trying to disappoint me.
dialog: 
text: He uses his flute to correct the Five's technique.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU (CONT'D)
dialog: Tigress, you need more ferocity.
dialog: Monkey, greater speed.
dialog: 
text: Each of the Five bows respectfully as their name is
dialog: mentioned.
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU (CONT'D)
dialog: Crane - height. Viper - subtlety.
dialog: Mantis--
dialog: 
text: Shifu suddenly points the flute at a scared PALACE GOOSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZENG
dialog: Master Shifu!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: What?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZENG
dialog: (startled)
dialog: Aah! It's Master Oogway. He wants
dialog: to see you.
dialog: 
text: Shifu looks up, concerned.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: Shifu strides purposefully down the hallway, which is lined
dialog: with palace geese.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SCROLL ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Candles, incense, and smoke fill the room. The door bursts
text: open, the candles flicker. Shifu enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: Master Oogway? You summoned me.
dialog: 
text: He bows. Then looks up without unbowing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU (CONT'D)
dialog: Is something wrong?
dialog: 
dialog: Reveal Master Oogway... a wise, old tortoise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OOGWAY
dialog: Why must something be wrong for me
dialog: to want to see my old friend?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: So... nothing's wrong?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OOGWAY
dialog: Well, I didn't say that.
dialog: 
text: Shifu looks up, concerned. Oogway opens his mouth... and
text: blows out a candle. And another candle. And another.
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Finally, Shifu uses his Kung Fu to blow them all out. Oogway
text: smiles knowingly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: You were saying?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OOGWAY
dialog: I have had a vision... Tai Lung
dialog: will return.
dialog: 
text: Shifu looks stricken.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: FLASHBACK - INT. SCROLL ROOM
dialog: 
text: Quick, impressionistic images of Shifu battling a large,
text: shadowy figure (Tai Lung).
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: PRESENT - INT. SCROLL ROOM
dialog: 
text: Shifu is rattled. He looks at the claw marks that still scar
text: the wall and quickly looks away. But he regains his
text: composure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: That is impossible. He is in
dialog: prison.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OOGWAY
dialog: Nothing is impossible.
dialog: 
text: Shifu makes a split decision.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: Zeng!
dialog: 
text: He comes flying in. Shifu gets in his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU (CONT'D)
dialog: Fly to Chogun Prison and tell them
dialog: to double the guards, double their
dialog: weapons. Double everything! Tai
dialog: Lung does not leave that prison!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZENG
dialog: Yes, Master Shifu.
dialog: 
text: The goose flies off, but... SMACK! He hits a column. Then he
text: is off. Back on Oogway, as he walks toward camera, away from
dialog: Shifu.
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OOGWAY
dialog: One often meets his destiny on the
text: road he takes to avoid it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: We have to do something. We can't
dialog: just let him march on the valley,
dialog: and take his revenge! He'll, he'll--
dialog: 
text: Oogway looks into the water of the moon pool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OOGWAY
dialog: Your mind is like this water, my
text: friend. When it is agitated, it
text: becomes difficult to see. But if
dialog: you allow it to settle, the answer
text: becomes clear.
dialog: 
text: Shifu and Oogway stare into the pool. Oogway settles the
text: water, revealing the reflection of an intricately carved
text: dragon clutching a SCROLL in its mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: The Dragon Scroll...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OOGWAY
dialog: It is time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: But who? Who is worthy to be
dialog: trusted with the secret to
dialog: limitless power? To become...the
dialog: Dragon Warrior?!
dialog: 
text: Dramatic music as we push in on Oogway's face. Then...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OOGWAY
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NOODLE SHOP - DAY
dialog: 
text: Po is serving customers, but has trouble squeezing between
dialog: tables.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Oop...sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGRY PATRON
dialog: Hey! Watch it, Po!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Sorry. Suck it up.
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He sucks his belly in, but this causes his butt to interfere
text: with a bunny family's meal.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DISGUSTED PATRON
dialog: Ugh!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Oop! Sorry! A thousand pardons.
dialog: 
text: A couple palace geese put up a poster on the wall and a
text: palace pig hits a tiny gong. This gets Po's attention. He
text: rushes up to the poster.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: What?! Master Oogway's choosing the
dialog: Dragon Warrior! Today!
dialog: 
text: Customers jump up excitedly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: Everyone! Everyone! Go! Get to the
dialog: Jade Palace!
dialog: 
text: Po urges the villagers out the restaurant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: One of the Five is gonna get the
dialog: Dragon Scroll!
dialog: 
text: Customers rush to finish their food.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: We've been waiting a thousand years
dialog: for this! Just take the bowl!
dialog: 
text: Other customers are finishing their soup.
dialog: 
text: One old lady customer slowly counts out coins and puts them
text: on the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: This is the greatest day in Kung Fu
dialog: history! Don't worry about it, just
dialog: go!
dialog: 
text: He starts to run.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: Po! Where are you going?
dialog: 
text: Po stops dead in his tracks, busted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: To the...Jade Palace?
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: But you're forgetting your noodle
dialog: cart! The whole valley will be
dialog: there, and you'll sell noodles to
text: all of them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Selling noodles? But Dad, you know,
dialog: I was kinda thinking maybe I...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: I was kinda thinking maybe I...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: Uh huh?
dialog: 
text: Po wants to say something to his dad, but he loses his nerve.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: ...Could also sell the bean buns.
text: They are about to go bad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: That's my boy! I told you that
dialog: dream was a sign!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Yeah, ha ha, glad I had it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VALLEY SQUARE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Throngs of Villagers are streaming into the arena. A couple
text: BUNNY KIDS run by.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUNNY FAN #1
dialog: Yippee!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUNNY FAN #2
dialog: I'm a Kung Fu warrior!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUNNY FAN #1
dialog: Me too!
dialog: 
dialog: Where's Po?
dialog: 
text: PAN DOWN a long, long, long, long flight of stairs. Po stands
text: at the bottom with his noodle cart, looking up at the
text: daunting task before him.
dialog: 
text: Po struggles to pull his noodle cart up the stairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The sun beats down on Po, but he presses forward. Climbing.
text: Climbing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VALLEY SQUARE - LATER
dialog: 
text: Po is still struggling up the stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Come on! Come on, ya-- Almost
dialog: there...
dialog: 
text: He stops, flopping onto his back to catch his breath.
dialog: 
text: WIDEN TO REVEAL he's only made it up seven steps.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: What? No! Oh No!
dialog: 
text: Two Pigs pass by.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KG SHAW
dialog: Sorry, Po.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JR SHAW
dialog: We'll bring you back a souvenir.
dialog: 
text: Po watches as they run up the stairs. His eyes narrow. This
text: is his heroic moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.
dialog: 
text: Po tosses off his hat and apron and begins his ascent up the
dialog: stairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. JADE PALACE - ARENA PLATFORM
dialog: 
text: Oogway reaches the bottom of the palace stairs and a Palace
text: Pig bangs a gong.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: It is an historic day, isn't it,
dialog: Master Oogway?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OOGWAY
dialog: Yes, and one I feared I would not
dialog: live to see. Are your students
dialog: ready?
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: Yes, Master Oogway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OOGWAY
dialog: Now know this, old friend. Whomever
dialog: I choose will not only bring peace
dialog: to the Valley, but also to you.
dialog: 
text: As Shifu contemplates what this could mean, Oogway starts
text: walking off. Shifu quickly joins Oogway as they head towards
text: the roaring crowd below. The pig bangs the gong.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: Let the tournament begin!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VALLEY SQUARE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Throngs of Villagers are streaming into the arena.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF STAIRS - DAY
dialog: 
text: Po gasps for air as he hoists himself over the last step,
text: laughing victoriously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: (out of breath)
dialog: Yeah!
dialog: 
text: The doors to the palace arena begin to close.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh no! No no no! Wait! I'm coming!
dialog: 
text: Po runs to the entrance and proceeds to bang on the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey! Open the door!
dialog: 
text: DRUMS inside drown out Po's pounding. He yells.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me in!
dialog: 
text: Inside, spectators' screams drown out Po's yelling.
dialog: 
text: Po panics for a beat and then finds a window. He jumps and
text: weakly struggles to pull himself up.
dialog: 
text: Po struggles to peek through the window.
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PALACE ARENA - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: Citizens of the Valley of Peace! It
dialog: is my great honor to present to
dialog: you... Tigress! Viper! Crane!
dialog: Monkey! Mantis! The Furious Five!
dialog: 
text: The Five jump into the middle of the ring.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: The Furious Five!
dialog: 
text: Po manages a brief glimpse of the Five before a gust of wind
text: knocks Po to the ground and shuts the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: Warriors prepare!
dialog: 
text: Po runs over to a crack in the wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Peeky-hole!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: Ready for battle!
dialog: 
text: Inside the arena, Po catches a glimpse of Crane as he spreads
dialog: his wings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Yeah! Woo! The Thousand Tongues of
dialog: Fire!
dialog: 
text: One of the spectators walks in front of Po, cutting off his
dialog: view.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIG FAN
dialog: Whoa! Look at that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Hey, get out of the way!
dialog: 
text: Po backs up to get a better look at Crane in the sky and
text: accidentally falls down the stairs.
dialog: 
text: Po climbs back up and drops his head -- he missed it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONTAGE:
dialog: 
text: Po tries karate chopping the door open...to no avail. He
text: slumps to the ground.
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: Ow...
dialog: 
text: Po attempts a pole vault, but falls on his back. The pole
text: whips around and hits him into the arena wall.
dialog: 
text: Po rigs a catapult, only to get clobbered by it. The crowd
speaker_heading: CHEERS.
dialog: 
text: Po sits atop the stairs. Alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: And finally...Master Tigress!
dialog: 
text: Po snaps to attention.
dialog: 
text: Po pulls on a rope tied to a tree.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And believe me citizens, you have
dialog: not seen anything yet!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: I KNOW!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU (O.S.)
dialog: Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox and
dialog: his Blades of Death!
dialog:

speaker_heading: PO

speaker_heading: SHIFU (CONT'D)
dialog: Master Oogway, wait! That flabby

dialog: 
text: A squad of burly pigs rushes in and hoists Po, the palanquin,

speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: Illusion?

speaker_heading: OOGWAY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU (CONT'D)
dialog: And I can control--
dialog: 
text: Shifu punches the ground, creating a hole and places the seed

dialog: 
speaker_heading: OOGWAY
dialog: Ah, yes. But no matter what you do,
dialog: that seed will grow to be a peach

dialog: peach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OOGWAY

text: Tai Lung appears at the other end of the bridge. He ROARS and
text: races toward them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIGRESS
dialog: Cut it!
dialog: 
text: The others slash at the ropes securing the bridge to the
text: mountain. Tai Lung is almost upon them when Tigress cuts the
text: final rope. But Tai Lung is too close -- Tigress must launch
text: herself into him. The two cats end up in the middle of the
text: bridge just as it starts to tumble into the canyon below. The
text: Five grab support ropes and hold on for dear life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
dialog: Where's the Dragon Warrior?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIGRESS
dialog: How do you know you're not looking
dialog: at her?
dialog: 
text: Tai Lung laughs. It echoes off the mountain walls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
dialog: You think I'm a fool? I know you're
dialog: not the Dragon Warrior. None of
dialog: you!
dialog: 
text: The Five exchange quick, worried looks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: (nodding confidently)
dialog: I heard how he fell out of the sky
text: on a ball of fire, that he's a
dialog: warrior unlike anything the world
dialog: has ever seen.
dialog: 
text: The Five exchange quick, confused looks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONKEY
dialog: Po?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
dialog: So that is his name -- Po. Finally,
dialog: a worthy opponent. Our battle will
dialog: be legendary!
dialog: 
text: Tigress charges at him. The battle begins. Tigress punches
text: Tai Lung as he hangs from the bridge. But Tai Lung counters
text: with a maneuver that sends Tigress slamming backwards through
text: the bridge's wooden slats. Then Tigress gets choked by the
text: bridge's ropes. Monkey turns to Crane and Viper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONKEY
dialog: We've got this. Help her!
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Viper grabs Tai Lung, which causes him to let go of the
text: ropes. Tigress plummets down into the gorge... but Crane
text: manages to catch her. Viper punches Tai Lung repeatedly with
text: his own fist. Tai Lung manages to get a paw around Viper's
dialog: "throat".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIPER
dialog: Monkey!
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON MANTIS AND MONKEY. Mantis is straining to hold the
text: rope by himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANTIS
dialog: Go!
dialog: (then)
dialog: Ack! What was I thinking?!
dialog: 
text: Monkey leaps into action, kicking Tai Lung in the chest and
text: sending him crashing through the slats of the bridge. He gets
text: back to his feet and starts running back to them on a single
text: strand of rope.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIGRESS
dialog: Mantis!
dialog: 
text: Mantis whips his end of the rope, sending a sine wave
text: shooting toward Tai Lung. The rope whips Tai Lung in the face
text: and he gets tangled up. The Five see their chance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIGRESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Now!
dialog: 
text: Working as a team, the Five kick Tai Lung's butt every which
text: way. Tigress finally slashes the last rope holding up Tai
text: Lung. He plummets down... down... disappearing into the mist.
text: Mantis whips his end of the rope, returning his buddies
text: safely to the mountain.
dialog: 
text: The Five look relieved. But the relief is short-lived...
dialog: 
text: Tigress notices that the other end of the bridge is circling
text: the far mountain peak. Her eyes go wide with dread. The rope
text: whips up. But Tai Lung isn't there.
dialog: 
text: With a crash, he suddenly appears behind the Five.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
dialog: Shifu taught you well...
dialog: 
text: Tai Lung jabs a finger at Monkey, who instantly freezes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: But he didn't teach you everything.
dialog: 
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Tai lung lunges toward the rest.

scene_heading: EXT. TRAINING HALL - EVENING
dialog:

text: easy spring in his step.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: You have done well, Panda.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Done well? Done well?! I've done
dialog: awesome!
dialog: 
text: He swings his belly around and knocks Shifu off balance.
dialog: 
text: Shifu staggers back, regaining his dignity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: The mark of a true hero is
dialog: humility!
dialog: 
text: After a moment's thought, though, he leans toward Po -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU (CONT'D)
dialog: But yes...you have done awesome.
dialog: 
text: And he punches him playfully on the arm. Po smiles at him. As
text: they LAUGH, an indistinct figure appears in the clouds behind
dialog: them. IT'S CRANE!
dialog: 
text: Crane carries the five to the palace grounds, crashing in a
dialog: heap.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Huh? Guys? Guys!
dialog: 
text: Po throws his backpack aside and runs over to them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: They're dead? No, they're
dialog: breathing! They're asleep?! No,
text: their eyes are open.
dialog: 
text: Crane struggles to lift his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRANE
dialog: We were no match for his nerve
dialog: attack.
dialog: 
text: His head collapses to the ground.
dialog: 
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
text: He has gotten stronger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?
dialog: 
text: Shifu starts freeing the Five. First Viper, then Mantis, then
text: Monkey releases suddenly from his paralysis -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONKEY
dialog: He's too fast!
dialog: 
text: He delivers a Kung Fu punch to Po's head and then slowly
text: realizes where he is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONKEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry, Po.
dialog: 
text: Shifu kneels before Tigress and works to free her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIGRESS
dialog: I thought we could stop him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: He could have killed you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANTIS
dialog: Why didn't he?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: So you could come back here and
dialog: strike fear into our hearts. But it
dialog: won't work!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Uh, it might, I mean, a little. I'm
dialog: pretty scared.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: You can defeat him, panda.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Are you kidding? If they can't--
dialog: They're five masters. I'm just one
dialog: me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: But you will have the one thing
dialog: that no one else does.

scene_heading: INT. SCROLL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: CLOSE-UP of the Dragon Scroll. Po stares at Shifu - then
text: looks up at the Scroll. Then back at Shifu -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: You really believe I'm ready?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: You are, Po.
dialog: 
text: They look at each other. This is a big moment.
dialog: 
text: Oogway's staff hangs in a rack surrounded by candles. As Po
text: and The Five stand by, Shifu carries the staff over to the
text: reflecting pool. Shifu bows his head, then, eyes still
text: closed, he raises the staff up above his head. Po and the
text: others watch, expectantly. The peach blossom petals rise in a
text: flickering, spinning cloud up from the pool. The gentle
text: tornado rises up around the ceiling carving that holds the
text: Dragon Scroll. The petals loosen the scroll from the dragon's
text: mouth and it falls. At the last second, Shifu reaches out
text: with the staff to catch the scroll on the end of it. He turns
text: to Po, holding it out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU (CONT'D)
dialog: Behold. The Dragon Scroll... It is
dialog: yours.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Wait, what happens when I read it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: No one knows, but legend says you
dialog: will be able to hear a butterfly's
dialog: wing-beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Whoa! Really? That's cool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: Yes. And see light in the deepest
dialog: cave. You will feel the universe in

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Wow! Can I punch through walls?
dialog: Can I do a quadruple back flip?
dialog: Will I have invisibility--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: Focus. Focus.
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Huh? Oh, yeah... yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: Read it, Po, and fulfill your
dialog: destiny. Read it and become... the
dialog: Dragon Warrior!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Whooaa!!!
dialog: 
text: Po takes a deep breath. Then he grasps the tube and tries to
text: pull the top off it. It doesn't budge. He strains at it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: It's impossible to open.
dialog: 
text: He strains again. He tries to bite it off...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on baby. Come on now...
dialog: 
text: Shifu SIGHS and holds out his hand. Po passes him the tube.
text: Shifu pops the end off effortlessly and passes it back to Po.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you. I probably loosened it
dialog: up for you though... Okay, here
dialog: goes.
dialog: 
text: He glances at the Five. They look on in awe. Monkey gives him
text: the `thumbs up.' Po starts to unroll the scroll, the golden
text: light bathing his face. Across the scroll we see Shifu,
text: excited that he is witness to history...
dialog: 
text: On Po's face as he finishes opening the scroll.
dialog: 
dialog: Then -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
dialog: 
text: Shifu looks concerned. The Five look concerned. Po looks
text: utterly terrified.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: It's blank!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Here! Look!
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Po tries to show Shifu the scroll. Shifu covers his eyes and
text: turns his head away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: No! I am forbidden to look upon--
dialog: 
text: But he can't help himself. He takes a peek. Then he GRABS if
text: off Po. He turns it around, then upside down. He closes it
text: and opens it again, astonished.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU (CONT'D)
dialog: Blank? I don't...I don't
dialog: understand.
dialog: 
text: Shifu turns away, contemplative. What can this mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Okay. So like, Oogway was just a
dialog: crazy old turtle after all?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: No. Oogway was wiser than us all.
dialog: 
text: Po sits heavily on the floor, dejected.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Oh, come on! Face it. He picked me
dialog: by accident. Of course I'm not the
dialog: Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding?
dialog: 
text: The Five don't argue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIGRESS
dialog: But who will stop Tai Lung?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRANE
dialog: He'll destroy everything...and
dialog: everyone.
dialog: 
text: Shifu puts the scroll back in its container and seals it. He
text: looks oddly calm as he turns around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: No, evacuate the Valley. You must
dialog: protect the villagers from Tai
text: Lung's rage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIGRESS
dialog: What about you master?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: I will fight him.
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: I can hold him off long enough for
text: everyone to escape.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: But Shifu, he'll kill you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: Then I will finally have paid for
dialog: my mistake.
dialog: 
text: The Five and Po look devastated.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen to me, all of you. It is
dialog: time for you to continue your
dialog: journey without me. I am very proud
dialog: to have been your master.
dialog: 
text: Shifu salutes them and turns away. Po is heartbroken. Crane
text: steps forward and kindly puts a wing around Po, pulling away.

speaker_heading: TIGRESS

speaker_heading: JR SHAW
dialog: (skeptically)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Hey, Dad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: Po!
dialog: 
text: Seeing Po, Po's Dad hurries over and wraps his arms around
text: his son. Po bends down to reciprocate the hug, as Po's dad
text: pulls away, having fastened an apron around Po's waist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: Good to have you back, son!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: (listlessly)
dialog: Good to be back.
dialog: 
text: Po's Dad goes back to packing things up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: Let's go Po. So, for our next shop,
dialog: it's time to face it -- the future
text: of noodles is dice-cut vegetables,
text: no longer slices.
dialog: 
text: Dad starts to walk off, unaware that Po isn't following.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: Also, I was thinking, maybe this
dialog: time we'll have a kitchen you can
dialog: actually stand up in. Hmm? You like
dialog: that?
dialog: 
text: He turns and notices that Po hasn't moved. He walks to Po
text: sympathetically.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: Po, I'm sorry things didn't work
dialog: out. It just... wasn't meant to be.
dialog: 
text: Po slumps against the cart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: Po, forget everything else. Your
text: destiny still awaits. We are noodle
dialog: folk -- broth runs deep through our
dialog: veins.
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: I don't know, Dad. Honestly,
dialog: sometimes I can't believe I'm
dialog: actually your son.
dialog: 
text: Dad is taken aback.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: Po, I think it's time I told you
dialog: something I should have told you a
dialog: long time ago...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
text: Dad pauses dramatically.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: The secret ingredient of my secret
dialog: ingredient soup!
dialog: 
text: Po feigns excitement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Oh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: C'mere! The secret ingredient is...
dialog: nothing!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: You heard me. Nothing. There is no
dialog: secret ingredient!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Wait wait...it's just plain old
dialog: noodle soup? You don't add some
dialog: kind of special sauce or something?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: Don't have to. To make something
dialog: special, you just have to believe
dialog: it's special.
dialog: 
text: Po looks at his father with dawning realization. He picks up
dialog: the Scroll.
dialog: 
text: For a moment, Po stares at his reflection on the scroll, then
text: he smiles serenely. He gets it now.
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: There is no secret ingredient...
dialog: 
text: Po turns back to look at the palace.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. JADE PALACE - DAWN
dialog: 
text: At the top of the stairs, Shifu looks upon the Valley,
text: awaiting his fate. With a gust of wind, Tai Lung appears
text: before him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
dialog: I have come home, Master.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: This is no longer your home. And I
dialog: am no longer your master.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
dialog: Yes. You have a new favorite. So
dialog: where is this...Po? Did I scare him
dialog: off?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: This battle is between you and me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
dialog: So. That is how it's going to be?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: That is how it must be.
dialog: 
text: They fight. At last. Tai Lung punches Shifu clean through the
text: doors of the Jade Palace.
dialog: 
text: Tai Lung enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
dialog: I rotted in jail for twenty years
dialog: because of your weakness!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: Obeying your master is not
dialog: weakness!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
dialog: You knew I was the Dragon Warrior!
dialog: You always knew...
dialog: 
text: Dissolve to FLASHBACK.
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A young Tai Lung looks expectant. Oogway shakes his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: But when Oogway said otherwise,
dialog: what did you do? What did you do?!
dialog: 
text: Tai Lung looks to Shifu who averts his eyes and the past
text: dissolves into the present.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: NOTHING!
dialog: 
text: Shifu takes a Kung Fu stance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: You were not meant to be the Dragon
dialog: Warrior! That was not my fault!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
dialog: NOT YOUR FAULT?!
dialog: 
text: Enraged, Tai Lung knocks over the Kung Fu artifacts and
text: throws them at Shifu.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
text: WHO FILLED MY HEAD WITH DREAMS?!
text: WHO DROVE ME TO TRAIN UNTIL MY
text: BONES CRACKED?! WHO DENIED ME MY
dialog: DESTINY?!
dialog: 
text: Shifu dodges each attack.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: It was never my decision to make!
dialog: 
text: Tai Lung pulls Oogway's staff from the shrine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
dialog: It is now.
dialog: 
text: They fight. Tai Lung pins Shifu down with the staff.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: Give me the scroll!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: I would rather die.
dialog: 
text: They struggle for a beat until finally, the staff splinters
text: into a hundred pieces. Shifu looks back at the pieces and a
text: flutter of peach tree petals fly by. Caught off guard, Shifu
text: gets kicked by Tai Lung into a column.
dialog: 
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Shifu climbs the column to the rafters. Tai Lung follows and
text: sends them both crashing through the roof.
dialog: 
text: Lightning flash.
dialog: 
text: Grappling in mid-air, Tai Lung gets his hands around Shifu's
text: throat as they crash back through the roof.
dialog: 
text: They kick apart. Shifu crashes to the floor and lands hard.
text: Tai Lung bounces off the wall and throws a lantern to the
text: floor. Flames go everywhere. Tai Lung's arms are aflame as he
dialog: charges at Shifu.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
dialog: All I ever did, I did to make you
dialog: proud! Tell me how proud you are,
dialog: Shifu! Tell me! TELL ME!
dialog: 
text: THOOM! A fiery punch sends Shifu skidding across the floor
text: and crashing against the reflecting pool. The flames
text: extinguish and Tai Lung extends his claws.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: I have always been proud of you.
dialog: From the first moment, I've been
dialog: proud of you. And it was my pride
dialog: that blinded me. I loved you too
dialog: much to see what you were becoming.
dialog: What I was turning you into. I'm...
dialog: sorry.
dialog: 
text: Tai Lung stops in his tracks. Shifu waits. Tai Lung's
text: expression goes cold. He grabs Shifu by the throat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
dialog: I don't want your apology. I want
dialog: my scroll!
dialog: 
text: He holds Shifu up to the ceiling. Looking up, Tai Lung
text: bristles when he sees the scroll is missing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: WHAT? WHERE IS IT?!
dialog: 
text: Tai Lung slams Shifu to the floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: Dragon Warrior has taken scroll
dialog: halfway across China by now. You
dialog: will never see that scroll, Tai
dialog: Lung. Never. Never...
dialog: 
dialog: 77.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Tai Lung is furious. He roars, ready to strike Shifu.
dialog: Suddenly...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (O.S.)
dialog: Hey!
dialog: 
text: Tai Lung turns around to find Po standing in the doorway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: (out of breath)
dialog: Stairs...
dialog: 
text: Tai Lung casts Shifu aside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
dialog: Who are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.
dialog: (exhales hard)
dialog: Huhhh...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
dialog: You?! Him?!
dialog: (to Shifu)
dialog: He's a panda.
dialog: (back to Po)
dialog: You're a panda. What are you gonna
dialog: do, big guy? Sit on me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Don't tempt me. Haha. No. I'm gonna
dialog: use this. You want it? Come and get
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: Po shows him the Dragon Scroll.
dialog: 
text: From out of nowhere, Tai Lung appears and punches Po across
text: the room, grabbing the scroll knocked from Po's hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
dialog: Finally!
dialog: 
text: Po bounces off a nearby pillar and slams back into Tai Lung,
text: sending him flying into a column. Po puts on a brave face and
text: strikes a pose as Tai Lung recovers and charges. Po turns to
dialog: run.
dialog: 
text: Tai Lung quickly catches up and they both sail off the Palace
dialog: steps.
dialog: 
text: Po clings to the scroll as Tai Lung delivers a kick and sends
text: him crashing onto the theater rooftops below.
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Po rolls down off a tree and uses the recoil to whip back and
text: smash Tai Lung. He briefly skids across the rooftop and comes
dialog: right back at Po.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: That scroll is mine!
dialog: 
text: Down the Theater steps, Po and Tai Lung grapple for the
text: scroll. Po is oblivious to the effects of crashing down
text: stairs and in slow motion, his voluminous butt presses down
text: on Tai Lung's head. As they crash through the Gateway the
text: scroll is knocked loose. Tai Lung goes for the scroll but Po
text: snatches it away using a noodle lasso. The scroll flies
text: towards him and bounces off his head. Tai Lung leaps for it,
text: but Po grabs his tail and pulls him back down onto a cart
text: which see-saws Po into the air. In mid-air, Po slurps the
dialog: noodle.
dialog: 
text: Up and over the rooftops, Po lands in a grove of bamboo trees
text: and into a nearby wok shop. The scroll rolls to a stop in the
dialog: street.
dialog: 
text: As Tai Lung makes his move on the scroll, Po turns the array
text: of overturned woks into a shell game, sliding the woks around
dialog: to hide the scroll.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Lightning!
dialog: 
text: Tai Lung knocks the woks away and exposes the scroll as Po
text: uses his bamboo stilts to block Tai Lung. The leopard swipes
text: out the stilts and brings Po down on top of him as the scroll
text: rolls down the steps towards the river.
dialog: 
text: Po gets thrown into a fireworks booth. As Tai Lung chases
text: down the scroll, he turns back to see Po flying through the
text: fireworks-filled sky.
dialog: 
text: Po slams through Tai Lung and crashes into a rock wall. The
text: scroll flies out of his hand and lands in the mouth of an
text: ornamental rooftop dragon. He looks back at Tai Lung, who
text: sees where the scroll has landed. Via the magic of cookie-
text: vision, Po effortlessly scales the building. Tai Lung is
text: shocked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
dialog: The scroll has given him power.
dialog: (then)
dialog: NOOO0!!
dialog: 
text: He takes a giant leap and kicks the wall. The resulting
text: shockwave collapses the building.
dialog: 
dialog: 79.

dialog: 
text: Amazingly, Po skips across the falling roof tiles to reach
text: the scroll in mid-air as Tai Lung leaps up behind him and
text: unleashes a punishing blow that sends Po smashing into the
text: ground. As Tai Lung lands, he delivers a final devastating
dialog: punch.
dialog: 
text: As the dust settles, Tai Lung is looming over Po in the
dialog: impact crater.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: (out of breath)
dialog: Finally... oh yes... the power of
dialog: the Dragon Scroll... is mine!
dialog: 
text: Tai Lung grabs for the scroll and opens it. His face falls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: It's NOTHING!!
dialog: 
text: Po stirs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: It's okay. I didn't get it the
dialog: first time either.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
dialog: (disbelief)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: Po gets to his feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: There is no secret ingredient. It's
dialog: just you.
dialog: 
text: Tai Lung snarls and lunges at Po.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
speaker_heading: RRRAAAH!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
speaker_heading: AAAAGGGHH!
dialog: 
text: Tai Lung attacks Po's nerve points. But Po begins giggling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop! Stop it! I'm gonna pee!
dialog: Don't! Don't!
dialog: 
text: Tai Lung's nerve attack has no effect on Po. Frustrated, he
text: delivers a double-fisted punch to Po's belly.
dialog: 
dialog: 80.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The shockwave ripples through Po's entire body and Po's arms
text: come back and strike Tai Lung, sending the leopard crashing
text: back into a building. Po looks at his hands, amazed at what
dialog: he just did.
dialog: 
text: Tai Lung rises from the rubble and runs at Po again. But Po
text: strikes back, using an unorthodox panda-style technique, even
text: getting Tai Lung to chomp down on his own tail. Po gives Tai
text: Lung a butt bump that sends him crashing into a building. Tai
text: Lung emerges and attempts one more lunge at Po. But Po
text: prepares... and Tai Lung is swiftly met by Po's IRON BELLY!
text: He is launched into the air. Po waits... and waits... until
text: finally, Tai Lung appears in the sky and crashes to the
dialog: ground.
dialog: 
text: Tai Lung is battered, but still defiant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
dialog: (heavy breathing)
dialog: You... can't defeat me. You're just
dialog: a big, fat panda!
dialog: 
text: SCHWING! Po grabs Tai Lung's finger. Tai Lung's eyes go wide.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: I'm not a big, fat panda. I'm the
text: big, fat panda.
dialog: 
text: Po's pinky pops up. Tai Lung gasps.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
dialog: The Wuxi Finger Hold!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Oh, you know this hold?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAI LUNG
dialog: You're bluffing. You're bluffing!
dialog: Shifu didn't teach you that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Nope. I figured it out.
dialog: 
text: He flexes his pinky...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: Skadoosh!
dialog: 
scene_heading: KA-THOOM!
dialog: 
dialog: 81.

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VALLEY SQUARE - A LITTLE LATER
dialog: 
text: Villagers emerge from hiding. Po walks out from the mist
text: looking very much like the warrior from the opening dream.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KG SHAW
dialog: Look! The Dragon Warrior.
dialog: 
text: As he nears, we see that his hat is an upside down wok and
text: his scarf is a torn apron.
dialog: 
text: Villagers CHEER the Dragon Warrior. Po's Dad emerges from the
dialog: crowd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO'S DAD
dialog: That's my boy. That big, lovely
dialog: kung fu warrior is my son!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Thanks, Dad.
dialog: 
text: Po hugs his dad. The wok falls off Po's head and rolls on the
text: ground until Mantis appears in frame and stops it. The rest
text: of the Five are with him. Po takes notice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, guys.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIGRESS
dialog: Master.
dialog: 
text: Tigress bows deeply. The others follow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FURIOUS FIVE
dialog: Master.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: (modest)
dialog: Master?
dialog: (then, remembering)
dialog: Master Shifu!
dialog: 
text: Po races toward the Jade Palace. He climbs the steps. Then
dialog: more steps.
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PALACE - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Po arrives breathless at the Jade Palace. Shifu is still
text: lying in the scroll room, his eyes closed. Po rushes to his
dialog: side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Master! Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay?
dialog: 
text: Shifu weakly opens his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: Po! You're alive!
dialog: (then, darkly)
dialog: Or we're both dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: No, Master, I didn't die. I
dialog: defeated Tai Lung!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: You did?!
dialog: 
text: Shifu smiles and shakes his head in disbelief.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU (CONT'D)
dialog: Wow. It is as Oogway foretold --
dialog: You are the Dragon Warrior. You
dialog: have brought peace to this Valley.
dialog: And to me. Thank you. Thank you,
dialog: Po. Thank you...
dialog: 
text: Shifu closes his eyes. He is still. Po starts freaking out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: No! Master! No No No! Don't die,
dialog: Shifu. Please...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: (eyes snapping open)
dialog: I'm not dying, you idiot-- ah,
dialog: Dragon Warrior. I'm simply at
text: peace. Finally.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Oh. So, um, I should...stop
dialog: talking?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: If you can.
dialog: 
text: Po nods reverently as Shifu closes his eyes again. Master and
text: pupil lie next to each other. The camera pulls up and back
text: away from them. Po tries to remain still, but it's hard.
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He's about to say something, but he stops himself. He fidgets
text: for a beat, then can't control himself any longer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: Want to get something to eat?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIFU
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
scene_heading: IRIS OUT.

speaker_heading: THE END
