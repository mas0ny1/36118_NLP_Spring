scene_heading: EXT: WINGS BAKERY SHOP, WEST BROADWAY, CHINATOWN -DAY
text: CUSTOMERS move in and out when BOOOOM! The screen EXPLODES in
text: a ball of FIRE.
text: The bleeding PATRONS stumble into the street as flames pour
text: from a gaping hole that was once a bustling Herb shop.
text: Across the street, a young ASIAN, poorly dressed, lights a
text: smoke. His body is undernourished and covered with the tattoo
text: insignia of the FUKIENESE DRAGONS. But its his eyes that get
dialog: your attention. Dark and hungry, they watch his days work
text: with the detachment of one whos been taught the value of life
text: is zero. Meet BOBBY VU.
text: Oblivious to the chaos, he strides into the street flanked by
text: three similarly tattooed youths who we will come to know as
text: JACK, BLACK EYES and "THE TALL KID". Together they encircle a
text: middle-aged TRIAD SYMPATHIZER dressed totally in his bakery
text: whites, crawling from the rubble. The young gangsters brazenly
text: pull pistols from their jackets.
speaker_heading: BOBBY VU
dialog: Fukienese Dragons not funny now.
text: The injured man futilely pulls a gun from his coat as the
text: Dragons execute their prey in a barrage of gunfire. Smoke
text: drifts from their weapons when Bobby notices a frightened
text: TOURIST lying in a puddle of her own blood. He looks into her
text: tear filled eyes and raises his gun to finish her. But she
text: dies before he needs to shoot.
text: He then climbs into a rented Ford and takes off.

text: According to police, the Fukienese Dragons, a new

dialog: China.
text: The television shows a surveillance photo of Bobby Vu as the
text: sound of sporadic GRUNTS and a heavy WHACK...WHACK, emanates
text: from the back of the shop.
text: Sitting at a table, drowning in a shower of sweat, is a fifty
text: year old blob named PHAN HO. Nerves mask his face, when
text: suddenly his arm lurches forward as if something or someone
text: pulled him. WHACK!
speaker_heading: REPORTER (TELEVISION)
dialog: Sources say the bombing and execution of a known Triad

dialog: Wong. Known in the community as Uncle Benny.
text: A photo of sixty three year old Benny Wong fills the TV screen
text: as Phan Ho takes a five from a dwindling stack of bills and
text: pushes it across the table to NICK CHEN.
text: Chens thirty six, and whatever money he earns is spent on
text: clothes and fifty dollar haircuts. Hes handsome and cool,
text: with looks hailing more from his Hong Kong father than his
dialog: mainland mom.
text: Phan watches as Chen takes a card from his hand and flips it
text: onto the table. Ace of Spades. Phan drops a three of Clubs.
text: Back and forth until Phans empty and Chens left with one
text: card. He smiles, taking his time as the fat man wipes sweat
text: from his brow.
speaker_heading: PHAN
dialog: Throw it!
text: Phans poised to strike. Chen drops the card. Jack of Clubs.
text: Both men move, but Chens quicker. He pulls the card from the
text: table letting Phan slam his hand on nothing but wood. WHACK!
text: Phan holds his palm as Chen picks up the cards and another
text: five. He shuffles the deck skillfully with his right hand as
text: his left fishes a smoke from his pocket.

dialog: Its late. No Fukienese Dragons come here. I close

text: On cue, the bell over the front door sounds trouble.
scene_heading: INT PHAN HO'S LAMPS - NIGHT
text: The youths entering the shop are FUKIENESE. Two, Jack and "The
dialog: Tall Kid", we recognize as the shooters from Wings. One of
text: them, Fuke #1, stays outside to stand guard as the others
dialog: approach Chen.
speaker_heading: TALL KID
dialog: (Fukienese)
dialog: Time to pay.
text: They move purposefully toward the two men as Chen drops a
text: seven of clubs on the table and turns to Phan.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: You speak Fukienese?
text: Phan nods as the young thugs reach the table. Chen turns over

speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Tell em theyre in the wrong store.
speaker_heading: TALL KID
dialog: Fuck you.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Learned some English, good for you.
text: Chen pulls his .45 and lays the cannon on the table.
speaker_heading: PHAN
dialog: Are you crazy?
text: Chen drops a Jack of hearts on the pile, covers it uncontested
text: and takes a five from Phans ever shrinking pile.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Lucky...are you?
text: Chen stares at the Tall Kid, goading him with his lack of
text: concern...Three seconds pass like kidney stones... Finally,
text: Chen laughs to himself, stands and puts his finger to the Tall
text: Kids head as if it were a play gun.
text: The lack of respect incites the Tall Kid to go for his gun.
text: But before he can fire a shot, Chen produces a .38 from his
text: sleeve and puts a bullet through the gangsters head.
text: Phan drops to the ground as Chen dives over the card table,
text: grabbing his .45. He hits the floor pulling the table down
text: with him as a shield for Phan, then himself as Fuke #2 shoots
text: wildly before being taken out by Chen.
text: Jack retreats to behind a wall, then slowly crosses through an
text: archway to confront Chen from behind. As he steps out, he
text: finds only Phan cowering on the floor. Chen has disappeared.
text: Suddenly the place explodes in a hail of automatic gunfire as
text: Fuke #1 enters the store and sprays everything in sight,
text: producing a blizzard of glass. Jack turns to see Chen has
text: re-appeared and taken up postion behind a counter full of
text: lamps and mirrors while he takes on both Jack and Fuke #1.
text: Chen skillfully uses one of the counters as cover as he makes
text: his way towards the front of the store, gets a bead on the
text: Fuke with the automatic and sends him flying back out the
text: front door in a hail of glass- pedestrians scattering for
dialog: their life.
text: Jack, alone now, cowers behind an opposite counter,
text: desperately crawling along the floor trying to make his way
text: out of there. He peeks through an opening to his cover and
text: find Chen nowhere in sight.
text: Slowly, painfully hunched over, he backs up towards the
text: blown-out front door, checks for Chen one more time, then
text: decides to make a run for it. Suddenly hes got a foot
text: slamming into the side of his head sending him crashing back
text: to the floor. Chen has appeared out of nowhere.
text: Chen drives another kick into his stomach, then yanks him to

scene_heading: INT: NICK CHENS APARTMENT, KITCHEN, MOTT STREET-NIGHT
text: The whistle comes from a screaming teapot. Chen, dressed in a

text: sizzling like a steak. Unlike his wardrobe, his place is
text: modest. The lamp from Phans fits in nicely.
text: Tired, he stares vacantly at the wallpaper until a gorgeous

text: tying her dress we know she was recently very naked. He knows

speaker_heading: MAY

dialog: Mr. Lee said no charge.
text: She bows and walks out the door. Chen watches the young

text: He throws the cash back into the drawer and shuts it.
text: Eventually, he gets up and crosses to the window. He eats his
text: soup in the lifeless apartment, glancing down at the simple,

text: the window looking out on the palpable energy and vigor of a
text: bustling Chinatown.
scene_heading: EXT: CHENS APARTMENT, MOTT STREET-LATER (NIGHT)
text: A rush of sound as Chen steps from the building. Activity

text: His demeanor starts quiet. But as he moves through the

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: My congratulations on your commendation. I trust

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Uncle Benny is very proud of you.

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Why us? Its the Fukienese Dragons who killed her.
dialog: Were just trying to do business as weve always
dialog: done.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Because youre suppose to keep order in Chinatown.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Its not like it once was. The youth gangs are not

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: If the Feds get near Uncle Benny, our heads go
dialog: first. So you do whatever it takes to make some

speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: Did a two hour sweep. No one would speak to me.
speaker_heading: UNG

speaker_heading: CHEN

text: young WALLACE holding a box of personals.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Im Daniel Wallace.

speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: My fault?
speaker_heading: KLEIN
dialog: A freakin tourist got blown up in our backyard.
dialog: Not to mention an FBI snitch. And it happened on

text: it, the Police Commisioner has promised safety on
dialog: the streets of Chinatown, Christ its been on
dialog: freakin Nightline. So if putting a white cop in

speaker_heading: WALLACE

speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: So whats your plan to save the yellow people?
speaker_heading: WALLACE

speaker_heading: CHEN

text: passes and pulls her into one of the bedrooms.
scene_heading: INT: 1ST GINZA BEDROOM
text: Chen reaches into Mays pocket, finding a packet of white
text: powder. She tries to kiss him. He pulls away and pockets the
text: heroin, pissing her off. He quiets her with three hundreds.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: (Cantonese)
dialog: Get outta here.
text: He gently nudges her out to the hallway and towards the
text: backstairs where Wallace is just coming up with a handfull of

speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: You want me to take her?

speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: (sotto to Wallace)
dialog: Always throw back the smallest of the days catch.
text: Suddenly a torrent of automatic gunfire explodes at the
text: opposite end of the hallway taking out the glass door and the
text: uniform who stood in front of it revealing a Fukiense shooter
text: behind the shatterered door. One cop down. Chens instinct are
text: immediate.The Fuke killer is toast. The uniform who was
text: talking to Wallace turns towards the action and is met with a
text: pile of lead exploding his heart, blowing out his back and
text: spraying Wallace with blood. Wallace freezes- a deer in the
text: headlight. Chen sees this, jumps across the hall and pushes
text: Wallace out of the line of fire and into one of the bedrooms.
text: The doorway where Wallace stood explodes into a million pieces
text: of shrapnel. He would have been chopmeat. Just at that moment,
text: Ung crosses the hall in the opposite direction, shielding a
text: prostitute as he takes out the shooter who took out the
text: uniform and almost Wallace.
text: Chen leans out of what remains of the doorway, while yelling
text: back to the still shell-shocked Wallace.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Fire your weapon!
speaker_heading: UNG
dialog: Theyre Fukes!
text: The entire compliment is pinned down in either the rooms or
text: the hallway facing down three furious Fukes. Chen pumps his
text: final ammo clip into his gun, pulls a second gun from an ankle
text: holster and fires away. Suddenly, another Fuke with an
text: automatic weapon comes out of nowhere and advances kamakazi
text: style to one of the bedrooms- the P.D.s gunfire no match for
dialog: his Uzi. Hes got Chen, Ung, Deng, Wallace and the five
text: remaining uniforms pinned down. Chen thinks fast, retreats
dialog: into the bedroom-
scene_heading: INT: 1ST GINZA BEDROOM
text: Chen quickly feels the solidity of the walls- finds the weak
text: spot of the plasterboard and starts kicking through to the
text: next room while the firefight continues in the hallway.
scene_heading: INT: 2ND GINZA BEDROOM

dialog: position the only way he can.
scene_heading: INT: HALLWAY
text: The firefight continues but its totally one sided as the cops
text: pistols cant compete against the Uzi. Windows to the bedrooms
text: are exploding like firecrackers, whores and johns caught out
text: in the hallway shiver in terror behind whatever cover they can
text: find. A huge glass display in the hallway implodes drenching
text: the place in flying glass.
text: Wallace does the best he can, firing uselessly at the
text: kamikazi, only visible from the neck up as he keeps the entire
text: force at bay. Suddenly we see a glock come up to the back of
text: the shooters head which blows his brains out into the
text: hallway, finally silencing the automatic. Chen steps out, the
text: arm behind the hit.
text: Theres only three fukes left now, including Jack, armed only
text: with semi-automatics.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Im out on three! One, two, three!
text: Every cop steps out and bombards the end of the hall with all
text: the firepower theyve got. They pin back the shooters as Chen
text: storms into the hall and races, guns blazing toward the
text: gunmen. All three of them flee, one down the stairs, Jack and
text: the other up towards the roof. Chen decides to go up,
text: negotiating each corner with whatever hes got left. He gets
text: to the second flight just in time to see Jack desperately kick
text: out a window and make a run across a rooftop. Chen continues
text: the last flight up where he finds the lone Fuke out of amo and
text: desperately trying to tear open the roof acess door which is
text: bolted shut.
speaker_heading: CHEN (contíd)
text: Weapon down, hands in the air, up against the

text: The Fuke cooperates, backing up onto the landing as Chen

speaker_heading: CHEN (contíd)
dialog: Turn around!
text: The kid does, but as he moves he suddenly produces a knife the
text: size of a babys arm that cuts across Chen, slicing his
text: stomach. Chen reacts with amazing speed, smashing his gun
text: across the gangsters head almost decaptating him.
text: Simultaneously, the last Fuke comes charging up the stairs,
text: Chen picks up the guy next to him and hurls him over the
text: staircase knocking the charging Fuke down to the next landing.
text: His gun goes flying right towards Wallaces feet who together
text: with a backup of unifroms, comes bounding around the corner,

text: Some of the gangsters stand to run interference, but the two

scene_heading: INT: KUNG PHO RESTAURANT KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Ung pulls his gun, holding the other gangsters at bay as Chen

speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Want some?

speaker_heading: WALLACE (contd)
dialog: I tightened up last night, but I didnt find this

dialog: earned it.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: You study Chinese so you know what it means that I

speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: It means my life is yours, to do with as you wish
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Thats right. So heres my advice. Quit. Before

speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: I know the risks.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: So did the cops I didnt save last night. And all
dialog: it got them was dead. This isnt fun and games.
dialog: Especially for a kid heading to Law School with
dialog: his head up his ass if he thinks this is the way
dialog: to raise tuition.
text: Wallaces a bit surprised Chen knows this.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Just cause Im not putting in twenty doesnt mean
dialog: I cant do the job.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Yes it does.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: You dont want to work with me, fine. Let me do my

speaker_heading: CHEN

speaker_heading: WALLACE

speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: What do we have here?

speaker_heading: SCHABACKER

text: spots her, and it bothers him more than he lets on.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Lets hear it.
speaker_heading: CHEN
text: The F.B.I. have another informant inside the
dialog: Triad. This time, its one of their own- its an
dialog: agent.
text: Lee strokes the Mays hair as she slides her nude body against
text: his. He enjoys the fact that Chens not enjoying it.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Dont know. We picked up four of your guys and one
dialog: was a Fed. Wont take long to find out which one.
dialog: Then all youve got to do is blow his cover and
dialog: theyll pull him. No violence, no mess.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: My thanks.
speaker_heading: CHEN
text: The kids out.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: As you wish.

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Would you like a turn?
text: Chen, looks at the young girl then turns and exits the room.
text: Lee laughs as a figure moves out of a steam room behind him.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Weve got a Federal Agent sniffing around. Well
dialog: have to postpone delivery.
text: Lee glances toward Fukienese leader, Bobby Vu.
speaker_heading: BOBBY VU
dialog: We cant. The boats coming into port next week.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Then itll wait at the port.
speaker_heading: BOBBY VU
dialog: Im not afraid of the F.B.I.
text: Lee pushes May under the water toward his crotch.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Everything weve done has been to keep the Feds
dialog: focused on Uncle Benny. When hes gone, and I lead
dialog: the triad, you and your Fukienese brothers will
dialog: make all the money you want.
speaker_heading: BOBBY VU
text: Then lets kill him now.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: When Uncle Bennys indicted, hell be dangerous to
dialog: our partners in Hong Kong. And killing him, will
dialog: come with thanks instead of retribution.
speaker_heading: BOBBY VU
dialog: And Chen too.
speaker_heading: LEE

dialog: Do you remember me?
text: Wallace looks closer...and sees Henry Lee who stays in step
text: with Wallace as he walks up Bowery.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I have information about the girl you found in the
text: garbage dumpster.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Howd you find me?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Youre conspicuous in Chinatown...Two brothers on
dialog: Chrystie Street bring in illegals. The woman,
text: worked in their brothel, then tried to run. They
text: left her as a message to the others.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Everyone knows. But no ones going to speak of it.
dialog: Especially to the police.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Why are you?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I knew her.
text: Lee looks at Wallace, and for a moment he seems almost sad.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: What are their names?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: You cant tell anyone how you found out. Not even
dialog: Chen.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Forget it.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: For every person who knows, the chances of me, or
dialog: one of my children being killed in reprisal
dialog: increases a hundred fold.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: I cant.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: That girl was fifteen...And there are more to come
dialog: if you dont help us.
text: Wallace thinks, remembering the girl as she was stuffed into
text: the body bag....He knows he shouldnt, but he nods his head
text: and Lee hands him a piece of paper.
speaker_heading: LEE

scene_heading: EXT: 142 CHRYSTIE STREET - DAY
text: Wallace anxiously watches the apartment building. He steadies
text: his nerves, then crosses the street and enters through the
text: front door.
scene_heading: INT: 142 CHRYSTIE HALLWAY - DAY
text: Its damp and poorly lit. Wallace moves down the narrow hall
text: and stops by the door next to the incinerator. He jimmies the
dialog: lock.
scene_heading: INT: 142 CHRYSTIE BASEMENT, STAIRS - DAY
text: He descends the stairs into the darkness. His mouth dries as
text: he pulls his gun. He moves down a narrow corridor, passing a
text: wooden door, when he hears something from inside. Faint
text: breathing. He reaches for the doorknob. Its locked. He takes
text: the slim jim from his jacket pocket and easily opens the door.
scene_heading: INT: 142 CHRYSTIE BASEMENT ROOMS - DAY
text: Its dark. Wallace takes his mag-light and scopes the room. He
text: steps back, startled, when he sees thirty FEMALE FACES, gaunt,
text: eyes glazed, huddled in the room like prisoners of war. None
text: look older than fifteen. Wallace stands looking at the young
text: women when he hears noise further down the hall. Slowly, he
dialog: steps back
scene_heading: INT: 142 CHRYSTIE BASEMENT, CORRIDOR - DAY
text: and creeps toward a second door framed with the bright light
text: from within. It sounds like a small motor mixed with
text: whimpering. He looks through the keyhole. It takes a moment
text: for his eye to adjust. When it does he jumps to his feet and
text: kicks open the door.
scene_heading: INT: 142 CHRYSTIE BASEMENT ROOMS - DAY
speaker_heading: WALLACE
speaker_heading: POLICE!
text: The room is awash in bright light, almost blinding Wallace
text: coming from the darkness. But there, on a bed, he sees the
text: source of the cries. Three young WOMEN engaged in forced sex.
text: He turns toward the light which is set atop a video camera
text: recording the scene. A MAN, mid forties, throws the camera at
text: Wallace and races for the door. Wallace tackles him into the
text: dark hallway...
scene_heading: INT: 142 CHRYSTIE BASEMENT, CORRIDOR - DAY
text: ...and pummels him with his fist. A loud BANG and a flash of
text: light from the end of the hall as someone fires a bullet at
dialog: Wallace.
text: Instinctively, without thinking, he fires back, hitting the
text: SHOOTER, who slumps to the ground. The impact of his first
text: shooting washes over him. In that moment, the man beneath him
text: pushes to his feet and begins running down the hall.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: STOP!
text: The man grabs for the dead shooters gun, turns and takes a
text: bullet from Wallaces Glock before he can squeeze off a shot.
text: Wallace stands frozen. The smoke from his gun fills the tiny
text: hallway. He tastes blood and realizes he bit through his lip.
scene_heading: INT: 142 CHRYSTIE BASEMENT - LATER (DAY)
text: The place is now brightly lit as COPS and FORENSICS scour the
text: area. Chen enters from the far end and pulls Wallace aside.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: What were you doing in here?
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: I came out of the diner on Pell Street and saw
text: some guy snatch a purse. I chased him into the
text: building, but I lost him inside. Then I heard
text: screaming from down here. I just stumbled into it.
text: Chen stares at him as Ung and Deng approach from upstairs.
speaker_heading: UNG
dialog: Theres close to forty women here, all illegals.
dialog: And we found a store-room with about a hundred
dialog: tapes.
speaker_heading: DENG

scene_heading: INT: JIMMY LOO'S - NIGHT
text: A good-sized crowd, including Ung and Wallace. Ungs gassed.
speaker_heading: UNG
dialog: Its dick size.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: You think everything is dick size.
speaker_heading: UNG
dialog: It is. White people believe all Asians got little

dialog: your pecker, shes going to think its Mount Saint
dialog: Helens.
text: Chen and Wallace laugh.
speaker_heading: UNG
dialog: Its true. And then you look at the tiny hands on

speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Hes discovered our secret.
speaker_heading: UNG

speaker_heading: UNG

speaker_heading: CHEN & WALLACE
dialog: No!
text: Wallace pulls Ung back into his seat.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: On that note, its time to head home. Ill see you
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Eight sharp. Were going to pick up surveillance

speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: You did a lot for those women down there...You did

speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: But it was an accident. Youre lucky youre not

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Congratulations, Detective.

speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Thanks. Ive gotta...
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: You must allow me to buy you a drink.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: I really...
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: You did a great thing for the people of this

scene_heading: INT: STAIRWELL-NIGHT
text: Chen climbs a rotted stairwell of the Ginza massage and
text: approaches an unmarked door. He hesitates, then decides to
text: knock. He sees an eye in the peephole. An old WOMAN, seventy
text: plus, opens the door and he steps inside.
scene_heading: INT: GINZA MASSAGE - NIGHT
text: All is back to normal just days later. The welcome room is
text: filled with young girls smoking. One of the girls is May.
text: The old Woman calls her over and Chen sees her eye is bruised.
text: May leads him toward the back but halfway down the hall he
text: stops. Chen turns to the old woman and says something in
text: Cantonese. She nods and Chen hands her three hundred dollar
text: bills. He then takes May gently by the arm and escorts her out
dialog: of the apartment.

scene_heading: INT: UNDERGROUND/MASSAGE ROOM - NIGHT
text: Lee and Wallace, wrapped in towels, sip champagne as they step
text: from a steam room thick with humidity.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Theres more of Chinatown below sea level than
dialog: above.
speaker_heading: LEE
text: Theres always more under the surface.
text: The two men are greeted by a pair of beautiful MASSEUSES. One
text: guides Wallace to a massage table, the other takes Lee
dialog: outside.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Enjoy.
text: Lee exits as Wallaces Masseuse motions for him to lie face
text: down on the table. He hesitates, but eventually lies down.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: (Cantonese)
dialog: Whats your name?
text: She "Shhhs" him...then removes Wallaces towel. He glances
text: back, feeling awkward as she begins covering his naked body
dialog: with oil.
text: Expertly, she glides her hands over his skin, massaging his
text: muscles. He wants to stop her, but he doesnt. The Masseuse
text: moves around, working his arms, legs, back and buttocks.
text: She then climbs on top of him, and using her weight, digs
text: deeper into his muscles. Slight moans begin escaping from his
text: lips. After a moment, she reaches over and dims the lights.
text: She removes her robe, covers her body with oil and glides
text: herself slowly over Wallaces skin. His eyes move about,
text: showing both his discomfort and enjoyment. She rubs her lips
text: gently across his back to the base of his neck. She kisses his
text: ear as her mouth moves across his face. She turns him onto his
text: back. He looks up into her eyes, knowing he should stop. But
dialog: he cant. Yellow fever.
scene_heading: INT: CHENS APARTMENT-NIGHT
text: Chen leads May into the apartment. She stands awkwardly in the
text: center of the room. He turns on the lamp he picked up at
text: Phans. When he turns she tries to kiss him...but he holds her
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: No.
text: She looks at him, not sure why shes there. Neither is he.
text: They stand awkwardly. After a moment, he crosses to the
text: kitCHEN. He opens the fridge and removes a cellophane bag
text: filled with fruit.
text: He takes a knife from a butcher block and expertly slices a
text: blood orange, separating the rind, removing the seeds. He
text: hands May a sculpted piece of the dark red fruit.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: (Cantonese)
dialog: From home.
text: She takes it from him. Her eyes close as she tastes the fruit.
text: For a short moment she is across the sea, sitting with her
dialog: family.
text: Chen smiles, and digs more produce from the fridge. He then
text: hands May another slice of blood orange and begins chopping
text: the vegetables in perfect, even slices. He glances at May and

scene_heading: EXT: WALLACES BUILDING SUNRISE
text: The sun barely peeks over the horizon as Wallace enters the

scene_heading: INT: WALLACES APARTMENT - SUNRISE
text: He moves slowly, wearing the all nighter across his face. He
text: cuts across the living room, steps into the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT: WALLACES APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY
text: He stops in his tracks. Lying on the floor is his father,
text: beaten to a pulp. For a moment we see genuine concern on
text: Wallaces face.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: SEAN WALLACE
dialog: Tried to...Never made it.
text: His concern fades as he realizes his fathers conscious. But
text: he still kneels beside him and checks his injuries.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: You gotta go to the hospital.
speaker_heading: SEAN WALLACE
dialog: No time.
text: He starts coughing and a pile of blood seeps from his mouth.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Youre bleeding inside.
speaker_heading: SEAN WALLACE

speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: I dont have it. Not that kind.
speaker_heading: SEAN WALLACE

speaker_heading: WALLACE

speaker_heading: SEAN WALLACE

speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: I dont think so.

text: Wallace pulls away and positions himself at the window.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: When I was carrying him.
speaker_heading: CHEN

speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Try nothing.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: But Im overwhelmed. This showing of emotion. This
text: outpouring of human kindness. The caring, the
dialog: warmth. Dont look at me, I think Im crying.
text: Chen smiles in spite of himself as Wallace turns toward the
text: window and spots two ASIANS stepping from a Lincoln, which
text: drives away.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: These two dont look like junkies.
text: He picks up the camera and starts snapping away. Chen crosses

speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Shit.
text: Both men have guns drawn by the time they hit the door.
scene_heading: EXT: BAXTER STREET APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Chen and Wallace hit the pavement at the same moment the two
text: Asian gangsters climb into the big Lincoln which immediately
text: starts backing out of the alley.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Police!
text: Asian gangster's #2's answer is a barrage of automatic
text: gunfire. Chen responds with one neat shot through the
text: windshield and into the driver's head. Gangster#1 wastes no
text: time pushing the dead driver out from behind the wheel before
text: Chen and Wallace can reach the car and continues their getaway
text: at warp speed. Chen unloads his weapon at the fleeing car
text: before turning and heading towards the Chevy while Wallace
text: charges up a narrow passageway to cut the gangsters off.
scene_heading: EXT: NARROW CHINATOWN STREET (N.Y.) - DAY
text: Wallace comes flying out of the alley and into the street just
text: in time to get off a few shots at the oncoming Lincoln which
text: barrels right at him forcing him to jump onto a parked car at
text: the last minute. Chen races from the opposite direction hoping
text: to block the Lincoln's path. Without hesitating, the gang car
text: plows onto the sidewalk and escapes past the terrified
text: pedestrians. Chen pulls a 180, Wallace hops in the passenger
text: seat and the chase is on.
scene_heading: EXT. SECRET STREET (TOR) - day

dialog: plates five, niner, five, alpha, alpha, zulu
text: travelling south on Park Row, subjects armed
dialog: and dangerous. Request road block units on all

text: With Chen and Wallace closing in, Gangster #2 unloads another
text: burst of gunfire. One of the bullets punctures the windshield,
text: grazes Wallace's ear, exploding the headrest behind him. Chen
text: continues to catch up as the Lincoln makes a sharp left
text: slipping through the cross traffic. The Chevy's not as lucky,
text: as it gets clipped in the rear causing it to spin 90 degrees
text: and slowing their pursuit.
scene_heading: EXT: PELL STREET (N.Y.) - DAY
text: The Lincoln moves fast down Pell and hangs a sharp right
text: careening onto Bowery heading downtown. Chen and Wallace
text: struggle to keep up with pedestrians scattering in all
text: directions. Just as the gangsters reach the first stoplight it
text: turns green. They pull out into the oncoming lane cutting in
text: front of the waiting traffic which is just starting to move.
text: In order to stop them and pin the Chevy in, gangster#2 lets
text: loose a barrage of gunfire which mows down the drivers of the
text: first row of car, pinning the Chevy behind the bloody
text: roadblock. The Lincoln takes off to the right. Chen backs up,
text: sees an opening to an alley parallel to the street and takes
text: off down it hoping to cut them off.
scene_heading: EXT: SPADINA ALLEY (TOR) - DAY
text: Chen and Wallace speed through the narrow pasageway checking

scene_heading: EXT: NARROW DOWNTOWN STREET (TOR) - DAY
text: Cars parked on both sides of the street.
text: Chen comes right up beside the Lincoln and tries to force it
text: to a stop by pushing it up against the parked cars but the
text: Lincoln just keeps charging, banging an opening through the
text: cars and jumping onto the sidewalk knocking down a half-dozen
text: pedestrians who can't get out of the way fast enough. Chen
text: tracks alongside- gangster#2 spraying automatic fire at them,
text: smashing out the windows of the parked cars. Chen and Wallace
text: do their best to return fire. A delivery truck straddles the
text: sidewalk in front of the Lincoln, instead of slowing, they
text: speed up and at the last moment crash through parked cars,
text: forcing an opening for them to come back onto the street. The
text: parked car they punched through now blocks the Chevy. Rather
text: than stop, Chen blasts onto the opposite sidewalk, pulls up
text: next to the Lincoln while he and Wallace try to blow it out.
text: Suddenly there's an elderly woman pulling her shopping basket
text: in front of them who can't possibly get out of the way.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Yo, Civilian!!
text: Chen jams on the brakes, slides through an opening of parked
text: cars and follows the Lincoln around the corner to the left.
scene_heading: EXT: POST OFFICE ALLEY - DAY
text: Gangster #2 seeing the Chevy gaining on them, leans far out
text: his passenger side window and sprays the Lincoln's tires just
text: before a truck pulls out from a loading dock and sends the
text: gangsters body flying through the air like a puppet. The
text: Lincoln doesn't even slow. The Chevy spins uncontrollably, the
text: front end smashing into the elevated lift of a meat truck,
text: which cuts right through the windshield pinning Chen behind a
text: collapsed steering column.
text: Both men, shaken, watch as the Lincoln heads for the end of
text: the street, then suddenly pulls a smoky 180 and heads right
text: back towards them.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: What the hell is he doing?
text: The Lincoln drives straight at them with the now visible BLUE
text: and WHITES tailing it in close pursuit.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Shit.
text: Chen and Wallace try and climb from the Chevy. Wallace can.
text: Chen can't. He's trapped behind the wheel.
text: Chen looks at Wallace who stands beside the car.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Go!
text: Chen begins firing at the Lincoln. Wallace looking between
text: Chen and the fast approaching car, fires also. Chen's gun
text: empties. Because of the chaos of the delivery trucks, the
dialog: Lincoln has only one way out, and that is to crash straight
text: through the disabled Chevy.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: I said go!
text: Chen empties his gun. Wallace refuses to leave him. The
text: Lincoln is forty yards, thirty yards. It's engine is
text: deafening.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: GO!!!
text: Wallace stays, firing everything he's got. Out of ammo, he
text: quickly turns, dives back in the ca and grabs the shotgun from
text: the back seat. Twenty yards, ten yards, he sees the face of
text: the DRIVER when he gets lucky and a shotgun blast hits the
text: gangster in the chest. The Lincoln spins out of control,
text: twirling like crazy before it hits one of the trucks and
text: explodes in flames. Wallace pulls Chen down as the fireball

speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: A courtll never admit it without the agent backin

speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: They will once you tell em youve been working
dialog: with us on this investigation. That after the
dialog: shooting and before the chase, you entered the
text: building, approached our agent who, with his last
dialog: breath, told you he got this tape and corroborated
dialog: whats on it.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Thats perjury. Why would I do that?
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: To keep me from bringing charges against you for
text: obstructing a federal investigation. Wallace told
dialog: us how you engaged in the unauthorized
text: surveillance of a federal agent, which possibly
text: blew his cover, resulting in his assassination.
text: Chen looks at Schabacker.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: That speech may have shivered a rookie, but youll
dialog: need better for me.
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: Then Ill tell you what. You better watch your

dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Then invite me in.
text: Wallace opens the door wider and Chen steps inside. He looks

speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: You got something to drink?
speaker_heading: WALLACE

speaker_heading: CHEN

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I help you, when they move me, she come too, with

text: Chen nods, then places a small tape recorder on the table.

speaker_heading: CHEN

text: Jack looks at Chen and knows hes serious.
speaker_heading: CHEN (contd)
dialog: I want to know who shot that undercover Fed. And I

speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: My business is victimless. I supply services

dialog: whose business is not victimless. Whose tactic is
dialog: violence. I can help you rid Chinatown of those
dialog: elements, and help keep your father alive. All I
dialog: ask, is that you look out for my interests in
dialog: return.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Youre asking for more than that.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Long after you and I are gone there will be
dialog: gambling in Chinatown. There will be men willing
dialog: to pay a woman for her favors. And the police will
dialog: always be the last to know. Thats a fact...Now
dialog: you can chase your tail in the dark and accomplish
dialog: nothing, or you can really do some good. For the
dialog: people of Chinatown, for your career and for your
dialog: father.
text: Lee circles his table and approaches Wallace.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Think of how many more young girls would have

speaker_heading: LEE

speaker_heading: LEE

dialog:

text: Eyes wild and still YELLING, Chen nearly squeezes the trigger
text: himself, but his brain registers Wallace faster than his
dialog: finger.
text: The two cops, breathing hard, stare at each other knowing

text: Chen grabs Wallace by the neck.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Youre dead. Your life is over. I thought you were

dialog: him.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: You gave him the Fed didnt you?
text: Chen looks back at Wallace.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Thats why we were watching them. Thats why you
dialog: pressed that kid so hard to wear a wire. Yeah I

scene_heading: INT: GAMBLING PARLOR, STAIRWAY - DAY
text: He punches Lee to the floor. Lees Sumo and two other triad

speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: We had a deal.
speaker_heading: LEE

speaker_heading: CHEN

speaker_heading: CHEN

speaker_heading: LEE

speaker_heading: CHEN (contd)
dialog: Another thing. If you hear something in the

dialog: double check. It could be a bogus tip they wanted

dialog: or red plum?
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: I dont like plums.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: You dont like plums?
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: I like peaches.

text: stops to watch a bunch of KIDS playing soccer in the park.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Howd they get to you?
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: I was the first Chinese cop in the Fifteenth.
dialog: Thought I was gonna clean up Chinatown. But white
dialog: cops wouldnt work with me and the people wouldnt
dialog: talk to a cop, Chinese or not. Only Uncle Benny
dialog: paid me any attention. He became my godfather,
dialog: took care of my debts. Henry Lee was his
dialog: lieutenant. He fed me a few busts, made me look
dialog: good and I liked it. Then one night my father
text: walks into a gambling house and ends up dead.
dialog: Turns out Lee knew there was a contract on him.
dialog: Made it clear he couldve told me, I couldve

speaker_heading: CHEN (contd)

speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Set em up.
text: The youngsters clamor for the ices.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Whatdaya think Lees gonna do about the Fukes now

speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Hes made his deal with the Fukes.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: What are we going to do?
speaker_heading: CHEN

scene_heading: INT: FIFTEENTH PRECINCT, OUTSIDE THE AGU OFFICES - DAY
text: Through the glass door we see Wallace and Ung catch up on
text: paperwork as Detective Deng comes through it, into the hall
text: where the coffee machine sits. She pours black coffee into a
text: thirty-ounce cup, then hits it with a half dozen sugars. Chen
text: walks up.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Planning on staying up for a month?
speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: Wait till you have a baby...Did you hear?
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Hear what?
speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: Ive heard the FEDS have a case against someone in
dialog: the Fifteenth.
text: This gets Chens attention, but he tries to dismiss it.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Ive heard that every month for ten years.
text: Deng presses, like shes trying to tell Chen something more.
speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: So have I, but this time I hear they have tapes,
dialog: photos, the whole nine yards. Theyre pissed off
dialog: about their agent and Benny Wong getting killed
dialog: and they want to hang somebody for it.
text: Chen nods to his partner as she heads back to her desk. Chen
text: thinks for a moment, then looks through the glass at Wallace
dialog: working away.
dialog: omitted
scene_heading: INT: GAMBLING PARLOR - DAY
text: Chen enters the underground parlor. But today its empty,
text: except for Henry Lee, the Sumo, two other triad soldiers and
text: the dealer from last nights gambling. Lee is here to collect
text: his cut. His minions immediately frisk Chen and take his guns
dialog: from him.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Think I have a reason to use them?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Im not sure. Lately youve forgotten that what
dialog: happens to me, happens to you.
text: Lee makes sure Chen gets the message.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: The Feds are making a case against Wallace. We
dialog: need to cut him loose.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Youre nervous. Youre getting soft in your old
dialog: age.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: The only thing going soft is your brain.
text: The Sumo smashes Chen into the wall and down to the ground.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Personal attacks are going to get us nowhere,
dialog: Detective.
text: Chen can barely breathe, let alone get to his feet.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: But Ill tell you what. Ill take your advice to a
dialog: point. Ill sever any traceable ties between
dialog: us...and give Wallace a few arrests to knock the
text: shoo-flies off his heels.
text: Lee and his men start for the door, then stop.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I almost forgot in all this hub-bub.
text: He peels several bills from his takings and drops it on the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Todays payday for dirty cops. Make sure you give
dialog: Wallace his cut.
text: He smiles and walks out the door. Chen, still on the ground,
text: watches him go...then picks up the money.
scene_heading: EXT: FIFTEENTH PRECINCT - DAY
text: Chen walks up Elizabeth Street toward the station entrance
text: when he sees Wallace hurrying out of the building.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Wallace.
text: The young cop either ignores the sound or didnt hear it,
text: cause he heads straight for a patrol car parked at the back of
text: the police lot. Chen yells after him.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Wherere you going?
text: Wallace stops, lets Chen catch up.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: (making sure hes not overheard)
dialog: Lees not covering my old man with the Italians. I
dialog: gotta move him.
text: He starts towards his car.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: I told him to.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Why the helld you do that?
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Because the Feds are building a case against you.
text: The words hit Wallace like a jack hammer.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: I know. And if they nab you itll take three
dialog: seconds for you to give them me.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: I wouldnt...
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Yes you would...And so would I.
text: Wallace turns away. Watches some cops heading off duty.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Im not saying its fatal. Point now is to cover
text: tracks and keep everything clean on the surface.
dialog: And when they call you in, keep your mouth shut.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: I wish I never got into this.
text: Chen cant help feeling sorry for him.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: You and me both.
text: Chen reaches into his pocket and takes out the money he got
text: from Lee, careful that no one sees him. He peels off several
dialog: bills.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: This is your cut from Lee. Three grand.
text: Wallace looks at Chen. He doesnt want to touch the
text: money...but he needs it. So he slips it into his jacket.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: I gotta get to the hospital.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Wherere you gonna move him?
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: I dont know.
text: Chen looks at him, then holds out the rest of the money.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Thisll cover your old man.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: I cant.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Just take it.
text: Wallace hesitates, but takes the money.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Remember. Dont say anything. Let me deal with the
dialog: Feds. Alright?
text: Wallace nods and heads for his car.
scene_heading: INT: AMY SANS BEDROOM, BROOKLYN-DAY
text: Jack and Amy watch TV when Chen breaks in the window beside

speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Hard to find, Jack.
text: Chen grabs Jacks gun and slides it into his own belt.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Tell her to take in a movie.
text: Jack utters a few words in Fukienese and the young girl grabs
text: her clothes and hurries out of the room.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I wanted to call. I couldnt.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Now Im here. So what did you want to tell me
dialog: about Benny Wong?
scene_heading: EXT: JACOBI HOSPITAL, BRONX-LATER (DAY)

scene_heading: INT: JACOBI HOSPITAL, BRONX - day

speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Daniel Wallace.
text: Wallace turns and sees the two Feds moving toward him. He
text: quickly hands the envelope to the RECEPTIONIST.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Would you pass this letter to my father in room
dialog: 409? Sean Wallace.
text: Before she can answer, the Feds are on him flashing badges as
text: the larger Agent reaches for Wallaces gun.
speaker_heading: WALLACE (contd)
dialog: Back off.
speaker_heading: LARGE AGENT
dialog: Dont be an asshole.
text: He again reaches for Wallaces gun but Wallace pushes him off.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: You dont touch my gun or my badge dipshit. I work
dialog: in the Fifteenth.
text: Wallace stares at the two agents.
speaker_heading: SMALLER AGENT
dialog: Fine. Lets just get out of here quietly. Theres
dialog: a couple questions wed like to ask you.
text: Wallace continues to stare, then...
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: My father.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Well have someone on his door.
text: After a moment, Wallace turns to the flustered Receptionist
text: holding the envelope.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Thank you.
text: He then walks toward the door with the two Feds behind him.
scene_heading: INT: AMY SAN'SBEDROOM, BROOKLYN - SAME (DAY)

speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Then everybody split up?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Good. Youre under arrest.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?!
text: Chen slaps on the cuffs and turns the kid around.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Youre gonna tell the Feds youve been working
dialog: with Wallace and me. That the hit on Benny Wong
dialog: was Fukienese and youre eager to testify against
dialog: Bobby Vu. Do it right and Ill back you on trying
dialog: to tip me before the hit. Do it wrong, Ill go out
dialog: of my way to bury you.

scene_heading: INT: SCHABACKERS OFFICE, FEDERAL BUILDING-DAY

text: recognizes her from the raid on the Ginza Massage.
text: He looks up as a pissed off Schabacker and NYPD Internal
text: Affairs Inspector Vince Kirpatrick enter the tiny room.
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: Why the fuck didnt you tell me you were Internal
dialog: Affairs?
speaker_heading: WALLACE
text: Confidential undercover assignment. The key word
dialog: being confidential. Which nothing in the Bureau
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: Fuck you.
speaker_heading: KIRPATRICK
dialog: Nobody knows except a few of us in IA. Not even
text: the commanding officer in the Fifteenth knows.
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: Well now I know.
text: Schabacker looks at Wallace.
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: A bagmans kid, Internal Affairs. Youre old man
dialog: must think youre a real scumbag.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: I know what he thinks of Feds.
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: Yeah, yeah. So what have you got on Chen?
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: This isnt a federal case. So theres no reason to
dialog: tell you anything.
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: Yes, there is. Cause from where Im sitting it
text: looks to me like a young, I.A. rat went under to
dialog: build a case against Nick Chen and ended up
dialog: working for him.
speaker_heading: KIRPATRICK
dialog: Youre reaching.
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
text: Enjoying for himself the Chinatown whores and a

speaker_heading: KIRPATRICK

speaker_heading: SCHABACKER

speaker_heading: AGENT

speaker_heading: SCHABACKER

speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Hello, Pete.
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: Hello, Nick...Whos your friend?
speaker_heading: CHEN
text: A snitch of Wallaces and mine. Hes an eye
dialog: witness to the Benny Wong murder.
text: Schabacker sits back into his chair and offers Chen some nuts.
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: Cashews?
text: They both sit, munching their nuts.
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: Eye witness...And you brought him here to me? Why?
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: You know why.
text: The two cops sit looking at one another.
scene_heading: INT: SCHABACKERS OFFICE, FEDERAL BUILDING-LATER (DAY)
text: The same crew as before sit when Schabacker re-enters.
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: My compliments, Wallace. You mustve sunk your
dialog: hooks into Chen pretty good.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Whatd he want?
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: To trade for you.
speaker_heading: KIRPATRICK
dialog: He said that?
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: Not in so many words. He brought that Fuke snitch
dialog: of yours who rode shotgun on the Benny Wong
text: killing. He gives me the eye witness, I call off
text: the FBI investigation on Wallace.
text: Wallace feels more like a shit as Schabacker talks.
speaker_heading: KIRPATRICK
dialog: Whatd you tell him?
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: I told him fine. Were puttin the kid on the
dialog: street to get the rest of the Fukes on tape
dialog: talking about the hit on Benny Wong. And in
dialog: return, Im not going to press charges against
dialog: young Wallace here.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Is he still here?
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
text: He took off.
text: Schabacker leans back in his chair and smiles at Wallace.
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: You gotta promise me I can be there when you break
dialog: the bad news to Chen. Thats gonna be priceless.
text: Wallace feels a heavy weight lay across his shoulders.
scene_heading: EXT: SOUTHERN MANHATTAN - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT: WALLACE APARTMENT, BEDROOM-NIGHT
text: Wallace opens a safe box he has on the bed. Inside are audio
text: tapes. Dates and names written across the labels. Chens on
text: most. Lee on others. He grabs a blank tape and pops it into a
dialog: recorder.
text: He crosses to a mirror, opens his belt hides the recorder in
text: his underpants. He buckles up and runs a wire up his chest. He
text: gently tapes it to the inside of his shirt, then buttons up.
text: He tucks in the shirt tails and repositions the recorder.
text: Finished, he stares at himself. Not liking what he sees.
speaker_heading: SEAN WALLACE
dialog: Your wires showin.

speaker_heading: SEAN WALLACE
dialog: How long you been I.A.?
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: First assignment.
speaker_heading: SEAN WALLACE
text: Quickest way to a gold shield.
text: Wallace doesnt say a word.
speaker_heading: SEAN WALLACE
dialog: And all youve got to do is bury your partner. The
dialog: guy who shoved ten grand in your fist to back your
dialog: play.
text: Wallace looks at his father, wonders how he knows.
speaker_heading: SEAN WALLACE (contd)
dialog: I figure you aint worth much to
dialog: the chinks yet, so this must be
dialog: Chens money.
text: Wallaces lack of a response tells his father hes right.
speaker_heading: SEAN WALLACE (contd)
dialog: And youre gonna bury him. And for what? Turning
text: his head and makin a few dollars.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: I know that wouldnt mean much to you. Lyin and
dialog: cheatin are what youre made of.
speaker_heading: SEAN WALLACE
dialog: And its a hell of a lot better than what youre
dialog: made of.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: You dont know what Im made of. Its the one
dialog: thing I should thank you for, your lack of
dialog: interest.
speaker_heading: SEAN WALLACE
dialog: Yeah youve been real honest with your partner.
text: Wallace looks away from his father.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: End justifies the means.
speaker_heading: SEAN WALLACE
dialog: The end is bullshit. The means are what you live
dialog: with.
text: Sean reaches into his jacket, holds out Chens money and
text: tosses it on the floor.
speaker_heading: SEAN WALLACE
dialog: Keep it. I dont want anything from you.
text: Sean Wallace turns out of the room. His son looks back in the

speaker_heading: WALLACE

speaker_heading: CHEN

speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Wait, wait, wait.
text: She looks at him confused.
speaker_heading: TAI
dialog: You dont like me?

speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: I got to go to the bathroom first.
scene_heading: INT: HOTEL BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)

speaker_heading: WALLACE

speaker_heading: WALLACE

speaker_heading: KIM

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Its time to bring the cargo ship to port and

speaker_heading: CHEN

speaker_heading: LEE

speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: That was a short partnership.
speaker_heading: LEE

speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Time for a shower. You stink.

text: then pops a cig into his mouth and checks his pants for a
dialog: match...None.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: You got a match?
text: Chen picks up Wallaces jacket and reaches into one of the
text: pockets. Wallaces eyes snap to attention as he quickly grabs
text: a book of matches from the ashtray on the night stand.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Here.
text: He tosses the pack and Chen catches it. Wallace watches him

speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: You know you were right.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: About what?
text: Wallace crosses over, picks up his clothes.

speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: Everybody knows U.S. Attorney Margaret Wheeler?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: The tape is good. Probably enough for convictions
dialog: on Bobby Vu and the rest. But I think we hold off
text: until they make their move to bring in the illegal
dialog: shipment. We bust em on the ship. Then we go for
dialog: the murder charge, the smuggling rap and with Jack
text: here connecting the dots to an ongoing criminal
dialog: enterprise, we meet our racketeering requirements
dialog: and get life sentences.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: What about Henry Lee?
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: What about him, Nick?
text: Wallace watches Schabacker play with Chen. He doesnt like it.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Do we have a case, Pete?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
text: Theres enough to drag him before a grand jury,
dialog: but its gonna be his word against their word and
dialog: hell win. We wait till after the shipment comes
dialog: in, then the tapes got merit.
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: What do you think, Danny?
text: Wallace looks at Schabacker, whos smiling through it all.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Its Margarets call.
speaker_heading: MARGARET

speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: Nick...after we bust the Fukes, you, Danny and me

dialog: you think?
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: I cant wait.
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER

speaker_heading: CHEN

speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: I think if Jacks tape buries him its his fault
dialog: for trying to be too smart for his own good.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: And how long you think itll take him to trade for

speaker_heading: WALLACE

speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: I dont believe it.
speaker_heading: LEE (PHONE)
dialog: Your girlfriends found a wire on him last night. I
dialog: checked it out and the fuck is making a case
dialog: against you.
text: The words hit Chen like a freight train. He stands speechless.
text: His insides reeling as he looks over at his partner.
speaker_heading: LEE (PHONE)
dialog: You there?
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LEE (PHONE)
dialog: Who knows how long he was wired...Hes got to go.
text: Chens breath grows heavy as his eyes stare vacantly at
text: Wallace, whos working a beer.
speaker_heading: LEE (PHONE)
dialog: You kill him tonight.
dialog: Chen cant answer either way, hes not even sure if its real
dialog: or a dream.
speaker_heading: LEE (PHONE)
text: The Fukes are taking delivery in one hour. Pier 25
text: at Port Imperial in Jersey, a ship called the
dialog: DORIAN. Take him along and make sure he doesnt
dialog: leave the boat...you understand me? I dont give a
dialog: shit about the cargo, the Fukes, nothing. Just
dialog: make sure Wallace is dead. Are we clear?
text: Chen doesnt answer, he just keeps looking at Wallace, whos
text: looking back at him now.
speaker_heading: LEE (PHONE)
dialog: Hell hang us both.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Yeah. I understand.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Kill him.
text: Chen hangs up. He looks at Wallace, then pushes into...
scene_heading: INT: JIMMY LOO'S BATHROOM - DAY
text: He stands in the tiny room, half looking in the mirror, half
text: looking nowhere. Eyes darting, mind racing. He turns on the
text: water and runs it across his face, but it doesnt really help.
text: He reaches for a hand towel but its stuck in the dispenser.
text: He rips down on the towel with all the rage, frustration and
text: anger inside him, tearing the metal dispenser from the wall
text: and slamming it into the sink, the wall and finally to the
text: ground. He then tries to steady himself, but hes too upset.
text: But then his pager goes off. He calms himself, checks the
text: number...then dials. A voice answers.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Jack...slow down...tonight, Pier 25, the Dorian.
dialog: You did good, Jack. Where are you?...No, Ill
dialog: contact the F.B.I. I want you to stay at your
dialog: girlfriends, dont talk with anyone. After we
dialog: pick up the others, Ill come for you.
text: Chen hangs up. He takes a breath and looks at himself in the
text: mirror. He runs his hands through his hair and slowly exits
text: back into the bar.
scene_heading: INT: JIMMY LOO'S - DAY
text: His eyes stay on Wallace as he crosses the room. Only now they
text: look like he wants to kill him right there. He sits beside his
dialog: partner.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Get a hold of him?
text: Chen takes a healthy gulp from his new drink.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Did you tell him about the tape?
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Whatd he want?
text: Chen looks directly into Wallaces eyes. It takes him a moment
text: to get the words out of his throat.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: He wanted to tell me that the Fukes are picking
dialog: up their shipment in an hour, in Jersey.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Shit, we gotta move. Did you call the Feds?
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Yeah. Theyre going to meet us there.

scene_heading: EXT: PORT IMPERIAL, DOCK 25 - DUSK
text: A huge container ship sits silently at dock. We focus closer
text: on the Wheelhouse.
scene_heading: EXT: DOCK - NIGHT
text: Through night vision goggles we see the adjacent parking lot.
text: All seems calm at the moment.
scene_heading: INT: WHEELHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Chen stands quietly in the darkness looking through the night
text: vision goggles.
speaker_heading: CHEN
text: No sign of anybody.
text: He turns and hands the goggles to Wallace.
speaker_heading: CHEN (contíd)
dialog: Have a look.
text: Wallace takes up the post as Chen steps back into the shadows.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Lee said an hour, right?
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Yeah...still nothin?
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Yup...all clear.
text: Theres a long pause. We watch Chens face turn to stone.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: How about Internal Affairs?
text: Wallace flinches but covers.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: I forgot to mention it. Lee thinks theyre making
dialog: a case against someone in the fifteenth.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
text: (while continuing looking through the
dialog: goggles)
dialog: Who?!
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: He didnt know. Maybe its just a rumour. You hear
dialog: anything?
text: Wallace is about to answer when he sees a tractor trailer pull
text: into the lot.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Theyre here. Take a look.
text: He turns to give the goggles to Chen.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: No- you keep watching. Weve got to let em lead
dialog: us to the cargo.
scene_heading: EXT: CONTAINER SHIP - NIGHT
text: Through the goggles we Bobby Vu and the others be met by a
text: shipman and led to the far end of the boat.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
text: They're heading away from us.
scene_heading: INT: WHEELHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Chen quietly cocks his gun and points it at the back of
dialog: Wallaces head.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: What would you do if you knew I.A. had a case
dialog: against you? Would you run?
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: (increasingly uncomfortable)
dialog: I dont know what Id do. What would you do?
text: Wallace is unaware of Chen standing directly behind him, sweat
text: building on his face- ready to pull the trigger.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: You mean after I killed whoever ratted on me?
dialog: 
text: Wallaces blood turns to ice. He lowers the goggles, turns
text: slowly and comes face to face with the barrel of Chens gun.
text: Its instantly clear Chen knows all.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: You should have let me die in the car that day. At
dialog: least then I die a cop.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: You are a cop- a good cop. And Ill tell anyone
dialog: who asks.
text: Chen hesitates. Not sure what to believe.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: And you?
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: I dont know what I am. All I know is you saved me
dialog: and you saved my father. My life is really yours
dialog: to do with as you wish.
text: His words hang heavy in the air...and then Chen fires. But not
text: at Wallace. He fires past his head, through the glass of the
text: wheel house and hits the FUKENESE gangster who was about to
text: blow them away with an assault rifle. A beat, and automatic
text: fire comes from another window, spraying the wheelhouse with
text: hot metal. Wallace takes out the shooter as Chen flies out the
dialog: door.
text: Momentarily dazed, Wallace recovers, scrambles to his feet-
text: looks around, but Chen has disappeared.
scene_heading: INT/EXT: FUNNEL CHAMBER - NIGHT
text: Wallace enters slowly and traverses the three storey high
text: metal grate walkways. WE HEAR only the clank of his feet as he
text: descends deep into the ship.
dialog: omitted
scene_heading: INT: ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Chen moves stealthily passed the huge humming generators,
text: slowly approaching each blind curve. HE HEARS what sounds like
text: the distant cry of an infant. He keeps moving
scene_heading: VIDEO SURVEILLANCE P.O.V. - NIGHT
text: We see Chen move through the room towards the exit. An arm
text: carrying an UZI passes in front of the camera.
scene_heading: INT: ANCHOR ROOM - NIGHT
text: Wallace cocks his ear to the same sound as he moves through
text: the room dominated by the giant chains that connect to the
text: lowered anchors. Just at that moment a Fuke moves out from
text: behind the casing and gets off a shot that cuts right through
text: Wallace's left hand. He yelps in pain as he takes cover, rips
text: the sleeve of his shirt to stem the bleeding, then waits for
text: the Fuke to make his move. He does- Wallace stands right up at
text: him and takes him out in a fierce exchange.
scene_heading: INT: ENGINE ROOM FIRST FLOOR - NIGHT
text: The cavernous energy center of the ship. Four storey's high. A
text: cacophony of the brute force of the engines and the steel
text: walkways that encircle them.
text: Chen comes out on the bottom level. All seems quiet, except
text: for what seems like the distant hum of human whispering. He
text: moves slowly out into the open. The place seems empty until
text: suddenly a shape appears on the metal catwalk two storey's
text: above. He turns with lightening speed- points, ready to shoot
dialog: at...Wallace.
text: There's a tense standoff. Neither wants to lower their weapon
text: first. The sound of distant murmuring grows louder until
text: suddenly the standoff is ended by a common enemy. Wallace
text: whips around and sends a fuke who was about to shoot him
text: flying back against a wall. Chen suddenly finds a Fuke
text: charging down metal stairs towards him. He blasts him before
text: he can get a shot off- the Fukes lifeless body toboganning
text: down to land at Chens feet.
text: One holdout, BLACK EYES, equipped with an AK47 on the top
text: floor will not be taken out. Like some madman on crack he
text: sprays crazily in every direction until finally Chen just goes
text: for it stepping out into the open and pummeling BLACK EYES
text: with bullets. A pipe behind the Fuke explodes with steam,
text: enveloping Black eyes who falls limply onto a vertical crane.
text: Chen and Wallace relax a beat and then BANG! Black Eyes is up
text: and charging Wallace. Chen is faster, spraying him with
text: everything left in his weapon, hitting and igniting a fuel
text: pipe which spills out its fiery liquid setting BLACK EYES
text: aflame. The dying Fuke grabs onto some hanging rope and in a
text: last defiant act, swings down the three storeys all the time
text: firing and coming almost face to face with Chen before being
text: finally silenced- his incinerated corpse landing at Chens
dialog: feet.
text: Wallace scans the area while he descends the stairs towards
text: Chen. There are no Fukes in sight. The human murmuring grows
text: louder. Without speaking, Chen and Wallace move towards the
text: source of the sounds.
scene_heading: INT: PASSAGEWAY ANTEROOM - NIGHT
text: Chen and Wallace move slowly down the few steps to a heavy
text: steel door beyond which the sounds seems to emanate. With
text: silent gestures they work like the partners they've become.
text: Wallace opening the door and stepping back, covering Chen as
text: he makes his move.
scene_heading: INT: PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
dialog: Nothing could have prepared them for what they find on the
text: other side of the door. There, as far as the eye can see,
text: running the entire length of the ship, is the cargo Lee
dialog: awarded the Fuke's. Several hundred illegal Chinese immigrants
text: huddled together in unspeakable conditions, stuffed into a
text: tiny opening that resemble's an endless train compartment.
text: Their dark vacant eyes stare back at the shocked cops who move
text: cautiously through the passageway. It doesn't take long for
text: the remaining Fuke's to make their presence known with a
text: bullet destined for Chen, and intercepted by the back of an
text: innocent young male immigrant.
text: Chen, Wallace and the desperate group of illegals flatten
text: themselves against the sides of the corridor. SILENCE
text: Chen steps out quickly as if to take a shot, but it's a sucker
text: punch as he immediately tucks himself back in then out again
text: just in time to duck the bullet from a Fuke and plant his own
text: squarely in the gangster's chest.
text: Chen ducks back behind the steel separators that occur about
text: every twenty feet in the passageway. Wallace is one
text: "compartment" back. A young boy, no more than six years old,
text: drifts out into harms way. Wallace reaches out quickly and
text: pulls him to his side. While Wallace keeps quard, the kid
text: holds onto his hand and begins to sympathetically rub his
text: bandage- his eyes pleading for salvation of any kind. Chen
text: looks back sees this and Wallace's empathic reaction to pat
text: the young kid on the head. Chen hesitates a second, then...
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: Wallace...
text: Wallace snaps to. Chen indicates for him to follow as he
text: sprints out and moves quickly down the narrow tunnel past the
text: endless collection of immigrant pawns. We see their
text: desperation not only in their faces, but in their pathetic
text: little bundles that contain all their worldly belongings. They
text: mutter Cantonese pleas.
speaker_heading: CHEN and WALLACE
dialog: (Cantonese)
dialog: Quiet...quiet.
text: They come to a stop. Listen a moment to the silence.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Maybe that's all of them.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Bobby Vu's here, and he'll never leave without
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Without you.
text: Wallace moves out quickly out into the passageway as if
text: taunting Vu to make his move. He stops two compartments down.
text: Chen is one compartment behind. They exchange looks. Chen
dialog: indicates to "stay put".
text: Wallace peaks out from behind the steel. One of the oldest
text: women in the hold, a grandmotherly face of China, motions for
text: Wallace to come closer.
dialog: grandmotherly type
dialog: (Cantonese)
dialog: Come here, boy. Come to me.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: (Cantonese)
dialog: What?
dialog: grandmotherly type
dialog: (Cantonese)
dialog: I know where they are.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Where?
dialog: grandmotherly type
dialog: Come here.
text: Chen watches as Wallace moves out and approaches the woman.
text: Suddenly the image goes into hyper slo-mo. We see the woman
text: mouthing the Cantonese words for "come here". Back on Chen,
text: there suddenly something wrong. He looks closely at the old
text: woman, and then, operating purely on instinct, he races
dialog: forward.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: NO!!!!!
text: Just as Wallace steps up to the woman, CHEN pushes Wallace
text: aside and takes the automatic fire that Bobby Vu shoots from
text: behind an innocent skirt. Wallace immediately raises his gun
text: and fires two in the chest and one in the head. Just like Chen
text: taught him. Bobby Vus body hits the floor with a thud. Dead.
text: Wallace looks down at Chen as the blood begins spreading out
text: around him. Quickly, he kneels beside his partner, gathers him
text: in his arm and tries to control the bleeding, but the wound is
text: deep. He turns toward a commotion at the entrance to the
text: tunnel and sees a bunch of Feds and uniforms heading towards
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Bring a stretcher!! (to Chen) Come on, hang on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Shit.
text: Chen tries to catch his breath, but he cant seem to.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Youre alright. Youre OK.
text: Chens body spasms from the pain.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Im sorry.
text: Chen grabs hold of Wallaces hand.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Who sends a white cop undercover in Chinatown?
text: Wallace looks into Chens eyes. Hes fading in and out.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: (leaning close)
dialog: Nick...can ya hear me?
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: (barely conscious)
dialog: Mmmm...
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Nick...its just you and me...Im your partner.
text: A tiny smile escapes from Chen just before he loses
text: consciousness and is surrounded by an EMS team.

speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
speaker_heading: (to the OFFICER)
dialog: Get Wallace out here.

speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: Now.
text: The Officer gets up slowly from his chair as the door swings
text: open and Wallace exits from the room. He looks at the two men
text: then starts down the hall when Kirpatrick slaps him across the
text: chest with the manila envelope.
speaker_heading: KIRPATRICK
dialog: Whats this bullshit?
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Exactly what it says. That after a month long
dialog: investigation, theres no evidence to support any
dialog: charges against Lt. Nicholas Chen.
speaker_heading: SCHABACKER
dialog: You think you can get away with this forget it.
text: Hes responsible for the death of a Federal Agent.
text: An ICU team races down the hall and charges into Chens room.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
text: Chens dead.
text: Schabacker and Kirpatrick dont say a word.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: And no matter what you believe, the officer in

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I was very saddened to hear about your friend, Lt.
dialog: Chen...Oh, Im sorry, he wasnt your friend after
dialog: all, was he?
text: Lee puts on his coat and leans close to Wallace.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: And Id like to thank you for killing all the

text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Not all. Not the one who recorded this tape.
