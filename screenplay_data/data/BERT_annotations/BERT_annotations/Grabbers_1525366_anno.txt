scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Across the inky swell, a river of moonlight cuts a path to a
text: lonely fishing tug drifting with the tide. THE MERRY WIDOW.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MERRY WIDOW GALLEY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A light bulb waltzes with the sway of the boat. Three shabby
text: Irish fishermen unwind after dinner, playing cards.
dialog: 
text: The eldest and scruffiest (the SKIPPER) reveals his hand to a
text: young deckhand (GREG). Read 'em and weep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You can't be serious?
dialog: 
text: Laughing, the Skipper unspools himself from the cramped table
text: as he and ROY, the bloated first-mate, clamber above deck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Every bloody night.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Roy and the Skipper check the hauled in nets, until ...
dialog: 
text: A SILENT ARC OF LIGHT SLICES ACROSS THE SKY. It careens
text: downwards in a furious trajectory and --
dialog: 
text: BOOM!! A mile off their port it collides with the sea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Did you see that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIPPER
dialog: ... Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: A flare?
dialog: 
text: The Skipper watches the water. Unsure.
dialog: 
text: Greg leaps on deck brandishing a clutch of cards.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Ye cheated! There's five aces! I
dialog: counted 'em!
dialog: 
text: The Skipper brushes past Greg, distracted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIPPER
dialog: Secure the lines.
scene_heading: GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Greg looks to Roy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Not so funny now, huh?
dialog: 
text: Roy plucks one of the five aces from Greg's hand and flips it
text: over. Its backing is red.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: It's from a different deck, ya
dialog: muppet.
dialog: 
text: He sticks it to Greg's damp forehead and carries on as
text: ordered. Greg turns the remaining aces over. They're blue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: ... Shite.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Foam rises as bubbles crest violently. Closing in, the Merry
text: Widow casts its searchlight across the churning surf.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PILOTHOUSE / EXT. OCEAN
dialog: 
text: The Skipper steers carefully, holding a radio mic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIPPER
speaker_heading: (INTO MIC)

dialog: Widow. Call sign echo whiskey

text: nautical miles west of Erin Island.
text: Responding to unknown distress
text: flare. Over.
dialog: 
text: The Skipper pulls back on the throttle, sloshing to a stop.
dialog: 
text: He taps the sonar screen. A hazy shadow engulfs the readout.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIPPER
dialog: Definitely something ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY (O.S.)
dialog: Over there!
dialog: 
text: Roy shines his flashlight over the rail.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: There's something in the water!
dialog: 
text: Suddenly Roy wheels overboard, yanked into the murky sea.
scene_heading: GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The Skipper drops the mic and rushes to the rail with Greg.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIPPER
dialog: Roy!
dialog: 
text: Roy's glowing flashlight bobs in the water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIPPER
dialog: Can you see him?!
dialog: 
text: A hundred yards off on the opposite starboard side, far
text: behind them, Roy surfaces SCREAMING!
dialog: 
text: Greg and the Skipper rush to the starboard rail.
dialog: 
text: Roy's gurgled, tortured cries mist in the air.
dialog: 
text: The Skipper snaps into action. Seconds count.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIPPER
dialog: Don't lose him!
dialog: 
text: Greg points, fixing Roy's position.
dialog: 
text: The Skipper grabs a lifebuoy, lights it up and throws.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIPPER
dialog: Roy! Don't panic, mate. Swim for
dialog: the buoy!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: C'mon, Roy, kick!
dialog: 
text: Roy's head strains the surface, his arms flailing in agonised
dialog: spasms ...
dialog: 
text: ... And then silence as he goes under. The sound of water
text: sloshes and laps against the hull.
dialog: 
text: The Skipper stares hopelessly at the water. Greg's pointed
text: hand trembles. He lowers it.
dialog: 
text: The Skipper shoves a lifejacket into Greg's chest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIPPER
dialog: Put it on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: What happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIPPER
dialog: Just do it, boy.
dialog: 
text: Greg does, fumbling.
scene_heading: GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The Skipper loads a flare gun and aims it overhead -- WHOOSH!
text: The glowing red beacon graffities the starry sky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COASTGUARD (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (VIA RADIO)
dialog: Merry Widow. Merry Widow. This is

dialog: 
text: The Skipper scans the glassy sea with a flashlight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIPPER
dialog: ROY?! ROY?!
dialog: 
text: Subtly at first, the buoy's bight of rope twinges. The
text: Skipper sees it. His eyes narrow --
dialog: 
text: -- it jerks like a fishing line. The Skipper grabs it and
text: reels it in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIPPER
dialog: C'mon, Roy, mate. Fight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
dialog: 
text: The buoy's rope moves towards the boat.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the trawler keels steeply. Greg grips the fittings
text: for support as debris rains on him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Jesus Christ!
scene_heading: GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COASTGUARD (O.S.)
dialog: Received Mayday, Merry Widow.
text: Emergency rescue team dispatched.
dialog: How many aboard? Over.
dialog: 
text: Water laps over Greg's feet as the boat rights itself. Greg

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
speaker_heading: (INTO MIC)
dialog: Please hurry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COASTGUARD (O.S.)
dialog: Hold your position, Merry Widow,
text: rescue chopper on its way. Over.
dialog: 
text: Greg drops the mic and edges outside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The deck swims with water. Greg holds his breath, listening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Skipper?
dialog: 
text: The abandoned C.B. mic swings to and fro. Almost playfully.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COASTGUARD (O.S.)
dialog: Merry Widow, how many aboard?
dialog: Over.
dialog: 
text: Greg rounds the pilothouse, breathing heavily.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly what looks like a weird, headless black snake feels
text: its way towards his boots. Greg turns and bolts.
dialog: 
text: He scrambles to the stern amongst the nets and snatches a
text: gutting-knife with both hands.
dialog: 
text: Trapped against the rail, panting, he prays for help but --
dialog: 
text: -- HE'S DRAGGED OVERBOARD. His legs round in the air as he
text: cascades into the sea.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Just beyond the Merry Widow, he surfaces gasping.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. Oh Jes--
dialog: 
text: He's gone.
scene_heading: GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011 6.

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING
dialog: 
text: CIARÁN O'SHEA lies face down on a sofa. His bed for the

text: RINGS. He stirs awake. It's no surprise he looks like
dialog: shite, but to be fair he's not bad looking after a wash.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: O'SHEA

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENIFICK'S VOICE

scene_heading: EXT. O'SHEA'S HOUSE - MORNING

text: An isolated house at the foothills of a mountain. A white

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ERIN ISLAND - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Lush green hills and whitewashed bungalows, pastel beaches

scene_heading: EXT. MARINA FERRY DOCK - DAY
dialog: 
text: Colourful crowds of FAMILIES (TEENS, KIDS, PARENTS) file onto

scene_heading: OILEÁN ÉIRINN, CÉAD MÍLE FÁILTE
dialog: Welcome to Erin Island
dialog: 
text: Lisa opens a map and wrestles with it in the wind. Soon

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Shit!
dialog: 
text: She chases it as if running down a mugger but it lifts
text: skyward and twirls haughtily in the air.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly inching towards her, driving with all the panache of
text: an abandoned shopping trolley, comes O'Shea. Bleary-eyed and
text: hunched over, he drops his window before her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: O'SHEA
dialog: Well?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Howya. O'Shea, is it? Ciarán? We
dialog: spoke on the phone. I'm Garda

speaker_heading: O'SHEA

scene_heading: INT. PATROL JEEP - DAY
dialog: 
text: Wincing, O'Shea hugs the wheel feeling every agonising bump.
text: A locket of Lisa's slick ponytail comes undone. She quickly
text: yanks it back giving herself a face lift in the process.
dialog: 
text: O'Shea belches under his breath and Lisa flinches. She pulls
text: a packet of mints from her bag.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Would you like a mint?
dialog: 
text: O'Shea stares at them, then at her. Barely reading the road.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: O'SHEA
dialog: Nah thanks, they give me heartburn.
dialog: 
text: He belches again as they jostle over another pothole. Lisa

speaker_heading: LISA

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENIFICK
dialog: So you can have my desk while I'm

speaker_heading: KENIFICK

dialog: You're gonna miss your boat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENIFICK
dialog: Slán.
dialog: 
text: Kenifick leaves. An uncomfortable silence fills the air like
text: two strangers in an elevator. Lisa sips her coffee. Hates

dialog: 
text: Kenifick barges back in and O'Shea falls over himself to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENIFICK
dialog: Won't go far with no tickets. See
dialog: you in a fortnight. Be good.

dialog: 
text: He squats down and gazes between the seaweed strewn cage.
text: Nothing to be seen thanks to the seaweed. He prods it and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SMITH

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: What is that thing?

speaker_heading: SMITH

speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: A Grabber.

speaker_heading: O'SHEA
dialog: You're not what?

speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Well basic tests I've done so far
dialog: have shown up nothing usual or

dialog: 
text: Paddy WHACKS it with his walking stick. Nothing.

speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: 'Tis dead.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LISA

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SMITH

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: That's not a tongue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: O'SHEA
dialog: It's a weapon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PADDY
text: It spits like a frog and strangles

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: I'm guessing it bleeds its prey

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: O'SHEA
dialog: Vampiro what?

speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Toothis. It's a rare deep sea

dialog: something totally different.
dialog: Something ... alien.
dialog: (off their looks)
text: In that it's undocumented.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: It's gotta be worth a fortune.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: But here's the thing...

text: Smith picks up a sponge, daubs it in a tray of water and --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: -- When I tried to clean some dirt
dialog: off of it --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: I stood on it a few times.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: -- this happened --
dialog: 
text: -- he delicately dabs the tip of a tentacle. The Grabber's
text: skin reacts, rehydrating. Smith watches it expectantly.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the tip twitches. Smith smiles at them.

speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: All this thing needs to survive is

speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Yeah, it's a female from what I can

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PADDY

speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: It's got no testicles.
dialog: 
text: A long silence, Paddy nods. I see.

speaker_heading: SMITH

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: That's disgusting.

speaker_heading: PADDY
text: Tides coming in. Another hour and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: O'SHEA
dialog: Wait here.

speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: You can be sure of it.
dialog: 
text: Lisa and O'Shea turn on their high beam flashlights and
text: venture into the cave, Mulder and Scully style.
dialog: 
text: Water drips from the cave walls while the sound of crashing
text: waves echoes throughout.
dialog: 
text: At the cave mouth, the dregs of a wave wash over Paddy's
text: boots. He looks into the cave, anxiously.
scene_heading: GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011 47.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Venturing further into the shadowy cave, Lisa finds an arched
text: entrance to the rising ocean as fog creeps around her feet.
dialog: 
text: O'Shea rounds some rocks, finding Lisa and seeing her

speaker_heading: LISA

text: They lift the flashlights and take in the horrifying sight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: O'SHEA
dialog: Run!
dialog: 
text: They take off, running for the slim cave mouth. Their lights
text: dancing in the darkness as they scramble for the exit --

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT./EXT. BEACH CAVE OPENING - DAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog:

speaker_heading: O'SHEA

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I'm trying!

speaker_heading: O'SHEA

dialog: 
text: O'Shea shoves harder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I swear to God, if you don't stop!
dialog: 
text: Lisa kicks back at him, but he keeps pushing. She tumbles
text: onto the seaweed strewn sands, drenched by the incoming tide,
text: as O'Shea squeezes through next. Soon, wedged in himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: O'SHEA
dialog: If I die in here I want you to know
dialog: it's all your fault!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Oh shut up.
dialog: 
text: Lisa wraps her arms around O'Shea, cheek-to-awkwardly-
text: intimate-cheek and pulls, dragging him loose. With effort.
dialog: 
text: The Grabber rushes towards O'Shea, gaining speed. Almost on
text: him when he escapes, seconds to spare.
dialog: 
text: BAM! The Grabber fills the gap in the rock face, trapped by
text: its own bulk. It snarls as one of its tentacles slithers out
text: towards them, but quickly retreats back inside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: The size of it.
dialog: 
text: They back up, horrified.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: O'SHEA
dialog: It's OK. It can't get us on dry
dialog: land. Not when it's not raining,
dialog: it can't.
dialog:

text: Paddy steps out of the way of an oncoming wave and kicks

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: Mother of God.
dialog: 
text: Eggs piled high like a fun fare ball pit. He barely has time
text: to process this as O'Shea and Lisa come bounding towards him.

speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: The eggs are buried on the beach!
dialog: There's feckin' loads of 'em!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LISA

text: And in the gouged out sand beneath their feet more exposed

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LAB - DAY
dialog: 
text: O'Shea, Lisa and Paddy stumble in, making a beeline for the

text: to see O'Shea who has a petrol can and a plan in mind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Good, you're back. I have a

speaker_heading: O'SHEA

speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: See ya later, lads.
dialog: 
text: Paddy scampers out as O'Shea, Lisa and Smith scramble for the
text: mains under the sink. Six hands fighting to shut it off.
text: Once they do, every surface drips. A fish-tank overflows.
dialog: 
text: They rise slowly from the slick floor. It's eerily quiet.
text: Smith picks up a stool. Lisa grabs a scalpel. O'Shea rolls
text: up a magazine. They creep forward.
scene_heading: GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011 51.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Careful. Once it's wet I don't
dialog: know what it can do.
dialog: 
text: O'Shea edges closer. It's unscathed from the fire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: O'SHEA
dialog: It didn't burn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Is it dead?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: O'SHEA
dialog: I --
dialog: 
text: BOOM! It launches to life, sprays O'Shea with goo and dives
text: onto him, wrapping around his face, head and neck.
dialog: 
text: Lisa and Smith leap to his aid and battle what looks like a
text: dozen boa constrictors working as one, choking him.
dialog: 
text: O'Shea flails and smashes into lab units, knocking a utility
text: closet open. Brooms and mops fall out as O'Shea slumps onto
text: the wet floor.
dialog: 
text: Lisa and Smith pull tentacles loose and O'Shea gasps for air.
text: His drained, ashen skin pocked with bleeding bite wounds.
dialog: 
text: Smith flings the limp Grabber across the lab and it hits the
text: wet floor, flopping woozily and vomiting blood.
dialog: 
text: It bears down on its tentacles and springs itself onto the
text: ceiling like an octopus shot out of an air cannon. SPLAT!
text: It hits the fluorescent light and hangs from it, upside down.
dialog: 
text: Smith blinks, agog.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: OK, it's an alien.
dialog: 
text: O'Shea feels his wounds. Furious, he grabs one of the mops
text: surrounding him and jabs at the Grabber with the handle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: O'SHEA
dialog: You vicious little fu--!
dialog: 
text: The Grabber bites down on the handle and hangs on. O'Shea
text: suddenly takes the full weight of it. It totters above their
text: heads, swaying. Lisa and Smith duck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Ah! Jesus! O'Shea!
scene_heading: GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011 52.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: O'Shea drops it onto the floor and Lisa yanks a steel cabinet
text: over, pinning it down. Trapped, the Grabber thrashes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: O'SHEA
dialog: We need to kill it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: No! You can't! It's the
dialog: scientific discovery of our time,
dialog: imagine all that we could learn
speaker_heading: FROM --
dialog: 
text: The cabinet flips, exposing the Grabber. Smith SCREAMS and
text: brains it with his stool. Scared shitless, O'Shea and Lisa
text: pile in with their boots. All three whacking and stamping
text: until they're sure it's dead.
dialog: 
text: Sweating and in shock, they catch their breath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SMITH

speaker_heading: O'SHEA

dialog: of them bit Paddy, it almost died,
dialog: why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: Slow down for fuck sake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Because Paddy was so intoxicated
dialog: his blood-alcohol level was toxic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: O'SHEA
dialog: Exactly. If we taint our blood

speaker_heading: SMITH
