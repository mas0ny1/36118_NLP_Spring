speaker_heading: SONG OVER:
dialog: 
text: Bobby, seated on the couch, a can of beer in hand,

dialog: 
scene_heading: A PORTABLE STEREO,
dialog: 
dialog: playing the song:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYNETTE (V.O.)
dialog: "And if you love him/Oh be proud of

dialog: man..."
dialog: 
scene_heading: RAYETTE DIPESTO,
dialog: 
text: in a waitress's uniform with a bowl of beer nuts.
text: After placing them on the coffee table in front of
text: him, she leans down and kisses him. Challenged by a
text: less than reciprocal response, she kisses him more
text: fervently. As she moves her lips from his ear to
text: his neck, he lifts the can to his mouth and drinks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYNETTE (V.O.)
dialog: "Stand by your man/And show the
dialog: world you love him/Keep giving all
dialog: the love you can/Stand by your
dialog: man."
dialog: 
text: The song concludes, and setting aside her ardor for
dialog: the moment:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: (Arky accent)
dialog: I'm gonna play it again...
dialog: 
text: As she starts for the stereo, he takes hold of her
dialog: hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You're not going to play it again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: Well, lemme play the other side
dialog: then.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: Again, he prevents her from moving to the stereo
text: and pulls her down onto the couch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: Now quit, Bobby. You said you're
dialog: goin' a help me pick a song.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You said.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: Well, lemme sing the one I picked
dialog: an' see what you think...
dialog: (she sings)
dialog: "When there's a fire in your
dialog: heart/Break the glass/Sound the
dialog: alarm..."
dialog: 
text: He picks up one of the couch pillows and holds it
text: over his ear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: Oh, you prick...
dialog: 
text: She pulls it from his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: How 'bout if I just cut off your
dialog: damn water?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'm too moved by your gentility to
dialog: speak.
dialog: 
text: She immediately softens and tries to become more
dialog: "refined."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: Sugar, you know how I feel about
dialog: you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to
dialog: get you to take an interest in my
dialog: kind a things, an' what I'm tryin'
dialog: to do with myself...
dialog: (bringing her face close
dialog: to his)
dialog: You know, there id'n anything in
dialog: the world I wouldn't do for you,
dialog: baby. I started livin' the day I
dialog: found you, you know that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You're playing the other side.
dialog: 
text: Very hurt, she sits up and looks away from him. He
text: finishes the beer and holds the can out to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Cerveza.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: (grabbing it from him)
dialog: Serveza yourself!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Now, now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: (she stands up)
dialog: No, dammit, I would easy.
dialog: 
text: And, as she turns and goes toward the kitchen:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: But you heal fast.
dialog: 
text: Through the open door to the kitchen, Rayette can
text: be seen opening the refrigerator. She takes out a
text: can of beer and returns to Bobby.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: (over the above)
dialog: You can play the piano, an' your
dialog: whole damn family can play on some
dialog: type a musical instrument. An' all
dialog: I'm askin' is for you to listen to
dialog: my singing for one single little
dialog: second...
dialog: 
text: She hands him the can and sits back down on the
dialog: couch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: But you think you would? No, you're
dialog: too damn selfish...
dialog: 
text: He gestures at the name tag on her dress, and, as
dialog: we'll find he often does, speaks in the Okie-Arky
dialog: accent he's learned from working the rigs:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Why'nt you take 'at sign off your
dialog: tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: Out where?
dialog: 
text: She sits down and begins removing the tag.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I don't know, I'll holler up Elton
dialog: an' Stoney...
dialog: 
text: She thinks about it, then moves closer to him and
text: begins unbuttoning his workshirt, as:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: I'll go out with you, or I'll stay
dialog: here, and do anything you'd like
dialog: for me to do... if you'll just do
dialog: one thing. If you'll tell me that
dialog: you love me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You can sing the song.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: You know what, you are never
dialog: satisfied.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That's right, hand.
dialog: 
text: The response makes her deeply insecure and she
text: immediately lays her body against his...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: Oh, now, baby...
dialog: 
text: ... and initiates another round of kissing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bobby lifts his ball from the return rack, moves to
text: the lane and bowls a perfect strike. Making a self
text: congratulatory gesture of triumph, he turns back
dialog: to:
dialog: 
text: Elton, seated at the scoring table. His wife,
text: STONEY, is seated beside Rayette on the horseshoe
text: banquette. As he addresses Rayette, we note that
text: Elton's two front teeth are missing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELTON
dialog: (Okie accent)
dialog: Your ball, Ray.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: (reluctant)
dialog: Is this suppose to be fun?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Go on, get up there...
dialog: 
text: She rises and moves to the rack.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: ... and stay relaxed this time.
dialog: 
text: Picking up ball, she moves to the head of the lane
text: and slings it down the alley, watching hopefully
dialog: as...
dialog: 
text: ... it rolls off to the right and takes only one
dialog: pin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON BOBBY
dialog: 
text: as she moves to her second ball.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Now don't loft it, just release it
dialog: like I told you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON RAYETTE
dialog: 
text: as she bowls the ball down the right-hand rut and
text: comes back to the banquette, apologizing:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: The ball's too heavy for me,
dialog: honey...
dialog: 
text: He looks past her to Stoney, about to bowl her
dialog: ball.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: It's not the damn ball.
dialog: 
text: And as Stoney bowls a strike, Rayette hugs his arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: I'm tryin', baby, so don't start
dialog: gettin' mad now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll
dialog: be all right. Just spot and follow
dialog: through...
dialog: 
text: And as Elton bowls a strike...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: Shit.
dialog: 
text: He gets up and passes Elton on his way to the rack.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice ball, El.
dialog: 
text: Rayette, to Stoney as she watches Bobby prepare to
dialog: bowl:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: Id'n he somethin' to see?
dialog: 
text: And as he makes another strike and returns to the
text: banquette, she gets up and throws her arms around
text: him. He returns her embrace, smiling over her
dialog: shoulder at:
dialog: 
text: Two heavily made-up young women (TWINKY and BETTY)
text: taking possession of the adjacent lane. (Note that
text: Betty is of diminutive proportions, while Twinky is
dialog: Amazonian.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Is it my turn again?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Right. Now show me a little
dialog: somethin' this time, okay? Give me
dialog: some form...
dialog: 
text: He remains standing, watching as she throws another
text: gutter ball and then comes back toward him, alibi
dialog: ing:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: I can't help it, honey, the ball
dialog: just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on
dialog: me...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Will you just do what the hell I
dialog: tell you...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: I did, didn' I, El?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You got another ball comin'.
dialog: 
text: She moves to the rack and, concentrating hard,
text: advances down the lane and releases the ball. It
text: rolls slowly down the center, hits at precisely the
text: right spot and clears the pins.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELTON
dialog: Atta boy, Ray!
dialog: 
text: Ecstatic, she comes back to the banquette, seating
text: herself beside Bobby and trying to solicit a
text: response from him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: That was damn good, wad'n it? I
dialog: finally did it...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, great.
dialog: (begins removing his
dialog: bowling shoes)
dialog: Why don't you throw Z's for 19
text: frames, and then roll a strike on
text: the last ball in the last frame of
dialog: a losing game? Just wonderful.
dialog: 
text: Turning to address the two young women over the
text: back of the banquette.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wasn't it, ladies?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TWINKY
dialog: (pointing at herself)
dialog: Are you talking to us?
dialog: 
text: Rayette pulls off her rental shoes and throws them
text: to the floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: I'm gonna go wait in the car.
dialog: 
text: He stretches his arms out on the back of the
text: banquette as though he intends to reside there
dialog: awhile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, why don't you do that.
dialog: 
text: She grabs her sling-back and her purse and as she
dialog: gets up:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STONEY
dialog: Wait an I'll I go with you,
dialog: honey...
dialog: 
text: As she picks up her belongings and follows Rayette:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELTON
dialog: (changing his shoes)
dialog: We gotta get on home an' relieve
dialog: the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come
text: on over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for
dialog: the beers...
dialog: (hands him the bowling
dialog: shoes)
dialog: An' walk Rayette over with you,
dialog: will you.
dialog: 
text: Elton moves off and Bobby, now full of remorse,
text: slumps into a depressed reverie. Beyond him, Betty
text: and Twinky, can be seen, engaged in some discussion
dialog: concerning him.
dialog: 
text: A WAITRESS with a tray approaches and leans down to
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Can I get you anything else?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No. How much do I owe you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Five'll do it.
dialog: 
text: He takes some loose bills from his pocket and lays
text: them on her tray. She thanks him and moves off. As
text: he reaches down and pulls on one of his boots,
text: Twinky approaches behind him and leans down over
text: the back of the banquette.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TWINKY
dialog: We been wantin' to ask you
dialog: something. Are you the guy on YV?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Am I on TV?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TWINKY
dialog: (pointing lo Betty)
dialog: She says you're the one that sells
text: all the cars on TV.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Well, I don't claim to have sold
dialog: 'em all. They still have some left,
dialog: I believe.
dialog: 
text: Betty appears on the other side of the banquette.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: See, I told you it was him...
dialog: (then to Bobby)
dialog: Your name's Donnie something,
dialog: right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I leave it to you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: My name is Shirley, but they call
dialog: me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (looking to Twinky)
dialog: Twinky?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (explaining)
dialog: Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (looking from one to the
dialog: other)
dialog: Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is
dialog: nice talking to you girls. I just
dialog: wish I had more time...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (touching his hair)
dialog: A wig?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yeah, I told her it was you, but
dialog: that you're wearing a wig, 'cause
dialog: on TV you're mostly bald in the
dialog: front.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (to Twinky)
dialog: Your little friend's real sharp
dialog: there...
dialog: (to Betty)
dialog: Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig
dialog: on TV, because with two and a half
dialog: million people watching you, you've
dialog: gotta be sincere. I just like to
dialog: wear it when I'm out slippin'
dialog: around bowling alleys an' things
dialog: like that. I think it gives me a
dialog: little more class, don't you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TWINKY
dialog: Oh, definitely...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (looking at his hairline)
dialog: Yeah, but I can see a little bitty
dialog: of the net up there, that's what
dialog: give it away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TWINKY
dialog: It's so weird to see you in person,
dialog: but that's who she says you are.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (to her)
dialog: It is him, he said it's him.
dialog: (to Bobby)
dialog: Aren't you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, you could say it's me.
dialog: 
text: Twinky reaches over to the scoring table, picking
text: up a pencil and a score sheet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TWINKY
dialog: I'm gonna give you our number,
dialog: Donnie, just in case...
dialog: (as she writes)
dialog: We're both professionals, if you
dialog: didn't guess.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Well, you seem very professional...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TWINKY
dialog: (handing the score sheet
dialog: to him)
dialog: I always tell everyone the same
dialog: thing. I got rolled and beat up
dialog: real bad recently, and since then
dialog: it's two for one, an' I work
dialog: strictly in tandem with Betty...
dialog: 
text: He glances at the dwarfish Betty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, I can see how she'd come in
dialog: handy.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE

dialog: No response.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, DiPesto. We can still have

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: You're the pathetic one, not me.

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'm going on over there...

speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: I'm not some piece a crap.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY

speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: You treat me like I was.

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: (close to tears)
dialog: You go slippin' around in front a

speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RAYETTE

dialog: 
text: ... Elton, who rides Betty on his leg as both sing

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DINER - LATE NIGHT
dialog:

dialog:

speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: It's the truth.
dialog:

speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)

dialog: 
text: Bobby can be seen in the b.g., having difficulty

speaker_heading: SECOND ENGINEER
dialog: I'd like to remind you again, this
dialog: isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECOND ENGINEER
dialog: If you want to call it that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Well, you have to simply tell me,

speaker_heading: SECOND ENGINEER
dialog: That's exactly what I am doing,

speaker_heading: TITA

speaker_heading: SECOND ENGINEER

speaker_heading: TITA

speaker_heading: FIRST ENGINEER

speaker_heading: TITA

speaker_heading: SECOND ENGINEER

speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: I just can't look at you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Don't, then.
dialog: 
text: As she blows her nose into the tissue, a young man

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: You always do this to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Well, I don't mean to.

speaker_heading: TITA

speaker_heading: BOBBY

speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Well, 11 months ago he was on his

speaker_heading: PALM
dialog: In my personal thing, I don't see
dialog: that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot
dialog: of filth. What they need to do
dialog: every day, no, once in a while, is

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Well...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PALM
dialog: It's just filthy. People are dirty.
dialog: I think that's the biggest thing
dialog: that's wrong with people. I think

dialog: wouldn't have anybody to pick on...
dialog: Oofh... Dirt...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: Well...

speaker_heading: PALM
dialog: Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PALM
dialog: People... Oofh...
dialog: (shaking her head in utter
dialog: disgust)
dialog: Animals are not like that...
dialog: They're always cleaning themselves.
dialog: Did you ever see... What are they
dialog: called? Pigeons!
dialog: 
text: She looks over at Terry, slumped in her seat,
dialog: asleep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PALM (CONT'D)
dialog: He's always picking on himself and
dialog: his friends. They're always picking
text: bugs out of their hair...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON RAYETTE
dialog: 
dialog: asleep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PALM (O.S.)
dialog: Monkeys, too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON PALM
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PALM
dialog: Except monkeys do things out in the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON BOBBY
dialog: 
text: benumbed, his eyes glazed over as he stares out
text: through the windshield.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON PALM
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PALM
dialog: I was in this place once, this
dialog: store, with snakes, monkeys,
dialog: everything you could imagine. I
dialog: walked in, I had to run out. It
dialog: stunk! They didn't even have an
dialog: incense going...
dialog: 
text: Though no one listens, she goes on, working herself
dialog: up:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PALM
dialog: And you know, I read where they
dialog: invented this car that runs on...
dialog: that runs on... when you boil
dialog: water...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (half-dead)
dialog: Steam.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PALM
dialog: Right, steam. A car you could ride
text: around in and not cause a stink.
dialog: But do you know, they will not even
dialog: let us have it. Can you believe it?
dialog: Why?! Man! He likes to create a
dialog: stink. I wrote them a note once,
dialog: and told them to clean it... I
dialog: mean, don't you see that? It's just
dialog: filthy! I mean, I've seen filth you
dialog: wouldn't believe! Oofh, what a
dialog: stink! I don't even want to talk
dialog: about it...

dialog: 
scene_heading: ON PALM AND TERRY
dialog: 
text: deposited at the side of the highway, with their
text: luggage, duffle bags and television set lying on

scene_heading: EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - MOTEL - NIGHT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (MUSIC FADES, AS:)
dialog: 
text: The car pulls into a motel parking slot and stops.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bobby and Rayette in bed. She lies on her side,
text: watching him watch TV. After a moment:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: Are you depressed about your daddy,
dialog: honey?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Is what you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: You're depressed that I come along.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Who said I was depressed?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: Well, is that a happy face I see?
dialog: 
dialog: No response.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE (CONT'D)
dialog: 'Cause if it was me, I could just
text: catch a Greyhound back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Oh, you're not going to kill
dialog: yourself this time. I wish I'd
dialog: known...
dialog: 
text: He turns off the light on the night stand and rolls
text: onto his side, faced away from her.
dialog: 
text: They lie silently in the dark for a moment. Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: I don't know if I'm gonna be able
dialog: to sleep or not.
dialog: 
dialog: No response.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE (CONT'D)
dialog: (looking over at him)
dialog: Hint, hint.
dialog: 
dialog: No response.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE (CONT'D)
dialog: (sighing; then:)
dialog: I guess I'll just have to count the
dialog: sheep.
dialog: (closing her eyes)
dialog: One-two-three-four...
dialog: 
text: She opens her eyes and looks over at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Seven... eight...
dialog: (caressing his shoulder)
dialog: Look at this old cold shoulder,
dialog: what am I gonna do with it?
dialog: 
text: He looks around at her and with gentle good humor:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: If you just wouldn't open your
dialog: mouth, everything would be fine.
dialog: 
text: She turns an imaginary key at her lips.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
text: Tick a lock.
dialog: 
text: He rolls over to face her and, yielding to her
text: request, begins to make love to ber.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Rayette following after Bobby. As he moves to his
text: car, he removes some cash from his wallet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: Why can't I go out to your folks'
dialog: house? Give me one good reason.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I have to see how things are first.
dialog: My father's sick, you understand?
dialog: They wouldn't be prepared for me
dialog: bringing anyone.
dialog: 
text: He holds out a roll of bills and as she takes them:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: So how long am I supposed to sit
dialog: an' twiddle my thumbs in this
dialog: place?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: If you can't do what I ask, Ray,
dialog: use that money to go back home,
dialog: then.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: Bobby, don't talk like that...
dialog: 
text: She moves over to him and gives him a quick kiss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE (CONT'D)
dialog: It'll be all right, I'll get a hold
dialog: a some magazines an' things like
dialog: that. An' maybe find a beauty salon
dialog: an' get my hair fixed, okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON BOBBY
dialog: 
text: getting into the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Okay, Ray...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: Or maybe sit out by the pool an'
dialog: get myself nice an' tan for you.
dialog: Would you like that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (starting the engine)
dialog: Sure...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: It brings out my eyes...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Bye, honey, I'll call you in a
dialog: couple of days.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: Okay...

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Bye, baby...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FERRY (CROSSING) - DAY
dialog: 
text: Bobby gets out of his car and wanders the deck of
text: the ferry. He stops to look out over the Sound to
text: one of the islands off the Washington coast, then
text: glances back to the mainland, receding in the
dialog: distance.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - FERRY LANDING - DAY
dialog: 
text: Bobby drives off the ferry onto the island.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
dialog: 
text: The car moves over a tree-lined country lane and
text: presently turns off onto a private road, leading to
text: a large Victorian-style house. It pulls to a stop
text: behind two other cars.
dialog: 
text: Bobby gets out of the car and moves up the porch
text: steps to the front door.
dialog: 
text: CLOSER ON him as he hesitates, listening briefly to
text: the FAINT SOUND of two pianos coming from within.
dialog: 
text: Then he opens the door and goes inside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DUPEA HOME - DAY
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (TWO PIANOS OVER:)
dialog: 
text: Bobby tentatively wanders the first floor of the
text: house, taking in the ghosts of the past.
dialog: 
text: In the living room, he pauses at a table to look at
text: several framed photographs. He picks up one of his
text: mother and father, looks closely at it, then gently
text: returns it to its place and resumes wandering.
dialog: 
text: He stops at the music room and looks in through the
text: half-opened door:
dialog: 
scene_heading: POV INTO MUSIC ROOM:
dialog: 
text: On the far side of the room, near windows which
text: give view to a verdant exterior, are two concert
text: grands. His brother CARL is seated at one of the
text: pianos, and a young woman (CATHERINE VAN OOST) is
text: seated at the other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON BOBBY
dialog: 
text: looking from Carl, to Catherine. He watches her
text: briefly, then steps out of the doorway...
dialog: 
text: ... and moves down a hallway to a closed door. He
text: reaches down and opens it, looking inside to:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: 
text: grooming the hair of an elderly man (NICHOLAS
text: DUPEA) seated in a wheelchair with his back to
dialog: Bobby.
dialog: 
text: She looks up and, seeing Bobby, smiles happily,
text: then reaches down and turns the wheelchair around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON NICHOLAS
dialog: 
text: His eyes are half-closed and are cast down to the
dialog: floor.
dialog: 
text: Bobby moves over to him, bending down and looking
text: into his face. Nicholas opens his eyes slightly and
text: gazes through Bobby into an absolute elsewhere.
dialog: 
text: Bobby raises his eyes to Tita.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: He doesn't even know who the hell I
dialog: am.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DUPEA DINING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Nicholas Dupea sits at the head of the table, being
text: fed his dinner by a male nurse (SPICER).
dialog: 
text: Bobby, at the opposite end of the table, is seated
text: next to Tita. Unable to bear looking at his father,
text: he glances over at Catherine, seated next to Carl
text: on his right.
dialog: 
text: She raises her eyes from her plate to ask him
text: something, just as Tita is moved to reminisce:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Remember, Bobby, what mother used
dialog: to say when...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (to Bobby)
dialog: How long have you been...
dialog: (To Tita)
dialog: Oh, excuse me...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: No, it's all right, you go ahead...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I was just going to ask Robert how
dialog: long he's been away from here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Four or five years.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: No, the last time was three years
dialog: ago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Oh no, it's been much more than
dialog: that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Away from the piano, Tita, you have
dialog: no sense of time at all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: I don't think that's true.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: It is true.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Besides being very rude.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: What have you been doing since
dialog: then?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What have I been doing? Different
dialog: things, different jobs, here and
dialog: there. Nothing that interesting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: And you no longer play at all?
dialog: 
text: Bobby starts to reply and is interrupted by:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You know, just after I came back
dialog: off tour with the Betenthaller
dialog: Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert
dialog: had a summit conference about
dialog: you...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Oh, my, "a summit conference." I
dialog: wonder where I was, polishing
text: silver behind the coal bin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I don't know where you were, penis
dialog: envy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: I hope I didn't hear that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a
dialog: private detective to ferret you
dialog: out, and I said, "What for?"
dialog: Whatever the hell he's doing, even
dialog: if it's a completely wasteful
dialog: escapade, it's entirely his
dialog: business. Simple as that...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: I don't think you should infer
dialog: Daddy was wrong in front of him...
dialog: 
text: She looks at Spicer, pushing a spoon at Nicholas's
text: closed mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't force him like that, Spicer.
dialog: 
text: Spicer lays the spoon down and begins eating his
dialog: own dinner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (to Catherine)
dialog: How long have you been staying
dialog: here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: A couple of months.
dialog: 
text: He starts to ask another question and is again
dialog: overridden by:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Did you hear about my misfortune,
dialog: Robert?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: It's still nearly impossible for me
dialog: to turn my neck. If I wanted to
dialog: turn toward Catherine, for
dialog: instance, I'd first have to twist
dialog: the whole base of my body around...
dialog: (demonstrating)
dialog: ... like this...
dialog: 
text: Tita gets up from the table and, taking her plate,
text: exits to the kitchen. And as Carl readjusts himself
text: in his chair and takes a sip from his wine glass,
text: Bobby looks at Catherine to find her looking at
text: him. She quickly alters her gaze to Carl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I wouldn't mind doing a little
dialog: work, if you're finished, and not
dialog: too tired...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: No, I'm finished...
text: (placing a hand on his
dialog: stomach)
dialog: Satiety is my father and mother.
dialog: 
text: Finding he's amused himself and nobody else, he
text: gets up and addresses Bobby.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: She's tremendously gifted, this
dialog: girl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (looking at her)
dialog: Is she?
dialog: 
text: Catherine stands up and, wanting to change the
dialog: subject:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Excuse me, I don't want to hear
dialog: this...
dialog: 
text: She exits and Carl, on his way out, pauses at
text: Bobby's chair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I hope you feel at home, Robert.
dialog: (patting him on the
dialog: shoulder)
dialog: I'm really glad you're here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Thanks, Carl...
dialog: 
text: He looks down table to see Spicer stacking his
text: plate onto Nicholas's and his eyes follow him as
text: he, too, moves out of the dining room to the
dialog: kitchen.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON BOBBY
dialog: 
text: in extreme discomfort at being left alone with his
text: father. He looks down at his plate, poking at the
text: remainder of his dinner, then braves a look down
dialog: the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON NICHOLAS
dialog: 
text: looking back at him, his eyes devoid of interest or
dialog: cognition.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DUPEA GROUNDS - DAY
dialog: 
text: Bobby and Tita walk away from the house down toward
text: the ocean. Accompanying them is a Borzoi hound
text: belonging to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: He has ways of communicating,
dialog: Robert. I can tell when he's
dialog: expressing approval or disapproval,
dialog: just from his eyes...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Uhm hmm. Some range.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: It's not that bad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yes, it is. I can't take seeing
text: him, sitting there like a stone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: A week or two isn't going to ruin
dialog: your life, for Godsakes.
dialog: 
text: He doesn't respond.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, you think I'm that happy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No, I don't.
dialog: (a pause, then:)
dialog: You should've left a long time ago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: We can't all get up and leave, can
dialog: we? I mean, there are certain needs
dialog: you have to respond to...
dialog: 
text: She stops walking and moves to one of the garden
text: chairs, facing out toward the bay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA (CONT'D)
dialog: And anyway, I want you to stay, so
dialog: I can spend some time with you, and
dialog: ask you some questions...
dialog: 
text: He leans his back against a tree.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What questions?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Well, do you -- I mean, have you
dialog: enjoyed all these... strange things
dialog: you've been doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Sometimes.
dialog: 
text: She stares at him for a moment, and taking note of
dialog: it:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Why? Am I some kind of freak to you
dialog: or something?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: No, no, I don't think that, I'm
dialog: just curious about it...
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: Do you think I'm a freak?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Sort of.
dialog: 
text: She laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I
dialog: look?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No, I don't really think you're a
dialog: freak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: I probably am, but I don't care. I
dialog: mean, I wasn't that blessed to
dialog: begin with, and when would I have
dialog: had time to make any
dialog: improvements...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What about Carl and Catherine? Is
dialog: he just coaching her, or what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
text: Constantly. Night and day. And
dialog: unless I get up before the birds, I
dialog: can't get in any practice time for
dialog: myself...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Uhm hmm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Actually, it's very admirable, the
dialog: way she works. She'll probably be
dialog: enormously successful, because
dialog: she's attractive as well, not that
dialog: that's so important in music,
dialog: but...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You're attractive, Tita. If you
dialog: just did a little more with
dialog: yourself...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Like what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Well, if you just maybe did
dialog: something with your hair, or...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Oh, let's not talk about my hair,
dialog: it does what it wants to, and
dialog: anyway, who cares, I want to talk
dialog: about you...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: There's nothing to say, Tita...
dialog: 
text: He offers nothing further and looks out over the
text: bay. Then, after a brief silence:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Well, you're not going to run out
dialog: on me right away, are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DUPEA HOME - DAY
dialog: 
text: Bobby strolls casually about the house - in truth,
text: looking for an opportunity to run into Catherine.
dialog: 
text: He moves to the music room and looks inside.
dialog: 
text: THROUGH THE DOORWAY
dialog: 
text: Catherine can be seen, seated at the piano. Carl
text: stands above her and they engage in some exchange
text: about the score resting on the piano's music stand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON BOBBY
dialog: 
text: as he moves down the hallway and sees:
dialog: 
text: Spicer descending the staircase, with the brittle
text: Nicholas in his arms.
dialog: 
text: He ducks into the nearest room to avoid them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DEN - DUPEA HOME - DAY
dialog: 
text: Tita, startled in the act of appraising herself in
text: a mirror above the fireplace, turns around to
dialog: Bobby:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Oh God, don't sneak up on me like
dialog: that!
dialog: 
text: We see she wears a little make-up and has done
text: something "different" with her hair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: 
text: He turns and exits the den.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DUPEA HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Bobby stands on the front porch, looking toward...
dialog: 
text: ... Catherine coming up from the ocean. She wears a
text: bathrobe over a wet bathing suit and carries a
text: towel, and as she approaches:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Hello...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I guess you fell in the water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Yes, intentionally.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That's dangerous, you know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Swimming?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Playing piano all day and then
dialog: jumping into cold water. You could
dialog: get a cramp.
dialog: 
text: She laughs and begins drying her hair with a corner
dialog: of the towel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I love to swim, and I don't mind
text: the cold at all. It's invigorating.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Well, I wouldn't want to get too
dialog: invigorated myself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What would I do with it? Run amok?
dialog: 
text: She comes up the stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Besides piano and swimming, what
dialog: else do you do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Well, there's fishing and boating.
dialog: There's concerts on the mainland
dialog: and... but I feel silly telling
dialog: you. This is really your home. You
dialog: probably know better than I what
dialog: there is to do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Nothing? Then it must be very
dialog: boring for you here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That's right. Have you anything to
dialog: suggest?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I don't know. Let me give it some
dialog: thought.
dialog: 
text: She moves toward the front door, with Bobby
dialog: following.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What're you doing right now...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DUPEA HOME - DAY
dialog: 
text: Catherine comes inside and moves toward the
text: stairway, with Bobby behind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Right now I'm going to run a hot
dialog: tub and soak myself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Then after that?
dialog: 
text: She goes up a few steps and turns back to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: After that, I plan to read some
dialog: music and rest for awhile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Tomorrow, then.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Tomorrow's a full practice day...
dialog: (continues up the stairs)
text: But the day after is kind of open.
dialog: 
text: At the top of the stairs, she stops and looks down
text: at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE (CONT'D)
text: Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (as if it were a year)
dialog: The day after tomorrow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: If you're free.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, I'll probably be free.
dialog: 
text: She turns and disappears into the second-floor
dialog: hallway.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DUPEA KITCHEN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Dinner has concluded and Tita moves around the
text: table, distributing cups and saucers. Carl is
text: remote and off his feed. Spicer attends Nicholas,
text: and Catherine looks across the table to Bobby as he
text: drinks from a bottle of beer.
text: After a moment, a loud belch comes from Nicholas
dialog: and Tita quickly requests:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Don't laugh...
dialog: 
text: She attempts to stifle her own amusement, as do
text: Bobby and Catherine, then changes the subject:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate
dialog: anything...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I took some aspirin and it really
dialog: upset my stomach.
dialog: 
text: Catherine begins pouring the coffee.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: One thing that's hard to understand
dialog: is how you could have this
dialog: incredible background in music, and
dialog: then just walk away from it,
dialog: without a second thought...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I gave it a second thought.
dialog: 
text: Tita seats herself at the table, addressing Spicer:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: He looks tired to me, Spicer. I
dialog: think you should put him to bed.
dialog: 
text: He nods, and as he gets up and wheels Nicholas from
dialog: the room:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I mean, how could you not play
dialog: anymore? That's so strange to me...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I have played a few times. Here and
dialog: there. As a matter of fact, I was
dialog: once a rehearsal pianist for a Las
text: Vegas musical revue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: You don't call that music, though.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Of course I do. It's music. You
dialog: know...
dialog: 
text: He places his hands on the table and simulates the
text: playing of a rousing production-type show-stopper,
text: simultaneously vocalizing as he does.
dialog: 
text: Though Tita and Catherine are amused, Carl winces
text: disapprovingly and breaks into Bobby's act:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Robert, do you mind?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Nothing. Will you excuse us for a
dialog: while?
dialog: 
text: He takes hold of Catherine's hand and stands up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: We really don't have to, Carl, if
dialog: you're not feeling good...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (a bit martyred)
dialog: Well, maybe if we put the
dialog: Thermaphore on me for a while,
dialog: first...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Oh, all right.
dialog: 
text: And as they move to the door, she glances
text: apologetically back at Bobby.
dialog: 
text: Deflated and embarrassed, he looks away from Tita's
text: sympathetic gaze. After a brief silence, she
text: reaches to a platter on the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Do you want some gingerbread?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (elsewhere)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: With applesauce?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No, thanks...

scene_heading: INT. DUPEA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bobby stands in the living room. It is dark and the
text: only light comes from some burning logs in the
text: fireplace. He listens briefly to the sounds of a
text: Beethoven sonata coming from the music room...
dialog: 
text: ... then moves to a chaise near the fireplace and
text: lies down, staring absently into the flames. After
text: a moment, he closes his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
dialog: 
text: on his sleeping face as the sonata begins to FADE.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DUPEA LIVING ROOM - MORNING
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON BOBBY
dialog: 
text: still asleep in the chaise. He is suddenly jolted
text: awake by a loud thud and sits up, looking out the
dialog: window to:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POV OF SPICER
dialog: 
text: lifting a barbell with heavy weights attached to
text: it. He does a series of vigorous presses with it,
text: before he again lets the bar drop heavily onto the
dialog: porch.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DUPEA HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL - DAY
dialog: 
scene_heading: (BACH VIOLIN OVER:)
dialog: 
text: Bobby stands in the hallway, a phone to his ear,
text: listening to Rayette and looking down the hall
text: toward the open door to Catherine's room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, well fine, you know what I
dialog: suggest, Ray...
dialog: (listening)
dialog: Because I don't know how long.
dialog: Things are not going that well
dialog: here...
dialog: 
text: He listens again, his eyes on Catberine, moving
text: around in her room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, well I'm not having any fun,
dialog: either, so why don't you...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: No, you can't, it's just not
dialog: convenient, and I have to get
dialog: off...
dialog: (listening impatiently)
dialog: Ray, I really have to go, I have to
dialog: get off now...
dialog: (longer pause)
dialog: Another couple of days, maybe. I'll
dialog: call you and let you --
dialog: (pause)
dialog: All right, if you're gone, you're
dialog: gone. Now I have to get off, okay?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Bye, Ray...
dialog: 
text: He hangs up and, as he starts down the hall to
text: Catherine's room, the VIOLIN STOPS and Carl steps
text: out into the hall ahead of him. He carries his
dialog: fiddle and detains Bobby, with:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
text: Only 10 minutes of playing and it's
dialog: already killing my neck...
dialog: 
text: Bobby looks past him to Catherine as she glances
text: out at them and then closes the door to her room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DUPEA GROUNDS - DAY
dialog: 
text: Bobby and Carl, playing a game of table tennis.
text: Tita stands leaning against a tree, watching them.
text: In the b.g., Spicer can be seen, meticulously
text: oiling and cleaning the wheelchair.
dialog: 
text: As they volley the ball back and forth:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You sure you should be playing,
dialog: Carl?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What do you mean? Aside from my
dialog: neck, I'm in superb shape.
dialog: 
text: Carl hits into the net, and as the ball rebounds to
text: him, he tosses it to Bobby.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (serving)
dialog: I don't know, there's something
dialog: wrong with the way you move.
dialog: 
text: Carl hits the net again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I'm not aware of it. Like what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
dialog: 
text: Carl serves and as they volley:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd hate to see you walk across a
dialog: concert stage like that.
dialog: 
text: Carl tries a smash and mis-hits the ball...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Two -- Nineteen.
dialog: 
text: ... and as he retrieves it:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (irritated with Bobby)
dialog: I've walked across a stage a number
dialog: of times, without exciting any
dialog: particular response...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That's what I mean...
dialog: 
text: Carl comes back to the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Any particular humor, I meant.
dialog: 
text: He angrily serves the ball.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (returning)
dialog: I think you should get someone to
dialog: coach you how to walk. I think it's
dialog: a substantial problem.
dialog: 
text: He hits a smash and it sails past Carl into some
text: shrubbery several yards away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Dammit!
dialog: 
text: As he moves after the ball, Bobby gestures at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Look at that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Why are you being so mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't
dialog: you see that?
dialog: 
text: She looks at Carl, bent over and searching through
dialog: the shrubs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: I don't think I'd notice. I'm so
dialog: used to Carl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (wanting to go on about
dialog: it)
dialog: Yeah, well, he's...
dialog: 
text: She interrupts him, looking toward Spicer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Bobby? Do you think Spicer is
dialog: attractive?
dialog: 
text: He looks over at Spicer, polishing the frame of the
dialog: wheelchair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I think he's got a terrific
dialog: personality.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: You know, he was formerly a sailor.
dialog: 
text: Bobby gestures his paddle at Carl, on his way back
text: with the ball.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Look, can't you see that, what I'm
dialog: talking about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
dialog: 
text: Carl comes up to the table, asserting:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: See? There's nothing wrong with the
dialog: way I walk. Now where are we?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
text: At game, Carl.
dialog: 
text: Carl serves and they volley briefly. Then BobbY
text: angles the ball sharply and puts it away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: That's three games to none, Carl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: All right, let's have a rematch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I thought you had to go to the
dialog: mainland today. Aren't you going to
dialog: miss the ferry?
dialog: 
text: Carl takes a quick glance at his watch, then drops
text: his paddle onto the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Too bad. Just when I was hitting my
dialog: stride.
dialog: 
text: He starts away, then turns back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Say goodbye to Catherine for me,
dialog: will you?
dialog: 
text: As he moves off in the direction of the cars, Tita
text: comes up beside Bobby.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Can I play now?
dialog: 
text: Carl calls over to them from his car:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Tell her I'll be back sometime
dialog: tomorrow!
dialog: 
text: Bobby turns to Tita.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Where is she, anyway?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: (ignoring the question)
dialog: My turn.
dialog: 
text: He hands her the paddle...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Why don't you and Spicer play?
dialog: 
text: ... and moves off toward the house.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DUPEA HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL - DAY
dialog: 
text: Bobby knocks on Catherine's door and, hearing no
text: response, opens it and steps inside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CATHERINE'S ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: He wanders about, discreetly touching nothing, but
dialog: taking in some essence of Catherine from her
text: belongings and from the scent of her that lingers
text: in the room.
dialog: 
text: His journey brings him into proximity with the
text: windows and he pauses to look out at:
dialog: 
scene_heading: TITA AND SPICER BELOW
dialog: 
text: playing table tennis.
dialog: 
text: He starts to move from the windows, when he sees:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE'S CAR
dialog: 
text: pulling into view and parking near the garage. She
text: gets out, and, carrying a shopping bag and a
text: wrapped bouquet of flowers, pauses on her way to
text: the house to have some exchange with Tita.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DUPEA HOME - STAIRCASE - DAY
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON BOBBY
dialog: 
text: quickly descending the staircase, and FOLLOWING
text: with him as he moves to the music room and goes
text: inside, leaving the door open.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: He crosses to one of the grands, seats himself and
text: rubs his hands together to warm them. Then,
text: scanning his mental repertoire, he places his hands
text: on the keyboard and begins to play a Chopin etude.
dialog: 
text: Presently, Catherine appears in the doorway. She
text: stands listening for a moment, then places the
text: shopping bag and flowers on a settee near the
text: doorway and crosses to a chair near the pianos and
text: sits down.
dialog: 
text: Bobby glances at her, then returns his eyes to the
dialog: keyboard.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON CATHERINE
dialog: 
text: her features intensely concentrated, as she listens
text: to his playing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON BOBBY
dialog: 
text: apparently deep into the music. On the wall behind
text: him are the series of photographs seen in the
text: opening and the present ANGLE FAVORS an 8-year-old

dialog: 
text: THE CAMERA MOVES down to his hands...
dialog: 
text: ... then to Catherine, profoundly moved.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE INCLUDING BOTH
dialog: 
text: as Bobby plays the concluding chords of the etude.
text: He lets his hands linger on the keys until the last
text: overtones fade, then he removes them to his lap.
dialog: 
text: After a brief silence:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: That was beautiful, Robert. I'm
dialog: surprised...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I was really very moved by the way
dialog: you...
dialog: 
text: Unable to keep up the "serious" musician pose, a
text: brief, derisive laugh issues from him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that funny?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: It wasn't supposed to be, it just
dialog: struck me that way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Nothing. It's just that... I picked
dialog: the easiest piece I could remember.
dialog: I think I first played it when I
dialog: was 8 years old and I played it
dialog: better then.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: It doesn't matter. It was the
dialog: feeling I was affected by.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I didn't have any.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: You had no inner feeling?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: None.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Then I must have been supplying it.
dialog: 
text: She gets up and crosses toward the settee.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Wait...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Well, at least you're accomplished
dialog: at something...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
text: At being a fake.
dialog: 
text: And as she picks up the flowers and the shopping
dialog: bag:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Catherine...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: No, you're very good at it. I'm
dialog: really impressed.
dialog: 
text: She goes out the door.
dialog: 
text: Bobby looks down at the keyboard. He closes the
text: cover and softly utters:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Shit.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CATHERINE'S BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: She stands in front of a dresser mirror, pinning up
text: her hair, preparatory to taking a bath. Her
dialog: attention is drawn to...
dialog: 
text: ... Bobby entering, and as he crosses to her, she
text: quickly turns back to the mirror.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You think I'm a fake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I think it's what you think.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No, it isn't what I think.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Look... You made a very calculated
dialog: move, and then made me feel
dialog: embarrassed for responding to you.
dialog: That wasn't necessary.
dialog: 
text: She moves away from him and he follows her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yes, it was. You've made it clear
dialog: that if I can cut a little piano, I
dialog: might get a little response.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
text: (stops and turns to him)
dialog: I don't think that's accurate...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Up to now, what I've been getting
dialog: from you are meaningful looks over
dialog: the dinner table and a lot of vague
dialog: suggestions about the day after
dialog: tomorrow...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I'm not conscious of having given
dialog: you any meaningful looks. And as
dialog: for the day after tomorrow, this is
dialog: the day after tomorrow, and I am,
dialog: unfortunately, seeing you... Now if
dialog: you'll excuse me, I'd like to take
text: a bath.
dialog: 
text: She moves back to the dresser and as she begins
text: searching through an array of bath oils on top of
text: it, Bobby steps in beside her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: It's convenient to fake looking for
dialog: something right now, isn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I'm not faking anything. I'm
dialog: looking for some bath oil...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Some bath oil?
dialog: 
text: He lifts up one of the bottles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: What about this one?
dialog: (picking up another)
dialog: Or this one?
dialog: (and another)
dialog: How about some jasmine?
dialog: (and another)
dialog: What about some musk?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHFRINE
dialog: What are you doing!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (knocking the bottles
dialog: over)
dialog: What are you doing, screwing around
dialog: with this crap?!
dialog: 
text: A little intimidated by his aggressivity:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I don't find your language that
dialog: charming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: It's direct, anyway, which seems to
dialog: be difficult for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I'd like you to leave now. Is that
dialog: direct enough?
dialog: 
text: He makes no move to go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE (CONT'D)
dialog: You're not a serious person, by
dialog: your own admission. And that may be
dialog: interesting, but it doesn't
dialog: interest me...
dialog: 
text: Needing the safety of distance, she moves over to
text: the windows next to the bed. Again, he follows
dialog: after her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Serious, that's what's important to
dialog: you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Yes, that's what's important to
dialog: me...
dialog: 
text: He takes her by the shoulders...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Okay, let's be serious...
dialog: 
text: ... and forces her onto the bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: No, don't do that...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Shut up...
dialog: 
text: He hesitates for a moment, full of things he wants
text: to say and cannot. Catherine looks up at him,
text: uttering a quiet challenge:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: No inner feeling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That's right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I don't believe vou.
dialog: 
text: He leans down to her, begins kissing her. Her arms
text: encircle him and laying back on the bed, she pulls
text: his body onto hers, fervently returning his kisses.
text: And as he responds with an ardor absent of fakery
text: and full of a lifetime of derelict feelings, a FADE
scene_heading: OVER BEGINS, to:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CATHERINE'S BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Catherine and Bobby lie side by side. He watches
text: her as she addresses the ceiling:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I married him when I was 17. He was
dialog: a cellist, and I thought he was the
dialog: most brilliant man I'd ever met...
dialog: And I'm sure he was, because at
dialog: that age, I hadn't met that many...
dialog: But he was insidious, you know. He
dialog: had me convinced that I was a
text: mediocrity, musically, as a woman,
dialog: as an intellect. But in this
text: completely imperceptible, pleasant
dialog: way, so that you weren't even sure
dialog: he was doing it. Anyway, I just
dialog: woke up one morning and I said, you
dialog: know something Joseph, you're full
dialog: of beans, and I left him...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That's what you said?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Something witty and devastating
dialog: like that.
dialog: 
text: She moves onto her side, looking over at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE (CONT'D)
dialog: As a matter of fact, he's the one
dialog: who introduced me to Carl...
dialog: (a pause, then:)
dialog: How are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'm fine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Carl restored my confidence. He
dialog: really did. He's much more
dialog: substantial than you give him
dialog: credit for.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Is he?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
text: She reaches over, tentatively caressing his face,
dialog: then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you think you could discreetly
dialog: move across the hall now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, I think I could.
dialog: 
text: He kisses her, gets up and crosses to the door, and
text: as he opens it:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Robert?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I could spend some time with you
dialog: tomorrow morning, before Carl comes
dialog: back, I mean, if you'd like to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Of course I'd like to.

speaker_heading: BOBBY

scene_heading: EXT. FERRY - MORNING

speaker_heading: SAMIA
dialog: But the point is, man is born into

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINCHER
dialog: If I may beg to differ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMIA
dialog: Beg all you like, John, but the
dialog: fact remains that man takes
dialog: enormous delight in aggressive

text: Rayette interrupts, calling across the room to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: Is there a TV in the house?
dialog: 
text: Carl starts to answer and is pre-empted by Samia:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMIA
dialog: John believes in the basic goodness
dialog: of man, and that's fine, but gaze
dialog: into the pit like I have and that
text: view seems a little soporific. And
dialog: not unlike television, it hardly

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: There's some good things on it,
dialog: though.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMIA
dialog: Pardon me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: The TV. There's some good things on
dialog: it, sometimes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMIA
dialog: I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't
dialog: really discussing media...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINCHER
dialog: If you really hold such bleak
dialog: views, how can you, in good
dialog: conscience, carry on a practice?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMIA
dialog: Oh, there's always hope, I think,
dialog: for a few individuals, if they're

dialog: illusions and their...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (cutting her off)
dialog: And what about love?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMIA
dialog: What about it? Wouldn't you agree

dialog: been done in the name of love?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: No, I wouldn't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMIA
dialog: Well, you're a romantic, Catherine,

dialog: more, about to be married...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON BOBBY
dialog:

speaker_heading: SAMIA

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I think these cold, "objective"
dialog: discussions are aggressive,

dialog: 
text: She gets up and starts to move away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMIA
dialog: But I'd like to say, so that I

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMIA
dialog: I beg your pardon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (advancing on her)
dialog: I said, don't point at her like

dialog: name.
dialog: 
text: He comes back down the stairs and runs into Rayette

speaker_heading: RAYETTE
dialog: Bobby...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (moving past her)
dialog: I can't talk to you right now,

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SPICER'S ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Tita and Spicer. Though both are clothed, they are
text: caught in some stage of intimacy on top of Spicer's

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Tita, what the hell are you doing?!
dialog: 
text: Spicer stands up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPICER
dialog: Hey, this is my room.

speaker_heading: BOBBY

dialog: It's none of your business!

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Where's Catherine?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: I don't know where she is!
dialog: 
text: Spicer moves to Bobby, taking hold of his arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPICER
dialog: Don't you believe in knocking, pal?
dialog: 
text: Bobby roughly pushes him away and advances on Tita.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'm talking to you, Tita!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: (close to tears)
dialog: Can't I have anything to myself,

speaker_heading: SPICER
dialog: (grabbing hold of him

dialog: Come on now, out!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (struggling with him)
dialog: Keep your fucking hands off my
dialog: sister, nurse!
dialog: 
text: Spicer goes into sudden rage, pushing Bobby
text: violently toward the door and yelling:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPICER
dialog: Did you hear me! Move out!!
dialog: 
text: Bobby leaps at him and as their struggle carries
text: them into the kitchen, Tita begins yelling:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Stop it! Bobby, will just you stop!
dialog: I mean it!
dialog: 
text: Spicer gets Bobby into a painful headlock and is
text: being bulled around the kitchen by him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPICER
dialog: Hold it, just hold it!!
dialog: 
text: They crash into the kitchen table, knocking chairs
dialog: over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Carl! Somebody get Carl!
dialog: 
text: Bobby rams Spicer into the refrigerator.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPICER
dialog: Take it easy, dammit!
dialog: 
text: He hurls him against the kitchen wall, still
text: holding him in a headlock as Tita enters the
dialog: kitchen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Stop it! Right now! Just stop it!!
dialog: Carl!!
dialog: 
text: And as she runs from the room, Spicer begins
text: violently jerking his forearm up against Bobby's
text: trachea, punctuating each jerk with the repeated
dialog: command:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPICER
dialog: Give up! Give up! Give up! Give up!
dialog: Give up! Give up!
dialog: 
text: He feels Bobby's body slacken. He releases him and
text: Bobby drops to the floor as...
dialog: 
text: ... Carl, Catherine and Tita run into the kitchen,
dialog: looking to:
dialog: 
text: Bobby, gasping for air, tries to get up from the
text: floor, and unable to, slumps back against the
text: kitchen wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TITA
dialog: Oh God, Bobby, look what you've
dialog: done...
dialog: 
text: He looks past her, to Catherine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I just wanted to talk to you for a
dialog: minute.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BAYFRONT - DAY
dialog: 
text: Catherine and Bobby sit on a low stone wall

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: No. It's useless, Robert. It
dialog: wouldn't work, not ever...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Just give me a chance, will you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I'm trying to be delicate with you,
dialog: but you're not understanding me.
dialog: It's not just because of Carl, or
dialog: my music, but because of you...
dialog: (she looks at him)
dialog: I mean, what would it come to? If a
dialog: person has no love for himself, no
dialog: respect, no love for his work, his
dialog: family, his friends, something...
dialog: How can he ask for love in return?
dialog: I mean, why should he ask for it?
dialog: 
text: Profoundly wounded, he looks away from her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: And living out here, in this rest
dialog: home asylum, that's what you want?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (looking back to her)
dialog: That'll make you happy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I hope it will, yes.
dialog: (she pauses, then:)
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: 
text: Needing to distance herself from witnessing his
text: pain, she gets up and moves OUT OF FRAME.
dialog: 
text: His eyes move from her to look out over the bay
text: and, after a brief silence, he softly utters:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY - DAY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Are you cold?
dialog: 
text: He leans over to adjust the blanket covering
text: Nicholas's legs and, hunkering down in front of
text: him, glances around at the fields, searching for
dialog: articulation:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know if you'd be
dialog: particularly interested in hearing
dialog: anything about me. My life, I
dialog: mean... Most of it doesn't add up
dialog: to much... that I could relate as a
dialog: way of life that you'd approve
dialog: of...
dialog: 
text: He pauses briefly, then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd like to be able to tell you
dialog: why, but I don't really... I mean,
dialog: I move around a lot because things
dialog: tend to get bad when I stay. And
dialog: I'm looking... for auspicious
dialog: beginnings, I guess...
dialog: 
text: He breaks off again, resuming with evident
dialog: difficulty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm trying to, you know, imagine
dialog: your half of this conversation...
dialog: My feeling is, that if you could
dialog: talk, we probably wouldn't be
dialog: talking. That's pretty much how it
dialog: got to be before. I left...
dialog: (another pause)
dialog: Are you all right?
dialog: 
text: He searches his father's face, entreating him for
text: some kind of answer, some sign of response, and
dialog: seeing none...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know what to say...
dialog: 
text: ... he breaks down, barely able to utter the
dialog: following:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Tita suggested that we try to... I
dialog: don't know. I think that she...
dialog: seems to feel we've got... some
dialog: understanding to reach... She
dialog: totally denies the fact that we
dialog: were never that comfortable with
dialog: each other to begin with...
text: (pauses, trying to gain
dialog: control)
dialog: The best I can do, is apologize.
dialog: 
text: He looks silently at his father for a moment...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: We both know I was never really
dialog: that good at it, anyway...
dialog:

speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry it didn't work out.

speaker_heading: TITA (CONT'D)

dialog: Sure you don't want anything?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (to attendant)
dialog: Fill it up.
dialog:

dialog: the station.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GAS STATION - MEN'S ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Bobby removes his jacket and lays it on top of the
text: waste container. He moves to the wash basin and
text: stands a moment, gazing absently down at it, his
dialog: mind searching for that inward oblivion in which
dialog: nothing much is demanded, nothing much felt.
dialog: 
text: Then, leaning over and placing his hands on the rim
dialog: of the basin...
dialog: 
text: ... he lifts his gaze to the mirror and, after
text: minutely perusing the features of his face, looks
text: into his own eyes as he had into his fathers,
text: silently beseeching them for guidance.

scene_heading: (SOUND OF SEMI'S MOTOR OVER:)
dialog: 
text: REMOTE ANGLE as Bobby comes out of the men's room.
text: He has left his jacket inside and stands for a
dialog: moment, looking at the...
dialog: 
text: ... DRIVER, bending down to check the undercarriage
text: of the semi. As he stands up and circuits the front
text: of the truck, heading for the cab:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (faintly audible)
dialog: Hey, wait a minute.
dialog: 
text: He moves over to him and after a brief exchange,
text: the driver nods his bead and continues on to the
text: cab, Bobby moves to the passenger door and climbs
text: up into the pass seat.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SEMI CAB - GAS STATION - DAY
dialog: 
text: The driver glances over at Bobby:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Haven't you got a jacket or
dialog: anything with you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No, I don't, I uh... it got burned
text: up. Everything in the car got the
dialog: shit burned out of it. All I got
dialog: left is what I have on...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: I've got an extra jacket behind the
dialog: seat, if you want to put it on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No, it's okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Suit yourself. But I'll tell you,
dialog: where we're headed is gonna get
dialog: colder'n hell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: It's all right. I'm fine.
dialog: 
text: The driver puts the truck into gear and releases
dialog: the brake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm all right.
dialog: 
text: And as the truck begins to move forward:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm fine.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: REMOTE ANGLE:
dialog: 
text: The semi pulls out of the station onto the highway,
text: giving view to Bobby's car. The attendant is
text: cleaning the windshield and Rayette can be seen
text: opening the passenger door. As she gets out and
text: surveys the area for some sign of Bobby, the semi
text: MOVES INTO VIEW, going north on the highway.
dialog: 
text: Rayette looks over the hood of the car, addressing
text: the attendant. He gestures toward the men's room
text: and as she moves across the station and disappears
text: OFF THE SCREEN...
dialog: 
text: ... the semi recedes in the distance, leaving a
text: black trail of smoke from its exhaust stack,
text: dissipating in the air.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE END
