speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: Mrs. Kennedy? They told me to come

speaker_heading: JOURNALIST (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm so sorry for your loss.
dialog: 
dialog: I.
text: Jackie takes a long moment -- her voice raw...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Have you read what they've been
dialog: writing? Krock and Merriman and
dialog: all the rest?
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: Yes. I have.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Merriman is such a bitter man.
dialog: It's been just one week and already
dialog: they're treating him like some
dialog: dusty old artifact, to be shelved
dialog: away.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's no way to be remembered.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: And how would you like him
dialog: remembered, Mrs. Kennedy?
text: Suddenly stern, authoritative --
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You understand that I will be
dialog: editing this conversation?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Just in case I don’t say exactly
dialog: what I mean.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: With all due respect that seems
dialog: very unlikely, Mrs. Kennedy.
text: Jackie stares at him, polite but firm.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST (CONT'D)
dialog: Right. Okay. So this will be your

text: Holding his gaze, she refocuses, preparing for a performance

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Exactly. Come in.
scene_heading: EXT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - DECK
text: Jackie and the Journalist sit across from each other at a

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I thought it was another backfire.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I very nearly didn’t go. What if
dialog: I'd been here, or out riding in

dialog: (beat)
dialog: Thank God I was with him...
text: She trails off.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: Why, thank God?
dialog: Instead of an answer-.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Do you know what I think of
dialog: history?
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: Of history?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I've read a great deal. More than
dialog: people realize. The more I read,
dialog: the more I wonder: When something
dialog: is written down, does that make it
dialog: true?
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: It's all that we have.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Had. We have television now. Now
text: people can see with their own eyes.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: That tour of the White House you
dialog: did a couple of years ago, for CBS,
dialog: I always assumed you did that
dialog: for...a purpose? No? After the
dialog: fashion magazines? You even won an
dialog: Emmy...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I didn’t do that program for me. I
dialog: did it for the American people.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: That program was my first glimpse
dialog: into the White House and for
dialog: whatever it’s worth, I thought you
dialog: were excellent, very poised.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: An afterthought...
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: You could have had a career as a
dialog: broadcaster. I’m sure.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: What?
text: The Journalist looks up from his notes.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: I said...you could have had a

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Are you giving me professional

text: He shakes his head, embarrassed...
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: I’m not.

scene_heading: TELEVISION PRODUCTION.
text: She stands face to face with NANCY TUCKERMAN, her social

text: Displeased with the sound of her voice, Jackie lifts her
text: shoulders, her posture more erect. She tries again.
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Welcome to the White House. We’re
dialog: so proud to call it home.
text: Her brow furrows, still dissatisfied.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Why don’t you try ‘the people's
dialog: house’? Make it more personal.
text: Jackie considers the suggestion. And now -- with that
dialog: notorious, breathy diction...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Welcome to the people's house.
dialog: We're so proud to call it home.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Better?
text: Nancy nods.
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: When will Jack join us?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: They want to hear from you.
dialog: Jackie is skeptical
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: They think I’m a fool -- one year
text: in office, wasting their money.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: That's why you need to show them
dialog: what you've done.
text: Nancy can tell Jackie is still uneasy.
speaker_heading: NANCY (CONT'D)
dialog: The President will join you in the
text: Monroe Room. At the end of the

speaker_heading: JACKIE

speaker_heading: NANCY

dialog: from its South Lawn. For the next
dialog: hour Mrs. John F. Kennedy invites
dialog: you to visit the President's House
dialog: and see some of the restorations
text: she’s made in its interior. Mrs.
dialog: John F. Kennedy, third youngest of
dialog: the twenty-nine wives to live in
dialog: the White House.
text: Jackie's beauty has been magnified ten-fold. Her nerves have
text: vanished. She smiles, radiant, and the show is on...
speaker_heading: COLLINGSWOOD
dialog: Mrs. Kennedy I want to thank you
dialog: for letting us visit your official
dialog: home.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: This is obviously the room from
dialog: which most of your work on it is
dialog: directed...
text: All around them, ANTIQUE FURNITURE is arranged in various
text: states of restoration and disrepair.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (playful)
dialog: Yes, it's attic and the cellar all
dialog: in one. Since our work started we
dialog: received hundreds of letters every
dialog: day. This is where we evaluate all
dialog: of the finds and see if we want to
dialog: keep them if they'll fit into our
dialog: budget.
speaker_heading: COLLINGSWOOD
dialog: Mrs. Kennedy, every first lady and
dialog: every administration since
dialog: President Madison's time, has made
dialog: changes greater or smaller in the
dialog: White House.
text: Jackie steals a glance off-camera. With a quiet gesture —-
text: Nancy reminds her to smile.
speaker_heading: COLLINGSWOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: Before we look at some of the
dialog: changes you've made...What's your
dialog: basic plan?
text: A beat, as Jackie considers her motivation. And then, from
dialog: the heart -
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Well, I really don't have one.
dialog: Because I think this house will
dialog: always grow and should. It just
dialog: seemed to me such a shame when we
dialog: came here, to find hardly anything
dialog: of the past in the house. Hardly
dialog: anything before 19-2.
text: off-camera Nancy looks at her notes, nodding along to
text: Jackie's words.
speaker_heading: COLLINGSWOOD
dialog: Now suppose you and your committee
dialog: were to acquire some of the things
dialog: that are in this room, what happens
dialog: when the next President’s wife
dialog: comes into the White House?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Well if they don’t want it...in the

speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: And the talk of the tax payer money
dialog: being wasted?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I raised every dime privately that

dialog: To impart a sense of America’s

speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
text: Objects and artifacts last far

text: And then, probing, trying to find the emotion...
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: I’m sure the readers would like to
dialog: know... What it’s like to be a
dialog: member of your family?
text: Jackie thinks -- and then...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Imagine a little boy surrounded by
dialog: all this. Having his older brother
text: die in battle and then going off to
dialog: that same war and coming home a
dialog: hero. People see that little boy,
dialog: born to wealth, privilege, willing
dialog: to sacrifice everything for his
dialog: ideals and service to his nation.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: Royalty. You make it sound like
dialog: royalty.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Well for royalty you need
dialog: tradition. And for tradition you
dialog: need time.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: Well I guess it has to start

dialog: day one?

scene_heading: INT. EAST ROOM WHITE HOUSE (1962
text: Jackie and Collingswood now stand in the sprawling East Room.
speaker_heading: COLLINGSWOOD
dialog: This is the East Room, pretty much
dialog: as Americans have known it now for
dialog: sixty years. Obviously you haven't
dialog: felt like you had to make any great
dialog: changes in it.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: No, I think it's lovely. I hate to
dialog: make changes really, so when you
dialog: find a room like this, it's
dialog: wonderful.
speaker_heading: COLLINGSWOOD
dialog: This piano brings to mind that this
dialog: is the part of the White House
dialog: where you have the musical affairs?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: That's right this piano was
dialog: designed by Franklin Roosevelt with
dialog: the Eagle’s Support.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And this is the end of the room
dialog: where Pablo Casals played for us,
dialog: where we had a portable stage built
dialog: for us, when we had the Shakespeare
dialog: Players.
speaker_heading: COLLINGSWOOD
dialog: Mrs. Kennedy, this administration
dialog: has shown a particular affinity for
dialog: artists, musicians, writers, and
dialog: poets.
text: Behind the camera, Nancy tracks Jackie’s every move.
speaker_heading: COLLINGSWOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: Is this because you and your
dialog: husband just feel that way. Or do
dialog: you think there's a relationship
dialog: between the government and the
dialog: arts?
text: Jackie pauses -- clearly hesitant to tread on any ground
text: resembling public policy.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: That's so complicated. I-I don't

speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: Is your faith helping you?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I'd prefer to discuss my faith with
dialog: a priest. You're not a man of the
dialog: cloth, are you?
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: No, I'm not. I’m just trying to get
dialog: to the truth. That’s what
dialog: reporters do.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: The truth? Well I’ve grown
dialog: accustomed to a great divide
dialog: between what people believe and
dialog: what I know to be real.
dialog: ll.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: Fine, I will settle for a story
dialog: that’s believable.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: That's more like it. You know I
dialog: used to be a reporter myself once.
dialog: I know what you're looking for.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: (confused)
dialog: I’m sorry?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: A moment-by-moment account. That’s

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I’m very happy to be in the great
dialog: state of Texas, to be with you and
dialog: experience the noble Spanish
dialog: tradition that has achieved so much
dialog: in Dallas. This tradition started
dialog: 100 years ago before the

speaker_heading: JACKIE

dialog: (beat)
dialog: Are you ready?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (ironic)
dialog: Of course. I love crowds.
text: The door opens. Jackie walks off AIR FORCE ONE onto the

text: It is NOVEMBER 22, 1963.
text: She is wearing that pink wool Chanel suit with navy lapels,
text: an outfit that will soon be notorious but right now, in the
text: morning light, is cheery and elegant, another fashion
text: pronouncement by the most stylish woman in America.
text: Beside her is her husband, PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY.
text: Jackie absorbs the roar of the crowd like a physical assault.
text: Then sees GOVERNOR JOHN CONNALLY and his wife NELLIE waiting
text: at the bottom of the short staircase, flanked by a saluting
dialog: honor guard.
text: The crowds are chanting "JACK-EE! JACK-EE!"
speaker_heading: LYNDON JOHNSON
dialog: You remember the Governor and Mrs.

speaker_heading: LADYBIRD
dialog: Welcome to Dallas, Darling.
text: She carefully descends to the bottom of the stairs, where
text: suddenly -- Nellie thrusts a bouquet of RED ROSES into her
dialog: hands.
text: A beat, as she eyes the crimson blossoms.
text: And then -- shouting over the screaming crowd...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: My! What a welcome!
text: The Governor places a conspiratorial arm around the President
text: and holds him for a whispered conference.
text: Amidst the chaos, Jackie turns around to face the CROWD,
text: which erupts in even louder cheers. She blushes, almost
text: embarrassed, and responds with a demure smile.
dialog: 13.
text: Then she notices -- the President is on the move again. She
text: hurries to catch up as he marches toward the waiting limo.
text: Jackie holds a grin in place and methodically makes eye

scene_heading: INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM
text: The interview with Journalist continues. Her voice quivering,

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: There’d been the biggest motorcade
text: from the airport. Hot, wild like
dialog: in Mexico or Vienna. The sun was
dialog: strong in our faces but I couldn't
dialog: wear my sunglasses. Jack has his
text: hand out and I see a piece of his
dialog: skull come off. It wasn’t flesh
text: colored, it wasn’t white. He slumps
text: in my lap. His blood, his brains in
dialog: my lap. And I’m saying Jack, Jack
dialog: can you hear me, Jack, I love you
dialog: Jack!
dialog: (through tears)
dialog: And his head was so beautiful, and
dialog: his mouth was beautiful and his
text: eyes were open. I was trying to
dialog: keep the top of his head down. Keep
dialog: it all in. He had the most
text: wonderful expression on his face,
dialog: you know? Just before they'd ask
dialog: him a question, just before he’d
text: answer. He looked puzzled.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I knew he was dead.

speaker_heading: SLAM CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. AIR FORCE ONE - PRESIDENTIAL QUARTERS
text: A TIGHT CLOSE-UP of Jackie. Her wide-set, deep brown eyes
text: are blank, exhausted.
text: Her mascara is streaked, her cheeks scarred with red-brown
text: smudges. The dried blood of her dead husband. She stares at
text: herself in the mirror. The pillbox hat is gone -- cast on
text: the floor -- and her usually perfect hair is tousled.
text: Frantically, she scrubs at the blood, some of it still wet,
text: with Kleenex.
text: She wipes at her reflection in the mirror.
text: Finally, she pats her face dry with a hanging towel. Then,
text: noticing her hair, she attempts to restore its shape with her
text: hands. Her hands quiver.
text: Frustrated, she lets out a wrenching SOB. And then -~ KNOCK!
speaker_heading: KNOCK!
speaker_heading: O'BRIEN (0.S.)
dialog: Mrs. Kennedy? Are you alright?
dialog: It's Larry...

text: LARRY O'BRIEN, the President's Congressional Liaison and old

speaker_heading: O'BRIEN
dialog: Take all of the time you need.
text: With her fingers she wipes the tears and blood from under her
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Are they waiting?

speaker_heading: JUDGE HUGHES
dialog: I do, solemnly swear...

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Agent Hill? Can you tell me...what.
dialog: size was the bullet?
text: A beat of silence, everyone unsettled.
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t think it was a thirty
dialog: eight, was it? What do you call it?
dialog: The caliber? It seemed bigger. It
dialog: seemed like something soldiers
dialog: would use or maybe it was the kind
dialog: they use for deer hunting....
speaker_heading: O'BRIEN
dialog: (very careful)
dialog: Mrs. Kennedy, you don’t have to--
dialog: we don’t know yet.
text: No one answers. She becomes distant, lost in concentration.

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: We need to have the Irish Cadets.
speaker_heading: O'BRIEN
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Yes. The Irish Cadets -- for the
dialog: funeral. Jack loved them. He saw
dialog: them perform in Dublin last summer.
speaker_heading: O'BRIEN
dialog: Of course, Mrs. Kennedy. We'll
dialog: make sure of it.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: And those bagpipers from Scotland.
dialog: What were they called, Kenny?
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: O'DONNELL
dialog: Yeah. The Black Watch.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: That's right. The Black Watch
dialog: Pipers.
dialog: Hill approaches --
speaker_heading: HILL
dialog: When we arrive, we'll be exiting
dialog: out the rear of the plane. You,
dialog: the President -- President Johnson
dialog: that is, Mrs. Johnson--
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: --Why the rear?
speaker_heading: HILL
dialog: There's press at Andrews. Not to
dialog: mention the security risk--
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I'm supposed to hide away. Now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HILL
dialog: Not hide--
text: Jackie's voice rises, an unexpected anger-~
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: --I'm sure those people would love

dialog: themselves? The Birch Society? No,
dialog: I will not sneak out the back door.
dialog: (beat, final)
dialog: I'll go out the usual way. We all
dialog: will.
text: Hill is about to argue, but Jackie stares back at him --

speaker_heading: HILL
dialog: I'll arrange it.

speaker_heading: BURKLEY
dialog: When we land, Mrs. Kennedy, we'll

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (aghast)
dialog: The autopsy?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Is that necessary?
speaker_heading: BURKLEY
dialog: I'm afraid it's required.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: By who?
speaker_heading: BURKLEY
dialog: The law, Mrs. Kennedy.
dialog: She considers this. And then --
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: And what exactly will they do?
text: Burkley hesitates -- looks to the others for help -- but no
dialog: one knows what she means.
speaker_heading: BURKLEY
dialog: I’m not sure--
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: --What does an ‘autopsy’ entail? I
dialog: want you to explain to me. I want

dialog: This is Walton's life's work, his purpose for being --
speaker_heading: WALTON

speaker_heading: BOBBY

speaker_heading: JACKIE

speaker_heading: VALENTI
dialog: President Johnson would like
