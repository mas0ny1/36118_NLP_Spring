scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - DAY
dialog: 1 1
text: We're moving through a cornfield. At speed. The sound of
text: children's laughter. Excited shrieking.
text: A beautiful young girl, (MARY BOLEYN, 8), our heroine, runs
text: through the fields, being chased by her younger brother, GEORGE,
dialog: and sister, ANNE, (10).
text: Touchingly, MARY is barely taller than the corn, her head
text: skimming along the sheaves.
text: REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: the children are being watched by their
scene_heading: parents, (SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH BOLEYN).
speaker_heading: SIR THOMAS
dialog: I received a formal request for marriage

dialog: From the Carey family.
speaker_heading: SIR THOMAS indicates to

text: Intelligent. The obvious leader among the children.
speaker_heading: LADY ELIZABETH
dialog: But that's wonderful.
speaker_heading: SIR THOMAS
dialog: I turned it down.
text: LADY ELIZABETH turns...`What?'
speaker_heading: SIR THOMAS
dialog: And offered them Mary instead.
speaker_heading: SIR THOMAS indicates
text: MARY, the middle child. Fair-haired.
dialog: Pretty. Sweet-natured.
speaker_heading: SIR THOMAS
dialog: Fnne's too good for William Carey. She
dialog: can do (better than a merchant's son.
speaker_heading: LADY ELIZABETH
dialog: You underestimate Mary.
speaker_heading: SIR THOMAS
dialog: Not true. I think she's..the kinder of
dialog: the two. Quite possibly the fairer.
text: The CHILDREN, meanwhile, have started a race..
speaker_heading: SIR THOMAS
dialog: But to get ahead in this world, you need
dialog: more than fair looks and a kind heart.
text: On the field, ANNE wins. She jumps up and down, holding her arms
text: aloft, as MARY flops to the floor. Vanquished.
dialog: 2.
text: SIR THOMAS smiles, `See?' He walks towards ANNE..
speaker_heading: SIR THOMAS
dialog: (applauding his favourite)

text: ANNE and GEORGE enter. GEORGE lets out a low whistle..
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Look at you..! Younger than me. More
dialog: beautiful than me. Married before me.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I am eclipsed. I am just the `Other
dialog: Boleyn Girl.'
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hardly.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No, is this it? This is the end of the
dialog: unholy trinity?
text: GEORGE extends her arms, wraps them around his two sister. An

dialog: finally ANNE..
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Confirma hoc, Deus, quod operatus es in
dialog: nobis..
text: The PRIEST sprinkles the ring with holy water. WILLIAM CAREY,
text: (35), puts it on MARY's finger.
text: few rows back, a young NOBLEMAN stares at ANNE. Looks at her
text: across the church. Obviously attracted. ANNE notices.
scene_heading: INT. BOLEYN HOME - NIGHT
dialog: 5 5
text: The party afterwards. MUSICIANS play. The bride and groom,

text: other GUESTS..
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Are you happy?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Very.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: You don't secretly wish you'd married
dialog: someone grander? With a title?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No. I want a husband who loves me. And
dialog: who thinks it first thing every morning.
dialog: And last thing at night.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Then you've found the right man.
scene_heading: IN ANOTHER CORNER:
text: ANNE is dancing with her brother GEORGE. She looks up to see the

speaker_heading: GEORGE

text: GEORGE indicates a tall, haughty-looking FIANCEE beside PERCY..
speaker_heading: ANNE

speaker_heading: SIR THOMAS
dialog: Thomas..
text: he DUKE ignores THOMAS, and goes instead to his sister, (LADY
text: ELIZABETH), and kisses her..
speaker_heading: NORFOLK
dialog: I think I have managed to persuade the
dialog: King to come and stay with you on
text: progress. A week-end's hunting in late
dialog: summer.
speaker_heading: SIR THOMAS
dialog: But that's wonderful! Thank you, thank
dialog: you so much..
text: (he turns to ELIZABETH)
dialog: Did you hear that, Elizabeth?
speaker_heading: LADY ELIZABETH
dialog: (hates the idea)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SIR THOMAS
dialog: Finally we can present George, and with
dialog: luck, get him a position at court.
text: LADY ELIZABETH excuses herself, and leaves..
speaker_heading: NORFOLK
dialog: These are difficult times. I have it on
dialog: good authority that the Queen no longer
text: bleeds - yet the matter of a male heir
text: is still not resolved.
dialog: a beat)
dialog: It cannot be long before the King is
text: forced to look outside the marriage.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: SIR THOMAS
dialog: What? And make a bastard King of
dialog: England?
speaker_heading: NORFOLK
dialog: A legitimized bastard. What choice does
dialog: he have?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Obviously, I've given it thought, and
dialog: wondered which Howard girl I could put
dialog: under his nose. Imagine the influence
dialog: that would give us. To be blood family
dialog: of the next King of England. Equally,
dialog: imagine if another family were to
dialog: achieve the same?
text: NORFOLK indicates SIR JOHN SEYMOUR in the corner, and his two
text: loathsome, ambitious sons EDWARD and THOMAS..
speaker_heading: SIR THOMAS
dialog: What about Anne?
text: SIR THOMAS turns, and indicates ANNE across the crowds, who's
text: dancing with GEORGE...
speaker_heading: SIR THOMAS
dialog: I realise as a `Boleyn' she is not
dialog: officially a `Howard', but as your
dialog: sister's daughter..
speaker_heading: NORFOLK
dialog: But she's your eldest, Thomas. Your
dialog: first born. And your favourite. Wouldn't
dialog: you prefer her to have a nice,
dialog: uncomplicated, respectable marriage?
dialog: Like Mary?
speaker_heading: SIR THOMAS
dialog: If Anne were an uncomplicated,
dialog: respectable girl like Mary, then I'd say
dialog: `yes'. But she's not.
text: SIR THOMAS looks out at ANNE..
speaker_heading: SIR THOMAS
dialog: She's anything but.
scene_heading: INT. BOLEYN CASTLE - DAY
dialog: 7 7
text: SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH stand in a corner, watching the
text: party continue. ELIZABETH's face darkens..
speaker_heading: ADY ELIZABETH
dialog: don't like it. It would cost a fortune
dialog: to make our house fit for a royal visit.
dialog: Money we don't have.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: 6.
scene_heading: And what if theDY ELIZABETH(cont'd)
dialog: LA king doesn't like her?
dialog: Or if she sleeps with him but gives him
dialog: a girl?
speaker_heading: SIR THOMAS
dialog: And what if you were to look on the
dialog: bright side? Just once?
text: An ominous clap of thunder outside..
speaker_heading: SIR THOMAS
dialog: Risk nothing, you gain nothing.
text: ADY ELIZABETH stares at her husband..
speaker_heading: LADY ELIZABETH
dialog: hen was it that people stopped thinking
dialog: of ambition as a sin, and started
dialog: thinking of it as a virtue?
speaker_heading: SIR THOMAS
dialog: Easy for you to say. You've had power
dialog: and wealth all your life.
speaker_heading: LADY ELIZABETH
dialog: Until I married you, Thomas. And I was
text: happy to give it up.
text: LADY ELIZABETH turns, and walks back inside.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
dialog: 8 8
text: ANNE knocks on the door of her father's study. She waits.

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: o - the King himself is coming to
dialog: Hever. I'm so happy for George.
speaker_heading: ANNE

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What? What are you saying..?
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: It's known the King has a wandering eye.
dialog: Imagine...if he were to like me?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: But...you could never be more than his
dialog: mistress. And that's no substitute for a
dialog: husband.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: But as the King's mistress the least I'd
dialog: get after he finished with me would be
dialog: an Earl. And if I fell pregnant? And
dialog: gave him what his wife has failed to?
dialog: a beat)
dialog: Quite apart from the money, it'd be a
dialog: Duke at least.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: But what about your happiness? Your
dialog: future?
text: ANNE shrugs, smiles..
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: I could be a happy Duchess.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Are you nervous?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: A little.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: You'll tell me everything in the
dialog: morning?
speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: No details spared?

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hold me a moment?
text: WILLIAM CAREY envelops MARY with his arms..
speaker_heading: MARY (cont'd)
dialog: I'm so lucky to have a man who is
dialog: content with what he has.
text: MARY looks at him..
speaker_heading: MARY (cont'd)
dialog: You are, aren't you?
text: WILLIAM CAREY smiles, looks at his gorgeous bride..
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I am the luckiest man in the world.
text: WILLIAM reaches for the wine..
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (cont'd)
dialog: Drink?
text: MARY shakes her head. But WILLIAM tenderly insists..
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (cont'd)
dialog: You should. It will hurt less.
text: MARY nervously drinks..
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (cont'd)
dialog: Lie back.
text: MARY lies down. Then she lifts up her nightdress. WILLIAM pulls
text: down his trousers.
text: MARY extends her hands. Inviting him to join her. WILLIAM slowly
text: lowers himself on top of her. He enters her.
text: MARY smiles, in anticipation of pleasure. A side to her one
dialog: might not have imagined.
text: But one or two strokes later, and WILLIAM's knuckles whiten, his
text: face reddens, then he cries out, and slumps on top of her.
text: MARY looks up. Surely that wasn't it?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (cont'd)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: 11 11
text: The thunder of horses' hooves. A huge cloud of dust.
text: The Royal Standard flutters in the wind. Beneath it, a SOLDIER
text: in the KING's uniform, riding hard, dirt kicking up in his wake.
text: The SOLDIER is flanked by a dozen other of the KING's SOLDIERS,
text: who lead a coloumn of fifty or more RIDERS..
text: It's like an army. A legion riding into battle. But it's not,
text: This is just the KING OF ENGLAND going away for the week-end.
text: Behind the advance party, is the KING himself, (30's), handsome,
text: in his prime, surrounded by a dozen or so of his closest
text: COURTIERS, (among them the DUKE of NORFOLK), a grand, tough,
dialog: intimidating lot.
text: Behind them, comes the KING's CONFESSOR, a Priest with a large
text: ornate crucifix, a small library of religious books..
text: Then, in a riot of colour, come the MUSICIANS, the FOOL and the

speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: There he is!
text: The young HENRY TUDOR is a dazzling, magnetic, intensely

speaker_heading: ANNE
