text: Pan off the waterhole in the direction of the sound. It

scene_heading: ON THE MOTORCYCLE 2
text: Only the rider's back, silver-streaked hair. This gaunt figure
text: circles lazily in the moonlight, motorcycle tires rumbling over
text: the alkali. The circles get bigger and now biccer, and as he
text: comes around this time, the moonlight catches his face, aristo-
text: cratic cheekbones, a stringy beard, a pilot's light windbreaker.
text: This is Howard, age 62, looks over 70.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ALIGLE - HOWARD . 3

scene_heading: ON THE KNOLL

speaker_heading: ON HOWARD
