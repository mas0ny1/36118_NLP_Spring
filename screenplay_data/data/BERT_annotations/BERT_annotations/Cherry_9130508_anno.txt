dialog: CU: THE SERENE FACE OF A BEATIFIC STATUE
dialog: Three people, one after the other, rush by in a blur.
dialog: EXT. CHURCHYARD -- AFTERNOON
text: A stiff WIND. A BRIDE angrily drags her ass out of a church and into its courtyard.
text: Trees bend their bare, twisted limbs as if to lynch her: snagging her gown, catching at the layers of tulle over her face. She fights them off and storms on. Behind her, TWO MEN try to keep up, the Wind chasing the tails of their morning coats.
text: The men--tall, aristocratic UNCLE ERNEST and MAMMY, his gentler, younger, queenier male companion--collapse on a bench, while the bride, LEILA SWEET, 18, paces in front of them. Mammy silently reads a letter.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: Well, his note claims he's ... dead.
dialog: A scowling Ernest rips it out of his hand.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But he signed it, right?
dialog: The answer's written on Mammy's sympathetic face.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST (CONT'D)
dialog: And he dotted the "I" in his name with a little happy face?
dialog: Can't argue with the facts.
text: From ABOVE we see the young bride. Her uncles stand around her awkwardly. The uncommon Wind stirs the leaves on the ground. CRANE UP off Leila's face to an ASKEW ANGLE:
dialog: LEILA
dialog: On my parents' grave, before God, never again will I let some lying clown tell me he loves me, much less agree to marry him for it.
dialog: Uncle Ernest steps forward.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: Nonsense.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I'll die first.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: You'll go to Harvard first.
text: The camera WIDENS to reveal a trail of clothes leading down the courtyard path through the church's outer gates: dark pants, cummerbund, suspenders, tailed jacket, bow tie, dress shirt and shoes. We imagine an intended GROOM running the streets of New York in his underwear, and incongruously hear the sound of an alarm clock as we...

speaker_heading: INT. LEILA'S LOFT -- DAY
speaker_heading: BEGIN CREDITS
text: In total darkness we HEAR the sound of a hand slamming down on the ringing clock, silencing it. Out of the darkness, in POV, an image emerges: that of a mop-topped, sorry-looking dog staring straight at us with a Post-It stuck on his head.
dialog: Turn around to find Leila, now 29 years old, and still so fresh and beautiful it defies the laws of nature. So what.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: 'Morning, Paxil.
dialog: She pulls the Post-It off his head and reads it.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: "Brunch." Okay, boy. Okay.
text: Leila sits on the side of the bed, rubs her eyes, and then heads for the bathroom. She is wearing a long Harvard T-shirt and socks.
dialog: Paxil sits attentively on the bed while we HEAR Leila brushing her teeth.
speaker_heading: LEILA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: You want to go to the park later?
text: Paxil BARKS his approval, as Leila returns, pets his head, and walks towards the kitchen.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: Good boy.
text: Her LOFT is a bit of a shambles: books everywhere, lots of stuff in boxes. Her taste isn't bad, but her homemaking skills seem to be. A planet-themed mobile stands on a table in the living area.
text: Leila slaps the Post-It next to another on the fridge that reads "WEDDING!". And one which reads "GET A GRIP!". She pulls out a carton of milk, and a bottle of Vitamin C, chugs both from their containers, and pushes the message button on the answering machine. Her sister's voice:
speaker_heading: EVY (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, it's me. Saturday night. Around...10:30, I think. I hope you're out somewhere, 'cause if not, then you're asleep -- and well, that would just be too pathetic. Anyway, I can't make it to Uncle's tomorrow. Donald and I are, I don't know, choosing linens or something. Let's have breakfast on Monday. I've got the day off. Bye.
dialog: Leila walks towards the bedroom to change.
dialog: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: INT. LEILA'S LOBBY -- DAY
text: With Paxil in tow, Leila heads out. There are delivery menus strewn all over the floor. She picks them up, with a shake of the head that says she's done it a hundred times before.
dialog: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: EXT. LEILA'S LOFT -- DAY
text: A few more menus are littered on the outside stoop, and assorted other rubbish decorates the sidewalk in front of the adjacent SWEET'S MUFFIN SHOP. She cleans all of this up, dumps the whole mess in a trash bin, and walks Paxil around the corner. We notice a "Closed" sign in the shop window.
dialog: EXT. ERNEST AND MAMMY'S HOUSE -- DAY
dialog: Leila drags a somewhat reluctant Paxil up the steps of an imposing-looking brownstone.
dialog: INT. ERNEST AND MAMMY'S HOUSE -- DAY
dialog: The door opens on Mammy's generous face. He's eleven years older.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: Hello, dear.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Hi, Mammy.
text: After a big hug, Mammy leads them inside. He is wearing an apron, and carrying a glass of Sherry.
text: They walk into the living room of a beautifully appointed home. Old school. Uncle Ernest sits by the fire barely looking up from his laptop computer.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Mammy)
dialog: How is he?
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: I hate that. I'm right here.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I know you are.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: I'm not dead yet. I still have...relations.
dialog: Ernest notices the dog cowering behind Leila.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST (CONT'D)
dialog: And I don't recall inviting YOU to brunch.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: In civilized countries you would BE brunch.
dialog: Paxil makes himself even smaller.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I promised him a walk.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: We all know how seriously you take your promises.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: Don't start, Ernest.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: Who's starting?
text: Leila comes to peek over his shoulder, as Mammy heads to the kitchen.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (childlike)
dialog: What do you do exactly?
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: I push the little beans around on the little table until a few of them fall off in my pocket. Then I use those to PAY for all of you.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: You're quite a grouchy Uncle, aren't you?
text: Leila produces a bag of fresh coffee beans from Zabar's and dangles it in front of his nose. Ernest grunts his approval.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. ERNEST AND MAMMY'S DINING ROOM -- DAY
dialog: Eggs Benedict and Bolivian coffee for all. Mammy enters from the kitchen with a coffee pot.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: So where's the other one?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Um.
dialog: (mid-chew)
dialog: She and Donald are doing something...wedding related.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: Ah, yes. The Donald.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: He's a very nice boy. Good family.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: Dumb as toast.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: (scolding)
dialog: He's about to be our son-in-law.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: Still a chowderhead. Must be great in the sheets.
dialog: Off Mammy's scandalized look.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST (CONT'D)
dialog: What? Like you both haven't thought the same thing.
dialog: (to Leila)
dialog: -- well, you probably haven't, --
dialog: (to Mammy)
dialog: But I know you have.
dialog: Mammy energetically clears his plate.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: You are a vile and rude old man.
dialog: Ernest yells out after him.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: DON'T CALL ME OLD.
dialog: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK/BALTO STATUE -- DAY
text: Leila sits alone on a bench reading The New York Times, while Paxil waits dutifully at her heels. Children play on the statue nearby.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Listen to this: "Researchers announced that male dogs raised in New York City are at increased risk to develop medical problems including anxiety, skin rashes, depression, tooth decay, hypochondria and impotence."
dialog: (Leila looks down sympathetically)
dialog: That's so sad.
text: Paxil looks up, troubled. A rubber kick-ball rolls over near Leila. A cute kid, about six, runs over to retrieve it. He breaks into a heart-melting smile, picks up the ball, gives Leila a shy little wave and rejoins his friends.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Yours?
text: A startled Leila looks up as a MAN joins her on the bench.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Me, uh, no.
dialog: (indicating Paxil)
dialog: Mine. Paxil.
dialog: Regards the dog.
dialog: MAN
dialog: Very...fuzzy head.
text: There is an awkward pause as the Man beats himself up over that one. A little girl roughhouses on the statue.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (being polite)
dialog: Yours?
dialog: MAN
dialog: My sister's. I borrow her on Sundays.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: The closest my wife and I got was two canaries and a hamster.
dialog: (long beat, sadly)
dialog: She kept the hamster.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Freddie.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I actually...don't do this.
dialog: MAN
dialog: What?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: The...talking to you part.
dialog: MAN
dialog: I understand.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: You seem very nice and everything.
dialog: MAN
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: But I think it's better this way.
dialog: MAN
dialog: Of course.
dialog: They resume their non-talking. After a bit...
speaker_heading: MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: She's a lesbian now, my wife.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Really?
dialog: MAN
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: No. I'm just bitter. She's actually with some giant guy named Douggie.
dialog: Leila indulges him with a slight smile. More silence.
speaker_heading: MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: We, uh, were just about to leave. I don't suppose you would want to get a cup of coffee with us?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I wouldn't?
dialog: MAN
dialog: You would?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: No. I just wondered why you thought I wouldn't.
dialog: MAN
dialog: So you won't.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I'm actually pretty busy. Not now, of course, but -- well, soon. Thanks, though.
dialog: MAN
dialog: Sure.
text: The disappointed man heads off towards his niece. After a moment, he turns back.
speaker_heading: MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: So why'd you name your dog after an anti-depressant?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Look at him!
text: He gives her a puzzled look, the dog gives him a puzzled look, and they continue on. Leila watches them go.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. LEILA'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: Leila stirs a pot of macaroni and cheese, while talking on a portable phone. She looks exasperated. Paxil follows her every move.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: No, I'm not trying to sell you anything...I understand that, but I'm not the person who rents out clowns...I'm sure you do want his little birthday party to be special...Who wouldn't?...Hello?
text: She pulls the phone away from her ear, and looks at it. Another night shot to hell.
dialog: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: INT. LEILA'S LOFT -- NIGHT
text: As before, except Leila is now seated. The CAMERA takes a while to find her. A plate of half-eaten food gets cold. She crosses a name off a list while she speaks.
speaker_heading: LEILA (O.S.)
dialog: Mrs. Barrows? My name is Leila Sweet. You mistakenly called my number when you were trying to reach "Clowns to Go." Their number is the same as mine, but it's 718. See, I get a lot of messages from people looking for clowns, and...I'm sorry? Okay. I'll hold.
text: Leila leans back in her seat and sighs. She notices a framed photograph nestled in a cluster of them, and picks it up.

dialog: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: INT. CAR -- DAY
text: PULL OUT from Leila, as a young girl, sitting next to Evy in the back seat of a cherry 1963 Falcon. They are both dressed in expensive, official-looking NASA spacesuits. Up front DADDY, driving, and MOMMY, riding shotgun, are singing a road song:
speaker_heading: MOMMY AND DADDY
dialog: There was a farmer had a dog and Bingo was his name-o.
dialog: (turning to the girls)
dialog: We can't hear you...
text: CU: little Evy and Leila, mouthing the words through their space helmets...their adoring eyes glued on Daddy's adoring eyes...
dialog: ALL
dialog: B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O, and Bingo was his name--ohhhhhhh!
dialog: As the car passes out of frame we hear the SCREECH of tires, CRUNCH of twisted metal.
text: The CAMERA finds a billboard welcoming visitors to the space center, while a lone hubcap rolls into frame.
dialog: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: INT. LEILA'S LOFT -- NIGHT
text: CU Leila's face as she remembers. Widen to show the phone in her lap. After a moment lost in thought Leila walks to the kitchen, dumps her plate in the sink, pulls off a Post-It and writes a note to herself.
dialog: She slaps it on the refrigerator next to the others, and hits the lights. We can't read it.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (to Paxil)
dialog: C'mon boy.
dialog: As they exit, we move in on the note: "HAVE A CHILD".
dialog: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: INT. LEILA'S LOBBY -- MORNING
text: Leila again scoops up an unwanted pile of delivery menus. She produces a homemade "NO MENUS" sign, posts it on the outside lobby door, and takes a moment to admire her work before heading out.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. RESTAURANT -- MORNING
dialog: Evy digs into her bagel and lox. Leila toys with biscotti.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Can I ask you something?
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Shoot.
dialog: Leila begins to speak and then notices something.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Is that my shirt?
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Oh, yeah. How does it look?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: It looks like...my shirt!
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Sorry. I was all out.

dialog: Is that what you wanted to ask me?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: No.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Look. we both had the same odd, orphaned upbringing, right?
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Emphasis on "odd".
dialog: LEILA
dialog: So how come I dysfunctioned and you didn't?
dialog: Evy doesn't look up from her breakfast.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Sex.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I thought that might be it.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Uh, huh.
dialog: Beat.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Well, I've decided to have some.
dialog: Evy's eyes go wide.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Oh, god.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Actually, I NEED to have some.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Oh, God.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I want to have a child.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: But...why?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I'm going to ask you some questions and you have to answer them because you're my sister.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Waiter!
dialog: A waiter approaches the table.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Like, what exactly does it mean to be, you know, "good in bed"?
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Naked and peppy.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: She's not asking you. Go away.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: You called me.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Oh, right. I'll have a really huge Bloody Mary. Hold the red stuff.
text: The waiter glances at his watch. It's ten in the morning. Impressive.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: (to Leila)
dialog: And for you?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Am I the kind of person you would have sex with? You know -- hypothetically?
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: (to Evy)
dialog: This a trick question, right?.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Tell you what. Skip the drink. We'll take a check.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: You didn't finish your food.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: EXT. SKATING RINK -- DAY
dialog: Evy and Leila skate side by side and talk about Leila's sex life.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: This is not a pretty mental picture?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Gee, thanks.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: 'Cause you know, it's one thing to talk about, another to actually visualize.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (sternly)
dialog: Maybe that's because you're trying too hard.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: (still thinking)
dialog: No, really. I can't even get your clothes off.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: EVY!
dialog: Leila walks on as Evy follows.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Okay, sorry. It's just funny, Leila. I mean, for ten years you've been locked up tighter than a nun and all of a sudden, you want the Kama Sutra.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Just the part that gets you pregnant.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: That's the last chapter. First you've got dinner, drinks, HIS life story, a couple of ego strokes and a minute or two of serious headboard slamming.
dialog: Leila makes a face.
speaker_heading: EVY (CONT'D)
dialog: When that gets old, you marry one of them. Say, in my case...
dialog: (pointedly)
dialog: ...next Saturday.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Could we back up a bit? Like to "hello"?
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: This is really basic stuff, Leila. I mean like "Girl 101".
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I guess I missed class.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Well, then, let's see. Okay. You know there are working parts, right?
dialog: LEILA

text: Two WAITRESSES (late teens) sit in a booth, slacking. DARCY, the punked-out smartass smokes a cigarette while DOTTIE, not the sharpest knife in the drawer, shuffles Tarot cards.
text: Leila plods in and looks back out the window towards the packed coffee bar on the corner.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Nellie's Deli is killing us.
dialog: Darcy discreetly hides the Nellie's Deli cappuccino she had been drinking.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Bummer.
text: With trepidation, Dottie turns over a card. Darcy squints at the supine man with the swords in his back..
speaker_heading: DOTTIE

speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Looks like the bartender at "Vivisection".
dialog: (off Dottie's shocked look)

dialog: 'Good morning, Boss.'
speaker_heading: DOTTIE AND DARCY
dialog: (rote, sing-song)
dialog: Good morning, Boss.

speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Oh, your sister called. Who's Beverly Kirk?
dialog: Leila comes out with a tray of fresh muffins.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I don't know. Why?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Because you got an appointment with her in, like, ten minutes. Evy says don't be late.
dialog: An exasperated Leila rushes to put the muffins out.
speaker_heading: DARCY (CONT'D)
dialog: Shrink?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: The hole in your stomach?

speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: But, Leila, you're sort of a virgin.

speaker_heading: DARCY

speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I get you anything else?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I may not be back in time to serve you your lunch.
text: Leila leaves quickly. Darcy pushes away her mug of coffee and retrieves the cappuccino from her lap.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE

dialog: No...
dialog: NURSE
dialog: What?
dialog: LEILA

dialog: 'F'
dialog: NURSE

dialog: Sorry. That's why there's no clock in here.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: (extending a glove)
dialog: I'm Dr...Kirk.

dialog: LEILA
dialog: (dazed)
dialog: As in... 'Beverly'?
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: (equally dazed)
dialog: Yes, well. My mother claims it's British.

dialog: Fighting closed the back of her examination gown.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Thank you. That won't be necessary...Horrifying?
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Not, of course, what I meant at all. Embarrassing is what I meant...I mean, for me, that is...Um. Do you know that's on backwards?
dialog: She looks down at her gown.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I thought they were supposed to be.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Not...here.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Should I turn it around?
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: (uncomfortable smile)
dialog: We'll manage.

dialog: So. You'd like to start a family. That's lovely.
dialog: (beat)

dialog: LEILA
dialog: Yes.
dialog: DR. KIRK

dialog: I tell you what. Let's start with a routine exam, and then when you leave I'll recommend an ovulation kit. The instructions are on the package.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: All of them?
text: He looks up in response, only to be distracted by the new words on his blackboard: Man, Woman, Birth, Death, Infinity.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry. I was bored.
dialog: For Dr. Kirk, what she's written is apparently so fraught with meaning, he can't even talk about it.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: It can be erased.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: You wrote this? ... It's...It's...
dialog: Words fail him. He's completely floored.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: It's from Ben Casey. Not even a real doctor. Not even a real sentence.
dialog: Not to Dr. Kirk.
dialog: DR KIRK
dialog: There used to be symbols...
dialog: He takes the Magic Marker and draws the symbols for Man and Woman, hesitates at Birth, goes on to draw Death and Infinity.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: I can't remember the one for 'Birth.'
text: Kirk wracks his brain for the answer, while Leila waits patiently on the exam table.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Um, Doctor...?
dialog: DR KIRK
dialog: (snapping out of it)
dialog: Yes, of course. Sorry.
text: He goes to her, gingerly pulls down the gown, puts a stethoscope to her chest and listens.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: I'm having trouble finding...
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Your ears are on your...
text: Points to his neck. With dignity, Dr. Kirk fixes his stethoscope.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Quite right.
dialog: He pauses.
speaker_heading: DR. KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: Would you be more comfortable if the nurse were present?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: NO! No, thank you.
text: She is definitely stealing a look back at him as he again puts the stethoscope to her heart. This time we clearly HEAR-thump thump thump: she really has one.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. MUFFIN SHOP -- DAY
dialog: Darcy rests in a booth painting her nails black while Dottie refills the sugar dispensers.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: What did she say?
dialog: Leila moves back and forth behind the counter, straightening up.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: The doctor was a Man named 'Beverly.'
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: That must have been a big hit in the school yard.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: He was soft-spoken and kind. Naturally, I didn't know how to talk to him.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: Was he single?
dialog: Leila cleans up the sugar that Dottie spills at every station.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (appalled)
dialog: How should I know? He's a doctor, not a dating service.
dialog: (off their stares)
dialog: Yes, he's single. Okay?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Aren't you leaving something out?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: What? I went to the doctor. I bought a kit.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I hope it includes a DICK.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Good Lord, Darcy!
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Leila, you haven't even had a date like this whole decade...
dialog: LEILA
dialog: You're counting...?
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: You need to have sex to have a child, Leila...
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: ...unless this cloning thing takes off...
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Thank you both for your interest.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: And even if you pay for it, you need a date to have sex.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I don't want to talk about this anymore. It's private.
dialog: Leila goes to the kitchen to get a trash bag. She peeks out again.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: Go back to your coven.
text: A MAN (30's)enters the shop. He's wearing a baseball cap, and dark glasses, which he never removes.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Yuk. It's the Customer.
dialog: Dottie sighs and walks behind the counter.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: (pouring his coffee, cheerful)
dialog: Welcome to Sweet's Muffin Shop. Would you like to hear a list of our muffins today?
dialog: CUSTOMER
dialog: What's YOUR problem?
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: Leila wants us to be nicer.
dialog: CUSTOMER
dialog: All right, Dottie. Let me hear a list of your muffins today.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: Cranberry.
dialog: CUSTOMER
dialog: I'll have one of those.
dialog: The Customer removes his leather jacket. There's a flesh-colored nicotine PATCH on his arm.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: (dumbfounded by patch)
dialog: What happened? You get shot?
dialog: CUSTOMER
dialog: It's a nicotine patch.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: (disgusted)
dialog: Like you don't get enough from smoking.
dialog: Customer shakes his head in amazement, as Leila crosses.
dialog: CUSTOMER
dialog: Hey, Leila.
dialog: Barely a glance, as Leila shovels uneaten muffins into the trash bag.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Hello.
dialog: Leila grabs her coat and drags the bag towards the side door.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: See you tomorrow, Dottie. Will you lock up?
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: You want to come out with us tonight? We're gonna get tattoos!
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Thank you. I already have...plans.
dialog: She hurries out.
dialog: CUSTOMER
dialog: All I said was "hey".
dialog: (mopey)
dialog: It's like I'm invisible.
dialog: Dottie and Darcy look at him.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. DR. KIRK'S OFFICE -- MAGIC HOUR
text: Music cue starts. Dr. Kirk stands at an easel in his office, writing out the five words Leila wrote on the blackboard in his exam room. Then he draws the symbols, again struggling to remember the one for Birth. He stands back, transfixed.
dialog: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: EXT. LEILA'S LOFT -- MAGIC HOUR
text: CRANE UP from Dottie and Darcy locking up the shop to Leila silhouetted in her living room window, looking out over the city. She holds a portable phone in her hand.
dialog: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: EXT. NEW YORK STREET -- NIGHT
text: A deserted corner of a seedy street. A RUSTY BLUE CHEVROLET with the muffler hanging on for dear life comes into frame and screeches to a halt. The back door of the car opens and a beat-up stuffed DOG is tossed out. Moments later two CHILDREN (9 and 6) clamber out onto the damp road. One is a Boy and the other a Girl. They could be siblings, except he's black and she's white. The car takes off with a roar. The children remain sitting on the street, stunned. A moment, and then the Chevrolet reverses into frame. The back door opens again and two TWINKIES, one after the other, fly out onto the pavement beside the two children. The car takes off again. This time for good. The Boy picks up the Twinkies, the Girl picks up the dog. He takes her hand and they walk away from camera down the deserted road.
dialog: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: INT. LEILA'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Leila steps out of her bathroom and reads the results of the ovulation test. Fertile as Iowa loam. She looks at herself in the mirror.
dialog: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: INT. DR. KIRK'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
text: The nurse enters the now empty office. She angrily tears the paper off the easel, smashes it into a ball, and chucks it in the waste paper basket. Music ends.
dialog: FADE OUT:
dialog: FADE IN:
dialog: EXT. ERNEST AND MAMMY'S HOUSE -- DAY
dialog: Leila approaches the brownstone and heads up the stairs.
dialog: INT. ERNEST AND MAMMY'S LIBRARY -- DAY
text: Leila enters the library. An open laptop sits on the etage, screen-saved by the flying toasters.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Mammy? Uncle Ernest?
dialog: A voice from another room.
speaker_heading: MAMMY (O.S.)
dialog: We're in the bath, dear. Won't be a sec.
text: Leila sits by the computer, scared of it. She touches the mouse tentatively. The screen pops up saying: "'Welcome to the Web.' To continue, press Enter." She does.
dialog: COMPUTER
dialog: Welcome to the Web. Do you wish to browse? Press "Y" or "N".
text: Leila starts. The computer is talking to her in a slightly exaggerated "computer voice." She presses "Y".
speaker_heading: COMPUTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you wish to access a conference on the subject of your choice? Press "Y" or "N".
text: Leila presses "Y". A bulletin board of topics currently being discussed online flashes up. Since Leila does nothing, the computer once again prompts her.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER (CONT'D)
dialog: If you are unable to select a topic, would you like assistance? Press "Y" or "N".
dialog: Leila presses "Y".
speaker_heading: COMPUTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you have an interest in gardening, politics, film, music, literature, sports, virtual reality...or sex?
dialog: Leila stares at the screen in horror.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (with attitude)
dialog: Do you have an interest?
dialog: No response.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (more attitude)
dialog: Do you have a problem?
dialog: No response.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (almost mad)
dialog: What's wrong with you?
text: Leila abruptly closes the lid of the laptop -- which then beeps at her -- forcing her to pull the plug from the outlet. Switching over to battery, the computer continues to beep. Leila puts a pillow over the contraption.
text: Mammy and Ernest approach from behind in robes that reflect their personalities: Mammy's -- floral and bright; Ernest's -- Brooks Brothers and muted. Mammy nips at his ever-present glass of Sherry.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: I'm sorry, dear.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (to Ernest)
dialog: That thing yelled at me.
dialog: Ernest grumbles his way to turn off the beeping computer.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: Can't imagine why.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: (trying to avoid a potential situation)
dialog: Honey, can I fix you a snack?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: No thanks, Mammy. I should go to work soon.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: Hah!
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: (warning)
dialog: Ernest.
dialog: Mammy heads for the kitchen.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: The word just comes out of her mouth funny.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (to Mammy)
dialog: I saw Evy yesterday.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: And how is your sister?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: She's working on another fish story for the magazine.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: One uses the Ivy League education I paid for to write about food. The other to serve it.
dialog: Mammy returns with milk and cookies, to Leila's dismay.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I think she's getting cold feet.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: Perfectly natural. Which reminds me. We absolutely must get the measurements for your dress.
dialog: Mammy searches in the sideboard drawer for a tape measure.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Please... not today, Mammy.
dialog: Mammy starts measuring Leila's hips, her waist, her bust.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: I understand you've got a new doctor.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Are there any secrets in this family?
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: How did you find him?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Evy found him.
dialog: (to Mammy)
dialog: I'm a size six, OK?
dialog: Mammy measures the distance from the nape of Leila's neck to her waist and writes it down.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: So far, except for the rise, the exact same as Evy.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Mammy, I'm four inches taller.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: That's okay. Now let me just measure your rise...for the little white panties.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: (wounded)
dialog: Fine. Provide your own panties.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: NO PROBLEM.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: I know how you found the doctor, but how did you find him? Handsome?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Competent.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: Bullshit. He's a hunk.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: How would you know?
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: (indicating computer)
dialog: Evy E-mailed his file.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: God.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: If you can't give it up for a cute, single doctor -- I'll shoot your dog.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: He's not trying to pressure you, dear.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: Yes I am.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Let me remind you all, I am not marriage-minded. I hate love, I hate marriage, I hate white dresses...
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: No, you don't. You were a beautiful bride.
text: Horrified at his own indiscretion, Mammy puts his hand over his mouth.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: WHAT!? You can say it. I was dumped at the altar. Stood up. Humiliated. And now, dear Uncles, since you can only nourish yourselves so long on the shame of THAT event, here's a new morsel: I intend to give birth to a child. Forthwith.
dialog: The two uncles stare at each other.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: Immaculately?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Vaginally.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: As soon as I can figure out how.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: Not another dime to Harvard, Mammy. Hear me? Not one red cent.

dialog: When I say push, push hard. And don't freak out if there's a little blood.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE (O.S.)
dialog: Won't it hurt?
text: TURN AROUND to reveal Darcy, covered in a barber's smock, sitting in a chair while Dottie holds ice to the top portion of her left ear. A piercing is in progress.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Only for a second. Just make sure you get all the way through. Catch the needle with the cork.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: Got it.
text: Leila shudders and looks back down at something she's been writing, while the Customer, behind the counter, pours himself a coffee refill. Business as usual at the muffin shop.
dialog: CUSTOMER
dialog: Have you got any cream?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Check the fridge.
dialog: Customer walks to the kitchen.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: We're out.
dialog: Customer makes a u-turn.
speaker_heading: DARCY (CONT'D)
dialog: OK. Ready? One, two, three, GO!

speaker_heading: DARCY (CONT'D)
dialog: Ohhh!
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: Gross!
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Good. Now just leave it there for a minute or two until it takes.

dialog: (off an unseen nod)
dialog: I'm in.
text: Evy sits across the table from prospective candidates. We see photos and what appear to be medical records piling up. Leila sits off to the side, horrified at the can of worms she's opened. A video camera rests on a tripod between them, running. They've been at this a while.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: You mentioned in your questionnaire that you had four children. Can I ask if you're still in touch with them?
dialog: Turn around on...
dialog: MAN 2
dialog: Oh, as "in touch" as the next guy, I suppose. You know teenagers. They definitely have a mind of their own.
speaker_heading: EVY

speaker_heading: EVY (CONT'D)

dialog: I almost didn't come over. The whole thing seemed so, I don't know, clinical. But then I realized the kind of sacrifice you're making for this baby and I thought -- maybe I could help.
dialog: Evy looks up at Mr. Perfect and then, hopefully, across at Leila. He's got their attention.
speaker_heading: MAN 3 (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought maybe, I had been chosen to help. That the Virgin of the Plains was risen to smite down the rough beast and that I, the foul spawn of indifference, had found purchase on the honeyed trail.

speaker_heading: SLAPPY

dialog: INT./EXT. LEILA'S LOFT -- NIGHT
text: CU -- Bottom of the outer door to Leila's building. A bunch of menus come under the door. A hand pushes them back outside. In again, out again. A tug-of-war-to-the-death over a "Pizza Perfect" delivery menu.

speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: Did I ask you if you wanted any menus, lady? I didn't ask you if you wanted any menus. I don't care if you want menus.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Well, I don't.
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: Good. Because I don't want to crawl around like a reptile passing the damn things out. So that makes us even. Except for you hit me in the head with a door. Which makes it not so even.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (innocently)
dialog: I'm really sorry about that. It was an accident.
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: Accident? Lady, you hit me in the head with a door.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Oh, don't be so dramatic. I barely bumped you.
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: You took aim!
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Did not.
dialog: Menu Man pulls open the door.
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: Put your head by the door, here. Let me give you a little "bump."
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Do you want some ice for that?
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: I want to know what you were doing in your pajamas on the other side of that door. You weren't leaving, obviously, and I don't think you were out walking around like that. So I can only guess you were waiting to assault my head with that door.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (defensively)
dialog: Oh, poor you.
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: Damn right, poor me. If I don't hand these out, I don't eat.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Well, if you had bothered to read my sign, none of this would have happened.
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: I read your sign. I ignored it. That's how I make money.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Which is another thing. Aren't you a bit ... attractive to be doling out menus for a living?
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Nothing. Except you could be, like... a supermodel.
speaker_heading: MENU MAN

speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Dottie, that's so sad.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE

text: Darcy shushes her when she notices Leila and the Menu Man in a booth, slumped over a couple of cartons of milk, asleep. They approach carefully, stunned by the sight of the handsome young man.
text: They attempt to pick up a dreadlock to get a better look at his face. Leila wakes up and sees her staff.

speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: Him.

dialog: Oh. Yes. He's quite remarkably handsome. But he doesn't like to hear it.

speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: She means how'd you find a friend?

dialog: On the street -- he's a starving artist.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: That explains the donut.
text: Leila stands, looking as dignified as she can in her pajamas, grabs the not-donut from Dottie and walks towards the door leading upstairs to her apartment.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: It's not a donut, and I have to take it somewhere. When he wakes up, give him whatever he wants.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: Don't worry.

speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: Uh, what ropes?

speaker_heading: DARCY

text: Menu Man pokes at the muffin in front of him and eyes it suspiciously. He decides to stick with coffee. Dottie and Darcy solemnly approach.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: We're supposed to tell you what to do around here.
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: I'm listening.
dialog: Menu Man walks behind the counter to the kitchen. The girls follow.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: As you can see, business is not an issue. But there is still something that desperately...needs doing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That would be the Boss.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: You have to tell her about the birds and the bees.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Or barring that, how to get boned.
dialog: He begins to gather pots, pans and ingredients from the shelves.
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: Consider it done.
dialog: The girls exchange a look.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: You did her?
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: She's been clued.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: Right here?
dialog: Menu Man begins to make himself a fabulous-looking omelet.
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: (enjoying himself)
dialog: Right here. Six hours of good, hard, honest...talking.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: Wuz that a slam?
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: She was a bit confused about "penis".
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Who isn't?
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: Straight up? You guys make the worst muffins I've ever tasted.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: The Customer likes them.
text: They look in the Customer's direction. He's slumped over in his seat, a nicotine patch on each arm, lighting one cigarette off the end of another. Point taken.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. DR. KIRK'S OFFICE -- MORNING
dialog: Kirk opens the door to find Leila standing there. She's drenched.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I don't have an appointment.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Please. Come in.
dialog: He ushers her into his office, and gives her a hand towel.
speaker_heading: DR. KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: I apologize about Timmy. He's mad at his mother for being pregnant.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (looking at her wet clothes)
dialog: Me too.
dialog: Leila hands Kirk the cardboard symbol, now dripping and limp.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: Here, it's...birth.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: You found it!
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I'm sorry it's so messy.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Usually is.
dialog: Kirk delicately transports the wet card towards the easel, looking at it oddly.
speaker_heading: DR. KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: Circles. I don't remember circles.
text: He erases the "?" next to "Birth" on his reworked design, tacks up the donut, and stands back with a sense of accomplishment.
speaker_heading: DR. KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: So...
text: Still doesn't look right. He crosses to his desk and picks up a folder.
dialog: DR KIRK
dialog: I've got your exam results back and everything looks...normal.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (cheerfully)
dialog: I'm normal?
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Well, not "normal" -- that sounds like "average" -- which of course I don't mean. You're certainly way, way above average, like, I don't know, -- "spectacular"...uh, the point being, I can't see any reason you shouldn't be able to have a child.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If you want to.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Would you like a grapefruit juice?
text: Kirk tries to calm himself down. Leila shakes her head and points to her stomach.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Ulcer.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Ulcer. Yes. You mentioned that.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: You have read my chart then?
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: I'm nearly through it. You have wonderful penmanship.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I suppose I was a little...thorough.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: No. No. I learned you have very good... teeth.
dialog: (adding quickly)
dialog: Not that it matters to me, of course.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Good thing you're not my dentist.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: And that you had a fine education. Which you used to... become a waitress in a donut shop.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (with dignity)
dialog: Proprietor. Muffins.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: (getting worked up)
dialog: And that your height and weight are perfect, not to mention your skin, of course, and your eyes... Your hair is... looks, uh, healthy.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Oh, and your heart. You have a good one -- I mean, I heard it...
dialog: Kirk braves an uncertain glance at her.
speaker_heading: DR. KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: Would you go out with me?
dialog: Decidedly pregnant pause.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I really can't.
dialog: DR KIRK
dialog: Of course not. I'm sorry.
dialog: Kirk looks like he wants to crawl in a hole.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: No. It's just that I had a date once. A wedding date. He broke it.
dialog: DR KIRK
dialog: I shouldn't have asked.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: It's okay. But I made this vow never to do that again.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: "That" being me, specifically? Just to be clear?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Exactly. No. I mean, I don't, "go out" with anyone. Not that I'm against it or anything -- just that it leads to...
dialog: DR KIRK
dialog: Intercourse?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: You got pretty far in my chart.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: If there were scissors present, Kirk would cut out his tongue.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I was actually referring to love and marriage. Those two I don't do. The other -- thing -- well, I just haven't done yet. That's why I'm here.
text: Kirk's eyes go wide. Dare he dream? The nurse, as usual, finds some non-reason to enter the room. She smirks at the easel.
dialog: NURSE
dialog: That's not birth.
dialog: LEILA/KIRK
dialog: What!?
dialog: NURSE
dialog: Birth's not a donut. It's an upside-down triangle.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Your source?
dialog: NURSE
dialog: The Web. Yours?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: A...poet.
dialog: NURSE
dialog: I think we have a loser.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Thank you, Jean.
text: Nurse puts some files on the table by the door and exits with a smirk. Kirk and Leila look at each other for a moment.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (suddenly self-conscious)
dialog: I should go now. Timmy's probably out there...squirting things. I just wanted to -- give birth to you. The...sign.
dialog: Leila rushes out. Kirk looks perplexed.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. DR. KIRK'S WAITING ROOM -- DAY
dialog: Leila heads through the waiting room on her way out.
dialog: NURSE
dialog: FART!
dialog: Leila freezes.
speaker_heading: NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: That's it, isn't it? The "F" word. Fart. FART. FART. PANTIES! FART!
dialog: Where's that door.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: EXT. NEW YORK STREET -- NIGHT
text: The abandoned Boy and Girl, both exhausted, descend the stairs leading from the park. As they walk towards us, the girl drags her little stuffed dog at her side. As they clear frame and walk away from us, the dog is gone.
text: The CAMERA finds the dog lying in the street, just before a LIMOUSINE crushes it. A squeal of brakes. The limo backs up, a jeweled hand reaches out and grabs the pooch, and the car heads off down the street in a cloud of steam.
dialog: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: EXT. NEW YORK STREET -- NIGHT
text: Dr. Kirk strolls under the street lamps of a deserted New York street, his head cast down, his collar turned up. Very Edward Hopper. As he approaches the entrance to an upscale restaurant, the limo turns a corner and comes towards us.
text: A YOUNG COUPLE hops out. They're beautifully dressed and stupendously drunk. They whirl through the restaurant's front door. Then, the woman spins out again, crying gaily:
speaker_heading: DOG WOMAN
dialog: Not without the children!
text: She dives back into the limo and returns holding FIVE STUFFED DOGS. As she whisks through the door again, the little girl's dog flies out of her arms and lands in the bushes.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Wait.
text: Dr. Kirk waits for the woman to spin back around, but the door stays closed. Meanwhile, the limo drives off.
text: Dr. Kirk looks back and forth between the dog and the restaurant entrance. He looks through the window for the couple--rather easy to locate because now they are seated at a table with four Collies.
dialog: He sets the mutt next to the door, so it can be found by its owners on the way out.
speaker_heading: DR. KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: Tough break, pooch. The others are ordering steak.
dialog: He begins to walk away, but turns to look back at the dog.
text: He stands there for an inordinately long time--wrestling with some kind of question of conscience. Then he suddenly comes back, snatches up the dog and strides off.
dialog: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: INT. BAR -- NIGHT
text: The place is mostly empty. Dr. Kirk puts the dog on the bar, and takes a seat on a stool. A DRUNK looks on from further down. The BARTENDER, 20s, good-looking, bemused, comes over.
dialog: BARTENDER
dialog: (after a suitable silence)
dialog: What's with the guard dog?
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: He wasn't as...pretty as the collies. So they dumped him.
dialog: BARTENDER
dialog: Who dumped him?
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: His rich, indifferent owners. Didn't even know he was gone.
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Some people shouldn't have dogs and others, who truly deserve them, can't have them.
dialog: BARTENDER
dialog: Like for instance...?
dialog: Dr. Kirk has to think about it.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: ...orphans.
dialog: BARTENDER
dialog: Okay. Orphans.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Orphans do not have beautiful dogs with bows on their heads.
dialog: BARTENDER
dialog: What about Annie?
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: She's an exception.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And she's a cartoon.
dialog: BARTENDER
dialog: So what are you having?
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: What's good?
dialog: BARTENDER
dialog: What's 'good'? Gee, scotch is good. Vodka. Gin is interesting, but my Mommy tells me not to serve it to girls, 'cause it shows up in the face...Who asks that?
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Sorry. I don't know that much about drinking. I guess I'll start with...Vodka. No, Scotch. Just...Gimme one of each.
text: The bartender stares at him with a bottle in each hand. The drunk in the corner rolls his eyes.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. LEILA'S LOFT -- MORNING
dialog: Evy lets herself in with a key.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Hello? Leila?
dialog: No answer.
text: Evy unloads a shopping bag of goodies in Leila's kitchen: lotions, some pornographic magazines, a video or two, some lingerie. She puts a bottle of champagne in the fridge, and is about to do the same with some fresh, raw oysters. Paxil jumps on a stool.
speaker_heading: EVY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hi, Postum.
dialog: Paxil stands on his hind legs. Evy scoops a few oysters in his bowl.
speaker_heading: EVY (CONT'D)
dialog: They're oysters. You'll like 'em.
text: The phone rings. Evy answers on the portable and heads for Leila's bedroom with the lingerie.
speaker_heading: EVY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello? Hello?
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: You have the wrong number.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. LEILA'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: Evy enters still on the phone, and fishes around in Leila's closet for some clothes to "borrow".
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: I said, you have the wrong number.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: OK. What kind of clown do you want.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Nope, sorry. He died in a freak piñata accident. But thanks for calling.
text: She hangs up, stuffs the scarf she has snared into her bag, and walks back to the kitchen.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. LEILA'S KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: Evy puts the phone down, writes "I fed myself" on a Post-It, sticks it on the dog, and is out the door.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. MUFFIN SHOP -- DAY
text: Evy enters the muffin shop, not particularly surprised to find a basin filled with grape Kool-Aid, and Darcy's head in it. Dottie stands above her monitoring the dye job.
dialog: Customer is unusually perky, as he devours an actual lunch.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Where'd he get...food?
text: Dottie motions toward the kitchen where Menu Man kneads a pile of sourdough. Evy is instantly struck by his looks.
speaker_heading: EVY (CONT'D)
dialog: Who's he?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: A stray. Leila adopted him.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: (to Menu Man)
dialog: Hey, who are you?
text: Menu Man looks up, biceps rippling, chest hair glistening, flour flecking...
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: Strictly "need-to-know" basis.
dialog: Her peek at Menu Man says "Mysterious AND Cute".
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: (to girls)
dialog: Have you guys seen Leila? She's not upstairs.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Tight ship, as always. This place is like the Microsoft of muffin shops.
dialog: Dottie beams until a glance from Darcy lets her know that wasn't a compliment.
speaker_heading: EVY (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Darcy)
dialog: Nice 'do.
text: Rack focus past the dripping Darcy to Menu Man. A serious look is exchanged. Evy shudders and leaves.
dialog: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ERNEST AND MAMMY'S KITCHEN -- AFTERNOON
dialog: Mammy ducks his head in the refrigerator.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: You're skin and bones. I'm making you a Tin Roof.
text: Leila sits on a stool at the kitchen "island". Mammy pulls out hot fudge, ice cream and peanuts.
speaker_heading: MAMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: It's your Uncle's favorite. Every bite could kill him.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Mammy, you're kind of like a woman, right?
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: It's a good thing I love you, dear.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: No, you know what I mean. You're...softer than Uncle.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: Thank you, sweetie.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: You still have sex with him, don't you?
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: You are aware that normal people don't talk like this?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Well, when you do, does a big bell go off or something, because I've interviewed some men and, I don't think I've got a bell, Mammy.
dialog: Mammy kisses the top of her head.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: It's just in a different key, dear. Wait for the right song.
dialog: INT. ERNEST AND MAMMY'S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON
text: They take their sundaes into the living room, where Uncle Ernest sits in his half-moon glasses reading The Wall Street Journal.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (jokingly, to Mammy)
dialog: So how is he, really.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: (without looking up)
dialog: Funny.
dialog: Leila plops down next to him.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I hired somebody new at the muffin shop.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: Bankruptcy lawyer?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: More of a poet.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: Really, dear, a poet? What kind?
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: What kind? There are no kinds. There are good ones and bad ones.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: There are rich ones and poor ones.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: Name a rich one.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: Alright, there are dead ones and live ones.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: All the dead ones are good ones. Plus I expect my niece had enough sense to hire a live one.
dialog: (to Leila)
dialog: He is alive, isn't he?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: He's poor.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: There. Case closed.
dialog: (of Mammy's Tin Roof)
dialog: Did you ever think that I might want one of those?
dialog: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: INT. ERNEST AND MAMMY'S HOUSE -- LATER
dialog: PAN past Leila as she reads to her dozing Uncles.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: ...Concern about an overheating economy and inflationary indicators prompted the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates Monday, and while it is not clear whether this is an isolated adjustment or the first in a series of corrective

dialog: measures, economists warn that the stock market is likely to overreact to the news as evidenced by the hundred and thirty-six point drop in the Dow yesterday...
text: Ernest is sound asleep, Mammy tucked in against his shoulder. Three empty Tin Roof glasses sit on the table in front of them.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. LEILA'S LOFT -- NIGHT
text: Leila drags herself in, dog-tired and reading her mail. She takes off Paxil's Post-It, fails to read it, and absently slaps it on the refrigerator. She picks up Paxil's bowl and sees it's half full -- of oysters.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Paxil, you fed yourself. What a great dog.
text: Leila hits the playback on her answering machine as she sorts through the mail.
speaker_heading: ANGRY VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: You may think your little crack about the piñata accident was funny but I can assure you I do not. As it is, my little Jimmy is going bowling with his sisters on his birthday instead of hosting a fabulous party with all the most popular boys and your clown. Hope you're happy -- BITCH.
dialog: As Leila stares at the phone, a voice comes from the street below.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Hello? Hello? Are you there?
dialog: Leila crosses to the window and looks down.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. LEILA'S LOFT -- NIGHT
dialog: It's the Gingerbread Man, carrying a shopping bag.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: GINGERBREAD MAN
dialog: It's me. Slappy.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: You're not Slappy. He's got...a face.
speaker_heading: GINGERBREAD MAN
dialog: Okay, so I'm -- the Gingerbread Man. Look. Do you think I could come up and change my clothes. Please.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: GINGERBREAD MAN
dialog: Why do I want to, or why should you let me?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Well, both.
speaker_heading: GINGERBREAD MAN
dialog: I want to because it's late, and this is New York, and apparently I'm even more fun to set on fire than dumpsters.
dialog: A familiar face leans out an upstairs window.
dialog: MAN
dialog: Hey you. Ginger Snap.
speaker_heading: GINGERBREAD MAN
dialog: WHAT?
dialog: MAN
dialog: Fuck off.
speaker_heading: GINGERBREAD MAN
dialog: O-kay
dialog: (to Leila)
dialog: And...you should let me because...because I'm a cookie, for Christsakes.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Do you have a business card?
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. LEILA'S LOFT -- NIGHT
dialog: Leila holds the card.
speaker_heading: GINGERBREAD MAN
dialog: (pointing to the card)
dialog: Eddie. Head clown.
dialog: Paxil comes up for a sniff.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Paxil. Head dog.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm Leila.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Like the song?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: There's a song?
dialog: Eddie shakes his head and motions towards the bathroom.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Do you think I could, uh...
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Oh sure, help yourself.
dialog: Eddie heads off with his shopping bag.
text: Leila sniffs at the odd stuff in the dog's food bowl. She's about to place the bowl back on the floor when she notices the porn magazines. Eddie steps out of the bathroom. He has evolved from the Gingerbread Man into a Calvin Klein ad: dark jeans, tight white t-shirt; a FACE.
text: Leila hides the magazines behind her back with one hand and continues to hold the bowl with the other.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (eyeing Leila's bowl)
dialog: What're you having?
dialog: Leila shoves it aside.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I changed my mind. Would you, uh, like...anything? At all? I mean, along the lines of...milk?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Do you have anything along the lines of...Tequila.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: There's a bottle of scotch, but it's ten years old. And it warns you on the label it was eighteen to begin with.
dialog: A disarming smile from Eddie.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (re- cupboard)
dialog: It's up there.
text: Leila stashes the pornos as he retrieves the bottle -- very expensive. Eddie pours two glasses and plops one in front of Leila, who's reasonably well discombobulated.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Looks like you could use some too.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I haven't had any since I was eighteen. Alcohol.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Twelve steps?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Three. I got dumped. I got depressed. I drank a gallon of Blue Nun. Since then, I haven't had the same desire.
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: For it.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What kind of peckerhead would dump a babe like you?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I bet you say that to all the girls.

speaker_heading: INT. LEILA'S LOFT -- LATER

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: G-Gabon.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: "N". Okay, Nepal.
speaker_heading: EDDIE

dialog: Leila raises her eyebrows. That was a good one. She thinks long and hard. She's not completely sober.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: "O". There aren't any "o"s.
dialog: Eddie hands her a shot.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Drink up.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Wait. Okinawa.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Not a country.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (pouty)
dialog: I know. I thought you wouldn't.
dialog: She takes the spoon off her nose.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: That's another shot.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: No fair. You've done this before.
dialog: Leila downs her drink and watches as Eddie heads to the fridge. Did those jeans just get tighter?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: More ice.
dialog: Eddie reaches for the ice, but pulls out and admires the Dom Perignon.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: For someone who doesn't drink you don't drink the best. But you're probably saving this.
text: Leila is now officially wasted. She semi-staggers to a more comfortable couch in the living area.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (more pouty)
dialog: No I'm not. I don't even know how it got there. But we should drink it all, immediately, and be done with it.
dialog: We hear the POP of a champagne cork, some rummaging around.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (O.S.)
dialog: "I fed myself"?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Good for you.
dialog: Eddie brings two glasses to the couch, along with another Post-It.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: "Have a girl"?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I'm trying, okay? Don't pressure me.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (suddenly serious)
dialog: You're married.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Yuk.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Gay?
dialog: Leila shakes her head.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Help me out here, Leila.
text: Leila puts down the glass and begins to kiss her own hand, passionately, with tongue.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: That's my sex life.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm a total...virgin.
text: She moves closer to him on the couch, as his eyes go wide.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: Show me what to do.
dialog: Not quite sure what she means, but completely turned on.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Well, your mouth was a little...slack. You might want to put some muscle in it.
text: He demonstrates a great, taut kiss on his own hand. Leila shakes her head and points to her own lips.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Show me.
text: Eddie leans over and kisses her with enthusiasm. When they come up for air, Leila gets to her feet and takes his hand.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll do.
dialog: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: INT. LEILA'S BEDROOM -- MORNING
text: Camera pans Leila's loft, past the living area, past an empty champagne bottle, past clothes strewn on the floor to...
text: Leila, who lies sprawled on her bed. Her eyes crack open and she is hit with the queasy sensation of her life's second brutal hangover. A Post-It is stuck to her forehead. She pulls it off and reads it:
dialog: INSERT: "I undressed myself"
text: Bleary-eyed and nauseous, she stumbles out of bed and heads for the bathroom. Another Post-It is stuck to the mirror:
dialog: INSERT: "No. We didn't."
dialog: Paxil walks in and looks at her plaintively. He, too, has a Post-It:
dialog: INSERT: "Oman".
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. DR. KIRK'S OFFICE -- MORNING
text: Leila, looking positively green, sits opposite Dr. Kirk. The dog rests conspicuously on the desk between them. They both try to ignore it.
dialog: DR KIRK
dialog: So you didn't actually...have sex, then.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Not according to the evidence.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: GOOD! I mean, well most people like to at least remember their first time so they can pretend years later that they enjoyed it.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: He barely touched me. I mean, this man -- this live, cute man -- shows up at my door -- no interview -- nothing, and...and I wake up with a
dialog: LEILA
dialog: hangover, and a Post-It stuck on my head.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Intact.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: So he's a fool.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Actually, he's a clown.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Subtle distinction.
dialog: Leila takes off her sunglasses, and leans in.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I want tips. Hard tips. Hard as bullets. Right between the eyes. I want it to be scary.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Tips?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Positions. Good ones.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: You do realize that I'm not a fertility expert?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: You're expert enough. I want to know where to put what for one-shot, girl-producing, impregnation. I may not get that many chances.
dialog: Huge pause.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: And I have to answer you?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: You're my doctor.
dialog: If only that weren't true.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Yes. Well, there is a school of thought which believes that... conception...may be more likely to occur if one were to... well if you were to get up on one's...uh,
dialog: Kirk nods discreetly towards the dog.
speaker_heading: DR. KIRK (CONT'D)

dialog: Back?
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Good. So that your long...your, uh...are up in the air.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: My legs?

speaker_heading: MAMMY

dialog: You're trying to make me say that I'm crying, I'm really crying, because ... I was once a kid. With parents. That I once had secret hopes and dreams. That one of those dreams might have been a wedding and a dress and maybe even a groom to go with it.
dialog: (decisively)
dialog: But I'm afraid that's not it. It's that I threw up on my sister's dress. My uncles will have it cleaned. But still, my sister, my baby sister, has to get married in a dress that I barfed on.

dialog: LEILA
dialog: When Evy and I were kids we used to think our father was an astronaut, 'cause there were always space suits lying around. His real job was to make sure the visors on the helmets didn't steam up.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: (pointedly)
dialog: Not everyone's a star.
dialog: A beat, as Leila moves to the couch.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: What's gonna to happen to them?
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: I don't know. I'll make some calls.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I think they should stay here for a while. It'll be good practice for me.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: What about your...mission?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I can postpone that. Still, I think Eddie's an excellent choice. He can name almost every country.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: And people are quick to criticize genetic engineering.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I'm serious.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: All right, seriously then. I'd have to say the...clown in question is not an excellent choice. Less than excellent, in fact. Actually -- insane. Stupendously, mind-numbingly insane.
dialog: Rolling now...
speaker_heading: DR. KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't "practice" on children, Leila. And you don't pick daddies off a Wheaties box. The only thing more idiotic than letting that guy touch you is letting him father your child, and the only thing dumber than that is you having a child in the first place.
dialog: Leila crosses to the corner.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Is that a medical opinion?
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: No. Would you like one.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Umm.
dialog: Kirk chases her as she moves over to the "safety" of her mobile.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Life isn't a balance sheet, Leila. Babies don't offset dead parents, and random...guys...don't make up for busted hearts. Look. You didn't come to my office for positions or ...pregnancy kits. You knew all that stuff when you were fifteen.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Really? Then why did I come.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: For some sort of permission.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I wasn't aware you needed a note from your doctor to lose your virginity.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: No. People manage to do that all the time. But you want it nice and tidy. No fear.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I do.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: When I was about four, my mother was pregnant with my little sister. She asked me if I wanted to touch her stomach and I burst out crying. I thought she had swallowed a baby and that she was going to swallow me.
dialog: Leila turns her back on him and fiddles with the mobile.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: So?
dialog: Close behind her...in her ear...
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: So she told me she loved me more than anything and that I had nothing to be scared of.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: DR. KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: The reason I know -- I mean absolutely know -- that you can love somebody again Leila...is that you're so completely afraid to.
dialog: Leila starts to turn...
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Why are you doing this to me?
text: Kirk gives her a passionate and unexpected kiss. For a moment, it takes. Then Leila's eyes go wide. They are both taken aback.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: Please...I can't.
dialog: Long silence. Kirk moves away.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, I told you from the beginning...
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: I know. You don't do love.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You asked about a medical opinion -- here it is. The only known treatment for fear -- IS love. But it doesn't work if you spit out the pill.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: A long look at her. Then, with finality:
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Know what? Me too.
dialog: He snags his jacket and heads for the door.

text: CU: Leila's face as she sleeps, not all that comfortably, on the couch in the living room. One eye pops open.
dialog: TURN AROUND to find Jack and Red staring at her, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. We don't get the sense that Leila is a morning person.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: What do you want?
dialog: Beat.
dialog: JACK
dialog: Meat loaf.
dialog: Leila ponders her first parental decision.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Okay.

dialog: INT. MUFFIN SHOP -- MORNING
text: Two bowls of oatmeal hit the table in front of the kids. Jack looks up at Dottie with regret.
dialog: JACK
dialog: What a rip.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: Sorry. Orders.
text: Dottie looks over her shoulder at Menu Man, who smiles and shakes his head at Leila.
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: Get up on the stupid side of the bed this morning, Harvard?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Oh, excuse me, Mr. Perfect. Not all of us had mothers, you know.
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: Like I did?
dialog: Jack calls out from the booth.
dialog: JACK
dialog: Can we get some coffee here?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Okay.
dialog: Menu Man scowls at her.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: (sternly, to kids)
dialog: Decaf.
text: As Leila looks back for approval, Evy emerges from Menu Man's room, hastily putting herself together. It's pretty clear she spent the night.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: Evy?
dialog: Deer in the headlights. Stunned looks from everyone in the room, except, of course, Menu Man, who is inscrutable as always.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Oh. Ah. Very awkward moment.
dialog: (motions towards the back room)
dialog: The, uh, room back there...
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: (clears throat)
dialog: I thought maybe I should, uh. Right. Here's the funny part. Um...Okay, fuck it.
text: Evy heads for the door. Blank stares from the crowd, including the ubiquitous Customer. Darcy gives Evy a very discreet thumbs-up.
dialog: JACK
dialog: Fuck it.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: EXT. NEW YORK STREET -- DAY
dialog: Evy and Leila walk down the street carrying shopping bags filled with wedding purchases.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Passing fling. That's all. A little pre-meal snack. Why torture myself? So I lost my mind a little, so what. Perfectly natural. Probably even healthy in the long run. Let's just not everybody go to pieces over this, okay...
text: Evy and Leila walk out of frame as Evy's voice drifts away. A moment layer Jack and Red enter frame happily eating hot pretzels and mustard.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. DR. KIRK'S WAITING ROOM -- DAY
text: Busy day in the waiting room. The Supersoaker kid and his equally obnoxious chum play toss with a plastic vagina. Kirk intercepts, and scolds one of the monsters. He is not a happy camper.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: This is not a toy. Okay? Do you understand? You could seriously hurt somebody with one of these.
dialog: He holds out the vagina to Nurse -- who refuses to take it.
speaker_heading: DR. KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: Where's Mrs. Peters?
dialog: NURSE
dialog: Exam Room B.
dialog: Kirk looks around for a place to stow the vagina, settling on an end table.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Ten minutes, kids. Then we're out of here. Okay?
dialog: Jack and Red sit patiently in the corner.
text: Kirk departs as the SuperSoaker kid gets off a squirt in Red's direction. Jack jumps up and matter-of-factly grabs the toy from the kid's hands.
dialog: JACK
dialog: I don't like guns. Guns scare girls.
dialog: Not as much as Jack scares him.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. ERNEST AND MAMMY'S HOUSE -- EVENING
dialog: Leila reads Dante to Uncle Ernest and Mammy.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (with an increasingly disgusted expression)
dialog: "We now had left him, passing on our way, when I beheld two spirits by the ice pent in one hollow, that the head of one was cowl unto the other; and as bread is raven'd up through hunger, the uppermost did so apply his fangs to the other's brain, where the spine joins it."
text: She looks up to find her uncles asleep in their chairs, holding Jack and Red who are wide-eyed, loving it, and ready for more.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. BAR -- NIGHT
dialog: CU: Kirk's unhappy face, staring straight ahead.
text: Shot widens to include Red on his left and Jack on his right, imitating his sullen expression. Kirk takes a sip of beer, the kids take a sip of Shirley Temple.
dialog: Bartender and Drunk Guy take it all in with a shake of their heads.

dialog: INT. LEILA'S LOFT -- NIGHT
dialog: Leila sits with Paxil talking on the portable phone.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Listen, Eddie. I appreciate what you...almost did to me -- I do. Oh, and under the cape? Very impressive. I know, I've seen videos. Certainly didn't mean to laugh. This just isn't a good time for me -- at all -- and, well, thank you. You've been very kind.
dialog: (about to sign off)
dialog: Oh, by the way. A Mrs. Schwartz is looking for two clowns next Tuesday. I said you were excellent.
dialog: We hear the sound of Eddie's answering machine beep.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. MUFFIN SHOP -- AFTERNOON
dialog: Jack attempts to show Menu Man that he can flip a pancake. The results wind up mostly on Customer.
text: Dottie does a Tarot reading for a completely terrified Red. Leila tends to the few patrons that are there, as Kirk enters.
dialog: Red runs over to hug his leg, but catches him in a sensitive spot instead.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Ow.
dialog: Red looks sad. Kirk tussles her head.
speaker_heading: DR. KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: It's okay, honey.
dialog: (eye contact with Leila)
dialog: Even...metaphorical.
dialog: Jack joins the group.
speaker_heading: DR. KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: You two ready?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I thought they could stay with me tonight.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: That's not the arrangement, Leila.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Well I don't really think they need to spend another night in a bar.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Certainly not when they could be listening to bedtime stories -- about the damnation of their immortal souls.
dialog: Leila drops down to kid level.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: How 'bout it, guys. Do you want to stay here? I rented "Toy Story".
dialog: Oh, yeah...
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Well. That's very...average.
dialog: Also dropping down to kid level.
speaker_heading: DR. KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: I bought a trampoline.
dialog: The one-up battle begins.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (to the kids)
dialog: You can have popcorn and cocoa. As much as you want.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: (to the kids)
dialog: How 'bout Whoppers and beer?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I'll let you stay up all night.
dialog: (to Kirk)
dialog: Plus I have a dog.
dialog: Hard to top that.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: I'll let you drive.
dialog: Not that hard. They stand up and go nose to nose.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I'm sorry I ever let you talk to me in the park that day.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: For the record, you didn't.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: And you shouldn't have kissed me.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Why? No fright wig?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Well I'm keeping Jack and Red. I found 'em.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: They're not your kids, Leila.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Yeah, well. They're not anybody's kids.
dialog: As shame and regret cloud her face, she looks around the room for help which doesn't arrive.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait. That's not what I meant.
dialog: (calling after)
dialog: Red!
text: Red and Jack have already taken Menu Man by the hand and are walking away towards his "apartment". Menu Man casts a disapproving stare over his shoulder.

scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK/ALICE IN WONDERLAND STATUE -- AFTERNOON
dialog: Pouring rain at the ALICE IN WONDERLAND STATUE of Leila's youth.
text: Red and Jack sit with Leila under Alice's big toadstool. Red turns to Leila and buries herself under her arm. Jack moves closer. The wind howls.
dialog: JACK
dialog: Why are you mad at the doctor?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I'm not mad at him, Jack.
dialog: JACK
dialog: Scared?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: No!
dialog: JACK
dialog: He's the best one. He helped my sister. And he shook my hand.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: It's just that I made a promise to myself, Jack. And keeping the promises you make, even if you don't feel like it anymore, is...very, very important.
dialog: RED
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why?
text: Leila looks down at her in shock. She's never looked sadder. They fall into a deep huddle against the wind and rain. Leila takes off her scarf and wraps it around Jack and Red as best she can.
dialog: FADE OUT:
dialog: FADE IN:
dialog: EXT. CHURCH -- MORNING

dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. CHURCH / DRESSING ROOM -- MORNING
text: On the accoutrements of an imminent marriage: ribbon-wrapped boxes of shoes, gloves, pearls and the wedding dress itself, still in its dry cleaning plastic.
text: Widen to include Evy at the mirror adjusting her bustier. Leila opens boxes nearby.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Your breasts are bigger than mine. That pisses me off.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: They're Mother's.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: (looking down)
dialog: So whose are these?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Donald's.
text: Evy makes a face. Leila looks gorgeous in a clingy silk-satin knockout sheath. She takes off a gold chain and fastens it to her sister's neck.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: Something borrowed.
dialog: Leila looks around the room for...
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: Something...blue.
dialog: They smile simultaneously.
speaker_heading: LEILA/EVY
dialog: (pointing at each other)
dialog: YOU!
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Something...barfed on.
dialog: (brightly)
dialog: My dress!

speaker_heading: EVY (CONT'D)
dialog: Something old?

dialog: Uncle Ernest, resplendent in his morning coat, finds him eavesdropping.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: Oh God. Not girl talk.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: Let them be. This is a precious time for sisters.
dialog: Ignoring all that, Ernest goes up and beats on the door.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: Ten minutes.
text: As he walks away, Ernest taps on his digital watch and holds it to his ear.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST (CONT'D)
dialog: I liked time better when it ticked.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. CHURCH / DRESSING ROOM -- DAY
text: Evy continues with her preparations, though at a decidedly less enthusiastic pace. Leila is sitting on a couch.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: So how did you know that Donald was...the one?
dialog: Evy eyes her skeptically.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, I could tell he was the one who was...tall. And very handsome. But is he secretly funny and sweet?
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Well that doesn't jump right out at you.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Smart?
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Hah.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: What, then?
dialog: Evy thinks long and hard.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: We just belong together.
dialog: (reversing tone)
dialog: And I resent your implication.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Donald's going to be a huge success... and he loves me to pieces. I'm probably the luckiest girl in the world.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. CHURCH / HALLWAY -- DAY
dialog: Uncle Ernest returns in high dither, tapping his damn watch.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: Tell me this, Mammy. How did two old queers wind up with daughters?
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: God's little joke.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: Well they're a pain in the butt.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: Of course they are, dear. But one must be kind and encourage them.
text: Menu Man, stunning in a suit, emerges from yet another door with Jack, looking good in a morning coat and backwards baseball cap, and Red, in her usual tom-boy gear. He hands Red's little white dress to Ernest.
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: Your turn. We tried.
dialog: He exits a side door.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: (of the children)
dialog: What are these?
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: Grandchildren.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: Oh good.
dialog: Ernest takes the dress and leads Red down the hall.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST (CONT'D)
dialog: Mammy. If they're not out of there in two minutes, break down the door.
dialog: They disappear around a corner.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: But ALL the girls are wearing white dresses. That's the POINT.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. CHURCH / DRESSING ROOM -- DAY
dialog: Leila and Evy are both plopped on the floor passing the flask back and forth.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: I could be making a big mistake.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: This isn't about you.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: Long pause.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Leila, is this how you felt before you... almost got married?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: No. I felt beautiful. I felt perfect.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Well that fucked up.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: Evy ponders.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: No. That's good. See, you were really happy and the guy bailed, and I'm really...drunk. So this is good. This is fine.
dialog: One more pass of the flask while the sisters try to digest the logic of that.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: OMITTED
dialog: INT. CHURCH / HALLWAY -- DAY
text: Mammy retreats to the hallway as Ernest emerges from his battle with Red, carrying her dress.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST

dialog: Kirk enters the hallway from the church. Red rushes to him.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: Here. Let me.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: Be my guest.
dialog: Kirk takes the dress into Red's room.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: That's Dr. Beverly.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. CHURCH -- DAY
text: Mammy peeks out at the gathering congregation. The groom's side looks snooty and well-dressed; the bride's considerably more casual.
dialog: We spot a few familiar faces -- among them, Dottie, Darcy, and the Customer. Not a big crowd. Mammy returns.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. CHURCH / HALLWAY -- DAY
text: A moment later the door to the Bride's room opens. All eyes turn as Evy and Leila, bride and maid of honor, emerge -- having made a humongous effort towards sobriety.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: Oh my God, you look like an angel.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: Could we get on with this?
text: Ernest walks Evy into the church. Now another door opens and Red walks out, looking pretty in her white dress.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Red, you're beautiful.
dialog: She glances uncertainly at Kirk.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: So are you.
dialog: Mammy claps his hands.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: Okay. All in your places with sunshiny faces.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: (to Red)
dialog: C'mon pumpkin
text: Kirk walks Red into the chapel. Mammy lingers a moment, then follows. Leila stands alone in the doorway.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. CHURCH -- DAY
text: Leila enters the staging area behind a curtain to find Ernest looking at his watch and Mammy fussing over Evy, who nervously calls out to her big sister.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Leila?
text: Leila takes her by the hand and they walk to the corner of the curtain. Evy takes a deep breath and tries to compose herself. Then...
speaker_heading: EVY (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Evy?
dialog: Evy grabs Leila's sleeve.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: I forgot to write my vows. We're supposed to write vows.
text: Evy scoots across the back of the church, swipes a pen from the guest book, and dashes past Leila, Mammy and Ernest towards the dressing room, almost bumping into Menu Man who has returned from outside carrying the ring pillow. He gives her a killer smile.
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: Hey, little Harvard.
dialog: Evy makes a tiny, plaintive noise and quickens her pace.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Oh no. No no no no no.
text: Ernest, who will give Evy away, looks in bewilderment towards his "normal" niece, while Mammy peeks down the aisle.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: I'm amazed they still let heterosexuals marry.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Is the groom at least here, this time?
text: Mammy POV: Donald and the Best Man (previously seen as Quarterback), stand at the altar, exchange discreet little punches and try not to laugh. Both are wearing sunglasses, evidently to hide the aftermath of last night's bachelor blowout.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: Oh, he's here.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: When Evy divorces him and remarries, do you realize we'll have at least one more of these.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: Your pessimism has no place at this ceremony.
dialog: The Wedding March begins.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. CHURCH -- DAY
dialog: Menu Man, as usher, escorts Mammy, as mother of the bride, to his seat.
dialog: The wedding procession begins: Jack and Red as flower children lead Uncle Ernest and Evy down the center aisle.
text: At the altar, Ernest hands Evy off to the groom--still yukking it up with his Best Man, still sporting the shades.
text: Evy, Donald, Leila and Best Man, stand before the PREACHER --an older, dignified, no-nonsense gentleman. The MUSIC ends. For a moment or two, there is an uncomfortable silence. Finally Preacher leans in towards Donald.
dialog: PREACHER
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Would you agree that the eyes are the windows to the soul, son?
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: Uh. Absolutely, Father.
dialog: PREACHER
dialog: Perhaps your bride would like a glimpse of your soul now. I know I would.
dialog: Donald grins, and then looks concerned. He has no clue.
text: As he speaks the following to the congregation, Preacher reaches over and snags the Ray-Bans right off Donald's face.
speaker_heading: PREACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Dearly beloved. We are gathered here in the sight of God, and in the face of this company, to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony.
dialog: Pause. Then to the Best Man.
speaker_heading: PREACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: You too.
dialog: The Best Man hands over his shades. Donald gives Evy a lame smile.
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Rough night.
dialog: PREACHER
dialog: Before we recite the traditional vows, I understand the bride and groom have taken time to compose something from their hearts.
dialog: Preacher nods to Donald, who stands there, stiff as ice.
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: Why do I have to go first?
dialog: PREACHER
dialog: Just read what you've written, son.
text: Donald opens his paper and works on his dry-mouth. Various members of the congregation look up in anticipation. Donald looks at Evy.
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: I love you deeply. Like the deep...snow.
text: He folds his paper. He's done. SILENCE. Stunned reactions, first from Mammy, then Ernest, then Darcy who sports a few new piercings, green hair and a vinyl get-up. Dottie, sitting next to her, looks pleased just to be here.
dialog: PREACHER
dialog: Sometimes the heart is too full for words.
dialog: Best Man claps Donald on the shoulder. Sounded good to him.
speaker_heading: PREACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: And the bride's declaration?
text: Evy pulls a page from the guest book out of her bustier, and looks at Donald who is grinning like an idiot. After a moment.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Ah, forget it. Let's just move on.
dialog: (to Donald, incredulous)
dialog: Deep snow?
dialog: Preacher gathers himself.
dialog: PREACHER
dialog: Well, then...If any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter forever hold his peace.
dialog: All present hold their breath in holy terror. Except the PARENTS OF THE GROOM, who whip their heads around desperately.
text: Preacher looks out over his half-moon glasses. We see Kirk at the back of the church.
speaker_heading: PREACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyone?
dialog: He turns his attention back to the couple.
speaker_heading: PREACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: No.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Then I require and charge you both, as you will answer at the dreadful day of judgment when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed, that if either of you know any impediment, why you may not be lawfully joined together in matrimony, you do now confess it.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: Oh boy.
dialog: PREACHER
dialog: This part is largely rhetorical.
dialog: (gathers himself)
dialog: Wilt thou, Donald, have this woman to thy wedded wife? Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour and keep her, in sickness and in health, so long as you both shall live.
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: I do. Wilt.
dialog: Best Man chuckles: Wilt? What a riot. Preacher looks up.
dialog: PREACHER
dialog: Wilt thou, Evy, have this man to thy wedded husband? Wilt thou love him, comfort him, honour and keep him, in sickness and in health, so long as you both shall live?
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Could you go over that "dreadful day of judgment" part again?
dialog: PREACHER
dialog: Just say "I will", dear.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Mmmmm.
dialog: PREACHER
dialog: Or "I do".
dialog: Evy, alarmed looks at Leila.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Or...something else.
dialog: Gasps.
dialog: PREACHER
dialog: Excuse me?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (clearing throat)
dialog: Seems like...such a narrow range of choices.
dialog: PREACHER
dialog: (to the assemblage)
dialog: Who is this woman?
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: The sister.
dialog: Evy teeters on the precipice.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Is it too late to -- forever -- not --hold my peace?
dialog: The Preacher can't answer while he tries to unravel the grammar.
dialog: PREACHER
dialog: Um...
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I mean...to speak now?
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: Yes.
dialog: Menu Man rises.
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: No.
dialog: PREACHER
dialog: And you are...?
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: A poet.
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: I thought he was the cook?
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: Go on, Harvard.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (to Donald, in an insane rush)
dialog: I know this is really tricky timing and everything -- God, you've got your whole family here -- but I mean, look, my guy didn't even make it inside the church. At least Evy walked all the way up here to tell you.
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: (to Evy)
dialog: Tell me what?
dialog: Evy shrugs.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: That you're not, "the one", Donald. I mean, you're certainly, "a one". Probably even "the one" to a lot of women -- Evy says you really know your way around a waterbed. But you're just going to have to be somebody else's...big one...because my sister's not in love with you...
dialog: (to Evy)
dialog: You're not...
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (back to Donald)
dialog: And I think it would be better off for all concerned if you just...you know, shook hands or something.
dialog: PREACHER
dialog: Is she drunk?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: A little scotch, Reverend, sorry -- I think they call it "courage" in England. Anyway. I'm probably the last person who should say anything about love.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But I know what it looks like. I've seen its reflection.
dialog: Begin to PUSH IN on Kirk standing at the rear doors of the church.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: All it has to do is glance somewhere...and it bounces and beams and alights on things, and makes them better. Things like...the world...the floor...the faces of children.
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: (to Preacher)
dialog: When did this become her moment?
dialog: Preacher shrugs.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Your's too, Donald. The moment when you realize that you don't love Evy any more than she doesn't love you.
dialog: Find the groom's parents in the front pew.
dialog: FATHER OF GROOM
dialog: That makes it unanimous.
speaker_heading: MOTHER OF GROOM
dialog: Lewis! You're his father!
dialog: FATHER OF GROOM
dialog: What! She writes about fish. She's a fish writer.
dialog: Back up front.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Love's -- well, I don't know what love is -- but I know what it does.
dialog: (acting out her metaphors)
dialog: It's...this thing. And it gets under your skin, and...and...
speaker_heading: MENU MAN
dialog: "And what in me is dark illumines."
dialog: Preacher is impressed; Evy melts a little.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Wow, that's good. Very...medieval. But no, I was going to say "makes you psychotic". It's like having a really itchy bug bite. No, worse. A hairball!
dialog: Raised eyebrows all around.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: An unholy hairball. Which festers and rots and grows enormous. So for like...twelve years...you don't lay a finger on it, for fear that when it stops choking and itching and gagging you -- you won't feel anything at all. And then one day -- I mean the lightbulb goes on -- and you see...you KNOW...
text: Leila searches the church for Kirk who looks up with a glimmer of hope in his eyes. She can't close the deal.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: ...well, that your sister shouldn't marry the man she intended to.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's all.
dialog: A resigned and disappointed Kirk walks away towards the exit, witnessed only by Leila.
text: Dottie and Darcy look at each other, briefly consider the appropriateness of the gesture...and then start applauding and cat-calling. All on the bride's side -- and a few on the groom's -- join in.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Thank you, thank you.
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: At least we still have our dignity.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: (to Donald, sincerely)
dialog: But she's right, you know -- if you think about it -- they're all right. You understand, don't you Donald?
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: I understand. I just don't know where to go.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Don't go anywhere. We're unmarried, not dead. Maybe we can get together later.
dialog: Par-ty. He and the Best Man high five each other. Menu Man raises an eyebrow.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: (to crowd)
dialog: You'll all get your presents back, Federal Express.
dialog: PREACHER
dialog: Well then, if there are no more completely inappropriate surprises, perhaps now would be a fine time to bring these...proceedings to a merciful close.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: Wait. There's actually one more thing.
dialog: PREACHER
dialog: Of course there is.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: When I was 17, I stood outside this same church and swore to God that I would never again let anybody say they loved me. And guess what? Nobody has.
text: Leila looks out towards the back doors. The congregation begins to look with her.
dialog: The CAMERA TRACKS past Ernest and Mammy as they turn their heads, then the kids, then Dottie and Darcy...
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: Because the longer the wall stood, the higher it got...
text: The CAMERA moves past Eddie dressed as a giant Bumblebee as he turns, then, as if amazed that a giant Bumblebee is IN a church, the Camera "double-takes" past him again...
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: ...and the higher it got, the fewer people even tried to get over it.
text: Past Customer who points to himself in hopes that Leila is talking to him. Realizing she is not, he too turns to look...
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's pretty easy for us to create our own sad destinies when we're too scared to embrace the ones...
dialog: The back of the church is empty...
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: (raising her voice)
dialog: ...THAT ARE HIDING OUT THERE BEHIND THE CURTAINS.
dialog: Leila turns to the Preacher.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you think, Reverend? I promised God that no one could claim me -- not that I couldn't claim love for myself.
dialog: PREACHER
dialog: Will it involve further speech?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: (to the back of the church)
dialog: How about it, Beverly? WILL YOU LOVE ME?
dialog: Gasps from the groom's side.
dialog: PREACHER
dialog: Beverly? Not in my church.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: He's a man, Reverend, a good and kind man. But even if he were a woman, I'd love him till Death even dared...
dialog: (to back)
dialog: Will you comfort, and keep me, Beverly, in sickness and dubious mental health?
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: LEILA (CONT'D)
dialog: Beverly?
dialog: Kirk peeks around the curtain.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: (mock serious)
dialog: Are you a virgin?
dialog: LEILA
dialog: As a matter of fact...
dialog: Applause.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: EXT. CHURCHYARD -- DAY
dialog: CU: Kirk gives Leila a long, passionate kiss, while an orgy of rice falls on their heads.
text: Widen to see the smiling faces of the wedding parties, clapping and celebrating. Mammy keeps piling on the rice, as Uncle Ernest looks on, bewildered.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: What are you doing? Nobody's married.
speaker_heading: MAMMY
dialog: We may never get this close again. So kiss me darling.
speaker_heading: UNCLE ERNEST
dialog: Are you insane?
dialog: Jack emerges from the pack and grabs the bag of rice from Mammy's hands.
dialog: JACK
dialog: I don't like rice. Rice kills birds.
dialog: Everybody cracks up.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: INT. MUFFIN SHOP -- NIGHT
dialog: While Bob Marley sings his heart out, we watch a party in full bloom. The muffin shop has never been more alive.
dialog: BARTENDER and DRUNK GUY pour drinks for everybody.
text: JACK takes a nip off the gin and tonic he is delivering to UNCLE ERNEST, and is promptly busted by PREACHER who takes away the drink.
dialog: CUSTOMER smokes at his usual stool.
dialog: MENU MAN and DONALD arm-wrestle to the death, to the apparent delight of EVY, who looks on.
dialog: DARCY is all over EDDIE, now mostly out of his Bumblebee costume.
dialog: MAMMY is everywhere at once, cleaning up.
dialog: DOTTIE is painting RED's nails some scary color, as...
dialog: LEILA and KIRK survey their domain.
dialog: DR. KIRK
dialog: I've got something for you.
dialog: Kirk smiles and produces a beautiful silver star on a chain.
speaker_heading: DR. KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: It's Birth.
dialog: LEILA
dialog: I've got something for you, too.
dialog: Leila gently takes his hand and leads him towards the door.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: Hey, where are you guys going?
dialog: Darcy has come up for air just long enough to say...
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Boy, you're dumb.
speaker_heading: DOTTIE
dialog: Pardon me for not taking "Love" at Ha-a-arvard.
text: As Marley wails, the CAMERA pulls back and out of the muffin shop, and into the nighttime New York sky.
dialog: FADE OUT:
dialog:
