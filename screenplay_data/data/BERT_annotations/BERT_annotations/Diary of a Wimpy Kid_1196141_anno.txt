dialog: Greg.
text: GREG'S POV: we find RODRICK HEFFLEY, an insolent sixteen-

speaker_heading: RODRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Greg!

speaker_heading: RODRICK
dialog: Get up, you’re going to be late.

dialog: bed.
speaker_heading: GREG

dialog: Quit it, Rodrick! Why are you -- what

speaker_heading: RODRICK
dialog: Middle school, what do you think?

text: Rodrick exits. Greg sighs.
scene_heading: INT. HEFFLEY KITCHEN
text: Greg, now dressed and ready for school, eats cereal and reads
text: the comics with bleary eyes. He turns the kitchen TV on to
text: AN INFOMERCIAL FOR A JUICER. He changes the channel, it’s an
text: INFOMERCIAL FOR BUYING FORECLOSURES. He keeps changing
dialog: channels -- it’s all infomercials. Something’s not right.

speaker_heading: FRANK (0.S.)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Greg looks up. FRANK HEFFLEY, Greg’s dad, is there, wearing
text: a t-shirt and boxers. He mutes the TV.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Getting ready for my first day of

text: Greg trails off as he looks out a window. IT’S DARK.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: OPENING CREDITS
text: Tight On a closed book. The cover reads ‘Diary’. Pull back
text: to reveal GREG HEFFLEY is holding the book and directly
text: addressing the camera. Behind him is a WHITE BACKGROUND.
text: Greg is a grown-up trapped in a kid’s body. He has a very
dialog: matter of fact, casual manner about him -- a worldly,
text: confident attitude. Even so, he remains a likeable boy
dialog: because we know his bravura just masks normal insecurity.
dialog: He’s Bill Murray as a kid.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Okay, first of all, let me get
dialog: something straight: this is a
text: JOURNAL, not a diary.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Right, I know what it says on the
dialog: cover, but when mom went out to buy
dialog: this thing I TOLD her not to get me a
dialog: book that said “diary” on it. This
dialog: just proves Mom doesn’t know anything.
dialog: If I walk into my first day of middle
dialog: school carrying this book around, I
dialog: might as well be wearing a sign that
dialog: says “punch me”!
text: INSERT SHOT: The cartoon drawing FROM THE BOOK of THE BULLY

text: BACK ON GREG addressing the camera. 9
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: The only reason I agreed to write in
dialog: this thing is because one day when I’m
dialog: rich and famous I’1l have better
dialog: things to do than answer peoples’
dialog: stupid questions all day long, and
dialog: this book is gonna come in handy.
text: INSERT SHOT: The cartoon drawing FROM THE BOOK of Greg at the 10

speaker_heading: MALE REPORTER
dialog: Gregory! Tell us about your

speaker_heading: FEMALE REPORTER
dialog: Were you always so smart and handsome?
text: Greg waves his journal at them.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Here's my journal. Now shoo, shoo.
text: BACK TO GREG addressing the camera. 11
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I actually should have started keeping
dialog: a diary -- I mean journal! -- years
dialog: ago. Now there’s gonna be this big
dialog: gap from birth to middle school.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Anyway, I think future generations
dialog: will be glad I kept a record of this
dialog: time in my life, but the truth is when
dialog: they make a movie or a TV mini-series
dialog: about me, they’1ll probably just skip
dialog: over the middle school years and go
dialog: right to the part where I’m famous.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Seriously, who’s gonna want to see a
text: movie about a guy who’s stuck in
text: middle school with a bunch of half-
dialog: grown morons?
text: He tosses the book on a nearby side table. ZOOM IN TIGHT ON
text: THE BOOK AND HOLD.

dialog: window for daylight to make sure it’s legit this time. It
dialog: is.
scene_heading: INT. HEFFLEY KITCHEN - MORNING 13
text: Greg, Rodrick, Manny, and Susan eat breakfast. Rodrick is
text: working on a pile of flyers for his band Loded Diaper. The
text: flyers feature a picture of Rodrick and his bandmates
text: holding instruments and trying their hardest not to look
text: like suburban teenagers. Rodrick is adding devil horns to
text: the “L” in Loded and chuckling.
speaker_heading: GREG (V.O.)
dialog: Mom's always saying I need to gain
dialog: weight. But if you had to eat with my
dialog: family, you wouldn’t have much of an
dialog: appetite either.
text: Pan around the table -- Susan picks her teeth, Rodrick chews
text: his nails. Settle on Manny, who eats his cereal while
text: sitting on a small training potty. Frank passes through on
text: his way out to work, looks at Manny.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: The toilet at the table, that doesn’t

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I don’t want him to think it’s

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Rodrick, give Greg some tips about
dialog: middle school so he knows what to
dialog: expect.
speaker_heading: RODRICK
dialog: (to Greg)
dialog: It’s like prison. Don’t ever look
dialog: anyone in the eye, but don’t look down
dialog: either -- always be looking away, like
dialog: you're lost in thought.
text: He looks at Greg skeptically.
speaker_heading: RODRICK
dialog: I’m wasting my time, you'll be dead or
text: home-schooled by the end of the year.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Not helpful, Rodrick.
speaker_heading: RODRICK
dialog: You're right. I’m sure he’1ll do
dialog: great. He’1ll probably be Most Popular

speaker_heading: RODRICK

scene_heading: END FLASHBACK.
scene_heading: INT. HEFFLEY KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 15

scene_heading: INT. SUSAN’S CAR - MORNING 16
dialog: SUPER: “First Day of School.”
text: Susan stops in front of Whitmore Middle School in her older

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: No.
text: Greg hops out. Susan watches him head toward the school.
scene_heading: EXT. WHITMORE MIDDLE SCHOOL - MORNING 17
text: It’s quiet as Greg nears the large metal front door. The
text: school looks idyllic and nonthreatening. Next to the door is
text: a cartoon poster of a character named “Wacky Dawg” welcoming
dialog: new students.
speaker_heading: GREG (V.O.)
dialog: Everybody's always saying how middle
dialog: school is such a big deal. But to be
dialog: honest with you, I wasn’t really
dialog: sweating it all that much.
text: He opens the door and is BLASTED BY A WALL OF NOISE.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 18
text: Greg stands in the hallway. All around him is mayhem; it’s
text: loud and packed with kids roughhousing and jostling and
text: shrieking. Greg begins to walk down the hall.
speaker_heading: GREG (V.O.)
dialog: Okay, so I admit middle school was way
dialog: different than what I was expecting.
dialog: I mean, you got kids like me who
dialog: haven't hit their growth spurt yet
dialog: mixed in with these gorillas who need
dialog: to shave twice a day.
text: GREG'S POV: EXTREME CLOSE-UPS of one big kid’s BUSHY UPPER

scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: 19 A SERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHS 19
text: Side by side, we see before and after photos of several of
text: Greg’s schoolmates. The “befores” are normal, cute grade
text: school students. The “afters” look like bizarre hormone
text: experiments. The first photo is of Preston, in which his
text: clear grade school complexion becomes riddled with acne. In
text: the ones that follow, full shiny hair becomes lank and
text: greasy; others are stuck in weird, awkward phases of their
text: growth spurts. In the last “before and after”, A SMALL,
text: NORMAL-LOOKING KID HASN’T CHANGED AT ALL.
speaker_heading: GREG (V.O.)
dialog: Okay, so there were still a few normal
dialog: looking people like me, but trust me,

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (calls)
dialog: Hey, Rowley.
speaker_heading: GREG (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Rowley Jefferson is my best friend.
text: The two other kids part and we get our first good look at
text: Rowley. The word for Rowley is “thick”. His head, neck,
text: torso, and legs sit atop one another like a stack of blocks.
text: He has a heartbreakingly open, honest, sweet face. HE IS
text: ALSO WEARING A BRIGHTLY COLORED SERAPE. Greg cringes when
text: sees Rowley’s nerdy outerwear.
speaker_heading: GREG (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: But that’s definitely subject to
dialog: change.
text: Rowley sees Greg and becomes excited, waving frantically.
speaker_heading: ROWLEY
dialog: (way too loud)

speaker_heading: MUSCLED KID
dialog: (raises his hand)
dialog: What happens to us if we hit somebody
dialog: in the head?
speaker_heading: COACH MALONE
dialog: Nothing. Okay now, listen up, when I
dialog: blow the whistle that means...
text: Coach Malone continues to talk as...
speaker_heading: GREG (V.O.)
dialog: Don’t ask me what genius came up with
dialog: the idea of dodgeball. My parents
dialog: spent a lot of money on my braces so
dialog: I’m pretty sure they didn’t want me to
dialog: get my teeth rearranged by some moron

speaker_heading: ROWLEY
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: COACH MALONE
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Go sit next to the other guy.
text: Rowley runs off and catches up to Greg. As they walk...
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: The people running this place are
dialog: trying to kill us. Maybe this is how
dialog: they’re gonna fix overcrowding in
dialog: schools.
speaker_heading: ROWLEY
dialog: I gotta get my hands on an inhaler.
dialog: (points to dodgeball)
dialog: ‘Cause that’s scary.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I’m not scared, I’m walking away to

speaker_heading: ANGIE (0.S.)
dialog: Like the Roman gladiators.

text: sees the parallel.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I’m Angie. This is my second year,
dialog: and I’m telling you, middle school is
text: nothing but a bad joke.
text: Through the following, Greg gets increasingly annoyed by
text: Rowley’s attention to Angie.
speaker_heading: ANGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: And the crazy thing is, all the adults
dialog: know it, but they keep it to
dialog: themselves. I mean, you hear them
dialog: talk all the time about how fun high
dialog: school was and how cute they were in
dialog: elementary school. But you never,
dialog: ever hear them saying they wish they
dialog: could be back in middle school. They
dialog: never mention it at all.
speaker_heading: ROWLEY
dialog: (locked in)
dialog: That’s true.
text: Greg pulls Rowley away...
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (to Angie)
dialog: I think the girls are supposed to be
dialog: over there.
text: As they move off...
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: Rowley, you gotta stay away from the
dialog: nutsos. We’re projecting an image
dialog: here, it’s a very delicate time.
text: They continue toward an empty spot on the blacktop, looking
text: over their shoulders at the dodgeball game. They watch
text: CHIRAG GUPTA, a little Indian boy, get nailed by four balls
text: at once. Greg turns away just in time to see AN OLD GROSS
text: SLICE OF CHEESE right in front of them.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CHIRAG (0.S.)
dialog: Stop!
text: Alarmed, Greg and Rowley turn to see Chirag run up, battle-
text: wounded and out of breath.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: What, Chirag?
speaker_heading: CHIRAG
dialog: You almost got the Cheese Touch.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: The what?
text: Chirag takes a deep breath, and then begins speaking almost
dialog: mystically...
speaker_heading: CHIRAG
dialog: A long time ago -- no one knows how
dialog: long -- that cheese just appeared on
dialog: the blacktop. No one ever threw it
text: away, and so there it sat, growing
dialog: more foul by the day. Then one day, a
dialog: kid -- some say his name was Bernard --
dialog: made the biggest mistake of his life.
scene_heading: FLASHBACK TO:
scene_heading: 25 EXT. SPORT COURT - DAY 25

dialog: No one would go near Bernard because
dialog: if they touched him, they would get
dialog: the Cheese Touch. Bernard became an
dialog: outcast. Until, that is, he was able
dialog: to pass the Cheese Touch onto an
text: unsuspecting foreign exchange student.
scene_heading: FLASHBACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY 27
text: DIETER, a happy looking German foreign exchange student,

dialog: Was soll das?

speaker_heading: KID #2
dialog: Cheese touch!
speaker_heading: CHIRAG (V.O.)
dialog: And so it went, from student to
dialog: student, from year to year.

scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT 188
text: The gym is dark, lit only by a disco ball. It’s about half
text: full of parents and kids. There is a DJ spinning records but
text: nobody dances. In fact, everybody seems pretty uncomfortable
text: and awkward. Greg and Susan enter. Greg looks grim, dressed
text: in a suit jacket and slacks. Susan is dressed up, seems
text: excited. Greg looks around and sees lots of kids from his
text: class. He passes Archie Kelly who is being hassled by
text: Quentin and his friend ARTHUR.
speaker_heading: QUENTIN
dialog: Hey, Bubby.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Where’s your bubby now, Bubby?
text: They laugh. Greg nervously puts some distance between him
dialog: and Archie.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Look at this place! Wow, it’s like a
dialog: real disco. Want to dance?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (aghast)
dialog: God no.
text: Just then, Rowley and Collin enter with THEIR MOMS. They
text: look like they’re having a great time. Susan watches Greg
text: who watches Rowley.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Okay, enough already. Just go talk to
dialog: him, fix it.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: He’s your best friend. And sometimes,

speaker_heading: GREG

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Stop, I’m blushing.
text: But she’s really pleased Greg is taking her advice. Greg

text: takes a deep breath and crosses to him.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Hey, Rowley.
speaker_heading: ROWLEY
dialog: Hey.
text: A beat of silence. In the background, Susan cranes her head
dialog: to get a better look.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: So...you want to go get some ice cream
dialog: after?
text: Collin steps between them.
speaker_heading: COLLIN
dialog: We already have plans.
speaker_heading: ROWLEY
dialog: (regretful)
dialog: ...yeah, we do.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Fine. My mom wanted me to ask, so I

speaker_heading: GREG (V.O.)
dialog: I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
dialog: This is just the kind of thing I could

speaker_heading: ROWLEY

speaker_heading: ROWLEY

speaker_heading: GREG

speaker_heading: ROWLEY

dialog: Hear that? Click click click click!

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You have no idea what we’re going to

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Now eat it.

text: CLOSE ON GREG: Greg winces, closing his eyes to block out

speaker_heading: GREG (V.O.)
dialog: I don’t even want to say exactly what

speaker_heading: COACH MALONE (CONT’D)
dialog: Pete Hosey is that you?

speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Oh. My. God.
