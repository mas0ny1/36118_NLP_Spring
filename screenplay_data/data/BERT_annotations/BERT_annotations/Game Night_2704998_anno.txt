scene_heading: INT. PUB - NIGHT
text: MUSIC BLARES. We move past people drinking, playing POOL,
text: DARTS, BEER PONG and land on...
text: MAX (30's) sitting with a team in matching T-shirts. (His
text: says, “CAPTAIN.”) It’s a rowdy PUB TRIVIA NIGHT. Max pounds
text: a drink and yells at his team:
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (slightly slurred)
dialog: Who cares about winning?! Let’s
dialog: get drunk!
text: His team CHEERS. Max walks over to the BARTENDER, dead sober:
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: I need four shots of Everclear and
text: four shots of water.
dialog: (throwing down some bills)
dialog: Send the real ones to the other
dialog: team. Give us the water.
text: The Bartender snorts and starts pouring.
speaker_heading: TRIVIA EMCEE (0.S.)
dialog: What former Supreme Court Justice--
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (spinning around)
dialog: Oliver Wendell Holmes!
dialog: Max’s team CHEERS.
speaker_heading: TRIVIA EMCEE
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: That is correct. Again, I’d like
dialog: to ask the players to allow me to--
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: --finish the question!
text: His team laughs and cheers again.
text: Across the room, also wearing a “CAPTAIN” shirt, ANNIE (30's)
text: glares at her TEAMMATES, including BILL, a schlubby guy.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Come on, guys. Focus. This isn’t
dialog: a game!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: It literally is.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Bill, I swear to god--
speaker_heading: TRIVIA EMCEE
dialog: For triple points: what is the name
dialog: of the purple Teletubby?
text: The room quiets... There’s an intense beat then--
speaker_heading: MAX ANNIE
dialog: Tinky Winky! Tinky Winky!
text: Max and Annie lock eyes, sparks flying.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (intense)
dialog: He always carried a--
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (unblinking)
dialog: --red purse. I know.
dialog: There is a definite connection here.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT
text: Max and Annie stand in the middle of a subway car, furiously
text: making out. The car suddenly comes to a stop and the couple
text: goes FLYING INTO A METAL POLE.
text: In a MONTAGE, Max and Annie WIN different GAME NIGHTS as
dialog: their relationship progresses:
text: --A SMALL STUDIO APARTMENT, playing the board game RISK with
text: another COUPLE, DAN and LINDA.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: If you take Kamchatka and I take
dialog: Mongolia, we can trap Linda in the
dialog: middle.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Starve out her army. Smart.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Hey! You can’t form alliances.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Worked for Hitler.
text: They high-five.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You're high-fiving Hitler?!
text: --In A NICER APARTMENT, playing PICTIONARY. Max haphazardly
text: DRAWS a RECTANGLE.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: “The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel”!
text: Other players protest. Max and Annie kiss.
text: --IN THEIR MODEST SUBURBAN HOUSE, playing CHARADES with Bill.
text: Max points to Bill and Annie guesses--
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Bill. Overweight. Single. Out of
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What the fuck?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Hairy?
dialog: (Max touches his nose)
text: Hairy. Carry. Mary.
dialog: (Max touches his nose)
dialog: Mary!
dialog: (Max points to himself)
dialog: You! Me!
text: Max gestures to put it together.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Marry me!
text: Annie does a crazy/cute victory dance but then:
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait-- What?
text: She turns back and sees Max on one knee, holding a ring.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Marry me, Annie.
text: Annie jumps into Max’s arms, laughing and kissing him. Bill
text: is still stinging from their insults.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (half-hearted)
dialog: Congrats. Happy for you guys.
text: --AT THEIR WEDDING RECEPTION, Max and Annie play a DANCING
text: VIDEO GAME in their tux and wedding dress. Dancing in
text: unison, as their score mounts. The SONG crescendos to...
text: TITLE UP: “GAME NIGHT”
scene_heading: INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY
text: CLOSE ON a paper football about to be flicked at a finger-
text: goalpost.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (0.S.)
dialog: Lotta pressure here. You miss, you
dialog: lose.
speaker_heading: MAX (0.S.)
dialog: Stay outta my head, please.
text: Max and Annie sit in a doctor’s waiting room playing paper
text: football. Her hands are the goal. He’s about to “kick.”
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Y’know, you do have the advantage
dialog: because your fingers are smaller
dialog: than mine which means you have a
text: smaller goalpost.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Guess you should’ve married Uma
dialog: Thurman.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Guess I should’ve.
text: Max aims, but just as he’s about to flick the paper football
text: his PHONE PINGS an incoming text. The “football” flies
text: wildly far from the goal.
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Awww. I’m sorry, honey. I know
dialog: how much this meant to you.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That was interference.
text: He reads the text. It’s from BROOKS: “PSYCHED FOR TONIGHT!”
text: The words are followed by the GIF of THE OBESE BOY DANCING
text: CRAZILY ON A SOFA.
text: Max sighs, annoyed.
text: A NURSE enters.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Doctor Chin is ready for you.
scene_heading: INT. DR. CHIN’S OFFICE - DAY
text: Max and Annie sit across a desk from DR. JOHANNA CHIN, 40's.
speaker_heading: DR. CHIN
dialog: .-.I think we've determined why
dialog: you've been having trouble
text: conceiving.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, yeah?
text: Chin turns and looks at Max.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What? It’s me? Of course it’s me.
speaker_heading: DR. CHIN
dialog: (opening a file)
dialog: I’m not loving your semen.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: DR. CHIN
dialog: Your count is excellent. But your
dialog: motility is well below normal.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What would cause that?
speaker_heading: DR. CHIN
dialog: It can be genetic. Environmental
dialog: factors. Nine times out of ten
dialog: it’s just stress.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I’m not stressed.
speaker_heading: DR. CHIN
dialog: Nothing at home or work?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No. It’s all good.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What about your brother?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What about him?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (to Dr. Chin)
dialog: His brother, Brooks, emailed a
dialog: couple months ago that he’s coming
dialog: into town this week. Max has
dialog: always had an inferiority complex
dialog: with him.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That’s not true. And she doesn’t
dialog: need to hear this. She’s not a
dialog: therapist.
speaker_heading: DR. CHIN
dialog: No, but I am a doctor and I believe
dialog: in treating the whole patient.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: He’s been on edge lately.
speaker_heading: DR. CHIN
dialog: What is it about your brother that
dialog: intimidates you, Max?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Really? We’re gonna do this right
dialog: next to the room where I
dialog: masturbated?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: Max has it in his head that Brooks
dialog: is more successful and better
dialog: looking and just generally cooler
dialog: than he is.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I never said “cooler.” Now you're
dialog: projecting.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (to Dr. Chin)
dialog: He’s just naturally charismatic.
speaker_heading: DR. CHIN
dialog: (jots down some notes)
dialog: Very interesting. And is he
dialog: single?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah. Why?
speaker_heading: DR. CHIN
dialog: I don’t know if I mentioned it, but
dialog: Keith and I are on a trial
dialog: separation.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: DR. CHIN
dialog: Don’t be. Keith was emotionally
dialog: abusive.
dialog: (then, to Max)
dialog: You think your brother would want
dialog: to grab a cup of coffee with me?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I-- I don’t know.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: We can ask him.
speaker_heading: DR. CHIN
dialog: Now, is he a tall fella? Because
dialog: I’m only 5'2”.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: So we’re done with my sperm, then?
text: Annie and Dr. Chin ignore him.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: He’s definitely taller than Max.
dialog: But he once dated this ballerina
dialog: and she was a tiny little thing--
dialog: y'know, I’m starting to love this
dialog: idea.
speaker_heading: DR. CHIN
dialog: Me too. Is he Google-able?
text: Max throws up his hands as they continue to talk about how
dialog: great Brooks is.
scene_heading: EXT. MAX’S & ANNIE’S HOUSE - EVENING
text: Max and Annie pull into the driveway of a SUBURBAN HOME. Max
text: grabs some groceries from the trunk and they head toward the
text: door. They spot their stiff neighbor, GARY (40, think
text: Michael Shannon, wearing a police uniform) standing at his
text: mailbox. On a leash is a small, white puffball of a DOG.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (sotto, to Annie)
dialog: Shit. It’s Gary. Don’t mention
dialog: game night.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Good evening, Max. Annie.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Hey, Gary. How’s it going?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Well enough. Just checking the
dialog: mail. Some people check it earlier
dialog: in the day but there’s always a
dialog: risk that the mail carrier hasn’t
dialog: come yet. This spares me the
dialog: chance of a futile trip to the
text: mailbox.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Plus, it allows Bastian here the
dialog: opportunity to urinate.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Well, have a good one.
speaker_heading: GARY
text: (pointedly, glancing at
dialog: groceries)
dialog: Any plans for this evening?
dialog: Perhaps a game night?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (uneasy)
dialog: Oh, no. Annie and I are staying
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I see. I do hope you’1ll keep me in
dialog: mind for any future game nights. I
dialog: always enjoyed the camaraderie of
dialog: good friends competing in games of
dialog: chance and skill.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah... we should do that again.
dialog: But tonight it’s just the two of
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Three bags of Tostitos “Scoops” I
dialog: notice.
dialog: They had a special. Three for one.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Three for one? How can that be
dialog: profitable for Frito-Lay?
dialog: 
text: They shrug.
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, you two enjoy each other.
dialog: Often we don’t fully appreciate
dialog: what we have until it’s gone.
text: Awkward beat.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Okay.
text: They can’t think of anything else to say so they head inside.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MAX AND ANNIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Max and Annie enter. He peeks outside from behind a curtain.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Now if he sees the others we're
dialog: screwed.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Well, I told everyone to park far
text: away and sneak in quietly.
dialog: (then, changing course)
dialog: Are we being dicks? Should we just
dialog: keep inviting him? It seems like
dialog: he really wants to play.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No! Debbie was our friend. Gary
dialog: was just the creepy husband we had
dialog: to put up with. And he’s only
dialog: gotten worse since the divorce.
text: He’s like the butler at a haunted
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah, you’re right. We don’t
dialog: actually owe him anything. He can
dialog: always find people like himself to
dialog: play with. Y'know, other weirdos.
text: Just then, a kitchen window opens and a VERY HOT 20-SOMETHING
text: GIRL, MADISON, crawls in. Max and Annie regard her.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Can we help you?
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: (vocal fry)
dialog: I’m okay.
text: RYAN, 30’s, hoists himself in after her.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Why are you coming in the window?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: You said to sneak in so Robocop
dialog: wouldn’t see us.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I meant sneak in the door but,
dialog: okay... could you get your boot off
dialog: our cutting board?
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Well, you were super vague about
dialog: how we should sneak in--
text: Just then, another window slides open and KEVIN, 30's
text: African-American, starts climbing inside.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Jesus. It’s like “Night of the
dialog: Living Dead” in here.
text: Kevin helps his wife, MICHELLE, 30's, African-American,
dialog: climb in.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: I am not dressed for this nonsense.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Yeah, you’re asking a lot of us,
dialog: Max.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I didn’t tell anyone to come in the
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Guys, this is Madison. Madison,
text: this is Max and Annie. Kevin and
dialog: Michelle.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah, you brought her last week.
dialog: (to Madison)
dialog: You work at Forever 21, right?
text: Ryan gives Annie a “what the fuck” look.
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: (vocal fry)
dialog: I work at Sephora.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I’m confused.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (sotto to Annie)
dialog: Different girl. Same look, same
dialog: voice.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh. Hi. Nice to meet you.
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: You too.
dialog: 11.
text: Madison holds out an awkward limp hand, like a dead tish.
text: Max and Annie try to figure out what to do with it. Annie
text: shakes it awkwardly. Max kisses it.
speaker_heading: MADISON (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you guys have a bathroom?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yes we do. Right down the hall.
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: On the right or the left. I don’t
dialog: want to go in the wrong room.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It’ll be the one with the toilet.
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: ‘Kay.
text: Madison exits.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Where’d you meet her? At a TED
dialog: talk?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Don’t judge me. Brains and
dialog: personality aren’t everything.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Aren't you sick of losing game
dialog: night every week ‘cause of the
dialog: dates you bring?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: They’re not always bad.
scene_heading: FLASHBACK TO:
text: --Ryan plays charades. He frantically mimes a clue for his
dialog: partner, HOT DATE #1. We REVEAL she isn’t paying any
text: attention to him. Instead she’s on SNAPCHAT, taking a
text: selfie with the “licking dog” filter. On it she’s written
dialog: “Game night. Bored AF.”
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, Heather! How many
dialog: pictures of you as a dog do you
dialog: need?
text: The others look embarrassed.
text: --Ryan’s HOT DATE #2 puts down a word in Scrabble and claps
dialog: happily.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: “Dennis” isn’t a word.
speaker_heading: HOT DATE
dialog: Uh, yeah, it is. It’s my daddy’s
dialog: name, SO...
text: The group roll their eyes.
text: --Ryan and a HOT DATE #3 play Taboo. His card reads “Seal
dialog: Team Six.”
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Okay, these are, like, the very
dialog: best, the elite--
scene_heading: HOT BLONDE DATE
dialog: White people?
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Whoaaaa!
text: BACK TO SCENE.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Unlike you psychos, I don’t really
dialog: give a shit about winning at game
dialog: night. I don’t need that
dialog: validation.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: But you do need the validation of
dialog: dating hot women.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (matter of fact)
dialog: Oh yeah.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I’m sorry I’m not like you,
dialog: Michelle. We didn’t all meet our
dialog: soulmates when we were ten years
dialog: old.
text: Kevin smiles and puts an arm around Michelle.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Fourteen.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: We didn’t get married till we were
dialog: nineteen.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: And this was back in Iran? Or
dialog: Westeros?
text: They kiss.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Y’know what, Ryan? I hope someday
dialog: you find a girl who you love as
dialog: much as I love my sweet baby here.
text: Ryan grimaces.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (heading to living room)
dialog: Everybody have a drink? What
dialog: should we play first?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Y'know what rich people are doing
dialog: on their game nights these days?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Fight clubs. I just read about
dialog: them. They pay poor people to
text: fight each other and they bet on
dialog: the winner.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: That’s not a real thing.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yuh-huh. When you can have
dialog: anything you want in the world, you
dialog: have to raise the stakes or life
dialog: gets boring. The Kennedys used to
dialog: have fight clubs at their Hyannis
dialog: Port compound.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: You need to stop reading Buzzfeed
dialog: every damn second of the day ‘cause
dialog: that’s just pure silliness.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: So... charades then?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Don’t you want to wait for Brooks?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Hold up. Brooks is in town?
text: Madison returns.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: I thought he was working in Europe.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: He was. Apparently, he’s back here
dialog: for business. I haven’t seen him
dialog: yet.
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: Who are we talking about?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Max's brother. He’s this super-
dialog: successful venture capitalist.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: He was the first to invest in
dialog: Panera Bread. Turned it into
dialog: America’s leading fast casual
dialog: dining chain.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: He’s the Mark Wahlberg to Max’s
dialog: Donnie.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Y’know what? I’m gonna take that
dialog: as a compliment because Donnie was
dialog: fucking great in “The Sixth Sense.”
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Was he in that?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah, he was. And you know who
dialog: wasn’t? Mark Wahlberg.
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: Mark would never take a role that
dialog: small.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Oh, he wouldn’t, Madison? Thank
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: We haven't seen Brooks since your
dialog: wedding. Remember that speech he
dialog: gave?
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: I’ve never seen you cry that much.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: We were all crying. What was that
dialog: lovely poem he read?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: “Ancient Snapshots” by Joyce Carol
dialog: Oates.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: That’s right. And then he paid for
dialog: that whole fireworks display.
text: There’s a beat as the friends fondly remember how awesome
text: Brooks is. Finally,
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: So, you guys wanna play or...?
dialog: SFX: HONK! HONK!
text: From outside the house, a loud CAR HORN is accompanied by the
text: blaring sound of BILLY JOEL’S “CAPTAIN JACK” on the radio.
text: Annie and Max hurry to the window.
text: Parked in front of their house, we see a shiny bright red
text: 1976 Corvette Stingray with BROOKS at the wheel. He spots
text: them and gives a friendly wave.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You didn’t tell him to park up the
dialog: street?!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I did! Like three times!
dialog: (then, to himself)
dialog: He got a Stingray?
scene_heading: EXT. MAX & ANNIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Max sneaks out the front door and tries to signal--
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (whisper-yelling)
dialog: Turn off your car!
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: What’s that?
text: But it’s too late. Gary steps out his front door. Max waves
text: at Gary awkwardly, caught.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Hey again.
dialog: (under his breath)
text: Still wearing the uniform...
text: Brooks takes a 12-pack from his car and crosses the street.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: (too loud)
dialog: Hey, bud. Sorry I’m late. I hope
dialog: you didn’t start game night without
dialog: me.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (nodding toward Gary)
dialog: Shh! Didn’t you get my texts?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: What texts?
dialog: (then, to Gary)
dialog: Evening, officer.
dialog: (then, softly)
dialog: What’s up with that guy?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (to Gary)
dialog: Gary, this is my brother. We’re
dialog: just doing, like, a little three-
dialog: man, family game night thing.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Three-man? What about Kevin,
dialog: Michelle and Ryan? I thought they
dialog: were coming.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No, no, no.
dialog: (to Gary)
dialog: Just us, Gary.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: I can see them in your doorway.
dialog: There’s a whole mess of people.
text: REVERSE to see Kevin, Michelle, Annie, Ryan and Madison all
text: huddled in the doorway, hiding from Gary.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Huh? Oh, yeah.
dialog: (to Gary)
dialog: They’re not staying, Gary. It was
dialog: a mix-up with the...
text: Looking hurt, Gary goes back in his house and shuts the door.
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: God damn it, Brooks.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: We didn’t want him to know we were
dialog: doing game night. He used to come
dialog: but we don’t like him anymore.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Well, now he knows. Bring it in.
dialog: I haven’t seen you in a year.
dialog: 17.
text: Brooks grabs him in a bear hug.
speaker_heading: BROOKS (CONT'D)
dialog: You smell good. What is that,
dialog: Selsun Blue? Head and Shoulders?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Why do you assume it’s dandruff
dialog: shampoo?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: You've always been a bit of a
dialog: snowstorm. Now where’s that wife
dialog: of yours?
text: He heads inside.
scene_heading: INT. MAX & ANNIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Everyone ad libs greetings as they exchange hugs with Brooks.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Sweet ride, Brooks.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Oh yeah. I just got her a couple
dialog: weeks ago.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Is that a Corvette?
speaker_heading: MAX
text: 1976 rally red Stingray Coupe. It
dialog: was my dream car when I was a kid.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: (innocently)
dialog: Yeah, that’s what gave me the idea
dialog: to get it.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I love your house.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Are you being sarcastic?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: No. I mean it. It reminds me of
dialog: Mom and Dad's place. Takes me back
dialog: to simpler times.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Simpler?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (chill out)
dialog: Max.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (then, to Brooks)
dialog: So, how long are you in town for?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Not sure. Depends on how many
dialog: clients my firm wants me to
dialog: schmooze. But I’m hoping it’s for
dialog: a while. I never get to see you
dialog: guys.
text: Brooks throws his arm around Max.
speaker_heading: BROOKS (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ve missed you, man.
text: Max looks at his brother and can’t help it, he smiles--
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Missed you too.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - MAX & ANNIE’S HOUSE - LATER
text: They’re about to play CELEBRITY.
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: Say it one more time.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (a little impatient)
dialog: Okay. You take a piece of paper
dialog: from the bowl and then you give
text: clues to the group and they try and
dialog: guess who your celebrity is.
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: Okay, got it.
speaker_heading: MAX
text: Twenty seconds. Starting... now.
text: He starts a timer on his phone. Madison pulls out a name.
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: I don’t know who this is.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That’s okay. Pick another one.
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: (she does)
dialog: I don’t know who this is.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Try another one. Quick.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: (she does)
dialog: Oh. Okay, this is the guy who--
dialog: no, wait. I don’t know who this
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Maybe someone else should start.
text: The others quickly agree. Brooks gets up.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: I’ll go.
text: Max rubs his palms on his pants. It’s on. Annie offers a
text: bottle of wine to Max.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Do you want more--
speaker_heading: MAX
speaker_heading: SHH!
text: Ryan starts the timer.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: And... go!
text: Brooks pulls out a clue.
speaker_heading: BROOKS

dialog: Marilyn Manson.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: You got it.
dialog: (then, chuckling)
dialog: Quick story.
text: Brooks pauses the timer.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Hey, you can’t pause--
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Remember that urban myth that
dialog: Marilyn Manson had some of his ribs
dialog: removed so he could go down on
dialog: himself?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Can I tell ‘em, Max?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No! You’re in the middle of a--
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Come on. You were 14. It’s an
dialog: adorable story.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I forbid it.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Now you’ve gotta tell us.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Thanks, honey.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Did you blow yourself?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: You know those bungee cords you use
text: on roof racks? Max wrapped one
text: behind his neck and under his legs
text: to try and squish his face down to
text: his crotch.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Oh my god.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: But he gets stuck like that. He
text: can’t unhook it. Finally, after
dialog: about an hour our mom comes home
text: and finds him there. This naked
text: pretzel boy on the floor of his
dialog: bedroom. He’s had back problems
dialog: ever since.
text: The group is equal parts shocked and cracking up. Max is
text: beet red.
text: Annie rubs his back, consoling.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Aww, my little pretzel boy.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: So what?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Did you suck it?
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: We're not talking about this
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Come on! That’s like turning off
dialog: “Kramer vs. Kramer” before you see
dialog: who gets the kid.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: It’s really not.
text: A deeply embarrassed Max grabs the timer and starts it again.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Enough! The timer’s going.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Fine.
text: Brooks launches into A RAPID-FIRE SERIES OF CLUES that are so
text: spot-on, they are immediately guessed. He’s amazing.
speaker_heading: BROOKS (CONT'D)
dialog: Poor man’s Johnny Depp stars in
dialog: “Jericho.”
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Skeet Ulrich.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: UN Secretary General from ‘92 to

speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Doesn’t like kids in “Jurassic

speaker_heading: KEVIN

speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Dubstep DJ looks like Corey

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Skrillex.
text: ANGLE ON Madison. Like Ryan’s earlier date, she’s on
text: SNAPCHAT, taking a selfie with the “licking dog” filter.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Rappers are obsessed with this
dialog: Cubist painter.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: RYAN

speaker_heading: BROOKS
text: Big cat shot by asshole dentist.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Cecil the lion!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Time!
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Whoa. Seven. That’s gonna be hard
dialog: to beat.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Not that hard. I’11 go next.
text: Brooks sits as Max steps up. Ryan starts the timer.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Gol!
text: We see Max’s first celebrity on the paper: ED NORTON
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Okay, easy. Annie, the actor we
dialog: met at the airport that time.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: The only famous actor we ever met
dialog: at the airport!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Bobby Flay?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (increasingly flustered
dialog: He’s not an actor. He was in line
dialog: in front of us at Sbarro? We were
dialog: trying to figure out why he wasn’t
text: in the first class lounge.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, yeah. Who was that...?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Goddamn it!
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Y'know, you’ve got a whole room of
dialog: people here who can help out.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Fine! He was the Incredible Hulk.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Eric Bana.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No! The other one.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Mark Ruffalo.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: The other one!
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Lou Ferrigno?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Shit! “Primal Fear.”
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Richard Gere didn’t play the Hulk.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Time's up.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Ed Fuckin’ Norton!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Ohh. Crap. Sorry.
text: Max does a bad job of covering how pissed he is.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Zero points for Max. I’d say he
dialog: blew it, but he won’t tell us. Get
dialog: it?
dialog: 
text: Everyone but Max and Annie laughs.
scene_heading: INT. /EXT. MAX AND ANNIE’S HOUSE - LATER
text: Max and Annie walk their guests out.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Hey, how about we do this next week
dialog: at my house?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: House? What house?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Since I don’t know how long I’11l be
dialog: here, I rented a place.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: BROOKS (CONT'D)
text: It’s a couple miles away. Up on
dialog: Broadmoor.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Ooh, swanky neighborhood.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: It’s a cool place. But it’s pretty
dialog: empty with just me. It’d be fun to
dialog: have you guys over.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I don’t know. It’s kind of a
dialog: tradition to do game night here.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: So what? Could be fun.
text: The others chime in with agreement.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Perfect.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Can we bring anything?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: No. I’ve got everything.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Actually, Max, you may want to
dialog: bring your own bungee cord.
text: They all crack up.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Just gonna keep going back to that
dialog: well, huh?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: I’m sorry. I’m done.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I promise you guys: this will be a
dialog: game night to remember.
text: He hugs Max and gets into his Stingray. Max looks on with a
text: hint of envy, then shuts the door and begins helping Annie
dialog: clean up.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Jackass.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: He’s just trying to get under your
dialog: skin.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah, and he knows exactly how to
dialog: do it. He’s been doing it my whole
dialog: life. I don’t see him for a year,
text: then he pulls up in MY dream car,
dialog: insults our house and tells an
dialog: embarrassing story about me right
dialog: before my turn.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Buying the same car does seem like
dialog: a bit of a “fuck you.” But maybe
dialog: it was his dream car too.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Bullshit. He’s always known how to
dialog: undermine me. You know I’ve never
dialog: won a game against him?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, you’ve got to stop letting it
dialog: bother you. It’s literally killing
dialog: our baby.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What am I supposed to do?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I don’t know. Beat him?
text: Max considers this. It’s a damn good idea.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
scene_heading: CHYRON: “ONE WEEK LATER”
scene_heading: EXT. MAX & ANNIE’S HOUSE - DUSK
text: Max and Annie head out toward his car with some board games.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You don’t want to just Uber there?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I’m not getting drunk tonight. I’m
dialog: gonna be sharp and ready for--
speaker_heading: GARY (0.S.)
dialog: Evening.
text: They both jump and turn to see Gary standing there in the
text: dark, as always in his police uniform, holding his dog.
speaker_heading: MAX ANNIE
dialog: Jesus, Gary! AHH!!
dialog: 26.
text: They hide the board games.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Where you headed?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Just going to my brother’s.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Another game night?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No! No game night. Just dinner.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I see. Pity. I was going to
dialog: invite you over for a dinner I was
dialog: hosting. I’ve purchased four lamb
text: shanks. I’m simmering them in a
text: broth of red wine and rosemary.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: That sounds yummy.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah, it’s too bad we have plans.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: It was Debbie’s recipe. I like to
dialog: think she left me her recipe cards
dialog: as a gesture of goodwill. But most
dialog: likely it was an unintentional
dialog: oversight.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Uh huh. We should get going.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Have fun.
text: Freaked out, Max and Annie head for the car. After a beat,
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: We didn’t say anything.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Oh. Okay.
text: Gary stands there watching as they get into the car.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKS’ HOUSE/INT. CAR - NIGHT
text: Max's car pulls up to a beautiful modern mansion.

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Aw, fuck me.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Guy who rents a house this big has
dialog: to be covering up for something
dialog: small.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No, I’ve seen his dick. It’s
dialog: pretty great.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, I tried.
scene_heading: INT. BROOKS’ HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Brooks opens the door on Max and Annie. The place is all
text: windows and technology. It’s annoyingly tasteful and
text: awesome. Brooks offers them glasses of champagne.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Hey, guys.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Hey. Nice house, Tony Stark.
dialog: Should we give our drink orders to
dialog: Jarvis?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Ha! I got the Tony Stark part but
dialog: then you went full nerd and I lost
dialog: you. Come on in.
text: They follow him into a beautiful living room where Kevin,
text: Michelle and Ryan are having a drink with JILLIAN, a bright,
text: cute girl who seems way more normal than Ryan’s usual dates.
text: Ryan proudly presents Jillian like a prize--
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Oh, hello friends. Allow me to
dialog: introduce you to my date, Jillian.
dialog: Jillian went to Yale University and
dialog: is a software engineer at our
dialog: office, so she’s smart as shit,
dialog: okay?
text: Kevin and Michelle exchange a look.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Okay, that was weird.
dialog: (to Max and Annie)
dialog: Nice to meet you guys.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (they shake)
dialog: You too.
text: Ryan flips Max and Annie off from behind Jillian’s back.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: So maybe you can’t always judge a
dialog: book by its past... covers.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Odd use of that phrase.
dialog: (to Brooks)
dialog: We didn’t know what games you had,
dialog: so we brought a few of our
dialog: favorites.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Oh, cool. Thanks, guys.
text: Brooks takes the games and THROWS THEM ACROSS THE ROOM.
text: Pieces skitter across the stone floor.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What the hell?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: I told you we're taking it up a
dialog: notch. The game we’re playing is
dialog: so epic, it doesn’t need a board or
dialog: pieces.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Still, you didn’t need to throw
text: them across the room.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: I was being theatrical.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Holy shit. Are we doing a fight
dialog: club?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: These super-rich guys pay poor
dialog: people--
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: No. Enough with the fight clubs.
dialog: It’s nonsense.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: So what are we playing?
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: (dramatic)
dialog: In your drinks I’ve placed a
dialog: powerful neurotoxin. You have
dialog: eight hours to find the antidote
text: hidden somewhere in the city.
text: They all exchange looks of disbelief.
speaker_heading: BROOKS (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m just fucking with you. But
dialog: this is not a joke: in the next
dialog: hour, someone in this room will be
dialog: taken. It’ll be up to you to find
dialog: that person before they're
dialog: murdered.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Is this a murder mystery party?!
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Not just any murder mystery party.
dialog: I found this company that does it
dialog: super-real with legit actors. You
dialog: won’t know what’s real and what’s
dialog: fake. Cost me a shit-ton.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Fun!
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: But wait. There’s more. Whoever
dialog: finds the victim wins the grand
dialog: prize: the keys to the Stingray.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Just the keys?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: No, Ryan. The whole car.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Holy shit!
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yes!
dialog: (to Jillian)
dialog: You’re so lucky I brought you to
dialog: this game night and not one of Max
dialog: and Annie's.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Hey.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: No, I just mean because this is
dialog: better.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Come on, Brooks. You’re not
dialog: actually gonna give away your car.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: I need a write-off. Plus, my Audi
dialog: is more practical.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: This is the best night ever.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: So what do we do now?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Now we wait. Maybe play a little
text: drinking game to pass the time.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: We don’t play drinking games.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Tonight we do.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: How about “Never Have I Ever”?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Good one.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (sotto, to Annie)
dialog: Is this all just to one-up us?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Maybe he’s trying to show us a good
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No, that’s not it.
text: Annie rolls her eyes. Max heads off to the bathroom.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKS’ HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A menacing BLACK VAN quietly pulls up and parks outside.
scene_heading: INT. BLACK VAN - NIGHT
text: Two men sit inside -- a scary-looking, squat BALD GUY (40s)
text: and a wiry creepy guy with a PONYTAIL (40s).
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: PONYTAIL
dialog: This the place?
text: The Bald Guy pulls out a scrap of paper with an address
text: scribbled on it -- 1765 Broadmoor Avenue.
speaker_heading: BALD GUY
dialog: This is it.
text: Ponytail dials his cell phone.
speaker_heading: PONYTAIL
dialog: (into phone)
text: We’re at the house. Looks like
text: they’re all inside.
text: Bald Guy takes out a photo of Brooks. Then Ponytail hands
text: him A VERY REAL-LOOKING GUN.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Max exits the bathroom and hears a CLATTERING NOISE from the
text: kitchen. Curious, he slowly makes his way down the hall...
text: Just as he turns the corner he finds himself INCHES AWAY FROM
text: THE BLADE OF A LARGE KNIFE!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Fucking shit!
text: Terrified, Max scrambles back against the wall. REVEAL it’s
text: Brooks holding the knife. Max exhales.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: What the hell’s wrong with you?
dialog: (re: the knife)
dialog: It’s for the cheese.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You sure you don’t need a bigger
dialog: one? Are we cutting a whole wheel
dialog: of gouda?
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - BROOKS’ HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Max and Brooks return. Everyone plays the drinking game.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Never have I ever connected my work
text: computer to a projector in the
dialog: conference room while it was open
text: to a WebMD page on chlamydia
dialog: symptoms.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Dude! Not cool.
text: Everyone laughs.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Drink.
text: He drinks.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: For the record. I didn’t have
dialog: chlamydia. It was a pubic
dialog: dermatitis.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Nasty.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (quietly, to Ryan)
dialog: I like her....
dialog: (then, to Jillian)
dialog: I like you.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: You're not supposed to target
dialog: people with this game. It’s
dialog: supposed to be generic things,
dialog: like... never have I ever slept
dialog: with a celebrity.
text: The others nod. Without thinking, Michelle take a sip of her
text: drink. Halfway through the sip, she realizes Kevin is
text: staring at her in surprise. She sets down her glass.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: You've slept with a celebrity?
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Hmm? No, no. I was just taking a
dialog: drink separate from the game.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Why are you all nervous then?
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: (nervous )
dialog: I’m not nervous. Who’s turn is it?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: I think it’s Max’s turn. It’s
dialog: somebody’s turn. Somebody should
dialog: go now.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: (to Ryan)
dialog: What’s going on here?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: They’ve been together since middle
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Uh oh.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: How could you possibly have had sex
dialog: with a celebrity when we've only
dialog: had sex with each other?
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: You're making this into something
dialog: it’s not.
text: Max turns to Brooks.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: This is why we don’t play drinking
dialog: games.
text: SFX: BANG! BANG! BANG!
text: Everyone jumps at the sound of banging. They all look at the
text: front door except for Kevin who stares at Michelle.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Open up!
speaker_heading: BROOKS
text: Looks like the game is afoot.
text: He crosses to the door and opens it on an imposing, extremely
text: serious 40-something MAN in a dark suit and sunglasses.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Are you Brooks Davis?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: (mock serious)
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I’m Agent Henderson. FBI. Please
dialog: sit down.
text: Brooks joins the others as the man enters.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Sunglasses at night. This guy’s
dialog: the real deal.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: AGENT HENDERSON
dialog: I'll get right to the point. The
text: Bureau has been tracking a ring of
dialog: violent kidnappers in this
dialog: neighborhood. We have reason to
dialog: believe that one of you may be
dialog: their next victim.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Quick question, Agent Henderson?
dialog: Why is this a federal
dialog: investigation? Seems more like a
dialog: local police matter.
text: Annie swats Max: “play along.” Agent Henderson glares at Max
text: but says nothing. He hands each of them a folder.
speaker_heading: AGENT HENDERSON
text: Contained in these dossiers are the
dialog: clues you’ll need to find the
dialog: kidnappers.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: We have to find them? What’s the
dialog: Bureau’s role in this?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Maybe the FBI can take my wife in
dialog: for questioning. ‘Cause
dialog: apparently, she’s got a whole
dialog: secret life I don’t know anything
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Honey--
speaker_heading: AGENT HENDERSON
dialog: (barking)
dialog: Shut up! All of you! This isn’t a
dialog: joke!
text: He gets up in Max’s face.
speaker_heading: AGENT HENDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: (intense)
dialog: You people are in serious danger
dialog: and we are running out of time
dialog: here! I will not stand idly by and
dialog: see more civilians slaughtered on
dialog: my watch!
text: Max glances over at Brooks and gives him a grudgingly
text: impressed look.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: He’s pretty good, huh?
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: AGENT HENDERSON
dialog: Now, before we get started I’m
dialog: required to ask if anyone here has
dialog: any food allergies--
text: BOOM!!! The FRONT DOOR IS KICKED OPEN, splintering off its
text: hinges. Bald Guy and Ponytail walk in wearing ski masks.
speaker_heading: AGENT HENDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Who the hell are you?
text: Ponytail COLD COCKS the “FBI Agent.” He goes down hard.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Guys! I know you’re “method” and
dialog: all but you can’t just break my
dialog: door--
text: Bald Guy walks up to Brooks and PUNCHES HIM IN THE GUT.
text: Brooks doubles over.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Okay, I actually don’t mind this
dialog: game.
text: Brooks shoves the guy away.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: ARE YOU CRAZY?!
text: Ponytail grabs Brooks in a headlock from behind. Brooks
text: backs up, slamming Ponytail into the wall.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Wow. This is kind of intense...
text: The fight continues. It’s SLOPPY AND SURPRISINGLY VIOLENT as
text: Brooks does a decent job of defending himself.
text: ANGLE ON the rest of the group sitting on the sofas calmly
text: eating chips and drinking cocktails like they’re watching a
dialog: movie.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (to Max)
dialog: This is very well done.
speaker_heading: MAX
text: Hm. Ski masks are a little on the
dialog: nose.
text: Ponytail is shoved onto the coffee table in front of them.
text: Ryan plucks the champagne bottle out of his way in the nick
dialog: of time.
text: Brooks manages to get loose from the Bald Guy. He reaches
text: down to his ankle and pulls out a SMALL HANDGUN.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (playful)
dialog: Watch out. He’s packin’ heat!
text: Brooks aims the gun at Bald Guy but it’s knocked out of his
text: hand by Ponytail. The gun skitters across the room and comes
text: to a stop at Annie’s feet. She looks down at it.
text: The fight spills out of the living room and into the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - BROOKS’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Brooks faces off against the two attackers, wielding pots,
text: utensils and whatever he can grab as a weapon. It’s like a
dialog: Bourne movie except these guys are not nearly as coordinated.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - BROOKS’ HOUSE
text: The group are as we left them. We can hear the sounds of
text: breaking glass, clattering pans and pained grunts coming from
text: the kitchen. After a beat, Max slices a sliver of cheese.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: This is good.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Try it with the prosciutto.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Are we sure this is all part of the
dialog: thing?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Oh, yeah. Brooks always goes all-
dialog: out.
dialog: (to the group)
dialog: Remember that fireworks display he
dialog: got for their wedding--?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (abruptly)
dialog: Yeah, Ryan. We talked about that.
text: Suddenly, Brooks flies into the room, landing on his back.
text: There’s broken glass in his hair and he’s got a bloody nose.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
text: Ooh, they put some makeup on him.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Help me! Please! This isn’t--
text: Bald Guy pins Brooks down and SLAPS TAPE over his mouth.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (slow clapping)
dialog: Very impressive. And the
dialog: Independent Spirit Award goes to...
text: Brooks tries to buck Bald Guy off of him. Ponytail takes his
text: gun out of his belt and points it at Brooks.
speaker_heading: PONYTAIL
dialog: Stop fighting, asshole!
text: Bald Guy pulls out a bag and puts it over Brooks’ head. He
text: and Ponytail drag the struggling Brooks out of the house.
text: Bald Guy stops at the door and points his gun at the gang--
speaker_heading: BALD GUY
dialog: First one that follows us out, I
text: shoot in the face.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: M'kay, drive safe.
text: The men hustle Brooks out. There’s a beat as the group
text: continue to sip their drinks.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: There’s something about this that
text: doesn’t make sense.
dialog: (to Michelle)
dialog: What did I do that made you want to
dialog: cheat on me with a celebrity?!
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: I didn’t cheat on you. It was
dialog: before we got married. When we
dialog: took that break.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Oh my god. My world is collapsing.
text: As Kevin and Michelle bicker, Ryan crosses to the supine “FBI
text: Agent” and nudges him with his foot.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Agent Henderson? You gonna keep
dialog: lying there?
text: He doesn’t move.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Jillian)
dialog: He’s a regular Daniel Day Lewis.
text: Meanwhile, Max discreetly grabs one of the dossiers and he
text: and Annie scurry off to another room. Jillian notices. She
text: holds up another dossier to Ryan. They hurry off as well.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: (to Michelle)
dialog: ...we both agreed we wouldn’t hook
dialog: up with anyone during that break.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Yeah, but then you went and got a
text: handjob from Karen Waller.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: It was over the pants! And I felt
dialog: guilty the whole time. But I guess
dialog: I shouldn’t have.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: You're making this into something--
dialog: (then noticing)
dialog: Oh hell. They got the jump on us.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: grabs dossier)
dialog: Come on! But this isn’t over.
text: They hurry out.
scene_heading: IN QUICK CUTS:
text: --IN THE KITCHEN, Max and Annie go over the dossier:
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Here's the first clue. It looks
text: like a riddle.
dialog: (reads )
text: With shiny fangs...
text: --IN A BEDROOM, Ryan and Jillian read the rules:
speaker_heading: JILLIAN

dialog: ..-my bloodless bite...
text: --IN A HALLWAY, Michelle reads:

speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Donald Trump!
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: I don’t think that’s it.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: How do you know? Did you fuck him?
scene_heading: --IN THE KITCHEN--
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: “Bloodless bite”? So it’s not a
dialog: vampire. Let me Google this.
text: She takes out her phone.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: This is so inconsistent. They
text: choreograph a super-realistic fight
dialog: and then they give us an FBI
dialog: dossier with riddles in it? Pick a
dialog: tone and stick with it.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Do you want that car or not?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: More than anything ever. But I
dialog: feel like Brooks is setting me up
dialog: here. This is just another game
dialog: where somehow he’s gonna humiliate
dialog: me.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I say we find a shortcut.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: How do we do that?
text: Max notices her phone.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: His phone! It was in his pocket
dialog: when they grabbed him.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You want to call him?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I want to track him.
text: He points to Brooks’ iPad lying on the kitchen counter. They
text: give each other an excited look.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - BROOKS’ HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Ryan and Jillian are studying the dossier.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: “Bloodless bite... bloodless
dialog: bite... bloodless bite...”
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Maybe stop saying “bloodless bite”
dialog: so I can think?
dialog: 40.
text: They hear a CAR DOOR SLAM out the window. They glance out to
text: see Max and Annie getting in their car and backing out of the
dialog: driveway.
dialog: She spots
dialog: She finds
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Shit. They must've already figured
dialog: it out. We’ve gotta up our game.
dialog: There’s nothing more dangerous than
dialog: Max when he’s got something to
dialog: prove.
dialog: (then)
dialog: “Bloodless bite... bloodless
dialog: bite...”
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Stop that!
dialog: (then)
dialog: We need to find an advantage.
text: a wallet on the bedside table and picks it up.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Brooks’ wallet? You think we
dialog: should just steal all his shit?
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: No.
text: Brooks’ credit card and dials a number on her cell.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yes, hi. I lost my credit card and
dialog: I’m wondering if you can tell me
dialog: the last few charges I made?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: (covering phone)
dialog: If we can find the name of the
dialog: murder mystery company he used we
dialog: can go to their office and pay them
dialog: off to give us the final clue.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Whoa. You are a double threat:
dialog: brains and sneakiness.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: (not exactly flattered)
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 4l.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Kevin and Michelle are still puzzling over the clue.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
text: What has shiny fangs that bites

speaker_heading: MICHELLE

dialog: A stapler! The white things are
dialog: paper!
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Yes! I would kiss you but I don’t
dialog: know where those lips have been.
text: She rolls her eyes.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Look around for a stapler.
text: They move down the hall and enter
scene_heading: INT. BROOKS’ STUDY - CONTINUOUS
text: A windowless room with a skylight in the ceiling. Lots of
text: bound books, a desk, etc.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Found one!
text: He grabs a stapler off the desk and opens it. Inside is a
scene_heading: FLASHDRIVE.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Here. Put it in the desktop.
text: Kevin plugs it into the computer and a text box opens.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
text: Another riddle.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: (reads)

scene_heading: INT. MAX’S CAR - NIGHT

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yup. We’re catching up.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Can you imagine Brooks’ face when
dialog: we find him so fast?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It’s gonna be so good. Y’‘know, I
dialog: think I can actually feel my sperm
text: coming back to life.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Perfect. We'll win your brother's
text: car and then go make a baby in it.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah! And we'll make him watch us!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What? I don’t want to do that.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I don’t either. I don’t know why I
dialog: said that.
scene_heading: INT. BROOKS’ HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Jillian finishes her call.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Great. Thank you.
dialog: (hangs up)
dialog: Let’s go. I got the game company’s

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yes! You rock.
text: He goes to hug her. Expecting a high-five, she puts up a

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Hey, guys, just wanted to wish you
dialog: the best of luck tonight.
text: Kevin and Michelle look at him quizzically as he shuts the

speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Oh, being a dick.

scene_heading: INT. BROOKS’ STUDY - CONTINUOUS
text: Kevin tries the door but it won't budge.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: That son of a bitch.
dialog: (calling through door)
dialog: You son of a bitch!
text: He throws his shoulder against the door. Nothing. He spots
text: some candles on a shelf.
speaker_heading: KEVIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hand me those matches. I’m gonna
dialog: burn down this door.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: You’re gonna light a fire ina
dialog: windowless room that we’re trapped
dialog: in?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: _ (pouty)
dialog: Fine. Don’t hand me the matches.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: What about that?
text: He looks up to see a SKYLIGHT twelve feet overhead. His eyes
dialog: narrow.
scene_heading: INT. MAX’S CAR - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON an iPad screen. The BLIP of Brooks’ phone stops
text: moving, then disappears.
speaker_heading: MAX
text: Hold on. Brooks’ phone just
dialog: disappeared.

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Crap. Where did you last see it?
speaker_heading: MAX
text: Corner of 5th and Kenmore.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER
text: They pull into a deserted lot in a sketchy neighborhood.
text: They get out of the car and look around.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Where could he be?
text: Max notices a dumpster that sits behind an unmarked building.
text: He crosses to it and glances in. Inside he spots a cell
text: phone. He retrieves it.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Found it. It’s turned off.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: He must’ve known we were tracking
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Damn it. They outsmarted us.
dialog: (noticing)
dialog: Hang on...
text: He points across the street to where Ponytail is finishing a
text: cigarette outside of a dive bar. He heads back inside.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Isn’t that one of the actors?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah. I guess they’re not that
dialog: smart.
text: They high-five each other.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: We are nailing this! Come on!
text: They head across the street, instinctively staying low.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Why are we crouching?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I don’t know. Feels right?
dialog: 45.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT
text: Max and Annie enter, trying to look casual. There’s a BURLY
text: BARTENDER, a half-asleep DRUNK GUY, and in a corner booth,
text: facing away from them is Ponytail.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (sotto, re: Ponytail)
dialog: There he is. Don’t let him see
dialog: you.
text: They take a seat at the bar. Max signals to the tattooed
dialog: bartender.
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Sir? You wouldn’t happen to have
dialog: seen a guy brought in here. Looks
dialog: a bit like me with a stronger chin,
text: higher cheekbones.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: So, a better looking guy?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Okay, well, that’s not necessarily--
text: Annie gives the bartender a look to say “kind of, yes.”
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: I didn’t see nothing.
text: He moves off. Max’s eyes narrow.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: “Didn't see nothing”? That double-
dialog: negative felt a bit forced, huh?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I bet he’s in on it. Look at how
text: fresh his tats are. Probably fake.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Let’s test him. We’ll order drinks
dialog: only a real bartender would know
dialog: how to make.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Smart.
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Barkeep?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Can I have a vodka tonic, please?
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I choked.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (to Bartender)
dialog: I’ll take a Harvey Wallbanger.
text: The bartender looks at him, annoyed. Then goes to make the
dialog: drinks.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: This is kinda fun, isn’t it?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah. It is nice to get out of the
dialog: house. Y’know, we won’t be able to
dialog: do this kind of thing when we have
dialog: a kid.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: ‘Cause when you have a kid, you
dialog: stop living for you and you start
dialog: living for them. That’s why Brooks
dialog: has got it made.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: So, what are you saying?
text: Max just shrugs as the bartender sets down their drinks.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Vodka tonic. Harvey Wallbanger.
text: Max takes a sip.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Did he get it right?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I don’t know. I realize I’ve never
dialog: actually had one. But it’s tasty.
dialog: Tart.
text: Suddenly, Max reacts as Bald Guy exits a back room, locks it,
dialog: 
text: then tosses the keys to the Bartender. Behind him, we catch
text: a brief glimpse of a man tied to a chair. It’s Brooks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Holy shit. Brooks is back there.
dialog: We’re about to win this thing!
dialog: 47.
text: Bald Guy has crossed over to Ponytail. He has noticed Max
text: and Annie and he’s pointing them out to Ponytail.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Uh oh. They made us.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You think they’re gonna try and
dialog: stop us?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: We already know they take their
dialog: roles pretty seriously. But the
dialog: good news is, so do I.
text: She reaches into her purse and pulls out the GUN BROOKS
text: DROPPED EARLIER.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What the-- where did you get that?!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: It’s the fake gun Brooks “dropped”
text: in the fight.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: How do you know it’s fake?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You think your brother would use a
text: real gun in a fake fight with
dialog: actors he hired?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Good point. So, what are we gonna
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Follow my lead.
text: She gets to her feet and points the gun at the men.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Any of you fucking pricks move, and
dialog: I'll execute every motherfuckin'
dialog: last one of you!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: “Pulp Fiction.” Nice.
speaker_heading: PONYTAIL
dialog: What the fuck is this?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Hand over the keys. We’re taking
dialog: my brother.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: BALD GUY
dialog: Bullshit.
text: Caught up in her role, Annie gets closer to Bald Guy and aims
text: her gun right at him.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You know what’s bullshit? Your
dialog: bald fucking head.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Getting a little personal, hon.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (“angrily” to Bald Guy)
dialog: I’m sorry I called you bald! It
dialog: works on you because you have a
dialog: very symmetrical face!
dialog: (then)
dialog: Okay, all of you. On your knees.
text: Eyes shut. Hands in the air.
text: Heads on the floor.
text: The thugs try to comply but can’t remember everything. They
text: all assume different positions.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
text: I said hands in the air.
speaker_heading: PONYTAIL
dialog: Where’s my head go?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: On the floor! And close your eyes.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: How do I put my hands in the air
dialog: with my head on the floor?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I had the same question.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Okay, child's pose. You guys know
dialog: child’s pose?
text: They give her blank looks. She hands the gun to Max.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Cover me.
dialog: (then, to the men)
dialog: It’s like this...
text: She gets on the floor and demonstrates the position. The men
dialog: follow suit.
dialog: 49,
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: If you’re doing it right, you’ll
dialog: feel your lumbar really opening up.

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: There it is!
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
text: Looks like they’re still open.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I am so glad I invited you tonight.
dialog: I usually bring these girls I want
dialog: to sleep with and they always suck.
dialog: You're a breath of fresh air.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Oh, nice. I usually go out with
dialog: guys who are interesting and smart.
dialog: So this is a first for me too.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Are we cool? Did I say something
dialog: wrong?
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: No. I guess I didn’t realize when
dialog: you invited me tonight that it was
dialog: just because you needed a ringer.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Ohh. You thought this was a date.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: It's fine. The more I get to know
dialog: you, the happier I am that it’s
dialog: not.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (oblivious )
dialog: So we are cool?
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: As a cucumber. Let’s just win that

scene_heading: INT. “MURDER WE WROTE” OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Ryan and Jillian enter a small reception area. Behind a desk
text: a WOMAN sits facing away from us in a swivel chair.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Hello?
text: No answer. She and Ryan exchange a look. Ryan slowly
text: reaches out and swivels the chair around revealing...
text: A DEAD WOMAN WITH A FRESH BULLET HOLE IN HER FOREHEAD. Her
text: eyes are closed. Blood trickles from the wound and the
text: corner of her mouth.
speaker_heading: RYAN/JILLIAN
dialog: Holy shit!/Ahhh!
text: Startled by the noise, the dead woman SUDDENLY OPENS HER
speaker_heading: EYES.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Oh my gosh! You scared me.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: What the fuck is this?!
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: What?
text: (remembering, touches her
dialog: forehead)
dialog: Oh. I just came from a six hour
dialog: murder mystery where I played the
dialog: corpse. I guess I fell asleep
dialog: before I cleaned up.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: You scared the shit out of us.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Oh, thank you. I do my own makeup.
dialog: How can I help you?
text: A bit of blood dribbles from her mouth.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: We need you to give us the final
dialog: clue for the murder mystery Brooks
dialog: Davis ordered.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: But that would ruin the fun.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: We don’t want the fun. We just
dialog: want to win.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: I can’t do that.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (sly) .
dialog: Would this change your mind?
text: He slides a bill across the desk. It’s a ten dollar bill.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: What about this?
text: He slides another bill across. It’s a five. She looks at
text: him unimpressed.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You drive a hard bargain. Okay,
dialog: let's take it up a notch.
text: He slides another bill. It’s a one. The Receptionist looks
text: at Jillian. Jillian shakes her head: “Don’t look at me.”
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I was hoping I wasn’t going to have
dialog: to dig this deep.
text: He goes back into his wallet. Considers for a beat, then
text: reluctantly slides another bill over. It’s another one
dialog: dollar bill.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Okay, y’know what? It doesn’t
dialog: matter how slowly you push it over.
text: It’s still seventeen dollars.
dialog: (to Receptionist)
dialog: How much do you need?
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: A hundred?
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Give her a hundred.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Fine.
text: He slowly slides all the bills back toward himself, then
text: slides a hundred dollar bill toward the woman. She reaches

speaker_heading: KEVIN

speaker_heading: MICHELLE

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Okay, any of you dickwalls move a
dialog: muscle I’1l shoot off your tits.
dialog: You got me?
text: The men grumble. Annie’s phone rings. She checks it. It’s
text: Michelle. She hits “ignore.”
text: Max and Annie enter the backroom and shut the door.
dialog: 57.
scene_heading: INT. BACKROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: They quickly lock the door behind them and turn to Brooks,
text: who is tied to a chair and gagged with tape. His eyes go
text: wide when he sees them.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Oh, look at that face. That is
dialog: priceless.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You did not expect us this early,
dialog: did you?
text: Brooks frantically grunts and tries to scream through his
dialog: gag.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I’ve gotta capture this moment.
text: He takes out his phone, poses beside Brooks with Annie on the
text: other side and snaps a selfie of the three of them. Just
text: then, the phone rings. It’s Ryan. He shows Annie.
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
text: Probably begging for help.
text: He hits “ignore.”
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: I feel like maybe we should call
dialog: that company and complain because
dialog: this wasn’t much of a mystery.
text: Brooks MOANS wildly, practically JUMPING OUT OF HIS CHAIR
text: trying to communicate.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: All right, all right...
text: She yanks off Brooks’ gag.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: (as soon as the gag’s off)
dialog: THIS ISN’T A GAME!
text: BANG! Someone begins kicking the door from the other side.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Why, because we kicked your ass?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Max, THOSE ARE NOT THE GUYS I
speaker_heading: HIRED!
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Oh I get it. Now you’re trying to
dialog: change the rules on us?
text: BANG! The door shakes.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Listen to me. I’m not a venture
dialog: capitalist. I’m a smuggler!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: A smuggler? What the hell are you
dialog: talking about?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: (scared)
dialog: I fucked up. I sold the
dialog: Bulgarian’s egg to a different guy
dialog: and now I have to get it back or
dialog: he’s gonna kill me.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Ooh, the Bulgarian’s egg. Did you
dialog: trade it for the Maltese Falcon?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Wait. This isn’t the end?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You said whoever found you got the
text: car. Game over.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: I’m telling you. This isn’t a
dialog: game! It’s all real!
text: SMASH! The door starts to splinter.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Uh huh. Those shitty actors are
dialog: real? That fight was real?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: This gun is real?
text: She points the gun at the ceiling...
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Annie, stop!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh no. Bang bang--
text: She pulls the trigger. BANG! A REAL BULLET SHATTERS the
text: hanging florescent light above them.
dialog: 59.
text: Startled, Annie drops the gun. It hits the tloor and FIRES
scene_heading: AGAIN. BANG!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: ow!
text: Max looks down at his arm. It looks okay... until a red
text: circle of blood appears through his shirt. Annie just shot
text: him. A stunned beat, then--
speaker_heading: ANNIE MAX (CONT'D)
text: AAAAHHHHH! ! WHAT IN THE FUCK!!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: OH MY GOD I SHOT YOU!!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: YOU FUCKING SHOT ME!!!
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: I told you! Untie me! Quick!
text: Annie unties Brooks, her hands shaking as Bald Guy and
text: Ponytail burst into the room.
text: They spot the bag with their weapons and go for it as Max,
text: Brooks and Annie run to the rear emergency exit door.
text: Ponytail and Bald Guy retrieve their guns and FIRE in their
dialog: direction.
speaker_heading: BROOKS (CONT’D)
dialog: Go!
scene_heading: EXT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT
text: Annie, Max and Brooks sprint across the street to their car,
text: still screaming.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You shot me!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I know! I feel terrible!
text: Annie runs over to the driver’s side and unlocks it, getting
text: behind the wheel. Brooks jumps in the backseat as Annie
text: peels out with Max in the passenger seat.
text: Bald Guy and Ponytail race to their van, firing wild shots at
text: the car as they go.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: STOP!!
dialog: (another gunshot)
dialog: STOP DOING THAT!
dialog: 60.
text: They barrel around a corner.
scene_heading: INT. MAX’S CAR - NIGHT
text: Annie drives like a madwoman while Max clutches his arm--
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It’s all real! How did it all get
dialog: real?!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You shot me! I’m bleeding out of
dialog: my arm. I’m gonna die tonight.
text: Brooks reaches from the backseat and wraps a gym towel around
text: Max's forearm.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Here. Hold this on there.
text: The van closes in on their car.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What the fuck is going on, Brooks?
dialog: Talk!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: They're right behind us!
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: I've been lying to you and the rest
dialog: of the family about what I do. I
dialog: buy and sell things that aren’t
dialog: strictly legal for people who
dialog: aren't strictly... good.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: So you're a criminal?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Yes. And I made a mistake.
dialog: There’s this guy. They call him
text: the Bulgarian. He has his fingers
dialog: in all these pies around the world.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What kind of pies?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Bad pies, Max. Pies that have
text: heroin in them and guns and sex
dialog: slaves. He asked me to find this
dialog: Fabergé egg for him. And I found
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: BROOKS (CONT'D)
dialog: But then I heard about this other
dialog: guy, Marlon Freeman, who was
dialog: willing to pay twice as much for
dialog: the same egg.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (re: the van)
dialog: So these guys work for the
dialog: Bulgarian? And they just happened
dialog: to crash your murder mystery party?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: I know. What are they odds?
dialog: (then)
dialog: I never should've gotten into
dialog: business with that guy. I’m too
dialog: small-time for this shit!
text: The van has caught up and suddenly SWERVES into the side of
text: their car. They FISHTAIL, nearly running onto the sidewalk
text: before Annie regains control and speeds away.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: We need to go to the cops!
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: We can’t! He’s got cops on his
dialog: payroll. I’11 be dead before I
dialog: even get to jail.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Then why don’t you go to this
text: Marlon Freeman and buy the egg back
dialog: from him?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: I couldn't find him if I wanted.
dialog: That name was an alias.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What do we do?! These guys aren’t
dialog: stopping!
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: They won’t stop till they get me.
dialog: (making a decision)
dialog: I’m sorry I dragged you into all
dialog: this. I’m sorry for a lot of
dialog: things.
text: He opens his car door.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: I love you, Maxie.
dialog: 62.
text: And with that, Brooks rolls out of the moving car. He lands
text: hard on the street as the van SCREECHES TO A STOP a few feet
text: away from him.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No! Stop the car!
text: Annie brakes a couple hundred feet from the van. They look
text: back to see Ponytail and Bald Guy grab Brooks and haul him
text: toward the van.
text: Bald Guy raises his gun and fires a couple shots in their
text: direction. Annie steps on the gas and tears away.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Shit! Shit! Shit!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What are we gonna do? They’re
dialog: gonna kill my brother.
dialog: (then)
text: I feel faint. I’m gonna pass out.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: We've gotta get you to a hospital.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No! It’s a gunshot wound. They’1ll
dialog: call the police.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: So, let’s go to a mob doctor!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Do you know a mob doctor?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Of course not!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Then why did you say a mob doctor?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Because I’m losing my shit here!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You're going to have to do it.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You're gonna have to take the
dialog: bullet out.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I don’t want to.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I don’t want you to either, hon.
dialog: I’ve seen you try to cut a chicken.
dialog: But we don’t have a lot of options.
text: Off her look of nauseated horror,
scene_heading: EXT. 7-11 PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Annie exits the convenience story with a bag of stuff. Her
text: phone rings. It’s Michelle.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hey.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. BROOKS’ KITCHEN - SAME TIME
text: Michelle and Kevin share her phone. Ryan and Jillian stand
dialog: nearby.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Thank god. Listen, honey, it’s all
dialog: real--
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: We know. Brooks is caught up in
dialog: something. Where are you right
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
text: We're all at Brooks’s waiting to
dialog: talk to the cops.
text: Through a doorway, we see TWO POLICE OFFICERS taking a
text: statement from Agent Henderson. An EMT tends to his head.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Don’t talk to the cops!
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Why? What’s going on? Are you
dialog: guys okay?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: We're fine. I shot Max but he’s
dialog: fine.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: What?!
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: We’ll meet you back at our house.
dialog: Just don’t tell the cops anything.
dialog: Brooks's life depends on it.
text: Annie hangs up. Michelle digests this, then
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: (quietly to the other)
dialog: Come on. We’ve gotta get out of
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (full volume)
dialog: Where are we going?
text: She shoves him toward the kitchen door. The others follow.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: I thought we were gonna talk to the
dialog: cops.
text: Jillian rolls her eyes as she ushers Ryan out.
scene_heading: EXT. 7-11 - NIGHT
text: Annie walks around to the rear of the store to find Max
text: sitting on the hood of the car, cradling his arm.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I got a bunch of stuff.
text: She begins laying out items on the hood.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
text: Tweezers, pocket knife, gauze,
dialog: sewing kit.
text: Max picks up a bottle of white wine.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: They didn’t have rubbing alcohol
dialog: and they don’t sell hard liquor so
dialog: I got this chardonnay.
text: Max twists off the top and takes a slug, then notices a
text: magazine in the bag.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Country Living magazine? What's
dialog: that for?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It’s for later.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: They have a butternut squash soup
dialog: recipe that looked great.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Now put this in your mouth.
text: She hands him a DOG’s SQUEAKY CHEW TOY in the shape of a
text: hamburger. Max sighs and bites down on the toy. SQUEAK!
text: Annie rolls up his sleeve and recoils at the bloody mess.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh god!
text: She takes out her phone, types something and sets it on the
dialog: hood.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (mouth full)
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Instructions on how to remove a
dialog: bullet. It’s an alt-right militia
dialog: website so I’m just gonna ignore
dialog: the racist stuff... “Step one:
dialog: sterile gloves.”
text: She slips on a pair of rubber dishwashing gloves.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Check. “Step two: clean wound with
dialog: antiseptic.”
text: She pours the wine over Max’s arm. SQUEAK!
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry. “Three: administer
dialog: anesthetic.” Gonna skip that...
dialog: “Four: apply pressure above the
dialog: wound.” Here. Squeeze there.
text: She takes his other hand and Max squeezes his injured arm.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: “Make small incision on each side
dialog: of wound.” Oh jeez. Here we go.
text: She opens the pocket knife, pours some wine on it and cuts
text: into his arm. SQUEEEEEAAK! She continues to cut. Max spits
text: out the dog toy.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Nope! Too big! You're cutting too
dialog: big! It’s a bullet, not a golf
dialog: ball.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, I don’t know!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: So much blood.
text: He dry heaves a little.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Don’t you do that! You’re gonna
dialog: make me-- DAWWWWWWW!
text: She dry heaves. Max dry heaves. They manage to collect
dialog: themselves.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: That was close. Okay, next step...
dialog: shit!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: My phone went to sleep. Hang on.
text: She takes off her glove and re-enters her passcode.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Just set it so it stays on.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: My phone doesn’t do that.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: We have the same phone! It does
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It’s fine. 1I'’11 just touch the
dialog: screen with my nose every 30
dialog: seconds.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Why are you so afraid of your
dialog: phone? Just go to “settings,” then
text: “display” then adjust the time
text: before it reverts to sleep mode.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: “Revert”? What are you, Steve
dialog: Jobs?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It's the easiest fucking thing!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Enough! I know what I’m doing!
dialog: 67.
text: She touches her nose to the screen. Max rolls his eyes. She
text: reads the next step.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, this is going to hurt.
dialog: Where’s your squeaky hamburger?
text: She finds it and shoves it in his mouth. She takes the
text: tweezers and begins digging around in the bullet hole. Max
text: writhes in pain.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I feel something hard. I think I
dialog: found the bullet...
text: She taps something with the tip of her tweezers. We hear a
text: clinking sound. Max inhales painfully.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s really wedged in there. Why
dialog: won't it come out? Oh wait.
dialog: That’s bone. I’m sorry.
text: Sweat and tears pour down Max’s face.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I can’t find it. Let me see what
dialog: the racists say if you can’t find
dialog: the bullet...
text: She touches her nose to the phone again, then suddenly
text: notices something on Max’s arm.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hang on. What’s this? Did you get
dialog: shot twice?!
text: She shows him a hole on the other side of his arm. Max spits
text: out the chew toy again.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: God damn it, Annie. That’s an exit
dialog: wound.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Ohhh. Well, that’s good news,
dialog: right?
text: Max looks like he’s going to faint. Annie inspects the
dialog: wound.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (disgusted)
dialog: This one’s even uglier than the
text: entry wound. WHAAUUUGGGH!
text: She dry heaves.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Stop that-- BWAHHHHH!
text: He dry heaves. They both dry heave together.
scene_heading: INT. MAX AND ANNIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Max and Annie bring Ryan, Jillian, Kevin and Michelle up to
dialog: speed.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: ...now the Bulgarian’s guys have
dialog: Brooks and the only way to save him
dialog: is to get that egg back from this
dialog: Marlon Freeman guy.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Man. I can’t believe your brother
dialog: has been lying to us this whole
dialog: time.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He’s even cooler than we thought!
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: I didn’t even know Morgan Freeman
dialog: collected Fabergé eggs. Aren’t
dialog: those worth millions of dollars?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Marlon Freeman. But that’s just an
dialog: alias. Somehow we need to find his
dialog: real name and address.
speaker_heading: RYAN
text: Police computer.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I once dated this girl who’s dad
dialog: was a cop. She had these big,
text: thick legs but not a trace of flab.
text: Solid muscle. She looked like the
dialog: mom in “The Incredibles.” Y‘know?
dialog: Tiny little waist but then it V's
dialog: out-—
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Why are you telling us this?!
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Oh. Sorry. She showed me her
dialog: dad's police computer one time.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s got this database with every
dialog: known alias. I bet you could find
dialog: Marlon Wayans’ real name on that.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: If you called her do you think
dialog: she’d let you use her dad’s
dialog: computer again?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Oh, no. No way. It ended very
dialog: badly.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: I’m shocked.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Well, how are we gonna get ona
dialog: police computer without the cops
dialog: knowing?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: I've got it!
text: They all turn to him.
speaker_heading: KEVIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Billy Bob Thornton.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: (to Michelle)
dialog: You slept with Billy Bob Thornton,
dialog: didn’t you?
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Then why was he so friendly to you
dialog: that one time at 24 Hour Fitness?
dialog: It felt like you already knew each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: That wasn’t Billy Bob Thornton!
dialog: That was Shawn, my dental
dialog: hygienist.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: That's awfully convenient, isn’t
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: For who?
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: Everyone shut up for a second.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I know where we can get on a police
dialog: computer.
scene_heading: EXT. GARY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Gary opens the door on Max, Annie, Ryan, Jillian, Kevin and
text: Michelle, all wearing unnaturally wide smiles.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Heeeyyy, Gare....
text: REVERSE TO REVEAL: Gary, a lamb shank in one hand, Bastian
text: the dog in the other. A napkin tucked into his police
text: uniform. From inside we can hear the faint, tinny sound of
text: Al Jolson crooning “Toot, Toot, Tootsie!”
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Goodness. To what do Bastian and I
dialog: owe the pleasure?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: We were all talking and we realized
dialog: we haven’t had a game night in
dialog: ages. Just the seven of us.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (dubious )
dialog: It’s ten o’clock. And I thought
dialog: you were going to your brother's
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: MAX
text: He was tied up.
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: With work.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Come on, Gare Bear, it’s the
dialog: weekend. Live a little.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: We were just saying how you were
dialog: always better at games than Debbie
dialog: was.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (intense)
dialog: I‘1l thank you not to besmirch my
dialog: ex-wife. That woman is an angel.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: (backtracking)
dialog: Whoa. Okay. No, I mean I like
dialog: her. We all like her.
text: Gary's wild-eyed look gives way to a smile.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I will admit, I have eagerly
dialog: awaited a visit such as this.
text: He backs into the darkness of his house and the creepy 1920's
dialog: music.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Do we follow him?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Seems like it.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: (pushing Ryan)
dialog: You go first.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I'm afraid.
text: They all nervously enter.
scene_heading: INT. GARY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The group sit around a coffee table as Jillian finishes
text: building a Jenga tower. Gary enters with a bowl.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Help yourselves to popped corn with
dialog: sea salt.
text: Gary plops the bowl in Max’s arms right on his covered wound.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (wincing)
text: ARRGGHHHH...
dialog: (covering)
dialog: I love popped corn!
text: Ryan notices a framed photo on a table. It shows the game
text: night group, including Gary’s ex-wife Debbie, with Gary
text: looming in the background.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: You have a framed photo of game
dialog: night?
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Doesn’t everyone have photos of
dialog: their best friends in their homes?
text: The group exchange guilty looks.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Of course. Max, you want to go
dialog: first?
text: Max takes out the first piece then stands.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I’m sorry, could I use your
dialog: bathroom?
speaker_heading: GARY
text: Of course. Just down the hall,
dialog: past our bedr--
text: (he shuts his eyes,
dialog: pained)
dialog: --my bedroom.
text: The others give Max a knowing look as he heads off. Bastian
text: the dog trots after Max.
scene_heading: INT. GARY'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Max hurries to the bathroom, turns on the light and fan, then
text: closes the door without going in. He spots another room and
text: quickly ducks inside. Bastian follows.
scene_heading: INT. GARY’S STUDY - NIGHT
text: The room is a SHRINE to Debbie. Photos, keepsakes,
text: embroidered pillows, greeting cards, an ENORMOUS WEDDING
text: PHOTO of her and Gary over the desk.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Jesus.
text: He spots a reinforced police laptop on the desk and opens it.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. GARY'S LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Michelle carefully slides a piece out of the Jenga tower.
text: There are four players left before Max’s turn.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: So, Jillian. How long have you and
dialog: Ryan been a couple?
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Oh, no. We just work together.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I see. I thought I detected a
dialog: certain chemistry between the two
dialog: of you.
text: Jillian and Ryan do their best to laugh this off.
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Then again, I’m not the world’s
dialog: best judge of chemistry.
text: He lets out THE MOST MIRTHLESS LAUGH IN HISTORY. The others
text: look deeply uncomfortable.
text: BACK IN THE STUDY, Max has pulled up the National Police
text: Database and enters “Marlon Freeman.” A profile comes up
text: showing a surveillance photo of a distinguished white man in
text: his 40's, PETER ANDERTON. His suspected crimes include
dialog: trafficking in stolen artifacts, insider trading, illegal
dialog: weapons sales, etc.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Hello, Peter Anderton...
text: Max doesn’t notice a DROP OF BLOOD from his bullet wound has
text: trickled down his arm and landed on the beige carpet.
text: Bastian walks over and sniffs it curiously. PLOP. Another
text: drop lands on the dog’s fluffy white fur.
text: BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM Annie is staring at the Jenga tower.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (stalling)
dialog: So many possible moves...
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Come on, Annie. Make up your mind.
text: Jillian elbows him in the ribs. He realizes.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh. Right. Take your time.
text: Gary looks at them, nonplussed.
text: BACK IN THE STUDY. By now BASTIAN’S COAT IS SPATTERED WITH
text: BLOOD but Max has yet to notice. He writes down Anderton’s
text: address on a pad, starts to shut the laptop but reconsiders.
text: He types “The Bulgarian” into the alias search window. A
text: blurry photo of a burly man appears. “Real Name: Unknown.
dialog: 74.
dialog: Address: Unknown.” There’s an extensive list ot suspected
dialog: crimes: multiple murders, torture, kidnapping, human
dialog: trafficking, arms trafficking, etc.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Oh, Brooks. What did you get
dialog: yourself into...?
text: He closes the window and shuts the computer and heads for the
text: door. He notices his arm is leaking blood, then sees A TRAIL
text: OF BLOOD DROPS leading across the carpet to Bastian who is
text: now more red than white.
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit!
text: He shuts the door, then hurries back to the dog and tries
text: rubbing off the blood with his hand, but it only smears it.
text: He looks around and spots what looks like a rolled up rag on
text: a shelf. He hastily begins rubbing the dog with the rag but
dialog: it has little effect.
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my god.
text: He spits on the dog’s back and rubs it some more. Not
dialog: helping.
text: He sees a bottle of water on the desk. As he moves to grab
text: it, he accidentally knocks over a ceramic wedding cake
text: topper. The bride’s head breaks off.
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: No!
text: BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM the others hear Max cry out.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (standing)
dialog: Maybe I should check on Max.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I’m sure he’s fine.
speaker_heading: GARY
text: He cried out.
text: He moves to go. The others looks at each other desperately.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: (blurting)
dialog: Tell me about Debbie!
text: Gary stops, facing away from them.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: I never got to meet her. I'd love
dialog: to hear what she’s like.
text: Gary sits back down, looking wistful.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Where do I begin?
text: BACK IN THE STUDY. Max is pouring water onto Bastian and
text: scrubbing him with the rag. Fresh blood continues to seep
text: out onto the dog, making him even messier.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: This is not working...
text: He unrolls the rag and reacts as he sees it’s not a rag but a
text: SOUVENIR T-SHIRT with a photo showing a smiling Debbie on a
text: beach on vacation. The image is smeared with blood.
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Of course.
text: Just then, the wet dog SHAKES HIMSELF OFF vigorously. BLOODY
text: WATER FLIES EVERYWHERE, spattering the walls of the room
text: including the enormous wedding photo.
text: Gary’s shrine to Debbie now looks more like the scene of a
text: murder. Max stands and takes it in.
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Fuck this.
text: He wraps the shirt around his arm, covers it with his jacket,
text: then leaves the room, closing the door on the fluffy, pink
text: dog and the blood-spattered room.
scene_heading: INT. GARY'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Gary regales the group with memories.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: ...-when she laughed it was like a
dialog: concerto and if you were there to
dialog: hear it, you considered yourself
dialog: lucky just to be in the audience.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: (sotto, to Kevin)
dialog: I don’t remember her laugh being
dialog: that great.
dialog: 76.
text: Max enters.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: We should go.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: What? But you haven’t taken your
text: turn at the Jenga tower.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Right.
text: He reaches down and deliberately knocks over the tower.
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Darn it. Let’s go. Thank you,
dialog: Gary. This was great.
text: The others quickly stand, ad lib goodbyes and head out.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: When shall we play next?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: We’ll call you.
text: And they’re gone. Gary stands there for a moment. Then,
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Bastian?
scene_heading: INT. KEVIN AND MICHELLE’S VAN - NIGHT
text: Kevin drives the group in his Honda Odyssey.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: So what do we do when we get to
dialog: Peter Anderton’s house? Knock on
dialog: his door and ask for his million
dialog: dollar egg back?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I don’t know. Maybe if I explain
dialog: the situation he’ll want to help.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Oh, yeah, most criminal
dialog: millionaires have hearts of gold.
text: SFX: Max's recharged cell phone rings.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Private number. Please don’t be
dialog: Gary...
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: DISTORTED MALE VOICE (ON SPEAKER)
dialog: We have your brother.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Oh my god. Okay, listen. We know
dialog: who has the egg. We’re on our way
dialog: there right now. We can do a
dialog: trade. Please don’t hurt Brooks.
text: There’s a long pause on the line.
scene_heading: DISTORTED MALE VOICE (ON PHONE)
dialog: Meet us on the East 4th Street
dialog: Bridge at midnight. If you’re late
text: he dies.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That’s only an hour from now--
text: But the caller hangs up.
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Those guys aren’t fucking around.
dialog: Dude sounded like Kylo Ren.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: We're here.
text: The van pulls up to what appears to be a large gated estate
text: surrounded by a tall hedge. Max starts to get out.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You guys head back to the house.
dialog: I’1l call you as soon as I have the
dialog: egg.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What are you talking about? We’re
dialog: coming with you.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No way. It could be really
dialog: dangerous in there. Brooks
dialog: shouldn’t have dragged any of us
dialog: into his mess. But he’s my brother
dialog: and it’s up to me to fix this.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Bullshit. We’re all in this
dialog: together.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: You know we'd do anything for you.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No. Max is right. You guys should
dialog: go home. This is our problem.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: And what happens if you don’t make
dialog: it out?
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Do you have any idea what game
dialog: night means to us? We don’t come
dialog: over because we’re dying to play
dialog: charades and stupid ass children’s
dialog: shit. We come over because we love
dialog: you guys.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: It’s the best part of our week.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Mine too. And I’ve got a lot of
dialog: options on the weekend.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Brooks may be your brother. But
dialog: we're all family here.
text: Max and Annie are visibly touched.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: We love you guys too.
text: There’s a nice beat, then they all realize Jillian is there.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You should totally go home, though.
dialog: You don’t even know us.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: You're right. I don’t. But if you
dialog: guys are cool with it, I’d like to
dialog: stay.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: This has been the most exciting
dialog: night of my life.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Most Friday nights I eat a Chipotle
dialog: bowl by myself and watch “Orange is
text: the New Black” on my iPad.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: That’s exactly what I imagined.
text: She elbows him.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You've got an open invitation to
dialog: all future game nights, Jillian.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: As long as we don’t die tonight.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Speaking of which, how are we gonna
dialog: get into this place?
text: Just then, a car pulls up to the intercom and the gate opens.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Go, go, go!
text: Kevin drives in behind the other car.
scene_heading: EXT. ANDERTON HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Kevin’s van pulls up to where a couple dozen expensive cars
text: are parked in the driveway. The house is lit up and shouting
text: can be heard from inside. The group steps out of the van.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: Looks like they’re having a party.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That could be good. We can get in
dialog: there and look for the egg without
dialog: anyone noticing us.
text: They approach the house and peek in a window. Inside they
text: see A SCULPTURE OF A SHARK SUBMERGED IN FORMALDEHYDE along
text: with recognizable modern paintings on the walls.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Damn. Warhol, Rothko, Damien
dialog: Hirst. This guy’s gotta have the
dialog: egg.
text: They peer into the kitchen where we see a chef handing trays
text: of hors d’oeuvres to several CATERERS.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: So what’s the plan? We knock out
dialog: six of those caterers, drag them
text: into a closet and come out wearing
dialog: their clothes?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You gonna knock out six innocent
dialog: people and strip them naked?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: You got a better plan?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah. We wear our own clothes and
dialog: look for the fucking egg. Now come
dialog: on.
scene_heading: INT. ANDERTON FOYER - NIGHT
text: The group enter to find a crowd of well-dressed MEN and a
text: handful of WOMEN in their 40’s and 50’s huddled around
text: something we can’t see. They’re cheering and throwing down
text: hundred dollar bills. Attractive COCKTAIL WAITRESSES serve
dialog: drinks.
text: Our guys stick out from the crowd, but no one seems to
dialog: notice.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What is this?
text: They see an opening in the crowd and react: in the center TWO
text: BARE-KNUCKLED WHITE MEN in their 30’s are pummeling the shit
text: out of each other.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: It’s some kind of rich guys’ fight
dialog: club.
text: They all turn to Ryan who gasps.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I knew it! I told you they were
dialog: real!
text: Just then, one of the two combatants, BOOMER, KNOCKS THE
text: OTHER ONE UNCONSCIOUS. A distinguished 40-something man,
text: MR. ANDERTON, lets out a celebratory shout as he holds up
text: Boomer’s hand.
scene_heading: MR. ANDERTON
dialog: That’s my Boomer!
dialog: 81.
text: He plants a kiss on Boomer’s sweaty, bald head, then slaps
text: him on the back like a racehorse.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: This is some Django Unchained
dialog: bullshit.
text: Anderton mocks one of his guests, WARREN.
scene_heading: MR. ANDERTON
dialog: Sorry, Warren. Don’t think you’re
dialog: gonna be able to amortize that
dialog: loss.
text: Several of the guests laugh and jeer Warren. Anderton holds
text: up a water bottle that Boomer suckles from.
speaker_heading: MR. ANDERTON (CONT'D)
dialog: Kramer! Get Logan ready. Minimum
dialog: buy-in is now ten grand.
text: Another rich guy leads his muscly fighter, LOGAN, into the
dialog: “ring.”
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Rich people are fucked up, huh?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: All right, let’s split up. Anyone
text: finds the egg, text the others.
dialog: And for god’s sake be careful with
dialog: it. It’s the only chance Brooks
dialog: has.
text: Max and Annie, Kevin and Michelle head off. Jillian goes to
text: leave but notices Ryan is moving closer to the fight which
text: has just begun.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I’ve got a good feeling about
dialog: Logan. Do you have ten grand on
dialog: you?
scene_heading: INT. ANDERTON MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Kevin and Michelle stealthily enter a lavish bedroom and
text: begin looking around.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Wow. This is the biggest bedroom
dialog: I’ve ever seen.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Bigger than your celebrity
dialog: boyfriend's?
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: You're still on this?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: You gotta tell me who he was,
dialog: Michelle. It’s all I can think
dialog: about. And that’s saying something
dialog: considering there’s a fight club
dialog: downstairs.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Why does it matter so much?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: We’ve been together our whole
dialog: lives. And I thought I knew
dialog: everything about you. Now I find
dialog: out there’s this huge secret you’ve
dialog: been keeping from me. I’m not mad
dialog: that you slept with someone while
dialog: we were on a break. I’m sad that
dialog: you felt you had to keep it from
dialog: me.
text: Michelle stares at him for a beat. Finally,
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Glenn Close.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: The celebrity I slept with. It was
dialog: Glenn Close.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Get the fuck out of town.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: I was a waitress at the premiere
dialog: party of “102 Dalmations.” I was
dialog: about to start freshman year at
dialog: William and Mary and it turned out
dialog: Glenn went there too. We started
dialog: talking and we ended up back at her
dialog: house. We were both a little drunk
dialog: and one thing led to another.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: It was just that one time?
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: I haven’t seen or spoken to her
dialog: since.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I always knew you and I weren’t
dialog: gonna be apart for long and I
dialog: wanted to do something crazy while
dialog: I had the chance.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: So you made love to Cruella
dialog: DeVille.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Are you upset?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: No, baby. I’m glad you got it out
dialog: of your system. And by the way,
dialog: well done. Glenn Close is a
dialog: national treasure. I wish you had
dialog: told me years ago.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: I didn’t think you'd take it this
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Now, if you’d told me it was Denzel
dialog: I would've killed myself.
scene_heading: INT. ANDERTON LIBRARY - NIGHT
text: Max and Annie search through a beautiful wood and leather
text: library. She notices photos on the shelves showing Anderton
text: with a TROPHY WIFE and FIVE KIDS.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: How can this monster have five kids
dialog: and we can’t even make one?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Well, his wife looks like she’s
dialog: about fifteen.
dialog: (then, distracted)
dialog: Don’t worry. We’ll get there.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I’m starting to feel like I’m
dialog: pushing this baby thing on you.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No. It’s just-- when we first met
dialog: we did whatever we wanted.
dialog: Whenever we wanted.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: And then we got real jobs and a
dialog: mortgage and car loans and now we
dialog: only have one night of the week
dialog: where we get to let loose and have
dialog: fun. Game night. And once we have
dialog: a kid, we won’t even have that
dialog: anymore.
text: Annie suddenly realizes something.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You weren’t stressed because your
dialog: brother was coming to town. You’re
dialog: stressed because you didn’t want to
dialog: have a kid in the first place.
dialog: Your sperm doesn’t work because
dialog: you're afraid your sperm might
dialog: work.
text: Max looks away. He knows she’s right.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: How about we put a pin in this
dialog: until my brother is safe?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah. Sure.
text: Off Annie’s sad look,
scene_heading: INT. ANDERTON LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Ryan watches raptly as Logan and Boomer beat the hell out of
text: each other. Jillian is losing patience.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Come on, Logan! Boomer ain’t shit!
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Can we go? We’re supposed to be
dialog: looking for the--
text: Suddenly, she notices one of Anderton’s EMPLOYEES banding
text: together a stack of bills he’s taken from a money counter.
text: He places the cash in a wall safe but does not shut it. Just
text: beside the stacked cash Jillian spots A BEJEWELED, ORNATELY
scene_heading: DECORATED FABERGE EGG.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoa.
dialog: (she pokes Ryan)
dialog: Look. It’s right there!
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Holy shit. Good eyes. Stay here.
dialog: 85.
dialog: He heads ott.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I’m gonna grab it. They’re all
text: watching the fight.
text: He casually weaves through the crowd of shouting men to the
text: open wall safe. He glances around. No one has noticed him.
text: He grabs the egg.
text: Just then, POW! Boomer delivers a crippling blow to Logan,
text: knocking him out. The crowd roars. Boomer looks up and
text: stares quizzically at Ryan. Everyone else follows his gaze.
text: The room goes silent. All eyes are on Ryan.
scene_heading: MR. ANDERTON
dialog: Who the hell are you?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Hm?
scene_heading: MR. ANDERTON
dialog: What are you doing with my egg?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (adopting a fake air of
dialog: haughtiness)
dialog: I was... simply admiring it. It’s
dialog: a fine specimen. I have dozens of
dialog: such eggs in my collection. I’ma
dialog: bit of a connoisseur if you will.
scene_heading: MR. ANDERTON
dialog: Does anyone here know this guy?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Everyone knows me. I’m a mogul
dialog: like you gentlemen. And after a
dialog: hard day of selling stocks and
dialog: acquiring assets, I like to unwind
text: with a cognac and a good fight.
dialog: I’m a bit of a connoisseur if you
dialog: will.
text: Jillian buries her head in her hands.
scene_heading: MR. ANDERTON
dialog: You're full of shit.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: How dare ye?
dialog: 86.
scene_heading: MR. ANDERTON
dialog: (to Boomer)
dialog: Take this guy down, please.
text: Boomer shoves through the crowd toward Ryan who bolts with
dialog: the egg.
scene_heading: INT. ANDERTON HOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS
text: Max and Annie rejoin Kevin and Michelle.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Any luck?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Yeah! We actually worked out our
dialog: issue.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I’m talking about the egg!
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Oh, no. Nothing.
text: Suddenly, Ryan and Jillian CHARGE PAST THEM. Ryan holds the
text: egg and looks terrified.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Go, go, go!
text: Boomer rushes in hot on Ryan’s tail. The others scramble.
text: Ryan stumbles and DROPS the egg. It is caught just in time
text: by Annie who laterals it to Michelle. Boomer pursues whoever
text: holds the egg and it turns into a_high-stakes game of “hot
dialog: potato.”
text: Finally, Jillian finds herself holding the egg with no one to
text: pass it to. She stands like a deer in headlights as Boomer
text: charges straight for her.
text: At the last possible second, the fighter is TACKLED FROM THE
text: SIDE BY RYAN who has instinctively leapt to Jillian's aid.
text: The two men CRASH into the Damien Hirst shark artwork. The
text: GLASS PANEL SHATTERS AND GALLONS OF FORMALDEHYDE POUR OUT
text: ALONG WITH THE PRESERVED SHARK CARCASS.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh god!
text: Boomer is dazed. Ryan clambers to his feet, stumbling over
text: the rubbery fish corpse and the group races out of the house.
dialog: 87.
scene_heading: EXT. ANDERTON ESTATE - NIGHT
text: Max and the others run toward Kevin's minivan. Anderton and
text: his guests pour out the door in pursuit. A soaking wet
text: Boomer leads the charge as our group piles into the Odyssey.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Come on! Get in!
text: He floors it and they speed down the driveway and out to the
dialog: street.
scene_heading: INT. KEVIN’S CAR - NIGHT
text: Everyone catches their breath as Kevin speeds along. Max
text: holds the egg.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, that was unusual.
text: Jillian turns to Ryan who looks dazed.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: You really saved me back there.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yeah. Why did I do that? It’s
dialog: like I saw you were in trouble and
dialog: this feeling came over me. Like I
dialog: wanted to help you even if I didn’t
dialog: get anything out of it.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Sounds like love, Ryan.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: What? Ew. No, it doesn’t.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Yeah. Gross, Annie.
text: But as they blow off the moment, we can see both Ryan and
text: Jillian are in uncharted territory.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (tense)
dialog: Two minutes to twelve. Where’s
dialog: this bridge?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: GPS says it’s right around here but
dialog: I don’t see it.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (points)
dialog: There it is! 4th Street.
dialog: 88.
text: Seeing they’re passing the bridge, Kevin SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.
text: In SUPER-SLOW MOTION, we see the egg fly out of Max’s hands.
speaker_heading: MAX
text: Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucccecckkkkkkk!
text: The egg passes between the front seats and SHATTERS AGAINST
text: THE FRONT WINDSHIELD. Jewels and enamel fly all over the
text: dashboard. After a beat,
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Oh my.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That’s it. They’re gonna kill my
dialog: brother.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Hang on. Maybe we can fix this...
text: Ryan picks up a few shards of egg and tries piecing them
text: together but they fall apart in his hands.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: This is more fragile than a real
dialog: egg.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Did they specifically say it had to
dialog: be in one piece?
text: Michelle examines some of the tiny gems on the dashboard.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: I’m not an expert, but these gems
dialog: look kinda plastic to me.
text: Max leans forward and examines some of the pieces. Inside
text: one he notices a small sticker.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (reading)
dialog: “Made in China”? Is this thing not
dialog: even real?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Maybe just that sticker was made in
dialog: China.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Let’s let them talk.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Why would the Bulgarian ask Brooks
dialog: to get him a fake egg?
dialog: 89.
text: Annie notices something amidst the shattered egg. A TINY
text: ROLLED UP PAPER. She picks it up and examines it.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I don’t think he wanted the egg at
dialog: all. I think he wanted what was
text: inside of it.
text: INSERT on the roll of paper. It’s a list of names and
text: addresses in tiny type. At the top is a header: “WITSEC.”
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: “WITSEC"? What is that?
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: We can ask them.
text: She points to the opposite end of the bridge where we can see
text: a black van coming to a stop. Ponytail and Bald Guy step
text: out, open the rear door and drag out a frightened Brooks.
text: Our group steels themselves as they climb out of the minivan.
text: Ryan scoops the shattered egg pieces into a travel mug.
text: Jillian looks at him.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: In case they ask for it.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Max, Annie and the others move nervously to where the thugs
text: stand in the middle of the bridge holding guns on Brooks.
speaker_heading: BALD GUY
dialog: You tell anyone you were coming
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No. I swear. Listen, we've got
dialog: your egg--
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: You do?!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: But we broke it.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: What?!
text: Ryan shakes the travel mug helpfully.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It was a fake. But we have the
dialog: list of names inside.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (holding it up)
dialog: That’s what you wanted, right?
text: The thugs exchange a look.
speaker_heading: PONYTAIL
dialog: Get on the ground.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: We have what you want. Why can’t
dialog: you just let us go?
text: Ponytail shoves his gun in Max's face.
speaker_heading: PONYTAIL
dialog: I said “on the ground”!
text: They all lie down on their stomachs. Brooks lies beside Max.
text: Ponytail begins moving down the line, collecting wallets and
text: cell phones. Bald Guy takes out his own phone and dials.
speaker_heading: BALD GUY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: It’s me. We’ve got ‘em all here.
text: As Bald Guy walks off to talk, Brooks turns to Max.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: The Bulgarian’s gonna kill me.
dialog: Probably you guys too. Why did you
dialog: come back?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You're my brother. I can’t just
dialog: let you die. Even if you deserve
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: You're unbelievable. You were
dialog: always a better person than me.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Please shut up.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: I’m being serious.
text: Max rolls his eyes.
speaker_heading: BROOKS (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, I haven’t been totally honest
dialog: with you.
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah, Brooks, I know. That’s why
text: we're lying on a bridge at
dialog: midnight.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: I don’t mean about this. I mean
dialog: about everything. I’m not the guy
dialog: you think I am. I’m not even the
dialog: guy you think I think I am.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: I’m a fraud. Everyone sees me as
dialog: this cool, carefree dude who wins
dialog: at everything he touches. Well,
dialog: you know how I win? I cheat, Max.
dialog: I cheat at everything. Even when
dialog: we were little kids and we would
dialog: play Battleship.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Didn’t you notice how I always made
dialog: you sit with your back to the TV?
dialog: It was so I could see where your
text: ships were in the reflection. And
dialog: I always pocketed five grand in
dialog: Monopoly before we even started
dialog: playing. I cheated at the Game of
dialog: Life. And the game of life.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Son of a bitch.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: But it didn’t stop there. We grew
dialog: up and you went to college and met
dialog: Annie and became a writer. I knew
dialog: I couldn't compete with your
dialog: success. So I told everyone I got
dialog: a job on Wall Street. And I did.
text: Selling coke to the traders.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You never were a venture
dialog: capitalist?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: I’m not even sure what “venture
dialog: capitalist” means.
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: So this whole time that I’ve felt
dialog: like a complete failure next to
dialog: you, you've felt the same way about
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Kinda funny, huh?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No! It’s not funny! It’s shitty!
dialog: You turned me into a self-doubting,
dialog: competitive mess! You even broke
dialog: my sperm!
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Okay, I’m not sure what that last
dialog: thing means, but listen. I’ve been
dialog: trying to find a way to make it up
dialog: to you. That’s what this whole
dialog: game night was supposed to be. I
dialog: rigged it so you would finally win.
dialog: The last clue was gonna lead you to
dialog: your jacket pocket.
text: Puzzled, Max reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out the
text: key to Brooks’ Stingray.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Whoa.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Surprise. But I even fucked that
dialog: up. I’m so sorry, man.
text: He puts his forehead on the asphalt, defeated. Max puts a
text: hand on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You know what? We’re gonna be
dialog: okay. I can feel it.
text: ANGLE ON Bald Guy finishing his call.
speaker_heading: BALD GUY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: .--all of them? You sure that’s
dialog: necessary?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Okay.
text: He hangs up and turns to Ponytail.
speaker_heading: PONYTAIL
dialog: What’d he say?
dialog: They cock
dialog: Panicked,
text: They kiss.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: BALD GUY
dialog: We gotta take ‘em all out.
text: their guns. Our group all react, terrified.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: (to the thugs)
dialog: Wait! We got you the list!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Just let us go. No one needs to
dialog: know!
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: (to Kevin)
dialog: I’m sorry I fucked Glenn Close.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: I’m sorry I fucked Karen Waller.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: You said it was a handjob!
text: Ryan turns to Jillian.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (rapid-fire)
dialog: I know you’re too smart for me and
dialog: you could do way better, but I
dialog: really like you and I might love
dialog: you! Do you love me?!
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: No, I don’t think so, but if you
dialog: want to kiss I’d be okay with that.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Fair enough!
dialog: Then,
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: You smell like a preserved shark.
text: Ponytail and Bald Guy point their guns. They’re about to
text: fire when-- WOOOP! The chirp of a POLICE CAR SIREN startles
dialog: everyone.
dialog: They turn
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Freeze!
text: to see-- GARY STEPPING OUT OF HIS COP CAR LIKE A
text: HERO. His weapon is drawn.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Gary?!
dialog: 94.
text: Bald Guy and Ponytail turn their guns on Gary.
speaker_heading: BALD GUY
dialog: Don’t even think about it, pig!
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Can't say I care for that
dialog: nomenclature.
text: Gary FIRES his gun at them. Bald Guy and Ponytail dive for
text: cover, returning fire. It’s real and loud and scary.
text: Everybody scatters, screaming. Ryan covers Jillian. Max
text: falls on top of Annie. Michelle falls on top of Kevin.
text: Gary slides across his car’s hood like John McClane, firing
text: at the thugs. Ponytail gets hit in the gut, his shirt
text: EXPLODING with red.
text: Gary aims and fires. Bald Guy ducks too late and gets hit in
text: the back, dropping like a sack. A beat of quiet.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Is that your neighbor?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (shaken)
dialog: Yes it is.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Is everybody okay?!
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: When did Gary get so cool?!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Gary?! You all right?
text: Gary emerges from cover.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I’m fine.
dialog: (looking back)
text: Though in sliding, my belt buckle
dialog: may have scratched the finish of my
text: squad car.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: How did you know we were in
dialog: trouble?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: The nocturnal Jenga game, my blood-
text: spattered marital souvenirs and
text: Max's curious search history piqued
dialog: my interest.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You saved our lives.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Just doing my jo--
text: BANG! Gary's chest explodes in an eruption of BLOOD. He
text: falls to the ground in a heap.
text: We see that Ponytail has fired one last shot before dying.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Oh my god!
text: Annie tries putting pressure on the wound. Max pulls Gary
text: into his lap as Jillian calls 911--
speaker_heading: JILLIAN (ON PHONE)
dialog: I need an ambulance, there’s an
dialog: officer down....
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Gary! Hold on!
text: Gary looks down at his chest.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Oh no...
text: Ryan dry heaves.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: You’re gonna be fine, Gary! Just
dialog: hang on!
text: Gary coughs and a little blood comes out of his mouth. His
text: eyelids get heavier.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Hang on, Gare. We’re gonna get you
dialog: to the hospital!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You've got so much to live for!
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (weak)
dialog: Do I? I have no wife. No friends.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: We're your friends, pal.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: We all love you.
text: Ryan looks at Kevin. He shrugs.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: You don’t... even like spending
dialog: time... with me.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (choked up)
dialog: Not true. We've just been selfish.
dialog: We didn’t think about you and what
dialog: you needed. I’m so sorry.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Someone please care for Bastian.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You're gonna care for him yourself.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah. And when you get out of the
dialog: hospital you’re coming to every
dialog: game night we have. You hear me?!
dialog: That’s a promise!
text: Annie takes his hand, trying not to cry--
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Would you like that, Gary? Would
dialog: you like to come back to game
dialog: night? You've just gotta keep
dialog: breathing.
text: A very weakened Gary tries to smile. He leans up like he
text: wants to say something, but he’s too weak. Max and Annie
dialog: lean down close...
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Don’t you EVER exclude me again.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What?
text: A beat. Then Gary SPITS OUT what looks to be a plastic
text: packet from his mouth.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What’s that? What was that?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: And that is how you do a murder
dialog: mystery party.
dialog: 
text: Gary gets to his feet, grinning. Kevin SCREAMS when she sees
text: Bald Guy and Ponytail stand up, very much still alive,
text: brushing themselves off.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: What the hell is going on?!
text: Gary nods.
text: head off.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I’ve duped you all.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: This was all... a game?
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: (furious)
dialog: A game?!
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: When I learned that you stopped
dialog: inviting me to your game nights, I
dialog: hijacked Brooks’ murder mystery
dialog: party and staged a kidnapping of my
dialog: own.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Okay, y’know what? False alarm.
text: Officer not down. He’s back up.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: What better way to prove my worth
dialog: as a game night participant?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: (points to Bald Guy and
dialog: Ponytail)
dialog: So who are those guys? Actors?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Oh, no, they’re felons. I was able
dialog: to shave some time off their parole
dialog: in exchange for this little side
dialog: project.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Thank you, gentlemen.
speaker_heading: BALD GUY
dialog: We square now?
text: Ponytail and Bald Guy collect their props and
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: (to Gary)
dialog: What kind of psycho are you?! You
dialog: put us through all this shit for
dialog: your own amusement?!
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Just the opposite. For your
dialog: amusement. Did everyone have fun?
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No, Gary. Nobody had fun. And I
dialog: got shot with a real bullet!
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I don’t see how that’s possible.
dialog: My men were using blanks.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: That was my gun. Which was real.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (to Gary)
dialog: So, the whole thing with the
text: Fabergé egg and the Bulgarian.
dialog: That was you?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: You’ve lost me.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: The egg with the WITSEC list
dialog: inside.
text: Max shows him the paper.
speaker_heading: GARY
speaker_heading: WITSEC?
dialog: (reading)
dialog: This is a list of people in the
dialog: federal witness protection program.
dialog: How did you get this?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It was in the egg! Can you please
dialog: stop fucking with us now?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I’m not fudging with you. I
dialog: honestly don’t know what--
text: BANG! Gary is hit in the shoulder by a bullet. Blood spurts
text: out. Gary falls to the ground.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Seriously? How stupid do you think
dialog: we are?
text: Brooks spots a BURLY MAN with two armed BODYGUARDS
text: approaching from the other end of the bridge.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Max?
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (to Gary)
dialog: That’s your big twist? You get
dialog: shot again? And by who?
dialog: Completely new characters you just
dialog: introduce at the last minute? I’m
dialog: sorry. You jumped the shark, bud.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: No, Max...
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: And you don’t do a shot in the
dialog: shoulder after you did a shot in
text: the chest. That’s anti-climactic.
text: He sticks his finger into Gary’s bullet hole. Gary SCREAMS
text: in pain. Max pulls out his finger.
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Hang on...
text: Gary reaches for his shoulder walkie.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (pained)
dialog: This is Officer Henson. I’ve got a
dialog: ten-double-zero on the 4th Street--
text: One of the Bodyguards suddenly KICKS GARY IN THE HEAD,
text: knocking him unconscious. It’s clear this is not staged.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Jesus!
text: The Bodyguard picks up the gun Gary dropped and hands it to
text: his boss, THE BULGARIAN.
speaker_heading: THE BULGARIAN
dialog: Which one of you is Brooks Davis?
text: Brooks nervously holds up his hand.
speaker_heading: THE BULGARIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Funny. You don’t look like an
dialog: asshole. Do I look like an asshole
dialog: to you?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: THE BULGARIAN
dialog: One of us has to be the asshole in
dialog: this transaction because otherwise
dialog: I'd have my egg and you’d have your
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: THE BULGARIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: But instead, we’ve wasted our night
dialog: tracking you down. We find Marlon
dialog: Freeman. He tells us some idiots
text: in a minivan stole the egg. Now
dialog: we've shot and kicked this
dialog: perfectly innocent policeman, and
dialog: now we’re gonna have to kill you.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Excuse me, Mr. Bulgarian? If I
dialog: may. I’m Brooks’ brother. He
dialog: screwed up. He got greedy. He
dialog: knows that. But the good news is,
dialog: we got your egg back. Granted,
dialog: it’s broken. But we got the list
dialog: inside. And I bet that’s what you
dialog: wanted all along. So how about
dialog: this? You take the list. For
dialog: free. We all go our separate ways
dialog: and nobody gets hurt.
dialog: (then, grim)
dialog: Except for the people on that list,
dialog: I’m guessing.
text: Max holds up the list.
speaker_heading: THE BULGARIAN
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: THE BULGARIAN
dialog: Deal. Makes perfect sense.
text: Max moves to hand the list over but Brooks stops him.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Wait. You give him that he’s gonna
dialog: kill me.
speaker_heading: THE BULGARIAN
dialog: Nonsense.
dialog: (then, dead serious)
dialog: Give me the list.
text: Max hesitates. The Bulgarian nods to his guys who aim their
text: guns at Brooks and Max. In an instant, Brooks grabs the list
text: from Max, shoves it in his mouth and swallows it.
speaker_heading: THE BULGARIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell is wrong with you?!
text: SFX: a distant SIREN WAILS as it comes closer
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Just buying myself some time.
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: THE BULGARIAN
dialog: Not much. We’re just gonna cut you
text: open on the jet.
dialog: (to Bodyguards)
dialog: Take him.
text: One Bodyguard grabs Brooks. The other points to the group.
speaker_heading: BODYGUARD
dialog: What about them?
speaker_heading: THE BULGARIAN
dialog: Fuck ‘em. We’1ll be out of the
dialog: country in an hour.
text: They back up towards their car, one gun on Brooks, one gun on
text: the rest of them. Max watches helplessly.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Don't follow me, Max. I’m serious.
speaker_heading: THE BULGARIAN
dialog: I’m not worried about that.
text: He takes out a gun. Max flinches. The Bulgarian SHOOTS OUT
text: two tires on Kevin’s minivan. Max’s face hardens as he
text: watches the car drive away.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Man. This game just gets weirder
dialog: and weirder.
text: Everyone looks at Ryan.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: You know it stopped being a game,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (covering)
dialog: Duh.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: The only private air terminal
dialog: around here is at LAX.
text: Max starts to head off.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You gonna run there?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: We’re only four blocks from Brooks’
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: But our car’s not there.
dialog: 102.
text: Max holds up the key to the Stingray.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yes, it is.
text: He runs off. Annie sighs and follows.
scene_heading: EXT. PRIVATE AIR HANGAR - NIGHT
text: One of the Bodyguards shuts the door of a Cessna private jet
text: as it begins to taxi toward the runway.
scene_heading: INT. JET - CONTINUOUS
text: He joins the other Bodyguard who is zip-tying Brooks’ hands
text: to the arm of a seat. The Bulgarian looms over him.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: (struggling)
dialog: Look, you don’t have to do this.
dialog: Just let me poop it out.
speaker_heading: THE BULGARIAN
dialog: We’re not going to go digging
dialog: around in your feces. We’re
text: civilized men.
text: He takes out a LARGE KNIFE from a drawer.
speaker_heading: THE BULGARIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Now hold still while I cut your
text: stomach open.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Wait! 1I’11 do whatever you need me
dialog: to do!
text: He is about to cut when Brooks notices something outside.
speaker_heading: BROOKS (CONT'D)
dialog: The hell?
text: The Bulgarian looks out and sees a CORVETTE STINGRAY SMASHING
text: through the chain-link fence along the runway and speeding
text: right toward the taxiing jet.
speaker_heading: THE BULGARIAN
dialog: Is that...?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: (proud)
dialog: My little brother. He doesn’t know
dialog: when to quit.
text: The Bulgarian turns to the cockpit and barks at the PILOTS.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: THE BULGARIAN
dialog: Get us in the air! Now!
scene_heading: INT. STINGRAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Frazzled, Max and Annie chase the jet down the runway.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What’s our plan?!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: The plan was to break through the
dialog: fence! Now, I’ve got nothing!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: They’re about to take off!
text: Max steels himself and pours on more speed.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: All right. I’ve got an idea that’s
dialog: crazy enough it just might work.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You're gonna crash the car into the
dialog: plane?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah. How’d you know?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: ‘Cause it’s the only option!
scene_heading: EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: The jet is nearly lifting off the ground as the Stingray
text: pulls up alongside. Max turns the wheel hard to the left and
text: RAMS into the side of the plane.
text: The jet VEERS OFF COURSE, barreling toward the edge of the
text: runway. It speeds over the berm and slams to a stop ina
dialog: ditch.
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS
text: The PILOTS are thrown against the controls and knocked
text: unconscious.
scene_heading: INT. JET - CONTINUOUS
text: The Bodyguards, the Bulgarian and Brooks are slammed against
text: the cabin walls.
dialog: 104.
scene_heading: EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: The totaled car spins out, coming to a halt on the runway.
scene_heading: INT. KEVIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Max and Annie take a breath.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Well, at least I got to drive it
dialog: for ten minutes.
text: Annie sees the door of the jet open as one of the armed
text: Bodyguards steps out.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Quick. Come on!
scene_heading: EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT
text: She jumps out of the car and heads across the tarmac away
text: from the approaching Bodyguard.
text: Max moves to follow but the Bodyguard is already looking in
text: his direction. Max ducks behind the Stingray just in time.
text: The Bodyguard peers inside the car then heads right toward
text: where Max is hiding.
text: Just as he’s about to find Max, Annie stumbles and makes a
text: noise. The Bodyguard turns toward the sound as Annie ducks
text: for cover behind a baggage conveyor belt loader parked
text: alongside the tarmac.
text: The Bodyguard toward her. Annie hides on the other side of
text: the loader as the Bodyguard looks for her. She and Max lock
text: eyes from their hiding places.
text: Frantic to help her, Max suddenly notices a LARGE CRATE
text: perched at the top of the elevated conveyor belt directly
text: above the Bodyguard.
text: Max points at the crate and silently mouths “turn on the
text: belt.” She doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
text: He takes out his cell phone to text her: No service.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Shit.
text: He gets an idea. He begins to CHARADE to her. He holds up
text: three fingers. It takes a second but Annie gets it.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (to herself)
text: Three words.
dialog: 105.
text: Max does the tirst word. He spins in a circle.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Spin. Turn.
text: Yes. Second word: he puts one hand on top of the other.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: On. Turn on what?
text: Max points to his belt.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Belt. Turn on belt.
text: She catches on. She sneaks around to the control panel of
text: the loader and finds the activation switch.
text: She’s about to hit it but Max gestures for her to wait. The
text: Bodyguard circles around the loader. Annie scurries around
text: it, ducking out of his view.
text: Finally, the Bodyguard returns to the spot beneath the crate.
text: Max signals. Annie turns on the conveyor...
text: ..-which starts up with a DEAFENING GROWL of its gas engine.
text: The conveyor CREEPS UP SUPER-SLOWLY giving the Bodyguard
text: ample time to see the crate and step out of the way as it
text: smashes harmlessly to the ground. Max throws up his hands.
text: But while the Bodyguard is distracted, he is BONKED in the
text: head by Annie wielding a fire extinguisher she removed from
text: the loader. He goes down hard.
text: Annie grabs the Bodyguard’s gun and runs to join Max.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You saw what I was going for there?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Of course. If that guy had been
dialog: deaf and paralyzed it totally
dialog: would’ve worked.
dialog: (re: the gun)
dialog: You want this?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I know I don’t want you to have it,
dialog: Calamity Jane.
text: He takes the gun and they sneak over toward the jet.
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Look. There’s a hatch on top of
dialog: the plane! Maybe I can get the
dialog: drop on them.
dialog: 106.
text: Max puts the gun over his shoulder and caretully begins
text: climbing up onto the wing.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: “The drop”?!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Get to the hangar. See if you can
dialog: find a cop or something. I’11 be
dialog: okay.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (whisper yell)
dialog: You’re not Jack Reacher!
scene_heading: INT. JET - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: THE BULGARIAN
dialog: We're sitting ducks here. Get out
dialog: there, kill those fuckers and find
dialog: me another plane!
speaker_heading: BODYGUARD #2
dialog: (re: Brooks)
dialog: You okay with him?
text: The Bulgarian picks up his knife.
speaker_heading: THE BULGARIAN
dialog: Oh, we’ll be fine.
text: As the Bodyguard hurries out of the plane, the Bulgarian
text: approaches Brooks.
speaker_heading: THE BULGARIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: No more waiting. I’m getting my
dialog: list.
text: We hear a rattling from the ceiling of the plane. The
text: Bulgarian steps aside just as Max falls through the emergency
text: hatch, missing the Bulgarian and landing on the floor.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Max!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Can’t get the drop on anyone
dialog: tonight.
text: Before the Bulgarian can react, Max aims his gun at him.
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Drop the knife.
dialog: 107.
text: But instead, the Bulgarian THROWS the knite at Max. It
text: sticks into the same arm where he was shot earlier. Max
text: drops his weapon.
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: ARGGGHH! Right in my bullet hole!
text: The Bulgarian charges Max but Brooks TRIPS him with his leg.
text: The Bulgarian falls to the floor and he and Max grapple.
scene_heading: EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: The Bodyguard searches around the plane, his gun drawn. He
text: spots Annie hiding behind the nose of the jet and FIRES. She
text: runs for cover but he has her trapped.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Wait! I have kids! Four of them!
speaker_heading: BODYGUARD #2
dialog: Bullshit. Not with that ass you
dialog: don’t.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (flattered)
dialog: Well, thank you for that.
text: He raises his gun and aims at her head.
speaker_heading: BODYGUARD #2
dialog: You’re welcome.
scene_heading: INT. JET - CONTINUOUS
text: Max and the Bulgarian continue to wrestle. They stumble into
text: the cockpit landing between the unconscious pilots directly
text: on top of the THRUST LEVER. The engine ROARS TO LIFE.
scene_heading: EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: The engine directly behind the Bodyguard suddenly REVS to
text: maximum throttle. The man turns back to look.
speaker_heading: BODYGUARD #2
dialog: What the f--?
text: WHOOSH... SPLAT! He’s SUCKED into the engine and shredded.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yes!
dialog: (then, grim)
dialog: Oh my god. That’s just horrible.
dialog: 108.
scene_heading: INT. JET - CONTINUOUS
text: The fight spills back into the cabin as the Bulgarian spots
text: the gun Max dropped on the floor. He clambers toward it.
text: Brooks sticks out his leg and TRIPS HIM AGAIN.
speaker_heading: THE BULGARIAN
dialog: Stop tripping me!
text: Max notices a BUNGEE CORD dangling from an overhead
text: compartment. He grabs it and wraps it around the Bulgarian’s
text: neck. But the Bulgarian is determined. He continues to
text: crawl to the weapon as the cord tightens around his throat.
text: Just as his hand grasps the gun, he collapses on the floor,
text: unconscious from lack of oxygen.
text: Max quickly ties him up with the bungee cord so he can’t
text: move. He cuts Brooks free with the Bulgarian’s knife.
text: The two brothers stand there as they collect themselves.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Look at that.
text: ANGLE ON the Bulgarian. Max has wrapped him so his head is
text: nearly in his own crotch.
speaker_heading: BROOKS (CONT'D)
dialog: You get a bungee cord in your hand
dialog: and you go straight to the pervy
dialog: place, don’t you?
text: Annie hurries onto the plane and hugs Max.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I’m changed
dialog: forever but I’m fine.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Is that a knife in your bullet
dialog: hole?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It’s nothing. Listen, I want us to
dialog: have a baby.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Look at us. We did things tonight
dialog: we never would’ve imagined we could
dialog: do. And we were awesome.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought I wanted to be like
text: Brooks but it turns out Brooks is a
text: low-life and a loser.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Guilty.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Plus, think of all the dum-dums
dialog: having babies out there. Ours is
dialog: going to be so much better. It/’1l
dialog: beat them at everything.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (getting into it)
dialog: Totally. Our baby’s gonna crush
dialog: every other baby!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: We’re gonna raise the Jason Bourne
dialog: of babies.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: But without all the creepy
text: Treadstone flashbacks.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Right, no. Obviously.
text: Brooks starts slow-clapping. They look at him.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: And that is how you throw a game
dialog: night.
text: Max and Annie stare.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: It went exactly as I planned.
dialog: (to the Bulgarian)
dialog: Trevor, you can get up now.
