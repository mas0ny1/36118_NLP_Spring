speaker_heading: By PHYLLIS NAGY
text: Based on the novel THE PRICE OF SALT by PATRICIA HIGHSMITH
scene_heading: EXT. NYC SUBWAY STATION. APRIL 1953. NIGHT.
text: Out of the darkness, the screeching moan of an arriving
text: train. A dark swarm of bodies file out of the LEXINGTON and
text: 59TH ST STATION. We descend upon the crowd, singling out a
text: young man in coat and hat, JACK TAFT, late 20s, who weaves
text: through the line of COMMUTERS, some opening umbrellas to the
text: patchy skies. JACK buys an evening paper at a newsstand and
text: makes his way across 59th.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. RITZ TOWER HOTEL. NIGHT.
text: JACK enters the hotel and we follow him as he walks through
text: the lobby to the bar. JACK easily finds a stool, nods to the
text: BARTENDER and tosses him the newspaper. The BARTENDER points
text: to a bottle of Dewars and JACK gives him a thumbs up. He
text: scans the cocktail lounge adjacent to the bar - not much
text: activity in there, either: a FEW TABLES OF BUSINESSMEN
text: getting drunk, an ELDERLY COUPLE, TWO WOMEN tucked away in a
text: corner table. JACK checks his watch and the BARTENDER sets
text: down his drink.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Not much going on for a Friday.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: It’s early yet.
text: JACK downs his scotch, slides his empty glass over to the
text: BARTENDER, taps out a rhythm along the edge of the bar.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Say Cal, make it a double, would
dialog: you? And one for yourself. I gotta
dialog: make a call.
text: JACK gets up.
scene_heading: INT. RITZ TOWER HOTEL. BAR/LOUNGE. NIGHT.
text: JACK makes his way through the lounge on his way to a
text: telephone booth. He takes another look at the TWO WOMEN
text: tucked away in the corner, deep in conversation, and thinks
text: he recognizes one of them. He begins approaching them.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Therese? Is that you?
text: THERESE, the younger of the women, turns to look at JACK.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you know!
dialog: (he starts over)
dialog: I'm saying to myself, I know that
dialog: girl.
text: It seems to take her a split second to react, to stand and
text: greet JACK with a short hug.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Gee it’s great to see you, Therese.
dialog: It’s been, well, months.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Months.
text: The OTHER WOMAN at the table lights a cigarette. THERESE
text: glances at her, and they hold a brief, tense look before
text: THERESE remembers her manners.
speaker_heading: THERESE (CONT’D)
dialog: Jack, this is Carol Aird.
text: JACK holds out his hand. CAROL shakes it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Pleased to meet you.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Likewise.
text: CAROL retreats back to her own thoughts, smokes.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey, Ted Gray’s meeting me here and
dialog: a bunch of us are heading down to
dialog: Phil’s party. You’re going aren’t
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Well - yes. I just planned to get
dialog: there a little...(looking to Carol)
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You should go ahead.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You coming along?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: No, no. (to THERESE) I should make
dialog: a few calls before dinner, anyway.
dialog: I should really run.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: (to JACK)
dialog: Well... it would be great to catch
dialog: a ride.
text: CAROL takes a step towards THERESE, but no more.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You two have a wonderful night.
dialog: Nice meeting you, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nice meeting you.
text: And she’s gone. THERESE doesn’t move, doesn’t turn around to
dialog: watch CAROL leave.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, well let me go make sure
text: the loaf is on his way. Back ina
dialog: flash.
text: JACK takes off. A beat before THERESE turns and scans the bar
text: and beyond for CAROL. But she’s gone.
scene_heading: INT. RITZ TOWER HOTEL. BAR/LOUNGE. MOMENTS LATER
text: JACK, through the glass of the phone-booth door, is finishing
text: his call. He emerges from the booth, passing the bar on the
text: way, where the bartender spots him, and holds up the paper.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Keep it!
text: JACK returns to where he left THERESE but stops when he
text: doesn’t see her, glancing around. He’s about to ask a WAITER
text: if he’s seen her when he spots THERESE emerging from the
text: ladies lounge. She looks pallid.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: There you are! Thought you ditched
dialog: me. You alright? He said he’d meet
dialog: us out front.
scene_heading: INT. /EXT. NYC TAXI CAB. NIGHT.
text: THERESE sits against the window in the back of a taxi,
text: crowded with JACK and OTHER 20-somethings, MALE AND FEMALE,
text: all involved in animated conversation we can’t hear. The taxi
text: stops for a light and THERESE catches sight of an ELEGANT
text: COUPLE, arm-in-arm at the corner, crossing the avenue as the
text: light changes. A strong gust of wind gives the woman some
text: difficulty as she tries to knot a green silk scarf around her
dialog: head.
text: As they reach the sidewalk, she turns back to face the
text: avenue, and then recedes, swallowed by swirling lights and
dialog: reflections.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: FLASHBACK: DECEMBER, 1952
scene_heading: BRIEF SHOTS (INT. TOY DEPARTMENT - FRANKENBERG’S)
text: A toy train whizzes by the faces of miniature pedestrians on
text: a department store display. CAROL AIRD, seen from a distance,
text: in winter coat, stands watching. She wears a green silk scarf
text: over her head, loosely tied.
text: She turns, smiles.
scene_heading: INT. THERESE’S APARTMENT. EAST 50'S. DECEMBER 1952. MORNING.
text: An alarm blares over the sleeping face of THERESE BELIVET,
text: huddled under covers. THERESE doesn’t stir though the alarm
text: continues. Finally, THERESE, in one skilled manoeuver, pushes
text: herself up and out of bed, still cocooned within the
text: blankets. She finds the alarm clock and shuts it off. She
text: looks at the alarm clock. It reads 7.00 A.M.
text: THERESE moves through her morning rituals: she throws open
text: her window shades, moves on to a small gas stove, strikes a
text: match and lights the stove to take the chill off, moves on to
text: the kitchen sink set in one corner of the room, which doubles
dialog: as a partial home darkroom - developer and fixer trays
text: stacked to the side of the sink, an Argus C3 camera from the
text: late 1930s set on a shelf above the sink, along with a
text: collection of red or amber light bulbs and photo paper.
text: The room is sparsely furnished, and much of the wall space is
text: taken up with THERESE’S B&W photos, mostly NY CITY STREET
text: SCENES and URBAN LANDSCAPES. THERESE is brushing her teeth
text: when the doorbell rings. Once. Twice. Three times. She sheds
text: her blankets and goes to the window, opens it, leans out.
scene_heading: EXT. THERESE’S APARTMENT BUILDING. CONTINUOUS.
text: THERESE’S boyfriend, RICHARD SEMCO, looks up at her from the
text: street, striding his bicycle. He’s well-bundled in scarf and
dialog: hat.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I like your scribbles.
text: RICHARD looks around to the street behind him covered in
text: children’s chalk scribblings.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Yeah - I’ve been busy! (grinning at
dialog: her): I don’t know how you look a
dialog: million bucks first thing in the
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I won't be a minute.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK. NY CITY. MORNING.
text: RICHARD rides THERESE to work through the park. She sits with
text: her arms wrapped around his hips while he stands pumping away
text: at the pedals.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: So I got the schedules. In the
dialog: mail. You listening to me?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I’m listening! You got the
dialog: schedules.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: And there are two sailings to
dialog: France in June, one in July.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: So whaddya think?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I think... I think it’s so cold I
dialog: can’t think straight.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Oh yeah? Well let’s get you warmed
dialog: up.
text: RICHARD accelerates. THERESE laughs, holds on tighter.
text: RICHARD begins to sing: “I love Paris in the... summer-time!"
text: as they speed away.
scene_heading: EXT. FRANKENBERG’S DEPARTMENT STORE. MORNING.
text: Outside the employee’s entrance, RICHARD and THERESE stand in
text: a longish line of MOSTLY YOUNG STAFF waiting to begin their
text: work day. Everyone looks exactly the same: a lot cold, a
text: little Soviet-factory-worker glum.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Anyway she wants to make it for you
dialog: so there’s no use fighting it, once
text: she gets an idea in her head...
dialog: She's just going crazy with no
dialog: girls in the family but Esther-
text: A SECURITY GUARD has opened the door and the line has begun
dialog: to move.
text: Upon entering, each employee is handed a Santa Cap, which
text: they dutifully put on. RICHARD reaches the door, takes his
text: cap, wordlessly puts it on, moves inside. He holds out a cap
text: to THERESE.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Compliments of the season from the
dialog: management.
text: THERESE takes her cap, doesn’t put it on, moves inside.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I gotta open the floor.
scene_heading: INT. FRANKENBERG’S. EMPLOYEE CAFETERIA. MORNING.
text: From a table in the corner, THERESE sips at a cup of coffee
text: and watches a sea of Santa-capped and uniform-smocked STAFF
text: move wordlessly along the breakfast line, accepting gooey
text: eggs and cups of coffee. THERESE looks down at a
text: Frankenberg’s employee handbook. We glimpse bits and pieces
dialog: of information: ...2 weeks vacation after 5 years, 4 weeks
dialog: vacation after 15 years... full pension, benefits...” She
dialog: turns a page: “Are YOU Frankenberg Material?”
text: It’s too depressing to take in. THERESE slips the handbook
text: back into her purse and removes a copy of Joyce’s “Portrait
text: of the Artist as a Young Man.” But just as she settles in
text: ROBERTA WALLS, an officious supervisor in bright red
text: harlequin glasses, swoops by THERESE planting a Santa cap
text: firmly onto her head.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA WALLS
dialog: You're needed upstairs, Miss
dialog: Belivet. Make it snappy.
scene_heading: INT. FRANKENBERG’S. DOLL STOCK ROOM. MORNING.
text: THERESE, surrounded by rows of identical Christmas dolls,
text: counts stock. THERESE watches a very middle-aged, wheezing
text: employee, RUBY ROBICHEK, struggle with carrying seven or
text: eight large boxes across the stock room floor. RUBY can’t see
text: in front of her, and as she attempts to peer around the edge
text: of the boxes, most of the boxes tumble out of RUBY’S arms and
text: onto the floor.
text: THERESE quickly determines she’s the only help on the floor,
text: and goes to assist RUBY, who has great difficulty in kneeling
text: to pick up the boxes.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: (kneels to help RUBY)
dialog: Please- let me help.
text: RUBY is grateful to avoid kneeling, and places each box
text: THERESE hands to her on the display counter.
speaker_heading: RUBY ROBICHEK
dialog: Thanks an awful lot, honey. I keep
dialog: telling them upstairs we need more
dialog: stock boys come the holidays, but
dialog: they haven't listened in 18 years.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: You’ve been here 18 years?
speaker_heading: RUBY ROBICHEK
dialog: Oh, sure. And when you're here long
dialog: enough, you’1l get inventive with
dialog: juggling boxes, like me.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I’m just a temporary. For the
dialog: holiday.
speaker_heading: RUBY ROBICHEK
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I said that once.
scene_heading: INT. FRANKENBERG'S. TOY DEPARTMENT. MORNING.
text: Just before opening: a surreal calm and silence. THERESE, in
text: Santa cap, and makeshift bandage, stands beside an elaborate
text: model train set. She flips a switch and the train set comes
text: to life - the tiny lights, the tinny whir of the engine as
text: the train chugs its way along the track. A LOUD BUZZER
text: sounds. Behind THERESE, we can see the analogue lift
text: indicator start to move: 5th floor, 4th floor, 3rd floor...
text: as the lift descends to accept its first load of daily
text: customers and a voice bellows from the intercom:
speaker_heading: STORE ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: Good morning, Happy Holidays and
dialog: welcome, shoppers, to
dialog: Frankenberg’s. Be sure to take
dialog: advantage of our Congratulations
dialog: Ike and Mamie Inaugural Early Bird
dialog: special in our Beds and Bedding
text: Department on the second floor.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: STORE ANNOUNCER (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And on your way there, you won’t
dialog: want to miss our brand new General
dialog: Electric television and
text: stereophonic display on the first
text: floor, just past the haberdashery.
text: Behind THERESE, the lift doors open and all at once THERESE
text: is swallowed up by the rush of MANAGERS, STAFF and CUSTOMERS.
scene_heading: INT. FRANKENBERG’S. DOLL DEPARTMENT. LATER
text: THERESE sits behind a display case full of dolls. She tries
text: to make herself invisible while she surreptitiously reads her
text: book. The department is full of MOTHERS buying Christmas
text: gifts for their children. THERESE’S reading is interrupted by
text: a SHARP WAILING. She looks up to see a TODDLER throwing a
text: tantrum and an EMBARRASSED MOM trying to get the situation
text: under control. Just then, ROBERTA WALLS bustles through the
text: department, sees THERESE, points to THERESE’S head - where’s
text: the Santa cap? ROBERTA WALLS seems to say without saying it.
text: THERESE hurriedly stashes her book into her handbag and pulls
text: out the cap. She tries to hide the bloodstains. ROBERTA WALLS
text: nods to THERESE and moves on.
text: THERESE settles back down, bored. A CUSTOMER looks
text: expectantly to THERESE; THERESE pretends she doesn’t see the
text: CUSTOMER and ducks down to her handbag to retrieve her book.
text: She looks up above the desk to see where the CUSTOMER went
text: and instead spies a glance of another woman - a woman whose
text: green silk scarf tied loosely around her neck and head
text: catches THERESE’S attention. This WOMAN appears to be the
text: only customer surrounded by no one else. This is CAROL AIRD.
text: CAROL bends down to examine the train set, and inadvertently
text: toggles the on/off switch - the train shuts down. CAROL
text: stands up, turns around towards the doll department, smiling,
text: as if asking for help.
text: THERESE meets CAROL’S eyes for a strange split second - until
text: the EMBARRASSED MOM and the screaming TODDLER appear in front
text: of THERESE, blocking her view of anything else.
speaker_heading: EMBARRASSED MOM
dialog: Where’s the ladies room, honey?
speaker_heading: THERESE
text: To the left, past men’s shoes, then
text: right at the tie racks.
text: EMBARRASSED MOM nods her thanks and hoists TODDLER away.
text: THERESE looks for CAROL, but she’s no longer there. The train
text: set is back on, and being admired by several sets of FATHERS
speaker_heading: and SONS.
scene_heading: INT. FRANKENBERG’S. DOLL DEPARTMENT. MOMENTS LATER
text: Behind and below the desk, THERESE contemplates sneaking a
text: read of her book, but decides against it. She glances back up
text: and sees a pair of black leather gloves tossed onto the desk.
text: THERESE looks and sees CAROL standing before her.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I’m looking for a doll. She’s about-
dialog: (she gestures)- this high and this
dialog: wide and... (rethinking): Let's
dialog: begin again, shall we?
text: As CAROL steps away from the desk a moment to rummage through
text: her purse, THERESE can’t stop staring - at her well-tailored
text: suit, her blonde hair, her green silk scarf. CAROL produces a
text: crumpled slip of paper, steps back up to the desk, gives
text: THERESE a big smile as she hands it to her.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: I wonder if you might help me find
dialog: this doll for my daughter.
text: THERESE reads the slip of paper.
speaker_heading: THERESE
text: Bright Betsy. She cries.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Oh she does?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: And wets herself. But we’re out of
dialog: stock.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I’ve left it too long.
text: She begins to rummage through her purse.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: We have plenty of other dolls. All
dialog: kinds, umm...
text: THERESE, suddenly tongue-tied, turns toward the doll display,
text: which CAROL turns to as well.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Right. What was your favorite doll
dialog: when you were four? Do you
dialog: remember?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Me? I never... Not many, to be
dialog: honest.
dialog: 10
text: CAROL raises a cigarette to her lips, begins to light it,
text: THERESE interrupts.
speaker_heading: THERESE (CONT’D)
dialog: Sorry. No smoking on the sales
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Oh, of all the - forgive me. (beat)
dialog: Shopping makes me nervous.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: That's okay. Working here makes me
dialog: nervous.
text: CAROL laughs, appreciating THERESE’S commiseration.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You're very kind.
text: Their eyes meet for a moment, before CAROL rummages inside
text: her purse again. She produces a billfold, opens it, shows it
text: to THERESE. It’s a photo of RINDY, CAROL’S 4-YEAR-OLD
speaker_heading: DAUGHTER.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: She looks like you. Around the
text: mouth. The eyes.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (glancing at THERESE)
dialog: You think so?
text: THERESE looks up, clocks CAROL watching her, looks down. A
text: bit of an awkward moment that CAROL rescues:
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: So what did you want? When you were
dialog: that age?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: (no hesitation)
text: A train set.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Really. That’s a surprise. (beat)
dialog: Do you know much about train sets?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I do actually. And there’s a new
dialog: model, just in last week. Hand-
dialog: built with hand-painted cars - it’s
dialog: a limited edition of five thousand,
dialog: with the most sophisticated
dialog: electric switching system - it’s
dialog: quite...
dialog: 11
text: THERESE checks her own enthusiasm, noticing CAROL’S eyes on
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: THERESE (CONT ’D)
dialog: You may have seen it. Over by the
dialog: elevators? Just there-
text: THERESE points towards the train set and CAROL turns to look,
text: mulling it over. THERESE watches her every move.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (turns back to THERESE)
dialog: Do you ship?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Special delivery. Or courier.
dialog: (beat) You'll have it in two, three
dialog: days. Two days. We’ll even assemble
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Well. That’s... that. Sold.
text: They stand there, nodding at each other for a moment.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Shall I pay now?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Oh - yes, of course.
text: THERESE begins writing out a sales slip, then slides it over
text: to CAROL with a pen, glancing up at her. CAROL snaps out of a
text: brief moment of thought, a distance.
speaker_heading: THERESE (CONT’D)
dialog: We'll need your account details,
dialog: your shipping address.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Of course. (she begins writing) I
dialog: love Christmas. At least I love the
text: preparation. Wrapping gifts, all
dialog: that. And then... you somehow wind
text: up overcooking the turkey anyway.
text: She finishes, flashing a bright smile. THERESE doesn’t quite
text: follow her, but she doesn’t want CAROL to stop talking.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT’D)
dialog: Done.
text: CAROL hands the pen and sales slip back to THERESE.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT’D)
dialog: Where’d you learn so much about
dialog: train sets, anyway?
dialog: 12
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I - read... Too much, probably.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: It's refreshing. Thank you. (beat)
dialog: And Merry Christmas.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Merry Christmas.
text: CAROL walks away. THERESE watches her, takes her all in - her
text: manner, her style, her walk. CAROL turns back for a moment,
text: and points to THERESE’S cap.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I like your hat.
text: THERESE watches her go off past the train set and elevators.
text: For a moment she watches as the empty spaces left behind are
text: filled by shoppers and staff. She cranes her neck for one
text: last look but it’s no good. She’s gone. THERESE sighs. She
text: looks down at the doll desk and sees that CAROL has left her
text: gloves behind.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT./EXT. TAXI. NEW YORK CITY. NIGHT. (APRIL 1953)
text: THERESE stares out the window, still wrapped up in thoughts.
text: Up front, JACK is pointing out the West Village apartment
text: building ("Here-here-here!”) and the taxi screeches to a
text: halt. Everyone tumbles out as JACK pays the driver. Before
text: she knows it, THERESE is climbing the stairs to PHIL
text: McELROY’S building. A window is thrown open above them and
text: PHIL McELROY, with typically unkempt hair, leans out.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: It’s about time, Belivet. Say hello
dialog: at least - It hasn’t been that
dialog: long!
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Hello - Phil - sorry, I was...
text: DANNIE, PHIL’S brother, leans out of the window next to PHIL.
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: There she is! Get up here! (picking
dialog: up on her state): What?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Nothing! There better be beer. Or
dialog: wine.
speaker_heading: OTHERS
dialog: Or beer!
dialog: 13
text: Someone rings THERESE and the others in. It makes an annoying
text: sound - a buzzing sound that makes THERESE frown, and as she
text: moves up the stairs and into the building we
speaker_heading: RETURN TO:
scene_heading: FLASHBACK: DECEMBER, 1952
scene_heading: INT. FRANKENBERG’S. EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM. EVENING.
text: THERESE stands at her open locker, as the BUZZER indicating
text: that the store is closed blares incessantly. She takes off
text: her Frankenberg’s smock and puts on a pair of dark tights
dialog: that she’s just bought, to cover up her bandage. It does the
text: trick. She puts on her coat, scarf, etc. The inside of her
text: locker door is decorated with photographs THERESE has taken,
text: shots of THERESE and RICHARD in Coney Island. As THERESE puts
text: CAROL'S gloves into her handbag, the BUZZING finally stops.
text: She can see RUBY ROBICHEK at her locker across the room,
text: pulling on some winter boots with great difficulty. THERESE
text: quickly dabs on some powder and shuts her locker.
scene_heading: INT. CINEMA PROJECTION ROOM. NIGHT.
text: THERESE, RICHARD, PHIL and DANNIE McELROY sit crowded
text: together in the small dark space, watching a movie through
text: the modest glass panel, smoking cigarettes. THERESE sits on
text: RICHARD’S lap, but RICHARD is more content kissing the back
text: of her neck than watching the film. PHIL McELROY, the film
text: projectionist and host, sits near the gears while his
text: brother, DANNIE, sits as close as he can to the movie,
text: jotting down occasional notes in a small notebook. The film
text: is Sunset Boulevard, and the scene is Norma Desmond’s New
text: Year's Eve party for two when she dances with Joe Gillis on
text: the marble ballroom floor. THERESE is fascinated by DANNIE,
text: but PHIL slaps him on the back of his head.
speaker_heading: PHIL
text: Move over. Nobody else can see the
dialog: screen.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
text: (through his nuzzling of
speaker_heading: THERESE)
text: Nobody else is watching.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I’m watching.
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: (to THERESE)
dialog: I’ve seen it six times. I’m
dialog: charting the correlation between
dialog: what the characters say and how
dialog: they really feel.
dialog: 14
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: My kid brother, the movie jerk.
text: DANNIE, embarrassed, moves slightly away from the glass. But
text: he still watches, still jots notes. THERESE watches him.
scene_heading: INT. GREENWICH VILLAGE BAR. NIGHT.
text: RICHARD and PHIL have been drinking quite a bit. A row of
text: empty beer bottles is lined up on the table in front of them.
text: DANNIE sips at a glass of Coca-Cola. THERESE nurses a glass
dialog: of wine.
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: I'm strictly a beer man. Everything
dialog: else makes me want to vomit.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Wine makes me feel naughty. In a
dialog: good way.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Is there any other way to feel
dialog: naughty?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I drink to forget I gotta get up
dialog: for work in the morning.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: That’s your problem, Semco. You
dialog: really ought to drink because you
dialog: remember you have a job.
dialog: Employment’s a curse.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: You have a job, Phil.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You call that a job? I call it an
dialog: illusion.
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: You get paid. Is money an illusion?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: My kid brother, the jerk
dialog: philosopher.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: (to Dannie)
dialog: Where do you work?
dialog: 15
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (mock respect)
dialog: Didn’t you know - Dannie works at
dialog: the New York Times.
text: RICHARD and PHIL feign awe.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: (she’s impressed)
dialog: No kidding.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yeah, ‘cept printers don’t win
dialog: Pulitzer Prizes.
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: (he shrugs)
dialog: It’s a job. (to THERESE) What I
dialog: want to do is write. That’s why I
dialog: watch movies.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (rolling his eyes)
dialog: Everybody's a writer....
text: DANNIE tries to blend into the woodwork. He catches THERESE’S
text: eye. She smiles at him. He appreciates it.
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Say, Therese - before I get too
dialog: drunk to remember....
text: PHIL digs into a large messenger bag, pulls out a camera, an
text: old Kodak, and hands it to THERESE.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: You did it? It’s fixed?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: He said it was a cinch. No sweat.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Thank you, Phil! I was missing it!
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: So, you take pictures?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Well.
speaker_heading: RICHARD

speaker_heading: THERESE

text: job, slow and steady.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Like that?
text: RICHARD lets go of THERESE’S hand and leans back, closes his
text: eyes. He lets out a low moan.
dialog: 18
text: THERESE watches RICHARD intently the whole time, as if she’s
text: more an observer than a full participant. RICHARD’S breathing
text: rapidly quickens.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (as he comes)
dialog: I love you, Terry.
text: RICHARD relaxes. THERESE pulls her hand out of RICHARD’S
text: shorts. She looks down at the semen on her hand. RICHARD sits

speaker_heading: RICHARD (CONT’D)
dialog: Jesus, Terry, you shouldn’t look at
dialog: it.
text: RICHARD laughs, wipes THERESE’S hand with his undershirt and

scene_heading: EXT. THERESE’S APARTMENT. LATE NIGHT.

speaker_heading: CAROL

scene_heading: INT. FRANKENBERG’S. DOLL DESK. LATE AFTERNOON.
text: THERESE on the phone. WALLS, stony-faced and staring.

scene_heading: INT. MIDTOWN RESTAURANT. DAY.

text: falls against her wrist as she peruses her menu to the way
text: CAROL'S fingers grip her water glass.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I’m so sorry to keep you waiting.
dialog: (to the WAITER) I’1l have the
text: creamed spinach over poached eggs.
text: And a dry martini. With an olive.
text: CAROL and the WAITER look to THERESE, who realizes she hasn’t

speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I‘1l have the same.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: The meal or the drink?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Uhh - All of it. Thank you.
text: The WAITER nods, starting off, as CAROL clocks THERESE’S
text: uncertainty. THERESE not wanting to stare at CAROL, now picks
text: up her menu and thumbs through it.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Cigarette?
text: CAROL offers THERESE a cigarette from her exquisite silver
text: case. THERESE notices that CAROL’S hands are lovely and
text: smooth, salon manicured, in contrast to THERESE’S own.

text: THERESE’S cigarette and THERESE proceeds to smoke it, though

speaker_heading: THERESE

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Cheers.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: (clinking glasses)
dialog: Cheers.
text: CAROL sips at her martini. THERESE watches her for a moment,

text: strength. CAROL smiles.
speaker_heading: THERESE (CONT’D)
dialog: (beat) So, you - I’m sure you
dialog: thought it was a man who sent back
dialog: your gloves.
dialog: 26
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I did. I thought it might be a man
dialog: in the ski department.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: No, I’m delighted. I doubt very
dialog: much if I’d have gone to lunch with

text: THERESE watches as CAROL massages the back of her neck for a
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Your perfume -
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: It’s nice.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Thank you. Harge bought me a bottle

speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Harge is your husband?
speaker_heading: CAROL

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I see. Would you like to marry him?
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: (she makes light of it)
dialog: I... barely know what to order for
dialog: lunch.
text: CAROL nods, almost looks past THERESE - what is she thinking
text: about? Suddenly it seems to THERESE that CAROL’S mood has
text: somehow darkened.
text: The WAITER appears with their food. He sets their plates
text: down. CAROL picks up her silverware, the cloud seemingly
dialog: past.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I’m starved. Bon appetit.
text: CAROL eats and THERESE watches, almost having to force
text: herself to pick up her fork and knife and join her. But she
text: does. CAROL looks up at her for a moment:
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: And what do you do on Sundays?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Nothing in particular. What do you
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Nothing - lately. If you’d like to
dialog: visit me some time, you’re welcome

scene_heading: INT. ABBY’S CAR. DAY.
text: ABBY snakes along Sixth Avenue.
speaker_heading: CAROL

speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Don’t be a stupe.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Why don’t I just not show up?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Because I’1l be blamed. So you'd

scene_heading: EXT. NEW JERSEY. WEALTHY SUBURBS. EARLY EVENING.
text: A well-kept road full of wealthy homes, green, sweeping lots,

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
text: Christmas morning. With Rindy.
text: CAROL exchanges a brief look with HARGE before answering.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Oh, we... usually get up at dawn,
dialog: Harge and I, and we - we wrap
dialog: Rindy’s gifts together. Arrange

dialog: Rindy to wake. Which is - she
dialog: normally-
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: (helps CAROL out)
dialog: Usually, she’s down the stairs ina

dialog: Keep an eye out, will you? Cy’1l
dialog: scream if he catches me with this.
speaker_heading: CAROL

dialog: 32
speaker_heading: JEANETTE
dialog: (very matter of fact)
dialog: He doesn’t like me to smoke.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: So? You like it.
dialog: But they both know that it’s simply the way it is: wives
dialog: defer to their husband’s wishes.
speaker_heading: JEANETTE
dialog: Carol, I - it’s really not my
dialog: business, but if you’re going to be
dialog: alone on Christmas, Cy and I would
dialog: love to have you.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (she’s really touched by
dialog: the offer)
dialog: Thank you, Jeanette.
text: CAROL takes another look inside the party: couples dancing

speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)

text: mostly it’s the photos themselves that she’s in awe of.
dialog: Candids, crime scenes, sports photos, everything that makes
text: up the visual narrative of a newspaper. DANNIE sits at a desk
text: and sets up dinner, a makeshift array brought from home -
text: wrapped sandwiches, bottles of beer. THERESE breathes it all
text: in, not daring to touch anything.
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: Don’t worry, nothing’s gonna break
dialog: if you pick it up. You want a
dialog: sandwich?
text: THERESE shakes her head, picks up a contact sheet and a
text: magnifier and glances at the pictures. DANNIE watches her.
speaker_heading: DANNIE (CONT’D)
dialog: What are your pictures like?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: They’re - probably not very good. I
dialog: don’t know.
dialog: 33
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: I mean, what are they? What are
dialog: they of?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Trees. Birds. Windows. Anything,
dialog: really. (beat) What do you write
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: People.
text: A pause. THERESE looks through a camera lens at DANNIE. He
text: looks up at her, she lowers the lens.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I feel strange, I think... taking
dialog: pictures of people. It feels like -
dialog: an intrusion or a-
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: Invasion of privacy?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Yes.
text: DANNIE opens a beer, holds it out to THERESE. She takes it.
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: Yeah but, all of us, we have, you
dialog: know - affinities for people,
dialog: right?
text: THERESE doesn’t answer.
speaker_heading: DANNIE (CONT’D)
dialog: Or certain people. There are
dialog: certain people you like...
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Sometimes.
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: And others you don’t. And you don’t
dialog: really know why you’re attracted to
dialog: some people and not others, the
dialog: only thing you know is - you either
dialog: are attracted or you’re not. It’s
dialog: like physics - bouncing off each
text: other like pin balls.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: So now you're a scientist?
dialog: 34
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: Just trying to explain why I write
dialog: about people rather than trees.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Sounds more like psychology.
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: Physics is more comforting.
text: THERESE grabs a sandwich.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Yeah, but... Not everything’s as
dialog: simple as a bunch of pin balls
dialog: reacting, or...
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: Some things don’t even react. But
dialog: everything's alive.
text: A beat. DANNIE moves to THERESE, takes the beer bottle away
text: from her, puts it down. He puts his hand on THERESE’S
dialog: shoulders.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: It’s late. I should go.
text: He kisses her, and she lets him, remaining very still. Then
text: DANNIE steps back and THERESE looks down.
speaker_heading: THERESE (CONT’D)
dialog: You shouldn't...
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: Why? Did you mind?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: Would Richard mind?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Probably. (beat) I have to go.
text: THERESE gathers her things together, goes to the door.
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: Come back tomorrow? Or Wednesday?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Maybe. I don’t know.
text: THERESE leaves.
dialog: 35
scene_heading: EXT. CAROL’S HOUSE. LATE NIGHT.
text: HARGE has brought CAROL home from the party. They stand
text: together outside the door while CAROL fishes for her keys.
text: HARGE reaches into his pocket and produces his, opens door.
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Thanks. And thanks for staying
dialog: sober and driving me home.
dialog: (kissing his cheek)
dialog: Goodnight, Harge.
text: She starts to go inside the house. HARGE stops her gently.
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: Come to my parents for Christmas.
dialog: We had a nice time tonight.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (not unkindly)
dialog: It was one night.
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: I don’t like to think of you.
dialog: Alone.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I’m not alone. There’s Rindy,
dialog: there’s-
text: She stops herself. HARGE knows what she was about to say.
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: Abby. There’s always Abby.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: Abby and I were over long before
dialog: you and I were over, Harge. (beat)
dialog: I‘1l have Rindy packed and ready
dialog: for you at four on Christmas Eve.
text: She starts to step inside the house.
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: It shouldn't be like this.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I know.
text: And she quietly shuts the door on HARGE.
dialog: 36
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
text: The living room is dark and quiet. RINDY has fallen asleep on
text: the sofa; FLORENCE, on a chair opposite. CAROL gives FLORENCE
text: a pat on her shoulder and squats down beside RINDY.
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: She wanted to wait up for you.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Ah, mama's special girl.
text: CAROL brushes a strand of hair away from her eyes. She gently
text: picks her up and carries her out of the room and up the
dialog: stairs.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Goodnight, Florence.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. LATER
text: CAROL lifts a holiday blanket from a small platform,
text: revealing the assembled train set, set up behind a couch. She
text: switches on the train and watches it begin its slow route
text: along the tracks. She sips at a nightcap.
scene_heading: EXT. FRANKENBERG’S. SEVENTH AVENUE ENTRANCE. EARLY SUNDAY
speaker_heading: AFTERNOON.
text: THERESE, in coat, scarf and gloves, waits for CAROL’S car to
text: pull up outside. RICHARD waits with her.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Where’s this place in Jersey?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: The country, I think. I don’t
dialog: really know.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: My uncle Sal lives in Union City
dialog: and he claims it’s pretty dangerous
dialog: out there at night-
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: It’s not Union City.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Okay, okay.
text: CAROL pulls up to the curb.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: There’s my ride.
dialog: 37
text: RICHARD accompanies THERESE to the car. He opens the door for
text: her, she gets in, shuts the door, rolls down the window. He
text: leans down to kiss her.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Eight o’clock?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Eight o’clock.
text: RICHARD looks into the car, holds up a hand in greeting to
speaker_heading: CAROL.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Hello. Carol Aird.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
text: (leans across THERESE to
dialog: shake CAROL’S hand)
dialog: Richard Semco. Glad to meet you.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Likewise.
speaker_heading: THERESE
speaker_heading: (to RICHARD)
dialog: She wanted to meet you.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Therese speaks very highly of you.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (pleased to hear it)
dialog: Well, that’s - swell. So you'll...
dialog: get her back safe and sound?
text: CAROL smiles, salutes her assent. THERESE is slightly
dialog: embarrassed.
text: RICHARD leans into the car and touches THERESE’S chin
dialog: lightly.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (CONT’D)
dialog: Love you.
text: But THERESE has already rolled up the window, the car has
text: started to go. RICHARD diminishes through the rear window.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S CAR. APPROACHING LINCOLN TUNNEL. DAY.
text: CAROL and THERESE make their way cross town, as a cool winter
text: sun combs through the car windows. CAROL appears at home
text: behind the wheel - relaxed, confident.
dialog: 38
text: To THERESE, the world inside CAROL’S car is a revelation,
text: from the tan leather upholstery and mahogany dashboard to the
text: effortless style and elegance of its driver. The sounds of
text: the world - even CAROL’S occasional chatter - have been
text: replaced with the stillest MUSIC, the sound of air and light.
text: The presence of this older, sophisticated woman, who wears
text: silk stockings and expensive perfume, is intoxicating and
text: unnerving in equal measure. Even Carol’s purse, which rests
text: beside THERESE on the seat, is quite unlike anything she has
text: seen or examined so closely, full of mystery and make-up and
text: fragrances. From there her eyes wander down to CAROL’S legs,
text: clad in smoky silk stockings. Glancing down at her own legs,
text: wrapped in sensible wool tights, THERESE wonders if she will
dialog: ever be the kind of woman who owns such a car and wears such
dialog: clothes.
text: The MUSIC broods slightly as THERESE looks straight ahead and
text: the car enters the Lincoln Tunnel. The car plunges into the
text: semi-darkness as if entering a cocoon, a delirious descent,
text: which binds them together. She watches CAROL’S fingers grip
text: the wheel, how CAROL squints slightly when she concentrates.
text: THERESE can barely suppress a tiny smile. But glancing back,
text: CAROL suddenly appears to be miles away. CAROL switches on
text: the car radio and Jo Stafford’s “You Belong to Me” comes on.
text: THERESE leans back in her seat as they continue, speeding
text: through the dark tunnel.
scene_heading: AS WE RETURN TO:
scene_heading: INT. PHIL’S APARTMENT. NIGHT. (APRIL 1953)
text: “You Belong To Me” also plays as several COUPLES DANCE, among
text: them RICHARD and a PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN who he clutches
text: tightly. THERESE, drinking a beer, watches them from a
text: hallway just outside the living room.
text: RICHARD catches sight of THERESE, tensing slightly, before
text: spinning his partner up and away from THERESE’S view. THERESE
text: looks down, pulling out a cigarette from her purse and
text: lighting it. She spots an attractive dark-haired woman on the
text: opposite side of the living room whose eyes are clearly on
text: her. THERESE holds her gaze for a few seconds, but she can
text: feel herself blush, and she looks down. When she looks back
text: up, the WOMAN has disappeared. THERESE saunters a bit,
text: glancing into the next room where she spots DANNIE and his
text: girlfriend LOUISE slow-dancing. They barely move, holding on
text: to each other the way people do when they’re newly in love.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: FLASHBACK: DECEMBER, 1952.
dialog: 39
scene_heading: INT./EXT. CAROL’S CAR. XMAS TREE LOT. NEW JERSEY. DAY.
text: At a Christmas tree lot, THERESE sits in the car loading her
text: camera with film. When she’s done, she spots CAROL outside as
text: a TEENAGED BOY ties up their tree, a large Doug Fir. The
text: TEENAGED BOY has a bad cold and CAROL offers him tissues.
text: THERESE steps out of the car, aims her camera and takes a few
dialog: shots.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S CAR. RIDGEWOOD, NEW JERSEY. DAY.
text: The car makes its way to Carol’s house, with the Douglas Fir
text: laid across the front and back seats between THERESE and
speaker_heading: CAROL.
text: THERESE loves the feeling of the needles against her skin,
text: the way it smells, the way she knows that CAROL is beside
text: her, though she can’t see her. The car comes to a halt in
text: front of CAROL’S house. It’s a big house, a bigger house than
text: THERESE has ever been inside. CAROL turns off the engine.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You still with me?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Yes.
text: CAROL opens her door, pops out of the car. THERESE is about
text: to get out of the car when she sees the front door of the
text: house open and RINDY come tearing out to greet her mother.
text: FLORENCE stands in the doorway, ready to escort mother and
dialog: daughter inside.
speaker_heading: RINDY
dialog: Mommyyyy!!
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Hello, my darling! Guess what I
dialog: brought you? I bet you’ll never
dialog: guess...
text: THERESE watches as mother and daughter proceed inside,
text: chattering away.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S HOUSE. KITCHEN. DAY. LATER.
text: THERESE prepares a tray of tea and cookies. Through the open
text: door we can see CAROL and RINDY in the living room,
text: decorating the tree. Almost finished, CAROL is setting up a
text: ladder beside the tree.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Where’s the star?
dialog: 40
text: RINDY roots around in the pile of ornaments, finds it.
speaker_heading: RINDY
dialog: This one, Mommy.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: That's my girl.
text: THERESE watches as CAROL ascends the ladder and places the
text: star at the top of the tree.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Look how beautiful!
text: CAROL descends the step ladder and joins Rindy, taking her
text: into her lap.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Have you ever seen a more beautiful
dialog: tree? And now... what comes after
dialog: the star is placed?
speaker_heading: RINDY
dialog: More stars!
speaker_heading: CAROL
speaker_heading: (tickling RINDY)
dialog: I don't... think... so!
speaker_heading: O/S FLORENCE
dialog: You find everything you need, miss?
text: THERESE, startled, turns to see FLORENCE standing at the rear
text: of the kitchen, near a back door.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Gosh, you scared me. How silly.
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: (she’s not sorry)
dialog: I’m sorry, miss. (beat) I'1l take
dialog: that through for Mrs. Aird.
text: FLORENCE picks up the tray, walks through to the living room.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
text: A fire crackles in the fireplace as CAROL, seated under the
text: tree, struggles to wrap the train set. THERESE sits at the
text: piano, improvising, jumping from one bit of a tune to
text: another. A half-empty bottle of white wine and a couple of
text: glasses stand nearby.
dialog: 4l
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Were those pictures of me you were
dialog: taking? At the tree lot?
text: THERESE stops playing. A silence.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I’m sorry. I should have asked.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Don’t apologize.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I’ve been trying to... A friend of
dialog: mine told me I should be more
dialog: interested. In humans.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: And how's that going?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: (after a small beat)
dialog: Well... actually.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I’m glad.
text: THERESE begins to play “Easy Living.” CAROL listens for a
text: moment, rises, walks over to Therese.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s beautiful.
text: She grazes her hand on Therese’s shoulder. THERESE freezes,
text: and CAROL tries to lighten the moment with two quick strokes
text: to her cheek. THERESE continues to play and CAROL listens.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that what you want to be? A
dialog: photographer?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I think so. If I have any talent
dialog: for it.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Isn't that something other people
dialog: let you know you have? All you can
dialog: do is - keep working. Use what
dialog: feels right. Throw away the rest.
text: THERESE finishes the song. CAROL starts over to a table by
text: the couch, opens a cigarette box, takes one out, lights it.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Will you show me your work?
dialog: (she sits on the couch)
dialog: 42
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Sure. I mean, I haven’t sold
dialog: anything. Or even shown a picture
dialog: to anyone who could buy one. I
dialog: don’t even have a decent camera.
dialog: But... they’re all at my place.
text: Under the sink, mostly.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Invite me round.
text: From outside, the sound of a car pulling into the driveway.
text: Car door opens and slams. The moment broken, CAROL rises
text: quickly, and marches toward the front door.
text: CAROL comes out of the living room and finds HARGE in the
text: entry, restringing the mistletoe.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Harge. What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: Nothing. Does there have to be a
dialog: problem for me to visit my wife?
text: HARGE approaches CAROL, reaching out to greet her, but stops,
text: spotting THERESE at the piano in the living room. He looks to
text: CAROL and CAROL looks away. Then HARGE moves past CAROL down
text: the hall and into the kitchen. THERESE clocks it all.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. LATER.
text: THERESE browses through a book, alone in the living room, as
text: she hears CAROL and HARGE conversing in the kitchen. Through
text: the cracked door she catches glimpses of CAROL pacing to and
text: fro, anxiously smoking, and hears the sounds of HARGE
text: repairing a pipe under the kitchen sink. She tries occupying
text: herself, perusing titles of books from the bookshelf.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: ... that’s not fair, Harge. We
dialog: agreed that Rindy would stay with
dialog: me until Christmas Eve.
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: What do you suggest I do? - You
dialog: think I prefer traipsing off to
dialog: West Palm Beach for the holiday? It
dialog: was all mother’s doing-
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: But I’m not - ready - She’s not
dialog: packed - she’s asleep in bed! What
dialog: about my Christmas with my daughter-
dialog: ?
dialog: 43
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: I’m sorry, Carol, but it can’t be
dialog: helped. The flight’s in the morning
dialog: - You think I've packed?... (the
dialog: sound of dropped tools)-Goddamnit!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S HOUSE. KITCHEN. CONTINUOUS.
text: HARGE emerges from beneath the sink, having hurt his hand.
text: CAROL goes to help him up. But as he does he spots THERESE
text: through the door. He marches over and opens it fully. THERESE
text: looks caught, startled. A silence.
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: How do you know my wife?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Harge, please...
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I - work at Frankenberg’s. The
dialog: department store.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I ordered a gift from her desk. I
dialog: forgot my gloves. She returned
dialog: them. I thanked her.
speaker_heading: HARGE
speaker_heading: (to CAROL)
dialog: That’s bold.
text: HARGE sizes THERESE up for a moment before he turns back into
text: the kitchen. He walks past CAROL and exits into a cloakroom
text: at the back of the house where we hear sounds of his cleaning
text: up. CAROL, exasperated, approaches the living room doorway.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Can I - do-
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Just... leave it be.
text: CAROL gently shuts the door. THERESE is left standing there,
dialog: shut out.
scene_heading: EXT. CAROL’S HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: A UNIFORMED CHAUFFEUR sits at the wheel of Harge’s car, alert
text: and silent, as CAROL bundles RINDY into the back seat.
text: FLORENCE puts her bags in the trunk as HARGE waits with a
text: cigarette and drink outside the front door.
speaker_heading: 44
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Remember: in bed by seven. I know
dialog: how you take advantage of Grandma
dialog: Jennifer. (beat) Okay, snow flake.
dialog: Gimme a big one.
text: (she hugs RINDY tightly
dialog: and kisses her)
dialog: You're going to have the most
dialog: wonderful Christmas, I promise.
text: RINDY pulls back from the hug. She has an idea.
speaker_heading: RINDY
dialog: There’s room for you in the car,
dialog: Mommy. You can come with us!
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Oh, darling, I - wish I could...
dialog: but sometimes... Mommies and
dialog: Daddies decide there isn’t enough
dialog: room for them both in the same
dialog: place at the same time- (unable to
dialog: go further) And Mommy has to be
dialog: here to make sure Santa’s elf
dialog: doesn’t give your presents to
dialog: another little girl. You wouldn’t
dialog: want that, would you?
text: RINDY gives her a bright smile and CAROL hugs her, and kisses
text: her eyelids. CAROL clocks the CHAUFFEUR watching her through
text: the rear view mirror, and quickly looks away.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. CONTINUOUS
text: MUSIC PLAYS softly from the phonograph ("El Americano” by
text: Xavier Cugal and his Orchestra) as THERESE tidies up, trying
text: to make herself useful. She can see CAROL through the bay
text: window, shutting the car door and starting back toward the
text: house, wearing only a thin sweater around her shoulders.
text: She sees HARGE step off of the front porch, stub out his
text: cigarette, and walk towards CAROL.
scene_heading: EXT. CAROL’S HOUSE. CONTINUOUS.
text: CAROL heads to the front door, but HARGE pulls her back
text: towards him. A silence, as he takes her hand in one of his.
text: He can hear the MUSIC from inside the house. He sways a
dialog: little.
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: You smell good.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You're drunk.
dialog: 45
text: He pulls her closer to him, he closes his eyes, tries to
dialog: dance with her.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Harge, I’m cold.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. CONTINUOUS.
text: Through the open front door THERESE can see HARGE stumble
text: back slightly, away from CAROL and CAROL grabbing his arm to
dialog: right him.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Let me get you some coffee.
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: (a bit drunk)
dialog: I’m not drunk.
text: HARGE takes a step towards CAROL. THERESE ducks back into the
text: living room, not wishing to overhear any more.
speaker_heading: HARGE (CONT'D)
dialog: You can still come with us. Go pack
text: a bag.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I can’t do that.
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: Sure, you can. It’s easy. We can
dialog: buy you a ticket in the morning.
scene_heading: EXT. CAROL’S HOUSE. CONTINUOUS.
text: HARGE tries to take her hand, she backs away.
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: What? You’re going to spend
dialog: Christmas with Abby? Is that it? Or
dialog: with your - shop girl?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Stop it, Harge.
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: I put nothing past women like you.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You married a woman like me.
dialog: 46
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. CONTINUOUS.
text: THERESE goes to the phonograph, increases the volume
text: slightly, so that she can hear only the rising and falling of
text: the voices outside.
scene_heading: EXT. CAROL’S HOUSE. CONTINUOUS.
text: HARGE reaches out to grab CAROL, she backs away. He stumbles,
text: falls onto his knees. A silence, as he catches his breath.
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: Come with me now. If you don’t - if
dialog: you - let me - open that car door -
dialog: if you won’t come-
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (she interrupts him)
dialog: Then what? Then it’s over?
text: HARGE is about to respond, but he suddenly realizes he’s on
text: his hands and knees, drunk, before CAROL, who is very still
dialog: and very silent.
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: Goddamn you - You were never...
dialog: cruel.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Harge...
text: CAROL takes a step towards HARGE. She cannot bear to see him
text: in this state. But HARGE won’t accept her help now. He rises,
text: and takes a quick look at his waiting car, RINDY in the back
text: seat. HARGE takes a few deep breaths, smooths his clothes,
text: wipes his face with the palm of his hand. CAROL takes another
text: step towards him.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT’D)
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: HARGE stiffens, recoils, digs his hands deep into his coat
text: pocket and turns away, striding briskly to his car. CAROL
text: watches as he piles in and shuts the door. The car drives
text: off. CAROL hugs herself tight against the cold.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S HOUSE. EVENING. CONTINUOUS.
text: THERESE hears the front door quietly shut, standing at the
text: phonograph - still, silent. She looks up and CAROL is there,
text: watching her, but it’s almost as if CAROL is looking through
text: her. Then CAROL goes to switch off the phonograph and moves
text: off to pour herself a drink. She opens the cigarette case.
dialog: 47
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I should call a cab.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: And just when you think it can’t
dialog: get any worse, you run out of
dialog: cigarettes.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Oh - I - tell me where to go. I’1l
dialog: buy some for you. Really, I don’t
dialog: mind-
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (snaps)
dialog: You don’t have to run out in the
dialog: middle of nowhere to buy
dialog: cigarettes. Not for me. I’m fine.
text: A pause. CAROL drinks. THERESE covers her upset.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
text: The next train’s at 6.50. I’1l
dialog: drive you to the station.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S CAR. NIGHT.
text: CAROL drives THERESE to the station. There’s no one else on
text: the road; it’s utterly noiseless. At this moment there
dialog: couldn’t be more distance between them.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN CAR. NIGHT.
text: THERESE sits against a window as the train speeds its way
text: back to Manhattan. A couple of HOLIDAY REVELERS, laughing and
text: tipsy, bump against THERESE’S seat as they make their way
text: through the car. THERESE turns to watch them as they make
text: their way to the end of the car. Their joyfulness is
text: unbearable to THERESE. She makes herself as small as she can
text: against the window. She is crying.
scene_heading: INT. SEMCO APARTMENT. NIGHT.
text: It’s a warm, ramshackle apartment full of overstuffed,
text: mismatched furniture and bowling trophies. In the kitchen,
text: RICHARD washes up a pile of dinner plates while MRS. SEMCO
text: sits at the table with THERESE. She takes a thermometer out
text: of THERESE’S mouth and holds it up to the light to read it.
speaker_heading: MRS. SEMCO
dialog: (refers to the
dialog: thermometer)
dialog: What is this number? I can’t read
dialog: it. My eyes!
dialog: 48
text: THERESE reads the thermometer for MRS. SEMCO.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Ninety-eight point six. Perfectly
dialog: normal. No fever.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You hear that ma, no fever.
speaker_heading: MRS. SEMCO
dialog: My eyes is no good, not my ears.
dialog: You wanna plate of noodles, Terry?
dialog: We saved you a big plate.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I’m really not that hungry.
speaker_heading: MRS. SEMCO
dialog: (she’s kidding, but she’s
dialog: not)
dialog: I thought you was a smart cookie.
dialog: You know that’s not the way to a
dialog: mother-in-law’s heart.
text: RICHARD and THERESE exchange a look. RICHARD’S mother has
dialog: embarrassed him.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Ma - cut it out.
speaker_heading: MRS. SEMCO
dialog: What? Cut it out what?

speaker_heading: MR. SEMCO
dialog: (to THERESE)
dialog: You showed up. Good. I was tired of
dialog: hearing him moan. Do me a favour,
dialog: Therese. Settle down with him
dialog: already.
text: RICHARD’S even more embarrassed.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Come on, what is this? The
dialog: Inquisition?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: (defusing the situation)
dialog: Okay - I’1l eat.
text: MRS SEMCO beams, pinches THERESE’S cheek.
speaker_heading: MRS. SEMCO
dialog: That's my girl!
dialog: 49
text: She prepares THERESE a plate. RICHARD and THERESE exchange a
text: look. He appreciates her assist.
scene_heading: INT. SEMCO APARTMENT. NIGHT.
text: RICHARD’S ROOM. THERESE and RICHARD sit on his bed. THERESE
text: holds a wrapped box on her lap.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I can’t open this now. It’s days
dialog: before Christmas.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: But I want you to. (he shrugs) I'm
dialog: impatient.
text: THERESE unwraps and opens the box. Inside are brochures of
dialog: France- and two tickets for passage on a ship. The date of
dialog: departure: March 1, 1953. A pause.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Richard... what is this?
text: RICHARD beams, takes one of the tickets from THERESE.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Well, that one’s mine. I thought it
dialog: was more romantic to wrap ‘em up
dialog: together.
text: THERESE stares at the ticket in her hand, picks up one of the
dialog: brochures full of pictures of Paris landmarks...
speaker_heading: RICHARD (CONT’D)
dialog: Jeez, Terry, you could cheer up a
dialog: little. It’s not every day you get
dialog: a trip to Europe for Christmas.
text: THERESE looks up at RICHARD.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: We're supposed to go in July.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I know, but - look, I was gonna
dialog: tell you on Christmas day.
dialog: Frankenberg’s offered me a
dialog: promotion. Assistant manager, beds
text: and bedding.
text: THERESE just stares at him, unable to say a word.
dialog: 50
speaker_heading: RICHARD (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s a big raise. And they’re
dialog: letting me take a month off in
dialog: March, two weeks of it paid. The
dialog: summer’s a busy time there and-
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I can’t go in March.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Why not? You get laid off next
dialog: week. It’s not like you have any
dialog: big plans.
text: But this stings THERESE, and RICHARD regrets saying it.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (CONT’D)
dialog: I didn’t mean - Terry, you know I
dialog: think the world of you and - well,
dialog: I thought you wanted to go to
dialog: France. With me. And I figured...
dialog: what the hell, the sooner the
dialog: better...
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I do want to go. I did. (beat) It’s
dialog: just - soon. March.
text: A silence. THERESE puts the ticket and brochure back into the
text: box, puts the lid back on to the box.
scene_heading: INT. THERESE’S APARTMENT BLDG. LATE NIGHT.
text: THERESE can be seen through a window getting out of a cab,
text: entering the dark building and wearily climbing the stairs.
text: As she gets to her apartment door the hall telephone STARTS
text: TO RING. THERESE turns, sighs, goes to answer it.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Hello?
text: A door down the hall cracks opens - THERESE’S LANDLADY peers
text: out towards THERESE.
speaker_heading: LANDLADY
dialog: Do you know what time it is, Miss
dialog: Belivet?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I’m sorry - it just rang...
text: None too pleased, THE LANDLADY shuts her door. THERESE
text: returns her attention to the phone.
speaker_heading: THERESE (CONT’D)
dialog: Hello?
dialog: 51
text: No one answers.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S HOUSE. BEDROOM. CONTINUOUS.
text: CAROL, on the other line, smokes a cigarette, exhales.
scene_heading: INT. THERESE’S APARTMENT BLDG. CONTINUOUS.
text: Suddenly, THERESE knows who’s on the other end of the line.
text: She closes her eyes.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Carol.
speaker_heading: CAROL (0.S.)
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: I was - horrible. Before. Will you
dialog: forgive me?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Yes... I mean... It’s not-
speaker_heading: CAROL (0.S.)
dialog: Then will you - would you - let me
dialog: come see you... tomorrow evening?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Yes... Yes. (beat) I want to -
dialog: know. I think. I mean, to ask
dialog: you... things. But I’m not sure you
dialog: want that.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S HOUSE. BEDROOM. CONTINUOUS.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Ask me. Things. Please.
scene_heading: INT. THERESE’S APARTMENT BLDG. CONTINUOUS.
text: THERESE closes her eyes. Silence. Which is suddenly pierced
text: by A GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE entering THERESE’S building, giddy
text: and intoxicated. THERESE is startled, watching them from
text: above, stumbling into the building. By the time she puts the
text: phone back to her ear, she knows CAROL’S hung up.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. PHIL’S APARTMENT. NIGHT. (APRIL 1953)
text: The party is in full swing - more of a crowd, more LAUGHTER,
text: boozing.
dialog: 52
text: THERESE stands at a window near a SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE,
text: including GENEVIEVE CANTRELL, the woman she spotted earlier.
text: THERESE tries to watch GENEVIEVE without being seen as a MALE
text: PARTY GUEST dominates.
speaker_heading: MALE PARTY GUEST
dialog: I don’t know, man. You can have
dialog: her. She’s one of these real
dialog: Greenwich Village phonies, if you
dialog: ask me. (to someone else): Where
dialog: you goin’ Dave? Stick around a
dialog: minute.
speaker_heading: GENEVIEVE
dialog: You're Phil’s friend, aren’t you?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I am, yes. And Dannie’s.
speaker_heading: GENEVIEVE
dialog: Aren’t you going to ask me how I
dialog: knew that?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Aren’t most people here Phil’s
dialog: friends?
text: GENEVIEVE smiles - touche. THERESE smiles, too, loosening up,
text: enjoying the flirting.
speaker_heading: GENEVIEVE
dialog: I can see why Phil speaks so highly
dialog: of you.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Can you?
speaker_heading: GENEVIEVE
dialog: Oh, definitely. I can see a lot.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Really? What do you see?
speaker_heading: GENEVIEVE
dialog: (gives her a good long
dialog: look)
dialog: Great - potential.
text: GENEVIEVE hands THERESE a beer, and they clink in a toast.
text: THERESE smiles, she enjoys GENEVIEVE’S attention, but she
text: can’t hold GENEVIEVE’S gaze, something about its boldness
text: draws her away from the moment, from the party...
speaker_heading: RETURN TO:
scene_heading: FLASHBACK: DECEMBER 1952
dialog: 53
scene_heading: INT. FRANKENBERG’S. EMPLOYEE CAFETERIA. DAY.
text: The employee Christmas party is in progress, which consists
dialog: of the same old lunch plus Christmas cookies, holiday music
text: and decorations. THERESE stands next to RUBY ROBICHEK in a
text: long line of staff. When it’s RUBY’S turn, the SERVER gives
text: RUBY double of everything in a food box. THERESE notices
text: this, and RUBY sees her notice.
speaker_heading: RUBY ROBICHEK
dialog: When you live alone, every penny
dialog: counts. You economize. You’1l
dialog: learn.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: How do you know I live alone?
speaker_heading: RUBY ROBICHEK
dialog: (very matter of fact)
dialog: You got that look.
text: THERESE and RUBY sit at a table. RUBY digs into her purse,
text: finds a slip of paper and pen, scribbles down her address and
text: telephone number and gives it to THERESE.
speaker_heading: RUBY ROBICHEK (CONT’D)
dialog: I know everything there is to know
dialog: about this place. I’1l fill you in.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I’m only here a few more days.
speaker_heading: RUBY ROBICHEK
dialog: Yeah? Where you going? Macy’s? I
dialog: knew it! You look like the type who
dialog: can go swanky.
dialog: 
text: This pleases RUBY and she digs into her lunch with gusto. A
text: silence. THERESE watches her eat. She watches everybody eat,
text: seemingly in unison. THERESE slides her tray over to RUBY.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: You take it. I don’t feel like
dialog: eating.
speaker_heading: RUBY ROBICHEK
dialog: You sure? This is good brisket.
text: THERESE nods. RUBY takes THERESE’S meal and shovels it into
dialog: her food box.
speaker_heading: RUBY ROBICHEK (CONT’D)
dialog: You're a good kid. I can get
dialog: through two, three days with this.
text: THERESE summons a smile in reply, at a loss for words.
speaker_heading: 54
scene_heading: EXT. MIDTOWN MANHATTAN. SAME DAY.
text: From a distance, we see CAROL'S car pull swiftly into a
text: parking space near FRED HAYMES’ law offices. CAROL gets out
text: of the car and walks briskly down the busy street into the
dialog: building.
scene_heading: INT. HAYMES LAW OFFICES. MOMENTS LATER.
text: FRED HAYMES, CAROL’S lawyer, is just returning to his office
text: when he catches CAROL delivering a small Christmas present to
text: his SECRETARY.
speaker_heading: CAROL SECRETARY
dialog: Merry Christmas, Katherine. Ohhh...
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: It’s nothing, I assure you. (looks
dialog: up) Well, there he is. Now will you
dialog: talk to me?
speaker_heading: FRED HAYMES
dialog: I didn’t want you to come all the
dialog: way down here-
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Just - give it to me, straight,
dialog: Fred. What am I not to worry about
dialog: until after the holiday?
text: They settle inside FRED’S office and FRED closes the door.
speaker_heading: FRED HAYMES
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Look, Jerry Rix served some papers
dialog: this morning. To my complete
dialog: surprise. Why don’t you sit down?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Why is it people think you’re going
dialog: to take bad news better if you’re
dialog: sitting down?
text: An awkward silence. FRED clears his throat.
speaker_heading: FRED HAYMES
dialog: Harge has sought an injunction
dialog: which denies you any access to
dialog: Rindy until the custody hearing.
dialog: And I'm afraid Harge has changed
dialog: his mind about joint custody. He
dialog: wants sole custody of Rindy.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: What?
dialog: 55
text: CAROL is stunned. She sits.
dialog: A silence.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: We've already reached an agreement
dialog: on custody. What is this all about?
speaker_heading: FRED HAYMES
dialog: They'll be filing papers on the
dialog: twenty-ninth in District Family
dialog: Court for the, uh, permanent
dialog: custody petition.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Can he do this? Is it - right?
speaker_heading: FRED HAYMES
dialog: I don’t know if it’s right, but
dialog: it’s legal.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: On what grounds.
speaker_heading: FRED HAYMES
dialog: (stalling)
dialog: Listen. Let’s - deal with this
dialog: after Christmas. You'll have a
dialog: chance to-
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (she interrupts him)
dialog: On. What. Grounds.
speaker_heading: FRED HAYMES
dialog: They're petitioning the judge to
dialog: consider a morality clause.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: A morality - what the hell does
dialog: that mean?
speaker_heading: FRED HAYMES
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: Okay. I won’t mince words with you.
dialog: Abby Gerhard.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Abby is Rindy’s godmother. Abby
dialog: is... (to herself, really) He's...
dialog: If he can’t have me, I can’t have
dialog: Rindy - That's...
speaker_heading: FRED HAYMES
dialog: I’m sorry. But they seem serious.
text: CAROL looks up to FRED, nods.
dialog: A silence.
dialog: 56
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: When’s the custody hearing?
speaker_heading: FRED HAYMES
dialog: It’s hard to say. With the holidays
dialog: and a backlog of cases...
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Your best guess, Fred.
speaker_heading: FRED HAYMES
dialog: Not before the middle of March.
dialog: Could be April.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Can I see her?
speaker_heading: FRED HAYMES
dialog: (not unkindly)
dialog: Not - let me put it this way - It
dialog: would not be advisable under the-
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: At school? In an office with a-?
speaker_heading: FRED HAYNES
dialog: The issue is not-
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Surely a visit supervised by a
dialog: teacher or a-
speaker_heading: FRED HAYNES
dialog: Carol, these are serious
dialog: allegations. Forcing contact before
dialog: the hearing you simply invite
dialog: further scrutiny concerning your
dialog: conduct.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: My conduct! Jesus Christ. I’m her
dialog: mother for God’s sake. (beat)
dialog: Morality clause. I see.
speaker_heading: FRED HAYNES
dialog: Do you.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: No. There’s nothing moral about
dialog: taking Rindy away from me.
text: CAROL looks back at him in a state of frozen disbelief.
dialog: 57
scene_heading: EXT. FIFTH AVENUE. SAME AFTERNOON.
text: CAROL reenters the street in a numbing daze. She passes
text: crowds of Christmas SHOPPERS with places to go and things to
text: do. She’s not one of those people. She finds herself walking
text: back in the direction of her car through the glare of winter
text: light. She puts a cigarette to her lips and begins searching
text: through her purse, struggling to find a light. Finally
text: glancing up she is struck by the sight of truck backing out
text: of the lot, and collides with a PEDESTRIAN clearing way.
speaker_heading: A VOICE
dialog: Watchit, lady!
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Pardon me.
text: CAROL turns into a shop window where she finally manages to
text: light her cigarette, taking several deep drags. Looking up
text: she focuses a moment on the display. It’s a vacation theme:
text: sunglasses on mannequins, cameras slung around their necks,
text: luggage stacked in artful piles. She lets her gaze fall on a
text: large two-tone brown leather suitcase.
scene_heading: INT. RECORD SHOP. EAST 50’S. SAME LATE AFTERNOON.
text: THERESE waits for a requested title at the front counter of a
text: midtown record store. The STORE CLERK returns with her
dialog: request: A Billie Holiday album, with “Easy Living”
text: prominently displayed on its cover.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Yes, that’s it, thank you.
text: She hands him a five-dollar bill and he begins ringing her
text: up. As she waits for her change, she spots two SHORT-HAIRED
text: WOMEN at the listening station, sharing a single pair of
text: headphones. The more mannish of the two, in horn-rim glasses,
text: leans against the railing dressed in tailored trousers and
text: jacket over a button-down shirt. The other wears a sleekly
text: tailored woman’s suit, very professional. They are obviously
text: a couple of some kind: New York lesbians. THERESE observes
text: them for a moment, until the woman in slacks looks over - and
text: THERESE quickly looks down.
scene_heading: EXT. RECORD SHOP. EAST 50’S.
text: RICHARD, waiting outside with his bike, turns to find THERESE
text: walking briskly out of the record shop.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Let’s walk. I want to drop this at
dialog: home.
dialog: 58
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Your wish is my command.
text: They start down the block toward THERESE’s apartment.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (CONT’D)
dialog: Find what you wanted?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: (no big deal)
dialog: Yeah... Something for someone at
dialog: the store.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You up for the jazz club later on?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Ohh, I don’t know.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: S'fine. (beat) But you should stop
dialog: by on Christmas sometime. My Mom’s
dialog: sort of planning on it.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Christmas... that’s for families.
dialog: I'd feel - I don’t know...
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You are family, Terry.
text: They turn down a small driveway, cutting through an empty
text: lot. THERESE tries to change the subject.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I'm thinking of putting together a
dialog: portfolio, you know, of my
dialog: pictures. Start taking portraits,
dialog: even. Apply for jobs. Maybe at a
text: newspaper. Maybe at the Times.
dialog: Dannie knows someone--
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Have you been thinking any more
dialog: about Europe? (no answer) Terry?
text: THERESE stops, brooding, and RICHARD stops and turns to her.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (CONT’D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: How many times have you been in
dialog: love?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (laughs, not sure where
dialog: this came from)
dialog: Whoa. Never. Until You.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Don’t lie. You told me about those
text: two other girls.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Come on. They were - I had sex with
dialog: them. That’s not the same thing.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Meaning... I’m different because we
dialog: haven't...(quietly) gone all the
dialog: way?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No, no - that’s not what I - hey,
dialog: what’s this all about? I love you.
dialog: That’s what’s different.
text: THERESE nods. They resume walking.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Have you ever been in love with a
dialog: boy?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (after a long beat)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: But you’ve heard of it?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Of course. I mean, have I heard of
dialog: people like that? Sure.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I don’t mean people like that. I
dialog: mean two people who just... fall in
dialog: love. With each other. Say, a boy
text: and a boy. Out of the blue.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I don’t know anyone like that. But
dialog: I‘1l tell you this - there’s always
dialog: some reason for it. In the
dialog: background.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: So you don’t think it could just -
dialog: happen to somebody, just - anybody?
dialog: 59
dialog: 60
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No. I don’t. What are you saying?
dialog: Are you in love with a girl?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: No.
text: They reach THERESE’S building. RICHARD leans his bike against
text: a railing, takes THERESE’S hands in his.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Don’t you know I want to spend my
dialog: life with you, Terry? Come to
dialog: France with me. Let’s get married.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Richard, I’m not - ready. For that.
dialog: I can’t make myself-
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What? Tell me.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I just... I have to go.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Terry.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: THERESE runs up the stairs to her building’s front door, and
text: is in before RICHARD can say another word.
scene_heading: INT. COCKTAIL BAR. SAME LATE AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING.
text: ABBY and CAROL sip martinis in silence at a favorite joint.
text: The brown two-tone suitcase CAROL saw in the shop rests
text: against the table.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I found Rindy’s hair brush
dialog: underneath my pillow this morning.
dialog: Full of her hair. She does that,
dialog: you know, to let me know she’s been
dialog: a good girl and brushed properly. I
dialog: usually clean it out but - today,
dialog: for some reason...
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: How could he. How dare he... A
dialog: morality what?
dialog: 61
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Clause, he said.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Carol - If I’m responsible in any
dialog: way-
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Don’t you dare - don’t you ever.
text: CAROL downs her drink. She pushes it towards ABBY for a
text: refill. ABBY refills for them both.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Hey. You know that tailor’s shop
dialog: that went bust in Hoboken?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Sure. The one with the - the -
dialog: glass thingy on the-
text: CAROL laughs.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Exactly. The glass thingy. That
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Bullshit. You have no idea what I’m
dialog: talking about.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You're right. But it’s good to hear
dialog: you laugh.
text: ABBY offers CAROL a cigarette, she takes it, ABBY lights it.
text: CAROL leans back in her chair, relaxes.
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway, the landlord offered me a
dialog: lease. I was thinking - another
dialog: furniture shop? I’1l need some help
dialog: with restorations every once ina
dialog: while, and you’re the varnish
dialog: master, SO...
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You're serious.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I’m serious. (beat) Couldn’t be any
dialog: more of a disaster than the shop we
dialog: had.
text: A silence. ABBY looks away from CAROL. CAROL leans in towards
dialog: her.
dialog: 62
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Hey. We weren’t a disaster. It
dialog: just...
text: CAROL doesn’t have the words.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I know. Timing. Never had it.
dialog: Anyway, I’ve got my eye on this
text: redhead who owns a steak house in
dialog: Paramus. I’m talking - serious Rita
dialog: Hayworth redhead.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Really? You think you have what it
dialog: takes to handle a redhead?
text: They share a naughty smile, thinking about serious redheads.
text: They toast. ABBY gestures to the suitcase.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You going somewhere?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: West, I was thinking... For a few
dialog: weeks. Until the hearing. What else
dialog: am I going to do?
dialog: A silence.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Well I know you don’t like driving
text: alone. So. (beat; ABBY takes a deep
text: breath, exhales) She's young.
text: CAROL nods her agreement: there’s no denying it.
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell me you know what you're doing.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I don’t. (silence) I never did.
scene_heading: INT. THERESE’S APARTMENT. SAME NIGHT.
text: Someone is knocking at Therese’s door.
text: THERESE sticks her head out of her bathroom and looks quickly
text: around the room. She hurries out, still brushing her hair and
text: fixing her blouse. As she walks to the door she quickly
text: stashes the Billy Holiday record under a pillow, and flips on
text: the phonograph (“Smoke Rings," Les Paul & Mary Ford begins to
text: play). She takes a last look at her freshly tidied apartment
text: and pulls opens the door.
text: It’s CAROL, the suitcase on the floor beside her.
dialog: 63
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Your landlady let me in.
text: CAROL lights a cigarette. THERESE can do nothing for a moment
text: but stare. Then THERESE catches sight of the suitcase, which
text: CAROL pushes across the threshold with her foot.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Merry Christmas. (beat) Open it.
text: THERESE bends down to open the suitcase. Inside is a brand
text: new camera and plenty of rolls of film.
scene_heading: INT. THERESE’S APARTMENT. LATER.
text: CAROL looks at THERESE’S photographs. She takes her time,
text: really examining them. THERESE watches without crowding her -
text: eager for her good opinion. CAROL comes to the photograph
text: THERESE took of her at the tree lot, hung on the wall. She’s
text: moved by it, by the primacy of place THERESE has given.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: It’s not that good. I was rushed, I
dialog: mean... I can do better.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: It’s perfect.
text: Leaning against the end-table, CAROL picks up a small photo
text: in its original cardboard frame: THERESE, aged 5, ata
dialog: convent school.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Is this you?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Yes.
text: CAROL puts it down, a bit abruptly, and steps into THERESE’S
text: kitchen sink/dark room.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Do you keep anything in the icebox
dialog: besides photo chemicals? I’m
dialog: feeling-
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Sure.
text: THERESE heads to the icebox, where she fishes out a couple of
text: beers. She turns back to find CAROL another step away,
text: fighting back tears.
text: THERESE is frozen for a moment, not knowing exactly what to
text: do. She approaches CAROL but hesitates, looking down at the
text: beers in her hand before setting them down on the counter.
dialog: 64
text: She proceeds gingerly, putting a tentative hand on CAROL’s
text: shoulder, squeezing it. Very quietly, still turned away,
text: CAROL breaks. She lowers her head as THERESE steps closer.
scene_heading: EXT. THERESE’S ROOF. NIGHT.
text: Sipping coffee from mugs, CAROL saunters along the perimeter
text: of the roof while THERESE sits on a perch, watching. It’s not
text: much of a view, but they can see the tips of the impressive
text: buildings, the lights, the cloudy night sky.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Is there any point in, I don’t
dialog: know... fighting it?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: The injunction? (beat) No.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Three months. I feel - useless.
dialog: Like I can’t help you or offer
dialog: anything-
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: It has nothing to do with you.
text: A pause. The remark stings THERESE, but she tries to conceal
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m going away for a while.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: When? Where?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Wherever my car will take me. West.
dialog: Soon.
text: THERESE can’t hide her dismay.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: And I thought... perhaps you’d like
dialog: to come with me.
text: A beat. CAROL looks directly at THERESE.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Would you?
text: A long, held moment before THERESE makes a decision.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Yes. Yes, I would.

scene_heading: INT. FRANKENBERG’S. EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM. CHRISTMAS EVE. DAY.

text: (some stockings, scarves, books) and putting them in her bag.
text: She separates her Frankenberg’s Employee Handbook and her
text: slightly bloody Santa cap and places them in the locker
text: shelf. Down at the other end of the locker room she hears
text: some girls approaching. Beyond them she spots RUBY ROBICHEK
text: seated on a bench, rolling up her calf-length stockings,

scene_heading: INT. THERESE’S APARTMENT. CHRISTMAS EVE. DAY.
text: THERESE and RICHARD at the kitchen table. THERESE’S clothes

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I don’t get it. I don’t get it,
dialog: Therese. Who is this woman to you?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: She’s a friend.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I’m your friend, Terry. Phil is
dialog: your friend - Dannie. This woman -
dialog: you don’t even know her.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: You can forward any mail to
dialog: Chicago, General Post, but I just
dialog: paid rent through February. I had a
dialog: little money saved up for the -
dialog: for...
text: RICHARD looks up at her sharply. THERESE looks away from him.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: For our trip. Our trip, Terry. And
dialog: now you’re - I don’t believe this
dialog: is happening!
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I can’t explain it. I just -
dialog: 66
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What? You’ve got one hell of a
dialog: crush on this woman is what...
dialog: You're like a schoolgirl!
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I do not - I just like her is all.
dialog: I like talking with her. I’m fond
dialog: of anybody I can really talk to.
text: This stings him, and they exchange a sharp look.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Nice. You know what I think? I
dialog: think two weeks from now you’1l be
dialog: wishing you... She’1l get tired of
dialog: you and you’1l wish you never-
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: -You don’t understand-!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I do - I understand completely.
dialog: You’re in a trance!
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I’m wide awake. I’ve never felt
dialog: more awake. (beat) Why don’t you
dialog: leave me alone?
text: THERESE has surprised herself with her boldness.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Are we over? Is that what this is?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I didn’t say that. But why should I
dialog: want to be with you if all you do
dialog: is argue about this?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: To say - to say for a minute you
dialog: practically want to say goodbye
dialog: because of some silly crush!
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I didn’t say that. You said it.
text: RICHARD grabs his jacket and starts out the front door.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You made me buy boat tickets, I got
dialog: a better job for you... I asked you
dialog: to marry me, for Chrissakes...

scene_heading: INT. THERESE’S APARTMENT BUILDING. HALLWAY. DAY.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I never made you - I never asked
dialog: you for - anything. Maybe that’s
dialog: the problem.
text: As he storms down the stairs, the LANDLADY sticks her head
text: out of her door, observing the row.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I swear to you, two weeks from now
dialog: you'll be begging me to forget this
dialog: ever-!
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Richard... Richard!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Have a great trip, Terry!
text: He storms out of the building as THERESE starts back to her

scene_heading: INT. THERESE’S APARTMENT. LATER.
text: BRIEF CLOSE-UPS: THERESE places clothes in her new suitcase.
text: She wraps CAROL’s gift. She composes CAROL’s gift card.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S HOUSE. GUEST ROOM. EARLY CHRISTMAS MORNING.
text: THERESE is roused from sleep with the sound of an approaching
text: car. She opens her eyes, taking in her surroundings - the
text: comfortable guest room at CAROL’S. She hears voices from
text: outside and turns to look out her window.
text: A fresh layer of snow has fallen and ABBY’S car has pulled up
text: the drive, top-down as usual. CAROL can be seen outside, with
text: a coat thrown over her robe.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Are you on your way to bed or just
dialog: getting up?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Both.
text: ABBY tries to stifle a laugh, doesn’t quite. CAROL puts a
dialog: finger to her lips: “shhh.”
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Go for a ride?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You nitwit.
dialog: 68
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Well, I had to come see you off,
dialog: didn’t I?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I’m not alone.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Uh-oh...
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (laughs, then)
dialog: Come in. There’s coffee.
text: ABBY hops out of the car.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S HOUSE. HALLWAY. MOMENTS LATER.
text: ABBY and CAROL enter the house.
speaker_heading: ABBY
text: This place is gloomy as a coal pit
dialog: in the mornings.
text: They see THERESE sitting at the top of the stairs in her
dialog: pajamas.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: We woke you. Go back to sleep, it’s
dialog: early...
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: That’s okay. Can I - come down?
text: ABBY stifles a snort. CAROL ribs her, good-naturedly. THERESE
text: guardedly watches the way the two interact.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Of course. There’s a robe in the
dialog: closet.
text: THERESE stands, and ABBY sizes her up.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: This is Abby Gerhard.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I have no manners.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Absolutely none.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: But it’s nice to meet you, Therese,
dialog: all the same.
dialog: 69
text: THERESE nods, smiling, then slips back down the hall.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S HOUSE. KITCHEN. LATER. DAY
text: ABBY is finishing preparing sandwiches which THERESE is
text: wrapping up.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Have you known Carol for a long
dialog: time?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: A pause while they work.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Did you ever take a trip? With
dialog: Carol, I mean?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Two or three.
text: THERESE can’t quite cover her slight frown. ABBY clocks this.
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: We had a furniture shop for a
dialog: couple years, outside Elizabeth. So
dialog: we were always on the prowl for
dialog: antiques or second-hand stuff.
text: She grabs a pack of cigarettes from the counter, lights one.
text: THERESE watches her. ABBY offers her a cigarette and a light.
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: You old enough to smoke?
text: A beat, before ABBY breaks a smile, and THERESE decides to
dialog: smile along.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Okay...
dialog: A beat, then:
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You know she’s got a lot of worries
dialog: right now... You know that, don’t
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: And she’s lonely.
dialog: 70
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Is that why she wants me to go with
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: No...
text: ABBY looks out a kitchen window, smokes.
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Just - don’t want to see her
dialog: getting hurt. That’s it.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I'd never hurt Carol. You think I
dialog: would?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: No. (she looks frankly at THERESE)I
dialog: don’t.
text: THERESE starts putting the food and drinks into a large
dialog: picnic basket.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: What happened to the furniture
dialog: store?
text: ABBY sighs. She suddenly looks a little sad to THERESE.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: It was... (resuming her chores):
dialog: Some things don’t work out, no
dialog: matter how much you want them to.
scene_heading: EXT. CAROL’S HOUSE. LATER. DAY.
text: THERESE and CAROL finish loading up the trunk and wiping the
text: last of the snow from the windshield. CAROL slams the trunk
text: lid shut, strides to the driver’s side, opens the door, gets
text: in. THERESE hurriedly removes the last of the snow from the
text: back windshield as CAROL starts up the car, revving the
text: engine. The hot exhaust creates a swirl of steam as a soft
text: spell of MUSIC rises. THERESE trots up to the passenger side
text: door, taking a last look around before jumping into the car.
scene_heading: INT CAROL’S CAR / EXT ROAD TO PENNSYLVANIA. LATER. DAY.
text: MUSIC continues over shots inside the car: THERESE pouring
text: coffee for CAROL from the thermos - piping hot and pre-
text: creamed. THERESE lighting two cigarettes and handing one to
text: CAROL, as they drive through the black and white of the snowy
text: thruway towards Philadelphia.
dialog: 71
scene_heading: INT. PHILLY DINER . LATER.
text: CAROL and THERESE eat tomato soup and crackers, virtually
text: alone in the dreary city diner. A few dismal strands of
text: tinsel and garland, strewn about for holiday effect, surround
text: a green and red cardboard banner which reads: MER Y CH TMAS.
text: THERESE puts aside her meal, gazes out of the window at the
text: largely deserted city streets.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I could get used to having a whole
dialog: city to myself.
text: THERESE turns to CAROL, who smiles in approval at THERESE’S
text: plan. THERESE can’t wait any longer, reaching under her seat
text: and producing her nicely wrapped gift for CAROL.
speaker_heading: THERESE (CONT’D)
dialog: For you. Merry Christmas.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: No - You shouldn’t have.
text: But CAROL is pleased, and THERESE is pleased that she’s
dialog: pleased.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Open it.
text: She watches CAROL unwrap the package. It’s the Billie Holiday
text: record with “Easy Living” on it.
speaker_heading: THERESE (CONT’D)
dialog: I played it for you. At your house.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I remember. (beat; she looks up at
dialog: THERESE) Thank you.
text: THERESE picks up her camera, focuses on CAROL, and snaps a
text: picture. CAROL brings her hands up to her face.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh God, I look a fright - don’t -
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: You do not, you look... (she leans
dialog: over and takes them back
dialog: down)wonderful... Just - stay like
dialog: that.
text: THERESE realizes she’s holding CAROL'S hands in her own. She
text: quickly looks around the diner, feeling slightly embarrassed,
text: but no one else is looking. CAROL clocks this, squeezing
text: THERESE’S hands and gently extricating herself.
dialog: 72
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Do you miss Richard?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: (she thinks about it)
dialog: No. I haven’t thought about him all
dialog: day. Or of home.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Home.
text: THERESE regrets using the word, watching CAROL’s mood darken,
dialog: slightly.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. PHILLY DINER. INNER PHILADELPHIA. LATER.
text: THERESE returns from the ladies room at the rear of the
text: diner, walking past a WOMAN IN HER THIRTIES gathering her
text: THREE YOUNG CHILDREN. At first THERESE doesn’t see CAROL,
text: then spots her through the window, at a pay telephone. She
text: sees her inserting her change and quickly dialing a number.
text: HEAR THE RINGS: Once. Twice. Three times. CAROL glances
text: toward the diner window. Through the glass one of the WOMAN’s
text: CHILDREN is making faces through the precipitation. Just
text: beyond is THERESE, paying the bill at the counter. CAROL
text: replaces the receiver in its cradle before the call can be
text: answered. THERESE turns to exit the diner and spots CAROL
text: smoking a cigarette.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. CAROL’S CAR. NIGHT.
text: CAROL drives. THERESE is sleeping, huddled up against the
text: passenger side window. A blanket partly covers her.
speaker_heading: RADIO V.O.
dialog: .»+-and that concludes our Holiday
dialog: Greetings from President-elect and
dialog: Mrs. Eisenhower. This is WOR-
dialog: Pittsburgh wishing you and yours-
text: CAROL takes one hand off the steering wheel and pulls up the
text: blanket so THERESE is covered.
scene_heading: EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY OUTSIDE OF PITTSBURGH. NIGHT
text: CAROL'S car glides along the empty road, behind it, the eerie
text: glow of the Pittsburgh industrial skyline, ahead of it: pitch
dialog: darkness.
dialog: 73
scene_heading: EXT. ABBY’S HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: We see HARGE rushing out of the rear door of his car, his
text: CHAUFFEUR idling, and rushing up the walk of a dark,
text: brickfront bungalow.
scene_heading: INT. ABBY’S HOUSE.
text: Ferocious banging on the front door as ABBY rushes down
text: stairs, tying up a robe as she goes. She opens the door. It’s
text: HARGE, in a state, breathing hard.
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: I have to speak to her.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What are you doing? - You're
dialog: supposed to be in Florida.
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: I couldn't do it. I had to - Rindy -
dialog: she wanted to see her mother on
dialog: Christmas. Not that it’s any of
dialog: your business. Just go get her. I
dialog: know she’s here.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You’ve got some fucking nerve
dialog: ordering me around. And, no. She’s
dialog: not here.
speaker_heading: HARGE
text: That’s impossible. She’s not home.
dialog: She’s not with me. She must be with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: Yeah, you know, Harge, you have a
dialog: point. You’ve spent ten years
dialog: making damned sure her only point
dialog: of reference is you, her only focus
dialog: in life is you, your job, your
dialog: friends, your family, your-
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: WHERE IS SHE. (beat; he composes
dialog: himself) She's still my wife, Abby.
dialog: I’m responsible for her.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Well, you know, that’s some way of
text: showing it, Harge - slapping her
dialog: with an injunction. I’m closing the
dialog: door.
dialog: 74
text: ABBY starts to close it but HARGE intercepts.
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: I love her.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I can’t help you with that.
text: ABBY quietly shuts the door. But each remains unmoving a
text: moment, in the dark.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL. OUTSIDE PITTSBURGH. DAY
text: THERESE is stepping out of her room with her suitcase,
text: dressed for the day. She walks over to the next room and
text: quietly knocks on the door.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Carol?
text: When there’s no answer, she tries the door. It’s open.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM. OUTSIDE PITTSBURGH. DAY
text: THERESE peeks her head into the room, to the sound of running
text: water from the bathroom. She sees CAROL’s overnight case is
text: open on her bed, her things spread about the room.
speaker_heading: CAROL (0.S.)
dialog: Therese, is that you?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: CAROL (0.S.)
dialog: Would you be a sweetie and fetch my
dialog: red knit sweater? It’s in the small
text: suitcase. Upper left hand side.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Okay.
text: THERESE finds the case, opens it. She takes a moment to look
text: at CAROL’S clothes in the case before she actually touches
text: them, feeling the fabrics, the silks and cashmeres, taking in
text: their powdery smells. Something at the bottom of the case
text: catches her eye. A glint of metal beneath some stockings. She
text: removes the stockings, revealing a small, pearl-handled
text: pistol. She reaches out, tentatively, to touch it, just as
text: CAROL calls out from the bathroom.
speaker_heading: O/S CAROL
dialog: Hey, slowpoke...
dialog: 75
text: THERESE quickly withdraws her hand and hurriedly replaces
text: CAROL'S clothing. She grabs the red sweater.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Found it.
text: THERESE takes the sweater to the bathroom door and knocks
text: lightly. The door opens, revealing CAROL standing there with
text: a towel wrapped around her. Steam filters out of the
text: bathroom. THERESE hesitates a moment, then hands her the
dialog: sweater.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Everything all right?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Yeah - I’m just - suddenly
dialog: starving.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (closing the door): I won't be a
dialog: minute.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S CAR. ON THE ROAD. DAY.
text: CAROL drives, looking out on the increasingly frozen
text: landscape. THERESE is grabbing a sandwich from a basket on
text: the back seat. CAROL’S packed suitcase rests beside it.
text: THERESE settles back into her seat.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Do you feel safe? With me, I mean?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: You're full of surprises.
text: THERESE continues thinking, eating her sandwich.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: But - Do you?
text: CAROL glances at her. THERESE holds her gaze. CAROL turns her
text: attention back to the road.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: It’s the wrong question.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: But you’d tell me. If something
dialog: scared you. And I could help.
text: CAROL shakes her head, smiles.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I’m not frightened, Therese.
dialog: 76
text: THERESE considers this, then glances back at CAROL, who peers
text: out at the open road, the cool winter sun skating across her
dialog: face.
scene_heading: EXT. MCKINLEY MOTEL. CANTON, OHIO. DUSK.
text: CAROL'S car pulls into the drive of a small motel with an
text: elaborate and large painted likeness of William McKinley on

scene_heading: INT. MCKINLEY MOTEL. CANTON, OHIO. DUSK.
text: The front desk of the blonde-wood hotel office. A very prim

speaker_heading: HOTEL MANAGER
dialog: Our standard rooms come equipped
text: with stereophonic console radios,
dialog: or if you prefer, the Presidential
dialog: Suite is available. At a very
dialog: attractive rate.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (thinks a moment, then)
dialog: Two standard rooms should be fine.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Why not take the Presidential
dialog: Suite?
text: CAROL and THERESE exchange a look.
speaker_heading: THERESE (CONT’D)
dialog: If the rate’s attractive...
scene_heading: EXT. MCKINLEY MOTEL. CANTON, OHIO. NIGHT.
text: THERESE at the ice dispenser. She’s bundled up in scarf,
text: gloves, overcoat - but wearing bunny slippers. She struggles
text: to fill an ice bucket, shivering.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Can I - hold that for you?
text: THERESE looks up. A tall, affable looking young man with
text: spectacles appears beside her, holding up the lid of the
text: dispenser while she fills her bucket.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Thank you. It’s cold.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: So cold my glasses'’ve fogged clear
dialog: over.
dialog: 77
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Thanks again. G’night.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Night.
text: He tips his hat to her and THERESE heads back to her room.
scene_heading: INT. MCKINLEY MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT.
text: True to its name, framed photographs of William McKinley and
text: his wife hang over the twin beds. Also adorning the suite, a
text: dressing table with a fan-shaped mirror, bedside cabinets,
text: gold-specked table lamps, striped wall paper. A record plays
text: on THERESE’s portable turntable, (”Easy Living (1933 version)”
text: by Billie Holiday). THERESE sits beside CAROL at the dressing
text: table as CAROL carefully applies mascara to THERESE’S lashes.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Don’t blink. (beat) Now look at
dialog: you.
text: CAROL turns THERESE around to the mirror.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I need lipstick.
text: CAROL chooses a lipstick, gives it to THERESE and watches as
text: THERESE applies it. CAROL hands THERESE a tissue. THERESE
text: blots, hands CAROL the tissue.
speaker_heading: THERESE (CONT’D)
dialog: Next?
text: CAROL picks up a perfume bottle, hands it to THERESE.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Would mademoiselle be so kind as to
dialog: apply at the pulse points only?
text: THERESE applies perfume to the inside of her wrists, the
text: crook of her arms, and her neck. She turns to CAROL. CAROL
text: holds out her wrists to THERESE.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Me, too.
text: THERESE applies perfume to the same spots on CAROL. CAROL
text: closes her eyes, arches her neck back slightly.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s divine. Smell that.
text: A beat, and THERESE leans forward to smell CAROL’S perfume.
dialog: 78
scene_heading: INT. MCKINLEY MOTEL ROOM. LATE NIGHT.
text: From her neighboring twin bed, THERESE watches CAROL sleep.
text: Very gently, she slips out of her bed and sits down silently
text: on the edge of CAROL'S bed, and watches her breath. She
text: quietly lifts a finger and lightly runs it along CAROL’S
text: cheek. CAROL turns over in her sleep. THERESE waits to be
text: sure CAROL won’t wake, then returns to her own bed.
scene_heading: INT. MCKINLEY MOTEL OFFICE. MORNING.
text: THERESE is seated in the improvised breakfast room, made up
text: of a few mismatched tables and chairs, and a paltry spread of
text: coffee, juice and rolls. She spots the YOUNG MAN from the ice
text: dispenser pouring himself a cup of coffee, carrying a large
text: black case. He spots THERESE and smiles broadly.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Good morning. Glad to see you
dialog: didn’t freeze over or nothing.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: You too.
text: Before she can even respond he’s setting down his cup and
text: pulling up a chair. THERESE spots CAROL arriving with a road-
text: map, making a beeline to the coffee.
speaker_heading: THERESE (CONT'D)
dialog: Not the best coffee I’m afraid.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Long as it’s hot.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: What’s in the case?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Oh. Notions. I’m a - I sell them.
dialog: Or try to.
text: CAROL arrives opposite Therese and plops down.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Lousy coffee.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: (surprised by her arrival)
dialog: Sorry- (he attempts to stand)
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: We were just chatting.

speaker_heading: THERESE

speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER

dialog: Pleased to meet you.
speaker_heading: THERESE
text: Mr. Tucker sells notions.
text: THERESE makes a gesture to his case, which CAROL regards.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER
dialog: (brief silence)
dialog: Don’t really know what notions are,
dialog: exactly. But they do instruct us to
dialog: use the word. Says it appeals to
dialog: women. So... (beat) I did sell a
dialog: shoe-horn yesterday to a feller in
text: Wheeling.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: (trying to help him out)
dialog: Do you sell lipstick?
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER
dialog: No. But I have a sewing kit. (beat)
dialog: You don’t need a sewing kit. I can
dialog: tell.
text: CAROL smiles politely, but returns her attention to the map.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (to THERESE)
dialog: We should make Chicago by five or
dialog: six, if we get an early start.
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER
dialog: That’s where I’m headed. There’s a
text: short cut across the interstates,
text: knocks two hours off the drive.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Two hours, that’s... That would be
dialog: great-—
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Can we stop to buy some magazines?
dialog: 80
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER
dialog: (reaching for his case)
dialog: I got Field and Stream... National
dialog: Geographic?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Popular Photography?
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER
text: (a beat as he smiles)
dialog: Nope. Course not. I am doomed to
dialog: remain without a sale.
text: THERESE throws a little smile to CAROL, as TOMMY shakes his
text: head. MUSIC picks up, carrying over the following scenes.
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN ROAD. LATER. DAY
text: The wide open road stretches out before us as CAROL'S car
text: comes gliding by.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S CAR. LATER. DAY
text: Inside, THERESE enjoys the sweet boredom of nothing but time
text: in CAROL'S company. She scans the radio dial.
scene_heading: (EXT. ROADSIDE. LATER. DAY
text: CAROL and THERESE, bundled in coats and scarves, sit on the
text: low branch of a tree, just off the road, sharing sandwiches
dialog: and thermos coffee. ]
scene_heading: EXT. DRAKE HOTEL. CHICAGO. NIGHT
text: The shimmering entrance to Chicago’s Drake Hotel is a swarm
text: of taxis, GUESTS and BELL-HOPS. CAROL and THERESE, bleary
text: from the road, come to a stop and begin quickly gathering
text: their things from the car.
scene_heading: INT. DRAKE HOTEL ROOM. LATER.
text: A BELLBOY carries CAROL and THERESE’S bags into an opulent
text: room. We hear CAROL tip and thank him as we follow THERESE
text: into her first encounter with hotel luxury. CAROL collapses
text: onto one of the beds.
speaker_heading: CAROL
text: Finally. A real bed. Heaven.
text: THERESE inspects the room like a detective. She bends to run
text: her hand through the carpet.
dialog: 81
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: This carpet - it feels like woven
dialog: silk! Like we shouldn’t be stepping
dialog: on it. And the furniture!
text: She turns to look at CAROL... fast asleep on the bed.
scene_heading: INT. DRAKE HOTEL. RESTAURANT. LATER.

speaker_heading: HOSTESS
dialog: Are you staying here at the hotel?

speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: 623. Mrs. Aird.
speaker_heading: HOSTESS
dialog: That’ll be just a moment, Mrs.
dialog: Aird.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Thank you.
text: Therese eyes the gifts and souvenirs at the counter: fancy

dialog: specialty Virginia ham.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Do you think something like this
dialog: would appeal to an older woman?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I suppose. Depends on the woman.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I worked with a woman at
dialog: Frankenberg’s - Ruby. But she
dialog: depressed me.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: She’s old. Alone. No money. It’s -
dialog: silly, I know.
dialog: 82
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I think it’s a lovely gesture. Send

dialog: Thank you.
text: Therese takes the form and pencil with her as they are led to
dialog: their table.
scene_heading: INT. CENTRAL POST OFFICE. PHONE BOOTH. CHICAGO. DAY.
text: CAROL in a phone booth placing a call. She can see THERESE
text: from the booth, who stands in line to collect general
dialog: delivery mail.
scene_heading: INT. CENTRAL POST OFFICE. CHICAGO. DAY. CONTINUOUS.
text: THERESE on line to pick up her mail. She looks around for
text: CAROL, spots her dialing in the phone booth...
scene_heading: INT. HARGE’S OFFICE. NEW YORK. DAY.
text: His private phone rings. He picks up.
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: Hargess Aird. Hello.
dialog: Nothing from the other end.
speaker_heading: HARGE (CONT'D)
dialog: All right, Carol. Enough is enough.
dialog: Now where are you, goddamnit?...
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: INT. CENTRAL POST OFFICE PHONE BOOTH. CHICAGO. DAY.
text: CAROL, suddenly unable to respond, leans her head against the
text: phone box a moment, then quietly hangs up the phone.
scene_heading: INT. CENTRAL POST OFFICE. CHICAGO. DAY.
text: CAROL joins THERESE at the post desk. THERESE has picked up a
dialog: few letters.
dialog: 83
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (refers to the letters)
dialog: Someone’s popular.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: All from Richard. (she puts the
dialog: letters in her bag) Aren't you
dialog: going to check your mail?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Nobody knows I’m here.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Were you... making a call?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: What? No - Ladies room.
text: Carol throws her scarf over her head and starts out. Therese
text: watches her a moment as she goes, then follows.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE SHORE DRIVE. CHICAGO. NEW YEAR’S EVE. DAY.
text: CAROL and THERESE stand at the side of the frozen road,
text: considering a flat tire. CAROL starts rummaging through her
text: purse when she looks up and hears a car coming.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Here’s one.
text: THERESE tries to flag down the approaching motorist for help.
text: A dark-colored ‘42 Chrysler Sedan slows to a stop and pulls
text: over ahead of them. The driver backs up, revealing it to be
text: TOMMY TUCKER, the notions salesman.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Well - what in the world. (to
dialog: Carol): Look who just...
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER
dialog: What do you know? I thought that
dialog: might be the two of you.
text: TOMMY hops out of his car and approaches the women. He
text: inspects the tire.
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER (CONT'D)
dialog: Yep, that’s a flat alright. Just
dialog: hope you didn’t dent that rim.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I felt something pulling, and then
dialog: a grinding-
dialog: 84
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER
dialog: Right. Well. Can I jack her up for
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: We - don’t think there is one.
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER
dialog: No jack?
speaker_heading: THERESE
speaker_heading: (glancing at CAROL)
dialog: We think it might have been left at
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Long story.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Bigger problem is, we think it
text: might be flat. The spare.
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER
dialog: Gotcha. Well... I got a jack. I can
dialog: jack her up for you. We just use my
dialog: spare.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: But what about you?
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER
dialog: Me I’m heading home from here - I
dialog: got plenty of spares back home.
dialog: (inspecting the flat)
dialog: Don’t think there’s rim damage.
dialog: Shouldn’t take too long I don’t
dialog: expect.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: There’s just... one other thing...
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER
dialog: What’s that, ma’am?
scene_heading: INT/EXT. TOMMY’S CAR. LAKE SHORE DRIVE. LATER. DAY.
text: In the front seat, THERESE offers CAROL some coffee from a
text: thermos. Radio softly plays. Up ahead, TOMMY leans over the
text: hood, his hands black from a lengthy operation.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I’m ravenous.
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 85
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: So am I.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (watching him work)
dialog: We're lucky we found him.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I’ll say.
speaker_heading: THERESE (CONT’D)
dialog: Are you sorry we came?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: On the trip? No. Are you?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: No.
text: They look up to the sound of CAROL’s car starting up again.
text: TOMMY climbs out of the drivers seat and approaches, dusting
text: himself off. CAROL and THERESE get out to meet him.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Wonderful!
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER
dialog: Well... It’ll get you to your next
dialog: stop, but you best get it checked
text: at a garage. New hose. They’1l tell
dialog: ya the same.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Thank you so much.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Tommy, what do we owe you.
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER
dialog: Oh, please - nothing at all, ma’am.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Well for the tire at least.
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER
dialog: No need. Like I said, I’ve got a
dialog: collection. Occupational hazard.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Well. Thank you. Again. For
dialog: everything.
dialog: 86
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER
dialog: You are surely welcome, ma’am.
text: CAROL starts off to the car, leaving an uncertain beat
text: between TOMMY and THERESE.
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER (CONT’D)
dialog: And Happy New Year.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Yes, that’s right. Happy New Year
dialog: to you.
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER
dialog: Yep, well, I’m counting on a big
text: night for sales. Stocking up on
dialog: hats and sparklers. I’m hopeful.
text: THERESE smiles as he back-steps, tips his hat and gets into
text: his car. She glances at CAROL, climbing into the car - and
text: feels a sudden surge of longing.
scene_heading: EXT. WATERLOO, IOWA. EARLY EVENING.
text: On the road leading into Waterloo, CAROL’S car speeds by a
text: billboard sign with a cartoon of Napoleon being strangled by
text: Nelson. In fancy script below the cartoon is written:
text: WATERLOO BECKONS. POP. 12,070. The sky is a deep red.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN. JOSEPHINE MOTOR LODGE. NIGHT.
text: Twin beds, quilted headboards, the usual. Radio tuned into
text: Guy Lombardo’s New Year’s Eve broadcast from the Waldorf
text: Astoria. It’s almost midnight. A couple of chipped plastic
text: trays carrying the remnants of some ham and cheese sandwiches
text: are set on one of the beds. CAROL sits sipping beer from a
text: Champagne flute, her hair wrapped in a towel. Each dressed in
text: robes, CAROL watches THERESE brush out her hair at a dressing
text: table. The countdown to the New Year begins on the radio.
text: Five. Four. Three. Two. One: HAPPY NEW YEAR! And the familiar
text: Lombardo signature “Auld Lang Syne” begins, but neither woman
text: takes notice. Instead CAROL gets up from the bed, takes the
text: brush from THERESE and begins to brush THERESE’S hair,
text: slowly, carefully. When she’s done, she puts the brush down
text: and turns THERESE around to face her.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Happy New Year.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Happy New Year.
text: They face each other in silence, listening to the faraway
dialog: radio broadcast - a moment when anything could happen.
dialog: 87
text: THERESE, for the first time, reaches out ever so slightly to
text: brush her fingers against CAROL’S. CAROL looks down at their
text: fingertips touching.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Harge and I never spend New Year’s
dialog: Eve together. There’s always a
dialog: business function, always clients
dialog: to entertain.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I’ve always spent it alone. In
dialog: crowds. (beat) I’m not alone this
dialog: year.
text: THERESE squeezes CAROL'S hand ever so slightly. The Guy
text: Lombardo band strikes up a bright New Year’s tune.
text: CAROL unties her robe and lets it fall open, revealing her
text: nakedness to THERESE. It’s so still, it’s as if all breath in
text: the room were suspended. THERESE stands up to join her, and
text: CAROL takes her face gently in both her hands. She kisses
text: THERESE’S lips. It’s a wondrous kiss for them both, slow and
text: unhurried. Afterwards, CAROL removes her hands from THERESE’S
text: face and eases off the towel from her head.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: For everything that might happen.
dialog: Later.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: Take me to bed.
text: CAROL moves towards THERESE, takes her in her arms, leads her
text: to the bed.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Lie down.
text: THERESE does. CAROL lets her own robe drop to the floor then
text: opens THERESE’s robe on the bed, taking in her youthful
dialog: beauty.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: I never looked like that.
text: She climbs onto the bed and straddles THERESE. She strokes
text: her face, her hair. THERESE closes her eyes, but begins to
text: tremble involuntarily.
dialog: 88
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: You're trembling.
text: CAROL leans down to kiss her lightly on the forehead, then
text: reaches across the bed to shut off the light. THERESE stops
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Don’t. I want to see you.
text: CAROL nods, then slides down THERESE’S body and stops just
text: below THERESE’S navel. She kisses her belly, moves down
text: THERESE’S body with her mouth. THERESE looks up at the
text: ceiling, trying to quell her body’s shuddering of nerves. She
text: closes her eyes. CAROL slides up THERESE’S body and plays
text: with one of THERESE’S nipples with the tip of her tongue.
text: THERESE moans softly. She pulls CAROL up to her mouth and
text: they kiss eagerly, passionately. THERESE opens her eyes and
text: regards CAROL’S face, so close to hers, and smiles.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: My angel. Flung out of space.
text: They begin to make love for the very first time.
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
scene_heading: INT. CABIN. JOSEPHINE MOTOR LODGE. DAY
text: Morning light filters through the drawn curtains as THERESE,
text: still in bed, watches CAROL packing up for the day ahead. But
dialog: suddenly, this day, everything in the world is different.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: What town are we in?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: This? Waterloo. Isn’t that awful?
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE. JOSEPHINE MOTOR LODGE. LATER.
text: The deserted office is strewn with empty beer bottles and
text: cheap New Year’s decoration. CAROL looks around for a clerk,
text: rings the desk bell. An ANCIENT WOMAN shuffles on out of the
text: back room. She wears a party hat.
speaker_heading: ANCIENT WOMAN
dialog: You the folks in thirteen?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: We're checking out.
speaker_heading: ANCIENT WOMAN
dialog: Telegram come for you last night.
dialog: 89
text: The ANCIENT WOMAN shuffles on out of the room and comes back
text: with a telegram. She gives it to CAROL. CAROL opens the
dialog: telegram. Reads it. It’s not good news.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: When did this arrive?
speaker_heading: ANCIENT WOMAN
dialog: I ain’t a clock, lady. Early.
dialog: Seven. Nine.
scene_heading: EXT. JOSEPHINE MOTOR LODGE. MORNING.
text: CAROL storms out of the office, tearing past the patchy
text: remains of snow, where THERESE is loading the car with their
text: belongings. CAROL pulls open the driver's side door,
text: searching for something she doesn’t see, and slams the door
text: shut. She runs up to the cabin they just vacated and tears
text: open the door, almost immediately comes out again, slamming
text: shut the door. She’s furious.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Carol! What the hell-
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (focusing on THERESE)
dialog: Where's my suitcase?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Carol - wait a minute - what’s
dialog: going on?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (she snaps)
dialog: I want my fucking suitcase.
text: CAROL storms over to the trunk, brushing past THERESE on the
text: way. She finds her suitcase, flings it open and starts
text: rifling through it. She finds the pistol. THERESE tries to
text: block her way.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: What are you doing with that? Carol
dialog: - what happened?!
text: CAROL pushes past THERESE.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. CABIN. JOSEPHINE MOTOR LODGE. MORNING.
text: CAROL kicks at the door of the cabin next to their’s.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Open up in there! You hear me?
dialog: Right now!
dialog: 90
text: THERESE runs up to the door to join CAROL.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Carol, you're scaring me, you can’t-
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Stand out of the way, Therese.
text: Carol reaches for the door and finds it unlocked. She kicks
text: the door open and takes aim. TOMMY TUCKER stands inside
text: getting dressed, trousers half on, half off. He wears his
text: hat. He grabs his spectacles off a table and slips them onto
text: the end of his nose. On the unmade bed before him is his big
text: black case, opened to reveal an elaborate reel-to-reel tape
text: recorder and sophisticated microphones. THERESE stares at the
text: equipment, uncomprehending. CAROL cocks her pistol and
text: assumes the shooting stance, aiming directly at TOMMY’S head.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (CONT'D) (to TOMMY)
dialog: Where’s the tape, you sonofabitch.
text: She enters the room, starts pulling apart the case, the
text: equipment, all the while keeping the pistol aimed at TOMMY.
text: TOMMY continues to dress himself, rather calmly.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D) (CONT'D)
dialog: How much is Harge paying you for
dialog: this? I’1l give you double, triple.
dialog: Anything you want.
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER
dialog: I wish I could oblige you, ma‘am.
text: But the tape is already on its way
dialog: to your husband.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: That can’t be right.
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: My reputation rests on my
dialog: efficiency, Mrs. Aird.
text: A tense pause. CAROL moves towards TOMMY. He remains quite
text: calm, still. But he keeps his eye on her all the while. CAROL
text: advances closer, aiming the pistol at his head.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: How do I know you’re not lying?
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: You don’t, ma’am.
dialog: 91
text: CAROL tenses up, putting her index finger on the trigger. All
text: at once she whirls around to the recording equipment, points
text: the gun to it, and pulls the trigger - but the gun just
text: clicks. She tries again, but the trigger jams. In utter
text: frustration she hurls the gun at the recording equipment.
text: THERESE, who’s been hovering by the door, moves towards
speaker_heading: CAROL.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Carol...
text: CAROL, exhausted and distraught, gives THERESE the telegram
text: and moves outside of the cabin. She slumps against the
dialog: railing.
text: THERESE exchanges a look with TOMMY, who’s still cool as a
text: cucumber. THERESE retrieves the gun, joins CAROL outside.
text: CAROL lights a cigarette, looks out towards the highway.
text: THERESE reads the telegram, then looks up through the door to
text: TOMMY, still standing half dressed in his cabin.
speaker_heading: THERESE (CONT’D)
speaker_heading: (to TOMMY)
dialog: How could you.
speaker_heading: TOMMY TUCKER
dialog: I am a professional, Miss Belivet.
dialog: It’s nothing personal.
text: A silence. CAROL smokes, THERESE shakes her head at TOMMY,
text: disgusted, not wanting to believe this is happening. TOMMY
text: tips his hat to THERESE.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Let’s get out of here.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY. WATERLOO. LATER.
text: THERESE, carrying pistol and telegram, finds some trash bins
text: in an alley. She lifts the lid on one and tosses the pistol
text: into it, but it lodges on top. She buries it with one hand,
text: and does her best to clean it off with the telegram. She
text: tosses back the lid and hurries back to the street, rounding
text: the corner. There she finds CAROL at a pay phone. She steps
text: back instinctively, but overhears the end of CAROL’S call to
speaker_heading: ABBY.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: +. earliest flight into LaGuardia
dialog: is tomorrow afternoon... Oh Abby, I
dialog: don’t know how to fix this - I
dialog: haven't the strength...
text: THERESE wishes she could hold CAROL in her arms at this
text: moment. But she knows she can’t.
dialog: 92
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S CAR. EARLY EVENING.
text: CAROL drives in silence as they approach Chicago. THERESE
dialog: smokes a cigarette. You could cut the tension with a knife.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You shouldn’t smoke. You'll get a
dialog: cough. (silence) What are you
dialog: thinking?... You know how many
dialog: times a day I ask you that?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I’m sorry. What am I thinking? I’m
dialog: thinking that I am utterly selfish.
dialog: And I-
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Don’t do this. You had no idea. How
dialog: could you have known?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I - I should have said no to you.
dialog: But I never say no. And it’s
dialog: selfish because I take -
dialog: everything. Because I don’t know -
dialog: anything. I don’t - know what I
dialog: want. How could I if I just say yes
dialog: to everything?
text: THERESE begins to cry, softly. CAROL pulls over to the side
text: of the road, against a frozen bank of snow. She turns THERESE
text: towards her. She dries her tears. CAROL and THERESE regard
text: each other, calmly, steadily.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I took what you gave willingly.
text: A pause. CAROL runs a finger along THERESE’S cheek. She turns
text: back to the wheel. Restarts the car.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s not your fault, Therese -
dialog: Alright?
text: More silence. CAROL, at a loss to make the situation better,
text: accelerates quickly onto the highway.
scene_heading: INT. DRAKE HOTEL. CHICAGO. NIGHT.
text: CAROL is finishing a call with ABBY, sitting on one of the
text: twin beds, smoking. THERESE emerges from the bathroom,
text: switching off the light. She stands for a moment in the dark
text: before she climbs into the other bed.
dialog: 93
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Thank you, pet... Oh, you know.
dialog: Shattered. Sickened... I hope so...
dialog: No... Talk tomorrow... And thank
dialog: you... I will. Night.
text: She hangs up the phone and looks down a moment. Then she
text: turns to THERESE with a sad tenderness.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: You don’t have to sleep over there.
text: Silence. THERESE gets up, joins CAROL in the other bed. CAROL
text: wraps her arms and legs around THERESE, kissing her gently on
text: the eyes, the lips. THERESE looks at her deeply and then
text: kisses her back, a long, lingering, searching kiss.
scene_heading: INT. DRAKE HOTEL. CHICAGO. MORNING.
text: A ribbon of daylight over THERESE’s face. Eyes still shut,
text: she reaches out for CAROL, but CAROL’S not there. No sound
text: coming from the bathroom. She lifts her head and checks the
text: clock: 8 AM. THERESE sits up in the bed. There, seated in an
text: armchair in the semi-darkness, is ABBY. She smokes a
text: cigarette. And all at once THERESE understands what CAROL'S
dialog: absence means. Silence.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: She’s gone?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Early this morning.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Is she coming back?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: No.
text: Piercing silence.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: This is all my fault.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Nonsense.
text: ABBY puts out her cigarette, gets up and pulls open the
text: curtains. Cold, bright sunlight streams into the room.
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: We should get going.
dialog: 94
scene_heading: INT. ROADSIDE DINER OUTSIDE OF CHICAGO. DAY.
text: THERESE stares out the window; she hasn’t touched her meal.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Eat something. (no response) Suit
dialog: yourself.
text: ABBY slides THERESE’S plate to her side of the table and
text: starts finishing it. THERESE turns to her.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Why don’t you like me? I’ve never
dialog: done anything to you.
text: A pause. ABBY starts to say something, thinks better of it.
text: She leans in towards THERESE.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You really think I’ve flown halfway
dialog: across the country to drive you
dialog: back East because I hate you and
dialog: want to see you suffer?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: It’s for Carol. Not for me.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: That’s - If you really believe that
dialog: then you’re not as smart as I
dialog: thought you were.
text: Therese takes this in, then looks up at Abby. Silence.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: With you and Carol... what
dialog: happened?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: It’s completely different - I’ve
dialog: known Carol since I was 10 years
dialog: old...
dialog: (after a long beat)
dialog: It was... back when we had the
dialog: furniture store. Late one night. My
dialog: Ford broke down near my Mother’s
dialog: house and... We tried to stay up,
dialog: but... curled up together in my old
dialog: twin bed. And that was it... Fora
dialog: while. And then it changed. It
dialog: changes. Nobody’s fault. (beat)
dialog: So...
text: She opens her purse and searches inside. She produces an
dialog: envelope.
dialog: 95
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Here - she...
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: What?
text: ABBY hands her a letter.
scene_heading: EXT. ROADSIDE DINER. MOMENTS LATER.
text: In a WIDE lonely frame we see THERESE has stepped outside the
text: diner to tear open the letter. As she reads, we hear CAROL'S
dialog: voice:
speaker_heading: CAROL (V.0.)
dialog: Dearest. There are no accidents and
dialog: he would have found us one way or
dialog: another. Everything comes full
dialog: circle. Be grateful it was sooner
dialog: rather than later. You’1l think it
dialog: harsh of me to say so, but no
dialog: explanation I offer will satisfy
dialog: you.
text: We see ABBY leave the diner as THERESE continues reading. She
text: climbs in the car and starts the engine. A soft undertone of
text: MUSIC has emerged.
scene_heading: INT. ANOTHER MOTEL. NIGHT.
text: ABBY in the bathroom, washing out some clothes. Through a
text: crack in the door, she spots THERESE, seated on the bed,
text: drained by tears, expressionless.
speaker_heading: CAROL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Please don’t be angry when I tell
dialog: you that you seek resolutions and
dialog: explanations because you’re young.
dialog: But you will understand this one
dialog: day.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY.
text: ABBY pulls the car off the road near a small grove of trees
text: and fading clumps of snow. THERESE jumps out, makes for the
text: trees and tries to hide herself before she throws up. ABBY
text: lights a cigarette and remains in the car, watching THERESE
text: from a distance.
speaker_heading: CAROL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And when it happens, I want you to
dialog: imagine me there to greet you like
dialog: the morning sky, our lives
text: stretched out ahead of us, a
dialog: perpetual sunrise.
dialog: 96
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S CAR. NIGHT.
text: ABBY, at the wheel, glances in the rear-view-mirror at
text: THERESE, stretched out asleep on the back seat of the car.
text: Distant passing lights comb over her repose.
speaker_heading: CAROL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: But until then, there must be no
dialog: contact between us. I have much to
dialog: do, and you, my darling, even more.
dialog: Please believe that I would do
dialog: anything to see you happy and so I
dialog: do the only thing I can - I release
dialog: you.
scene_heading: INT. THERESE’S APARTMENT. NEW YORK. DAY.
text: THERESE, in her overcoat, suitcase beside her, stands in the
text: middle of her apartment. It’s full of her things, but it
text: looks like a foreign land. All the photographs on the wall
text: seem as if they were taken by someone else.
scene_heading: INT. THERESE’S APARTMENT. THAT SAME NIGHT.
text: THERESE hunches over her sink, bathed in red light. She takes
text: a quick deep drag of a cigarette, burning in an ashtray. Rows
text: of negatives hang from hooks underneath the kitchen
text: cupboards, over the trays of chemicals. She finds a certain
text: shot on the enlarger, marks it, and focuses. She begins the
dialog: process of developing the print.
text: Finally, she watches the photo in its bath slowly appear - a
text: shadow here and there, a shape forming - and it’s CAROL,
text: asleep on her back, her body akimbo in a tumble of sheets,
text: one hand resting delicately.
scene_heading: INT. THERESE’S APARTMENT BUILDING. HALLWAY. LATE NIGHT.
text: THERESE is creeping down the half-lit stairway. She picks up
text: the phone without making a sound and stares at the dial. She
text: hangs up. Then in one continuous gesture she picks it up
text: again and dials the number. She stands frozen. One long ring.
text: Silence. Another long ring. Then someone picks up the line.
text: But there’s silence on the other end.
text: Nothing. THERESE is frozen.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Hello? (beat) Carol?
text: The silence that follows is like an answer. THERESE holds the
dialog: receiver close: a precious thing.
dialog: 97
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.
text: CAROL in the dark, on the other end, still. She makes a
text: movement as if to say something, but doesn’t. We see her
text: finger softly graze the receiver button before pressing it
dialog: down.
scene_heading: INT. THERESE’S APARTMENT BUILDING. HALLWAY PHONE. NIGHT.
text: Extremely CLOSE on THERESE hearing CAROL disconnect, but
text: holding on in the void.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: (prayerful)
dialog: I miss you. I miss you.
scene_heading: INT. HARGE’S PARENTS HOUSE. NEW JERSEY. DAY.
text: HARGE, CAROL, JENNIFER and JOHN are seated together for a
text: weekday lunch, with everything distinctly in its place.
text: Eisenhower's inauguration proceedings can be heard and
text: glimpsed on the living room television set.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: More mashed potatoes, Carol?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Yes - Thanks. They’re delicious.
text: CAROL reaches over to take the bowl of mashed potatoes, but
text: HARGE gets to it first, spoons some out for CAROL. The
text: atmosphere is polite, but far from relaxed.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you. (beat) I thought...
dialog: perhaps... Chester and Marge would
dialog: be here by now. With Rindy...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Marge said to go ahead, not to
dialog: wait.
speaker_heading: HARGE
speaker_heading: (to CAROL)
dialog: I’m sure they’1l be here soon.

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Harge tells us you’ve been getting
dialog: along quite well with your doctor,
dialog: Carol.
dialog: 98
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: And why shouldn’t she be getting on
dialog: well. He’s a very expensive doctor.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: He’s actually not a doctor but a
dialog: psychotherapist.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Well he comes very well regarded.
speaker_heading: JOHN
speaker_heading: (to HARGE)
dialog: A Yale man, like your uncle.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (ever so slightly edgy)
dialog: But that doesn’t make him a doctor.
text: HARGE throws her a little look.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: I do like him. Very much. He’s been
dialog: a great help.
text: JENNIFER and JOHN continue eating in silence.
scene_heading: INT. HARGE’S PARENTS HOUSE. LATER.
text: CAROL sits alone near the living room window, caught in a
text: stare. She’s jolted out of it by the sound of JENNIFER,
text: approaching with a cup of tea. CAROL turns.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Thank you Jennifer, but I’m fine,
dialog: really-
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: It‘ll calm your nerves.
text: JENNIFER sets it down on a small end table, and places a hand
text: on CAROL’s shoulder. Just then we hear the sound of a car
text: coming up the drive.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: They’re here.
text: CAROL rises, gives her hair a quick pat and starts off toward
dialog: the door.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Just a moment, dear.
text: CAROL stops, turns. JENNIFER walks over to where CAROL stands
text: her and adjusts her collar.
dialog: 99
text: CAROL manages to maintain composure, then turn from JENNIFER
text: and continues on to the door.
scene_heading: EXT. HARGE’S PARENTS HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING.
speaker_heading: CONTINUOUS.
text: CAROL runs to greet RINDY, who walks hand-in-hand with a
text: MIDDLE AGED COUPLE, RINDY’S AUNT AND UNCLE. When she sees her
text: Mother, RINDY lets go of their hands and runs towards CAROL.
text: They meet. CAROL kneels down and sweeps RINDY into her arms.
text: She hugs her tightly, holding on for dear life.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Oh baby... my baby girl...
scene_heading: INT. THERESE’S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON.
text: DANNIE is over, helping THERESE repaint her apartment.
text: THERESE is on a ladder, painting some molding near the
text: ceiling and DANNIE is below. As the RADIO plays ("Lullaby of
text: Birdland” by Georges Shearing), DANNIE spots THERESE wiping
text: sweat from her brow. They’ve clearly been at it a while.
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: I think it’s break time. Let me
dialog: fetch some brews.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Sounds good.
text: DANNIE goes to the kitchen to grab some beers and an opener.
text: THERESE has been developing more photos - almost all of them
text: pictures of CAROL from their trip. DANNIE can’t help but take
dialog: a look.
text: He hears something behind him and turns. It’s THERESE.
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: These are seriously good. I mean,
dialog: they really capture - whoever this
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: They're just practice.
text: THERESE crosses the room and begins picking up the pictures,
text: tidying the area.
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: You really should put together a
dialog: portfolio. Say the word, I’1l
dialog: introduce you to my pal at the
dialog: Times. There’s always a clerk job
dialog: going.
dialog: 100
text: THERESE shakes her head, takes the pictures into the other
text: room and s pulls open a drawer to stash them in.
speaker_heading: DANNIE (CONT’D)
dialog: You went away with her, right?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: So what happened?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Ohh. Nothing. It’s - hard to...
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Is it because I tried to kiss you
dialog: that day? Because if it is, don’t
dialog: even think about that, I mean,
dialog: don’t be afraid of-
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I’m not afraid.
text: THERESE is stopped a moment by her own words, reminding her
text: of another time and place. She looks back at him.
speaker_heading: THERESE (CONT’D)
dialog: Let’s finish while we still have
dialog: light, okay?
text: DANNIE shrugs and they get back to work.
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: I still think you should put
dialog: together that portfolio.
scene_heading: INT. THERESE’S APARTMENT. LATE NIGHT.
text: THERESE sits on her kitchen floor sorting photographs, a
text: cigarette burning in an ashtray beside her. She’s busy
text: placing them into neat piles. We see her older work -
scene_heading: LANDSCAPES, STILL LIFE’S, ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS - and all her
text: newer work - PHOTOS OF KIDS PLAYING IN THE STREET, OLD WOMEN
text: DRAGGING SHOPPING CARTS, CITY FACES - virtually all of them
text: depicting people. At the bottom of one pile she discovers the
text: picture of CAROL BUYING THE XMAS TREE. She considers it a
text: moment before pulling it out of the stack.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK. A FEW DAYS LATER. AFTERNOON.
text: It’s a gray, rainy day at the park. Walkers with umbrellas.
text: RICHARD has brought THERESE a box of her belongings.
dialog: 101
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Everything's there. (beat) My
dialog: mother washed and ironed your
dialog: blouses.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Thank her for me?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You can thank her yourself.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Richard...
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What do you expect me to say? I
dialog: mean... You never even wrote-
text: THERESE looks away.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I tried, I just... I couldn’t find
dialog: the words.
text: She tries to touch his shoulder, he moves away from her.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Please don’t touch me. (he shakes
dialog: his head). After what we had -
dialog: after what you did... Throwing it
dialog: all away.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: What did we have?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Thanks, that’s...
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: No - tell me!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You tell me, Terry. Did you - did
dialog: you love me even a little?
text: They hold a look, but THERESE can’t hurt him like this. She
text: turns away.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Please, please don’t hate me. I’m
dialog: still... me. Still the same person
dialog: I always was.
dialog: 102
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No. You’re not, alright? You’re
dialog: someone else now. And I can’t. I
dialog: can’t forgive you. (beat) So long,
dialog: Terry.
text: A beat, before RICHARD leaves. THERESE doesn’t move.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S HOUSE. DUSK.
text: CAROL sits in the lantern seat off her stairway, looking out
text: at the night. From down below she hears the RADIO REPORT
text: blaring on, announcing the death of Stalin.
text: The radio is lowered and CAROL looks down. She sees Abby
text: starting up the stairs with two cups of coffee. CAROL starts
text: down to meet her.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Stay. Stay.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Don’t be silly.
text: She takes her cup from ABBY and starts back up to her seat.
text: CAROL returns to where she was sitting and ABBY sits on the
text: stairs below her. ABBY can read CAROL’s despondency from a
text: mile away.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t know if I can do it, Abby.
dialog: What more can I do? How many more -
dialog: tomato aspic lunches... just to
dialog: come home every night without her.
dialog: To this!
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: And... Therese?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: What about her?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Have you - heard anything?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Oh no. No. It’s been over a month
dialog: since she tried to call. Nothing
dialog: since then. I wish I...
dialog: (but she stops, then):
dialog: Have you? Heard anything?
dialog: 103
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: From Therese? No. (beat) She must
dialog: have started her job at the Times,
dialog: though. That’s something.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I should have said: Therese. Wait.
text: ABBY reaches out, puts a hand on CAROL’S foot. All at once a
text: pair of headlights swing by, lighting up the windows, and
text: they are jolted. CAROL turns and ABBY stands, startled. A
dialog: look between them: is someone here? Is this trouble? And then
text: the headlights disappear.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Who the hell is turning around in
dialog: my drive?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I should go.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You don’t have to-
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: -I do.
text: ABBY squeezes CAROL’S hand - courage. And they start down the
dialog: stairs together.
scene_heading: EXT. HUDSON RIVER PIER. NEW YORK. NIGHT.
text: DANNIE and THERESE sit together on the pier, looking across
dialog: the river to New Jersey.
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: I’m glad you called... I never see
dialog: you no more! Now that you’ve got
dialog: the fancy job with the smooth
dialog: hours. You punch out, I punch in.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: It doesn’t feel fancy, hauling
text: gallon jugs of developer all day.
dialog: But I kind of love it, you know?
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: Sure. (beat) Hey - guess what
dialog: happened to me? No? Can’t think of
dialog: it?
text: THERESE smiles, shakes her head.
dialog: 104
speaker_heading: DANNIE (CONT’D)
dialog: I met a girl. Louise. She’s got
dialog: green eyes, she’s a movie
dialog: encyclopedia, and the most amazing
dialog: thing? She thinks I’m boss.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: (she’s pleased for DANNIE)
dialog: Go figure.
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: (he’s pleased she’s
dialog: Pleased)
dialog: Yeah. (beat) If you want, we can
dialog: all hang out some night. Go to a
dialog: movie.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: That sounds swell. I’d love to meet
dialog: her. (pause) Did, uh - Have you
dialog: seen Richard?
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: I seen him. (beat) Think he wanted
dialog: to talk, maybe. But I, uh... I
dialog: don’t know. I feel bad for him. But
dialog: I don’t wanna get-
text: He stops, glancing up at THERESE, then looking away.
text: THERESE’s thoughts seem to harden and a brief darkness falls
text: over her.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Use what feels right. Throw away
dialog: the rest.
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Where’d that come from?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Something Carol once said to me.
speaker_heading: DANNIE
dialog: (a beat, then: )
dialog: Did she... do that? To you?
dialog: THERESE struggles for this...
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I can’t - go. Back. To that place.
dialog: Where you keep it all locked up...
dialog: the sadness, shame... You let
dialog: people down. You let yourself -
dialog: down. So you cry and you... hide
dialog: and think - things, constantly,
dialog: crazy things, like...
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 105
speaker_heading: THERESE (CONT'D)
dialog: if you stare at the phone long
dialog: enough or - take a train and
dialog: just... lurk... it could all...
dialog: return. (silence) And then one day
text: the phone is just a phone. A train
dialog: going to Jersey is just a train to
dialog: Jersey. You stop - crying and
dialog: hiding. And you know you’re able to
dialog: use things and throw them away.
text: The river looks like a swath of black cellophane.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO
scene_heading: INT. PHIL’S APARTMENT. NIGHT. (APRIL 1953)
text: THERESE sits on the edge of the bathtub next to the open
text: window, taking in the air. She can hear the party in
dialog: progress, people having a great time, but she’s not ready to
text: rejoin them. A couple of RAPID KNOCKS on the door.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Sorry. Just a second.
text: THERESE gathers herself, gets up, opens the door. It’s
text: GENEVIEVE. She wears her coat and scarf.
speaker_heading: THERESE (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh. You’re leaving.
speaker_heading: GENEVIEVE
dialog: Just about. Will you miss me?
text: THERESE doesn’t look away from GENEVIEVE this time. GENEVIEVE
text: moves closer to THERESE, whispers in her ear.
speaker_heading: GENEVIEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen, Therese. There’s an intime
dialog: gathering, quite exclusive you
dialog: understand, later on. At my place.
dialog: (beat) Quick. Show me your hand.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: You a fortune teller?
speaker_heading: GENEVIEVE
dialog: I’m a fortune giver.
text: GENEVIEVE takes THERESE’S hand, writes her address in ink
text: onto THERESE’S palm.
speaker_heading: GENEVIEVE (CONT’D)
dialog: So you don’t forget.
dialog: 106
text: And GENEVIEVE'S off. THERESE watches her wind her way to the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: RETURN TO:
scene_heading: FLASHBACK: EARLIER THE SAME DAY, MID-APRIL 1953
scene_heading: EXT. 41ST STREET & BROADWAY. MORNING.
text: Through passing cars and car windows we suddenly see THERESE,
text: dressed for work in a smart dark suit, hurrying through the
text: morning commuter CROWD towards the New York Times building.
text: Her style of hair and dress has taken on a sophistication and
dialog: maturity we can’t help but associate with CAROL.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI. TIMES SQUARE. MORNING.
text: CAROL, in the cab on her way to FRED HAYMES’S office, is
text: looking distantly out the window when she suddenly spots her.
text: The light changes and the taxi starts to move - THERESE
text: flickers from view. CAROL looks back over her shoulder
dialog: through reflections.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR/JERRY RIX LAW OFFICES. DAY.
text: CAROL, turned away, inside the elevator. The doors open. She
text: turns to look a moment before heading out the door and down
dialog: the hall.
text: Gathered inside, HARGE, RIX, FRED HAYMES and a STENOGRAPHER
text: all turn and note her arrival.
scene_heading: INT. JERRY RIX LAW OFFICES. DAY. MOMENTS LATER
text: Everyone is gathered around the conference table.
speaker_heading: JERRY RIX
dialog: Well-(coughs)- we feel, given the
dialog: seriousness of the charges and the
dialog: incontestability of the evidence,
dialog: my client has every reason to
dialog: expect a compliant and favorable
dialog: outcome.
speaker_heading: FRED HAYMES
dialog: Not so fast, Jerry. My client’s
dialog: psychotherapist is perfectly
dialog: satisfied with her recovery from...
dialog: the events of the winter, asserting
dialog: she’s more than capable of caring
dialog: for her child. She’s had no further
dialog: contact with Therese Belivet.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: A silence,
dialog: 107
speaker_heading: FRED HAYMES (CONT'D)
dialog: And we have sworn depositions from
dialog: two Saddlebrook Institute
dialog: psychiatrists clearly stating that,
text: in their opinions, a series of
dialog: events, precipitated by my client’s
dialog: husband, drove her to suffer an
dialog: emotional break, which resulted in
dialog: this - described behavior.
speaker_heading: HARGE
dialog: (looks to his lawyer for
dialog: help)
dialog: That's absurd! - Are they serious-?
speaker_heading: JERRY RIX
dialog: Alright, Fred - okay, if this is
dialog: how you’re going to play this-
speaker_heading: FRED HAYMES
dialog: Furthermore, given the manner in
dialog: which these tapes were obtained and
dialog: recorded, we’re confident in their
dialog: inadmissability-
speaker_heading: JERRY RIX
dialog: Okay, okay. First off, I’d like to
dialog: see these depositions. And second-
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (interrupts him)
dialog: Fred - please. Don’t - May I speak?
text: as everybody in the room looks to CAROL.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: I won’t deny the truth of what’s
dialog: contained in those tapes.
speaker_heading: FRED HAYMES
dialog: (signals to the
speaker_heading: STENOGRAPHER )
dialog: This is off the record, honey.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Might as well be on the record.
text: A pause as JERRY nods to the STENOGRAPHER to continue and
text: CAROL pours herself a glass of water.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D) (CONT'D)
dialog: I wanted - I did want - to talk
dialog: about... duty... sacrifice. That
dialog: was what I-(beat)... But now that
dialog: I’m here I don’t... I don’t know
dialog: what I believe... Or what I even
dialog: know... except that...
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 108
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: I know I want to see my daughter -
dialog: to hear her voice... Always. To be
dialog: there when she’s-
text: She stops, holding back tears, which she refuses to allow.
text: Gathering herself, she levels her eyes directly to Harge, and
text: makes her case directly to him.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Harge, I want you to be... happy. I
dialog: didn’t give you that - I failed you
dialog: - we both could have... given.
dialog: More. (beat) But we gave each other
dialog: Rindy, and that’s - the most -
dialog: breathtaking, the most...
dialog: generous... of gifts. (beat) So why
dialog: are we spending so much time...
dialog: coming up with ways to keep her
dialog: from each other. (beat) What
dialog: happened with Therese... I wanted.
dialog: I won’t deny it or-
text: HARGE looks down.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: +. But I do regret, I - grieve...
dialog: the mess we’re about to make... of
dialog: our child’s life. We, Harge... we
dialog: are both... responsible. Let’s...
dialog: set it right. (beat) I want Harge
dialog: to have... permanent custody-
text: Amidst the sudden chaos HARGE’s eyes take hold of her and
dialog: don’t let up.
scene_heading: FRED HAYMES JERRY RIX
dialog: Let’s take a break, folks and Fred - no, I think your
dialog: resume when I’ve had a moment client has made it perfectly
dialog: to confer with my- clear given her statement-
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: No, Fred. Let me have my say.
dialog: Because - if you stop me... I
dialog: won't... be able... to cope...
text: CAROL stands, stepping away from the table, to regain her
text: composure. Silence returns before she continues.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m no martyr. I have no clue...
dialog: what’s best for me. But I do
dialog: know... I feel, I feel it in my
dialog: bones... what’s best for my
dialog: daughter.
text: She starts to turn and walk again, addressing HARGE.
dialog: 109
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat) I want visits with her,
dialog: Harge. I don’t care if they’re
dialog: supervised. But they need to be
dialog: regular. (beat) There was a time...
dialog: I would have locked myself away -
dialog: done most anything... just to keep
dialog: Rindy with me. But... what use am I
dialog: to her... to us... living
dialog: against... my own grain? Rindy
dialog: deserves - joy. How do I give her
dialog: that not knowing what it means...
dialog: myself.
text: She pours herself another glass of water.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s the deal. Take it or leave
dialog: it. I can’t - I won’t negotiate.
dialog: If you... leave it, we go to court
dialog: and it gets ugly. We’re not ugly
dialog: people, Harge.
text: Feeling suddenly shaky she turns and starts out of the room.
text: HARGE stands, staring at her as she goes, as FRED leaps to
text: his feet and hurries after her, calling her name.
scene_heading: EXT. COFFEE SHOP. SEVENTH AVENUE. DAY.
text: Through reflections we see CAROL seated at a table, writing a
text: note. Beside her a pot of coffee and cigarette burning in an
text: ashtray. She signs it. Seals it inside an envelope, and
text: begins gathering her things.
scene_heading: INT. NEW YORK TIMES. PHOTO DEPARTMENT. DAY.
text: THERESE organizes black and white prints during a meeting of
text: photo editors, gathered around a large table. Smoke in the
text: air. Through the glass a MESSENGER is seen speaking to a
text: CLERK. The CLERK spots THERESE inside the room and brings her
dialog: the envelope.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Belivet.
text: THERESE, looks up, and hurries over to the CLERK by the door.
text: He hands her the envelope.
speaker_heading: CLERK (CONT'D)
text: Hand delivered. Swank.
text: THERESE takes the envelope and returns to the table. Glancing
text: down, she recognizes CAROL'S handwriting.
dialog: 110
scene_heading: INT. NEW YORK TIMES. PHOTO DEPARTMENT. LATER.
text: THERESE types labels at her cubicle. The open note sits
text: beside her on her desk. She stops typing and looks over at
text: the note. She picks it up and holds it for a moment before
text: crumpling it up and tossing it into a desk drawer. She
text: returns to typing.
scene_heading: INT. RITZ TOWER HOTEL. NIGHT.
text: CAROL is entering the hotel from the street entrance,
text: removing her scarf and adjusting her hair. She makes her way
text: to the pay telephones and slips inside an empty booth. There
text: we see her dial a number and make a quick call. She hangs up,
text: takes out her compact and powders her nose. She steps out of
text: the booth and stops.
scene_heading: INT. RITZ TOWER HOTEL. BAR/LOUNGE. NIGHT.
text: There, across the room, is THERESE being shown to a corner
text: table, THERESE looking more grown-up and put together,
text: THERESE thanking the MAITRE D’, THERESE sitting down... CAROL
text: takes a breath, then makes her way across the room.
text: THERESE looks up and sees her.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I wasn’t sure you'd come. It’s nice
dialog: of you to see me.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Don’t say that.
text: CAROL settles in opposite THERESE, moving her coat aside.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Do you hate me, Therese?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: No. How could I hate you?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I suppose you could. Didn’t you?
dialog: For a while?
text: THERESE looks down. She pours herself some tea.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Abby tells me you’re thriving.
dialog: You've no idea how pleased I am for
dialog: you. (beat) You look very fine, you
dialog: know. As if you’ve suddenly
dialog: blossomed. Is that what comes of
dialog: getting away from me?
dialog: 111
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: (answers quickly)
dialog: No.
text: She frowns, regretting answering so quickly, and looking
text: down. When she looks up again, CAROL is staring at her,
text: quite intently.
speaker_heading: THERESE (CONT’D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Nothing. I was just thinking about
text: that day. In the doll department.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I always wondered... Why did you
dialog: come over to me?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Because you were the only girl not
dialog: busy as hell. (beat) Disappointed?
text: THERESE shakes her head no. CAROL smiles at the memory and
text: lights a cigarette.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Harge and I are selling the house.
dialog: I’ve taken an apartment. On Madison
dialog: Avenue. And a job, believe it or
dialog: not. I’m going to work for a
dialog: furniture house on Fourth Avenue as
dialog: a buyer. Some of my ancestors must
dialog: have been carpenters.
text: THERESE gives CAROL a little smile - a bit of thaw.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Have you seen Rindy?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (after a beat)
text: Once or twice. At the lawyer’s
dialog: office. She sat on my lap and we...
text: (holding THERESE’S gaze): She's
dialog: going to live with Harge. For now.
dialog: It’s... the right thing.
text: CAROL can’t quite cover the pain of this, but she tries.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway, the apartment’s a nice big
dialog: one - big enough for two. I was
dialog: hoping you might like to come and
dialog: live with me, but I guess you
dialog: won't. (beat) Would you?
dialog: 112
text: A held breath.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: No. I don’t think so.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: That's... your decision.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: A silence.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I’m meeting some people from the
text: furniture house at the Oak Room at
dialog: nine. If you want to have dinner...
dialog: if you change your mind... I think--
dialog: you'd like them. (beat) Well.
dialog: That’s that.
text: CAROL puts out her cigarette, stares at her cigarette lighter
text: on the table.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: I love you.
text: A silence. THERESE wants to say something, but can’t.
speaker_heading: O/S JACK TAFT
dialog: Therese? Is that you?
text: And the moment is gone. THERESE looks up, turns towards the
dialog: source of the greeting.
text: It’s a smiling JACK TAFT, halfway across the room, near the
dialog: bar.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What do you know! (starts over) I’m
dialog: saying to myself, I know that girl.
text: THERESE watches JACK make his way over to her. She gives
text: CAROL a quick look - CAROL, staring down at the table, not
text: knowing what to do, vulnerable... THERESE rises to greet
speaker_heading: JACK.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Gee but it’s great to see you. It’s
dialog: been, well, months.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Months.
dialog: 113
text: CAROL lights a cigarette. THERESE glances at her, and they
text: hold a look for a moment before THERESE speaks.
speaker_heading: THERESE (CONT’D)
dialog: Jack, this is Carol Aird.
text: JACK holds out his hand. CAROL shakes it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Pleased to meet you.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Likewise.
text: CAROL retreats back to her own thoughts, smokes.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey, Ted Gray’s meeting me here and
dialog: a bunch of us are heading down to
dialog: Phil’s party. You’re going aren’t
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: Well - yes. I just planned to get
dialog: there a little...(looking to Carol)
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You should go ahead.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You coming along?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: No, no. (to THERESE) I should make
dialog: a few calls before dinner, anyway.
dialog: I should really run.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: (to JACK)
dialog: Well... it would be great to catch
dialog: a ride.
text: CAROL takes a step towards THERESE, but no more.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You two have a wonderful night.
dialog: Nice meeting you, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nice meeting you.
dialog: 114
text: And she’s gone. THERESE doesn’t move, doesn’t turn around to
dialog: watch CAROL leave.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, well let me go make sure
text: the loaf is on his way. Back ina
dialog: flash.
text: And JACK’S off to the phone booth. A beat, before THERESE
text: turns around. She scans the bar and beyond for CAROL, but
text: she’s not there. THERESE walks to the lobby entrance - she
text: scans the lobby - but CAROL is well and truly gone - and it
text: only now hits THERESE that she let CAROL walk away. THERESE
text: turns and makes her way to the LADIES ROOM in a bit of a
dialog: daze.
scene_heading: INT. RITZ TOWER HOTEL. LADIES ROOM. NIGHT.
text: THERESE stands at the sink, water running. She can barely
text: bring herself to look into the mirror. She splashes cold
text: water on her face.
scene_heading: INT. PHIL’S APARTMENT. NIGHT.
text: THERESE threads her way through PHIL’S GUESTS on her way to
dialog: the front door - it’s no easy task navigating, especially
text: since no one seems to notice THERESE, or anything other than
text: their own good time. When she finally reaches the door,
text: THERESE takes a look back into the living room to see if
text: she’s missed out on any good-byes. She spots DANNIE and
text: LOUISE on the floor, knees-up to PHIL’S small black and white
text: TV set, intently watching a film, oblivious to the noise
text: around them. DANNIE jots notes every once in a while in his
dialog: little notebook. All seems right here - for others at least.
text: THERESE slips out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. GREENWICH VILLAGE STREET. NIGHT.
text: THERESE walks down a quaint, cobbled street. It’s a lovely
text: night and there are various PEDESTRIANS out strolling. It
text: seems to THERESE that she’s the only person who isn’t
text: smiling, isn’t engaged with someone who’s actually beside her
text: on such a lovely evening. She looks at the palm of her hand,
text: checks the address, keeps walking. As she approaches the
text: address, THERESE spots an ELDERLY COUPLE arm in arm,
text: supporting each other, walking down the street towards her.
text: They look like they’ve been together for ever: the ELDERLY
text: WOMAN leaning in to her husband as they pass, the ELDERLY MAN
text: tipping his hat to THERESE.
text: We HEAR SHARP LAUGHTER from a nearby apartment and THERESE
text: turns to see GENEVIEVE CANTRELL lean backwards out of a
text: window. She holds a bottle of champagne which spills down
text: into the street below.
dialog: 115
text: GENEVIEVE gestures to someone inside, and ANOTHER WOMAN joins
text: GENEVIEVE at the window - the two begin to make out. THERESE
text: watches their embrace for a moment; it’s tremendously sexy.
text: GENEVIEVE pulls the WOMAN back into the apartment, and the
text: window’s slammed shut behind them. The night is suddenly very
text: quiet. THERESE looks off in the direction the ELDERLY COUPLE
text: took. She starts walking, away from GENEVIEVE, toward
text: something else. She begins to walk more quickly, and more
text: quickly still, brushing past the world of strangers.
scene_heading: INT. THE OAK ROOM. PLAZA HOTEL. NIGHT.
text: THERESE, winded, enters the restaurant. A WAITER stops her.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Do you have a reservation?
speaker_heading: THERESE
dialog: I’m looking for someone.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: I'm sorry ma’am, I can’t seat you
dialog: without-
text: She moves away from the WAITER and scans the crowded room.
text: Nothing. Then, out of the corner of her eye, almost
text: imperceptible at first, at a table towards the rear of the
text: room, she sees a woman’s blonde head thrown back in laughter;
text: the woman seems to be encapsulated in or protected by a haze
dialog: of light and smoke. It’s CAROL, CAROL as THERESE has always
text: seen her and as she will see her evermore: in SLOW MOTION,
text: like in a dream or a single, defining memory, substantial yet
text: elusive. She moves towards her. CAROL raises a wine glass to
text: her lips and as she does, she turns slightly and spots
text: THERESE. She is not startled. We see her face softening.
text: THERESE continues to approach. CAROL watches with a smile
text: burning in her eyes. THERESE has nearly arrived.
