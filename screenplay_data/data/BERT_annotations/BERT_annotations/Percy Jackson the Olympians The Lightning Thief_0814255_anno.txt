scene_heading: INT. INDOOR SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT
text: Wooden bleachers line the surrounding walls of the Olympic-
text: sized pool. The room is empty. MOONLIGHT shines through the
text: skylights, reflecting off the water. Nikes, Jay-Z T-shirt
text: and an iTouch are piled at the pool's edge. CAMERA CRANES
text: INSIDE the water. AT THE POOL'S BOTTOM, we find...
text: PERCY JACKSON, age 17, sitting with his legs crossed, dressed
text: in cargo shorts. His eyes are closed. His long, dirty
text: blonde hair floats around him. His expression is peaceful.
speaker_heading: PERCY (V.0.)
dialog: Ever since I was a kid, I liked being in
dialog: the water. It's where I do my best
dialog: thinking. Sometimes, when I concentrate,
dialog: I hear this distant voice... like
dialog: somebody trying to guide me, give me
dialog: direction... Weird, huh?
text: Percy opens his eyes, shoots to the surface, fills his lungs
dialog: with air.
speaker_heading: PERCY (V.O.)
text: Probably just water on the brain.
scene_heading: EXT. YANCY ACADEMY - DAY
text: A large campus in upstate New York. Old, brick buildings are
text: scattered across several well-manicured acres. Percy walks
text: alone across campus, dressed like a Venice Beach surf rat,
text: listening to an iPod. His attitude is tough, hard, cool.
speaker_heading: PERCY (V.O.)
dialog: My name is Percy Jackson. Until a few
dialog: months ago, I was a student here at Yancy
dialog: Academy. The kind of place where parents
dialog: send their "troubled" kids when no one
dialog: else will take them.
text: A fight breaks out between a group of students. Teachers run
text: to break it up. Percy keeps on walking.
scene_heading: INT. YANCY CLASSROOM - LATER - DAY
text: A 52 year old, grey haired, bearded teacher in a wheelchair,
text: MR. BRUNNER, lectures to a group of kids who would rather be
text: elsewhere. Percy stares at his textbook.
speaker_heading: PERCY (V.O.)
dialog: My so-called troubles, had impressive-
dialog: sounding names--
text: Percy squints at the text. The words MORPH into odd shapes.
speaker_heading: PERCY (V.0.)
dialog: --like "dyslexia" and "attention deficit
dialog: disorder." But I had a better name for
dialog: them: boredom.
scene_heading: INT. PERCY'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
text: Percy's roommate is asleep, SNORING. A pair of rusted,
text: metallic FOREARM CRUTCHES lean against his roommate's bed.
text: Percy lies awake, the walls around him covered with posters
text: of SURFERS riding EXTREME WAVES. Tacked to the wall is a
text: photograph: Percy and his mom, in happier times.
speaker_heading: PERCY (V.O.)
dialog: I was also supposed to have some
dialog: displaced rage because my father
dialog: abandoned my mom before I was born.
dialog: But quite honestly, none of that really
dialog: mattered...
text: Distant THUNDER roars. Percy gets up, looks out his window.
text: STORM CLOUDS form in the sky, obscure the moon.
speaker_heading: PERCY (V.O.)
dialog: ..-because my real troubles were just
dialog: beginning.
scene_heading: EXT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM - MANHATTAN - THE NEXT DAY - DAY
text: The sky above Manhattan is heavy with dark, ominous clouds.
text: A "YANCY ACADEMY" BUS is parked in front of the museum.
scene_heading: INT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART - LATER
text: A spacious, glass-domed room filled with ancient GREEK
text: ARTIFACTS, rusted WEAPONS, and ARTWORK. In the center of the
text: room, are imposing SCULPTURES of the TWELVE OLYMPIAN GODS.
text: MR. BRUNNER lectures from his wheelchair
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: There are twelve Olympian Gods. The
dialog: major three were brothers, who went on
dialog: to rule the world. Zeus became the King
dialog: of the gods and ruled the sky. His
dialog: brother, Poseidon ruled the sea. And
dialog: their other brother, Hades, ruled the
dialog: underworld.
text: A group of fairly disinterested high school SENIORS stand
text: around Mr. Brunner. Percy stands off to the side, sweatshirt
text: pulled up to hide his ipod headphones. GROVER, Percy's
text: roommate, stands beside him. Grover is overweight, with
text: curly brown hair, glasses, a wispy goatee and a perpetual
text: expression of lust and mischief. Using his cell phone,
text: Grover snaps a photo of the Aphrodite statue's breasts.
text: Brunner notices. Frowns. Not amused.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: Grover. Please.
text: Grover looks up. Guilty. Brunner extends his hand.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: A little more respect for the Gods.
text: Grover sighs, hands over the cell phone. Brunner looks at
text: the photos, holds up the camera for the class to see. The
text: kids chuckle at the image of Aphrodite's breasts.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: What does this tell us about Grover?
speaker_heading: CUTE GIRL
dialog: He's a sex addict.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: Possibly. Grover may be a tad more,
dialog: hormonally challenged than most
text: teenagers. But he still shares a similar
dialog: weakness with all of us. Lust.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: (leans to cute girl)
dialog: I knew we had something in common.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: It's something the Greek Gods also shared
dialog: with us. There were several occasions,
dialog: when the Gods would come down to earth
dialog: and... how shall I put this?...
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Hook up.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: They would hook up with mortals.
text: Several kids snicker.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: The children of these unions were half-
dialog: God and half-human. Can anyone tell me
dialog: what they were called?
text: Mr. Brunner scans to DREW BOBOFIT, a tough, angry, mean
text: spirited bully with a buzzcut and tattoos.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: Mr. Bobofit?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Bastards? Mongrels? Mutts?
dialog: 4.
text: Drew's two friends, two hoodlums named TONY and VINCE, laugh.
text: Brunner scowls, looks around.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: Anyone else? Percy?
text: But Percy doesn't hear, lost in his music. Grover uses one
text: of his crutches to yank the headset out of Percy's ear.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Huh? What?
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: What is the proper name for the offspring
dialog: of a human and a God?
text: Percy narrows his eyes, thinks, finally... it comes to him.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Demigods.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: Very good, Mr. Jackson.
dialog: (to Drew Bobofit)
dialog: Mr. Bobofit, you and the rest of the
dialog: class obviously need a bit more incentive
dialog: to learn this material. Perhaps a quiz
dialog: will help. Tomorrow. Chapters 7 and 8.
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM MEN'S ROOM - LATER - DAY
text: Percy and Grover enter. Grover, using his crutches, walks
text: with a pronounced limp.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I can't get above a D in most classes.
dialog: But somehow, without even studying...
dialog: I get this stuff...
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: (ironic smile)
dialog: Maybe it's in your blood.
text: The bathroom door FLIES OPEN. Drew and his friends enter,
text: shove past Grover, nearly knocking him down.
speaker_heading: DREW
text: Out of the way, Crip.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Shut your mouth, Drew.
text: Drew turns, walks back to Percy, getting in his face.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: You're the one who should keep your mouth
dialog: shut, Jackson. If you weren't so busy
dialog: kissing Brunner's ass, we wouldn't be
text: having a quiz tomorrow.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Big deal. You have to study. Grow up.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Not all of us can get a fancy tutor by
dialog: pretending we have dyslexia.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I'm not pretending. I mix things up.
dialog: Like right now, I could swear your dick
dialog: is where your head is supposed to be.
text: Furious, Drew and his gang DRAG Percy him into a STALL. Drew
text: tries to SHOVE Percy's head into the toilet bowl. Percy
text: STRUGGLES to break free. Grover BANGS on the stall door.
speaker_heading: GROVER (0.S.)
dialog: Percy!?
text: As Percy's face gets closer to the toilet water, the water
text: begins to CHURN and BUBBLE, growing in POWER.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Stop!
text: Drew keeps PUSHING. The water CHURNS violently.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I... said... STOP!
text: Suddenly, a BLAST OF WATER EXPLODES out of the toilet bowl.
text: The water moves with EXTREME FORCE and a definite PURPOSE.
text: It SHOOTS past Percy, STRIKES Drew and the boys with the
text: power of a FIREHOUSE, blows them out of the stall and...
text: ..-ACROSS the bathroom floor, right past Grover. They land
text: UNDER the urinals. Grover SEES Percy step out of the stall.
text: Percy is SHAKEN, CONFUSED. UNSURE what just happened.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Percy... Let's go...
text: Drew and the boys get back on their feet, SOAKED. They BLOCK
text: Percy and Grover's exit.
text: A CREAKING SOUND fills the room. Followed by a low, GROANING
text: NOISE and the sound of pipes RATTLING.
dialog: 6.
text: Then -- CRACK! CRACK! -- several HAIRLINE FRACTURES form in
text: the walls and on the floor, spreading out like spiderwebs.
text: Urinals and sinks EXPLODE, firing like missiles across the
text: bathroom. Water RUSHES in through the holes in the wall,
text: forming into the shape of several snake-like TENTACLES.
text: The water-tentacles WHIP through the room, like living
text: creatures. They ATTACK Drew and his friends.
text: Grover watches in AMAZEMENT. Percy is BAFFLED, standing in
text: the center of the maelstrom.
text: The floor beneath Drew's feet CRACKS OPEN. A GEYSER of water
text: shoots upward. The Powerful water LIFTS Drew into the air.
text: The bathroom door FLIES OPEN. MR. BRUNNER rolls in. STUNNED
text: by what he sees.
text: The Geyser quickly DISSOLVES. Drew FALLS to the floor, right
text: on top of his soggy, freaked-out friends. The other water
text: STOPS FLOWING, retreating back into the pipes, leaving POOLS
text: OF WATER everywhere.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: What's going on?!?
speaker_heading: DREW
text: Jackson. He blew up the bathroom.
text: Mr. Brunner looks very CONCERNED. Percy's expression is
text: equal parts amazement, confusion, and fear.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I didn't... I don't... it just--
text: Mr. Brunner nods, speaks softly, almost knowingly.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: --happened.
scene_heading: INT. MR. BRUNNER'S OFFICE - LATER - DAY
text: Angry, Percy is sitting across from Mr. Brunner's desk.
text: Grover stands in the background.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Detention!? But it wasn't my fault... I
dialog: don't even know how it happened...
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: I believe you, Percy. But Dean Campbell
dialog: wants to suspend you. I argued for a
dialog: compromise.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: One month detention is a compromise?
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: For you? Yes. You've been to six
dialog: different schools in eight years. You've
dialog: got a D-minus average. You're on very
text: thin ice.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Perfect. I like cold water.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: You really want to be expelled from
dialog: another school?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Do I really give a damn?
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: Maybe you don't. But your Mother does.
dialog: (soft, solemn)
dialog: Don't let her down again.
text: The words sting. Percy looks out the window. Troubled,
text: upset. Mr. Brunner feels Percy's torment. Mr. Brunner takes
text: a THICK BOOK off his shelf.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: I want you to read this.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: You know that I can't--
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: Try.
text: Mr. Brunner places the book in front of Percy. The writing
text: on the cover is in GREEK. Percy refuses to look at it.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - LATER - NIGHT
text: Outside, THUNDER rumbles. We are inside a dark, ancient
text: library with high vaulted ceilings and lead glass windows.
text: Rows and rows of towering bookshelves stand along the walls,
text: each with its own ladder-on-wheels.
text: Percy sits at a long wooden table, in the middle of the room.
text: He is alone, save for the LIBRARIAN, a small elderly woman.
text: Percy is trying to read Mr. Brunner's book, staring at the
text: GREEK LETTERS on the cover. He squints.
text: The Greek letters MORPH INTO ENGLISH LETTERS. They read: "A
text: GUIDE TO GREEK MYTHS AND LEGENDS." Percy is surprised, pulls
text: the book close and reads to himself.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: "The Father of the Olympians was Kronos.
dialog: He was the King of the Titans-"
dialog: (pauses, a small smile)
dialog: I can... read?...
text: There is a LOUD CRASH. The sound of BREAKING GLASS.
text: Percy LOOKS UP and sees...
text: A CREATURE, hidden in the SHADOWS, LEAPS through the window.
text: The creature LANDS on the floor and slowly RISES UP. It's
text: over TWELVE FEET TALL.
text: The librarian SCREAMS. The creature PULLS BACK its arm,
text: SWIPES at the librarian with tremendous force.
text: The librarian is KNOCKED OFF her feet, FLIES through the air
text: and SLAMS into the wall. OUT COLD.
text: Percy STANDS. TERRIFIED. He starts to BACK AWAY.
text: The creature TURNS, faces Percy and STEPS FORWARD. INTO the
text: light.
text: It is the MINOTAUR.
text: HALF MAN. HALF BULL. MUSCULAR, with a long snout, cruel
text: yellow eyes, and battered razor-sharp horns. Seeing Percy,
text: the Minotaur ROARS, then SPEAKS in an inhuman VOICE.
speaker_heading: MINOTAUR
dialog: Where is it?!
text: Percy turns and SPRINTS toward the door.
text: The Minotaur RACES after him. Faster than Percy, the
text: Minotaur is UPON HIM in seconds.
text: The Minotaur GRABS Percy, LIFTS him into the air and HURLS
text: him at a bookshelf. Percy SLAMS into the shelves, FALLS to
text: the floor, buried under a PILE OF BOOKS.
text: Percy is STUNNED. The wind knocked out of him. The Minotaur
text: RUNS FORWARD, lifts its arm, about to PUMMEL Percy...
text: Percy ROLLS OUT of the way. The Minotaur's arm JUST MISSES
text: Percy and SMASHES a hole in the library floor.
text: Percy gets to his feet, DASHES around the corner. The
text: Minotaur FOLLOWS. Percy KICKS one of the wooden ladders into
text: the path of the creature.
text: The Minotaur SLAMS through the ladder as if it were balsa
text: wood. Percy heads for the LIBRARY DOORS.
dialog: 9.
text: The Minotaur RUNS up, SWINGS its razor sharp claw across
text: Percy's back. The claws RIP through his jacket. Percy CRIES
text: OUT in pain, falls to his knees. The Minotaur MOVES IN FOR
text: THE KILL.
text: The library doors BURST OPEN. The Minotaur STOPS, TURNS to
dialog: the sound.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: Percy!
text: Mr. Brunner races into the room on his wheelchair, holding a
text: simple BALL POINT PEN.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: Use this.
text: Mr. Brunner THROWS the pen to Percy. Confused, Percy CATCHES
text: the pen. Brunner SHOUTS.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: Click it!
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: What!?
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: Click it! The pen is mightier than
dialog: the sword.
text: Percy CLICKS the pen. IT TRANSFORMS INTO A LARGE, SHARP METAL
text: SWORD! Percy stares at the blade in DISBELIEF.
text: The Minotaur TURNS BACK to Percy, who is on his feet,
text: wielding the heavy sword.
text: Percy LUNGES FORWARD and SWINGS. The tip of the sword SLICES
text: DEEP ACROSS the creature's arm.
text: The Minotaur CRIES OUT. BLOOD seeps from its wound. This
text: only makes the creature ANGRIER. The Minotaur CHARGES Percy.
text: Percy SWINGS again, this time SLICING DEEP into the
text: Minotaur's TORSO.
text: The Minotaur HOWLS in pain, holding his bleeding CHEST WOUND.
text: With a final GROWL, the Minotaur TURNS and LEAPS OUT of the
text: library window.
text: Percy looks around the room, a gigantic mess of DESTROYED
text: books, furniture and bookcases. Percy glances to the sword.
text: It CHANGES BACK into a common everyday ballpoint pen.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: What... was... that thing?
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: We have to go. It's coming back for you.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Coming back!? It was hurt--
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNNER
dialog: You temporarily scared it off. A
dialog: Minotaur can only be killed by severing
text: the horn from its body.
text: Brunner EXITS, followed by a confused Percy.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: A Minotaur! ?
scene_heading: INT. PERCY'S DORM ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
text: Grover is asleep, an open copy of MAXIM lying on his blanket.
text: Percy and Brunner enter.
speaker_heading: BRUNNER
dialog: Pack only what you need. Fast.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Can you tell me what's going on?!
speaker_heading: BRUNNER
text: No time. Grover. Out of bed.
text: Grover groggily gets out of bed, LED into the hallway by
text: Brunner. Percy grabs a backpack and begins to PACK. From
text: the hallway, we hear Grover and Brunner's WHISPERING. Percy
text: stops packing, slowly walks to the door, EAVESDROPS.
text: Outside, THUNDER RUMBLES. Brunner WHISPERS to Grover.
speaker_heading: BRUNNER
text: Today. In the bathroom. The water.
text: It was a sign.
dialog: (a beat)
text: Percy's powers have begun to surface.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Why now?
speaker_heading: BRUNNER
dialog: It happens when their lives are in
dialog: danger.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Danger?
speaker_heading: BRUNNER
text: He was attacked. By a Minotaur.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: What? But why?
speaker_heading: BRUNNER
dialog: Listen. What do you hear?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Thunder.
speaker_heading: BRUNNER
dialog: But no lightning.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: (trying to understand)
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: BRUNNER
text: Stolen. And they suspect Percy.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Impossible.
speaker_heading: BRUNNER
dialog: I know. But because of who he is...
dialog: Everyone thinks he did it.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Oh, man... Nowhere is safe for him.
speaker_heading: BRUNNER
dialog: Only one place.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Right... You want me to take him there?
speaker_heading: BRUNNER
dialog: (nods )
text: Pick up Sally along the way.
text: Grover nods. An ANGUISHED ROAR echoes from outside. The CRY
text: of the Minotaur. Grover and Brunner turn, HURRY back to
text: Percy's bedroom. Percy RACES back inside, resumes packing.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - LATER - NIGHT
text: Grover and Percy sit inside a crowded subway train. Grover
text: is SILENT. Percy is ANXIOUS, wants information.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Would you please tell me what's going on?
dialog: What's all this stuff about my powers
dialog: starting to surface? What powers? And
dialog: me stealing something!? Is that why
dialog: nowhere is safe for me?
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: (softly, paranoid)
dialog: Quiet. Keep your voice down. They could
dialog: be listening.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Who? Who could be listening?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Not here. Not with all of these people
dialog: around. No one can be trusted.
text: Grover glares at an ELDERLY LADY who is staring at him.
text: Percy shakes his head, thinks Grover is crazy.
scene_heading: EXT. QUEENS NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
text: A working class neighborhood. Grover and Percy exit the
text: subway, HURRYING along the sidewalk. Grover is TENSE,
text: ANXIOUS, suspiciously eyeing anyone who passes by.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Why did Brunner send you home with me?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: To keep you safe.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: You're gonna' keep me safe?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: I'm your protector.
text: Percy responds with an incredulous LAUGH.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: What's so funny?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Nothing. It's just... well, you--
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: (angry, hurt)
dialog: What? You think because I'm disabled?...
dialog: I'm not capable of keeping you safe?...
dialog: Huh?... Is that it?...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I didn't say that.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: (insulted, softly)
dialog: You didn't have to.
dialog: 13.
text: Percy sighs, feels TERRIBLE. They arrive in front of a
text: small, mean, WOODEN TWO-STORY HOME, sandwiched between ROWS
text: of similar homes. They walk to the door and ENTER.
scene_heading: INT. UGLIANO HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: GABE UGLIANO, Percy's 39-year old, sloppy, overweight
text: stepfather sits at a table in this cramped apartment, playing
text: cards with four POKER BUDDIES. Several empty BEER BOTTLES
text: are on the table. 70's SOUTHERN ROCK plays in the BG.
speaker_heading: PERCY (V.O.)
dialog: This disgusting slob is my step-father
dialog: Gabe Ugliano. I call him "Smelly Gabe"
dialog: because he never showers, puts Tabasco
dialog: and garlic on everything he eats, and...
text: Gabe lifts a butt-cheek off his chair and lets one RIIIIIP.
speaker_heading: PERCY (V.0.)
dialog: You get the picture. Sometimes when
text: Gabe drinks too much... he fights with
text: my Mom... screams at her, slaps her
dialog: around... A real prince.
speaker_heading: GABE
speaker_heading: (calls OFFSCREEN)
dialog: Sally? Hey? Can we get a couple beers?
text: Percy's mom, SALLY,enters, carrying a six pack. Sally is in
text: her mid-30's, attractive, beaten-down by a hard life.
text: There's a toughness, an inner strength, a radiant glow about
text: her. Gabe takes the beers, looks at his friends.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Ya' know, guys... If God wanted men to
dialog: get their own beer, he wouldn't have
dialog: invented wives...
text: Sally forces a smile, places the beers on the table.
speaker_heading: PERCY (V.O.)
dialog: My mom, on the other hand, is an angel.
dialog: I could never understand what she was
dialog: doing with this jerk.
text: Gabe pulls Sally in for a sloppy kiss, GRABS her ass.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Just kiddin', babe. C'mere...
speaker_heading: PERCY (0.S.)
dialog: Get your hands off my Mother.
text: Everyone TURNS. Percy and Grover stand in the doorway.
text: Sally is SURPRISED, but delighted by the appearance of Percy.
dialog: 14,
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Percy!
text: Sally rushes to Percy, embraces him. She notices Grover,
text: kisses his cheek.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Grover?... You too?...
dialog: (suspicious, to Percy)
dialog: What are you doing home?
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Probably got his ass kicked out of
dialog: another school.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Disrespect my Mom again and you'll get
dialog: your ass kicked out in the street.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Yeah!? Let's see what you got--
text: Gabe stands, in a drunken rage, GRABS Percy by the collar.
text: Ready for a FIGHT. Gabe's gonna' kill him. Grover BRINGS
text: DOWN his crutch. HARD. ON TOP off Gabe's foot. Gabe CRIES
text: OUT. Grover feigns an apology.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Oh, geez. Sorry. New crutches.
text: Grover MOVES his crutch from Gabe's foot, LIFTS IT... this
text: time SLAMMING Gabe in the balls. Gabe CRUMBLES to his knees.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: I am so clumsy. Are you okay?
text: The wind KNOCKED OUT of him, Gabe is helped back into his
text: chair by his friends. Grover LEANS to Percy, whispers.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: I'm your protector. You cool with that?
text: Percy hides a small smile, NODS. Sally hurriedly LEADS the
text: boys out of the room, into the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Why do you stay with that smelly pig?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Not another word. He's been good to
dialog: us in ways you'll never know.
dialog: (to Grover)
dialog: Now... what's going on?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: We have to go. To the camp.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Right now? Why?
speaker_heading: GROVER
text: Percy's in danger. They're coming after
dialog: him. They think he stole--
text: From OFFSCREEN, we hear a LOUD, INHUMAN ROAR. Grover panics.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: The Minotaur!
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Relax... It's only Gabe.
speaker_heading: GABE (0.S.)
text: PERCY JACKSON! GET YOUR ASS IN HERE!
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: We'll take Gabe's car. C'mon.
text: They hurriedly exit through the BACK DOOR. Grover quickly
text: SNATCHES a jumbo bag of Cheetos.
scene_heading: EXT. UGLIANO HOME - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
text: A battered, rusted orange '78 CAMARO, complete with racing
text: stripes, SPEEDS out of the garage.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - LATER - NIGHT
text: The Camaro is the only car on the road, moving deeper into
text: the dense countryside. On one side of the road, miles and
text: miles of TREES. On the other side, a hilly FIELD.
scene_heading: INT. CAMARO - NIGHT
text: Sally is at the wheel. Grover is in the back seat, nervously
text: gobbling Cheetos and checking a ROAD MAP. Percy turns to
text: Sally. He's UPSET. WORRIED.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Mom, I don't know what's going on. But
dialog: I didn't steal anything. I swear...
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I believe you, honey. I know that you're
dialog: scared and confused right now. Trust me,
dialog: I didn't want any of this for you. I
dialog: thought you could have an ordinary life.
dialog: (warm, loving)
dialog: But nothing about you could ever be
dialog: ordinary.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: So where are we going?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Think of it as a camp. A camp for
dialog: special people. Like you. And your
dialog: father.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: (bitter)
text: Great. A camp full of losers.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Your father was not a loser. He was
dialog: a great... man.
speaker_heading: PERCY
text: A great man who abandoned his family.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: He did not abandon us, Percy. He had to
dialog: leave. He couldn't live in our world.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Our world? Who was my Dad? £.T.?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Percy. You know all the myths about the
dialog: Greek gods and goddesses? Well, they're
text: not really myths. The gods are alive.
dialog: They're here.

dialog: What?...
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: You saw the Minotaur...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Right. Okay. But, I mean... if the Gods
dialog: are real, wouldn't they be in Greece?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: They were. A long time ago. But the
dialog: Gods tend to follow the heart of the
dialog: West. They've been settled in America
dialog: for the past two centuries.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: What does this have to do with me?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Remember what Brunner said in class?...
dialog: Sometimes when the Gods are down here on
text: Earth, they fall in love with mortals...
dialog: have kids...
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Demigods...
speaker_heading: GROVER
text: Half-god and half-mortal. There are
text: hundreds living in the world right now.
dialog: Some lead normal lives, others become
dialog: pretty famous.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: What are you saying?
speaker_heading: SALLY
text: (turns to him, dead serious)
dialog: You're a Demi-God.
text: Percy is stunned. SPEECHLESS.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
text: The Camaro passes a field of grazing CATTLE. As the car
text: passes, one of the cows RAISES its enormous head, above the
text: rest. It's a large BULL'S HEAD with TWISTED HORNS. It
text: follows the Camaro with GLOWING YELLOW EYES. The MINOTAUR.
scene_heading: INT. CAMARO - NIGHT
text: The car continues down the deserted, DARK ROAD. Percy is
text: still shocked by the news. Sally EXPLAINS.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I was young when we met, just out of
dialog: school, working at a resort for the
dialog: summer, right on the ocean. Your Father
dialog: was...not like any guy I had ever met.
dialog: He was just... dazzling.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: They're always dazzling.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: We were very much in love... And then...
dialog: you came along... But he had to leave...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: So he did abandon us.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: He had no choice. The Gods, by their
dialog: very nature, can't live among mortals.
dialog: They are responsible for an entire
dialog: universe...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Then maybe they shouldn't have kids.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Your Father loved you, Percy. Leaving
dialog: you was probably the most difficult thing
dialog: he ever did.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: (pauses, softens)
dialog: What was his name?
text: Sally turns, ABOUT TO TELL Percy who his Father was. A loud
text: INHUMAN ROAR fills the air. Grover LOOKS OUT the window.
text: When SUDDENLY...
text: CHUD! A COW lands in the road, in front of them.
text: Sally screams, SWERVES to miss the animal.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT
text: The Camaro FLIPS onto its side, CAREENS off the road. It
text: SKIDS into a ditch, coming to a STOP beside a VAST FOREST of
text: tall PINE TREES. SMOKE pours from beneath the hood.
scene_heading: INT. CAMARO - NIGHT
text: In PAIN, Percy grabs his head. He sees Sally, SLUMPED over
dialog: the wheel.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Mom?... Mom?!?...
text: Sally stirs, more STUNNED than hurt.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I'm okay. How's Grover?
text: He raises his head up from the backseat.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Is it just me, or is it raining cows?
text: The car suddenly SHAKES, from an IMPACT TREMOR. This is
text: followed by several IMPACT TREMORS. Something very large,
text: very HEAVY, is running toward them. Percy looks out the mud-
text: splattered back window. He SEES...
text: COWS, being THROWN INTO THE AIR, flying LEFT AND RIGHT. A
text: MONSTROUS THING plows through them, heading TOWARD THE CAR.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Everyone out!
text: Sally THROWS HERSELF against the driver's side door. It is
text: JAMMED SHUT. Percy TRIES TO OPEN his door. Also jammed.
text: The creature is GETTING CLOSER... CLOSER...
dialog: 19.
text: Grover REMOVES his sneakers, strips off his baggy pants.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: My job.
text: Grover lifts his feet, revealing that they are... THICK,
text: FURRY HOOVES. Percy stares at Grover's hooves, SHOCKED.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Okay. So you're half donkey.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Goat actually.
text: Grover PULLS BACK his leg. With a POWERFUL KICK, he SHATTERS
text: the rear window and CLIMBS out of the back window. Percy
text: ASSISTS his mom out of the car. When Percy climbs out, he
text: sees Grover standing in all his glory... He's a SATYR.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Follow me.
text: With tremendous speed and agility, Grover RUN/GALLOPS toward
text: the PINE FOREST. Percy and Sally FOLLOW. They glance over
dialog: their shoulder and see...
text: The MINOTAUR, stepping into the road, spotlighted by the
text: car's HEADLIGHTS. The creature stops at the car, SNUFFLES,
text: nuzzling at the windows.
text: A few feet away, at the edge of the pine forest, Sally,
text: Percy, and Grover stop, looking back at the Minotaur. The
text: Minotaur unleashes a CHILLING, ANGRY HOWL, turns toward Sally
dialog: and the boys.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: He just picked up our scent. Run!
text: They SPRINT OFF, into the pine forest.
text: The angry Minotaur PICKS UP the Camaro, LIFTS IT and HURLS
text: the car in their general direction. The car FLIES toward
text: Percy, Sally and Grover, SMASHING through the pine trees.
text: Sally TACKLES Grover and Percy, PINNING THEM to the ground.
text: The car FLIES OVER their heads, MISSING THEM by inches. It
text: lands with a CRASH, only a few feet in front of them.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Gabe's gonna' be pissed.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I always hated that car.
dialog: 20.
text: They quickly get back on their feet, hearing the Minotaur
text: SMASHING and BREAKING the trees, as he CHARGES after them.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: C'mon. We're almost there.
text: Grover POINTS just ahead of them. There is an OLD WOODEN
text: GATE/ARCHWAY, leading into a small clearing. Faded GREEK
text: LETTERS arc across the top of the gate.
text: Percy, Sally and Grover RUN FOR THEIR LIVES, toward the gate.
text: The Minotaur CHASES them, GETTING CLOSER...
text: Percy, Sally and Grover reach the gate. Percy LOOKS UP at
scene_heading: the letters. PERCY'S POV: The letters SHAPE-SHIFT, MORPH
text: into English letters. Percy reads the words.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Camp. Half. Blood.
text: Grover GRABS Percy, PULLS HIM THROUGH the open wooden gate.
text: Sally STOPS at the entrance. She DOESN'T go through.
text: The Minotaur CRASHES through a row of pines. MOVING FAST.
text: Less than FIFTY YARDS AWAY. Percy looks back to his Mom,
text: sees that she's STOPPED.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Mom! What are you doing!?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I can't go any further.
text: Percy REACHES OUT, GRABS his Mother's arms, TRIES TO PULL her
text: through the Camp Entrance. AN INVISIBLE, FORCE FIELD WALL
text: prevents Sally from entering. Percy CAN'T PULL HER THROUGH.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I can't go through. I'm not like you.
text: The Minotaur STOMPS forward. Only a FEW FEET AWAY.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I love you, Percy. Now go. Please.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I'm not leaving without you!
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: You have to. You're meant to.
text: Sally PULLS HER ARM FREE from Percy. She takes a step back,
text: just as the Minotaur ARRIVES. Percy REACHES for his Mother
text: again, but the beast grabs Sally and pulls her AWAY.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: No!!!
text: Up ahead, Grover SKIDS to a stop, looks back and SEES...
text: The Minotaur GRAB Sally by the neck and LIFT her off the
text: ground. She STRUGGLES, kicking and pummeling the air.
text: The Minotaur CLOSES HIS FISTS around Sally's neck. She MELTS
text: into light, becoming a shimmering, GOLDEN FORM. There is a
text: BLINDING FLASH. And Sally DISAPPEARS. Simply... GONE.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: MOM!!!
text: Percy's face is covered with ANGER and GRIEF. He is filled
text: with newfound strength, a rush of BURNING ENERGY. Percy
text: CHARGES toward the beast. Grover runs toward him, YELLS --
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Percy! Don't--
text: Percy RUNS up to the Minotaur and LEAPS onto its back. The
text: creature TOSSES HIM OFF like a rag doll. The force SENDS
text: Percy FLYING INTO A TREE. HARD. He FALLS onto the ground.
text: Motionless. EYES CLOSED.
text: The Minotaur LOWERS ITS HEAD and CHARGES Percy. At the last
text: moment, Percy ROLLS OUT OF THE WAY.
text: The Minotaur JUST MISSES him and PLOWS into a tree. HEAD
text: FIRST. The Minotaur's horn GETS STUCK in the trunk. With a
text: LOUD ROAR, the Minotaur PULLS BACK its head. There is a
text: HORRID SNAP of bone. The Minotaur's horn SNAPS OFF, RIPPED
text: from its head, now STUCK in the tree.
text: FURIOUS, the Minotaur turns to Percy and ROARS. A weakened
text: Percy takes a step back, his legs SHAKING. The Minotaur
text: RACES toward him, ready to FINISH THIS.
text: As the Minotaur CHARGES, Percy RUNS to the tree. He PULLS
text: the Minotaur's horn OUT OF THE TREE.
text: Percy STABS the creature, PLUNGING the horn into the middle
text: of the Minotaur's chest. The Minotaur HOWLS IN PAIN. BLACK
text: BLOOD pours from the wound. The Minotaur FALLS to the
text: ground. DEAD.
text: Breathless and weak, Percy STANDS over the fallen Minotaur.
text: Percy DROPS the horn, LOOKS UP, the trees SPIN. Percy's eyes
text: ROLL BACK. Softly, he speaks...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Mom...
text: He FAINTS.
dialog: 22.
scene_heading: INT. CAMP HALF-BLOOD - INFIRMARY - DAYS LATER - DAY
text: Percy is lying on a HOSPITAL BED. ANNABETH, a 17 year old
text: girl with stunning GREY EYES and curly blond hair, stares
text: down at him. She's wearing body armor and is covered in
text: sweat and dirt, but she's still radiant.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: This is him? Doesn't look tough enough
dialog: to kill a Minotaur. I'm not impressed.
text: Percy's eyes slowly flutter OPEN. He stares up into
text: Annabeth's hypnotic, grey eyes, sees all of her BEAUTY.
text: Light reflects off her armor making her look otherworldly.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Hello--
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: You drool when you sleep. Wipe your
dialog: mouth.
text: Percy wipes his mouth, Grover steps out from behind Annabeth.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Welcome back, Buddy.
text: Percy notices the cacophony of MOANS and GROANS. He sees
text: that his bed is one of several dozen, inside of a large,
text: stone walled INFIRMARY. Kids, ages 11-18, are in the beds.
text: They are BATTERED and BRUISED, some with broken bones.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Where am I?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: The infirmary. You've been unconscious
dialog: for three days.
text: Percy tries to sit up, but he's IN PAIN. Annabeth shoves a
text: GOBLET filled with a GOLD, GLOWING LIQUID in his face.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Drink this. It'll make you feel better.
text: Percy sniffs it, not sure.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Don't be a weasel.
text: Percy smiles, takes a SIP. Grover and Annabeth watch him
text: expectantly. He looks instantly REJUVENATED.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Good stuff. What is it?
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Ambrosia and nectar. Food of the Gods.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Tastes like my Mom's caramel brownies.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: It always tastes like your favorite food.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: (checks clock)
dialog: Time for more training.
dialog: (to Percy, sarcastic)
dialog: See you on the battlefield... hero.
text: She CLANKS away in her armor, carrying a shield and sword.
text: As Percy watches her, he hears more CLANGING as several kids,
text: covered in dirt, mud and blood, wearing classic GREEK BATTLE
text: ARMOR over jeans and T-shirts, are carried in on STRETCHERS.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: What happened to them?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: She did.
text: Percy grins, thinks it's a joke. Grover's not laughing.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Do you remember anything?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Just some crazy dream. My Mom was there.
dialog: There was a Minotaur... And you were some
dialog: kinda' weird hybrid goat thing--
text: He looks at Grover, then trails his eyes from Grover's face
text: down to his lower half which is completely VISIBLE now, furry
text: arched legs, goat butt, hooves and all.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Actually, I prefer "Satyr".
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Oh. And this is yours.
text: He hands Percy the Minotaur HORN. Percy stares at it. His
text: expression darkens. REALIZATION sets in.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: It was real. All of it was real.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: (ashamed, heartbroken)
dialog: I'm sorry, Percy. It's my fault. I
dialog: blew it. It was my job to protect you.
dialog: Both of you.
dialog: 24.
text: Percy stares at the horn. His expression is sad, filled with
text: despair. He speaks softly, in grief. TEARS fill his eyes.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: My Mom. She's really gone.
scene_heading: INT. INFIRMARY - LATER - DAY
text: Percy is dressed, depressed, walking with Grover down the
text: aisle, past the beds, past the MOANING, BATTERED KIDS. Percy
text: looks at all of the wounded kids.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Where are we?
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM as they step out of the Infirmary and
text: stand at the top of a hill, looking out over...
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Camp Half Blood.
text: The camp is spread across several acres of a beautiful, lush,
text: landscape surrounded by a pine forest. The buildings'
text: architecture is straight out of ancient Greece. Constructed
text: of stone and marble, with weathered, well-worn, facades. A
text: small COLISEUM is visible in the distance.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Created by the Olympians, for their
dialog: offspring. Demigods. Kids like you.
text: Percy stands in awe. Speechless.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMP HALF-BLOOD - LATER
text: Percy and Grover walk through the camp. Hundreds of kids,
text: aged 11 to 21, dressed in modern clothing, are everywhere.
text: They walk past several kids sitting inside a small outdoor
text: amphitheater, as an OLD, BLIND POET recites Homer's Odyssey.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: This is where you guys learn to harness
dialog: your powers, to become leaders,
dialog: warriors... artists... and heroes...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: You got the wrong guy. I'm no hero...
dialog: I'm a screw-up... with dyslexia, ADHD...
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Those are your greatest gifts.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: You call those gifts?
dialog: 25.
text: They pass other kids FIRING ARROWS in an ARCHERY RANGE;
text: throwing JAVELINS; forging WEAPONS in a Blacksmith furnace;
text: making VASES at a potter's wheel.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: When you try to read, the letters seem
dialog: to float off the page, right? That's
dialog: because your brain's hard-wired for
dialog: ancient Greek. Not English. I bet
dialog: you had no trouble reading the book
dialog: Mr. Brunner gave you in detention...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: That was Greek?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: (nods )
dialog: And your ADHD? You're impulsive, you
dialog: can't sit still. Those are your natural
dialog: battle reflexes. They kept you alive
dialog: when you fought the Minotaur. No mortal
dialog: screw-up could defeat the Minotaur,
dialog: Percy. Your blood is special. It's...
dialog: (somber )
dialog: The blood of a God.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: And these kids?... They're all sons
dialog: and daughters of gods?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: And goddesses.
text: They pause at a practice BATTLEFIELD. Annabeth SWORDFIGHTS,
text: beating several stronger, male opponents. Percy WATCHES,
text: very ATTRACTED to her.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: What's her name?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Smokin', huh?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Her name?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Annabeth. Daughter of Athena. Goddess
dialog: of Wisdom.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I thought Athena was a virgin goddess...
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: She was. But you try holding out for
dialog: 10,000 years. I barely make it through
dialog: health class.
text: Percy and Grover walk to the edge of the coliseum. A HORSE
text: RACE is in progress. EIGHT HORSES circle the track in a
text: CLOUD OF DUST. They are SILHOUETTED against the bright rays
text: of the afternoon sun.
text: As the horses reach the finish, the dust clears. Percy's
text: mouth drops when he sees that they are CENTAURS. HALF-MAN,
text: HALF-HORSE. One of the Centaurs walks away, TROTS toward
text: Percy. As the Centaur gets closer, Percy RECOGNIZES him.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Mr. Brunner!?
scene_heading: MR. BRUNNER/CHIRON
dialog: Here, I'm known as Chiron. Nice to see
dialog: you up and around.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: You're... you're...
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: A real horse's ass, I know. I'm sorry I
dialog: had to keep my true form hidden from you,
dialog: but it was for your own good. I hope
dialog: you'll forgive me.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: What happened to your wheelchair?...
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: Only when I'm in mortal form. I could
dialog: never walk on only two legs.
text: He leads Percy and Grover away. They WALK through the camp
dialog: with Chiron.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Is this your camp?
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: No. I'm just an overseer and a trainer.
text: Chiron enters an ALCOVE, nestled in the woods by the lake.
text: Eleven distinct frat-like houses, are arranged around a
text: common area, dotted with old STATUES and ancient FOUNTAINS.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: This is where you'll be staying.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Greek Row.
dialog: 27.
text: The first "house" they pass has several SMOKESTACKS belching
text: BLACK SMOKE. Outside, a few kids covered in sweat and grime
text: work billows and anvils.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
text: The heirs of Hephaestus, smith and weapon-
dialog: maker of the Gods.
text: Chiron and Percy continue on, past a BUILDING that resembles
text: a FORTRESS. BARBED-WIRE fencing surrounds the lawn. ANGRY
text: MUSIC BLASTS from within. A dozen BIG, UGLY, MEAN KIDS are
text: YELLING at each other, some are physically fighting.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
text: The offspring of Ares, God of War.
text: The next home is filled with dozens of HYPER, ENERGETIC KIDS,
text: running through the lawn, playing pranks, laughing. They all
text: have sharp noses, upturned eyebrows and mischievous smiles.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: Those pranksters are the offspring of
text: Hermes, messenger of the gods.
text: One of Hermes' SONS motions to a nearby BROTHER, clearly up
text: to something. He's watching: the sorority house next door.
text: It is decorated with romantic statues and gardens, the most
text: lush home on Greek row. The GIRLS who live here are drop
text: dead gorgeous, most of them outside SUNBATHING.
text: Grover stops dead in his tracks, frozen like he's fighting an
dialog: urge... and desperately losing.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Daughters of Aphrodite, goddess of love
text: and other four letter words.
text: SPRINKLERS go off, drenching the girls. They SCREAM, run
text: inside. Hermes' sons roll on the ground laughing.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: I'll catch up with you guys later.
text: Grover makes a MAD DASH toward the drenched daughters of
text: Aphrodite, CHASING them around the grounds.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: Satyrs. You can never completely train
text: them to stop chasing the nymphs.
text: Chiron and Percy round the "U" and stop at one of the largest
text: homes in Greek Row. The home looks as if it were made of
text: CORAL. A LARGE FOUNTAIN is in front. Chiron turns to Percy.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: Welcome home.
dialog: 28.
text: Percy is taken aback, yet INTRIGUED.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: Your Father built this. For you.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: My Father?
text: Chiron lifts his front legs, and KICKS OPEN the doors.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: Poseidon.
scene_heading: INT. POSEIDON'S PALACE - SAME
text: Percy and Chiron enter Poseidon's home. Most of the interior
text: is taken up by a large INDOOR POOL. The stairways are lined
text: with cascading waterfalls. There are many statues of HORSES.
text: And a wall filled with various ancient, rusted METAL
text: TRIDENTS. Percy stares in AWE.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: Your father is God of the Seas, as well
dialog: as horses and earthquakes. It was his
dialog: wish that you lead a normal life. He
dialog: asked me to watch over you and, when you
dialog: got older, I chose Grover to be your
dialog: protector.
text: Percy looks at the collection of rusted TRIDENTS, grabs one.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Why didn't my mom ever tell me?
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: She couldn't. It was for your own
dialog: safety. There hasn't been a Demi-God
dialog: born of the Big Three in over a hundred
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: The big three... Zeus, Hades and
dialog: Poseidon?...
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: (nods )
dialog: That makes you special, powerful, a
dialog: threat. That's why your Mom married your
text: step-father. His rather pungent odor
dialog: masked the smell of your blood, in case
dialog: you were ever in danger.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Like the Minotaur...
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: So Gabe's ass saved mine?
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: I wouldn't put it that way, but yes.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: But why am I in danger? Why are things
dialog: chasing me, trying to kill me?...
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: Actually. For the time being. They
dialog: prefer that you stay alive.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: They think you've stolen something
dialog: valuable.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: But, I didn't steal anything...
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: I believe you. Not many others do. Zeus
dialog: has convinced almost everyone, that
dialog: you're...
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: The Lightning Thief.
text: Percy is confused. Chiron points to the palace ceiling.
text: Here, is a stunning THREE DIMENSIONAL PAINTING, depicting the
dialog: history of the Gods. It makes the Sistine Chapel look
text: pedestrian. Chiron points to a powerful image of Zeus,
text: riding in the clouds, the powerful MASTER BOLT in hand.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
text: Zeus' Master bolt. The bolt where all
dialog: lightning originates. The most powerful
dialog: weapon ever created, harnessing more
dialog: power than several hydrogen bombs. It
dialog: was stolen four days ago.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Why do they think it was me?
text: Chiron points to an image of Zeus in combat against Poseidon.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: When the bolt disappeared, Zeus naturally
dialog: blamed your father. They've been ina
dialog: power struggle for centuries.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: CHIRON (CONT'D)
dialog: But ancient law forbids Gods to cross
dialog: into each other's realm. Only a Demi-God
dialog: is capable of that. Someone like you.
dialog: Zeus' closest relative.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: But I've never even met my Father...
dialog: And I sure as hell wouldn't do his
dialog: dirty work...
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: Unless the bolt is returned by midnight
dialog: of the summer solstice, two weeks from
dialog: now, there will be a war of the gods.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: (mocking)
text: Zeus vs. Poseidon. Two gods enter the
dialog: ring, only one will leave.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: War between the Gods is a serious matter,
dialog: Percy. Olympians will be forced to
dialog: choose sides. Nature will turn against
dialog: itself. Modern civilization will be
dialog: destroyed.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: (pause, concerned)
dialog: So what do we do?
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: For the next few days, we stay here.
text: Until Zeus calms down. Then we go to
dialog: Olympus, where you'll convince Zeus
dialog: of your innocence.
text: Percy nods.
scene_heading: EXT. POSEIDON'S PALACE - THE NEXT MORNING - DAWN
text: Grover walks up the stairs, of the palace, enters.
scene_heading: INT. POSEIDON'S PALACE - BEDROOM - THE NEXT DAY - DAWN
text: Grover enters, looks around. No sign of Percy.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Percy?
text: No answer. Grover walks around, looks into the pool.
text: FLOATING at the bottom, is Percy. Eyes closed.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Hey! Wake up!
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: PERCY (0.S.)
text: (opens his eyes, sleepy)
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: 6:00 AM. Chiron sent me. He wants
dialog: you to start training.
text: Percy climbs out of the water.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Training for what?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: This isn't celebrity rehab. There
dialog: are things trying to kill you, remember?
dialog: Big. Scary. Things.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMP HALF-BLOOD - BATTLEFIELD - LATER
text: The sky is GRAY, OMINOUS. There are several WEATHERED TENTS
text: scattered around the grounds, the type of tents used on the
text: ancient battlefields of Rome and Greece. Dozens of kids, all
text: in armor, SHARPEN their swords, practice battle moves.
text: Percy walks onto the battlefield, wearing ARMOR, holding a
text: heavy shield and sword. He looks extremely uncomfortable and
text: awkward in it. Grover is beside him.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: How do you move in all this stuff?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: You get used to it. Or you get killed.
text: Percy gives a nervous laugh. Grover is dead serious. When
text: the other kids see Percy, they all stop and stare, whisper to
text: each other... "Is that him?" The Lightning Thief?... Son of
dialog: Poseidon?... Slayed the Minotaur..."
text: Percy notices Annabeth, wearing a RED PLUME surrounded by her
text: team, all wearing Red Plumes. Annabeth uses her sword point
text: to draw a game plan in the dirt. CHIRON trots up.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: Heroes! Warriors! Fall in!
text: The young warriors line up in FORMATION by teams. RED PLUMES
text: on one side; BLUE PLUMES on the other. Annabeth is CAPTAIN
dialog: of the Red soldiers.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: Today, we have some new blood in
dialog: our midst. Percy? Step forward.
dialog: 32.
text: Percy pauses, then STEPS FORWARD. The kids crane their necks
text: to get a good look at Percy, FASCINATED by him. Percy smiles
text: an Annabeth, but she just stares at him stoically.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: This is Percy Jackson. He's going to
dialog: need a team.
text: LUKE, a small, energetic, impish kid with a thin sloping nose
text: and a mischievous smile, steps forward. Luke is CAPTAIN of
text: the Blue soldiers. He holds an ancient BRONZE SHIELD with
text: SEVERAL WARRIORS carved into the surface.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: We'll take him.
text: Luke hands Percy a blue plumed helmet.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I'm Luke. Son of Hermes.
text: Percy takes his helmet and... BUZZZ! Percy gets a a HUGE
text: ELECTRICAL SHOCK from the helmet! SPARKS FLY! Percy jumps
text: back, drops the helmet. Luke turns to his teammates.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I dunno'... Maybe it isn't so safe to
dialog: have a lightning thief on our team...
text: Everyone is staring at Percy. Suddenly, they all break up
text: LAUGHING. Luke picks up Percy's helmet, removes an
text: electrical JOY BUZZER from inside. Luke grins at Percy.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Sorry. Just bustin' your balls.
dialog: Couldn't resist. My old man's God
dialog: of the Pranksters... It's in the blood.
text: Percy forces a smile, nods, takes the blue helmet from Luke.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: You all know the rules. First team to
dialog: capture the enemy flag wins. Assume your
dialog: last positions and remember... We fight
dialog: to build each other up, not to tear each
dialog: other down. Use your skills on the
dialog: battlefield, but save your true anger for
dialog: the dark forces.
text: The Red soldiers start MARCHING OFF into the forest. Percy
text: turns to Chiron, NERVOUS.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I thought this was a game... I don't
dialog: know how to use this stuff.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: You defeated the Minotaur.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: But I had that cool flic-a-bic-sword...
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: That would give you an unfair advantage
dialog: over the red team. Just relax.
dialog: Demigods all have some degree of
dialog: inherited skill. Hercules was only a
dialog: level three when I began teaching him.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: You taught Hercules?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Chiron trained all the great Demigods.
dialog: Hercules, Alexander the Great, Bruce Lee,
dialog: Michael Jordan... turned them all into
dialog: heroes.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: They turned themselves into heroes. I
dialog: only trained them.
dialog: (confident)
dialog: Just do what comes naturally, Percy.
dialog: You'll be fine.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Blue team... Move out!
text: They march off into the forest.
scene_heading: INT. PINE FOREST - LATER - DAY
text: Reds and Blues CLASH! Kids THRASH relentlessly at each
text: other, dealing powerful blows. Swords CLANG against shields
text: and armor. In the midst of it all, Annabeth savagely HACKS
text: her way through dozens of the blue soldiers. Several of the
text: blue team RUN OFF. Annabeth removes a BOW, pulls ARROWS from
text: a quiver and FIRES a barrage at the fleeing blue soldiers.
text: The arrows PIN kids to trees, safely, by piercing through
text: their clothes, etc. One KID is TRAPPED by an ARROW on each
text: side of his head and one between his legs. Annabeth gets
text: right in his face, SNARLS.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Where is Percy Jackson?
scene_heading: INT. FOREST - ELSEWHERE - DAY
text: Percy, Luke, and the blue soldiers are CAUTIOUSLY MOVING
text: through the forest. Percy LOOKS AROUND. Nervous. Suddenly,
text: several Red soldiers appear, COMING RIGHT AT THEM.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Incoming!
text: Blues and Reds CLASH. METAL ON METAL. Percy DUCKS, avoids
text: blows and ends up face-to-face with an angry SON OF ARES.
text: The Son of Ares comes at Percy, SWINGING. Percy DEFLECTS the
text: first several blows, but gets KNOCKED DOWN by the proceeding
text: FLURRY OF HITS. LUKE appears and with two FAST SWINGS, takes
text: out the Son of Ares. Luke EXTENDS his hand to Percy.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Shake it off.
text: As Percy gets to his feet, more red soldiers ATTACK. Luke
text: and the other Blues FIGHT BACK. A red soldier starts
text: PUMMELING Percy. Percy FIGHTS BACK. The two kids are in a
text: HEATED BATTLE. Percy manages to deliver a HARD KICK to the
text: red soldier's midsection. The red soldier FALLS to the
text: ground. Momentarily WINDED.
text: Percy SPRINTS into the pine forest. Red soldiers FOLLOW.
scene_heading: EXT. DEEP IN THE PINE FOREST - DAY
text: Percy STOPS, catches his breath, next to a SMALL CREEK.
text: Percy looks around. NO SIGN of his pursuers. Percy takes
text: off his helmet, BREATHLESS.
text: He kneels beside the creek, SPLASHES water on his face. He
text: sees something REFLECTED in the water... A RED FLAG. It's a
text: FEW FEET AWAY on the other side of the creek.
text: Percy steps INTO THE WATER. He WADES across the creek.
text: TOWARD the flag.
text: Percy STEPS OUT of the water, walks TOWARD the red flag. He
text: REACHES forward... about to PICK IT UP...
text: A DOZEN RED SOLDIERS DROP from the trees. They SURROUND
text: Percy. He PUTS ON his helmet, takes a DEFENSIVE STANCE.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH (0.S.)
dialog: Did you think it would be that easy?
text: ANNABETH appears..
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: My mother is the Goddess of Wisdom and
dialog: Battle Strategy. You know what that
dialog: means? I never lose.
text: The Red Soldiers ATTACK Percy. Percy is able to DEFLECT
text: nearly half the blows. But they soon OVERCOME him. He is
scene_heading: HIT. SEVERAL TIMES.
dialog: 35.
text: Percy FALLS to his knees. He is BLOODIED. BEATEN.
text: EXHAUSTED. Annabeth steps forward, looks down at him.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: You actually claim to be the Son of
dialog: Poseidon and the slayer of the Minotaur!?
text: The other Red soldiers BACK AWAY, give Annabeth her space.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Stand up. Fight.
text: Percy slowly GETS TO HIS FEET. Annabeth EXTENDS her sword.
text: ARMED and READY. Percy EXTENDS his sword.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Let's see what you're really made of.
text: Their EYES MEET, displaying a shared sense of intense
text: EXCITEMENT and ATTRACTION. They begin a HEATED SWORDFIGHT.
text: Percy LUNGES, Annabeth SLASHES his arm. Percy tries to
text: defend against Annabeth's ASSAULT. He's NO MATCH for her.
text: Annabeth is more ADVANCED, more EXPERIENCED...
text: Several RED and BLUE SOLDIERS gather on opposite sides of the
text: creek, WATCHING the fight. Luke, Grover and Chiron ARRIVE.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Should we stop it?
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: Not yet.
text: Annabeth SLASHES Percy at every opportunity... Percy's arms
text: and legs have deep CUTS on them. There's a WOUND above his
text: right eye. He is WEAK, can barely hold his sword up.
text: Annabeth is starting to SYMPATHIZE with him...
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Surrender...
text: Percy shakes his head. NO WAY. He attacks SLOWLY,
text: EXHAUSTED. His swings are LABORED. Annabeth easily DEFLECTS
text: the blows.
text: Annabeth RAISES her sword, flips it in the air, grabs it by
text: the blade and SWINGS IT at Percy's head. CRACK! Percy's
text: helmet FLIES OFF his head. He FALLS down, into the shallow
text: waters at the CREEK'S EDGE. Almost UNCONSCIOUS.
text: The red soldiers RAISE their swords in the air and chant:
text: ATHENA! ATHENA! ATHENA!
text: They CONGRATULATE Annabeth, but she doesn't look happy. She
text: watches Percy, feeling REMORSEFUL.
dialog: 36.
text: Percy's bloody, battered body LIES A FEW FEET FROM THE
text: RIVER'S EDGE. Blood DRIPS from his mouth. A DISTANT MALE
text: VOICE echoes in his head.
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Go to the water, Percy... The water...
text: Percy uses his last bit of strength, CRAWLING toward the
text: water. He COLLAPSES... His FINGERTIPS TOUCH THE WATER.
text: Suddenly... WATER from the creek SLITHERS up Percy's hand and
text: arm, moving around Percy's body. The water CRAWLS up Percy's
text: skin and COVERS HIM in a thin wet veneer.
text: Percy's wounds INSTANTLY HEAL.
text: Percy's EYES OPEN. His muscles TIGHTEN. His hand moves and
text: GRABS the handle of his sword. He slowly RISES to his feet.
text: Behind him, the water in the creek SHOOTS UP into the air...
text: All of the kids stare in AWE. Annabeth turns to see what is
text: happening. She is struck SPEECHLESS by the sight of Percy,
text: dripping wet, standing in front of a GIANT WATER TRIDENT.
text: SIX RED SOLDIERS rush forward to ATTACK. Fighting like an
text: expert soldier, Percy quickly and effortlessly TAKES THEM
text: DOWN, one by one.
text: Then, Annabeth CHARGES Percy. Their blades CLASH. It's a
text: hard fought, INTENSE DUEL.
text: Percy skillfully KNOCKS the sword out of Annabeth's hand and
text: sends her FALLING to the ground. He stands over Annabeth,
text: staring confidently down into her eyes. The tip of his sword
text: is POINTED at her HEART.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: You drool when you're impressed. Wipe
dialog: your mouth.
text: Annabeth wipes her mouth and then... exchanges a slow smile
text: with Percy. He RAISES his sword high in the air.
speaker_heading: PERCY
speaker_heading: POSEIDON!
text: Kids start chanting "POSEIDON! POSEIDON!" but it soon turns
text: to "PERCY! PERCY! PERCY!"
text: Luke can't believe what he just witnessed. Grover runs up
text: and practically tackles Percy. Standing apart from the
text: crowd, CHIRON watches. A small smile appears on his lips.
text: Percy looks at Chiron, gives a small, confident nod.
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: EXT. COMMON'S AREA - OUTSIDE - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: A huge BONFIRE rages in the common's area of Greek Row. Kids
text: from all the houses are celebrating, like warriors after a
text: battle. SATYRS and CENTAURS mingle with the kids. GLOWING
text: AMBROSIA flows from large jars into mugs and goblets. A WILD
text: BOAR cooks on a spit.
text: Percy and Grover work their way toward the Ambrosia. Kids
text: congratulate Percy, patting him on the back. He seems ill at
text: ease with the attention. Two APHRODITE GIRLS smile at Percy,
text: oozing sex appeal.
scene_heading: APHRODITE GIRL ONE
dialog: I love a man who can handle a sword.
text: Nearby, Annabeth is talking to a few kids. She glances over,
text: SEES the girls fawning over Percy. A flicker of jealousy
text: registers on Annabeth's face. The Aphrodite Girls turn to
text: exit, each giving Percy a kiss to the cheek. Grover nearly
text: faints. Annabeth walks up to Percy.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Feeling like a hero?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: More like a mutant. I'm not gonna' grow
dialog: a fish tail or gills or anything like
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Not likely. Although a huge ego isn't
text: out of the question.
text: Annabeth fills a goblet with golden Ambrosia. Percy is
text: attracted to her, yet cautious, suspicious.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: You know... you almost killed me out
dialog: there. I could've died... If I was
dialog: normal.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: But you aren't. Besides... I always
dialog: knew.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: How?
text: She hands him the goblet of Ambrosia.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: You drank the Ambrosia. There's a reason
dialog: it's called "food of the gods." If a
dialog: pure mortal drank Ambrosia, it would kill
dialog: them. Your blood would have boiled and
dialog: your bones turned to dust.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: But you didn't know that when you gave
dialog: it to me.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Women's intuition.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Intuition? You bet my life on intuition?
text: She shrugs, smiles, takes a long drink of Ambrosia. Percy
text: NARROWS his eyes, looking at her.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I get the sense that you don't like
dialog: me very much...
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: It's possible. I mean... Our parents
dialog: hate each other.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: They do?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: (nods )
dialog: And I definitely have strong feelings
dialog: for you. I just haven't decided if
dialog: they're positive or negative.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Let me know when you figure it out.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: You'll be the first.
text: She smiles, raises her glass, DRINKS. Percy does the same.
text: Their eyes are LOCKED. A SPARK of romance.
text: She suddenly FREEZES, spots something OFFSCREEN. In the
text: distance, Annabeth sees THREE PAIRS of glowing RED DOTS.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: No... That can't be possible...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: What?
dialog: 39.
text: He turns. The red eyes are getting CLOSER... and CLOSER...
text: Annabeth screams, warning the others...
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: HELLHOUNDS !
text: Everyone stops what they're doing. The kids see the trio of
text: red eyes. They PANIC, RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: How did they get in?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: I don't know... The camp's under a veil
dialog: of protection against underworld
dialog: forces... Someone must have lifted it...
text: THREE HELLHOUNDS charge into the camp. They are DEMONIC
text: BEASTS, hounds the size of buffalo. Lava-red eyes, fangs
text: like daggers. Chiron runs up, SHOVES Percy out of the way,
text: just as one of the HOUNDS charges right at him.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: Grover! Get Percy out of here!
text: Chiron removes his PEN, flicks it. The pen TRANSFORMS INTO
text: THE SWORD. Centaurs and kids SPRING INTO ACTION. They grab
text: THEIR SWORDS, BOWS AND ARROWS, and prepare to FIGHT. Percy
dialog: GRABS a sword.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Percy, no!
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: They need help...
text: The Hellhounds are RUTHLESS. They DRAG one kid away, another
text: gets MAULED. Annabeth fires a DOZEN ARROWS into one of the
text: beasts but it DOESN'T PHASE the creature.
text: The three Hellhounds CIRCLE BACK, seeking out Percy. They
text: see him and CHARGE AT PERCY. Chiron LEAPS into the
text: Hellhound's path and STABS ONE with his sword. It FALLS to
text: the ground. DEAD.
text: THREE OTHER CENTAURS surround another Hellhound. It CHARGES
text: right through them. Chiron HURLS the sword. It IMPALES the
text: beast, killing it INSTANTLY.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Chiron! Watch out--
text: The last Hellhound HITS CHIRON. He FALLS, BLEEDING.
text: Percy immediately GRABS Chiron's sword. The Hellhound sees
text: him, CHARGES. Percy RUNS STRAIGHT for the Hellhound!
dialog: 40.
text: They are on a COLLISION COURSE. At the last second before
text: impact, Percy DROPS and SLIDES UNDER under the beast, raising
text: his sword. It SLASHES along the beast's underside. The
text: hellhound is mortally WOUNDED.
text: Percy stands, looks down at the DYING beast. Grover and
text: Annabeth JOIN Percy. The beast lifts its head, looks at
text: Percy. The beast SPEAKS. A slow, weak, DEMONIC VOICE
speaker_heading: HELLHOUND
dialog: Where... is the bolt?...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I don't have it. I'm not the thief.
speaker_heading: HELLHOUND
dialog: Liar... If you want your Mother back...
dialog: bring Hades the bolt...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: My Mother's dead.
speaker_heading: HELLHOUND
text: No... She is still alive... abducted by
dialog: Hades... Bring him the lightning bolt...
dialog: in exchange for your Mother...
text: The beast closes its eyes, its breathing slows to a STOP.
text: DEAD. Percy exchanges a look with Annabeth and Grover. He
text: turns, sees Chiron lying on the ground, his leg badly
text: wounded. Percy RUNS to Chiron, Grover and Annabeth FOLLOW.
scene_heading: INT. CHIRON'S STABLE/HOME - LATER
text: Filled with books, weapons, and alchemical devices. Chiron
text: is sitting as Annabeth BANDAGES his leg wound. Grover and
text: Percy are watching, but Percy's mind is miles away. He's
text: flicking the pen-sword on and off. Chiron looks at Percy.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: That sword has a name.
text: Percy reads the GREEK name ENGRAVED along the sword's handle.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Anaklusmos.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: In English, it means "Riptide." I want
dialog: you to keep it.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Really?
dialog: 4l.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: You'll be needing it more than me. It's
text: made of celestial bronze and lethal to
dialog: any creature from the underworld.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Hades never sent his creatures into our
dialog: camp before.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
text: With Olympus in turmoil he will only get
dialog: bolder. And as long as he thinks Percy
dialog: has the bolt, he'll stop at nothing.
text: Percy stands, walks to Chiron, looks at him. Very solemn.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Chiron. The hellhound... It spoke
dialog: to me... told me that.
dialog: 
dialog: (swallows back emotion)
dialog: My Mom is alive.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: She was abducted by Hades. Is that
dialog: possible?
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: (nods )
dialog: Hades has been known to abduct the
text: living... Like Persephone. His wife.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: The hellhound said that I can get her
dialog: back, in return for the bolt...
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: But you don't have the bolt.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I know... But you said I could convince
dialog: Zeus that I'm not the thief... Can't I
dialog: do the same with Hades? When he realizes
dialog: I don't have the bolt, he'll give me my
dialog: Mother back.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: It isn't that simple.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: Zeus and Hades are very different. Zeus
dialog: can be stubborn, but he is honorable.
dialog: Fair. Hades is a master of darkness and
dialog: deceit. The personification of evil.
dialog: When he finds out that you aren't the
dialog: lightning thief, he'll kill both you and
dialog: your Mother.
text: There is SILENCE. Percy is DEVASTATED. HELPLESS.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: So... What can I do?...
text: Chiron rises up, his wound dressed. He places his arm firmly
text: on Percy's shoulder, LOOKS him in the eye.
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: Stay with our original plan. Tomorrow
dialog: we go to Olympus. Once you've convinced
dialog: Zeus of your innocence, we will do
dialog: everything in our power to bring your
dialog: Mother back. I swear.
text: Percy, his face filled with FRUSTRATION and DISAPPOINTMENT,
text: looks at Chiron, and slowly nods. Grover and Annabeth
text: exchange a glance.
scene_heading: EXT. POSEIDON'S PALACE - LATER - NIGHT
text: The door OPENS. Percy peeks outside. The coast is clear.
text: He steps out with his backpack flung over his shoulder. As
text: he starts to walk away, a VOICE INTERRUPTS...
speaker_heading: GROVER (0.S.)
dialog: Going somewhere?
text: Grover is sitting ON THE ROOF, chewing on a bushy plant. He
text: DROPS DOWN in front of Percy.
speaker_heading: PERCY
text: Out for a walk.
text: Percy steps around him, continues on his way. Then Annabeth
text: WALKS OUT from behind the fountain, right in his path.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: One small victory and you think you're
dialog: ready to take on the world?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: (passionate)
dialog: Look... I just found out that my Mother
dialog: is still alive. She's the most important
dialog: thing in my life. And I'm going to get
text: her back.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: You're going to walk all the way to Hades
dialog: and fight the Lord of the Underworld?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: If I have to.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Do you even know how to get there?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: If I had to guess I'd say: down.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: I can't let you do this.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I wasn't asking for permission.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: I mean, I can't let you go by yourself.
dialog: I'm your protector. I'm going with you.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I don't need any help. This is something
dialog: I have to do alone.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: We weren't asking for permission.
dialog: Percy looks at Annabeth. You too?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Earlier today you wanted to kill me, now
dialog: you want to risk your life to help me?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: My mom always looks out for heroes. It's
dialog: in my blood. And if we're going to
dialog: succeed, it's going to take some brains,
text: not just pretty blue eyes, a fancy pen,
text: and a set of disgusting hooves.
dialog: (to Grover)
dialog: No offense.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Offense taken.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: So like it or not, Percy, you've got
dialog: company.
text: Percy looks at them, resigns himself.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: How do we get there?
dialog: 44,
scene_heading: INT. HERMES HOUSE - LUKE'S ROOM - LATER - NIGHT
text: It is filled with fun house novelties: trick mirrors, clowns,
text: a fortune teller machine, etc. Percy, Grover, and Annabeth
text: sit across from Luke.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What makes you think I would know
dialog: something like that?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Your dad's the Messenger of the Gods.
dialog: He's one of the few who can get in and
dialog: out of the underworld. Surely he's
dialog: told you something.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: My dad's a prick and I've never even
dialog: met him.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Then we have a lot in common.
text: Luke gives Percy a devilish smile.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: But I have broken into my Father's
dialog: house on several occasions.
text: Luke CLIMBS A LADDER to grab a SHOEBOX from a top shelf. He
text: TOSSES the shoebox to Percy, who opens it... Inside, is a
text: pair of WINGED SNEAKERS. They're VERY COOL.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Flying shoes?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: My gift to you. Look underneath.
text: Percy lifts the shoes out of the box. Beneath them, is a
text: folded, yellowed piece of PARCHMENT. Percy OPENS it,
text: revealing a tattered MAP OF THE UNITED STATES.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: People have gone to the underworld,
text: without having to be dead. Hercules did.
dialog: And Orpheus. Getting in is the easy
dialog: part. It's getting out that's the trick.
text: Luke points to the MAP. The town of RUMSON, NEW JERSEY
text: begins to GLOW. An ADDRESS magically appears next to it.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: This will lead you to the locations
text: of the three green pearls.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Green pearls?
speaker_heading: LUKE
text: This is a copy of a map that belongs to
text: Hades' wife, Persephone. She keeps the
text: green pearls hidden for her many lovers,
dialog: to use when Hades is away. They provide
dialog: a quick escape from the underworld. You
dialog: can use them to get out.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: How do they work?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Put a drop of your blood on the pearl,
dialog: then shatter it. Close your eyes, and
dialog: imagine the place you want to go. The
dialog: pearls will take you there.
text: They nod. Luke gives Percy one last item... His ANCIENT,
text: ENGRAVED BRONZE SHIELD, with a SHINY GOLDEN HANDLE.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Take this.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Your shield?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: For protection.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: (touched)
dialog: Thanks, Luke.
text: Percy stands, to exit. Luke CALLS out to him.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Percy.
text: Percy LOOKS BACK.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: If you run into my Father along the
dialog: way...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Kick his ass for me.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Deal.
dialog: 46.
scene_heading: INT. GREYHOUND BUS - LATER - NIGHT
text: Percy, Grover, and Annabeth sit next to each other on the
text: half-full bus. Percy is studying the MAP.
speaker_heading: PERCY (V.O.)
dialog: And that's how yours truly, Percy
dialog: Jackson, son of Poseidon, ended up on
dialog: the highway to Hell.
scene_heading: AC/DC'S "HIGHWAY TO HELL" FILLS THE SOUNDTRACK. CAMERA
text: DOLLIES into the map, zeroing in to the first location:
scene_heading: NEW JERSEY.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW JERSEY - THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON - DAY
text: A deserted, two lane highway in the badlands of New Jersey.
text: The Greyhound bus pulls to the SIDE OF THE ROAD. Percy,
text: Grover, and Annabeth step off the bus, all wearing back-
text: packs. The bus PULLS AWAY. Across the street, is...
text: AUNTIE EM'S GARDEN EMPORIUM. It's a rundown, corrugated
text: steel "SHACK" with dead plants, cement fountains, and a dozen
text: weathered statues -- CHERUBS, LIONS, ANGELS. The place feels
text: deserted, save for TWO CARS parked in front: A rusted PICK-
text: UP TRUCK and a 1993 CADILLAC ELDORADO with ILLINOIS plates.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: You're sure this is the place?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: That's what the map says.
scene_heading: INT. AUNTIE EM'S OFFICE/SHACK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: The kids ENTER. It's dark, dusty, and DESERTED.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Hello? Anyone here?
text: Grover picks up a cobwebbed phone, LISTENS for a dial tone.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Dead.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Auntie 'Em must've gone back to Kansas.
text: Percy opens the CASH REGISTER's drawer. It's full of American
text: CASH and several ancient Greek GOLD COINS (DRACHMAS) .
text: Percy pushes open the creaky SCREEN DOOR, leading to the back
text: lot. He steps OUTSIDE.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Check this out.
dialog: 47.
scene_heading: EXT. AUNTIE EM'S GARDEN EMPORIUM - BACK LOT - DAY
text: Annabeth and Grover JOIN Percy. A winding, serpentine gravel
text: path leads through acres of STATUARY. Hundreds of LIFE-LIKE
text: STATUES create a maze-like atmosphere. There are ANIMALS,
text: TOURISTS, SOLDIERS from all eras, GARGOYLES, etc.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Must be thousands of 'em. How are we
dialog: supposed to find a pearl in this cement
dialog: stack?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: You're the grand strategist.
text: Grover walks to an old "ENJOY COCA-COLA" ice cooler.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Anyone thirsty?
text: He opens it, startled to find dozens of LIVE MICE scurrying
text: around inside. He quickly CLOSES the door.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Never mind.

dialog: Let's split up. Check every statue.
text: The pearl could be inside one of them.
text: They walk into the statue maze and SPLIT OFF in three
text: directions. As they do, a GARGOYLE'S HEAD appears to TURN,
text: ever so slightly, in their direction.
scene_heading: EXT. STATUE MAZE - GROVER'S PATH - DAY
text: Grover HOBBLES among the statues, TAPPING them with an
text: ANCIENT DAGGER. The statues are all SOLID and very LIFE-
text: LIKE, in strange, everyday poses. Grover taps a ROMAN
text: SOLDIER. SOLID. Grover moves on, the Roman Solider BEGINS
text: TO MOVE and LIFTS HIS SWORD.
text: Grover, hearing a NOISE, LOOKS BACK. NOTHING. The Roman
text: Soldier is STIFF. But now his sword is HELD HIGH. Grover
text: DOESN'T NOTICE and MOVES ON.
scene_heading: EXT. STATUE MAZE - PERCY'S PATH - DAY
text: Percy TAPS the statues. All SOLID. He comes upon a
text: relatively new statue: a MIDDLE AGED MAN wearing a Chicago
text: Cubs hat, holding a map as if he were asking for directions.
text: There's a look of HORROR on the man's face.
text: At the end of the row, Percy sees a LARGE STATUE of a
text: SLEEPING, COILED COBRA. Percy walks TOWARD it.
dialog: 48.
scene_heading: EXT. STATUE MAZE - ANNABETH'S PATH - DAY
text: Annabeth taps each statue and MARKS THEM with an "X" after
text: she's examined them. From the corner of Annabeth's eye, she
text: sees a QUICK BLUR. Someone is RUNNING BETWEEN THE STATUES.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Hello? Is someone there?
text: She turns and... SHOCK! Annabeth runs into a crazed, SCARED
text: HYSTERICAL WOMAN, in her late fifties.
speaker_heading: HYSTERICAL WOMAN
dialog: Have to leave... have to get out...
dialog: She's coming...
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Who's coming? What's going on?
speaker_heading: HYSTERICAL WOMAN
dialog: We stopped... For directions... Bill...
dialog: My husband... Stone...
text: The Woman GRABS Annabeth, PULLS her through the maze...
scene_heading: EXT. STATUE MAZE - GROVER'S PATH - DAY
text: As Grover walks, FIVE MORE STATUES come to life. They FOLLOW
text: Grover like cement zombies, lead by the Roman Soldier. Every
text: time Grover TURNS BACK, the statues assume their FROZEN
text: POSITION. Grover stops in front of a statue of an OLD SATYR.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Hey. You look like my Uncle Ferdinand.
dialog: But that's impossible. Uncle Ferdinand
dialog: was killed by Medusa--
dialog: (sudden panic, swallows)
dialog: Auntie 'Em.
text: WHACK! A CONCRETE SWORD BLADE BARELY MISSES Grover and
text: SHATTERS Uncle Ferdinand. Grover SPINS and finds himself
text: SURROUNDED BY LIVING STATUES. They are CLOSING IN ON HIM.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Percy! Annabeth! We're in Medusa's
dialog: lair!
speaker_heading: ON PERCY
text: Standing in front of the coiled Cobra as he hears Grover's
text: warning. Suddenly the Serpent's EYES OPEN, revealing that
text: one of them is a GREEN PEARL.
text: The Cobra STRIKES at Percy. He ROLLS AWAY just in the nick
text: of time. Percy WHIPS out his pen, CLICKS IT. The pen
text: transforms into RIPTIDE...
dialog: 49,
speaker_heading: ON ANNABETH
text: The Hysterical Woman LEADS Annabeth through the statue maze.
speaker_heading: HYSTERICAL WOMAN
dialog: Have to... get out... before... she
dialog: finds us...
text: Annabeth tries to break free, but the woman's grip is STRONG.
speaker_heading: ON GROVER
text: The statues CLOSE IN. Grover RAISES his crutches like
text: they're Chinese fighting sticks. He KICKS OFF his shoes,
text: exposing his HOOVES.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: You ugly stiffs want a fight?
text: Grover goes all Shaolin-Satyr on their stone asses. He
text: WHACKS them with his crutches, KICKS them with his powerful
text: hooves. ONE KICK and the statues CRUMBLE.
speaker_heading: ON PERCY
text: The Cobra's tail WHIPS at him. Percy SLAMS into a group of
text: statues, KNOCKS THEM OVER like bowling pins. Percy RISES UP.
text: The Cobra STRIKES AGAIN. Percy DIVES out of the way...
text: ++.jJust as GROVER leaps into the action. The Cobra TURNS
text: toward Grover. And in that instant, Percy HURLS his sword.
text: Riptide FLIES THROUGH THE AIR and IMPALES the Cobra, right
text: BELOW THE EYE.
text: The Cobra FALLS, CRUMBLING into a hundred pieces. The GREEN
text: PEARL (the size of a golf ball) ROLLS to Percy's feet. He
text: picks it up. Grover picks up the sword and it TURNS BACK to
text: a pen. He HANDS IT to Percy, who is concerned, worried.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Where's Annabeth?
speaker_heading: ON ANNABETH
text: The Hysterical Woman continues to PULL Annabeth through the
text: maze of statues. Annabeth finally STOPS the woman.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Look! You've got to tell me what's
dialog: going on! Who are we running from?!?
speaker_heading: MEDUSA (0.S.)
dialog: Leaving so soon?
text: Annabeth turns to the direction of the VOICE. A WOMAN,
text: dressed all in black, is standing there.
dialog: 50.
text: She is wearing a LONG BLACK GOWN, that covers everything but
text: her hands. Her hair is wrapped in a BLACK TURBAN. She wears
scene_heading: IMPENETRABLE BLACK SUNGLASSES. This is MEDUSA.
speaker_heading: MEDUSA
dialog: Leaving so soon?
text: The Hysterical Woman SCREAMS. Annabeth BACKS AWAY. Medusa
text: looks at Annabeth, sniffs the air around her.
speaker_heading: MEDUSA
dialog: You have such beautiful gray eyes. I've
dialog: only seen eyes like that once before...
text: Medusa slowly starts to UNWRAP her turban.
speaker_heading: MEDUSA
dialog: +..on the face of the bitch that did
dialog: this to me.
text: As she unwraps her turban, we see the FACE of Medusa for the
text: first time... greenish, cracked, distorted, and PULSATING.
text: She removes the last of the turban, revealing the LIVING,
text: HISSING SNAKES that are her hair. The snakes are SNAPPING at
text: each other. ANGRY. Annabeth is FREAKED.
speaker_heading: MEDUSA
dialog: The daughter of Athena here in my
dialog: emporium. And my hair so unruly.
text: Medusa walks to the Coca-Cola cooler and OPENS IT. Medusa
text: bends down, LOWERS her head into the cooler. When she pulls
text: her head out, each of her hair-snakes has a MOUSE in its
text: mouth, swallowing them. It's a HORRIFIC SIGHT. This causes
text: the snakes to CALM down slightly, stop fighting each other.
text: Medusa approaches the girls. Annabeth recoils in horror as
text: the snakes SNAP at her. Medusa LOWERS her sunglasses...
speaker_heading: MEDUSA
dialog: I've seen your eyes. It's time for you
dialog: to see mine.
text: She takes off her glasses, revealing her GLOWING YELLOW EYES.
text: Annabeth quickly LOOKS AWAY. The Hysterical Woman CAN'T
text: RESIST a peek. She looks and is HYPNOTIZED. As she stares
text: into Medusa's eyes, she begins to TURN TO STONE. Her hand
text: TURNS TO STONE, still holding Annabeth's arm. Annabeth
text: shudders, CAN'T BREAK FREE from the cement grip.
text: Medusa MOVES her face to within inches of Annabeth's face.
text: The snakes "FEEL" Annabeth's face, as if they were the
text: fingers of a blind person. Annabeth keeps her EYES SEALED.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: MEDUSA
dialog: What a wonderful addition you'll make to
dialog: my collection. Or perhaps I'll send you
text: back to Mom. One piece at a time.
scene_heading: EXT. STATUE MAZE - DAY
text: Percy and Grover WATCH from the cover of the statues.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: How are we supposed to fight something
dialog: we can't look at?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: You can look at her reflection. Ina
dialog: mirror or something.
text: Grover pulls an iTOUCH from his pocket, holds it up. Medusa
text: is visible in the REFLECTIVE BACK. Percy GRABS it.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: You get Annabeth while I distract Medusa.
text: Percy sighs, SNEAKS OFF, iTouch in one hand, the pen in the
text: other. He DUCKS behind a large statue, holds out the iTouch
text: to get a VIEW of Medusa, who is still in Annabeth's face.
speaker_heading: MEDUSA
dialog: Sooner or later you will open those big
dialog: grey eyes. The temptation to look is too
dialog: hard to resist.
speaker_heading: PERCY (0.S.)
dialog: I could resist your ugly-ass face for
text: a looooong time.
text: Medusa SPINS around, hisses.
speaker_heading: MEDUSA
dialog: Who is that!? Who's there!?
text: Medusa WALKS to the edge of the statue maze. She looks
text: around, SNIFFS the air. Percy MOVES SWIFTLY from statue to
text: statue, keeping a view of Medusa in his iTouch mirror.
speaker_heading: MEDUSA
dialog: I can smell you, Demigod. Come out and
dialog: I may let you live.
text: Medusa WALKS into the statue maze. Seconds later, Grover
text: RUNS OUT, to Annabeth. He WHISPERS to her.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: You can open your eyes. It's me, Grover.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: (opens her eyes)
dialog: Grover! Thank Gods. Auntie Em is--
text: Grover SLAMS HIS CRUTCH INTO the arm of the Hysterical Woman
text: statue. It CRUMBLES, releasing Annabeth.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Medusa. We know.
scene_heading: INT. STATUE MAZE - DAY
text: Medusa RACES through the maze, honing in on Percy. Even the
text: snakes are SEARCHING, LOOKING AROUND. But Percy RUNS AHEAD,
text: watching her every move in his iTouch's reflective surface.
speaker_heading: MEDUSA
dialog: Who are you? Why are you here?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: The name is Percy Jackson...
text: He stealthily DUCKS to another position. Medusa FOLLOWS.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Son of Poseidon.
text: As Medusa gets CLOSER and CLOSER, Percy grips his PEN.
speaker_heading: MEDUSA
dialog: So it is true. The mighty Poseidon has
text: a child.
text: Percy DOESN'T RESPOND. Medusa is TOO CLOSE. A few more
text: steps and she'll be in STRIKING DISTANCE.
speaker_heading: MEDUSA
dialog: You can't hide for long, Lightning Thief.
dialog: These statues are not just my victims...
text: She lets out a LOUD, TERRIFYING HISSSSSSS.
speaker_heading: MEDUSA
dialog: They are my slaves.
text: The statues near Percy COME TO LIFE, GRAB HIM. The iTouch
text: FALLS to the ground.
text: Medusa STEPS forward, gets RIGHT IN Percy's face. He CLOSES
text: his eyes. The snakes are all posed to STRIKE at once.
speaker_heading: MEDUSA
dialog: I'll give you a choice. Give me the
dialog: lightning bolt... Or die by the poison
dialog: fangs of my serpents...
dialog: 53.
text: A CAR HORN BLARES! Medusa LOOKS UP, sees...
text: Her rusted PICK-UP TRUCK, CRASHING through the path of
text: statues, HEADING DOWN THE PATH, toward them. GROVER is at
text: the wheel, ANNABETH is beside him. Both are BLINDFOLDED.
text: Percy uses the distraction to KICK Medusa away. He CLICKS
text: the pen, turns it INTO THE SWORD and BREAKS FREE from the
dialog: statue, just as...
text: ...the PICK-UP PLOWS into the statue maze. Statues TUMBLE
text: and CRUMBLE. As the dust clears, Medusa LOOKS AROUND
text: angrily. She sees NO SIGN of Percy. She sees the iTouch,
text: lying in the rubble. Medusa PICKS IT UP. She turns it
text: around to the SHINY SIDE. She sees PERCY'S REFLECTION. He's
text: STANDING RIGHT BEHIND HER.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Add this to your playlist.
text: Percy SWINGS THE SWORD. WHACK! Medusa's head GOES FLYING.
text: It HITS the windshield of the truck and FALLS to the ground.
text: Grover and Annabeth GET OUT of the truck, TAKE OFF their
text: blindfolds. Percy joins them and they see the HAIR-SNAKES
text: DRAGGING Medusa's HEAD away, across the ground.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: That's something you don't see every day.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: We should take it with us.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: The head?! You're kidding.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
text: Her eyes still work, dead or alive.
dialog: Never know when something like that
dialog: might come in handy.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: (nods, to Grover)
dialog: Gimmee' your jacket.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Your jacket. We need something to
dialog: wrap it in. At least until we can
dialog: get an ice bucket.
text: Grover reluctantly gives Percy his jacket. Percy grabs the
text: head, WRAPS IT UP. Percy TOSSES the head back to Grover, who
text: FUMBLES IT like a hot potato and TOSSES it to Annabeth.
dialog: 54.
text: She TOSSES IT into the back of the truck where it lands with
text: a SQUISHY THUD. Percy holds up the PEARL for all to see.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: One down, two to go.
scene_heading: INT. AUNTIE EM'S - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Percy opens the cash register, takes the cash and GOLD
speaker_heading: DRACHMAS .
scene_heading: EXT. DESERTED HIGHWAY - DAY
text: Medusa's TRUCK peels out onto the highway.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK - FRONT SEAT - DAY
text: Grover DRIVES. Percy and Annabeth are in front with him.
text: Percy STUDIES the MAP. Annabeth holds the green pearl up to
dialog: the light.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: You think Luke could've warned us
dialog: that Medusa was guarding this...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Maybe he didn't know.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: (glances to Percy)
dialog: Where's the next location?
text: On the map, the second address APPEARS...
scene_heading: CENTENNIAL PARK. NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Nashville.
text: Grover NODS, FLOORS the gas. The Shocking Pink's "VENUS"
text: BLASTS from the radio. DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK - LATER - NIGHT
text: Annabeth and Percy are fast asleep (her head is on his
text: shoulder). Grover's head is bobbing as he fights off sleep.
text: The pick-up GLIDES into the on-coming lane of traffic.
text: HEADLIGHTS shine on them and a car HOOOOOONKS!
text: Grover jerks awake, sees the oncoming car, SCREAMS, and
text: SWERVES BACK into the right lane. Percy and Annabeth JOLT
text: AWAKE as the pick-up FISHTAILS in the shoulder, then gets
text: back on the road. Grover is STARTLED, FREAKED.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: We should stop for the night.
dialog: 55.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL 6 - NIGHT
text: Somewhere on the I-70 WEST heading toward Missouri. The
text: Motel is located next to an INTERSTATE EXIT. The VACANCY
text: LIGHT IS ON. The Pick-Up truck PULLS into the parking lot.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL 6 OFFICE - LOBBY - NIGHT
text: A cramped, dusty reception area. The MANAGER, a scrawny 74
text: year old, sits behind the desk. Grover, wearing his handicap
text: disguise, enters with Percy and Annabeth.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: We need a room.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: You got an I.D.?
text: The manager stares them down SUSPICIOUSLY. Percy takes out a
text: wad of cash, peels off five twenties. The Manager grabs a
text: bill, holds it up, looks at it, then looks at Percy.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
text: The spittin' image.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL 6 ROOM - NIGHT
text: Percy opens the door. They enter the small, MUSTY old room.
text: There is one QUEEN bed. Grover's pockets are packed with
text: countless vending machine SNACKS.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
text: Only one bed.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: I'll sleep in the chair.
text: Grover dumps out the pile of snacks onto the bed. He PLOPS
text: down in the chair, clicks on the TV and starts eating a
text: Snickers' Bar, wrapper and all. Grover goes to the ADULT
text: MOVIE PAY CHANNELS and makes a selection. Annabeth GRABS the
text: remote and TURNS OFF the TV. Grover GLARES at her.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: What?! I can't watch a movie?!
text: Percy unwraps a Snickers, sits on the bed, looks to Annabeth.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Pretty big bed. Maybe we could both--
text: She throws a PILLOW at him.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Floor or bathtub. Your call.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: (sighs, stands)
dialog: I'll get some ice.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL 6 - BEDROOM BATHROOM - LATER - NIGHT
text: Percy fills the sink with ICE and places Medusa's head in it.
text: He has DUCT-TAPED HER EYES SHUT, so there is no danger of
text: stoning themselves. Percy and Annabeth (she's wearing cotton
text: boxers and a T-shirt, ready for bed) both grimace at the
text: head, its skin BLUISH, surrounded with FLOPPY DEAD SNAKES.
speaker_heading: GROVER (0.S.)
dialog: Percy! Get in here!
scene_heading: INT. MAIN BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Percy and Annabeth hurriedly enter. Grover, covered in
text: crumbs, surrounded by half eaten junk food, finishes chugging
text: a COKE, then starts CHEWING ON THE CAN. He looks at Percy.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: You're on TV.
text: ON THE TV SCREEN: a NEWS ANCHOR sits at a desk, a school
text: yearbook photo of PERCY is on the screen behind her.
speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV)
dialog: ---and still no word on the disappearance
dialog: of seventeen-year old Percy Jackson and
dialog: his mother Sally. Gabe Ugliano, Sally's
dialog: husband, maintains that the 17 year old
text: Percy is behind the disappearance.
text: Cut to: GABE, standing in front of his garage, being
text: interviewed by a REPORTER.
speaker_heading: GABE (ON TV)
dialog: Kid's been in trouble his whole life.
dialog: A real loser.
text: Percy watches the screen. Stoic. Annabeth looks at him
text: sympathetically.
speaker_heading: GABE (ON TV)
dialog: I mean... What kind of deranged person
dialog: kidnaps his own mother?
speaker_heading: REPORTER (ON TV)
text: Mr. Ugliano is offering a cash reward
dialog: for any information on the whereabouts
dialog: of his wife, son--
speaker_heading: GABE (ON TV)
dialog: Step-son.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: REPORTER (ON TV)
dialog: Stepson.
speaker_heading: GABE (ON TV)
dialog: Kid's no blood relation to me.
text: Percy looks away. Grover tries to lighten the situation.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Cool. You're a fugitive.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: This is going to complicate things.
text: Percy doesn't respond. He stands, exits, SHUTTING the door
text: behind him. Annabeth and Grover exchange a CONCERNED look.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL 6 - POOL - NIGHT
text: Percy SWIMS the length of the pool underwater, purging his
text: emotions. When he surfaces , Annabeth is standing there.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Nice work today, saving us from
dialog: Medusa... Thanks.
dialog: (extends her hand)
dialog: Friends?
text: Percy reaches up... and pulls Annabeth into the pool.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Mess with the son of Poseidon...
dialog: you're gonna get wet.
text: Annabeth splashes frantically, like she's drowning.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Can't... swim...
text: Percy panics, reaches for her...and she leaps up and shoves
text: his head under the water. When he surfaces, she's LAUGHING.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Mess with the daughter of Athena...
dialog: you're gonna' get outsmarted every time.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Then I'm glad you're on my side.
text: They exchange a warm smile.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: So... Why do our parents hate each other?
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: They both wanted to be Patron God of
dialog: Athens. The people chose Athena.
text: Poseidon was insulted. He cursed the
dialog: city so they would never have enough
dialog: water. Our parents have hated each
dialog: other ever since.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: My old man sounds like a bigger jerk
dialog: than my Stepfather.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: I doubt that. Besides, that's the
dialog: historical version... I think there
dialog: was another reason your Father got so
dialog: angry at my Mom...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Why's that?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: He had a huge crush on her. And
text: she blew him off.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: How do you know it wasn't the other
dialog: way around?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: You haven't met my Mom.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: What's she like?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Intense. Always busy. The rare time we
dialog: spend together, she criticizes everything
dialog: I do, points out all my weaknesses... She
dialog: says it's to make me stronger and wiser.
dialog: But it only pisses me off.
dialog: (rolls her eyes, smiles)
dialog: She'd be furious if she knew I was
dialog: helping you.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: (playfully, a touch serious)
dialog: So that's why you came... rebelling
dialog: against Mommy... You want her
dialog: to notice you, see how tough you are...
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Maybe. A little. But I have other
dialog: reasons too.
text: They look deep into each other's eyes, intense attraction...
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Like what?
text: They slowly lean into each other, lips getting closer...
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Like...
text: Their lips are almost touching. Their kiss is INTERRUPTED
text: by... A FLASHLIGHT BEAM, shining on them.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: What's goin' on here?
speaker_heading: PERCY /ANNABETH
dialog: We're... just talking.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: No funny business in the pool. Get Out.
text: Percy and Annabeth climb out, their moment gone. The manager
text: walks away. The two share an awkward beat of silence.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I'm... I'm gonna' chill out here for
dialog: a while. You can stay if you--
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Actually, I'm pretty tired. I think
dialog: I'll call it a night. Goodnight, Percy.
text: She gives him a peck on the cheek, walks away to the room.
text: Percy sighs. FRUSTRATED.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL 6 POOL - THE FOLLOWING MORNING - DAWN
text: Percy is ASLEEP. At the BOTTOM OF THE POOL. He opens his
text: eyes, SWIMS to the surface and gets out.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL 6 OFFICE - DAWN
text: The Manager pours himself a CUP OF COFFEE, accidentally
text: spills some on the desk. He grabs a USA TODAY newspaper to
text: sop up the mess. Percy's PHOTO is on the front page. The
text: headline: "TEEN BOY STILL MISSING; WANTED FOR QUESTIONING."
text: He RECOGNIZES Percy, picks up the paper, examines it.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
text: The spittin' image.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Annabeth is in bed, waking up. Grover walks out of the

dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Alright. Who put Medusa's head in the
dialog: sink?
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: The Manger is peaking in through a gap between the curtains.
text: He sees Grover HOLDING up the SEVERED MEDUSA HEAD. The
text: Manager gags, holds back vomit. Terrified, he backs away
text: from the window... and BUMPS right into... Percy.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Looking for something?
text: The Manager, petrified, tries to speak.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: You... you... killed her... You
dialog: killed your own mother.
text: Percy, confused, sees the USA TODAY clutched in the Manager's
text: hand. Percy sees his photo on the front page, looks to the
text: window, sees Grover, inside the room, holding Medusa's head.
text: The Manager pulls out a PISTOL, aims at Percy.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Murderer!
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: No, I'm not... It's not what you think...
text: The Manager BACKS AWAY, still holding the gun on Percy.
text: Percy steps forward, trying to explain.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: You got it all wrong...
text: The Manager CLICKS the pistol. READY TO SHOOT. Percy closes
text: his eyes, CONCENTRATES. The pool's water RIPPLES. A HUGE
text: WAVE erupts over the side of the pool. The Manager LOOKS UP,
text: sees the wave RISE over the pool. It ENGULFS the Manager and
text: SWEEPS him down the street. Percy RACES BACK to the room.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Guys! We're checking out!
scene_heading: EXT. THE HEARTLAND OF AMERICA - DAY
text: The Pick-up CRUISES on a two-lane blacktop highway. The
text: weather is getting more OMINOUS. Dark CLOUDS. Heavy WINDS.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK - DAY
text: Everyone is quiet, reflective. Annabeth is ASLEEP between
text: Grover and Percy, her head on Percy's shoulder. He's looking
text: out the window, watching the landscape pass before his eyes.
dialog: 61.
text: Percy looks to Annabeth, resting peacefully on his shoulder.
text: A small SMILE appears on Percy's face.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY SKYLINE - THE FOLLOWING MORNING
text: The pick-up passes a sign that reads: WELCOME TO NASHVILLE.
text: ATHENS OF THE SOUTH!
scene_heading: EXT. NASHVILLE - CENTENNIAL PARK - DAY
text: The pick-up truck pulls up. Percy. Grover and Annabeth step
text: out. Percy wears sunglasses and a baseball cap, pulled down
text: to conceal his identity. CAMERA PULLS BACK. We are in the
text: middle of a LARGE PARK, crowded with people. Percy. Grover
text: and Annabeth walk through the park, passing families on
text: PICNICS, JOGGERS, STREET PERFORMERS, to stand before...
scene_heading: THE PARTHENON.
text: An exact DUPLICATE of the ancient Greek architecture,
text: directly in the middle of a modern Nashville park. The
text: juxtaposition of past and present is STRIKING. Percy, Grover
text: and Annabeth examine the map, look up at the Parthenon.
speaker_heading: GROVER
text: The second pearl. It's in there.
dialog: Somewhere.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Wish Luke's map had been a little more
dialog: specific than "Parthenon".
scene_heading: INT. NASHVILLE PARTHENON - DAY
text: Filled with TOURISTS. Percy, Grover and Annabeth ENTER. The
text: space is surrounded by imposing columns, housing a 41 FOOT
text: STATUE of the Goddess ATHENA. It's as if they've stepped
text: back in time 4000 years. Annabeth, slightly moved, looks at
text: the statue. Percy notices the name ATHENA on the base of the
text: statue, turns to Annabeth...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Your Mom?
text: Annabeth nods.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Does she really look like that?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
text: Slight resemblance.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Nice rack.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Excuse me?!
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Nothing. Hormones. Sorry.
text: Percy's eyes WIDEN. He sees something OFFSCREEN.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Up there.
text: Percy points to the TOP of the statue. Grover and Annabeth
text: look up. The SECOND GREEN PEARL is embedded in the middle of
text: Athena's crown, surrounded by rare, colorful JEWELS.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Too easy.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
text: Not really. It's 40 feet in the air.
text: The place is filled with tourists and
dialog: security guards. Are we supposed to
dialog: just jump up and grab it?
text: Long pause. Percy smiles. AN IDEA.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Maybe.
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP: A SHOE BOX.
text: Percy's hands come into frame and open the box lid. Inside,
text: are the WINGED SHOES, given to Percy from Luke. CAMERA PULLS
text: BACK. The three of them sit at a PICNIC TABLE in the park.
text: Percy PICKS UP the winged shoes, examines them.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Luke gave me these for a reason.
dialog: Tonight, after closing hours...
dialog: I'll sneak in.
scene_heading: EXT. PARTHENON - LATER - NIGHT
text: CLOSED for the evening. The surrounding park is DESERTED,
text: save for ONE SECURITY GUARD, who sits in a small booth,
text: several feet from the Parthenon entrance. The guard is an
text: acne faced, gawky 23 YEAR OLD REDNECK.
text: HIDING in a tall section of bushes, Percy, Annabeth and
text: Grover keep watch on the Parthenon. Percy takes off his
text: SNEAKERS, replaces them with the WINGED SHOES. He stands,
text: SHUFFLES, like a RUNNER preparing for a marathon. He looks
text: at Grover and Annabeth.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Any idea how these things work?
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: You break into a run, build up speed...
text: Like a jet on a runway. But it takes
dialog: a bit of--
text: Percy RUNS FORWARD, through the parking lot. He's MOVING
text: FAST. Suddenly, he begins to LIFT OFF... Like a JET... Percy
text: is PROPELLED TEN, FIFTEEN FEET in the air... Then...
text: Percy FLIPS in mid-air. HEAD OVER HEELS. He FALLS STRAIGHT
text: to the ground. He LANDS HARD. On his BACK. SMACK!
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: --practice.
text: Annabeth and Grover RUN to Percy, who struggles to his feet,
text: slightly SHAKEN. DAZED. The wind KNOCKED out of him.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Okay, okay... I can do this...
scene_heading: EXT. PARTHENON - LATER - NIGHT
text: The GUARD sits in his booth, head buried in a copy of Car and
text: Driver magazine. High ABOVE, out of the guard's view, the
text: SILHOUETTE of Percy FLIES across the moonlit sky.
text: Percy SWERVES, BOUNCES... flying slightly ERRATICALLY. He's
text: starting to GAIN CONTROL, maintain his BALANCE...staying IN
text: THE AIR. Percy MOVES FAST.
text: Annabeth and Grover WATCH from the safety and cover of the
speaker_heading: BUSHES.
text: Percy FLIES toward the Parthenon, SOARS through the columns.
scene_heading: INT. PARTHENON - NIGHT
text: Percy FLIES inside, moving QUICKLY. He SOARS toward the
text: STATUE OF ATHENA. Percy's flying is getting a bit more
scene_heading: CONFIDENT, SMOOTH...
text: ANNABETH and GROVER watch from the bushes. NERVOUS. TENSE.
text: Percy FLIES directly toward Athena. He is MOVING FAST. He
text: LOOKS DOWN at the shoes. A WORRIED LOOK covers his face.
text: Grover, concerned, TURNS to Annabeth.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: I forgot to teach him to slow down--
text: Percy CAN'T SLOW DOWN... INCHES from the ATHENA statue.
text: He CRASHES into the statue.
dialog: 64.
text: The statue TILTS... BEGINS TO FALL...
text: Percy FLIES BACK around, managing to STOP the statue from
text: HITTING the floor. The statue TEETERS at a 45 degree angle.
text: Using all of his strength, Percy PUSHES the statue UPRIGHT...
text: INTO PLACE. There is a small GRINDING SOUND as the statue
text: FITS BACK onto its base.
text: The guard LOOKS UP for a moment. Did he HEAR something?
text: The guard SHRUGS to himself, GOES BACK to reading his
dialog: magazine.
text: Percy, SWEATING, NERVOUS... PERCHES on the statue's shoulder.
text: Percy is TINY, compared to the large face of Athena, Mount
text: Rushmore-like in its majestic grandeur.
text: Percy LOOKS UP, sees the green pearl, the centerpiece of
text: Athena's crown. Percy REACHES UP... he can only TOUCH the
text: bottom of the statue's ear lobe. Percy begins to CLIMB UP
text: onto the statue's earrings, TOWARD the top of her head.
text: Annabeth and Grover watch in breathless ANTICIPATION.
text: Percy CLIMBS UPWARD. The statue's surface is SMOOTH...
text: SLIPPERY... Percy's foot SLIPS...
text: He FALLS.
text: Percy SAVES himself, GRABBING onto Athena's CROWN.
text: Annabeth and Grover CATCH THEIR BREATH.
text: Percy gets his footing, begins to CLIMB to the top of
text: Athena's crown. From here, Percy is able to REACH OUT and
dialog: TOUCH the green pearl.
text: With some difficulty, Percy manages to REMOVE the pearl from
text: the crown. He HOLDS it up, victoriously, for Annabeth and
dialog: Grover to see.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: He did it.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Not quite.
text: Grover points to the GUARD'S BOOTH. It's EMPTY.
text: Inside the Parthenon, Percy puts the green pearl into his
text: pocket. He is about to FLY AWAY... Suddenly INTERRUPTED...
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Get off the statue.
dialog: 65.
text: Percy looks down. The SECURITY GUARD stands below the
text: statue. He holds a GUN, POINTED at Percy.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: (extends gun)
dialog: Now.
text: Percy CLIMBS DOWN the face of the statue. He LANDS on the
text: floor, IN FRONT of the security guard. Percy RAISES his
text: hands. The Security Guard GRINS.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: You look familiar.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: You're that kid. On the news. The
dialog: one who killed his Mother.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: You're thinking of somebody else...
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Naw... It's you. I remember the eyes.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH (0.S.)
dialog: Drop your gun.
text: The Security Guard TURNS. Grover and Annabeth stand a few
text: feet away. Annabeth is holding a BOW and ARROW, POINTED at
text: the Security Guard, who chuckles.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: You think an arrow's gonna' stop me?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: I'm an Olympian.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: I know who you are, daughter of Athena.
text: Annabeth, Grover and Percy exchange a PUZZLED GLANCE. The
text: Security Guard TURNS to Percy.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: I've been expecting you, Percy Jackson.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: You know me?
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Just give me the lightning bolt.
dialog: And I'll let you go.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I don't have it.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: I really hoped to avoid this...
text: The Security Guard takes a DEEP BREATH... Then EXHALES... His
text: outer SKIN EXPLODES! SHOWERING the room with COUNTLESS
speaker_heading: FRAGMENTS.
text: Percy, Annabeth and Grover HIDE their eyes. PIECES of the
text: Security Guard FLY BY THEM.
text: All that REMAINS of the security guard, is a thick, swirling,
text: PUFF OF SMOKE, on the floor.
text: Percy, Annabeth and Grover slowly WALK to the smoke. They
scene_heading: LOOK DOWN.
text: The smoke BEGINS TO CLEAR... REVEALING...
scene_heading: A REPTILIAN EYE.
text: More SMOKE CLEARS. TWO EYES appear... Followed by THREE,
scene_heading: FOUR... SIX, SEVEN...
text: Percy, Annabeth and Grover STEP BACK.
text: FOURTEEN EYES are revealed... On SEVEN different heads. The
scene_heading: heads are REPTILIAN. VICIOUS. SNARLING.
text: The heads RISE UP from the smoke, GROWING high above the
text: kids' heads. The heads FULLY FORM into the GIANT, DRAGON-
text: LIKE BODY of the seven headed...
speaker_heading: GROVER
speaker_heading: HYDRA!
text: Annabeth SHOOTS ARROWS at the Hydra. The stinging arrows
text: only make the beast ANGRIER. Its monstrous heads SWOOP DOWN,
text: jaws SNAPPING at Annabeth and Grover. They dive behind the
text: STONE COLUMNS for cover, setting off the ALARM.
text: Percy REACHES into his backpack, pulls out Luke's SHIELD.
text: Percy LEAPS ONTO one of the Hydra-heads. It tries to SHAKE
text: HIM OFF. The other Hydra-heads LURCH toward Percy, SNAPPING
text: their fanged jaws. Percy TWISTS to avoid them. He REACHES
text: into his pocket... removes his PEN and activates his SWORD.
dialog: 67.
text: Another Hydra-head SWOOPS toward Percy. He swings the sword
text: and DECAPITATES the head. It SPEWS thick GREEN BLOOD. The
text: other six heads SCREAM in PAIN.
text: Percy LEAPS onto another head, that THRASHES at him, RIPPING
text: AWAY a piece of Percy's shoulder. Another head SLASHES
text: Percy's thigh.
text: Another head goes for the jugular, moments before Percy
text: manages to DECAPITATE IT.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Percy! Stop! You're only making it
dialog: worse!
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: What are you talking about?!
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: When you cut off one hydra head--
text: The TWO HEADLESS NECKS twist around as if they are staring at
dialog: Percy.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: --Three grow back!
text: THREE MORE HEADS POP OUT of each of the necks! Now the Hydra
text: is a BEAST WITH ELEVEN HEADS!
text: The heads SNAP at Percy, DRAWING MORE BLOOD. Percy LEAPS
text: from one head... to another... to another and...gets HUNG UP
text: by one of the fangs. It has RIPPED through his pant leg.
text: Percy DANGLES helplessly, using his sword to keep the other
text: heads at bay.
text: The Hydra-head FLIPS Percy up into its mouth. Percy is STUCK
text: INSIDE the hydra's mouth. The beast BITES DOWN. Percy
text: EXTENDS his shield. The hydra's FANGS strike down on the
text: shield, LOCKING the creature's mouth OPEN. SAVING Percy.
text: For a MOMENT. But Percy is TRAPPED, his shirt CAUGHT on the
text: hydra's fangs.
text: Annabeth FIRES MORE ARROWS at the heads, annoying and
text: distracting them.
text: Percy CAN'T BREAK FREE. Luke's shield is BENDING... ABOUT TO
speaker_heading: SNAP.
text: The hydra fangs are ONLY INCHES from Percy's midsection.
text: He's about to be BITTEN IN TWO.
text: Annabeth continues to FIRE ARROWS. She CALLS to Grover.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Grover! Do something!
dialog: 68.
text: Grover LOOKS AROUND for some sort of WEAPON...
text: He spots Percy's BACKPACK. An IDEA.
text: Percy USES all of his strength to HOLD OPEN the Hydra mouth.
text: But the creature is TOO STRONG.
text: The hydra's MOUTH STARTS TO CLOSE... Its TEETH INCHES from
text: penetrating Percy's torso...
speaker_heading: GROVER (0.S.)
text: GUYS! DON'T LOOK BACK!
text: Grover stands BEHIND them. He's UNWRAPPED the Medusa head.
text: He EXTENDS it forward. TOWARD the Hydra.
text: Grover EXTENDS the Medusa head and RIPS THE TAPE OFF of
text: Medusa's eyes... FACING the hydra...
text: Hydra's eyes LOCK with Medusa's.
text: The Hydra TURNS TO STONE.
text: Annabeth's final arrows BOUNCE OFF the Hydra's stone body.
text: Percy KNOCKS OUT some of the hydra's stone teeth, to FREE
text: HIMSELF from the beast's mouth. Percy grabs Luke's BENT
text: SHIELD and LEAPS onto the stone Hydra neck. Percy SLIDES
text: DOWN the neck, to the ground.
text: Grover PUTS the tape back OVER Medusa's eyes, PLACES her head
text: back into the backpack, looks at Annabeth.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: You were right. She did come in handy.
text: They turn, look back at the now STONE HYDRA. It FITS in
text: quite nicely with the Parthenon's architecture. Percy
text: removes the GREEN PEARL from his pocket.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Two down, one to go.
text: Annabeth notices the burglar alarm BLARING from inside.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Let's get back to the truck...
text: They hurriedly EXIT.
scene_heading: EXT. PARTHENON - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Percy, Annabeth and Grover RUN to their truck. They are
text: INTERRUPTED by a sound.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: POLICE CAPTAIN (0.S.)
dialog: Raise your hands. Above your heads.
text: They turn. THREE POLICE CARS SURROUND them. COPS AIM their
text: pistols at the kids.
text: Percy, Annabeth and Grover RAISE their hands. Suddenly,
text: there is a FAINT, DISTANT SOUND of a POWERFUL ENGINE. It
text: grows LOUDER... LOUDER...
text: A BLACK HUMVEE barrels through the crowd, SMASHES through
text: police cars, and SKIDS to a STOP in front of the kids. The
text: license plate reads: "WARMNGR".
text: The COPS FIRE their guns. The DRIVER rolls down his window.
text: (think BRUCE WILLIS). He is dressed in LEATHER, adorned with
text: MILITARY MEDALS from various eras. His face is angular,
text: hard, with a strong jaw. His head is SHAVED. He wears a
text: soul patch. This is ARES, GOD OF WAR. He lowers his aviator
text: sunglasses, grins at Percy.
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: Your ride's here.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Ares?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: The God of War?!?
text: As bullets FLY around them, Grover SHOUTS.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: I think we should get in.
scene_heading: INT. HUMVEE - NIGHT
text: The kids JUMP in. Ares throws it into gear, lets out a WAR
text: WHOOP and drives straight at the POLICE LINE. They continue
text: to FIRE on the Humvee. Bullets BOUNCE OFF the windows.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - NIGHT
text: Ares PLOWS right through their barricade, and OUT OF THE
text: PARK. POLICE CARS CHASE after the Humvee.
scene_heading: INT. HUMVEE - NIGHT
text: Ares CACKLES wildly, loves the chase.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: Saving your ass.
dialog: 70.
scene_heading: EXT. NASHVILLE CITY STREETS - NIGHT
text: POLICE CARS are in pursuit of the Humvee. Ares takes corners
text: so fast that the Humvee TIPS ON TWO WHEELS.
scene_heading: INT. HUMVEE - NIGHT
text: Percy, Grover, and Annabeth are FREAKED. SCARED.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: We're all gonna' die!
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: Casualties of war.
scene_heading: EXT. NASHVILLE STREETS - NIGHT
text: Police cars are now coming at the Humvee from all sides.
scene_heading: INT. HUMVEE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: Time to go stealth.
text: Ares FLICKS a DASHBOARD SWITCH.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT
text: The Humvee DISAPPEARS in the midst of the chase. It is now a
text: SHIMMERING SHAPE, camouflaged from the human eye. The Humvee
text: DRIVES OFF into the night. FREE.
scene_heading: EXT. CHUCK’S DINER - NIGHT
text: The Humvee pulls into Chuck's, a fifties style diner.
speaker_heading: ARES (0.C.)
dialog: Anybody hungry? We got a long
dialog: drive ahead of us.
text: Ares and the kids STEP OUT of the Humvee.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: They're gonna' be looking for this
dialog: car. It's kinda'... unique...
text: Ares CLICKS the auto-lock on his key-chain. The Humvee
text: TRANSFORMS, into a 1970's blue VW HIPPIE VAN.
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: Not any more.
scene_heading: INT. CHUCK'S DINER - DAY
text: A modest, family diner. The Turtles "Happy Together" plays
text: on the JUKEBOX. Ares enters.
dialog: 71.
text: As he passes the jukebox, we hear the 45 record SCRATCH. The
text: song CHANGES to Van Halen's "Runnin' With The Devil".
text: Ares STRUTS down the restaurant aisle. Percy, Annabeth, and
text: Grover are behind him. Ares walks by each booth, his mere
text: presence EVOKES CALAMITY and TENSION. As Ares passes, babies
text: CRY, people start to ARGUE...
text: Ares sits in a BOOTH, at the back of the place. The kids
text: JOIN HIM. With sudden TENSION in the air, the kids are
text: fidgety, uncomfortable. The WAITRESS delivers the menus.
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: Thank you, ma'am. No menus. Four
dialog: cheeseburgers. Rare.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: I'm a vegetar--
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: Four cheeseburgers. Rare!
text: The waitress nods, walks away.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Why are you really here, Ares?
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: Chiron sent me.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: To bring you to Olympus.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: We'll get there. We got time.
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: Not much. You checked out the weather
dialog: recently?...
text: The kids LOOK OUT the window. The sky above is filled with
scene_heading: swiftly MOVING BLACK CLOUDS. OMINOUS. THREATENING.
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: Every day it gets worse. That means
text: Zeus and Poseidon are gearin' up for
text: battle. Summer solstice is only ten
dialog: days from now. And if the bolt isn’t
dialog: returned to Zeus by then... It’s war.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I’m getting my Mom first.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: Kinda' selfish, kid... Putting your
dialog: personal feelings over the fate of
dialog: civilization...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Once Zeus finds out I'm not the
dialog: Lightning Thief, word will spread
dialog: fast. Then Hades will kill my Mother.
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: True...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: So I need to save her first, then
dialog: convince Zeus of my innocence.
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: Unfortunately, you don’t have much choice
dialog: in the matter. You’re my prisoner now.
text: The waitress ARRIVES with the burgers. Ares lifts the burger
text: bun, examines the beef. He SNAPS at the waitress.
speaker_heading: ARES (CONT'D)
dialog: I said RARE!
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: I'm sorry. I told them--
text: He SHOVES his plate into the waitress’ stomach, nearly
text: KNOCKING the wind out of her. SCARED, she nods.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: I'll... get... another... one.
text: The other customers are STARING. Ares turns, GLARES at them.
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: What are you looking at! Get back to
dialog: stuffin' your faces before I bash ‘em in!
text: The patrons do as they're told. Ares LOOKS BACK to Percy,
text: GRINS, as if nothing happened, speaks calmly.
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: So if you aren't the Lightning Thief...
dialog: Who is?...
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Hades?
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: No way.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: If Hades possesses the bolt and the son
dialog: of Poseidon, he has all the power and
text: leverage he needs to take over Olympus.
dialog: I'll bet he's using Percy’s Mom to lure
text: him into a trap.
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: Hades isn’t that bright. No... whoever
dialog: took the bolt would be much more
dialog: clever... someone who would want to
dialog: start a war of the Gods...
text: The kids look at Ares, accusingly.
speaker_heading: ARES (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh... Because I'm the God of War, I took
dialog: it? WRONG! My business is all down
dialog: here, on earth. And if you haven't
dialog: noticed... it's booming right now.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Then who else would steal it?
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: Someone real clever... A master
dialog: strategist...
dialog: (turns to Annabeth)
dialog: Like Athena.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: My Mom?
text: Grover and Percy turn to Annabeth.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH (CONT’D)
dialog: You think my mom is the thief!?
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: Mother, daughter, all the same. Maybe
dialog: the real question is... why are you here?
dialog: Grover is Percy's protector. But why did
dialog: you come along? To keep an eye on these
dialog: two? To get rid of all the loose
dialog: ends?...
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: (furious, passionate)
dialog: My mom doesn't start wars.
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: First time for everything.
text: The burly, badass, muscular owner, CHUCK, covered with
text: tattoos, wearing a stained apron, drops the new burger plate
text: in front of Ares. Chuck LEANS INTO into Ares' face.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Next time you yell at my waitress and
dialog: berate my customers, you're gonna' be
dialog: wearin' your food. Got that, Rambo?
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: (calm)
dialog: You're right. I'm sorry. That was
dialog: uncalled for
text: Then... WHACK! WHACK! In two quick PUNCHES, Ares SENDS
text: Chuck falling to the floor, bleeding, writhing in PAIN.
text: Ares unfolds some BILLS and drops them on the table. He
text: grabs his burger, heads for the door, SHOVING the kids ahead.
scene_heading: EXT. CHUCK's DINER - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
text: Ares PUSHES the kids into the back of the van. Percy stops,
text: desperate, LOOKS at Ares.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Ares, please... Let me go... I gotta' try
dialog: and save my Mom... It's my last chance...
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: Sorry, kid. Can't do it.
text: He SHOVES Percy into the car. Ares JUMPS into the driver's
text: seat, starts the van and SPEEDS OUT of the parking lot.
text: Percy stares out the window, DEPRESSED.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - NIGHT
text: Ares DRIVES. Percy is SLUMPED forward, near tears. All of
text: his hope... GONE. Annabeth exchanges a CONCERNED LOOK with
text: Grover. She pauses, gets an idea... LEANS FORWARD, to Ares.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Ares...
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Did you ever stop and think about a
dialog: war between the Gods?... It would be
dialog: spectacular... The ultimate battle...
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: (pondering)
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Haven't you been waiting years for
dialog: something like this?
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: (thinking, nods)
dialog: Centuries.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Exactly. And look at us? Have you
dialog: ever seen three such pathetic losers?
text: Ares glances to the rearview mirror.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Do we really look like we can defeat
dialog: Hades? I’m betting that we get killed
dialog: on our little suicide mission. I'm
dialog: betting we never even make it to Olympus,
dialog: that Zeus never gets his bolt. And you
dialog: know what that means...
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: (softly, eyes light)
dialog: War.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: But if you take us to Olympus... Well,
dialog: there won't be a war. Only...
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: (sadly, softly)
dialog: Peace.
text: Ares' eyes GLAZE OVER over.
scene_heading: EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - LATER - NIGHT
text: Ares' van pulls up to the side of the tracks, located on a
text: deserted COUNTRY ROAD. The back door SLIDES OPEN. Percy,
text: Annabeth and Grover GET OUT. Ares rolls down his window.
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: I'll tell Chiron I couldn't find you.
text: Percy nods, exchanges a hopeful look with Annabeth.
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: I'd wish you good luck... But your
dialog: survival ain't exactly in my best
dialog: interest...
text: Ares CLOSES the window, DRIVES OFF. The van VANISHES in a
text: ball of LIGHT and a SONIC BOOM. Grover WATCHES.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Sweet guy.
text: Percy EMBRACES Annabeth.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Just like your Mom. A master strategist.
dialog: (sincere, passionate)
dialog: Thank you so much.
text: They lean forward, looks as if they're about to kiss...
text: Grover CLEARS HIS THROAT.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Okay. Which way to the next pearl?
text: Percy OPENS the map. The third location GLOWS:
scene_heading: LAS VEGAS, NEVADA. LOTUS LAND CASINO.
text: In the distance, we hear a TRAIN WHISTLE. Percy takes off
text: along the railroad tracks, motions to Annabeth and Grover.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: We got ten days to save my Mom.
dialog: And the world. C'mon!
scene_heading: EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - LATER - NIGHT
text: Percy, Annabeth and Grover hurry along the tracks. A TRAIN
text: pulling BOX CARS rolls toward them. Percy CHECKS his map
text: with a flashlight.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: This one's headed West.
text: Percy starts RUNNING toward it. Annabeth and Grover FOLLOW.
text: They RUN alongside the train. Percy LEAPS into one of the
text: box cars, reaches out his hand and PULLS Annabeth in.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: C'mon, Grover!
text: Grover RUNS ALONG the side of the train, plants his crutches
text: like ski poles and LEAPS with a SINGLE BOUND. He FLIES RIGHT
text: INTO the box car.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
text: Grover LANDS. He gets to his feet. Percy and Annabeth are
text: staring at something.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: We got company.
text: They are inside of a car filled with FARM ANIMALS. CHICKENS,
text: COWS, GOATS...
dialog: 77.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN CAR - LATER - NIGHT
text: A small FIRE burns in the middle of the box car. Grover,
text: Percy and Annabeth are SEATED around it. The ANIMALS
text: surround them.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: (knows what he's thinking)
dialog: Don't look at me like that.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Like that.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: You're being paranoid.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: I know what you're thinking.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: No. Maybe. Okay. Crossed my mind.
dialog: For a second.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: What are you two talking about?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: (angry) a
dialog: Grover thinks my Mom is the Lightning
dialog: Thief.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: No. Not totally. I mean, I wouldn't be
text: surprised. She does hate Percy's Dad.
dialog: And with a little help from you, she
dialog: could cause Poseidon great pain... by
text: hurting his son.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: (furious)
dialog: I wouldn't do anything to hurt Percy.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: You almost killed him back at the Camp.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: (getting upset)
dialog: That was before...
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Before what?
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Before I--
text: Annabeth can't answer, too filled with emotion. Her eyes
text: fill with tears. She glances at Percy, hurries to the side
text: of the train car, slides open the doors and CLIMBS OUTSIDE,
text: ONTO THE EXTERIOR LADDER.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Annabeth... Wait...
text: Annabeth CLIMBS onto the roof of the train car. Percy,
text: ANNOYED, turns to Grover.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Smooth.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Hey, I'm your protector. I'm not
dialog: supposed to trust anybody who gets
dialog: close to you. Even her.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: No wonder you have so much trouble
dialog: with the opposite sex.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: (insulted, hurt)
text: Uncalled for. Totally uncalled for.
text: Percy turns, dashes outside and CLIMBS UP onto the boxcar
text: roof. Grover STEAMS.
scene_heading: EXT. BOXCAR ROOF - NIGHT
text: A WARM, ROMANTIC NIGHT. Annabeth sits on the moving train
text: roof, looking up at the CLEAR NIGHT SKY, FILLED WITH BRIGHT
text: STARS. She is CRYING. Percy walks up, sits beside her.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Hey.
text: A pause. She turns to him,. He WIPES a tear from her cheek.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Grover's right. I really didn't like
dialog: you at first. I was a little jealous...
dialog: competitive... But that's different
dialog: now...
text: Percy moves CLOSER to Annabeth, puts his arms around her.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: The last few days have been the most
dialog: exciting time of my life... and it's...
dialog: (tenderly)
dialog: All because of you.
text: Their eyes LOCK. They share their FIRST KISS.
scene_heading: INT. BOXCAR - LATER - NIGHT
text: Grover, ALONE with the animals, tries to sleep on a pile of
text: straw, covering himself with burlap sack. Grover stares
text: ahead, his face a map of FRUSTRATION and LONELINESS. A GOAT
text: saunters up, LICKS HIS FACE. Grover MUMBLES to himself.
speaker_heading: GROVER
text: Percy's up there, probably hooking up
dialog: with a beautiful girl. And I'm down
dialog: here...
dialog: (looks at the goat)
dialog: ...with you.
text: The goat continues to lick Grover's face. Grover smiles,
text: WARMING UP to the goat's affection. Grover GIGGLES.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Stop it.
text: He looks up at the goat, ponders...
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Ya' know... In this light, at just the
dialog: right angle... you're sorta' cute...
text: The goat KICKS Grover in the head and WALKS AWAY. Grover
text: sits up. Angry. Insulted.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: What?! It's perfectly natural for me
dialog: to have feelings for you. Well...
dialog: (points to lower half)
dialog: ..-half of me.
text: The goat bleats. Grover PULLS the burlap sack over his head.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Good night!
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - TRAIN STATION - THE NEXT MORNING - DAY
text: The train PULLS into an old, ancient train station, alone in
text: the middle of the desert. There's nothing around for miles
text: and miles, only DRY BARREN LAND and ROCKY PLATEAUS. The
text: train COMES TO A STOP. On top of the boxcar, Annabeth lies
text: in Percy's arms. They are ASLEEP.
dialog: 80.
text: Grover's head POPS up over the side of the boxcar top.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Hey. Romeo and Juliet.
text: Percy and Annabeth wake up.
speaker_heading: GROVER
text: End of the line.
text: Percy and Annabeth CLIMB DOWN to the train platform. Grover
text: gives them their backpacks.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: How far to Las Vegas?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: (checks map)
dialog: A long way.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: We can hitchhike.
text: Percy looks to the edge of the platform. A SHERIFF'S CAR is
text: parked here.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Roads aren't safe.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: What are we supposed to do?
text: Percy slings his backpack over his shoulder and grabs the
text: shield. He takes off across the bleak DESERT TERRAIN.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: You're gonna' walk all the way to Vegas!?
text: Percy IGNORE him, keeps walking. Annabeth grabs her
text: backpack, follows after Percy. Grover sighs, FOLLOWS.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY
text: Percy, Grover, and Annabeth march across the scorching,
text: shimmering desert landscape like young T.E. Lawrences. As
text: the SUN beats down on them, they get SLOWER... DIRTIER...
text: and more PARCHED. They have torn pieces of clothing wrapped
text: around their heads for protection. Annabeth glares up at the
text: HOT SUN, sees BUZZARDS circling.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - LATER - DUSK
text: The sun is SETTING. Covered in dust, grime and sweat, Percy,
text: Annabeth and Grover have stopped to rest in the shade of a
text: ROCKY MESA. Annabeth holds an empty water bottle over her
text: mouth, hoping for one more drop. She tosses it away.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Empty.
scene_heading: They continue walking. EXHAUSTED. DEFEATED. DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - LATER - NIGHT
text: It is BITTERLY COLD. Percy, Annabeth and Grover are hungry,
text: cold, filled with a sense of impending doom. They are
text: HOVERED around a dying fire. Percy's arms are wrapped around
text: Annabeth, who has her arms wrapped around Grover. The 3 of
text: them are SHIVERING.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: We're still a long way from Vegas...
dialog: Without water, food... We're gonna'
dialog: die out here...
text: The kids exchange WORRIED looks. DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING - SUNRISE
text: The kids are ASLEEP. Something APPROACHES. LARGE, MOVING
text: SHADOWS fall over them. We hear SNORTING, the sound of
text: HOOVES...
text: Percy, Annabeth and Grover WAKE. They look up and see...
text: A WILD HORSE.
text: The animal STARES down at them. The kids LEAP up, a little
text: freaked. There are THREE WILD HORSES surrounding them.
text: Percy, Grover and Annabeth stand. The horses are loaded with
text: BASKETS OF FRESH FRUIT, VEGETABLES and canteens of WATER.
text: Grover immediately runs to the basket, begins to STUFF his
text: face with the food.
text: One of the horses makes a motion, LOWERS its head, beckoning
text: Percy. The horse BENDS one leg and KNEELS in front of Percy.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: He wants you to get on.
dialog: (smiles )
dialog: Guess it pays to have a Dad who's
dialog: God of the horses.
text: Percy smiles, grabs his BACKPACK and SHIELD. He CLIMBS onto
text: the horse. Once Percy is on, the horse RISES. The other two
text: horses KNEEL in front of Annabeth and Grover. They CLIMB ON.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT VISTA - LATER - DAY
text: Percy, Annabeth and Grover RIDE the horses, across the rocky
dialog: desert.
dialog: 82.
text: Percy and Annabeth are smiling, laughing, feeling free,
text: ALIVE... leaving a trail of DUST. Grover is behind them,
text: doing everything he can to HOLD ON.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT'S EDGE - SUNSET
text: The horses are standing on a ROCKY PLATEAU. The kids are
text: sitting on top of the horses, looking out over the glittering
text: lights of LAS VEGAS. Percy checks his MAP. The sight of the
text: final green pearl reads: Las Vegas... LOTUS LAND.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Las Vegas. Last stop before hell.
text: As they ride down toward the city, we see DARK OMINOUS STORM
text: CLOUDS churning in the distance, moving WESTWARD.
scene_heading: EXT. LAS VEGAS/LOTUS LAND - LATER - NIGHT
text: Percy, Grover, and Annabeth ride along the Vegas strip, on
text: their horses. Shocked ONLOOKERS stare at these three kids on
text: horseback. Up ahead, is LOTUS LAND, a glittery, glamorous,
text: million-watt CASINO. It's designed as a huge NEON FLOWER,
text: the petals LIGHTING UP and BLINKING.
text: Percy, Annabeth and Grover ARRIVE at the entrance. The
text: horses KNEEL. The kids HOP OFF. Grover is covered in dust,
text: walking bow legged, in tremendous PAIN.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Goat on a horse. Ain't natural.
text: Countless Lotus Land VALETS descend upon them.
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: Welcome to Lotus Land.
text: The Valets take the horses. The kids ENTER.
scene_heading: INT. LOTUS LAND - NIGHT
text: Unlike any casino we've ever seen. A teenagers PARADISE. In
text: addition to the regular slots and casino games, there are
text: hundreds of VIDEO GAMES, everything from classic PAC-MAN to
scene_heading: DANCE-DANCE REVOLUTION.
text: The place is filled with KIDS and TEENAGERS. NO PARENTS or
dialog: ADULTS (save for employees). There's something odd about the
text: kids... They are dressed in clothes and hairstyles from every
text: decade, spanning the FIFTIES through the NINETIES. Percy,
text: Annabeth, and Grover walk through the casino.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Where would you hide a green pearl?
text: An eager, too friendly BELLHOP rushes up to them.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: BELLHOP
dialog: Welcome to Lotus Land. Hope you've
dialog: had a pleasant journey. Here's your
dialog: room key.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: We're not staying. Just passing through.
speaker_heading: BELLHOP
dialog: It's complimentary. Room 4001. Take
text: the elevator to the top.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: No, really--
text: The PERSISTENT Bellhop hands them each a GREEN PLASTIC CARD.
speaker_heading: BELLHOP
dialog: Your complimentary Lotus-Cash cards. Good
dialog: for everything in the hotel and casino.
dialog: Your expense accounts are unlimited and
dialog: you never have to pay us back.
text: The Bellhop scurries away, kids exchange PUZZLED glances.
text: Percy looks at the Green card, ANNOYED.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Think the guy could take a hint--
text: A CLUB WAITRESS approaches, holding a tray of LOTUS FLOWERS.
speaker_heading: CLUB WAITRESS
dialog: Flowers?
text: Percy takes one, SNIFFS it.
speaker_heading: CLUB WAITRESS
dialog: They're edible.
text: Percy and Annabeth each EAT a flower. Very TASTY. Grover
text: takes a handful and SHOVES them in his mouth, CHEWS.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Delicious.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 4001 - LATER - NIGHT
text: Percy, Annabeth, and Grover enter a PALATIAL SUITE. It has
text: three separate bedrooms, a bar stocked with candy, soda, and
text: chips. A huge plasma TV, sunken lounge area filled with
text: pillows and beanbag chairs, a huge INDOOR SWIMMING POOL.
text: The kids are IMPRESSED. They immediately start checking out
text: the pad. Grover hits the bar, opens the refrigerator. It is
text: FILLED with food. The inside of the fridge appears to go on
text: for ETERNITY...
dialog: 84.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 4001 BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Annabeth opens a CLOSET in one of the rooms. It is filled
text: with the latest DESIGNER DRESSES and SHOES. A young girl's
text: DREAM. Annabeth is amazed, takes out a dress, holds it
text: against her body. She looks at shoes... STUNNED...
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: They're all my size.
scene_heading: INT. SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Percy is standing in front of another closet. It is filled
text: with a variety of clothes, all his size: SUITS, TUXEDOS,
text: JEANS, T-SHIRTS, NIKES... Percy smiles. Annabeth runs into
text: Percy's room, followed by Grover.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Let's go out tonight... have some fun.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Wish we could. But we're on a time-
dialog: sensitive mission. Remember?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: We are?... What mission?
text: Percy PAUSES, he has to think about it... He CAN'T RECALL.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Good question. I can't remember.
dialog: Grover, why are we here?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: I don't know...
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: To have fun?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Right. Have fun. That's it. Okay.
dialog: So let's have some fun.
scene_heading: INT. LOTUS LAND - DANCE CLUB - LATER - NIGHT
text: A DISCO BALL spins. COLORED LIGHTS flash. DANCE MUSIC
text: plays. DRY ICE MIST covers the floor. Percy, Annabeth, and
text: Grover enter. They look incredibly STYLISH. Percy wears a
text: sleek, stylish black tuxedo, Annabeth is in a gorgeous
text: ballroom gown, Grover is in tails and a top hat.
text: A 70's Dance classic fills the disco. Percy EXTENDS his hand
text: to Annabeth.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: May I have this dance?
dialog: 85.
text: They step on the dance floor, immediately find their groove.
text: A group of GORGEOUS WOMEN walk up to Grover, drag him onto
text: the dance floor.
text: Percy and Annabeth look into each other's eyes, very much IN
text: LOVE. They KISS.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Let's stay here forever.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Why not?
text: They kiss again. It is INTERRUPTED by the sounds of SHOUTING
text: and APPLAUDING. They look up and see...
text: GROVER, in the middle of the dance floor. He is surrounded
text: by kids, watching his manic, wildly energetic DANCE. The
text: girls love him. During his dance, Grover RIPS OFF pants,
text: exposing his goat lower half. Grover finishes with some show-
text: stopping BREAK DANCE MOVES.
text: Percy and Annabeth laugh, look to each other and share
scene_heading: another DEEP KISS. DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOTUS LAND - MONTAGE - DAY/NIGHT
text: Percy, Annabeth, and Grover are having fun at Lotus Land.
text: Percy and Annabeth are INSEPARABLE. They drive MINI-SPORTS
text: CARS throughout the casino, play POKER and BLACKJACK, order a
text: table full of DESSERTS at a restaurant.
text: Grover struts through the casino with a bevy of scantily clad
text: BEAUTIES, gambling at each of the tables with them. He WINS
text: EVERY GAME that he plays.
text: At one point, Percy and Annabeth pass a SEVENTIES KID playing
text: a vintage PINBALL MACHINE. Percy accidentally BUMPS the kid.
speaker_heading: SEVENTIES KID
dialog: Hey! You just cost me the high score.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Sorry. My bad.
speaker_heading: SEVENTIES KID
dialog: Your what?
text: Percy examines the kid, who is wearing striped bell-bottoms,
text: a pristine STAR WARS T-shirt and a bushy seventies fro.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: How long have you been here?
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: SEVENTIES KID
dialog: Couple weeks. Groovy place.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Groovy?... What year is it?
text: The Seventies kid pauses, has to THINK for a moment.
speaker_heading: SEVENTIES KID
dialog: 1977.
text: Percy is stunned, worried... He rubs his temples, hearing a
text: DEEP VOICE inside his head...
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Percy... Wake up... Focus, focus...
text: Percy walks over to a mullet-haired EIGHTIES KID, wearing
text: parachute pants and a red and black leather jacket. The kid
text: is playing DONKEY KONG.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Excuse me. What year is it!?
speaker_heading: EIGHTIES KID
dialog: Check out my most excellent score.
text: Intense, Percy grabs the Eighties kid by the collar.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: What year?!
speaker_heading: EIGHTIES KID
dialog: Relax, dude... It's 1985, not the end
dialog: of the world.
text: Percy FREEZES, looks around at all of the kids. Every single
text: one of them is stuck at a specific time, IN THE PAST. A
text: VOICE in Percy's head ECHOES...
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Percy... You need to get outside...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Something... isn't... right...
text: Percy shakes his head, like he's COMING OUT OF A TRANCE. He
text: turns, standing beside a supersize ROULETTE WHEEL. He
text: notices something. The ball in the wheel, is...
text: The third GREEN PEARL.
text: Percy stares at the pearl, trying to figure out why it means
text: so much to him. The ancient CROUPIER gives Percy a menacing,
text: suspicious look.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: CROUPIER
dialog: Enjoying your stay?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Fine. Thanks.
speaker_heading: CROUPIER
dialog: Fine? Just... fine?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I mean... excellent. Fantastic.
dialog: We want to stay forever.
text: Percy starts to BACK AWAY, but the Croupier GRABS him. Percy
text: breaks free. The Croupier speaks into his EAR-MIC.
speaker_heading: CROUPIER
text: Percy Jackson's awake.
text: Percy LOOKS at Annabeth...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Go upstairs. I'll meet you there.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: What? But why--
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: Please. Just do it.
text: Annabeth nods, hurries off.
text: Percy turns, sees a GROUP OF LOTUS EATERS heading toward him.
text: Percy RUNS OFF, PUSHES his way through the crowd. He leaps
text: across the gambling tables, makes it to the Roulette wheel
text: and SNATCHES the THIRD GREEN PEARL.
text: He LEAPS OFF the table, runs to the glass elevators. The
text: Lotus Eaters are in HOT PURSUIT. Percy gets in just BEFORE
text: THE DOORS CLOSE.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 4001 - MOMENTS LATER
text: Percy BARGES IN. Grover is surrounded by a pile of food
text: wrappers, several YOUNG HOT WOMEN, playing a video-game.
text: Annabeth is sipping a drink, munching on Lotus flowers.
text: Percy is TENSE, URGENT.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: We have to go! Now!
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Chill. We'll go tomorrow.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Or the next day.
text: Percy GRABS Annabeth and Grover and THROWS them both into the
text: room's SWIMMING POOL. They POP UP out of the water.
scene_heading: SHOCKED. AWAKE. ANGRY.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Hey... Why'd you do that?!
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: You both need to wake up! You're in some
dialog: kind of trance... I was too... Now listen
dialog: to me. Focus. We're trapped. In the
dialog: Land of Lotus Eaters.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Trapped? But we just got here last
dialog: night...
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: (coming out of it)
dialog: Lotus Eaters... Right... a cult that
dialog: lives off of the Lotus flower. When you
dialog: eat a flower, it induces the appearance
dialog: of eternal youth and forgetfulness...
dialog: makes you lose your desire to ever
dialog: leave...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: And we gotta' leave now. Or we'll
dialog: be stuck here forever.
text: They hurriedly pack up their gear. Percy gathers up his
text: stuff, shoving it in his back pack. He grabs his pen and his
text: shield. The kids HURRIEDLY EXIT. Grover blows ONE LAST KISS
text: to the bevy of beauties.
scene_heading: INT. CASINO FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Percy, Grover and Annabeth RACE across the floor. Lotus-
text: Eaters SWARM after them. Percy removes his pen, CLICKS IT.
dialog: It becomes the SWORD!
text: Percy starts HACKING his way through the Lotus-Eaters. A
text: YOUNG MAN in fifties clothes is hit with the sword. He
text: suddenly AGES, turning to a withered OLD MAN before dropping
text: to the floor.
text: Grover sees a NEW LOTUS ELAN CONVERTIBLE on a rotating
text: platform. A sign reads, "One Lucky Winner Drives Me Home."
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Wheels.
dialog: 89.
text: They RACE to the car, JUMP UP onto the platform. Percy FENDS
text: OFF the Lotus-Eaters while Grover HOT WIRES the car.
text: It STARTS. Percy and Annabeth FALL into their seats as
text: Grover FLOORS it. The car SAILS OFF the platform, through
text: the casino, and CRASHES through the front door.
scene_heading: EXT. LOTUS LAND/LAS VEGAS - DAY
text: The car FLIES through the entrance and DRIVES OFF INTO THE
speaker_heading: NIGHT.
text: SEVERAL YOUNG LOTUS EATERS run outside. The moment they
text: leave the casino, their bodies AGE SEVERAL YEARS. They WATCH
text: Percy's car DRIVE AWAY. The Lotus Eaters TURN and GO BACK
text: INSIDE. As they pass back through the casino entrance, their
text: bodies RETURN to their YOUTHFUL STATE.
scene_heading: EXT. VEGAS STRIP - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: The sky is covered with DARK, CHURNING STORM CLOUDS. The
text: wind is BLOWING FIERCELY, scattering DEBRIS. The Lotus Elan
text: SPEEDS along the middle of the Vegas strip. A NEWSPAPER
text: blows onto the windshield.
scene_heading: INT. LOTUS ELAN - DAY
text: Grover WEAVES in and out of traffic, trying to see as
text: Annabeth grabs the NEWS PAPER. She LOOKS AT the date.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
text: It's June 20th.
text: Percy GRABS the paper, looks at it.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: We were in there a week! ?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Felt like a day.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: June 20th... That means... tomorrow
dialog: is... the Summer Solstice.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Actually midnight. Tonight.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: So how do we get to Hades?
text: Percy opens THE MAP, revealing the GLOWING LOCATION OF HADES.
dialog: It reads:
text: LOS ANGELES. Beside it, is a sketch of THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN.
dialog: 90.
text: Grover SLAMS his foot on the gas. The Lotus SPEEDS down the
dialog: strip... OVER 100 MPH!
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - LATER - DAY
text: Traffic is BUMPER-TO-BUMPER on the 110 north through
text: downtown. In the midst of traffic, is the Lotus convertible.
scene_heading: INT. LOTUS ELAN - DAY
text: Percy, Grover and Annabeth are NERVOUS. WORRIED. Grover
text: studies the map. The radio PLAYS.
speaker_heading: RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
text: Scientists are baffled by what now
text: appears to be a single storm cloud that
dialog: has expanded to cover the entire United
text: States. Hurricanes are building in the
text: gulf, savage waves along the country's
text: coast lines are endangering levees...
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: (worried, looking at the sky)
text: Zeus and Poseidon... Preparing for
dialog: battle...
speaker_heading: RADIO NEWSCASTER
dialog: In other news, wanted kidnapper and
dialog: suspected terrorist, 17 year old Percy
dialog: Jackson is still at large....
text: Grover TURNS OFF the radio. Annabeth rolls down the window,
text: sees a clock on a building. It reads: 12:47 PM.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Never thought I'd be late getting to
dialog: hell because of traffic.
text: Percy pauses, something deep inside is TROUBLING HIM. An
text: expression of DOUBT and WEAKNESS covers his face.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Look, guys... Maybe it's time...
dialog: time to stop.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Ares was right. Maybe I am being
dialog: selfish. I mean... we've got less
dialog: than twelve hours to stop the war.
dialog: We should go straight to Olympus.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: What about your Mom?
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: (defeated)
dialog: We've done everything we can...
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: (snaps at him)
dialog: Stop thinking like a mortal.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: (tough, passionate, strong)
dialog: I didn't come all this way to quit. We
dialog: can do this, Percy. We can save your Mom
dialog: and still stop the war. But you can't
dialog: stop believing in yourself. You've come
dialog: too far. Get those weak human thoughts
dialog: out of your head... and start acting like
dialog: a Demigod.
text: Percy nods, he'll go forward. Grover checks the MAP.
speaker_heading: GROVER
text: We're almost there. There's our exit.
text: Outside, a green exit sign reads: "RIGHT LANE... HOLLYWOOD".
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD SIGN - LATER - DAY
text: The world famous Hollywood sign. The Lotus Elan slides into
text: a PARKING SPOT, several feet below the sign. Percy and the
text: kids get out of the car, RUN UP THE STAIRS, toward the
text: HOLLYWOOD SIGN. Percy checks his MAP, looks up...
speaker_heading: PERCY'S POV
text: THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN. The words begin to re-arrange
text: themselves. The "YWOOD" section of the sign FADES AWAY. The
text: "O" morphs into an "E". The sign now reads: HELL.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: You're sure the entrance is here?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Positive.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD SIGN - LATER - DAY
text: Percy, Grover, and Annabeth hurriedly CLIMB to an area
text: directly below the sign. They are DWARFED by the letters.
text: They look around, cautiously. On the lower half of the
text: letter "H", there is a section of COLORFUL GRAFFITI, a
text: mixture of street and gang symbols.
dialog: 92.
text: Percy looks closely at the graffiti. It's actually GREEK
text: LETTERS. As he stares at them they take shape so that we
dialog: recognize them:
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."
text: Percy reaches out and GENTLY TOUCHES the "H" surface. There
text: is a LOUD CREAKING SOUND. The "H" SPINS, like a REVOLVING
text: DOOR, sending Percy, Annabeth and Grover INSIDE the sign.
scene_heading: INT. HOLLYWOOD SIGN - NIGHT
text: The revolving "H" STOPS, TRANSPORTING the kids into a
text: cramped, dark room, CARVED into the grassy, muddy earth.
text: Grover pulls out a pack of matches, LIGHTS ONE. This
text: ILLUMINATES the three kids and the FACE of
speaker_heading: VIRGIL.
text: He is tall, bone thin, with long, grey hair, piercing eyes,
text: and a haunted, tragic expression. His skin is pale, with a
text: blue tint. He is dressed in flowing DARK ROBES.
text: SURPRISED by Virgil's appearance, the kids JUMP BACK.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: The angel of death!
text: A tiny smile appears on Virgil's face.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Nothing so sinister, I'm afraid. I'm
dialog: Virgil. Guide of the underworld.
dialog: (looks at them)
dialog: The living are not permitted here.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I need to see Hades.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Die and come back.
text: Virgil turns, moving back into the DARKNESS.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: We'll pay you.
text: Virgil pauses, EXTENDS his hand. Grover puts all their cash
text: in the palm. It instantly INCINERATES. Virgil TURNS AWAY.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Wait...
dialog: 93.
text: Percy pulls out the GOLD DRACHMAS he stole from Medusa's
text: emporium, DROPS them into Virgil's hand. Virgil examines the
text: ancient drachmas and smiles.
text: Suddenly, the "H" SPINS AGAIN, REVOLVING Percy, Annabeth and
text: Grover OUT OF THE ROOM...
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD SIGN - DAY
text: The REVOLVING "H" stops. The kids are now BACK OUTSIDE.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: He tricked us.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Not exactly--
text: They turn, now overlooking the UNDERWORLD, the dark,
text: ALTERNATIVE UNIVERSE of Los Angeles. The expansive view of
text: Hollywood has changed dramatically, a POST-APOCALYPTIC vision
text: of the sunny, green landscape.
text: Scattered FIRES RAGE throughout the hills. BLACK SMOKE rises
text: from varied spots, SWIRLING into the BLOOD RED SKY. Homes
text: and buildings are burnt out, smoking, VACANT. Cars BURN,
text: many just skeletal FRAMES.
text: The streets of are filled with hundreds of SOULS OF THE
text: DEPARTED. They are white, ZOMBIE-LIKE figures, wandering
text: aimlessly through the city. The Souls are dressed in
text: tattered, dirty clothes, like homeless spectres. The sound
text: of their painful WAILING and MOANS echo through the air.
text: Virgil APPEARS, beside Percy, Grover and Annabeth, who stare
text: in horror at the sight before them.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Welcome to the underworld.
text: Virgil extends a TORCH.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I'll take you to Hades.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWORLD STREETS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Virgil leads the kids through the streets, making their way
text: through BURNT OUT cars, carcasses of DEAD ANIMALS and crowds
text: of WANDERING SOULS. Percy is ARMED with his shield and
text: SWORD. Annabeth holds her BOW and ARROW. Grover clutches
text: his DAGGER. As the kids PASS, the souls TOUCH them, GRAB
text: their hands, PULL their hair...
dialog: 94.

text: Souls of the recently departed, waiting
dialog: to find out what level of the underworld
dialog: they'll be sent to... They are harmless.
dialog: When they sense a living person, they
dialog: touch them... It's comforting, reminds
dialog: them of life's warmth.
text: One of the souls CARESSES Grover's cheek. He is REVOLTED.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Ewwww... Sooo cold...
scene_heading: EXT. HADES MANSION - LATER - DAY
text: Virgil leads Annabeth, Percy and Grover to the entrance of
text: Hades' home, a huge, ratty, dilapidated MANSION, surrounded
text: by RUSTED IRON GATES. The facade is CRUMBLING, filled with
text: CRACKS. Windows are BROKEN. Horrible sounds of SCREAMING
text: and INHUMAN GROWLING echo from inside the mansion. Virgil
text: removes a rusty RING OF KEYS, finds one and OPENS the gate.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: We'll find Hades inside.
text: The kids step through the gate. The Souls of the Departed
text: try to follow, Virgil KEEPS them back, CLOSING the gates.
text: Virgil leads Percy, Grover and Annabeth through the overgrown
text: lawn, toward the FRONT DOOR. There is a GROWLING SOUND.
text: A few feet away, TWO HELLHOUNDS feast on the carcass of a
text: DEAD ANIMAL. They LOOK UP, seeing Percy. The Hellhounds
text: MOVE TOWARD Percy. He EXTENDS his sword. The hellhounds
text: RETRACT, staying back, not taking their eyes off of the kids.
text: Virgil leads Percy. Annabeth and Grover onto the crumbling
text: stone porch, toward the ROTTING FRONT DOOR. The rusted brass
text: KNOCKER is shaped like a LARGE EAGLE. Percy REACHES UP to
text: knock. Virgil TRIES to stop him...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: That's--
text: But Percy GRABS the knocker anyway. The BRASS EAGLE COMES TO
text: LIFE, SCREECHES and BITES Percy's HAND. Percy LEAPS BACK,
text: his hand BLOODIED. He LOOKS to the door. The knocker is
text: BACK TO NORMAL.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: --not a good idea.
text: Percy WIPES the blood from his hand. Virgil removes ANOTHER
text: KEY and OPENS the door. Virgil GLARES at Percy.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I'm the guide. Remember?
dialog: 95.
text: Percy nods. They ENTER.
scene_heading: INT. HADES MANSION - HALLWAY - DAY
text: Percy, Annabeth and Grover ENTER. They are in a gigantic
text: hallway, flanked by a TWISTING STAIRCASE. Furniture and
text: lighting fixtures are covered in mounds of DUST and COBWEBS.
text: RATS play on the floor, scattered SPIDERS and LIZARDS crawl
text: along the walls. Floorboards, sections of the staircase...
text: are ROTTED AWAY.
text: Grover STEPS onto a rotted section of the floor. It BREAKS
text: AWAY. Grover FALLS, GRABBING onto the edge. BELOW HIM, is a
text: large BASEMENT, filled with angry, hungry LOST SOULS. These
text: are very DIFFERENT creatures from the lost souls in the
text: streets. They are VICIOUS. DEADLY. They GRAB and CLAW at
text: Grover's legs, trying to PULL HIM DOWN BELOW.
text: Grover KICKS and SCREAMS, managing to KNOCK a few of them
text: away. Percy and Annabeth PULL at Grover, trying to SAVE HIM.
text: Finally, they PULL HIM to safety.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: You said they were harmless!
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: These are the lost souls, already
dialog: condemned to eternal damnation.
dialog: Very angry. And quite dangerous.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: No shit.
text: A LOUD, BOOMING VOICE ECHOES through the hallway.
speaker_heading: HADES (0.S.)
dialog: Who dares enter my home?!?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: It's Virgil... I bring visitors.
speaker_heading: HADES
dialog: Who?!
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Percy Jackson. Son of Poseidon.
speaker_heading: HADES
dialog: (pause, calm)
dialog: Nephew. I've been expecting you.
text: Virgil leads the kids into another room, toward the SOUND of
dialog: Hades' VOICE...
dialog: 96.
scene_heading: INT. HADES DINING ROOM - DAY
text: CAMERA PANS ALONG a long DINING ROOM TABLE, covered with an
text: ABUNDANCE OF FOOD... CAKES, ROASTS, VEGETABLES... All are
scene_heading: ROTTING... Covered in COBWEBS, MAGGOTS and DUST. CAMERA
text: CRANES BACK. We are inside of Hades elaborate, decaying
dialog: dining/sitting room.
text: Two large, tattered LEATHER CHAIRS face an enormous STONE
text: FIREPLACE. A ROARING FIRE is inside. From here, we see the
speaker_heading: SHAPES of
text: WRITHING, SCREAMING BODIES. Their muffled SCREAMS are heard.
text: Sitting in one chair, watching the screaming souls, is
text: PERSEPHONE, Hades' wife. She is dressed in black with long
text: dark hair. Her beauty is MASKED by pale skin, Goth make-up,
text: black lipstick, etc. She is bored, miserable, TRAPPED. She
text: sips a glass of red wine.
text: HADES is in the other chair. He is pale, rail-thin, with
text: long dark hair, dressed like a ROCKER in leather, skull rings
text: and boots. (Russel Brand meets Keith Richards). Hades holds
text: a near empty bottle of wine. A GLOBE, made up of human
text: bones, flickering with an INNER GOLDEN LIGHT, rests on a
text: pedestal beside Hades.
text: Percy, Annabeth and Grover enter, led by Virgil. Persephone
text: glances up first, SEES the kids. She FOCUSES on Grover. The
text: satyr notices her, is immediately ATTRACTED to her. Grover
text: smiles, raises an eyebrow. They exchange a SEDUCTIVE look.
text: Virgil CLEARS his throat.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Excuse me. Lord Hades, sir...
text: Hades TURNS, looks at the kids. He STANDS, walks to them.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: You're Hades?
speaker_heading: HADES
dialog: Would you prefer I look like --
text: Hades instantly TRANSFORMS into a HORRIFIC TEN-FOOT HIGH,
text: FLAMING-WINGED DEMON GOD. He gets RIGHT IN Annabeth's face.
speaker_heading: DEMON HADES
dialog: -- THIS!
text: The kids are FREAKED, even Virgil is terrified. Hades
text: returns to NORMAL. Virgil NERVOUSLY backs out of the room.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Well... It appears that my services are
dialog: no longer needed... Good luck, Mr.
dialog: Jackson. Enjoy your stay.
text: Virgil practically STUMBLES over himself, RUNNING OUT of the
text: room. Hades RAISES AN EYEBROW to Percy.
speaker_heading: HADES
dialog: You are brave to come here, nephew...
dialog: I can see the disgust in your eyes...
dialog: Disgust for my world, for what I have
dialog: become. But this was not my choice. I
dialog: was banished here by Zeus and your
dialog: Father. And they have succeeded in
dialog: making my life a....
dialog: (irony not lost)
dialog: Living hell.
dialog: (points to food)
dialog: Do you know what it's like to be me?
text: Every feeling has been taken away.
dialog: I feel no joy, I feel no pain. I
dialog: am hungry, but I cannot taste. I
dialog: am tired, but I cannot sleep.
dialog: (looks at Persephone)
dialog: I am in love. But I can never
dialog: fulfill my desire.
text: Persephone turns away. Hades points to the screaming,
text: writhing souls that SCREAM from his fireplace.
speaker_heading: HADES
dialog: The only pleasure in my life, is
dialog: human suffering. When others feel
dialog: pain, when others experience hurt
dialog: and tragedy... I feel total and
dialog: complete joy. I feed on misery.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I am damned to this existence.
dialog: And my only chance of getting out
dialog: of here, is by defeating my brothers,
dialog: and taking control of Olympus. But...
dialog: (extends hand to Percy)
dialog: I need the bolt.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: (eyes burning)
dialog: And I need my Mother.
speaker_heading: HADES
dialog: Give me the bolt. And you will see
dialog: her again.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I'm not the Lightning Thief. I don't
dialog: have the bolt. I never did.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: HADES
dialog: Do you take me for a fool?
text: Percy holds up his SHIELD and SWORD for protection.
speaker_heading: HADES
dialog: Give it to me... or say goodbye to
dialog: your Mother.
text: Hades turns, GRABS the human bone globe from its pedestal and
text: THROWS it onto the ground, directly in front of Percy. The
text: globe EXPLODES, and there, frozen in a SHOWER OF GOLD, just
text: as she was when the Minotaur was about to kill her, is
text: Percy's mom. UNCONSCIOUS. The shower of light DISSIPATES.
text: Percy's mom WAKES, sits up, sees her son.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Percy?
text: Percy's eyes fill with TEARS. He drops his shield and sword,
text: RUNS to Sally. She looks into her son's eyes, smiles warmly.
text: They EMBRACE. Annabeth and Grover are touched. Even Hades'
text: wife, Persephone, is MOVED. Percy LOOKS at his Mother.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Thought I lost you forever.
text: Sally LOOKS AROUND at her surroundings.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Are we dead?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Not yet. But we're working on it.
text: Hades SEES something OFFSCREEN, that catches his attention:
text: Percy's SHIELD. It lies FACE DOWN. The handle appears to be
text: GLOWING. SURGING with LIGHT.
text: Hades walks up to the shield, PICKS it up. Hades RIPS the
text: golden handle from the shield. The handle TRANSFORMS into a
text: long clear cylinder, filled with surging, white LIGHTNING.
speaker_heading: HADES
text: Zeus' master bolt.
dialog: (to Percy)
dialog: You lied.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: That wasn't my shield...
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Luke gave it to him--
dialog: (a realization)
dialog: We were set-up.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Luke was the Lightning Thief.
speaker_heading: HADES
dialog: (looks to the bolt)
dialog: Now... I can become King of the Gods.
text: Hades turns to Persephone.
speaker_heading: HADES
dialog: Take their weapons. Feed them to Kronos.
text: Persephone nods. She stands, takes Percy's sword and shield,
text: Grover's dagger, Annabeth's bow and arrow. She LEADS Percy,
text: Sally, Annabeth and Grover out of the room. Persephone makes
text: eye contact with Grover, still sharing an intense ATTRACTION.
scene_heading: INT. HADES' HOME - CELLAR - LATER
text: An enormous CELLAR, with towering vaulted brick ceilings and
text: a series of tunnels that stretch into DARKNESS. The walls
text: are DRIPPING WET. Percy, Annabeth, Sally and Grover STAND in
text: the middle of the cellar.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: I never would have suspected Luke...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: But why did he hide the bolt in his
dialog: shield? Why did he give it to me?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Add that to the long list of things
dialog: I'll never know. Like the feeling of
dialog: a naked woman... or the sweet smell of--
text: There is a LOUD GRINDING SOUND. In the middle of the stone
text: floor, BRICKS SEPARATE... The floor begins to SLIDE OPEN...
text: revealing a deep PIT... Inside, there is...
text: A WHIRLPOOL OF FIRE.
text: From deep in the pit, within the flames, something STIRS...
text: It ROARS... Then SCREAMS.
text: Everyone RUNS to the side of the cellar, CLUTCHING the walls
text: for dear life. The floor continues to SLIDE OPEN, revealing
text: the waiting FLAMES directly beneath them...
text: A GIANT, DEMON-LIKE FACE, made entirely of flames, APPEARS in
text: the whirlpool.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Kronos. Father of the Gods.
dialog: Technically, your Grandfather.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: My Grandfather?
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: You, my friend, are the proud member
dialog: of a very dysfunctional family.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Think your old man was a Deadbeat Dad?...
dialog: At least he didn't eat his kids.
text: The face of Kronos ROARS. The floor CONTINUES TO SLIDE
text: OPEN...
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Or his grandkids.
text: Only a FEW FEET OF FLOOR REMAIN. Grover and Sally CLUTCH to
text: the walls for dear life. Annabeth WRAPS her arms around
text: Percy, holds him tight, WHISPERS in his ear.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: A sonnet... from ancient Greece...
dialog: (softly)
dialog: He is more than a hero.
dialog: (through tears)
dialog: He is a god in my eyes.
text: The floor continues to OPEN... INCHES AWAY from everyone
dialog: falling to their deaths...
text: Annabeth and Percy SHARE A FINAL KISS... MOMENTS from death.
text: Sally WITNESSES this, sees that her son has FOUND LOVE.
text: Suddenly... the floor STOPS OPENING. Everyone EXCHANGES a
text: puzzled look, HOLDING ONTO the tiny ledge of rock. The
text: ROARING, FLAMING FACE OF KRONOS screams from below...
text: The floor BEGINS TO CLOSE.
text: The kids and Sally look bewildered, as the FLOORS CLOSES
text: BELOW them, much to the dismay of a SCREAMING KRONOS.
text: A HOODED FIGURE appears, RACING DOWN the stairs, toward
text: Percy, Sally, Annabeth and Grover. The figure REMOVES its
dialog: hood. It's...
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Persephone?!
speaker_heading: PERSEPHONE
dialog: Follow me.
dialog: 101.
scene_heading: INT. HADES' PALACE —- HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Persephone is returning the kids' gear, handing Annabeth her
text: bow and arrow, Percy his sword and shield, Grover his dagger.
text: Persephone gives Percy ZEUS' BOLT.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Why did you save us?
speaker_heading: PERSEPHONE
dialog: Hades has been cruel and abusive...
dialog: forcing me into a loveless marriage.
dialog: Like your Mother, I was abducted by
dialog: Hades. I agreed to be his wife, only
dialog: if he would allow me to return to the
dialog: surface for three months each year. It's
dialog: all that I have to look forward to. A
dialog: war of the Gods will destroy everything
dialog: I hold dear in the mortal world...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: We'll do everything we can to stop it.
text: Persephone nods, smiles. She looks at them.
speaker_heading: PERSEPHONE
dialog: You have the pearls?
text: Grover removes the THREE GREEN PEARLS from his backpack.
speaker_heading: PERSEPHONE
dialog: Only three.
dialog: (Grover nods)
dialog: One of you will have to stay behind.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: PERSEPHONE
dialog: Each pearl protects only a single person.
text: Whoever's blood touches it.
text: The kids look at each other, unaware of that.
speaker_heading: PERSEPHONE
dialog: Make your choice quickly.
text: Sally turns to Percy.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I'll stay. You're young, you have your
dialog: whole life ahead of you... You need to
dialog: experience it--
text: Percy TAKES Grover's dagger, quickly GRABS his mom's hand and
text: makes a slight CUT on her finger...
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Percy!--
text: A drop of Sally's BLOOD trickles onto one of the pearls.
text: Percy gives the bloody pearl to her. Percy then REACHES for
text: Annabeth's hand. She RETRACTS her hand.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Don't even think about it. You go
dialog: with your mom.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: You three are going. I'm staying.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Percy. There's--
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: No time to argue. You have to get
text: Zeus's bolt back to Olympus.
text: He GRABS Annabeth's hand. She spins, KICKS the dagger out of
text: Percy's hand. As Annabeth reaches for it, Percy activates
text: Riptide and SWINGS, making a SHALLOW CUT across her arm. Her
text: blood DRIPS to the floor.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: No!
text: Percy ROLLS the pearl in Annabeth's blood, hands it to her.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Take care of my mom. And...
dialog: (whispers to her)
dialog: Stay safe. I'll never forget you.
text: She nods, eyes TEARY. Percy TURNS to Grover.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Give me your hand.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: I'm not letting you stay.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Give me your hand!
text: Grover reluctantly HOLDS OUT his hand. Just as Percy is
text: about to CUT Grover's hand... Hades ENTERS.
speaker_heading: HADES
dialog: WHERE IS THE BOLT?!
text: Hades immediately TRANSFORMS INTO DEMONIC FORM.
dialog: 103.
text: In that instance, Grover quickly SINKS HIS TEETH into Percy's
text: arm, DRAWING BLOOD.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Ouuchh!
text: Grover GRABS the third pearl, DRIPS Percy's blood onto it.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: I'm the protector. Not you.
text: Hades RACES toward Percy. He extends his sword, SWINGING
speaker_heading: WILDLY.
text: Percy's sword PIERCES Hades' chest. The wound is DEEP.
text: Hades is SENT to the floor. BLACK blood pours from his
text: wound. Hades, WRITHING in pain, REVERTS to his human self.
text: Percy LOOKS BACK to the others.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Break the pearls!
text: Annabeth and Sally SMASH THE PEARLS on the ground. They
text: EXPLODE in a green flash, ENVELOPING Sally and Annabeth in a
text: separate GREEN SPHERE.
text: Each sphere begins to FLOAT OFF off the floor.
text: Percy CRUSHES the remaining green pearl in his hand. He is
text: suddenly ENVELOPED in the sphere. Percy LOOKS to Grover.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: It was an honor protecting you.
dialog: Get the bolt to Olympus. You're
dialog: our only hope.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I will. And then I'll get you
dialog: out of here. I promise.
text: Grover exchanges a lustful smile with Persephone.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Take your time.
text: Percy FLOATS AWAY with the others. Grover looks to Hades,
text: badly WOUNDED on the floor. A HAND REACHES OUT and GRABS
text: him. It's PERSEPHONE. She LEADS Grover OUT of the house.
text: The three green orbs RISE UP. Percy calls to the others.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: We need to concentrate, focus on
dialog: where we're going...
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: To Olympus.
dialog: 104.
text: The three orbs PASS THROUGH the roof of the mansion...
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY - LATER - NIGHT
text: The Empire State Building is adorned with red, white and blue
text: lights. Dark, ominous STORM CLOUDS are in the sky. There is
text: THUNDER. The few pedestrians on the streets, struggle to
text: walk against the STRONG WIND. It's OMINOUS, EERIE, like the
dialog: world is about to end...
text: THREE GREEN ORBS carrying Percy, Annabeth and Sally, rise up
text: through the street directly in front of the Empire State
text: Building. The orbs DISSOLVE. Percy looks around, confused.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: This isn't Olympus. It's New York City.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
text: The entrance to Olympus is in there.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: The Empire State Building?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: (nods )
text: A secret elevator. Top floor.
text: Percy glances to a clock on a nearby building: 11:43 PM.
speaker_heading: PERCY
text: Seventeen minutes 'til the war begins.
dialog: Let's move!
text: Percy removes the lightning bolt CYLINDER from his backpack,
text: clutching it tightly. Annabeth, Percy and Sally HURRY to the
text: entrance doors. A FAMILIAR VOICE calls out to them...
speaker_heading: LUKE (0.S.)
dialog: Percy! Give me the bolt!
text: They all STOP, TURN UPWARD, to the direction of the voice.
dialog: It's LUKE.
text: He is dressed in FULL ARMOR, holding a LONG, SHARP SWORD.
text: Luke HOVERS several feet above them, wearing his own... very
text: cool, very sleek... WINGED SHOES.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Luke... Why did you steal Zeus' bolt?
speaker_heading: LUKE
text: To start a war between Poseidon and Zeus.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: That's why you hid it in your shield
dialog: and gave it to me?...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: When I discovered that you were going
dialog: to the underworld, I realized... If
dialog: Hades got his hand on the bolt... There
dialog: would be a three way war.
text: Percy ACTIVATES Riptide. Luke ROCKETS toward Percy, SWIPES
text: at him with his sword. Percy DEFLECTS the blow, FALLING onto
text: the ground. Percy DROPS the bolt. It begins to ROLL AWAY...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Annabeth! The bolt!
text: Annabeth RUSHES to the bolt. Luke SWOOPS DOWN, delivers a
text: SPINNING KICK that sends Annabeth CRASHING into a parked car.
text: Luke GRABS the bolt, FLIES UP onto a building ledge above.
text: Percy and Sally RUN to Annabeth, help her up. Annabeth's
text: SHAKEN, the WIND KNOCKED OUT of her. They hear a SLOW,
text: BUZZING SOUND. They look to the DIRECTION of the sound...
text: The sound EMANATES from the bolt in Luke's hand. There is a
text: HAIRLINE CRACK at the top of the bolt. BRIGHT, tentacled
text: SPARKS OF ELECTRICITY emit from the crack.
text: Luke GENTLY MOVES his hand.
text: The slightest movement RELEASES LIGHTNING from the bolt. The
text: STRONGER the movement, the more ELECTRICITY is released...
text: Luke's eyes burn with a newfound POWER. Percy CALLS to him.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Why do you want a war of the gods?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Control. They've been in power for too
dialog: many years. It's time for our generation
dialog: to take over. Centuries ago, the
dialog: Olympians defeated their parents and took
dialog: control. Why shouldn't we do the same?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Because you'll destroy all of mankind
dialog: in the process..
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Exactly. Giving the young Gods an
dialog: opportunity to start over, to create
dialog: a new world of heroes...
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: You're no hero.
text: With a quick SNAP of his wrist, Luke TRIGGERS the bolt.
text: A BLAST OF LIGHTING shoots out and blows a MASSIVE HOLE into
text: the building behind Percy, Annabeth and Sally. They LEAP OUT
text: OF THE WAY as concrete and brick fall around them.
text: Luke smiles, glances to the bolt, impressed.
text: Percy glances to a nearby FIRE HYDRANT, CONCENTRATING on it.
text: Luke AIMS the bolt at them again. He FIRES. They DASH out
text: of the way. The lightning STRIKES a nearby EMPTY GARBAGE
text: TRUCK. The truck is INCINERATED, leaving a massive CRATER in
dialog: the street.
text: Directly below Luke, the FIRE HYDRANT starts to SHAKE. Luke
dialog: DOESN'T NOTICE.
text: FURIOUS, Luke glares at Percy, Annabeth and Sally... He AIMS
text: the bolt, about to BLAST THEM, when... The fire hydrant below
text: EXPLODES. Water SHOOTS UPWARD and BLASTS Luke.
text: The force KNOCKS LUKE OFF the building ledge. Luke FALLS,
text: LANDS on the ground. DAZED, nearly UNCONSCIOUS.
text: The lightning bolt LIES on the ground, a few feet beside him.
text: Percy DRAWS his sword, RUNS forward and REACHES DOWN, about
dialog: to grab the bolt...
text: Luke is QUICK. He DRAWS his sword, LEAPS to his feet and
text: STOPS Percy from getting the bolt. Luke and Percy FACE OFF
text: against each other. The bolt is on the ground BETWEEN THEM.
text: They begin to FIGHT, swords CLASHING.
text: Percy SHOUTS to Annabeth and Sally.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Get to Olympus! Tell Zeus everything!
text: Annabeth and Sally RUN INSIDE the Empire State Building.
text: Percy and Luke continue a HEATED BATTLE. Percy is nearly
text: Luke's equal. They fight like TWO WARRIORS.
scene_heading: INT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - LOBBY - NIGHT
text: Annabeth and Sally RUN INSIDE. The SECURITY GUARD calls out.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Hey!... Observation deck's closed--
dialog: 107.
text: Annabeth and Sally IGNORE him, JUMP into an OPEN ELEVATOR.
text: The DOORS CLOSE, just as the Security Guard RUNS UP.
scene_heading: EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - STREET - NIGHT
text: Luke and Percy are still in a HEATED SWORDFIGHT. Luke is
text: FASTER. He PULLS BACK his sword. WHACK! SLICES across
text: Percy's midsection.
text: Percy FALLS to his knees, BLEEDING, a DEEP CUT ACROSS his
dialog: torso.
text: Luke GRABS the bolt.
text: He TURNS to the Empire State Building, AIMS the bolt at the
text: rooftop, toward the LIGHTNING ROD perched here. Luke SNAPS
text: his wrist, FIRES at the lightning rod. A DIRECT HIT,
text: ENGULFING the building in a WEB OF INTENSE ELECTRICITY.
text: The Empire State Building's POWER GOES OUT, along with half
text: of the block. The building's lights FLICKER OFF.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
text: The elevator lights GO OUT. The elevator STOPS. Annabeth
text: and Sally exchange a WORRIED glance.
scene_heading: EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - STREET - NIGHT
text: Percy RISES, holding Riptide and CONCENTRATING on something
speaker_heading: OFFSCREEN.
text: Luke AIMS the bolt at PERCY'S HEART.
text: Concentrating, Percy causes two more fire hydrants to
speaker_heading: EXPLODE.
text: Instead of the water shooting up, the water TAKES ON A LIFE
text: OF ITS OWN. It TURNS and WHIPS BACK toward Luke, about to
scene_heading: PUMMEL HIM.
text: Luke deftly FLIES around the water, outmaneuvers it with his
text: winged shoes.
text: Luke takes AIM, about to FIRE at Percy...
dialog: Percy DIVES.
text: Luke FIRES A LIGHTNING BLAST.
text: It BLOWS out the windows of a storefront, causing a WALL OF
text: SMOKE and FALLING DEBRIS.
text: Luke searches for Percy, CAN'T SEE him.
dialog: 108.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
text: Percy DUCKS into an alley, grabs his backpack and removes the
dialog: pair of...
text: WINGED SHOES.
text: Percy hurriedly PUTS ON THE SHOES. He sees Luke FLY PAST.
text: Percy takes off, FLYING RIGHT AT HIM.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY ABOVE MANHATTAN - NIGHT
text: A HIGH SPEED CHASE between Percy and Luke, FLYING through the
text: cavernous streets of Manhattan.
text: Luke looks back and FIRES at Percy. Percy DEFLECTS with his
dialog: sword blade.
text: They arrive over the SHORES OF THE HUDSON.
text: Percy picks up speed, SLAMS into Luke from behind.
text: Luke DROPS the lightning bolt.
text: It LANDS on the grassy shore below.
text: Percy and Luke begin a mid-air SWORDFIGHT, as they move out
text: over the Hudson River.
text: They fight in the air like two acrobatics, FLIPPING, SPINNING
text: as their swords clash.
text: Luke delivers several DEVASTATING BLOWS. Percy is WEAKENED,
text: BLEEDING, but still fighting like a hero.
text: Luke SLICES THE WINGS off of Percy's left shoe.
text: Percy LOSES altitude. He STRUGGLES to stay in the air.
text: Percy FALLS and SLAMS into a WOODEN DOCK. He's SHAKEN. OUT
text: OF BREATH. Badly WOUNDED.
text: Luke FLIES down toward Percy, sword in hand.
text: Percy EXTENDS his hand toward the River. He TIGHTENS his
text: brow. Using every bit of his strength, every muscle in his
text: body, Percy CLOSES HIS EYES. Concentrates INTENSELY.
text: Luke LANDS on the dock, directly in front of Percy.
text: Luke RAISES his sword, to FINISH OFF Percy...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: It's over. I've won.
text: The river begins to RUMBLE. CHURN. WAVES form.
dialog: 109.
text: Luke TURNS, sees... An ENORMOUS WAVE. HEADING STRAIGHT for
text: them. Luke starts to RUN, attempts to FLY AWAY.
text: The wave completely ENGULFS Percy, Luke and the dock. The
text: water appears to REACH OUT and GRAB Luke out of the air. The
text: wave PULLS HIM DOWN UNDER THE WATER.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT
text: The wave FORMS a WHIRLPOOL around Luke. He is being DRAGGED
text: beneath the water below, SCREAMING. Within moments...
text: Luke's screams FADE. He's GONE.
scene_heading: EXT. HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT
text: THUNDER CRACKS in the sky above New York. Waves CRASH
text: against the shore. And then... majestically...
text: Percy RISES UP out of the water, as if he is being CARRIED by
text: the sea. He RIDES the wave, controlling its every move. He
text: looks down, sees the lightning bolt LYING ON THE SHORE BELOW.
text: Percy RIDES the wave low, REACHES DOWN and SNATCHES the
text: lightning bolt.
scene_heading: EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS - NIGHT
text: Percy RIDES THE WAVE through the streets of Manhattan like a
text: SURFER without a board.
text: The DARKENED Empire State Building is dead ahead.
text: Percy RAISES the bolt, extends it toward the LIGHTNING ROD,
text: at the TOP of the Building.
text: Percy FIRES the bolt.
text: The Empire State Building is engulfed in ELECTRICITY,
text: RESTORING POWER to the building. The lights FLICKER, TURN
text: BACK ON.
scene_heading: INT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - ELEVATOR - NIGHT
text: The lights SNAP ON. Annabeth and Sally are surprised, the
text: car starts to MOVE. GOING UPWARD.
scene_heading: EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - NIGHT
text: The wave CARRIES Percy right up to the entrance of the Empire
text: State Building. Percy STEPS OFF, looks up at a clock, on a
text: nearby building. It reads: 11:55 PM.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Five minutes...
dialog: 110.
scene_heading: EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT
text: Annabeth and Sally get out. Moments later, Percy EXITS
text: another elevator, the lightning bolt in his hand. Annabeth
text: GRABS Percy by the arm, leads him forward.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: We have exactly ninety seconds to get
dialog: to Olympus.
text: Annabeth leads Percy and Sally to a small SUPPLY CLOSET. She
text: OPENS the door. Inside, is a tiny, cluttered CLOSET filled
text: with cleaning supplies. They ENTER.
scene_heading: INT. SUPPLY CLOSET/SECRET ELEVATOR - NIGHT
text: Annabeth REMOVES cleaning supplies from the shelves. Behind
text: the middle shelf, on the wall, is a rusty BUTTON that reads:
speaker_heading: FLOOR 600.
text: Annabeth PUSHES the button. The supply closet door CLOSES.
text: The room RUMBLES, becoming an ELEVATOR. They move UPWARD.
scene_heading: EXT. OLYMPUS - SECONDS LATER - NIGHT
text: The elevator door OPENS. Percy, Annabeth, and Sally step
text: out. Below them, is the STORMY SKYLINE of Manhattan, from
text: the height of an airplane. In front, marble steps wind up
text: into the spine of a cloud, into the sky. From the top of the
text: clouds, rises the decapitated PEAK OF A MOUNTAIN, its summit
text: covered with snow. Clinging to the mountainside, are dozens
text: of multi-leveled PALACES. At the top of the peak, the
text: LARGEST PALACE gleams against the snow. Percy stares in awe.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Olympus.
text: They hear a FAMILIAR VOICE.
speaker_heading: CHIRON (0.S.)
text: Cutting it close.
text: CHIRON is standing beside them.
speaker_heading: PERCY /ANNABETH
dialog: Chiron!
speaker_heading: CHIRON
dialog: Let's go.
text: They RACE up the TORCH LIT stairs.
dialog: 111.
scene_heading: INT. ZEUS'S PALACE - THRONE ROOM - LATER - NIGHT
text: The ROOM looks out over all of Olympus. Twelve GIGANTIC,
text: ELEVATED THRONES, are arranged in an inverted U, around a
text: SWIRLING, LIVING GLOBE. All of the Olympians are seated and
text: present: Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Apollo, Artemis, Hestia,
text: Hephaestus, Ares, Hermes, Demeter, Aphrodite, and Athena.
text: In the first throne, is ZEUS. He resembles a strong, ROMAN
text: EMPEROR, a sculpted, grim face, his eyes rainy grey, with a
text: well trimmed beard.
text: Next to him is POSEIDON. He resembles a handsome SURFER.
text: His skin is deeply tanned, hands scarred like an old
text: fisherman's. His hair is long, sun streaked. His striking
text: blue eyes are identical to Percy's. A faded tattoo of a
text: TRIDENT is on his muscular forearm.
text: The Gods are in the middle of an intense, HEATED ARGUMENT.
text: Zeus and Poseidon are the most angry, looking as if they're
text: about to get into a fist-fight. Athena tries to intervene.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Brothers, brothers... Please... Sit
dialog: down, discuss this rationally... War
dialog: is not the answer.
speaker_heading: ARES
dialog: Sure it is. It always is.
text: An ANCIENT CLOCK on the wall COUNTS DOWN...
dialog: Oneee Seee Gees
text: Zeus gets right into Poseidon's face.
dialog: 3.22 2.2. lene
speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: Let the war begin--
speaker_heading: CHIRON (0.S.)
dialog: Lord Zeus! Wait!
text: The Gods TURN to the sound of Chiron's VOICE. Chiron RUNS
text: into the throne room, along with Percy, Annabeth and Sally.
text: We realize that the throne room and the gods are GIGANTIC.
text: The Gods are each nearly THIRTY FEET TALL, DWARFING Chiron
text: and the humans. Athena is SURPRISED to see Annabeth.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Annabeth?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: (nervous )
dialog: Hey, Mom.
dialog: 112.
text: Percy steps forward, holding the MASTER LIGHTNING BOLT.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Hi. I'm... My name's Percy Jackson.
dialog: And, I... I think you guys might be
dialog: looking for this...
text: Zeus looks at Poseidon, who can't help but smile a little.
text: Zeus GLARES at Percy.
speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: The Lightning Thief. I knew it.
dialog: (extends his hand)
dialog: Bring it to me.
text: Percy walks forward, places the bolt up into Zeus' GIGANTIC
text: PALM. When it is placed into Zeus' hand, the bolt GROWS BACK
dialog: to its normal size.
speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: Congratulations. You've managed to save
dialog: what's left of your Father's reputation.
text: Percy turns, exchanges his FIRST LOOK with Poseidon. Percy's
text: eyes remain COLD, HARD. He TURNS back to Zeus.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I didn't steal the lightning bolt. If
dialog: my father had asked me to do something
dialog: for him, I would have said "no"
dialog: (indifferent)
dialog: I have no loyalty to him. I owe him
dialog: nothing.
text: Poseidon lowers his head slightly. Zeus smiles, amused.
speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: I believe you owe your personality to
dialog: him.
dialog: (pauses, curious)
dialog: But if you didn't take the bolt... Why
dialog: do you have it?
speaker_heading: PERCY
text: It was stolen by Luke, son of Hermes.
speaker_heading: HERMES
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: I have a son named Luke?
text: Zeus raises an eyebrow to Percy.
speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: Why should I believe you?
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: You don't have to. All you have to do
dialog: is honor your word. I've returned the
dialog: bolt by the summer solstice. Now call
dialog: off the war.
text: Zeus turns to Poseidon, back to Percy.
speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: For the sake of peace in our family,
dialog: there will be no war.
dialog: (to Percy)
dialog: You have done me a great service.
dialog: If there's ever anything I can do
dialog: for you, feel free to ask--
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: There's a Satyr, my protector... named
text: Grover... He's being held prisoner by
dialog: Hades. Could you set him free?
text: Zeus contemplates this, not so sure. Poseidon intervenes.
speaker_heading: POSEIDON
dialog: You could make a trade... I hear that
dialog: Percy killed many of Hades' pets...
dialog: (turns to Percy)
dialog: Did you keep any tokens?
text: Percy digs the MINOTAUR HORN out of his backpack.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: This.
speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: (takes the horn)
dialog: That will do. Hades loved that hideous
dialog: beast. He can grow a new one with this.
dialog: Yes... I think we'll be able to get your
dialog: friend released.
text: Annabeth steps forward, tentatively at first.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: I have an announcement.
text: All of the Gods TURN to her. Annabeth TAKES Percy's hand.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
text: The son of Poseidon and the daughter
dialog: of Athena are officially--
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: --In love.
dialog: 114.
text: They exchange a KISS, much to the shock of Athena and
text: Poseidon. Annabeth looks at Athena and Poseidon.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: I think it's about time you two
dialog: stopped hating on each other.
text: Poseidon and Athena sigh, holding back their anger, putting
text: aside their feelings. For now. Zeus finds it all very
text: amusing, laughing.
speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: Our meeting is adjourned.
dialog: (glares at Poseidon)
dialog: I still don't trust you.
text: And with that, Zeus VANISHES in a blinding flash of
text: lightning. Athena LOOKS at Annabeth.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: We'll discuss this later, young lady.
text: Athena VANISHES. All of the Gods begin to VANISH. One by
text: one. Everyone... EXCEPT POSEIDON.
text: He looks down, catches Sally's eye for the first time.
text: Poseidon steps off the throne, walks forward. With each
text: step, he becomes SMALLER, soon becoming the size of a MORTAL.
text: Poseidon walks to Sally, gives her a TENDER KISS.
speaker_heading: POSEIDON
dialog: Good to see you, Sally. You look
dialog: beautiful.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: You too. Of course, you have that
text: eternal youth thing going on.
text: They exchange a warm SMILE. Poseidon turns, approaches
text: Percy. They look at each other. An estranged Father and
text: son, meeting for the FIRST TIME. It's TENSE, UNCOMFORTABLE.
speaker_heading: POSEIDON
dialog: I can't thank you enough, Percy. Few
dialog: heroes in history could have accomplished
dialog: what you've done. I'm proud of you, son--
text: He EXTENDS his hand. Percy IGNORES it, COLDLY. There is a
text: long silence, YEARS OF TENSION between them. Sally nods to
text: Annabeth and Chiron, LOOKS BACK to Percy.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: We'll leave you two alone.
text: Sally, Annabeth and Chiron move several feet away. Percy
text: TURNS to the window, looks out over the lands of Olympus.
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: POSEIDON
dialog: I'm not asking you to like me...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: No need. I didn't do it for you,
dialog: I did it to save mom.
speaker_heading: POSEIDON
dialog: I know that.
text: Percy continues to stare out at the LANDSCAPE OF OLYMPUS, his
dialog: back turned too Poseidon. Percy has so many questions... He
text: speaks softly, a DEEP SADNESS in his voice...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: How old was I? When you left?
speaker_heading: POSEIDON
dialog: Seven months.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Do you remember any of it?
speaker_heading: POSEIDON
dialog: Every moment. You were a beautiful
dialog: boy. Your Mother and I were in love.
dialog: I could have stayed forever...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: But you didn't.
speaker_heading: POSEIDON
dialog: I had other responsibilities.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: More important than us?
text: Percy turns, FACES Poseidon, who doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I didn't care if you were there all the
dialog: time... But I would have liked to see
dialog: you... even for a day... an hour...
dialog: (upset)
dialog: Why didn't you ever come back?
speaker_heading: POSEIDON
dialog: (pauses, difficult)
dialog: I wanted to. I just... When I was with
dialog: you... and your Mother...I became less
dialog: concerned about my responsibilities...
dialog: I was ignoring my natural destiny.
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I was becoming human.
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: And that's bad?
speaker_heading: POSEIDON
dialog: For a God? For the future of the
dialog: universe? Yes, Percy. That's bad.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: What about these last two weeks?... I
dialog: almost died out there... But you didn't
dialog: do anything. You didn't help me.
speaker_heading: POSEIDON
dialog: I was looking out for you every step
dialog: of the way. When you needed me, I
dialog: was there. Who do you think sent the
dialog: horses in the desert? Who spoke to you,
dialog: gave you clarity in Lotus Land?...
dialog: (passionate)
dialog: Just because you didn't see me, doesn't
dialog: mean I wasn't there. When you sit in
text: the bottom of the pool, trying to figure
dialog: out your life, the voice in your head
dialog: is me.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: (understanding)
dialog: So that's you...
speaker_heading: POSEIDON
dialog: (nods )
dialog: Passing out what advice I can. Most
dialog: of which, you tend to ignore, by the
dialog: way.
text: A TINY SMILE appears on Percy's face. Percy softens,
dialog: understands how complicated this must be for his Father.
speaker_heading: POSEIDON
dialog: I know this isn't the father-son
dialog: relationship you've always wanted,
dialog: but it's the best I can do.
dialog: (sincere)
dialog: I hope someday you'll see that.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: (long pause)
dialog: Olympus wasn't built in a day.
text: Poseidon smiles, EXTENDS his hand again. Percy pauses,
text: slowly SHAKES IT.
text: Poseidon pulls him close, in for an EMBRACE. Their FIRST
dialog: hug.
text: Sally is watching, a smile on her face, TEARS in her eyes.
dialog: 117.
scene_heading: INT. UGLIANO HOME - A FEW DAYS LATER - DAY
text: A DARK, OVERCAST DAY in New York City. Sweeping STORM CLOUDS
text: fill the air. Distant THUNDER rumbles. GABE sits alone, in
text: front of the TV, watching the news, drinking a beer.
speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHOR
dialog: Authorities have now confirmed that Percy
dialog: Jackson and his mother have been safely
dialog: returned after their month long ordeal.
dialog: Police now know that the two had been
dialog: kidnapped by this man...
text: A picture of ARES taken from a SECURITY CAMERA at the All-
text: American diner appears on screen.
speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHOR
dialog: The FBI has confirmed that he is also the
dialog: man responsible for vandalizing the
text: Parthenon in Nashville and the beheading
dialog: of at least one other victim. If you
dialog: have any information leading to--
text: Gabe CLICKS OFF the TV, annoyed. He CRUSHES the beer can.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Sally! I need another beer!
scene_heading: EXT. UGLIANO HOME - BACKYARD - DAY
text: Percy and his mom are reclining in BEACH CHAIRS, sipping cool
text: drinks. Annabeth sits in Percy's lap, arms around each
dialog: other.
text: In the background, GROVER stands at a GRILL, flipping
text: burgers. PERSEPHONE stands beside Grover, hand tucked into
text: his back pocket. She nibbles lustfully on his earlobe.
text: The sky is getting DARKER with storm clouds. THUNDER ROLLS.
text: Percy looks at his Mother.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I want to show you something.
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: Promise you won't be mad?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Oh, no. Now what?
text: Percy lifts up his shirt sleeve, revealing a TATTOO of a
text: TRIDENT on his right deltoid. It's an exact COPY of his
text: Father, Poseidon's, tattoo. Sally touches it, her face
text: flooding with FOND MEMORIES.
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I love it.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Is it permanent?
text: Percy pauses, shrugs.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Nothing's permanent, Mom.
text: Annabeth RAISES an eyebrow to him. Percy smiles.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Well... Maybe one thing.
text: They share a small kiss. Very much in love. There is a LOUD
text: CRACK OF THUNDER. The clouds get DARKER. Grover, cooking
text: the burgers, looks up into the sky.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Maybe we should move this party inside.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: No. I like it out here.
text: The sky ERUPTS with THUNDER, followed by several, intense,
text: bright BLASTS OF LIGHTNING. Percy watches the lightning
text: show, REFLECTED in his eyes. Then... it begins to RAIN. The
text: drops fall slowly at first, soon becoming a DOWNPOUR.
text: Grover, Persephone and Sally DUCK for cover, beneath a
text: rooftop overhang.
text: Percy stays where he is, Annabeth's head resting on his
text: shoulder. The cool rain showers over the couple. A smile
text: covers Percy's face, along with something else we've never
text: seen... an expression of PEACE and CONTENTMENT. From
text: OFFSCREEN we hear...
speaker_heading: GABE (0.S.)
dialog: Sally! Beer!
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Get it yourself, you lazy bum!
text: Percy looks back, exchanges a smile with Sally.
scene_heading: INT. UGLIANO KITCHEN - SAME
text: LIGHTNING CRACKS! Gabe storms into the kitchen, muttering.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Get it myself?!? You're gettin' to be
dialog: as lazy as that loser son of yours!
dialog: Well, I got news for both of you...
text: Gabe REACHES for the refrigerator door.
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: I'm the king of this castle and there
dialog: are gonna' be some changes made around
dialog: here--
text: Gabe OPENS the refrigerator and looks in horror. He sees...
text: The HEAD OF MEDUSA.
text: EYES WIDE OPEN. STARING back at Gabe.
text: There's a LOUD LIGHTNING CRACK!
text: THE SCREEN GOES WHITE.
text: THE END.
