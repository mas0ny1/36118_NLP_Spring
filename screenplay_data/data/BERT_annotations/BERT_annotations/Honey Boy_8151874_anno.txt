dialog: Scrap metal parts: everything that can’t be salvaged. GIANT
text: green screens are located at key points. Black smoke.
text: OTIS LORT (22) looking into the camera. He’s laser focused
text: and fine-tuned like an owl statue.
text: CLOSE ON: Otis registers a threat. We can’t see it. But it’s
text: no good - he holds up his hands, terrified.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: No... No, No.... No. No, no...
text: ON INVISIBLE IMPACT - RAMP SPEED: Blood flies, Skin ripples.
text: Otis is ratcheted hard across a flipped car, EXPLOSIONS go
text: off on cue all around him. Debris and black smoke everywhere.
text: And... CUT. We see the DIRECTOR getting excited about the
text: shot in a hand held monitor.
text: Otis gets lowered to the ground still tied in a harness.
text: The Stunt Coordinator arrives and sprays the set and Otis
text: with foam. 2nd A.C. enters with the sticks.
text: Otis walks back up to reset. He looks into the camera to do
dialog: it all over again.
dialog: Frame up on the slate: 2005
text: TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. WRECKED SET - LATE AFTERNOON
text: We're over Otis's shoulder, walking stiffly through
text: production in a body harness he can’t remove.
text: As he walks towards his trailer we see flashes of various
text: ACTION SCENES he’s filmed for the movie.
text: - Shirtless and fist-fighting in a dark trailer... and CUT.
text: - Breaking out of jail through an underground tunnel... and
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: - Wandering through the desert holding a shotgun... and CUT.
text: Until he reaches his trailer.
scene_heading: INT. STAR WAGON TRAILER - EARLY EVENING
text: Door opens. Light switch. Otis enters his plushy trailer.
text: Fruit basket. Chandelier. It looks neat.
text: Otis is a mess.
text: He is still in his body harness. He puts his fingers in his
dialog: mouth to calm himself the way we learn later he did when he
text: was a kid. Like a pacifier.
text: He sits back but his back gets pinched by the harness. He
text: jumps forward and reaches for the back strap.
text: He can't get it. He tries again. Nope.
text: He grabs a bottle of water and takes a sip. A breath. Shakes
text: his arms. Leans forward and tries again. He touched it. He
dialog: touched the strap!
text: He stops. New plan.
text: He finds room in the middle of the trailer, bends down starts
text: swaying with his arms around his back, trying to catch the
dialog: strap. Left, Right. Fuck... Almost.
text: He takes a break.
text: Looks for his pack of smokes. Can’t find them. He opens a
text: gift basket and pulls out a BOTTLE OF WHISKEY. He downs a
text: third of the bottle. He opens the fridge, closes it before he
text: looks inside and runs out of the trailer...
text: Our shot remains locked off.
speaker_heading: OTIS (0.S.)
text: ANYBODY GOT A WALKIE! FUCK ME!
text: We see the water in a glass on the table settle. We watch the
text: chair stop spinning. Then we hear Otis run past us the other
text: way. His breathing has quickened. We hear him punch the side
text: of the trailer in frustration. BANG!
speaker_heading: OTIS (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm in this fucking... You fuckers
dialog: lit me on fire and left me ina
dialog: vice!!!
text: He storms back in the trailer and leans forward. Stretches
text: his arms in front of him and slowly brings them around. He
text: starts swaying again. Left and Right. Left and Rightttttt....
dialog: Fuck.
dialog: 3.
text: Otis kicks the stove again. He punches it again and again.
dialog: Beat.
text: Guilt. He tries to fix the bent metal.
text: He sits on the couch and looks at it. He stands up and opens
text: the trailer door. He props the door open and sits on the
text: stairs. He fold his arms. He’s uncomfortable. He stands up
text: walks back in but realizes he got caught on the door. He
text: tries to swing out.
speaker_heading: OTIS (CONT'D)
text: I'M HERE!!! I’M ALONE IN HERE!!!
dialog: AND I CAN'T REACH THE THING-FUCK!!!
text: We see his hand go white as he grips the door rail. He
text: manages to get off the door and goes to the bathroom mirror.
text: He looks down and is about to break. He runs the water and
text: wipes his face, sits on the bed.
text: He rises, walks back to the door and dents it with his fist
text: as we flash to more scenes from the film.
dialog: Otis’s character:
text: - Slammed against a police car over and over again.
text: Screaming.
text: - Wiping a shotgun clean in a blood red lit room.
text: - Fighting or flirting or maybe both, in a bath tub with a
text: beautiful young actress... and CUT.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. STAR WAGON TRAILER - EARLY EVENING
text: Otis enters, leans his forehead on the top drawers.
text: He breathes. For a long, long, long time. His breath purrs
text: like when you’re about to cry. He picks up the Whiskey bottle
text: and downs half of it.
text: He feels inspired.
text: If he rotates his shoulder counter-clockwise, over his hip
dialog: and can get the weight off his right leg... The bed.
text: He lays in the bed and reaches behind for the strap while
text: pushing his foot onto the wall of the trailer for leverage
text: and leaning on the edge of the bed wedged in the passageway
text: of the trailer. He pushes... He rotates His body and sits up
text: with a red face...
dialog: Knock knock.
text: His co-star SANDRA (20'S) enters the room.
dialog: She's perceptive and kind. You also get the feeling that this
dialog: girl knows everything in the world, in the best way. The
dialog: intelligent way. Good at helping others way.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Ready?
text: She sees him. He’s struggling on the couch out of breath.
text: She walks over and in one casual movement releases him.
dialog: He’s free.
text: She leans right in for a kiss. It’s fire.
text: He falls back with her on the bed and they open a new cycle
text: of breathing and pushing around the room. He tries to get her
text: out of her shirt. She tries to get him out of his... Somehow
text: despite all the passion involved it looks like the harness
dialog: battle.
scene_heading: INT. CHEVY SILVERADO - STREET - NIGHT
dialog: HONK HONK!
text: Close on Sandra’s hand pushing the horn as Otis drives.
text: Come up to find them in the car. Otis in the driver’s seat.
text: They're passing an EXTRA SMOKEY BLUNT. It’s thick. Her legs
text: are on the dashboard.
text: They are now passing back a lit half cigarette. Otis drops
text: it. He steers with his knees as he looks down to find the
dialog: smoke.
speaker_heading: BANG.
text: RAMP SPEED: A Toyota Tacoma hits the breaks hard just as it
text: makes a FULL IMPACT at 70 mph, causing the front end to go
text: low. This shovels the truck, sending it up and over.
text: Everything goes silent.
dialog: 5.
text: The whole world turns upside down. Otis holds onto the window
text: frame and Sandra as they corkscrew through the intersection.
text: One flip. Two flips. Three flip. IMAPCT.
dialog: Airbags.
text: UPSIDE DOWN - Otis is barely conscious. He looks at his hand.
text: The TWO FINGERS he always puts in his mouth are covered in
dialog: blood.
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT
text: Otis gets bumped against a police car while being arrested,
text: except this time it’s real life. He struggles and fights but

scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT
text: Otis is arrested in the back seat.
text: Otis is screaming at the cops behind the steel mash cage.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: You think you’re fuckin’ hot shit?
dialog: Cause you doooooon’t know how good
dialog: I am at what I do!
text: They ignore him.
scene_heading: INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
text: Total darkness. Otis is terrified.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Why am I here? Come on! Answer the
dialog: question you dumb fuck! Why am I
dialog: hear? Answer the question!
scene_heading: INT. CAR - THE NEXT DAY
text: Otis’s mom LINDA is driving.
text: He stares out the window, his face cut in several places.
text: He’s wearing a hoodie and baseball cap and can’t bring
text: himself to look at her.
scene_heading: INT. REHAB WATSONVILLE - COMMON AREA - SUNSET
text: Beautiful light from every window.
text: Otis is terrified.
text: He’s asked to take his shoes off. People mill about the house
text: in pajamas. Holding board games and staring at him.
text: A black man is knitting a scarf. They exchange looks.
text: We follow Otis and the R.S. upstairs and through a hallway.
text: We walk through the door to a medical examination room.
scene_heading: INT. REHAB - EXAMINATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: A locked MEDS CABINET.
text: Otis strips behind a curtain and hands his clothes to the
text: R.S. He gets searched and they take his phone and his bags.
text: After the clothes are looked through he is handed them back.
scene_heading: INT. REHAB - TREATMENT OFFICE - DAY
text: There is big mural of a forest. A small cactus on a little
text: table. A white board with twelve names, small colored dots
text: next to each name, with weekly numbers of the S.U.D.S
dialog: (Subjective Units of Distress Scale), and treatment profiles.
text: Otis sits in a swivel chair.
text: DR. MORENO (late 40’s), small woman with a no bullshit
text: presence, adds his name on the board and goes back to her
text: chair. She tries to sit but her back is not making it easy.
speaker_heading: DR. MORENO
dialog: There are no guards on the premise
dialog: Otis.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: I noticed.
speaker_heading: DR. MORENO
dialog: But since this is your third
dialog: drunken altercation with the
dialog: police, if you leave we have to
dialog: notify the judge and you’1l serve
dialog: those four years... That’s the
dialog: deal.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: DR. MORENO
dialog: So where do we start?
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: I don’t know boss. You tell me. I’m
dialog: obviously not equipped to make any
dialog: decisions... I’m an ego maniac with
dialog: an inferiority complex...
speaker_heading: DR. MORENO
dialog: Let’s try again.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: How about? I’m a professional
dialog: schizophrenic... What do you want
dialog: me to say? I’m a piece of shit.
text: Dr. Moreno looks at him for a minute.
text: Otis’s eyes are terrified and his body is wired.
text: She turns around on her chair. It’s painful. She pulls out a
text: NOTEBOOK from a stack. She hands it to Otis.
speaker_heading: DR. MORENO
dialog: I want you to write an account of
dialog: your memories so we can get you
dialog: started with imaginal exposure.
speaker_heading: oTis
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: DR. MORENO
dialog: It’s a simple way to stop avoiding
dialog: trauma reminders that get you
dialog: triggered.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: I avoid trauma reminders?? My whole
dialog: job is motivated by trauma
dialog: reminders. It’s a requirement.
speaker_heading: DR. MORENO
dialog: We're not talking about you using
dialog: trauma for your work. I’m talking
dialog: about triggers that make your
dialog: distress levels unmanageable and
dialog: result in violence.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: DR. MORENO
dialog: Whatever makes you angry is usually
dialog: a good place to start.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: DR. MORENO (CONT'D)
dialog: Otis, I have been doing this for a
dialog: long time... I saw your tests and
dialog: you have clear signs of P.T.S.D.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: No I don’t... From what??
text: We hold on his face and cut to title: HONEY BOY
scene_heading: FLASHBACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY - SOMETIME IN THE PAST
text: YOUNG OTIS LORT (12) peering into the camera.
text: He stares for a while. He’s once again laser focused and fine-
text: tuned like an owl statue. He runs his tiny hand through his
text: bowl cut and looks to the lens with an adamant, striven for
dialog: smile when...
text: A WHIP CREAM PIE SMASHES into his face.
text: ON IMPACT - RAMP SPEED: His hardly anything body is ratcheted
text: out of focus into the air.
text: SLOW MOTION: Otis flying in the air until -
text: Normal Speed - He hangs in the air held by a wire. In front
text: of a white picket fence.
text: The form of a Stunt Coordinator arrives. He helps Otis down,
text: gives him a weary high five, and begins to walk him right
text: back to center to do it all over again.
text: 2ND A.C. enters frame with the slate.
dialog: Frame up on the slate: 1995
text: TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. RALEIGH STUDIOS - LATE AFTERNOON
text: FADE IN: We’re over Otis's shoulder, walking stiffly ina
text: body harness out of a dark soundstage on the lot. He picks up
text: his Disc-Man that he left behind. Play.
text: Adult figures surround him in silhouette.
speaker_heading: MAKE-UP LADY (0.C.)
dialog: Otis.
text: She grabs him and quickly wipes his face from all the pie
text: left overs. He keeps walking.
text: Two people walk behind him carrying a beautiful sky matte
text: painting. They pass to reveal -
text: JAMES LORT (35), in-artfully wearing a BANDANA on his head to
text: cover his pronounced balding. He figures more hair is more
dialog: hair = thick sideburns. His vest tells you he is in the
dialog: Combat Vets MC, Desert Storm.
text: He pitches casually to the Crafty woman, PAM. A fairly
text: attractive, straight-laced woman circa his age. She’s got no
dialog: choice but to listen.
text: Otis arrives mid-conversation.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I had a chicken named Henrietta
dialog: Lafowl.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Henrietta Lafowl?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: World's first daredevil chicken.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Dad, can you loosen the back part?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: One sec pal... So I’d come out, put
text: her on my head and do cartwheels.
dialog: Henrietta’d run from my head to my
dialog: butt, from my head to my butt...
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Oh wow.
text: Otis tries to get out of his harness. No luck.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Yes, ma'am. Spent a lot of time
dialog: with chickens... Rodeo. Lot of
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: I can imagine.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Dad, I can’t...
text: James reluctantly starts unbuckling his son's harness while
text: continuing his story. Pam is watching them both.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: ...Used to put her on my head, top
dialog: of my hat. I’d run an electrical
dialog: wire down my sleeve to her...
dialog: Couldn't see it. I'd go and put a
text: K.F.C. bucket on the floor, light
dialog: the rim on fire for drama... and
dialog: when I’d hit that electrical
dialog: charge, Henrietta’d fly off’a my
dialog: head and land right there in the
dialog: center of that bucket. Hey-O!
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Crowd ate it up. I once opened for
dialog: the Stevie Nicks at the Forum.....
text: James is not looking at what he is doing. Otis feels a PINCH.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Oww... Fuck, Dad.
text: Pam reacts to the curse word. James tracks that. Gives Otis a
text: “Leave It To Beaver” disciplinary slap on the hand.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Hey. What did we say about talking
dialog: like that?
text: They share a knowing look.
dialog: Otis doesn't wanna cock-block. He plays up his innocence. Dad
text: plays up his caring father. They perform together. What
dialog: better practice for a young actor.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: That we... That I’m not supposed to
dialog: talk like that.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Apologize to Pam.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: I'm very sorry Pam.
text: Pam tries to be nice about it.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: That’s okay.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Go hang up your wardrobe and thank
dialog: Donna for the day. You had a good
dialog: day otherwise.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Yes, Daddy.
text: James is wearing his proud father face as he watches Otis
text: head off. He then pivots instantaneously to chasing pussy
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: So yea... Spent a lot time with
dialog: Chickens... In all that time you
dialog: know what I learned about
dialog: chickens... You know what’s that
text: white spot is in the center of
dialog: chicken poop?
dialog: Pam, whose never given as much of a shit about shit prior to
text: this, is trying to care.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: That’s chicken poop also. Hey-o!
dialog: Got you.
text: James laughs shamelessly at his own joke. It’s the kind of
text: laughter that separates a clown from the crowd.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey you got a phone number?
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Can I get it from you?
text: He senses her hesitation.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: Later? Maybe tomorrow?
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Have a good day.
text: He walks out.
scene_heading: EXT. RALEIGH PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON
text: James guns the bike. Otis jumps in the back. Crew members
text: hanging out while eying James.
dialog: Otis knows what they’re thinking. We stay behind.
scene_heading: EXT. BUSY BOULEVARD - SUNSET - CONTINUOUS
text: A Burgundy Honda Shadow 1200, flies down the junction outside
text: the parking lot, causing two cars to halt and nearly causing
text: an accident. Daily commuter at the helm is James. Bandanna on
text: his face now in a half shell helmet, cleaving lanes with
dialog: confidence.
text: His passenger Otis, in a Vespa helmet and a Jan-sport, tucks
text: his father’s hair into the back of his coat and hugs him from
dialog: behind.
dialog: In this town, you discern people best by how they maneuver
text: the road. James looks over his shoulder and gets between two
text: driving lanes cutting off everyone in sight. He turns left in
text: the junction and causes a car in the coming lane to halt.
text: Otis hand surfs the wind to flip the driver off.
text: CLOSE ON: Otis holding for dear life and enjoying the
text: closeness. This is the closest thing to a hug he knows.
text: Asshole. James downshifts, guns the yellow and expertly
text: slides into his parking spot at THE VISTA MOTEL: A parking
text: lot with twenty-five rooms and a swimming pool.
scene_heading: INT. VISTA MOTEL - POOL - EARLY EVENING
text: Otis jumps into the motel pool. He dips under then surfaces
text: and takes a moment to himself.
scene_heading: INT. VISTA MOTEL - BEDROOM
text: Otis sits by a little desk tucked in between the restroom
text: door and the window. He’s reviewing the next day’s lines.
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: EXT. VISTA MOTEL - PARKING LOT
text: Across the parking lot a young prostitute is coming back from
text: a long night. Otis watches her. This is LITTLE Q, a queen in
text: a T-shirt. You’d guess thirties and be wrong. She’s barely
text: 18. She’s not as beautiful so much as she is fascinating. The
text: whites of her eyes are neon white and soulful. She leans in
dialog: when you talk. That type.
text: Her pimp, MAMA DJ, pulls up. She gets out of her car and
text: walks over to her.
speaker_heading: MAMA DJ
dialog: Who you been talking to? And I told
dialog: you not to wear that top didn’t I?
speaker_heading: LITTLE Q
dialog: I didn’t have anything else
dialog: clean...
scene_heading: INT/EXT. VISTA MOTEL - BEDROOOM / DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: James stands in the doorway with an unlit cigarette between
text: his lips while he watches over his bike.
text: He shouts out to another guest in a laundryroom we can’t see.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Rocco! I’m in there!
dialog: (to Otis)
dialog: Hey give me the call sheet. Got the
dialog: per diem in there.
dialog: (to guest)
dialog: Don’t touch ‘em Rocco, those are my
dialog: socks!
text: Otis hands James a MANILLA ENVELOPE. James takes out the cash
text: inside and counts before yelling back across the lot.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: You can’t give it ten more minutes?
text: James gives up and lights the cigarette.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: They gotta get another washer and
dialog: dryer in this place man, it’s
text: turning into a nightmare.
text: Otis moves to the bathroom. Urinates with the door open.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh no... oh no... hear that baby
dialog: trickle? You got one of them Lil
dialog: Jew rivulets. Oh shit, you can
dialog: thank your mother for that. You got
dialog: a dick like a golf pencil son.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: It’s enough to get the job done.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: What job are you going to get done?
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Girls.
text: Otis washes his hands; zips his fly and heads back to his
dialog: little desk.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Girls? You couldn’t fuck yourself
dialog: with that thing Otis. You probably
dialog: got piss on your balls just now.
dialog: You got wet balls right now?
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: (eye roll)
dialog: I'm twelve.
text: James steps toward the bathroom, takes a piss.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: When I was 12 my dick sounded just
dialog: like this.
text: Only a dribble comes out.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait for it...
dialog: (the stream picks up)
dialog: You hear that? You hear the depth
dialog: of that bowl? That’s roots buddy.
dialog: That’s blood. Where you come from.
dialog: Shit’s important but you don’t give
dialog: a fuck.
text: James exits without washing his hands. On his walk back to
text: the doorway he flicks Otis in the chest who is still reading
text: his script while keeping two fingers in his mouth.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: What I just say?
dialog: 15.
text: James, grabs another smoke and opens the front door, lights
text: his Kool and stares at his bike.
dialog: That hits
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: You hear me? What I just say? You
dialog: don’t listen that’s your problem...
dialog: and you're selfish. I just told you
dialog: about your family and you're over
dialog: there just staring at the thing? I
dialog: see you, you’re concentrating. I
dialog: know it takes a lot of
dialog: concentration to play a twelve-year-
dialog: old. Have a pie fight. I get it...
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: .--It’s not a pie fight.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Oh yeah? What do you got tomorrow?
dialog: I know what it is. It’s clowning,
dialog: poop-butt... with lines; It’s the
dialog: same thing as clowning. It’s rodeo.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: It's not.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: It’s not what? The fuck would you
dialog: know... You never been to a rodeo.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Yeah, I have.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Don’t lie to me. When?... Who took
dialog: you to the rodeo?
speaker_heading: oTis

text: James. He looks back at his bike.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Tom took you to the Rodeo? Of

speaker_heading: OTIS

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: See, you can’t remember. See there.
dialog: They have clowns at your rodeo? You

speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: You went to a fair. You come seen
dialog: me in Muskogee, boy. That’s THE
dialog: rodeo. I’m talkin bout lights.
text: Attractions. Animals. Face-paint.
dialog: Costumes. Commedia del'arte. I made

speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: It’s different... I’m not a clown.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You bet your lil’ dick it’s
dialog: different... It’s all the same too.
dialog: Motherfucker...

dialog: He in there? HEY! Rocco! Didn’t I
dialog: just say? Those are my socks!
dialog: (back to Otis)
dialog: Goddammit give me the call sheet
dialog: and get the bag. This motherfucker.
text: Otis takes a breath, puts his highlighter down and grabs the
text: manila envelope out of the trash. He reaches in and hands a
text: piece of paper to James.
scene_heading: EXT. VISTA MOTEL - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
text: James and Otis walk towards the laundry room. James holding
text: the call sheet, Otis the laundry bag.
speaker_heading: JAMES

text: James reaches for his back pocket and hands Otis some cash.
speaker_heading: JAMES

text: Otis stops in the laundry room doorway and looks back.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
