scene_heading: EXT. SPACE
text: A small planet glows in the light of its sun. Suddenly, we
text: hear a loud rumble, and see a thick, electronic mist behind
text: the planet... Then, the electronic mist begins to engulf the
text: planet, and we hear the horrible sounds of destruction.
text: Almost like somebody, or something, is eating it.
scene_heading: PUSH DOWN TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE NEAR SIDE OF THE PLANET'S SURFACE
text: Strange robotic creatures scramble around the planet in a
text: wild panic. It looks like Pompeii must have looked as
text: Vesuvius erupted.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON ONE OF THE CREATURES - TRACKING
dialog: The creature is KRANIX. We will meet him later on in a very
text: different context, but for now, he is running from the ever-

scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - THE PANIC
text: As Kranix runs, another creature, ARBLUS, calls to him.
speaker_heading: ARBLUS
dialog: Transform and flee, Kranix! You must
dialog: warn all you meet of the horror of
text: Unicron! Suddenly, the pitiful creature
text: is surrounded by the strange energy cloud

text: doused with acid.
speaker_heading: KRANIX
dialog: Arblus! No!
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON KRANIX
text: The mist threatens to engulf him too. He transforms into a
dialog: small rocket ship and...
scene_heading: TRACK WITH KRANIX AS...
text: He takes off. As we rise higher and higher in the atmosphere,
text: we see the horror wrought by the hideous and still mysterious
text: Unicron. The planet cracks like an egg and rivers of lava
text: leak out. The energy cloud surrounds it and... Dissolves
dialog: everything... ... And when the smoke clears, we get our
text: first look at Unicron. It is horrifying. A massive, metal orb
text: with a gaping maw and a field of electricity.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

scene_heading: MOONS ORBITING CYBERTRON IN DEEP SPACE

dialog: metal one.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
text: It is the year 2005. The treacherous
text: Decepticons have conquered the Autobots'
dialog: home planet of Cybertron. But from
dialog: secret staging grounds on two of
text: Cybertron's moons the valiant Autobots
dialog: prepare to retake their homeland.
scene_heading: CLOSER ON GREEN MOON
text: At first, we see nothing unusual or suspicious. Then,
text: pulling closer, we see that the top of the moon is covered
text: with moon camouflage "netting" and underneath it is a huge
text: cache of futuristic weapons. This is the Autobot staging
text: ground for an assault on Cybertron. DOLLY THROUGH THE COMPLEX
text: until we arrive at a Command Center where several Autobots
text: peer into monitors, running constant surveillance on
dialog: Cybertron.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON IRONHIDE
text: He peers into a monitor. As he speaks, we see the monitor
text: PAN to an area where a huge Decepticon Symbol is emblazoned
dialog: on Cybertron.
speaker_heading: IRONHIDE
dialog: Every time I look into this thing, my
dialog: circuits sizzle. I'm tired of this

scene_heading: ANGLE ON OPTIMUS PRIME
text: He stands over a holographic map which shows various invasion
dialog: plans for Cybertron.
speaker_heading: OPTIMUS PRIME
dialog: We still don't have enough Energon cubes
text: to power a full scale assault, Ironhide.
speaker_heading: IRONHIDE
dialog: Then let me make another run to Autobot

speaker_heading: JAZZ (V.O.)
dialog: Jazz to Moon Base 2.

speaker_heading: SPIKE

dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: As it takes off, we realize this isn't any dinky shuttle, but
text: a massive ship, capable of carrying all the energon needed
text: to fight a war and an army to boot. The screen is bathed in

speaker_heading: ANGLE ON PRIME
text: As he watches the shuttle shoot into the distance.
speaker_heading: PRIME
dialog: Now, all we need is a little Energon and
dialog: a lot of luck.
scene_heading: ANGLE BEHIND PRIME

scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - LATER

text: and the two Autobots are thrown from their seats.
speaker_heading: PROWL
dialog: You were saying?
speaker_heading: IRONHIDE (IRKED)
dialog: That wasn't an asteroid. There is a blast
text: of light and they turn to see...
dialog: 6.
text: ANGLE ON THE SHIP
dialog: The most powerful laser light anybody has ever seen cuts a
text: gaping hole in the side of the ship... Then, when the light
text: clears, a panel of the ship falls in and we see -
speaker_heading: MEGATRON!
text: In all his glory.
speaker_heading: MEGATRON
dialog: Die Autobots!
text: Then, he transforms to Gun Mode, spins into STARSCREAM'S arms

scene_heading: ON STARSCREAM AND MEGATRON
text: As they enter the now empty ship, a number of Decepticons
text: flood past them, taking positions and searching for other
dialog: living Autobots.
speaker_heading: MEGATRON
dialog: This was almost too easy, Starscream.
speaker_heading: STARSCREAM
dialog: Much easier, oh mighty Megatron, than
text: attacking the real threat: the Autobots
dialog: moon base.
speaker_heading: MEGATRON
dialog: You're an idiot, Starscream. Were we
dialog: simply to wipe out that minuscule base,

speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MEGATRON (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: IRONHIDE
dialog: Fat chance, Megatron!

speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Let's watch Ironhide land it, Hot Rod! As

dialog: hillside we change angle to feature...
speaker_heading: HOT ROD

scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - ON AUTOBOT CITY
text: FOLLOW Hot Rod up and over a roadway leading around the
text: perimeter of Autobot City which becomes visible the instant
text: Hot Rod clears the rim of a hill. As they travel, we SHOULD
text: also be getting a sense of what Autobot City is all about.
text: (DESIGN NOTE: Autobot City looks like a federal energy
text: project gone mad. Here, the Autobots are trying to exploit
text: every known means of getting energy. The mountain is covered
text: with solar panels, windmills spin in the valley, oil derricks
text: pump, and not far away a hydroelectric dam catches millions
text: of volts. Near all of these various things are energon
text: compressors, which turn the raw energy into energon cubes. IN
dialog: THE BACKGROUND of these scenes, we should see various panel
text: truck-type Autobots cruise up in auto mode to stacks of this
text: energon, convert to humanoid mode, load up their vans, then
text: convert to Auto mode again and drive the Energon into Autobot
dialog: City. In short, it should be clear that the purpose of
text: Autobot City is to harvest energy. All the while, Hot Rod and
text: Daniel are riding recklessly out from the Autobot City and up
dialog: into neighboring hills for an overview of the -
scene_heading: CIRCULAR LANDING AREA
