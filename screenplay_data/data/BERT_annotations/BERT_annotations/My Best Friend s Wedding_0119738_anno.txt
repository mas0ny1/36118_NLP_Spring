scene_heading: --------------------------------------------------------------
scene_heading: INT. BOULEY RESTAURANT, NEW YORK - NIGHT
text: Dim lighting, crowd buzz, a long line of the rich, the celebrated,
text: the congenitally impatient. Everyone in this queue holds a
dialog: reservation at least an hour overdue. Tourists can't even make the
dialog: line. PAN ahead to...
dialog: ... the burnished dining room, the tables of power, the elegant
text: service. Covertly, many eyes are drawn to the one table receiving
text: by far the most lavish service of all. Captains hover, presenting
text: delicacies, pouring wines, murmuring obsequiously to a guest whose
dialog: person they screen from our view. We can see, however...
text: ... the honored guest's companion. Ignored, bemused, across the
text: table. This is DIGGER DOWNES, 36, darkly attractive. Kind eyes,
dialog: an intellectual's mouth, Saville Row's most unobtrusive and
dialog: conservative chalk-stripe suit. He is gay, but you wouldn't guess
dialog: it. Loyal and wise and generous, and you might. He watches with a
text: quiet twinkle, as the Captains now step back, revealing to us...
text: ... their most unlikely icon. JULIANNE POTTER, almost 28, wears
text: her favorite bulky sweater over a bunch of other stuff she pulled
text: together in fifteen seconds. She is unkempt, quick, volatile,
text: scattered, and beneath it all, perhaps because of it all, an
text: original beauty. Dark liquid eyes, a cynical mouth, slender
dialog: expressive fingers, which point to...
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: A variation on our squid ink
dialog: risotto. Trace of Moselle, to
dialog: sweeten the stock.
text: She doesn't like that idea at all. Shoots him a sharp look of
text: doubt that makes him smile. Murmur...
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Don't kill us on this one, it's
dialog: a long shot.
text: Places the moist lump of black rice before her. She takes a
text: surprisingly small amount, rolls it over her tongue. Makes dead
text: flat eye contact with Digger. And nods, it's actually quite nice.
text: The Captain breathes with relief. She turns her dark eyes to him.
dialog: The tone says they're pals...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'm writing it up as inventive and
dialog: confident. Which it is. Off the
dialog: record, I'll need an extra boat of
dialog: the ink. Or a salt shaker.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: I'll toss a coin.
text: As the Captain splits, Digger looks around at the other tables,
text: which makes many pairs of eyes awkwardly glace away.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Is it ever embarrassing, having
dialog: your bum kissed in public?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: If your ass isn't chapped, you
dialog: are not a good-writer of note.
text: She glances at her two remaining waiters, who shamelessly fawn
dialog: nearby.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Is it sad to be an editor, and bask
dialog: only in reflected insincerity?
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
text: She leans forward, as if sharing something conspiratorial.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: See the pull of a book like
dialog: Twenty Chefs, is not who I
dialog: put in. It's who I leave out.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Which is everyone you couldn't
dialog: get in.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Plus some guys whose food I don't
dialog: like.
text: Pushes the risotte across to him. He lifts a fork.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: This fellow from Newsday ever
dialog: call?
text: She shrugs. Pulls a cellular out of a large, jumbled bag.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'll buzz my machine. Inventive
dialog: and confident, yeh?
text: She dials. He tastes.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Needs salt.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Is Newsday a real interview, or
dialog: just some cute guy you're setting
dialog: me up w...
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: ... I don't send you men, anymore.
dialog: You don't know what to do with them.
text: She's punching in her code.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Sometimes I do. Like for two months.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: ... weeks.
text: Over the phone, we hear her answering machine...
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (V.O., soft)
dialog: Hey. It's Michael.
text: And her face changes. Warms. Just to hear the guileless voice.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O.)
dialog: God, it must be, what, months, huh?
dialog: I can't wait to talk to you. I'm
dialog: in Chicago at the Ritz Carlton...
text: She looks impressed and surprised. Fancy place for this guy.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O.)
dialog: Call me four in the morning,
dialog: whatever, we gotta talk.
text: As she hangs up. She still has that look in her eye. Digger has
dialog: never seen that, and he likes it very much.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Who called? The man of the
dialog: moment?
text: She smiles. A sweet, natural smile that makes us like her, too.
text: The Bohemian sophisticate has vanished.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: No, no, the opposite. That's
dialog: my best friend, Michael O'Neal.
text: He sounds desperate to talk.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: The wandering sportswriter.
text: He pushes the risotto back her way.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: I didn't know you two had a
dialog: past.
dialog: Her gaze sharpens. Hmmn?
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: The look in your eye.
text: She blushes. Shakes her head, no way.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Sophomore year at Yale we had
dialog: this one hot month. And, you
dialog: know me, I got restless...
dialog: He knows her. She got restless.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: So I get up the nerve to break
dialog: his heart. I tell him there's
dialog: this dreamy exchange student
dialog: from Pakistan who wants to,
dialog: you know...
dialog: He knows.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: And he gets this... look. He
dialog: says, "I knew I couldn't hold
dialog: your interest", which, of course,
dialog: makes me feel like the shallow
dialog: bitch I've always been...
dialog: He nods, yeah.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Then he says, "But what makes
dialog: me want to cry. Is I'm losing
dialog: the best friend I ever had."
text: Hears the feeling. In her voice.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: And when he said it, I knew.
dialog: I felt the same.
text: Silence now. She covers with a smile.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: So I cried. For maybe the third
dialog: time in my life. And I kissed
dialog: him. And we've been best friends
dialog: ever since.
text: Ever since. Fingers turning her wine glass...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Nine years, we've seen each other
dialog: through everything. Losing jobs,
dialog: losing parents, losing lovers...
dialog: travelled all over, we've had the
dialog: best times. The best times of my
dialog: life, maybe. Just drinking and
text: talking. Even over a phone.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Kindred spirits.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: No, he's nothing like me. He's
dialog: like you. Only straight.
dialog: No offense taken.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: He's the salt of the earth. Kind
dialog: and loyal and generous. The one
dialog: constant thing in my life, is he'll
dialog: always be there.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: He's still in love with you.
dialog: That stops her. She has to say...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Maybe. But it never gets in
dialog: the way.
text: Something she probably hasn't confessed out loud before. Digger
dialog: understands.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Well, he has a true friend in
dialog: you.
dialog: He wants her to know he sees that.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Whenever George tells someone
dialog: how steadfast I am, he always
dialog: makes me sound boring.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Solid and genuine is not boring.
dialog: Michael can be completely insane...
text: A young waiter arrives. Sets a boat of black squid ink beside her
dialog: plate.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: There was this one night in
dialog: Tucson, like six years ago...
dialog: we got amazingly drunk, I mean,
dialog: Keith Richards time...
text: The kid tops off her glass of meursault. Looking at her.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: God, I haven't thought of this
dialog: in so long...
text: The waiter hanging now. Openly listening.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I can even believe we did
dialog: this...
text: Digger sees the guy listening, gestures to her with his eyes. So
text: she looks up.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Could you give us a minute?
text: The kid stunned, speechless. People lose jobs for a lot less.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You won't miss much, I promise
dialog: there was no sex.
text: He reddens and disappears.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: I've lost interest.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
text: He takes a razor from his dinky
text: little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip,
dialog: takes my hand, does the same to me...
text: She places the tips of her index fingers together.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Blood oath.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: He says, "Swear. When we're both
dialog: 28, if we've never been married...
dialog: we marry each other!"
dialog: And laughs again. Can you believe that? But Digger isn't smiling.
text: She wonders why. Begins to spoon black squid ink onto her risotto.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: See, he figured that would be a
dialog: sign from God, or someone of
dialog: comparable authority, that we'd
dialog: misunderstood our destinies.
text: He still has this real serious look. She's still spooning ink.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: We never talked about it again. I
dialog: don't know what made me think of...
speaker_heading: DIGGER (quietly)
dialog: I do.
text: And everything. Stops. She lifts her spoon, mesmerized by the
dialog: gravity of his tone.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: You'll be 28 in three weeks.
dialog: How old is he?
text: Holy. Fucking. Shit. It hits her like a ton of lead bricks. She
text: shovels some swampy risotto into her mouth, without looking.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You think...
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Desperate. To talk.
text: She shovels in more drippy black goop. It is really disgusting.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: He's not proposing marriage,
dialog: there's no way I'm buying one
dialog: word of th...
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Then why are you compulsively
dialog: eating? If you're not hysterical?
text: More goes in. Her lips and mouth completely black. Like a circus
dialog: clown.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: He can't do that to me!
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: We're about to find out.
text: Ink is now dribbling out of the black hole of her mouth and down
text: her face. She absently dabs a napkin, keeping some of it from
text: reaching her sweater.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: When I turn him down...
text: She realizes the full weight of the truth.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: We'll never be the same.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: I have a suggestion...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'll have to kill myself before I
dialog: call him.
text: Staring in each other's eyes.
speaker_heading: DIGGER (sadly)
dialog: That was it.
scene_heading: INT. JULIANNE'S BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT
text: Julianne furiously scrubs her blackened tongue with a toothbrush.
text: Gray foam pours from her mouth, spattering the oversized basketball
text: jersey she wears as a nightshirt. In the mirror, her troubled eyes
text: dwell on Michael, flick to the cordless phone standing ominously on
text: the closed toilet lid.
text: She spits, sticks her tongue way out. Incredibly black. Great.
text: Depressed, terrified, and disfigured for life. She snatches up the
text: hated phone, and wanders aimlessly into...
text: ... her bedroom. West Village view. Defiantly jumbled, aggres-
dialog: sively eclectic. Traces of wonderful taste mixed with I-like-it-
dialog: you-got-a-problem-with-that? She stumbles around, rehearsing...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: This is awkward timing, Michael,
dialog: I just joined this convent, and
dialog: they never give your deposit ba...
text: Stops. Full-length mirror. She straightens her hair, to look her
dialog: best.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Michael, I'm married.
dialog: Not enough.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... and I have two weeks to live.
dialog: Changes tone...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Michael, I'm trying to be gay,
dialog: don't confuse me.
text: She turns to continue pacing, and walks straight INTO a dresser.
dialog: Stuns her, momentarily. Enough, already! She punches up the
text: number, primping absently in the mirror. When it connects...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I was calling Michael O'Neal,
dialog: but seeing it's so late, I could
dialog: just leave a mes...
dialog: No such luck. Cut off. Waits. And then...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (soft)
dialog: Good evening, sir. You've been
dialog: enrolled in the Obscene Call Of
dialog: The Month Club, and th...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O.)
dialog: Hey! God, it's so good to hear
dialog: your voice.
text: She forgets herself. Because it's good to hear his, too.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O.)
dialog: I've been calling for days!
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Yeh, well my old machine kept
dialog: eating messages. I tried
dialog: constructively ignoring it in
dialog: hopes of improvement, but finally...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O., urgent)
dialog: Look, I have to ask you something.
text: She swallows.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O.)
dialog: Something so incredibly important,
dialog: that if you turn me down, I don't
dialog: know what I'll d...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (bright)
dialog: I just have to tell you this one
dialog: thing first, okay? I mean this
dialog: will hand you the biggest laugh
dialog: of your adult life...
dialog: Silence. Come on girl, suck it up.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I was thinking about you, and I
dialog: remembered this unbelievably insane
dialog: night we spent together in Tucson,
dialog: like a thousand years ago?
text: More silence. Really quiet.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I mean, there's no way you could
dialog: possibly remember the...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O., soft)
dialog: Are you kidding?
text: Stops her. Like a brick wall. The sweetness in his voice.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O.)
dialog: I think about that night all
dialog: the time.
text: She's going to have a heart attack.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O.)
dialog: But it's not why I called.
text: She blinks. It's not. And just as a tsunami of relief begins to
dialog: sweep away...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O.)
dialog: I called because I met someone.
text: And her smiles breaks off. Like a spine snapping. Because there is
text: something in his voice.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Well, that's great. You haven't
dialog: really had anybody since Dingbat
dialog: Jennylee...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O.)
dialog: You don't understand. I've never
dialog: felt this way about anybody!
text: Never. She sits down, hard. Right on the floor.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O.)
dialog: And she's all wrong for me!
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Well, somet...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O.)
dialog: I mean she's a junior at Chicago
dialog: University, she's twenty years
dialog: old! Like when I first met you.
text: Like when. Julianne's mouth is suddenly dry.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O.)
dialog: And her dad is like this billionaire
dialog: who owns the White Sox and some cable
dialog: empire, and you know how I've always
dialog: been miserably awkward around those
dialog: kinda stuffed suits...
text: She's finally making her mouth work...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Well, sure.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O.)
dialog: But they're so down to earth, such
dialog: wonderful people...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You've met her parents.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O., quiet)
dialog: Well. Sure.
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O.)
dialog: See. We're getting married.
dialog: This Sunday.
text: There's a knife in her heart. She can scarcely breathe.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Michael, it's Wednesday night,
dialog: you can't possibly be getting
dialog: married on Su...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O.)
dialog: Actually, it all starts tomorrow.
dialog: It's one of those four-day weddings,
dialog: with all the traditional events, and
dialog: ten million people flying in from
dialog: Madagascar such.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (incredibly lame)
dialog: Aren't you... working this weekend?
dialog: I mean, is that responsible?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O.)
dialog: Well, the Sox are at home. SI's
dialog: letting me do a profile on the Big
dialog: Hurt. That's Frank...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (barely audible)
dialog: ... Thomas, yeh.
text: She's staring at herself in the mirror.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O.)
dialog: Jules. I'm scared.
text: A straw to lunge at.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Well, maybe we should talk ab...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O.)
dialog: I need you.
text: So heartfelt. A lifetime of emotion welling in her eyes.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O.)
dialog: If you can't come. And hold my
dialog: hand. I'll never get through this.
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O.)
dialog: Please come, please.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: W...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (V.O.)
dialog: I can't wait for you to meet her!
text: HOLD ON Julianne. Staring in the mirror. Like watching the end of
dialog: her life.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - LATER
text: The closet, the armoire, all the drawers are wide open. Two huge
text: suitcases open on the bed, into which Julianne is flinging clothes,
text: as she fumbles to smoke and dial at the same time. Over the phone,
dialog: now...
speaker_heading: DIGGER (V.O., machine)
dialog: You've reached Digger and George.
dialog: Brevity will be appreciated.
speaker_heading: BEEP.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (in a rage)
dialog: IT'S ME AGAIN, WHY AREN'T YOU GUYS
dialog: UP HAVING SAFE SEX??
text: SNATCHES up a tiny, clingy, sexy dress. Pouts at it.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, WHY AREN'T
dialog: YOU INTERRUPTING IT TO ANSWER
speaker_heading: THE PHONE??
text: She holds the dress against her body. It's hot.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: YOU, YOU, YOU! IT'S ALL ABOUT
dialog: YOU, ISN'T IT??
text: She clicks OFF. Checks the dress in the mirror. Raises the short
dialog: skirt a little higher.
scene_heading: INT. DIGGER'S CHEROKEE, JFK AIRPORT - EARLY MORNING
text: Digger driving the open-air Cherokee up the ramp to United Airlines
text: departures. Julianne, wind-whipped, trying to light a fresh
text: cigarette from the butt of the last one. He glances over. Hates
dialog: to see this...
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: You can't get lung cancer and
dialog: die in four days. Go to Plan B.
dialog: She sucks deep. Really deep.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You have no appropriate sense
dialog: of emergency. My best friend
text: is ruining his life.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: No, he's ruining yours.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Same difference. If you love
dialog: someone, it's your duty to save
dialog: them from themselves.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: You have a real philosophy of
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: It's called the Law of Love,
dialog: asshole.
text: She is tight enough to snap. And at the edge of tears. Staring
text: out at the skycaps, clinging to her cigarette, as he eases to the
dialog: curb.
speaker_heading: DIGGER (gently)
dialog: Why don't we have a drink? You
dialog: could catch a later fl...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'm a busy girl. I've got four
dialog: days to break up a wedding, and
dialog: steal the bride's fella.
text: She finally looks at him. He doesn't say anything.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: He's adored me for nine goddamn
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: I can see why.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: She knows him maybe five seconds,
dialog: plus she has billions of dollars,
dialog: plus she's perfect, so don't go
dialog: feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!
text: He's not. So her voice softens. Which shows the hurt.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: And don't go feeling sorry for
dialog: me, you don't know me that well.
dialog: We're only friends.
speaker_heading: DIGGER (softly)
dialog: I stand corrected.
text: Tears now. Stand in her eyes.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'm making a big mistake, huh?
speaker_heading: DIGGER (shrugs)
dialog: Maybe you'll learn something.
text: He wraps his hand over hers. She looks down at it.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'm gonna bring him back, man.
dialog: Against all odds, y'know. Cos
dialog: if I don't...
text: She wraps her fingers around his.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... I gotta live with it forever.
text: Looks in his eyes.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: And at my wedding. I'll be the
text: only bride with her own best man.
text: And she kisses his cheek.
text: Jumps out of his car. Before she cries. Yanks her bags from the
dialog: back. Brave smile.
text: They trade small salutes. And then she's gone.
scene_heading: INT. O'HARA AIRPORT, CHICAGO - MORNING
text: The jetway disgorging passengers into the swarming ant colony
text: called O'Hare. Julianne lugging multiple carry-ons, trying to pull
text: fly-away strands of hair into place, nervous as a schoolgirl,
dialog: looking all around, and...
text: ... there he is. MICHAEL is tall and square-shouldered, a boyish
text: grin, an unruly shock of hair. He looks gorgeous, sweet, and just
text: dangerous enough to be irresistible. Worthwhile stakes. His face
dialog: lights to see her, and she...
text: ... RUNS to his arms, shedding bags along the way, slamming off
dialog: heedless civilians, to be...
text: ... SWEPT OFF the earth in strong arms, spun around, laughing like
text: crazy, their cheeks tight together. When he sets her down...
text: ... he kisses her nose. His arms are still around her.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (murmurs)
dialog: Can you believe it? Can you believe
dialog: I'm actually gonna do this?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (lost in his eyes)
dialog: Not hardly.
text: He beams. Turns. She follows his gaze, and...
text: ... there she is. KIMBERLY WALLACE is 20, small and slender, but it
text: is a body to die for. The face is striking, not at all perky and
dialog: vapid, but lovely and interesting. Worst of all, intelligent.
text: She walks toward them purposefully, her eyes locked to the woman in
text: her fiancee's arms. At the last moment, Michael releases Julianne
dialog: and Kimmy...
text: ... THROWS her arms around the startled visitor. HOLDS her tight,
text: with such genuine warmth that Julianne can only, slowly, hug back.
text: As Michael beams.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: This just makes everything so
dialog: perfect.
text: Her arms stay around the slightly dazed Julianne. The younger
text: girl leans close, confides...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: All I've heard, from the day I
dialog: met Michael, is Julianne this,
dialog: and Julianne that...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Well, we're...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: I think the best part of marrying
dialog: this guy is finding you.
text: Pale gray eyes. Alive with joy and intimacy.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: I've never had a sister.
scene_heading: INT. KIMMY'S CONVERTIBLE - DAY
text: Kimmy TEARING down the throughway in her Mercedes 500 SL, a
text: dashing, confident driver. Julianne riding shotgun, hair flying, a
text: total wreck, in the open convertible. Michael is happily crouched
text: on the little platform behind their seats, hugging his knees. The
text: roar of the wind makes it impossible for him to hear them.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: My heart's in my throat, here.
dialog: Right off, I have to ask this
dialog: monstrous favor...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You need a few dollars.
text: Kim glances over. At eighty miles an hour. A bittersweet look.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Dry. Just like he said.
text: Her eyes at once admiring and regretful.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: I can be quick. I can even
dialog: be funny.
text: Shakes her head. An endearing youngster.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: But I can't be dry.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Can you watch the road?
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: See. Dry. It's in the delivery.
text: She looks back to the highway.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: This is a very presumptuous
dialog: and burdensome fav...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... you want a menage on your
dialog: wedding night.
speaker_heading: KIMMY (straight back)
dialog: No, that wouldn't be burdensome.
text: Julianne studying the delicate, angular profile. Hard not to like
dialog: this kid.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: My classmate Angelique shattered
dialog: her pelvis line dancing in
dialog: Abeline on Spring Break.
text: Looks over. The sweetest smile.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Be my maid of honor.
text: Julianne just blinks.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: You can't believe what it'd
dialog: cost to bring in a temp.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Uh. How about promoting a
dialog: bridesmaid? Someone you know
dialog: for at least forty-five minutes.
text: We CUT OFF a huge SEMI who BLASTS his horn. Kimmy fearless,
dialog: oblivious, and analytical...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: The bridesmaids are my only two
dialog: female relatives under forty.
dialog: Identical twin debutantes from
dialog: Nashville, who are basically
dialog: vengeful sluts. With amazing
dialog: bodies!
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Which was the disqualifying
dialog: factor?
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: The twin part. I like to remain
dialog: impartial in my contempt.
text: Sees the off-ramp, and SLICES across FOUR LANES of speeding bullets
dialog: in a heart-stopping nanosecond. This kid could drive for Penske.
text: Julianne has to pound her chest to get her heart started. Looks
dialog: back to see if Michael fell out...
text: ... he is absurdly wind-blown. Gives her a beautiful grinning
dialog: thumbs-up. Loves this stuff.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: This means I have four days
dialog: to make you my new best friend...
text: Brings Julianne's eyes back...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: And since I already know everything
dialog: about you. Including intimate
dialog: facts I'm mortified to have heard,
dialog: but too envious to forget. It's
dialog: time for you to learn about me...
text: Easing off the freeway. She meets Julianne's glance...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Force yourself. To get personal.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (smiles)
dialog: Sounds like a plan.
scene_heading: INT. DRESS SHOP, NORTH MICHIGAN AVENUE - MORNING
text: The place is stunning. High-ceiling, soft light, large rococo
text: mirrors, Louis Quatorze sofas and chairs. Michael wanders rest-
text: lessly, fish out of water among designer displays and stylish
dialog: female patrons.
text: Takes a look at his watch.
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM - MORNING
text: A period sitting room, ringed with mirrors along its tapestried
text: walls. Kimmy sits on a Louis Treize loveseat next to a stack of
dialog: costly gowns. Watching with an expertise beyond her years, as...
text: ... Julianne stands on a platform. A seamstress fitting her into a
text: sleek pale daffodil-colored gown. There are pins everywhere, as
text: the seamstress struggles toward a perfect fit. Continuously
dialog: looking to Kim for approval.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: If you'd rather the lilac...
text: Julianne shakes her head. This one is beautiful.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I thought bridesmaids had to wear
dialog: the same dress.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Not you. You won't be comfortable
dialog: unless you're distinctive.
text: Julianne glances over.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: What else did he tell you...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: ... you hate weddings, you never go.
dialog: Oh. Well, yeah.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: You're not up for anything
dialog: conventional, or popularly
dialog: assumed to be female priorities.
dialog: Including marriage. Or romance.
dialog: Or even...
text: And she stops. Not wanting to offend.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (quietly)
dialog: ... not even love.
text: The look holds. The seamstress keeps working, as if she's deaf.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: That's why Michael and I were
dialog: the wrong fit. Right from the
dialog: start.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: He said that, too.
text: She stands up. Walks to the platform. Smooths her hand over the
text: fabric down Julianne's back, along her hips. Communicating to the
text: seamstress with her irritated expression.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Well, I thought I was like you.
dialog: And proud to be. Until I met
text: rumpled, smelly old Michael...
dialog: Pins start to come out. Kimmy points, these, too!
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: And then I found I was just a
dialog: sentimental schmuck. Like all
dialog: those flighty nitwits I'd always
dialog: pitied.
text: She leans forward. So they can look at each other.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Funny world, huh?
text: Julianne swallows. It is that.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I need a smoke.
text: And before anyone can breathe, she steps OFF the platform RIPPING
text: the living shit out of the gown, right down the side. The seam-
text: stress' eyes FLASH OPEN in abject horror. Julianne, a deer in
text: headlights, looks quickly around at the evidence of her screw-up in
dialog: six different mirrors.
text: Kimberly just steps to her, fingers the tear...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: It's mostly the seam. Let's
dialog: get this to Carlos.
text: And UNZIPS Julianne down the back. In her rush to step out,
text: Julianne STUMBLES, but her arms are pinned by the pulled-down dress
dialog: and she just...
text: ... TOPPLES like a felled oak, THUDDING on her face, the gown
text: RIPPING some more, the seamstress SCREAMING like an idiot.
text: Then. Silence. Julianne looking up helplessly, a trussed hog,
text: bound in her dress.
speaker_heading: KIMMY (firm)
dialog: Just. Don't. Move.
dialog: Like you talk to a three-year-old. Deftly, Kimmy pulls the
text: dress free, leaving Julianne in her underwear. Signals to the
dialog: seamstress, let's go.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Don't you have to be somewh...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: ... just my bridal shower. And
dialog: Michael has to meet our dads and
dialog: the groomsmen at Comiskey for a
dialog: one-thirty game.
text: Opens the door...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Other than that...
text: Closed SOLID. Gone.
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER
text: Julianne sits on the loveseat in her bra and panties, lighting one
text: cigarette from the butt of another. Suddenly, she hears...
text: ... an ARGUMENT outside the door. Strains to listen. It does sound
text: like Michael and Kim. We can't make out the words. She jumps up,
text: dashes for the door, STUBBING her toe on the platform, SHIT!, falls
text: heavily AGAINST the door with a THUD that makes her wince, and...
text: ... the argument stops. Damn. She opens the door a crack. Sees
text: nothing. Opens it wider to reveal...
text: ... a teenaged BOY looking right at her. He sends a true shit-
text: eating grin and she SLAMS the door hard enough to RATTLE walls.
text: She PACES furiously, helplessly, arms around her half-naked self,
dialog: until...
text: ... soft knock. The door opens a crack, and her daffodil gown
dialog: comes through it.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Come in, and shut the...
text: Stops. Because it's Michael who has entered. With the dress.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... door.
text: So he does. She flushes and SNATCHES up her own clothes, which
text: were characteristically tangled in a heap, and tries desperately to
text: untangle them enough to cover herself. He is amazed and amused by
dialog: her embarrassment.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (laughing)
dialog: Should I turn around, or someth...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Michael, I'm in my underwear!
text: She's TEARING at her clothes, only making more of a mess.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: We've seen each other a lot
dialog: more naked than this.
text: She seems ready to rip her clothes apart, so he gently takes them
text: from her hands. She tries to stand unselfconsciously as he easily
text: untangles them.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I mean, we were skinny-dipping
dialog: in Greece, just as pals, less
dialog: than two years ago.
text: She GRABS the clothes and covers the front of herself. Looking at
text: him with a mix of emotions she couldn't begin to sort out.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Things are different now.
text: He looks in her eyes. And nods, a little sadly. Guess they are.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (softly)
dialog: Well. I leave with two thoughts
dialog: in my mind.
text: He walks to the door. Puts his hand on the latch. Looks back...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (even softer)
dialog: You're still a very pretty
dialog: girl.
text: The look holds. And holds. There is such feeling on both sides,
text: she doesn't know what to make of it. She swallows.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: What's the sec...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Mirrors.
text: And he's gone. She looks around at six different VIEWS of her
text: uncovered backside. Hmm.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL UNDERGROUND GARAGE - DAY
text: The parking valets wait by their stand as the convertible pulls up.
dialog: These girls must be late for something, the way they're jumping out
dialog: of the car.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... luckiest guy in the Northern
dialog: Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: What? Because I'm a little
dialog: understand...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... most sentimental schmucks I
dialog: pity want a honeymoon after their
dialog: wedding. Just to top it off.
text: The valet gives Kimmy her ticket.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: I can't expect the NBA to hold
dialog: up the playoffs...
text: They're walking fast toward the garage elevators...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: I'm excited Sports Illustrated
dialog: gave him this kind of shot, he's
dialog: only there a ye...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: So your honeymoon is exactly where?
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: It depends. If San Antonio sweeps
dialog: Sacramento, we could start there.
dialog: Or Phoenix. Or depending on Indiana-
dialog: Clevel...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... garden sports, all. Little swing
dialog: of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit,
dialog: represents a packing challenge, but
dialog: there's fine food and cocktails at a
dialog: choice of Embassy Suit...
text: At the elevator. Kimmy SLAMS the button.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: It's his career, I'm supportive.
dialog: Look, I've been everywhere, I've
dialog: seen the world, I've laid on a beach.
dialog: I want to be with the man I love.
dialog: That's what makes it a honeymoon.
dialog: End of story. Okay?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'm just saying he's lucky.
text: An empty elevator arrives. They get in.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Takes one woman in a billion to
dialog: put up with his array of shit.
dialog: The guy is a one-man festival of
dialog: idiosync...
text: Kimmy SLAMS the penthouse button. Looks at her calmly. Go on.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Well. You've been introduced
dialog: to the symphonic range of...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: ... his snoring, yeah. He says
dialog: it's worse than ever. That
dialog: snaffle one...?
text: Julianne imitates an incredibly annoying high-pitched SNARL. Three
text: times. Kimmy nods.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Well now it has this sorta
text: phlegm rattle behind it...
text: Stopped at the lobby. A family of four gets in. Oblivious, Kimmy
text: DEMONSTRATES the phlegm rattle. Really gets into it. As the
dialog: family watches, Julianne tries her own version. Like that? No.
text: More like this. The family is looking at each other.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Guess what? Earplugs work.
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: How about...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: ... cigars in bed? I broke him
dialog: on that. But the bathroom's a
text: swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner,
dialog: tells the same, admittedly funny,
dialog: jokes three hundred times...
dialog: Sucks in a breath...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: ... loves action movies, subscribes
dialog: to Playboy for godsake, reads over
dialog: my shoulder, can't keep track of
dialog: the checks he writes...
text: Ninth floor. The family gets out. The door closes.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
text: He sucks soup through his
dialog: front teeth.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: A trademark move, don't touch
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: But he sure can kiss.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: It's been awhile. I'll take
dialog: your word.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: After two weeks of cataloguing
dialog: all his faults, I made a command
dialog: decision that changed my life.
text: She SLAMS the EMERGENCY STOP button. We JOLT to a halt.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: I threw the list away.
text: Shakes her head.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: He's not a balance sheet, so
dialog: many wonderful qualities, so
dialog: many faults. He's Michael.
dialog: From her heart.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: And loving him means loving
dialog: all of this.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Do you get nervous in small
dialog: confined spaces?
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: So it's sweet of you to be
dialog: protective...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Let me rephrase that...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: But nothing ever could, ever
dialog: did, give me a moment's pause
dialog: about this marriage...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Do you get hysterical in small
dialog: confined spa...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: ... except one.
text: Julianne's face. Stops.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Oh, yeah?
text: Kimmy nods. Confides...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: You.
dialog: A stopper.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: You'll always be there. In his
dialog: mind. The perfect creature he
dialog: loved for all those y...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Well, perfection can get wearing
dialog: after whi...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: I'm not joking. I had to face
dialog: up to all my competitive drives,
dialog: and believe me, I've got 'em.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: And the answer was so simple.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I was gonna predict that.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: You win.
dialog: Julianne blinks. Excuse me?
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: You're enshrined in his heart
dialog: and memory. Unassailable.
dialog: Which works out great.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I've missed a step.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: He has you on a pedestal. And
dialog: me in his arms.
text: Oh. Julianne smiles. LUNGES for the EMERGENCY button, YANKING it
text: so hard it comes OFF in her hand. A terrifying BUZZER ensures.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Jesus, we're trapped!
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Ju...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: No, this happened to me once,
dialog: almost, it was excruciating!
text: Begins BANGING random buttons, out of control. Kimmy watching
text: this. Julianne looks WILDLY up...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: There's a panel up there, you
dialog: could boost me...
text: RIPPING off her platform shoes.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You know how little air is
dialog: in these things? I've seen
dialog: statistics! Once you're trapped
dialog: between floors...
text: Kimmy taps her. Points to the lighted panel. It says PH, they've
dialog: reached the Penthouse.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: God! Then the door is jammed!
text: Takes a heavy platform and begins BANGING the metal door with all
text: her strength, sending resounding BOOMS throughout the area, as
dialog: Kimmy reaches and...
text: ... presses DOOR OPEN. The metal doors part, opening directly onto
text: the banquet room, just as a mighty blow comes down, and the platform
text: FLIES from Julianne's hand straight BETWEEN...
text: ... two identical stunning YOUNG WOMEN, serving as twin hostesses
text: for the shower. A beat of mutually-stupefied looks, and we hear
text: the shoe CRASH somewhere, to a small spattering of SHRIEKS.
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: Mah Gawd, it's the bride,
dialog: and the woman she'll nevah
dialog: live up to!
dialog: KIMMY (mutters to Julianne)
dialog: That would be us.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Did she say th' wrong thang
dialog: agin? It is so in character!
text: AMANDA and SAMANTHA NEWHOUSE, 19-year-old twins. True Southern
text: belles, with the faces of angels and bodies made for hot oil
text: wrestling. Mandy's hair is dyed ash blonde, Sammy's is amber.
text: Otherwise, the experience is similar.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (thrusts out her hand)
dialog: I'm Julianne Potter, and...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: ... we'd be the vengeful sluts.
dialog: We came in complementary colors.
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: Have you sized up the groomsmen,
dialog: Jules? As M. of H., you get
dialog: first fuck. Don't pick the
dialog: short, hairy, rich one.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... unless he has a hump.
text: The girls cast identical blank looks at Kimberly.
speaker_heading: KIMMY (to the sluts)
dialog: Dry. I told you.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Is this Michael's Julianne?
text: All eyes turn to an elegant woman of barely 40. She has her
text: daughter's hair and eyes and slender form. But the bearing rules
dialog: half an empire. Fonda would envy.
speaker_heading: ISABELLE
dialog: I'm Isabelle Wallace, and my
dialog: handsome new son scarcely did
dialog: you justice, girl.
dialog: She takes both of Julianne's hands, and our heroine is sort of
text: magically charmed. As if touched by Glinda the Good Witch of the
dialog: North.
speaker_heading: ISABELLE
dialog: Now, my husband says to scoot
dialog: you over to the ballpark, so
dialog: you can hang with Michael. But
dialog: first, you have to meet a lot of
dialog: really old women.
text: Looking warmly in her eyes...
speaker_heading: ISABELLE
dialog: That is, if you've absorbed
dialog: enough profanity.
text: Flicks a glance at the twins. Leads Julianne off...
speaker_heading: MANDY (O.S., pouting)
dialog: We sayed one fuck.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI, SOUTH SIDE - DAY
text: Cab crawling toward COMISKEY PARK through stifling traffic.
text: Julianne oblivious, cellular to her ear...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Desperate measures! Do you
dialog: hear me? Digger, are you the...
text: SQUAWK. Static. Then...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I don't know, hit men, whoopee
dialog: cushions, saltpeter, something!
text: The girl is impossibly impregnable.
dialog: Even I want her to get the guy!!
dialog: Listens.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Tell him the what? The truth...??
text: She shakes her head. What a guy.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: That desperate. May I never get.
scene_heading: INT. LUXURY BOX, COMISKEY PARK - AFTERNOON
text: Game in progress. Watched by Michael, three groomsmen his age, two
text: middle-aged men, and one bodyguard. Suddenly, a dull THUMPING at
text: the door. It keeps up. They finally all look over. The bodyguard
text: gets the door, revealing...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Which of you gents ordered
dialog: two beers?
text: One single tray. Holding fourteen beers. Balancing on one hand.
text: Michael JUMPS UP, terrified at the impending mayhem this sight
dialog: suggests...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Wow! Lemme give you a ha...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (sweetly)
dialog: Michael. You'll unwittingly
dialog: imply that I'm clumsy.
text: He stops in his tracks. The guys whistle.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Think of that. And as well as
dialog: I know you.
text: She goes first to the bodyguard.
speaker_heading: BODYGUARD
dialog: Sorry, ma'am, I'm on duty.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (lovely smile)
dialog: It's Miss. And thanks. That
dialog: leaves two for me.
dialog: Heads down the row...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Julianne Potter, this is Hank
dialog: and Gerry from SI, and you know
dialog: Daniel...
text: She's nodding, flawlessly plucking two beers each from perimeter
text: of the tray, keeping the rest perfectly balanced in the center.
text: Michael is flat dumbstruck. Next, a tall patrician gentleman with
text: rolled-up sleeves on his hand-stitched silk shirt...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh. This is my father-in-law,
dialog: Walter.
text: Once again, she gracefully plucks two beers for the distinguished
dialog: father-in-law...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: How are you doing this? You're
dialog: on drugs.
text: Sets them down. The man has a smile wonderful in its ease.
dialog: Murmurs...
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: If he gives you grief, I'll have
text: him skillfully beaten, where the
dialog: wounds won't show.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I guess getting him whacked would
dialog: be politically out of the question.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Under the circumstances. Charmed
dialog: to know you, Jules.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
text: A nod between equals. She moves on...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And, this guy, you know...
text: She sure does, and effortlessly balancing her one-hand load, she
text: dips to kiss a porky, balding guy with big-time shoulders.
text: Straight on the lips.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Papa Joe.
text: They go way back. He is uncomfortable at this rich man's wedding,
text: even as gracious as everyone has been. His watering eyes twinkle
text: at her, and the voice has a trace of Boston...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You gonna be my boy's best man?
text: Despite SHOUTS from the others...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Best everything, Joe. But I'm
dialog: going to dance with you.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Dance? You don't dance! You
dialog: learn to dance??
text: Her innocent smile.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Moves. You've never seen.
text: BIG reaction from the guys, as she heads toward Michael with the
text: last of the beers, not looking down at the FIELDER'S MITT which
text: lies right in her path, and as his lips part to scream a warning,
dialog: she skips...
text: ... neatly AROUND it. He's in shock.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You're an impostor! What have
dialog: you done with my best friend?
text: As he takes away the remaining beers...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And how was the hot dog?
text: Hot dog? His eyes fix on her left breast. HUGE mustard stain.
dialog: She can't believe it.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Cheap and unnecessary. We were
dialog: looking anyway.
scene_heading: EXT. LUXURY BOX ROOF - DAY
text: Michael and Julianne sit with their beers on the edge of the luxury
text: box roof. The game, the stadium, spread out beneath them. Yet
text: they are alone in the world. She dangles her legs, and we can hear
text: her kicking the glass below.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I just admire your maturity,
dialog: that's all. I mean, there are
dialog: people who would find that kind of
dialog: perfection boring. Day after day,
dialog: year after year...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: ... see, that's what I thought at
dialog: first. How can you like someone
dialog: that perfect? No potential for
dialog: long-range livability.
text: Drinking their beers. Side by side. Both stare only at the game.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Luckily. The closer I watched,
dialog: the more the fault came into
dialog: focus. Each imperfection its own
dialog: adorable slice of vulnerability.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Such as.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: She's too genuine.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Hate that.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: How can you trust someone you
dialog: can never mistrust?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: What's next?
dialog: Keep sipping. Never look at each other.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No matter how many times I
dialog: leave the toilet seat up, she
text: forgets and puts it down.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
text: Endearingly absent-minded.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: My very point. Here's another one...
text: Shakes his head. This one really gets him.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Every day. She makes the bed.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Quite the little eccentric.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: At first, I thought it was a
dialog: gag, but she's always done it!
dialog: This is not the ammunition Julianne was hoping for.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Is there a coup de grace in
dialog: here, somewh...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: She admires. Tommy Lasorda.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Waiter! Check, please!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: She finds him "personable."
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Can that kind of defect be
dialog: passed on genetically?
text: She looks over now. And Michael is looking back. Smiling the most
text: wonderful smile. Her reaction shows that she thinks it's for her,
dialog: until...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Then again. She has a few good
dialog: traits.
dialog: Hating herself for asking, but seeing no way out...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Gimme like, eight and nine off
dialog: the top ten list...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: First girl I ever knew. Who
dialog: lets me give her a bath.
text: The look in his eyes. She can hardly bear it.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And when I hug her, even in
dialog: public. I don't have to let go
dialog: right away. She lets me hold
dialog: her as long as I want.
text: He seems so deeply in love.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Nice kid, don't you think?
text: A beat. A slow nod. A quiet...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Looks like, from here.
scene_heading: INT. SOUTH SIDE CLUB - NIGHT
text: A slender black woman sings a SOARING Gospel number, backed by
dialog: three ladies who could each solo in any church choir. It is
text: mesmerizing, stirring, transcendent. The unseen audience CLAPPING
text: FIERCELY in rhythm, SHOUTING support. SLOW PAN now...
dialog: ... every face is black. We aren't in church at all, but a
dialog: venerable blue club. One of those places you'd swear everybody's
dialog: played, from Robert Johnson to Bessie Smith and back again. As
text: the song ends, there is APPLAUSE, some RAPPING on tables with their
text: knuckles or their drunks. We keep PANNING to a far corner. Three
dialog: faces.
text: Julianne leans across her beer to Kimmy...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: How'd you find this pl...
text: Kim shaking her head. Looks admiringly to Michael...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Lived here my whole life,
dialog: never heard of it. Until
dialog: our first date.
text: She reaches slender fingers. Traces one back along his hair.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: He finds all these spots,
dialog: everywhere he goes, it's a
dialog: mystical gift.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (shy)
dialog: Jesus, one d-back from the Bears
dialog: knows a place...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: It's not just clubs. This guy
dialog: always knows the best everything.
dialog: The best guitar store, the best
dialog: beef ribs, the best Horowitz record,
dialog: was he always like the...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... always. The best dim sum, the
dialog: best camping stuff...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Stop, we're embarrassing h...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... best valley in New Zealand,
dialog: best... women's shoes...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I tried those on. When you
dialog: weren't looking.
text: Now he's grinning at Julianne. And she likes that a lot.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Where was that, Florence, huh?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Firenze.
text: Together in the memory. As Kimmy watches.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: The Vespa? Me hanging on behind
dialog: in the rain all night?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Till the gas ran out.
text: And, the first sniff of left-out...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: I love Florence.
text: Julianne's eyes flicker. Could this be a teensy opening? Keeps
text: her eyes, her easy smile, and her killer instincts trained on
dialog: Michael.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Take her there.
dialog: He nods, okay.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I mean, now. She's perky,
dialog: she deserves a honeymoon.
dialog: He draws a breath...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I heard. If San Antone sweeps
dialog: Sacramento. What is this shit?
dialog: You gotta get off the road by
dialog: September anyway, when does Fall
dialog: Quarter start?
text: And the happy couple look at each other. They are awkward.
text: Julianne's heart soar like eagle.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Uh. I'm not coming back. For
dialog: senior year.
dialog: Could this be. The Mother Lode?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Don't architects find a degree,
dialog: sort of... an asset?
text: The couple still staring in each other's eyes.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Well, the school will be here.
dialog: Architecture will still be around.
dialog: Right now...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I travel every week. College
dialog: ball, motor sports, training
dialog: camps...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: The most important thing. Is
dialog: being together.
text: And she smiles. Beautifully.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: I'm just a baby. I've got all...
dialog: the time... in the world.
scene_heading: EXT. CLUB - NIGHT
text: Michael putting Kim in the back of a cab. As Julianne watches.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Because I could come...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: To the twins' soiree? So they
dialog: can paw you and drool...?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (calls out, helpful)
dialog: They're gonna drool anyway!
text: Kim smiles. He kisses her, tenderly, through the open window. She
text: waves past him at Julianne.
speaker_heading: KIMMY (to both)
dialog: Enjoy each other.
text: And drives off. As he watches after, Julianne comes up behind him.
text: Slips her hand up onto his shoulder muscle. Starts giving a little
dialog: massage.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Should I whistle down a cab?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hey, cabs are expensive. I'm
dialog: cheap, remember?
text: Turns his head, to see her. She's still rubbing his shoulder.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Sometimes. About the dumbest
dialog: things.
dialog: Share a smile. As always, it covers a lot of years.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: The El's right down the street.
dialog: Unless you're afraid of the
dialog: neighborhood.
text: She looks around. It is an issue. But she remembers...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: No. I'm always safe with you.
text: She means that. He takes her by the hand. They begin walking...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Pretty amazing girl, you've got.
dialog: Make that kind of sacrifice.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What, leaving school...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... all of it. She's leaving her
dialog: family, her friends, everything she
dialog: knows. She's putting her career
dialog: on hold, and she seems a pretty
dialog: ambitious, driven, kind of pers...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (quietly)
dialog: In her way.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: All to follow you in this dumb
dialog: job, where you travel 52 weeks
dialog: a year to College Station, Texas,
dialog: and such. It's not a job for a
dialog: grown man, Michael, Peter Pan
dialog: never married.
text: He's let go of her hand now. Looking down at the pavement before
text: him, fists in his jacket pockets.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (softly)
dialog: I don't think she's naturally
dialog: the... submissive type. Aren't you
dialog: afraid she's gonna choke on this
dialog: stand-by-your-man shit after awhi...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (real quiet)
dialog: No.
dialog: Hit a nerve. This is promising.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable
dialog: sports... most girls in her spot would
dialog: be angling to get Daddy to offer you
dialog: some juicy gig right here in t...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: She would never. Never. Even think
dialog: of that.
text: Paydirt. Julianne's Geiger Counter is going berserk.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I guess you're right. That would
dialog: be deceitful... manipulative...
dialog: controlling... emascula...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I got the point.
text: He looks over at her. No smile on his face. An edge we haven't
dialog: seen. She shrugs...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Still. All's fair in love and
dialog: w...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: That would be a girl. I don't
dialog: even know.
text: They've reached the stairs to the El. A rickety train RATTLES
text: above them. As they start up, she slips her arm around his
dialog: waist...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (murmurs)
dialog: Forgive me, okay? I was talkin'
dialog: crazy.
text: He slides his arm around her shoulder. Pals. They climb out of
dialog: frame.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT
text: CLOSE on a shallow pool of water in a bathroom sink. Green powder
text: pouring in, a hand SWIRLING it around, until...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (O.S.)
dialog: It's Albanian, I think. Or Mongolian.
dialog: Or Canadian. One of those. I bought
dialog: it downstairs...
text: ... it becomes truly disgusting lumpy green mud.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (O.S.)
dialog: I figure, what the hell. Can it
dialog: make me look worse?
text: Follow the hand up as it SLATHERS the shit across her face in great
text: green dripping gobs. She's juggling the wall phone, trying to keep
text: it mudless, as she assures Digger...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Dig, of course. Of course, of
dialog: course, of course, of course I
dialog: have a plan. Certainment!
text: More green slime. The Julianne we know disappears.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: How? I ask myself, what would
dialog: Lucy Ricardo do in this situa...
text: Desecrates three hotel towels, wiping her hand.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Well, one worked, once.
text: THROWS them in the bathtub. Fastidiousness a short suit.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Ricky wouldn't let her in
dialog: the show.
text: Reaches for her toothbrush, absently. All her attention is on the
text: conversation and the hideous green face in the mirror.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I recall it differently, but
dialog: we digress.
text: Without looking, picks up a tube of hotel shampoo...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: So in the version, you're Ethel,
dialog: with better fashion instincts.
text: Squeezes it all over the toothbrush.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: This puts you in charge of Plan B,
text: the unprincipled and insanely
dialog: dangerous back-up plan...
text: Lifts it toward her mouth, liquid shampoo dripping from the
text: bristles.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: In case simple lying doesn't work.
text: At the last second. She stops. We don't know why, because she's
dialog: still never looked at the brush.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Question. What happens if you
dialog: brush your teeth with shampoo?
text: Turns on the tap. Tries to scrub the toothbrush clean, and DROPS
text: the phone into the green swamp, which SPATTERS all over her front.
text: Euucch. She's stymied, agitated, circling the sink, leaning down
dialog: to it...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: HOLD ON. I'M COMING IN FOR YOU!
text: She sets the toothbrush down in her toiletries kit. Decides to
text: YANK on the phone's cord, and the receiver SPRINGS out, BOPPING
text: her in the face. She's so filthy at this point, she just wipes it
dialog: clean on her nightshirt. Tells Digger...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You okay? This is one of those
dialog: problem phones.
text: Lifts the toothbrush and tube of paste from her kit.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Right. Your role. You know guys
dialog: from Sports Illustrated, yes? I
dialog: mean, you can walk right in there...
text: Squeezes on the paste, lifts the brush to her mouth...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You could get access to letterhead,
dialog: for example.
text: JAMS it in her mouth, brushing as...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (mouthful)
dialog: ... or even, maybe, their fax.
text: Stops. The funniest look on her face. Down to the toothpaste
dialog: tube...
dialog: Which says BEN GAY.
dialog: Oh.
scene_heading: INT. TIFFANY'S - MORNING
text: Julianne and Kimmy cruise the stately display cases. Everywhere,
text: the Tiffany logo, the silent, watchful staff in morning coats. As
text: they browse, Julianne takes a blueberry Danish from a paper sack,
text: and begins to eat.
text: The staff notices. So does Kim.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: It's an homage thing.
dialog: Hmm?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Awkward girls grow up on Audrey
dialog: Hepburn movies. You wouldn't
dialog: understand.
text: Kimmy doesn't. But wipes a blue glob from Julianne's face.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Anyway, I think you're wrong.
dialog: Wrong?
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: What you were saying before.
dialog: Before?
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: About Michael's job.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Oh, that. I forgot I even said
dialog: th...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: I just think you're wrong, is all.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Probably am. Forget I brought it
dialog: up.
text: Points to some jade pins. Kimmy wrinkles her nose.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: I mean, he loves his job.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad
dialog: flights, bad hotels, real bad food.
dialog: Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe
dialog: your copy gets into one issue out
dialog: of four...
dialog: Smiles.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: What's not to love?
text: None of this is lost on Kimmy. She's wondered the same.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: But he always says...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... whatever is manly and
dialog: independent.
text: Kim nods slowly. Way ahead of her.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Why would he trade that for
dialog: running, say, a big piece of
dialog: the PR at a powerful, complex,
dialog: challenging conglomerate like
dialog: your dad's?
text: Kim stares back. A strange look.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: That's just the sort of thing
dialog: my father and I discussed.
text: Julianne just blinks. Amazed.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'm not stupid. Say, how
dialog: about this?
text: Pointing to tiny golden scissors in the novelty case. Kim so
text: absorbed by the main topic, she has to force herself to focus on...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: For the twins? What in the
dialog: world is th...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Gold nose hair clippers.
text: Points to the tiny hand-lettered sign. Indeed. Kimmy shrugs, not
dialog: quite it.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: So you don't think Michael's
dialog: as happy with his job as...
text: Julianne points to a matched pair of large...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Gold dog collars? They don't
dialog: have dogs.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Hello.
dialog: Kim nods, oh. But can't keep her mind off...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: You think he'd accept?
dialog: Hmm?
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Michael. A job like that.
dialog: Oh, well...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: By any yardstick that involves
dialog: sanity, it would be the greatest
dialog: thing that ever happened to him.
dialog: Present company excepted.
text: Kimmy nodding slowly. Her yearing achingly apparent.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: On the other hand, he's proud.
dialog: Last thing a man wants to admit,
text: is being trapped in a dispiriting
dialog: dead-end job that can never
dialog: support a family.
dialog: A very sweet smile.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Throw a man a life preserver.
dialog: He'll say, "Thanks, anyway,
dialog: I'd rather drown."
text: Kim nods again. Right. They are so bonded at this moment.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: So... one almost has to...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Exactly what?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: What you said. Make it appear
dialog: that he's doing you the favor.
text: Kimmy bites her lip. Her eyes go down. Self-conscious to admit...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I couldn't really... do that.
dialog: After, you know...
text: Her voice trails off.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (kind, but wise)
dialog: ... lying. All the time.
text: That brings the gray eyes up. Julianne bats her dark ones...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Oh, darling, my pitiful desires
dialog: and ambitions are dirt beneath
dialog: the manly boots of your priorities!
text: Kimmy has to smile small. A self-awe gal.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (pouring it on)
dialog: Two hundred seedy motels a year?
dialog: Dinners out of vending machines?
dialog: Waiting for you in vermin-infested
text: corridors of dark crotch-rot locker
dialog: rooms? This stuff makes me hot!!
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: The very words I've used.
text: Julianne 'thinks it over.' Kimmy waits for guidance.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: We make Dad your co-conspirator.
text: Michael does a favor for Walter.
dialog: Simple.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Walter's reorganizing his public
dialog: relations, needs a brilliant guy
dialog: who's close to him, who he can
dialog: completely trust.
text: Kimmy nodding. Hope overriding reason.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: So you beg. Michael, please do
dialog: this for Daddy, please, please,
dialog: please, blah, blah, blah... it's
dialog: only for six months... it would
dialog: mean so much to me to help him out...
dialog: Turns up her palms. Viola!
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: He'll see right through it.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Only. If he wants to.
text: They share a smile.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: In six months, he'll be happy,
dialog: settled, successful...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: He won't get mad, huh?
speaker_heading: MR. MOONEY (O.S.)
dialog: May I be of any help, whatsoever?
dialog: Mr. Mooney is the most gracious Brit salesperson ever to offer
dialog: kindness, intelligence and thoughtfulness to a customer. He is
text: large, sixty, with disappearing hair, watering eyes, and a manner
dialog: that makes you think of immediately hiring a butler.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Bridesmaid gifts for two, well,
dialog: assertive, outspoken, Tennessee
dialog: debutantes.
speaker_heading: KIMMY (still focused)
dialog: He won't be mad?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (to Mooney)
dialog: Nothing here seems to quite capture
dialog: their distinctive personalities.
speaker_heading: MR. MOONEY
dialog: Something customized, perhaps?
dialog: We can fashion most any item
dialog: from gold.
text: Ah. Julianne nodding. Reflecting.
speaker_heading: MR. MOONEY
dialog: An object that might represent
dialog: what is closest. To their heart.
speaker_heading: KIMMY (under her breath)
dialog: Don't even think dildo.
text: Julianne digs through her jumbled bag...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Could you do this...
text: Tossing an object on the counter...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: In 24 carat?
text: It is a MASTERCARD. A gold one.
speaker_heading: KIMMY (softly)
dialog: Bingo.
text: They smile at each other. More bonded than ever.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: You don't think he'll be mad.
dialog: A beat. Can Julianne even make herself do this?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Your call. You can live a lie.
dialog: In a fabulous selection of Red
dialog: Roof Inns. Or you can make one
dialog: desperate stab at hap...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: I just don't want to freak him
dialog: out.
dialog: What do you think? Julianne stares into the soft gray eyes. It's
dialog: now or never. The smile of a dear sister...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: How mad could he get?
scene_heading: INT. FASHION RESTAURANT - LUNCH HOUR
text: Julianne enters with a really nervous Kimberly in tow. Approaches
dialog: the maitre d'. We CLOSE to hear...
speaker_heading: MAITRE D'
dialog: Oh, Mr. Wallace and his guests
dialog: have retired to the humidor.
text: Points to an escalator, leading to the mezzanine. Behind a glass
text: wall, what looks like a British men's club. Thirty guys and a
text: billion cigars. As Julianne starts toward it...
speaker_heading: MAITRE D'
dialog: Oh. Mademoiselle.
dialog: She turns back. Loves this shit.
speaker_heading: MAITRE D'
dialog: It's unofficial, of course. But,
dialog: traditionally, the humidor is for
dialog: gentlemen, only...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Great. I've got this girlfriend
dialog: at the Justice Department? With
dialog: all this time on her hands?
text: Her look is every bit as hard as his. He gestures to the
text: escalator. She takes Kimmy's hand, and up they go. We can see
text: Walter in a big leather chair, enjoying a major stogie. Kimmy
text: licks her lips.
text: They enter. Every head turns. A nice range of reactions, from
dialog: offended to attracted and points in between.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (murmurs)
dialog: Piece of cake. I'll hang, and
dialog: think happy thoughts...
text: Kimmy nods. Heads over toward her father. Julianne walks,
text: confidently, even provocatively, to the wall lined with bins of
text: cigars. Every eye in the place is on her butt.
text: She runs her fingers over a few contenders. Plucks one out,
text: examines it, puts it back. Walks a little farther. Selects
text: another, big and black. Rolls it expertly in her fingers. Sniffs
dialog: along its length.
text: A guy comes over. Could be 40, successful, a broker's pin-stripe.
text: Nearly as attractive as he thinks he is.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Know what you're looking for,
dialog: little lady?
text: Little lady, huh? She glances at his coven of buddies, who pretend
text: not to notice. Then, straight to the guy's blue eyes.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Yeah. Do you?
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: I asked first.
text: Ah. Wit. She holds up her cigar...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I like 'em long and hard. Kind
dialog: of... big around.
text: Runs it under her nose.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Smell is important, I'm a believer
dialog: in that.
text: Takes a match from a cut crystal bowl.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: But you never know what you've
dialog: got. Till you run your tongue
dialog: over it.
text: And she does. Moistening the full length of the cigar. The boys
text: are laughing openly. She STRIKES the match. As she lights up...
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: I meant. What you're looking for
dialog: in a man.
text: She glances at his wedding ring. Then, straight into his eyes.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Actually, I'm partial to married
dialog: gentlemen.
text: The way she says that. The guy swallows. We can see some of the
text: air has been sucked from the room.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Why is that?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: It's so much time. When I phone
dialog: the wives.
text: Explosive LAUGHTER from the peanut gallery. As she jams the big
text: Clemente Churchill into her mouth, she sees Kimmy waving her over
text: from across the room. Without even looking at the guy she's just
dialog: put away...
text: ... she crosses the room, Walter stands politely, looking very
text: dapper, very powerful, and focusing on her with considerable
text: interest. He waits until she sits on the edge of a costly leather
dialog: hassock.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (simply)
dialog: Your idea?
dialog: She can't read this guy. Maybe that's how he built an empire. She
dialog: nods, yeah.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You're a woman of insight.
text: He sits on the arm of his chair. Close enough to speak quietly.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: My wife and I love this marriage,
dialog: and deplore its circumstances.
text: He puffs his cigar. Julianne puffs her. Kimmy looks on, a kid
dialog: watching the grown-ups...
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: As you guessed, my daughter is
dialog: unhappy about giving up her life.
dialog: And, in my opinion, cowardly in
dialog: avoiding the necessary confrontation.
text: Then he stops. As if reading Julianne's eyes.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Mike has a world of ability.
dialog: I'd do anything to have him in
dialog: my company.
dialog: One more puff.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Except ask him.
text: Julianne is a little stunned. Kimmy looks helpless.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: He'd resent it. And me. And,
dialog: most important, Kim.
text: No smile on his lips. Straight talk.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: He's a great kid, but he's still
text: a kid. Instead of recognizing
dialog: that his resistance comes from
dialog: insecurity, he'd turn it to anger.
dialog: To protect himself...
text: Spreads his hands...
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: ... from realizing that he's
dialog: ignoring my daughter's needs,
dialog: despite how very much he loves her.
text: He looks to his daughter now.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: They both have some growing up
dialog: to do. But they're good people,
dialog: they're starting with love.
dialog: They've got time.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I think you're making a mistake,
dialog: sir.
text: His eyes come back to her. A little sharply.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: And that interests me. How
dialog: someone who knows him so well
dialog: could be so wrong.
text: A formidable guy. She meets his gaze.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: See, I love him, too, as much
dialog: as anyone here. And for a
dialog: whole lot longer.
dialog: From her heart.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I think I know best what would
dialog: make him happy.
scene_heading: INT. TOILET STALL - DAY
text: Julianne, fully dressed, sits on the closed lid of a toilet seat.
text: The stall is tiny enough to arouse claustrophobia in an astronaut.
text: Her cellular phone pressed to her ear, she is listening angrily,
text: smoking ferociously, every call in her body running at red-line.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Okay, okay, okay, okay, I hear
dialog: you, all right?
text: She closes her eyes.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: It is stupid, dishonest, desperate
dialog: beyond belief, and can't possibly
dialog: ever work. It can only end in
dialog: humiliation and disgrace. Now can
dialog: I say two words?
dialog: Deep drag on the cigarette. For strength.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
dialog: Do it! Do it!
text: She's striped her gears. COUGHS horribly.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: All right, twelve words.
scene_heading: INT. PUBLIC RESTROOM - DAY
text: Julianne exits the stall. To face three BLACK TEENAGE GIRLS. Just
text: staring at her.
speaker_heading: TEENAGER
dialog: (supportive)
dialog: You do it, girl.
text: Julianne nods to the kids. They nod back. Damn straight. She
text: exits the restroom, into...
text: ... glaring sunlight. We are in the middle of the BROOKFIELD ZOO.
text: And sitting on a bench, eating popcorn from a bag...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Wow. What was going on in
dialog: there?
text: She shudders.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Some crazy person.
scene_heading: EXT. ZOO - DAY
text: Michael and Julianne walking together. He's eating his popcorn.
text: She carries a cardboard container with nachos, a gooey fudge waffle
text: cone, and a large drink.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You're not eating.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I never eat when I'm serene.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You never eat when you're
text: despondent.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I switched that around when you
dialog: weren't looking.
text: She swirls a single nacho chip in cheese. But her heart isn't in it.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Last zoo we were in was...
dialog: Beijing, yeah? Sure. The rhinos
dialog: were fucking.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Boy, those were the days.
text: And when she looks over. His eyes are waiting.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Yeah, they were.
text: They're passing the hippo pen. But they don't notice.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: That was nice. The way you
dialog: said that.
dialog: So was that. He's feeling restless, something. Doesn't know quite
dialog: what to say.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It's weird being the groom. All
dialog: these things Kimmy has to take
dialog: care of...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You need a baby-sitter. That's
dialog: what I'm here for.
text: He holds her eyes. Then looks down. Awkward. And the way he's
text: doing it begins to excite her.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Say it.
text: He looks up, neither one of them noticing that as they walk, she is
dialog: about to...
text: ... CRASH into a chest-high metal stand that displays animal facts.
text: We have followed him as she is WIPED from frame. His face from
dialog: shock... to amusement.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Now, there's my girl.
text: ... to tenderness. PAN back to see her wearing everything from her
text: cardboard container. Nachos, fudge sauce, Diet Coke, the works.
text: It is really awful. Kids, bystanders, laughing cruelly. Her eyes
text: fill with tears, and she tries bravely to smile against it...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: See, I can only do it with
dialog: beer.
text: He takes out his handkerchief. And with that and his hands, gently
text: scoops the worst of the mess off her. The fact that he's touching
text: her breasts and her body is something they pretend not to notice.
text: She laughs softly, and a few tears fall, even though she doesn't
dialog: know why. Such an odd, raw, confusing moment. To the world
text: looking on, they are lovers.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (murmurs)
dialog: See, better already.
text: And he kisses her face. Not quite her lips. But only an inch away.
text: We can feel her heart pounding. He strips off his shirt, only a tank
dialog: top underneath.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: We'll go back to the bathroom,
dialog: you'll put this on...
text: Okay? She sniffles, okay. Swallows.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Bet you're glad I'm here to
dialog: take care of you.
text: He puts his arm around her.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Bet I am.
text: Holds her close, as they start toward the restroom...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hope that crazy person's not
dialog: still there.
dialog: We're on their backs...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (O.S.)
dialog: She doesn't scare me.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH CLUB, LAKE MICHIGAN - SUNSET
text: Julianne in T-shirt and shorts, rushes onto the deck of a sprawling
text: beach club. Clutching her bag, she quickly surveys the scene...
text: ... the entire beach has been taken over by the wedding party.
dialog: Young folks, old folks, little kids, maybe 200 people. We SCAN
text: with her to find a crowd around...
text: ... a three-on-three volleyball game. Kimmy and two groomsmen on
text: one side, facing Michael and the Tennessee debs. The twins wear
text: spectacular bikinis and are surprisingly athletic, as well as
text: predictably uninhabited. As the next point begins, Kimmy serves...
text: ... Sammy in back makes a nice dig, lobbing to Mandy who sets for
text: Michael's vicious SPIKE straight THROUGH his best man's hapless
text: defense. The crowd cheers Michael, and as he turns, Mandy gives
dialog: him a savage...
dialog: ... CHEST BUMP of congratulation, that any NFL linebacker would be
text: proud of. It puts the surprised Michael straight on his butt.
text: Laughter, applause. The twins pull him up and Sammy gives him a
text: hot kiss on his ear that makes the crowd react. Kim plays good
text: sport. Julianne watches Michael's body for a beat, then...
text: ... dashes off. Down the beach, several barbecue grills have been
text: set up. Manned by beach club staff and family alike. Michael's
text: pop, Joe, is dispensing beers from a keg. Kim's mom, Isabelle, is
text: coordinating the beans, potato salad and corn-on-the-cob table.
text: Julianne races across the sand to...
text: ... a huge smoky grill where Walter is basting baby back ribs,
text: clearly enjoying himself. Julianne runs up to him, says something
text: into his ear. He looks at her. Then turns his station over to a
text: club steward, and follows Julianne down toward the lakeside.
text: CLOSE now. As they stroll together, she's a little breathless.
text: He's watching her profile, curious, silent. At the water's edge...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Is anybody watching?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I hope so. This is all too
dialog: mysterious to waste on just me.
text: She reaches into her big bag. Pulls out a single folded sheet of
dialog: paper.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I picked up Michael's messages
dialog: for him, at our hotel. I stole
dialog: one...
text: His face darkens. The easy smile fades. He holds up his palms...
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Julianne, reading my son-in-law's
dialog: mail, is not something...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Sir, this is important! Haven't
dialog: you ever in your life cut one
dialog: corner, to make something important
dialog: turn out right?
text: His smile returns. Just a little.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Matter of fact, that's how I got
dialog: married.
text: The look holds. She thrusts the paper out. He still doesn't take
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: It's a fax from Sports Illustrated
dialog: from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: I know Ben.
text: She opens the paper.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: "Mike. We still have no answer to
dialog: our E-mail of Wednesday. Which
dialog: option do you select? I don't mean
dialog: to rush you, but Personnel needs to
dialog: tie up the loose ends."
text: He takes the paper. We see it now. Looks authentic.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I think he's been fired.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: It doesn't say th...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: He's said some things over the
dialog: past few weeks. Look, this is why
dialog: I came up with the idea of you
dialog: offering him a job.
text: He looks up. He's listening. Closely.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: And why I couldn't say anything
text: before in front of Kim.
text: She bites her lip. Seems so earnest.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I just think of how... desperate
dialog: he must be feeling. He's marrying
dialog: a rich man's daughter, and he's
dialog: about to become destitute. You
dialog: know the kind of job market he'll
dialog: be facing?
dialog: He does.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: And you think he's kept this to
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
text: He's too proud to beg for help.
dialog: And if you wait till this comes out,
dialog: your offer will be like charity.
text: Completely humiliating.
text: He's staring at her. But his mind is working behind his eyes.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: If you do it now, it's like he's
dialog: helping you. He can accept with
dialog: dignity.
text: He taps the paper with the back of his knuckles.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: This fax could mean... any number
dialog: of things...
text: She nods. She knows that.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Maybe. I should call Ben.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Then it could all come out, sooner
dialog: or later. Nobody should be in on
dialog: this. Just you and me. Or, more
dialog: correctly, I.
text: She takes the paper back.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: What if, what if I could find
dialog: that E-mail?
text: The long straight look. Maybe he's hooked.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I never noticed. Kimmy has your
dialog: eyes.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY, RITZ CARLTON HOTEL - TWILIGHT
text: Tall, gangly, young DESK CLERK. Lank hair, pimples. He looks up,
dialog: beams to see...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Hello, again.
text: She's flirting her ass off.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You still haven't straightened
dialog: that tie.
text: And she reaches across the desk with her lovely, slender hands.
text: Does it for him. Her fingers brush his chest on the way back. We
dialog: can assume a woody.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You know, my friend, the one
dialog: whose message I picked up... ?
text: He does. His eyes flick toward his stately female SUPERVISOR,
text: helping another guest across the way.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Well, he's still with the wedding
dialog: party. And he asked me to get
dialog: something he needs real badly from
dialog: his room... ?
text: The boy swallows hard.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: He's in 1526. If you could just
dialog: let me ha...
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: See that woman?
text: Not only does Julianne see her. The woman is looking back, while
text: she's talking to her customer. Not a pleasant look.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: She said, if I ever pull a stunt
dialog: like that again...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You'll lose your job...
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: ... tear my pecker off. Is what
dialog: she said.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - TWILIGHT
text: An elevator OPENS, revealing Julianne, carrying a gym bag. She
text: looks down the long hallway, sees a maid's cart. Heads the other
dialog: way, briskly, to...
text: ... a small ALCOVE. Opens the gym bag, pulling out a bath towel.
text: Begins to yank her top up OVER her head...
text: ANGLE... the young MAID now pushing her cart down the hall, wheels
text: SQUEAKING, and from nowhere...
text: ... Julianne DARTS into her path, barely covered by the towel held
text: tight across her, she is grinning, blushing.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Help me!
text: The maid can only blink.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I locked myself out, 1526, please
dialog: hurry!!
text: And looks frantically up the hall, mortified that any moment a
text: stranger could happen upon her predicament. Her eyes dart back to
text: the maid. PLEASE. The maid just stares. Stares.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Uno-cinco-does-ses.
dialog: Oh.
scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - TWILIGHT
text: Julianne alone in his room, looking around frantically. No worries
dialog: about this guy making his bed every day, stuff, clothes, strewn
text: everywhere, the bathroom looks like a cherry bomb just detonated.
text: She's tramping through a bachelor's debris, wearing only her towel,
dialog: looking, looking...
text: There it is. The corner of his LAPTOP sticking out from beneath a
text: discarded bedspread. She SNATCHES it up, OPENS it, sets it on the
dialog: cluttered desk, and...
text: ... stops. There are wallet-sized SNAPSHOTS of Kimmy. Some alone.
text: Some as a little girl. Some with Michael. And next to them...
text: ... the plastic fold-out wallet inset. That he has not yet quite
text: rearranged. So she picks it up. Leafs through, until she finds
dialog: what she was praying would be there...
text: ... Julianne grinning. Michael's arm around her. On the deck of a
text: boat. They have drinks in their hands. Happiness in their eyes.
dialog: And she stares at it. Jesus, God, how long has he carried this
text: around? She flips through further, all the rest have her in them.
text: Maybe half a dozen. Her heart is throbbing. Her eyes are damp.
text: Back to the one on the boat. She slips it from the plastic window.
text: Holds it. Then, gently...
dialog: ... puts it back where it belongs. PUNCHES up the goddamn laptop.
dialog: This is it, girl! Do or die.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (murmurs)
dialog: You wouldn't change your
dialog: password, would you? You
dialog: never change anything.
dialog: Those words make her bite her lip. Damn, I'm becoming a senti-
dialog: mental slob. TYPES in...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (murmurs)
dialog: Shoeless... Joe.
text: Yes! We're in! Punching keys. Letters flying across the screen.
dialog: Okay, we're ready. Types...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (reads as she types)
dialog: Mike. I hate this downsizing
dialog: shit as much as you do. But I
dialog: know this can't become as a
dialog: complete surprise...
scene_heading: INT. BEACH CLUB CARD ROOM - EVENING
text: Through the window, the wedding party barbecue has extended into
text: night. Lanterns, music, lots more food, lots more drinks. In the
text: distance, on the sand, Michael is slowdancing with Kimmy. Some-
text: where nearby, the soft CLICKING of keys. We PULL BACK to see...
text: ... a small clubby room. Books, leather, polished woods. Only
text: two people here. Walter, looking on stony-faced, as a determined
text: Julianne grimly "struggles" to "find" what she's looking for in
dialog: Michael's laptop. And then...
text: ... she stops typing. Looks at the text on the screen. Her eyes
text: sharpen as she "reads" what Walter can't see. It's an Oscar
text: performance for our desperate girl. She turns the screen around...
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (reads)
dialog: Mike. I hate this downsizing...
text: He reads. Reads. Reads. All the air comes out of him.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (softly)
dialog: And Kimmy doesn't know.
dialog: She shakes her head. Nope. No way.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (signs)
dialog: I'll tell her I've reconsidered.
text: She nods, gravely. Right. He looks in her eyes.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You're a smart girl, Jules.
text: She forces up a fleeting smile of gratitude. But Walter isn't
dialog: smiling at all.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Wish my daughter. Bad your
dialog: guts.
scene_heading: INT. CHARLES TROTTER'S BAR - NIGHT
text: The hot saloon in Chinatown. Upscale, downscale, jammed, Michael
text: and Kimmy at a small table in a far corner. CLOSE on them...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Sure you're okay?
text: She looks really scared. Turns her drink in her hand. Looking
dialog: down at it.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It's not just a gag, huh?
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
text: He takes her hand, tenderly.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I wish you'd just... come out
dialog: with it. I mean why are we
dialog: waiting for Jules?
text: She smiles up at him. The best she can.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Moral support.
text: She loves him so much, and she is sick with worry.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: What's good of having a big
dialog: sister, if she...
text: Stops. Gestures with her eyes. Because her big sister has just
dialog: entered...
text: ... looking fabulous. Julianne wears a long sleek sarong, slightly
text: see-through. Her hair is bound up with silver pins. As she moves
text: through the room toward us, we can see that, for once, her make-up
text: is flawless, understated. When she arrives at the table...
text: ... Michael is beaming, admiringly. He stands up.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Wow and wow. You have a date,
dialog: after this?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Never can tell.
text: He holds her chair. She exchanges an intimate smile with the
dialog: anxious Kim.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You make me think of that song,
dialog: we used to...
text: And he starts humming. The song is, "The Way You Look Tonight."
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Someday. When I'm awfully low...
text: They sit. He looks from Julianne to his bride.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Okay, kid. You're on.
text: Kim's eyes flick to Julianne, who nods, supportively. The kid
text: takes a breath.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: It's really my father. Who
dialog: needs the favor.
text: His face sort of comes to a stop. Nothing she can read, yet. He
dialog: nods, yeah...?
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: He's... he's reorganizing some of
dialog: the divisions of the company...
text: His eyes flick to Julianne. She looks down.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: He never mentioned that. Neither
dialog: did y...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: (blurting)
dialog: ... and public relations is a big
dialog: problem area for him.
text: She can see it now. In his eyes. She just can't tell how bad.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: He needs someone incredible,
dialog: someone really close, who he
dialog: can trust...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Like family, huh?
text: So quiet. So cold. She is terrified.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: It would only be, maybe, six
dialog: months? Or three or four? It
dialog: would mean so much to him...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: To him.
text: She swallows. Straightens her spine.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: And to m...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (sharp, to Julianne)
dialog: ... and you knew about this.
text: Real quiet. Against the noise of this place.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I think you ought to listen to
dialog: her, Michael. This is her life,
dialog: too.
dialog: Just the thing. To bring that anger near the surface. He turns
dialog: to Kim...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, which is it?
dialog: A demand. Sharp. Accusing. She doesn't like that...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You gonna tell me Daddy thought
dialog: this one up? All of a sudden, I'm
dialog: the only jerk alive who can help
dialog: him deal with the press?
text: She's trapped. Angry, scared. A deer in headlights.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Why don't you start being honest
dialog: for one fucking sec...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Michael!!
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: (near tears)
dialog: I am honest!
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: All of a sudden, I'm supposed to
dialog: drop out of school, forget my
dialog: family, forget my career, forget
dialog: all the plans I had for my life...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, forgive me for screwing up
dialog: your plans!
text: He can't even believe he's hearing this.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'm sure glad I'm hearing all
dialog: this now, before it's too late!
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: What is that sup...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And what am I supposed to do with
dialog: my life, huh? I am 28 years old!
dialog: I work in a low-paying, low-status,
dialog: zero-respect job which,
dialog: unfortunately, I happen to fucking
dialog: love. How inconvenient.
dialog: Shrugs.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No problem. A little bullshit
dialog: about Daddy's "needs," and presto,
dialog: I'm a lap dog in high society.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Michael, it sounds like a
dialog: wonderful opportun...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (whips around)
dialog: Does it, really? How come you
dialog: never took some sell-out
dialog: establishment job? You had plenty
dialog: of chances!
text: Glares in her eyes.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'll tell you why. Because that
dialog: isn't you. And it isn't me,
dialog: either! We're the same person!
dialog: Back to Kim...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What a sweet little picture. Mommy
dialog: and Daddy aren't losing a daughter,
dialog: they're gaining a eunuch!
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Well, if that's the way you f...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Damn straight, it's how I feel!
dialog: What's their wedding gift, a little
dialog: gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"?
dialog: Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?
text: She's crying now. Real tears on her face.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Great! Tears! The big equalizer.
dialog: You wait till two days before the
dialog: wedding to drop this on me, and
dialog: I'm just supposed to roll over and
dialog: drool!
text: She is sobbing now. She can't help herself. Which makes him
text: totally crazy. He jumps up.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Fine. I'm an insensitive, chauvinist
dialog: asshole, and you're well rid of m...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: MICHAEL!!
text: A wrenching cry from her heart. It stops him cold. And before
text: Julianne's astonished eyes, Kimmy reaches out a trembling hand...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Michael, you are so...
text: Choking back the sobs.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: ... so right. And I am so very
dialog: wrong.
text: Michael blinks. Julianne blinks. For different reasons.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: We can't go down two roads. And
dialog: still be together.
text: Her fingers stretch, beckoning.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Uh, Kimmy...?
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: (ignores her)
dialog: We settled this. And I reneged.
dialog: That wasn't fair.
dialog: Please, please, take my hand.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: You have to forgive me, and forget
dialog: this ever happened...
text: People are watching, staring. These two see only each other.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: ... or I'll die.
text: A frozen, forever moment. He steps to her...
text: ... LIFTS her up in his arms. Into the deepest, most heartfelt
text: KISS. And as she clings to him, people begins to APPLAUD, and
dialog: whistle, and laugh.
text: Julianne. In her pretty dress. Closes her eyes.
scene_heading: INT.JULIANNE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Julianne in her nightshirt, her back to us, sobbing into her
text: cellular as she paces the room...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... see that's what I never
dialog: counted on! I never heard of
dialog: a brilliant moron before!
text: We CLOSE as she WHIPS around, startling us with her grotesque day-
text: glo PURPLE face mask. The green was better.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I mean, the little twerp
dialog: GROVELED!!
dialog: Losing it. We know the drill.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: SHE IS SO WRONG FOR HIM!
text: Clutching the phone.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Michael and I are the same person!
dialog: Self-absorbed and imperfect and
dialog: vaguely loveable! We deserve
dialog: each other!
text: Tears are flowing. Which, over this mask, is not a pretty sight.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'm out of hope, I'm out of sneaky
dialog: ideas, I'm at the end of my

dialog: rope! Help m...
text: She TRIPS over an open suitcase, and DISAPPEARS from frame. The

speaker_heading: JULIANNE (O.S.)
dialog: God, I hate this hotel.
text: HOLD. On nothing is particular.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (O.S.)
dialog: And I hate talking to your machine!
scene_heading: INT. JULIANNE'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING
text: REAR VIEW of Julianne asleep on the floor, sunlight streaming in.
text: A soft knocking on a door, somewhere nearby. She barely stirs.
text: The knock becomes a strong RAPPING, and she fights for conscious-
dialog: ness. Her back still to us, she...
text: ... rises, STUMBLES to the door, which is now pulsing with an
dialog: insistent POUNDING, and THROWS it OPEN, as we SNAP to...
text: REVERSE ANGLE... CLOSE on Julianne's face, still encased in a now-
text: decomposing PURPLE MASK, her eyes SPRINGING wide, she SCREAMS in
dialog: shock, and we SNAP BACK to...
text: ORIGINAL ANGLE... Digger, watching impassively at the high-strung
text: SHRIEK. In the silence that follows...
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: You stole my line.
text: He touches his face, and she realizes!
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Oh, shit!
text: Starts CLAWING at the overripe mask, but he grabs her wrists.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Chill. We don't want your face
text: coming off with it.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Chill? Since when do you say
dialog: ch...
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: When I'm talking to children.
text: She looks in his eyes. Realizing at last.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You flew all the way h...
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: I noticed. I'm on the noon back.
dialog: We have this thing with George's
dialog: family in the Hamptons.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (soft)
dialog: You're butting in.
text: He still holds her wrists. She brings one of his hands to her
text: lips. Kisses his knuckles.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (softer)
dialog: I really resent this.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - MORNING
text: Julianne seated at the sink, staring into the mirror, as Digger
text: gently applies soup, cloth and water to easing away the mask. A
text: paleontologist restoring a Bronze Age artifact. By the side of the
text: half-filled sink, rests her plugged-in curling iron.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: What I mean, when I say annoyingly
dialog: perfect, is that there is nothing
dialog: annoying about her perfection.
dialog: It is vulnerable and endearing.
dialog: And that is annoying as shit.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: You like her.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: If I didn't have to hate her, I'd
dialog: adore her.
text: She looks up at him and WINCES, as the movement makes him scrape
dialog: her face. He's sorry.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Last night, she was crying, these
dialog: big, real tears, when she thought
dialog: she'd lost him. It was like there
dialog: was a knife in her heart...
text: Looking in his eyes. Needs him to hear.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... and I put it there. I hated
dialog: myself, I grieved for her, I
dialog: couldn't enjoy one second of it!
dialog: And then, when it didn't work...
dialog: Can you believe this?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I was devastated.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Go figure you.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Because I realized. When I see
dialog: him say "I do," that knife will
dialog: be in my heart. And it will be
dialog: there every...
text: She holds his wrists now. To stop him. To plead for
dialog: understanding. Forgiveness.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... every time I think of him,
dialog: forever, which could be a lot.
text: She almost choked on that last part. So she composes herself.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You watch a guy caress his
dialog: girlfriend's butt. You see an
dialog: Old Spice commercial. Sentimental
dialog: moments are everywhere, when
dialog: you're in the right frame of mind.
text: She swallows hard. Fights for a grip on her determination.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: There are 18,250 nights in the
dialog: next 50 years...
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: You've been working on this, huh?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... and having "done the right
dialog: thing" will only really be
dialog: comforting, oh, maybe, five,
dialog: six times.
text: She sets her jaw.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: This is my whole life's happiness.
dialog: I have to be ruthless.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: And you believe that.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (unconvincing)
dialog: Sure.
text: His eyes are gentle and merciless at once. No way she gets off
dialog: this hook.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: He was in love with me every day
dialog: for nine years. I can make him
dialog: happier than she can.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: It's not his happiness you're
dialog: feeling guilty about...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (proudly)
dialog: I don't know the meaning of the
dialog: word guilt!
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Impressive.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I am breaking her heart in the short
dialog: run, but doing her a gigantic favor!
dialog: She would be miserable tagging
dialog: along after this insensitive doofus!
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: The man you love.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Beyond reason. The feminist
dialog: warrior will rise up in this kid,
dialog: and she'll be standing over his
dialog: sleeping form with a butcher
dialog: knife, selecting from a short
dialog: list of body parts!
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Someday she'll thank you.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Let's not get carried away.
text: And the defenses drain from her clay-ravaged features. The real
text: Julianne is glimpsed.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'd settle for. Someday, I'll
dialog: forgive myself.
dialog: For...?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: For doing this terrible thing.
text: Her eyes tear up.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Which, by the way, I can't
dialog: figure out how to do.
text: As the tears fall, he wipes at them, discovering...
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Jesus. You're supposed to take
dialog: your make-up off before you
dialog: apply the m...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I KNOW THAT! I WAS DISTRACTED BY
speaker_heading: GRIEF!
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Guess what I brushed my teeth
dialog: with last night?
text: He thinks about this. Following her eyes to the toiletries kit, he
dialog: browses for a moment...
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Zit cream?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I wish.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Neosporin?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Try less appropriate.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Ben Gay.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: That was Thursday.
text: He stops on that note.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Elmer's Glue?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING
speaker_heading: A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
text: She's hysterical.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: I give.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I can't even say it.
dialog: Now. He's curious.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
text: A hint. The first word is
dialog: "Preparation." Then comes a
dialog: letter of the alphabet,
dialog: perilously close to G.
text: She reaches to test her curling iron, BURNS her finger, SHIT!
text: KNOCKING the appliance into the half-filled sink. She LUNGES for
text: it, and a terrified Digger GRASPS her arm...
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Considering the circumstances,
dialog: I'm not wholly against suicide...
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Just not by electrocution in
dialog: front of me!
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: I've got this noon flight.
text: He reaches to pull the plug from the wall, and now she LUNGES to
text: grab his arm, slipping, her face falling forward, stopping an inch
text: above the sink.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: How do you know you can touch
dialog: that plug? Are you a licensed
dialog: contractor?
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: What do you suggest?
text: She looks from the plug down the cord, to the submerged curling
dialog: iron. And back.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Maybe they just seal off this
dialog: room. They have others.
text: He's staring at her. Sweet, but intense.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: I didn't mean about that.
dialog: Oh. Again.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: If I hear the words "tell the
dialog: truth," or any paraphrase thereof,
dialog: I dive into the sink and pull you
dialog: with me.
text: Looking at her. Looking at her.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Let's go meet Michael. I'll
dialog: wait downstairs.
scene_heading: INT. ARMANI - MORNING
text: Julianne has cleaned up pretty good. She sits with Digger on a
text: fashion-fabric sofa. They are side-by-side, studying something
text: with equal concentration. And slight concern.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: I suppose it's too late to
dialog: start over.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
text: It's too late to start over.
text: PULL BACK to reveal Michael in his wedding tux, submitting to a
text: final fitting from a stylish fitter.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You guys are heartless, my
dialog: bride picked this out.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Like I said, dazzling.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Is she going to dress you
dialog: every day?
text: Michael smiles over. Digger smiles back. They live each other.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah, it's in the contract.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Well, then, I'll take it up
dialog: with her.
text: Michael motions, okay, c'mon over. Digger rises, goes to Michael,
text: the fitter steps back as Digger shows him...
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: The cut here, here... this
dialog: line...
text: Fingers lightly traveling over the lapel, the side-stitching, the
dialog: cloth straight down the spine...
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: ... trouser width, this is all
dialog: classic. Which means safe,
dialog: something I'd wear.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I should look different.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: You should look like you
dialog: dressed yourself.
text: Yes? Michael's grin is back. Playful and friendly.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And I'm supposed to respect
dialog: your fashion tips, because
dialog: you're what, a New Yorker?
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: (quiet smile)
dialog: Something like that.
dialog: Julianne loves that the boy are getting on.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (means this)
dialog: Long trip. Pretty nice of you
dialog: to come.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Well, I'm close to her. I wanted
dialog: to meet the one that got away.
text: Said so naturally. That embarrasses Michael, who looks down, his
text: smile suddenly awkward.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'm just glad someone finally put
dialog: this thing in its proper perspective.
text: Steals a glance at Julianne. She rolls her eyes. What a goofball,
dialog: my outrageous friend.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (to Digger)
dialog: Stay, huh?
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: I honestly wish I could...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'll call George's parents.
dialog: Tell them I need a best man who
dialog: actually looks after me.
text: Julianne comes over.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: They'd say that's my job.
text: She runs her hands over his jacket, smoothing it everywhere. With
text: tenderness that approaches transparency. Glances back at Digger...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'll take it home from here.
text: Pinches Michael's ear. Looks in his eyes.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Two words.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Major. Dish.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Manicure...
text: She looks down. Michael's nails are unclipped, with layers of
text: impacted dirt. She touches his fingertips, a little more softly
dialog: than she may have intended.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Fly.
text: Everyone looks down. She ZIPS Michael up.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (to Digger)
dialog: You don't miss much.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Part of being a New Yorker.
scene_heading: INT. HAIR SALON - MORNING
text: Cutting edge salon. Loud, PULSING MUSIC. Digger and Michael in
text: adjacent chairs, heads back, each smoking impressive cigars as
text: their hair is styled. Digger's stylist is a hot trashy female.
text: Michael's is a tall, flamboyant male in a day-glo vest.
text: Each man has one hand soaking, the other being worked on by a
text: manicurist, so Julianne goes from one to the other, removing their
text: cigars so they can exhale. A seraglio feel to the way she does
dialog: this.
text: Now she's arguing with Michael's stork-like stylist. We can't hear
text: over the music, but she keeps tugging on Michael's hair, pretty
text: passionate about her point of view. Suddenly, she GRABS the
dialog: scissors to do it herself, and Michael...
text: ... BOLTS out of the chair. WHOA!
scene_heading: EXT. O'HARA AIRPORT - DAY
text: Skycaps, guests of impatient travelers, a bus offloading forty
text: Japanese tourists. A taxi cuts off a van to reach the curb. Out
dialog: jumps...
text: Michael. Opening the door for Digger and Julianne. Digger says
text: something, Michael gives him a strong HUG. Julianne raises one
text: finger to Michael, back in a second. Leads Digger off by the hand.
text: CLOSE on them now. Alone in the throng.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Bye, handsome.
text: Digger just stares at her. Those maddening judgemental eyes.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You're going to say it, aren't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Tell him you love him. With
dialog: all your heart.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'm taking my next book to
dialog: Viking.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Tell him you've loved him for
dialog: nine years, but you were afraid
dialog: to realize it.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'm moving this book to Viking.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Tell him you're afraid of love.
dialog: Afraid of needing.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Needing.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: To belong to someone.
text: He touches her hair.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: We all do, beautiful. I'm sorry
dialog: about that.
text: Staring in her eyes. Even Julianne has run out of words.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Tell him you know this is the
dialog: worst, dumbest, cruelest moment
dialog: to do this to him. But there
dialog: it is, and he has to choose.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: And what will he do?
text: Digger isn't smiling. His voice low, beneath the crowd...
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: He'll choose Kim. You'll stand
dialog: by her at her wedding. You'll
dialog: kiss him good-bye. And you'll
dialog: go home.
text: He holds up one finger. Almost touching her nose.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: This is what you've come to do.
dialog: Now do it.
text: Wow. She looks frightened and moved, all at the same time. She
text: kisses him on the lips.
text: And walks away. He watches her go through the crowd. Take
text: Michael's hand. Lead him back toward the taxi.
scene_heading: EXT. SKYLINE CRUISE BOAT - DAY
text: The skyline of Chicago moves past us. Slowly. The NBC Tower,
dialog: Cityfront Center...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
dialog: Big weddings are so strange.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (O.S.)
dialog: You keep saying that.
text: Up ahead, the Wrigley Building draws closer...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
dialog: Kim has all this stuff to do,
dialog: I hardly see her.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (O.S.)
dialog: Well, you've got the rest of
dialog: your lives.
text: REVERSE ANGLE... they lean on the rail of a cruise boat, easing down
text: the Chicago River. Wind-blown. Close together.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Getting your bed made. Every
dialog: day.
text: They smile at each other. Seem so comfortable together.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You miss her, huh?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No. I've got you.
dialog: She nods. That you have. Staring in her eyes...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Don't you throw up on boat?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: If you like.
text: And she LURCHES over the railing, emitting a BARRAGE of incredibly
text: disgusting sounds, her feet FLAILING in mid-air. He laughs, as he
text: pulls her back down to the deck. Of course, it was all a joke. He
text: brushes back her hair. Sighs. Stares.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I've been thinking a lot the
dialog: last couple days. About us,
dialog: actually.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (casual)
dialog: Have you.
dialog: He has.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Well. There's a lot of memories
dialog: to choose from...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It's more than that.
text: That tightens her throat pretty good. When she tries to speak, out
text: comes a dry CROAK that makes him laugh again. Softer, this time.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I mean, it's embarrassing to
dialog: say it this way, but...
text: He stops. Her eyes WIDEN in a burlesque of anticipation. So he
text: smiles. She knows how to put him at ease.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You've sort of been... y'know,
dialog: the woman in my life.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (straight back)
dialog: You've been the man in mine.
text: Passing under the Michigan Avenue Bridge. No one knows quite what
dialog: to say.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And I was thinking this could be
dialog: our last time. Alone. Together.
dialog: You know?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Except for the hot affairs we'll
dialog: have twice a year.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Except for that.
text: She's smiling so easily. Who would guess her stomach is double-
dialog: knotted.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I can hardly wait for your
dialog: wedding.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Me either.
text: She watches his surprise.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Boy, I never thought I'd hear you
dialog: say that. Can I come?
dialog: She holds herself together. Real soft with...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I couldn't have it without you.
dialog: He's glad to hear that. And then...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It's normal to have... second
dialog: thoughts, huh? To be scared.
dialog: Is this a change of direction? Or is it the direction she's been
dialog: praying for.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I wouldn't know. I never had
dialog: that many first thoughts.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I mean, you commit to a wedding.
dialog: And then it seems like... this...
dialog: momentum, you know? You forget
dialog: you... chose it.
text: She nods. Understands.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You and I. I mean, in all our
dialog: relationships with other people...
dialog: We didn't use the word "love"
dialog: a lot, did we?
dialog: We didn't.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Kimmy says. When you love someone.
dialog: You say it, you say it out loud.
dialog: Right now. Or the moment...
dialog: Long beat.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: ... passes you by, yeah. She's a
dialog: smart girl.
text: Off in distance, the Centennial Fountain SHOOTS an eight-foot JET
dialog: of water across the river. For Michael and Julianne it goes
dialog: unnoticed.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: We don't have a song.
dialog: Hmm?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Kimmy and I. We don't have a song.
dialog: Is that a bad sign?
dialog: All Julianne can do is shrug. Then...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (sings, softly)
dialog: Someday, when I'm awfully low...
dialog: And the world is cold...
dialog: She doesn't want to cry. So she puts all the strength she has into
dialog: fighting it back.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (sings)
dialog: I will feel a glow just Thinking of you...
dialog: And the way you look. Tonight.
text: He stops. Smiles that sweet, boyish smile.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Dance card filled?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'll check. I have it on
dialog: powerbook, these days.
text: He holds up his arms. And she moves into them. He begins to dance
text: with her, turning so slowly. And, yes, people are watching.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (sings in her ear)
dialog: With each word, your tenderness grows,
dialog: Tearing my fears apart...
text: She holds him closer. Bites her lip.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (sings)
dialog: And that laugh
dialog: That wrinkles your nose,
dialog: Touches my foolish heart.
text: He stops. He looks at her. She's still in his arms.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Where did we first hear th...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (straight back)
dialog: The night we met.
dialog: Right to his eyes...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: The night we fell in love.
dialog: He doesn't know what to do with that.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: So we heard it... like, right
dialog: that... that first...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: We danced to it. Just like this.
dialog: Just like this. A long beat. And he has to say...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I won't lose you, will I?
text: Her eyes close. Then open. Utterly lost in his.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: No. Because I won't let you.
scene_heading: INT. WALLACE ENTERPRISES - DAY
text: Julianne in crisp chalk-stripe trousers and a buttoned-up dress
text: shirt. Her coat slung over her shoulder, she wanders through
text: the Saturday-deserted office space. Desks, cubicles, monitors,
text: silent. A row of executive offices standing empty, waiting for
text: the custodian. Turning a corner, we hear...
text: ... life, at the end of the hallway. A grand conference room with a
text: glass wall. Walter, in shirtsleeves, running a strategy meeting
text: for five. DEIDRE, his personal secretary, clicking every word into
text: her laptop at warp speed. Walter sees Julianne through the glass.
text: A comic take of pleased surprise. He comes out to greet her...
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I thought Michael was picking
dialog: me up.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I told him, get the important
dialog: stuff, Kim's ring. I'll collect
dialog: the inconsequentials.
dialog: Meaning, you. They smile at each other. Then...
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Kim said, when he turned down
dialog: the job, there was no friction.
text: Julianne thinks back.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Friction. No.
text: He smiles at her line reading. But his mind is always probing.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I haven't caused... a problem,
dialog: have I?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Nobody has. So far.
text: Her bright grin. His eyes linger on it.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Well, you're a little early...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I need to make some calls.
dialog: Could I use... your office?
scene_heading: INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Julianne enters the spacious corner office, high above the city.
text: Closes the door, quietly, behind her. So anxious, she is
text: practically hyperventilating. She goes, slowly to the vacant
text: cherrywood desk. Its computer and monitor standing silent. She
text: is stalking it, like a deadly animal. And then. She is there.
text: Talking to herself, her own desperate support network...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: You can do this.
text: Sacred, filled with doubt and conflict. Her hands clutch at each
text: other. Then, one flicks out. And the computer goes ON. The
text: screen GLOWS. Waits for her. Her mouth is sand, her stomach
text: water. She pulls the paper from her pocket...
text: ... looks at it. Looks to the monitor. And begins. To type...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (mumbling to herself)
dialog: E-mail address. To Ben Isaacson,
dialog: Senior Editor, Sports Illustrated,
dialog: from... Walter Wallace.
text: And stops. Her heart is thumping.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: See, you can do it. It's easy.
text: Doesn't look easy. Licks her lips.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You do it fast, it's over. Like
dialog: it never happened.
text: She sits. And recites as she types...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Ben. I need a favor.
dialog: Here we go. This is it. Types...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: My daughter's every happiness.
dialog: And my wife's. And, least of
dialog: all, my own, are in your hands.
dialog: Nods, okay. Breathing hard. Types...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Knowing you value our friendship,
dialog: and the... cooperative
dialog: relationship between our companies...
dialog: I am hopeful of your help.
dialog: Touch, that. Thinks. It has to be. Types...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I have offered Mike O'Neal, my
dialog: new son-in-law, a great opportunity
dialog: in my company. This would also
dialog: enable my daughter to settle in
dialog: Chicago, near us, and pursue her
dialog: dreams and plans.
dialog: Almost there. Almost. Types...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: To his own detriment, as well
dialog: as ours, Michael will not accept
dialog: our offer. While he works for you.
text: She stands up. Stares at the screen. Walks away. Walks back.
dialog: Still standing, types...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: My daughter joins me in this
dialog: plea for your cooperation and
dialog: discretion.
text: Is there a SOUND? Outside the door. She HOVERS over the ESCAPE
dialog: key. Waits. Waits. Silence. Types...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: With gratitude. For your
dialog: understanding. Walter.
text: She hits a KEY. The screen goes BLANK. The computer asks... DO
dialog: YOU WISH TO SEND? She tells the computer...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Are you crazy? Get him fired?
text: Types NO. The computer asks HOLD FOR LATER? And she types YES.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Just till tonight when I bring
dialog: him back. To look for...
text: She glances to her huge bag. Rummages through, pulling out a manila
text: folder. Lays it by the blank computer. Fans out a few pages in a
dialog: natural, disorderly way. Takes a step back...
text: And stares. Struck to her gut. But when she has done.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: Walter alone with Deidre now, signing a stack of documents, as she
text: efficiently places one after another before him. When he glances up,
text: he sees Julianne wandering the halls. Stands, tells his secretary...
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (going through stack)
dialog: Off to rehearsal. Send out this,
dialog: and this, not this, this, and...
dialog: that's it.
dialog: Slips on his coat. Oh... and by the way...
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm holding four or five E-mails
dialog: I wrote over lunch...
text: On his way through the door...
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Send 'em out.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - DAY
text: Julianne and Walter enter the rear of a striking Gothic CHAPEL,
text: pastel light slanting in through stained glass windows. We now
text: see the full effect of her outfit, a man's-style chalk stripe SUIT,
text: tailored to fit her body, set off by a bold silk tie. Solid
text: dynamite. She hangs back, while Walter proceeds down the vaulted
dialog: nave toward...
text: ... Michael, Kimmy, Isabelle and Joe, who stand casually joking by
text: the altar. Scattered around are assorted groomsmen, ushers, an
text: obvious flowergirl. Coming toward us, up the aisle...
text: ... the MINISTER, early 40s, lean and quite attractive. Mandy is
text: HANGING on his arm, pressing her body against him as they walk,
text: murmuring urgent murmurs close to his ear. He's a really good
text: sport, and really uncomfortable. Sammy is walking backwards,
text: right in front of them, DROPS her bag, and BENDS to retrieve it, as
text: if oblivious to major cleavage on immediate display.
text: Julianne is so lost in her own anxiety, she doesn't even notice,
dialog: until...
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: Reverend Dyer, this is
dialog: Kimberly's somewhat butch
dialog: maid of honor...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: ... Mr. Julianne Potter,
dialog: prominent New York drag queen.
text: Today, the girls' voices are charmingly musically Southern, with
dialog: none of the extreme accents we heard at the shower. The minister
text: extends his hand...
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Billy Dyer, Julianne. And I
dialog: love the suit.
text: She shakes his hand, smiles graciously, but her eyes flick to
text: Michael, now approaching up the aisle. The girls lead the minister
text: away. Michael arrives. Looks her up and down.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Takes me back.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Well.
text: She smiles. One that glows a little.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You sang the song. Least I
dialog: could do was wear the outfit.
dialog: He nods.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Except now you're better-
dialog: looking.
text: Oh, yeah? Yes, ma'am. As she loses herself in his eyes...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I got the ring.
text: He pulls the box from his pocket. Somewhere, an ORGAN sounds. And
text: as he is about to hand her the box...
speaker_heading: MANDY/SAMMY
dialog: (sing)
dialog: Swi-i-ng low-ow-ow...
dialog: Wee-ee-eet Char-i-ot...
text: Such exquisite two-part harmony, Michael stops to watch.
speaker_heading: MANDY/SAMMY
dialog: (sing)
dialog: Comin', to car-ryyy
dialog: Me ho-o-o-me...
text: It is amazing. Soulful vengeful sluts. He is enthralled. Julianne
text: simply impatient. She wants his attention.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: No accents today.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah, Kim told me they were
dialog: giving you their Dueling
dialog: Scarlet's act. Actually,
dialog: they're sophomores at Juilliard.
text: She takes the box from his hand. Opens it, as the singing CONTINUES
text: throughout. The ring is delicate hammered gold. One of a kind.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Will she like it?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: Yes.
text: She's staring at the ring.
speaker_heading: KIMMY (O.S.)
dialog: My groom-person! Your family
dialog: needs you!
text: His master's voice. He gives Julianne a smile. And goes. She's
text: left with the box.
text: Gazes at the ring. Lifts it out.
speaker_heading: MANDY/SAMMY
dialog: (O.S., singing)
dialog: Well, I look over yon-der,
dialog: And what did I see-ee-ee?
text: Slips it on her left hand. Ring finger.
speaker_heading: MANDY/SAMMY
dialog: (O.S., singing)
dialog: Comin too car-ryyy.
dialog: Me ho-o-ome...
text: Touches it. Turns it on her finger. So many emotions.
speaker_heading: MANDY/SAMMY
dialog: (O.S., singing)
dialog: It was a hand. Of a-a-angels.
dialog: Coming' for me-e-ee...
text: Tries to pull it off.
speaker_heading: MANDY/SAMMY
dialog: (O.S., singing)
dialog: Comin' for to carry me home.
dialog: It won't come. Not even close.
scene_heading: INT. CRAB HOUSE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE on a bowl filled with squares of butter. HEAR the butt of
text: conversation from a rowdy, friendly joint. Julianne's right hand
text: REACHES to the bowl, fingers trace the rim innocently, then...
text: ... SLIDE the bowl into Julianne's lap beneath the table. Her right
dialog: hand MASSAGES all the butter into a gooey revolving mess. We can
text: pick out familiar voices now, family in distance, the twins closer.
text: As, hidden from view, Julianne brings...
text: ... her left hand from her pocket. Yep. The ring is still there.
text: The finger already red and swollen from pacicky efforts to pull it
text: off. And as APPLAUSE surrounds us, Julianne...
text: PLUNGES her ring finger into the morass of grease, frantically
text: TEARING at the ring, butter SPLURGING on her pants, everywhere, as
dialog: we PULL BACK to see...
text: ... the long table covered with butcher paper, the family at the far
dialog: end, the twins down here with us, a mug of beer for each place, as
text: team of waiters with heaping platters of CRABS, which they...
text: ... FLING across the butcher paper, as APPLAUSE continues from
text: everyone but Julianne, who still struggles secretly. As the waiters
text: set huge wooden MALLETS in front of each guest, Joe O'Neal rises,
text: POUNDS the table with his mallet for attention.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Like to welcome ever'body to
dialog: our little rehearsal supper...
text: He COUGHS, unaccustomed to public speaking. Walter and Isabelle
text: clap and call out support. So Joe lifts his mallet...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Okay, everyone stand up!
dialog: And everyone does. With one exception. Trapped. She JAMS her
text: left hand in her coat pocket, SMEARS her right palm sort of clean
text: on the underside of the table, GRABS her mallet and JUMPS UP.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: To the bride, uh, goes the
dialog: honor... of cracking the first
dialog: crab!
text: Everyone applauses by banging their mallets. Joe RAISES his high.
text: Everybody imitates.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: But first, a toast!
text: And everybody SNATCHES up their beers with their left hands, as
text: Julianne DROPS her mallet with a HORRIFIC CRASH, grabbing her beer,
dialog: looking up to...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (on the spot)
dialog: I'm right-handed.
text: A hugely embarrassing half-second. Bailed out by...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: To our host, my cuddly Papa
dialog: Joe.
dialog: All turns.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Who taught me to play "Blue
dialog: Hawaii." On my nose.
text: With a look at Julianne, Kim sets down her mallet gently, and
text: performs a nasal HUM of the tropical standard, strikingly her nostril
text: repeatedly for vibrato. It is charming, and everybody watches.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - LATER
text: CLOSE on an actual, living, if geriatric, LION. He blinks from his
text: cage, bored as hell. HEAR the surrounding noise, chatter, LOUD
dialog: Sinatra music, of a very large party. PULL BACK to see...
text: ... and overdecorated BALLROOM, in dim and dramatic lighting,
text: dripping with the trappings of ANCIENT ROME. The mingling guests
dialog: are the neatly one hundred females of the wedding party, most of
text: them older women. They are served by wandering well-built ATHLETES
dialog: in Roman togas or gladiator costumes. PAN TO...
text: ... Julianne, still in her suit, hiding by a table piled with a
text: carload of grapes. Her left hand still buried in her pocket. The
text: eyes of a hunted animal. From nowhere...
speaker_heading: MANDY/SAMMY (O.S.)
dialog: Boo!!!
text: She JUMPS a foot, both hands FLYING UP, left one awkwardly slamming
text: back into its pocket. The girls have snuck up behind her. They
dialog: have changed into hot gowns that are really only wide ribbons
dialog: wrapped around their bodies.
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: I know why you're scared of our

speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Kimberly wanted to tickle the
dialog: grandmas, so we figured, give
dialog: 'em a cheap thrill. Walter
dialog: supplied the decorative
dialog: touches...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: (points out the jokes)
dialog: Nose tackle from the Bears...
dialog: power forward from the Bulls...
dialog: defenseman from the Black
dialog: Hawks... my personal favorite,
dialog: the designated hitter...
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: ... I'm partial to the tight end.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: This is USDA Prime, largely
dialog: available, beef. With no notice-
dialog: able competition, present company
dialog: excepted...
text: Now they stare at her. With identical, really odd, smiles.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: And yet here you are. All
dialog: celibate and reclusive.
speaker_heading: MANDY
text: With those big, dark, haunted eyes.
dialog: As if you were harborin' some...
dialog: unspeakably... guilty... secret.
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Well, I'm worried about something.
text: Something. Their expressions are deliciously, identically
dialog: expectant.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Oh. I left this really important
dialog: file in Walter's office. I have
dialog: to send my editor some...
dialog: Some...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... figures. On territorial sales.
dialog: To close my book deal.
dialog: Uh-huh...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: So Kim gave me the key. And
dialog: Michael's on his way, to drive
dialog: me down to Wal...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Oh. We thought it was the ring.
dialog: Julianne blinks. Ring...?
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: The one you better get the fuck
dialog: off your third finger left hand.
dialog: Ah. That ring.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Well. See. That was a...
dialog: reflex to see if it would...
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: (helpful)
dialog: ... look good on Kimberly.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Right. And then it didn't want
dialog: to come off. Exactly.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Maybe it's happy there.
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: Oh the way out of the crab house?
dialog: We asked Michael if we could see
dialog: the ring?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: He said you told him. It'd be
dialog: safer with you.
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: An so it is.
dialog: Julianne for once is speechless. To our amazement, the girls wear
text: identical smiles of kindness and support.
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: Shut up, sugar, he's on his way.
dialog: Let's get to work.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Huge gleaming chaotic kitchen. Cooks, waiters, working at top
text: speed. The three women RACE in, look around frantically, half the
text: guys stop to ogle the twins. CUT TO...
text: ANGLES... and industrial-sized jar of peanut butter. Julianne's hand
text: PLUNGES in, halfway to the rolled-up sleeve at her elbow. SMOOCHES
dialog: it around, real good. PULL BACK to reveal...
text: ... she is surrounded by the twins and six guys, all SHOUTING
text: conflicting instructions. Julianne FLINGS off the excess SLOP.
dialog: Tugs for all she's worth...
speaker_heading: EIGHT PEOPLE
dialog: TWIST IT! TWIST IT!
text: Nada. It won't budge. A sous chef WIPES her hand with a towel, a
text: janitor CRASHES a tool kit onto the counter. THROWS it open, pulls
dialog: out...
text: ... a spray can of WD-40. Instantly, her hand is BLACK. The guy TUGS.
dialog: No movement. He can't believe it.
speaker_heading: JANITOR
dialog: It's mental, lady, you ain't
dialog: trying!
text: Sammy is rummaging through her handbag, pulling out...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: There is nothing so tight, this
dialog: can't help it...
text: ... a tube of jelly. The letter K-Y. Julianne just gives her a look.
text: Mandy pushes through with a butcher's CLEAVER...
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: I saw this on Hard Copy. People
dialog: cut off body parts and the
dialog: hospital sew 'em back o...
text: The look has turned toward her.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (cold)
dialog: I saw the show.
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: ... well, maybe it works on
dialog: fingers, too.
speaker_heading: FLOWER GIRL (O.S.)
dialog: Aunt Mandy...?
text: Everybody turns. The little girl in the doorway. Southern accent...
speaker_heading: FLOWER GIRL
dialog: Mr. Michael's here.
text: Everything gets real quiet. Mandy takes charge. She rolls down
text: Julianne's left sleeve, RIPS the hem out of the cuff, so that it
text: flaps down over her hand, covering the ring. Sammy wipes the black
text: stuff from Julianne's fingers.
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: Don't worry, baby. You could
dialog: pick your nose with that finger
dialog: and Michael would never notice.
dialog: He's a man.
dialog: The twins lead her off. We're on their backs for...
speaker_heading: MANDY (O.S.)
dialog: Personally, I think Mr. Michael's
dialog: marrying the wrong girl.
speaker_heading: SAMMY (O.S.)
dialog: You're much more his type.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT
text: VIEW through a heavy glass door of the empty, dimly-lit lobby.
text: PULL BACK to see Julianne, just as she...
text: ... KICKS the shit out of the glass! Almost breaks her foot.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I can't believe this!
text: PULL BACK farther to see Michael still trying keys from a large key
text: ring in the heavy lock. Sign over the door says WALLACE ENTERPRISES.
text: Traffic hustles by, oblivious to her suffering.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It's no big deal, she just gave
dialog: you the wrong keys that's s...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ISN'T THERE A GUARD? A JANITOR?
dialog: A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL
scene_heading: TAKE A BURGLAR! SOMEBODY'S
text: GOTTA BE IN TH...
text: And she SLAMS her whole BODY against the glass, making it rattle ominously.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: WHERE'S A BRICK? FIND ME A
speaker_heading: GODDAMN BRICK!!
text: She looks around wildly, hysterical.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What is the big deal about
dialog: getting this file tonight?
dialog: A good question. She needs a good answer.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I promised Digger I'd E-mail him
dialog: those figures.
dialog: From his face, that wasn't it.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: They are very important figures.
text: Apparently. He's just staring at her.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'm up against a deadline.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Me, too. I'm getting married
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: That's my point!!
dialog: Now. He really doesn't get it.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I mean, tomorrow... we'll all be
dialog: busy with more important things.
dialog: So...
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... tonight's my last chance.
text: He sighs.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I forgot how cute you look. When
dialog: you get impossible.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: It's just... up there... right in
dialog: front of Walter's... y'know, computer.
dialog: If memory serves.
dialog: Helpless.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: We could use... his computer, to...
dialog: just E-mail those suckers right ou...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Tomorrow is Sunday. Nobody's doing
dialog: business. Crack of dawn, Monday,
dialog: Walter'll take you up there...
text: Her eyes fill with tears. He is mystified. Smiles tenderly.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Give it up, kid.
text: Touches her hair.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You can't win 'em all.
text: And slowly, he takes her hand. Leads her way. She takes one
text: backward glance at the locked door. Her last dream dies.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY, RITZ CARLTON - NIGHT
text: Michael and a disconsolate Julianne board the elevator. He presses
text: 15, she pushes 11. Michael carries a handful of messages slips and
text: an envelope. As the car starts up, she folds her arms across her
text: chest, at the edge of tears. He doesn't know what to do.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Listen up, huh? Even if you blow
dialog: this deal, how big could it be?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (voice nearly cracking)
dialog: You're right. Easy come, easy go.
text: He's really concerned, can't bear to see her so upset.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Jules?
text: She won't look at him. She wants to die. The bell RINGS, the doors
text: open to her floor. She just walks out.
text: And he follows. They stand now, she with her arms crossed, lip
text: trembling. She can't believe how close she is to losing it.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: This thing means that much to
dialog: y...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: It means a lot.
dialog: He nods. Okay.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'll call the house, Walter's
dialog: probably not even asleep...
text: Her mouth drops. She can't believe this.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'll drive you out there, we'll
dialog: get the key, we'll go back to
dialog: the office...
text: She THROWS her arms around his, HUGGING him so hard, so close. He
text: laughs, she is so weird. She pulls back, beaming, glowing.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Come on, we'll call from your
dialog: room.
text: She claps his hand. As they head down the hall...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: If I fall asleep on the altar
dialog: tomorrow...
text: He's trying to flip through the message slips in his free hand...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: ... you better be there to...
dialog: funny, these are all from Ben.
text: She's at her door, turning the key. He looks at the envelope.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The fax is from Ben, too. Man,
dialog: it's my wedding, and my boss can't
dialog: leave me alone...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (entering her room)
dialog: ... maybe it's congratulations.
text: He follows her in, opening the envelope. Stops. Reads. And his face
text: suddenly... freezes. To stone.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (turning to him)
dialog: Michael? What ha...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Mike. I can't believe I'm doing
dialog: this to you on the night before
dialog: your wedding. But I think you
dialog: need and deserve to know...
text: And he looks up to her.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: ... what you're marrying into.
text: He hands it toward her. She takes it, hesitantly, and he walks past.
dialog: Toward the phone.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (reading)
dialog: I received the following E-mail
dialog: this afternoon... "Ben, I need a
dialog: favor. My daughter's every
dialog: happiness... "
text: Her eyes BUG OUT of her head. Holy shit! We can hear him DIALING the
dialog: phone. She keeps reading, it's all there. How did this happen?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
dialog: Isabelle? I need to talk to
dialog: Kim...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "Mike, the funny thing is, he's
dialog: offering you a gig you'd be
dialog: stupid to turn down..."
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
dialog: I'm just tired. Please put her
dialog: on? Thanks.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "Maybe you should take the job.
dialog: And dump the girl."
dialog: And when she turns...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Jules. Could you give me a
dialog: minute?
text: He looks more sick than angry. As if the heart has just been cut
text: out of him. She doesn't know what to say or do, so she just stands,
text: staring dumbly.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Please?
text: She nods, stumbles out of her room, closing the door behind her.
text: Now she's in the empty corridor, clutching her big jumbled bag,
text: sinking down to sit on the carpet, her back against the door.
text: She doesn't look elated. She seems frightened, distraught, and
text: most of all, confused. Because she can't understand why. She digs
text: absently through her bag. Cigarettes. Box of matches.
text: She lights up. Draws deeply. Somehow, she seems near tears, and
text: laughs bitterly at that. Shakes her head at how fucked-up she finds
text: herself. Squeaking wheels approach, but she is too lost to hear them.
speaker_heading: BELLMAN
dialog: Miss, are you locked out,
dialog: or something?
text: She looks up. A small, wiry man of nearly 60, in a slightly faded
text: but neatly-kept uniform. On his cart, a ton of bags.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: No, I just stepped out, because...
dialog: it's a non-smoking room.
text: And inhales deeply. Leans back against the door, to look up at him
dialog: more comfortably.
speaker_heading: BELLMAN
dialog: (politely)
dialog: Well, it's non-smoking floor,
dialog: too. Maybe you could go to the...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (seriously)
dialog: Why don't you have me arrested?
dialog: That wasn't sarcastic. He doesn't know what to say.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I mean that. Arrested, convicted,
dialog: put in solitary.
dialog: Another puff.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: See, I'm a dangerous, criminal
dialog: person. I do bad things to
dialog: honest people. This, see, this
dialog: smoking? Tip of the iceberg.
text: Waves her hand.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Make a citizen's arrest, I won't
dialog: struggle. It'll be like getting
dialog: Al Capone on tax evasion.
text: Now she seems angry. But not at him. Her eyes fill with tears.
speaker_heading: BELLMAN
dialog: Can I... Can I help you, miss?
text: She squints at his nameplate.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Do you smoke, Richard?
speaker_heading: BELLMAN
dialog: Yes, ma'am, I do, but it's...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... a non-smoking floor, yeah.
dialog: Well, you know what?
text: And she takes the cigarette from her lips. Turns it around, holds
dialog: it out to him. Go ahead. He doesn't move. Please! And so...
text: ... he reaches down, takes the cigarette from her hand. Staring in
text: her eyes, he takes a deep drag. Savors an expert nostril-inhale of
text: his exhaled smoke. Hands the cigarette back to her...
speaker_heading: BELLMAN
dialog: My grandmother always said,
dialog: "This, too, shall pass."
text: She swallows. Wipes at her eyes. Finds a smile.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Thanks, Richard. If you weren't
dialog: on duty, I'd buy you a drink.
text: He just nods. She waves. He waves back, pushes his cart down the
text: hall. As she watches him go, the door behind her suddenly OPENS,
dialog: and she...
text: ... FALLS through it, flat on her back at Michael's feet. Staring up
text: at him, seeing that he looks as bad as she feels, she takes raw, deep
dialog: drag.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (softly)
text: It's over.
text: And crouches down. Close beside her. The cigarette drops from her
text: hand, unnoticed on the carpet. So he lifts it, crushes it on the
text: heel of his shoe.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I want you to quit this shit,
dialog: it'll kill you.
dialog: She just nods, obediently. Okay, I will.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: She denied it. Said I was crazy
dialog: and paranoid.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: A bad combination.
text: He tries to smile. It's really hard.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: There's this big brunch tomorrow
dialog: morning? At her place.
text: He lets the air out. Slow. So he won't cry.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: She said "How can I call everything
dialog: off, what do I tell everybody?"
dialog: Shakes his head. Can you imagine that?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Michael...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No, it's for the best, it really
dialog: is. We were so wrong for each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The job thing would have broken
dialog: us up, eventually, anyway. She
dialog: couldn't have lived with it. I
dialog: know that now.
dialog: Julianne nods. Maybe that part is right. Maybe it would have
dialog: ended anyway. Maybe she can pretend she's not a monster.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And she's right, I'm crazy to
dialog: fall for someone. I hardly
dialog: knew.
text: Looks deep in her eyes. He's so glad she's there.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hey. You still got that ring?
text: She holds up her left hand, the flapping sleeve falls away. The
text: ring is on a finger that is swollen and raw.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I tried it on. But it won't
dialog: come off.
text: He smiles at that. A sad smile of friendship. Then takes her
dialog: finger gently...
dialog: ... into his mouth. It is something like a kiss. And when he
text: removes her moistened finger...
text: ... he pulls the ring OFF. Nothing to it. She blinks.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: It's mental, you know.
dialog: He doesn't understand that.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Should we take a walk? Or
dialog: maybe some food sent up, or
dialog: something...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I just want to be alone. Is
dialog: that okay?
text: She nods, sure. He kisses her cheek. Stands up.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Maybe I'll go back to New York.
dialog: Hang with you for awhile, huh?
dialog: Ben'll understand.
text: She nods again. Whatever you say. He steps into the open doorway...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Or we'll go somewhere. If you
dialog: have the time.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: If San Antonio sweeps
dialog: Sacramento...
text: They smiles at each other. For real.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I've never been to Texas.
text: Imagine that. The look holds. Just above a whisper...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Thanks for coming to my wedding.
dialog: And then he's gone.
scene_heading: IN.JULIANNE'S BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT
text: Julianne brushing out her hair in the bathroom mirror, eyeing her
text: image with evident dissatisfaction, as she listens to the receiver
speaker_heading: RINGING.
speaker_heading: DIGGER (V.O. MACHINE)
dialog: Digger and George are with
dialog: family in the Hamptons until
dialog: Monday morning. Brevity is even
dialog: more in order than usual.
speaker_heading: BEEP.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Hey, handsome. Brevity this...
text: Her eyes find the pack of cigarettes. Next to her toiletries kit.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I won.
text: Her fingers touch the pack. As if an object of significance. Takes
dialog: it up.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Amazing, huh? I didn't do things
dialog: quite your way. But... I got it
dialog: down.
text: Cradling the phone against her shoulder, she carefully tears the top
text: of the pack completely open.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: And forty years and nine grand-
dialog: children later, when I sit with
dialog: Michael on some rustic porch,
dialog: slogging through our sweet swamp
dialog: of nostalgic memories...
text: Reaches the pack toward the toilet.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: No one is going to sweet the
dialog: details...
text: Turns it upside down, emptying a dozen cigarettes into the john.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Of one weekend in Chicago.
text: Drops the lid with a CLATTER. Hits the FLUSH.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Talk about celebration...
text: She lifts a tube from her toiletries kit. Stares at it, real
dialog: close.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'm gonna brush my teeth with
dialog: actual toothpaste.
text: Turns it over, reads all the writing. Yep.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I guess I'm too exhausted to
dialog: feel the elation I so richly
dialog: undeserve...
text: Squeezes some paste onto her brush. Carefully.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: So I'm gonna hold calls at the
dialog: desk... while I get my...
dialog: Start brushing.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (around, her mouthful)
dialog: God, it is toothpaste, they
dialog: should sell this stuff
dialog: commercially! Anyway, a girl
dialog: does need her...
text: Squints at her image. Laughs, spewing a little foam.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... well, we're a bit past
dialog: worrying about beauty sleep.
dialog: Let's just settle for not
dialog: frightening small animals.
text: She SPITS. Tells Digger's machine...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Anyway, I couldn't have done
dialog: it without you. Even though I
dialog: did, if you follow that.
text: Wipes her mouth. Stares off. The eyes a little dreamy.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Three words: Happily. Ever.
dialog: Well, you know.
speaker_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Julianne sprawled all over the bed, mouth open like a carp,
text: sleeping mask against the daylight. A sudden RAPPING at the
dialog: door, and she...
text: ... sits BOLT UPRIGHT. Utterly disoriented, until she pulls off
text: the mask. Stumbles out of bed, walking toward the firm KNOCKING,
dialog: when...
text: ... it stops. A message slip SLIDES beneath her door. She lifts
text: it, barely conscious. This wakes her up. In one.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (to the slip)
dialog: You're going where?
scene_heading: EXT. WALLACE ESTATE - DAY
text: Julianne climbs from her taxi. Only slightly in awe, she sets off
text: past the reflecting pool, which fronts a mansion of graceful stone
dialog: and timber. It's a hike today, because the circular drives is
text: clogged deep with Bentleys, Mercedes, and waiting limos, vying for
dialog: space with a score of delivery vehicles of all kinds, maintenance
text: trucks, catering and florist and food vans.
scene_heading: INT. GREAT ROOM - DAY
text: Julianne escorted into an enormous room, where brunch is in
text: progress for more than a hundred. She looks from the vaulted
text: ceilings, to the frescoed walls, the inlaid floors, the massive
text: pipe organ above the stone staircase, the oil portraits of Scottish
dialog: ancestors and their favorite dogs.
text: Isabelle has risen from the main table, and comes to her. All
dialog: smiles. Julianne is in the Twilight Zone. What are these people
dialog: laughing about? Do they still think there's a wedding?
speaker_heading: ISABELLE
dialog: Jules. We're so glad you
dialog: slept in.
text: Takes her arm graciously. This woman would make Anne Bancroft look
dialog: coarse. As they walk...
speaker_heading: ISABELLE
dialog: Now, you have a choice. The idea
dialog: is bride and groom shouldn't see
dialog: each other on the magic day...
dialog: Julianne looking all around. Magic day it seems to be. Where the
dialog: bell is a bride or a groom?
speaker_heading: ISABELLE
text: So Michael stays put in the garden.
dialog: Kimmy stays in here...
text: Pointing. THERE she is, obscured by a cluster of the appropriately
text: fawning. She has the same hunted eyes and false, slightly manic
dialog: smile Julianne wore yesterday. This, at least, makes sense.
speaker_heading: ISABELLE (O.S.)
dialog: ... and the guests go back and
dialog: forth. Where will you start?
text: CLOSE on Julianne. Watching the brave, frightened bride.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
text: She looks tense.
speaker_heading: ISABELLE
dialog: (O.S., calmly)
dialog: Nerves. I would never have
dialog: guessed.
scene_heading: EXT. ROSE GARDEN - DAAY
text: A steward leads Julianne to the edge of an expansive rose garden,
text: altogether elegant and comfortable with its long white picnic
text: tables, where nearly a hundred guests casually dine, served by
text: rolling carts.
text: There, at the head table, Michael staring at us. He looks like a
text: poor attempt to cover a hard night. She locks onto his eyes. What
text: the hell is going on? He looks helpless, miserable. She gestures
text: with her head, follow me. Stalks off.
scene_heading: EXT. SCULPTURE GARDEN - DAY
text: Bronze abstract pieces, some quite large, face a huge set of
text: children's swings, regulation playground size. Julianne sits in
text: one, moving slightly back and forth. Trying to hold on to her
dialog: temper and her sanity.
text: In the distance, trucks are winding their way to and from the pond,
text: where crews are setting up tents, lights, heaters for tonight. The
text: circus has come to town. When she looks back...
text: Michael approaches. Before he can draw a breath...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I had the craziest dream last
dialog: night? Walter and Kimmy had
dialog: asked your boss to...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Look, I came down here to face
dialog: everybody. I didn't want to
dialog: slink away like some coward...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: But the Scotch salmon was so
dialog: fucking good, you decided to
dialog: stay for brunch!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: She hasn't told anybody, what
dialog: am I supposed to do?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Get married, apparently.
text: She comes OFF the swing, PUSHES him back two feet.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: What the hell are you thinking
dialog: of, the goddamn wedding is SIX
dialog: O'CLOCK!!
text: He swallows hard. Trapped.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: This is her family and her
dialog: fault.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: And your point?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (ten years old)
dialog: Well. How come she didn't...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
scene_heading: BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS
dialog: YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR
speaker_heading: EACH OTHER.
text: He just blinks.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hey. This is a serious matter.
dialog: Thank you. She POKES his chest, punctuating...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'll be right back.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: A modern take on the Medieval castle kitchen, towering ceilings,
text: dark wood, copper pots hanging, a series of walk-in coolers and
text: freezers. The place is a madhouse of activity, as prep cooks
dialog: slice, chop, sort, every kind of food imaginable, and delivery
dialog: teams bring more.
text: The girls walk through. Alone together in the eye of the
dialog: hurricane. Kim choked with excess sentiment...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Look at all this beautiful food,
dialog: so lovingly prepared...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: They'll eat it anyway, you ever
dialog: been to a walk?
text: Kimmy's lip trembles. This is not how she thought of her wedding.
text: The din is so horrific, Kimmy leads them into a walk-in meat
text: locker. Even here, two BUTCHERS are dressing Eastern-fresh corn-
dialog: fed carcasses.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You guys want to give us a
dialog: minute?
text: The men blink at each other.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: We'd like to be alone with
dialog: our pork.
text: On that basis. They leave. Kimmy sits on a stack of packaged

speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: How's he doing?
dialog: Julianne cannot believe this.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Who? The jerk who's running
dialog: your life?
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: This must be... very, very,
text: hard on him.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: What with the psychosis and
dialog: all, yeah.
dialog: Leans in. Listen...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: When are you gonna come clean
dialog: with your folks?
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Don't you see...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: If you're waiting for "Do you
dialog: take this man?", that's
dialog: considered poor form.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: ... that this is all my fault?
dialog: Stops Julianne cold. Your fault.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Whatever delusions I drove him to,
dialog: there is truth at the heart of it.
dialog: I want him to work for my father.
dialog: I want to stay in school. I want
dialog: a life of my own!
text: Harder and harder for Julianne to push. Her mouth is dry.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Yeah, well, lots of couples are
dialog: imcompat...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: I love him.
text: Fragile and strong at once. A plea.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Tell him it's my fault and
dialog: that I love him.
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'll be right back.
scene_heading: EXT. TENNIS COURT - DAY
text: The court has become a giant holding pen for tonight's BALLOONS.
text: There are maybe a billion in assorted colors already blowing in all
text: directions, under clear plastic sheeting which has ben spread
text: across the top of the court's chain-link fence.
text: Michael stands outside the court, clutching the chain link like a
text: prisoner, as Julianne comes through the gate. From somewhere, we
text: hear high, squeaky, alien voice-like SOUNDS. Incongruous
dialog: against...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: How is she?
text: Julianne absorbs this. As the bizarre SOUNDS continue, she WHIRLS
dialog: around...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: KNOCK IT OFF!!!
text: We now see three STONER COLLEGE GUYS, who have been filling the
text: endless array of balloons from helium tanks at center court.
dialog: Clearly, they've been inhaling their working materials.
speaker_heading: STONER KID
dialog: (Minnie Mouse)
speaker_heading: YES, SIR!
text: A Nazi salute. When she turns back...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I asked you...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: She admits it's her fault.
dialog: He absorbs that. And then...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Do you think she still loves
dialog: me?
text: We watch the struggle inside her. Her voice drops...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Sure, she does. She's crazy
dialog: about you.
text: Now tears stand in both their eyes. The stoners are doing their
text: Alvin and the Chipmuks impersonation festival in the B.G., singing
dialog: in castrato harmony. But our two don't notice.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I keep asking, how can I explain
dialog: what happened? And I keep
dialog: getting that same answer all
dialog: night long.
dialog: Which is...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I can't. And it doesn't matter.
dialog: I drove her to it, because I
dialog: want things my way. And even
dialog: if she did something tricky and
dialog: unfair... she was blinded by
dialog: love, okay?
text: Julianne swallows. For obvious reasons.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Does that make it right...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Love doesn't have to be right.
dialog: It just has to be love.
text: The stoner are now helium-crooning "Bridge Over Troubled Waters."
dialog: Actually, they're getting better.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: She's giving up half her life
dialog: for me, and I'm bitching because
dialog: it hurts her.
speaker_heading: STONERS
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Sail on silver girl
dialog: Sail on by...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: She's a saint! And I'm a
dialog: worthless ingrate!
speaker_heading: STONERS
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Your time has come to shine,
dialog: All your dreams are on their way...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Tell her. I'll marry her at six
dialog: o'clock, if she'll still have me.
text: The stoners blend on the high note. It's pretty moving.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'll be right back.
scene_heading: INT. ORGAN LOFT - DAY
text: PAN along a gigantic serpentine stack of wedding presents. Nearly
text: twelve feet high, the pile curves along the balcony, high above the
text: diners in the Great Room, extending al the way to...
text: ... an organ loft. Alone, above the noise of the party, Julianne
text: and Kimmy have just reached the top of the staircase. Trapped
text: between ten tons of lavish gifts and the keyboard of the mammoth
text: organ. Dwarfed by their surroundings, Kimmy draws the hardest
dialog: breath of her life...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: So. What did he say?
text: Julianne's eyes move over the young girl's face.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: He said. Marry me.
text: Kimmy YELPS in her ecstasy, FLINGING herself against Julianne, and
text: they go DOWN full length across the organ's pedals, BLASTING the
text: room with a MONSTER CHORD of china-rattling volume and horrifying
dialog: disharmony.
text: As grown men and women SCREAM in spontaneous terror below, Kimmy
dialog: begins to...
text: ... LAUGH. And KISS and hug her new sister. And holds her tight.
scene_heading: EXT. WILLOW POND - DAY
text: Julianne and Michael walk the gravel path beside a breathtaking
text: POND, ringed with WILLOWS that dig heavy branches to the water's
text: surface. He is relieved, reflective. Head down, he never notices
dialog: that she is...
text: ... dangerously freaked. Too petrified even to hyperventilate,
text: we're lucky she's breathing at all. We watch her life unraveling
text: before her glassy eyes.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (never looks up)
dialog: Thank God you were here.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (mumbles to herself)
dialog: Oh, yeah.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I was so confused, so conflicted,
dialog: so... unstable.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Well, it happens.
text: They pass an expanse of lawn which has become the event parking
text: area. Family vehicles, delivery trucks, service vans. Everything
text: that couldn't fit on the circular front driveway.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I might have thrown away...
dialog: Searching for the right words.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... your one chance for true
dialog: happiness?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: ... yeah, that.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You never want to do that, see,
dialog: that's always a... costly
dialog: turnover. As they say in the
dialog: sport biz.
text: There's a vague Stepford Wife quality to her voice. He hears that
text: now, and looks at her. Maybe he can't tell she's frightened. But
dialog: he can tell she's something.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Are you okay?
text: She stops walking. She can't look at him, so she looks around.
text: Across the lawn crews are moving equipment into the brightly-
text: colored tents, unfolding and setting up stacks of tables and
dialog: chairs, raising the poles between which all those balloons will be
text: strung. At the center of it all...
text: .... a huge topiary White Sox batter, just completing a murderous
text: swing. He's maybe fifteen feet tall. She points to it...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: The Big Hurt, huh?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Nellie Fox. Walter likes the
dialog: past. And he likes the little
dialog: guys.
text: So Julianne nods. Because she does too. Squints up at Michael.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Got a minute?
dialog: He nods, you bet. Worried for her. What is this? She looks in
dialog: another direction, and we now see that we have nearly reached...
text: ... a stage that's been set up for the band. Chairs, music stands,
text: sound equipment. A gleaming dance floor, already in place over the
text: lawn. Next to it, a shimmering white GAZEBO. Like the centerpiece
dialog: of a wedding cake.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Why is the dance floor by the
dialog: gazebo?
text: She takes his hand. They walk toward it.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Kimmy's idea. She thought it
dialog: would be such a romantic place.
dialog: For our wedding dance.
text: Looking down at her.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Shhh.
text: Up the white steps now. Together. The gazebo floor has been
text: covered with hardwood. The perfect place. For a wedding dance.
dialog: And Julianne...
text: ... turns, suddenly. He almost runs into her. She is staring up
text: at him, so strangely, their bodies only inches apart. He is caught,
text: transfixed by the intensity in her eyes.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I have to say this quick, okay,
dialog: or I'll have this massive
dialog: coronary and you'll never have
dialog: to hear it. Which you need to.
dialog: Does that make any sense at all?
dialog: The coronary part does. We can feel her heart beating from here.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Jules, what's wrong...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: This is the dumbest thing I will
dialog: ever do. So dumb, in fact, that
dialog: I can't. I don't think.
text: And then, she does. She puts her hands flat on his chest. Looks
text: in his eyes.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Michael, I love you.
text: A heartbeat passes.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I've loved you for nine years,
dialog: but I was too arrogant and
dialog: scared to realize it. Now I'm
dialog: just scared.
text: He stares at her, dumbstruck. She moves even closer.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I know this comes at an
dialog: inopportune time, but I have to
dialog: ask this one really gigantic
dialog: favor, okay?
text: Holds her breath. And...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Choose me. Marry me. Let me
dialog: make you happy.
text: And in a half beat of excruciating silence...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I know. It sounds like three
dialog: favors.
text: His eyes are loving. They care for her. She swallows, lost in
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: But when you think about it...
text: Slides her arms around his neck, and raises her mouth...
dialog: ... to his. The most beautiful kiss she will ever offer. All of
text: her heart is in this, and as his hands touch her body...
text: ... a SCREAM rips the world to pieces. They whirl to see...
text: ... KIMMY, halfway up the path. Her hands across her mouth, as if
text: to stem the horror that pours forth as she SHRIEKS from her soul,
dialog: and...
text: ... runs. Back Down the path. Michael BOLTING after her, SHOUTING
text: her name. A frozen moment, and...
text: ... Julianne TAKES OFF after him. All three running, SCREAMING
text: their various emotions at the top of their lungs, as workmen stop
dialog: to watch from neighboring countries.
text: Kimmy, staring from halfway there, has an insurmountable lead.
text: LEAPS into her convertible and PEELS OUT, just TEARING up the
text: gravel as she ROCKETS out of sight. No way to catch her. Still...
text: ... Michael is racing for the cars. Julianne, sprinting her guts
text: out, losing ground with every stride. Michael JUMPS into a
dialog: Cherokee...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: MICHAEL, DON'T, YOU'LL NEVER
dialog: CATCH HER!!
text: He GRINDS the gears. She keeps RUNNING. His engine FIRES.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: SHE HAS TOO BIG A LEAD AND SHE
dialog: DRIVES LIKE A RABID ANIMAL!!!
text: He BLASTS OFF. She keeps going. Gasping for air, clutching her side,
text: she's dying here. Slams into a florist's truck, looks inside, shit!
text: Next, a butcher's van, looks inside, Jesus!
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (to the world at large)
text: DOESN'T ANYBODY LEAVE KEYS
dialog: ANYMORE? WHATEVER HAPPENED TO
speaker_heading: TRUST??
text: Up ahead, Michael has STALLED the Cherokee. She still has a chance,
text: DASHES to the next van. BORNSTEIN EXTERMINATION, a handsome
text: rendering of a rat above the TOXIC MATERIALS warning FLINGS the
text: door open. Stumbles in. Keys!
speaker_heading: JULIANNE (O.S.)
dialog: THANK GOD, A SAMARITAN!!
text: Michael SPEEDS away. She KICKS the ratmobile in gear.
text: LURCHES off.
scene_heading: INT. RATMOBILE, DOWNTOWN CHICAGO - DAY
text: Julianne tearing through traffic, desperately struggling to keep
text: Michael's Cherokee in view, while she shrieks into her cellular...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: IT IS NOT GOING WELL!
text: Down the block, Michael WHIPS around a corner. We follow suit to see
text: his destination dead ahead. Union Station. The DISPATCHER RADIO
dialog: intrudes...
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER (O.S.)
dialog: Uh, Unit Four Baker Charlie,
dialog: how we cookin' on that Skokiie
dialog: infestation?
text: Now she's steering the car, tearing at the radio controls, and
text: screaming into the phone cradled on her shoulder...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
text: THIS IS WHAT COMES OF TELLING
speaker_heading: THE TRUTH!
speaker_heading: FIELD MAN (O.S.)
dialog: Copy, dispatcher...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: OR EVEN PART OF IT!
speaker_heading: FIELD MAN (O.S.)
dialog: Uh, what happens if you got
dialog: that methyl-ethyl shit on
dialog: your hands?
text: Michael RIPS into the train station's parking lot. We SWERVE
text: around a taxi, CUT OFF Harley, CAREEN into the lot...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: GETTING WHAT YOU DESERVE IS
dialog: NOT FAIR!
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER (O.S.)
dialog: Uh, you got maybe thirty seconds
dialog: before you're sterile. For God's
dialog: sake don't touch yourself, or
dialog: anything.
text: Up ahead, Michael is OUT of his jeep and running.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: AND I HATE TALKING TO YOUR
speaker_heading: MACHINE!
text: She SLAMS on the brakes, THROWING herself against the wheel.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER FIELD MAN (O.S.)
dialog: Uh, this is One Monkey Zebra.
dialog: It wasn't bees in the gal's
dialog: wall, it was cats!
text: She TEARS the door open. SCRAMBLE OUT...
speaker_heading: YOUNGER FIELD MAN (O.S.)
dialog: She says gas 'em, anyway,
dialog: she'll pay cash. Uh... how
dialog: do I pay this?
text: WITH Julianne now, RACING through the lot, Michael vanishes INTO
text: the Station, she PLUNGES in after him, BOUNCING off bystanders,
text: apologizing, lunging on, gasping for breath, past exhaustion,
text: threatening clumsily through the crowd like a staggering drunk,
text: catching a lucky glimpse as he heads...
dialog: ... DOWN a staircase to the TRACKS. My God, what's he doing? A
text: second wind, fueled by panic, and she BOLTS after him, DANCING down
text: the steep staircase somehow without killing herself, reaching the
text: concourse to see him, running for...
text: ... Track 29, a train already RUMBLING, ready to pull out, she
text: SPRINTS after him.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: MICHAEL!!
text: He DISAPPEARS behind the train, she FALLS, skids, springs up,
text: pushes through gaping onlookers, almost there, the train PULLS
dialog: AWAY...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
speaker_heading: NNNOOOO!!!
text: But he's just standing there. His back to us. Watching it go.
text: Her body nearly collapses with relief. She pushes herself on, but
text: her legs aren't working right in their maxed-out fatigue, and she
text: lopes and staggers until she comes up behind him. He's still lost
text: in thought, staring after the train.
text: She tries to speak, but there's no breath. So she puts her hands
text: on her knees and just GASPS for air like a dog. Wheezing, panting,
text: trying once more to speak, but she can't yet, and then he casually
dialog: turns and...
text: ... JUMPS out of his skin! A heart attack seeing her.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (croaks)
dialog: Don't speak!
text: He just blinks at this sweaty, ripped-up, maniacal figure.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Uh. I saw that moving...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: DON'T SPEAK!
text: FLINGING both her hands across his mouth. A frozen beat. He nods,
text: okay. Cautiously, she takes her hands away. At least she has made
text: him smile, in spite of everything. At least she's done that.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I have to make a confession.
dialog: Another confession. Besides
dialog: that I love you. This is even
dialog: worse.
dialog: This. He's waiting to hear.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: The E-mail? You thought Walter
dialog: sent your boss? I wrote that.
dialog: You. WHAT?! Synapse overload.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You're not saying you actually...
dialog: you're saying that y...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (stricken with remorse)
dialog: ... wrote it, yeah. I'm the
dialog: bad guy.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: ARE YOU CRAZY?
text: She nods her head wildly, hair flopping.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY INSANE??
text: Bigger nodding.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: ARE YOU ON DRUGS???
text: Shakes her head, like a two-year-old.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (pacing in circles)
dialog: I mean, do you realize what
dialog: you've... well, of course you
dialog: realize, that's why you're
dialog: confessing, I mean... I mean...
dialog: how could you do that?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I didn't know it would get
dialog: sent. I just wanted you to...
dialog: get mad at Kimmy... and...
text: And watching. As this begins to sink in.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I've done nothing but slimy,
dialog: underhanded, despicable, not
dialog: even terribly imaginative,
dialog: things. Ever since I got
dialog: here. Trying to...
text: Staring in his eyes. Eyes she can't read at this point.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... to win you. To win you
dialog: back.
text: Tears in her own eyes now. Big ones.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: And I was blinded by love.
dialog: Like you said.
dialog: Shaking her head...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: But that doesn't excuse any
dialog: part of it. I am pond scum.
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Actually. Lower. I am the fungus
dialog: that feeds on pond scum. Lower.
text: The layer of mucous that cruds up
dialog: the fung...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Lower.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (agreeing)
dialog: Lower.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The pus that infects the mucous
dialog: that cruds up the fungus.
text: And to her amazement. The trace of a smile...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: On the other hand, thank you.
text: She blinks at that. Which squeezes out a tear.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: For loving me that much, that
dialog: way.
text: He shrugs. Just above a whisper...
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: It's pretty flattering.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Except it makes me fungus.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, that part I knew.
dialog: She's never loved him more.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: So you have to marry Kim.
dialog: Because she will actually make
dialog: you happy. I, in contrast, am
dialog: a shallow, neurotic psychopath,
dialog: with relatively little to offer.
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Kim. Nod your head. Do as
dialog: you're told.
text: He nods his head, still smiling. Her tears are running now. Maybe
text: she doesn't notice.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Just promise you'll never tell
dialog: me who you would have chosen.
dialog: If I hadn't confessed.
text: She chokes back a sob.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Cos if you would have chosen me.
dialog: Then I threw away a perfectly
dialog: good life. Just to be a decent
dialog: person. Which is a questionable
dialog: trade-off. Right?
text: He nods, slowly. Because he's supposed to.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: And if you would have chosen
dialog: some 20-year-old punk over me.
dialog: I'd have to kill myself.
text: Ah. His smile keeps getting smaller. More loving. More wonderful.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: I'll take it to my grave.
text: Good. She looks around.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'm so glad you didn't jump on
dialog: that train, before...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I came here, looking for her.
text: For her. The words leave a silence.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Why would she come here...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: This is where I proposed.
text: Stares deep in her eyes. She needs to hear this.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I had to cover a game in
dialog: Milwaukee. She saw me off.
dialog: And when the train started to
dialog: leave... I jumped up on the
dialog: step, I help the handle, and
dialog: without...
dialog: He grins. Has to admit...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: ... without a thought in my head.
dialog: I shouted, "Marry me."
text: I did. Now her eyes tear up again. And she doesn't know why.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And she gasped, and covered her
dialog: mouth, and the train was pulling
dialog: out, and suddenly she screamed
dialog: YES! Just once. And blew me a
dialog: kiss.
dialog: What a girl.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I never forgot that.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: It's two weeks.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Almost three.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: That is so romantic.
text: Which makes him reach and touch her hair.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I just wonder if you know why.
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It's because romance isn't
dialog: mystery, and tricks, and doubts,
text: and halting, unspoken longings.
dialog: That's not the real romance.
text: Tears in his eyes now. First time.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: The real romance is saying yes.
text: Does she know that now? He looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Woulda been a nice wedding.
dialog: Oh. That.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (urgently)
dialog: You can't believe you've lost
dialog: her! Sooner or later, you'll
dialog: find her, and you'll look in
dialog: each other's eyes, and you'll
dialog: see all that love...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Course, if it's later rather
dialog: than sooner, I'd hate to be you
dialog: at six o'clock.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You've got a lot of explaining
dialog: to...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'm just thinking of how she's
dialog: hurting. Lost. Alone. Like
dialog: her life is over.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: That's little egotistical.
text: He glares at her.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: But, undoubtedly accurate.
text: She claps her hands, galvanized by the emergency.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Okay, we'll split up. You go
dialog: to every romantic place you
dialog: guys have, I'll go... someplace
dialog: brilliant, and the first one
dialog: who...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: If you find her...
text: Strange tone. A gentle warning.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The kiss. May be hard. For
dialog: you to explain.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Because the only fear she
dialog: really has, is...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... me, yeah. And she likes
text: Tommy Lasorda. Case closed.
dialog: Looks at her own watch. Shit!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: But if you do get to her first...
text: She looks up.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: There is something you are
dialog: authorized to say.
scene_heading: EXT. TAXI STAND - DAY
text: Julianne sits on the fender of this guy's taxi. The driver smokes,

speaker_heading: MANDY (V.O.)
dialog: Wallace egregious residence,
dialog: Mandy speaking.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: It's Jules, you guys haven't
dialog: had a call from, say, Kimberly,
dialog: have you?
speaker_heading: MANDY (V.O.)
dialog: Oh, she's slipped out, the
dialog: little monkey. Prob'ly with
dialog: Michael, doin' the nasty.
dialog: A shallow laugh...
speaker_heading: MANDY (V.O.)
text: Or crying in her nachos, down
dialog: at Comskey Park.
text: Julianne's face SNAPS to alert.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Ex-cuse me?
speaker_heading: MANDY (V.O.)
dialog: I had this crank call? From
dialog: some guy who thinks he saw her?
dialog: I said, what would a bride be
dialog: doin', on her wedding...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You are so right. What a
dialog: nerve on that guy! Bring my
dialog: dress to church, huh?
dialog: Signals the driver, let's GO!
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I want to pick up a little
dialog: something for the ceremony.
scene_heading: INT. LUXURY BOX, COMISKEY PARK - AFTERNOON
text: Game in progress. Julianne and the bodyguard stand in the doorway
text: of the deserted skybox. Everyone Walter knows is going to a

text: nachos, extra cheese, sitting alone before a pulled-back chair.
speaker_heading: BODYGUARD
dialog: She wouldn't confide in me,
dialog: so I called the house.
text: He sighs. Feels terrible about all this.
speaker_heading: BODYGUARD
dialog: Luckily, I got her cousin.
dialog: Julianne nods. Yeah, big break, there.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Going to the john, she said?
speaker_heading: BODYGUARD
dialog: Could be there awhile.

scene_heading: I GOT A WARRANT FOR MS. KIMBERLY
speaker_heading: WALLACE!
text: Silence. From the long line of stalls...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: (O.S., sobbing)
dialog: In here, you bitch!
text: Now everybody's really interested. Julianne ignores them, strides
text: to the stall. KNOCKS, like it's a door. No answer.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Let me in, baby, or I'll rip
dialog: this damn thing off its non-

speaker_heading: WOMAN (O.S.)

text: Some scattered APPLAUSE. From down the line...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: (O.S., still sobbing)
dialog: Over here, nitwit!
text: Oh. Scattered laughter. Julianne moves down the line. Stares at
text: the door. We hear the soft, muted crying from within. Slowly,
dialog: Julianne...
text: ... drops to her knees. Bends her head low. PEERS under the door.
text: What she sees, prompts a sad warning...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Incoming.
text: And she crawls UNDER the door, on her belly. We go WITH her to
dialog: see...
text: ... Kim fully dressed, perched on the closed toilet lid, her knees
text: drawn up, her arms around them.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Pitiful.
text: And pulls herself up to her knees. Kimmy tries to glare, but it
dialog: just isn't in her.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Haven't you done enough?
text: The world gets real quiet. An entire bathroom is listening.
text: Julianne cocks her head to one side.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: In one minute. You are going
dialog: to feel so foolish.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A
dialog: STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Have you ever heard of.
dialog: Irony?
text: Irony? Kimmy sniffles.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I threw my arms around your
dialog: husband. And kissed him with
dialog: all my heart. Because I was
dialog: so happy. For you. Nitwit.
text: And leans close. As Kimmy flinches.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: He's going to take...
dialog: (big grin)
dialog: The job!
text: A stunned pole-axed moment. And Kimmy's eyes SPRING open. You
dialog: mean...?
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (beaming)
dialog: With your dad, yeah. Can you
dialog: guess why? Bitch?
text: Everything inside Kimmy BURSTS free in a torrent of tears...
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: HE LOVES ME!!
text: And DISSOLVES, sobbing, into Julianne's arms. A beat, for Julianne
text: to reflect, and then she strokes her tenderly.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Well, of course, he loves
dialog: you.
text: Kisses the top of Kimmy's head.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (very soft)
dialog: Hell, even I love you.
text: Kimmy holds her tight. From her heart...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I never want to go through this
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: That's entirely understandable.
text: ANGLES... outside the stall. Julianne's feet sticking out under
dialog: the door.
speaker_heading: KIMMY (O.S.)
dialog: Shit! THE TIME!
text: The two BURST out of the stall, hand-in-hand, at a desperate DEAD
text: RUN past us. HEAR them EXPLODE out the door, and...
text: ... five stalls OPEN. Women exit, crying.
scene_heading: EXT. UNIVERSITY CHAPEL - TWILIGHT
text: A taxi pulls up in front of an ivy-covered CHAPEL, fronted by nearly
text: a hundred souls, milling about in attitude ranging from overstimulated
text: curiosity to clinical hyperanxiety. Our girls JUMP out of the cab,
text: and half the crowd starts running toward us, twins in the lead...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Whatever hap...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: (cutting this short)
dialog: We were bonding, we lost track,
dialog: we're officially sorry, now
dialog: let's put it behind us.
text: Kim WAVES at her mom by the chapel entrance. And takes Julianne's
dialog: hand for support.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Believe me, we got a bride who's
dialog: worth waiting for, yes?
dialog: Everybody nods.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Out of our way.
scene_heading: EXT. DRESSING ROOM - TWILIGHT
text: White. Pure blinding white. Across FRAME floats more white, this
text: gauzy and ethereal. It settles, its roots planting deeply in the
dialog: bride's hair. TILTS UP to...
text: ... the face of the woman who placed it there. Julianne's eyes,
dialog: appraising this bride we cannot see. And so softly...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: Don't worry, sugar.
dialog: Don't worry.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: When he looks at you, it will
dialog: be as if...
text: The words stronger. Because there is no smile.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: ... he's never seen a woman
dialog: before.
dialog: PAN DOWN the white until we are...
dialog: CLOSE on the bride's perfect slippers. HOLD. And...
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - EVENING
text: Begins to slowly PAN BACK UP the length of an exquisite gown. We
text: can tell from the organ, the nearby thrum of expectant voices, that
text: we are nearing the moment. We reach...
text: ... Kimmy's hand. Firmly clasping Walter's. Keep PANNING, the
text: bodice, the lace, her throat, and finally, we are CLOSE on...
dialog: ... the face of the bride. Now we understand the word radiant. We
dialog: also understand scared senseless. Our perfect, unflappable Kimmy
text: is in a trance of emotional overload where bliss and panic
dialog: seamlessly blend.
text: The organ's noddling stops. Kimmy's eyes alerted, like a small
text: animal bearing a predator approach her thicket. Suddenly, the
text: CHORD. The Wedding March from Wagner's Lohengrin. Here. Comes.
dialog: The bride. And we SNAP TO...
dialog: FULL ANGLE... Kim and Walter. This is it.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Left foot.
text: REVERSE ANGLE... Kim's POV, the chapel, every pew packed, every neck
text: craning this way, the white satin carpet down the endless aisle to
dialog: where...
text: Michael waits. Also in a zone of pseudo-consciousness. From which
text: he attempts a smile. Not comforting. Kim's POV WHIP PAN the
text: groomsmen, the twins, LOCKING FOCUS on Julianne, standing strong
text: and beautiful, a glow of her own in the daffodil dress. She sends
dialog: her little sister a WINK across the trackless miles of aisle. You
dialog: can do this, kid. So...
text: ... Kimmy does. On her father's arm, she walks the gauntlet of the
text: world's intrusive admiration. One step at a time. The most beautiful
text: she will ever be. She is dazzling the crowd and managing to not throw
dialog: up at the same time.
text: And she's there. At his side. She glances back to her maid of
dialog: honor, just to make sure she's not working without a net. So
dialog: Julianne...
text: ... CROSSES her eyes. Which lets the kid smile and finally take a
dialog: breath. Have a little fun, huh? Kim nods, got it, turns to...
text: The Minister. Who stands before them with a calming presence.
text: Thank God someone has done this before. The crowd has hushed.
text: The Minister's eyes are only for two. His words are for all...
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Michael and Kimmy wrote these
dialog: words. She asked me to confide,
dialog: mostly Michael.
text: A ripple of laughter. Gentle and fine. They are setting in.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: So he gets to say them.
text: A surprise. A pleasant one. The crowd adjust in its seats. As
dialog: Michael begins...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Why do people get married
dialog: anymore?
dialog: And on these words. We SNAP to Julianne. Share her interest in
dialog: the bluntness, the simplicity, the unorthodoxy of this beginning.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
dialog: Why not live together amicably,
dialog: with no sense of obligation
dialog: beyond the moment?
text: Her eyes. She's listening.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
dialog: As long as the sex is good. As
dialog: long as no one more interesting
text: has wandered into view. As long
dialog: as the thousand conflicts of two
dialog: individual wills remain
dialog: comfortably compromised.
text: PANNING now. Other faces. Isabelle. Proud to the bone.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
dialog: And when one feels the urge to
dialog: move on, to explore the new.
dialog: No guilt, no disgrace, no
dialog: promise broken.
text: Walter. His eyes damp. Against our expectation.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
dialog: No agony of having dishonored
dialog: a time. When our hearts. And
dialog: the world were different.
text: Joe nods, as he hears...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
dialog: Marriage is a lot to put up
dialog: with.
text: Julianne once more. No breath. Rapt.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
dialog: The answer must be. That there
dialog: is some need basic to the human
dialog: heart. That embracing... the obligation
dialog: of commitment... fulfills.
text: Her eyes have clouded. As if Michael is talking to her.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
dialog: Some need to belong to one another
dialog: in a way which rages against the
dialog: notion... that all is impermanent.
dialog: Against the notion of mortality.
text: And suddenly, ALL the feeling rises in her throat.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
dialog: Our love is bigger. And longer.
dialog: Than life itself.
text: And the tears come. They come freely, unhidden, unnoticed. As if
dialog: they were needed.
text: Michael now. Looking at his bride.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: That's what we want. And marriage.
dialog: Is what we do about it.
text: Kimmy smiles at him. With love bigger than life itself.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: We are fools in this. Thank
dialog: God Almighty.
text: He is done. There is a silence.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Boy, that was good!
text: People LAUGH. The Minister holds up a sheet of paper. For the
text: crowd to see. Mostly paragraphs crossed out in red ink.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Michael and Kim also edited what
dialog: they want me to say...
dialog: More laughter.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: The idea was, we're only marrying
dialog: once. We have to remember it
dialog: forever. Let's keep to the good
dialog: stuff.
dialog: (squints at the sheet)
dialog: You may kiss the bride.
text: Bigger LAUGHTER. The Minister waves this off, his little joke.
text: Turns to the best man, pantomimes the ring. As the hammered gold
text: circle is handed to Michael, Julianne absently scratches her still-
text: swollen finger. Mandy taps Julianne on the arm, and produces...
dialog: ... a matching ring. Take it! Gives it to her. So Julianne steps
text: forward. Places the second ring into Kimmy's waiting hand. Their
text: eyes meet, and hold throughout...
speaker_heading: MINISTER (O.S.)
dialog: If anyone here can show just cause
dialog: why this man and woman should not
dialog: be married, speak now. Or forever
dialog: hold your peace.
text: Julianne CLEARS her throat. Kimmy's heart flutters. In the
dialog: silence... Julianne's wonderful smile. Just kidding.
text: Michael reaches for Kim's hand, turns her gently to him. Places
text: his ring on her finger. Holds her hands.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Kimberly. I promise to love.
dialog: And respect and comfort you.
dialog: To hear your voice and your
dialog: heart. Until we are parted
dialog: by death.
text: She swallows. Smiles a fleeting, beautiful smile. Fumbles
text: slightly, putting the ring on his finger.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Michael. I promise to love and
dialog: respect and comfort you. To
dialog: hear your voice and your heart.
dialog: Until we are parted by death.
text: Staring in each other's eyes. A moment so fragile, the Minister
text: waits an extra beat.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: For the record, you each agree
dialog: to marry the other?
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: I do!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I do.
text: The Minister joins their right hands.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: We haven't said much about God
dialog: this evening, I know. But He
dialog: is here. And He is happy. To
dialog: bless His wonderful children.
text: CLOSE now on Julianne. For the inevitable moment.
speaker_heading: MINISTER (O.S.)
dialog: In that Michael and Kimberly have
dialog: given themselves to each other by
dialog: solemn vows, and the exchanging
dialog: of rings...
text: Unnoticed by the world. Her eyes are close.
speaker_heading: MINISTER (O.S.)
dialog: I pronounce them husband and wife.
dialog: Those whom God has joined together,
dialog: let no one put asunder.
text: The eyes open. Wet, brave, ready for...
speaker_heading: MINISTER (O.S.)
dialog: Now. Kiss the bride.
text: Julianne watching. As Michael does.
scene_heading: EXT. WALLACE POND - NIGHT
dialog: This is what all the preparation was for. Tables, lights, balloons,
text: the guests dancing on the hardwood floor, at the base of the gazebo.
text: The bride and groom among them, relaxed and happy. Two who are one.
speaker_heading: PAN TO...
text: ... the stage, the band playing. Julianne conferring with the twins
text: and the band leader, clear that she's giving the instructions.
text: Then, she takes her glass of champagne to the microphone...
text: ... KLUNKS it, for silence. The band stops. The dancers follow.
text: All eyes are comfortably turned to the maid of honor. She looks to
text: the couple. Just below her. Then, to the crowd...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'm a writer, too, not as
dialog: good as Michael. But I do
dialog: steal from quality.
text: She raises her glass. Everyone at the table does the same.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: This is to my best friend. On
dialog: the occasion of his wedding.
text: Shouts of support, a few whistles. Silence. She tells Michael...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: If I have truly come to know
dialog: your bride as my new sister.
dialog: This is in her heart...
text: She has to stop. Swallows. Because she will not let herself cry.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: "Understand. I'll slip quietly
text: away from the noisy crowd when
dialog: I see the pale stars rising,
text: blooming, over the oaks."
text: Deep breath. Looks in his eyes.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: "I'll pursue solitary pathways
text: through the pale twilit meadows,
dialog: with only this one dream: You
dialog: come too."
text: A hush. SHARP applause. From four hundred hands. But not from
text: his. He is too moved. Too understanding of what he has heard.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I don't have a wedding gift.
dialog: But this is on loan. Until
dialog: you two find your song...
text: And with that the band begins. The opening phrases of a song we
text: have come to know. Michael seems overwhelmed. Julianne nods
text: toward the gazebo...
text: ... Michael takes his bride's hand, leads her up the stairs, into
text: his arms, as the twins step to the microphone, and guests begin to
text: applaud an unscheduled wedding dance...
speaker_heading: MANDY/SAMMY
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Someday, when I'm awfully low,
dialog: And the world is cold,
dialog: I will feel a glow just thinking of you,
dialog: And the way you look tonight.
text: Soft two-part harmony. As perfect as the words.
speaker_heading: MANDY/SAMMY
dialog: (singing)
dialog: You're lovely. With your smile so warm,
dialog: And your cheeks so soft,
dialog: There is nothing for me but to love you,
dialog: Just the way you look tonight.
text: Julianne can cry now. Because she's tied with half the place.
speaker_heading: MANDY/SAMMY
dialog: (singing)
dialog: With each word, your tenderness grows,
dialog: Tearing my fears apart...
dialog: And the laugh that wrinkles your nose,
dialog: Touches my foolish heart.
text: Julianne begins to sing. Unheard. Unseen. Even by the man she's
dialog: singing to...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE/MANDY/SAMMY
dialog: (singing)
dialog: You're lovely, please don't ever change,
dialog: Keep that breathless charm,
dialog: Darling, please arrange it, cos I love you...
dialog: Just the way you look tonight.
text: The band keeps playing. The dance goes on. Two people lost in each
dialog: other. The way it's supposed to be.
scene_heading: INT. GREAT ROOM - LATE NIGHT
text: Bedlam. Julianne caught in the middle of the throng. A young
text: couple, dressed for travel, appear at the top of the staircase.
text: The SHOUT are deafening. The bride has her bouquet...
text: ... she spots Julianne far below. THROWS it her way, Julianne
dialog: reflexively GOES FOR IT...
dialog: ... not a fucking chance. The twins nearly TRAMPLE her in the
text: stampede, Mandy WRESTING the prize from Sammy's grasp. Everyone
text: CHEERS, and then the couple is...
text: ... FLYING down the stairs, RACING through the crowd with a
text: protective phalanx of groomsmen bodyguards, heading for the door,
dialog: for freedom...
text: ... Julianne, trapped in the crush, loses sight of the couple,
text: struggles against the flow, suddenly panicked by the certainty
dialog: that she will never see him before...
text: And then, he's THERE. He has Julianne in his arms. Holding her
dialog: so tight. An embrace so wonderful, so terrible, she could go mad
text: from the confusion alone. Against the din, he murmurs in her
dialog: ear...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Wherever I go. However far...
text: She sobs. Holds him.
text: Deep, deep breath.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You win a few, you lose a few.
dialog: Some get rained out.
dialog: And to her surprise...
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: (V.O., very softly)
dialog: You have a good time?
text: To her greater surprise. There are a few tears left, after all.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I did what I came to do.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: (V.O., even softer)
dialog: Good girl.
text: She just can't speak now. So she doesn't.
speaker_heading: DIGGER (V.O.)
dialog: I was thinking. Maybe you might
dialog: visit us for awhile. We've got
dialog: the room made up.
dialog: This fucking guy. God, she loves him.
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: I'll think about it. I'm okay.
speaker_heading: DIGGER (V.O.)
dialog: Oh, you're more than okay.
text: Just above a whisper...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: You, too.
dialog: And with the last of her strength...
speaker_heading: JULIANNE
dialog: If the sun comes up, I'll see
dialog: you tomorrow, huh?
text: A chuckle. At the other end.
speaker_heading: DIGGER (V.O.)
dialog: I'll play those odds. You have
dialog: sweet dreams.
text: We hear the CLICK. She turns her back on the stars. Shoulders
dialog: straight. Chin up.
text: She walks from frame.
text: FADE TO BLACK. HOLD END CREDITS.
