dialog: Life as a House - By Mark Andrus
speaker_heading: LIFE AS A HOUSE
scene_heading: WRITTEN BY MARK ANDRUS
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: A clock alarm SOUNDS over TITLES on BLACK. We HEAR someone
text: clearing congested lungs, coughing up phlegm; a slight crash
text: STOPS both the cough and the alarm.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S BEACH SHACK - MORNING
text: The cottage is a tiny, peeling paint rat-trap set dead center
text: on a small ocean front cul-de-sac, surrounded by four massive
text: post-modern mansions.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S BEACH SHACK BEDROOM - MORNING
text: GEORGE NELSON, 42, squints and shivers as the spotty morning
text: light and ocean breeze enter through an open window. Bold
text: waves crash against the cliffs outside the room. A five-foot
text: wide stack of hand hewed beams are piled pyramid style,
text: making movement in the room next to impossible. George
text: stands shirtless in underwear and coughs again. He steps
text: over a pile of tools and stands at the window, facing the
text: sea. A happy sounding tune by Guster, "WHAT YOU WISH FOR,"
text: begins with the lyrics: 'Woke up today, to everything gray
dialog: and all that I saw just keeps going on and on...'
scene_heading: EXT. WEBBER'S HOUSE - MORNING
text: The post-modern house is three-levels of concrete and glass.
scene_heading: INT. SAM WEBBER'S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: SAM is sixteen with spiky black hair, a nose ring, two
text: earrings and painted black nails. The song continues with:
dialog: '...sweep all the pieces under the bed, close all the
text: curtains and cover my head.' Sam looks wasted as he climbs
text: out of bed and rummages through his dresser, retrieving an
text: empty bottle of prescription drugs; he tosses the bottle. He
text: walks to a desk where a half-built model of a house sits
text: unfinished and squeezes glue into a plastic bag and sniffs
text: it. Sam enters the closet and digs into a pile of dirty
text: clothes, pulling out the tie to a robe; he knots it around
text: the closet pole and then twists it once to form a noose. He
text: slips his neck through the noose and lowers his body; though
text: we don't see exactly what he's doing below his neck, it's
text: evident through his jerking arm that he's masturbating.
scene_heading: EXT. BECK'S OCEAN FRONT MANSION - MORNING
text: COLLEEN BECK, George's next-door neighbor, is a well
text: maintained blonde in her late thirties. She walks out of the
text: angular concrete mansion, grabs the paper and walks back in.
scene_heading: INT. BECK'S KITCHEN - MORNING
text: This is a minimalist kitchen, with pored concrete walls and
text: stainless steel cabinets.
text: Colleen drops the paper on the table and walks to the sink to
text: wash her hands. The SONG CONTINUES: '...If this serenade is
dialog: not what you want, it's just how it is...' Colleen appears
text: distracted for a moment. She walks outside onto the terrace
text: with wet hands, then bolts back in, breezing through the
text: kitchen with purpose.
scene_heading: INT. ALYSSA BECK'S BATHROOM - MORNING
text: ALYSSA is sixteen and perfect with strawberry blonde hair and
text: white teeth; her head is partially out the bathroom window.
text: Colleen bursts in, eases Alyssa aside and with effort, sticks
text: her head out of the same high open window.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: This is ridiculous!
text: We must not see exactly what they see, but out the window and
text: almost beyond view, a stream of urine arks out from George
text: Nelson's beach house bedroom, into the pacific ocean some
text: twenty-feet below. The piss stops. Colleen bangs her head
text: trying to get it back inside the house.
scene_heading: INT. WEBBER'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING
text: ROBIN WEBBER is George's ex-wife, still beautiful at forty.
text: She herds two boys, RYAN (8) and ADAM (7), down the hall.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: He'll be gone for his birthday.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Can we have a party for him while he's
dialog: gone?
text: Robin stops and KNOCKS on a bedroom door.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I hope you're showered and ready for
dialog: school!
text: A loud CRASH stops Ryan and Adam at the top of the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S ROOM - MORNING
text: Robin rushes in and glances around the room for her son.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Sam?!
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S WEBBER'S CLOSET - MORNING
text: The closet pole and a long line of clothes have been felled
text: by Sam's dangerous whack-off technique; he's on the floor
text: with the robe tie still around his neck and a pile of shirts
text: sprawled over him. The song continues: '...come out come
dialog: out, wherever you are, would you do it all over right from
dialog: the start, and what you wish for won't come true, you aren't
dialog: surprised to love, are you?'
text: Robin stops at the door, trying to figure out why her son is
text: sitting in a pile of his own clothes. Ryan and Adam join
text: her, looking equally perplexed.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE NELSON'S CUL-DE-SAC - MORNING
text: George's dog, GUSTER, is doing his business on the lawn of a
text: modern day robber baron, DAVID DOKOS, who exits his house
text: with a briefcase. He hops into his Mercedes and proceeds to
text: chase Guster straight across his well-manicured grass.
text: Guster easily escapes death and runs off. George walks out
text: of his shack as David hops the curb, flips him off and drives
text: away. George waves goodbye.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Stick it up your ass! Have a nice day.
dialog: (glancing around)
dialog: Guster!
text: Guster runs to his side as Colleen rushes out of her house.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: This has got to stop!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: He escaped. He's going back in.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: Does it give you some sort of perverse
dialog: pleasure to expose your...penis in plain
dialog: view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: There are no windows facing
dialog: my...exposure.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: George, this is the third time.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: The plumber's due out on Friday.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: You'll have to explain that to the
dialog: police.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You were the only neighbor I could
dialog: tolerate.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: I did warn you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: My life is a warning. I just can't
dialog: figure out for what.
text: Colleen shies away from George's stare; he finally turns and
text: walks toward the house but stops short as he turns back.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Colleen, how hard was it for you to get
dialog: your head outside that window far enough
dialog: to see my dick?
text: This stops Colleen for a moment; it was difficult. George
text: walks back to the cottage and locks Guster in before stepping
text: into an old Ford truck and driving off. Colleen watches him
text: drive off, then turns to her house and stares.
scene_heading: INT. WEBBER'S DINING ROOM - MORNING
text: PETER WEBBER, Robin's husband, is a distinguished,
text: intimidating man with silver hair and an expensive suit.
text: LOIS, the maid, serves French toast to Ryan and Adam as Robin
text: sips tea.
speaker_heading: ADAM
text: Sam broke his closet.
text: Peter glances at Robin, who shrugs.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I don't have a clue anymore. I wish
dialog: you'd talk to him. He needs a man.
speaker_heading: PETER
text: His father is a man.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
text: A man he respects.
text: Sam walks into the room from the hall, outfitted in all black
dialog: with kick ass boots.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Thanks for talking about me behind my
dialog: back...useful in court.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Are you wearing eye shadow?
text: Adam, Ryan and Robin check out the eye shadow.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Take it off.
text: Sam flutters his eyelids in defiance of his stepfather.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Do it now!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: If I walk out the door, who's gonna be
dialog: here tonight for the follow through?
text: Peter hesitates for just a second.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Have a nice flight.
text: Sam's out the door with his eye shadow intact.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Queer.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Dad said it first.
text: Robin focuses on Peter, who simply shrugs. Adam stands up,
text: walks over to his father and gives him a hug.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I get chocolate cake for your birthday.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Are your hands clean?
text: Adam is quick to back away from his father and lick the
text: fingers of one hand.
scene_heading: INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - MORNING
text: George is resting his head against the glass window as he
text: stares out at the blighted landscape leading to downtown Los
text: Angeles. A sudden pang tightens his face; he presses his
text: hand against his stomach and closes his eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. LAGUNA BEACH HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING
text: Sam is alone at the back of the parking lot, sitting on the
text: hood of an old Saab, smoking as two boys, JOSH and MAREK,
text: both seventeen, park a Porsche and pull Alyssa Beck (George's
text: peeping neighbor) and another girl out of the backseat.
speaker_heading: MAREK
dialog: Dude, nice look.
text: Sam simply nods as Marek and the other girl laugh at his all
text: black garb, earrings and eye shadow.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I saw your dad this morning.
text: Sam drops his cigarette and stomps it out as he stands; his
text: face lightens as Alyssa waves before walking away.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Been thinking?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MAREK
dialog: Forget him!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Two hours a week for three-hundred cash.
dialog: The whole summer. Do the math.
dialog: (as a dig)
dialog: They consider that a hatchback or a
dialog: station wagon? Oh, that isn't yours
dialog: anyway, is it?
text: Josh raises his eyebrows and smiles before walking away. Sam
text: faces the Saab and kicks the bumper as hard as he can.
text: Suddenly, a boy (COREY) bolts up from the back seat.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I was in total REM, man!
scene_heading: INT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES HIGHRISE - LATE MORNING
text: The architectural firm of Benson and Feinsilber occupies the
dialog: entire fortieth floor; George Nelson is their sole model
text: maker. Rather than offices, most of the space is open,
text: segmented only by portable low walls. Along the outer walls,
text: below the long line of windows, is a shelf filled with
text: amazingly intricate models. George is alone in a cubicle of
text: his own, cutting polystyrene with a hot wire. STEVEN GARDNER
text: rounds a corner with a velocity that makes George flinch.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Done...close to done?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm doing the grass.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Fuck the grass. Who said grass?
text: Steven exits as quickly as he entered, but as soon as George
text: goes back to work, Steven pops his head back in.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Burke bided out the Berlin Plaza. Did he
dialog: tell you?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I was going to start Monday.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: He likes the look of the computer models,
dialog: anyway. You take too long.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: After you mow the grass, would you mind
dialog: bringing the house to my office? I have
dialog: a presentation to make.
text: George simply stares as Steven nods and leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL CAFETERIA ATRIUM - LUNCHTIME
text: Sam is by himself, his eyes closed, listening to music
text: through headphones as Alyssa stops to stare; she visually
text: scans him head to foot, appearing slightly perplexed as a
text: friend passes.
speaker_heading: FRIEND
dialog: I wouldn't make a habit of it.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Okay.
text: The friend walks on; after a beat, Alyssa does too.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF THE WORLD PARK - EVENING
text: In the distance, the sun colors the sky a blinding orange as
text: it sets. A Range Rover with blackened windows is parked
text: behind a Porsche. 'TINTED WINDOWS,' an up-tempo tune with a
text: hand clapping by the Pansy Division, begins: 'A bed would be
dialog: a treat/But all we've got is this backseat/Tinted windows are
dialog: a beautiful thing.'
text: Through the front windshield, we can see Marek sitting in the
text: passenger's seat with his eyes closed.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER VIEW
text: Josh, Marek's friend, is sitting on a bench in the park
text: behind the cars. 'A dark secluded spot/In a deserted parking
dialog: lot/Tinted windows are a wonderful thing.'
text: Suddenly, the passenger door on the Rover opens and Marek
text: climbs out, brushing his hair with his hands before casually
text: checking his zipper. He closes the door and the car speeds
text: away. Josh walks to Marek and wordlessly they climb into the
text: Porsche and drive off.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE NELSON'S BEACH SHACK - DAY
text: George is shirtless in his front yard, hand hewing a twenty
text: foot beam. One strong, long pull and a thin shaving flutters
text: to the ground; Guster nabs it and starts to chew.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You'll crap real logs if you keep eating
dialog: wood.
text: Guster appears unconcerned as he awaits a new shaving.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (O.S.)
dialog: Hi, Mr. Nelson.
text: George glances up, wipes the sweat from his forehead as
text: Alyssa walks toward him in white shorts and a tee shirt.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry I got you into trouble.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'll survive.
text: George goes back to works and Guster taste tests shavings as
text: Alyssa searches for something else to say.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Does Sam have any friends?
text: George stops and looks up; he has no idea how to answer.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: He must.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
text: He seems lonely.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Are you his friend?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into
dialog: guys. I hate nose rings. And the blue
dialog: eye shadow thing really isn't working.
text: George is totally confused, unsure most of the answer, but
text: before he can question her, a police car pulls to a stop;
text: OFFICER KURT WALKER steps out.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Thought I'd run over the list.
text: Officer Walker removes a pad from his pocket and flips
dialog: through to find his place.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: This is such a street of whiners.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: From Tuesday to yesterday, not including
dialog: Monday or today. Okay...Mrs. Dokos is
text: repeatedly running over her lawn. The
dialog: Corliss' have attributed the increase in
dialog: rat population in their environs to the
dialog: state of your...structure.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: IPO's caused the rat population on this
dialog: street.
text: Officer Walker focuses on Alyssa.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: And of course the Beck's, with the...
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
text: It could have been a squirt gun.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (to George)
dialog: You've been good this week.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You forgot David Dokos and Tom and
dialog: Barbara.
text: Kurt stuffs his pad back into his pocket.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Mr. Dokos calls animal control for Guster
dialog: and I was out here on the other.
dialog: (pointing to the plane)
dialog: Do you mind?
text: George hands him the plane and Kurt begins to work the wood.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Are you guys' friends?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: We've known each other since grade
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I mean, but did you both go camping on
dialog: weekends? Listen to music? Masturbate
dialog: together? Talk on the phone?
text: George doesn't answer and Kurt keeps working.
speaker_heading: KURT
text: Hunted rabbit in the hills.
text: Alyssa stares at George, disappointed.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I aimed high.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: We just weren't very much alike, I guess.
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: (casually; to George)
dialog: I liked your dad more than I liked you.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I wouldn't want you as a friend.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: George just never really...aimed that
dialog: high. Even with not hitting a rabbit. I
dialog: knew you were doing that, by the way.
dialog: That's why I stopped doing it with you.
dialog: You were no fun. It was always like you
text: were frightened. Quiet and boring.
text: Kurt is beginning to perspire as he shaves food off the beam
dialog: for Guster.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Funny how he's the architect and you're
dialog: just a loud mouth cop.
speaker_heading: KURT
text: He builds models for architects. His
dialog: dad, on the other hand, was the real
dialog: deal. Designed and built the coolest
dialog: houses I've ever seen.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Was bankrupt and dead before I was
dialog: twenty.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Left you this place.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it.
dialog: He stole it from everyone that deserved
dialog: it by putting me on title.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Do you know what I'd give to have this!
dialog: Forget how I got it! I can't afford dirt
dialog: in this town. I live in Riverside,
dialog: Goddammitt And you get to piss in the
dialog: ocean.
text: Kurt stops working and steps back.
speaker_heading: KURT (CONT'D)
dialog: Your kid was down around Diver's Cover
dialog: again, smoking pot. I didn't write him
dialog: up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Thanks for telling me.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: At least your father tried, George.
text: Kurt walks to his car and drives off. There's a moment of
text: awkwardness with Alyssa. George walks into his house leaving
text: Alyssa with Guster.
scene_heading: INT. WEBBER'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON
text: Robin is sitting at the kitchen counter, cutting carrots;
text: through the French doors, she's able to watch Ryan and Adam,
text: along with a few friends, play in the pool.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (O.S.)
dialog: I could be anyone.
text: Robin jerks with fright as half the carrots roll to the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Then why do you stay you?
text: George picks up the carrots and washes them in the sink.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You should lock your doors.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Ring the bell before you try the door.
text: George bites into a carrot as Robin starts chopping again.
speaker_heading: ROBIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be
dialog: over this weekend?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You let him pierce his nose?
text: Robin snatches the carrot from George's hand and chops it up.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Lock the door behind you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Where he always is.
text: George takes Robin's hand and removes the knife.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Not that I don't trust you.
text: As George lets go, Robin holds on; he appears surprised by
text: her grip of his wrist. Robin's eyes well with tears.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I should have knocked.
text: George is clearly not comfortable with his ex-wife's hold of
text: him, with her tears.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: What kind of a mother can't stand her
dialog: son?
text: George jerks his arm away from her grip.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don't know.
scene_heading: INT. WEBBER'S UPSTAIRS HALL - AFTERNOON
text: George is tense and he walks to Sam's door and KNOCKS.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Why aren't you coming in for the weekend?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Sam?!
text: Nothing. George tries the door - it's locked. Frustrated,
text: he walks back down the hall and down the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. WEBBER'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON
text: Outside, the boys are engaged in a raucous version of Marco
text: Polo. Robin is at the sink; she holds her hair back with one
text: hand and splashes water on her face with the other. George
text: walks by outside, carrying a ladder.
scene_heading: EXT. WEBBER'S BACKYARD - AFTERNOON
text: Ryan is the first to notice George.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Marco!
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I'm not cheating! I'm not looking!
text: Robin wipes her face with a hand towel as she rushes out.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: He doesn't answer.
text: The boys have stopped playing; Adam opens his eyes.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
text: He never answers.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Why does he have a lock on his door?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Because he put the lock on! Do you think
dialog: I told him he could have a nose ring?!
dialog: Why do you ask me everything you should
dialog: ask him!? I don't know anything,
dialog: anymore!
text: The boys line up against the edge of the pool and watch
text: George extend the ladder against the house and climb.
speaker_heading: ROBIN (CONT'D)
dialog: You climb up there and tell him what he
dialog: can and can't do. Take him for the
dialog: summer, okay? Whip him into shape. Cut
dialog: his hair. Make him smile. Let him hate
dialog: you for a while!
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: You're too late for heroics, George.
text: George lops a leg over the railing and steps onto the bedroom
text: balcony. He peers into the room through the sliding glass
text: door and tries to open it (locked) before removing the screen
text: to the small open window beside it. He climbs in.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Sam is asleep on his bed in his underwear, wearing
text: headphones. On the floor is an aerosol can of whipping
text: cream. George picks up the can and tosses it in the trash.
text: He focuses back on his son with his nose ring, earrings, blue
text: eyeshadow and thin, pale white body. Sam is soundly asleep.
text: George gently removes the headphones from his son's head;
text: drum heavy music surges from the small, padded speakers.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You need every brain cell you've got.
text: A KNOCK on the door stirs Sam more than his father's voice.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (half-asleep)
dialog: Leave me alone!
text: Sam's eyes are still closed as he shifts onto his side.
text: George opens the door; Robin is weak and weepy.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I don't know what to do, anymore. Take
dialog: him. You take him.
dialog: (hostile)
dialog: You're such a good father.
text: George walks out of the room, around Robin and down the
text: stairs without a word. Sam stirs at the sound and sits up to
text: confront his mother.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What are you doing in my room?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I didn't go in your room.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I locked the door! Get out! I locked
dialog: the door! Get out!
scene_heading: EXT. WEBBER'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - AFTERNOON
text: Robin grabs the door and closes it quickly, but doesn't move.
speaker_heading: SAM (O.S.)
dialog: Stupid bitch! Liar! I locked the door!
dialog: I don't sneak around your room! Liar!
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Sam rushes over to the window and stares down at the screen
text: and ladder. Ryan, Adam and their friends are still in the
text: pool, holding onto the coping, staring up at Sam. Sam slams
text: the window shut and searches for the can of whipping cream.
text: He gets down on his knees to search under the bed. Standing
text: and making one more pass of the room, he notices the can in
text: the trash. He instantly focuses all his rage at the closed
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: This is my room! You have no right in
dialog: here! This is mine!
scene_heading: INT. WEBBER'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - AFTERNOON
text: Robin is sitting on the floor at the top of the stairs,
text: staring blankly down at the foyer of this modernist mansion.
speaker_heading: SAM (O.S.)
dialog: Why can't you all just die and leave me
dialog: alone!
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - MORNING
text: The traffic is thick and loud and the sky is a blanket of
text: brown as George makes his way down a sidewalk mixed with
text: professionals and panhandlers. Suddenly sick, George rushes
text: to the side of a building and vomits.
scene_heading: INT. BENSON, KIDDLER, FEINSILBER AND ASSOICATES - MORNING
text: George wipes a clump of wet paper towel against the vomit
text: stain on his cuff as he walks through the pockets of cubicles
text: to a large enclosed office. A SECRETARY smiles as she stands
text: up from her desk and opens the door.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Is there a...
text: He holds out the wad of wet paper towels, but before he can
text: say trashcan, BRYAN BURKE stands up from behind his desk.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: George, have a seat! I've got juice.
scene_heading: INT. BRYAN BURKE'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: George steps in and the secretary closes the door to the
text: office. Bryan approaches with his arm outstretched, but
text: George can only raise the paper towels.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: A bird caught me.
text: Bryan grabs a trashcan and holds it up; George tosses the
text: ball into the trash and sits down.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Orange juice...croissant?
text: Bryan motions with his hand as he sits.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm good, thanks.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: What are you on?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Pardon me?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: how much weight have you lost?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh...nothing. Thirty pounds. I just
dialog: haven't been very hungry.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: How's your wife?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: When we divorce a decade ago, she was
text: very, very angry.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now she's just hostile.
text: Bryan nods and laughs as he takes a chunk of croissant and
text: chews as he talks.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Right...she married...what was he?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: He buys and sells the world.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Peter Webber! Right. Quite the
dialog: spotlight on that guy.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I did tell you, didn't I? That I'd be
dialog: ready to start the Berlin model today?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're
dialog: not hungry?
text: Bryan is anxious as he holds up the rest of the croissant.
text: George shakes his head "no". Bryan tosses his croissant into
text: the trash can and leans forward.
speaker_heading: BRYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: This isn't me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We can show clients endless options,
dialog: change anything in a matter of hours on
dialog: the computer. But you won't change.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Typing and clicking myself to renderings
dialog: isn't why I started building models.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
text: All of us are typing and clicking,
dialog: George. Whether we want to, or not.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm not.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Which is why we bid out a quarter of our
dialog: projects. It doesn't make a lot of sense
dialog: anymore to want what we don't have and
dialog: don't want what we do.
text: George glances around the office, angered by the thought he's
text: being fired.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I've been here twenty years.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Maybe that's too long.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (hopeful)
dialog: Maybe...?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: That's too long.
text: George nods as he stares at Bryan.
speaker_heading: BRYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen, they decided on a week a year
dialog: severance, but I got them to twenty-six.
dialog: That's six months salary, George.
dialog: Medical and everything for six months.
dialog: You can learn all you need to on the
dialog: computer long before that. Maybe find a
dialog: job closer to home.
text: Bryan is rattled by George's blank stare. He takes his glass
text: of orange juice and sits back in his chair, taking a sip, all
text: the while keeping an eye on George.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: My wife left me because I wasn't...very
dialog: emotional. I kept trying to explain that
dialog: my father sucked all the emotion from me.
dialog: Drunks do that, sometimes. Make their
dialog: kids afraid. Make them unwilling to
dialog: express themselves.
dialog: Bryan knows he's supposed to say something, he just can't
dialog: seem to figure out what.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: How old are you?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Forty.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: We were probably in school together. You
dialog: went to Berkley?
text: Bryan lights up at the sound of his Alma matter.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Class of eighty-six! I didn't know you
dialog: were there.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I was a sophomore when I got the call my
dialog: parents were dead.
dialog: This is not the direction Bryan had hoped the conversation
dialog: was headed.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: My dad had a blood alcohol level of .18.
text: A little high. Drove right into oncoming
dialog: traffic. Killed my mother with him. A
text: lady in another car. Hurt her daughter.
text: A five-year old girl. I think about her
dialog: still.
text: Bryan wants this to end. He leans forward with a whisper.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I hate this job.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: What are you talking about? You love
dialog: your job.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: From the day I started...to today. Can't
dialog: stand it.
text: Bryan is perplexed as George stands.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Then it sounds like I'm doing you a
dialog: favor.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It may sound that way, but I react out of
dialog: fear. My life has nothing to do with
dialog: what I like or don't like. You haven't
dialog: been listening, have you?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I didn't know there would be a quiz,
dialog: George.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: For everything.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Well, I feel better about this now.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Good. I was hoping for that.
text: Relieved and not understanding anything about irony, Bryan
text: stands and extends his hand. George shakes Bryan's hand
dialog: without malice.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I've got one favor to ask.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: What can I do for you, George?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I built my first model here when I was
text: twenty. There are hundreds of them on
text: shelves around the office. Twenty years
dialog: of my life. I was wondering if I might
dialog: be able to pick a few to keep, to take
dialog: home? Only the ones that really mean
dialog: something to me.
text: Bryan recoils slightly from the request.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't
dialog: get to keep our work. I could maybe ask
dialog: them if you could choose one. But, you
dialog: know, frankly George, you were the best.
dialog: Computer models can't begin to match the
dialog: beauty you gave yours. They're a part of
dialog: this firm. They inspire me. I go out
text: there and sometimes just stare at
dialog: something I've designed. It amazes me.
dialog: I would miss that too much.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Look, I may be going out on a limb, but
dialog: you go out there and look them over,
dialog: every single one of them and pick the one
dialog: you like the best and take it with you.
dialog: Just run it by me first, just in case,
dialog: you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Well, it's the least I can do.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yes, it is.
text: George nods and leaves. Bryan looks lost and guilty again.
scene_heading: INT. BENSON, KIDDLER, FEINSILBER AND ASSOICATES - MORNING
text: George walks around the maze of cubicles back to his own. He
text: finds an empty box and starts to pack. Against a wall, a
text: large rack is filled with spools of architectural plans.
text: George pulls one of the plans down, rolls it out and detaches
text: the wooden spool. Without warning and with a fury hard to
text: fathom, he proceeds to bat and smash a shelf of beautifully
text: rendered models. Heads pop up in other cubicles as George
text: walks out of his own and armed with a frightening rage,
text: methodically attacks model after model resting on shelves
text: just below massive plate glass windows that frame downtown
text: Los Angeles. Steven Gardner, who asked for his model without
text: grass, rushes to within feet of George as he witness his
text: creation deconstruct into shards of cardboard and plastic.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Mother of God! Not my house!
text: George stops for a second to focus on Steven, but Steven is
text: smart enough to run. George continues on with the business
text: of disassembling his work.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Oh, please, please, no!
text: The plea is instantly followed by a pathetic low whine.
text: George works up a sweat as he whacks model after model;
text: portions of plastic walls or window splatter the office as
text: though bombed in war. Bryan Burke's secretary inches as
text: close as she dares.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Uh...Mr. Burke would like a word with
dialog: you, George.
text: George lowers his stick as he faces her.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh...okay.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: In his office. When you're able.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Thank you.
text: With that, George finishes what he began only minutes prior:
text: the complete and utter destruction of every model displayed
text: on every shelf in the office, save one. Workers huddle
text: together, collectively moaning and moving en mass from the
text: mayhem. George picks up the sole surviving model in his arms
text: and cradles it carefully as he walks into Bryan Burke's
dialog: office.
scene_heading: INT. BRYAN BURKE'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: Bryan cowers behind his desk as George enters with his model
text: in one hand and the long wooden stick in the other.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'll take this one, if that's okay?
text: It takes Bryan a few aborted attempts to answer before he
text: simply nods.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you for going out on a limb and
dialog: allowing me one.
text: Bryan nods again, then quivers as George steps forward, leans
text: the stick against the desk and extends his hand.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: You're a great architect and a miserable
dialog: human being.
text: Bryan winces as he extends his hand. They shake hands and
text: George grabs hold of the stick again.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Thank you.
text: George walks around the desk and bashes in a model hidden on
text: the floor, one that Bryan had obviously wanted to save.
speaker_heading: BRYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, fuck!
text: George drops the wooden spool and walks out of the office as
text: Bryan garners the courage to stand.
speaker_heading: BRYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You're not even an architect and you're a
dialog: miserable human being.
text: George turns around only long enough to answer.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You're right. You win.
text: George closes the door behind him. Bryan stares down at the
text: remains of the model; he gets down on his knees and carefully
text: gathers up the pieces.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - MORNING
text: George is sweating as he walks with his box of personal items
text: under one arm and the model under the other. Dizzy, he stops
text: for a moment and tires to orient himself, glancing one way,
text: then the other before staggering back and pressing himself
text: against the building for support. Sweat beads and drops from
text: his nose and chin as the song, 'ACROSS THE UNIVERSE' begins
text: by The Beatles. George sets the box down but clings tightly
text: to the model as he closes his eyes.
text: 'Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open
dialog: mind, possessing them, caressing me...'
text: George drops face first to the cement, crushing the model
text: beneath him.
scene_heading: MONTAGE AS THE SONG CONTINUES
text: George is probed and poked by doctor after doctor. An
text: ultrasound test followed by a CT scan, followed by a MRI
text: results in more tests.
text: A flexible tube is slid down George's throat as dye is shot
text: into his body. 'Sounds of laughter, shades of life are
text: ringing through my open view, inciting them, inviting me...'
text: A long blunt needle is shoved into George's side for a biopsy
text: of his pancreas. X-rays are lit and highlighted as doctors
dialog: ponder the specks, the disease.
text: Finally, George is opened up; nearly bloodless slice through
text: skin, muscle and fat reveals death. 'Limitless undying love,
text: which shines around me like a million suns, which calls me on
dialog: and on across the universe...'
text: George is wheeled down a long hall to the critical care unit.
dialog: 'Nothing's going to change my world, nothing's gonna change
dialog: my world...'
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING
text: George tries to sit up, but falls back as he closes his eyes,
text: opens his eyes, closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: That took care of the pain?
text: George opens his eyes again as an attractive NURSE enters
text: with a tray of food.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I could kiss you.
text: The nurse smiles as she lifts the cover off the dinner.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: No food. I'm painless.
text: She raises George's bed.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: What would you do if you had three or
dialog: four months to live?
text: The nurse glances over at the other patient in the room,
text: who's sleeping, before answering in a soft voice.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: I'd eat a lot of red meat.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Good for you.
text: The nurse smiles as she sits down beside the bed. She fills
text: a spoon with corn and aims it for George's mouth; he accepts
text: the good will, chews and swallows.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: What would you do?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'd build a house.
text: George takes another spoonful of food.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: What kind of house?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You know what mortise and tenon is?
text: The nurse shakes her head "no".
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I've got every part of it ready. It's
text: like a jig saw puzzle...all in pieces
dialog: now, just waiting to make sense. I've
dialog: been through design and review...the
dialog: planning commission, city council.
text: She feeds George another small spoonful of food.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: No one's really said four months is all
dialog: you have, have they?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Stage four pancreatic cancer. They
dialog: haven't even pretended to offer
dialog: treatment. You tell me, when would you
dialog: start eating red meat?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Can you build a house in four months?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I can die trying.
text: The nurse rests her hand for a moment on George's cheek.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Good for you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I haven't been touched in years.
text: Suddenly alarmed by her emotion, the nurse removes her hand
text: and stands back away from George.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: A handshake, or you know, someone pats
dialog: you on your back through clothes.
dialog: Doctors, people who have to touch you.
dialog: But not by people who want to.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: No. A friend... your mother? Everybody
text: gets touched by someone they love.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Isn't that weird? I mean, I dated a
dialog: little bit after my divorce, for four or
dialog: five years. Six years. I know when my
dialog: son was younger...maybe when he was ten
text: or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his
text: arms around me.
text: George suddenly stops to catch his emotion. The nurse checks
text: the door before walking back to George; she brushes back his
text: hair with both hands, then fingers the curves of his ears,
text: finally resting her thumbs on his lips.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Oh God, I'm married.
text: Feeling guilty, she flees the room, waking the other PATIENT.
speaker_heading: PATIENT
dialog: I'm hungry.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm touched.
scene_heading: EXT. SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO TRAIN STATION - AFTERNOON
text: George is resting, eyes closed, sitting on a bench with his
text: box and the remnants of the model beside him. A black Range
text: Rover pulls to a stop with a HONK. George stands to gather
text: his things as Robin steps out of the car, yelling.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I called everyone, everywhere! You just
dialog: vanished! You could be dead!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Thanks for waking me up. Picking me up.
dialog: You're loud today.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You're inconsiderate and absolutely
dialog: devoid of emotion!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You're the most beautiful woman I have
dialog: ever known in my life.
text: Robin is stumped for a second, confused by the words.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm not talking just physically. Even
dialog: your anger is perfect.
text: Robin climbs back in the car and slams her door shut.
scene_heading: INT. ROBIN'S RANGE ROVER - AFTERNOON
text: George sets his box in back and climbs into the front seat as
text: Robin takes off. He closes his door as she runs a stoplight.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You didn't think someone from your office
dialog: would call and tell me you wrecked the
dialog: entire building and threatened people
dialog: with a baseball bat?!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: A blueprint spool.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Where have you been for a week?!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Four days. I left to think.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: What did you do with your dog?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: Kurt's been feeding him.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: But you can't call me while you think?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I wasn't thinking. Look, I'm sorry I
dialog: didn't think to call you while I
dialog: thought...I think.
text: George raises his eyebrows, wanting just the slightest give
text: from Robin. She glances at him, but won't yield.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I need to talk to you.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Why would they tow your truck?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I was parked in day parking.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Why call me?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm going to tear down the shack and
dialog: build my house.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You've been saying that for twenty years.
dialog: While we were dating, you said it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: There's nothing anymore to stop me.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Money?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Severance pay. And I'm going to cash in
dialog: my life insurance policy.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: How many years did I live with your beams
text: and boards? First in the garage, then in
dialog: the living room. We're going to do it,
dialog: Robin. Next year. Next year. Salvaged
text: floorboards from a house in Pasadena.
text: Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I love those doors.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Where will you live?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: The garage.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Look, I wasn't serious about you taking
dialog: Sam, so you don't have to get into any
dialog: actual construction to get out of it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: When's school over?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Friday...God, I hate the thought of him
dialog: home all day.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: He doesn't want to spend the weekends
dialog: with you anymore.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Not for the weekend. For the summer.
text: Robin scoffs.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You and Sam are going to live in a garage
dialog: without plumbing for the summer?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: The garage is plumbed. I'll put in a
dialog: toilet. We'll survive.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Sounding? I need help. He's cheap
dialog: labor.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: One of you would end up dead.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: At least we'll have a house to show for
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Forget it, really. I'll survive.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I want him with me.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: No, you don't. Trust me.
text: George rests a hand on the back of her neck.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I want Sam for the summer.
text: Robin furrows her brow for a moment and glances at George.
text: It takes a while for her to answer.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Okay.
text: George rests his hand on Robin's cheek for a moment, as the
text: nurse had done with him. Robin turns her head and bites his
dialog: finger.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hey, hey!
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I'm married.
text: George nods as he mock nurses his finger.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALL - AFTERNOON
text: Sam is walking with Corey, who's wiry and wan with a red
dialog: nose.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: The whole summer, man. Party in Tahoe.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: It'll just be my brother the dweeb on
dialog: weekends. All we gotta do is sand and
dialog: paint the cabin, dude.
dialog: (boasting)
dialog: My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my
dialog: charm is gonna let me use my rod. Income
dialog: village is the place to hook up with
dialog: hump.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'll ask.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Hey, it beats letting town folk go down
dialog: on you for the summer.
text: Sam stops which stops Corey. Sam glances around to make sure
text: no one's listening.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I never said anything. I haven't done
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I know what the deal is. Josh is a pimp.
dialog: I'm not stupid.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You don't know what the deal is. There
dialog: is no fucking deal.
text: Sam walks away pissed that Corey knows what the deal is.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S SHACK - MORNING
text: George is shirtless, the stitches still fresh on his side; he
text: carries/drags his mattress into the garage. Alyssa walks
text: from her house to the garage and peeks in.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - MORNING
text: George is making his bed, which is not easy because Guster is
text: curled up on it. The one car garage is not dry-walled and
text: the cement floor is clean but stained.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Hi, Mr. Nelson.
text: George steps away from the bed, slightly rattled by Alyssa.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Alyssa.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Why have you put a toilet and a bed in
dialog: your garage?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm living here while I build another
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Is that legal?
text: Alyssa sits down on the bed beside Guster and starts to
text: bounce up and down. George takes another step back.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Don't you have school?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Nope.
text: Alyssa lies down on the bed, lifting the sheet to her nose.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (CONT'D)
dialog: Are these clean?
text: George is alarmed. Guster licks Alyssa's ear.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What's today?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Monday.
text: George bangs his head with his hand and starts to search the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: My keys.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: What's that?
text: Alyssa reaches out and slides a finger down his scar.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Nothing. I cut myself.
text: George pats down his pockets.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I had them in my pocket.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I'm not shaving my legs or pits this
dialog: summer, I've decided.
text: George opens the drawers of a small desk and a chest, not
text: paying attention to Alyssa as she raises her leg and runs her
text: hands down the stubby skin.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (CONT'D)
dialog: Paula Cole isn't a vertical kisser.
text: George dabs his keys from the floor beside the chest.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Make the bed for me, would you? I gotta
dialog: run.
text: George turns around to Alyssa's leg up and a great view of
text: her underwear.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN (O.S.)
dialog: What are you, forty?
text: George whirls around to face Colleen as Alyssa lowers her
dialog: leg.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I forgot where I put my keys.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: And you thought they might be under her
dialog: dress?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I was just showing him my hair.
text: Alyssa miffed as she stands.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (CONT'D)
dialog: I think you need to rethink what you
dialog: think of me.
text: Alyssa walks around her mother and out of the garage.
text: Colleen stares at George.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: Her leg hair.
text: Colleen turns and walks out.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S TRUCK - LATE MORNING
text: George drives the four miles North to Robin's house listening
text: to Paula Cole. He turns into Emerald Bay, a guard-gated
text: community and a Guard waves him in.
scene_heading: EXT. WEBBER'S HOME - LATE MORNING
text: George rushes from his car and tries the front door, but it's

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: And Sam?
speaker_heading: LOIS
text: In his room, packing.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh...Good.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S ROOM - LATE MORNING
text: Sam has a CD by MARYLIN MANSON on loud as he packs a suitcase

speaker_heading: GEORGE (O.S.)
dialog: Sam!
text: Sam's face turns sour as he yanks the door open.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ready?
text: Sam shrugs and returns to finish his packing.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I think you'll have fun this summer.
text: It's nearly impossible to hear George over the music.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't forget your headphones.
text: The music is quickly driving George crazy.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Would you mind turning it down?
text: This doesn't register with Sam.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: It won't all be work, you know?
text: George is once again, seemingly unheard. He walks to within
text: inches of Sam and grabs his head and yells into Sam's ear.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: It won't be all work, you know!
text: Sam pulls away from the touch and turns the music off.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I heard you already!
text: George walks to the sliding glass door and stares down at the
text: boys and Robin in the pool.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Your mom and the boys can drop by
dialog: anytime.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: To check up on me?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'll be around to check up on you.
speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No fucking way!!!
text: The boys are knocked off their rafts as Robin takes off her

speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: You liar! You stupid liar! I hate you!
text: George bursts out of the kitchen, onto the patio.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Did you tell him he's spending the summer
dialog: with me?
speaker_heading: SAM (O.S.)
dialog: No I'm not!
text: Sam storms off the balcony, back into his room.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: What was I supposed to do? When you
dialog: didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call.
dialog: Your phone isn't working.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don't have a phone.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I drove over and you were gone.
speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Last time you were gone for a week!
speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: No. I was going to let you do that.
speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Who are you, anyway? I don't even know

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You'll know me by the time we're through.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm not going!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'll get your bag.

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Mom, tell him I'm not going. You already
dialog: promised me!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You have everything?
text: Robin is in an uncomfortable position as she glances at Sam

speaker_heading: ROBIN

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm not going!
speaker_heading: GEORGE

dialog: another kid in Tahoe. If he leaves, I
dialog: will follow him up there and I will drag
text: him home by his nose ring. He can hate
dialog: me. You can hate me. He can try to kill
dialog: me while I sleep. You can call the
dialog: police. You can call your husband or
dialog: your attorney, but Sam is spending the
dialog: summer with me. He's my son. He's
dialog: sixteen. That's it.
text: Sam is crying now -- snot's running down his nose. Robin is
text: shocked by George's forcefulness.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Can we hate you?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You can do anything you want.
text: George walks to Sam and touches his arm.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Go get in the truck, Sam.
text: Sam jerks away from his dad as dramatically as he can manage.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Go fuck yourself!
text: George drops the suitcase and grabs Sam by the arms. As much
text: as Sam tries to resist, he's clearly no match for his father.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Your nose ring comes out of your nose.
dialog: If you've got them in your nipples, they
text: come out, too. And there's no make-up at
dialog: my house. No glue sniffing. Huffing.
dialog: No pills, no grass.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: If you hit me, I'll call the police.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You've worn out your welcome at this
dialog: house, Sam. I won't ever hit you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: This may well be the worst three months
dialog: of your life, but you've earned it. So,
dialog: pick up your suitcase and go get in the
text: truck. Now.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'll hate you forever.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You can't even begins to know how much I
dialog: hate my father.
dialog: (upbeat)
dialog: Think of it as a family tradition.
text: Sam glares at his mother before grabbing his soggy suitcase
text: and stomping out of the backyard. Robin is stunned silent by
dialog: George's decisiveness.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S TRUCK - LATE MORNING
text: Sam is pressed against the passenger side door. George walks
text: from the backyard and opens the truck door to climb in but is
text: stopped by Sam's suitcase. He lifts it out and sets it in
text: the bed, then slides into the cab, sitting on the soaked
text: seat. George rises up and turns to Sam, who is sullen and
dialog: silent.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S SHACK - AFTERNOON
text: Sam is shirtless on his back on the roof of the shack,
text: sunning himself as George struggles to extricate a sofa from
text: a doorjamb. Guster is asleep on the grass, under a tree.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Sam? I'm...for like three minutes?
text: After another bout of trying, George drops the sofa and steps
text: back to glance up at Sam.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: That's okay. If I break my back, daddy's
dialog: gonna buy you a naval ring.
dialog: No reaction from Sam.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: And if that naval ring don't fit, daddy's
dialog: gonna rub you down with the sun screen.
text: Sam glances down at his father, puzzled by the verse.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I want you wearing sun block. And I want
dialog: you down here to help me. Now.
text: Sam dismisses his father without a word - he simply adjusts
text: his face back to the sun. George walks away. A sudden spray
text: of water drenches Sam, forcing him to his feet in a cold
text: panic. George stops the hose water pelting.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
text: It works on Guster.
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER
text: George is still struggling with the sofa stuck in the door.
text: Frustrated, he steps away from the sofa.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: You're in there not helping at all,
dialog: aren't you?
scene_heading: INT. BEACH SHACK ENTRY - CONTINUOUS
text: Sam is leaning against a wall with his arms folded across his
dialog: chest.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (O.S.)
dialog: You know what else helped Guster?
text: Neutering.
text: The slightest alarm crosses Sam's face.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - EVENING
text: George is shirtless in shorts, boiling pasta on a portable
text: stove as he heats a sauce in the microwave. A dresser topped
text: with plyboard serves as a countertop; other than a sink being
text: across the garage near the toilet, this is a fairly well
text: equipped makeshift kitchen.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Do you want garlic bread?!
text: George waits a bit to make sure no response is no response.
text: Then stuffs a hunk of garlic bread into the toaster oven.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - EVENING
text: Sam is sitting on the edge of a cliff that drops twenty feet
text: to the ocean; Guster is whining for attention behind Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Well, get over here, then, stupid.
text: Guster inches forward on his belly, which makes Sam smile.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you afraid of heights, Guster?
text: Sam drops to his belly and stretches out to pet Guster.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: The fall probably wouldn't kill me,
dialog: anyway.
text: Guster inches closer and licks Sam's face. George walks out
text: with a tray filled with spaghetti, garlic bread and a Coke.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Thinking of jumping?
text: George sets the tray on the ground beside Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Pushing.
text: George walks to the edge of the cliff.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Only jump after you hear the wave crash
text: against the rock. The water will take
dialog: you out. Let it. Swim a little North
dialog: and you'll see the sand.
text: Sam sits up and faces his father with a trace of alarm.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: First time I did it, younger than you, I
dialog: thought I'd break my neck and just sort
text: of float to Catalina.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You don't always get what you wish for,
dialog: Sam.
text: George suddenly leaps forward and disappears into the sea as
text: a wave crashes against the rocks below.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh, shit!
text: Sam scurries to his feet and scans the ocean for his father;
text: the only thing visible is darkness.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello?
text: Guster is lapping up the dinner, bread and all as Sam calls
text: out again. In a bit of a panic, Sam runs from the cliff.
scene_heading: EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - EVENING
text: The traffic is heavy as Sam runs against it. Without a
text: sidewalk and with parked cars blocking a reasonable path,
dialog: this is a dangerous trek North.
scene_heading: EXT. ALISO CREEK BEACH - EVENING
text: Sam runs to the edge of the water and anxiously waits for his
text: father to emerge from the sea. A jogger startles Sam - he
text: steps into a wave that soaks his shoes. George floats on a
text: wave into view and stands in waist high water, only to be
text: knocked way back down. He rises and falls and rises before
text: making his way to the sand and Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Are you totally insane?!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I almost saw Catalina.
text: George coughs and drops onto the sand exhausted. Sam storms
text: off, angry that he cared enough to get angry.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S SHACK - EVENING
text: Sam is winded as he walks off the street to the middle of the
text: yard. He glances around for Guster.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Guster!
text: Guster bounces out of the garage with spaghetti sauce
text: covering his muzzle.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: You're so busted, dude.
text: Sam sits down on the grass and plays with Guster, who yaps
text: with joy as he breaks away and closes the distance with the
text: abandon of a puppy.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Where's my dinner, huh?
text: Sam manages to pin Guster on his back. He looms over the dog
text: as he kisses him on the nose.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm hungry! Where's my dinner? Who ate
dialog: my dinner? Huh? Who's in trouble now?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (O.S.)
dialog: Hi.
text: Sam rolls over Guster and stands, nearly stumbling in the
dialog: process - way uncool.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: What are you doing here?
text: Guster bumps against Alyssa for her attention; she kneels
text: down to pet him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: They're trying to make me spend the
dialog: summer here. I'm leaving in the morning.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Where to?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Your dad's really gonna build his house?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see
dialog: you.
text: Alyssa stands. Sam is clearly shy around her.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (CONT'D)
dialog: You should stay.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Where's your dad?
speaker_heading: SAM
text: He jumped into the ocean.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Tell him I said "hi".
text: Alyssa pets Guster again before walking away. Sam is
text: smitten.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - NIGHT
text: Sam's curled up in a tattered lazy-boy near the toilet,
text: watching television as George sits on the bed, brushing his
text: teeth. Suddenly, Sam turns to face his dad.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm not taking a dump with you in here.
text: George nods as he continues brushing.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: My brothers say it's the worst smell
dialog: they've ever smelled.
text: George nods again, which appears only to irritate Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I think you have to have a door between
dialog: where you cook and where you crap. Like
dialog: even in the bush, tribal people and like
dialog: that have a place for both. It's like a
dialog: law.
text: George walks around Sam to the sink and spits, rinses and
text: wipes his mouth with a towel. He faces Sam.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Which side of the bed do you want?
text: Sam's jaw drops as he glances at the double-bed.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
text: Just kidding. The sofa's a pullout.
text: George smiles and pats Sam on the shoulder before walking to
text: the sofa and pulling it out to make a bed.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Probably in the bible.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Goodnight.
text: George drops his pants and climbs into bed. He pulls the
text: sheet up and fluffs the pillow before resting his head.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I have to take a dump.
text: George twists around in bed to face Sam. After a beat, he
text: tosses the sheet back, climbs out of bed, pulls back on his
text: pants, slips on his shoes and walks out of the garage.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S SHACK - MORNING
text: George is up on the roof, hacking through the shingles and
text: beams with a chain saw. A huge dumpster set on the lawn
text: receives only about half the throws George makes. Sam is
text: near the ocean in a chaise lounge, listening to music through
text: his portable CD player.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Have you got sunscreen on?
text: There's no chance he's been heard. TOM and BARBARA, two
text: older neighbors of George's nearing home from a walk, stop on
text: the driveway - both look pleased.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: It's about time this shack is torn down.
text: Barbara appears surprised as George turns to face them - she
text: obviously didn't realize he was the one up on the roof doing
dialog: the demolition.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Oh, hello George.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Guess how many low-income apartments the
dialog: city approved for this lot?
text: Tom and Barbara react by trying not to react.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on...ballpark figure.
text: Tom and Barbara step back and walk away. George heads to the
text: ladder and climbs down.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER VIEW
text: Sam is grooving to the music with his eyes closed as George's
text: hand, filled with a gob of sunscreen, plops onto Sam's
text: stomach. Sam bolts up from the chaise lounge in a rage.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I warned you yesterday.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Don't touch me! You can't touch me!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, you stayed.
text: Alyssa walks across her lawn to the feuding family. George
text: holds out the bottle of sun lotion to Alyssa.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Rub him down, please.
text: George walks back to the ladder and up onto the roof as
text: Alyssa and Sam stare at one another.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He's a freak.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: You look better without make-up.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I can't even take a shower here.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Come over to my house whenever you want.
dialog: I'll tell my mom.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I might not stay, anyway.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I'll get your back.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No. That's okay.
text: Sam reaches out for the lotion, but Alyssa hides the bottle.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Have you ever had anyone but your mom or
dialog: dad put it on for you?
text: Sam thinks about it for a second before shaking his head no.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's weird how different it is. Lay
dialog: down.
text: George is back with the chain saw, hacking away at the roof.
text: Sam is hesitant as he lies down on his stomach. Alyssa
text: kneels and squeezes lotion on his back. She works it in,
text: starting at his neck, working her way down to his pants. She
text: squirts Sam's arm and as she rubs close to his pit, he
text: squirms.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you remember me from when you lived
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I wanted him to marry her.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Turn over.
text: Alyssa grabs under his armpits and tickles him. Sam yelps
text: and rises onto his elbows as Josh roars by the shack in his
dialog: Porsche.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (CONT'D)
dialog: Josh and I are going to South Coast.
dialog: Wanna ride? Maybe see a movie?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No thanks.
text: Sam is disappointed as Alyssa stands to leave.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Don't forget your front.
text: Alyssa walks to the shack and waves goodbye to George.
text: George waves her off. Sam curls onto his side as he watches
text: Alyssa run across the lawn to Josh.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: She's pretty...for a girl.
text: Sam appears irritated as he stands and walks into the garage.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - MORNING
text: Sam glances out the window to check on his father, then
text: quickly rummages through every drawer and cabinet looking for
text: what he finds: a prescription bottle. It's Vicodin. He
text: checks on his dad through the window again, then opens the
text: bottle and takes out five pills. He fills a glass with water
text: and swallows two, saving three for later. He sets the bottle
text: back where he found it before he drops on the bed with a
dialog: grin.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - AFTERNOON
text: Guster is in a full out run for a rubber ball. Sam is
text: shirted, sitting at the patio table. With the ball gladly
text: returned, Sam tosses it again. George walks out juggling two
text: plates of sandwiches and two Cokes and sits down.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Do you ever get like the slightest
dialog: inkling that you might want to help me
dialog: instead of doing absolutely nothing?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Get the inkling, Sam. I'm getting tired
dialog: of your attitude.
text: Sam picks up the sandwich, examines it and sets it back down
text: on the plate.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I hate turkey.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No you don't.
text: George takes a bite of his sandwich before responding.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I want you to take out your nose ring and
dialog: leave it out.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It bugs me.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You snore at night. That bugs me. Can I
dialog: take you out?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Your brothers are right. It was the most
dialog: god-awful smell I've ever had my nose
dialog: around.
text: George tightens his face and waves his hand in front of his
text: nose. Sam stares at his father. A black Range Rover pulls
text: to a stop and Robin steps out with a pizza box in her hands.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Thought you guys might be hungry.
text: As Robin walks up the drive, Sam picks up the turkey sandwich
text: and starts eating. George glances at Sam as Robin sets the
text: box on the table and sits down.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: We're fine. Turkey sandwiches.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Well, for later then.
text: Robin focuses on the nearly roofless shack. Guster walks to
text: the table and sits down by Robin, ready to beg.
speaker_heading: ROBIN (CONT'D)
dialog: It makes me sad.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I used to live here.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: But you hated four out of the five you
dialog: did.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I was here six years. And I only hated
dialog: two.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Which?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: The first and the last.
text: George sets his sandwich down.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don't even like turkey sandwiches.
dialog: What kind of pizza?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Sam's favorite.
text: George opens the box and pulls out a slice. Sam appears
text: disinterested as George starts in on the slice of pizza.
speaker_heading: ROBIN (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Sam)
dialog: Sure you don't want any?
text: Sam shrugs off his mother, looking away. Robin nods and
text: grabs a piece for herself.
speaker_heading: ROBIN (CONT'D)
dialog: You're too thin, George. From what you
dialog: used to be, anyway.
text: George responds with a pleasant face; he's not going to
dialog: explain his weight loss right now.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Why the first and the last?
text: Robin sets her slice of pizza down as she studies George.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: The first because I wasn't sure you
dialog: really loved me...the last because I
dialog: wasn't sure I really loved you.
text: George nods. Though it may appear that Sam isn't interested
text: in the conversation, his ears are perked.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I was up on the roof this morning,
dialog: tearing it down and it struck me as
dialog: strong as anything ever has. That I'm
dialog: happy today.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: What have you been before today?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It was just that, maybe the way the sun
text: struck the ocean, the sound of the waves.
dialog: It was simple, whatever it was. Then I
dialog: started thinking about the last time I
dialog: felt this good.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's been a long time.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Do you remember?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: The only time I can think of for sure, I
text: was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving
text: him from the waves.
text: George turns to Sam, who's caught staring at his father.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: You head was pressed against my chest. I
dialog: could feel your heart racing. And I
dialog: remember I kissed your hair.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: We have it on video! Was that when? My
dialog: parents were down for his sixth birthday!
dialog: I remember that.
text: Robin inexplicably starts to cry. She instantly tries to
text: take it back, pressing her hand to her mouth, wiping her
text: eyes, but whatever emotion has her, has her good. Both
text: George and Sam are confused and concerned.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I have to go.
text: She stands and backs away from the table.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I'm fine. Nothing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
text: Robin wipes her eyes again as she climbs into her car and
text: drives off. Sam and George face one another.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm gonna take a walk. I need some
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You'll have money when you work.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You're so predictable.
text: Sam sets his sandwich down and grabs a slice of pizza as he
text: stands. He walks for a few feet, stops and turns around.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: You haven't been happy in ten years?
text: He doesn't wait for an answer; as he walks away, Guster
text: follows. George takes Robin's slice of pizza and drops it on
text: the cement; that's all it takes to turn Guster around.
scene_heading: INT. ROBIN'S KITCHEN - EVENING
text: Robin is sitting alone at the table, doing nothing. The TV
text: is on loud in another room. Adam walks into the room in his
text: pajamas. He sits down across from his mother at the table.
text: Robin smiles at him. He smiles back as he scoots his chair
text: closer to the table and extends his arms straight out across
text: the top. Robin extends her arms and they lock hands near the
text: middle. Without a word, they hold hands. Adam lets go and
text: climbs on top of the table, scoots across it with a kiss for
text: his mother before he's gone, sliding off the table on his
text: rear and running back to the TV.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - EVENING
text: George is on the patio, bending a thin piece of copper
text: tubing. Sam storms out of the garage, fuming.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No one would blame me if I left!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'd blame you. I want you here.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm not doing it!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It'll be fine.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why don't you just beg some money off my
dialog: dad and move into something decent with a
dialog: real kitchen and a real bathroom?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
text: Sam screws his face down - huh?
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't beg.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: And I don't take a shower in the middle
dialog: of the yard.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I can promise you complete privacy.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You can't promise me anything! You don't
dialog: have anything to promise! You live in a
dialog: garage! You don't have cable! You're
dialog: not hooked up to the internet because you
dialog: don't even own a computer! You don't
dialog: have a job!
text: George finishes bending the copper into a circle. He stands
text: and holds the copper circle out for proof of privacy.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: This will save you from prying eyes.
text: Sam dismisses his father with a shake of his head. He heads
text: back into the garage.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - EVENING
text: Sam quickly heads to where George's prescription bottle was
text: hidden under a pile of underwear. He steals two more pills
text: and swallows them before grabbing a towel and walking out.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - EVENING
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: If you had a stupid phone or I could use
dialog: your truck, mom would give me some money.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You'll have money when you work for it.
text: Sam stomps down the driveway and across the grass to Alyssa's
text: house. George walks around to the back of his garage with
text: the rounded copper tubing.
scene_heading: EXT. ALYSSA'S HOUSE - EVENING
text: Sam is standing on the porch with his towel and clean
text: clothes. Colleen answers the door.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Is Alyssa home?
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
text: She's out with a friend.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: She didn't really say.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh...okay.
text: Sam nods and steps back as he prepares to leave.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: Sam?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: I didn't recognize you!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing
dialog: over there.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Not a shower.
text: Colleen takes Sam by the arm and nudges him into the house.
scene_heading: INT. ALYSSA'S ROOM - EVENING
text: Sam is slowly making his way around the room, taking note of
text: everything: some dried flowers; a yearbook; a cabinet full of
text: CD's; dirty clothes stuffed in a hamper. He walks into the
text: bathroom before walking back out and making one more round.
scene_heading: INT. ROBIN'S FAMILY ROOM - EVENING
text: Robin is sitting between her sons on the sofa, watching a
text: movie. Peter enters the room, carrying his jacket.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: The goddamn traffic. Were we going out
dialog: to dinner?
text: Robin focuses on her husband, but the boys are riveted to the
dialog: television.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: We've eaten.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Is Lois still here? I'm starved.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I'll make you something.
text: Robin stands as Adam and Ryan try to hold her down.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Did someone call to tell you I'd be late?
text: Robin walks into the kitchen without responding.
scene_heading: INT. ALYSSA'S BATHROOM - EVENING
text: Sam's in the shower, obscured by the sandblasted glass.
speaker_heading: JOSH (O.S.)
dialog: Bro, I need you tonight.
text: Sam bumps an elbow against the glass as he opens the shower
text: door enough to look out. Josh is sitting up on the marble
text: countertop.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I locked the door.
text: Josh holds up a tiny screwdriver.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It'll take you like twenty, thirty
dialog: minutes.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Does Alyssa know?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You got any weed?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You got the money?
text: Sam waits a beat before closing the shower door.
speaker_heading: JOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: Alyssa sent me up to see if you wanted to
text: hang around and watch a movie with her
dialog: and her mom.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - EVENING
text: The round copper tube is braced and nailed to the side of the
text: garage; on it hangs a shower curtain. George is making
text: noises inside the curtain as he showers.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Ah! Oh....
speaker_heading: KURT (O.S.)
dialog: I know there's an explanation.
text: George pulls back the shower curtains just enough to see Kurt
text: standing by in his police uniform.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No hot water.
text: George is shivering as he closes the curtain back up.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and
text: a boy are squatting illegally in the
dialog: garage of your house.

dialog: Check the permits. It was built as a
dialog: guesthouse. It's a legally rentable unit
dialog: grandfathered when South Laguna was
dialog: incorporated.
text: Without warning, the copper tubing holding the hanging
text: curtain falls to the ground. George turns the water off and
text: grabs a towel. Unfortunately, his ass is not what the towel
dialog: covers.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Now that should be illegal.
scene_heading: INT. ALYSSA'S FAMILY ROOM - EVENING
text: Alyssa and Colleen are curled up on the sofa as Josh and Sam
text: stick their heads in to say goodbye.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Thanks for the shower.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: I want you both to stay.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: And candy too.
text: Alyssa holds up a huge bowl of popcorn and the DVD case.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I'm gonna give him a ride in my car.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I'll see you tomorrow.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Thanks, I'd like that. Thank you.
text: The only thing keeping Sam from staying is Josh, who jerks
text: him out by the shirt.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - EVENING
text: With Kurt in the only chair, George hands him a cup of coffee
text: and sits down on the pullout sofa, which is pulled out.
speaker_heading: KURT
text: I'm surprised he hasn't left.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I haven't forced him to work. I only wet
dialog: him down once. Why would he leave?
text: Sam rushes in and grabs a sweater before starting out.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm leaving.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hey...hey!
text: Sam stops at the door and waits impatiently.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: When are you going to be back?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, until you know, you can't go.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh, okay.
text: Sam is gone in a flash. Kurt studies George for a second.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm not very good at it. Parenting.
text: Kurt nods; agreed, he's not.
scene_heading: INT. ROBIN'S KITCHEN - EVENING
text: Robin arranges an attractive plate of food, which she sticks
text: in the microwave. Peter walks in wearing different clothes
dialog: but the same personality.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I hope your ex-husband is equipped for
text: the havoc of Sam, because it seems
dialog: absolutely blissful here tonight.
text: He sits down at the table, opening up a newspaper as Robin
text: stares at him.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Should I?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: It would worry me.
text: Peter glances up from the paper, focusing on Robin.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: If I let everything that should worry me,
dialog: worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: What would you be if you asked Adam and
dialog: Ryan to run in now and hug you?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'd be you.
text: The answer bothers Robin enough that Peter can't concentrate
text: back on the paper.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll do it if that's what you want.
text: Robin walks out of the kitchen. Peter folds the paper and
text: shoves it across the granite counter.
scene_heading: INT. JOSH'S PORSCHE - NIGHT
text: Sam and Josh are parked on a street that overlooks the Valley
text: East of Laguna Beach. They share a joint as Josh explains
dialog: the specifics of the job.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You don't have to do a thing. Just get
dialog: in and get out. As quick as you can.
dialog: Close your eyes and think of whatever.
text: Sam hands the joint to Josh.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What's your deal with Alyssa?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Don't even...I'm there.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I wasn't sure.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: She wouldn't even fucking go out with
dialog: until she was sixteen. I mean, that's
dialog: not even a rule, just her own thing. She
text: like figures things out on her own and
dialog: then that's it.
text: A black Mercedes Benz pulls to a stop a ways down the street.
text: Josh hands Sam a cell phone.
speaker_heading: JOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: If this rings, run.
text: Sam is scared and it shows.
speaker_heading: JOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: He already knows everything about what he
dialog: can't do. You can tell him not to even
dialog: look at you, if you want.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm thinking it's too weird now.
text: Josh pulls a baggie of grass and holds it out for Sam, who
text: takes it and stuffs it in his pants pocket.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It beats working.
text: Josh hands Sam the joint.
speaker_heading: JOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: Inhale and get out.
text: Sam is quick to inhale, but slow to get out. Josh takes the
text: joint and Sam steps out. He walks slowly to the Mercedes,
text: opens the door and climbs in. Josh turns the CD on to
text: Guster's "ALL THE WAY UP TO HEAVEN." Sam closes the door to
dialog: the Mercedes. 'He said to only look up, he said to never
dialog: look down, down is where we came from...' It's an odd song
text: sung in a happy tempo; a whistling refrain overtakes the
text: lyrics as Josh inhales. 'He said to hope for the best and
dialog: take a load off my chest. Soon, I could be happy, and go all
dialog: the way up to heaven and go all the way back home.'
text: With the music loud, Josh misses the police car as it stops
text: behind him without the lights. Too late for a getaway, he
text: fumbles for his cell phone and tosses the joint out the open
text: window. The OFFICER approaches the Porsche with his hand on
text: his gun.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: What did you toss into the brush?
text: Josh furtively presses send on his cell phone as he faces the
text: officer with a guilty face.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: 'He said I might need his help, no one gets high on
dialog: themselves. I just seem so lonely; he's just trying to be
dialog: nice and spread around his advice. I could be happy...'
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Turn off the music!
text: As the music stops, the door to the Mercedes opens and Sam
text: hops out with his pants around his ankles. The officer
text: notices and walks towards the Mercedes. The parking lights
text: flash red as the car starts and flees the scene. Sam yanks
text: up his pants and leaps down the hillside, falling and rolling
text: in the brush as the officer yells for him to stop. Josh
text: starts his car, but the officer dissuades him from leaving by
text: removing his gun. Josh turns off the engine.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Oh, it's working now.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: What did you toss into the brush?
text: Before Josh can feign innocence again, the brush starts to
text: smolder. Busted.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE - NIGHT
text: Sam is spotted with weeds and dirt as he continues his way
text: down the steep hillside holding up his pants. After he's
text: sure he's safe, he sits down and rests his head in his hands.
text: He starts to shake, frightened by his actions. He drops onto
text: his back, buttons and zips his pants as he starts to cry.
text: Slowly, he stops crying, but keeps staring up at the sky,
text: which is loaded with stars and a full moon. Mesmerized by
text: the brilliant night, Sam can't stop staring.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S SHACK - MORNING
text: George is removing the last of the windows, carefully prying
text: it out of the casement as Robin pulls up in her Range Rover.
text: She steps out dressed in Levi's, boots and a t-shirt,
text: carrying a large bag.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Lunch.
text: She smiles and walks toward George, dropping the food sack on
text: the patio table.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It's not breakfast yet.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I dreamed about your house last night.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Finished or unfinished?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: It was perfect, George. Amazing. It was
dialog: so real.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Didn't you once dream you could lick
dialog: people well, though?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: That wasn't a dream. That was Sam.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh...with his ear infection!
speaker_heading: ROBIN
text: My tongue around the edge of his ear is
dialog: what cured him.
text: George isn't quite sure how to take her comment. Finally, he
text: points to the Garage.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Go in there and lick his attitude.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: The antibiotics weren't working.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's what I believe, George.
text: George stares at Robin for a second before he nods.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You were wrong about the first year, you
dialog: know?
text: It takes Robin a second to understand he's saying he loved
dialog: her when they married.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I've been wrong a lot in my life.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hindsight. It's like foresight without a
dialog: future.
text: Robin almost smiles; George confessing love ten years dead.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I have three hours before I pick up Adam
dialog: and Ryan.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Where will I be most useful?
text: Robin glances around, assessing the best use of her time.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: With your hands or your tongue?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You're not well.
text: Robin picks up a pile of splintered board and tosses them in
text: the garbage bin. George nods...he's not.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Robin and George carry a twelve-foot beam from inside the
text: shack and set it down on cinder blocks. Both look exhausted
text: as they head back in for another beam. Sam saunters out of
text: the garage in shorts, sits down on the patio chair and opens
text: the sack his mother had packed for lunch. He pulls out a
text: peanut butter and jelly sandwich and starts eating as George
text: and Robin emerge from the shack with another beam.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Good morning.
text: Robin and George set the beam down and turn to Sam as they
text: both wipe sweat off their faces. Sam chews his sandwich,
text: ignoring them both.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I'm late.
text: Robin walks close to Sam, trying to capture his attention.
speaker_heading: ROBIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ryan has a game later. He asked if you'd
dialog: come and watch.
text: Sam glances up at his mother, just long enough to let her
text: know he hates her, then drops the sandwich and walks back
text: into the garage. A city inspector's car pulls to a stop on
text: the street and BOB LARSON steps out with a clipboard. Robin
text: passes him as she walks back to her Range Rover.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Mr. Stevens?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I've been dreading you.
text: Bob and George shake hands as Robin drives off.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Bob Larson. Do you happen to have an
text: unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a
dialog: kitchen?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: A violation?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Oh, yes.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: And if I enclosed it?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: An exhaust system or a window is code.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: A sink?
speaker_heading: BOB
text: Allowed outside the enclosed area.
text: Sam walks out of the garage in long pants and a shirt.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Where is it?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: A friend of yours is here.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Did you got through my pants?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I might have a solution.
text: George grabs his chain saw and walks to the garage with Sam
text: and Bob in tow.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Where'd you put it?!
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - AFTERNOON
text: George walks to an armoire and empties it. He grabs a hammer
text: and bangs, pries and pulls the back off, then dumps the
text: cabinet onto the floor.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I know you took it. I want it now!
text: George yanks the chain saw to a roar and fashions an oval cut
text: a few feet deep on the cabinet base. He kills the saw, lifts
text: the armoire and scoots it in front of the toilet.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: Doors.
text: Bob grimaces as George opens the armoire, revealing the
text: toilet inside.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I hate to ask about a window.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (to Sam)
dialog: I flushed it down the toilet.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No! Oh my God!
text: George jerk starts the chain saw again and fashions a small
text: opening above the toilet, ripping through the studs, wire
text: mesh, tar paper and stucco - fine dust invades the space like
text: a storm. Bob coughs as he writes in his book. George kills
text: the chain saw and sets it down as he surveys his work.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: If I had a gun, I'd kill you.
text: Bob seems fairly anxious to conclude his business.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I assume you'll fill the...uh, window,
dialog: with glass?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: If that's what it takes.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What's in my pants is none of your
dialog: fucking business!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (a little rattled)
dialog: I would say you're in compliance.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I hope that makes the pain in the ass
dialog: that called you happy.
text: George is staring at Sam. Bob backs out of the garage.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You and me both.
text: With Bob gone, George walks to Sam and gets in his face.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Everything about you is my business.
dialog: What you smoke, what you swallow, what
dialog: you sniff, it's all my business.
text: Sam slams his fists against his own chest, maddened.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I've been using since I was twelve!
dialog: You're all so unbelievably stupid. You
dialog: didn't give a shit about anything I did
dialog: until now!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'll apologize for everything but
dialog: today...Today I give a shit.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You're too fucking late.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: The gloves on the table are for you.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You can't make me do a thing.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Sit down for a second.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No.
text: George gently guides Sam back onto the bed. Sam hops up mad.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll call the cops if you touch me again!
text: George sets Sam back onto the bed, not so gently this time.
text: Sam is less eager to hop up in defiance.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, so you're in the big shit now! Child
dialog: abuse. People go to prison for what you
dialog: just did to me.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: My dad used to play a game. I never
dialog: really understood what it was until after
dialog: he was gone.
text: Sam appears immensely disinterested.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I was holding for someone. That wasn't
dialog: even mine.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: The game was to make me smaller than he
dialog: was. No matter what. He could be almost
dialog: invisible as a human being, but I had to
dialog: be smaller. So if I got good grades, I
dialog: was a pussy for not playing football. If
dialog: I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short
dialog: enough. If I shaved it, I looked like a
dialog: psycho. I never won the game. Not once.
dialog: And if he couldn't make me smaller with
dialog: words...
text: Tears well in George's eyes. Sam is caught up enough in what
text: his father has to say that he has to feign his lack of
dialog: interest.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'll have to pay him back.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I won't ever hit you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don't want you smaller. I want you to
dialog: be happy. You're not. Not here with me.
dialog: Not home with your mother. Not up in
text: Tahoe. Not alone. Not anywhere.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're what I was most of my life, Sam.
dialog: I see it in your eyes. In your sleep.
dialog: In your answer to everything. You're
text: barely alive.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm not even listening.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You know that great thing, though? Is
dialog: that change can be so constant you don't
dialog: even feel the difference until there is
dialog: one. It can be so slow that you don't
dialog: even notice that your life is better or
dialog: worse, until it is.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Or it can just blow you away. Make you
text: something different in an instant. It
dialog: happened to me.
text: George walks to the garage door as he wipes his eyes. He
text: stops and turns back around to face Sam.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Build this house with me.
text: George walks out leaving Sam on the bed to think.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S BEACH SHACK - AFTERNOON
text: George gathers a pile of splintered boards and tosses them
text: into the dumpster. He works while Guster sleeps.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: The sun is fierce, low on the horizon with a heat that
text: distorts the distance. George is sweating and shirtless as
text: Sam walks out of the garage with the gloves on and stands
text: staring at his father. After a beat, George notices him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I have to pay back what you flushed down
dialog: the toilet.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I want ten dollars an hour...then I'm
dialog: done.
text: George nods. He points out the roofless shell of a shack.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It all has to come down before we can
dialog: start again.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Knock it down.
text: George picks up a sledghammer and hands it to Sam. Sam
text: hoists the hefty hammer and with some true effort, slams it
text: on a sideboard. He slams again and again as George picks up
text: a slightly smaller sledgehammer.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I hated this house from the second my
dialog: father cheated everyone and put it in my
dialog: name.
text: George takes a good hard whack at the wall, knocking a huge
text: hunk of it down. Sam stops to watch.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Twenty years of hating what you live
dialog: in...what you are. This is the end of
dialog: it, Sam. I'm gonna build something of me
dialog: here that I can be proud to give to you.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Don't. I don't want it.
text: George YELLS as he lands the hammer into the wall again. Sam
text: is alarmed by his father's blatant rage.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Do whatever you want with it. I don't
dialog: care. All I want from you is for you to
dialog: remember we built this house together.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: We haven't build shit. You're just
dialog: tearing down your father.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Try it. It feels good.
text: George strikes another blow to the house joined with a MAD
text: WAIL. Sam starts low, a whisper of a scream, but quickly
text: builds, soon rivaling George in volume as he pounds away.
text: This soul letting, cleansing ritual is both impelling and
text: frightening to watch. Tom and Barbara, Colleen and her maid
text: step out of their houses, drawn and perplexed by the guttural
dialog: noise.
scene_heading: INT. RYAN AND ADAM'S ROOM - MORNING
text: Both boys are asleep as Robin enters and wakes them with the
text: drop-and-bounce-back-to-your-feet-from-the-mattress method.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: It's morning, sleepyheads!
text: They both wake with a groan. Robin leaps onto Adam and
text: tickles him to life.
scene_heading: INT. ROBIN'S KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Robin is quickly finishing a breakfast of oatmeal and fresh
text: fruit with Adam and Ryan, who are still dressed in pajamas.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Why do we have to get up and eat with you
dialog: this early?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I just thought it would be nice.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Are you going to see Sam again?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I thought I might stop by.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: All day again?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Not all day. I'll be home after lunch.
text: Robin stands and dumps her dishes in the sink.
speaker_heading: ROBIN (CONT'D)
dialog: You can go back to bed...or Lois might
dialog: let you go swimming.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I wanna be with you today.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Oh, honey. There's not much to do there.
dialog: I mean, it's all work.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: We can work.
text: Robin focuses on her sons, both of whom seem willing to work.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Can we really help build a house?
text: Peter walks in, surprised by everyone being up.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Why is everyone up so early?
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S SHACK - MORNING
text: George is knocking away the forms used to pour the
text: foundation. Sam walks out of the garage with a towel; he
text: shields his eyes from the morning sun as he watches his
dialog: father work. Without make-up or a nose ring and with the
text: black dye gone from his hair and the polish from his nails,
text: Sam is a handsome kid.
text: George looks happy, laying bare the foundation that will hold
text: his home. Sam walks to Alyssa's house, unseen by his father.
scene_heading: INT. ALYSSA'S ENTRY - MORNING
text: Colleen is walking with Sam toward the stairs.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: If she's not up, you can use my shower.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: You're here early today.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: We're getting out of the ground today.
text: Sam looks fairly excited as he rushes up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. ALYSSA'S HALLWAY - MORNING
text: Sam stops at the door and KNOCKS.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (O.S.)
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I can use your mom's.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (O.S.)
dialog: I'm okay.
scene_heading: INT. ALYSSA'S ROOM - MORNING
text: Alyssa is curled up in bed, cuddling a stuffed bear as Sam
text: walks in and closes the bedroom door behind him.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Were you with Josh when the cops arrested
dialog: him?
text: Alyssa sits up in bed, holding the sheet to her chest.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Not really. No. Kinda. He got busted?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: His parents took his car. They're making
dialog: him ride a bicycle the rest of the
dialog: summer.
text: Sam can't help but like that.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: He asked me to tell you that you owe him
dialog: a hundred dollars.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He can peddle over anytime he wants to
dialog: for it.
text: Sam breaks into a full-on smile.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: This is serious! I don't have my
dialog: license. He was my ride.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm just here to shower.
text: Sam walks into the bathroom; before he closes the door, he
text: faces Alyssa with another smile - she tosses her bear at him.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S SHACK - MORNING
text: George is prying off the last of the boards when he's hit
text: with a pain that takes him to his knees. He drops the
text: crowbar and sits down in the dirt as Guster walks over to
text: comfort him. George takes deep breaths and closes his eyes
text: as he tries to gain control over the pain.
scene_heading: INT. ALYSSA'S BATHROOM - MORNING
text: The doorknob jiggles, jiggles and turns; Alyssa opens the
text: door and walks in dressed in a t-shirt and panties. Once
text: again Sam jumps and jams his elbow to the frosted glass as he
text: partially opens the shower door.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Is this like a past time with people? Go
dialog: away!
text: Alyssa sets a tiny screwdriver on the vanity.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I've seen lots of people. It's not a big
dialog: thing for me.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hand me a towel. I'm getting out.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I'm coming in.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't want you to!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: We're not gonna do anything.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why are you so stupid?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Why are you so uptight?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't even...what do you mean? I don't
dialog: even know what that means.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and
dialog: stay out of your way.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hand me a towel. Hand me a towel.
text: Sam is anxious. Alyssa takes off her t-shirt and pulls down
text: her panties before grabbing a towel; she hands it to Sam as
text: she forces her way into the shower. Barely visible through
text: the frosted glass, Alyssa wets her hair as Sam stares in her
text: direction. The towel drops to the tiled floor.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - MORNING
text: George is curled up in bed, the prescription bottle and a
text: glass resting on a table. He's holding onto his side, still
text: in some pain. A HONK gets Guster BARKING outside.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - MORNING
text: Ryan and Adam run to Guster with glee as Robin steps out of
text: the Range Rover with a large covered basket and a boom box.
text: She sets the basket and radio on the patio table and searches
text: for George, ending up at the entrance to the garage.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - MORNING
text: George has hidden the prescription bottle and is sitting on
text: the bed as Robin walks in.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I thought you'd be up with the sun.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: My stupid back.
text: Robin sits down on the bed next to George, concerned.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Do you need anything? I'll go to the
dialog: pharmacy. I have some Demerol at home.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No, I'm...thanks. I took something.
text: Robin runs her hand down George's spine.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Where's Sam?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: He won't use my shower. I don't get it.
text: Outside, Adam and Ryan are each calling Guster.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: You brought your kids?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I kind of said that maybe they could do
dialog: something. Help. I'm sorry. They
dialog: really wanted to come. I really wanted
dialog: to come and they wanted to be with me. I
dialog: don't think they'll be too much trouble.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'll find something that won't kill them.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Or wound. Let them keep their eyes and
dialog: fingers.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You're a good mother.
text: Robin smiles. With some effort, George stands.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Do you need help?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I think so.
text: Robin stands and wraps her arm around his waist and he drapes
text: his arms over her shoulder as they walk out of the garage.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I woke up this morning at three and
dialog: couldn't fall back asleep. Everyday I
dialog: think I see more of Sam than I've seen in
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: ADAM (O.S.)
dialog: Sam!
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - MORNING
text: Adam runs with abandon to Sam and Alyssa as Robin helps
text: George to a patio chair.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hey.
text: Adam runs into Sam with a hug, then steps back.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: What's that for?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Mom said I should.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I would have anyway.
text: Sam appears awkward as he rests his hand for a second on
text: Adam's shoulder.
speaker_heading: ADAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I'm his brother.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I'm his friend.
text: Adam views her suspiciously as they walk across Alyssa's
text: grass to the patio.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Mom says we can build a house.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Hi, Mr. Nelson.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hi, Alyssa.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hi, Mom.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Good morning.
text: It's clear that Robin is falling in love with her son again.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Hello.
text: Alyssa extends her hand to Robin and they shake.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You're so nice to let Sam use your
dialog: shower.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: He's got a standing invitation.
text: Sam instantly flushes red.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hey, Ryan.
text: Sam walks to Ryan, who's been standing back from the group.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Hey.
text: Sam drapes his arm over Ryan's shoulder and together they
dialog: walk to the foundation.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So, you wanna build a house?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: If we do, will it stay up?
speaker_heading: MONTAGE
text: A BLINK 182 SONG BLASTS from the boom box on the patio table.
text: Ryan and Adam slather paint remover on five old painted
text: doors. They work with gloves and brushes and appear
text: meticulous in their application. Alyssa and Sam nail and
text: bolt the corner posts to the rim joist as Robin and George
text: work on the stick framed door deck.
text: While George is moving a little slower than usual, it appears
text: that the pain is nearly gone. As the song ends, Robin rushes
text: toward the radio.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I brought a few of my own.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Someone stop her!
text: Robin runs to her car and retrieves a few CD's. She slips
text: the CD in and we HEAR John Hiat's "DISTANCE." It's a slow,
text: soft song that brings a smile to George's face.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It's been a while.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: This was my very first slow dance.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Did you know him before you knew Dad?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Since seventh grade.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Tell him how you made me fall in love
dialog: with you.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I smiled at him.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Watch out for the smile, boys.
text: Robin's body moves slightly to the music as she smiles.
text: George grins. The boys aren't sure what to make of the
dialog: advice. 'You are the beautiful love (my lover), I am the
text: distant shore (so far away). There is so much to uncover
dialog: (love's hiding). What is this distance for? What is it for?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Who's up for a dance?
text: Robin glances around for any takers, finally focusing on
dialog: George.
speaker_heading: ADAM (O.S.)
dialog: Just don't hug me too tight.
text: Adam walks to his mother and they hold hands as they dance.
text: Sam sits down to watch. George wears a smile that wipes the
text: last of the pain from his face.
speaker_heading: ADAM (CONT'D)
dialog: That's all you get. I'm busy today.
text: Adam backs away and grabs his paintbrush. Robin stops
text: dancing as she focuses on George.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Let's see if you've gotten any better.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, I'm worse. Much, much worse.
text: Robin waits to see how worse. George finally walks to her
text: and takes her in his arms. He must have been better than
text: this. The waltz smooths out as they dance closer, holding
text: tighter. "We fill the air with silent stares. But still, no
dialog: one there, we are strangers." Alyssa decides it's time to
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I'll see you tomorrow.
text: Sam watches Alyssa walk away, but he's quickly drawn back to
text: his mother and father dancing. Ryan appears anxious, unsure
dialog: of the music and George.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: When did you fall in love with my dad?
text: The dance stops. George lets go of Robin as she focuses on
dialog: Ryan.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: When I found out I was pregnant with you.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - NIGHT
text: Sam is on the pull out bed, listening to music through head
text: phones. We HEAR a flush, the armoire doors open and George
text: walks out of the cabinet, washes his hands, turns off the
text: light and drops into bed. A nightlight stuck in a socket
text: above the bed casts a dull blue light over the room. Sam
text: takes the headphones off. After a long silence:
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I took some of your Vicodin.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I know.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I like how it feels not to feel.
text: George turns onto his side to face his son.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I know the feeling.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How do you become something you're not?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What would you like to be?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What I'm not.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What are you now?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That's not true.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: See, that's the thing...I am what I say I
dialog: am.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I know parts of who you are.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What do you know about me?
text: George drops back onto his back. He takes his time to
dialog: answer.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: When you started first grade and your mom
dialog: went to work, it was so she could save
dialog: for an apartment. But then she met Peter
dialog: and skipped the idea of renting.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He's got nothing to do with me.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I couldn't imagine how I could compete
dialog: with him for any part of you. So, I
dialog: didn't. He wanted you to have his last
dialog: name...I let him even take that.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He was a prick when I was six, and he's a
dialog: prick today.
text: George turns onto his side to face Sam again.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I wish you had told me then.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm telling you now.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I gave up on you.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had
dialog: given up.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What would you be doing now?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Getting high, I guess.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: If I asked you to stop, would you?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I haven't used anything for two days.
dialog: I'm trying.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm proud of you, Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Don't be. And hide whatever that new
dialog: drug is you have. I like it.
text: Sam turns away from his father and puts his headphones on.
text: The music bleeds through the headphones in a muffled rumble.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: I put a gun to my father's head once.
text: George's voice is soft - there's no chance Sam can hear.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Have you ever thought like that? I've
dialog: been thinking...watching you work. How
dialog: much do you hate me?
dialog: (beat)
text: He was passed out.
dialog: Just screaming at my mother before.
dialog: About nothing. Under-cooked meat. I
dialog: went back to my room... put the barrel
text: close to his ear and chickened out again.
dialog: Not my dad. Hid in my room. Not even
dialog: me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Of course it was a BB gun. But it still
dialog: would have hurt like hell.
text: Sam notices his father's mouth moving and takes off the
text: headphones.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Are you talking?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I was just thinking about my mom. She
dialog: wouldn't leave him. I remember one time
dialog: she made us dinner wearing sunglasses. I
dialog: mean it was dark outside and in. But we
dialog: never talked about it.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Sun glasses?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: To hide a black eye.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why wouldn't she leave?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I think she was terrified of living with
text: him...but maybe even more terrified of
dialog: life without him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I would have killed him.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Everything would have been better if you
dialog: had. You'd have liked your grandmother.
dialog: And there'd be a girl out there that'd
dialog: have her mother. I remember reading
dialog: about her in the paper. They couldn't
text: find her father and her mother was dead.
dialog: I still feel guilty about that.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Do you ever wish you had done it?
text: George thinks about that for a second.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I loved him too much.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: After everything he did to you and your
dialog: mom?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: After everything.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That's so weird...
text: Sam slips his headphones back on. George nods...it is.
scene_heading: EXT. DAVID DOKOS' HOUSE - MORNING
text: Guster is squatting on the lush lawn of the mansion taking a
text: dump. David bursts out from his house, rushes to his black
text: Mercedes and tries once again to run over Guster. No such
text: luck. Guster moves on to another lawn as Mr. Dokos drops
text: over the curb and drives off down the street.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S BEACH SHACK - AFTERNOON
text: In the late June afternoon, with a clotted cloud sky, Robin,
text: Adam, Ryan, Sam, Alyssa and George work at building a house.
text: Adam and Ryan are staining the interior doors they stripped
text: days earlier. George and Sam carry large wood beam to the
text: foundation and slip it into the pocket mortise of the
text: laminated beam that spans from pier post to pier post. Robin
text: grabs a drill and screws the cast-in tie down to the wood
text: beam. Alyssa is sawing a rafter in half as her mother walks
text: across the grass with a huge basket of food.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: Is anyone hungry?
speaker_heading: LATER
text: With MUSIC playing in the background, everyone is packed
text: around the patio table eating pasta and drinking lemonade.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I like the color I'm making the doors.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: The absolute best color I've ever seen in
dialog: my life.
text: Adam lights up, pleased to be praised.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: How many bedrooms will your house have?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Three.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Will Sam live with you or us?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: With you.
text: It's a quick response that draws Robin's attention. Sam
text: lightly bops Adam on the head.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So put your plans of my room in the
dialog: trash.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I don't think Dad wants you home.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Adam, that's not true!
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yes, it is.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Would you stop being ridiculous? Your
dialog: father wants Sam home as much as I do.
text: Sam starts laughing. George smiles. Sam can't stop
text: laughing.
speaker_heading: ROBIN (CONT'D)
dialog: It wasn't meant to be...
text: Sam and George stand at exactly the same time and walk back
text: to the house. Without a word, they work together as they
text: continue to frame the house. Suddenly George turns back to
text: the pack of people at the table and loudly proclaims:
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I love you!
text: That's it. He goes back to work as Sam glances at him,
text: amused. Adam and Ryan are surprised and it shows on their
text: faces. Robin smiles.
scene_heading: INT. ROBIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Robin's in bed reading as Peter emerges from the bathroom in
text: pajama bottoms.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You know what I've decided?
text: Robin glances up from her book to Peter's hairy chest.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: To shave your chest?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We should take a vacation.
text: Peter grabs his pajama top and slips it on as he climbs into
text: bed. Robin sets her book down.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: The biggest waste of time since
dialog: television.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Do you remember anything I've said that
dialog: wasn't negative?
text: Robin takes long enough to think that Peter forges on.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Just the two of us.
text: It takes Robin a few seconds to answer.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I'd love to drive through New England in
dialog: the Fall.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Sooner than the Fall.
text: He closes in on her, kisses her cheek.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
text: After the kids are back in school.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Lois will stay with them. Or we can pawn
dialog: them off on your parents.
text: Out of reasonable excuses, Robin opts for the truth.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I'm helping George build his house.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I've been helping for the last few days.
dialog: Weeks. Sam's working. I told you Sam
dialog: was working. I mean, he really is.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Good. That was the plan. We couldn't
dialog: stand him and George needed help.
text: As true as it is, this still irritates Robin.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I can't go right now.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You can't go because of Sam?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: We haven't been away together for three
dialog: years. What difference does a few months
dialog: make?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You can't go with me because of Sam?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
text: Sam is working at something for the first
dialog: time in his life. Once in a while he
dialog: even talks to me. I want to be around
dialog: for that.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: So am I, Robin. I'm working at
dialog: something, too. I'm even talking. Do
dialog: you want to be around for it?
text: Peter is intense, close up, not giving her breathing room.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I don't know.
text: Robin whispers her answer. Peter pulls away and settles down
text: on his back. Robin doesn't move for the longest time.
text: Finally, she eases onto her back and turns out the light.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I was talking about our marriage.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I know.
text: Silence finishes the conversation.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - MORNING
text: With an extended plate and overhung rafters, the frame takes
text: its form; rooms are roughed in; windows are framed; two gable
text: dormers distinguish the common-rafter roof in the front and a
text: frame for a balcony juts out over the ocean in back. Robin
text: and Adam are locking in and hoisting the sheets of plywood on
text: a pulley system up to Ryan and George, who are stripped down
dialog: to shorts - George is thinner than ever.
scene_heading: INT. ALYSSA'S BATHROOM - MORNING
text: Sam is showering as Alyssa walks in from the bedroom and
text: joins him; no protest is voiced this time around.
scene_heading: INT. SHOWER - CONTINUOUS
text: Alyssa smiles at Sam as she grabs a wash cloth and slathers
text: it with liquid soap.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What's the point of this?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Does everything have to have a point?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's freakish. I don't get it. I'm not
dialog: really supposed to touch you, but I can
dialog: look.
text: Alyssa faces Sam as she washes her body with the cloth.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Are you sure you're totally into guys?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Josh said...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm not gay.
text: Sam glances down at himself; Alyssa looks too.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, hello!
text: They both look up.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I was wondering.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You're driving me crazy! Do you know
dialog: what it's like trying to jack-off in an
dialog: armoire?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You're off, you know? You're way, way
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I thought I was helping you.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It would help me if I could kiss you.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: No, I don't...NO. I thought we were just
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What you think, you know, doesn't have
dialog: much to do with reality. I mean, I hope
dialog: I'm not the first to say that about you.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Okay, but then we'll just be friends.
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Okay. I guess.
text: Sam stands still, unsure of his next move.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Have you ever even kissed a girl?
text: Sam appears shocked she would even ask; he hasn't, but she's
text: not supposed to know that. Alyssa makes the move, closes the
text: distance and kisses him. Apart, it appears to be something
text: they enjoyed. Sam wraps his arms around her, presses himself
text: against her and kisses her again.
text: After a few seconds of making out, Sam jerks once, then again
text: as he backs away. Alyssa grimaces as she glances down.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, yuck!
text: Alyssa steps into a corner of the shower as Sam turns around
text: and rests his forehead on the tile.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (CONT'D)
dialog: You're scrubbing the shower down.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S BEACH SHACK - AFTERNOON
text: George and Sam are on ladders, reinforcing a window opening
text: on the second floor with a 2x4 spline. Ryan and Adam are
text: flat on their backs on the grass with Guster between them,
text: dog-tired. Robin is at the grill with hamburgers as Alyssa
text: prepares the table for dinner.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: You must have a really great husband.
text: Robin glances up at Alyssa.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Why is that?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Just, I mean, well, you're here every
dialog: single day.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: He's at work while I'm here.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I guess I'd just be jealous if I were
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Well, he doesn't need to worry.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: If my kids and my wife were always at an
dialog: ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: He's not the type to worry.
text: Robin is slightly pissed at Alyssa grilling her; she flips
text: the hamburgers and calls out:
speaker_heading: ROBIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's eat!
scene_heading: INT. WEBBER'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Music is playing softly in the background. Peter is sitting
text: alone in a chair with a drink in hand. After a bit, Lois
text: walks in holding a can of Pledge and a rag.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: I'd be glad to fix you something.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, I'm fine.
text: Lois nods and walks away. For all the presence of the room,
text: Peter looks small and frayed in it - lost in his own house.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S BEACH SHACK - AFTERNOON
text: Lunch is over. Adam is wrestling with Guster on the lawn.
text: Robin is taking money from her purse as George hands Sam the
text: keys to his truck.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Nothing R, okay?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: And video games after!
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Home after.
dialog: (to Sam)
dialog: Will you come in and say "hi"?
text: Sam shrugs, takes the money and keys as Ryan and Adam rush
text: close to him.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Do we have to take her?
text: The three boys turn to watch as Alyssa, now dressed in a
text: dress, walks across the lawn to join them.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Definitely.
dialog: It's literally frightening how beautiful Alyssa can look;
text: with her tan and white dress, Sam shutters.
scene_heading: EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Josh is peddling down the highway on his bike, sweating in
text: the full afternoon sun.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: George is hewing a beam as Robin watches from a chair.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I should go.
text: George stops and wipes the sweat from his forehead.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: No. Why? I like to be with Sam.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It's just that there's less that Adam and
dialog: Ryan can do anymore.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'd hate to have them bored.
text: Robin stands and walks to George.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I know they're not much help, but they
dialog: love coming here, George.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: How much time do they get to spend with
dialog: their dad?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: What is it with this? They wouldn't
dialog: spend less time with Peter if they lived
dialog: here! He has no time!
text: Robin walks away, then back - she's frustrated.
speaker_heading: ROBIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up
dialog: with us? She's giving me crap about
dialog: being away from Peter and now you're
dialog: trying to do the same thing! What no one
text: seems to realize is that Peter isn't
dialog: there! He's not there! And when he is,
dialog: he isn't!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So, if you don't want me here, or you
dialog: don't want my kids here, just tell me,
dialog: George. I'll stop coming. But it won't
dialog: be because of Peter. It'll be because
dialog: you asked me to stop. Say what you need
dialog: to say, because I'm not leaving until I
dialog: hear it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'd rather you not be here.
text: In the distance, on the street, Josh peddles past on his
dialog: bike.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I thought we were helping.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I can hire workers to help me.
text: Robin nods, gathers her things, walks to her car, climbs in
text: and drives off.
scene_heading: EXT. COLLEEN'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Colleen is standing in the entry, talking to Josh.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: You can come in and wait if you'd like.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What friends did she go with?
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Robin pulls right back to where she was parked and parks
text: again. She steps out of the car talking.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Nothing is going on with us, is it?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Going on?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: When I picked you up from the train
dialog: station...what you said.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What did I say?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: That thing about I was the most, you
dialog: know, beautiful person you had ever
dialog: known. What was that?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That was the truth.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You've never said that before.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'll say a lot of things I've never said
dialog: before. It's habit.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
text: It sounded like a pick-up line.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I can't pick you up.
text: Robin sits down, weighted by the reason.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I'm married.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You bit my finger.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: If I weren't married?
text: George wants to answer quickly, dismiss the impossible and
text: move on, but emotion catches him off-guard. He forces a
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Let's not do this, okay?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I need to know.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You need to know what? Do I still love
dialog: you?
text: Robin is surprised by the question. She nods her head.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Absolutely. There's not a doubt in my
dialog: mind that through all my anger...my ego,
dialog: I was faithful in my love for you. From
text: seventh grade on.
text: Robin raises her eyebrows - what a revelation.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: That I made you doubt it, that I withheld
dialog: it...that's the greatest mistake of a
dialog: life full of mistakes.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But the truth doesn't set us free, Robin.
dialog: I can say it as many times as you can
dialog: stand to hear it. And all that does, the
dialog: only thing, is remind us that love isn't
dialog: enough. Not even close.
text: Tears well in Robin's eyes as she stands.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I should go.
text: George nods - she should. Robin walks to her car, opens the
text: door; she faces George before climbing in. George walks into
dialog: the garage.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: George rummages through his sock drawer. Pulls out a folded
text: sock and opens it - the prescription bottle drops to the
text: floor. He fills a glass and swallows three pills.
scene_heading: INT. ROBIN'S ENTRY - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Robin opens the door and heads straight for the kitchen.
speaker_heading: PETER (O.S.)
dialog: All I am is what I have.
text: Robin jumps and searches for the voice. Peter's sitting
text: alone in the living room.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: What are you doing home?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I always felt I could never marry you
dialog: without first showing you what a fabulous
dialog: life you cloud live despite me.
text: Robin takes a few steps into the room.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You never really trusted me.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You live a fabulous life, Robin.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Despite you.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I never asked for more.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: That's the problem.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Please don't leave me.
text: Peter stands and walks to her. Robin doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are the kids?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
text: Sam took them to a movie.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'll be in the bedroom.
text: Peter takes her hand and kisses her cheek before walking down
text: the hall. Robin stands still, trying to assess the exchange.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - EVENING
text: In a bedroom we don't quite recognize, two people are in the
text: throes of making love under a silk white sheet.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Oh God!
text: It's hard to tell whose voice that is - Robin's?
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - EVENING
text: George is in bed, awakened by a KNOCK.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I fell asleep!
text: Alyssa walks in, closing the door behind her.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
text: Sam's dropping Adam and Ryan off.
text: George is slightly out of it with oral morphine; he tires to
text: sit up, but settles for propping up his head.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Can you keep Sam straight?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: He's not gay. I found out purely by
dialog: accident, believe me.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I mean drugs.
dialog: (catching up)
dialog: I thought you said he was?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: He wouldn't use around me. I don't like
dialog: any of it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You're a good girl.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
text: Alyssa walks over and lies on the bed beside George.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You have to ask like that?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I want you to try something with me,
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I've taken a lot of morphine. Oral
dialog: morphine...for my back. Can I wait till
dialog: I can say no and sound convincing?
text: Alyssa leans forward and kisses him; it's a real kiss that
text: lasts a lot longer than it should. And when it's over:
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Did you feel anything?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my
dialog: mouth is numb. Why did you do that?
text: They both stare up at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: When you dated my mom, I saw you kiss her
dialog: once. You looked like such a good
dialog: kisser.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - EVENING
text: It's the couple making love again; this time we're close
text: enough to make out Colleen's face underneath Josh, who is
text: working with speed, if not exact precision.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (V.O.)
dialog: My mother would die.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (V.O.)
dialog: Let's shut up and not kill her.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: Oh my God!
scene_heading: INT. ROBIN'S BEDROOM - EVENING
text: Peter has changed and is on the bed; his head propped up by
text: pillows; he stairs blankly at the door.
scene_heading: INT. ROBIN'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING
text: Robin is sitting alone in the living room, in the same spot
text: Peter had been sitting earlier.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - EVENING
text: Alyssa and George are still beside each other in bed.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: It's not what I was expecting.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What did you think it would be?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I don't know...
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: More like when I kissed Sam.
text: Alyssa sits up in bed.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (CONT'D)
dialog: More like that.
text: She stands and grabs his big toe.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks for your time.
text: Alyssa waves goodbye and leaves. George is confused by it
dialog: all.
scene_heading: INT. COLLEEN'S BEDROOM - EVENING
text: Josh looks as though he's been struck by a hammer as he lay
text: on his back with his mouth slack. Under the sheet, low down,
text: Colleen is swallowing her pride and showing off her
text: technique. A sudden blaring noise, AN ALARM, pierces Josh's
text: throaty groan. Colleen jumps off the bed, the sheet still
text: haunting her head.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: Oh my God! Get dressed! Get dressed!
scene_heading: INT. COLLEEN'S KITCHEN - EVENING
text: Alyssa closes the French door she entered through and rushes
text: to the alarm panel as the siren blares.
scene_heading: INT. COLLEEN'S BEDROOM - EVENING
text: Colleen and Josh are frantically pulling on clothes as the
text: noise throws them off balance.
scene_heading: INT. COLLEEN'S KITCHEN - EVENING
text: With the ALARM OFF, Alyssa walks to the entry.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Mom!?
scene_heading: INT. COLLEEN'S BEDROOM - EVENING
text: Josh has pulled on his underwear backwards; only speed
dialog: counts.
scene_heading: INT. COLLEEN'S ENTRY - EVENING
text: Alyssa glances around before heading up the stairs.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: INT. COLLEEN'S BEDROOM - EVENING
text: Without a knock, Alyssa opens the door. The room is empty,
text: but the bed is messed.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Mom?
speaker_heading: COLLEEN (O.S.)
dialog: Here, honey!
text: Alyssa walks to the master bath, following the voice.
scene_heading: INT. COLLEEN'S BATHROOM - EVENING
text: Colleen is standing above Josh, who is bent over on his
text: knees, with a plunger in the bath.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I completely forgot. I'm so sorry, Josh.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Josh's face is flushed red and beaded with sweat.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: I put him to work.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: What's wrong?
text: It takes a second for Colleen to realize that Alyssa is
text: talking about the plumbing.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: I couldn't get it to go down.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: And why was the alarm on?
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: You'd better call and cancel.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: Oh God, we don't want the police!
text: Colleen is anxious as she rushes out. Josh stands and wipes
text: the sweat from his forehead.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: What's going on?
text: Josh fumbles and fidgets, finally finding a way out.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What's the deal with you and Sam?
scene_heading: INT. ROBIN'S KITCHEN - EVENING
text: Robin is fixing dinner as we hear the front door open. Adam
text: is talking as he rushes into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I got to play one video game for three
dialog: hours straight!
text: Ryan enters right behind him.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Wouldn't you move to another one if the
dialog: one you were playing made you look
dialog: stupid?
text: Robin checks the entry to the kitchen - no Sam.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: That's how you get things right is to
dialog: always try and never give up. Huh, Mom?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I guess it depends on what you give up
dialog: on.
text: Robin's face lights up as Sam walks into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: There were no PG's. So I just gave them
dialog: money to play games.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Can you stay for dinner?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Depends on what I'd give up on.
text: Robin opens the oven and shows Sam a platter of lasagna.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
text: It looks like a trap.
text: Robin turns to Adam, excited at having Sam stay for dinner.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Go tell your father we're eating.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Dad's home, already?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
text: In the bedroom.
text: Adam takes off in a run as Sam walks to the sink and washes
text: his hands before grabbing a stack of plates for dinner. He
text: arranges the five on the table and then heads back for
text: utensils as Adam runs back in.
speaker_heading: ADAM
text: He's not there.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: He's here. Check the bathroom.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I checked everywhere. He's not there.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - MORNING
text: Guster's at the door, whining. George and Sam are asleep.
scene_heading: INT. COLLEEN'S KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Colleen is sitting alone at the kitchen table, drinking
text: coffee as Alyssa walks in.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: What are you doing up so early?
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: I couldn't sleep last night.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm
dialog: not.
text: Colleen is trembling as Alyssa pours herself a big bowl of
dialog: Lucky Charms.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: Why? What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Uh...using Josh like that.
text: Alyssa eats her cereal as Colleen bursts into a confession.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: I will never forgive myself. Never,
dialog: Alyssa. I know I took advantage. It's
dialog: inexcusable. Oh, God. I should have my
text: head examined.
text: Alyssa looks confused as she swallows her Lucky Charms.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: He said you asked him to tighten your
dialog: toilet seat, too. That's so uncool.
text: Colleen quickly nods.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: I won't do it again. I swear.
text: Alyssa keeps an eye on her mother as she continues on with
dialog: her cereal.
scene_heading: EXT. DOKOS HOUSE - MORNING
text: Guster is taking a dump on the immaculate lawn. David Dokos
text: rushes from the house dressed in a suit and picks up the shit
text: with a gloved hand and heaves it at Guster as the dog trots
text: back to safety. Tom and Barbara, the old early walkers of
text: the street, stop and watch as David picks up more crap and
text: tosses it onto George's driveway. He notices Tom and
dialog: Barbara.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Mind your own fucking business!
text: Tom and Barbara stay silent as David Dokos walks back into
text: his house and slams the front door shut.
scene_heading: EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - LATE MORNING
text: Josh is in eleventh gear on his ten speed peddling like a
dialog: demon for the Beck's house.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - LATE MORNING
text: Robin pulls to a stop and Ryan and Adam run from the Range
text: Rover to Sam and Alyssa, who are helping an ELECTRICIAN
text: (DALE) install the outside boxes and sockets.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Dad's disappeared!
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: He was there and then he wasn't!
text: Sam faces his mother as she walks toward the house.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He hasn't called?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Who are you?
text: Robin shakes her head "no" to Sam. Dale turns to face Adam.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I'm the electrician.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I'm the builder!
text: Sam turns back to finish what he was working on as Alyssa
text: grabs Adam with a hug.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - MORNING
text: George is swallowing two pills as Robin knocks on the half
text: open door, opening it all the way in the process.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Is your back still killing you?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I didn't think you'd come today.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I kept thinking about it, what you
dialog: said... I hope you were trying to keep me
dialog: away fro the sake of me.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No. Mostly me.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Peter left me yesterday.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Left you?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: No goodbye. No fuck you. No 'Are you in
dialog: love with George?'
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: 'I'll be in the bedroom.'
text: Robin walks to George and holds on to his shirt.
speaker_heading: ROBIN (CONT'D)
dialog: I couldn't walk in there.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So he left.
text: She rests the side of her head against his chest. He kisses
text: her hair. Outside, a hammer beats a reminder that they're
text: not alone. The ocean drowns the sound long enough for Robin
dialog: to kiss George's chin;
text: and in that instant, the instant where everything but the
text: touch washes away, George kisses Robin with such punch that
text: it knocks them onto the bed. They continue to forget
text: everything as they roll with the punch.
speaker_heading: SAM (O.S.)
dialog: Dad, Dale needs to know..
text: Sam stops at the jamb of the open door as his mother and
text: father scramble to their feet from the bed.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I had a kink in my...
text: As George falters, Robin feels compelled to complete the lie.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
text: Back. Neck. Back.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SAM
text: The door was open.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (a quick confession)
dialog: I don't know what I'm doing.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It won't happen again.
text: George and Robin are flustered, embarrassed by being caught,
text: something Sam clearly relishes.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Dale wants to know if we should run an
text: outside outlet for Christmas lights with
dialog: a switch inside?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Absolutely.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Have him put it on a separate line. At
dialog: Christmas, we'll pact it so full of
dialog: lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
text: Sam laughs, grabs the door and closes it on his parents.
text: Robin slumps, truly embarrassed.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I could die.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: So could I.
text: George touches Robin's chin, draws her head up. He stares at
text: her, afraid to say what he needs to say.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Are you going to kiss me?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It's not my back that's killing me.
text: Robin furrows her brow, not understanding. George surrounds
text: her head with his hands and kisses her forehead.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - MORNING
text: Adam and Ryan are helping Dale run the electrical lines;
text: Alyssa and Sam drill screws into the second story
text: floorboards. MUSIC is playing loud on the radio.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER VIEW
text: Josh stops peddling quite a distance from George's house and
text: gets off to search for Alyssa. Only seeing Adam, Ryan and
text: Dale, Josh pulls out his cell and dials.
scene_heading: INT. COLLEEN'S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Frustrated and anxious, Colleen slips off the dress she's
text: wearing and tries another one as the phone RINGS.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S STREET - MORNING
text: Josh is standing behind a tree, talking on his cell phone as
text: he stares at George's house.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I don't see her.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Please just open the door when I knock.
text: He slips the phone back in his pocket, hops back on the bike
text: and makes a beeline toward Colleen's house.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (O.S.)
dialog: Josh?
text: Busted, Josh has no choice but to join Alyssa.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I was hoping...you could..you know. Go
dialog: for a ride?
text: Alyssa and Sam are leaning out the framed second story
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: On the handlebars or your shoulders?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Are you afraid of heights?
text: Sam walks away from the window and goes back to work.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Can you help us out?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: My parents cut my allowance off. Without
dialog: a car, I'm totally screwed.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
text: George is paying Sam ten dollars an hour.
text: Sam sticks his head back out the window.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for
dialog: two hours.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: What?
text: Josh is fuming as he stares at Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's just a joke. A stupid joke.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I could use the money.
text: Sam turns away from Josh. George walks out the garage as he
text: wipes his eyes.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Hey, George! I recruited some help for
dialog: the roof!
text: George walks to Josh and extends his hand.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: George Nelson.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Josh.
text: Adam races to George with a hug - something unexpected. Adam
text: rushes back to work as George breaks into a smile. Alyssa
text: rushes down the stairs and straight into George's arms.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Me too!
text: George is still smiling as he tucks a strand of Alyssa's hair
text: behind her ear. Ryan sort of saunters over to George with
text: his hands sunk deep in his pockets. Without asking, George
text: wraps his arms around Ryan with a hug. Afterward:
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I just wanted to know where Mom was?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh. Sorry.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: It's okay.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: She needs to be alone, I think.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Because Dad left?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: She's a little sad, is all.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I don't even care if he ever comes back.
text: Ryan walks back to Adam, who's been standing still,
dialog: listening.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Josh, you look like you could use a hug.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: No...I'm okay. I'm okay.
text: George is too quick with his hug. Josh is stiff as a board.
text: Sam looks pissed as he walks away from the second story
text: window and resumes screwing the floorboards. George sets his
text: eyes on Dale as he opens his arms wide.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Don't even think about it.
text: George walks toward Dale with his arms still extended.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, they got me started.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I swear to God, I'll use these wires and
dialog: shock you so bad your tongue will turn
dialog: black.
text: Adam and Ryan are excited as George closes the distance.
text: Finally, Dale drops the harmless wire and takes off in a run.
scene_heading: INT. COLLEEN'S KITCHEN - LATE MORNING
text: Colleen is pacing the kitchen in a silky dress we haven't
text: seen before. Finally, she grabs the phone.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - LATE MORNING
text: George is propped up on the chaise lounge next to the patio
text: table where everyone has dropped their crap. Sam and Josh
text: are sheeting the roof with tarpaper. Robin is still in the
text: garage. One of two cell phones on the table begins to RING.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Would you get it for me?
text: Dale is in the middle of wiring a box.
speaker_heading: JOSH (O.S.)
dialog: Just let mine ring!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I guess... I don't know.
text: George picks up the offender, unsure whose phone it is.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: INT. COLLEEN'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Where are you? You're driving me crazy,
dialog: waiting like this. I want you in me now!
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: George nearly drops the phone; he sits up straight.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Colleen?!
scene_heading: INT. COLLEEN'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Colleen sits down, panicked.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I..I..I.. George?!
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: George holds the phone out and examines it for a second.
speaker_heading: JOSH (O.S.)
dialog: Is it mine?!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: God, I hope not.
speaker_heading: DALE (O.S.)
dialog: That's not mine.
speaker_heading: JOSH (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, shit!
text: Josh trips, slips and slides off the roof to the ground below
text: as Alyssa lets out a loud SCREAM.
scene_heading: INT. COLLEEN'S KITCHEN - LATE MORNING
text: Colleen tosses the receiver as though it were a ball on fire.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER
text: Everyone, including Robin, is circled around Josh, who is
text: sprawled on the ground.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I'm okay. I'm fine. Maybe I'll go home.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Is that bone sticking out?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Don't move!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm an idiot to have you up there.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: No. It's my fault.
text: An ambulance is HEARD approaching. Colleen runs from her
text: house - she's now dressed more appropriately in Levi's and a
dialog: blouse.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: I heard a scream!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: If I could just stand up.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Josh fell.
text: Colleen stops a few feet short and covers her mouth with a
text: trembling hand.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I think he might have broken a leg.
text: The ambulance silences the siren as it turns onto the cul-de
text: sac and stops in front of George's house.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - EARLY AFTERNOON
text: Robin, George and Sam are sitting at the patio table as Ryan
text: and Adam play catch with Guster.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: Two ribs, a finger, a leg, a bruised
dialog: kidney and a mild concussion aren't bad
text: considering he landed on brick.
text: Neither Robin nor Sam attempts a response. Finally:
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I better get the kids home.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Not a perfect day.
text: Robin stands. George stands because Robin's standing.
text: Without warning, Robin begins to cry again. Ryan and Adam
text: stop playing ball. Sam studies her before finally lowering
text: his eyes. With her kids looking on, George stands still,
text: hesitant to comfort her. There's a moment where all that
text: there is, where the only thing seen or heard is Robin's pain.
text: After an awkward amount of time, she wipes her eyes, wipes
text: her nose, crosses around the table to Sam and kisses the top
text: of his head, then his cheek. Without a word, she walks to
text: her car and climbs in; Ryan and Adam quickly join her in the
dialog: car.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - NIGHT
text: George is brushing his teeth, dribbling and foaming over the
text: only sink in the garage. Sam is propped up in bed with
text: Guster, dressed on top of the sheets, fingering through a
text: stack of CD's. He glances over at his father twice before
dialog: speaking.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You look like shit, lately.
text: George spits and rinses, facing Sam as he wipes his mouth.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You look better than ever.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't think Mom cares that much that
dialog: my...that Peter left.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: She seemed upset.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What's wrong with your back?
text: Sam tries to look slightly less interested than he is by
text: continuing to flip through the CD's. George sits down.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, do you need to have surgery on it
dialog: or what? Because those pills you're
dialog: taking are for a lot of pain. And you're
text: going through them quick.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Are you taking them still?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No, but I count them. In a sock isn't
dialog: new, you know?
text: This is not easy for George; he fumbles a bit before
dialog: answering.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm having a problem with cancer.
text: Sam stops flipping though the CD's.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't know what that means. What kind
dialog: of problem?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: The kind where there isn't really an
dialog: answer.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I still don't know what that means.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I wanted you here so we could have a few
dialog: months together. Maybe everything
dialog: happens for a reason. Something bad to
dialog: force something good.
text: Sam looks somewhat panicked.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What? Are you dying?
text: This is not easy for George; he fumbles a bit before
dialog: answering.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm having a problem with cancer.
text: Sam stops flipping through the CD's.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't know what that means. What kind
dialog: of problem?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: The kind where there isn't really an
dialog: answer.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I still don't know what that means.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I wanted you here so we could have a few
dialog: months together. Maybe everything
dialog: happens for a reason. Something bad to
dialog: force something good.
text: Sam looks somewhat panicked.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What? Are you dying?
text: George nods his head.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: And you told Mom today?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yes.
text: Sam whacks the CD's off his stomach; they scatter across the
text: floor. Guster scoots off the bed in a panic.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Fuck you! You knew you were dying from
dialog: the start!
text: Sam bounds out of bed in a rage.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: We're all dying from the start.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You lied to me!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I would have lied to me if I thought I'd
dialog: believe it.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: This was all for your sake, wasn't it?
dialog: Having me here? Trying to get me to like
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I never tried to get you to like me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I tried to get you to love me.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Well, congratulations! You fucking
dialog: pulled it off!
text: Sam storms out of the garage.
scene_heading: INT. COLLEEN'S ENTRY - NIGHT
text: Colleen pulls a robe around her nightgown as the doorbell
text: RINGS again and again. She flips on a light and opens the
text: door. Sam backs away from the door as he talks.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Is Alyssa here?
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: It's midnight. What's the matter, Sam?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Nothing. My dad's dying. I really need
dialog: to talk to Alyssa.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (O.S.)
dialog: Sam?
text: Alyssa is leaning over the upstairs railing. Sam walks up
text: the stairs as Colleen closes the door.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - EARLY MORNING
text: Sea lions romp on a rock offshore as gulls circle above. The
text: sun sheets the morning on the water that's blinding.
scene_heading: INT. ALYSSA'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING
text: Alyssa is under the covers holding onto Sam, who is still
text: dressed. Both are asleep.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - EARLY MORNING
text: George is in bed in pain. A prescription bottle is open
text: beside him and pills are scattered on the sheet. A KNOCK on
text: the door forces George to gather the pills and hide the
dialog: bottle.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: It's open.
text: Kurt the cop opens the door dressed in civilian clothes.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: It's my day off. I thought I'd help with
text: the plumbing.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I need you to do me a favor.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: God, you look like crap, George.

dialog: I want you to find someone for me.
scene_heading: EXT. COLLEEN'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
text: Colleen walks out her front door straight to her neighbor's
text: house. After a bit of RINGING and a bit of waiting, Tom (of
text: the walking Tom and Barbara) answers the door in a bathrobe.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: Does your son still own a company that
dialog: builds houses?
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - LATE MORNING
text: Dale is wiring with Adam and Ryan helping. Kurt, Robin and
text: Colleen are setting up and sealing the plastic plumbing
text: pipes. Two new men (GREG and MIGUEL) are on the roof,
text: finishing up where Josh fell down. MUSIC is playing on the
text: radio. George is asleep on the chaise lounge. Alyssa walks
text: across the grass and stops to stare at George. Tears well in
text: her eyes. Alyssa continues on to the house and walks up the
dialog: stairs.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
text: He's been asleep for hours.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Is Sam okay?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: He won't leave my room.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Will he talk to me?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: No.
text: Robin accepts the answer. Slowly, they all return to work.
speaker_heading: MONTAGE
text: The day is productive as we see the black drainpipes and the
text: copper water runs coming together like a maze. The roof is
text: shingled and the wiring is nearly complete. Whether awake or
text: asleep, George spends the day in the chaise lounge.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - LATER
text: A city inspector's truck pulls to a stop and Bob Larsen steps
text: out with a clipboard and a concerned look on his face.
text: George is dozing on drugs.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You're not a plumber, Kurt.
text: Kurt finishes hooking in a plugged tee at a turn and stands.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: I worked every summer with my dad. Check
dialog: out what I've done.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It's not whether it's good or bad. You
dialog: know that. It's whether your licensed.
text: Frustrated, Kurt glances around at all his good work before
dialog: answering.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Are you still renting that illegal non
dialog: conforming studio under your house for a
dialog: thousand a month?
text: Bob opens his clipboard and checks a number of items off.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Okay. Looks good to me.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Oh, that's embarrassing. That was too
dialog: easy. At least look around. I really
dialog: did do it right.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: That isn't why I'm here, anyway.
text: George wakes up and quickly hones in on Bob.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I've been dreading you.
text: Bob walks toward George as he talks.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Mr. Stevens. One of your neighbors is
dialog: adamant your home has exceeded its
dialog: approved height. He's filed to have
dialog: construction stopped immediately.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: It's thirty feet.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, if it is, we have a problem.
text: George stands, he appears slightly shaky.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I have the permit.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: After your last extension request and
dialog: with Design Review and the Board of
dialog: Adjustment and the appeals to the city
dialog: council, was there an amended permit?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: To the patio and one north-facing
dialog: window...
dialog: (suddenly realizing)
text: And six inches to the height.
text: George sits back down. Everyone emerges from the house to
text: join George and Bob.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: David Dokos?
text: Bob nods.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn,
dialog: day after day?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don't let him. He just loves to.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: He'll make you tear the entire roof off
dialog: rather than give you any satisfaction.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm afraid you won't be able to continue
dialog: until this is settled. You can always go
dialog: back and file an appeal.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That would take weeks.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Months.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Just so you know, we'll be here working
dialog: tomorrow and every day after until this
text: house is finished.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: He'll call us again and then he'll call
text: the police. He has an attorney on
dialog: retainer.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Just so you know.
text: Robin turns and walks back into the house. Colleen, Alyssa,
text: Adam and Ryan soon follow.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: If he hears a hammer, he'll have you
dialog: arrested.
text: Robin picks up the hammer and pounds a nail into a piece of
text: wallboard. Dale, Miguel, Greg and Kurt walk back to the
text: house and go back to work. Bob glances at George who shrugs.
scene_heading: INT. COLLEEN'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT
text: Colleen is watching the news as Alyssa walks in to say
dialog: goodnight.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I'm going to bed.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: Has he eaten anything at all?
text: Alyssa shakes her head "no" as Colleen flips on the TV.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd be more comfortable if he slept in
text: the guestroom.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't
dialog: slept with Josh. And George would be
dialog: more comfortable if he weren't dying.
text: Colleen is embarrassed Alyssa knows the truth.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (CONT'D)
dialog: Comfort doesn't mean that much when just
dialog: getting through the night is the goal,
dialog: Mom.
text: Alyssa walks out. Colleen curls up and hides clutching
text: pillows on the couch.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - NIGHT
text: George is shaking and sweating as he tries to crawl off the
text: bed to his sock drawer. Guster wakes up and hops off Sam's
text: bed to lick George on the face.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Please...I can't.
text: George is in real pain as he drops to the floor on his back.
text: He winces and cries out as he pushes himself forward with his
text: legs toward the dresser. George suddenly stops pushing; his
text: legs slump flat on the concrete floor. His eyes flutter shut
text: as Guster continues to lick his face.
scene_heading: INT. ALYSSA'S BATHROOM - MORNING
text: Alyssa is dressed, combing through wet hair when the sound of
text: construction distracts her. She opens her window and sticks
text: her head out. Suddenly excited, she pulls her head back in.
scene_heading: INT. ALYSSA'S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Sam is in bed as Alyssa speeds out of the bathroom.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: There are like twenty people working on
dialog: your dad's house!
text: Alyssa bolts for the door, but stops short as she faces Sam.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (CONT'D)
dialog: If it were my father, I'd wanna spend
dialog: every second with him I had left.
text: Sam doesn't face her, doesn't even attempt to look up.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You hate your father.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: If he tricked me into loving him, is what
dialog: I meant.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You'd hate him for the trick.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Not if what he left me was real.
text: Alyssa leaves, closing the door behind her. Sam stays put.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - MORNING
text: Colleen is talking to Tom and Barbara as they stand to the
text: side of the house where a throng of men assemble the house.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: He pulled this crew off a tract in
dialog: Newport. They're the best.
text: Robin pulls to a stop on the street and Adam and Ryan run out
text: to gawk at all the workers.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: I hired some help.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (O.S.)
dialog: Mom?!
text: Colleen glances back as Alyssa runs to join the group.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: Atonement.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Who are all these people?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Where's George?
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
text: I think he's still sleeping.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER VIEW
text: Robin walks to the garage door and KNOCKS. Guster barks.
text: Robin KNOCKS again before opening the door.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - MORNING
text: Guster is beside George on the floor. Robin rushes in and
text: kneels down.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: George!?
text: She presses her hand against George's cheek.
speaker_heading: ROBIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Wake up...You're still warm.
text: George's eyes flutter open. Robin leans down and kisses him
text: on the cheek. George focuses on Robin; he tries to speak,
text: stops, and tries again. Finally, in a weak voice, we hear:
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Stop licking me.
scene_heading: INT. COLLEEN'S ENTRY - MORNING
text: Alyssa bursts into the house and rushes up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. ALYSSA'S ROOM - MORNING
text: Sam is sitting on the edge of the bed as Alyssa enters.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Your dad's going to the hospital!
text: Sam doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on!
text: Alyssa holds out her hand as we HEAR the ambulance approach.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't wanna go.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: He asked where you were! He wants you
dialog: with him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't wanna go.
text: Sam is nearly pleading, frightened to move. Alyssa walks
text: out. The siren stops. The front door closes. Sam sits
dialog: still.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
text: The house is coming together incredibly fast with all the
text: workers. Tom and Barbara are supervising the crew. David
text: Dokos whips around the corner in his black Mercedes and parks
text: in his driveway, rushing over as he yells.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Nothing is built until the Board of
dialog: Adjustment hears the appeal!
text: David is searching for George, finally settling for Tom.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I should have reported you for tossing
dialog: that piece of dog doo.
text: Tom's face is flushed; Barbara calms him by grabbing his arm.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Tom, let's not overreact now.
text: David Dokos stomps his feet and thrusts his fist into the
text: air, as a child might if he were overreacting.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I want this fucking piece of shit
dialog: construction stopped now and I want that
dialog: goddamn roof ripped off and lowered and I
dialog: don't care if I have to spend a shit load
dialog: of money to get it done!! I will do
dialog: it!!!
text: Tom and Barbara simply stare at him in disbelief. David
text: walks back to his house. Tom turns to his wife.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I want this house finished before he can
dialog: stop it.
text: Tom rolls up his sleeves and walks toward the house to help.
scene_heading: INT. COLLEEN'S ENTRY - EVENING
text: Colleen and Alyssa walk into the house listless - both look
text: tired and sad.
scene_heading: INT. ALYSSA'S BEDROOM - EVENING
text: Alyssa enters the room, walks into the bathroom. Sam is
dialog: gone.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Sam?
scene_heading: INT. ROBIN'S FAMILY ROOM - EVENING
text: Adam and Ryan are sitting next to each other on the floor
text: subdued, tossing a ball to Guster. The kitchen door opens
text: and Peter walks into the family room. Adam is the first to
text: notice but the last to react. Ryan stands as Guster barks.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Guster, be quiet.
text: Peter has a growth of beard and is dressed in Levi's and a
text: knit shirt - he doesn't look like himself.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You got a dog?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: It's not ours. It's George's.
text: Peter nods.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I've missed you guys.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Why?
text: Ryan is tough - not giving an inch. Peter stares at his
text: sons, ashamed that the question could be asked. Adam stands
text: and walks to this father, takes his hand.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll tell Mom you're here.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING
text: George is asleep, looking dead with tubes in his arms. We
text: HEAR a bit of the song by Warren Zevon, "MY SHIT'S FUCKED
dialog: UP." 'Well, I went to the doctor/I said 'I'm feeling kind of
dialog: rough'/He said, 'I'll break it to you, son, your shit's
dialog: fucked up.'
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - EVENING
text: Sam is alone on the roof in the fading light, stringing party
text: lights over the shingles and under the eves.
scene_heading: INT. ROBIN'S FAMILY ROOM - EVENING
text: Robin couldn't look worse as she walks down the hall to the
text: family room with Ryan. Peter is standing alone. Ryan joins
text: Adam on the floor with Guster. Robin stops and stands ten
text: feet from Peter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I thought maybe... I know it's late...but
dialog: if you're hungry...
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - EVENING
text: The sun has set as Sam stands at the edge of the cliff trying
text: to garner the courage to jump. After the sound of a wave
text: crashing against the cliff, Sam closes his eyes and leaps off
text: the edge of the earth.
scene_heading: INT. ALYSSA'S ROOM - EVENING
text: Alyssa is sitting on the edge of her bed as Colleen stops
text: beside the open door.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: Are you doing okay?
text: Alyssa shakes her head "no". Colleen walks into the room and
text: sits down beside her daughter. Alyssa rests her head on her
text: mother's shoulder.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING
text: Robin, Peter, Ryan and Adam are in the middle of dinner as
text: Adam excitedly tries to explain all that he and his brother
dialog: have accomplished.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: And we got to take all the old paint off
dialog: all the doors and then George taught us
dialog: how to stain everything and he even let
dialog: me choose the color I liked best! And he
dialog: said he loved me!
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: We did a lot of the wiring too.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: With Dale. Oh, and I got to drill a hole
dialog: into a board to put the wire through!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I've never heard you so excited about
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Maybe you can come help us too?!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'd like that.
text: Peter glances at Robin.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Sam is still wet as he walks down the hall. We HEAR more of
dialog: the Warren Zevon song. 'I had a dream/Ah, shucks, oh,
dialog: well/Now it's all fucked up/It's shot to hell.'
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Sam enters the room as a NURSE scurries to catch up.
speaker_heading: NUR
dialog: I'm afraid no one's allowed in here now.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He's my dad.
text: Sam is staring at George, who is either asleep or
text: unconscious. The nurse finally relents and walks out. Sam
text: sits in a chair beside the bed and begins to cry. Slowly,
text: George's arm slides out beyond the railing of the bed, his
text: hand open. Sam does his best to stop crying.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I brought you something.
text: Sam pulls out a pair of sunglasses from his shirt pocket.
text: George shakes death and drugs away as he manages to open his
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: I don't wanna go, Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Here.
text: Sam gently slides the sunglasses over his father's eyes; he
text: rushes to the window and pulls the curtains back.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you see?
text: Sam walks back to the bed and pulls it toward the window,
text: stretching the cords and tubes to their limit. He grabs the
text: remote and raises George's head. Off in the distance,
text: against the backdrop of an endless black ocean, George's
text: house is seemingly on fire with lights. Pain can't stop a
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
text: It's almost done.
text: George takes hold of Sam's hand with his own. They continue
text: to stare at the lit house holding hands.
scene_heading: INT. ROBIN'S ENTRY - NIGHT
text: The door opens and Robin, Adam, Ryan and Peter are greeted by
text: Guster, who bounces around like a wired rabbit.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Go brush your teeth and get right into
text: bed. It's late.
text: Adam runs to Robin for a kiss, then grabs Peter with a hug.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Goodnight.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Goodnight.
text: Adam runs up the stairs, Guster right on his heels. Ryan is
text: staring at his father.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Do you know anything about building a
dialog: house?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I guess I could teach you some things.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Okay.
text: Robin sneaks a quick kiss on Ryan's cheek as he heads for the
text: stairs. After he's gone, Robin turns back to Peter.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I hardly recognize you with a beard.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That was my plan...to be hardly
dialog: recognizable to you as me.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I feel in love with George again.
text: Peter nods, something he already knows.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'll see you tomorrow.
text: Robin nods. There's a moment where it's clear that Peter
text: doesn't want to leave and Robin doesn't want him to leave,
text: but after the moment passes, Peter walks out and Robin sits
text: down at the base of the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. ALYSSA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Colleen and Alyssa are asleep together on the bed.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
text: Sam is up on a ladder, pounding copper nails into cedar
text: shingles that face the house. Alyssa runs across the grass.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Where are you?!
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Floating to Catalina.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: What?
text: Sam steps off the ladder. Alyssa wraps her arms around him.
text: Sam removes sleepy bugs from Alyssa's eyes before he kisses
text: her. A police car stops in front of the house and Kurt steps
text: out. Alyssa and Sam turn to face him.
speaker_heading: KURT
text: He said he heard hammering.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Who?
text: Before Kurt can answer, David Dokos storms out of his house
text: and trudges toward them talking.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: My attorney is driving down from Newport
dialog: Beach. If I hear one more nail being
dialog: hammered, I swear to God before this is
dialog: all over I'll end up owing this house!
text: As Sam is staring at David Dokos, a hint of recognition
text: crosses his face.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Mr. Dokos says that your father missed
text: his height envelope by six inches.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: He wants the entire roof taken off and
dialog: lowered.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Wait a minute.
text: A wave of fear rushes through David Dokos that's instantly
text: visible.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you drive a black Mercedes?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No.
text: Sam figures out why we knows David Dokos - from the aborted
text: blowjob in the black Mercedes.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm going back to my house to wait for my
dialog: lawyer.
text: David starts to leave, but Sam stops him with:
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Are you sure we need lawyers?
text: David's face is sheet white as he forces himself back around.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Because all we're really talking about is
dialog: six inches, right?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Are you threatening me?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm sixteen years old. I'm underage.
dialog: How could I possibly threaten you?
text: David Dokos stares at Sam for a long time before glancing at
text: Kurt and his police uniform for just a second.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Would you like to help us finish the
dialog: house, Mr. Dokos?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes, I would.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: What the fuck?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Everything happens for a reason. That's
dialog: what my dad said.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Then you tell me, what just happened?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: The payoff.
text: Sam walks back to the ladder and hammer, leaving Kurt and
text: Alyssa confounded. David takes a step back.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'll just...change clothes.
text: Sam pounds in another shingle as David walks quickly back to
dialog: his house.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING
text: George is unconscious as Robin enters and sits down beside
text: him with a video camera.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I found the last time you were happy.
text: Robin adjusts the viewfinder and presses play on the camera.
text: George doesn't wake up. On the tiny screen, we see a younger
text: George in the ocean, his arms wrapped around six-year old
text: Sam; he shields Sam from the waves and kisses his son's hair.
text: Robin rests the camera on the bed as the video continues to
text: play. She takes hold of George's hand and begins to weep as
text: she presses her head on his chest. An envelope with Robin
text: and Sam's name on it rests on the nightstand beside the bed.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - MORNING
text: Twenty men along with Tom and Barbara, Alyssa and Colleen,
text: Sam and David Dokos are painting; installing windows, floors
text: or cabinets as the house begins to take its final shape.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - MORNING
text: Peter stops and steps out of his car as Adam and Ryan race
dialog: for the house.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: It's almost done!
text: Sam walks out the front door.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Do you guys feel like painting?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: What color?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Red.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I love red! That's my favorite color!
text: Adam and Ryan walk into the house as Sam focuses on Peter,
text: who keeps his distance.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You don't look like you.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Either do you.
text: Peter glances down at his work clothes.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I thought I might be able to help, but it
dialog: looks like you have all you can handle.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Do you like red?
text: Peter nods, hesitates for a moment before walking up the
text: driveway to Sam.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: George's bed is empty, stripped of everything. Robin is
text: still sitting in a chair beside the bed, a letter resting on
text: her lap. A NURSE stops at the door.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Are you sure we can't call anyone?
text: Robin shakes her head "no". The nurse moves on.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: From the outside, the house is finished: windows in, doors
text: on, roof shingled. The sun drops behind the house, causing a
text: halo of bright light to envelop it.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Most of the workers have gone home, because most of the work
text: is done. All the floor are hand-scrapped cherry; huge beams
text: and wood planks lend a strength to the ceiling. The kitchen
text: cabinets are in; the bathrooms are complete. Sam, Ryan,
text: Alyssa, Adam and Peter are the only ones left. Outside, we
text: hear a car pull to a stop.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Mom!
text: Adam and Ryan run down the stairs. Peter stops cleaning a
text: brush and walks to the window as Sam stands still.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Adam runs to Robin and meets her mid-yard with a hug.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: When does George get to come see his
dialog: house?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: It's so beautiful.
text: Adam and Robin are staring at the house. Ryan can see the
text: strain on his mother's face.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Is George okay?
text: All Robin can do is shake her head "no".
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Sam backs away from the window. Peter turns to face him.
text: Standing straight as he can, being as brave as he can, tears
text: well in Sam's eyes as he softly shakes. Peter walks to Sam
text: and wraps his arms around him.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (V.O.)
dialog: I always thought of myself as a house. I
dialog: was always what I lived in. It didn't
dialog: need to be big. It didn't even need to
dialog: be beautiful. I just needed to be mine.
dialog: I became what I was meant to be. I built
dialog: myself a life. I built myself a house.
text: Sam clings to Peter, completely lost in sorrow.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Adam and Ryan have their arms wrapped around their mother as
text: we pull back and watch the sun set the sky off in dazzling
text: hues of orange and red.
scene_heading: INT. RANGE ROVER - ONE WEEK LATER
text: Robin is driving with Sam beside her in a low-middle income
text: neighborhood in Santa Ana. Sam is holding the letter.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You're sure about this?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You could keep it and rent it out?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: This is what he wants.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I read the letter. You read the will.
dialog: He wants you to keep it. To live in it
dialog: some day.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but
dialog: this what he was hoping for.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Maybe it's what I want.
text: It's clear to see that Robin's proud of Sam's decision. She
text: checks an address on a piece of paper and pulls to a stop.
text: Sam steps out of the car, holding the letter.
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA ANA APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING
text: Sam is shaking slightly as he walks up the cracked concrete
text: walk to the door. He RINGS the bell.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (V.O.)
dialog: Twenty-one years ago, my father crossed a
dialog: double-line. He changed my life and the
dialog: life of a little girl forever with that
dialog: mistake. I just can't stop thinking
dialog: about her.
text: A WOMAN in her mid-twenties opens the door in her wheelchair.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Hello.
text: Sam is very nervous as he reaches in his pocket and pulls out
text: a set of keys.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: My father built you a house...
text: The woman is confused as Sam holds out the keys.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - MORNING
text: The house is majestic in its setting among the trees and
text: grass, on the jagged just of rock that accepts the constant
text: crash of ocean against it with a solid permanence. This is
dialog: where, if you were a house, you would want to be built.
text: THE END.
