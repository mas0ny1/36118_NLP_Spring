text: HER POV: the Sentinel lying still as death in his bed...
text: The Nun says something m.o.s., gets no response. Then she
text: looks down...
text: HER POV: that ornate box lying on the floor...
text: AN HOUR LATER: THE PRIEST, 50s, leans over a small table
text: in the corner of the Sentinel's room. He is a strong-
text: willed man, his eyes direct, humorless. In b.g. the Nun
text: watches as the priest reads...
text: PRIEST'S POV: an old weatherbeaten notebook. At the top
text: of the yellowed page is written: “Brotherhood of Sleep".
text: The priest reads on, his brow furrowing...
scene_heading: PRIEST'S POV: EXTREME CLOSE-UP. In the middle of a page

scene_heading: EXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY
text: PROFESSOR HOWARD DIRAC, 50s, a theoretical physicist, walks

scene_heading: INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY
text: Professor Dirac is lecturing to a graduate physics class.
text: The class is small. The brightest of the bright. There's
text: WALTER, 30s, Chinese. KELLY, 20s, pretty and outgoing.
text: MULLINS, 30s. FIVE OTHER STUDENTS listen, take notes...
speaker_heading: DIRAC
dialog: Let's talk about our beliefs
dialog: and what we can learn about
dialog: them... We believe nature is
text: solid and time is constant.
dialog: Matter has substance, time a
dialog: direction. There is truth in
text: flesh and solid ground. The
dialog: wind may be invisible, but it's
text: real. Smoke and fire, water
dialog: and light -- they're different,
dialog: not as stone nor steel, but
dialog: they're tangible...
text: Now we see Brian sitting near the back, not paying all that
dialog: much attention to the lecture, looking at:
text: BRIAN'S POV: Catherine, sitting a few rows in front. She
text: listens attentively, taking notes...
text: Brian does stare somewhat dreamily at her...
speaker_heading: DIRAC
dialog: And we assume time has an
dialog: arrow. It is as a clock --
dialog: one second is one second for
dialog: _everyone. Cause precedes
dialog: effect. Fruit rots, water
dialog: flows downstream, we're born,
dialog: we age, we die. The reverse
dialog: never happens.

scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED CHURCH - DAY
text: The priest stands in front of a huge abandoned church
text: somewhere in Los Angeles. It is immense. Gothic. Its
text: spires sweep upward into the sky.
text: The priest looks at the old abandoned church with a sense
dialog: of unease...
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED CHURCH - REAR HALLWAY - DAY
text: A large, dusty hallway. The priest walks slowly along.
text: His FOOTSTEPS ECHO. It's eerie. in here, the sunlight
text: drifting in large, high windows.
text: Now the priest stops at a huge iron door. Extremely old.
text: Mammoth. It looks bomb-proof, earthquake-proof, other Acts-
dialog: of-God proof...
text: The priest pauses a moment by the iron door. Then he takes
text: out that ornate box, removes the key, inserts it in the lock.

scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT
text: Brian walks along. He slows, looks over...
text: BRIAN'S -POV:. Catherine enters the university book store.
text: Brian stops. Glances at his watch. Parks himself by a
text: bench to wait. He looks up...
text: BRIAN'S POV: the night sky. Huge full moon. Leaves of a
text: nearby tree swish silently in f.g. [EFFECT}
text: Brian now looks over...
text: BRIAN'S POV: Catherine comes out of the book store with a

text: The priest is writing at a table-top computer. He is
text: tense, driven. He finishes typing, punches a couple
text: buttons, and the printer begins CLACKING madly as it types
dialog: out what he's written...
text: PRIEST'S POV: the printer. An address CLICKS across the
dialog: page: "Professor Howard Dirac, Feynman Institute of Physics..."
text: CLOSE ON the priest: he has a distant expression.
text: EXTREME CLOSE-UP: the paper, as the printing element SNAPS
dialog: across: "...of the utmost urgency..."

scene_heading: INT. LECTURE HALL ~- DAY
text: Dirac is lecturing again...
speaker_heading: DIRAC
dialog: From Job's friends insisting
dialog: that the good are rewarded and
dialog: the wicked punished, down to
dialog: scientists in the 1930s proving,
dialog: to their horror, a theorem that
dialog: not everything can be proved,
dialog: we've sought to impose order on
dialog: the universe...
text: Brian's not paying attention during this lecture either.
text: He. looks at...
text: BRIAN'S POV: Catherine, who listens interestedly...
speaker_heading: DIRAC
dialog: But we've found something very
dialog: surprising. While order does
dialog: exist in the universe, it is
dialog: not at all what we had in mind...
text: Now Brian glances over at the windows letting in that warm,
dialog: California sunlight...
text: BRIAN'S POV: a black limousine pulls up in front of the

scene_heading: INT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT ~- NIGHT
text: Spartan. Spare. Lots of books stacked around. A messy

dialog: hand. | But he's bad at it, and the card keeps dropping out
text: onthe desk. Frustrated, he glances up now at an old TV
text: set with its sound turned down...
text: BRIAN'S POV: TV. The news is on and the ANCHOR is talking
text: m.0.8. SUPERIMPOSED OVER is the legend: "NEW DISCOVERY".
text: Then we see a photograph of a distant galaxy, and we ZOOM

text: DIRAC'S POV: we MOVE TOWARD a large transparent canister

text: toward this canister as if some sort of evil were being
text: held at bay. It is sealed with a heavy, screw-on lid.
text: It looks vastly old.
text: Dirac and the priest walk, the flashlight beam spinning,
dialog: staring...
text: DIRAC'S POV: MOVE IN CLOSE on the canister. The mold and
text: corrosion on the top and bottom of the canister look pre-
text: historic. Inside the sealed compartment there is a weird
text: water dance -- the liquid, a faint yellowish color, glows
text: and swirls -- somehow alive!
text: Dirac and the priest stop in front of the canister. The
text: priest lights several candles. Below the canister is an
text: 1d book on a podium. The priest carefully opens the book,
text: shines the flashlight on its yellowed pages...

dialog: Latin.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: The original text has been

speaker_heading: DIRAC

speaker_heading: PRIEST
