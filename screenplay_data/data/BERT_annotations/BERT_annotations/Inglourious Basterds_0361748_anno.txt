scene_heading: EXT - DAIRY FARM- DAY
dialog: The modest dairy farm in the countryside of Nancy, France (what the

text: We Read a SUBTITLE in the sky above the farm house;
speaker_heading: CHAPTER ONE
dialog: "ONCE UPON A TIME IN...
speaker_heading: NAZI OCCUPIED FRANCE"
text: This SUBTITLE disappears, and is replaced by another one;
dialog: "1941
dialog: One year into the German
dialog: occupation of France".
text: The farm consists of a house, small barn, and twelve cows spread
dialog: about.
text: The owner of the property, a bull of a man FRENCH FARMER, brings a axe
text: up and down on A tree stump blemishing his property. However simply by
dialog: sight, you'd never know if he's been beating at this stump for the last
dialog: year, or just started today.
speaker_heading: JULIE
text: One of his three pretty teenage daughters, is hanging up laundry on
text: the clothes line. As she hangs up a white bed sheet, she hears a
text: noise, moving the sheet aside she see's;
speaker_heading: JULIE'S POV:
text: A Nazi town car convertible, with two little nazi flags attached to
text: the hood, a NAZI SOLDIER behind the wheel, a NAZI OFFICER alone in the

dialog: Julie, get me some water from the pump
dialog: to wash up with, then get inside with
dialog: your mother.
text: The young lady runs to the water pump by the house. She picks up a
text: basin, and begins pumping, after a few pumps, water comes out
text: splashing into the basin.
text: The French Farmer sits down on the stump he was previously chopping
text: away at, pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes sweat from off
text: his face, and waits for the Nazi convoy to arrive. After living for
text: a year with the sword of Damocles suspended over his head, this may
dialog: very well be the end.
text: Julie finishes filling the water basin, and places it on the window
dialog: sill.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Ready Pappa.
speaker_heading: FARMER
dialog: Thank you darling, now go inside and
dialog: take care of your mother. Don't run.
text: Julie walks inside the farm house and closes the door behind her.
text: As her father stands up from his stump, and moves over to the window
dialog: sill with the water basin...
text: .The SOUND of the ENGINES of the two motorcycles and car get LOUDER.
text: The Farmer SPLASHES water from the basin on his face and down his
text: front. He takes a towel off a nail, and wipes the excess water from
text: his face and chest, as he watches the two motorcycles, the one
text: automobile, and the four representatives of the National Socialist
text: Party come to a halt on his property.
text: We don't move into them, but keep observing them from a distance, like
dialog: the Farmer.
text: The TWO NAZI MOTORCYCLIST are off their bikes, and standing at

text: The NAZI DRIVER has walked around the automobile, and opened the door
dialog: for his superior.

speaker_heading: NAZI OFFICER
dialog: It is a pleasure to meet you Monsieur
dialog: LaPadite, I am Colonel Hans Landa of

scene_heading: INT - LAPADITE FARM HOUSE - DAY
text: The door to the farm house swings open, andtheaFarmer gesturestfor

speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have

speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: Merci. Please have a seat.

text: The Farmer (perfect host) turns to his Wife and says;
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: Charlotte, would you be so good as to get
dialog: The Colonel some wine?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Merci be coupe Monsieur LaPadite, but no
dialog: wine. This being a dairy farm one would
dialog: be safe in assuming you have milk?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Oui.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Then milk is what I prefer.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Very Well.
text: The mother of three, takes a craft of milk out of the ice box,
text: and pours a tall glass of the fresh white liquid for The Colonel.
text: The S.S. Colonel takes a long drink from the glass, then puts it down
text: LOUDLY on the wooden table.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Monsieur, to both your family, and your
dialog: cows, I say; Bravo.
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: Merci.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Please, join me at your

speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: Very well.
text: The French Farmer sit's at his wooden dinner table across from
dialog: The Nazi.
dialog: The Women remain standing.
text: Col Landa leans forward, and says to the Farmer in a low tone of
speaker_heading: CONFIDENTIALLY;
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to
dialog: discuss,' would be better discussed in
dialog: private. You'll notice, I left my men
dialog: outdoors- if it wouldn't offend them,
dialog: could you ask your lovely ladies to step
dialog: outside.
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: You are right.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: G.
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: (to his women)
dialog: Charlotte, would you take the girls
dialog: outside. The Colonel and I need to have
dialog: a few words.
text: The Farmers wife follows her husbands orders, and gathers her
text: daughter's taking them outside, closing the door behind them.
text: The Two Men are alone, at the farmers dinner table, in the Farmers
dialog: humble home.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Monsieur LaPadite, I regret to inform
dialog: you I've exhausted the extent of my
dialog: French. To continue to speak it so
dialog: inadequately, would only serve to
dialog: embarrass me. However, I've been lead
dialog: to believe you speak English quite well?
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: Oui.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Well, it just so happens, I do as well.
dialog: This being your house, I ask your
dialog: permission to switch to English, for the
dialog: remainder of the conversation?
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: By all means.
dialog: They now speak ENGLISH;
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Monsieur LaPadite, while I'm very
dialog: familiar with you, and your family.
dialog: I have no way of knowing if you are
dialog: familiar with who I am. Are you aware
dialog: of my existence?
dialog: The Farmer answers;
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: This is good. Are you aware of the job
dialog: I've been ordered to carry out in France?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: I
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: Yes.
text: The Colonel drinks more milk.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Please tell me what you've heard?
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: I've heard, the fuhrer has put you in
dialog: charge of rounding up the Jews left in
dialog: France who are ether hiding, or passing
dialog: for Gentile.
text: The S.S.Colonel smiles.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: The Fuhrer couldn't of said it better
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: But the meaning of your visit, pleasant
dialog: though it is, is mysterious to me.
dialog: The Germans looked through my house nine
dialog: months ago for hiding Jews, and found
dialog: nothing.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: I'm aware of that, I read the report on
dialog: this area. But like any enterprise,
dialog: when under new management, there's
text: always a slight duplication of efforts.
dialog: Most of it being a complete waste of time,
dialog: but needs to be done nevertheless.
dialog: I just have A few questions Monsieur
dialog: LaPadite, if you can assist me with
dialog: answers, my department can close the
dialog: file on your family.
text: Taking his black leather attache case, and placing it on the table, he
text: takes out a folder from inside. He also extracts a expensive black
text: fountain pen from his uniform front pocket. Opening the folder, and
dialog: referring to it;
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Now before the occupation there were
dialog: four Jewish families in this area, all
dialog: dairy farmers like yourself.
dialog: The Loveitts, The Doleracs, The Rollins,
dialog: and The Dreyfus's, is that correct?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8,
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: To my knowledge those were the Jewish
dialog: families among the dairy farmers.
dialog: - Heer Colonel, would it disturb you if
dialog: I smoked my pipe?
text: Looking up from his papers.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Please, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your
dialog: house, make yourself comfortable.
text: The Farmer gets up from the table, goes to his shelf over the
text: fireplace, and removes from it a WOODEN BOX that contains all the
text: fixins to his pipe. He sits back down at the table with his Nazi
dialog: guest.
text: As The Farmer loads the bowel of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match
text: to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red hot, the S.S. Colonel
text: studies the papers in front of him.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Now according to these papers, all
dialog: the Jewish families in this area have
dialog: been accounted for - except, The Dreyfusis.
dialog: Somewhere in the last year it would appear
text: they have vanished.
dialog: Which leads me to the conclusion that
dialog: they've ether made good their escape,
dialog: or someone is very successfully hiding
dialog: them.
dialog: (looking up from
dialog: his papers, across
dialog: the table at The
speaker_heading: FARMER)
dialog: What have you heard about The Dreyfusis
dialog: Monsieur LaPadite?
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: Only rumors -
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: - I love rumors! Facts can be so
dialog: misleading, where rumors, true or false
dialog: are often reveling. So Monsieur LaPadite,
dialog: what rumors have you heard regarding
dialog: The Dreyfusis?
text: The Farmerlooks at Landa.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: I.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Speak freely Monsieur LaPadite, I want
dialog: to hear what the rumors are, not who told
dialog: them to you.
text: The Farmer puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: Again, this is just a rumor - but we
dialog: heard the Dreyfusis had made there way
dialog: into Spain.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: So the rumors you've heard have been of
dialog: escape?
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfusis
dialog: friendly?
text: As the Farmer answers this question, the CAMERA LOWERS behind his
text: chair, to the floor, past the floor, to a small area underneath the
text: floorboards revealing;
speaker_heading: FIVE HUMAN BEINGS
text: lying vertically underneath the farmers floorboards. These human
text: beings are The DREYFUSIS, who have lived lying down underneath the
dialog: dairy farmers house for the past year. But one couldn't call what The
dialog: Dreyfusis have done for the last year living. This family has done the
text: only thing they could, hidden from a occupying army that wishes to
dialog: exterminate them.
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: We were families in the same community,
dialog: in the same bussiness. I wouldn't say
dialog: we were friends, but members of the same
dialog: community, we had common interest.
text: The S.S. Colonel takes in this answer, seems to except it, then moves
dialog: to the next question.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Having never met the Dreyfusis, would
dialog: you confirm for me the exact members of
dialog: the household and their names?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: There were five of them.
dialog: The father, Jacob... .wife, Miram...
dialog: her brother, Bob ...
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: - How old is Bob?
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: Thirty - thirty one?
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Continue.
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: And the children... Amos... and Shoshanna.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Ages of the children?
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: Amos - six - I believe. And Shosanna,
dialog: was fifteen or sixteen, I'm not really
dialog: sure.

speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Well I guess that should do it.
text: Be begins gathering up his papers, and putting them back into his
dialog: ttache case.
text: the Farmer, cool as a cucumber, puffs on his pipe.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: However, before I go, could I have another
dialog: glass of your delicious milk?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: But of course.
text: Farmer stands up, goes over to the ice box, and takes out the
text: aft of milk. As he walks over and fills the Nazi Colonel's glass,
dialog: German Officer talks.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the
dialog: nickname the people of France have given
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: I have no interest in such things.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: But you are aware of what they call me?
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: I'm aware.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: What are you aware of?
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: That they call you, "The Jew Hunter".
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Precisely! Now I understand your
text: trepidation in repeating it.
dialog: Before he was assassinated, Heydrich
dialog: apparently hated the moniker the good
dialog: people of Prague bestowed on him.
dialog: Actually why he would hate the name,
dialog: "The Hangman", is baffling to me
dialog: It would appear he did everything in
dialog: his power to earn it. But I, on the
dialog: other hand, love my unofficial title,
dialog: precisely because I've earned it.
text: As "The Jew Hunter" enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize
dialog: with the french farmer.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: The feature that makes me such a effective
dialog: hunter of the Jews, is, as opposed to most
dialog: German soldiers, I can think like a jew.
dialog: where they can only think like a German,
dialog: or more precisely, a German soldier.
dialog: Now if one were to determine what attribute
dialog: the German people share with a beast, it
dialog: would be the cunning and predatory instinct
text: of a hawk.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
speaker_heading: (CON'T)
dialog: Negro's - gorilla's - brain - lips -
dialog: smell - physical strength - penis size.
dialog: But, if one were to determine what attributes
dialog: the jews share with a beast, it would be
dialog: that of the rat.
dialog: Now the Fuhrer and Gobbles propaganda
dialog: have said pretty much the same thing.
dialog: Where our conclusions differ, is I don't
dialog: consider the comparison a insult.
dialog: Consider for a moment, the world a rat
dialog: lives in. It's a hostile world indeed.
dialog: If a rat were to scamper through your
dialog: front door right now, would you greet it
dialog: with hostility?
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: I suppose I would.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Has a rat ever done anything to you to
dialog: create this animosity you feel toward
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: Rat's spread disease, they bite people -
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: - Unless some fool is stupid enough to
dialog: try and handle a live one, rats don't
text: make it a practise of biting human beings.
dialog: Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague,
dialog: but that was some time ago. In all your
dialog: born days, has a rat ever caused you to
dialog: be sick a day in your life? I purpose to
dialog: you, any disease a rat could spread,
dialog: a squirrel could equally carry.
dialog: Yet I assume you don't share the same
dialog: animosity with squirrels that you do with
dialog: rats, do you?
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Yet, they are both rodent's, are they
dialog: not? And except for the fact that one
text: has a big bushy tail, while the other
text: has a long repugnt tail of rodent skin,
dialog: they even rather look alike, don't they?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.6
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: It is a interesting thought,
dialog: beer Colonel.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: However, interesting as the thought may
dialog: be, it makes not one bit of difference
dialog: to how you feel. If a rat were to scamper
dialog: through your door, this very minute,
dialog: would you offer it a saucer of your
dialog: delicious milk?
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: Probably not.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: I didn't think so. You don't like them.
dialog: You don't really know why you don't like
dialog: them. All you know is, you find them
dialog: repulsive.
dialog: (let's the
speaker_heading: METAPHOR
dialog: sink in)
dialog: What a tremendously hostile world a rat
dialog: must endure. Yet, not only does he
dialog: survive, he thrives. And the reason for
dialog: this, is because our little foe has a
dialog: instinct for survival and presavation
dialog: second to none. And that Monsieur, is
dialog: what a jew shares with a rat.
dialog: Consequently, a German soldier, conducts
text: a search of a house suspected of hiding
text: jews. Where does the hawk look? He looks
text: in the barn, he looks in the attic,
text: he looks in the cellar - he looks
dialog: everywhere, he would hide. But there are
dialog: many places it would never occur to a
dialog: hawk to hide. However the reason the
dialog: Fuhrer brought me off my Alps in Austria,
dialog: and placed me in French cow country today,
dialog: is because it does occur to me. Because
dialog: I'm aware what tremendous feats human
dialog: beings are capable of once they abandon
dialog: dignity.
dialog: (Changing tone)
dialog: May I smoke my pipe as well?
text: Th e Farmer's cool facade is little by little eroding.

speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: The other mistake the German soldier
dialog: make is their severe handling of the
dialog: citizens who give shelter and aid to
dialog: the Jews. These citizens are not enemies
dialog: of the state. They are simply confused
dialog: people, trying to make some sense out of
dialog: the madness war creates.
dialog: These citizens do not need punishing.
dialog: They simply need to be reminded of their
dialog: duty in war time.
dialog: Let's use you as a example Monsieur
dialog: LaPadite. In this war, you have found
dialog: yourself in the middle of a conflict
dialog: that has nothing to do with yourself,
dialog: your lovely ladies, or your cows - yet,
dialog: here you are.
dialog: So Monsieur LaPadite, let me purpose
dialog: a question. In this time of war, what is
dialog: your number one duty? Is it to fight the
dialog: Germans in the name of France to your
dialog: last breath? Or, is it to harass the
dialog: occupying army to the best of your
dialog: ability? Or, is it to protect the poor
dialog: unfortunate victims of warfare who can
dialog: not protect themselfs?
dialog: Or, is your number one duty in this time
dialog: of bloodshed, to protect those very
dialog: beautiful women who constitute your
dialog: family?
text: The Colonel lets the last statement stand.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: That was a question Monsieur LaPadite.
dialog: In this time of war, What do you consider
dialog: your number one duty?
speaker_heading: PERRIER
dialog: To protect my family.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Now, my job dictates, that I must have
dialog: my men enter your home, and conduct a
dialog: thorough search, before I can officially
dialog: cross your families name off my list.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
speaker_heading: (CON'T)
dialog: And if there are any irregularities to be
dialog: found, rest assured, they will be.
dialog: That is unless, you have something to tell
dialog: me that will make the conducting of a
dialog: search unnecessary.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: I might add also, that any information
dialog: that makes the preforming of My duty
dialog: easier, will not be met with punishment.
dialog: Actually quite the contrary, it will be
dialog: met with reward.
dialog: And that reward will be, your family
dialog: will cease to be harassed in anyway,
dialog: by the German military during the rest
dialog: of our occupation of your country.
text: The Farmer, pipe in mouth, stares across the table at his German

speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Oui, Madame.
speaker_heading: MADAME MIMIEUX
dialog: And for bringing a open flame in my

dialog: a Nazi jewish boxcar. With your thick
dialog: head, what do you think the highest
dialog: priority of a cinema manager is?
dialog: Keeping this fucking place from burning
dialog: down to the ground, that's what!
dialog: In my collection, I have over 350,
text: 35mm, nitrate film prints, which are
text: not only immensely flammable, but
dialog: highly unstable. And should they
dialog: catch fire, they burn three times
dialog: faster then paper. If that happens..
dialog: .POOF...all gone, cinema no more,

dialog: see you with a open flame in my cinema

speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Your welcome. - regardless, I want

speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: I apologize mademoiselle, I wasn't

speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: I don't wish to be your friend.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Don't act like a infant. You know why.
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: I'm more then just a uniform.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Not to me. If you are so desperate for
dialog: a French girlfriend, I suggest you try
dialog: Vichy?
text: Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN SOLDIERS come over, obviously
text: very impressed with Fredrick. They make a fuss over him in
dialog: UNSUBTITLED GERMAN, which nether Shosanna, or the non German
text: speaking members of the movies audience, can understand.
text: He signs autographs for them, shakes their hands, and they
dialog: go on their way.
text: Shosanna's eyes narrow.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: I thought I was just a uniform?
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA

dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: No not really, I'm just teasing you.
text: She leans back annoyed.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 6'O
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: Not exactly.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: (Pfuit), what does that mean, "not exactly".
dialog: I asked if you were a movie star, the
dialog: answer to that question, is yes or no.
text: Fredrick laughs at that line.
speaker_heading: FREDRICR
dialog: When you said that just now, you
dialog: reminded me of my sister.
text: This catches young Shosanna off guard.
speaker_heading: FREDRICR
dialog: I come from a home of six sisters.
dialog: We run a family operated cinema in Munich.
dialog: Seeing you run around your cinema,
dialog: reminds me of them. Especially my sister
dialog: Helga. She raised me, when our father
dialog: wasn't up to the job. I admire her very
dialog: much. You'd like her, she doesn't wear a
dialog: German uniform.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: You were raised by Helga?
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: All my sisters, I'm the baby, but Helga
dialog: was the bossiest.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: And your mother and father?
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: My mother died. And my father was a
dialog: loser. My fathers moto; "If at first
dialog: you don't succeed, quit". The day he
dialog: left, good riddance. My sisters are
dialog: all I need. It's why I like your cinema.
dialog: It makes me feel both closer to them,
text: and a little homesick at the same time.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: is your cinema still operatiing?
speaker_heading: FREDRICR
dialog: Oui.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: What's it called?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5!
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: The Kino Haus.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: How has it done durring the war?
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: Actually, in Germany, cinema
dialog: attendance is up.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: No doubt, you don't have to operate
text: under a curfew.
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: How often do you fill your house?
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: (Pfuit), not since before the war.
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: So if you had one big engagement, that
dialog: would help you out?
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Of course, but that's not likely to
dialog: happen.
scene_heading: TWO MORE GERMAN SOLDIERS and their TWO FRENCH DATES approach
text: the table. They ask for Fredricks autograph, he signs it for
text: them. One of the French Girls says in FRENCH, how exciting
text: it is to meet a real live German war hero. Shosanna hears
text: it. They leave. So that's it, she thinks.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: So your a war hero? Why didn't you tell me?
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: Everybody knows that, I liked you didn't.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: What did you do?
text: He takes a sip of beer.
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: I've shot the most enemy soldiers
dialog: in world war two...so far.
dialog: You bet your sweet ass that got her attention.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Wow.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 52
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: I was alone in a bell tower in a
dialog: walled off city in Russia. It was
dialog: myself, and a thousand rounds of ammo,
text: in a bird's nest, against three
dialog: hundred Soviet soldiers.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: What's a bird's nest?
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: A bird's nest is what a sniper would call
text: a bell tower. It's a high structure,
dialog: offering a three hundred and sixty degree
dialog: view. Very advantageous for marksmen.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: How many Russian's did you kill?
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: Sixty-eight.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
text: The first day. A hundred and fifty the
text: second day. Thirty-two, the third day.
dialog: On the forth day, they exited the city.
dialog: Naturally my war story received alot of
dialog: attention in Germany, that's why they
dialog: all recognize me. They call me the
dialog: German Sgt.York.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Maybe they'll make a film about
dialog: your exploits.
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels
dialog: thought. So he did. It's called "Nation's
dialog: Pride", and guess what, they wanted me to
dialog: play myself, so I did. They have posters
dialog: for it in kiosks all over Paris. That's
dialog: another reason for all the attention.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: "Nation's Pride" is about you? "Nation's
dialog: Pride" is starring you?
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: I know, comical, huh?
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Not so comical. So what are you doing
dialog: in Paris, enjoying a rest?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: Hardly. I've been doing publicity,
dialog: having my picture taken with different
dialog: German luminaries, visiting troops,
dialog: that sort of thing. Goebbels wants the
dialog: film to premier in Paris, so I've been
dialog: helping them in the planning.
dialog: Joseph is very keen on this film.
dialog: He's telling anybody who will listen,
dialog: when "Nation's Pride" is released,
dialog: I'll be the German Van Johnson.
dialog: Shosanna, wasn't falling for the young German, by any stretch.
dialog: However his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can't
text: help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as "Joseph",
dialog: like their friends, is all she needed to get on the right side
text: of things. This young man is trouble with a capital "T", and
dialog: she needs to stay far fucking away from him.
text: She abruptly rises, and says;
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Well, good luck with your premier
dialog: Private. I hope all goes well for
dialog: Joseph and yourself. Au revoir.
text: And with that, she disappears. Leaving the perplexed private
dialog: alone.
scene_heading: EXT - CINEMA MARQUEE - DAY
text: It's the next day.
text: Shosanna and Marcel are changing the letters on the marquee.
text: Marcel excuses himself to visit the toilet.

text: WHEN...

text: A GERMAN MAJOR in a black Gestapo uniform steps out of the back
dialog: of the sedan.
text: The DRIVER, a German Private, steps out as well.
text: Yelling to the young girl up high on the ladder;
text: Both GERMAN and FRENCH will be SUBTITLED into ENGLISH.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5 q.
speaker_heading: GESTAPO MAJOR

speaker_heading: SHOSANNA

speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
speaker_heading: GESTAPO MAJOR

speaker_heading: DRIVER

speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: I don't understand, what have I done?
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: (to Major)
dialog: She wants to know what she's done?
speaker_heading: GESTAPO MAJOR
dialog: Who says she's done anything?
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Who says you've done anything?
text: Then in her best imitation of Madame Mimeux's arrogantmanner.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Then I demand to know what this is about,
dialog: and where do you propose to take me?
text: The Driver begins to translate, when the Gestapo Major holds up his
text: hand, telling him not to bother. The Major looks at the young
text: French girl and tells her in German;
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: GESTAPO MAJOR
dialog: Get your ass in that car.
text: No translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car,
text: followed by the Germans. The sedan takes off.
scene_heading: INT - SEDAN(MOVING) - DAY
text: The Nazi sedan drives through the early afternoon Paris
dialog: streets.
text: WE HOLD SHOSANNA IN TIGHT CU
text: the whole ride, never showing her Nazi oppressor sitting beside

text: The sedan stops.
text: The car door opens and the Driver offers Shosanna his hand.
scene_heading: EXT/INT- MAXIUM'S (FAMOUS PARIS CAFE) - DAY
text: She steps out of the car, and is lead into a Paris cafe by the
text: Gestapo Officer. It takes the young Jewess a moment or two before
text: she realizes she's not being led to a Gestapo interrogation
text: room, a railroad car, or a concentration camp, but to lunch.
text: The best table at Maxims. Three people, and two dogs, sit at it.
dialog: Germany's Minister of Propaganda, and the number two man in

text: The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the propaganda

speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to

speaker_heading: MAJOR HELLSTROM
dialog: Try the wine mademoiselle, it's quite good.
text: Goebbels looks across the table at her.
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: well I must say, you've made quite a
dialog: impression on our boy.
text: Francesca interprets Goebbels German for Shosanna.
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: I must say fraulein, I should be rather
dialog: annoyed with you.
dialog: Francesca interprets..
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: I arrive in France, and I wish to have
dialog: lunch with my star...
dialog: Francesca interprets...
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: Little do I know Be's become
dialog: the toast of paris, and now he
dialog: must find time for me.
dialog: Francesca interprets...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: c9 Ã¢â¬Â¢
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: People wait in line hours, day's,
dialog: to see me. For the Fuhrer and
dialog: Private Zoller, I wait.
dialog: Francesca interprets...
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: So finally, I'm granted a audience
dialog: with the young Private, and he spends
dialog: the entire lunch speaking of you
dialog: and your cinema.
dialog: Francesca interprets...
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: So Fraulein Mimieux, let's get down
dialog: to business.
dialog: Private Zoller interrupts -
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: - Heer Goebbels, I haven't informed
dialog: her yet.
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: Unless the girls a simpleton, I'm
dialog: sure she's figured it out by now,
dialog: after all she does operate a cinema.
dialog: Francesca, tell her.
dialog: Francesca tells Shosanna in French;
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: What they're trying to tell you
dialog: Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has
dialog: spent the last hour at lunch,
dialog: trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels
dialog: to abandon previous plans for Private
dialog: Zollers film premier, and change the
dialog: venue to your cinema.
text: Zoller reacts.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
speaker_heading: (FRENCH
dialog: to Zoller)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: I wanted to inform her.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: Shit. I apologize Private, of
dialog: course you did.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
speaker_heading: (GERMAN
dialog: to Francesca)
dialog: What's the issue?
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: The Private wanted to inform the
dialog: mademoiselle himself.
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: Nonsense. Until I ask a few
dialog: questions, he has nothing to inform.
dialog: Let the record state, I have not
dialog: agreed to a venue change.
speaker_heading: MAJOR HELLSTROM
dialog: Duly noted.
dialog: Goebbels speaks German to Shosanna;
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: You have opera boxes?
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: More would be better. How many
dialog: seats in your auditorium?
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
text: Three hundred and fifty.
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: That's almost four hundred less
dialog: then The Ritz.
text: Fredrick jumps in...
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: But beer Goebbels, that's not such
dialog: a terrible thing. You said yourself
dialog: you didn't want to indulge every
text: two faced french bourgeois taking
text: up space currying favor. With less
dialog: seat's it makes the event more
dialog: exclusive. Your not trying to fill
dialog: the house, their fightin g for seats.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
speaker_heading: (CON'T)
dialog: Besides, to hell with the French.
dialog: This is a German night, a German
dialog: event, a German celebration. This
dialog: night is for you, me, the German
dialog: military, the high command, their
dialog: family and friends. The only people
dialog: who should be allowed in the room,
dialog: are people who will be moved by
text: the exploits on screen.
text: Goebbels listens silently, then after a bit of a pause;
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: I see your public speaking has
dialog: improved. It appears I've created
text: a monster. A strangely persuasive
dialog: monster. When the war's over,
text: politics awaits.
text: Table chuckles.
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: Well Private, though it is true,
dialog: I'm inclined to indulge you anything.
dialog: I must watch a film in this young
dialog: ladies cinema before I can say,
dialog: yes or no.
dialog: (to Shosanna)
dialog: So young lady, you are to close
dialog: your cinema tonight, and have
dialog: a private screening me.
dialog: Francesca interprets...
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: What German films do you have?
dialog: Francesca asks..
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: My cinema , on German night, tends
dialog: to show older German classics.
dialog: Francesca interprets...
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: Why not my films?
dialog: Francesca asks...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6Z.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: I draw a older German audience in
dialog: my cinema, that appreciate the
dialog: nostalgia of the earlier time.
dialog: Francesca interprets...
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: That's nonsense fraulein. Us Germans
dialog: are looking forward, not backwards.
dialog: That era of German cinema is dead.
dialog: The German cinema I create, will not
dialog: only be thee cinema of Europe. But
dialog: the worlds only alternative to the
dialog: degenerate Jewish influence of
dialog: Hollywood.
text: Fredrick Jumps in...
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: Along with being a cinema owner,
dialog: Emmanuelle is quite a formidable
dialog: film critic.
text: He chuckles, but alone.
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: WSo it would appear. Unfortunately
dialog: for the fraulein, I've outlawed
dialog: film criticism.
text: Zoller, thinking fast, says;
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: Why don't you screen "Lucky Kids"?
dialog: I'm sure Emmanuelle hasn't seen. it.
dialog: And it's so funny, I've been meaning
dialog: to recommend it to her, for her
dialog: German night. That's a great idea,
dialog: let's watch "Lucky Kids" tonight.
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: Ahhh, "Lucky Kids", "Lucky Kids",
dialog: "Lucky Kids". When all is said and
dialog: done, my most purely enjoyable
dialog: production. Not only that, I
dialog: wouldn't be surprised, if sixty
dialog: years from now, It's "Lucky Kids"
dialog: that I'm the most remembered for.
dialog: I know it doesn't seem like it now,
dialog: but mark my words.
dialog: Very well, I'll have a print sent
text: over to the fraulein'.s cinema.
dialog: We'll screen "Lucky Kids" tonight.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 63
text: As Francesca interprets this for Shosanna...
text: ...the empty chair next to the young Jewish girl is suddenly
text: filled with the bottom half of a grey S.S. officer uniform.
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: Ah Landa, your here, this is the
text: young lady in question.
text: The S.S. Officer sits down, and it's our old friend from the
text: first scene COL HANS LANDA.
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: Shosanna, this4pol Hans Landa of
dialog: the SS., he'll be running security
dialog: for the premier.
speaker_heading: CU SHOSANNA
text: A bomb is dropped and detonated behind her eyes. But if she
text: gives any indication of this, her war story ends here.
speaker_heading: The S.S. OFFICER
text: that murdered her family, takes her hand and kisses it,
dialog: saying in perfect French;
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Charmed Mademoiselle.
speaker_heading: MAJOR HELLSTROM
dialog: Better known as "The Jew Hunter".
text: The table laughs.
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: Oh Francesca, what was that funny
dialog: thing the Fuhrer said about Hans?
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: What thing?
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: You know, you were there, it was a
dialog: funny thing the Fuhrer said,
dialog: about Hans...Something about a pig?
text: Francesca's memory is jogged.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: Oh, yes of course.
text: She repeats it by whispering it in Goebbels ear.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6 "F
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: Oh, yes of course, that's it. So
dialog: the Fuhrer said, he wouldn't be
dialog: surprised if Hans weren't rooting
dialog: out Jews like a truffle pig from
text: the play pen.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: That's what we need, pigs that can
dialog: root out Jews.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Who needs pigs when you have me?
text: Big hearty laugh around the table.
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: Do you have a engagement tonight?
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Well, as a matter of fact, I do -
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: - Break it. We're all going to the
dialog: Fraulein's cinema tonight to view
dialog: "Lucky Kids".
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Splendid.
dialog: Then Reich Ministers companion mademoiselle Mondino,
speaker_heading: INTERRUPTS;
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: And now I must get Reich Minister Goebbels
dialog: to his next appointment.
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: Slave driver! French slave driver!
text: They all chuckle.
text: Everybody begins to stand up from the table...
dialog: ..Francesca gathers the stupid dogs...
dialog: .as Col Landa stands, he says;
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Actually, in my role as security
dialog: chief of this joyous German occasion,
dialog: I'm afraid I must have a word with
dialog: Mademoiselle Mimieux.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: C. 5.
text: Mademoiselle Mimieux eyes go to Private Zoller, who responds.
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: What sort of discussion?
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: That sounded suspiciously like a
dialog: Private questioning the order of a
dialog: Colonel? Or am I just being sensitive?
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: Nothing could be further from the
dialog: truth Colonel. Your authority is
dialog: beyond question.
dialog: But your reputation does proceed
dialog: you. Should Mademoiselle Mimieux
dialog: or myself be concerned?
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: Hans, the boy means no harm, he's
text: simply smitten. And he's correct.
dialog: Your reputation does proceed you.
text: Laughter all around. The Reich Minister and his axis entourage,
text: make their way to front of the cafe, with the two dumb dogs on
text: a leash, leading the way.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: No need for concern, you two.
dialog: As security chief, I simply need
dialog: to have a chat with the possible
dialog: new venue's property owner.
speaker_heading: FREDRICK
dialog: I was just hoping to escort
dialog: Mademoiselle Mimieux back to her
dialog: cinema.
speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: Nonsense! You can eat ice cream,
dialog: and walk along the Sienne another
dialog: time. Right now, allow Col Landa
dialog: to do his job.
text: Everybody saystheir farewells.
text: Col Landa offers the young jew in hiding a seat at a small
text: table in the outside patio area of Maxims.
dialog: The fluency and poetic proficiency of the S.S. jew hunters
text: french, revels to the audience, that his feigning clumsiness at
text: french with Monsieur Lapadite in the films first scene, was
dialog: simply a interrogation-technique.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: bd.
text: They speak FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Have you tried the strudel here?
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: It's not so terrible. So how is it
dialog: the young Private and yourself came
dialog: to be acquainted?
text: She's about to answer, when a WAITER approaches.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Yes, two strudels, one for myself,
dialog: and one for the mademoiselle. A cup
text: of espresso, with a container of.
text: steamed milk, on the side.
dialog: For the Mademoiselle, a glass of milk.
dialog: Considering Shosanna. grew up on a dairy farm, and the last time
text: she was on a dairy farm, her strudel companion murdered her
dialog: entire family, his ordering her milk is, to say the
dialog: least... . disconcerting.
dialog: The key to Col Landa's power, and or charm, depending on the
dialog: side ones on, lies in his ability to convince you he's privy to
dialog: your secrets.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: So Mademoiselle, you were beginning
dialog: to explain....?
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
speaker_heading: (ANXIOUSLY)
dialog: Up untill a couple of days ago,
dialog: I had no knowledge of Private Zoller,
dialog: or his exploits. To me, the Private
dialog: was simply just a patron of my cinema.
dialog: We spoke a few times, but -
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: - Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.
dialog: This is a simple formality, no
dialog: reason for you to feel anxious.
text: The Colonel takes one look at it, and says to the Waiter;
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 67
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: I apologize, I forgot to order the
dialog: cream fresh.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: One moment.
text: He exits.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: (Refuring to
dialog: the apple pie)
dialog: Wait for the cream.
dialog: (Back to
speaker_heading: BUSINESS)
dialog: So Emmanuelle - May I call you
dialog: Emmanuelle?
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Oui.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: So Emmanuelle, explain to me how
dialog: does it happen, that a young lady
dialog: such as your self, comes to own a
dialog: cinema?
text: The Waiter returns, applying cream fresh to the two strudels.
text: The S.S. Colonel looks across the table at his companion, picking
dialog: up his fork, he says;

speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: The cinema originally belonged to

speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: - What is there names?
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
text: He records the names in his little book.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Where are they now?
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: My uncle was killed during blitzkrieg.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA

speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Aunt Ada passed away from fever

speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Regrettable.
speaker_heading: (RESPECTFUL
speaker_heading: PAUSE)
dialog: It's come to my attention you have
dialog: a negro in your employ, is that true?
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Yes, he's a Frenchman. His name is
dialog: Marcel. He worked with my aunt and
dialog: uncle since they opened the cinema.
dialog: He's the only other one who works
dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Doing what?
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Projectionist.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Is he any good?
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: The best.

speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Actually one could see where that
dialog: might be a good trade for them.
dialog: Can you operate the projectors?
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Of course I can.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Knowing the Reich Minister as I do,
dialog: I'm quite positive he wouldn't want
dialog: the success or failure of his
dialog: illustrious evening, dependent on
dialog: the prowess of a negro. So if it
dialog: comes to pass we hold this event
dialog: at your venue, talented no doubt,
dialog: as your negro may be, you will
dialog: operate the projectors. Is that
dialog: exceptable?
text: As if she has any say.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Oui.
text: Col Landa takes another bite of strudel, Shosanna follows suit.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: So it would appear our young hero is

speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Private Zollers feelings for me
dialog: aren't of a romantic nature.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Mademoiselle...?
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Colonel, his feelings are not
dialog: romantic. I remind him of his sister.
speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: That doesn't mean his feelings

speaker_heading: SHOSANNA

speaker_heading: COL LANDA

speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: I did have some thing else I wanted
dialog: to ask you, but right now, for the
dialog: life of me, I can't remember what it

speaker_heading: COL LANDA
dialog: Till tonight.

speaker_heading: GOEBBELS
dialog: I must say, I appreciate the modesty

dialog: Not to say we couldn't spruce the

text: there's a crystal chandelier hanging
text: in the banquet hall that is
dialog: extraordinary. we're going to get it,
dialog: and hang it from the very middle of

speaker_heading: MONTAGE

text: The lobby of Shosanna's cinema, pimped out in Nazi iconography.
text: WORKERS buzz around decorating. The Greek statues are moved
dialog: into place.
text: We see Workers trying with incredible difficulty, to hoist the
text: huge, heavy, and twinkingly fragile chandelier, in Shosannas
text: auditorium, which now resembles something out of one of Tinto

speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: Well, I need to speak with you

speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: What about it?
text: She slowly walks up the stairs to Marcel. She makes him part

speaker_heading: MARCEL

dialog: about?
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
text: Filling the cinema with Nazi's and

text: to the ground.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: I'm not talking about that, your
dialog: talking about that.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: No, we're talking about that,
dialog: right now. If we can keep this
dialog: place from burning down by
dialog: ourselves, we can burn it down
dialog: by ourselves.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: Shosanna -
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: No, Marcel, just for sake of argument,
dialog: if we wanted to burn down the cinema,
dialog: for any number of reasons, you and I
dialog: could physically accomplish that, no?
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: Oui Shosanna, we could do that.
speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
dialog: And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate
dialog: film print collection, we wouldn't
dialog: even need explosives, would we?
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: You mean we wouldn't need any more

speaker_heading: SHOSANNA

speaker_heading: (CON'T)
dialog: And if I'm going to burn down the

text: The back of her head presses up hard against him, as his hand

speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
speaker_heading: (CON'T)

speaker_heading: SHOSANNA
speaker_heading: (CON'T)

dialog: Does the filmmaking equipment it the

dialog: recorder?
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: Quite well, actually. I recorded a
dialog: new guitarist I met in a cafe last

speaker_heading: MILITARY ATTACHE
dialog: Right this way, Lieutenant.
text: A snappy handsome British Lieutenant in dress browns, steps inside
text: the room. This officer, who has been mixing it up with
text: the Gerrys since the late thirties, is named LT.ARCHIE HICOX.
text: A young George Sanders type(The Saint and Private affairs of
dialog: Bel Ami, years).
text: Upon entering the room, Lt.Hicox is gobsmacked.
text: Standing before him is legendary military mastermind,
text: GENERAL ED FENECH, a older George Sanders type (Village of the
dialog: Dammed).
text: But in the back of the room, sitting behind a piano,
text: smoking his ever present cigar, is the unmistakable

speaker_heading: LT. HICOX
dialog: Lt. Archie Hicox, reporting sir.
speaker_heading: GEN FENECH

dialog: General Ed Fenech, at ease Hicox.
dialog: Drink?
text: Hicox's eye's go to the formidable bulldog behind the piano,

dialog: Which Lt.Hicox knows enough to mean, if Churchell isn't

speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: Something for yourself, sir?
speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: Whiskey straight. No junk in it.
text: The Lieutenant moves over to the Columbus-style globe bar, and

text: Fenech, eyeing the Lieutenant's file.
speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: It says here you've run three

dialog: Extraordinary people, the Norwegian's.
speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH

speaker_heading: LT.HICOX

speaker_heading: LT. H I COX
dialog: I'm a film critic.
speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: List your accomplishments?
speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: Well sir, such as they are, I write
dialog: reviews and articles, for a publication
dialog: called; "Films and Filmmakers".
dialog: As well as our sister publication.

speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: What's that called?
speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: "Flickers Bi-Monthly". And I've had
dialog: two books published.
speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: Impressive. Don't be modest Lieutenant,
dialog: what are their titles?
speaker_heading: LT. HI COX
dialog: The first book was called; "Art Of The
dialog: Eye's, The Heart, and The Mind:A Study
dialog: of German Cinema in the Twenties".
dialog: And the second one was called; ...

speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: "Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci".
dialog: It's a subtexual film criticism
dialog: study of the work of German director

speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: (Thinking, for

dialog: Down with Hitler.
speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: All the way down, sir.
speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: Are you familiar with German cinema
dialog: under the Third Reich?
speaker_heading: LT. HI COX
dialog: Yes. Obviously I haven't seen any of

speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: Explain it to me.?

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 77
speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: Pardon sir?
speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: This little escapade of ours,
dialog: requires a knowledge of the German
dialog: film industry under the Third Reich.
dialog: Explain to me UFA, under Goebbels?
speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: Goebbels considers the films he's
dialog: making to be the beginning of a new
dialog: era in German cinema. A alternative
dialog: to what he considers the Jewish
dialog: German intellectual cinema of the
dialog: twenties. And the Jewish controlled
dialog: dogma of Hollywood.
text: SUDDENLY... Bellowing from the back of the room;
speaker_heading: CHURCHELL
dialog: How's he doing?
speaker_heading: LT. H I COX
dialog: Frightfully sorry sir, once again?
speaker_heading: CHURCHELL
dialog: You say he wants to take on the Jews
dialog: at their own game? Compared to say
dialog: .Louis B.Mayer...how's he doing?
speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: Quite well, actually. Since Goebbels
dialog: has taken over, film attendance has
text: steadily risen in Germany over the
dialog: last eight years. But Louis B.Mayer
dialog: wouldn't be Goebbels proper opposite
dialog: number. I believe Goebbels see's himself
text: closer to David O.Selznick.
text: Gen.Fenech looks to the Prime Minister.
text: With a puff of cigar smoke, Churchell says;
speaker_heading: CHURCHELL
dialog: Brief him.
speaker_heading: GEM.FENECH
dialog: Lt.Bicox, at this point in time I'd
dialog: like to brief you on, Operation Kino.
text: Three days from now, Joseph Goebbels is

speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: - What film sir?
text: The General has to resort to peeking at his file.
speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: The motion pictures called; "Nation's
dialog: Pride".
speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: Oh, you mean the film about Private
dialog: Zoller?
speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: We don't have any intelligence, on
dialog: exactly, what the film that night
dialog: will be about.
speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: But it's called "Nation's Pride"?
speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: I can tell you what it's about,
dialog: it's about Private Fredrick Zoller.
dialog: He's the German Sgt.York.
text: Fenech can't help suppress a smile, they have the right man.
speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: In attendance at this joyous Germatic
dialog: occasion, will be Goebbels, Gerring,
dialog: Boorman, and most of the German High
dialog: command, including all high ranking
dialog: officers of both The S.S., and, The
dialog: Gestapo. As well as luminaries of the
dialog: Nazi propaganda film industry.
speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: The master race at play, aye?
speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: Basically, we have all our rotten
text: eggs in one basket. The objective of
dialog: Operation Kino.... Blow up the basket.
speaker_heading: LT.HICOX

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: An American Secret Service outfit,
dialog: that lives deep behind enemy lines,
dialog: will be your assist. The Germans call
dialog: them; "The Basterds".
speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: "The Basterds", never heard of them.
speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: Whole point of the secret service,
dialog: old boy, you not hearing of them.
dialog: But the Gerrys have heard of them,
dialog: because these yanks have been them
text: the devil. Their leader is a chap
dialog: named Lt.Aldo Raine. The Germans
dialog: call him, "Aldo the Apache".
speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: Why do they call him that?
speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: Best guess, is because he removes the
text: scalps of the Nazi dead.
speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: Scalps, sir?
speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: The hair.
text: He runs his finger along his hairline.
speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
text: Like a red Injun.
speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: Rather gruesome sounding little
dialog: Dicky bird, isn't he?
speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: No doubt the whole lot, a bunch a
dialog: nutters. But you've heard the
dialog: expression, "It takes a thief".
speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: Indeed.

speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: You'll be dropped into France, about
text: twenty four kilometers outside of Paris.
dialog: The Basterds will be waiting for you.
dialog: First thing, you go to a little village
dialog: called, "Nadine".
dialog: (He points it
dialog: out on the map)
dialog: Apparently the Gerrys never go there.
dialog: In Nadine, there's a tavern, called,
dialog: "La Louisiane", you'll rendez-vous
dialog: with our double agent, and she'll take
dialog: it from there. She's the one who's
dialog: going to get you in the premiere.
dialog: It will be you, her, and two German
dialog: born members of the Basterds. She's
dialog: also made all the other arrangements
dialog: your going to need.
speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: How will I know her?
speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: I suspect that won't be too much
dialog: trouble for you. Your contact is
dialog: Bridget Von Hammersmark.
speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: Bridget Von Hammersmark? The German
dialog: movie star is working for England?
speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: For the last two years now. one could
dialog: even say Operation Kino was her
dialog: brainchild.
text: In the back of the room the bulldog barks;
speaker_heading: CHURCHELL
dialog: Extraordinary women.
speaker_heading: LT.BICOX
dialog: Quite.
speaker_heading: GEN.FENECH
dialog: You'll go to the premiere as her
dialog: escort, lucky devil. She'll also
dialog: have the premiere tickets for the
dialog: other two. Got the gist?

speaker_heading: LT.ALDO
dialog: So y'all git in trouble in there,

speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: If we get into trouble, we can

speaker_heading: FIVE NAZI'S
scene_heading: ONE GERMAN MASTER SGT, ONE FEMALE GERMAN SGT (a powerfully built

text: the hour, UFA diva, BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK. Dressed to the
text: nines in a chic Forties style women's suit, complete with
text: fedora. The game their playing consists of each player having
text: a card with the name of a famous person, real or imaginary,
text: stuck to their forehead. The player doesn't know what name is
text: on their forehead. So they ask the others questions to figure
dialog: out who they are.
scene_heading: The Five Germans, five cards read; MASTER SGT #1(POLA NEGRI),
scene_heading: FEMALE SGT #2(BEETHOVEN), GERMAN PRIVATE #3(MATA HARI),
scene_heading: GERMAN PRIVATE #4 (EDGAR WALLACE), GERMAN PRIVATE #5

text: It's German#5 (WINNETOU) turn to ask questions.
text: The DIALOGUE will be in GERMAN, and SUBTITLED into ENGLISH.
dialog: Also, while some dialogue will be written for the German
dialog: Soldiers, it will be mostly made up from the exuberance
text: of their game playing, and celebrating.
speaker_heading: WINNETOU
dialog: .okay, I'm not German. Am I American?
text: The whole table bursts out laughing.
speaker_heading: FEMALE SGT/BEETHOVEN

speaker_heading: EDGAR WALLACE
dialog: Well if he's so American, how come
dialog: he's never been translated into
dialog: English? He's not American. He's
dialog: suppose to be American, but he's not
dialog: a American creation. In fact, he's
dialog: something very different.
speaker_heading: WINNETOU
dialog: Okay, I'm a fictional, literary
dialog: character, from the past, I'm American,
dialog: and that's controversial.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET/GENGUS
dialog: No it's not controversial. The nationally
dialog: of the author, has nothing to do with
dialog: the nationally of the character.
dialog: The Character is the character.
dialog: Hamlet's not British, he's Danish.
dialog: So yes, this character was born in
dialog: America.
speaker_heading: WINNETOU
dialog: Well I'm glad that's settled. If I had

speaker_heading: MATA HARI
dialog: Frau Von Hammersmark, when your

speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Really? No, I wasn't aware of that
dialog: at all.
speaker_heading: MATA HARI
dialog: They must be second nature to you now?
dialog: Did they teach you how to do a double
dialog: take in the movies?
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Well, yes they did, but it's not really
dialog: that difficult.
scene_heading: SGT.POLA NEGRI
dialog: Do one for us.
text: The Tableheartily agrees.
text: Bridget looks directly at the Master Sgt, and does a perfect,
dialog: and perfectly funny, Double Take.
dialog: The Table loves it.

speaker_heading: MATA HARI
dialog: My turn, I want to try.

speaker_heading: EDGER WALLACE
dialog: I want to try.
dialog: He does.
text: Soon the whole Table is doing dueling Double Takes.
scene_heading: HICOX - WICKI - STIGLITZ
text: watch the table do dueling Double Takes. Obviously, they don't
dialog: understand.
dialog: THEN...
text: .Bridget Von Hammersmark rises, and excuses herself from the
text: Table. She removes the card stuck in her fedora, looking at
text: the name Gengus Khaun for the first time.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Gengus Khaun! I would never of gotten that.
text: She walks over, and joins the masquerading Germans table, the
text: Gentlemen rise. She greets each warmly with a french cheek
text: kiss, as if she knows them well.
text: They all take a seat. The two Basterds, and one Brit, drink
text: Whiskey. The taverns PROPRIETOR, a older, big bellyed
text: Frenchman named EARL, comes over to the table, and pours more
text: champagne into Bridget's Champagne glass. He leaves, returning
text: back behind the bar, with the YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID, the only other
dialog: person in the establishment.
text: Obviously, they speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;
speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: I thought this place was suppose to
dialog: have more French then Germans?
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Normally that's true. The Sgt over
dialog: there's wife, just had a baby. His
dialog: commanding officer gave him, and his
text: mates the night off to celebrate.
speaker_heading: WICXI
dialog: We should leave.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: F No, we should stay. For one drink at
dialog: least. I've been waiting for you in a
dialog: bar, it would look strange if we left
dialog: before we had a drink.
speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: She's right, just be calm, and enjoy
dialog: your booze.
text: BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLE
text: The French Barmaid, has taken Bridget's place in the rousing,
text: rowdy game. She tells them, her person must be French, or she
text: won't know them. Winnetou thinks for a moment, then writes a
text: name on a card. The Barmaid puts it on her forehead, It says;
speaker_heading: NAPOLEON.
text: The Germans all laugh.
text: BACK TO THE BASTERDS TABLE
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: There's been some new developments.
text: The cinema venue has changed.
speaker_heading: LT.HICOX
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: No one knows. But that in itself
dialog: shouldn't be a problem. The cinema
dialog: it's been changed to is considerably
dialog: smaller then The Ritz. So whatever
dialog: materials you brought for The Ritz,
dialog: should be doubly effective here.
dialog: Now this next piece of information
text: is colossal, try not to over react.
dialog: The Fubrer, will be attending tomorrow.
text: Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT TAKE.
text: Bridget's eyes bore holes in him.
text: BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS
text: They see Hugo do the spit take, and burst out laughing.
text: Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling spit takes, like they

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: SGT.POLA NEGRI

speaker_heading: STIGLITZ
dialog: Wonderful name, Sgt.
scene_heading: SGT.POLA NEGRI
dialog: Thank you, Lieutenant. When he's old
dialog: enough to ride a bicycle, I will buy

text: He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers to cheers.
dialog: They do.
text: Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big flourish.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: There you go. But wait, I'm not finished yet.
text: She reaches into her clutch, and pulls out some lipstick.

speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.
scene_heading: SGT.POLA NEGRI
dialog: Thank you fraulein, thank you. Max may
dialog: not know who you are now. But he will.
dialog: I will show him all of your movies.
dialog: He will grow up with your films,

dialog: Then, to the whole tavern...
scene_heading: SGT.POLA NEGRI
dialog: I purpose a toast to the greatest actress
dialog: in Germany! There is no Dietrich, there is
dialog: no Riefenstahl, only Von Hammersmark!
text: The whole room toasts.
dialog: This would be a good time for the German Sgt to go back to his

scene_heading: SGT.POLA NEGRI
dialog: So, Frau Von Hammersmark, what brings

scene_heading: SGT.POLA NEGRI

dialog: she says;
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Major, if my word means anything, I can
dialog: vouch for everything the Young Cap't has
dialog: just said. He does hail from the bottom
dialog: of Piz Palu, he was in the film,
dialog: and his brother is far more handsome
dialog: then he.
text: The impostors laugh.
text: Then....so does the Gestapo Major. He turns to the Sgt.
speaker_heading: MAJOR HELLSTROM
dialog: You should rejoin your friends.
text: Which the young Sgt is more then happy to do. That table

speaker_heading: MAJOR HELLSTROM
dialog: So the object of the game, is to write

dialog: (He SNAPS his

speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Few questions about what?
speaker_heading: LT.ALDO
dialog: About I got three men dead back there,

dialog: the fuck happened?
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: The British officer blew his German

speaker_heading: LT.ALDO
dialog: 'fore we get into who shot John,
dialog: why did you invite my men to a

dialog: of Nazis?
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: I can see, since you didn't see

speaker_heading: LT.ALDO
dialog: Yeah, we gotta word for that kinda
dialog: odd in English, it's called,

speaker_heading: BRI DGET
dialog: Don't let your imagination get the

speaker_heading: LT. ALDO

speaker_heading: LT. ALDO
dialog: Okay, let's pretend there were no
dialog: Germans, and everything went exactly
dialog: the way it was suppose to. What would
dialog: of been the next step?
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Tuxedos. To get them into the
text: premiere, wearing military uniforms,
dialog: with all the military there, would
dialog: of been suicide. But going as
dialog: members of the German film industry,
text: they wear tuxedos, and blend in with

speaker_heading: LT.ALDO

speaker_heading: LT.ALDO
dialog: Enormous changes at the last minute?

speaker_heading: BRIDGET

speaker_heading: BRIDGET

speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Splendid. When the Nazi's put me up

scene_heading: SGT.DONOWITZ
dialog: We both speak alittle Italian.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
text: With a atrocious accent, no doubt.
dialog: But that doesn't exactly kill us
dialog: in the crib. Germans don't have a
dialog: good ear for Italian. So you mumble
dialog: Italian, and brazen through it, is
dialog: that the plan?
speaker_heading: LT. ALDO
dialog: That's about it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: That sounds good.
speaker_heading: LT. ALDO

speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: No, it's good. If you don't blow it,
dialog: with that, I can get you in the
dialog: building.
dialog: (Change tone)
dialog: So, who does what?
speaker_heading: LT.ALDO
dialog: Well I speak the most Italian, so
dialog: I'll be your escort. Donowitz speaks
dialog: the second most, so he'll be your
dialog: Italian cameraman. And Hirschberg
dialog: third most, so he'll be Donnys
dialog: assistant.
speaker_heading: HIRSCHBERG
dialog: I don't speak Italian.
speaker_heading: LT. ALDO

speaker_heading: COL.LANDA
speaker_heading: (GERMAN)
dialog: Don't be modest. Everybody is quite
dialog: taken with your resolve. A accident,
dialog: like you've just experienced, and
dialog: yet you still show up to to a
dialog: important Party event. The Fuhrer
dialog: was quite adamant in his gratitude.
dialog: We'll use Mademoiselle Mimieux's office.
dialog: (To Aldo
dialog: in Italian)
dialog: I'm afraid I must rob you of your

dialog: What are ether of them suppose to do, argue?
text: Col.Landa goes over to one of the Nazi GAURD/USHER, and
text: whispers in his ear, gesturing toward Aldo. Like he's saying,
dialog: leave the boy alone, till we come back... .Or is he?
text: Col.Landa limps Bridget away towards Shosannas office.
text: As Aldo stands in the lobby, more and more people enter the
dialog: auditorium, till it's only Aldo and the six Nazi Gaurd/Ushers
text: in the now vacant lobby.
scene_heading: INT - SHOSANNA'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Shosanna's cinema manager office. It's small, cluttered, and

speaker_heading: COL.LANDA
dialog: Have a seat fraulein.
text: Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk.
text: She lowers herself in the chair.
text: Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk,
text: opposite her. The SS Colonel pulls another little chair over,
text: and places it in front of the fraulein.
text: He sits. Their knees almost touching.
text: The colonel points to the foot not in the cast.
speaker_heading: COL.LANDA
speaker_heading: (GERMAN)
dialog: Let me see your foot.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
speaker_heading: (GERMAN)
dialog: I beg your pardon?

speaker_heading: COL.LANDA
dialog: Put your foot in my lap.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Colonel, you embarrass me.
speaker_heading: COL.LANDA
dialog: I assure you fraulein, my intention
dialog: is not to flirt.
text: Patting his lap more with more aggression.
text: The nervous fraulein, lifts up her strapy dress shoe enclosed
text: foot, and places it in the Colonel's lap.
text: The Colonel, very delicately, unfastens the thin straps that
text: hold the frauleins shoe on her foot...
text: .He removes the shoe...
dialog: .Leaving only the frauleins bare foot...
dialog: THEN...
text: He removes from his heavy SS coat pocket, the pretty dress shoe
dialog: the fraulein left behind at La Louisiane...
text: He slips it on her foot...
dialog: .it fits like a glove.
text: Bridget knows she's BUSTED.
text: Col.Landa smiles and says in ENGLISH;
speaker_heading: COL.LANDA
dialog: What's that American expression...

speaker_heading: (GERMAN)
dialog: .to my last breath.
speaker_heading: COL.LANDA
speaker_heading: (GERMAN)
dialog: "Resist to your last breath"?
text: SUDDENLY...
text: Hans LUNGES forward, putting his strong mitts around Bridget
text: Von Hammersmarks lily white delicate neck, and with all the
text: violence of a Lion in mid-pounce, SQUEEZES with all his MIGHT.
text: Bridgets face turns tomato RED, as the VEINS in her face
text: BULGE, and her esophagus is CRUSHED in his GRIP.
text: With a violent YANK, he JERKS her TO THE FLOOR. She TUMBLES
text: out of the chair, Landa never releasing his GRIP around her
text: throat. Nov fully on top of her, he BEARS DOWN, SQUEEZING THE
text: VERY LIFE OUT OF HER. Every thing he has, he brings to bear on
text: the elegant ladies neck.
text: Then, to finally finish her off, he begins BANGING THE BACK OF
text: HER HEAD, HARD AGAINST THE FLOOR...
dialog: BANG!
dialog: BANG!
speaker_heading: BANG?
text: She's dead.
text: He releases the grip around her throat. His hands are
text: TREMBLING...
text: He rises.
dialog: Strangling the very life out of somebody with your bear hands,
dialog: is the most violent act a human being can commit.
text: Also, only humans strangle, the opposable thumbs being quite
text: important part of the endeavor. As Hans Landa stands, the
dialog: sheer violence he had to call on to accomplish this task,
text: still surges through him. He tries to gain control of the
text: trembling, that is rippling through his body. He takes out a
text: silver SS FLASK(filled with peach schnapps), and knocks back
text: a couple of swigs. He holds his hand out in front of him. The
text: TREMBLING is beginning to subside. He picks up the telephone.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 139-
text: Into the phone in German he says;
speaker_heading: COL.LANDA
dialog: Inform The Fuhrer the audience has

dialog: Step one, in Hans master plan, done.
text: He then dials another number...
scene_heading: INT - LOBBY - NIGHT
text: Aldo in the lobby...
text: WHEN...
text: .he's JUMPED by the SIX NAZI USHERS...
text: He's THROWN ROUGHLY to the ground face first. Like the modern
text: day Secret Service, within seconds, his wrists are handcuffed
text: behind his back, he's searched, they find the BOMB attached to
text: his ankle, it's removed, a BLACK CLOTH BAG is pulled over his
text: head, then he's hoisted up, and RUSHED out of the building.
text: This happens in mere seconds, and quietly too, no one in the

text: He reaches out with his finger, and lightly touches Aldo's
text: face right in the middle of the hood.
text: Aldo's head VIOLENTLY FLINCHES.
speaker_heading: COL.LANDA
text: Caught ya flinching.
text: In German, he orders the men put Aldo in the back of a truck.
text: Aldo, bound, and bagged, is put in the truck. Also in the

text: bound, and bagged like the Lieutenant.
text: The Truck drives off.
text: Col.Landa turns around, and SEES FROM A DISTANCE, Hitlers

dialog: seat, son, and you stood up real good.
text: Utivich Cries LOUDER.
text: Aldo takes his foot, finds Utivichs foot, and places his foot

speaker_heading: LT. ALDO
dialog: Well, I speak alittle Italian -
speaker_heading: COL.LANDA
dialog: I speak a little Tagalog, but I
dialog: wouldn't begin to presume I could
dialog: pass for Filipino. Don't get me
dialog: wrong, I understand you were in a

dialog: Still.... Chico Marx is more

dialog: Jew Hunter, (pfuit), I'm a detective.
dialog: A damn good detective. Finding

dialog: I worked for the Nazi's finding people.
dialog: And yes, some of them were Jews.
dialog: But Jew Hunter? Just the name that stuck.
speaker_heading: UTIVICH

speaker_heading: COL.LANDA

speaker_heading: UTIVICH
dialog: What do you mean, The Little Man?
speaker_heading: COL.LANDA
dialog: The Germans nickname for you.
speaker_heading: UTIVICH

speaker_heading: COL.LANDA

speaker_heading: LT.ALDO

speaker_heading: LT. ALDO
dialog: How do you know our names?
speaker_heading: COL.LANDA
dialog: Lt.Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't
dialog: interrogate every single one of your

dialog: We simply aren't operating on the
dialog: level of mutual respect I assumed.
dialog: Now, back to the whereabouts of your
text: two Italian saboteurs. At this
dialog: moment, both Hirschberg, and

dialog: very seats we left them in. Seats,
dialog: 0023 and 0024, if my memory serves.
text: Explosives, still around

speaker_heading: LT. ALDO

speaker_heading: COL.LANDA

speaker_heading: COL.LANDA
dialog: So gentlemen, lets discuss the

text: All three have their Chianti filled glasses.
speaker_heading: COL.LANDA
dialog: So the way I see it, since Hitlers
dialog: death, or possible rescue, rests
dialog: solely on my reaction...If I do
dialog: nothing ...it's as if I'm causing his
dialog: death, even more then yourselves.
dialog: Would you agree?
speaker_heading: LT. ALDO
dialog: I guess so.
speaker_heading: COL.LANDA
dialog: How about you Uitivich?
speaker_heading: UITIVICH
dialog: I guess so too.
speaker_heading: COL.LANDA
dialog: Good, we more or less, all agree.
dialog: Gentlemen, I have no intention, of
dialog: Killing Hitler, and killing Goebbels,
dialog: and Killing Gerring, and killing

dialog: Now they get it.
speaker_heading: COL.LANDA
dialog: If you want to win the war, tonight,
dialog: We have to make a deal.
speaker_heading: LT.ALDO
dialog: What kinda deal?
speaker_heading: COL.LANDA
dialog: The kind you wouldn't have the

dialog: betting. For ..
speaker_heading: (THINKING)
dialog: .O.S.S. would be my guess.

speaker_heading: LT.ALDO
dialog: You just say, bingo.
speaker_heading: COL.LANDA
dialog: Bingo! How fun. But I digress, where
