scene_heading: TITLE SEQUENCE OVER MUSIC
text: A series of tight CLOSE-UP shots of dancers moving in high
text: energy fast paced sexy choreography. Very provocative. Legs.
text: Arms. Butts. Boas. Sequins. Costumes. High heels. A
text: kaleidoscope of images and colors.
text: END TITLES ON A BLACK SCREEN
text: FADE IN sounds of PEOPLE TALKING -- GLASSES CLINKING -- all
text: the BACKGROUND SOUNDS of a BUSY, HIP NIGHTCLUB. SUDDENLY.. .a
text: loud DRUM ROLL.
text: CAMERA is low, moving through BACKSTAGE, passing CURTAINS and
text: the WINGS, flying out onto a shiny black STAGE awash in
text: light. PUSH IN on FOOTLIGHTS which are now blinding us,
text: blasting into camera as they form the word...
speaker_heading: BURLESQUE
text: DRUM ROLL ends with a CYMBAL CRASH. The SCREEN goes BLACK.
text: Then we hear an opening MUSIC "INTRO", a bawdy QUARTET.
text: EXTREME CLOSE UP: RED LUSCIOUS LIPS... speaking directly into
text: CAMERA in a smoky, sultry voice.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Once upon a time ...a long, looong
dialog: time ago... there was a good little
dialog: girl...and they called her...
text: REVEAL ...TESS. A stunner with impossibly long lashes,
text: theatrical make-up and a sequined, skin-tight band-aid of a
text: dress. She works the tight stage of the club, toying with
text: the AUDIENCE.
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Burlesque.
text: MUSIC BLARES from a HOT YOUNG BUMPER BAND -- sax, drums, bass
text: -- wearing bowler hats, suspenders and lots of ink. The
text: crowd HOOTS. Lame streamers EXPLODE from the stage.
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Some say she up and died-of
dialog: neglect. Abandonment.
speaker_heading: (WHISPER)
dialog: .old age.
text: The club's red booths are about half-full with a hip crowd.
text: Walls cluttered with photos. Celebrities tucked in shadows.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: But I say...no matter how hard you
dialog: try, you can't keep a good girl
dialog: down. And I've got a bevy of 'em.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: A DOZEN gorgeous, leggy GIRLS fight for the mirror. Miles of
text: skin. Heavy make-up. Lashes. Boobs. Butts. Fishnets.
dialog: Boas. And SEQUINS. Oceans of them. It's definitely
text: decadent. Completely cabaret.
speaker_heading: TESS (O.S.)
dialog: Come to think of it, none of them
dialog: are all that good, which isn't all
dialog: that bad...
text: SEAN (31), a cute gay guy with an armful of accessories
text: pushes his way through the girls and in a blur, tightens a
text: corset, tosses a boa, adjusts a garter just so.
speaker_heading: TESS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Eight shows a week. Sixteen
dialog: gorgeous girls. Thirty-two towers
dialog: of luscious legs...
scene_heading: BACK ON TESS --
text: Behind her, our GIRLS slink onto the stage one by one.
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Say hello to Scarlett. Jesse.
text: Anna. Coco-puff. And Georgie-Girl.
text: The girls gather at the edge of the stage, lit by footlights,
text: moving in place to the beat of the INTRO MUSIC. Hips sway.
text: Fingers snap. Tess weaves playfully between them.
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: All of them the creme-de la creme.
speaker_heading: (CYMBAL CRASH)
dialog: De la creme.
text: The girls strike nasty, (but funny) provocative poses, etc...
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Each one a bastion of bodacious...
dialog: (Coco bends over, peers
dialog: between her legs)
dialog: Elegance.
text: TWO GIRLS upside down on chairs NAIL aerial splits.

dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Not to mention their other...
dialog: (smacks Coco on the ass)
dialog: Ass-ets.
text: Coco raises a brow, moves her butt to a LOUD BUMP-AND-GRIND.
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Welcome to the Burlesque Lounge,
text: dead smack in the center of the
dialog: Sunset Strip-- did I say "strip?"
dialog: (cat calls from audience)
dialog: I meant TEASE...
text: FOOTLIGHTS FLARE, UPLIGHTING THE GIRLS. They shift their
text: weight, hitting the beats with risque moves and hip-thrusts
text: as they MOVE DOWNSTAGE suggestively toward the audience to
dialog: the MUSIC...
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET, GRUNDY, IOWA - NIGHT
text: A small, grime-streaked steel town, hanging on by the skin of
text: its teeth. Boarded-up storefronts, a run-down A&amp;P. CAMERA
text: MOVES past an old sign: WELCOME TO GRUNDY!!! and lands on
text: a broken neon sign that reads "DWIG 'S BAR" It flickers so
text: you can read the name: DWIGHT'S. Then goes back to DWIG.
scene_heading: INT. DWIGHT'S BAR - SAME
text: Chipped paint. Old beer posters. A few pathetic customers.
text: Beer on tap. Pinball standing lonely in the corner.
text: A REGULAR drains his beer, tosses down a quarter and starts
text: to leave. Someone stops short at the table.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Uh, excuse me? You forgot
dialog: something.
dialog: He turns. Sees:
text: ALI ROSE. One hand holding a bar rag, the other planted on
text: her hip. Ali has a look that's all her own: short shorts,
text: white platform sandals, hair piled up high, more make-up than
dialog: the rest of Grundy's women combined. She's young -- 22 --
dialog: but has a confidence that's got nothing to do with age.
speaker_heading: REGULAR
dialog: No, that's your tip.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Huh. See, now that's interesting --
dialog: you and I must do math completely
dialog: differently, cause me? I start with
dialog: the six beers I brought you, add
dialog: the four spills I cleaned up, the
dialog: five times I refilled your peanuts,
dialog: plus the three times you
dialog: "accidentally" touched my ass, then
dialog: I tack on lying to your wife when
dialog: she called looking for you, twice,
dialog: and I come up with a sum that's a
dialog: hell of a lot more than twenty-five
dialog: cents.
text: Before the Regular can respond, Ali is joined by LORETTA --
dialog: 30's wearing every one of those years hard.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: She's just teasing, Ike. You go on
dialog: home now, and tell Kay I said hi.
text: The Regular leaves. Loretta picks up the quarter.
speaker_heading: LORETTA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's better than nothing.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Nothin's cheap. A quarter's an
dialog: insult.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: It'll cover half a load down at the
dialog: Spanky Clean.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: There's only one thing a quarter is
dialog: good for.
text: Ali takes the quarter and heads to the back of the room,
text: passing a GEEZER who's sitting by himself, drinking alone.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Oh no, hon, now you know how Dwight
dialog: feels about that.
speaker_heading: ALI
text: Dwight isn't here.
text: Ali stops in front of the rinky-dink karaoke machine.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: He could come back any minute.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Tough. I'm not working here for the
dialog: tips Loretta.
text: She pops the quarter into the machine and chooses a song.
text: She picks up the microphone and, after a few opening beats,
text: starts singing ETTA JAMES'S "SOMETHING'S GOT A HOLD ON ME".
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
text: OOOOOOOOOH, SOMETIMES I GET A GOOD
scene_heading: FEELING, Y-E-A-H
dialog: And now we see where the confidence comes from. She's got a
dialog: voice that's way too big for this town-- the kind that
text: reaches way down inside you and rattles things loose.
text: WE HEAR the same song continue as we INTERCUT with:
scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT
text: The Girls undulate at the footlights as they sing the chorus:
speaker_heading: BURLESQUE GIRLS
text: YEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHH...
speaker_heading: WE INTERCUT:
text: IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali is belting now. Loretta is torn between
text: enjoying listening and watching the door for Dwight.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I GET A FEELING THAT I NEVER,
dialog: NEVER, NEVER HAD BEFORE, NO, NO ...
text: ON THE BURLESQUE STAGE the Girls belt out a raucous chorus.
speaker_heading: BURLESQUE GIRLS
text: YEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHH...
text: As other ENTERTAINERS appear onstage:
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: The insatiable La Puccini Triplets!
text: Death-defying daredevils Missy and
dialog: Kitten DeVille! The Countess of
dialog: contortion, Eva Destruction! And
dialog: how about a little love for those
dialog: bad boys of burlesque, our naughty-
dialog: bawdy bumber band!
text: THE TATTOOED BAND blares as the troupe kicks in unison
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
text: IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali sings, with a powerful vocal quality
text: reminiscent of Etta James, Sarah Vaughn, Billy Holiday.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU RIGHT NOW,
text: THAT, OOOH ...
text: ON THE BURLESQUE STAGE, the GIRLS and the BAND, loud and
text: bawdy.
speaker_heading: BURLESQUE GIRLS
text: OOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHH!!
text: IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali, letting loose now. Wailing.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I BELIEVE, I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT
text: SOMETHING'S GOT A HOLD ON ME,
speaker_heading: YEAH.
text: ON THE BURLESQUE STAGE, the BURLESQUE GIRLS move in a line
text: toward the audience, confident, sexy. The BARTENDERS,
text: WAITRESSES and people working at the club sing along.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: OH ... IT MUST BE LOVE!
speaker_heading: BARTENDERS
speaker_heading: BA-DA, BA-DA, BA-DA:
text: IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali, letting it rip. The Geezer sips his
text: beer, unmoved.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I'VE GOT A FEELING, I FEEL SO
scene_heading: STRANGE. EVERYTHING ABOUT ME SEEMS
dialog: TO HAVE CHANGED, STEP BY STEP, I
scene_heading: GOT A BRAND NEW WALK, EVEN SOUND
text: SWEETER WHEN I TALK. I SAID, OH.
text: ON THE BURLESQUE STAGE, The Girls.
speaker_heading: BURLESQUE GIRLS
speaker_heading: OOOOH.
text: IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali.
speaker_heading: ALI
text: OOOH. HEY BABY, IT MUST BE LOVE!
text: ON THE BURLESQUE STAGE, The Girls form a line.

speaker_heading: BURLESQUE GIRLS
dialog: YOU KNOW IT MUST BE LOVE.
text: IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali sings.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: YOU KNOW IT WALK LIKE LOVE. IT TALK
text: LIKE LOVE. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
text: NIGHT, MAKE ME FEEL ALRIGHT:
text: IN THE BURLESQUE LOUNGE, The Girls, Tess, the other
dialog: Entertainers, Busboys, Waitresses, Bartenders and entire
text: company do a BIG FINISH.
speaker_heading: ALL
scene_heading: BA-DA, BA-DA, BA-DA, BA-DA!
text: IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali finishes the song. Loretta CLAPS. The
text: Geezer, unimpressed, gets up and leaves.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: People around here wouldn't know
dialog: talent if it bit 'em in the
dialog: Danglies. Where you gotta go is Des
dialog: Moines. They got karaoke bars
dialog: where you can win a hundred bucks a
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Loretta-- when I get out of this
dialog: butt-hole of a town, I sure as shit
dialog: won't be heading for Des Moines.
text: She hops up onto the bar, spins around on her butt, one leg
text: up in the air like a Varga girl, then hops down on the other
text: side then gets back to work.
scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
text: The audience is still applauding as the Performers crowd into
text: the backstage area, squeezing past the Puccini Triplets
dialog: preparing their act.
text: Tess comes off stage and bumrushes Sean.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Where the hell is Nikki?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Rehab, if there's a God.
scene_heading: The BACKSTAGE DOOR BURSTS OPEN revealing--

speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I heard that.
text: Nikki, a stunning, feisty brunette, sashays in--
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Jesus, Nikki, you're later than
dialog: Georgia's period! Where were you?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
text: Weave, wax, paws and claws.
text: She drops her bag, quickly peels her clothes off, holds out
text: her arms as Sean slips her corset onto her--
text: Tess eyes Nikki's body--
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Hold it right there. Weigh in.
text: Nikki unwillingly steps on the scale. Tess shakes her head.
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Put on five pounds or I bump you.
text: Nikki protests as Sean double-takes at Georgia -- who FLITS
text: BY with a slightly protruding belly.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAILER PARK - IOWA - NIGHT
text: Ali winds her way through the trailers, carrying a bag of
text: take-out, with a swing in her step -- moving to music playing
text: in her head. She reaches a double-wide, lets herself in.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Nanna? Got your pot roast here!
scene_heading: INT. ALI'S TRAILER - NIGHT
text: TV noise. She comes in, kicks off her heels.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: They were out of steak fries, so I
dialog: got you some of those...
text: Then she stops in her tracks. Nanna -- 80's, housecoat,
text: oxygen tank -- is slumped in her chair. The TV remote is on
text: the floor. "ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT" is blaring.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: Nanna?

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - IOWA - DAY
text: Loretta and Ali, at the grave with a MINISTER who looks to be
text: about 17. A CEMETERY WORKER is nearby, picking his teeth
text: with a toothpick.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MINISTER
dialog: Dear Lord, we gather here today not
dialog: to mourn, but to celebrate the life
dialog: of Alison Rose.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Arlene.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MINISTER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: She's Arlene. I'm Alison.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MINISTER
dialog: Oh, shit.
dialog: (then, befuddled)
dialog: Can I start over?
text: Ali rolls her eyes.
speaker_heading: LATER,
text: The Minister and the Cemetery worker walk away, leaving Ali
text: and Loretta alone.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: You were real good to her, Ali.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: No, she was good to me.
text: She rearranges the flowers resting on the plot, fixing it up.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: And she wasn't even my real Nanna.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: What...?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Foster care. She took me in for the
dialog: checks. When I turned eighteen, the
dialog: money stopped coming. She could've
dialog: kicked me out, but she didn't.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
text: She had a lot of pain at the end.
dialog: Nothing she talked about, but I
dialog: could tell.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Well, then I guess this is a
dialog: blessing. Now she's free.
dialog: ON ALI, thinking realizing:
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: (talking about herself)
dialog: Yeah. I guess she is.
scene_heading: INT. ALI'S TRAILER - DAY
text: Nanna's clothes - mostly flowered housedresses -- are folded

dialog: under it.
scene_heading: HEAR MUSIC OVER: "HONEY ROCK."
scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: HONEY:::
text: In the wings, Tess watches with Sean.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Girls look good tonight.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Amazing what a pink spotlight can

speaker_heading: BURLESQUE GIRLS
dialog: GO, HONEY, GO!..'
scene_heading: INT. ALI'S TRAILER - DAY
text: MOVE IN ON ALI, as she counts the money. Shit. Not enough.

dialog: up.
scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: BURLESQUE GIRLS

text: Ali sets down her suitcase and marches over to him.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: You know what, Dwight? Contrary to
dialog: what you've been told, there's no
dialog: law in Grundy that says you have to
dialog: spend every waking minute being a
dialog: tight-fisted, cheap-ass prick --
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: (trying to intercede)
dialog: Ooh, hon, I'm not sure that
dialog: particular approach is gonna --
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I've spent three years of my life
speaker_heading: HERE--
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: --And you'll probably spend another
dialog: three. You want to quit? Good
dialog: riddance. I'll replace you before

text: ANGLE ON: THE CASH REGISTER. Ali opens the drawer, pulls out
text: a wad of cash. Peering out back to make sure Dwight isn't

speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I'm only taking what he owes me.
speaker_heading: (THEN)

speaker_heading: SEAN

speaker_heading: VINCE

speaker_heading: VINCE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: He wants to raise his offer. I
dialog: told him we'd hear him out.
text: Tess spins around, looking him in the eye for the first time.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Vince, I don't care what the number
dialog: is; the only way Marcus Gerber will
dialog: get this club from me is by prying

scene_heading: INT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT

text: Ali unzips the pocket on her suitcase, takes out the FRAMED

text: Ali perks up-- looks out the window as the bus rounds a bend
text: and... THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN comes into view. NEW MUSIC UP:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - HOLLYWOOD BLVD. DAY - CARRY MUSIC
text: The rush of tourists and traffic. Through a sea of people
text: moving down the crowded sidewalk we FIND ALI as she emerges
text: through the crowd, carrying her bags. Looking around at this
text: exciting city. She SPOTS a SHITTY HOTEL with a sign: "$49.00
text: a night." She looks up at it. Then heads across the street--
scene_heading: INT. ALI'S HOLLYWOOD HOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: Cramped, dingy carpet, chipped paint. Key in the door. The
scene_heading: MIDDLE-EASTERN HOTEL MANAGER -- 40's -- leads Ali in,
text: pointing out the features of the room, speaking fast in an
text: impossibly thick Kurdish accent. Ali nods along, not
text: understanding a word. When he stops:
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Okay!
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Well. Good luck with that.
text: He drops her suitcase on the bed and stands there. Waiting.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, hang on.
text: She digs into her purse. All she has is twenties. She peels
text: one off and holds it out.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: If I could just get a little --
text: But before she can finish, he pockets it, nods and leaves,
text: closing the door behind him. To the closed door:
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: -- change.
text: She pulls open the blinds, they fall off the wall with a
text: CRASH! Ali stares at them. Then she opens the window. The
text: SOUNDS OF HOLLYWOOD pour in.
text: She digs out her cash, sticks it under the mattress. Then
text: she reconsiders.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
text: She removes the money, takes a Ziploc bag full of make-up
text: from her purse, dumps the make-up onto the bed, seals the
text: money up in the Ziploc, and takes it into:
text: THE BATHROOM. She lifts the lid of the back toilet tank and
text: slips the Ziploc of cash under it, catching the bag in the
text: lid as she sets it back down, so it won't fall in.
text: She goes back into the main room to find a CALICO CAT sitting
text: on the window sill. It MEOWS, hops into the room.

text: Ali stops in her tracks. Tougher competition than she was

text: "SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW". Just as Ali gets in line, the
text: door opens and a SKINNY GUY sticks his head out.

scene_heading: EXT. SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT
text: Ali wanders down the sidewalk chugging an iced latte. The

text: the throngs, alone, anonymous, invisible.
text: She passes a CONSTRUCTION SITE for a 15-STORY-TALL BUILDING,
text: all lit up, guys working at night. A BUS pulls out, spewing
text: exhaust. As the smoke clears, Ali sees, across the street:
text: A BEAUTIFUL, STATUESQUE GIRL standing on the landing of a
text: fire escape under a street lamp beside a NONDESCRIPT CLUB.
text: Ali catches glimpses of her as the Sunset traffic whizzes by:
text: full make-up, spangled burlesque costume, impossibly high
dialog: heels, awesome. This is Coco. Coco makes the dirty
text: streetlight look like a movie-quality Kleig. Everything about
text: her shimmers.
text: Intrigued, Ali looks for a break in the traffic and crosses
text: the street. As she nears the club, she hears a MAN'S VOICE:
speaker_heading: ALEXIS
dialog: Like I said, LOOK BUT DON'T TOUCH!
text: ALEXIS, drag queen/door whore, also in full costume and make-
text: up, TOSSES a GUY out the front door onto the street, then
dialog: heads back inside--
text: Ali smiles to herself. Then turns back to look at COCO who
text: disappears inside a BACK DOOR as...NIKKI walks out. Lights a

speaker_heading: NIKKI

speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Sorry, you're just -- so DAMN

speaker_heading: NIKKI

speaker_heading: NIKKI

speaker_heading: ALI

speaker_heading: SEAN

speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I'm really sor--
text: The stage door slams shut. Ali picks up the strand of beads.
text: Holds them up in the light, watching them shimmer.
text: She goes to the front of club, where a smattering of L.A.
text: HIPSTERS enter. There's a GLASS DISPLAY CASE full of photos
text: of the acts. Ali looks at the pictures of the Girls in their
text: elaborate costumes and provocative poses.
text: She's unintentionally made her way to the front door. Black
text: curtains obscure her view inside. She peers in. HEARS cool
text: music emanating. The sounds of a nightclub. Intriguing. She
dialog: ventures inside...
scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: Ali MOVES down a DIMLY LIT HALLWAY. More beautiful photos of

speaker_heading: ALEXIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Twenty bucks.
text: Ali looks in her wallet. Sees one lone twenty inside. She
text: hands it to Alexis. He nods for her to go ahead. Ali
text: descends a staircase INTO THE CLUB...
text: .and is BOMBARDED by: colors, chaos, laughter, scandal --
text: all shimmering, as if someone dunked the place in glitter.
text: And over it all, an incredible mash-up of old music with a

scene_heading: PART REVEALING--

text: choreography: thrusting hips, whipping heads, stomping feet.
text: Ali watches, exhilarated, as the music builds and SWELLS to a
dialog: full on performance with the entire ensemble--
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Get you a drink?
text: She turns. A bartender is watching her watch. JACK - 25,
text: punky, dark hair, eyeliner, one arm half-sleeved with tats.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Only if you're buying.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (slides her a beer)
dialog: Welcome to L.A.
speaker_heading: ALI
speaker_heading: (DISAPPOINTED)
dialog: Is it that obvious?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You still have that new-car smell.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Not brand new. But still under

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Where you from?
text: She looks back at the stage, mesmerized.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Iowa.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, yeah? Kentucky. We're
dialog: practically related.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I thought you looked familiar.
text: He smiles. As Ali sips her free beer, Jack stacks drinks on a
text: tray for a DITSY WAITRESS. He slides the tray to her. She
text: doesn't notice. He barks at her:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey_. Go.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
text: The Waitress picks up the tray -- almost spilling the drinks -

speaker_heading: ALI
speaker_heading: (TO HERSELF)
dialog: Damn...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: They don't build 'em like this in
dialog: Iowa, huh?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Hell no. I wouldn't have left.

dialog: (points to the stage)
dialog: to there?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Is this you flirting?
speaker_heading: ALI
text: With someone wearing more eyeliner

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Ask for Tess. She's your guy. Flirt
dialog: away.
text: As she heads off--
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, Iowa-- use my name.
text: He hands her a card. She looks at it:
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Thanks, Jack.

text: In the middle of the maelstrom sits Tess, at a mirror,

speaker_heading: ALI

speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: (glued to the mirror)
dialog: So am I. And sometimes, when the

text: She switches to mascara. Sean, arms heavy with corsets,

text: steps closer to Tess.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Hi. I'm a friend of Jack's, and I'm-

speaker_heading: TESS

scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: The Bumper Band plays as Ali makes her way back toward the

text: Ali sees the trays on the end of the bar. She grabs one, goes

speaker_heading: ALI

speaker_heading: JACK

text: Nikki opens a bottle, pops 3 pills in her mouth, washes them
text: down with the drink, and sets the empty glass on Ali's tray.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: You, I guess.
text: Nikki turns to the mirror and starts getting to work. As Ali
text: hands out the other drinks:
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: Tess? Do you have a second?
text: Tess doesn't answer. But a slight glance at Ali in the
text: mirror shows she's half-listening.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: I was thinking -- see, I grew up
dialog: listening to all this music, I'd
dialog: play the records over and over --
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Fast-forward, babe. I gotta rebuild
dialog: Rome in the next two minutes--
speaker_heading: (CALLING OUT)
text: --SOMEONE TALK TO DAVE ABOUT THE
text: VOCALS ON THE NEW TRACKS!!!
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Now see-- that's what I've been
dialog: thinking about. There's one thing I
dialog: don't get.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Just one?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: It's the vocals. You have the
dialog: girls lip-synching. which is fine,
dialog: I guess, but wouldn't it be so much
dialog: better if they actually sang?
text: The Girls trade looks, knowing Ali's overstepping here. Ali
text: doesn't feel the vibe-shift, surges ahead.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: I've been reading up on it, and
dialog: back when burlesque started, that's
dialog: what they did.
text: Silence. Nobody moves. All eyes on Tess.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Oh, no she didn't?
text: Tess slowly spins around in her chair to face Ali. Peers at
text: her with a supercilious gaze.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: "When burlesque started"? Which
dialog: was...when?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: (searching her memory)
dialog: Oh. Well... this book said it came
dialog: after...
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Vaudeville -- is the word you're
dialog: looking for. Derived from the 15th-
dialog: century French expression "voix de
dialog: ville" -- "voice of the city".
dialog: Popular songs of the time that were
text: strung together into stage shows.
dialog: Which, over time, gave birth to
dialog: another kind of show in which
dialog: talented girls showing a bit more
dialog: skin danced, did skits, and, _ yes,
dialog: sang. In addition to being
dialog: raunchier, these shows were
dialog: funnier, hence the new name.
dialog: "Burlesque": "comical" in French.
text: Ali sees the Girls enjoying this dressing-down immensely.
text: Tess stands, peers down her nose at Ali.
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Dance major. Juilliard. I did my
dialog: thesis on Burlesque.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Oh. Ok. It's just-- It's just
dialog: that ...I CAN sing and--
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: We can all sing. But they don't
dialog: come to hear us sing. They come to
dialog: see the best dancers in town backed
dialog: by the greatest singers in history.
dialog: (then, condescending)
dialog: But tell you what: when you find
dialog: someone with better pipes than
dialog: Sarah Vaughn, Billie Holiday and
dialog: Etta James-- you let me know.
text: She sashays out leaving Ali standing there with what's left
text: of her dignity and an empty cocktail tray. The Girls launch
text: back into prepping for the show.
scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Ali pushes in, pissed off, and hears the sound of PUKING.
text: She sees Georgia's BOOTS sticking out from under the stall.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Georgia? You okay in there?
text: A FLUSH. The stall door opens. Georgia comes out shakily
text: with mascara-smudged eyes, sweet as ever.
speaker_heading: GEORGIA
dialog: I don't know why they call it
dialog: morning sickness when it hits at
dialog: every freakin hour of the day.
text: She rinses her mouth out at the sink.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: There aren't many women who could
dialog: dance the Charleston on a chair at -
dialog: - what are you, three months?
text: Georgia turns sideways to the mirror, inspecting her bump.
speaker_heading: GEORGIA
dialog: Four. Can you believe my boyfriend
dialog: hasn't noticed yet?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: You haven't told him?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: GEORGIA
dialog: I guess as long as he doesn't know,
dialog: I can still imagine he'll be happy
dialog: about it.
dialog: (looks in the mirror)
dialog: Oh my God, look what the cat
dialog: dragged in.
text: She gets to work wiping away her smudged mascara.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: You look pretty hot to me.
text: Georgia reaches into her corset, yanks one breast skyward,
text: then does the same to the other.
speaker_heading: GEORGIA
dialog: Yeah, well -- you take what Mother
dialog: Nature gave you and milk the hell
dialog: out of it, right?
text: Coco enters carrying a glass of tonic for Georgia.
speaker_heading: GEORGIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks, Coco.
speaker_heading: COCO
speaker_heading: (TO ALI)
dialog: Shouldn't you be on the floor?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I had to pee. Is that okay with
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: COCO
dialog: Not when you're blocking my mirror
dialog: it's not.
text: Ali sees she's in the way. As she steps aside:
speaker_heading: COCO (CONT'D)
dialog: (re. the music)
dialog: That's us. You okay, or are you
dialog: gonna puke on me during the number?
speaker_heading: GEORGIA
dialog: I can't make any promises.
text: Coco drags her out, leaving Ali alone. Ali looks at herself
text: in the mirror. Reaches into her shirt and does the boob-hoist
dialog: that Georgia did. Looks again. Better.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: INT. ALI'S HOLLYWOOD HOTEL BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Ali trudges up the stairs, tired. Suddenly, TWO YOUNG THUGS
text: barrel down the stairs, past her, almost knocking her over.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Hey!
text: They tear past her. She shakes her head, reaches her
text: landing, heads down the hall toward her room, then sees:
text: HER HOTEL ROOM DOOR, ajar. The lock broken.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: No. No!
text: She runs down the hall.
scene_heading: INT. ALI'S HOLLYWOOD HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Ransacked. Ali rushes in, goes straight into:
scene_heading: INT. ALI'S HOLLYWOOD ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: The lid is off the toilet tank. Her Ziploc of money is gone.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: No!!! God damn it!!!
text: She looks out the window, SEES the ROBBERS running off,
text: disappearing down the street. She kicks the trash can. It
text: flies across the room.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn it! Damn it, damn it, damn
dialog: it, damn it, damn it!
text: She sees the cat watching her from behind the bed.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: A lotta help you were.
text: The cat creeps out, slinks around her legs. Ali plunks on
dialog: the bed.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit.
text: Then she sees, on the floor, the PHOTO she took from Nanna's.
text: She picks it up. The glass has cracked, tearing the picture.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
text: She takes the picture out of the broken frame, smooths it out
text: -- then looks around her trashed room. Fighting despair.
scene_heading: EXT. WEST HOLLYWOOD STREET - NIGHT
text: FOLLOW a motorcycle up the street. The DRIVER has a KEYBOARD
text: on his back. He parks, gets off, takes off his helmet. It's
text: Jack. He heads for his apartment, but slows when he sees:
text: ALI, sitting on his steps, her bags at her feet. Head low.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Ali? What's wrong? You okay?
text: She tries to speak, but can't -- so she just nods.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Really? Cause, in my experience--
dialog: when you're on someone's doorstep
dialog: surrounded by everything you own,
dialog: there's usually a not-so-good story
speaker_heading: THAT--
speaker_heading: ALI
speaker_heading: I-- WAS--
text: And as she expected, as soon as she talks, she starts to cry.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
scene_heading: --RO-0-0-0-OBBED.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Shit. No way!
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: (halting, gaspy sobs)
dialog: Came in -- busted the lock-- and
dialog: stole all my MO-NEY-EY-EY-EY!!!
text: She sobs--trying to talk, with high-pitched SQUEAKS only
text: heard by birds. Jack winces, trying to follow--
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: (more gaspy sobs)
dialog: And there's no way I-- sleep there--
dialog: with-- like that-- the manager said-
dialog: - not till Monday-- and I don't--
dialog: anyone else-- but then-- so I
dialog: remembered I had...but it went
dialog: straight to...so I...
text: She reaches in her pocket, pulls out a card. It's Jack's that
text: he gave her in the club. It has his address on it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay. I have no idea what you just
dialog: said, but come on in here and we'll
dialog: get it sorted out.
text: She looks at him. Wiping her tears. He picks up the heaviest
text: of her bags and leads her to:
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Tiny one-bedroom. Very "done." Floral sofa. Curtains that
text: match the area rug. Candle groupings.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Have a seat. I'll get us BOTH a
dialog: drink. Here --
text: He hands her his phone. She looks at it.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: -- call whoever you want, long-
dialog: distance, whatever--
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sure you can. Go ahead.
text: Her chin starts quivering all over again.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I.. .don't ...have anyone.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: To call.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No parents?
dialog: (she shakes her head)
dialog: Siblings? Aunts? Uncles?
speaker_heading: (NO AGAIN)
dialog: Friends?
speaker_heading: ALI
speaker_heading: (THROUGH TEARS)
dialog: No one! No one, okay? Do I have
dialog: to spell it out for you? I am --
dialog: completely -- alone!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
text: Jack susses out the situation.
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (REALIZING)
dialog: So...you're not here to use my
dialog: phone.
text: She starts to cry again.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. Wait. No, stop, stop, stop,
dialog: it's okay, it's fine. You'll crash
dialog: here. No problem. Just, please --
dialog: no more crying.
text: She nods. He grabs a bottle of Tequila and a couple of
text: glasses. Pours them a couple. They both take a drink.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Better?
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. Good.
text: She wipes her eyes.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Just for one night, I swear. Just
dialog: till it's light outside and I can
dialog: figure out my next move.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Deal.
text: Then she opens her small bag and the cat strolls out.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoa, whoa, you didn't say anything
dialog: about a cat.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: What? You don't like cats?
text: It slinks around his leg. He shakes it off.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I hate cats.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: How can you hate a cat?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's easy, I'll show you.
text: The cat bolts into the bedroom.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Where's it going? If that thing
dialog: pees on my bed --
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: He goes outside. We just have to
dialog: open a window. He's very
dialog: independent.
text: She opens the window. The cat scurries back in, leaps onto
text: the ledge. Ali pets him. Looks at Jack, smiles.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't have a name for him yet.
text: It purrs. Jack eyes it warily.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: One night?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: One night.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LATER
text: IN THE LIVING ROOM, the lights are low. Ali's on the couch,
text: under covers, cat at her feet. INTERCUT WITH:
text: THE BEDROOM. Jack at his keyboard, playing from sheet music,
text: learning a song. When he pauses, from the living room:
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: You're good.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Why don't you play at the club?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Make more money bartending.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: You in a band?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Was... Guitarist moved to Reno,
dialog: Drummer went to med school, bassist
dialog: is in rehab. I'm subbing around
dialog: town till I regroup. This is for a
dialog: punk fusion band -- their
dialog: keyboardist is a flake, so they
dialog: call me a lot.
speaker_heading: ALI
speaker_heading: (SARCASTIC)
dialog: A flaky punk-rock-fusion
dialog: keyboardist? No way.
text: He smiles. Continues playing.
text: HIGH ANGLE, seeing both of them on either side of a wall.
text: Her listening, him playing. After a few measures:
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey...
text: He stops playing again.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: Why'd you leave Kentucky?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why'd you leave Iowa?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Cause I looked around and realized
dialog: there wasn't one person whose life
dialog: I wanted.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Exactly.
text: A beat. Then as he starts playing again:
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Hey Jack?
text: He stops again.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you. I'm really glad I'm not
dialog: alone tonight.
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Get some sleep.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
text: He continues playing. She closes her eyes.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Light rain on the window.
text: CLOSE ON: THE CAT'S FACE, staring right into camera.
text: REVERSE ON: Jack, waking up. As his eyes open, the Cat licks
text: him on the mouth.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Aauuuugggghh.
text: He hurls the cat away and bolts out of bed, disgusted.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Jack straggles in, wiping his mouth. The sofa's made up,
text: blankets folded. Ali is making breakfast, her back to him.
text: He can't help but notice she's only wearing a tiny tank top
text: and undies. She hears him clear his throat.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Morning. Coffee?
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (NODS)
dialog: Black. Like my soul.
text: She pours him a cup. Sees a picture of a BEAUTIFUL GIRL on
dialog: his fridge.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: She's pretty. Your sister?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: My fiancee. Natalie.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Fiancee? You're straight?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Of course I'm straight. You
dialog: thought I was gay?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I don't know, the...make-up?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's a look.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: A straight look.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: And the floral couch...?
speaker_heading: ALI/JACK
dialog: Natalie.
text: As Ali realizes she's barely dressed in front of a straight
dialog: guy.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I should put on pants.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Probably.
text: She bolts out to the living room, starts digging through her
text: bag, bent over. She's in the doorway, so from the kitchen,
text: all he can see is her cute little ass sticking out.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: New York. Doing a play.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: For how long?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Six more weeks.
text: She can't find pants. She shifts, so now her ass is facing
text: him directly. He tries not to look--
speaker_heading: ALI
speaker_heading: (KEEPS DIGGING)
dialog: Oh, God, now I feel bad about this.
speaker_heading: I'M SORRY--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I don't know. Now that you're
dialog: straight and engaged, it feels
dialog: weird that I came here.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, you did, and it was fine.
text: Aha! Pants. She pulls them out, starts putting them on. He
text: looks out. Her foot is caught in the pants leg. As she hops
text: around, trying to untangle it--
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Or at least it will be as soon as
dialog: you get dressed.
text: She tumbles out of view, thumps against some furniture.
text: She appears in the doorway, pants on, pulling on a sweater.
text: She slips her feet into her shoes.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Alrighty then-- I'll get outta your
dialog: hair now...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Wait, where're you headed?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Oh, don't worry about me. I've got
dialog: a plan.
dialog: (scoops up the cat)
dialog: Come on, cat.
text: She zips the cat into the bag he came in.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hang on, let me at least spot you
dialog: some cash. I'm a little strapped,
dialog: but I could --
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: No, I'm good, if you could just
text: She nods at the door. He opens it for her.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you. For everything. You
dialog: are my knight in shining...
text: eyeliner.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: (out the door)
dialog: I'll see you at the club.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Cool.
text: She leaves. He closes the door behind her. Stands there.
scene_heading: EXT. JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Ali looks at the rain. Then marches out into it, lugging her
text: stuff. Goes about 15 yards in one direction, then stops.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - SAME
text: Jack watches her out the window as she marches 15 yards in
text: another direction, then stops. Pondering. She sees a bus
text: stop across the street. She crosses to it and sits.
scene_heading: EXT. BUS STOP - DAY
text: Ali peers down the street for the bus. Jack appears beside
text: her, getting soaked in the rain.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So, this plan of yours?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: .was to sit here at the bus stop
text: and come up with a plan.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Come back inside.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: No, Jack, I--
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: ALI--
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I'll figure it out, this is not
speaker_heading: YOUR PROBLEM--
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's pouring!
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: It's only water for chrissakes--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: GOD DAMN IT! GET YOUR ASS BACK IN
dialog: MY HOUSE! NOW!
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Jack-- you've done enough and--
text: In ONE MOVE he SCOOPS HER up as she lets out a WHOOOOP!
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: Jack-- No! Stop it!
text: He grabs her bags and carries her back across the street--
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: The DOOR KICKS OPEN-- they ENTER, Jack carrying Ali, dripping
dialog: wet.
speaker_heading: ALI
scene_heading: PLEASE PUT ME DOWN--
text: He sets her down--
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Look, you have nowhere to go, I
dialog: have a couch. You may as well stay
dialog: here for a few days.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: You really don't need to do that.
dialog: I'll be fine --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You'll be homeless. You always have
dialog: this much trouble saying yes when
dialog: someone is trying to help you?
speaker_heading: AL I
dialog: It's never happened before.
text: The Cat jumps up on the back of a chair, all wet, and SHAKES,
text: splattering them with wet cat smell.
speaker_heading: JACK/ALI
dialog: Aaaaargh!
text: As his PHONE RINGS.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: There's a towel in the bathroom--
dialog: dry yourself and that damn cat off.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 48.
text: Ali collects the cat-- heads for the bathroom. Jack checks
text: his phone. Answers.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Hey, baby, how's it going?...
dialog: Really? That's awesome...
speaker_heading: ALI (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (CALLING OUT)
dialog: DO YOU HAVE A BLOW DRYER?
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: That...? Just this person from work
dialog: What? No, she's just a friend,

scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - DAY
text: CLOSE ON A HEAVILY MADE-UP GIRL as she screams and drops out
text: of the shot in a flying split. Behind her, a ROW OF DANCERS
dialog: do the same. Typical, fantastic, old-school can-can.
text: WIDEN to see Tess and Sean, on the floor, auditioning them.
text: The club is brightly lit, none of its evening aura.
text: Scattered around the club are other HOPEFULS in groups,
text: waiting for their turn.
scene_heading: MUSIC CONTINUES OVER:
scene_heading: EXT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - DAY

scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - DAY
text: Ali and Jack enter as the auditions are under way. As they
text: set up the bar, Ali watches the stage, intrigued.
text: MONTAGE: the dancers auditioning, in small groups. All

dialog: 
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Okay, front row, thank you very
dialog: much.
text: They walk off stage, dismissed. Tess turns to Sean.
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened to all the great
dialog: dancers in L.A?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: They're busy "Dancing with the
dialog: Stars."
dialog: (to the waiting dancers)
dialog: Last group, please.
text: HALF A DOZEN DANCERS move to the stage. Ali watches from
text: behind the bar, thinking. Then, on her face, we see: an idea
dialog: forming.
text: ON THE FLOOR, Tess and Sean check their clipboards,
text: organizing for this next set. They look up and start in:
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: All right, ladies, and five, six,
dialog: seven -- whoa.
text: There, in the back row, is Ali, in her white platform shoes.
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell do you think you're
dialog: doing?
text: Coco and Georgia ENTER-- surprised to see Ali on stage.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Trying out.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Tess, I've been singing and dancing
dialog: my whole life and--
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: The girls here have years of
dialog: training and experience. This stage
dialog: is for serious and professional
speaker_heading: DANCERS WHO--

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: (angry, interrupting)
dialog: Hey_. This is your club and you can
dialog: be as rude as you want--but don't
dialog: you dare tell me I'm not serious.
text: Sean's eyebrows reach for the ceiling as Nikki enters, SEES
text: Ali on stage.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: I may not have been to a
dialog: professional dance school, but I
dialog: have a lot of talent and I came to
dialog: this town to do something with it.
dialog: And the only reason I've been
dialog: putting up with all the bullshit
dialog: "attitude" I get from you is cause
dialog: I want to do it here.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: For the first time in my life, I
dialog: don't want to be someplace else. So
dialog: you're gonna give me MY shot. Right
dialog: here. Right now.
text: Everyone in the club just stands there. Jaws dropped. Tess
text: just looks at her, blinks, incredulous.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: One song. You don't like it, I'll
dialog: quit and do us both a favor.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Your call, lady. I know every

text: Sean, eyes big as saucers, looks from Ali to Tess, then back
speaker_heading: AGAIN--
speaker_heading: TESS
speaker_heading: (DOUBTFUL)
dialog: You know every number.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Which one do you wanna see?
text: Tess looks at her in disbelief.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: I said, which one do you wanna see?
text: Ali just stares at her. Calling her bluff, Tess yells up to
text: DAVE in the sound booth--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Tough Lover!
text: Tess plops down in a booth-- crosses her arms indignantly.
text: ON STAGE, the music starts. Ali readies herself, starts to
text: dance. Behind a beat to two. She's got the steps right, but
text: it isn't clicking. She's thinking too hard. No personality.
text: After a few measures, Tess has seen enough.
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay then, next?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Hang on.
dialog: (to Dave in the booth)
dialog: Start it again, please?
text: As Dave resets the music. Ali regroups: takes her hair down
text: and shakes it loose.
dialog: Nikki ENTERS, SEES Ali on stage--
speaker_heading: NIKKI
speaker_heading: (TO GEORGIA)
dialog: What the hell's going on?
speaker_heading: COCO
dialog: Shhhh.
text: On stage, Ali takes a beat; inhales, breathing in attitude.
text: Then she looks up at the booth again.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Anytime.
text: The MUSIC starts in again. And this time, Ali comes alive.
dialog: She may not have perfect technique or the best extension, but
text: she exudes an ambition and sexuality no one has seen from her
text: before. It's like she becomes a woman before our eyes. She
dialog: misses a step or two, but who the hell cares?
text: On the floor, Sean gapes, eyes popping. Tess is poker-faced.
text: Coco and Georgia's expressions turn from dubious to
text: respectful. Nikki's eyes narrow.
text: At the bar, Jack freezes, a huge rack of glasses in his arms -
text: - unable to tear his eyes away.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 52.
text: As the SONG CLIMAXES, Ali finishes with an alluring toss of
text: her ass, then lands in a sexy layout on a chair, owning the
text: stage. The music ends. A stunned silence. The only sound
text: is Ali's heavy breathing.
text: Then Georgia jumps up, APPLAUDING EFFUSIVELY.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: What are so you happy about, that's
dialog: your replacement.
speaker_heading: GEORGIA
dialog: Yeah, but she's really good.
text: Tess and Ali are in a stare down.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: I want so badly to say something
dialog: bitchy, but nothing's coming.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: There's a first.
text: Tess sighs, not wanting to give Ali any props.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: You were off the whole second half.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: So, I was spot on the first half?
text: Tess narrows her eyes at Ali. Then looks over at Nikki, Coco
text: and Georgia. Georgia gives an effusive THUMBS UP-- then
text: suddenly becomes overcome by nausea, covers her mouth and
dialog: RUNS to the bathroom to puke--
text: Tess rolls her eyes, looks back at Ali.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Oh, you're gonna be such a pain in
dialog: my ass.
dialog: Ali tries hard not to beam--
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Do I have the job, or not?
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: You're not great. What you are is
dialog: lucky. Because I need someone
dialog: tonight.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: And I know all the routines.
text: As Tess turns and leaves--
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Even in those shoes that time
dialog: forgot.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Theeeere's bitchy.
text: Nikki watches Tess go-- turns and pours herself a shot.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Well-- this totally sucks ass.
text: Sean jumps up on the stage.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Congratulations. The last time
dialog: someone showed Tess balls like
dialog: that, she married him.
dialog: (looks Ali over)
dialog: You look like a checker at a Mal
dialog: Wart in Wichita. Just tripled your
dialog: salary. Get a new look.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Hey, I happen to like the way I
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Really? That's a fascinating story.
dialog: And then what happens?
speaker_heading: (ALL BUSINESS)
text: Backstage in five.
speaker_heading: (WALKING OFF)
dialog: Welcome to the family.
text: Ali jumps off the stage, runs to the bar, where Jack is still
text: standing, slack-jawed. She throws her arms around him.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Sorry for the short notice, I quit!
dialog: (plants a big kiss on him)
dialog: But hey-- with my raise I'll be off
dialog: your couch in a week.
text: She squeezes him tight-- then heads backstage leaving him
text: standing there, really turned on.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - DAY
text: Sean swings open A DOOR, revealing a room packed to the gills
text: with costumes: feathers, sequins, fishnets, corsets, jammed
text: up against each other. Sean tosses her clothes in a blur.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: First number, second number, third
dialog: number...
text: She catches the clothes. He dumps shoes on top of them,
text: holding them up as he tells her what they go with:
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
text: With the sequined bustier. With
text: the shorts and garters. With the
dialog: beaded number. And those --
dialog: (points to hers)
dialog: I never want to see again.
speaker_heading: (REMEMBERING)
dialog: Oh! And --
text: He hands her a prop GOLD MACHINE GUN.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: For "Miss Otis Regrets". Just be
dialog: sure you don't --
text: Ali pulls the trigger. BOOM -- GLITTER SPLATS all over Sean.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Pull the trigger.
scene_heading: MUSIC UP: "RICH MAN'S FRUG". CARRY MUSIC OVER:
scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT
text: The chic audience watches the Girls doing a swingin' sixties
text: shimmy and shake number. CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the girls'
text: faces as drums roll and their heads turn to each drumbeat.
text: The last face to turn is ALI'S. In FULL STAGE MAKE-UP, she
text: looks like a gorgeous classic burlesque dancer. The girls,
text: in 20's revealing bathing suits and stilettos, kick and dance
text: downstage in a line. Ali struggles a little to keep up
text: A WAITER CROSSES FRAME and we WIPE TO:
scene_heading: - ANOTHER NIGHT. SAME MUSIC, different costumes. Ali's
text: dancing is improving. WAITRESS CROSSES FRAME and we WIPE TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
text: - ANOTHER NIGHT. SAME MUSIC, yet another set of costumes.
text: Ali's as good as anyone else up there. AN AUDIENCE MEMBER
dialog: crosses frame and we WIPE TO:
text: - ANOTHER NIGHT. SAME MUSIC, another set of costumes. Ali
text: knows the steps now, she's not thinking about them. She's
text: all performance, vamping to the audience, selling like crazy.
text: She NAILS a final layout on a chair, it's flawless.
text: Tess and Sean are watching from the wings. They notice the
text: extra whip in Ali's head, the bump in her grind.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Admit it. You like her. It kills
dialog: you, but you like her.
text: Tess meets his eye, then walks away. The number ends. The
text: girls rush offstage and peel their costumes off.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: My tits are up around my ears, my
dialog: thong's about a mile up up ass,
dialog: this corset is so tight, I haven't
dialog: breathed since Tuesday and these
text: lashes are thick enough to kick up
text: a stiff wind.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: It's fun being a girl, huh?
speaker_heading: ALI
speaker_heading: (BIG SMILE)
dialog: Yeah.
text: She hands him the last bits of her costume.
text: FOLLOW Ali as she heads to the dressing room. As she grabs
dialog: her T-shirt and jeans:
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I'm starving, who wants to go grab
dialog: some pizza before the next show?
text: A general chorus of "Yeah?" and "I'm in."
text: FOLLOW Ali to the bathroom as she throws on her clothes and
text: washes off her make-up, humming "Rich Man's Frug" to herself.
text: She heads back out to the dressing room to find:
text: EVERYONE IS GONE. She looks around. Feels like an fool.
text: She plunks down in a chair. Drops her bag on the floor.
text: Looks at herself in the mirror.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 56.
text: She sees a picture of A CLASSIC BURLESQUE BEAUTY taped to the
text: mirror. Notices her eye make-up -- strong, thick eyeliner.
text: Ali picks up a brush, dips it in eyeliner, and tries to
text: duplicate the look on her own eye. After a first try:
speaker_heading: TESS (O.S.)
dialog: Your brush is for shit.
text: She turns and sees Tess in the doorway. Tess comes over,
text: takes Ali's brush. Looks at it.
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Where'd you get this, the 99 cent
dialog: store?
text: She chucks it in the trash.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Make-up is like wine. The good
dialog: stuff costs a fortune but is worth
dialog: every penny. Where is everyone?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: All the girls went out for pizza.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Aren't you one of the girls?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Apparently not.
text: Tess reads her like a book. Knows what went down. She turns
text: to leave, then pauses at the door. Turns back.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Don't take it personally. Their
dialog: love's the kind you gotta earn.
text: Ali meets her eyes in the mirror. Then Tess grabs a brush
text: from her own station, tosses it to Ali.
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Dip it in water first, or you'll
dialog: never get a clean line.
text: She leaves Ali alone.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: ALI!!!
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Ali is just waking up.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Your stupid cat peed in the tub!
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: What...?
dialog: (sees the window closed)
dialog: You closed the window, what do you
dialog: expect?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Your cat pees in the house, and
dialog: it's my_ fault?!
text: Ali scoops the cat up.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Awwww. Poor guy, you must have been
dialog: desperate.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Goddamn cat. And you used my towel
dialog: again.
dialog: (then, pointed)
dialog: How's that apartment hunting
dialog: coming?
text: He GRABS the newspaper and tosses it in front of her-- she
text: glares at him, then glances at the paper--
speaker_heading: ALI
speaker_heading: (EYES WIDENING)
dialog: A thousand bucks for a studio?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Can you really put a price on
dialog: privacy? Freedom? Your own
dialog: bathroom? With clean towels?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Okay, Jack-- I get it--
text: His cell phone rings. As he checks who's calling:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Natalie.
dialog: (then, into phone:)
dialog: Hey, baby, how are you?
text: He heads into the bedroom, closes the door. Ali shakes her
text: head, begins to peruse the classifieds.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY
text: Ali, in pajamas, is at the table, combing the classified
text: apartment ads. The cat is beside her.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Guest studio, Hollywood, $900, with
dialog: a yard, and -- oh. No pets.
dialog: (to the cat)
dialog: Screw them.
text: She scans the ads some more. Finds a good one.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: Ooh?
text: Jack walks in. Looks like he's got something on his mind.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: I think I found my new place.
dialog: Where's Pomona?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Go to Hell, turn left, it's three
text: miles down on the right.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Really. How's Beachwood Canyon?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Great, if you have a car.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Truth is, you should get a car
dialog: first. This is L.A. You don't
dialog: exist without a car. Plus, you
dialog: can't really afford a decent place
dialog: yet.
speaker_heading: (THINKING)
dialog: Tell you what.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm gonna suck it up and let you
dialog: stay here a little longer. Just
dialog: throw in a little something for
dialog: rent.
text: She looks at him, curious.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: What about the "God damn" cat?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey, I don't like the cat. And I
dialog: don't like my towel being wet. I
dialog: don't like the lack of privacy. But
dialog: you're in a jam -- and I'm the kind
dialog: of guy, if a friend's in trouble, I
dialog: help. It's just who I am.
speaker_heading: ALI
speaker_heading: (SUSPICIOUS)
dialog: What did Natalie have to say?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nothing, you know just... hi.
text: She narrows her eyes at him. He concedes.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: And...her play got extended three
dialog: more months, so since she has to
dialog: pay rent there, she can't also keep
dialog: up her part of the rent here.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Ah-hah.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So if you could stick around and
dialog: chip in, it would --
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Save your ass?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: -- help.
text: Ali looks down at his shoes.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Well, will you look at that? The
dialog: shoe, on the other foot!
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: OKAY --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: One minute I'm a freeloader with a
dialog: God damn cat, the next, I'm the
dialog: only thing standing between you and
speaker_heading: EVICTION --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Just -- yes or no?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: What's the proposal, exactly?
text: Jack looks at her-- realizes he's screwed.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The bedroom, with private bathroom
dialog: access, for 600 a month, including
dialog: utilities.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Closet?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Half .
text: Ali picks up the paper, reads an ad.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Ooh, look! Hot tub!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Fine. The closet, too.
dialog: She weighs it. Makes him suffer. Then:
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: ALI
speaker_heading: (MOCKING HIM)
dialog: Hey, I'm the kind of girl, if a
dialog: friend's in trouble, I help. That's
dialog: just who I am.

scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: Through a transparent scrim, the Puccini Triplets perform a
text: sexy harem scene in silhouette, casting larger than life
text: shadows-- Tess walks behind the scrim playfully, in and out
text: of view. The Bumber Band plays off to the side.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: But you can bet your sweet ass I'm
dialog: better ONCE than I ever was...
text: The crowd laughs. Tess points to a woman who isn't laughing.
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Drink up, sister! You're a tad
dialog: behind.
dialog: (to a waiter, re: woman)
dialog: Be a dear and bring Mommy over

scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
text: Tess comes off stage. Sean bustles up to her.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: The distributor's holding back the

speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Ply him with drinks, send Scarlett
text: over to flirt, and try to finagle
text: him down to a half.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: How's a third?
text: He produces a check, all filled-out, for her to sign.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Have I told you lately that I love
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Got any brothers?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

text: He bustles off with the check. Scarlett, Coco and Nikki
text: approach the stage wearing leather, strappy Gaultier corsets
dialog: with gloves and fishnets --post-modern Germanesque -- Nikki
text: is carrying a glass of tequila. Tess eyeballs her--
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Drinking already?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Yes, Mommie.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: You're drunk.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: No. But I'm working on it.
text: Nikki totters a little. Tess looks her over.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: I'm pulling you from this number.
dialog: Go home, wring yourself out, and
dialog: come back tomorrow.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You can't pull me--
text: Tess SPOTS Ali heading for the dressing room--
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Ali! Take Nikki's spot.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: WHAT?! That bitch can't dance my

speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Ali-- get dressed NOW!

speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: But, wait-- Tess-- that's always

speaker_heading: TESS

speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Is there a problem? You said you
dialog: know the whole show.
speaker_heading: (CHALLENGING HER)
dialog: You can do anything, right?
text: Tess just looks at Ali. Nikki stares at Tess, livid, then
text: storms off.
scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - SAME
text: Marcus ENTERS the club and joins Vince at a table. A LOUD
scene_heading: DRUM ROLL. MUSIC UP.
speaker_heading: THE STAGE
text: Ali and the other dancers hit the stage and start in on the
text: vampy "TOUGH LOVER."
text: AT THE BAR, Jack is busy mixing drinks. He glances at the

speaker_heading: ALI
speaker_heading: (LIP-SYNCHING)
dialog: WHEN HE KISSES ME I'LL GET A
scene_heading: THRILL, AND WHEN HE DO THAT WIGGLE--
text: Nikki reaches out and FLIPS A SWITCH.
text: THE SOUND DROPS OUT. THE PLAYBACK STOPS. The girls freeze
text: in awkward poses, unsure of what to do.
text: MURMURS in the room as the audience looks around, confused.
text: BACKSTAGE, Tess looks up at the sound booth, sees it's empty.
text: Dave appears at her side.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You wanted to see me?
text: ON STAGE -- Ali looks at flustered Tess...the girls...the
dialog: audience. Panic.
text: On the floor, Nikki watches with satisfaction as she makes
text: her way over to Marcus. Enjoying the train wreck she caused.
text: Then -- in a flash, Ali turns to the audience, and SINGS
text: a'capella from the TOP OF THE SONG.
speaker_heading: ALI
scene_heading: OH--OH--OOOOOOOOOOH.
text: She looks around. Silence. Mouths agape. Tess approaches in

speaker_heading: SEAN

text: Tess looks at Ali, you could knock her over with a feather.
text: Sean looks at Tess. Scarlett looks at Coco. Jack stares at
text: the stage. Everyone stunned by the sound coming out of this
dialog: girl. And now the song really takes off!
text: SUDDENLY, one of the BAND BOYS grabs his sax and plays. Ali
text: jumps in, seamless, as the guys on Bass and Drums join in.
text: Ali picks up the choreography. The girls fall in with her.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: I WANT A TOUGH LOVER, YEAH, YEAH. I
scene_heading: NEED A TOUGH LOVER. WHOOO. I WANT A
scene_heading: TOUGH LOVER. YEAH-YEAH. TOUGH
scene_heading: LOVER. UH-HA...
text: Coco and Scarlett chime in on back-up. Hearing them, Jessie
text: and Anna join in as well. Ali takes off, holding nothing
text: back. The girls feed off her confidence, and soon all of
text: them are hitting the backs of their cabaret chairs, stomping
text: their feet to the music. The girls singing back-up.
text: In his seat, Marcus sits up a little straighter -- suddenly
text: paying more attention. Unable to take his eyes off Ali.
text: The BAND plays along. The BARTENDERS accompany them with
text: hand-claps. All except Jack, who's too spellbound to move.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
text: WHEN HE KISSES ME I'LL GET A THRILL
text: AND WHEN HE DO THAT WIGGLE, I WON ' T

scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
text: The Girls exit the stage in a flurry, everyone congratulating

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Well, you're too good to be singing
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I just got into the show and
dialog: suddenly I'm too good for it?
dialog: Shrugs, "but, you are" then--
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: How about a drink?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Sure. Jack's at the bar. Tell him I
dialog: sent you. It's on me.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: But I hate lines.
text: AT THE BAR - Jack looks up, SEES Ali and Marcus talking.
text: BACK ON MARCUS who looks Ali up and down.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Seriously. You sound even better
dialog: than you look. Which is saying a
dialog: lot.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Talk about a "line."
text: She smiles, amused, and heads away from him, toward the bar.
text: He watches her go. Tess intercepts Ali.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: What did he want?
speaker_heading: ALI
text: Directions to the bar.
text: As Ali heads off. Tess glances back at Marcus, mistrustful.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: After hours. The club is closed. Jack, Ali, Coco, Sean and
text: Georgia are sitting around the bar as Jack closes up.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You blew me away! Who knew you
dialog: could sing like that?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: COCO
dialog: Who knew any white chick could sing
dialog: like that? You channeled that shit.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: How the hell do you do that, girl?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I don't know, I can't explain it.
dialog: It's like -- I start singing, and
text: something starts to move inside me.
text: It's in my hands, my feet, my gut,
speaker_heading: MY THIGHS
text: She runs her hands over her body as she describes it. Jack
text: watches her -- holy smokes. Sean notices his gaze on her.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: and it just builds and builds
dialog: till I feel like I'm gonna explode.
speaker_heading: GEORGIA
dialog: Trust me, I know what that feels
dialog: like. I have to pee. Again.
text: She hops off the stool and scurries to the back. Coco
text: stands, to leave. Looks at Ali.
speaker_heading: COCO
dialog: Wanna grab something to eat?
text: Ali looks back at Coco -- validated. Accepted. At last.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Yeah. Lemme get my bag.
text: Ali moves off. Coco goes to get her coat. Sean sees Jack
text: still watching Ali as she walks across the room.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Well, will you look at that.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You looking at that girl the way I
dialog: looked at you all those years.
dialog: Only difference: you actually stand
dialog: a chance with her.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I have a fiancee.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: Three thousand miles away.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We talk every day.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Let me guess what about: her, her
dialog: and...oh! Her.
text: Jack shoots him a glare.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: All I'm saying is, this one's
dialog: beautiful on the inside too. And
dialog: she won't be on the shelf forever.
text: Ali comes back, ready to go. Feels them stop talking and
text: look at her.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I was just explaining to Jack that
dialog: even opportunity has a shelf life.
text: Jack grabs a trash bag and takes it out back. Sean looks at
text: Ali more closely. He brushes her hair out of her face. Then
text: he holds it off her shoulders and raises that gay eyebrow.
scene_heading: - INT. SALON - DAY - Ali sits in front of a mirror while Sean
text: gives the HAIRDRESSER very specific instructions.
text: - INT. JACK'S APARTMENT, AT HIS KEYBOARD, Jack plays a high-
text: energy style piano which runs over a QUICK SEQUENCE: It's the
text: instrumental music to: "BUT I'M A GOOD GIRL."
scene_heading: - INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - The Burlesque Girls dance on stage,
text: performing a high-energy tap dance, coupled with a European
text: slap-dance, with the slapping of each other's bodies and
text: faces integrated with tapping and music. It's very cabaret,
text: but modernized with contemporary STEPPING. CARRY MUSIC:
scene_heading: - INT. SALON - LATER - The HAIRDRESSER spins the chair
text: around. Ali's her hair is platinum blonde, with bangs and a
text: Louise Brooks bob that frames her face beautifully. Her
text: smoky eyes pop like never before. Ali studies herself:
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Where have I been all my life?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
scene_heading: - INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT - CAMERA MOVES OVER THE
text: AUDIENCE, the brass section kicks in giving the piano a
scene_heading: BIGGER, BAWDY, SHOW-STOPPING BOISTEROUS SOUND as Ali APPEARS
text: with her new look. Amazing. Like Helmut Newton meets Carnaby
text: St. circa 1965. As she begins this HIGH ENERGY SONG-- Jack is
text: looks up from the bar. Totally blown away.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
text: THE DRESS IS BOHAN. THE SHOES ARE

text: Ali finishes the song to big applause. Takes her bow. Makes
text: her way off the stage and ACROSS the club to...
text: JACK AT THE BAR - he turns to see Ali.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: Hiya, big boy.
text: She spins herself around on a bar stool, so he can see all
dialog: angles. Jack likes plenty. Way too much.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (FLUSTERED)
dialog: It's...I think-you look...I mean,
dialog: yeah... do you like it?
dialog: Not the reaction she was looking for.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Jack. It's okay for you to think I
dialog: look hot. We're friends for
dialog: chrissakes. It's not like we're
dialog: brother and sister.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
text: She rolls her eyes, gets up, and heads backstage. Jack
dialog: watches her go--
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: No. We certainly are not.
scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
text: The Burlesque Girls are prepping for the show.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Why the hell is everyone having a
dialog: conniption over her? She's just a
dialog: tacky, pushy girl from a --
text: Ali -- sexy, sophisticated, gorgeous -- enters.
speaker_heading: NIKKI (CONT'D)
dialog: -- fly-over state.
text: Ali pretends she didn't hear. She sits at her mirror. The
text: girls stare at her, mouths agape. Ali picks up her mascara
text: wand, looks down the mirror at Nikki's reflection.
speaker_heading: ALI
speaker_heading: (FAUX INNOCENT)
dialog: What's a fly-over state?
text: Ali takes a deft stroke of her wand over her lashes, then
text: bats them at Nikki. Nikki walks out. Coco smiles with
text: appreciation. Whistles long and low. The girls all laugh.
scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: Tess glad-hands guests, then spots Vince, waving at her. She
text: starts over, then sees Marcus in the booth with Vince. She
text: turns and walks the other way. Vince catches up to her.
speaker_heading: VINCE
speaker_heading: TESS --
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Vince, if I were going to sell, I'd
dialog: have sold to those idiots building
text: that monstrosity across the street.
dialog: I said no.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Which made Marcus bump his offer up
dialog: again. It's obscene, what he wants
dialog: to give us. At least hear him out.
scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - TESS'S CLUTTERED OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Tess, at her desk, reads a contract. Marcus and Vince sit
text: across from her, watching.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: It's very simple. I buy you out
dialog: and pay you a million off the top.
dialog: (motions to Vince)
dialog: Five hundred grand each.
text: Tess looks up from the contract, squints at Marcus.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Why do you want this club so badly?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
text: Best view on the Sunset Strip.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Do you know what you could do with
dialog: that money, Tess?
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Do you know what you can do with
dialog: that money, Vince?
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Be reasonable. We're rolling
dialog: vendors ninety days out.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: The club's not even worth what you
dialog: paid for it. You've got a second
dialog: mortgage, you can't get a third.
text: Tess looks at Vince, betrayed.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Did you also tell him about the
dialog: tattoo on my ass?
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: It's business, Tess. Not personal.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: My business. Which I built from
dialog: the ground up.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: You're not gonna get another
dialog: opportunity like this.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Exactly.
text: She looks at a photo on her wall: the Burlesque Girls, in all
dialog: their glory.
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Which is why I'll never let it go.
text: She gets up, opens the door, ushering them out. Marcus
text: shoots Vince an angry look as they head downstairs.
text: IN THE STAIRWELL, Vince reassures Marcus:
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Don't worry. The balloon payment's
dialog: due on the first. She doesn't have
dialog: the money. She has to sell.
text: IN TESS'S OFFICE, Tess stands in the doorway, having heard.
text: Then she walks back to her desk and sits, dejected. Head in
text: her hands. For the first time ever, looking worried and
text: defeated. Something she'd never show anyone. A beat. Then:
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Well. We've had a pretty good run.
text: She looks up. Sean is in the doorway.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe it's time to just.. .hang it
dialog: up. Let it go. Call it a day.
text: Tess's eyes go steely with determination.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: No. You cannot say that to me. I
dialog: can eat these "sky is falling"
dialog: dipshits for breakfast, lunch, and
dialog: dinner, but not YOU. You cannot be
dialog: that person. I've scoured dirty
dialog: flea markets for costumes, stayed
dialog: up all night sewing till my fingers
dialog: bled, painted and repainted every
dialog: goddamn wall of this place myself.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: I choreographed every step of every
dialog: number. I've played nursemaid,
dialog: sister, mother and shrink to every
dialog: girl who's ever danced here. I've
dialog: hocked every keepsake I've ever
dialog: owned to keep this place afloat.
dialog: Because this club is the last of
dialog: it's kind, and if it goes away, one
dialog: day there won't be anything like it-
dialog: - and THAT would be a tragedy. So
dialog: you cannot say that to me. Because
dialog: now someone's gotta believe in me,
dialog: Goddamnit. And I need that person
dialog: to be you. So don't you ever let me
dialog: hear you say that again. I will
dialog: never let this club go. Never.
text: Sean looks at her...a wry smile.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: There she is. Thought I'd lost you
dialog: for a minute.
text: Tess just looks at him, and smiles. He grabs a boa, throws it
text: around his neck and exits. When he's gone, Tess's smile
text: fades.
text: IN THE CLUB, the place is empty. Jack is wiping down the bar
text: cleaning up. He starts stacking some chairs in the house
text: as..SEAN CROSSES the floor.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Night, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Night.
text: Sean EXITS as Jack carries a stack of chairs to the side of
text: the room, sets them down near the piano. STOPS, grabs a chair
text: for himself and sits down. Begins to play an original song.
text: ACROSS THE ROOM, Ali ENTERS from backstage. Her dance bag
text: over her shoulder. She HEARS the piano, peers around a
text: column, SEES Jack playing. She stays in the shadows and
text: watches as he sings and plays a beautiful song. (TBD)
text: The song ends. Ali applauds slowly. Impressed. Jack looks up,
text: surprised that she is there.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Beautiful. You write that?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Just some sentimental crap. Ready?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 76.
text: She smiles at his modesty. Nods. He crosses to her. Grabs her
text: dance bag and they EXIT together.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Jack enters, unloading his keyboard from his back. He hears
text: Ali in the bedroom. He quietly moves over to the ajar
text: bedroom door -- peeks in and sees:
text: ALI, in bra and undies. She hums the song he played the night
text: before in the mirror as she gets dressed.
text: ON JACK, watching, mesmerized. His eyes travel her body.
text: She moves out of view. He leans against the wall to try to
text: keep seeing her -- and steps on the CAT. It MEOWS. He
text: flattens against the wall. Ali looks up.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Jack?
text: Jack zips back to the door, opens it quietly, then SLAMS it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey! Just got home!
text: Ali grabs a dress from her bed, slips into it.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: In here! Can you zip me up?
text: In a nanosecond-- Jack enters the bedroom.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey. Where you been?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Rehearsing. I'm playing a late
dialog: show tonight.
text: As he zips up the back of her dress, he sees the PHOTO
text: propped against the lamp on the bedside table.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Who is that?
text: She picks up the picture. Looks at it.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Me and my mom on my 7th birthday.
dialog: She died just a few weeks later.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She was so young.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: 24. There was so much she never
dialog: got to do. Sometimes I feel like,
dialog: if I make the most of my life, part
dialog: of her will get to live a little
dialog: more, too.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Wow. You must miss her.
text: She puts the photo down. Turns back to him. They're close.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Every single day, something happens
dialog: I want to tell her about.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What was today's?
text: A beat. Their eyes connect.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Don't know. Hasn't happened yet.
text: They stand there, close to each other. Jack sees a strand of
text: hair caught in the earring. He pulls it away, freeing it.
text: His fingers move through her hair. She closes her eyes,
text: feeling his fingers against her neck.
text: Then she opens her eyes, looks at him. He looks back, unable
dialog: to look away. Until:
text: His CELL PHONE RINGS. Breaking the mood. He pulls it from
text: his pocket. Checks who's calling. Looks back at Ali.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I should... it's... Natalie.
text: Ali steps away from him, disappointed. He answers the phone.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, babe, how are you?
text: Ali watches him walk away from her, falling into the
text: conversation with Natalie.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes, she's still here-What do you
dialog: want me to do, it's not like you're
dialog: here helping out, you know...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
text: Ali grabs her bag and jacket, heads for the door.
text: MUSIC UP: An incredibly sexy saxophone which takes us to:
text: FULL CLOSE UP: ALI steps into frame, starts singing.
speaker_heading: ALI
text: A GUY WHAT TAKES HIS TIME...
text: PULL BACK to reveal she's on stage at the club with the
text: BURLESQUE GIRLS. Finger waves and 1920's sexy clothes.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: I'LL GO FOR ANY TIME. I'M A FAST
text: MOVIN' GAL WHO LIKES THEM SLOW.
dialog: GOT NO USE FOR FANCY DRIVIN', WANT
dialog: TO SEE A GUY ARRIVIN' IN LOW. I'D
text: BE SATISFIED TO KNOW A GUY WHAT
text: TAKES HIS TIME...
scene_heading: THE SONG CONTINUES OVER:
text: - INT. JACK'S LIVING ROOM - Ali lies on her stomach on the
text: floor perusing a Fashion Magazine. Across the room, Jack sits
text: on the couch, PLAYING HIS KEYBOARD--UNDERSCORING THE SONG. He
text: looks at Ali. Watching her. Without looking up, she takes a
text: pencil, gathers her hair, and puts it up expertly. A few
text: strands fall back onto her neck. Sexy. Ali feels his stare.
text: Looks up at him. Smiles. He smiles back. She goes back to her
text: magazine. ON JACK. Loving that she's there.
scene_heading: - INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - DRESSING ROOM - Ali, the Girls and
text: Sean getting ready. Georgia bursts into the room, showing off

scene_heading: FOR ANYTIME. A HASTY JOB REALLY

text: AT THE BAR, Jack watches as he pours drinks.
scene_heading: - EXT. STREET. AFTERNOON - Ali on the back of Jack's
text: motorcycle, puts her arms around his waist. Jack revs the

text: their hair. Her scarf tears away, lifting into the air...
scene_heading: - INT. BURLESQUE STAGE - Ali and Burlesque girls continue...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)

scene_heading: DEMON FOR SLOW MOTION OR SUCH. WHY
dialog: SHOULD I DENY, THAT I WOULD DIE, TO
text: KNOW A GUY WHAT TAKES HIS TIME ...
scene_heading: - INT. JACK'S LIVING ROOM - Ali, Sean, Tess, Scarlett, Anna,
text: Georgia, DAMON (her fiance), hanging out in the living room,
text: decorated with party gear. The lights dim and Jack and Coco
text: enter with a birthday cake. They set it in front of Ali.
text: Ali looks around at her friends, drinking it in. She locks
text: eyes with Jack -- then closes her eyes and BLOWS.
scene_heading: - INT. BURLESQUE STAGE - Ali, still singing her song.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
scene_heading: I CAN SPOT AN AMATEUR, APPRECIATE A

scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - AT THE BAR - LATER
text: Ali walks up to the bar.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Hey -- when can you cut out? I'm
text: about to fall asleep standing up.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I have that gig, remember? In
dialog: fact, I gotta head out or I'm gonna
dialog: be late.
dialog: (checking his watch)
dialog: I can maybe swing you home before.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: No, that's okay, you go. I'll grab
text: a ride with Coco.
text: He grabs his jacket from under the bar. As he heads out:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: By the way -- you killed.
speaker_heading: ALI
text: (looks at him, smiles)
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 80.
text: He disappears out the back exit. Ali turns around and finds
text: herself face to face with Marcus.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: You ready?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I'll drop you off.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Coco left five minutes ago.
text: She realizes he was listening to her conversation.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Sorry-- I was coming to talk to you

dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: (putting on her coat
dialog: reaching for her bags)
dialog: Talk to me about...?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Dinner. With me. Gimmie that.
text: He swoops down and GRABS her dance bag and purse, turns and
text: heads out.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (WALKING AWAY)

dialog: alive again... you'll come with me.
speaker_heading: ALI

speaker_heading: ALI

speaker_heading: MARCUS

dialog: Oh, damn!
speaker_heading: ALI

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I just remembered I have to make a

speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: You just remembered.
speaker_heading: MARCUS

dialog: Marcus!
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Hey, let me get a drink, I'll be
speaker_heading: BACK --
text: Marcus pulls Ali in the opposite direction, avoiding another
text: GROUP trying to greet him. He grabs two wine glasses off a
text: tray, gives one to Ali, then pushes through a door into:
scene_heading: INT. MODERN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Bustling, food and booze everywhere. Marcus spots several
text: trays of hors d'oeuvres. He picks up two of them.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Marcus -- you can't just take that.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
speaker_heading: SHHH --
text: He hands her one tray, sticks a bottle of wine in one pocket,
text: throws an opener in another.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: They're gonna throw us out of here.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Not if we sneak out first, come on.

scene_heading: EXT. MODERN HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT

speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Hey, Marcus --
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Hey, Guys. Greg, Marla, this is

speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Aren't they? Louboutins.
speaker_heading: GREG
speaker_heading: (TO MARCUS)
dialog: Great party, as always.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Glad you could come.
text: Ali stares at Marcus. He smiles, takes her hand, keeps
text: leading her up the stairs.
speaker_heading: AL I
dialog: You had to make an appearance at
dialog: your own party?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Would've been rude not to, right?
dialog: You'd like those guys. Greg's the
dialog: entertainment editor at the Times,
dialog: and Marla's a designer.
text: Ali glances back at Marla again, locks in on her shoes.
speaker_heading: AL I
dialog: I'm gonna dream about those shoes.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Thousand dollars a pop.
speaker_heading: AL I
dialog: Jesus. Who can afford that?

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I can.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Hey, I saw them first.

text: BREATHTAKING PANORAMIC VIEW OF THE ENTIRE CITY is revealed.
text: Ali pauses, taking in the glittering, massive view of L.A.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoa. L.A. looks one hell of a lot
text: prettier from up here.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: It should. That view cost me three

speaker_heading: (POINTING)
dialog: See that strip mall down there?
speaker_heading: ALI

speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: There is nothing above it.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: You own...air?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Air rights. The guy who owns the
dialog: strip mall was having money issues
dialog: and almost had to sell. Whoever he
dialog: sold to would have put in a huge
dialog: tower. So I bought the air rights.
dialog: Now no one can ever build above one
dialog: story.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Aren't you the sly puss.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Mall guy gets to keep his property.

speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: How many girls have you used that
dialog: on?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: None who ever called me on it.
text: He smiles. Looks at her. Then...
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you want, Ali? In life.
dialog: Girl like you, gives up everything,
text: gets on a bus heading for total
dialog: uncertainty-- she's got a dream. I
dialog: want to know what it is.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Because you're talented enough to
dialog: get whatever you want. And I'm
dialog: smart enough to help make it
dialog: happen. So? What do you want?
text: A beat. She thinks about it. Looks him in the eye.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I want to be the best singer I can
dialog: be. I want to give as much joy as I
dialog: get when I perform. And I want to
dialog: die knowing I made the most of
dialog: every opportunity life gave me.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: That's ...so beautiful.
speaker_heading: AL I
dialog: There wasn't a dry eye in the house

speaker_heading: MARCUS

scene_heading: INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE - WEE HOURS - NIGHT
text: Party's over. Lights low. Ali walks through the almost-
text: empty house, passes a COUPLE making out on a couch, a GUY who
text: holds out a joint. She motions "no thanks", heads into the:
text: LIVING ROOM, where Marcus is asleep on a Bertolli chair,
text: drink in hand. An OLDER GUY is playing the piano quietly.
text: Ali takes the drink from Marcus's hand, sets it on the table.
text: She hears the pianist start a new song: (TBD). She smiles.
text: Goes over to him.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Ooh, I love this song.
text: The Piano Player scoots to make room. She sits beside him. He
text: starts humming along. She does too. Then he sings a line.
text: She sings one back. And they fall in together. Not vamping,
text: not performing. Just feeling the beauty of the music in the
text: middle of the night.

text: Jack quietly lets himself in. He sets his keyboard down, then
text: sees the bedroom door cracked, the light on.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Ali?

scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
text: Sean, Coco, Nikki, Jesse, and the rest of the girls in early

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Sure she does.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: SEAN

text: Tess rolls her eyes, doesn't slow.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Not now, Nikki.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Yes, now. I've been here since the

text: up out of nowhere-- who hasn't even
dialog: paid her dues--
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: I'll get her to write a check
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: And suddenly it's her show?
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: No, it's not her show. It's my
dialog: show. But people want to hear her
dialog: sing. She's bringing them in off
dialog: the streets. You better believe I'm
dialog: building a show around her!
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I can sing too! And you know it.
dialog: But you don't give a shit. You

speaker_heading: TESS
speaker_heading: NIKKI--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: And you expect me to dance behind a

dialog: of shoes she got for sleeping with
dialog: Marcus Gerber?
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: (unlocking her car)
dialog: Nikki, you're wasted. Go home.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I won't be upstaged by some slut
dialog: with mutant lungs!
text: Tess hurls the costumes in the trunk of her car, furious.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: So don't be! Leave! If you don't
dialog: want to be a part of what's
dialog: happening here, then I don't want
dialog: you around.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
speaker_heading: (AGHASST)
dialog: You'd destroy our friendship and
text: break up the group over some girl
dialog: you barely know?
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Since when do you care about
dialog: friendship? Or this group? You're
dialog: a trainwreck, Nikki! You put
dialog: tequila on your breakfast cereal!
dialog: I'm struggling to survive here, and
dialog: you show up too drunk to dance!
dialog: You call that loyalty?
text: Nikki just looks at her--
speaker_heading: NIKKI

text: Nikki flips her off and keeps walking. Then turns once more:
speaker_heading: NIKKI (CONT'D)
dialog: By the way: I slept with Vince the
dialog: day after your honeymoon.
text: Tess's eyes narrow. She grabs a HIGH-HEELED PUMP and HURLS
text: it. It flies through the air and hits Nikki in the back of
text: the head. Nikki SCREAMS, whips around, incredulous, to see:
text: TESS, running right at her. Nikki bolts, heading for her
text: car. She jumps in, locks the door just as Tess SMASHES her
text: fist on the window and KICKS the door. Nikki starts the car.
speaker_heading: NIKKI (CONT'D)
dialog: You crazy bitch!
text: Nikki screeches off, leaving Tess alone in the parking lot.
text: Tess stands there a moment, then HEADS back into the club.
scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: The club is totally empty. Everyone is gone. Tess ENTERS,

speaker_heading: ALI

dialog: the morning?
text: He turns, sees her.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Little overdressed for breakfast.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: My pajamas were in my bedroom.
dialog: Which was occupied.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, you're never here so... it's

text: Jack grinds the coffee beans again. Ali winces.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: So -- you want the bedroom back?
dialog: Is that what you're saying?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The bed should be used by someone.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Hey, I'm home every night. Maybe

dialog: things.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Jesus, Jack, what is your problem?
dialog: Ever since I started hanging out
dialog: with Marcus, you've been acting
dialog: like a class-A prick. Is there
dialog: something you want to say?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What? No. What do I care? You're
dialog: ambitious, he can make things
dialog: happen, go ahead, make a deal with
dialog: the devil, what's it to me?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: First of all: He's not the devil.
dialog: He's a smart businessman. And oddly
dialog: enough-- a gentleman.
speaker_heading: (JACK SCOFFS)
dialog: Second: I'm gonna take the couch,

speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Hey-- what're we, in junior high?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You still mad at me, Iowa? C'mon.
dialog: Bring it on.
text: She starts to say something as-- THE SHIRELLES start to sing
text: "BABY IT'S YOU"-- Jack turns to the DJ, points both fingers
text: at him and YELLS:
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: I LOVE THIS SONG, MAN!!!
text: Everyone stares at the drunk guy. Ali rolls her eyes and
text: walks off-- Jack swings her around, PULLING her close-- she
text: just looks at him. Starts to laugh at how drunk he is-- Jack
text: wraps her in his arms and starts to sing quietly in her ear.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: .Many many many nights go by, I
text: sit alone, at home and cry, over
dialog: you...
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Well, you're quite the crooner.
text: He looks her in the eye.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm sorry for being a class A
dialog: prick.
text: Ali smiles, surprised at his candor. He breathes a sigh of
dialog: relief.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: And as of about...
text: (bleary look at his watch,
speaker_heading: CAN'T FOCUS)
dialog: .some time ago, I am officially a
dialog: single man.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: You and Natalie split up?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That we did. So. That explains what
dialog: I'm doing here all alone. What are
dialog: you doing here all alone?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Do I look alone to you?
text: They share a look. Then he spins her around in his arms. She
dialog: laughs.
text: AT THE BAR, tipsy Sean and Coco stand side-by-side. Coco is
text: watching the DJ spin. The DJ glances down at them.
speaker_heading: COCO
dialog: That DJ's hot.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You think?
speaker_heading: COCO
text: He keeps looking at me.
text: Coco smiles up at him, flirty. The DJ smiles back.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: COCO (CONT'D)
dialog: Hmmm...I think he's cuckoo for Coco-
text: puffs.
text: They look at each other, then crack up like giggling
dialog: schoolgirls.
scene_heading: EXT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON: A KEY TRYING TO GO INTO A LOCK. Then it disappears
text: from view. We hear it CLANK to the ground. Then giggles.
speaker_heading: ALI (O.C.)
dialog: Whoopsie daisy --
text: PULL BACK to find Jack and Ali, drunk, staring at the keys on
dialog: the ground.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Whoopsie daisy?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: My Nanna used to say that all the
dialog: time. That and upsie jumpsie.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Upsie jumpsie?
dialog: (running it together)
dialog: Upsie jumpsie, whoopsie daisy,
dialog: upsie jumpsie, whoopsie daisy,
dialog: upsie jumpsie --
speaker_heading: (ABRUPTLY STOPS)
dialog: When would she say that?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: When she wanted her dog to get on
dialog: the bed with her. That is --
speaker_heading: (DRUNKEN WHISPER)
dialog: when she was alive.
text: Their eyes meet. A connection. Then, staring into her eyes:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (trying to be serious)
dialog: The dog, or Nanna?
text: Ali bursts out laughing. So does Jack, as he pushes the door
text: open, and they fall into the apartment.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 104.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Jack and Ali stumble in, Jack knocks the lamp over trying to
text: turn on the light. It BREAKS. Ali giggles as she plops down
text: on the couch, struggling to take off her leather boot. No
text: luck. She holds her legs out.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Help me.
text: Jack gets the lamp to standing, then grabs one of Ali's
text: boots, slides it off, dumps it. Then he tries the second --
text: it sticks -- he pulls harder -- the boot pops off and he
text: careens backwards, crashing into the lamp, knocking it over
text: again. Ali cracks up. He turns to the lamp.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (like to a dog)
dialog: Stay.
text: He turns back to Ali, regains composure, bows
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Good night.
text: He backs away, into the bedroom. Ali looks confused.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Oh. Okay.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Good night.
text: Jack disappears into the bedroom and closes the door. Ali
text: stares at it, surprised. Then resigned. Oh, well. She
text: undoes her bra, threads it through her top and out the arms.
text: Then Jack's door opens. He stands in the doorway in matching
text: "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" pajamas, leaning against the
text: doorframe like Hugh Hefner in his finest silk smoking jacket.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
text: Cute jammies.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: A gift from my mother. Never worn
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Go figure.
text: Jack walks past Ali, toward the door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Forgot to lock up.
speaker_heading: (HE DOES)
dialog: Okay. Night.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Night again.
text: He walks back into the bedroom and once gain shuts the door.
text: Ali smiles to herself, plumps her pillow. The door flies
text: open again -- Jack's there in just the pants, no top.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Water. No hangover.
text: He stumbles past Ali to the kitchen, drinks from the tap.
text: After a moment he returns to the bedroom, nodding to Ali.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Night.
text: Ali just nods. He closes the door. Ali smiles, waiting.
text: After a beat, the door opens again. Jack is there, in boxers.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
text: Hungry.
text: He walks past her to the kitchen, opens a box of cereal,
text: pours it into his mouth. Grabs some milk from the fridge,
text: pours it into his mouth, too. Returns to the bedroom,
text: crunching. He closes the door. Then -- very quickly -- he
text: opens it again and walks out.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: I know I forgot something else, but
dialog: I just can't remember what...
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: Door locked, water, food...
text: He wanders out into the room, past Ali, and we see from
text: behind he is butt-ass naked. She cracks up.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: What's so funny?
text: She covers her face. He glances down.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Well I never!
text: He strides back to the bedroom, shutting the door. After a
text: moment, he comes back out dressed in an old, flowered
text: bathrobe and fur-lined orange hunting cap.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: I remembered what I forgot to do.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (SERIOUS)
dialog: Kiss you goodnight.
text: He crosses to her, takes her in his arms, and kisses her.
text: She kisses back, making up for all their lost time.
text: MUSIC UP: "PRISONER" a big, soulful ballad.
scene_heading: PAN OFF THEM TO:

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I've been wanting to do this since
dialog: you first walked in the club.
text: She cocks an eyebrow at him.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Sure got a funny way of showing it.
text: He smiles at her.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll show you an even funnier way --

speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: So, what about Natalie...?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Natalie who?
text: Ali smiles. Rolls the stocking up over her shapely thigh,
text: then slowly takes it off. Looks at Jack. He strikes his

speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Do it again.

scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING

scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY
text: Where Jack and Ali are sleeping, entwined. The heels stop at

speaker_heading: NATALIE

text: Jack bolts up in bed. Stares.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Natalie!
text: Ali blinks awake. Confused.
speaker_heading: ALI

speaker_heading: NATALIE

speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: I can't BELIEVE I bought your

dialog: nothing."
speaker_heading: (TO ALI)
dialog: That's what he called you.
dialog: "Nothing. She's not even pretty.

speaker_heading: ALI

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Wait-- do you need money for a

text: Ali stifles him with an incredulous glare-- can't believe how
text: this is going down. She looks at him, so incredibly hurt.
text: Grabs her suitcase and brushes past him, stuffing her

speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Ali, wait a second-- don't--
dialog: (as the door SLAMS)
dialog: --go.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Shit.
text: Jack looks at Natalie. She folds her arms.
scene_heading: EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT - MORNING
text: Ali knocks on a door, suitcase in hand. A beat. Then a good-
text: looking guy, who's obviously just woken up, answers with a
text: blanket wrapped around him. He is the DJ from the wedding.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Oh. I'm sorry. I think I have the
dialog: wrong apartment. I'm looking for
dialog: Sean?
dialog: (off his blank look)
dialog: Brown hair? 5'10n? Early 30's?

speaker_heading: DJ (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Long story.
text: Sean notices the guy in the blanket.
speaker_heading: SEAN

speaker_heading: SEAN

speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Oh. Anyone want coffee?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I'll make it. You two get

scene_heading: INT. SEAN'S KITCHEN - DAY
text: Ali makes coffee, looking out the window at Hollywood. Her

speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Oh. Marcus.
speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: MARCUS (OVER PHONE)
dialog: You okay? You sound down.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Mmm. Maybe a little.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (OVER PHONE)
dialog: I know just the cure.
speaker_heading: ALI

speaker_heading: MARCUS (OVER PHONE)

speaker_heading: ALI

scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE
text: A curtain lifts revealing a black box, FIVE GIRLS from behind

speaker_heading: ALI

text: LIKE THE WAY YOU LOOK AT ME WITH
scene_heading: THOSE EYES, CONFIDENTLY WISE...
scene_heading: EXT. JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY
scene_heading: ANOTHER SLAMMING DOOR.

text: INTERCUT WITH THE SPOTLIT STAGE
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 114.
text: The girls continue the number. Post modern Gaultier bondage

text: golden light.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: PLEASURE I'M SURE, I ' VE MET YOU
scene_heading: BEFORE, BUT MAYBE NOT HERE, MAYBE

scene_heading: EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT - STAIRWELL - DAY
text: Sean and Mark exchange awkward good-byes.
speaker_heading: SEAN

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: With Marcus.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?
dialog:

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I told you, opportunity doesn't
dialog: knock forever.
text: Jack burns, frustrated, then heads slowly down the stairs.
text: Sean shakes his head and turns to go back inside. Then
dialog: pauses, noticing:
text: Mark, looking up at Sean's apartment, hesitating. Then he
text: opens his car to get in. Sean stands there, realizing he's
text: doing the same thing. He steps onto the stairwell. Calls out:
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey! You!
speaker_heading: MARK
speaker_heading: (LOOKS UP)
dialog: It's Mark.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Mark. You wanna have breakfast?

speaker_heading: MARCUS

text: He opens the fridge and pulls out a bottle of CHAMPAGNE.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: She was a poet.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
text: And a drunk.

speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: What new place?

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: All yours.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: Unpack. Move in.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Marcus, I can't just--
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Sure you can.
text: Marcus plops her suitcase on the bed.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Unpack. You're home.
speaker_heading: ALI
text: It's not even on the bus route.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Okay, that is the first and last

dialog: spoken in this house.
dialog: (motions out window)
dialog: Four cars. Which do you want?
scene_heading: EXT. MARCUS'S GAZEBO - SUNSET
text: Ali lies on a chaise overlooking the panoramic view of L.A.
text: against a fiery red sky. Marcus comes out of the house, with
text: a bottle of wine. Crosses and sits next to her on the chaise.
text: Marcus refills their wine glasses. An empty bottle already
text: there. She sips as she leans back and relaxes.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Better?
speaker_heading: ALI
speaker_heading: (SMILES)
dialog: Better.
text: She looks out at a giant billboard at eye level.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: You're gonna be on one of those

dialog:

speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Yeah, right.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Sooner than you think, too. Harold
dialog: Saint called me today. You made
text: quite an impression on him.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Really? What'd he say?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: He wants to make a demo with you.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Are you serious? When??
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: He found a little studio time on
dialog: Tuesday.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: This Tuesday?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Too soon?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: No! Oh my god, no, that's amazing.
dialog: You're amazing.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I like making you happy. Your whole
text: face lights up.
text: Their eyes meet. He pushes some hair out of her face.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I think you're way too nice to me.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: And that's a problem because...
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I've had a lot to drink. And my
dialog: judgment is off.
text: He touches her face, their chemistry palpable.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Hey, I'm a gentleman. Which means
dialog: I'd never kiss a lady when she's...
dialog: vulnerable.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 118.
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Liar.
text: She leans in and impulsively pulls him into a kiss.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Jack, alone now, collects the clothes Ali left behind. He
text: reaches under the couch and sees the PHOTO of Ali and her
text: mother. He picks it up, smooths out the cracks. Traces 7-
text: year-old Ali's face with his fingertips.
scene_heading: INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE - GUEST HOUSE - DAY
text: Ali lies in a tangle of 1000-thread-count sheets. Her eyes
text: blink open. She sits up alone, getting her bearings.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Where am I?
text: She sees a Warhol-esque PRINT OF MARCUS on the wall. She
text: raises her brows then sees her disheveled reflection in a
text: huge mirror: smeared mascara, hair askew.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: Who am I?
text: She sees her and Marcus's clothes in a trail on the floor and
text: bites her lip, remembering last night.
scene_heading: INT. MARCUS'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING
text: Ali, freshly showered, enters, a stranger in a strange land.
text: STAFF is milling around. She HEARS a SPLASH. Looks out the
text: glass windows, sees Marcus swimming laps. The HOUSEKEEPER
text: passes her, nods "morning". Ali smiles.
text: Then she notices a long table full of miniature MODELS of
text: BUILDINGS. She takes them in, pausing at a tall, sleek MODEL
text: of a glass HIGH-RISE, towering over the other models.
text: She runs her finger lightly over it, intrigued. Then she
text: sees the address marker: 7800 Sunset Blvd.
text: Ali stares, stunned. Marcus enters, toweling himself dry.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Morning.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 119.
text: He comes up behind her, nuzzles her neck.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Now it's a model. But when it
dialog: grows up, it'll be a mixed-use
dialog: space: retail and residential.
speaker_heading: ALI

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Not according to the city.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Does Tess know about this?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: What Tess knows and doesn't know
dialog: isn't a big concern of mine.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: What makes you think she would ever
dialog: sell the Lounge?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: She has no choice. She's going

dialog: embarrassed to admit...
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: I just saw the plans.
text: Tess looks at Ali. Stunned. Ali stands there, breathless,

speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: She has to do something! She can't

speaker_heading: ALI

text: Ali sits on a barstool, in disbelief.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I've got something for you.
text: He pulls out the photo of Ali with her mother. It's in a new
dialog: frame.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Where'd you get this?
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: Jack. He dropped it off on his way
text: to the airport.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Where's he going?
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: New York on the red-eye.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: To be with Natalie?

speaker_heading: ALI
speaker_heading: (TOUCHED)

speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: JACK! JACK! JACK!
text: ALL HEADS TURN to look at her, except Jack, who can't hear.
text: A PLUMP WOMAN in front of him looks at Ali. Ali points to
text: Jack. The woman taps Jack and points. He looks to see:
text: ALI, on the other side of Security. Jack takes his earphones
text: off and smiles. He crosses over to her, carrying his bag.
text: They are separated by several feet of security ropes.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Sean told me you're going to New

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I have to. I got an offer from that

dialog: want me to tour with them.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: They finally had it with the flaky
dialog: keyboardist. I'll be back in five

speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Yes! Yes. Absolutely.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What about Marcus?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: .Marcus who?
text: They share a smile, separated by the ropes.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm trying to figure out if I

dialog: I'll call you when I get there.
dialog: Take care of Miles Davis.
dialog: (off Ali's confusion)
dialog: Our cat. I named him.
text: They smile again. Neither wanting this moment to end. She

text: ON JACK, walking back to the gate-then -- he stops. Turns
text: back to see Ali, but she's gone.
scene_heading: FEMALE SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Boy, you get out there and kiss

scene_heading: MALE SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Ah, hell. Go ahead. Bag stays here.
text: Jack drops his bag, takes a running JUMP over the ROPES and
text: RUNS through the crowded concourse -- startling everyone.
text: ON ALI, as she walks through the concourse, reliving her last
text: sight of Jack. As she's about to get on the escalator:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 127.
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: ALI!
text: She turns. Jack is there. In one fantastically romantic move,

text: that makes passersby stop and stare.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT (ON P.A.)
scene_heading: FINAL BOARDING CALL FOR FLIGHT 673
text: TO NEW YORK JFK AT GATE 43.
text: Jack looks at Ali.

scene_heading: EXT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - LATE NIGHT
text: Sean's car whips into the parking lot. Ali jumps out and
text: heads for the front entrance. The CONSTRUCTION WORKERS from

text: her. She waves to them and nods: that's right, boys.
scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: Ali enters just as Tess, in a spotlight on stage, turns
text: toward the audience. She looks fabulous. Only someone who
text: knows her really well could tell she's dying inside.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Smoother than honey and twice as
dialog: sweet. Each girl lovelier then the
dialog: next. Gentlemen, hold onto your
dialog: hats. Ladies, hold on to your

scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
text: Tess is arriving in her office, defeated, as Ali bursts in
text: behind her.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Tess!
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: You could knock-- this is still my
dialog: office--at least for another 48
speaker_heading: HOURS--
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: But this is really, really --
text: Tess holds up a hand.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Not. Now.
speaker_heading: ALI
speaker_heading: BUT--
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: I said -- NOT --
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Yes now! God damn, you are one
dialog: stubborn mule of a woman. Anyone
dialog: else in their right mind would have
dialog: figured out by now, when I have
dialog: something to tell you, you listen!
dialog: I told you I could dance, did you
dialog: listen? No. Big mistake. I told
dialog: you I could sing, did you listen?
dialog: No. Big. mistake. This time you are
dialog: going to hear what I have to say if
dialog: I have to tie you up with your
text: corset strings and scream it in
dialog: your God damn ear.
text: For the first time someone silences Tess. Ali takes a breath.
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: Have you ever heard of air rights?
scene_heading: EXT. LOFT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY
text: TWO SETS OF FIERCE HEELS and LEGS stride in unison down a

scene_heading: INT. LOFT BUILDING - SALES OFFICE - DAY
text: A smartly-dressed BUSINESSMAN sits at his mahogany desk deep

speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Jim -- Jim -- hang on, I'm gonna
dialog: have to call you back -- Jim!
dialog: Damnit, Nancy, get him back.
text: Assistant scurries out. Businessman turns to Tess.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Back with more noise complaints?
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: You offered to buy my club a few
dialog: years back. I said no.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: And now you've changed your mind.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Not exactly.
text: Tess smiles at him. Looks at Ali, who's not smiling. She
text: elbows her. Ali starts smiling. Tess walks up to the desk and
text: sits herself down. Ali does the same.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: I'm confused.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Go with me, there's a good ending,
dialog: I promise. How much will these
dialog: condos you're building sell for?
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: They start at one million and go
dialog: up, depending on the view.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: What if I told you a twenty-story
dialog: high-rise was going up where my
dialog: club is?
speaker_heading: (TO ALI)
dialog: Would twenty stories block his
dialog: view?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 130.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Ten stories would. Twenty would
text: decimate them. Leaving behind a lot
text: of angry homeowners staring across
text: the street at fluorescent light
text: bulbs and dirty windows.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: So. Mr. ?
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: Anderson.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Mr. Anderson. Your pretty million-
dialog: dollar ocean views are going away
dialog: because I'm selling my building to
dialog: a developer tomorrow who'll have
text: his twenty stories all framed up by
dialog: the time you start selling --
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Trying to sell--
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Trying to sell these condos.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Or. I can put you in a position
dialog: where your buyers could be
dialog: guaranteed their million-dollar
dialog: views forever.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: I'm listening.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: As am I. As long as you're telling
dialog: me you'll have a check to me by
text: 5:00 today.
scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - EVENING
text: The BUMPER BAND PLAYS. Vince sits with his POSSE. His

text: She whispers to him:
scene_heading: COCKTAIL WAITRESS
dialog: Sorry, baby, they cut you off at
dialog: the bar. Said you have to pay cash.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: What? I co-own this goddamn place--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 131.
text: Tess comes up behind him.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Not anymore you don't. I'm buying
dialog: you out.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: You can't do that.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Actually, according to page 4 of
dialog: our contract, I can.
speaker_heading: VINCE
speaker_heading: (SCOFFING)
dialog: In the next 48 hours?
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Why postpone joy?
text: She hands him a CASHIER'S CHECK. Vince stares at it.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: What the hell is this?
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: I realize it's been a while since
dialog: you've seen one, but it's called a
dialog: check.
text: He stares at it, stunned.Then at her.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Where'd you get this?
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Not your business anymore. And
dialog: neither is the lounge.
speaker_heading: (POINTS)
dialog: I'm sure you know where the door
dialog: is. It used to be half yours.
dialog: (re. the waitress)
dialog: And take HER with you.
text: Tess turns and goes over to the bar, where Ali spins around
text: on her barstool, having heard the whole thing.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: How'd that feel?
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Not half bad.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 132.
text: Tess parks it next to her. Looks at Ali. Smiles, then breaks
text: into a giggle. Ali smiles. Tess laughs even harder, tears in
text: her eyes now. They are just two girls laughing hysterically
text: at the bar, Tess keeps trying to say something, but can't get
text: it out, until she looks Ali square in the eye...
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: It felt pretty God damn awesome!
text: And they crack up again. Then...
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: And to think, you didn't even want
dialog: me around.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Oh, Jesus, here it comes.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: .What was it you said to me that
dialog: first night? "Twenty bucks at the
dialog: door will make all your dreams come
dialog: true." That was sweet of you.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Are you finished?
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: (loving needling her)
dialog: Kinda ironic, when you think about
dialog: it. I started off begging you to
dialog: make my dreams come true, and here
dialog: we are --
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: All right already! You want me to
dialog: say it, I'll say it.
text: She looks at her.
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: This place is the love of my life.
dialog: The only dream I've ever had. I
dialog: don't know what I would have done
dialog: if I had lost it.
speaker_heading: (HEARTFELT NOW)
dialog: Thank you.
text: A moment between them... as Tess SPOTS NIKKI ENTER the club
text: carrying her dance bag--a little fresher than we've seen her
text: before, and sober. Nikki looks over at Tess... then
text: approaches. Ali turns away on her bar stool, respectfully.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 133.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
speaker_heading: (SHEEPISH)
dialog: I crossed the line.

speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Again.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Again, and I wanna come home--
speaker_heading: TESS
speaker_heading: AGAIN--
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Yes, again! Did you fill my spot or
dialog: what...?
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: What do you think?
text: Tess and Nikki share a look.
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
text: Curtain's up in 20. Shake a leg.
text: Nikki smiles, hikes her dance bag over her shoulder and heads
speaker_heading: BACKSTAGE--
text: Ali looks at Tess quizzically--
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Just like that?
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: If I had a dollar for every time
dialog: she's quit...
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: We all fight. Bitch. Love and hate.
dialog: And then make up. Just like
dialog: sisters.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: I never had a sister.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Me neither. THANK GOD.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 134.
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Now get your cute little ass and
dialog: big ole' voice up on stage, cause
text: this is Burlesque, baby girl, where
dialog: the women are always on top, and
dialog: the men like it that way. Like I've
dialog: always said --
speaker_heading: ALI/TESS
dialog: You can't keep a good girl down.
scene_heading: BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM
text: Ali walks into the dressing room. Sits down in front of her
text: mirror. Across the room, Nikki is sitting at hers. Ali looks
text: at Nikki in the reflection of her mirror. Their eyes meet.
text: Then Nikki nods. And Ali nods back. For the first time, a
dialog: mutual respect.
text: All the other girls begin to pour into the dressing room.
text: Chatting, gossiping, changing their clothes. The legs, boobs,
dialog: fishnets, etc. Things back the way there were, and the way
dialog: they'll always be.
text: ON ALI. She looks at herself in the mirror. Picks up the make-
text: up brush Tess gave her. Dips it in water. Then applies a line
text: on her eye expertly. She smiles to herself. MUSIC UP: A heavy
text: bass drumlin beat which takes us to...
scene_heading: INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT - CARRY MUSIC
text: A SPOTLIGHT. MOVING down the smoke-filled shaft of light as--
text: A FIGURE RISES into view at the back of the stage. Over the
dialog: contemporary BEAT, we HEAR a beautiful classic opera
text: (Carmen?) REVEAL...it's NIKKI! She sings a line or two in an
dialog: amazing operatic voice that totally blows us away. Then ...a
text: DANCE BEAT KICKS IN as COCO comes into view, and sings
text: another line. Then Jessie. Then Scarlett. And FINALLY...
text: Ali RISES into view, wearing a diamond studded Gaultier-type
dialog: harness top and sequined hot-pants. This song (to be written)
text: is a contemporary dance song about BURLESQUE with a vintage
text: feel to it. Nikki and the Burlesque Girls, in similar
text: costumes, back Ali as she SINGS her big finale. CAMERA MOVES
text: through the packed house as we SEE Georgia, Sean, Mark (the
text: DJ) and Tess, who double-takes at MR. ANDERSON (the
text: Businessman) who sees her and smiles.
text: ON STAGE, ALI and the entire company explode in a surreal
text: whirl of dancing. Turning. Kicking. Arched backs. Legs

dialog: 
dialog: 135.
text: CAMERA MOVES INTO THE CLUB as music CROSSFADES with the
