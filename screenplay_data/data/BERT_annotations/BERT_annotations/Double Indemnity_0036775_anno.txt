speaker_heading: SEQUENCE "A"
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: A-1 LOS ANGELES - A DOWNTOWN INTERSECTION
text: It is night, about two o'clock, very light traffic.
text: At the left and in the immediate foreground a semaphore
text: traffic signal stands at GO. Approaching it at about thirty
text: miles per hour is a Dodge 1938 coupe. It is driven erratically
text: and weaving a little, but not out of control.
text: When the car is about forty feet away, the signal changes to
text: STOP. Car makes no attempt to stop but comes on through.
scene_heading: A-2 A LIGHT NEWSPAPER TRUCK
text: is crossing the intersection at right angles. It swerves and
text: skids to avoid the Dodge, which goes on as though nothing
text: had happened. The truck stops with a panicky screech of tires.
text: There is a large sign on the truck: "READ THE LOS ANGELES
text: TIMES". The truck driver's infuriated face stares after the
dialog: coupe.
speaker_heading: A-3 THE COUPE
text: continues along the street, still weaving, then slows down
text: and pulls over towards the curb in front of a tall office
dialog: building.
speaker_heading: A-4 THE COUPE
text: stops. The headlights are turned off. For a second nothing
text: happens, then the car door opens slowly. A man eases himself
text: out onto the sidewalk and stands a moment leaning on the
text: open door to support himself. He's a tall man, about thirty-
text: five years old. From the way he moves there seems to be
text: something wrong with his left shoulder.
text: He straightens up and painfully lowers his left hand into
text: his jacket pocket. He leans into the car. He brings out a
text: light-weight overcoat and drapes it across his shoulders. He
text: shuts the car door and walks toward the building.
scene_heading: A-5 ENTRANCE OF THE BUILDING
text: Above the closed, double-plate glass doors is lettered:
text: "PACIFIC BUILDING". To the left of entrance there is a
text: drugstore, closed, dark except for a faint light in the back.
text: The man comes stiffly up to the doors. (CAMERA HAS MOVED UP
text: WITH HIM). He tries the doors. They are locked. He knocks on
text: the glass. Inside, over his shoulder, the lobby of the
text: building is visible: a side entrance to the drugstore on the
text: left, in the rear a barber shop and cigar and magazine stand
text: closed up for the night, and to the right two elevators. One
text: elevator is open and its dome light falls across the dark
dialog: lobby.
text: The man knocks again. The night watchman sticks his head out
text: of the elevator and looks toward entrance. He comes out with
text: a newspaper in one hand and a half-eaten sandwich in the
text: other. He finishes the sandwich on the way to the doors,
text: looks out and recognizes the man outside, unlocks the door
text: and pulls it open.
speaker_heading: NIGHT WATCHMAN
dialog: Hello there, Mr. Neff.
text: Neff walks in past him without answering.
scene_heading: A-6 INT. LOBBY
text: Neff is walking towards elevator. Night watchman looks after
text: him, relocks door, follows to elevator. Neff enters elevator.
speaker_heading: A-7 ELEVATOR
text: Neff stands leaning against wall. He is pale and haggard
text: with pain, but deadpans as night watchman joins him.
speaker_heading: NIGHT WATCHMAN
dialog: Working pretty late aren't you, Mr.
dialog: Neff?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: (Tight-lipped)
dialog: Late enough.
speaker_heading: NIGHT WATCHMAN
dialog: You look kind of all in at that.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I'm fine. Let's ride.
text: Night watchman pulls lever, doors close and elevator rises.
speaker_heading: NIGHT WATCHMAN
dialog: How's the insurance business, Mr.
dialog: Neff?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: NIGHT WATCHMAN
dialog: They wouldn't ever sell me any. They
dialog: say I've got something loose in my
dialog: heart. I say it's rheumatism.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: (Scarcely listening)
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: Night watchman looks around at him, turns away again and the
text: elevator stops.
speaker_heading: NIGHT WATCHMAN
dialog: (Surly)
dialog: Twelve.
text: The door opens. Across a small dark reception room a pair of
scene_heading: frosted glass doors are lettered: PACIFIC ALL-RISK INSURANCE
scene_heading: COMPANY - FOUNDED 1906 - MAIN OFFICE. There is a little light
text: beyond the glass doors.
text: Neff straightens up and walks heavily out of the elevator,
text: across reception room to doors. He pushes them open. The
text: night watchman stares after him morosely, works lever,
text: elevator doors start to close.
scene_heading: A-8 TWELFTH FLOOR INSURANCE OFFICE
dialog: (Note for set-designer: Our Insurance Company occupies the
text: entire eleventh and twelfth floors of the building. On the
dialog: twelfth floor are the executive offices and claims and sales
text: departments. These all open off a balcony which runs all the
text: way around. From the balcony you see the eleventh floor below:
text: one enormous room filled with desks, typewriters, filing
dialog: cabinets, business machines, etc.)
text: Neff comes through the double entrance doors from the
text: reception room. The twelfth floor is dark. Some light shines
text: up from the eleventh floor. Neff takes a few steps then holds
text: on to the balcony railing and looks down.
scene_heading: A-9 THE ELEVENTH FLOOR FROM ABOVE - NEFF'S POINT OF VIEW
text: Two colored women are cleaning the offices. One is dry-mopping
text: the floor, the other is moving chairs back into position,
text: etc. A colored man is emptying waste baskets into a big square
text: box. He shuffles a little dance step as he moves, and hums a
dialog: little tune.
speaker_heading: A-10 NEFF
text: Moves away from the railing with a faint smile on his face,
text: and walks past two or three offices (CAMERA WITH HIM) towards
text: a glass door with number twenty-seven on it and three names:
scene_heading: HENRY B. ANDERSON, WALTER NEFF, LOUIS L. SCHWARTZ. Neff opens
dialog: the door.
scene_heading: A-11 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE - DARK
text: Three desks, filing cabinets, one typewriter on stand, one
text: dictaphone on fixed stand against wall with rack of records
text: underneath, telephones on all three desks. Water cooler with
text: inverted bottle and paper cup holder beside it. Two windows
text: facing toward front of building. Venetian blinds. No curtains.
text: Waste basket full, ash trays not emptied. The office has not
dialog: been cleaned.
text: Neff enters, switches on desk lamp. He looks across at dicta
text: phone, goes heavily to it and lifts off the fabric cover. He
text: leans down hard on the dictaphone stand as if feeling faint.
text: He turns away from dictaphone, takes a few uncertain steps
text: and falls heavily into a swivel chair. His head goes far
text: back, his eyes close, cold sweat shows on his face. For a
text: moment he stays like this, exhausted, then his eyes open
text: slowly and look down at his left shoulder. His good hand
text: flips the overcoat back, he unbuttons his jacket, loosens
text: his tie and shirt. This was quite an effort. He rests for a
text: second, breathing hard. With the help of his good hand he
text: edges his left elbow up on the arm-rest of the chair, supports
text: it there and then pulls his jacket wide. A heavy patch of
text: dark blood shows on his shirt. He pushes his chair along the
text: floor towards the water cooler, using his feet and his right
text: hand against the desk, takes out a handkerchief, presses
text: with his hand against the spring faucet of the cooler, soaks
text: the handkerchief in water and tucks it, dripping wet, against
text: the wound inside his shirt. Next, he gets a handful of water
text: and splashes it on his face. The water runs down his chin
text: and drips. He breathes heavily, with closed eyes. He fingers
text: a pack of cigarettes in his shirt pocket, pulls it out, looks
text: at it. There is blood on it. He wheels himself back to the
text: desk and dumps the loose cigarettes out of the packet. Some
text: are blood-stained, a few are clean. He takes one, puts it
text: between his lips, gropes around for a match, lights cigarette.
text: He takes a deep drag and lets smoke out through his nose.
text: He pulls himself toward dictaphone again, still in the swivel
text: chair, reaches it, lifts the horn off the bracket and the
text: dictaphone makes a low buzzing sound. He presses the button
text: switch on the horn. The sound stops, the record revolves on
text: the cylinder. He begins to speak:
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Office memorandum, Walter Neff to
dialog: Barton Keyes, Claims Manager. Los
dialog: Angeles, July 16th, 1938. Dear Keyes:
dialog: I suppose you'll call this a
dialog: confession when you hear it. I don't
dialog: like the word confession. I just
dialog: want to set you right about one thing
dialog: you couldn't see, because it was
dialog: smack up against your nose. You think
dialog: you're such a hot potato as a claims
dialog: manager, such a wolf on a phoney
dialog: claim. Well, maybe you are, Keyes,
dialog: but let's take a look at this
dialog: Dietrichson claim, Accident and Double
dialog: Indemnity. You were pretty good in
dialog: there for a while, all right. You
dialog: said it wasn't an accident. Check.
dialog: You said it wasn't suicide. Check.
dialog: You said it was murder. Check and
dialog: double check. You thought you had it
text: cold, all wrapped up in tissue paper,
text: with pink ribbons around it. It was
dialog: perfect, except that it wasn't,
dialog: because you made a mistake, just one
dialog: tiny little mistake. When it came to
dialog: picking the killer, you picked the
dialog: wrong guy, if you know what I mean.
dialog: Want to know who killed Dietrichson?
dialog: Hold tight to that cheap cigar of
dialog: yours, Keyes. I killed Dietrichson.
dialog: Me, Walter Neff, insurance agent, 35
dialog: years old, unmarried, no visible
dialog: scars --
text: (He glances down at
dialog: his wounded shoulder)
dialog: Until a little while ago, that is.
dialog: Yes, I killed him. I killed him for
dialog: money -- and a woman -- and I didn't
dialog: get the money and I didn't get the
dialog: woman. Pretty, isn't it?
text: He interrupts the dictation, lays down the horn on the desk.
text: He takes his lighted cigarette from the ash tray, puffs it
text: two or three times, and kills it. He picks up the horn again.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: (His voice is now
dialog: quiet and contained)
dialog: It began last May. About the end of
dialog: May, it was. I had to run out to
dialog: Glendale to deliver a policy on some
dialog: dairy trucks. On the way back I
dialog: remembered this auto renewal on Los
dialog: Feliz. So I decided to run over there.
dialog: It was one of those Calif. Spanish
dialog: houses everyone was nuts about 10 or
dialog: 15 years ago. This one must have
dialog: cost somebody about 30,000 bucks --
dialog: that is, if he ever finished paying
dialog: for it.
text: As he goes on speaking, SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: A-12 DIETRICHSON HOME - LOS FELIZ DISTRICT
text: Palm trees line the street, middle-class houses, mostly in
text: Spanish style. Some kids throwing a baseball back and forth
text: across a couple of front lawns. An ice cream wagon dawdles
text: along the block. Neff's coupe meets and passes the ice cream
text: wagon and stops before one of the Spanish houses. Neff gets
text: out. He carries a briefcase, his hat is a little on the back
text: of his head. His movements are easy and full of ginger. He
text: inspects the house, checks the number, goes up on the front
text: porch and rings the bell.
speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE
dialog: It was mid-afternoon, and it's funny,
dialog: I can still remember the smell of
dialog: honeysuckle all along that block. I
dialog: felt like a million. There was no
dialog: way in all this world I could have
dialog: known that murder sometimes can smell
dialog: like honeysuckle...
scene_heading: A-13 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOME - ENTRANCE DOOR
text: Neff rings the bell again and waits. The door opens. A maid,
text: about forty-five, rather slatternly, opens the door.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Mr. Dietrichson in?
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Who wants to see him?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: The name is Neff. Walter Neff.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: If you're selling something --
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Look, it's Mr. Dietrichson I'd like
dialog: to talk to, and it's not magazine
dialog: subscriptions.
text: He pushes past her into the house.
scene_heading: A-14 HALLWAY - DIETRICHSON HOME
text: Spanish craperoo in style, as is the house throughout. A
text: wrought-iron staircase curves down from the second floor. A
text: fringed Mexican shawl hangs down over the landing. A large
text: tapestry hangs on the wall. Downstairs, the dining room to
text: one side, living room on the other side visible through a
text: wide archway. All of this, architecture, furniture,
text: decorations, etc., is genuine early Leo Carrillo period.
text: Neff has edged his way in past maid who still holds the door
dialog: open.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Listen, Mr. Dietrichson's not in.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: How soon do you expect him?
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: He'll be home when he gets here, if
dialog: that's any help to you.
text: At this point a voice comes from the top of the stairs.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What is it, Nettie? Who is it?
text: Neff looks up.
scene_heading: A-15 UPPER LANDING OF STAIRCASE - (FROM BELOW)
text: Phyllis Dietrichson stands looking down. She is in her early
text: thirties. She holds a large bath-towel around her very
text: appetizing torso, down to about two inches above her knees.
text: She wears no stockings, no nothing. On her feet a pair of
text: high-heeled bedroom slippers with pom-poms. On her left ankle
text: a gold anklet.
speaker_heading: MAID'S VOICE
dialog: It's for Mr. Dietrichson.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: (Looking down at Neff)
dialog: I'm Mrs. Dietrichson. What is it?
text: A-16 SHOOTING DOWN FROM UPPER LANDING
text: Neff looks up, takes his hat off.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: How do you do, Mrs. Dietrichson. I'm
dialog: Walter Neff, Pacific All-Risk.
speaker_heading: A-17 PHYLLIS
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Pacific all-what?
speaker_heading: A-18 NEFF
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Pacific All-Risk Insurance Company.
dialog: It's about some renewals on the
dialog: automobiles, Mrs. Dietrichson. I've
dialog: been trying to contact your husband
dialog: for the past two weeks. He's never
text: at his office.
speaker_heading: A-19 PHYLLIS
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Is there anything I can do?
speaker_heading: A-20 NEFF
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: The insurance ran out on the
dialog: fifteenth. I'd hate to think of your
dialog: getting a smashed fender or something
dialog: while you're not fully covered.
speaker_heading: A-21 PHYLLIS
text: She glances over her towel costume.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: (With a little smile)
dialog: Perhaps I know what you mean, Mr.
dialog: Neff. I've just been taking a sun
dialog: bath.
speaker_heading: A-22 NEFF
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: No pigeons around, I hope... About
dialog: those policies, Mrs. Dietrichson --
dialog: I hate to take up your time --
speaker_heading: A-23 PHYLLIS
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: That's all right. If you can wait
dialog: till I put something on, I'll be
dialog: right down. Nettie, show Mr. Neff
text: into the living room.
text: She turns away as gracefully as one can with a towel for a
dialog: wrapper.]
scene_heading: A-24 ENTRANCE HALL
text: Neff watches Phyllis out of sight. He speaks to the maid
text: while still looking up.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Where would the living room be?
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: In there, but they keep the liquor
dialog: locked up.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: That's okay. I always carry my own
dialog: keys.
text: He goes through the archway. Maid goes off the other way.
speaker_heading: A-25 LIVING ROOM
text: Neff comes into the room and throws his briefcase on the
text: plush davenport and tosses his hat on top of it. He looks
text: around the room, then moves over to a baby grand piano with
text: a sleazy Spanish shawl dangling down one side and two cabinet
text: photographs standing in a staggered position on top. Neff
text: glances them over: Mr. Dietrichson, age about fifty-one, a
text: big, blocky man with glasses and a Rotarian look about him;
text: Lola Dietrichson, age nineteen, wearing a filmy party dress
text: and a yearning look in her pretty eyes. Neff walks away from
text: the piano and takes a few steps back and forth across the
text: rug. His eyes fall on a wrinkled corner. He carefully
text: straightens it out with his foot. His back is to the archway
text: as he hears high heels clicking on the staircase. He turns
text: and looks through the arch.
speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE
text: The living room was still stuffy
text: from last night's cigars. The windows
dialog: were closed and the sunshine coming
text: in through the Venetian blinds showed
text: up the dust in the air. The furniture
dialog: was kind of corny and old-fashioned,
dialog: but it had a comfortable look, as if
text: people really sat in it. On the piano,
dialog: in couple of fancy frames, were Mr.
dialog: Dietrichson and Lola, his daughter
dialog: by his first wife They had a bowl of
dialog: those little red goldfish on the
text: table behind the davenport, but, to
dialog: tell you the truth, Keyes, I wasn't
dialog: a whole lot interested in goldfish
dialog: right then, nor in auto renewals,
dialog: nor in Mr. Dietrichson and his
dialog: daughter Lola. I was thinking about
dialog: that dame upstairs, and the way she
dialog: had looked at me, and I wanted to
dialog: see her again, close, without that
dialog: silly staircase between us.
scene_heading: A-26 STAIRCASE (FROM NEFF'S POINT OF VIEW)
text: Phyllis Dietrichson is coming downstairs. First we see her
text: feet, with pom-pom slippers and the gold anklet on her left
text: ankle. CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY as she descends, until we
text: see all of her. She is wearing a pale blue summer dress.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS' VOICE
dialog: I wasn't long, was I?
speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE
dialog: Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson.
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK WITH HER INTO THE LIVING ROOM.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I hope I've got my face on straight.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: It's perfect for my money.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: (Crossing to the mirror
dialog: over the fireplace)
dialog: Won't you sit down, Mr. -- Neff is
dialog: the name, isn't it?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: With two f's, like in Philadelphia.
dialog: If you know the story.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: What story?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: The Philadelphia story. What are we
dialog: talking about?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: (She works with her
dialog: lipstick)
dialog: About the insurance. My husband never
dialog: tells me anything.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: It's on your two cars, the La Salle
dialog: and the Plymouth.
text: He crosses to the davenport to get the policies from his
text: briefcase. She turns away from the mirror and sits in a big
text: chair with her legs drawn up sideways, the anklet now clearly
dialog: visible.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: We've been handling this insurance
dialog: for three years for Mr. Dietrichson...
dialog: (His eyes have caught
dialog: the anklet)
dialog: That's a honey of an anklet you're
dialog: wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.
text: Phyllis smiles faintly and covers the anklet with her dress.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: We'd hate to see the policies lapse.
dialog: Of course, we give him thirty days.
dialog: That's all we're allowed to give.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I guess he's been too busy down at
text: Long Beach in the oil fields.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Could I catch him home some evening
dialog: for a few minutes?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I suppose so. But he's never home
dialog: much before eight.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: That would be fine with me.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: You're not connected with the
dialog: Automobile Club, are you?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: No, the All-Risk, Mrs. Dietrichson.
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Somebody from the Automobile Club
dialog: has been trying to get him. Do they
dialog: have a better rate?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: If your husband's a member.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: No, he isn't.
text: Phyllis rises and walks up and down, paying less and less
dialog: attention.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Well, he'd have to join the club and
dialog: pay a membership fee to start with.
dialog: The Automobile Club is fine. I never
dialog: knock the other fellow's merchandise,
dialog: Mrs. Dietrichson, but I can do just
dialog: as well for you. I have a very
dialog: attractive policy here. It wouldn't
dialog: take me two minutes to put it in
dialog: front of your husband.
text: He consults the policies he is holding.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: For instance, we're writing a new
dialog: kind of fifty percent retention
text: feature in the collision coverage.
text: Phyllis stops in her walk.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: You're a smart insurance man, aren't
dialog: you, Mr. Neff?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I've had eleven years of it.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Doing pretty well?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: It's a living.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: You handle just automobile insurance,
dialog: or all kinds?
text: She sits down again, in the same position as before.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: All kinds. Fire, earthquake, theft,
dialog: public liability, group insurance,
dialog: industrial stuff and so on right
text: down the line.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Accident insurance?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Accident insurance? Sure, Mrs.
dialog: Dietrichson.
text: His eyes fall on the anklet again.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I wish you'd tell me what's engraved
dialog: on that anklet.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Just my name.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: As for instance?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Phyllis.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Phyllis. I think I like that.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: But you're not sure?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I'd have to drive it around the block
dialog: a couple of times.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: (Standing up again)
dialog: Mr. Neff, why don't you drop by
text: tomorrow evening about eight-thirty.
dialog: He'll be in then.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: My husband. You were anxious to talk
dialog: to him weren't you?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Sure, only I'm getting over it a
dialog: little. If you know what I mean.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: There's a speed limit in this state,
text: Mr. Neff. Forty-five miles an hour.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: How fast was I going, officer?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I'd say about ninety.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Suppose you get down off your
dialog: motorcycle and give me a ticket.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Suppose I let you off with a warning
dialog: this time.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Suppose it doesn't take.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Suppose I have to whack you over the
dialog: knuckles.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Suppose I bust out crying and put my
dialog: head on your shoulder.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Suppose you try putting it on my
text: husband's shoulder.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: That tears it.
text: Neff takes his hat and briefcase.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Eight-thirty tomorrow evening then,
dialog: Mrs. Dietrichson.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: That's what I suggested.
text: They both move toward the archway.
scene_heading: A-27 HALLWAY - PHYLLIS AND NEFF GOING TOWARDS THE ENTRANCE
speaker_heading: DOOR
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Will you be here, too?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I guess so. I usually am.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Same chair, same perfume, same anklet?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: (Opening the door)
dialog: I wonder if I know what you mean.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I wonder if you wonder.
text: He walks out.
scene_heading: A-28 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOME - (DAY)
text: Shooting past Neff's parked car towards the entrance door,
text: which is just closing. Neff comes towards the car, swinging
text: his briefcase. He opens the car door and looks back with a
text: confident smile.
speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE
dialog: (Over scene)
dialog: She liked me. I could feel that. The
dialog: way you feel when the cards are...
scene_heading: A-29 ENTRANCE DOOR, DIETRICHSON HOME
text: In the upper panel the peep window opens and Phyllis looks
text: out after Neff.
speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE
dialog: falling right for you, with a nice
text: little pile of blue and yellow chips
text: in the middle of the table. Only
dialog: what I didn't know then was that I
text: wasn't playing her. She was playing
dialog: me -- with a deck of marked cards --
dialog: and the stakes weren't any blue and
dialog: yellow chips. They were dynamite. I
dialog: went back to the office that afternoon
dialog: to see if I had any mail. It was the
dialog: same afternoon you had that Sam
dialog: Gorlopis on the carpet, that truck
dialog: driver from Inglewood, remember,
dialog: Keyes?
speaker_heading: A-30 NEFF
text: He sits in his car, presses the starter button, looking back
text: towards the little window in the entrance door.
speaker_heading: A-31 ENTRANCE DOOR
text: The peep window is quickly closed from inside.
speaker_heading: A-32 STREET
text: Neff makes a U-turn and drives back down the block.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: A-33 LONG SHOT - INSURANCE OFFICE - TWELFTH FLOOR - (DAY) -
speaker_heading: CAMERA HIGH
text: Activity on the eleventh floor below. Typewriters working,
text: adding machines, filing clerks, secretaries, and so forth.
text: Neff, wearing his hat and carrying his briefcase, enters
text: from the vestibule. He walks towards his office. He passes a
text: few salesmen, etc. There is an exchange of greetings. Just
text: as he reaches his office a secretary comes out. She stops.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Oh, Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes wants to see
dialog: you. He's been yelling for you all
dialog: afternoon.
speaker_heading: NEFF
text: Is he sore, or just frothing at the
dialog: mouth a little? Here, park these for
dialog: me, sweetheart.
text: He hands her his hat and briefcase and continues right on,
text: CAMERA WITH HIM, to a door lettered:
scene_heading: BARTON KEYES - CLAIMS MANAGER
text: Keyes' voice is heard inside, plenty loud. Neff grins as he
text: opens the door and goes in.
scene_heading: A-34 KEYES: OFFICE - (DAY)
text: A minor executive office, not too tidy: large desk across
text: one corner, good carpet, several chairs, filing cabinet

text: Keyes is sitting behind the desk with his coat off but his
text: hat on. A cigar is clamped in his mouth, ashes falling like
text: snow down his vest, a gold chair and elk's tooth across it.
text: On the other side of the desk sits Sam Gorlopis. He is a
text: big, dumb bruiser, six feet three inches tall -- a dirty
text: work shirt and corduroy pants, rough, untidy hair, broad
text: face, small piggish eyes. He holds a sweat-soaked hat on his
text: knee with a hairy hand. He is chewing gum rapidly. As Neff
text: opens the door, Keyes is giving it to Gorlopis.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Wise up, Gorlopis. You're not kidding
dialog: anybody with that line of bull. You're
dialog: in a jam and you know it.
speaker_heading: GORLOPIS
dialog: Sez you. All I want is my money.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Sez you. All you're gonna get is the
dialog: cops.
text: He sees Neff standing inside the door.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Come in, Walter. This is Sam Gorlopis
dialog: from Inglewood.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Sure, I know Mr. Gorlopis. Wrote a
dialog: policy on his truck. How are you,
dialog: Mr. Gorlopis?
speaker_heading: GORLOPIS
dialog: I ain't so good. My truck burned
dialog: down.
text: He looks cautiously sideways at Keyes.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Yeah, he just planted his big foot
dialog: on the starter and the whole thing
text: blazed up in his face.
speaker_heading: GORLOPIS
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: KEYES
text: And didn't even singe his eyebrows.
speaker_heading: GORLOPIS
dialog: No sir. Look, mister. I got twenty-
dialog: six hundred bucks tied up in that
dialog: truck. I'm insured with this company
dialog: and I want my money.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: You got a wife, Gorlopis?
speaker_heading: GORLOPIS
dialog: Sure I got a wife.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: You got kids?
speaker_heading: GORLOPIS
dialog: Two kids.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: What you got for dinner tonight?
speaker_heading: GORLOPIS
dialog: We got meat loaf.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: How do you make your meat loaf,
dialog: Gorlopis?
speaker_heading: GORLOPIS
text: Veal and pork and bread and garlic.
dialog: Greek style.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: How much garlic?
speaker_heading: GORLOPIS
dialog: Lotsa garlic, Mr. Keyes.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Okay, Gorlopis. Now listen here.
dialog: Let's say you just came up here to
dialog: tell me how to make meat loaf. That's
dialog: all, understand? Because if you came
dialog: up here to claim on that truck, I'd
dialog: have to turn you over to the law,
dialog: Gorlopis, and they'd put you in jail.
dialog: No wife. No kids --
speaker_heading: GORLOPIS
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: (Yelling)
dialog: And no meat loaf, Gorlopis!
speaker_heading: GORLOPIS
dialog: I didn't do nothin'.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: No? Look, Gorlopis. Every month
dialog: hundreds of claims come to this desk.
dialog: Some of them are phonies, and I know
dialog: which ones. How do I know, Gorlopis?
text: (He speaks as if to a
dialog: child)
dialog: Because my little man tells me.
speaker_heading: GORLOPIS
dialog: What little man?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: The little man in here.
text: He pounds the pit of his stomach.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Every time one of those phonies comes
text: along he ties knots in my stomach.
dialog: And yours was one of them, Gorlopis.
dialog: That's how I knew your claim was
dialog: crooked. So what did I do? I sent a
dialog: tow car out to your garage this
dialog: afternoon and they jacked up that
dialog: burned-out truck of yours. And what
dialog: did they find, Gorlopis? They found
text: what was left of a pile of shavings.
speaker_heading: GORLOPIS
dialog: What shavings?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: The ones you soaked with kerosene
text: and dropped a match on.
text: Gorlopis cringes under the impact.
speaker_heading: GORLOPIS
dialog: Look, Mr. Keyes, I'm just a poor
dialog: guy. Maybe I made a mistake.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: That's one way of putting it.
speaker_heading: GORLOPIS
dialog: I ain't feelin' so good, Mr. Keyes.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Sign this and you'll feel fine.
text: He puts a blank form in front of him and points.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Right there. It's a waiver on your
dialog: claim.
text: Gorlopis hesitates, then signs laboriously.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Now you're an honest man again.
speaker_heading: GORLOPIS
dialog: But I ain't got no more truck.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Goodbye, Gorlopis.
speaker_heading: GORLOPIS
dialog: (Still bewildered)
dialog: Goodbye, Mr. Keyes.
text: He stands up and goes slowly to the door and turns there.
speaker_heading: GORLOPIS
dialog: Twenty-six hundred bucks. That's a
dialog: lot of dough where I live.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: What's the matter, Gorlopis? Don't
dialog: you know how to open the door? Just
dialog: put your hand on the knob, turn it
dialog: to the right, pull it toward you --
speaker_heading: GORLOPIS
dialog: (Doing just as Keyes
dialog: says)
dialog: Like this, Mr. Keyes?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: That's the boy. Now the same thing
text: from the outside.
speaker_heading: GORLOPIS
dialog: (Stupefied)
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Keyes.
text: He goes out, closing the door after him. Keyes takes his
text: cigar stub from his mouth and turns it slowly in the flame
text: of a lighted match. He turns to Neff.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: What kind of an outfit is this anyway?
dialog: Are we an insurance company, or a
dialog: bunch of dimwitted amateurs, writing
dialog: a policy on a mugg like that?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Wait a minute, Keyes. I don't rate
dialog: this beef. I clipped a note to that
dialog: Gorlopis application to have him
dialog: thoroughly investigated before we
dialog: accepted the risk.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: I know you did, Walter. I'm not
dialog: beefing at you. It's the company.
dialog: The way they do things. The way they
dialog: don't do things. The way they'll
dialog: write anything just to get it down
dialog: on the sales sheet. And I'm the guy
dialog: that has to sit here up to my neck
dialog: in phony claims so they won't throw
dialog: more money out of the window than
text: they take in at the door.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: (Grinning)
dialog: Okay, turn the record over and let's
dialog: hear the other side.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: I get darn sick of picking up after
text: a gang of fast-talking salesmen dumb
dialog: enough to sell life insurance to a
text: guy that sleeps in the same bed with
dialog: four rattlesnakes. I've had twenty-
dialog: six years of that, Walter, and I --
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: And you loved every minute of it,
dialog: Keyes. You love it, only you worry
dialog: about it too much, you and your little
dialog: man. You're so darn conscientious
dialog: you're driving yourself crazy. You
dialog: wouldn't even say today is Tuesday
dialog: without you looked at the calendar,
dialog: and then you would check if it was
dialog: this year's or last year's calendar,
dialog: and then you would find out what
dialog: company printed the calendar, then
dialog: find out if their calendar checks
text: with the World Almanac's calendar.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: That's enough from you, Walter. Get
dialog: out of here before I throw my desk
dialog: at you.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I love you, too.

dialog: the cigar ashes on your vest I kind
dialog: of knew you had a heart as big as a
dialog: house... Back in my office there was
dialog: a phone message from Mrs. Dietrichson
dialog: about the renewals. She didn't want
dialog: me to come tomorrow evening. She
dialog: wanted me to come Thursday afternoon
dialog: at three-thirty instead. I had a lot
dialog: of stuff lined up for that Thursday
dialog: afternoon, including a trip down to
dialog: Santa Monica to see a couple of live
dialog: prospects about some group insurance.
dialog: But I kept thinking about Phyllis

scene_heading: A-36 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE
text: Anderson, a salesman, sits at one of the desks, filling out

text: PANS ON. Phyllis has reached the entrance hall, and as she
text: walks toward the front door her whole body becomes visible.
text: She wears a gay print dress with a wide sash over her hips.
text: She opens the door. Outside is Neff, wearing a sport coat,
text: flannel slacks. He takes his hat off.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Hello, Mr. Neff.
text: He stands there with a little smile.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Aren't you coming in?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I'm considering it.
text: He comes in.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I hope you didn't mind my changing
dialog: the appointment. Last night wasn't
dialog: so convenient.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: That's okay. I was working on my
dialog: stamp collection.
text: She leads him toward living room.
scene_heading: A-39 DIETRICHSON LIVING ROOM

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I was just fixing some iced tea.
dialog: Would you like a glass?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Unless you have a bottle of beer
dialog: that's not working.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: There might be some. I never know
text: what's in the ice box.
dialog: (Calls)
dialog: Nettie!...
text: She pours herself a glass of tea.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: About those renewals, Mr. Neff. I
dialog: talked to my husband about it.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: You did?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Yes. He'll renew with you he told
dialog: me. In fact, I thought he'd be here
dialog: this afternoon.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: But he's not?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: That's terrible.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: (Calls again,
dialog: impatiently)
dialog: Nettie!... Nettie!... Oh, I forgot,
dialog: it's the maid's day off.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Don't bother, Mrs. Dietrichson. I'd
dialog: like some iced tea very much.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Lemon? Sugar?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Fix it your way.
text: She fixes him a glass of tea while he is looking around. He
text: slowly sits down.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Seeing it's the maid's day off maybe
dialog: there's something I can do for you.
text: She hands him the tea.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Like running the vacuum cleaner.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Fresh.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I used to peddle vacuum cleaners.
dialog: Not much money but you learn a lot
dialog: about life.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I didn't think you'd learned it from
dialog: a correspondence course.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Where did you pick up this tea
dialog: drinking? You're not English, are
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: No. Californian. Born right here in
dialog: Los Angeles.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: They say native Californians all
dialog: come from Iowa.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I wanted to ask you something, Mr.
dialog: Neff.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Make it Walter.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Walter.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Tell me, Walter, on this insurance --
dialog: how much commission do you make?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Twenty percent. Why?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I thought maybe I could throw a little
dialog: more business your way.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I can always use it.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I was thinking about my husband. I
dialog: worry a lot about him, down in those
dialog: oil fields. It's very dangerous.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Not for an executive, is it?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
text: He doesn't just sit behind a desk.
dialog: He's right down there with the
dialog: drilling crews. It's got me worried
dialog: sick.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: You mean a crown block might fall on
dialog: him some rainy night?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Please don't talk like that.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: But that's the idea.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
text: The other day a casing line snapped
dialog: and caught the foreman. He's in the
text: hospital with a broken back.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Bad.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: It's got me jittery just thinking
dialog: about it. Suppose something like
dialog: that happened to my husband?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: It could.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Don't you think he ought to have
dialog: accident insurance?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: What kind of insurance could he have?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Enough to cover doctors' and hospital
dialog: bills. Say a hundred and twenty-five
dialog: a week cash benefit. And he'd rate
dialog: around fifty thousand capital sum.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Capital sum? What's that?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: That's if he got killed. Maybe I
dialog: shouldn't have said that.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I suppose you have to think of
dialog: everything in your business.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Mr. Dietrichson would understand.
dialog: I'm sure I could sell him on the
dialog: idea of some accident protection.
dialog: Why don't I talk to him about it.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: You could try. But he's pretty tough
dialog: going.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: They're all tough at first.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: He's got a lot on his mind. He doesn't
dialog: want to listen to anything except
text: maybe a baseball game on the radio.
dialog: Sometimes we sit all evening without
text: saying a word to each other.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Sounds pretty dull.
text: Phyllis shrugs.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: So I just sit and knit.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Is that what you married him for?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Maybe I like the way his thumbs hold
dialog: up the wool.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Anytime his thumbs get tired --
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I want to ask you something, Mr.
dialog: Neff. Could I get an accident policy
dialog: for him -- without bothering him at
dialog: all?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: How's that again.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: That would make it easier for you,
dialog: too. You wouldn't even have to talk
dialog: to him. I have a little allowance of
dialog: my own. I could pay for it and he
dialog: needn't know anything about it.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Wait a minute. Why shouldn't he know?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Because I know he doesn't want
dialog: accident insurance. He's superstitious
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: A lot of people are. Funny, isn't
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: If there was a way to get it like
dialog: that, all the worry would be over.
dialog: You see what I mean, Walter?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Sure. I've got good eyesight. You
dialog: want him to have the policy without
dialog: him knowing it. And that means without
dialog: the insurance company knowing that
dialog: he doesn't know. That's the set-up,
dialog: isn't it?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Is there anything wrong with it?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I think it's lovely. And then, some
dialog: dark wet night, if that crown block
dialog: fell on him --
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: What crown block?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Only sometimes they have to have a
dialog: little help. They can't quite make
dialog: it on their own.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Of course, it doesn't have to be a
dialog: crown block. It can be a car backing
text: over him, or he can fall out of an
dialog: upstairs window. Any little thing
dialog: like that, as long as it's a morgue
dialog: job.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Are you crazy?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Not that crazy. Goodbye, Mrs.
dialog: Dietrichson.
text: He picks up his hat.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Look, baby, you can't get away with
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Get away with what?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: You want to knock him off, don't
dialog: you, baby.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: That's a horrible thing to say!
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Who'd you think I was, anyway? A guy
text: that walks into a good-looking dame's
dialog: front parlor and says "Good afternoon,
dialog: I sell accident insurance on husbands.
dialog: You got one that's been around too
dialog: long? Somebody you'd like to turn
dialog: into a little hard cash? Just give
dialog: me a smile and I'll help you collect."
dialog: Boy, what a dope I must look to you!
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I think you're rotten.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I think you're swell. So long as I'm
dialog: not your husband.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Get out of here.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: You bet I will. You bet I'll get out
dialog: of here, baby. But quick.

dialog: the eyes. She didn't fool me for a
dialog: minute, not this time. I knew I had
text: hold of a redhot poker and the time
dialog: to drop it was before it burned my
text: hand off. I stopped at a drive-in
dialog: for a bottle of beer, the one I had
dialog: wanted all along, only I wanted it
dialog: worse now, to get rid of the sour
dialog: taste of her iced tea, and everything
dialog: that went with it. I didn't want to
dialog: go back to the office, so I dropped
text: by a bowling alley at Third and

speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE
dialog: (Continuing)
dialog: It had begun to rain outside and I
dialog: watched it get dark and didn't even
dialog: turn on the light. That didn't help
dialog: me either. I was all twisted up
dialog: inside, and I was still holding on
dialog: to that red-hot poker. And right
dialog: then it came over me that I hadn't
dialog: walked out on anything at all, that

dialog: wasn't the end between her and me.
dialog: It was only the beginning.
text: The doorbell rings.
speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Don't you want me to bring it in?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Sure. Put it on the chair.
text: She comes in. He closes the door.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: How did you know where I live?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
text: It's in the phone book.
text: Neff switches on the standing lamp.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS

speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Your husband out?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS

dialog: to see me.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I knew you wouldn't leave it like
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Like it was this afternoon.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I must have said something that gave
dialog: you a terribly wrong impression. You
dialog: must surely see that. You must never
dialog: think anything like that about me,
dialog: Walter.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: It's not okay. Not if you don't
dialog: believe me.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: What do you want me to do?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I want you to be nice to me. Like
dialog: the first time you came to the house.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: It can't be like the first time.
dialog: Something has happened.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I know it has. It's happened to us.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: That's what I mean.
text: Phyllis has moved over to the window. She stares out through
text: the wet window-pane.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: What's the matter now?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
text: I feel as if he was watching me. Not
dialog: that he cares about me. Not any more.
dialog: But he keeps me on a leash. So tight
dialog: I can't breathe. I'm scared.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: What of? He's in Long Beach, isn't
dialog: he?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I oughtn't to have come.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Maybe you oughtn't.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: You want me to go?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: If you want to.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Right now?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Sure. Right now.
text: By this time, he has hold of her wrist. He draws her to him
text: slowly and kisses her. Her arms tighten around him. After a
text: moment he pulls his head back, still holding her close.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: How were you going to do it?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Kill him.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Walter, for the last time --
text: She tries to jerk away but he holds her and kisses her again.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I'm crazy about you, baby.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I'm crazy about you, Walter.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: That perfume on your hair. What's
dialog: the name of it?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Something French. I bought it down
dialog: at Ensenada.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: We ought to have some of that pink

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS

dialog: Soda?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Plain water, please.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Get a couple of glasses, will you.
text: He points at the china closet. He has taken a tray of ice
text: cubes from the refrigerator and is holding it under the hot-
text: water faucet.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: You know, about six months ago a guy
text: slipped on the soap in his bathtub
dialog: and knocked himself cold and drowned.
dialog: Only he had accident insurance. So
dialog: they had an autopsy and she didn't
dialog: get away with it.
text: Phyllis has the glasses now. She hands them to him. He dumps
text: some ice cubes into the glasses.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Who didn't?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: His wife.
text: He reaches for the whiskey bottle on top of the china closet.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: And there was another case where a
dialog: guy was found shot and his wife said
text: he was cleaning a gun and his stomach
dialog: got in the way. All she collected
dialog: was a three-to-ten stretch in
dialog: Tehachapi.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Perhaps it was worth it to her.
text: Neff hands her a glass.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: See if you can carry this as far as

text: drink and looking around.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: It's nice here, Walter. Who takes
dialog: care of it for you?
speaker_heading: NEFF
text: A colored woman comes in twice a
dialog: week.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: You get your own breakfast?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Once in a while I squeeze a
dialog: grapefruit. The rest I get at the
text: corner drugstore.
text: They sit on the davenport, fairly close together.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: It sounds wonderful. Just strangers
dialog: beside you. You don't know them. You
dialog: don't hate them. You don't have to
text: sit across the table and smile at
dialog: him and that daughter of his every
dialog: morning of your life.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: What daughter? Oh, that little girl
text: on the piano.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Yes. Lola. She lives with us. He
dialog: thinks a lot more of her than he
dialog: does of me.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Ever think of a divorce?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: He wouldn't give me a divorce.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I suppose because it would cost him
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: He hasn't got any money. Not since
dialog: he went into the oil business.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: But he had when you married him?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Yes, he had. And I wanted a home.
dialog: Why not? But that wasn't the only
dialog: reason. I was his wife's nurse. She
dialog: was sick for a long time. When she
dialog: died, he was all broken up. I pitied
dialog: him so.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: And now you hate him.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Yes, Walter. He's so mean to me.
dialog: Every-time I buy a dress or a pair
text: of shoes he yells his head off. He
dialog: won't let me go anywhere. He keeps
dialog: me shut up. He's always been mean to
dialog: me. Even his life insurance all goes
dialog: to that daughter of his. That Lola.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Nothing for you at all, huh?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: No. And nothing is just what I'm
dialog: worth to him.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: So you lie awake in the dark and
text: listen to him snore and get ideas.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Walter, I don't want to kill him. I
dialog: never did. Not even when he gets
text: drunk and slaps my face.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Only sometimes you wish he was dead.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Perhaps I do.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: And you wish it was an accident, and
dialog: you had that policy. For fifty
dialog: thousand dollars. Is that it?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Perhaps that too.
text: She takes a long drink.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: The other night we drove home from a
dialog: party. He was drunk again. When we
text: got into the garage he just sat there
text: with his head on the steering wheel
dialog: and the motor still running. And I
dialog: thought what it would be like if I
dialog: didn't switch it off, just closed
text: the garage door and left him there.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I'll tell you what it would be like,
dialog: if you had that accident policy, and
dialog: tried to pull a monoxide job. We
dialog: have a guy in our office named Keyes.
dialog: For him a set-up like that would be
text: just like a slice of rare roast beef.
dialog: In three minutes he'd know it wasn't
dialog: an accident. In ten minutes you'd be
text: sitting under the hot lights. In
dialog: half an hour you'd be signing your
text: name to a confession.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: But Walter, I didn't do it. I'm not
dialog: going to do it.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Not if there's an insurance company
dialog: in the picture, baby. So long as
dialog: you're honest they'll pay you with a
dialog: smile, but you just try to pull
dialog: something like that and you'll find
dialog: out. They know more tricks than a
dialog: carload of monkeys. And if there's a
dialog: death mixed up in it, you haven't
dialog: got a prayer. They'll hang you as
dialog: sure as ten dimes will buy a dollar,
dialog: baby.
text: She begins to cry. He puts his arms around her and kisses
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Just stop thinking about it, will
dialog: you.

text: He has hooked the wastebasket under his feet to sit more
text: comfortably. As he talks, a little cough shakes him now and
dialog: then.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: So we just sat there, and she kept
text: on crying softly, like the rain on
dialog: the window, and we didn't say
dialog: anything. Maybe she had stopped
dialog: thinking about it, but I hadn't. I
dialog: couldn't. Because it all tied up
dialog: with something I had been thinking
dialog: about for years, since long before I
dialog: ever ran into Phyllis Dietrichson.
dialog: Because, in this business you can't
dialog: sleep for trying to figure out the
dialog: tricks they could pull on you. You're
dialog: like the guy behind the roulette
text: wheel, watching the customers to
dialog: make sure they don't crook the house.
dialog: And then one night, you get to
dialog: thinking how you could crook the
dialog: house yourself. And do it smart.
dialog: Because you've got that wheel right
dialog: under your hands. And you know every
dialog: notch in it by heart. And you figure
dialog: all you need is a plant out in front,
dialog: a shill to put down the bet. And
text: suddenly the doorbell rings and the
dialog: whole set-up is right there in the
dialog: room with you... Look, Keyes, I'm
dialog: not trying to whitewash myself. I
dialog: fought it, only maybe I didn't fight
dialog: it hard enough. The stakes were fifty
dialog: thousand dollars, but they were the
dialog: life of a man, too, a man who'd never
dialog: done me any dirt. Except he was
dialog: married to a woman he didn't care
dialog: anything about, and I did...

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I hate him. I loathe going back to

dialog: Walter?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Sure I believe you.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I can't stand it anymore. What if
dialog: they did hang me?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: You're not going to hang, baby.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: It's better than going on this way.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: -- you're not going to hang, baby.
dialog: Not ever. Because you're going to do

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: You!
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Me.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS

speaker_heading: NEFF

text: He gets up and grips her arm.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: We're going to do it together. We're
dialog: going to do it right. And I'm the
dialog: guy that knows how.
text: There is fierce determination in his voice. His fingers dig
text: into her arm.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Walter, you're hurting me.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: There isn't going to be any slip up.
dialog: Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak. It's

text: He kisses her.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: You go now.
text: He leads her towards the door.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Call me tomorrow. But not from your

dialog: step. Every single minute. It's got
dialog: to be perfect, understand. Straight
text: down the line.
text: They have now reached the door. Neff opens it. Phyllis stands
text: in the doorway, her lips white.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
text: Straight down the line.
text: She goes quietly. He watches her down the corridor. Slowly
text: he closes the door and goes back into the room. He moves
text: across the window and opens it wide. He stands there, looking
text: down into the dark street. From below comes the sound of a
text: car starting and driving off. The rain drifts in against his

text: Neff sits slumped in his chair before the dictaphone. On the
text: desk next to him stands a used record. The cylinder on the
text: dictaphone is not turning. He is smoking a cigarette. He
text: kills it then lifts the needle and slides off the record
text: which is on the machine and stands it on end on the desk
text: beside the other used record. He reaches down painfully to
text: take another record from the rack beneath the dictaphone,
text: looks at it against the light to make sure it has not been
text: used, then slides it into place on the machine and resets
text: the needle. He lifts the horn and resumes his dictation.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: The first thing we had to do was fix
dialog: him up with that accident policy. I
dialog: knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted
dialog: was his signature on an application.
dialog: So I had to make him sign without
dialog: his knowing what he was signing. And
dialog: I wanted a witness other than Phyllis
dialog: to hear me give him a sales talk. I
dialog: was trying to think with your brains,
dialog: Keyes. I wanted all the answers ready
dialog: for all the questions you were going
dialog: to spring as soon as Dietrichson was
dialog: dead.
text: Neff takes a last drag on his cigarette and kills it by
text: running it under the ledge of the dictaphone stand. He drops
text: the stub on the floor and resumes.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: A couple of nights later I went to
dialog: the house. Everything looked fine,
dialog: except I didn't like the witness
dialog: Phyllis had brought in. It was
dialog: Dietrichson's daughter Lola, and it
dialog: made me feel a little queer in the

text: lying tumbled on the floor beside him. He is smoking a cigar
text: with the band on it. He has a drink in front of him and
text: several more inside him. In another chair sits Neff, his
text: briefcase on the floor, leaning against his chair. He holds
text: his rate book partly open, with a finger in it for a marker.
text: He is going full swing.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I suppose you realize, Mr.
dialog: Dietrichson, that, not being an
dialog: employee, you are not covered by the
dialog: State Compensation Insurance Act.
dialog: The only way you can protect yourself
dialog: is by having a personal policy of
dialog: your own.
speaker_heading: DIETRICHSON
dialog: I know all about that. The next thing
dialog: you'll tell me I need earthquake
dialog: insurance and lightning insurance
dialog: and hail insurance.
text: Phyllis looks up from the checker-board and cuts in on the
text: dialogue. Lola listens without much interest.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: (To Dietrichson)
dialog: If we bought all the insurance they
dialog: can think up, we'd stay broke paying
dialog: for it, wouldn't we, honey?
speaker_heading: DIETRICHSON
dialog: What keeps us broke is you going out
text: and buying five hats at a crack. Who
dialog: needs a hat in California?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I always say insurance is a lot like
text: a hot water bottle. It looks kind of
dialog: useless and silly hanging on the
dialog: hook, but when you get that stomach
text: ache in the middle of the night, it
dialog: comes in mighty handy.
speaker_heading: DIETRICHSON
dialog: Now you want to sell me a hot water
dialog: bottle.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Dollar for dollar, accident insurance
dialog: is the cheapest coverage you can
dialog: buy, Mr. Dietrichson.
speaker_heading: DIETRICHSON
dialog: Maybe some other time, Mr. Neff. I
dialog: had a tough day.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Just as you say, Mr. Dietrichson.
speaker_heading: DIETRICHSON
dialog: Suppose we just settle that automobile
dialog: insurance tonight.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Sure. All we need on that is for you
dialog: to sign an application for renewal.
text: Phyllis throws a quick glance at Neff. As she looks back she
text: sees that Lola is staring down at her wrist watch.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Phyllis, do you mind if we don't
dialog: finish this game? It bores me stiff.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Got some thing better to do?
speaker_heading: LOLA

text: She gets up.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: (To Dietrichson)

speaker_heading: DIETRICHSON
dialog: Run along where? Who with?
speaker_heading: LOLA

speaker_heading: DIETRICHSON
dialog: Anne who?
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Anne Matthews.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS

speaker_heading: DIETRICHSON
dialog: It better not be that Zachetti guy.
dialog: If I ever catch you with that ---
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: It's Anne Matthews, I told you. I
dialog: also told you we're going roller
dialog: skating. I'm meeting her at the corner
dialog: of Vermont and Franklin -- the north-

dialog: interested. And I'm late already. I

speaker_heading: LOLA

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS

speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: No thanks. I'd rather be dead.
text: She goes out through the archway.
speaker_heading: DIETRICHSON
dialog: A great little fighter for her weight.
text: Dietrichson sucks down a big swallow of his drink.
text: Neff has taken two blank forms from his briefcase. He puts

text: top. Phyllis is watching closely.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: This is where you sign, Mr.
dialog: Dietrichson.
speaker_heading: DIETRICHSON
dialog: Sign what?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: The applications for your auto

speaker_heading: DIETRICHSON
dialog: When will that be?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: In about a week.

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS

speaker_heading: DIETRICHSON
dialog: What's wrong with that? Can't I have

speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Great football school, Stanford. Did
dialog: you play football, Mr. Dietrichson?
speaker_heading: DIETRICHSON
dialog: Left guard. Almost made the varsity,
dialog: too.
text: Neff has unscrewed his fountain pen. He hands it to Mr.
text: Dietrichson. Dietrichson puts on his glasses.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: On that bottom line, Mr. Dietrichson.
text: Dietrichson signs. Neff's and Phyllis' eyes meet for a split
dialog: second.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Both copies, please.
text: He withdraws the top copy barely enough to expose the
text: signature line on the supposed duplicate.
speaker_heading: DIETRICHSON
dialog: Sign twice, huh?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: One is the agent's copy. I need it
dialog: for my files.
speaker_heading: DIETRICHSON
dialog: (In a mutter)
text: Files. Duplicates. Triplicates.
text: Dietrichson grunts and signs again. Again Neff and Phyllis
text: exchange a quick glance.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: No hurry about the check, Mr.
dialog: Dietrichson. I can pick it up at
dialog: your office some morning.
text: Casually Neff lifts the briefcase and signed applications
text: off Dietrichson's lap.
speaker_heading: DIETRICHSON
dialog: How much you taking me for?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: One forty-seven fifty, Mr.

scene_heading: B-3 HALLWAY DIETRICHSON RESIDENCE - (NIGHT)
text: Phyllis enters through the living room archway with Neff

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: All right, Walter?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: He signed it, didn't he?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Sure he signed it. You saw him.
text: Phyllis opens the door a crack. Both look at the stairs,

speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: (Looking up)
dialog: Watch it, will you.

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: End of the month.
speaker_heading: NEFF

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS

speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Not this time. You're going to make

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Because it's all worked out for a

text: For a second they stand listening and looking up as if they
dialog: had heard a sound.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: It's all right. Go on, Walter.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Look, baby. There's a clause in every
dialog: accident policy, a little something
dialog: called double indemnity. The insurance
dialog: companies put it in as a sort of
dialog: come-on for the customers. It means
dialog: they pay double on certain accidents.
dialog: The kind that almost never happen.
dialog: Like for instance if a guy got killed
dialog: on a train, they'd pay a hundred
dialog: thousand instead of fifty.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I see.
text: (Her eyes widen with
dialog: excitement)
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: We're hitting it for the limit, baby.
dialog: That's why it's got to be a train.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: It's going to be a train, Walter.
dialog: Just the way you say. Straight down
dialog: the line.
text: They look at each other. The look is like a long kiss. Neff

speaker_heading: NEFF

speaker_heading: LOLA

speaker_heading: NEFF

speaker_heading: LOLA

speaker_heading: NEFF

speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Nino's not what my father says at

speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Hello, Nino.
speaker_heading: ZACHETTI
dialog: (Belligerent from the
dialog: first word)
dialog: The name is Zachetti.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Nino. Please. Mr. Neff gave me a
dialog: ride from the house. I told him all
dialog: about us.
speaker_heading: ZACHETTI
dialog: Why does he have to get told about
dialog: us?
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: We don't have to worry about Mr.
dialog: Neff, Nino.
speaker_heading: ZACHETTI
dialog: I'm not doing any worrying. Just
dialog: don't you broadcast so much.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: What's the matter with you, Nino?
dialog: He's a friend.
speaker_heading: ZACHETTI
dialog: I don't have any friends. And if I
dialog: did, I like to pick them myself.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Look, sonny, she needed the ride and
dialog: I brought her along. Is that anything
dialog: to get tough about?
speaker_heading: ZACHETTI
dialog: All right, Lola, make up your mind.
dialog: Are you coming or aren't you?
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Of course I'm coming. Don't mind
dialog: him, Mr. Neff.
text: Lola steps out of the car.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Thanks a lot. You've been very sweet.
text: Lola catches up with Zachetti and they walk away together.
scene_heading: B-10 INT. COUPE
text: Neff looks after them. Slowly he puts the car in gear and
text: drives on. His face is tight. Behind his head, light catches
text: the metal of the zipper on the briefcase. Over the shot comes
speaker_heading: the COMMENTARY:
speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE
dialog: She was a nice kid and maybe he was
dialog: a little better than he sounded. I
dialog: kind of hoped so for her sake, but
dialog: right then it gave me a nasty feeling
dialog: to be thinking about them at all,
dialog: with that briefcase right behind my
dialog: head and her father's application in
dialog: it. Besides, I had other problems to
dialog: work out. There were plans to make,
dialog: and Phyllis had to be in on them...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: B-11 EXT. SUPER MARKET - (DAY)
dialog: There is a fair amount of activity but the place is not
text: crowded. Neff comes along the sidewalk into the shot. He
text: passes in front of the fruit and vegetable display and goes
text: between the stalls into the market.
speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE
dialog: (Continued)
dialog: ...but we couldn't be seen together
dialog: any more and I had told her never to
dialog: call me from her house and never to
dialog: call me at my office. So we had picked
dialog: out a big market on Los Feliz. She
dialog: was to be there buying stuff every
dialog: day about eleven o'clock, and I could
dialog: run into her there. Kind of
text: accidentally on purpose.
scene_heading: B-12 INT. MARKET
text: Neff stops by the cashier's desk and buys a pack of
text: cigarettes. As he is opening the pack he looks back casually
text: beyond the turnstile into the rear part of the market.
text: B-13 ROWS OF HIGH SHELVES IN MARKET
text: The shelves are loaded with canned goods and other
text: merchandise. Customers move around selecting articles and
text: putting them in their baskets. Phyllis is seen among them,
text: standing by the soap section. Her basket is partly filled.
text: She wears a simple house dress, no hat, and has a large
text: envelope pocketbook under her arm.
scene_heading: B-14 INT. MARKET
text: Neff has spotted Phyllis. Without haste he passes through
text: the turnstile towards the back.
scene_heading: B-15 THE SHELVES
text: Phyllis is putting a can of cleaning powder into her basket.
text: Neff enters the shot and moves along the shelves towards
text: her, very slowly, pretending to inspect the goods. A customer
text: passes and goes on out of scene. Phyllis and Neff are now
text: very close. During the ensuing low-spoken dialogue, they
text: continue to face the shelves, not looking at each other
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Walter.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Not so loud.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I wanted to talk to you, Walter.
dialog: Ever since yesterday.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Let me talk first. It's all set. The
dialog: accident policy came through. I've
dialog: got it in my pocket. I got his check
dialog: too. I saw him down in the oil fields.
dialog: He thought he was paying for the
dialog: auto insurance. The check's just
dialog: made out to the company. It could be
dialog: for anything. But you have to send a
dialog: check for the auto insurance, see.
dialog: It's all right that way, because one
dialog: of the cars is yours.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: But listen, Walter ---
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Quick, open your bag.
text: She hesitates, then opens it. Neff looks around quickly,
text: slips the policy out of his pocket and drops it into her
text: bag. She snaps the bag shut.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Can you get into his safe deposit
dialog: box?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Yes. We both have keys.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Fine. But don't put the policy in
dialog: there yet. I'll tell you when. And
dialog: listen, you never touched it or even
dialog: saw it, understand?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I'm not a fool.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Okay. When is he taking the train?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Walter, that's just it. He isn't
dialog: going.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: That's what I've been trying to tell
dialog: you. The trip is off.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: What's happened?
text: He breaks off as a short, squatty woman, pushing a child in
text: a walker, comes into sight and approaches. She stops beside
text: Neff, who is pretending to read a label on a can. Phyllis
text: puts a few cakes of soap into her basket.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (To Neff)
dialog: Mister, could you reach me that can
dialog: of coffee?
dialog: (She points)
dialog: That one up there.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: (Reaching up)
dialog: This one?
text: She nods. Neff reaches a can down from the high shelf and
text: hands it to her.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I don't see why they always have to
dialog: put what I want on the top shelf.
text: She moves away with her coffee and her child. Out of the
text: corner of his eye Neff watches her go. He moves closer to
dialog: Phyllis again.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Go ahead. I'm listening.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
text: He had a fall down at the well. He
text: broke his leg. It's in a cast.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: That knocks it on the head all right.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: What do we do, Walter?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Nothing. Just wait.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Wait for what?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Until he can take a train. I told
dialog: you it's got to be a train.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: We can't wait. I can't go on like
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: We're not going to grab a hammer and
dialog: do it quick, just to get it over
dialog: with.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: There are other ways.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Only we're not going to do it other
dialog: ways.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: But we can't leave it like this.
dialog: What do you think would happen if he
dialog: found out about this accident policy?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Plenty. But not as bad as sitting in
dialog: that death-house.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Don't ever talk like that, Walter.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Just don't let's start losing our
dialog: heads.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: It's not our heads. It's our nerve
dialog: we're losing.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: We're going to do it right. That's
dialog: all I said.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Walter maybe it's my nerves. It's
dialog: the waiting that gets me.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: It's getting me just as bad, baby.
dialog: But we've got to wait.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Maybe we have, Walter. Only it's so
dialog: tough without you. It's like a wall
dialog: between us.
text: Neff looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Good-bye baby. I'm thinking of you
dialog: every minute.
text: He goes off. She stares after him.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: B-16 NEFF'S OFFICE - (DAY)
text: He is wearing a light grey suit and has his hat on. He is
text: standing behind his desk opening some mail, taking a few
text: papers out of his briefcase, checking something in his rate
text: book, making a quick telephone call. But nothing of this is
dialog: heard.
speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE
dialog: After that a full week went by and I
dialog: didn't see her once. I tried to keep
dialog: my mind off her and off the whole
dialog: idea. I kept telling myself that
dialog: maybe those fates they say watch
dialog: over you had gotten together and
dialog: broken his leg to give me a way out.
dialog: Then it was the fifteenth of June.
dialog: You may remember that date, Keyes. I
dialog: do too, only for a very different
dialog: reason. You came into my office around
dialog: three in the afternoon...
text: Keyes enters with some papers in his hand.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Hello, Keyes.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: I just came from Norton's office.
dialog: The semi-annual sales records are
dialog: out. You're high man, Walter. That's
text: twice in a row. Congratulations.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Thanks. How would you like a cheap
dialog: drink?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: How would you like a fifty dollar
dialog: cut in salary?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: How would I -- Do I laugh now, or
dialog: wait until it gets funny?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: I'm serious, Walter. I've been talking
dialog: to Norton. There's too much stuff
text: piling up on my desk. Too much
dialog: pressure on my nerves. I spend half
dialog: the night walking up and down in my
dialog: bed. I've got to have an assistant.
dialog: I thought that you --
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Me? Why pick on me?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Because I've got a crazy idea you
dialog: might be good at the job.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: That's crazy all right. I'm a
dialog: salesman.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Yeah. A peddler, a glad-hander, a
dialog: back-slapper. You're too good to be
dialog: a salesman.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Nobody's too good to be a salesman.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Phooey. All you guys do is ring door-
text: bells and dish out a smooth line of
dialog: monkey talk. What's bothering you is
dialog: that fifty buck cut, isn't it?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: That'd bother anybody.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Look, Walter. The job I'm talking
dialog: about takes brains and integrity. It
dialog: takes more guts than there is in
dialog: fifty salesman. It's the hottest job
dialog: in the business.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: It's still a desk job. I don't want
dialog: a desk job.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: A desk job. Is that all you can see
dialog: in it? Just a hard chair to park
dialog: your pants on from nine to five.
text: Just a pile of papers to shuffle
text: around, and five sharp pencils and a
dialog: scratch pad to make figures on, with
text: maybe a little doodling on the side.
dialog: That's not the way I see it, Walter.
dialog: To me a claims man is a surgeon, and
text: that desk is an operating table, and
dialog: those pencils are scalpels and bone
dialog: chisels. And those papers are not
dialog: just forms and statistics and claims
dialog: for compensation. They're alive,
text: they're packed with drama, with
text: twisted hopes and crooked dreams. A
dialog: claims man, Walter, is a doctor and
text: a blood-hound and a cop and a judge
text: and a jury and a father confessor,
dialog: all in one.
text: The telephone rings on Neff's desk. Automatically Keyes grabs
text: the phone and answers.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Who? Okay, hold the line.
text: He puts the phone down on the desk and continues to Neff:
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: And you want to tell me you're not
dialog: interested. You don't want to work
dialog: with your brains. All you want to
dialog: work with is your finger on a door-
dialog: bell. For a few bucks more a week.
dialog: There's a dame on your phone.
text: Neff picks the phone up and answers.
speaker_heading: NEFF

scene_heading: B-19 PHYLLIS - ON PHONE
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS

scene_heading: B-20 NEFF - ON PHONE
text: His eyes are on Keyes. He speaks into the phone as calmly as
dialog: possible.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I'm listening. Only make it short...
dialog: Margie.
scene_heading: B-21 PHYLLIS - ON PHONE
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
text: He's on crutches. The doctor says he

dialog: Only with the crutches it's ever so
dialog: much better, isn't it?
speaker_heading: B-22 NEFF'S OFFICE
text: Neff on phone.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: One hundred percent better. Hold the
dialog: line a minute.
text: He covers the receiver with his hand and turns to Keyes, who
text: is now standing at the window.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Suppose I join you in your office,
dialog: Keyes --
text: He makes a gesture as if expecting Keyes to leave. Keyes
dialog: stays right where he is.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: I'll wait. Only tell Margie not to
dialog: take all day.
text: Neff looks at Keyes' back with a strained expression, then
text: lifts the phone again.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Go ahead.
scene_heading: B-23 PHYLLIS, ON PHONE
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: It's the ten-fifteen from Glendale.

scene_heading: B-27 PHYLLIS, ON PHONE
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS

dialog: Walter. Goodbye.
speaker_heading: B-28 NEFF'S OFFICE
text: Neff on the phone.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: So long, Margie.
text: He hangs up. His mouth is grim, but he forces a smile as
text: Keyes turns.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I'm sorry, Keyes.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: What's the matter? The dames chasing
dialog: you again? Or still? Or is it none
dialog: of my business?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: (With a sour smile)
dialog: If I told you it was a customer --
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Margie! I bet she drinks from the
dialog: bottle. Why don't you settle down
dialog: and get married, Walter?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Why don't you, for instance?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: I almost did, once. A long time ago.
text: Neff gets up from his desk.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Look, Keyes, I've got a prospect to
dialog: call on.
text: Keyes drives right ahead.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: We even had the church all picked
dialog: out, the dame and I. She had a white
text: satin dress with flounces on it. And
dialog: I was on my way to the jewelry store
text: to buy the ring. Then suddenly that
dialog: little man in here started working
dialog: on me.
text: He punches his stomach with his fist.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: So you went back and started
dialog: investigating her. That it?
text: Keyes nods slowly, a little sad and a little ashamed.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: And the stuff that came out. She'd
dialog: been dyeing her hair ever since she
dialog: was sixteen. And there was a manic-
text: depressive in her family, on her
dialog: mother's side. And she already had
dialog: one husband, a professional pool
dialog: player in Baltimore. And as for her
dialog: brother --
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I get the general idea. She was a
text: tramp from a long line of tramps.
text: He picks up some papers impatiently.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: All right, I'm going. What am I to
dialog: say to Norton? How about that job I
dialog: want you for?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I don't think I want it. Thanks,
text: Keyes, just the same.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Fair enough. Just get this: I picked
dialog: you for the job, not because I think
dialog: you're so darn smart, but because I
dialog: thought maybe you were a shade less
dialog: dumb than the rest of the outfit. I
dialog: guess I was all wet. You're not
dialog: smarter, Walter. You're just a little
dialog: taller.
text: He goes out. Neff is alone. He watches the door close, then
text: turns and goes slowly to the water cooler. He fills a paper
text: cup and stands holding it. His thoughts are somewhere else.
text: After a moment he absently throws the cupful of water into
text: the receptacle under the cooler. He goes back to the desk.
text: He takes his rate book out of his brief case and puts it on
text: the desk. He buttons the top button of his shirt, and pulls
text: his tie right. He leaves the office, with his briefcase under
text: his arm.
speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE
dialog: That was it, Keyes, and there was no
dialog: use kidding myself any more. Those
dialog: fates I was talking about had only
dialog: been stalling me off. Now they had
text: thrown the switch. The gears had
text: meshed. The machinery had started to
dialog: move and nothing could stop it. The
dialog: time for thinking had all run out.
dialog: From here on it was a question of
dialog: following the time table, move by
dialog: move, just as we had it rehearsed. I
dialog: wanted my time all accounted for for
dialog: the rest of the afternoon and up to
dialog: the last possible moment in the
dialog: evening. So I arranged to call on a
dialog: prospect in Pasadena about a public
dialog: liability bond. When I left the office
dialog: I put my rate book on the desk as if
dialog: I had forgotten it. That was part of
dialog: the alibi.

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE
dialog: Up in my apartment I called Lou
dialog: Schwartz, one of the salesmen that
dialog: shared my office. He lived in
dialog: Westwood. That made it a toll call
dialog: and there'd be a record of it. I
dialog: told him I had forgotten my rate
dialog: book and needed some dope on the
dialog: public liability bond I was figuring.
dialog: I asked him to call me back. This
dialog: was another item in my alibi, so
dialog: that later on I could prove that I

speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE
dialog: (Cont'd)
text: I stuffed a hand towel and a big

dialog: I fixed the telephone and the
dialog: doorbell, so that the cards would
dialog: fall down if the bells rang. That
dialog: way I would know there had been a
dialog: phone call or visitor while I was
dialog: away. I left the apartment house by
text: the fire stairs and side door. Nobody
dialog: saw me. It was already getting dark.
dialog: I took the Vermont Avenue bus to Los

speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE
dialog: Then I was in the garage. His car
dialog: was backed in, just the way I told

text: catches up with him.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: You all right, honey? I'll have the

scene_heading: B-40 INT. GARAGE
text: THE CAMERA IS VERY LOW INSIDE THE SEDAN, shooting slightly

text: closes the door again.
scene_heading: B-41 EXT. GARAGE
text: Dietrichson stands watching Phyllis as she gets into the car

text: spaces from the next car, facing away from the CAMERA. Both
text: front doors are open. Phyllis gets out and from the other
text: side crutches emerge, and a man (seen entirely from behind,
text: and apparently Dietrichson) climbs out awkwardly. While he
text: is steadying himself on the ground with the crutches, Phyllis
text: has taken out Dietrichson's suitcase and overcoat. She walks
text: around the car and rolls up the right front window. She closes
text: and locks the car door. She tries the right rear door and

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I remember everything.
speaker_heading: NEFF

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Walter, we've been through all that

speaker_heading: NEFF

scene_heading: B-50 GLENDALE STATION PLATFORM

dialog: do.
scene_heading: B-51 EXT. CAR #9: B-52: B-53

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: It's all right, thanks. My husband

dialog: ticket.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Car nine, section eleven. The

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Goodbye, honey. Take awful good care

speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Sure, I will. Just you take it easy

speaker_heading: PORTER

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Good luck, honey.

speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Can I pull a chair out for you?
text: Neff looks around. He sees a man sitting in the corner smoking
text: a hand-rolled cigarette. He is about fifty-five years old,
text: with white hair, and a broad-brimmed Stetson hat. He looks
text: like a small town lawyer or maybe a mining man. Neff does
text: not like the man's presence there very much. He turns to him

speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: No thanks, I'd rather stand.
speaker_heading: MAN

speaker_heading: NEFF

speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: That darn cast sure itches something

dialog: to get rid of Jackson.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Palo Alto's a nice little town. You
dialog: a Stanford man?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Used to be.
text: He starts patting his pockets as if looking for something.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: I bet you left something behind. I
dialog: always do.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: My cigar case. Must have left it in
text: my overcoat back in the section.
text: Jackson takes out a small bag of tobacco and a packet of
dialog: cigarette papers.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Care to roll yourself a cigarette,
dialog: Mr. --?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Dietrichson. Thanks. I really prefer
dialog: cigars.

dialog: Maybe the porter --
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: I could get your cigars for you. Be

speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: That's darn nice of you. It's car
dialog: nine, section eleven. If you're sure
dialog: it's not too much trouble.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Car nine, section eleven. A pleasure.
text: He rises and exits into the parlor car. Neff turns slowly
text: and watches Jackson go back through the car. Then he moves
text: to one side of the platform and looks ahead along the track
text: to orientate himself. He gives one last glance back into the
text: parlor car to make sure no one is watching him. He slips the
text: crutches from under his arms and stands on both feet. He
text: drops the crutches off the train onto the tracks, then quickly
text: swings his body over the rail.
scene_heading: B-59 EXT. MOVING OBSERVATION CAR - CAMERA FOLLOWING
text: Neff is hanging onto the railing. He looks down, then lets
text: go and drops to the right-of-way. THE CAMERA STOPS. The train
text: recedes slowly into the night. Neff has fallen on the tracks.
text: He picks himself up, rubs one knee and looks back along the
text: line of the tracks and off to one side.
scene_heading: B-60 DARK LANDSCAPE - RAILROAD TRACKS
text: Close beyond the edge of the right-of-way, the silhouette of
text: a dump shows up. Beside it looms the dark bulk of the

speaker_heading: B-61 NEFF
text: He starts running towards the car. He runs a little awkwardly
text: because of the improvised cast on his left foot.
scene_heading: B-62 CAR IN THE DARK
text: The front door opens and Phyllis steps out. She closes the
text: door and looks in the direction of the tracks. The uneven
text: steps of Neff running towards her are heard. She opens the
text: back door of the car and leans in. She pulls the rug off the
text: corpse (which is not visible) and stands looking into the
text: car, unable to take her eyes off what she sees, while at the
text: same time her hands mechanically begin to fold the rug. The
text: running steps grow louder and Neff comes into the SHOT
text: breathing hard. He reaches her.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Okay. This has to go fast. Take his
text: hat and pick up the crutches.
text: Neff points back towards the tracks. He reaches into the car
text: and begins to drag out the body by the armpits. Phyllis coolly
text: reaches past him and takes the hat off the dead man's head.
text: She turns to go.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Hang on to that rug. I'll need it.
text: Phyllis moves out of the shot carrying the hat and rug.
speaker_heading: B-63 NEFF
text: He gets a stronger hold on the dead Dietrichson and drags
text: him free of the car and towards the tracks. The corpse is
dialog: not seen.
speaker_heading: B-64 PHYLLIS
text: She has reached the point where one of the crutches lies.
text: She picks it up and goes for the other crutch a short distance
text: away. She carries both crutches, the hat and the rug towards
dialog: Neff.
speaker_heading: B-65 NEFF
text: He has reached the railroad tracks. The corpse is lying beside
text: the tracks, face down. Phyllis comes up to Neff. He takes
text: the crutches and the hat from her. He throws the crutches
text: beside the corpse. He takes the hat from Phyllis and tosses
text: it carelessly along the track.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Let's go. Stay behind me.
text: He takes the rug from her and they move back towards the

dialog: rug as they go.
speaker_heading: B-66 THE CAR
text: They reach it together.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Get in. You drive.

scene_heading: B-67 INT. CAR
text: Phyllis is behind the wheel. Neff beside her is just closing
text: the door. He props his wrapped foot against the dashboard
text: and begins to tear off the adhesive tape while at the same
text: time Phyllis presses the starter button. The starter grinds,
text: but the motor doesn't catch. She tries again. It still doesn't
text: catch. Neff looks at her. She tries a third time. The starter
text: barely turns over. The battery is very low.
text: Phyllis leans back. They stare at each other desperately.
text: After a moment Neff bends forward slowly and turns the
text: ignition key to the OFF position. He holds his left thumb
text: poised over the starter button. There is a breathless moment.
text: Then he presses the starter button with swift decision. The
text: starter grinds with nerve-wracking sluggishness. Neff twists
text: the ignition key to ON and instantly pulls the hand-throttle
text: wide open. With a last feeble kick of the starter, the motor
text: catches and races. He eases the throttle down and slides
text: back into his place. They look at each other again. The
text: tenseness of the moment still shows in their faces.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Let's go, baby.

dialog: Sit down, gentlemen.
dialog: (To Keyes)
dialog: Any new developments?
text: Keyes and Neff sit down, Norton remains standing.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: I just talked to this Jackson long
text: distance. Up in Medford, Oregon.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: Who's Jackson?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: The last guy that saw Dietrichson
text: alive. They were out on the
text: observation platform together talking.
dialog: Dietrichson wanted a cigar and Jackson
dialog: went to get Dietrichson's cigar case
dialog: for him. When he came back to the
dialog: observation platform, no Dietrichson.
dialog: Jackson didn't think anything was
text: wrong until a wire caught up with
dialog: the train at Santa Barbara. They had
dialog: found Dietrichson's body on the tracks
dialog: near Burbank.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: Very interesting, about the cigar
dialog: case.
text: He walks up and down behind his desk thinking hard.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: Anything else?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Not much. Dietrichson's secretary
dialog: says she didn't know anything about
dialog: the policy. There is a daughter, but
text: all she remembers is Neff talking to
dialog: her father about accident insurance
dialog: at their house one night.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I couldn't sell him at first. Mrs.
dialog: Dietrichson opposed it. He told me
dialog: he'd think it over. Later on I went
dialog: down to the oil fields and closed
dialog: him. He signed the application and
dialog: gave me his check.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: (Dripping with sarcasm)
dialog: A fine piece of salesmanship that
dialog: was, Mr. Neff.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: There's no sense in pushing Neff
dialog: around. He's got the best sales record
dialog: in the office. Are your salesmen
dialog: supposed to know that the customer
dialog: is going to fall off a train?
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: Fall off a train? Are we sure
dialog: Dietrichson fell off the train?
text: There is a charged pause.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: I don't get it.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: You don't, Mr. Keyes? Then what do
dialog: you think of this case? This policy
dialog: might cost us a great deal of money.
dialog: As you know, it contains a double
dialog: indemnity clause. Just what is your
dialog: opinion?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: No opinion at all.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: Not even a hunch? One of those
dialog: interesting little hunches of yours?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Nope. Not even a hunch.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes. I've formed
dialog: a very definite opinion. I think I
dialog: know -- in fact I know I know what
dialog: happened to Dietrichson.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: You know you know what?
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: I know it was not an accident.
text: He looks from Keyes to Neff and back to Keyes.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: What do you say to that?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Me? You've got the ball. Let's see
dialog: you run with it.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: There's a widespread feeling that
dialog: just because a man has a large office --
text: The dictograph on his desk buzzes. He reaches over and
text: depresses a key and puts the earpiece to his ear.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: (Into dictograph)
dialog: Yes?... Have her come in, please.
text: He replaces the earpiece. He turns back to Keyes and Neff.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: -- that just because a man has a
dialog: large office he must be an idiot.
dialog: I'm having a visitor, if you don't
dialog: mind.
text: Keyes and Neff start to get up.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: No, no. I want you to stay and watch
dialog: me handle this.
text: The secretary has opened the door.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Mrs. Dietrichson.
text: Neff stands staring at the door. He relaxes with an obvious
text: effort of will. Phyllis comes in. She wears a gray tailored
text: suit, small black hat with a veil, black gloves, and carries
text: a black bag. The secretary closes the door behind her. Mr.
text: Norton goes to meet her.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: Thank you very much for coming, Mrs.
dialog: Dietrichson. I assure you I appreciate
dialog: it.
text: He turns a little towards Keyes.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: This is Mr. Keyes.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: How do you do.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: How do you do.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: And Mr. Neff.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I've met Mr. Neff. How do you do.
text: Norton has placed a chair. Phyllis sits. Norton goes behind
dialog: his desk.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: Mrs. Dietrichson, I assure you of
dialog: our sympathy in your bereavement. I
dialog: hesitated before asking you to come
dialog: here so soon after your loss.
text: Phyllis nods silently.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: But now that you're here I hope you
dialog: won't mind if I plunge straight into
dialog: business. You know why we asked you
dialog: to come, don't you?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: No. All I know is that your secretary
dialog: made it sound very urgent.
text: Keyes sits quietly in his chair with his legs crossed. He
text: has hung his hat on his foot and thrust his thumbs in the
text: armholes of his vest. He looks a little bored. Neff, behind
text: him, stands leaning against the false mantel, completely
text: dead-pan.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: Your husband had an accident policy
dialog: with this company. Evidently you
dialog: don't know that, Mrs. Dietrichson.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: No. I remember some talk at the house --
text: She looks towards Neff.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: -- but he didn't seem to want it.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: He took it out a few days later,
dialog: Mrs. Dietrichson.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: You'll probably find the policy among
dialog: his personal effects.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: His safe deposit box hasn't been
dialog: opened yet. It seems a tax examiner
dialog: has to be present.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: Please, Mrs. Dietrichson, I don't
dialog: want you to think you are being
dialog: subjected to any questioning. But
dialog: there are a few things we should
dialog: like to know.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: What sort of things?
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: We have the report of the coroner's
dialog: inquest. Accidental death. We are
dialog: not entirely satisfied. In fact we
dialog: are not satisfied at all.
text: Phyllis looks at him coolly.
text: Keyes looks vaguely interested.
text: Neff is staring straight at Phyllis.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson, we suspect
dialog: suicide.
text: Phyllis doesn't bat an eyelash.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: I'm sorry. Would you like a glass of
dialog: water?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: Mr. Neff.
text: He indicates a thermos on a stand near Neff. Neff pours a
text: glass of water and carries it over to Phyllis. She has lifted
text: her veil a little. She takes the glass from his hand.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Thank you.
text: Their eyes meet for a fraction of a second.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: Had your husband been moody or
dialog: depressed lately, Mrs. Dietrichson?
dialog: Did he seem to have financial worries,
dialog: for instance?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: He was perfectly all right and I
dialog: don't know of any financial worries.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: There must have been something, Mrs.
dialog: Dietrichson. Let us examine this so-
dialog: called accident. First, your husband
dialog: takes out this policy in absolute
dialog: secrecy. Why? Because he doesn't
dialog: want his family to suspect what he
dialog: intends to do.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: NORTON
text: Commit suicide. Next, he goes on
dialog: this trip entirely alone. He has to
text: be alone. He hobbles all the way out
dialog: to the observation platform, very
text: unlikely with his leg in a cast,
dialog: unless he has a very strong reason.
text: Once there, he finds he is not alone.
dialog: There is a man there. What was his
dialog: name, Keyes?
text: Norton flips his fingers impatiently at Keyes who doesn't
dialog: even bother to look up.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: His name was Jackson. Probably still
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: Jackson. So your husband gets rid of
dialog: this Jackson with some flimsy excuse
text: about cigars. And then he is alone.
text: And then he does it. He jumps.
dialog: Suicide. In which case the company
dialog: is not liable.
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: You know that, of course. We could
dialog: go to court --
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I don't know anything. In fact I
dialog: don't know why I came here.
text: She makes as if to rise indignantly.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: Just a moment, please. I said we
dialog: could go to court. I didn't say we
dialog: want to. Not only is it against our
dialog: practice, but it would involve a
dialog: great deal of expense, a lot of
dialog: lawyers, a lot of time, perhaps years.
text: Phyllis rises coldly.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: So what I want to suggest is a
text: compromise on both sides. A settlement
dialog: for a certain sum, a part of the
dialog: policy value --
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Don't bother, Mr. Norton. When I
dialog: came in here I had no idea you owed
dialog: me any money. You told me you did.
dialog: Then you told me you didn't. Now you
dialog: tell me you want to pay me a part of
dialog: it, whatever it is. You want to
dialog: bargain with me, at a time like this.
dialog: I don't like your insinuations about
dialog: my husband, Mr. Norton, and I don't
dialog: like your methods. In fact I don't
dialog: like you, Mr. Norton. Goodbye,
dialog: gentlemen.
text: She turns and walks out. The door closes after her. There is
text: a pregnant pause. Keyes straightens up in his chair.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Nice going, Mr. Norton. You sure
dialog: carried that ball.
text: Norton pours himself a glass of water and stands holding it.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Only you fumbled on the goal line.
dialog: Then you heaved an illegal forward
text: pass and got thrown for a forty-yard
dialog: loss. Now you can't pick yourself up
dialog: because you haven't got a leg to
dialog: stand on.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: I haven't eh? Let her claim. Let her
dialog: sue. We can prove it was suicide.
text: Keyes stands up.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Can we? Mr. Norton, the first thing
dialog: that hit me was that suicide angle.
dialog: Only I dropped it in the wastepaper
dialog: basket just three seconds later. You
dialog: ought to take a look at the statistics
dialog: on suicide sometime. You might learn
dialog: a little something about the insurance
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: NORTON
dialog: I was raised in the insurance
dialog: business, Mr. Keyes.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Yeah. In the front office. Come on,
dialog: you never read an actuarial table in
dialog: your life. I've got ten volumes on
dialog: suicide alone. Suicide by race, by
dialog: color, by occupation, by sex, by
dialog: seasons of the year, by time of day.
dialog: Suicide, how committed: by poisons,
text: by fire-arms, by drowning, by leaps.
dialog: Suicide by poison, subdivided by
dialog: types of poison, such as corrosive,
text: irritant, systemic, gaseous, narcotic,
dialog: alkaloid, protein, and so forth.
text: Suicide by leaps, subdivided by leaps
text: from high places, under wheels of
text: trains, under wheels of trucks, under
text: the feet of horses, from steamboats.
dialog: But Mr. Norton, of all the cases on
dialog: record there's not one single case
text: of suicide by leap from the rear end
dialog: of a moving train. And do you know
dialog: how fast that train was going at the
dialog: point where the body was found?
dialog: Fifteen miles an hour. Now how could
dialog: anybody jump off a slow moving train
dialog: like that with any kind of expectation
dialog: that he would kill himself? No soap,
dialog: Mr. Norton. We're sunk, and we're
dialog: going to pay through the nose, and
dialog: you know it. May I have this?
text: Keyes' throat is dry after the long speech. He grabs the
text: glass of water out of Norton's hand and drains it in one big
dialog: gulp.
text: Norton is watching him almost stupefied. Neff stands with
text: the shadow of a smile on his face. Keyes puts the glass down
text: noisily on Norton's desk.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Come on, Walter.
text: Norton doesn't move or speak. Keyes puts his hat on and
text: crosses towards the door, Neff after him. With the doorknob
text: in his hand Keyes turns back to Norton with a glance down at
text: his own shirt sleeves.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.
text: They go out.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: C-5 NEFF - AT DICTAPHONE - (NIGHT)
text: There is a tired grin on his face as he talks into the horn.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I could have hugged you right then
dialog: and there, Keyes, you and your
dialog: statistics. You were the only one we
dialog: were really scared of, and instead
dialog: you were almost playing on our team...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: C-6 NEFF'S APARTMENT - EVENING - ALMOST DARK IN THE ROOM
text: The corridor door opens letting light in. Neff enters with
text: his hat on and his briefcase under his arm. He switches the
text: lights on, closes the door, puts the lights on, closes the
text: door, puts the key in his pocket. At this moment the telephone
text: rings. He picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE
dialog: That evening when I got home my nerves
text: had eased off. I could feel the ground
text: under my feet again, and it looked
dialog: like easy going from there on it.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Hello... Hello, baby.... Sure,
dialog: everything is fine... You were
text: wonderful in Norton's office.
scene_heading: C-7 INT. TELEPHONE BOOTH IN A DRUG STORE
text: Phyllis is on the phone. She is not dressed as in Norton's
dialog: office.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I felt so funny. I wanted to look at
dialog: you all the time.
scene_heading: C-8 NEFF ON TELEPHONE IN HIS APARTMENT
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: How do you think I felt? Where are
dialog: you, baby?
scene_heading: C-9 PHYLLIS ON PHONE
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
text: At the drug store. Just a block away.
dialog: Can I come up?
scene_heading: C-10 NEFF'S APARTMENT - (NIGHT) - NEFF ON PHONE
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Okay. But be careful. Don't let
dialog: anybody see you.
text: He hangs up, takes off his hat and drops hat and briefcase
text: on the davenport. He looks around the room and crosses to
text: lower the venetian blinds and draw the curtains. He gathers
text: up the morning paper which is lying untidily on the floor
text: and puts it in the waste-paper basket.
text: The door bell rings.
text: Neff stops in sudden alarm. It can't be Phyllis. The time is
text: too short. For a second he stands there motionless, then
text: crosses to the door and opens it.
text: In the open door stands Keyes.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Hello, Keyes.
text: Keyes walks past him into the room. His hands are clasped
text: behind his back. There is a strange, absent-minded look in
text: his eyes. Neff closes the door without taking his eyes off
dialog: Keyes.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: What's on your mind?
text: Keyes stops in the middle of the room and turns.
speaker_heading: KEYES
text: That broken leg. The guy broke his
dialog: leg.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Talking about Dietrichson. He had
dialog: accident insurance, didn't he? Then
dialog: he broke his leg, didn't he?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: So what?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: And he didn't put in a claim. Why
dialog: didn't he put in a claim? Why?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: What the dickens are you driving at?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Walter. There's something wrong. I
dialog: ate dinner two hours ago. It stuck
dialog: half way.
text: He prods his stomach with his thumb.
speaker_heading: KEYES
text: The little man is acting up again.
dialog: Because there's something wrong with
dialog: that Dietrichson case.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Because he didn't put in a claim?
dialog: Maybe he just didn't have time.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Oh maybe he just didn't know he was
dialog: insured.
text: He has stopped in front of Neff. They look at each other for
text: a tense moment. Neff hardly breathes.
text: Keyes shakes his head suddenly.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: No. That couldn't be it. You delivered
dialog: the policy to him personally, didn't
dialog: you, Walter? And you got his check.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: (Stiff-lipped, but
dialog: his voice is as well
dialog: under control as he
dialog: can manage)
dialog: Sure, I did.
text: Keyes prods his stomach again.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Got any bicarbonate of soda?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: No I haven't.
text: Keyes resumes his pacing.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Listen, Walter. I've been living
dialog: with this little man for twenty-six
dialog: years. He's never failed me yet.
dialog: There's got to be something wrong.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Maybe Norton was right. Maybe it was
dialog: suicide, Keyes.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: No. Not suicide.
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: But not accident either.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: What else?
text: There is another longer pause, agonizing for Neff. Finally
dialog: Keyes continues:
speaker_heading: KEYES
text: Look. A man takes out an accident
dialog: policy that is worth a hundred
dialog: thousand dollars if he is killed on
text: a train. Then, two weeks later, he
text: is killed on a train. And not in a
dialog: train accident, mind you, but falling
dialog: off some silly observation car. Do
dialog: you know what the mathematical
dialog: probability of that is, Walter? One
dialog: out of I don't know how many billions.
dialog: And add to that the broken leg. It
dialog: just can't be the way it looks,
dialog: Walter. Something has been worked on
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Such as what?
text: Keyes doesn't answer. He goes on pacing up and down. Finally
text: Neff can't stand the silence any longer.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Murder?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: (Prods stomach again)
dialog: Don't you have any peppermint or
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: Who do you suspect?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Maybe I like to make things easy for
dialog: myself. But I always tend to suspect
dialog: the beneficiary.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: The wife?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Yeah. That wide-eyed dame that didn't
dialog: know anything about anything.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: You're crazy, Keyes. She wasn't even
text: on the train.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: I know she wasn't, Walter. I don't
dialog: claim to know how it was worked, or
dialog: who worked it, but I know that it
dialog: was worked.
text: He crosses to the corridor door.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: I've got to get to a drug store. It
text: feels like a hunk of concrete inside
dialog: me.
text: He puts his hand on the knob to open the door.
scene_heading: C-11 CORRIDOR - APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT - LIGHTS ON
text: The hallway is empty except for Phyllis who has been standing
text: close to the door of Neff's apartment, listening. The door
text: has just started to open. Phyllis moves away quickly and
text: flattens herself against the wall behind the opening door.
text: Keyes is coming out.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Good night, Walter.
text: Neff, behind him, looks anxiously down the hallway for
text: Phyllis. Suddenly his eye catches a glimpse of her through
text: the crack of the partly opened door. He pushes the door wide
dialog: so as to hide her from Keyes.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Good night, Keyes.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: See you at the office in the morning.
text: He has reached the elevator. He pushes the call button and
dialog: turns.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: But I'd like to move in on her right
dialog: now, tonight, if it wasn't for Norton
dialog: and his stripe-pants ideas about
dialog: company policy. I'd have the cops
dialog: after her so quick her head would
dialog: spin. They'd put her through the
dialog: wringer, and, brother, what they
dialog: would squeeze out.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Only you haven't got a single thing
dialog: to go on, Keyes.
text: The elevator has come up and stopped.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Not too much. Twenty-six years
dialog: experience, all the percentage there
dialog: is, and this lump of concrete in my
dialog: stomach.
text: He pulls back the elevator door and turns to Neff with one
text: last glance of annoyance.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: (Almost angrily)
dialog: No bicarbonate of soda.
text: Keyes gets into the elevator. The door closes. The elevator
text: goes down.
text: Neff stands numb, looking at the spot where Keyes was last
text: visible. Without moving his eyes he pulls the door around
text: towards him with his left hand. Phyllis slowly comes out.
text: Neff motions quickly to her to go into the apartment. She
text: crosses in front of him and enters. He steps in backwards
dialog: after her.
scene_heading: C-12 INT. NEFF'S APARTMENT
text: Phyllis has come a few steps into the room. Neff, backing in
text: after her, closes the door from inside and turns slowly.
text: They look at each other for a long moment in complete silence.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: How much does he know?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: It's not what he knows. It's those
text: stinking hunches of his.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: But he can't prove anything, can he?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Not if we're careful. Not if we don't
dialog: see each other for a while.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: For how long a while?
text: She moves toward him but he does not respond.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Until all this dies down. You don't
dialog: know Keyes the way I do. Once he
dialog: gets his teeth into something he
dialog: won't let go. He'll investigate you.
dialog: He'll have you shadowed. He'll watch
dialog: you every minute from now on. Are
dialog: you afraid, baby?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Yes, I'm afraid. But not of Keyes.
dialog: I'm afraid of us. We're not the same
dialog: any more. We did it so we could be
dialog: together, but instead of that it's
dialog: pulling us apart. Isn't it, Walter?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: And you don't really care whether we
dialog: see each other or not.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Shut up, baby.
text: He pulls her close and kisses her.

scene_heading: D-1 INSURANCE OFFICE - TWELFTH FLOOR - ANTEROOM - (DAY)
text: Two telephone operators and a receptionist are at work.
text: Several visitors are waiting in chairs. Lola Dietrichson is
text: one of them. She's wearing a simple black suit and hat,
text: indicating mourning. Her fingers nervously pick at a
text: handkerchief and her eyes are watching the elevator doors
dialog: anxiously.
text: (Now and then the telephone operators in the background are
text: heard saying, "PACIFIC ALL-RISK. GOOD AFTERNOON.")
text: The elevator comes up and the doors open. Several people
text: come out, among them Neff, carrying his briefcase. Lola sees
text: him and stands up, and as he is about to pass through the
text: anteroom without recognizing her she stops him.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Hello, Mr. Neff.
text: Neff looks at her a little startled.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Hello.
text: His voice hangs in the air.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Lola Dietrichson. Don't you remember
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: (On his guard)
dialog: Yes. Of course.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Could I talk to you, just for a few
dialog: minutes? Somewhere where we can be
dialog: alone?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Sure. Come on into my office.
text: He pushes the swing door open and holds it for her. As she
text: passes in front of him his eyes narrow in uneasy speculation.
scene_heading: D-2 TWELFTH FLOOR - BALCONY
text: Neff comes up level with Lola and leads her towards his
text: office, CAMERA WITH THEM.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Is it something to do with -- what
dialog: happened?
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Yes, Mr. Neff. It's about my father's
dialog: death.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I'm terribly sorry, Miss Dietrichson.
text: He opens the door of his office and holds it for her. She
text: enters.
scene_heading: D-3 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE - (DAY)
text: Lou Schwartz, one of the other salesmen, is working at his
text: desk. Lola enters, Neff after her.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: (To Schwartz)
dialog: Lou, do you mind if I use the office
dialog: alone for a few minutes?
speaker_heading: SCHWARTZ
dialog: It's all yours, Walter.
text: He gets up and goes out. Lola has walked over to the window
text: and is looking out so Schwartz won't stare at her. Neff places
text: a chair beside his desk.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Won't you sit down?
text: At the sound of the closing door she turns and speaks with a
text: catch in her voice.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Mr. Neff, I can't help it, but I
dialog: have such a strange feeling that
dialog: there is something queer about my
dialog: father's death.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Queer? Queer in what way?
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: I don't know why I should be bothering
dialog: you with my troubles, except that
dialog: you knew my father and knew about
dialog: the insurance he took out. And you
dialog: were so nice to me that evening in
dialog: your car.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Sure. We got along fine, didn't we.
text: He sits down. His face is grim and watchful.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Look at me, Mr. Neff. I'm not crazy.
dialog: I'm not hysterical. I'm not even
dialog: crying. But I have the awful feeling
dialog: that something is wrong, and I had
dialog: the same feeling once before -- when
dialog: my mother died.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: When your mother died?
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: We were up at Lake Arrowhead. That
dialog: was six years ago. We had a cabin
dialog: there. It was winter and very cold
dialog: and my mother was very sick with
text: pneumonia. She had a nurse with her.
dialog: There were just the three of us in
dialog: the cabin. One night I got up and
dialog: went into my mother's room. She was
text: delirious with fever. All the bed
text: covers were on the floor and the
text: windows were wide open. The nurse
text: wasn't in the room. I ran and covered
dialog: my mother up as quickly as I could.
text: Just then I heard a door open behind
text: me. The nurse stood there. She didn't
dialog: say a word, but there was a look in
dialog: her eyes I'll never forget. Two days
dialog: later my mother was dead.
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: Do you know who that nurse was?
text: Neff stares at her tensely. He knows only too well who the
dialog: nurse was.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: No. Who?
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Phyllis. I tried to tell my father,
dialog: but I was just a kid then and he
dialog: wouldn't listen to me. Six months
dialog: later she married him and I kind of
dialog: talked myself out of the idea that
dialog: she could have done anything like
dialog: that. But now it's all back again,
dialog: now that something has happened to
dialog: my father, too.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: You're not making sense, Miss
dialog: Dietrichson. Your father fell off a
dialog: train.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Yes, and two days before he fell off
dialog: that train what was Phyllis doing?
text: She was in her room in front of a
text: mirror, with a black hat on, and she
text: was pinning a black veil to it, as
dialog: if she couldn't wait to see how she
dialog: would look in mourning.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Look. You've had a pretty bad shock.
dialog: Aren't you just imagining all this?
speaker_heading: LOLA
text: I caught her eyes in the mirror, and
dialog: they had that look in them they had
dialog: before my mother died. That same
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: You don't like your step-mother, do
dialog: you? Isn't it just because she is
dialog: your step-mother?
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: I loathe her. Because she did it.
dialog: She did it for the money. Only you're
dialog: not going to pay her, are you, Mr.
dialog: Neff? She's not going to get away
dialog: with it this time. I'm going to speak
dialog: up. I'm going to tell everything I
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: You'd better be careful, saying things
dialog: like that.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: I'm not afraid. You'll see.
text: She turns again to the window so he won't see that she is
text: crying. Neff gets up and goes to her.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to act like
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: All this that you've been telling me --
dialog: who else have you told?
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: No one.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: How about your step-mother?
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Of course not. I'm not living in the
dialog: house any more. I moved out.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: And you didn't tell that boy-friend
dialog: of yours? Zachetti.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: I'm not seeing him any more. We had
dialog: a fight.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Where are you living then?
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: I got myself a little apartment in
dialog: Hollywood.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Four walls, and you just sit and
dialog: look at them, huh?

speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE
dialog: Next day was Sunday and we went for

dialog: loosened up a bit and she was even

dialog: had no chance to talk to Phyllis.

text: Neff, with his hat on and no briefcase, is walking toward

text: the door sits a familiar figure. He is Jackson, the man from
text: the observation platform of the train. He is wearing his
text: Stetson hat and smoking a cigar. He is studying something in
text: the file folder. Neff recognizes him immediately but Jackson
text: does not look up. Neff controls his expression and goes on
text: to open the door to Keyes' office.
speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE
dialog: Monday morning there was a note on

scene_heading: D-7 INT. KEYES' OFFICE
text: Neff is just closing the door from the inside. Keyes, his

dialog: as usual.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Come in. Come in, Walter. I want to
dialog: ask you something. After all the
dialog: years we've known each other, do you
dialog: mind if I make a rather blunt
dialog: statement?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: About me. Walter, I'm a very great
dialog: man. This Dietrichson business. It's
dialog: murder, and murders don't come any
dialog: neater. As fancy a piece of homicide
dialog: as anybody ever ran into. Smart and
dialog: tricky and almost perfect, but --
text: Keyes bounces off the couch like a rubber ball.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: but, I think Papa has it all figured
text: out, figured out and wrapped up in
text: tissue paper with pink ribbons on
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I'm listening.
text: Keyes levels a finger at him.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: You know what? That guy Dietrichson
dialog: was never on the train.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: He wasn't?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: No, he wasn't, Walter. Look, you
dialog: can't be sure of killing a man by
text: throwing him off a train that's going
dialog: fifteen miles an hour. The only way
dialog: you can be sure is to kill him first
text: and then throw his body on the tracks.
dialog: That would mean either killing him
dialog: on the train, or -- and this is where
dialog: it really gets fancy -- you kill him
dialog: somewhere else and put him on the
dialog: tracks. Two possibilities, and I
dialog: personally buy the second.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: You're way ahead of me, Keyes.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Look, it was like this. They killed
dialog: the guy -- the wife and somebody
dialog: else -- and then the somebody else
dialog: took the crutches and went on the
dialog: train as Dietrichson, and then the
dialog: somebody else jumped off, and then
text: they put the body on the tracks where
text: the train had passed. An
dialog: impersonation, see. And a cinch to
dialog: work. Because it was night, very few
dialog: people were about, they had the
text: crutches to stare at, and they never
dialog: really looked at the man at all.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: It's fancy all right, Keyes. Maybe
dialog: it's a little too fancy.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Is it? I tell you it fits together
dialog: like a watch. And now let's see what
dialog: we have in the way of proof. The
dialog: only guy that really got a good look
dialog: at this supposed Dietrichson is
dialog: sitting right outside my office. I
dialog: took the trouble to bring him down
dialog: here from Oregon. Let's see what he
dialog: has to say.
text: Keyes goes to the door and opens it.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Come in, Mr. Jackson.
text: Jackson enters with the file folder.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Yes sir, Mr. Keyes. These are fine
dialog: cigars you smoke.
text: He indicates the cigar he himself is smoking.
speaker_heading: KEYES
text: Two for a quarter.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: That's what I said.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Never mind the cigar, Jackson. Did
dialog: you study those photographs? What do
dialog: you say?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Yes, indeed, I studied them
dialog: thoroughly. Very thoroughly
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Well? Did you make up your mind?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man. Medford,
dialog: Oregon. Up in Medford we take our
dialog: time making up our minds --
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Well you're not in Medford now. I'm
dialog: in a hurry. Let's have it.
text: Jackson indicates the file folder he is holding.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Are these photographs of the late
dialog: Mr. Dietrichson?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Then my answer is no.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: What do you mean no?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: I mean this is not the man that was
text: on the train.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Will you swear to that?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: I'm a Medford man. Medford, Oregon.
dialog: And if I say it, I mean it, and if I
dialog: mean it, of course I'll swear it.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Thank you.
text: Keyes turns to Neff.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: There you are, Walter. There's your
dialog: proof.
text: Keyes remembers he forgot to introduce Jackson.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Oh, Mr. Jackson, this is Mr. Neff,
dialog: one of our salesmen.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Please to meet you, Mr. Neff. Pleased
dialog: indeed.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: How do you do.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Very fine, thank you. Never was
dialog: better.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Mr. Jackson, how would you describe
dialog: the man you saw on that observation
dialog: platform?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Well, I'm pretty sure he was a younger
dialog: man, about ten or fifteen years
dialog: younger than the man in these
dialog: photographs.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Dietrichson was about fifty, wasn't
dialog: he, Walter?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Fifty-one, according to the policy.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: The man I saw was nothing like fifty-
dialog: one years old. Of course, it was
dialog: pretty dark on that platform and,
dialog: come to think of it, he tried to
dialog: keep his back towards me. But I'm
text: positive just the same.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: That's fine, Jackson. Now you
dialog: understand this matter is strictly
dialog: confidential. We may need you again
dialog: down here in Los Angeles, if the
text: case comes to court.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Any time you need me, I'm at your
dialog: entire disposal, gentlemen. Expenses
dialog: paid, of course.
text: Keyes picks up the telephone on his desk and speaks into it.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Get me Lubin, in the cashier's office.
text: Meanwhile, Jackson crosses over to Neff and, during the
text: ensuing dialogue between him and Neff, we hear Keyes' low
text: voice on the phone in background. We do not hear what he
dialog: says.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: (To Neff)
dialog: Ever been in Medford, Mr. Neff?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Never.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Wait a minute. Do you go trout
dialog: fishing? Maybe I saw you up Klamath
dialog: Falls way.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Nope. Never fish.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Neff. Neff. I've got it! It's the
dialog: name. There's a family of Neffs in
dialog: Corvallis.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: No relation.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Let me see. This man's an automobile
dialog: dealer in Corvallis. Very reputable
dialog: man, too, I'm told.
text: Keyes rejoins them at this point.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: All right, Mr. Jackson. Suppose you
dialog: go down to the cashier's office --
dialog: room twenty-seven on the eleventh
dialog: floor. They'll take care of your
dialog: expense account and your ticket for
dialog: the train tonight.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Tonight? Tomorrow morning would suit
dialog: me better. There's a very good
dialog: osteopath down here I want to see
dialog: before I leave.
text: Keyes has opened the door for Jackson.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Okay, Mr. Jackson. Just don't put
text: her on the expense account.
dialog: Jackson doesn't get it.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Goodbye, gentlemen. A pleasure.
text: He goes out.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: There it is, Walter. It's beginning
text: to come apart at the seams already.
dialog: A murder's never perfect. It always
dialog: comes apart sooner or later. And
dialog: when two people are involved it's
dialog: usually sooner. We know the
text: Dietrichson dame is in it, and
dialog: somebody else. Pretty soon we're
dialog: going to know who that somebody else
dialog: is. He'll show. He's got to show.
dialog: Sometime, somewhere, they've got to
text: meet. Their emotions are all kicked
dialog: up. Whether it's love or hate doesn't
dialog: matter. They can't keep away from
dialog: each other. They think it's twice as
dialog: safe because there are two of them.
dialog: But it's not twice as safe. It's ten
dialog: times twice as dangerous. They've
dialog: committed a murder and that's not
dialog: like taking a trolley ride together
dialog: where each one can get off at a
dialog: different stop. They're stuck with
dialog: each other. They've got to ride all
dialog: the way to the end of the line. And
dialog: it's a one-way trip, and the last
dialog: stop is the cemetery.
text: He puts a cigar in his mouth and starts tapping his pockets
dialog: for matches.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: (Continued)
dialog: She put in her claim and I'm going
text: to throw it right back at her.
dialog: (Pats his pockets
dialog: again)
dialog: Have you got one of those?
text: Neff strikes a match for him. Keyes takes the match out of
text: his hand and lights his cigar.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Let her sue us if she dares. I'll be
dialog: ready for her -- and that somebody
dialog: else. They'll be digging their own

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: What's he got to stop me?

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Prove it how? Listen, if he rejects

speaker_heading: NEFF

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Yes, she's been putting on an act
dialog: for you, crying all over your
dialog: shoulder, that lying little --
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Keep her out of it. All I'm telling
dialog: you is we're not going to sue.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Because you don't want the money any
dialog: more, even if you could get it?
dialog: Because she's made you feel like a
dialog: heel all of sudden.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: It isn't the money any more. It's
dialog: our necks now. We're pulling out,
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Because of what Keyes can do? You're
dialog: not fooling me, Walter. It's because
dialog: of Lola. What you did to her father.
dialog: You can't take it that she might
dialog: find out some day.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I said, leave her out of it.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Walter, it's me I'm talking about. I

speaker_heading: NEFF

dialog: through with it, that's all.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: We have gone through with it, Walter.
dialog: The tough part is all behind us. We
dialog: just have to hold on now and not go

dialog: away.
speaker_heading: NEFF

speaker_heading: NEFF

speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: I don't like them. They always explode
dialog: in my pockets. So long, Walter.
text: Keyes goes toward the street and OUT OF SCENE. Neff moves
text: back into the lobby, CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM. As he reaches the
text: elevator, he looks back over his shoulder, to make sure Keyes
text: is gone, then steps into the empty elevator.
speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE
dialog: You sure had me worried, Keyes. I
dialog: didn't know if you were playing cat-
dialog: and-mouse with me, whether you knew
dialog: all along I was the somebody else.
dialog: That's what I had to find out, and I
dialog: thought I knew where to look...
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: (To elevator operator)
dialog: Twelve.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: D-14 ENTRANCE - OFFICE. 12TH FLOOR RECEPTION ROOM (DAY)
text: Neff comes out of the elevator. The receptionist is just
text: tidying up her desk. She has her hat on and is preparing to
text: leave. Neff passes on through the swinging doors to the
text: twelfth floor balcony.
speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE
text: Upstairs, the last of the people
dialog: were just leaving.
scene_heading: D-15 12TH FLOOR BALCONY
text: Neff enters from the reception room. A couple of belated
text: employees are leaving for the day. Neff goes toward Keyes'
text: office, looks around to make sure he is unobserved, enters.
speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE
dialog: I made sure nobody saw me go into
dialog: your office.
speaker_heading: D-16 KEYES' OFFICE (DAY)
text: Neff has just come in. He goes over to Keyes' desk and
text: searches the papers on it. He tries the desk drawers and
text: finds them locked. His eye falls on the dictaphone on the
text: stand beside the desk. A record is on it, the needle is about
text: two-thirds of the way towards the end. He lifts the needle
text: and sets it back to the beginning of the record, sets the
text: switch to playback position. He lifts the arm off the bracket
text: and starts the machine. Keyes' voice is heard coming from
dialog: the horn:
speaker_heading: KEYES' VOICE
dialog: (From Dictaphone)
text: Memo to Mr. Norton. Confidential.
dialog: Dietrichson File. With regard to
dialog: your proposal to put Walter Neff
dialog: under surveillance, I disagree
dialog: absolutely. I have investigated his
dialog: movements on the night of the crime,
dialog: and he is definitely placed in his
text: apartment from 7:15 P.M. on. In
dialog: addition to this, I have known Neff
dialog: intimately for eleven years, and I
dialog: personally vouch for him, without
dialog: reservation...
text: Neff stops the machine. He sits down slowly, still holding
text: the horn. He is deeply moved. After a moment, he presses the
dialog: switch again.
speaker_heading: KEYES' VOICE
dialog: (From Dictaphone)
dialog: ...Furthermore, no connection
dialog: whatsoever has been established
dialog: between Walter Neff and Mrs. Phyllis
dialog: Dietrichson, whereas I am now able
dialog: to report that such a connection has
dialog: been established between her and
dialog: another man. This man has been
dialog: observed to visit the Dietrichson
dialog: home on the night of July 9th, 10th,
dialog: 11th, 12th and 13th. We have succeeded
dialog: in identifying him as one Nino
dialog: Zachetti, former medical student,
text: aged twenty-eight, residing at Lilac
dialog: Court Apartments 1228½ N. La Brea
dialog: Avenue. We have checked Zachetti's
dialog: movements on the night of the crime
dialog: and have found that they cannot be
dialog: accounted for. I am preparing a more
dialog: detailed report for your consideration
dialog: and it is my belief that we already
dialog: have sufficient evidence against
dialog: Zachetti and Mrs. Dietrichson to
dialog: justify police action. I strongly
dialog: urge that this whole matter be turned
dialog: over to the office of the District
text: Attorney. Respectfully, Barton Keyes.
text: Neff sits, staring blankly at the wall. The cylinder goes on
text: revolving, but no more voice comes -- only the whir of the
text: needle on the empty record. At last he remembers to replace
text: the horn. He hangs it back on its hook. The machine stops.
text: Neff gets up from the chair, walks slowly to the door and
text: goes out.
scene_heading: D-17 12TH FLOOR, BALCONY
text: Neff has just come out of Keyes' office. He walks slowly
text: back towards the reception room entrance, then stands there
text: looking out through the glass doors. All the employees have
text: now left. Neff is entirely alone. He moves as if to go out,
text: then stops rigidly as his face lights up with excitement of
text: a sudden idea. He turns quickly and walks on to his own office
text: and enters.
speaker_heading: D-18 NEFF'S OFFICE (DAY)
text: Neff walks across to his desk, lifts the telephone and dials
text: a number. (During the ensuing telephone conversation, only
text: what he says is heard. The pauses indicate speeches at the
dialog: other end of the line).
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Phyllis? Walter. I've got to see
dialog: you... Tonight... Yes, it has to be
dialog: tonight... How's eleven o'clock?
dialog: Don't worry about Keyes. He's
dialog: satisfied... Leave the door on the
dialog: latch and put the lights out. No,
dialog: nobody's watching the house... I
dialog: told you Keyes is satisfied. It's
dialog: just for the neighbors... That's
dialog: what I said. Yeah. Eleven o'clock.
dialog: Goodbye, baby.
text: Neff hangs up and stands beside the desk with a grim
text: expression on his face, takes a handkerchief out and wipes
text: perspiration from his forehead and the palms of his hands.
text: The gesture has a symbolic quality, as if he were trying to
text: wipe away the murder. Over his face comes the commentary.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE
dialog: I guess I don't have to tell you
dialog: what I was going to do at eleven
dialog: o'clock, Keyes. For the first time I
dialog: saw a way to get clear of the whole
dialog: mess I was in, and of Phyllis, too,
dialog: all at the same time. Yeah, that's
dialog: what I thought. But what I didn't
dialog: know was that she was all set for
dialog: me. That she had outsmarted me again,
dialog: just like she always had...
scene_heading: D-19 HALL STAIRWAY OF DIETRICHSON HOME (NIGHT)
text: The lights are turned on. Phyllis is coming down the stairs.
text: She wears white lounging pajamas, and she is carrying
text: something small and heavy concealed in a scarf in her right
text: hand. She reaches the front door, opens it slightly, fixes
text: the catch so that the door can be opened from outside. She
text: switches off the porch light and the hall light. She moves
text: towards the living room, where there is still light on.
speaker_heading: NEFF'S VOICE
text: She was all set and waiting for me.
dialog: It could have been something in my
dialog: voice when I called her up that tipped
dialog: her off. And it could have been that
dialog: she had the idea already. And an
dialog: idea wasn't the only thing she had
dialog: waiting for me.
speaker_heading: D-20 LIVING ROOM
text: On the long table behind the davenport, one of the lamps is
text: lit. The only other light in the room is a standing lamp
text: beside the desk. A window toward the back is open, and through
text: it comes the SOUNDS OF MUSIC, probably a neighboring radio.
text: Phyllis enters and crosses to the table. She puts out the
text: lamp, then moves over to the desk and puts out the lamp there.
text: The room is filled with bright moonlight coming in at the
dialog: windows.
text: Phyllis crosses to the chair by the fireplace (the one she
text: sat in the first time Neff came to the house). She lifts the
text: loose cushion and puts what was in the scarf behind it. As
text: she withdraws the scarf, there is a brief glint of something
text: metallic before she covers the hidden object with the cushion
dialog: again.
text: She turns to the low table in front of the davenport and
text: takes a cigarette from the box. She takes a match and is
text: about to strike it when, just then, she hears a car coming
text: up the hill. She listens, motionless. The car stops. A car
text: door is slammed.
text: Calmly, Phyllis strikes the match and lights her cigarette.
text: She drops the match casually into a tray, goes back to the
text: chair, sits down and waits, quietly smoking. There are
text: footsteps outside the house.
text: Over the chair in which Phyllis is sitting, the hallway is
text: visible through the arch. The front door opens. Neff comes
text: in, he is silhouetted against the moonlight as he stands
text: there. He closes the door again.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: (In foreground)
dialog: In here, Walter.
text: Neff comes through the arch and walks slowly towards her.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Hello, baby. Anybody else in the
dialog: house?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Nobody. Why?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: What's that music?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
text: A radio up the street.
text: Neff sits down on the arm of the davenport, close to her.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Just like the first time I was here.
dialog: We were talking about automobile
dialog: insurance. Only you were thinking
dialog: about murder. And I was thinking
dialog: about that anklet.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: And what are you thinking about now?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I'm all through thinking. This is
dialog: goodbye.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Goodbye? Where are you going?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: It's you that's going, baby. Not me.
dialog: I'm getting off the trolley car right
dialog: at this corner.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Suppose you stop being fancy. Let's
dialog: have it, whatever it is.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I have a friend who's got a funny
dialog: theory. He says when two people commit
dialog: a murder they're kind of on a trolley
dialog: car, and one can't get off without
dialog: the other. They're stuck with each
dialog: other. They have to go on riding
text: clear to the end of the line. And
text: the last stop is the cemetery.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Maybe he's got something there.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: You bet he has, Two people are going
dialog: to ride to the end of the line, all
dialog: right. Only I'm not going to be one
dialog: of them. I've got another guy to
dialog: finish my ride for me.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: So you've got it all arranged, Walter.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: You arranged it for me. I didn't
dialog: have to do a thing.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Just who are you talking about?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: An acquaintance of yours. A Mr.
dialog: Zachetti. Come on, baby, I just got
dialog: into this because I knew a little
dialog: something about insurance, didn't I?
dialog: I was just a sucker. I'd have been
dialog: brushed-off as soon as you got your
text: hands on the money.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Save it. I'm telling this. It's been
dialog: you and that Zachetti guy all along,
dialog: hasn't it?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: That's not true.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: It doesn't make any difference whether
dialog: it's true or not. The point is Keyes
dialog: believes Zachetti is the guy he's
dialog: been looking for. He'll have him in
dialog: that gas chamber before he knows
dialog: what happened to him.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: And what's happening to me all this
dialog: time?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Don't be silly. What do you expect
dialog: to happen to you? You helped him do
dialog: the murder, didn't you? That's what
dialog: Keyes thinks. And what's good enough
dialog: for Keyes is good enough for me.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Maybe it's not good enough for me.
dialog: Walter. Maybe I don't go for the
dialog: idea. Maybe I'd rather talk.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Sometimes people are where they can't
text: talk. Under six feet of dirt, for
dialog: instance. And if it was you, they'd
dialog: just charge it up to Zachetti,
dialog: wouldn't they. One more item on his
dialog: account. Sure they would. That's
dialog: just what they're going to do.
dialog: Especially since he's coming here,
dialog: tonight... Oh, in about fifteen
dialog: minutes from now, baby. With the
text: cops right behind him. It's all taken
dialog: care of.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: And that'd make everything lovely
dialog: for you, wouldn't it?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Right. And it's got to be done before
dialog: that suit of yours comes to trial,
text: and Lola gets a chance to sound off,
dialog: and they trip you up on the stand,
dialog: and you start to fold up and drag me
dialog: down with you.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Listen, Walter. Maybe I had Zachetti
dialog: here so they won't get a chance to
dialog: trip me up. So we can get that money
dialog: and be together.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: That's cute. Say it again.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: He came here the first time just to
dialog: ask where Lola was. I made him come
dialog: back. I was working on him. He's
dialog: crazy sort of guy, quick-tempered. I
text: kept hammering into him that she was
dialog: with another man, so he'd get into
text: one of his jealous rages, and then
dialog: I'd tell him where she was. And you
dialog: know what he'd have done to her,
dialog: don't you, Walter.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Yeah, and for once I believe you.
dialog: Because it's just rotten enough.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: We're both rotten, Walter.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Only you're just a little more rotten.
dialog: You're rotten clear through. You got
dialog: me to take care of your husband, and
dialog: then you got Zachetti to take care
dialog: of Lola, and maybe take care of me
dialog: too, and then somebody else would
dialog: have come along to take care of
dialog: Zachetti for you. That's the way you
dialog: operate isn't it, baby.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Suppose it is, Walter. Is what you've
dialog: cooked up for tonight any better?
text: Neff gets up from the davenport. He listens to the music for
dialog: a moment.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I don't like this music anymore.
dialog: It's too close. Do you mind if I
dialog: shut the window?
text: Phyllis just stares at him. He goes quietly over to the window
text: and shuts it and draws the curtain. Phyllis speaks to his
dialog: back:
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: (Her voice low and
dialog: urgent)
dialog: Walter!
text: Neff turns, something changes in his face. There is the report
text: of a gun. He stands motionless for a moment, then very slowly
text: starts towards her. CAMERA IS SHOOTING OVER HIS SHOULDER at
text: Phyllis as she stands with the gun in her hand. Neff stops
text: after he has taken a few steps.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: What's the matter? Why don't you
dialog: shoot again? Maybe if I came a little
dialog: closer?
text: Neff takes a few more steps towards her and stops again.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: How's that. Do you think you can do
dialog: it now?
text: Phyllis is silent. She doesn't shoot. Her expression is
text: tortured. Neff goes on until he is close to her. Quietly he
text: takes the gun out of her unresisting hand.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Why didn't you shoot, baby?
text: Phyllis puts her arms around him in complete surrender.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Don't tell me it's because you've
dialog: been in love with me all this time.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: No. I never loved you, Walter. Not
dialog: you, or anybody else. I'm rotten to
dialog: the heart. I used you, just as you
dialog: said. That's all you ever meant to
dialog: me -- until a minute ago. I didn't
dialog: think anything like that could ever
dialog: happen to me.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I'm sorry, baby. I'm not buying.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I'm not asking you to buy. Just hold
dialog: me close.
text: Neff draws her close to him. She reaches up to his face and
text: kisses him on the lips. As she comes out of the kiss there
text: is realization in her eyes that this is the final moment.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Goodbye, baby.
text: Out of the shot the gun explodes once, twice. Phyllis quivers
text: in his arms. Her eyes fill with tears. Her head falls limp
text: against his shoulder. Slowly he lifts her and carries her to
text: the davenport. He lays her down on it carefully, almost
text: tenderly. The moonlight coming in at the French doors shines
text: on the anklet. He looks at it for the last time and slowly
text: turns away. As he does so, he puts his hand inside his coat
text: and it comes out with blood on it. Only then is it apparent
text: that Phyllis' shot actually did hit him. He looks at the
text: blood on his fingers with a dazed expression and quickly
text: goes out of the room, the way he came.
scene_heading: D-21 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOME - (NIGHT)
text: Neff comes out of the house. He closes the front door with
text: his right hand. His left arm hangs limp. He takes a few steps
text: down the walk, then suddenly hears somebody approaching. He
text: moves behind the palm tree near the walk.
text: A man comes up the steps towards the front door -- Zachetti.
text: Just as he reaches the door, Neff calls to him.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Hey you. Come here a minute. I said
dialog: come here, Zachetti.
text: Zachetti turns and approaches him slowly.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: The name is Neff.
speaker_heading: ZACHETTI
dialog: Yeah? And I still don't like it.
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Look, kid, I want to give you a
dialog: present.
text: He takes some loose change out of his pocket and holds out a
dialog: coin.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Here's a nice new nickel.
speaker_heading: ZACHETTI
dialog: What's the gag?
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Suppose you go back down the hill to
text: a drug store and make a phone call.
text: Neff starts to drop the nickel into Zachetti's handkerchief
text: pocket. Zachetti knocks his hand away.
speaker_heading: ZACHETTI
dialog: Keep your nickel and buy yourself an
dialog: ice cream cone.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: The number is Granite 0386. Ask for
dialog: Miss Dietrichson. The first name is
dialog: Lola.
speaker_heading: ZACHETTI
dialog: Lola? She isn't worth a nickel. And
dialog: if I ever talk to her, it's not going
dialog: to be over any telephone.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Tough, aren't you? Take the nickel.
dialog: Take it and call her. She wants you
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: ZACHETTI
dialog: Yeah? She doesn't want any part of
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I know who told you that, and it's
dialog: not true. She's in love with you.
dialog: Always has been. Don't ask me why. I
dialog: couldn't even guess.
text: Zachetti just stares at him. Neff moves again to put the
text: nickel into Zachetti's pocket. This time Zachetti allows him
dialog: to do it.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Now beat it. Granite 0386, I told
dialog: you.
text: He motions toward the street below.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: That way.
text: Zachetti goes slowly past him. Neff grabs him and pushes him
text: almost violently down the walk. Zachetti goes out of shot.
text: The sound of his steps dies away as Neff looks after him.
text: Then, far off in the distance, the SIREN OF A POLICE CAR is
dialog: heard.
text: Neff moves off through the shrubbery toward the side of the
text: house where he parked his car.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: D-22 NEFF'S OFFICE - (NIGHT)
text: The desk lamp is still lighted. Outside the windows, the
text: dawn is slowly breaking.
text: Neff is still clutching the horn of the dictaphone. There
text: are eight or nine used cylinders on the desk beside him. A
text: widening stain of blood shows on the left shoulder of his
text: gray jacket. He is very weak by now, and his voice holds a
text: note of utter exhaustion.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: It's almost four-thirty now, Keyes.
text: It's cold. I wonder if she's still
dialog: lying there alone in that house, or
dialog: whether they've found her by now. I
dialog: wonder a lot of things, but they
dialog: don't matter any more, except I want
dialog: to ask you to do me a favor. I want
dialog: you to be the one to tell Lola, kind
text: of gently, before it breaks wide
dialog: open... Yes, and I'd like you to
dialog: look after her and that guy Zachetti,
dialog: so he doesn't get pushed around too
dialog: much. Because...
text: Suddenly he stops his dictation with an instinctive feeling
text: that he is not alone in the room.
text: As he turns in his chair the CAMERA PULLS BACK slowly. The
text: office door is wide open. Keyes is standing a few steps inside
text: it. Behind him, on the balcony outside, stands the night
text: watchman and the colored janitor, peering curiously into the
text: room over Keyes' shoulder.
text: Slowly, and without taking his eyes off Neff's face, Keyes
text: reaches back and pushes the door shut.
text: Neff hangs up the dictaphone horn. He looks at Keyes with a
text: faint, tired grin and speaks very slowly.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Hello, Keyes.
text: Keyes moves towards him a few steps and stands without
dialog: answering.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Up pretty early, aren't you? I always
dialog: wondered what time you got down to
dialog: work.
text: Keyes, staring at him, still does not answer.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Or did your little man pull you out
dialog: of bed?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: The janitor did. Seems you leaked a
dialog: little blood on the way in here.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Wouldn't be surprised.
text: Neff makes a motion indicating the used cylinders standing
text: on the desk.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I wanted to straighten out that
dialog: Dietrichson story for you.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: So I gather.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: How long have you been standing there?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Long enough.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Kind of a crazy story with a crazy
dialog: twist to it. One you didn't quite
dialog: figure out.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: You can't figure them all, Walter.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: That's right. You can't, can you?
dialog: And now I suppose I get the big
dialog: speech, the one with all the two-
dialog: dollar words in it. Let's have it,
dialog: Keyes.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: You're all washed up, Walter.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Thanks, Keyes. That was short anyway.
text: They stare at each other for a long moment, then, with intense
text: effort Neff gets up on his feet and stands there swaying a
text: little. His face is covered with sweat. His shoulder is
text: bleeding. He is on the verge of collapse.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Walter, I'm going to call a doctor.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: (Bitterly)
dialog: What for? So they can patch me up?
dialog: So they can nurse me along till I'm
dialog: back on my feet? So I can walk under
dialog: my own power into that gas chamber
dialog: up in San Quentin? Is that it, Keyes?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Something like that, Walter.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Well, I've got a different idea.
dialog: Look here. Suppose you went back to
dialog: bed and didn't find these cylinders
text: till tomorrow morning, when the office
dialog: opens. From then on you can play it
dialog: any way you like. Would you do that
dialog: much for me, Keyes?
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: Give me one good reason.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I need four hours to get where I'm
dialog: going.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: You're not going anywhere, Walter.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: You bet I am. I'm going across the
dialog: border.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: You haven't got a chance.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: Good enough to try for.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: You'll never make the border.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: That's what you think. Watch me.
text: Neff starts to move towards the door, staggering a little,
text: holding himself upright with great effort.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: (In a voice of stony
dialog: calm)
dialog: You'll never even make the elevator.
text: Neff has reached the door. He twists the knob and drags the
text: door open. He turns in it to look back at Keyes' implacable
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: So long, Keyes.
text: Neff goes out, leaving the door wide open. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS
text: his staggering walk along the BALCONY TOWARDS THE ELEVATOR
text: LOBBY. The sound of his breathing is so harsh and loud that
text: for a moment it dominates the scene. Finally he reaches the
text: swing doors leading into the lobby and starts to push them
text: open. At this moment he collapses. He clutches the edge of
text: the door and as it swings around with him he falls to the
text: floor. He tries to struggle up but cannot rise.
text: In background comes the sound of a telephone being dialed.
speaker_heading: KEYES' VOICE
dialog: Hello... Send an ambulance to the
dialog: Pacific Building on Olive Street...
dialog: Yeah... It's a police job.
text: There is the sound of the phone being replaced in its cradle.
text: Then there are footsteps growing louder along the balcony
text: and Keyes walks slowly into the shot. He kneels down beside
dialog: Neff.
speaker_heading: KEYES
dialog: How you doing, Walter?
text: Neff manages a faint smile.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I'm fine. Only somebody moved the
text: elevator a couple of miles away.
speaker_heading: KEYES
text: They're on the way.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: (Slowly and with great
dialog: difficulty)
dialog: You know why you didn't figure this
dialog: one, Keyes? Let me tell you. The guy
dialog: you were looking for was too close.
text: He was right across the desk from
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: KEYES
text: Closer than that, Walter.
text: The eyes of the two men meet in a moment of silence.
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: I love you too.
text: Neff fumbles for the handkerchief in Keyes' pocket, pulls it
text: out and clumsily wipes his face with it. The handkerchief
text: drops from his hand. He gets a loose cigarette out of his
text: pocket and puts it between his lips. Then with great
text: difficulty he gets out a match, tries to strike it, but is
text: too weak. Keyes takes the match out of his hand, strikes it
text: for him and lights his cigarette.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: THE END
dialog: 
dialog: The following pages are for an alternate ending that director

speaker_heading: KEYES

speaker_heading: NEFF

dialog: difficulty)
dialog: You know why you didn't figure this
dialog: one, Keyes? Let me tell you. The guy

dialog: you.
speaker_heading: KEYES
text: Closer than that, Walter.

scene_heading: E-1 WITNESS ROOM IN DEATH CHAMBER - SAN QUENTIN (DAY)
text: Showing the witness room and approximately one-half of the
text: gas chamber. BOOM SHOT towards guard standing BACK TO CAMERA
text: at entrance door. Except for this guard the room is empty.
text: Guard opens the door. Two other guards enter, followed by a
text: group of witnesses and newspaper men, each of whom removes
text: his hat as he enters the room. They form a group around the
text: outside of the gas chamber, some looking in through the glass
text: windows, some standing in the background on low platforms
text: against the wall.
text: THE CAMERA SLOWLY BEGINS TO MOVE IN AND DOWN, AND CENTERS ON
text: Keyes, as he enters the room and stands behind the door. His
text: face is seen through the bars of the door, which is then
text: closed, and CAMERA MOVES TO A CLOSEUP. His eyes follow the
text: action of the closing door, then slowly look towards the gas
dialog: chamber.
scene_heading: E-2 THE GAS CHAMBER, EMPTY
text: On its windows show reflections of the spectators, including
text: the face of Keyes.
text: The door to the gas chamber opens in the background, and
text: beyond that another door opens. Neff comes in between two
text: guards. He is wearing a white open-necked shirt, blue denim
text: pants, and walks barefooted on a cocoanut matting. He moves
text: into the gas chamber, looks through the windows in the
text: direction of Keyes and nods quickly, recognizing him. The
text: guards turn him around and seat him in one of the two metal
text: chairs, with his back to the witnesses. They strap his arms,
text: legs and body to the chair. The guards go out.
scene_heading: E-3 THE DOOR TO THE GAS CHAMBER
text: It is open. The three guards come out of the gas chamber
text: into the ante-chamber, where stand the warden, executioner,
text: two doctors, the minister and the acid man, and possibly
dialog: several guards.
text: The executioner and one guard close the door. The guard spins
text: the big wheel which tightens it. The wheel at first turns
text: very quickly, then, as it tightens, the guard uses
text: considerable force to seal the chamber tight. The guard steps
text: out of the shot. The gas chamber is now sealed.
scene_heading: E-4 THE WITNESSES AND KEYES
text: They are intently watching Neff in the gas chamber.
scene_heading: E-5 THE ANTE-CHAMBER
text: The warden looks slowly around the room, sees that everyone
text: is in his proper place and that the stethoscope, which one
text: doctor holds, is connected with the outlet in the wall of
text: the gas chamber. Also that the man in charge of the acid is
text: ready. The warden makes a motion to the acid man. The acid
text: man releases the mixed acid into a pipe connecting with a
text: countersunk receptacle under Neff's chair. (This action is
text: only suggested). The warden looks at the clock, then turns
text: to the executioner and nods.
scene_heading: E-6 THE EXECUTIONER - MED. SHOT - CAMERA SHOOTING DOWN FROM
scene_heading: HIGH ANGLE TOWARDS EXECUTIONER
text: He pushes a metal lever. (This immerses the pellets of cyanide
dialog: in the acid under the chair.)
scene_heading: E-7 INT. GAS CHAMBER - MED. SHOT
text: CAMERA IS SHOOTING ABOVE Neff's head (just out of shot),
text: towards spectators standing outside the gas chamber, Keyes
text: in the center. Gas floats up into scene between CAMERA and
text: spectators. Keyes, unable to watch, looks away.
scene_heading: E-8 THE FIRST DOCTOR - CLOSE SHOT
text: as he listens on stethoscope connected with the gas chamber.
text: He glances at the clock above his head.
scene_heading: E-9 THE SECOND DOCTOR - CLOSE SHOT
text: He stands to right of the gas chamber door, taking notes on
text: a pad. He glances towards First Doctor (out of scene) and
text: looks through venetian blinds into the gas chamber. The acid
text: man stands near him.
scene_heading: E-10 THE FIRST DOCTOR
text: CAMERA SHOOTING FROM HIGH ANGLE TOWARDS HIM as he listens on
text: stethoscope. The doctor glances at the clock again. He takes
text: his stethoscope from his ears. He nods to the warden, This
text: indicates that the man is dead. CAMERA PANS with warden as
text: he turns to open the door connecting the ante-chamber with
dialog: the witness room.
scene_heading: E-11 THE WITNESS ROOM - LONG SHOT FROM HIGH ON BOOM DOWN ON
scene_heading: WITNESSES GROUPED AROUND GAS CHAMBER

text: comes through.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: That's all, gentlemen, Vacate the
dialog: chamber, please.
text: The guard withdraws and closes the door by which he entered.
text: The witnesses slowly start to file out. A guard has opened
text: the outer door. The witnesses put their hats on as they pass
text: through. A few go close to the windows of the gas chamber to
text: look in at the dead man before they leave.
text: All the witnesses have now left, except Keyes, who stands,
text: shocked and tragic, beyond the door. The guard goes to him
text: and touches his arm, indicating to him that he must leave.
text: Keyes glances for the last time towards the gas chamber and
text: slowly moves to go out.
scene_heading: E-12 CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE DEATH CHAMBER
text: CAMERA SHOOTING IN THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR AT KEYES, who is
text: just turning to leave. Keyes comes slowly out into the dark,
text: narrow corridor. His hat is on his head now, his overcoat is
text: pulled around him loosely. He walks like an old man. He takes
text: eight or ten steps, then mechanically reaches a cigar out of
text: his vest pocket and puts it in his mouth. His hands, in the
text: now familiar gesture, begin to pat his pockets for matches.
text: Suddenly he stops, with a look of horror on his face. He
text: stands rigid, pressing a hand against his heart. He takes
text: the cigar out of his mouth and goes slowly on towards the
text: door, CAMERA PANNING with him. When he has almost reached
text: the door, the guard stationed there throws it wide, and a
text: blaze of sunlight comes in from the prison yard outside.
text: Keyes slowly walks out into the sunshine. stiffly, his head
text: bent, a forlorn and lonely man.
