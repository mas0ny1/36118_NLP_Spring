dialog: ... because I swear, I don't see

speaker_heading: JOAN

speaker_heading: LEWIE

speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: LEWIE
dialog: Now, if our lovely soprano would like

speaker_heading: ADELE
text: I feel like he's not plugged into

speaker_heading: ADELE
text: See, look at him shaking his head.
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: Well, let's see what he wants to

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How do I feel? I feel she just

speaker_heading: ADELE

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: Better yet, can you take her by

text: Her gaze moves to a bank of windows overlooking a garden

speaker_heading: MELVENOS

speaker_heading: X64 CONTINUED: X64
text: From behind a sheet of plywood resting against the back

text: Helen opens the passenger door and Joan whispers to her:
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Helen, quick, get in the car!
text: Helen leans down and looks in at her:
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What?
text: Looking in the direction of Joan's gaze she sees the dark
text: figure of a man wearing a hood over his head, stepping
text: out from behind the sheet of plywood, holding the ax in
text: his hand and as he moves toward the front of the car, she
dialog: screams.
text: He lifts the ax over his head and swings it down vio-

text: (From inside the house, DUKE can be heard BARKING
dialog: furiously.)
text: Joan leaps from the car and in stark terror, runs out of
text: the garage toward the house. Stopped by the sounds of
text: HELEN'S HYSTERIA, she turns around to see her, hampered
text: by her crutches and unable to move.
text: ON the hooded man's eyes, shifting their homicidal intent
dialog: from Helen to Joan.
text: Joan runs back into the garage and frantically tries to
text: pull Helen away from her death grip on the door handle.
text: The man begins stalking around the front of the car
text: toward her. She grabs one of Helen's crutches and raises
text: it up as if to hit him. As he steps back to the ax and
text: tries to extract it from the hood, she suddenly rushes at
text: him and begins belaboring him with the crutch. He lifts
text: an arm to fend off the blows while his other hand con-
text: tinues to tug at the ax handle.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Helen! Help me!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I can't! I can't move!!
text: Raising both arms to protect himself, the man is forced
text: to give ground, moving further back into the garage, with
text: Joan continuing to batter at him. Then in a sudden burst
text: of rage he grabs hold of the crutch, yanks it from her
text: grasp and lunges at her.

speaker_heading: ANDY
