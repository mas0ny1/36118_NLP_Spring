text: PAPER BOAT, which sluices along a gutter swollen with rushing
dialog: rainwater.
dialog: 
text: Rain taps on George's hood sounding to his ears like rain on
text: a shed roof, a comforting almost cozy sound. The buckles of
text: his galoshes make a merry jingle as he goes.
dialog: 
text: The boat whistles past a blockade of sawhorses marked DEPT OF
text: DERRY PUBLIC WORKS, where a gouge in the blacktop sends it
text: sweeping diagonally across toward a STORM DRAIN.
dialog: 
text: George races after, trying to grab the boat before it's
text: swallowed up with all the rainwater. He SLIPS AND SPILLS to
text: the blacktop, crying out in pain.
dialog: 
text: The PAPER BOAT surfs up to the drain, circles around twice,
text: and goes in. George look ready to cry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Willy's gonna kill me.

dialog: 
text: EYES PEER BACK AT HIM -- from THE GREASY WHITE FACE OF A
text: CLOWN. Not Bozo, or Ronald McDonald, but something more old
text: world, freakish, like that of a 19th-century acrobat -- bald,
text: lithe, almost child-like. Meet PENNYWISE aka BOB GRAY.
dialog: 
text: George recoils back, shocked by Pennywise's presence. A

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENNYWISE (O.C.)
dialog: Hello, Georgie.
dialog: 
text: George looks around him.
dialog: 
text: An OLD WOMAN watches him from the kitchen window of a house

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: How did you get down there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENNYWISE
dialog: Me? Why the storm of course. Just
dialog: bleeeew me away. It blew the whole

dialog: the circus, Georgie?
dialog: 
text: The faint, off-key sound of CALLIOPE MUSIC can be heard.
text: George inches closer to the storm drain.

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Is there cotton candy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENNYWISE
dialog: Cotton candy? Oh yes. Cotton candy

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I sure do. Do they float?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENNYWISE
dialog: Float? Oh indeed they do, Georgie.
dialog: Indeed they do. Everything down
dialog: here floats. And when you're down
dialog: here with us...
dialog: 
text: The clown's sing-songy voice curdles into something horrible,
text: primal even, as George's arm is seized by Pennywise's
text: unusually LONG arm and CLAW-like hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENNYWISE (CONT'D)
dialog: YOU'LL FLOAT TOO!
dialog: 
text: George's SCREEEEEAAAAAM rings through the sewers as we...
dialog: 
text: CUT TO the OLD WOMAN's POV again. The cat devours its food,

scene_heading: INT. DERRY SYNOGOGUE, DOWNSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

dialog: 
text: He can't find the bathroom, but he does see the Mikveh--a

scene_heading: INT. SYNOGOGUE, MIKVEH - SAME
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Suddenly, he notices something bubbling from below. A NAKED
text: WOMAN, her pale white skin glowing from the light.
dialog: 
text: He backs away and quickly zips up his pants.
dialog: 
text: The woman rises to the surface, exhaling a long held breath

speaker_heading: NAKED WOMAN
dialog: You're going to be a man soon,

dialog: you show me yours.
dialog: 
text: She starts to get out of water.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE FROM BEHIND her as she steps out of the water, towards

dialog: 
text: And as she rises from the water, we see that her legs have
text: been reduced to bones and gristle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAKED WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Come here Stanley, come float with

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DERRY SYNOGOGUE, MAIN FLOOR - SECONDS LATER
dialog: 
text: Stanley runs up and into the arms of DORSEY COEN'S MOTHER,

scene_heading: EXT. KANSAS STREET - CONTINUOUS
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Gotcha!

speaker_heading: TRAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Now say it with me. What comes
dialog: after T?
dialog: 
text: Ben plants his heel in Travis's chest and launches himself

scene_heading: EXT. KENDUSKAEG STREAM - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: EDDIE

dialog: 
text: HOCKSTETTLER'S POV: Nothing but darkness.
dialog: 
text: Hockstettler takes out his lighter and hairspray, launching a

dialog: 31.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Monoliths of rusted machinery, half-submerged in stagnant
text: puddles of black mud.
dialog: 
text: And for an instance, a CLOWN. Pennywise. Then blackness
dialog: again.
dialog: 
text: Hockstettler saw IT, but doesn't believe it. He unleashes

text: CHILDREN amongst the monoliths.
dialog:

speaker_heading: HOCKSTETTLER (CONT'D)
dialog: There's no one down here. There's

speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: Patrick... Answer me.

dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: frozen.
dialog: 
text: He lifts up his hair spray can, finger shaking on the plastic

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENNYWISE
dialog: Because down here, we all float.
dialog: 
text: He sprays. The flame spits out and out of the darkness,

speaker_heading: MEAT PUPPET.
dialog: 
text: Horrified, Will races up the stairs as...
dialog: 
text: PENNYWISE crosses the flooded basement and scuffles up the
text: steps after Will, arms and legs splayed out like a charging

dialog: 
text: Will slams the door on Pennywise's/Georgie's gross face.

scene_heading: INT. WILL DENBROUGH'S HOUSE, WILL'S ROOM
dialog: 
text: Will slams the door of his room and hides in his bed.
text: Panting. The DOOR KNOB starts to rattle.
dialog: 
text: Drip. Will looks up. The leak from the ceiling getting
text: worse. The DOOR KNOB rattles even more. Shaking until it
text: seems like its going to fall off.
dialog: 
text: Silence. Will approaches the door. He grabs a baseball bat
text: and prepares to attack. Swinging open the door, ready to
dialog: swing... it's his FATHER.

speaker_heading: ZACH

text: Seeing the bat.

speaker_heading: ZACH (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: WILL

scene_heading: INT. WILL'S HOUSE, BASEMENT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

dialog: water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Dry as a bone, Will. Sure it

speaker_heading: RICHIE

speaker_heading: CHIEF BORTON

dialog: play there.
dialog: 
text: They all look on in disappointment. Then pick up their bikes
text: and head back into town.
dialog: 
text: A dog picks up a scent near A MORLOCK HOLE -- a cement
text: cylinder that sticks about four feet out of the ground with a
text: vented iron manhole cover stamped: DERRY SEWER DEPARTMENT. A
text: drone comes from somewhere deep within.
dialog: 
text: Officer Butch Bowers arrives with news for Chief Borton.

speaker_heading: OFFICER BOWERS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF BORTON
dialog: Another what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER BOWERS
dialog: Kid gone missing.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF BORTON

speaker_heading: OFFICER BOWERS

speaker_heading: CHIEF BORTON

speaker_heading: OFFICER BOWERS

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEVERLY'S BATHROOM - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Bev opens the door, wiping her eyes she approximates the

text: mirror and let's out a choked, exhaling GASP of horror.
dialog: 
text: Surrounded by brown and crusty wallpaper, is Beverly's
dialog: realization that the blood was not a dream.
dialog: 
text: Beverly's Mom appears in the doorway. Beverly turns to her,
text: speechless, in shock.
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. MARSH
dialog: Darling, sometimes I look at myself
dialog: in the morning and think the same
dialog: thing.
dialog: 
text: Beverly tiptoes out of the horror scene. She shyly looks at

text: oblivious to it all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. MARSH (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at these roots.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. HANDLON ABATTOIR - DAY
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER BOWERS
dialog: Leroy Hanlon?
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER BOWERS (CONT'D)
dialog: We need to bring in your boy for
dialog: questioning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: For what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER BOWERS
dialog: Police business.
dialog: 
text: Mike turns to his father, frightened, shaking his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: We need a lawyer?
dialog: 
text: He looks at Mike, searching for any indication what this
text: could be about. Travis appears in the distance and Mike
text: instantly knows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Dad, it's-
dialog: 
text: Officer Bowers roughly grabs Mike by the neck and starts to
text: lead him out.
dialog: 49.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER BOWERS
dialog: Let's go, boy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Hey! No need for that.
dialog: 
text: He grabs Officer Bowers by the arm. Bowers quickly and
text: excessively puts Leroy in a wrist lock and throttles him
text: against the killing pen fence. Leroy moans in pain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER BOWERS
dialog: Search this place, now. It's the
dialog: perfect place to hide a body if you
dialog: ever needed to.
dialog: 
text: Officer Bowers looks around in disgust. Travis smiles from
dialog: the safety of distance and local power.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: This ain't right! You need a
dialog: warrant, you can't just-
dialog: 
text: Leroy seizes his arm, then his chest, then crumples to the
text: ground, losing consciousness in the puddle of blood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Dad!
dialog: 
text: Mike tries to rush for him but he is forcefully escorted to a

speaker_heading: OFFICER BOWERS
dialog: Call an ambulance.

scene_heading: EXT. BEN'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: ALL of the boys have gathered in Ben's room. An aimless

text: pair of walkie-talkies not unlike his own.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHIE
dialog: Whoa, what's with the history
dialog: project, Benny-boy?
dialog: 
text: Richie notices that Ben's walls are covered in xerox copies
text: and historical drawings, all relating to Derry's history.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Oh, uh, when I first moved here I
dialog: didn't have anyone to play with or

speaker_heading: STAN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN

dialog: of that here. Been that way since
dialog: the original settlers.
dialog: 
text: Will, who was more interested in a Viewmaster, turns and
text: looks at the walls now. Sees a copy of an old-timey document
text: with 300 signatures. INCORPORATION OF THE TOWNSHIP OF DERRY.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You have a copy of the Town
dialog: Charter. Seriously?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Derry started as a logging camp
dialog: before it was officially on any
dialog: maps. 300 people signed the
dialog: charter that made Derry Derry. A
dialog: month later they all disappeared,
text: without a trace.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHIE
dialog: The entire town?
dialog: 
text: Eddie is freaked out by this revelation.

text: Stan thumps Richie in the stomach while still paying
dialog: attention to Ben.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: People in neighboring settlements
dialog: thought it was Indians or something
text: but there was no sign of an attack.
dialog: The only clue was a well house that
dialog: was burnt down to charcoal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHIE
dialog: Shit, maybe we could get Derry on
dialog: Unsolved Mysteries!
dialog: 
text: Ben points out on an old map that has a translucent modern

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: It was here. Right on the corner
dialog: of what's now Witcham and Jackson.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Hey, isn't that where Will's
dialog: brother, Georgie-
dialog: 
text: Richie slaps Eddie in the back of the head. His fierce eyes
text: castigating Eddie for not thinking before speaking, Eddie
dialog: confused, "wha-?"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yeah, it's where Georgie died.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN RICHIE
dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't- (to Eddie)
dialog: Good job numb nuts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't worry about it. Why do you

dialog: mean. What are you going to do
dialog: with it?
dialog: 
text: Will can't take his eyes off all of the information.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN

dialog: 
text: The boys, not wanting to be showed up by the girl take one

text: SPLASH! SPLASH!
dialog:

speaker_heading: RICHIE

dialog: don't you get in you pussy?
dialog:

dialog: 
text: PENNYWISE floating in from the depths beneath him.
dialog: 
text: On the surface Ben yelps, something yanking his leg. Richie

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: RICHIE

speaker_heading: RICHIE
dialog: Boys, you're ruining my sunbathing
dialog: vibes with all this chitter

speaker_heading: OFFICER BOWERS

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE BLACK SPOT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A hot hot night, the little shack filled up to the rafters
text: with people dancing, twisting, enjoying themselves. YOUNG

text: drink them up. Out the window Leroy notices...

scene_heading: MEN IN WHITE ROBES
dialog:

text: him out the window.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BLACK SPOT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What truth?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: I saw something, Mikey. Through
text: the smoke and the burning.
dialog: Something I can't even really
dialog: explain, but it was there, Dickie
dialog: saw it, too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What did you see?
dialog: 
text: A NURSE walks in with a chemo bag.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Mr. Hanlon, you ready?
dialog: 
text: Mike and Leroy lock eyes. Leroy leans in, whispers so the
text: nurse can't hear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: I saw what was really responsible
dialog: for that fire, Mikey. Not the
dialog: Legion. See those white boys, they
dialog: were there, but there was something
dialog: else, orchestrating `em. Had `em
text: all in a fit and frenzy, moved to

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CANAL BESIDE THE BLACK SPOT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A balloon surfaces from the waters, bringing with it
text: PENNYWISE. It pulls him over to a survivor swimming in

dialog: water.
dialog: 
text: Leroy and Dick see this and are horrified. They begin
text: swimming back to the edge when a balloon surfaces nearby,
text: again pulling Pennywise, his face smeared with blood, from
dialog: the water.
dialog: 
text: It drags the clown toward them. They climb out of the canal
text: just as Pennywise gets within striking distance. Instead he
text: pounces on a woman there, dragging her under kicking and
text: screaming.
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: On the shore Leroy rests in Dick's arms, the Black Spot now
text: just a heap of smoldering char, the grounds littered with

speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Mr. Hanlon?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
text: (he grabs Mike's shirt
speaker_heading: VIOLENTLY)
dialog: Be careful out there son.
dialog: Especially by the canal. The water
dialog: in Derry is no place for no one,
dialog: especially a youngster like you.
dialog: 
text: The nurse hooks up the chemo bag to Leroy's IV. She turns
text: towards Mike.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: You might want to wait outside.

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL, CORRIDER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Mike steps out into the corridor. The hospital seems eerily
text: dark, empty and quiet.
dialog: 
text: A LIGHT STROBES down the long hall. It draws Mike to it, like
text: a moth to a flame. He turns the corner and sees...
dialog: 
text: A fire alarm pulled, white greasy fingerprints on the lever.
text: Emergency lights strobe along the walls. No sound of an
text: alarm. No doctors or nurses anywhere.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, at the end of the long corridor, a SHEEP trots out
text: from a door, staccato in the strobing light. It stops, looks
text: at Mike, then trots into another door.
dialog: 
text: Mike starts after it, baffled. He approaches the door the
text: sheep walked into, a stream of WATER FLOODING OUT ONTO THE
speaker_heading: FLOOR.
dialog: 
text: He stops, the water rushing past his feet. He looks back
text: behind him, the normally lit hallway now far far away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAAA
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He hears the sheep just inside the open door. He enters
text: through it without noticing the stencil on the glass of the
text: door: "DERRY COUNTY CORONER."
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL, CORONER'S OFFICE
dialog: 
text: Mike enters a windowless bunker like room with all the metal
text: corpse lockers, metal autopsy table and a sink in the corner,
text: the emergency lights still strobing.
dialog: 
text: The sheep is nowhere to be found.
dialog: 
text: Instead Mike finds, in the middle of the floor under the
text: autopsy table, a DRAIN GURGLING UP WATER, the source of the
text: flooding out into the corridor.
dialog: 
dialog: SLAM!
dialog: 
text: The door slams behind him. Mike runs over to it, jiggles the
text: lock, but it won't open. Behind him, in between flashes of
text: the strobe, PENNYWISE APPEARS THEN DISAPPEARS...
dialog: 
text: Mike stops dead, sensing It's presence like he did at the old
text: Ironworks. He slowly looks back as...
dialog: 
text: ONE OF THE CORPSE LOCKER DOORS CREAK OPEN
dialog: 
text: Mike opens his mouth to scream but nothing comes out.
dialog: 
text: He's pounding on the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Somebody! HELP! Let me out!
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Dad! Mom!
dialog: 
text: He looks over his shoulder while continuing to BANG. The
text: tray inside the open locker slowly slides out, like a tongue
text: from a mocking black mouth. On it, under a white sheet, is a
speaker_heading: CORPSE.
dialog: 
text: Mike dares look back just as the sheet catches and the corpse
text: is uncovered. It's none other than PATRICK HOCKSTETTLER,
text: whose legs and arms (up to the elbow) have been bit off,
text: smaller, CHILD SIZE bite marks cover his body.
dialog: 
text: Mike jumps to a corner where he grabs a saw to defend
dialog: himself.
dialog: 
text: Water spews up from the drain with more and more pressure, a
text: pool now covering the floor, the edge of which seeps toward
dialog: Mike.
dialog: 69.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Mike climbs up on a chair, afraid of the water, now with a
text: full view of Patrick's mutilated body.
dialog: 
text: JUST THEN PATRICK TURNS HIS HEAD AND LOOKS AT MIKE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: It's killing your daddy, Mikey.
text: Eating him away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Shut up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATRICK
text: A worm inside a rotten apple.
dialog: We're all apples, Mikey. All of us.
dialog: You know the thing about apples --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Stop it.
dialog: 
text: Patrick's expression turns into a horrific, fearful murmur.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: -- they float.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No!
dialog: 
text: THE WALLS START TO SLIDE IN. As if the room were shrinking.
text: The walls shepherding him towards Patrick's talking corpse.
dialog: 
text: Mike reaches behind him, scraping at the walls, looking for
text: anything with purchase. His hands find the FIRE ALARM.
text: Pulls it.
dialog: 
text: This time the alarm SOUNDS and the strobe lights freeze, the
text: room now fully lit.
dialog: 
text: Mike looks back, calipers raised, and sees the locker doors
text: closed again, no water on the floor.
dialog: 
text: The door opens behind him. It's the CORONER, Chief Borton,
text: and PATRICK'S PARENTS there to identify the remains of their
dialog: boy.
dialog: 
text: Mike is nearly catatonic. He holds onto the Chief, catching
text: his breath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF BORTON
dialog: What are you doing here, son?

scene_heading: EXT. OLD CAPE STREET - NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
text: A Trans Am turns a corner behind him. Headlights on high-

scene_heading: EXT. DERRY SIDE STREET - SAME

dialog: 
text: Just when he's about to get within biting distance, BOOM.

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Fuck.
dialog: 
text: Will sees this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh shit. Abort! Abort!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Abort? What does that mean.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Run!
dialog: 
text: They're about to dodge the car when-
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BEVERLY jumps out firing off her 6-BARRELED MORTAR handheld,
text: aimed horizontally, at the car. THUMP. The recoil throws
text: her back while the rocketing projectile explodes in front of
text: the Trans-Am. Travis and the boys shield their faces
text: SCREAMING as the front windshield explodes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEVERLY
dialog: Woah!
dialog: 
text: THUMP. This one knocks her to the ground as the second
text: mortar flies right towards the Trans Am. Travis yanks the
text: wheel to the LEFT as the firework EXPLODES on the side of the
text: car. He slams on the breaks as Victor, Snatch, and Moose are
text: flung forward. Victor smashes his face on the dash board.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Is that girl for real?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Real as it gets... Now, Stan and
dialog: Eddie!
dialog: 
text: Eddie and Stan charge from behind a hedge. Lighting bottle-
text: rockets aimed at the car. Travis and his boys have to duck
text: for cover as ONE of the rockets ZINGS through the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Those little motherfuckers. Get
dialog: out, get out!
dialog: 
text: The OLDER BOYS climb out the windows, ducking and covering
text: their eyes from the ONSLAUGHT of bottle rockets and roman
text: candle projectiles.
dialog: 
text: Crouched behind the trunk, Travis lights up three M-80's WITH
text: CLOWN FACES on them and tosses them like grenades at Beverly,
text: Stan, and Eddie's positions.
dialog: 
text: The M-80's blow HUGE fist sized holes in the blacktop, bigger
text: than can possibly be legal, exploding gravel peppering the
text: kids, stunning them for a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Holy hell. What kinda gear do they
dialog: got?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I don't wanna stay and find out.
dialog: 
text: Ben and Richie race up from behind, letting loose another
text: barrage as they pass Bowers' gang and the Trans Am, giving
text: cover as the FIRE FIGHT, literally, becomes a retreating
text: manoeuver towards the pier at the end of Neibolt street.
dialog: 77.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Travis' boys cover their eyes but they make aggressive
text: progress towards the kids with their terrifying M-80's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I've been waiting all summer to run
dialog: into you, Denbrough.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Leave us alone Bowers. I don't
dialog: want anyone to get seriously hurt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Hurt? When I'm done with you,
dialog: you'll wish you were in that storm
dialog: drain with your brother.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEIBOLT STREET PIER - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: They regroup at the mouth of the pier, water on both sides,
text: Bowers in front. He throws another M-80, which tears into a
text: wood plank. Splinters shoot everywhere.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEVERLY
dialog: Will, we need cover--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: The house. It's our only chance!
dialog: 
text: Ben points to the Neibolt Street house on stilts over the
text: black water. An imploded, condemned structure that slopes
text: like a man's half eaten face. Eddie is instantly horrified.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I don't think that's a good idea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHIE
dialog: When do you ever think anything is
dialog: a good idea?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Okay. Ben, we'll hold him off while
dialog: we can, you and Stan see if you can
dialog: find a way in.
dialog: 
text: Covering them, Mike, Richie and Will continue to fire off
text: what fireworks they have left. Bowers' boys light off another
text: barrage of M-80's. Will, armed with a plank bats one back
text: like a baseball. BOOM! It explodes at Victors feet.
dialog: 
text: Ben quickly runs towards the house, followed by Stan and Bev.
dialog: 
text: Eddie, stuck in the middle, goes after them down the pier.
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Ben and Stan split up looking for a way in. All windows and
text: doors are boarded up or locked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Really guys, there has to be
dialog: another option.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHIE
dialog: You want to swim?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I'm serious. This house--
dialog: 
scene_heading: BEN, STAN, &amp; BEVERLY
dialog: Shut up, Eddie.
dialog: 
text: And then, as if by magic (or by Pennywise), one of the 2x4s
text: that cover a window to the basement slips to the ground.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEIBOLT STREET PIER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Will finds the backpack empty as Mike shoots off the last
text: bottle rocket. Will picks up some rocks as ammo. Mike and
text: Richie instinctively follow suit. Will winds up and...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Charge!!!
dialog: 
text: NAILS MOOSE IN THE FOREHEAD, drawing blood.
dialog: 
text: Travis and the others stop dead, incredulous, as rocks pelt
text: them. It turns into a crazy rock fight. Will looks back.
text: He can't see any of his friends who are on the other side of
dialog: the house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO BEN)
dialog: Guys hurry!!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Ben and Beverly look at the window into the blackened hole,
text: then at each other ominously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEVERLY
dialog: Rock, paper, scissors?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I'll go.
dialog: 79.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Not wanting to be one-upped by Stan, Ben pushes him out of
dialog: the way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No. I'll go.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEIBOLT STREET PIER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The fight is getting desperate. Both Will and Mike bleed
text: from rock hits. Will, Richie, and Mike see Bev waving them
text: to come. They run for their lives towards the house, Travis
text: and his goons on their heels.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Will, Richie and Mike round the corner of the house. Will
text: looks down the pier, no one, then THEY HEAR BEN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING LOUDLY)
dialog: Down here!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (O.C.)
dialog: I'm gonna kill you, losers! I swear
dialog: I'm gonna kill you all.
dialog: 
text: Will sees a broomstick wave in the opening, beckoning them to
dialog: come in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Go! Go! Go!
dialog: 
text: Mike and Richie slip in, lowering themselves onto a floor
text: littered with crates and boxes. Will last in just as...
dialog: 
text: Travis and his buddies round the house. Moose walks right by
text: the window they slipped into but doesn't seem to see it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Where are they?
dialog: 
text: Victor and Snatch look at Travis for direction. Unmoved,
text: Travis walks around the boarded up house looking for a way
dialog: in.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, BASEMENT
dialog: 
text: The kids catch their breath and lick their wounds. The
text: basement is a derelict and creepy undercarriage to a canal
dialog: lock house.
dialog: 80.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A huge coal ENGINE bulked in the shadows, and next to it an
text: old COAL BIN and stone channel that leads directly to the
dialog: canal and water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHIE
dialog: If we die here I just want to say
dialog: that fight was friggin' awesome.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Shhhhush.
dialog: 
text: Richie does a little pistol shoot with his hands to Ben and
text: mouths "awesome." Ben smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: We shouldn't be here.
dialog: 
text: Will watches Travis and his boys walk past the basement
text: window again. Ben looks to Beverly, sees some gravel in her
text: leg like buckshot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: You okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEVERLY
dialog: It's just a scrape.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE
dialog: 
text: Travis is getting frustrated. He can't find where or how the
text: kids have gotten into the house. He looks straight at the
text: window the kids crawled through, the 2x4 is still somehow
text: attached from the outside.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, BASEMENT
dialog: 
text: The kids can see Travis staring straight at them through the
text: window, the 2x4 is non-existent, as if Pennywise is
text: preventing the boys outside from seeing in or entering.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: They can't see the window?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
speaker_heading: (STILL REPEATING)
dialog: We shouldn't be here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHIE
dialog: Don't count your chickens.
dialog: 81.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Something wrong with your friend
dialog: here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: We shouldn't be here!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL RICHIE
dialog: Eddie? He's afraid of dirt.
dialog: 
text: Will covers Eddie's mouth as he continues to yell, "we
text: shouldn't be here." They watch anxiously as Travis and the
text: boys feet inch uncomfortably closer to them.
dialog: 
text: Then Eddie suddenly stops.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE - SAME
dialog: 
text: Frustrated, Travis and the boys leave.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, BASEMENT
dialog: 
text: The kids have surrounded Eddie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEVERLY
dialog: What is it Eddie?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: There's something I didn't tell you
dialog: guys.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: This house. I saw something here
dialog: once. I thought it was just my
dialog: mind playing tricks, but now I
dialog: know...
dialog: 
text: They sense what he is about to say isn't going to be good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I saw "IT."
dialog: 
text: Eddie nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Jesus.
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHIE
speaker_heading: (TO STAN)
dialog: Why do you keep using our teams,
dialog: guy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Wha?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What does he mean by "IT?"
dialog: 
text: Will looks to the gang, they all nod. He turns back to their
dialog: newest member.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Something's wrong with Derry.
text: Haunting it. Hunting and killing
dialog: kids. We've all seen it.
dialog: 
text: Mike looks at them all, judging their earnestness. Feels he
dialog: can trust them, an instant connection with people whose fear
dialog: clings to your own.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I know. I've seen "IT" too.
dialog: 
text: Just then, the house seems to shiver. As if its foundation
text: had shifted. A CLANKING SOUND resonates from the pipes.
text: Water BEGINS TO SEEP in through the cracks in the basement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEVERLY
dialog: What exactly did you see here,
dialog: Eddie?
dialog: 
text: Ben goes to the window they came through, but instead of
text: seeing out, it's now covered by the 2x4.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Guys, uh--
dialog: 
text: He looks at their feet. They all do. Water coming in fast.
text: Ben bangs a coal stoker against the boarded window. Rock
text: solid. Will looks for a way out. The stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Stairs.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly they HEAR FOOTSTEPS, above. They look up as dust
text: falls from one side of the roof, slowly making its way to
text: directly over them. To the stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (whispering in fright)
dialog: It's here.
dialog: 83.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Will grabs on to Beverly's hand. She holds onto his with
text: equal vigor. Richie holds onto Eddie.
dialog: 
text: Ben holds the stoker like a sword. Mike grabs a shovel.
text: They lead the way up the stairs.
dialog: 
text: Unless otherwise noted, they ONLY WHISPER now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHIE
dialog: I'm not going up there.
dialog: 
text: The others ignore him, follow Ben and Mike up the stairs.
dialog: 
text: Richie looks around him at the scary basement, the furnace
text: hulking in the corner like a being with eyes. The water
text: surrounds his shoes. He runs up after his friends.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR
dialog: 
text: A door opens in the middle of the kind of creepy hallway you
dialog: don't want to find yourself in, ever. Scummy yellow water
text: stained wallpaper peeling like dead skin from walls. Sconces
text: hanging from their sockets and detritus is built up on the
text: wooden floor boards. No footprints anywhere.
dialog: 
text: Ben sticks his head out. He looks left, nothing, he looks
text: right, nothing. Directly in front of him, through a dark
text: parlor, is the FRONT DOOR.
dialog: 
text: As Ben disappears into the stairs again, the door closes,
text: revealing PENNYWISE THE CLOWN, at the far end of the hallway.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, BASEMENT STAIRS
dialog: 
text: Ben still has his hand on the door knob.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
text: The front door is right there.
dialog: 
text: Will nods. Let's go.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR
dialog: 
text: Pennywise is gone.
dialog: 
text: The kids all file out, sticking close to the filthy walls.
text: They dart into the dark parlor for the door, followed last by
dialog: Richie...
dialog: 
text: The room seems to extend and last longer than anticipated.
text: Finally they get to the door. Ben tries it. Nailed shut.
dialog: 84.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Shit. Guys, look.
dialog: 
text: Everyone turns and sees HUNDREDS OF CROWS perched atop the
text: railing of the main staircase and in the rafters above.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: There must be a window open.
dialog: 
text: Will reads his mind, an upstairs window might be their only
dialog: chance to freedom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: C'mon.
dialog: 
text: Will leads the way upstairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR
dialog: 
text: The children, petrified, slide up the stairs as silently as
text: possible, trying not to disturb the watching crows. Or alert
text: whatever else is there. The stairs creak and snap loudly.
dialog: 
text: They get to a 2nd floor hallway, the wind from an open window
text: blowing trash around. Will looks around...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR BEDROOM
dialog: 
text: He beckons them into a bedroom with AN OPEN WINDOW. They
text: step over a moldy bare mattress shoved against the wall.
dialog: 
text: Beverly is the first one out the window, then Stan, then
text: Richie, then Ben. Ben looks back and sees Eddie standing by
text: the doorway to the hallway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Eddie, what are you doing?
dialog: 
text: Eddie turns towards them, realizes he must have lost
text: consciousness for a second, doesn't understand why he was
text: standing there. He walks towards the window when
dialog: 
text: THE FLOOR GIVES WAY and he tumbles down to the first floor.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR, KITCHEN
dialog: 
dialog: If the house weren't spooky enough, this room is the
text: spookiest. A bunch of furniture is gathered in the middle of
text: the room covered in sheets. A dusty old refrigerator stands
text: in the corner. Dust everywhere begins to clear from Eddie's
text: fall. He is knocked out. His arm is clearly broken.
dialog: 85.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR
dialog: 
text: Will, Mike, and Ben rush back into the house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Eddie!
dialog: 
text: Will runs around the gaping hole in the floor and tries to
text: run down the stairs when...
dialog: 
text: THE FLOCK OF CROWS ATTACK
dialog: 
text: Will covers his eyes as the birds prevent him from going
text: down. Mike and Ben shore themselves behind him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR BEDROOM
dialog: 
text: The other kids scream from the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEVERLY
dialog: What's happening?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHIE
dialog: Whatever it is, we don't want to go
dialog: back in there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEVERLY
dialog: We have to do something.
dialog: 
text: She looks around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEVERLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Follow me!
dialog: 
text: Beverly leads Richie and Stan down to the edge of the roof.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR
dialog: 
text: Will, Mike, and Ben are being pelted by the birds still.
text: They retreat back into the bedroom and shut the door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR, KITCHEN
dialog: 
text: Eddie, coming back to consciousness, looks around the room.
text: He moans in pain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Guys?
dialog: 
text: From the hole above, Will and Ben appear.
dialog: 86.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Eddie.
dialog: 
text: Realizing he is alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Get me out of here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We tried, we can't get down stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What do you mean you can't get down
dialog: stairs?
dialog: 
text: Eddie looks around the creepy room at the sheets. Something
dialog: horrible could be under any one of them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Do you see anything you could use
dialog: to climb out?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I- I think I broke my arm.
dialog: 
text: He holds it up and the lower part of his arm hangs
text: irregularly. Behind him the old refrigerator SHAKES,
text: SOMETHING INSIDE.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: It's 15 feet sheer drop above the dilapidated pier. Richie
text: is too scared to jump.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEVERLY
dialog: I don't know, Richie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHIE
dialog: You gotta a better idea?
dialog: 
text: Glass breaks and CROWS STORM OUT OF A WINDOW behind them.
text: Startled, they all lose their footing and fall, crashing down
text: onto a pile of rope below.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR, KITCHEN
dialog: 
text: Eddie looks to the shaking fridge. Blood oozes out of it and
text: starts to cover the floor, inching towards him. Eddie backs
text: away, horrified.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No. No no no. Will? Help me!
dialog: 87.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR BEDROOM
dialog: 
text: Will sees the blood, looks to Ben and Mike.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What do we do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: We can't leave him alone down
dialog: there.
dialog: 
text: Mike looks at the old moldy mattress.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR, KITCHEN
dialog: 
text: Eddie hops onto a rocking chair as the whole floor is coated
text: with BLOOD.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Hurry, guys!
dialog: 
text: The fridge door starts to YAWN OPEN. Eddie curls in a ball
text: and closes his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: This isn't happening. This isn't
dialog: happening.
dialog: 
text: Inside is Pennywise, all curled up. He unfurls himself like
text: a coiled snake, holding a balloon on a string. It drags him,
text: floating just above the bloody floor, across the room toward
dialog: Eddie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENNYWISE
dialog: Open your eyes Eddie-bear. I
dialog: brought you some cracker-jack.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Go away!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENNYWISE
dialog: Away? But I just got here? And
dialog: we're gonna have soooooo much fun,
dialog: you and me. Now open those
text: peepers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENNYWISE
dialog: Kee-mon Eddie Bear. Don'cha wanna
dialog: see the show? You're the main
dialog: event.
dialog: 88.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Eddie does. Pennywise is over him now, his teeth like razors,
text: his clawed hands reaching out for Eddie's neck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENNYWISE (CONT'D)
dialog: You all taste soooooooo much better
dialog: when you're afraid.
dialog: 
dialog: Eddie screeeeeeeeeams!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR
dialog: 
text: Mike lifts up the mattress and sees a decomposed corpse of
text: some child underneath it. He screams, falling backwards
text: towards Will and Ben.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, KITCHEN
dialog: 
text: SUDDENLY ALL THREE OF THEM
dialog: 
text: Fall onto Pennywise, smacking into the floor, blood
text: splattering the walls, impact cushioned by Pennywise's body.
text: They instantly fall to the side.
dialog: 
text: Will, Mike and Ben look over to see what broke their fall- a
text: just as startled Pennywise, writhing in anger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Ah, fuck!
dialog: 
text: Eddie scurries away from Pennywise, who bares his fangs at
dialog: Will.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRASH!
dialog: 
text: Just then the board from the window rips off to Richie, Stan
dialog: and Beverly.
dialog: 
text: She fires a bottle rocket at Pennywise's face, exploding
text: right into his eye. The clown reels back howling.
dialog: 
text: Richie and Ben jump in and grab Eddie.
dialog: 
text: Pennywise pulls the rocket out of his burned socket and
text: growls at the boys, morphing into an ORANGE GAS that shoots
text: back into the fridge.
dialog: 
text: Eddie, Ben and Richie climb to safety through the window,
text: while Will watches from the window frame Pennywise's escape.

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SILVER DOLLAR SALOON - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Dozens of loggers are bellied up at the bar, drinking beers,
text: spitting chew on the sawdust covered floor. The man with the
text: ax, CLAUDE HEROUX, elbows himself a place at the bar and
text: throws down a TWO DOLLAR BILL.
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The bartender brings Heroux a schooner of beer, one
text: hardboiled egg in a bowl, a shaker of salt and some change.
text: Heroux salts the egg and the beer, his piercing eyes stuck on
dialog: 
text: A CARD GAME AT A TABLE OF 5 MEN IN BACK
dialog: 
text: He devours the egg, downs the beer, then lets out a belch.
text: The man next to him gives a friendly nod. Heroux doesn't
text: respond. He kicks back from the bar, dragging his ax behind.
dialog: 
text: Heroux walks past a piano being played, whispers something
text: into the players ear, then throws the change from his meal --
text: $1.85 -- onto the piano top. The piano player tips his hat
text: and changes tune to something more festive, manic almost.
dialog: 
text: Heroux continues into the back, walking like a man in a half
dialog: dream.
dialog: 
text: At the table, EL KATOOK deals out a hand to a group of
scene_heading: railroad bulls -- TINKER MCCUTCHEON, FLOYD CALDERWOOD,
text: "STUGLEY" GRENIER, and EDDIE KING, a bearded man whose
text: spectacles are almost as fat as his gut.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FLOYD CALDERWOOD
dialog: You sitting in Claude?
dialog: 
text: Floyd reaches out to grab his hand when...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THUNK!
dialog: 
text: Heroux's ax falls, chopping of Floyd's hand at the wrist.
text: Floyd recoils back shrieking, blood spurting from the stump,
text: his severed hand remaining on the table.
dialog: 
text: At the bar somebody calls for more beer. The bartender takes
text: a casual look back just in time to see...
dialog: 
text: Heroux bury his ax in Tinker McCutchoen's head. The big man
text: tries to get up, blood pouring down his face, then sits back
text: down again. A second chop finishes him.
dialog: 
text: Floyd, writhing under the table, gropes for his hand on the
text: table above it. Heroux chops his other hand off, Floyd
text: screams even louder.
dialog: 
text: Laughter from the bar as patrons rub the bartender's bald
text: head for luck. The piano playing only gets more giddy and
text: festive, then we see who's playing it:
dialog: 
text: PENNYWISE, fingers dancing across the keys like a virtuoso.
dialog: 
text: Heroux turns to Ed Katook, who struggles to pull his clutch
text: pistol from its shoulder holster. He slings the ax sideways
text: just as Katook gets the pistol out, burying it in his back.
dialog: 93.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRACK!
dialog: 
text: A shot goes off. But at the bar, conversation between two
text: loggers turns to the weather. This winter will be a jeezer.
dialog: 
text: Fat Eddie King falls to the floor trying to crab away from
text: the table. Heroux, bloody ax dragging on the floor, comes
text: over to the fat man who pleads.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE KING
dialog: Please Claude, I just got married
dialog: last month.
dialog: 
text: The ax comes down into Eddie's ample gut. Blood sprays all
text: the way up to the Dollar's beamed roof.
dialog: 
text: Men at the bar laugh and eat their boiled eggs, dully aware
text: of the gorefest behind them.
dialog: 
text: Heroux pulls the ax out of his gut like you would a softwood
text: tree, rocking it back and forth. It finally comes free and he
text: brings it down again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THWAP!
dialog: 
text: Eddie's severed head goes rolling over toward the bar, right
text: to the foot of a drunk, who without breaking his call for
text: another drink, kicks it away.
dialog: 
text: In back, Heroux turns to the last man cowering in the corner:
text: Stugley Grenier. He takes a swing and Stugley ducks it, ax
text: splintering the floor.
dialog: 
text: Stugley scrambles into the OUTHOUSE and closes the door
text: behind. Heroux, now totally slicked with blood, stalks over
text: and begins chopping his way in.
dialog: 
text: He finds the windowless room empty. A sound comes from deep
text: in the pooping hole. He looks down just in time to see...
dialog: 
text: Stugley's boots disappear through the pool of shit and piss.
dialog: 
text: Heroux steps out of the outhouse into the carnage of the back
text: room. Exhausted and bloody from tip to toe, he takes a seat
text: at the card table, props his ax next to him, and starts
text: drinking what's left of the slaughtered men's beers.
dialog: 
text: No one in the saloon seems to pay much mind to this. No one
text: except Pennywise at the piano, who takes great pleasure in
text: the scene and the ditty he's playing, a greasy white smile on
text: his giddy, evil face...

speaker_heading: BEVERLY
dialog: I'm a good girl daddy. Good, just

speaker_heading: MR. MARSH

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEVERLY
dialog: WHERE'D YOU--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. MARSH
dialog: You had it squirreled away in your

speaker_heading: BEVERLY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEVERLY

speaker_heading: MR. MARSH
dialog: Don't lie to me!

speaker_heading: MR. MARSH
dialog: I love you Bevvie. You're special.
dialog: You're such a pretty girl. But

speaker_heading: MR. MARSH (CONT'D)
dialog: Your tights, girl. Take `em off.

speaker_heading: BEVERLY

dialog:

text: feels all too reminiscent of a clown.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. MARSH
dialog: You'll like it, Bevvie. Be like
dialog: you're floating.
dialog: 
text: Bev kicks him in the balls. Her father lets go, crumpling
text: down. She knees him in the face as hard as she can, his head
text: flying back into the side of the door.
dialog: 
text: Beverly tries to race out the door but he snatches her ankle
text: and she trips into the hallway. By the time she is up he is
text: lunging towards her.
dialog: 
text: She stumbles back into the bathroom and shuts the door,
text: trying to lock herself inside. He kicks the door open before
dialog: the lock catches.
dialog: 
text: Without thinking Bev grabs the toilet top and smashes it in
text: her dad's face. He slumps down, unconscious.
dialog: 
text: She rushes out, then uses a chair propped against the knob to
text: shut him in the bathroom. Terrified she races out the front

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MEMBRANOUS CHAMBER - DAY
dialog:

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: BEVERLY
dialog: Take off your shoes. You'll be
dialog: fine. Just move real real slow.

dialog: 118.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BLACK HOLE - DAY

speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: No! No no no no! Fuck!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: We'll never fit. We've gotta go

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I need to hear them squeal. Now
dialog: you'll fit.
dialog: 
text: He puts the knife into Victor's hand and points to keep
text: going. For a split second Victor thinks about stabbing him,
text: but he's too scared. He squeezes his rangy frame through the
dialog: roots into...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MEMBRANOUS CHAMBER - DAY
dialog: 
text: Victor flops out onto the membrane just as Ben, Will and Mike

text: Victor sees them. He's freaked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICTOR

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Victor.
dialog: 
text: Will is pointing. Beverly follows his eyes to the knife in

speaker_heading: BEVERLY
speaker_heading: OH NO-
dialog: 
text: Spiders spill out onto it's surface.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Oh god oh god!
dialog: 
text: He freaks, spiders jumping on him, his motion only ripping
text: the membrane more. It finally tears and Victor plunges
text: beneath the membrane, spiders devouring him, Victor screaming
text: in agony as they fill his mouth.
dialog: 
text: Horrified, Will and the others run for their lives.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BLACK HOLE - DAY

speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Good. That's good, Vic. Kill `em.

scene_heading: INT. IT'S CAVERN - DAY
dialog: 
text: Will, Ben, Bev, Mike, Eddie, Stan and Richie stumble from the
text: dark into a massive, soaring, subterranean Pantheon-like
text: hall, sewer water streaming past their feet...
dialog: 
text: In the center of the floor is a massive OCULUS, open to what
text: appears to be the edge of INFINITE SPACE. The water from the
text: sewers flows down into seven channels around this opening,
dialog: ending at...
dialog: 
text: SEVEN WATERFALLS THAT FALL UPWARDS into a reflecting pool
text: that covers much of the ceiling, surrounding a stone island
text: with a CRYPT TYPE STRUCTURE.

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Don't get too close to the edge,
dialog: Will.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It's up there isn't it? That's
dialog: where "IT" sleeps.
dialog: 
text: Pointing at the reflecting pool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You mean Pennywise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It doesn't matter what it calls
dialog: itself. What matters is it's
dialog: afraid to show us what it really
dialog: is. Which means we can beat it.
dialog: 
text: Will sees Beverly over by one of the waterfalls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEVERLY
dialog: Guess I'm going first again?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Beverly, wait-!
dialog: 
text: She jumps into the waterfall and it sweeps her up up up to
dialog: the ceiling.
dialog: 
text: Will and the boys swap holy shit looks. Ben jumps in after
text: her, then Will, Mike, and Stan.
dialog: 
text: Richie looks to Eddie, who has the same terrified look as at
text: the quarry. He holds out his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHIE
dialog: You still afraid of a little grey
dialog: water?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You still wear diapers at night?
dialog: 
text: Eddie grabs Richie's hand and they jump into the waterfall
text: together. They are swept up up up into...
dialog: 121.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE REFLECTING POOL ON THE CEILING - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Plunging into the pool with the others. For a moment they
text: all flap and kick under water, unsure which way is up, then
text: Bev grabs them both and pulls them to the surface.
dialog: 
text: They're upside down now, the oculus opening to space below
text: them, gravity seeming to work by its own rules in here..
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We all here?
dialog: 
text: Richie looks back where they just "fell" from.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHIE
dialog: Mind equals blown right now.
dialog: 
text: The camera flips around and THE WORLD RIGHTS ITSELF, the
text: oculus now above. The pool, which seemed small before, is
text: now enormous -- like a dark, brooding lake -- the crypt
text: island very far from them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: This is nothing like what it looked
text: like from below.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: It's in our head. All the stuff we
dialog: see. It's like the allergies my
dialog: mom said I had. We make it real.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: We do. Or IT?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Guys, the island. Let's swim.
dialog: 
text: They splash toward the crypt island. Ben is the first to
text: feel something brush past his leg. A replay of the quarry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Not funny, Richie.
dialog: 
text: He looks back and sees no one. Richie is a couple of lengths
text: to his left.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHIE
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: Ben suddenly realizes. Bev also feels something on her foot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEVERLY
dialog: The water. There's something in
dialog: the water with us.
dialog: 122.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Suddenly a WORMY TENTACLE extends from the water behind Mike.
text: Will sees it and whacks it away with his baseball bat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Hurry!
dialog: 
text: The kids hustle it freestyle across the pool for the island.
dialog: 
text: WE PULL BACK WIDE TO SEE a monstrously big, faintly outlined
text: starfish-like creature with an orange glowing eye, lurking in
text: the depths of the reflecting pool.
dialog: 
text: Will, then Bev, then Richie dodge a tentacle and all get to
text: the island. Stan is not far behind, with Mike, Eddie and Ben
text: taking the rear, swatting back more tentacles.
dialog: 
text: From under Stan the ORANGE EYE APPEARS, the dark water around
text: him suddenly aglow. He looks down into it and it becomes
text: clear the eye is really a mouth, and the orange is coming
text: from deep inside its bowels -- THE DEADLIGHTS.
dialog: 
text: Stan looks directly into them and is mesmerized, so much so
dialog: that he stops swimming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Stan what are you doing!
dialog: 
text: Paralyzed, Stan starts to sink toward the deadlights when
text: Mike, shielding his eyes, grabs Stan and swims him back to
text: the surface.
dialog: 
text: All the kids give cover with their weapons -- shooting
text: flares, swinging the sledgehammer, impaling with the stake,
text: using the hubcap as a shield -- so that Mike, helped by Ben
text: and Eddie, can drag Stan onto the island.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE BEVERLY
dialog: Stan? Stan, are you okay? Stan!
dialog: 
text: He stares blankly ahead, as if his mind was wiped blank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Stan, it's us. You in there buddy?
dialog: 
text: Another tentacle squirms out of the water toward them. Ben
text: shoots it with a crossbow. It goes slithering back in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Guys. I don't think this is the
dialog: best place to hang out right now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Stanley, snap out of it.
dialog: 123.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Stan blinks conscious. He looks at them all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Where am I?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHIE
dialog: The worst and only bar mitzvah
dialog: party you will ever have.
dialog: 
text: They help Stan to his feet. Mike looks back over his shoulder
dialog: for the monster.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Guys, the water thing. IT's gone.
dialog: 
text: Indeed, the reflecting pool is placid as ice.
dialog: 
text: Will looks back to the crypt, an obsidian stone heptagon-
text: shaped structure the size of one of Mike's killing pens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Maybe. Or just changing into
dialog: something else.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It's using our fears against us.
dialog: It wants us to be afraid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Because we'll taste better.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHIE
dialog: And that's supposed to rally us,
dialog: Will?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We have to stick together, to help
dialog: each other against that kind of
dialog: fear you only have when you're
dialog: alone. Alright?
dialog: 
text: They all nod and follow Will onto the structure, starry deep
text: space through the oculus visible over their shoulders. They
text: come to a child-sized TRAP DOOR with an ancient, cosmic
text: marking. The only way in or out.
dialog: 
text: WILL PUTS HIS HAND ON THE LATCH
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Ready?
dialog: 124.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The kids steal themselves, weapons ready. Mike hammers a
text: clip into the stone and ties a rope to it. Nods all around.
dialog: 
text: WILL TURNS THE LATCH
dialog: 
text: The door creaks open. Nothing but pure blackness inside.
text: Mike throws down the rope. Will looks at Bev.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: My turn.
dialog: 
text: Will takes a breath, drops in...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. IT'S CRYPT - DAY
dialog: 
text: Will shimmies down about 5 feet of rope and lights a car
text: flare, illuminating the chamber in a blood red pall. The
text: walls inside are rough, like the surface of a meteor.
dialog: 
text: Directly under the trapdoor is a fountain like hole in the
text: floor open to the reflecting pool. Floating on the water is
dialog: 
scene_heading: GEORGIE'S PAPER BOAT
dialog: 
text: Pennywise emerges from the shadows behind Will, clinging to
text: the wall, joints all turned and wrong, like a spider.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENNYWISE
dialog: Welcome to the circus, Willy.
dialog: 
dialog: SLAM!
dialog: 
text: The trapdoor slams shut and slices the rope. Will falls to
text: the floor, flare falling into the water. It dims but doesn't
dialog: go out.
dialog: 
text: It's near PITCH BLACK. Just Will and Pennywise. He can hear
text: his friends banging on the door, calling for him but can't
dialog: see anything.
dialog: 
text: There's scuffling all around him. Close. Will dives into
text: the water for the flare. Rises. Sweeps it around.
dialog: 
text: NOTHING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm not afraid of you, clown.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENNYWISE
dialog: Your brother wasn't afraid either.
dialog: 
text: A PAIR OF ORANGE EYES GLOW ABOVE HIM, IN THE DARK. Will
text: can't see him.
dialog: 125.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENNYWISE (CONT'D)
dialog: Not until I chewed his little
dialog: muscles up.
dialog: 
text: Will turns just in time for the eyes to recede into the
text: black. The pounding on the trap door has stopped.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Guys?
dialog: 
text: PENNYWISE LUNGES FROM THE CEILING
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Ahhhh!
dialog: 
text: Will drops his bag of flares and scrambles off, tripping over
text: the hole in the floor, leg sloshing in the pool.
dialog: 
text: Glimpses of Pennywise scuffling in the dark like a spider.
dialog: 
text: Will finds a corner, the flare running out of spark. He
text: waves it this way and that, illuminating the dark in front of
text: him. Swinging his baseball bat wildly at shadows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Come out from the dark then. Come
dialog: out from behind that stupid mask
dialog: and show me what you really are.
dialog: C'mon!
dialog: 
text: Will looks at the last light of his flare, waiting for the
text: end. He looks the bat in his clutch only to see it's morphed
dialog: into...
dialog: 
scene_heading: A BOY'S SEVERED ARM
dialog: 
text: He throws it away into the darkness. The flare goes out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PITCH BLACK
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENNYWISE
dialog: Ooooh I'd love to, Will. I'd just
dialog: love to show you my deadlights.
dialog: Only you wouldn't understand. And
dialog: I need you to, Willy, I really
dialog: really need you to understand
dialog: what's going to happen to you.
dialog: What it means for a little kiddie
dialog: like you... to float.
dialog: 
text: A light seems to emanate from the pool underneath them,
text: illuminating the space, illuminating...
dialog: 
scene_heading: PENNYWISE, STANDING IN THE CORNER
dialog: 126.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Will sees all of "IT" now. From his bare crusty feet to his
text: bald head. His claw-like hands and his emaciated acrobat-
text: like body. He floats just a few inches over the stone floor.
dialog: 
text: Will's eyes fall to the baseball bat half-way between them.
text: He lunges for it, Pennywise knocking it away. The clown
text: seizes his neck, smiles hungrily, bares his twisted fangs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm sorry, Georgie.
dialog: 
text: Pennywise goes for a bite and...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THWACK
dialog: 
text: An arrow shoots through it's face. The injured clown recoils
text: away. Bev flops out from the reflecting pool, followed by
text: Ben, Richie, Stan, Eddie, and Mike.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEVERLY
dialog: Break into our homes, we break into
dialog: yours.
dialog: 
text: Pennywise pulls the arrow from his bloody mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Charge!
dialog: 
text: THE LOSERS ATTACK PENNYWISE WITH EVERYTHING THEY GOT
dialog: 
text: Mike with crow bar, Stan with chainsaw, Ben with a hub cap
text: shield and sledgehammer, Richie with his hockey stick stake,
text: Eddie with a nail gun. Will grabs his bat and joins them.
dialog: 
text: Pennywise tries to fend off this "Lord of the Flies"
text: rebellion, becoming bigger, fiercer, more grotesque, but the
text: kids are too much. Just when they have "IT" bleeding and
text: backed into a corner for the death blow...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENNYWISE
dialog: Wait!
dialog: 
text: Will grabs Ben's sledgehammer. The creature that looks up at
dialog: them isn't Pennywise but... GEORGIE
dialog: 
scene_heading: PENNYWISE/GEORGIE
dialog: Please, Willy. Please don't hurt
dialog: me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You're not Georgie.
dialog: 127.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: PENNYWISE/GEORGIE
dialog: I am. I'm in here, Willy. We all
dialog: are. This is the place we float.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEVERLY
dialog: Will, it's a trick.
dialog: 
scene_heading: PENNYWISE/GEORGIE
dialog: It's not your fault Willy. Not
dialog: you're fault I'm stuck here. But
dialog: you're hurting us all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It's trying to get to you, Will.
dialog: Kill it. Kill it now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No! I have to think.
dialog: 
scene_heading: PENNYWISE/GEORGIE
dialog: Mom and dad they should know. They
dialog: should know it's not your fault.
dialog: I'll tell `em. I'll tell `em as
dialog: long as you don't hurt us anymore.
dialog: 
text: Will is confused. This is the one thing he wanted to hear.
text: Beverly hands him his satchel with the car flares.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEVERLY
dialog: Finish him, Will. For all of us.
dialog: For Georgie.
dialog: 
text: Will looks to the scared little boy on the ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHIE
dialog: I'm taking this fucker out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: Will grabs his stake away. He turns to Georgie. Kneels
text: down. Takes his wet little head in his hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't go
dialog: out there with you. I'm sorry I
dialog: was sick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: It's okay, Willy. I know.
dialog: Everything'll be okay.
dialog: 
text: WILL DOES THE CALL BACK AND SOMETHING IN THE WAY GEORGIE
text: RESPONDS SNAPS WILL OUT OF HIS STUPOR. GEORGIE'S GONE
dialog: 128.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Hairspray.
dialog: 
text: Bev sprays it through his lit flare. Torching Georgie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: No! No Willy! Please!
dialog: 
text: GEORGIE REVERTS BACK TO PENNYWISE, screaming horribly and
text: lunging at the kids one last time. IT finally gives up,
text: slumping to the floor dead, a black charred clownish corpse.
dialog: 
text: Richie touches the remains and they deflates, almost as if a
dialog: balloon.
dialog: 
text: The trapdoor above them blows away, as if it were sucked off
text: by a cyclone, out of the oculus, and into what looks like the
text: stars of outer space.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Did we kill it?
dialog: 
text: Will isn't sure, he looks at the rest of them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You did it, Will.
dialog: 
text: Bev hugs him. Ben watches, enviously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHIE
dialog: It's miller ti--
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the GRAVITY SPELL WEARS OFF and the kids all fall to
text: the ceiling of the stone crypt. Bev almost falls out into
text: space, caught by Ben just in time.
dialog: 
text: The water from the waterfalls and from the reflecting pool
text: all collapse back toward the floor, along with some of the
text: stones in the crypt around them, which begins to crumble.
dialog: 
text: At first the losers hang on, afraid to fall, but eventually
text: they lose grip and fall toward the oculus, which has begun to
text: fill up with the water from the falls and reflecting pool.
dialog: 
text: They all plunge safely into the new pool below, Will's foot
text: kicking out the bottom of it into outer space before being
text: pulled back by Stan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We've got to get out of here.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We'll get out. C'mon.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: LOOKS TO WILL, NODDING
dialog: 
text: Will knows exactly what this means. He steps up to Stan, who

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Swear, guys. Swear if IT isn't
