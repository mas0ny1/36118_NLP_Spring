text: A perfectly-restored Ford pick-up with some vintage objects
text: in the bed drives slowly along a street lined with modest but
text: gracious two-storey houses. The only people passing by at
text: this time of day are a group of elderly power-walkers,
text: swinging tiny weights.
text: The pick-up stops in front of a lawn that is badly in need of
text: a trim. The radio cuts off and WILL emerges. He’s forty-five;
text: average-looking. He pulls a shoulder bag and then two stuffed
text: Whole Foods shopping bags from the passenger seat. When he
text: kicks the truck’s door shut we see a sign: “SECOND HAND -

scene_heading: INT./EXT. ELLA’S AND JOHN’S HOUSE - DAY 2
text: Will enters through the kitchen door without knocking. He
text: puts down the bags and announces his presence with forced
dialog: good cheer:
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Mom? It’s me! You ready? Jane’ll be
dialog: here any minute. I made a cake for
dialog: Dad, hazelnut and carrot. No butter
dialog: or sugar, so you can have a slice!
text: No answer. Will starts to explore various rooms.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are you guys?
text: It’s a cozy, slightly messy house. There’s a living room with
text: a fireplace, a big library. Will collects an open book and
text: shelves it, then folds a shirt that’s been tossed on a chair.
text: He opens the door to the master bedroom. The bed is unmade.
text: His father John’s study. The roller desk is piled high with
text: books and papers. There’s a big old desktop computer right in
text: the middle of it all.
dialog: Scene 2 Page 2.
text: On the shelves of a large bookcase that is cluttered with
text: essays and books, there’s an old Remington typewriter John
text: used to work with, its beautiful keyboard like a sculpture.
text: Will emerges from the front door onto the porch, turning off
text: the phone in frustration. He scratches his head. An elderly
text: lady in gardening attire stands in the yard next door. It’s
text: LILLIAN, the neighbor. She’s gray-haired, friendly:
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Will! How are you?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (approaches her)
dialog: Hey, Lillian.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: I’m glad I caught you alone. I
dialog: wanted to tell you that if you guys
text: get busy with Ella in the hospital,
dialog: I'd be more than happy look in on
dialog: John.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: But they’re not here! Mom and Dad -
dialog: the house is empty!
text: He redials. Lillian gives him a curious look.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: (grumbles )
dialog: Why’d we even buy her that damned
dialog: phone? She always turns it off.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Come to think of it, I heard
text: someone turning on an engine this
text: morning. Very early.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What motor? Dad's car’s right here.
text: He points to a perfectly-maintained old Chevy in the open
text: garage. And then he realizes the large covered carport is
dialog: open.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my god!
text: He’s white as a ghost. He runs toward the carport. Lillian’s
text: also shocked. She murmurs:
dialog: Scene 2 Page 3.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: I can’t believe this.
text: Will frantically dials and impatiently awaits an answer:
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Jane! Mom and Dad are gone! And -
dialog: can you believe it? - so is the
dialog: Leisure Seeker!
scene_heading: EXT. THE ROAD, SUBURBS - DAY 3
text: A 1970s Leisure Seeker camper moves through morning traffic.
scene_heading: EXT/INT. CAMPER, MOVING, SUBURBS - DAY 4
text: And here they are: ELLA and JOHN. He’s got a white beard and
text: wears glasses with progressive lenses. He looks like he’s
text: totally absorbed in his driving. Every so often he shoots a
text: look at Ella, who uses her gaze to encourage and direct him
text: which way to go, while also keeping an eye on a map spread on
text: her lap. She has a small, golden purse on her knee, from
text: which she occasionally pulls a tiny mirror to check her
dialog: appearance.
text: THE RADIO IS TURNED ON LOW:
scene_heading: TRAFFIC INFORMATION, WEATHER,
speaker_heading: POPULAR SONGS
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Take a right. Here. Exactly. Very
dialog: good.
text: John follows orders with a mysterious calm. Ella watches him
dialog: closely.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Couldn’t you have worn something
dialog: more comfortable to travel in?
text: He’s wearing a checkered shirt under a tweed jacket. A linen
text: handkerchief protrudes from his breast pocket. She leans
text: closer and sniffs.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: And I think you've exaggerated a
text: bit with the eau de cologne. Though
dialog: you do smell nice.
dialog: Scene 4 Page 4.
text: John smiles agreeably, but something tells us that he’s not
text: really grasping what he’s being told. He sniffs the air as
text: the camper’s interior fills now with the sound of:
text: THE RONETTES SINGING ‘BE MY
speaker_heading: BABY’
text: He finally speaks:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Darling?
text: Eyes on the road, he waits until he has her attention.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you fart?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (with pleasure)
dialog: You did!
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (scandalized laugh)
dialog: What are you talking about? You
dialog: can’t say that!
text: But she also sniffs the air, then cranes her neck to look
text: between the seats - there’s a wisp of smoke coming from the
text: engine’s trap door.
text: She leans forward to pull a rug from beneath her feet. She
text: places it over the leak.
text: He glances at her, but soon loses interest and looks back at
text: the road ahead.
text: They're passing through a leafy suburb filled with banners
text: and signs from the 2016 campaign. A bus full of school kids
text: passes; some of them point and make faces.
text: Ella waves to them through the window.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello! Hi! Such beautiful
dialog: children... you can go now, hon.
dialog: The street’s clear. John? Go! Put
dialog: that old engine to work!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yessir.
dialog: Scene 4 Page 5.
text: John accelerates, turning right onto an on-ramp for the
text: interstate. A red gasoline light goes on, accompanied by a:
speaker_heading: BEEP
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Do we need gas, hon?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We need gas?
text: Ella checks the gauge and then glances at the map on her lap.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Let’s stop at Stuckey’s, okay? Like
dialog: we used to. We could get a Pecan
dialog: Log.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Our Stuckey’s, hon. Come on, try to
dialog: remember.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Okay, boss. We’1l do just as you
dialog: say. Like always.
text: Is he looking for a fight? She blows him a raspberry. Then
text: she laughs.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Why are you laughing?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Nothing. Just drive.
scene_heading: EXT. STUCKEY’S - DAY 5
text: The Leisure Seeker cuts across oncoming traffic, causing cars
text: to swerve and horns to sound. It pulls up to a gas pump.
text: Two attendants approach. They are both Middle Eastern in
text: appearance; around thirty years old. They act like a married
text: couple. The FEMALE ATTENDANT washes windows while the MALE
text: ATTENDANT starts to pump gas. Meanwhile, Ella stares at the
text: station’s boarded-up windows.
dialog: Scene 5
dialog: Page 6.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Is the store closed? We really
dialog: wanted one of your delicious Pecan
dialog: Logs.
speaker_heading: MALE ATTENDANT
dialog: (accent)
text: Opening soon. Just gas now.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: No, I can’t believe it. You hearing
dialog: this, hon?
text: John nods, imperceptibly, although he doesn’t seem much
text: interested. So Ella makes friends with the attendant.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Every summer we’d head south, and
dialog: we always stopped at Stuckey’s.
dialog: Jane and Will - the kids - they’d
dialog: make us stock up on Pecan Logs.
speaker_heading: MALE ATTENDANT
dialog: Yes, I see.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: We were visiting my family in South
dialog: Carolina. That’s where I’m from.
dialog: John, on the other hand, he’s a
dialog: real Yankee. Born and bred.
speaker_heading: MALE ATTENDANT
dialog: Ah, okay.
text: He exchanges a puzzled look with the Female Attendant, who,
text: after finishing the windshield, walks away grinning.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: They were lovely trips. Right,
dialog: John? I guess I’m just a natural
dialog: born tourist. I love to travel.
dialog: Smoky Mountains, Six Flags,
dialog: Williamsburg... you ever been to
dialog: any of those places?
speaker_heading: MALE ATTENDANT
dialog: We are from Syria.
dialog: Scene 5 Page 7.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Well, they’re amazing. You should
dialog: take the family. Do you have
dialog: children?
text: The man’s face darkens momentarily with sadness. But he
text: overcomes it.
speaker_heading: MALE ATTENDANT
dialog: That’1ll be ninety-one dollars,
dialog: ma’am.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Certainly.
text: She pulls money from her purse and leans out the window to
text: hand it to him. As she does, she quietly confides:
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: John is a much more sophisticated
dialog: tourist than me. Oh, he likes to
dialog: travel, but he thinks travel should
dialog: broaden the intellectual horizons,
dialog: whatever that’s supposed to mean...
text: The attendant pockets the money and gives her a curt nod.
speaker_heading: MALE ATTENDANT
dialog: Have a very nice journey.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Thank you, and I’m sorry if I spoke
dialog: too much. I do love to chitchat.
dialog: (to John) Let’s roll, hon!
text: John does as he’s told, putting the camper in gear, but as
text: soon as they start to move the Female Attendant waves them to
text: a stop. There’s something in her hand.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPER, MOVING - DAY 6
text: As the camper rolls down the highway, a satisfied Ella
text: unwraps the Pecan Log.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: What a nice woman! She found one in
text: the storeroom. (She puts on her
dialog: reading glasses) Its expiry date
dialog: was last April, but it’1l still be
dialog: all right, don’t you think? You
dialog: want half, hon?
dialog: Scene 6 Page 8.
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: I want a burger.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: It’s not lunch time yet. There was
dialog: something sweet about that woman.
dialog: She had such pretty eyes. Pretty,
dialog: but sad. They both did. Don’t you
dialog: think, John?
text: John seems to consider her question, but then, as if saying
dialog: it for the first time:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I want a burger.
text: Is his persistence obsessive? Spiteful? Ella sighs, her
text: cheerfulness vanishing momentarily.
scene_heading: EXT. METRO CAFE - DAY 7
text: The Leisure Seeker pulls over next to other vehicles in front
text: of the Metro Café, a restaurant topped by a big plastic
text: hamburger sculpture.
scene_heading: INT. METRO CAFE -— DAY 8
speaker_heading: CHANTAL
dialog: Hi, my name is Chantal and I’1l be
dialog: your server!
text: This is said with great enthusiasm. CHANTAL is a very young
text: woman, dressed in a company uniform. She hovers over John and
text: Ella, who are seated in a booth by the window.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Hello, Chantal. I’m Ella and this
dialog: is John. Looks like you’re stuck
dialog: with us!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I want a burger.
speaker_heading: CHANTAL
dialog: Might I recommend the Chow Attack?
dialog: Only $9.99. That comes with a
text: burger, large fries, a slice of
dialog: apple pie and a Happy Swirl...
dialog: Scene 8 Page
text: Ella raises her arms to the sky.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Happy Swirl! I have absolutely no
dialog: idea what that could be, but it
dialog: sure sounds promising.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I want a burger.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Chow Attack for Mr. Grumpy here.
speaker_heading: CHANTAL
dialog: Okay. And you madam?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Just water.
speaker_heading: CHANTAL
dialog: Nothing to eat?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I'll just have a sip of his Happy
dialog: Swirl.
speaker_heading: CHANTAL
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: Ah, okay. (to John) Would you like
dialog: anything else to drink? Pepsi?
dialog: Beer?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Burger.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: That will be all.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Burger, please.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Thank you, Chantal.
text: Chantal takes their order on a pad, thanks them, and hurries
text: off. The place is pretty crowded; there are multiple big
text: screens nearby, one with sports highlights, one where
text: candidates debate as part of the ongoing campaign, both with
text: no sound. On another, a music video loudly p
dialog: lays...

scene_heading: EXT. ELLA’S AND JOHN’S HOUSE - DAY 9
text: A dejected Will emerges from his pick-up. Lillian, working in
text: her garden, gives him a questioning look, but he shakes his
text: head. He walks briskly toward his parents’ front door.
text: A woman stands on the front porch, talking on the phone.
text: Will’s older sister JANE.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I know, Dr. Tomachewski... I’m
dialog: fully aware... well, we just have
dialog: to be patient... I don’t know what
dialog: else to say... we’re just hoping
dialog: they haven’t gone too far... okay,
dialog: my brother just pulled up. We’1l
dialog: let you know if we hear anything.
text: She hangs up and looks at Will, who:
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I checked all the supermarkets.
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I seem to remember it was your
dialog: brilliant idea that they keep that
dialog: monstrosity. Not so smart, kiddo.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: There has to be some sort of
dialog: explanation...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: They ran away.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: But from who?
text: And then the phone vibrates and rings in Will’s pocket. He
text: looks at the number in confusion before answering.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello? Mom! Where the fuck are you?
dialog: Scene 10 Page 11.
scene_heading: 10 INTERCUT - INT. METRO CAFE/EXT. ELLA’S AND JOHN’S HOUSE - DAY
dialog: (The screen splits in two?)
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Will, darling, please don’t use
dialog: that language with me.
text: While speaking on the phone, she does not lose sight of her
text: husband, still at the table, absorbed by the big screen TV.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: You need to calm down. If you raise
dialog: your voice again I’1l hang up
dialog: immediately.
text: Jane, who’s come close to hear what’s being said, snatches
text: the phone from her little brother's hands.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Mom, what is this craziness? You
dialog: knew I was coming to get you. Why’d
dialog: you run away?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: We're just taking a little trip,
dialog: Jane. We won’t be gone long.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: A little trip? Where?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: This is something I really needed
dialog: to do with your father.
text: Will, who has put his ear close to the phone, buries his face
text: in his hands when he hears the word ‘trip.’ He begins to pace
dialog: nervously.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I can’t believe this! We'd decided
dialog: everything. Will was going to stay
dialog: with Dad...
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Your father and I didn’t decide a
dialog: thing. You and Will and those quack
dialog: doctors did that for us.
text: Will cannot resist. He grabs the phone back from Jane.
dialog: Scene 10 Page 12.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Mother - you are sick!
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Sick doesn’t quite describe it,
dialog: Will. I’m something else
dialog: altogether.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You cannot be doing this. You tell
dialog: Dad to turn that jalopy around and
dialog: get right back home.
text: Jane leans toward the phone to say:
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You need your treatments, mother.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I've had it up to here with their
dialog: treatment. I’ve been there, I’ve
dialog: done that, it wasn’t pretty.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: They just want to make you better.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Kids, try to understand. Let me
dialog: have this vacation with your
dialog: father.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Vacation! What do you mean,
dialog: vacation?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Mom, you know full well that Dad
dialog: can’t drive in his condition.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Your father’s perfectly capable of
dialog: driving. He’s doing very well.
text: Ella sees that Chantal has delivered their food, and John is
text: energetically telling her something.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Kids, we'll manage. We love you.
text: She hangs up and moves back to the table, where John now
text: harangues an intimidated Chantal.
speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: and that’s all because his prose is
dialog: so seductive you just race across
dialog: the surface having a good time
dialog: never feeling compelled to look
text: beneath it at the profoundly
dialog: intricate construction Hemingway
dialog: created to support it. Joyce knew
dialog: the beauty of it-
dialog: (He looks at Chantal-)
dialog: James Joyce? Great, great writer!
dialog: You should read him. Irish. He
dialog: acclaimed Hemingway. Called him a
dialog: giant. But not here, not in
dialog: America. Here we praise the hell
dialog: out of our brilliant darlings and
dialog: then we kill them. Did you read
dialog: ‘The Indian Camp’? Nick’s dad does
text: a cesarian with a pocket knife and
text: sews it up with fishing line and
dialog: you see it all. You put the story
dialog: down and you suffer an existential
dialog: crisis. The realization that who we
dialog: are ends, that that's it! So
text: beautifully crafted. A work of
dialog: poetry and it’s prose - it’s prose
dialog: that’s poetry!
text: The waitress nods with a polite smile.
speaker_heading: CHANTAL
dialog: No, yeah, I can see that.
dialog: Definitely.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: You can just ignore him, you know.
speaker_heading: CHANTAL
dialog: Oh no, it’s super interesting.
dialog: He’s being very nice...
text: She would like to leave, but John grabs her wrist.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Prose that is poetry. That’s
dialog: Hemingway's secret. Do you have
dialog: any idea how difficult that is to
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: CHANTAL
dialog: For sure.
dialog: Scene 10 Page 14.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: John, sweetheart, leave the poor
dialog: girl alone.
text: She gently pries John’s hand from Chantal’s wrist.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Just don’t confuse his simplicity
dialog: with banality. Did you read...
speaker_heading: CHANTAL
dialog: (moving away)
dialog: You want any special sauces with
dialog: that burger?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Thanks, Chantal, we’re fine.
speaker_heading: CHANTAL
dialog: Enjoy!
text: John turns to Ella, who is removing vials with prescription
text: labels from her purse.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I was wondering if she'd read...
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Eat, John. You want me to cut it up
dialog: for you?
text: John lowers his eyes toward the plate.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Not necessary.
text: He takes a bite.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t forget to take your pills.
text: Ella remembers; she starts to remove her multicolored pills
text: from a tiny compartmented container.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: So how is it?
text: John nods, raises a thumb.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: And now yours.

dialog: Scene 10 Page 15.
text: She hands the box to John, who swallows his pills. She pushes
text: the glass of water toward him.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: I’'ll chase mine with this famous
dialog: Happy Swirl.
text: She swallows her daily dose. Blue pills, white pills. She
text: chases them down with a shot of the frothy drink.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Not bad.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (in exquisite reverie)
dialog: Or maybe the ‘Hills Like White
dialog: Elephants.’ Gosh...
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I remember that one. The guy’s
dialog: telling her to have an abortion,
dialog: but your Hemingway never actually
dialog: writes the word.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Doesn't need to. Prose that is
dialog: poetry. No explanations required.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: It was always so nice when you read
dialog: to me in bed.
scene_heading: INT. ELLA’S AND JOHN’S KITCHEN - DAY 11
text: Jane sits in the kitchen with a steaming cup of coffee and a
text: slice of Will’s cake. He’s still very upset.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I don’t see how you can just sit
dialog: there eating. We should call the
dialog: police. And get Andy to track their
dialog: credit card spending.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Hopefully Mom hasn’t lost her
dialog: marbles now as well. Maybe they’re
dialog: just out for a short spin. I mean,

text: she continues to eat as if it’s
dialog: nothing!
text: Jane tries to calm her brother.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Sit down, Will. Let’s think this
dialog: through.
text: At this moment, Lillian opens the door and walks right in.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Yoo hoo? Any news? Have you heard
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Not yet.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Hey, Lillian. Have a piece of

speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Yes, John. You were there and I was

dialog: Scene 12 Page 17.
text: She shouts because an SUV has cut into their lane. Ella
text: braces her feet and closes her eyes, waiting for the impact.
text: But John brakes in time as he instinctively reaches out an
text: arm to protect his wife. The camper swerves. Sunglasses, maps
text: and guidebooks fly off the dashboard. A door slams at the
text: back of the camper as other objects crash to the floor.
text: Meanwhile, the SUV accelerates away. The camper steadies.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We're fine.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: That was amazing, John.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I still have it, don’t I?
text: Showing off, he drives for a moment using just his knees to
text: steer. She smiles lovingly at him, unconcerned by any
dialog: potential danger.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Yes you do.
text: John puts his hands back on the wheel, his eyes on an array
text: of road signs. One points to Philadelphia and Baltimore.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: That way, okay? Old Route 1. You
dialog: remember the road? We took it a
dialog: thousand times.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We're heading south?
speaker_heading: ELLA

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: They're all dead. (muttering) Like

speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I wonder if they’re having fun up
dialog: there, if it’s a joyous place,
dialog: where you sing and dance while
dialog: drinking Happy Swirls all day. What
dialog: do you think happens, you know,
dialog: after? John?

dialog: McGee...
scene_heading: EXT. CHESTER PARK FAMILY CAMPSITE - DAY 13
text: The Leisure Seeker idles in front of the reception hut, while
scene_heading: ...THE SONG CONTINUES, NOW
scene_heading: SUNG BY JANIS JOPLIN...
text: We see Ella lean toward the receptionist to deliver documents
dialog: and money.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The Leisure Seeker slowly rolls to a stop between mighty oaks
text: in front of the lake. Modern campers are parked on either
dialog: side.
dialog: Scene 13 Page 19.
text: With well-practiced gestures, repeated many times over the
text: years, John connects the RV’s electric cable to a big socket,
text: then firmly fastens the water supply hose.
text: Meanwhile, inside the camper, Ella leans forward to seal the

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: At their portable picnic table, John eats the sandwiches Ella

text: THE CHIRPING OF CRICKETS
text: She cranes her neck to see what John’s up to...
text: «+. he’s lying on a bench sofa in the dinette, taking a nap.
text: And then a family returns to a neighboring camper: husband
text: and wife, a kid, a baby sleeping in its mother’s arms.
scene_heading: NEIGHBORING CAMPERS
dialog: Hey! -
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (friendly)
dialog: Hi there!
text: While his wife puts the children to sleep, the MALE CAMPER
text: wanders over to admire the old Leisure Seeker.
speaker_heading: MALE CAMPER
dialog: Whoa, check it out. ‘75 Winnebago
dialog: Indian.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: It was a gift from my parents so
dialog: we'd come visit them. Our Leisure
dialog: Seeker. My husband hated it at
dialog: first - he used to say it was kinda
dialog: low class. But he got used to it
dialog: in the end. We’ve had a lot of
dialog: great trips in this old rust-
dialog: bucket.
dialog: Scene 14
dialog: Page 20.
speaker_heading: MALE CAMPER
dialog: Chevy Series G engine.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Oh, you'd have to ask John about
text: all that. Though he’s taking a nap
dialog: right now.
text: The FEMALE CAMPER appears.
speaker_heading: MALE CAMPER
dialog: Look at this old beauty, babe. So
dialog: have you folks been on the road
dialog: long?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Actually, we just started. We’re
dialog: headed south, down to where I grew
dialog: up, between Charleston and
dialog: Savannah.
speaker_heading: FEMALE CAMPER
dialog: It’s so beautiful there!
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Yeah, we'd always go on vacation
dialog: there. But this time we’re going
dialog: even further south. All the way
text: down to the Florida Keys.
speaker_heading: MALE CAMPER
dialog: Wow!
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I’m finally taking John to
dialog: Hemingway's house in Key West -
dialog: have you ever been?
text: They both shake their heads.
speaker_heading: MALE CAMPER
dialog: Now, Hemingway was a Confederate
dialog: general, right?
speaker_heading: FEMALE CAMPER
dialog: No, silly, he was a writer. Didn't
dialog: he commit suicide?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Yes. I never understood why...
dialog: Scene 14 Page 21.
text: Ella's voice trails off. For a moment, she seems deeply moved
text: and lost in thought, as if she’s only now beginning to
text: understand why. But then she snaps out of it.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: John knows everything about him.
dialog: He’s always wanted to see that
dialog: house. Every year I’d promise him
dialog: we'd go, but, you know how it is
dialog: travelling with little kids... of
dialog: course we've been to Melville's
dialog: place. That’s just a few hours
dialog: from our house. Have you been
dialog: there? He wrote Moby Dick. It’s
dialog: very interesting.
text: Her neighbors nod, not knowing what to make of all this.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: .». it was actually a big pain in
dialog: the rear for me and Will (she
dialog: laughs). My daughter loved it. I
dialog: think that’s why she became a
text: professor. John is so proud of her.
dialog: He’s a teacher too.
text: The neighbors continue to smile, though now they exchange a
text: look, wondering how to escape this talkative lady.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Poor Will, on the other hand, he’s
text: still struggling to find his way...
text: The Male Camper pats his pockets, looking desperately at his
text: wife - time to go - but then John appears at the door of the
text: Leisure Seeker, looking groggy, his hair out of place.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Where are we? We’re not home.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: No, honey. We live in
dialog: Massachusetts. This is
dialog: Pennsylvania.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What the dickens are we doing in
dialog: Pennsylvania?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: We're on vacation. And we're having
dialog: a whale of a time, right?
dialog: Scene 14 Page 22.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Not me. I want a cup of tea.
text: He sits next to Ella, who smiles bravely at the neighbors.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: My husband John. And these are our
dialog: neighbors...?
speaker_heading: MALE CAMPER
dialog: Bob Taylor. And this is my wife
dialog: Janette. Hate to say it, but...
speaker_heading: FEMALE CAMPER
dialog: -..-it’s a little late...
speaker_heading: MALE CAMPER
dialog: ...uhm, yeah, we need to put the
dialog: kids to sleep...
text: They flee.
speaker_heading: MALE CAMPER (CONT’D)
dialog: Maybe catch you later...
speaker_heading: FEMALE CAMPER
dialog: Yes, maybe...
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I hope so! (hisses to John) Just
dialog: Say goodbye...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I want a cup of tea.
text: Ella smiles at the neighbors, as if to apologize. After they
text: close the door, she turns to John in irritation.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I’1ll make your tea when I’m good
dialog: and ready. I’m quite comfortable
dialog: sitting here.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: But I want it now.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: You'll just be up peeing all night.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (raising his voice)
dialog: I want a cup of tea!
dialog: 15
dialog: Scene 14 Page 23.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Lower your voice, mister. We’re not
dialog: the only ones here. In fact, make
dialog: it yourself. You’re not an invalid.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That’s exactly what I’1l1 do.
text: Instead, he stays seated, immobile. After a moment, Ella
text: reaches out to smooth his hair. The gesture placates John,
text: who asks, gently now, as if he’s just thought of it for the
dialog: first time:
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you say - how about a cuppa
dialog: tea?
text: Ella looks up at the sky, then smiles and sighs as she rises.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I give up.
text: She walks off.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (calls to her)
text: Dodge 440 V8 engine, by the way.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPER - NIGHT 15
text: John and Ella open the bed in the dinette, with coordinated
text: gestures, as they’ve done so many times. Then John gets under
text: the covers. Ella sits near him, putting drops into a glass
text: illuminated by a small light.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Here, drink it all.
text: She gives him two tablets that John chases down with the drop-
text: filled water. And then she caresses him like he’s her child.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: John sleeps noisily back in the darkened camper. Ella sits at
text: a small table, writing what appears to be a letter on a sheet
text: of paper. But then she grimaces in real pain. She pops two
text: blue Oxycodone pills from a blister packet and chases them
text: down with a swig from a bottle of Canadian Club.
dialog: 16
dialog: Scene 16 Page 24.
scene_heading: EXT. CHESTER PARK FAMILY CAMPSITE/INT. CAMPER - DAY 16
text: The Taylor family’s camper starts up and rolls away,
text: revealing the Leisure Seeker, from which John, still in
text: pajamas, emerges to check a small water filter on the side of
text: the camper. He nods, smiling to himself. And then he goes
dialog: inside.
text: Ella was sleeping, for the first time we see her short
text: haircut post-chemo style. His bustling wakes her.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Good morning, Johnny my dear.
text: She combs out her spectacular wig that has spent the night on
text: a Styrofoam head on the nightstand, then puts it on.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It occurred to me this morning to
dialog: replace the water filter, so I did
dialog: but I didn’t, amazingly the darn
dialog: thing’s still clean as a whistle.
text: He closes the door; she sits up.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: I find myself compelled to admit
dialog: this old contraption has its good
dialog: points. There are of course, more
dialog: elegant ways to travel, but there
dialog: is no denying that one sleeps
dialog: extremely well in that stupid bed.
dialog: How about you, my princess? Did you
dialog: sleep well?
text: John’s speech seems different, more relaxed, less catatonic.
text: He’s in a good mood. Ella is pleasantly surprised.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I’m so happy when you come back to
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I was just outside. Your pain?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I’m fine.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Where are we exactly?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Chester County, south of
dialog: Philadelphia.
dialog: Scene 16
dialog: Page 24A.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Chester County? Some really
dialog: beautiful country around here.
dialog: Country imbued with history. It’s
dialog: so good to be back on the road
dialog: again. I love it. It makes us so
dialog: happy. lLet’s have some coffee!
dialog: 17
dialog: Scene 16 Page 25.
text: Ella watches John as he reaches the coffee machine. But
text: suddenly he stops and looks around, bewildered. She continues
text: to watch him, growing worried now.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: John?
text: He looks at her, disoriented.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s happening?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Where are we?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: It’s so nice when you forget to be
dialog: forgetful. Too bad it ends so
dialog: quickly. I just can’t get used to
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What are you saying?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Nothing. Let me make the coffee.
dialog: You should get dressed, my love.
text: John smiles at her but does not move. Ella grasps him gently
text: by the arm and moves him toward the bed.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, slow-poke.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPER, MOVING. DAY. 17
text: The Leisure Seeker moves down Route 1, passing the skylines
dialog: of Baltimore and Washington. The road is ugly here. There are
text: car repair shops, fast food restaurants, Walmarts and cheap
dialog: furniture outlets.
text: Ella does not like what she’s seeing. She has the map open on
text: her lap, while John, dressed in a checkered shirt, drives
text: with his usual absorption.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: How ‘bout we stop at Old
dialog: Chesapeake? The children loved it
dialog: and you didn’t mind it so much, did
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: Scene 17 JOHN Page 26.
dialog: Old what?
speaker_heading: ELLA
text: The historical village in Virginia.
dialog: You used to love the museum...
text: After a moment’s silence John murmurs.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Maybe Dan isn’t, after all.
text: Ella looks at him in confusion.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He’s not dead, is he?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Dan. You want to go to him.
text: Ella sits in baffled silence.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Who the hell is Dan?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (very serious)
dialog: We'd visit your relatives so you
dialog: could secretly meet him.
text: Ella finally understands what he’s talking about, but is
text: still incredulous.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Oh my God... Daniel Coleman?
text: She looks at him, expecting more, but he’s fallen silent.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: (dumbfounded)
dialog: What is going on in your mind?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You’re like Gretta.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Who?
dialog: Scene 17
dialog: Page 27.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: “Yes, the newspapers were right:
dialog: snow was general all over
dialog: Ireland...”
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: What on earth are you...?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: “It was falling on every part of
text: the dark central plain, on the
text: treeless hills, on the Bog of Allen
dialog: and, farther westward, softly
text: falling into the dark mutinous
dialog: Shannon waves...”
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Here we go again.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: “It was falling, too, upon every
text: part of the lonely churchyard on
dialog: the hill where Michael Furey lay
text: buried. It lay thickly drifted on
text: the crooked crosses and headstones,
text: on the spears of the little gate,
text: on the barren thorns.”
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: All right ...
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: “,..his soul swooned slowly as he
dialog: heard the snow falling faintly
dialog: through the universe and faintly
text: falling, like the descent of their
dialog: last end, upon all the living and
dialog: the dead.”
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: All right, I get it, that story by
dialog: Melville, you don't have to recite
dialog: the whole damned thing...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: James Joyce.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I’m glad to know there are at least
dialog: some things you remember well.
dialog: Scene 17 Page 28.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Gretta Conroy. You’re just like
dialog: her. You’ve thought of him your
dialog: whole life.
text: Ella can’t believe this is happening. Smiling, she tells him:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: What on earth are you talking
dialog: about? John?
text: She takes his arm and shakes him. He keeps his eyes on the
text: road, muttering almost to himself.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We'd go to Charleston and you’d
dialog: slink off to Savannah. Saying you
dialog: were going to see your aunt.
text: Ella shakes her head, and then bursts into laughter.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I can’t believe this. But you
dialog: should know, if Daniel Coleman is
dialog: alive - and that’s a big if - he’s
dialog: been living in Daytona for the past
dialog: thirty years.
text: She closely watches John, who is now driving in silence.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: You hear me?
text: She sighs, then mutters to herself, still in a state of
dialog: shock.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Dan Coleman. Honestly. Of all
dialog: the...
text: John, eyes fixed on the road ahead, asks:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Ella, where’s my gun?
text: Ella watches her husband closely.
dialog: Scene 17 Page 29.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: What? We didn’t bring the gun...
text: John doesn’t answer. Ella’s mind is working: why would he ask
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: OMITTED 18
scene_heading: EXT. OLD CHESAPEAKE TICKET OFFICE - DAY 19
text: Soldiers in eighteenth-century uniforms raise their muzzle-
text: loading muskets and shoot, producing a cloud of white smoke.
text: John watches the performance. He’s in line behind Ella and
text: other tourists at the ticket window.
speaker_heading: TICKET SELLER (0.S.)
dialog: Two people, single day. That’1l be
dialog: 88 dollars, ma’am.
text: The young man in the ticket booth, also dressed in 18th-
text: century clothes, hands Ella a “Citizen Passport”:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Goodness, you’ve become pricey!
text: She reaches for her wallet.
speaker_heading: TICKET SELLER
dialog: It’s $40.99 per ticket, plus taxes.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: When we used to come here with the
dialog: kids, it was 10 dollars for the
dialog: whole family.
speaker_heading: TICKET SELLER
dialog: When was this? Back when we were a
dialog: colony?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: That’s not a very nice thing to
dialog: say.
speaker_heading: TICKET SELLER
dialog: Enjoy your visit.
dialog: Scene 20. Page 30.
scene_heading: EXT. OLD CHESAPEAKE - DAY 20.
text: Horse-drawn carriages move through a replica 18th-century
text: village. A military band plays:
speaker_heading: YANKEE DOODLE
text: Ella and John hover near a group of tourists, as a guide
dialog: describes (and perhaps exaggerates) the history of the
text: colony. John lingers in front of a group of African-American
text: actors portraying slaves. White actors bark orders at them.
text: Ella wants to drag John away, but he resists, grumbling:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: This is awful.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Darling, come on...
text: Ella takes him firmly by the arm and leads him toward a group
text: of tourists entering one of the buildings.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (whispers) We have to do something
dialog: to stop this outrage...
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: It’s all make-believe...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That’s just your southern racism
dialog: talking.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: What utter nonsense! Come on, let’s
dialog: go see the library. You used to
dialog: love that.
text: John reluctantly follows her. We notice a young woman with
text: two young children, a boy and a girl, in the tour group.
text: JENNIFER. She watches John until she gets up the nerve to
text: approach him.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Mr. Spencer?
text: John looks at her blankly.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s me. Jennifer Ward. Class of
dialog: ‘93. How are you?
dialog: Scene 20. Page 31.
text: Ella interrupts.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I’m sorry, Miss, but I don’t think
dialog: my husband is able to...
text: But John perks up before she can finish.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Jenny Ward! It’s you! How the devil
dialog: are you?
text: Jennifer is almost overwhelmed with emotion.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I am so, so happy to see you!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: How did you get on at Columbia? You
dialog: must have graduated by now...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I can’t believe you remember me.
text: A surprised Ella follows the conversation.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I can’t believe it, either.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: A lot has happened since then.
dialog: Michael, Emily, this is Mr.
dialog: Spencer, the most inspiring teacher
dialog: I ever had.
text: The boy and girl wave shyly.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Hello, Mr. Spencer.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What was the name of that friend of
dialog: yours?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Lorna Mitchell?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: The two of you were always
dialog: laughing.
text: Jennifer is getting emotional as she remembers.
dialog: Scene 20. Page 32.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (sighs, perhaps a little
dialog: bitterly)
dialog: Yes, I was. I’m sorry if I’ve
dialog: disturbed you. I’m just so happy to
dialog: see you.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Oh, me too, Jenny. Me too!
text: She wanders on ahead with her children. Ella, meanwhile,
text: stares at her husband in annoyance.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (mocking)
dialog: Me too, Jenny. You can’t remember
dialog: the names of your own children but
dialog: you remember that Jenny was always
dialog: laughing. I’m speechless. What goes
dialog: on in that head of yours?
text: She takes him away, as he says:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: She was such a good student.
scene_heading: 21 INT. CAMPER, MOVING - DAY 21
text: On the road again. Ella looks tired and achy. She takes her
text: painkillers from her purse and swallows them with a drink of
text: bottled water.
text: John turns to her, worried.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You all right?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Yes, John. I’m just dandy.
text: John keeps one eye on the road and one on Ella, as if
text: studying her.
text: Ella sighs.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Who am I?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: Scene 21 Page 33.
text: As he says this he reaches over and touches her, is dear to
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: You're having one of your moments,
dialog: aren’t you?
text: John gives her a quizzical look.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: You know I’m someone dear to you,
dialog: but you’re not exactly sure who.
text: He smiles but doesn’t answer. She persists:
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Seriously, John - do you know who I
dialog: am?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Of course I do. Goodness me...
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Who? Who am I? John, tell me who I
dialog: am.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Give me a second, alright? I’m
dialog: thinking.
text: Ella places a hand on his arm.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: John, tell me who I am.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You don’t know? Well I’1l tell you.
dialog: You're my wife.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Very good. But what’s my name?
text: John continues to look ahead, his eyes on the road, but he
text: seems uneasy. Ella doesn’t stop looking at him. She’s
text: waiting. And then it bursts out of his mouth.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (snorts)
dialog: Goddamnit, will you ever stop with
dialog: all these stupid questions - ELLA!
text: Then, softly repeated.
dialog: Scene 21 Page 33A.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: (in dismay)
dialog: Ella! My memory...
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: You knoew it. It was always there-
text: Ella doesn't stop looking at him. She’s waiting. And then,
text: out of nowhere, it bursts out of his mouth, then is softly
dialog: repeated:
dialog: Scene 21 Page 34.
text: With the palm of his hand John hits his empty head.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Keep your eyes on the road.
text: The Leisure Seeker rolls on toward North Carolina.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPER/EXT. SMALL TOWN, SOUTHERN VIRGINIA - DAY 22
dialog: Ella had fallen asleep. But then:
text: THE SOUND OF A HORN
text: ++. makes her open her eyes. She realizes that the camper has
text: stopped at a green light and John is not behind the wheel.
text: She looks around the interior of the van, dazed and worried.
text: Outside the window, she can see the modest houses of a small
text: town. She turns to look through the back window and sees a
text: line of stalled traffic. Some of the cars go screeching
text: around her, other drivers are out of their vehicles, cursing
dialog: the camper.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (murmurs )
dialog: Good Lord, where is he now?
text: Finally she sees him: he’s just reached the sidewalk across
text: the street. Patrons of a nearby bar come out to watch,
text: curious, laughing, shaking their heads. John mixes among
text: them, idly watching the traffic jam like it has nothing to do
dialog: with him.
text: Ella slaps the windshield:
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: John!
text: She leans on the horn.
text: A MALE DRIVER approaches her window.
speaker_heading: MALE DRIVER
dialog: Ma’‘am? Do you need some help?
dialog: Scene 22 Page 35.
text: A FEMALE DRIVER has come out of her car.
speaker_heading: FEMALE DRIVER
dialog: Could I move your vehicle for you?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I'm sorry, please, just give me a
dialog: minute...
text: Ella opens the door, gets out and strides across the road.
text: Everybody's watching her, enjoying her distress.
text: Ella reaches John, hissing through clenched teeth:
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing? Come with me,
dialog: you fool.
text: She takes him by the arm and drags him toward the camper,
text: pushing him back on board, then hurries to get in her side.
text: By now they are the center of attention. Everybody’s watching
text: them, laughing.
text: John is back behind the wheel. But he doesn’t do anything.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, drive! Can’t you see we’re
dialog: holding up the whole show?
text: John looks at the dashboard in profound confusion, as if he’s
dialog: never seen anything like this before. The gauges, the knobs,
text: the lights, the key in the ignition. It might as well be the
text: cockpit of a 747. He places his hand gently on the steering
text: wheel, touching it as if it is made of a precious substance.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What do I do?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Turn on the engine. Come on, John,
dialog: concentrate. Just turn the key.
text: She raises her voice because once again because:
speaker_heading: HORNS SOUND
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: (turns around, shouting)
dialog: Just a minute! We’re leaving!
dialog: (hisses at John) Please, turn the
dialog: key. Get going.
dialog: Scene 22 Page 36.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Get going?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Right. Just relax. You know how to
dialog: do this. You've always been a
dialog: wonderful driver.
text: But then John takes his hands off the wheel. Ella’s really
dialog: worried now.
text: A car with flashing lights pulls up. A POLICEWOMAN gets out.
text: She's pregnant, six months at least. She approaches John’s
text: side of the camper.
speaker_heading: PREGNANT COP
dialog: What seems to be the problem?
dialog: You're blocking traffic. You have a

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No, ma’am.
speaker_heading: PREGNANT COP
dialog: Okay, then why aren’t you moving?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Good point, officer.
text: John, watched by an astonished Ella, turns the key, starts

text: An incredulous Ella bursts into laughter.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: You really are going to drive me

text: Ella sits at a picnic table scattered with brochures and
text: maps. Sipping from a bottle of soda, she studies a Florida
text: guidebook. She turns toward the camper and says in a raised
dialog: voice:
dialog: Scene 23
dialog: Page 37.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Hey hon, did you know that
dialog: Tennessee Williams had a house in
dialog: Key West, too? He’s one of the
dialog: writers you really love, isn’t he?
dialog: I remember when you took me to the
dialog: theater to see that one set in New
dialog: Orleans... you hear me, John?
text: She mutters to herself:
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Though I preferred the film with
dialog: Marlon Brando. What a dish!
text: John comes down the camper’s steps, looking alarmed.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Ella? Ella? Where are the kids?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: At home.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We left them at the house? I can’t
dialog: believe it.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: John, please...
text: Ella understands that John is having one of his “moments.”
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: For God’s sake, what have we done?
dialog: We've left the children on their
dialog: own!
text: Ella impatiently slams the guidebook on the table:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: The children are all grown up! It
dialog: won’t be long until they're old.
dialog: They have their own lives - they’re
dialog: fine.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: Seriously?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Oh my god. Jane’s married to
dialog: Philip, she teaches college.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: Scene 23 Page 38.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: They've got two kids, a boy and a
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Yes, John, don’t you remember? Good
text: heavens. Rose and Stephen.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Toddlers, right?
text: This seems to calm him. He sits next to Ella.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: They’re very cute.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (sighs) Stephen’s nineteen and Rose
dialog: is twenty-one. Don’t you remember
dialog: her high school graduation
dialog: ceremony? Stephen played in the
dialog: band and Rosie made a wonderful
dialog: speech. You were very moved by it.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Stephen played... Rosie made a
dialog: wonderful speech...
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (hopeful)
dialog: So you do remember.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No. I don’t.
text: Now Ella’s really angry.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: It really hurts me that you don’t
dialog: remember things. I’m sick and tired
dialog: of having to remember everything
dialog: for you.
text: There’s a profound silence. A mortified John murmurs:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Forgive me, Ella.
text: Ella realizes that she’s gone too far. Now she feels worse
dialog: than he does.
dialog: 24
dialog: Scene 23 Page 39.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: No, forgive me, my love. I
dialog: shouldn't get angry with you.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It’s my damned memory.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I know. Come here.
text: She takes his hand, she strokes his beard. But after several
dialog: seconds he again asks:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Ella, where are the kids?
text: Ella sighs and stands.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Come on, there’s something we need
dialog: to do. I brought along a surprise.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPSITE, NORTH CAROLINA - NIGHT 24
text: Slightly grainy pictures from a birthday party circa 1972.
text: Ella, in her thirties, has a kid on her knee who’s in the
text: process of blowing out three candles.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Which one is this, John? Do you
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It’s Jane.
text: A slide projector on the picnic table casts images on a sheet
text: strung between two oaks. Ella and John sit as if they’re at
text: the cinema. Ella works the control button on her lap.
text: Other images appear. In one, from 1974, Ella grasps Jane's
text: hand as she holds Will in her arms by a river.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: And where are we in this one?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Ella! Look at you!
dialog: It’s true: she was very beautiful. It’s also clear that John
dialog: loved to photograph her. In many of the photos, the children
text: are cut off in the frame.
dialog: Scene 24
dialog: Page 40.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Chowan River. That marvelous
dialog: camping spot at Catherine Creek. We
dialog: could put up our own landmark
dialog: there.
text: Another slide. Here, finally, is John, from thirty years ago;
text: blurry and slightly crooked, embracing Ella.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Jane took this one.
text: John smiles. Next comes a photo which depicts a crowd of
text: Thanksgiving guests. Ella, however, stands apart.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You were sad that evening.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I remember you telling me to make a
dialog: happy face, but I just couldn’t do
dialog: it. What year was that?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You were sad.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Perhaps ‘81. ‘82...
text: She presses the control switch.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you remember these kids?
text: She's pointing to a group of boys and girls throwing a party
dialog: for John.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Your nieces and nephews? Down in
dialog: Charleston?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: No, they’re your students, throwing
dialog: you a birthday party. This was your
dialog: favorite class... do you remember?
text: John says neither yes or no, but he continues to closely
dialog: study the photo.
text: Meanwhile curious campers gather around, notably an elderly
text: couple, who watch Ella’s and John’s life like it was their
dialog: own.
dialog: Scene 24 Page 41.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY WOMAN
dialog: We should do this, too. We have all
dialog: those slides in the basement that
dialog: we never look at...
dialog: And meanwhile...
text: TO THE SOUND OF AN OLD STEVIE
speaker_heading: WONDER SONG ("IF IT’S MAGIC”]
dialog: .». here are other photos, of trips, dinners, backyard
text: barbecues; the happiness and melancholy of an entire life.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. CAMPER - DAY 25
speaker_heading: THE SONG CONTINUES
text: Ella and John sleep in each others’ arms. Morning light seeps
text: through the cracks in the curtains. This is perhaps what
text: causes Ella’s eyes to fall open. She gently pulls down the
text: covers and runs her hand along the mattress. John has wet the
text: bed. Ella shakes him awake.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: She helps him wash with a sponge, and then dry himself with a
dialog: towel. Meanwhile:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I bought you six new pairs of
dialog: boxers - didn’t you see? Why don’t
dialog: you wear them?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I don’t like them.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I don’t like them.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Same old song I’ve heard my whole
dialog: life. What’s so great about briefs?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Control.
dialog: Scene 25 Page 42.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Hal
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: THE SONG CONTINUES
text: Outside the camper, Ella and John perform a sort of
text: gymnastics together. Ella gives commands like a trainer. And
text: then John wanders off to parts unknown.
text: Ella shouts after him.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: No, no! Where are you going?
dialog: Johnnnnn...
speaker_heading: THE SONG ENDS
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPER, MOVING/EXT. ALTERNATIVE FARM STAND - DAY 26
text: The Leisure Seeker passes through fields of grapevines. It
text: winds up at a cabin where a young farm couple with an
dialog: alternative air about them sell organic grapes and grape
dialog: juice.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: John and Ella are sitting at a picnic table, having a
text: breakfast of grapes. They’re the only customers. They eat
text: one at a time, in silence, savoring them, as cars race by.
text: At one point John plucks his handkerchief from his breast
text: pocket and gently cleans a drop of juice from Ella’s chin.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Do you know what I love about you,
dialog: John? Your silences are never
dialog: embarrassing. Never once in my life
dialog: have I thought: now I need to say
dialog: something. It’s the thing I’ve
dialog: always liked the best about our
dialog: trips.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: So you still see him.
text: John speaks this phrase abruptly, as if part of an ongoing
text: conversation. Ella gives him a confused look:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: Scene 26 Page 43.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You speak with him on the phone.
dialog: You write him letters.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: Ah, so now we're pretending like
dialog: you don’t know... Dan. You said
dialog: he’s living in Daytona now.
text: Ella starts to laugh again.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Dan. Oh, Dan. Susan Sullivan told
dialog: us that at Maggie Tate’s funeral.
dialog: You were right there beside me!
text: John does not seem convinced.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: But you asked about him.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: What? John, the funeral was ten,
dialog: no, fifteen years ago
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (sad)
dialog: All these lies. All these years.
text: John stands up and goes back into the camper, muttering,
text: leaving Ella in amazement at the table.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: John? What are you doing? Get back
dialog: here.
text: The FARM WIFE approaches with a refill. She smiles
text: sympathetically. Ella feels encouraged.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you believe this? He's
dialog: convinced that I still think about
dialog: my first boyfriend, who, by the
dialog: way, dumped me. But Dan was right.
dialog: Things would have never worked
dialog: between us. Those were different
dialog: times. I was nineteen. Oh, my
dialog: lord, what a scandal...
dialog: 27
dialog: Scene 26 Page 44.
text: The hippy-farmers nod sympathetically.
speaker_heading: FARM WIFE
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Well they sent me to Boston to work
dialog: in my Aunt Rosemary's shop. That's
dialog: where I met John, this handsome
dialog: young teacher who came every week
dialog: to buy a new pair of leather
text: gloves. Then he came back the next
dialog: week to buy another pair - he said
dialog: he’d lost them. And then he did it
dialog: again. I eventually discovered he
text: had a house full of them.
dialog: Ella wants to be sure that this woman understands her story.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: He was the one for me...
text: The woman gently asks her:
speaker_heading: FARM WIFE
dialog: And the first boyfriend, you didn’t
dialog: think about him any more?
text: Ella considers this for a moment.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: He vanished from my mind. No, I
dialog: only had eyes for John!
scene_heading: INTERCUT - INT SOUTH CAROLINA SERVICE STATION/INT. WILL'S 27
speaker_heading: GARAGE - DAY
text: Ella dials a public phone inside a service station in South
dialog: Carolina.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: How are you, darling?
text: Will jumps to his feet; papers and trinkets fly off his
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Mother, where are you?
text: He’s answered the phone in his garage, which serves as the
text: warehouse for his webshop. It’s packed with modern antiques:
text: old road signs, toys, a pinball machine, Bakelite telephones.
dialog: Scene 27 Page 45.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: For God’s sake, tell me where you
dialog: are so I can come get you
dialog: immediately!
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Now listen Will. We looked at
dialog: family slides last night. It was
dialog: beautiful. We were looking at
dialog: photos from our trip to Nantucket,
dialog: where you made such good friends
dialog: with that boy from New York. What
dialog: was his name - Patrick?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You listen to me, Mom. Jane and I
dialog: are seriously thinking about filing
dialog: a missing persons report.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: He was so nice. I’ve been wondering
dialog: - are you happy with your new work?
dialog: You were such a good real estate
dialog: broker. You were able to sell some
dialog: truly ugly houses...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Don’t change the subject.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Was it because you had a fight with
dialog: your partner? You and Richard were
dialog: so close... were you two ...?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You need to come back and resume
dialog: your therapy. It’s crucial, mother.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Come on, Will, please talk to me
dialog: about... oh Christ!
text: Ella cannot believe what she’s seeing. Now seated behind the
text: wheel, John starts the motor and the Leisure Seeker begins to
dialog: move.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What did you say? Mom?
text: But Ella has dropped the receiver without even putting it on
text: its hook. She rushes outside.
dialog: Scene 27 Page 46.
text: Meanwhile, the camper is leaving the service area. John puts
text: on the turn signal as Ella shouts and waves...
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: John! John! Stop! STOP!
text: ..-but he joins the highway and disappears.
text: Will is shouting on the telephone:
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Mom! What’s happening? You’re
dialog: killing me! MOTHER!!!
text: The Young Attendant, who has begun to pump gas into a Harley-
text: Davidson, looks at Ella and then looks at the camper pulling
text: away. Understanding, he begins to laugh.
scene_heading: YOUNG ATTENDANT
dialog: (to the Motorcyclist)
dialog: Oh shit, it looks like gramps
dialog: forgot his wife.
text: A powerless Ella is in tears. She doesn’t know what to do.
text: She appeals to the Young Attendant.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Help me, please!
text: The MOTORCYCLIST screws on his fuel cap and kick-starts his
dialog: bike.
speaker_heading: MOTORCYCLIST
dialog: Hop aboard.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: On that? How?
speaker_heading: MOTORCYCLIST
dialog: Piece of cake. (to Young Attendant)
dialog: Give her a hand, Joe.
text: The Young Attendant practically lifts Ella in his arms. She
text: lets him do it, and winds up riding behind the driver.
speaker_heading: MOTORCYCLIST (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold on tight!
text: Ella grabs onto the Motorcyclist, who rumbles off.
dialog: Scene 28 Page 47.
scene_heading: 28 EXT. MOTORCYCLE, MOVING, SOUTH CAROLINA ROAD. - DAY 28
text: A few hundred yards down the road, they come upon the Leisure
text: Seeker, rolling briskly along. The Motorcyclist steadies the
text: bike, Ella brandishes her crutch...
text: Inside, John turns to see through his open window this
text: strange guy on a Harley with Ella behind him. They draw
text: closer. John shouts, in an offended tone:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Ella, what the hell are you doing
dialog: on a motorcycle? It’s dangerous for
dialog: God's sake!
scene_heading: 29 INT. CAMPER, MOVING, SOUTH CAROLINA ROAD. DAY 29
text: A furious Ella sits next to John.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I don’t believe you. On a
dialog: motorcycle! Without a helmet! And
dialog: who was that guy?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Oh... go to hell!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: After you, ma’am!
text: Ella stares out the window in silence, determined not to say
text: a word. After a bit John puts a hand on her knee and says:
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: This is a lovely trip, isn’t it?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Go to hell, John. I mean it.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: You left without me.
text: John doesn’t seem to understand.
dialog: Scene 29 Page 48.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (xidiculous)
dialog: I didn't!
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: You left me alone. Where the hell
dialog: did you think you were going, you
dialog: and your empty head?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Me? Going somewhere? Without you?
dialog: Are you crazy?
text: She snorts, tired of this childish bickering. They are silent
text: for a while and then John once again puts a hand on her knee.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: How you doing, little lady?
text: She removes his hand, still shaken, sullen and sore. She
text: rummages through her purse, in search of tablets. She tries
text: to open a bottle of Pepsi but her hands are too shaky. John
text: is watching out of the corner of his eye and reaches for the
dialog: bottle:
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me.
text: She needs to drink it to swallow her pills so reluctantly she
text: lets him take the bottle-
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Be careful, John.
text: John smiles, puts his elbows on the horizontal steering wheel
text: and steers with them as he unscrews the cap, but this action
text: causes the Winnebago to swerve gently back and forth, snaking
text: first left towards the other lane, then right towards the
text: shoulder, until the bottle is opened and he hands it to her.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you. Now please put both
text: hands on the wheel.
text: POV: The Leisure Seeker has been swerving, heading first
text: towards the opposite lane and then back. There is no oncoming
text: traffic but a Toyota traveling in the same direction as the
text: Winnebago is compelled to slow to a crawl and loudly blow its
text: horn as the Winnebago does its Conga Line down the highway.
text: The scene is witnessed by a cop, who hits his lights and
text: starts to chase, passing the Toyota as he turns on:
speaker_heading: A SIREN
dialog: Scene 29 Page 48A.
text: Inside the camper, Ella bolts down three pills, takes a big
text: gulp of Pepsi, then looks in the side mirror.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: John.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yup?
dialog: Scene 29 Page 49.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: You need to pull over.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You need to pee?
speaker_heading: ELLA
text: The police are right behind us.
text: John looks in the mirror.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Pull over.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Why? They don’t want me...
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Damn it John, pull over!
text: Finally John uses the turn signal and pulls over. He puts the
text: vehicle in PARK and TURNS OFF the engine-
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me talk, all right? I need to
dialog: see if that fool son of ours
dialog: snitched on us.
text: They watch as a POLICEMAN gets out of the car and approaches.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: License and registration, please.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: They're in here somewhere, officer.
text: She stands up and opens a hatch above their heads to take out
text: a document case. As she does, we note that there’s a shotgun
text: inside. She closes the door quickly and hands the documents
text: to the cop, who examines them.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Mr. Spencer. I’ve stopped you
dialog: because I saw you weaving between
dialog: lanes.
text: Ella, returning to her seat, seems relieved - Will did not
dialog: call.
dialog: Scene 29 Page 50.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Excuse me, officer, it was my
dialog: fault. I gave the bottle to my
dialog: husband, I couldn’t open it.
text: She shows him the Pepsi. John immediately grabs it and takes
text: a big sip. Ella bites her lip, while the policeman looks at
text: John with astonishment.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Ma’am, if you don’t mind, I’d like
dialog: for Mr. Spencer to answer himself.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (looking seriously at the
dialog: policeman, engaged, eager
dialog: to help)
dialog: Yes, sir. I was trying to open
dialog: the... the thing’n.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: The thing?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That thing.
text: There follows a short, embarrassing silence. Ella wants to
text: help him, but the word comes quietly to John’s head as if
dialog: it’s always been there.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: (as if obviously)
dialog: The bottle.
text: Another long silence, John watches the policeman as he looks
text: closely at both passengers. And then John turns his head to
dialog: Ella and emits:
speaker_heading: A LOUD BURP
text: Ella jolts; she’s right on the edge of losing it. The
text: policeman, after glaring at John, says:
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: I’m going to run your license. Wait
dialog: here.
text: He walks away.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (through clenched teeth)
dialog: What are you, insane?
text: As an answer, John puts his hand on the key and starts the
text: engine. Ella, in desperation, reaches over, turns it off and
text: pulls the key out.
dialog: Scene 29 Page 50A.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Give me back the keys.
dialog: Scene 29 Page 51.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Don’t even think about it.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Give them to me!
text: Ella, getting even more worried, glances in the rearview
text: mirror and whispers.
speaker_heading: ELLA
text: Zip it. He’s coming back.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: What’s going on, old timer? You
dialog: thinking of running on me?
text: He’s smiling, however, and adds:
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN (CONT’D)
dialog: You wanna wind up on World’s
dialog: Slowest Police Chases?
text: Ella laughs and gently claps her hands:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: That’s a good one, officer.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Stay in your lane and respect the
dialog: speed limits, okay?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Yes, officer. Thank you so much.
dialog: And have a nice day!
text: The officer walks away.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (grumbles)
dialog: Slowest Police Chase. Damned fool.
dialog: Who's he think I am? O.J.? Hah!
text: He takes the keys from Ella, puts the camper in gear and
text: drives. Ella looks at him affectionately, her anger gone. She
text: sinks languidly into her seat as the drugs kick in.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Our old trips were never this
dialog: adventurous, eh?
dialog: Scene 29 Page 52.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (a bit nonsensically)
dialog: Traveling’s important. Broadening
dialog: your horizons broadens your mind.
text: Ella looks at him for a long moment.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Do you love me, John?
text: John shoots her a look.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Of course I love you. I love you, I
dialog: love you, I love you.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Me too, John. Very much.
scene_heading: 30 EXT. CAMPSITE, JEKYLL ISLAND - NIGHT 30
text: FULL SCREEN: another slide show’s in progress. The subject is
text: Will and Jane as teenagers, along with their friends. They
text: celebrate Will’s thirteenth birthday as he blows out the
text: candles on the cake.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: And where are we here?
text: Ella's asking John; they sit together as if at the cinema.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (squints)
dialog: At home? She’s Jane.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: And who's the one on the right?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: The littlest one. Our boy.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: He has a name, John. It’s Will.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yeah. William.
text: Lillian is pictured during a summer backyard barbecue. She's
text: still attractive, posing next to Ella, both of them in
text: shorts, their shirts tied up to expose their navels.
dialog: Scene 30 Page
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: And the woman with me is...?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (studies the picture)
dialog: She lives next door?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Right. Our neighbor.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Lillian?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Well done.
text: Meanwhile behind them someone makes:
dialog: 53.
scene_heading: AN APPRECIATIVE WHISTLE
text: Ella notices a group of grungy young men approaching. They
text: are dressed in ripped jeans, old T-shirts, unlaced sneakers.
scene_heading: GRUNGY YOUNG MAN
dialog: Ma’am, would it bother you if we
dialog: watched as well?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Please, make yourselves
dialog: comfortable!
text: They squat nearby and pop open some beers, offering bottles
dialog: to our couple.
scene_heading: GRUNGY YOUNG MAN
dialog: We're celebrating the end of our
dialog: world tour.
text: The other guys laugh.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: What are you, some kind of rock
dialog: band?
scene_heading: GRUNGY YOUNG MAN
dialog: Post-grunge-indie-folk-punk,
dialog: actually.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Excuse me?
scene_heading: GRUNGY YOUNG MAN
dialog: It’s the kind of music we play.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: That sounds... fascinating.
dialog: Scene 30 Page 53A.
text: And now John and Ella are drinking beer while slides play
text: depicting their yard over the years. In one, Will turns a
text: hose on Jane, who is nineteen and dressed in a bikini.
dialog: Scene 30 Page 54.
scene_heading: MORE APPRECIATIVE WHISTLES
text: The next one shows a pregnant Jane several years later.
text: DISAPPOINTED HOWLS FROM THE
speaker_heading: BAND
text: Ella laughs and sips beer as she presses the button. John,
text: however, does not appreciate the whistles.
text: Other images flow by, charting the passage of time in their
dialog: yard.
text: And then there is a more recent series, depicting John’s 74th
text: birthday. Jane’s there with her two kids and her husband.
text: Will’s already balding and has a bit of a paunch. There’s
text: also a large group of students of various ages.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: You must remember this. It wasn’t
dialog: that long ago.
text: John examines the faces, but doesn’t seem to recognize any of
text: them, leaving Ella to explain them to the band members.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: These are family, friends and
dialog: John’s ex-students. There always
text: seemed to be some around the house.
dialog: They still come to see him years
dialog: after graduating. John was a very
dialog: popular teacher.
text: And then come several close-ups of John. His unsmiling
text: expression is distracted, far away. We’ve seen this look.
text: The young musicians begin to get up and go.
scene_heading: GRUNGY YOUNG MAN
dialog: Good night, thanks for the show.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Yes, good night, thanks for
dialog: visiting.
text: Ella stares at John, whose eyes remain fixed on the screen.

scene_heading: INT. CAMPER/EXT. CAMPSITE, JEKYLL ISLAND - NIGHT A31
text: John, smiling in his sleep, cheerfully murmurs something like
dialog: “Ella, where are you going .. don’t be that way, come here ..
text: hey, wait ..”. He wakes from his happy dream, deeply
text: disoriented. We see the inside of the camper through his
text: milky, fuzzy gaze. Details come into focus: objects on the
text: bedside table, his shoes, and then someone lying next to him:
text: a back, an arm, a neck. Finally, the plucked head of Ella.
text: John shakes her gently. She opens her eyes.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Excuse me, where’s Ella?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (patiently)
dialog: I’m right here, John.
text: John smiles incredulously and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No - Ella. Ella Carson. My girl.
text: 22, long blonde hair. She’s
dialog: gorgeous.
text: Ella, half asleep, slowly understands what’s happening.
text: Unnerved, she rises with some effort. She pulls her wig on
text: loosely, drapes a sweater over her shoulders, and stepping
text: into her shoes as if they were slippers she leaves the camper
text: without a word.
text: Left alone, dazed, John tries to focus on his location as the
text: dream fades. He gets up and leaves the motor-home.
text: Outside, he spots Ella sitting alone on a park bench in the
text: moonlight, her back to him.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that really you, Ella?
text: She answers with controlled fury.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Of course it’s me. Who are you?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I’m me. John.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Oh no, you’re not.
dialog: 31
dialog: 32
text: Scene A31 Page 56.
text: John steps in front of her, with a hesitant smile, as if to
text: say: look at me, it is me. Ella does not return his smile.
text: She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: My John is a young teacher. He’s
dialog: charming and educated and very
dialog: handsome. And I want him back.
dialog: You stole him from me and I want
dialog: him back. Give him back to me!
text: John considers her words. He sits next to her.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Boy, I would if I could. But
dialog: whoever stole him from you stole
dialog: him from me, too.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPER, JEKYLL ISLAND - SUNRISE 31
text: The first light of morning filters through the windows. Ella
text: opens her eyes and realizes she’s alone.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: John?
text: She struggles out of bed. She opens the curtains, then opens
text: the camper door and peers outside. John isn’t there.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: (louder) John?
text: Something tells her to open the door of the cabinet where she
text: hides the shotgun. It’s there. Ella looks relieved.
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION DESK, CAMPSITE, JEKYLL ISLAND - DAY 32
text: Ella addresses a young man behind the reception desk.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Excuse me, but you haven’t by any
dialog: chance seen my husband passing by?
text: He’s tall, distinguished-looking,
text: with a white beard and glasses.
text: The guy watches her, thinking.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: A guy like that passed by here
text: ‘pout a half hour ago.
dialog: 33
dialog: Scene 32 Page 57.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: And where was he going?
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: No idea ma‘am.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I’m afraid I’1l need your help,
dialog: then. My husband suffers moments of
dialog: memory loss, and I’m afraid he may
dialog: wander off and get hurt.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Maybe you should call the cops?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: But don’t you have a car so we can
dialog: have a quick look around? He can’t
dialog: have gone far.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: I can’t leave my post. Why not use
dialog: your camper?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: It’s too big, I can’t handle it.
dialog: Please, I wouldn’t ask you if it
dialog: wasn’t important.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Lemme call my brother Terry.
text: He dials a number on his phone.
scene_heading: INT. PICK-UP, MOVING THROUGH STREETS OF JEKYLL ISLAND - DAY3
text: Ella sits in the cab of a pick-up driven by a tattooed young
text: man - TERRY. His bleached hair is gathered in a ponytail; he
text: wears many rings, bracelets and necklaces. They are scouring
text: the streets of the seaside town.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (to herself) It’s my fault. My
dialog: fault.
text: The boy points to an old homeless man who sleeps leaning
text: against the trunk of a palm tree.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Hey, is that him?
dialog: Scene 33
dialog: Page 58.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Who, that poor geezer? Oh no,
dialog: darling, I’ve told you, my John is
dialog: a very distinguished gentleman.
text: Glasses, well-groomed beard...
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I get it. Academic from Yankee-
dialog: land. I like that type.
text: Ella watches Terry with a knowing smile.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I think my son is a lot like you.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Like me?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: You're gay, right? Don’t worry, I
dialog: know it’s not a disease. We should
dialog: all be more gay. Happier. It’sa
dialog: gift from God.
text: Terry laughs and nods.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You think maybe this God could gift
dialog: me blue eyes and make me six inches
dialog: taller?
text: Ella speaks as she continues to scrutinize passersby:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Will’s never wanted to accept
dialog: himself. Or maybe he’s never
dialog: understood himself. It’s such a
dialog: shame. Maybe he’d have been
dialog: happier, more cheerful if he had.
dialog: You want nothing more than to know
dialog: your children are happy, especially
dialog: after you’re gone...
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Will’s lucky to have a Mom like
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Unfortunately, he won’t have a
dialog: mother like me for much longer.
dialog: Scene 33 Page 59.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Don’t say that - you look pretty
dialog: fit to me. That wig is awesome.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: What makes you think I’m wearing a
dialog: wig?
text: Terry gives her a double-take and Ella laughs.
text: She continues to search, but she is also lost in a memory.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: A few months ago I came home and
text: found a shotgun on the kitchen
dialog: table. It gave me such a fright!
text: John was calmly watching football
dialog: on TV. When I asked him what the
dialog: gun was doing there, he couldn’t
dialog: answer. Later I found a note, but
dialog: all that was written on it was
dialog: “Ella my love” followed by some
text: scribbles. And then I understood.
text: Silence. The boy is intrigued.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (mutters )
dialog: For such an intelligent man to feel
text: his brain fading away...
text: But suddenly she lights up, her eyes wide, shouting, beside
text: herself with joy.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: There he is! Stop!
text: She points to a seafront ice cream shop, where John sits at a
dialog: table.
text: The pick-up enters the parking lot, stopping practically a
text: meter away from John. Terry helps Ella descend.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: John!
text: He turns to look at her, but does not seem to recognize her.
text: He returns his attention to his cup of chocolate ice cream.
text: Ella reaches him and embraces him. She starts to cry.
dialog: Scene 33 Page 60.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus, John!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Why are you crying?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Because you weren’t there. I
dialog: wouldn’t know how to live without
dialog: you, not for a minute. We have to
dialog: stick together. Understand? We
dialog: don’t have much time left.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (serenely)
dialog: Then it’s a good thing you came
dialog: cause you wouldn’t want to miss
dialog: this. One helluva chocolate ice
dialog: cream.
text: Ella turns to Terry, who looks amused and a bit moved by the
dialog: scene.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Have a seat, ma’am. I’1ll go get you
dialog: your ice cream.
text: Ella, crying, changes the order.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I'd prefer a whisky.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPSITE, JEKYLL ISLAND - ENTRANCE - DAY 34.
text: The Leisure Seeker, with John and Ella aboard, exits through
text: the campsite’s gates and drives off. Ella salutes through the
dialog: window.
text: Terry waves cheerfully. His brother gives a more sober nod.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPER, MOVING/ EXT. ISOLATED ROAD, GEORGIA - DAY 35
text: The Leisure Seeker moves through the coastal regions of
text: Georgia. The road is lined by forests of Spanish moss-covered
text: trees. These are interrupted by swamps of tall grass. There
text: are signs warning swimmers and fishermen of Poisonous Snakes
text: and Alligators.
text: THE STEREO PLAYS A SWEET SLOW
speaker_heading: SONG
dialog: Scene 35 Page 61.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (she is saying)... it was cold, but
dialog: it was beautiful. Remember?
text: Everything was covered by a layer
text: of ice, shiny and transparent, like
dialog: the world had been covered with
dialog: glass. I had to take tiny steps to
dialog: keep from slipping. I was so cold,
dialog: but you wanted to go on. You were
dialog: telling me the story of White Fang,
dialog: keeping your voice low, so you
dialog: wouldn’t spoil the perfect silence.
dialog: We got home at three in the
text: morning, our hair full of frost.
dialog: That was the night we made Jane...
text: The camper starts to sway. John struggles to keep the
text: steering wheel steady.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing? Can’t you keep
dialog: it straight?
text: In the cabin, objects begin to fall, plates and jars shake
text: and slam. John slows down and pulls over.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It’s all right. Just a flat.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The road is completely deserted. There is no sign of life.
text: John, sweaty and with dirty hands, crouches in front of a
text: flat tire. He tries in vain to turn the jack handle.
text: Ella approaches, wrapping up a phone conversation.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: «--good, we’ll be waiting for you.
dialog: Yes, mile marker 21. Thanks!
text: She hangs up the phone and turns to John.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s okay, hon. Triple A will be
dialog: here in half an hour. And I think
dialog: the spare is flat, anyway. We’1l
dialog: need a tow.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I don’t need them.
dialog: Scene 35
dialog: Page 62.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I know you don’t, but we’re on
dialog: vacation, right? Come on inside,
dialog: don’t stay out here roasting in the
dialog: sun.
text: While moving toward the cockpit they are passed by an old
text: Plymouth, which slows and stops a little further down the
text: road, then turns back.
text: Two kids get out, approaching with shambling steps. They are
text: young, not even twenty. Scrawny and white.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my god, John. These guys are
dialog: scaring me.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Can’t you see they’re just a couple
dialog: of kids?
speaker_heading: FIRST KID
dialog: You folks need a hand?
text: John looks at Ella: you see? But Ella quickly says:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: No thanks, fellas. Triple A will be
dialog: here soon.
speaker_heading: SECOND KID
dialog: How long ‘til they get here?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (obliviously)
dialog: Half an hour if we’re lucky.
speaker_heading: SECOND KID
dialog: Good.
text: He pulls out a knife.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: John, you fool.
speaker_heading: FIRST KID
dialog: Just be cool. We’re going to take
dialog: your shit and then we'll go.
speaker_heading: SECOND KID
dialog: Gimme that phone!
dialog: Scene 35 Page 63.
text: He points to the cell in Ella’s hand. She hands it to him.
speaker_heading: SECOND KID (CONT’D)
dialog: Your ring, too.
text: Now the other guy’s pulled out a knife. He approaches John.
speaker_heading: FIRST KID
dialog: Where’s your wallet at, old man?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Never end a sentence with a
dialog: preposition. When you say ‘where’
text: the ‘at’ is implied...
text: Wham! He’s silenced with a slap.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (terrified)
dialog: John, just do what they say.
text: She slips off her ring and gives it to the Second Kid. And
text: then she raises her hands, motioning to John to do the same.
speaker_heading: SECOND KID
dialog: And you, old woman, shut up and
dialog: give me your purse.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: It’s in the camper. Shall I get it?
text: He gives her permission with a wave. She obeys.
speaker_heading: SECOND KID
dialog: Just move slowly, all right?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: As if I have a choice.
text: She disappears into the camper.
text: Meanwhile John has raised his hands. The First Kid is trying
text: to pull the wallet from John’s pocket.
speaker_heading: FIRST KID
dialog: Fuck, it’s huge. You win the
dialog: lottery, old man?
text: He slices John’s pocket open with the knife. He pulls out the
text: enormous wallet, gives it a quick disappointed look, then
text: turns to his companion. His expression changes immediately.
dialog: Scene 35 Page 64.
speaker_heading: FIRST KID (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah, shit.
text: Ella has come out of the camper holding the shotgun, which
text: she points at the Second Kid.
text: The First Kid grabs John and holds the knife to his throat.
speaker_heading: FIRST KID (CONT'D)
dialog: Put down the fucking gun or I hurt
dialog: him bad.
text: But Ella continues to wield the shotgun confidently, pointing
text: it first at one, and then at the other.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: If you hurt him I’11 shoot you
dialog: both. And if you think we’re afraid
dialog: you're dead wrong. I - no, we -
dialog: have nothing to lose. So drop the
dialog: knives, you hooligans.
text: At that moment there’s a sound...
text: THE CHIRPY RING OF ELLA’S
speaker_heading: CELLPHONE
text: ...in the hand of the First Kid, who looks at the display.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s Will, right?
speaker_heading: FIRST KID
dialog: (nods )
dialog: I ain’t answering it.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Well I don’t want to talk to him.
dialog: He’s always calling at the wrong
dialog: time. Toss it on the ground.
text: The two kids exchange an uncertain look and we realize that
text: they’re not professionals. The telephone stops ringing.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Sweetheart, make sure the safety’s
dialog: off before you start shooting,
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Already done it, hon, thanks.
text: The First Kid drops the knife.
dialog: Scene 35 Page 65.
speaker_heading: FIRST KID
dialog: Let’s go, Cody. Just give them back
dialog: their shit.
text: He throws the wallet on the ground.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Please do as he says, Cody. Put the
dialog: ring on the wallet and get along. I
dialog: won’t even call the cops if you
dialog: leave now. Hurry along.
text: After a moment’s hesitation, he obeys, leaving the ring and
text: the cellphone. After one last disbelieving look the two of
text: them move briskly away.
speaker_heading: SECOND KID
dialog: Your ring sucked anyway.
speaker_heading: FIRST KID
dialog: And your wallet’s full of bullshit.
text: As they get into their car, John shouts after them:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You fellas should consider evening
dialog: classes. Get your diplomas! Turn
dialog: things around. S’not too late!
text: The Plymouth peels away. There’s a moment of silence. Ella
text: still has the shotgun pointed.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Good thing we had the gun. I was
dialog: afraid we'd left it at home.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I thought we might need it. Now - I
dialog: need a Canadian. Could you get it
dialog: from the fridge please?
text: John obeys. Ella takes the opportunity to remove the shells
text: from the gun and throw them as far as she can into the
text: surrounding fields.
scene_heading: INTERCUT - INT. CAMPER/ EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - DAY 36
text: A tow truck pulls the Leisure Seeker through a vast flat
text: rural landscape.
dialog: Scene 36 Page 66.
text: On board the camper, John and Ella sit cheerfully. They
text: celebrate the success of their misadventure by passing a
text: bottle of Canadian Club. Ella’s on the phone:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Yes, darling, I know that your
dialog: brother called. I didn’t answer
dialog: because I was... held up.
text: John smiles - he appreciates the pun.
text: Jane speaks on her cell phone while striding across the
text: campus of the college where she teaches. She juggles the
text: phone and her paper-stuffed shoulder bag.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: We're really worried, mother.
dialog: Will’s getting desperate. I’m going
dialog: to see him now.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Your brother is a Nervous Nelly.
dialog: It’s nice of you to stay near him.
dialog: Tell him that your father and I are
dialog: having a grand old time.
text: Jane's a bit amused by her mother’s response.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: So where are you, Mom?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Darling, I wish you could see the
dialog: sky here.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Okay, I get it, you aren’t going to
dialog: tell me. How’s Dad?
text: Ella shoots a look at her husband, who’s taking a big sip of
dialog: Canadian Club.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Full of beans. Oh, he still has his
text: moments. But he’s doing well and
text: he’s driving, which is a miracle.
dialog: Would you like to speak with him?
text: Ella passes the phone to her husband.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s Jane - she wants to speak with
dialog: you.
dialog: Scene 36 Page 67.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Your daughter! Take it.
text: John takes the phone and cheerfully shouts:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hey, Pumpkin! How are you?
text: Jane is so moved that she is forced into a moment’s silence.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don’t think you’ve called me that
dialog: since I was eight, Daddy.
text: She stops in her tracks. Floored by her father’s words.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: You're being careful, right?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You've been so much in my head
dialog: these days, little one. Do you have
dialog: any idea how proud I am of you. I
dialog: bet you’re making a big splash at
dialog: your college. It’s not for nothing
dialog: you’re named Spencer.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yes, Daddy.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I love you, Pumpkin. We’1l see you
dialog: soon...
text: He passes the phone hastily to his wife.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Jane?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Mom.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I love you, too.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Me too, Mom. You make sure you come
dialog: home, okay?
dialog: 37
dialog: Scene 36 Page 68.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Kiss the kids for me. And tell your
dialog: brother we’ve spoken.
text: A choked-up Jane can hardly speak.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I’1l be sure to do that, Mom.
text: Ella hangs up. She, too, has misty eyes. She says to John:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Hey, don’t finish all the Canadian.
text: She snatches it from his hand.
scene_heading: INT. WILL’S GARAGE - DAY 37
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Leave them alone. They’re having
dialog: fun.
text: She says this to Will, who shakes his head. They’re sitting
text: on a zebra-striped sofa in his garage ‘office.’
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to
dialog: introduce Jane the All-Knowing.
dialog: Watch her explain everything to
dialog: poor Will. Who doesn’t know Jack
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (smiles, sighs)
dialog: What the hell are you talking
dialog: about? I’m just telling you that
dialog: there’s nothing we can do to stop
dialog: them. It’s her right to refuse
dialog: treatment. We both know how little
dialog: good it is now, anyway.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I know that it’s better than
dialog: wandering around god-knows-where in
dialog: a creaky camper. But you know best,
dialog: I guess, because you talked to Dad,
dialog: and you two are thick-as-thieves,
dialog: even when he doesn’t even remember
dialog: who we are.
dialog: Scene 37
dialog: Page 69.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don’t understand why you’re
dialog: making this so personal, Will...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Because you live two hours away and
dialog: phone once a week and come on
dialog: weekends for lunches that are
dialog: cooked by me. What do you know
dialog: about spending long afternoons with
dialog: Dad when he doesn’t say a single
dialog: thing that makes sense? Do you
dialog: know what Mom says when she gets
dialog: sick and I have to run there in the
dialog: middle of the night? You know what
dialog: she says when I get there? Don’t
dialog: call Jane. She’s busy.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You've been telling this story
dialog: about how I’m Daddy’s Girl for
dialog: years. It’s bullshit, Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Maybe it is. But it’s the only
dialog: story I’ve got.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: They're just doing what they’ve
dialog: done their whole life. Staying
text: together, the two of them.
text: Jane wants to hug him, but Will backs away in a sulk.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: There’s so much love between them
dialog: that they forgot about us. Both of
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh Will..
text: Jane sighs at the sight of her brother’s fragility.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: So you know what happened, when was
dialog: it, last year? I opened their
text: bedroom door and she was on the bed
text: and he was kneeling in front of her
dialog: and... I can’t even say it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Dad was muff diving? Yodelling in
dialog: the canyon?
dialog: Scene 37 Page 70.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (shivers)
dialog: I wanted to vomit.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Why? I hope it happens to me when
dialog: I'm their age.
text: Will buries his head in his hands.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: God, what a thought.
text: Jane is struck by a melancholy thought about her life.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Though I kinda doubt it. For years
dialog: now, with Philip and me, it’s one

text: The flat tire has been repaired and the Leisure Seeker is

text: participants in a Republican election rally.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Houston, we have a problem.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Just pull over. We can wait.
text: Hemingway isn’t going anywhere.
text: There are red hats that read ‘MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN;’ t-
text: shirts and banners with the grinning face of the Republican
dialog: candidate.
text: PEOPLE ARE YELLING SLOGANS
text: John is forced to pull over.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Wanta go see.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: What’s to see? You know who these
dialog: people are.
dialog: Scene 38 Page 71.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I want to have a look -
text: John is out of the vehicle in an instant, and Ella’s too
text: tired to chase after him. All she can do is yell:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Don’t go far!
text: John turns and gives her an OK sign, smiling. And then he
text: asks someone what’s going on.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A little later, John wears a ‘Make America Great Again’ hat,
text: drinks beer and toasts rabid supporters as they shout slogans
dialog: like:
speaker_heading: REPUBLICAN SUPPORTERS
dialog: - The only good terrorist is a dead
dialog: terrorist.
dialog: - This land is our land!
dialog: - No more Muslims! Ban them all!
dialog: - Build a wall too tall for
dialog: Mexicans!
text: Each of these slogans is greeted by a joyous ‘Yes!,’ which
text: John echoes with real conviction, as if it were a funny game
text: he didn’t understand. This carries on until a hand grabs his
dialog: arm to pull him away:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: John, please, come with me.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: But this is so much fun!
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Yes, I know, but it’s better that
dialog: you come with me now. We’re gonna
dialog: get a parking ticket.
text: As she begins to drag him away, John shouts:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: See you later, everybody! Make
dialog: America great again!
text: Those gathered nearby raise their beer bottles to toast John.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: Scene 38 Page 72.
text: John and Ella are once again in the camper. They are leaving;
text: the road is once again passable.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: John, they were Republicans.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (nodding agreement)
dialog: Uh-huh...
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: You’ve voted Democrat your whole
dialog: life. You volunteered for Walter
dialog: Mondale. Don’t you remember how mad
dialog: you got when I talked about voting
dialog: for Reagan?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Ray-gun... ha, that’s funny -
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Don’t you remember him?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (thinks, then nods)
dialog: Sure, I remember.
speaker_heading: ELLA

text: There is a pause and then John looking at her suggests -
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: L?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Right. Ell. Go on.
text: It’s on the tip of John’s tongue.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Lillian!
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Sweet Jesus, now you think I’m
dialog: Lillian? Lillian is our next door
dialog: neighbor. I’m your wife. L? LA?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Ella. My darling Ella. Excuse me.
dialog: Oh, wow, my poor head.
text: Ella continues to stare at him, trying to understand what's
text: going on inside his head.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPSITE, NEAR DAYTONA - NIGHT 39
text: The projector's carousel turns. All the slides are of Jane
text: and Will: swimming in the ocean, stuffing cake into their
text: mouths at a birthday party, Trick-or-Treating, rolling in
text: piles of raked leaves, posing rigidly by the fireplace,
text: sitting on Santa’s lap at a shopping center, close-up
dialog: portraits...
text: Ella and John are once again seated outside the Leisure
text: Seeker like they’re at a cinema. There are no other campers
text: around, only the deep coniferous woods that surround the
text: camp. John eats a sandwich, while Ella swallows a blue
text: painkiller. There’s no commentary from her this time, no
text: narration. She’s not in a good way. And then John opens his
dialog: mouth:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Look how cute Jane was!
text: Ella smiles and nods yes, happy that John is enthusiastic.
text: Next comes a photo of Will sitting on the shoulders of a
text: tall, handsome man with an intelligent expression.
dialog: Scene 39 Page 74.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, look - that’s Jim!
text: But then his expression darkens. He asks Ella:
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: How’s Jim these days?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Jim passed, hon. Last July. We went
dialog: to see him at that human warehouse
dialog: where he spent his last two years,
dialog: remember? (she sighs)
dialog: Unfortunately, he didn’t recognize
dialog: us.
text: John thinks, trying to remember. He murmurs:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That’s terrible. Poor Jim.
text: Ella watches him, trying to read his thoughts. And then John
text: looks at her.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Promise me something.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: If you love me, when the time
dialog: comes, put the shotgun in my hands,
dialog: put my finger on the trigger,
dialog: remind me what I want to do, kiss
dialog: me and walk away. It’s like mud
dialog: season in Massachusetts. Messy but
dialog: necessary.
text: Ella reaches out and firmly grips her husband's hand.
text: She presses the button to continue the show, but the carousel
text: is at its end. White light almost blinds them. John
text: instinctively pulls out the power cord to kill the painful
text: light, leaving them in near-darkness.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: John, what have you done? Put it
dialog: back in.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I can’t find the outlet.
dialog: Scene 39 Page 75.
text: And then they hear what sounds like an animal in the bushes.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Unlikely it’s an alligator. He'd
dialog: be on us by now.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Oh my god - an alligator?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Let’s get the gun.
text: Ella rises.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Let’s go inside.
text: Muttering to herself.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: We don’t have any shells...
text: She heads toward the camper, but she trips and takes a dive.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Ella?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Help me, John. I think I’ve pulled
dialog: something in my back. I’m down here
dialog: on the ground. Help me get up.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Oh shit!
text: John approaches Ella and extends his hand.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Give me your hand.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: John, I can’t do it like that.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Give me your hand.
text: Ella grabs John’s hand. He tries to pull her up, but he loses
text: his balance and falls on top of her. They remain like this,
text: on the ground, a situation comic and dire at the same time.
dialog: Scene 39 Page 76.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Get up! You’re crushing me.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I hurt my arm.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: So what? Get off!
text: John gathers all his strength and manages to roll off her.
text: Now they are side-by-side on the ground, with no strength
text: left. They look at one another.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you all right?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What’re we doing on the ground?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I fell! Don’t you even remember?
dialog: You tried to help me and you fell,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Oh, shit.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: We need to try to reach the camper.
dialog: Can you move?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Nope. Can’t do it.
text: Ella does not lose heart. She begins to crawl toward the
text: vehicle. The stones hurt; she’s soon covered in mud and dirt.
text: But gradually she approaches the steps. She grabs on and
text: tries to pull herself up, but fails.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I can’t do it. Get up and get over
dialog: here and help me.
text: John does not respond.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: John?
text: Nothing. And so she makes another effort. She plants an elbow
text: on the ground and clings to the steps with her free hand so
text: she can turn around and rest her back against the steps. Now
text: at least she’s sitting up. She looks at John. She can’t
text: believe it - he’s asleep, right there on the ground.
dialog: Scene 39 Page 77.
text: Snoring, as if tucked snugly in his bed. She begins to pick
text: up pebbles and toss them at him until the snoring stops. John
text: stirs and then, after a direct hit, angrily says:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Are you crazy? What are you trying
dialog: to do, stone me to death?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I hurt my back. You need to get
dialog: over here and help me up. I can’t
dialog: do it on my own.
text: He pulls himself up - it seems as if that quick nap has
text: helped him recover. But instead of going over to help Ella,
text: he approaches the projector.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hey, the projector’s unplugged...
text: Ella screams at him at the top of her lungs.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: JOHN! Move your ass and help me!
text: Finally, John gets up and goes to her. She holds out her arms
text: when he leans over, but he doesn’t even see her. Instead, he
text: lowers himself even further, toward her shoes.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: What on earth are you doing?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Your shoes are untied.
text: He begins to tie her shoes with care.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Thank you, John.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: With everything you do for me?
dialog: This is nothing -
text: He gets up and kisses her on the mouth. And then he begins to
text: gently wipe the dirt off her face.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: You're all dirty.
text: He gives her a gentle pat.
dialog: Scene 39 Page 78.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: What would I be without you? You
dialog: want to know? Nothing.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Don’t exaggerate. Sure, lately
dialog: you’ve needed my help, but...
text: John smiles sweetly, shaking his head no.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It’s been this way our whole lives.
dialog: Without you I couldn’t have done
dialog: anything, my darling, darling
dialog: little one. My goodness, look how
dialog: sexy you are -
text: Ella has to swallow back the lump rising in her throat. John
text: has always been affectionate, but only in his brusque, dry
dialog: manner. He’s never used an endearment like that with her. In
text: order not to be overwhelmed by emotion, she waves her arms,
text: as if it’s a big joke.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: How about a little pick-me-up?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That sounds like an excellent idea.
text: This time he grabs her beneath her arms and, just like that,
text: they’re both on their feet again. He helps her slowly climb
dialog: the ladder.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPER, DAYTONA - SUNRISE 40
text: Ella is sleeping, but a noise inside the van disturbs her and
text: she opens her eyes. John isn’t beside her. She looks at the
text: time on the electronic alarm clock, then lifts the curtain.
text: Outside, the chairs and table are missing.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: John? What’s the big rush to go?
text: She pulls herself up with great difficulty.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: I could've used a little more
dialog: sleep. John? Oh my God.
text: Her eyes widen. She’s confronted with an unlikely sight: John
text: is pointing the shotgun at her. He’s already dressed and has
text: a deeply serious expression.
dialog: Scene 40
dialog: Page 79.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It’s the moment of truth, Ella...
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: For heaven’s sake, what is this?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Take me to him. Now.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: To who?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: To whom. To Dan. Dan Coleman. I
dialog: need to look him straight in the
dialog: eye.
text: Ella's not worried about the gun - she knows it’s empty.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: John, for God's sake.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I’m not going to wait for some
dialog: snowy night for you to finally
dialog: confess everything as you look out
text: the window at the snow falling
dialog: faintly through the universe -
text: Ella pulls herself up impatiently.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I’m getting so sick of this
dialog: nonsense.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He was always there for you. Dan! I
dialog: was only ever second-best.
text: John’s words come as a revelation that makes Ella shudder:
text: she feels compassion for him, but also anger.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: How dare you point a gun at me!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Take me to him.
dialog: Scene 40 Page 80.
text: Ella leaps to her feet.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I’ve had enough! I’m sorry you've
dialog: been thinking this all these years
dialog: but ... you want to see Dan
dialog: Coleman? Fine!
text: She grabs her cell phone from her bag.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I’m going to find out where the
dialog: hell Dan is - even if he’s in his
dialog: grave - and take you to him.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You will? Finally!
text: She dials a number and then looks at him as she puts the
text: phone to her ear.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Well, don’t just stand there.
dialog: Start the damned engine.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Oh, I will!
scene_heading: 4l EXT. RESIDENTIAL CARE CENTER, DAYTONA - DAY 41
text: The camper arrives at the entrance of a residential care
dialog: center for the elderly.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (speaking with John)
dialog: You can’t go in there with a gun!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I’m going in as I see fit.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Fine. Take it. A hundred cops will
dialog: show up and probably kill us both.
scene_heading: 42 INT. RECEPTION AND CORRIDOR, RESIDENTIAL CARE CENTER, DAYTGNA
speaker_heading: - DAY.
text: An African-American Receptionist raises her eyes from a
text: computer screen.
dialog: Scene 42 Page 80A.
speaker_heading: CENTER RECEPTIONIST
dialog: May I help you?
dialog: Scene 42 Page 81.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: We'd like to see Daniel Coleman,
dialog: please. I believe he’s a resident
dialog: here?
text: Ella forces a reassuring smile. John frowns, and there’s a
text: strange bulge in the left side of his jacket.
speaker_heading: CENTER RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Daniel Coleman?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: CENTER RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Are you on the list?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: We're old friends. We were just
text: passing by.
speaker_heading: CENTER RECEPTIONIST
dialog: One moment, please.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: You're very kind.
text: The receptionist rises from her post and enters an office.
text: Ella's forced smile becomes a worried grimace when she
text: realizes that John has begun to walk down the corridor on his
text: own, his pace lopsided due to what’s hidden in his jacket.
text: She walks behind him.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, she said to wait.
text: John doesn’t answer. He opens the first of a long series of
text: doors along the corridor and looks inside: there’s an
text: emaciated old man seated at a table, peeling an apple.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Is that you, Coleman?
text: The old man gives him a strange look. Ella reaches John.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I’m sorry, we seem to have the
dialog: wrong room.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Who you looking for?
dialog: 43
dialog: Scene 42 Page 82.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: We don’t want to disturb you...
dialog: But John will not be denied.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Daniel Coleman. You know him? Which
dialog: room is his?
scene_heading: INT. DAN’S ROOM, RESIDENTIAL CARE CENTER, DAYTONA - DAY. 43
text: Another room, where Old Man 2, glasses perched on his ruddy
text: nose, lies in bed listening to:
text: A HAPPY SONG ON THE RADIO
speaker_heading: (MAGIC MOMENTS)
text: .-. and another man, seen from behind, seated in a
text: wheelchair, seems mesmerized by something outside the window.
text: The door opens and John peers inside, followed by Ella.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Finally, we find you!
text: Both old men turn. We can now see the face of the one seated
text: in the wheelchair: he’s a skinny black guy in his eighties
text: with oxygen tubes stuck in his nostrils. John points the
text: shotgun toward the man on the bed, who raises his hands.
text: Ella tries to hold John back, but it’s too late:
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ve always wanted to see your
dialog: face, Dan Coleman.
text: Old Man 2 responds, his hands in the air.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN 2
dialog: But I’m not Dan.
text: The black man has his hands raised as well. John, getting
text: disoriented, looks at him.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Who the hell are you people?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: It’s Ella. Ella Carson. Do you
dialog: remember me?
dialog: Scene 43 Page 83.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Ella? Who the hell is Ella? What do
dialog: you want from me? (shouts) Nurse!
dialog: Help!
text: Ella shushes him. John’s not understanding any of this.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Where’s Daniel Coleman?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: That’s me. But who the hell are
dialog: you?
text: Meanwhile, Old Man 2 looks terrified, his hands still raised.
text: John looks at Ella in confusion:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That’s him?
text: But Ella is now gripped by another thought. She continues to
dialog: speak to Dan.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Do you really not remember me? This
dialog: is my husband John Spencer.
text: John continues to point his gun at Dan as he incongruously
dialog: says:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Nice to meet you.
text: Dan stares at him, convinced he’s dealing with two lunatics.
dialog: As if to confirm this:
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you wear boxers?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Do you wear boxers or briefs?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: This is what you want to know?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: What the hell is he saying?
dialog: Scene 43 Page 84.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (to Ella)
dialog: I want to understand where this
text: fixation with boxers comes from.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: All right, then - ask away.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Do you wear boxers or briefs?
text: Dan lowers his hands. This is crazy. Meanwhile, on the radio:
text: PERRY COMO CONTINUES TO SING
speaker_heading: ‘MAGIC MOMENTS’
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I wear diapers. (to Ella) Ella who?
dialog: I don’t remember any Ella.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: You don’t remember me? Shoot this
dialog: son of a bitch, John.
text: The door opens. The very worried Center Receptionist and a
text: Nurse peer inside.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: John, put that thing away.
text: The Receptionist and the Nurse throw open the door.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: What’s going on here?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He doesn’t remember my wife.
text: Ella grabs the gun from John and tells the two newcomers:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Don’t worry, it’s empty.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It is?
text: But the women grab John and lock the door.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Wait, he’s not dangerous - he’s an
dialog: English teacher!
speaker_heading: 44
dialog: Scene 43 Page 85.
text: The nurse brusquely grabs the gun from Ella’s hand.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (to Ella)
dialog: But who the hell are you? Ella who?
scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL CARE CENTER, DAYTONA - DAY 44
text: Ella and John are led to the camper by the Receptionist, the
text: Nurse, a male MEMBER OF STAFF and a man with the uniform of
text: security guard, who returns the gun to John.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Next time you come to visit your
dialog: friend, do it without this, even if
text: it is empty.
speaker_heading: CENTER RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Just be grateful we didn’t call the
dialog: police.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: You've been very understanding.
speaker_heading: MEMBER OF STAFF
dialog: We were thinking that perhaps the
dialog: two of you might need a little
dialog: rest. No offense intended.
text: He shows Ella a brochure describing the facility’s amenities.
speaker_heading: MEMBER OF STAFF (CONT’D)
dialog: This contains a list of all the
dialog: insurance we accept. We’ll call
dialog: your children so they can come tour
dialog: the facility...
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: That's very nice of you. We’l1l
dialog: think about it.
speaker_heading: MEMBER OF STAFF
dialog: But are you sure you want to be
dialog: travelling around on your own?
dialog: It’s nice here. Ask Dan.

speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Come on, Brian...

dialog: Scene 44 Page 86.

scene_heading: EXT. CAMPER, MOVING, FLORIDA - DAY 45
text: While driving the camper, John strokes Ella’s hand.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Why are you so sad?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I’m just a little tired.
text: She masks a grimace, then throws down another painkiller.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: But yes, I’m also angry. At you,
text: mostly, but also at Dan.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Dan? Dan who?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Oh, for Christ’s sake!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Oh right. The guy who isn’t in
dialog: Savannah any more.
text: After a long silence.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: He was black?
text: Ella looks at him, then starts to laugh. John laughs, too,
dialog: perhaps without even knowing why.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: He was a little more charismatic
dialog: than this at the time.
text: The camper now passes by a Democratic rally. We might even
text: glimpse Hillary speaking; an echo of her speech reaches them.
scene_heading: AMPLIFIED VOICE OF HILLARY
text: But the Spencers aren't interested. Ella has stopped

speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. RADISSON HOTEL, CAPE CANAVERAL - NIGHT 46

speaker_heading: HOTEL RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Good evening, ma’am. How might I
dialog: assist you?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Good evening. Could we have a nice

dialog: economical?
speaker_heading: HOTEL RECEPTIONIST
dialog: I'm afraid there’s not much left.
dialog: (checks his computer) Half the

dialog: Hillary. We do have a standard
dialog: double with twin beds.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Oh, no, we can’t be separated.
speaker_heading: HOTEL RECEPTIONIST
dialog: In that case we have the deluxe
dialog: suite, which has two kings, but
dialog: that’s...
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: We'll take it.
speaker_heading: HOTEL RECEPTIONIST
dialog: «+. that’s normally five hundred

speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Heavens, we don’t want to buy it,

text: The Receptionist hesitates before bursting into laughter. She
text: hands him the credit card.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: We've never spent that much on a
dialog: hotel room in my whole life.
text: The Receptionist pretends not to have heard her as he hands

speaker_heading: HOTEL RECEPTIONIST
dialog: You're in 723. Artie will show you.
dialog: Do you have luggage?
scene_heading: INT. RADISSON HOTEL, SUITE - NIGHT 47
text: The room’s lights come on. ARTIE carries the bag Ella has
text: packed for the night, while the two guests take in their
text: luxury room. It is new and huge, decorated in beige and gold
text: tones. There’s a lounge beyond the bedroom.
speaker_heading: ARTIE
dialog: I hope this will be to your liking.
dialog: There’s a minibar. You also have a
text: DVD player and a stereo. And in
dialog: here’s the master bedroom...
text: Artie puts their bag into the master bedroom.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It’s a beautiful room. Can we
dialog: afford it?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: What are you saying, John? Of
dialog: course we can afford it.
text: She rummages through her purse to get a tip, but Artie waves
dialog: her off.
speaker_heading: ARTIE
dialog: Enjoy your stay.
text: He leaves. Ella immediately turns on the stereo, looking for
dialog: a song she likes, and finds:
text: ‘DON’T LEAVE ME THIS WAY’ BY
speaker_heading: THELMA HOUSTON
dialog: 48
dialog: Scene 47 Page 89.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: And now a little something to help

text: Ella opens the minibar and finds a bottle of champagne. She
dialog: removes it.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you say, John? I think
dialog: we've earned it.
text: She gives the bottle to John, who whistles when he sees it.
text: Ella gets two glasses. John opens the bottle, pours
text: champagne. They toast, while:
text: ‘DON’T LEAVE ME THIS WAY”
speaker_heading: CONTINUES
text: And then they kiss. John makes her do a pirouette; Ella,
text: laughing, tries to escape. But John insists. She does a
text: pirouette, then another.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Come on, darling, boogie with me.
text: And then she collapses in his arms, leans forward and vomits.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ella...
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Oh my God, I’ve ruined the carpet.
text: In shock, she starts to clean it with her blouse, but John
text: lifts her up and gently wipes her mouth with his
dialog: handkerchief. And all the while:
text: “DON’T LEAVE ME THIS WAY”
speaker_heading: CONTINUES
scene_heading: INT. RADISSON HOTEL, SUITE AND CORRIDOR - DAY 48
text: The following morning Ella wakes to the voice of John
text: mumbling from afar. She checks the clock: it’s late.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Hon?
dialog: Scene 48 Page 90.
text: She gets up and finds John in the luxurious bathroom, where,
text: already washed and dressed, he’s combing his hair in front of
text: the mirror as he describes Santiago of The Old Man and the
dialog: Sea.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: ‘The old man was thin and gaunt and
text: had deep wrinkles in his neck. The
text: brown blotches of the benevolent
dialog: skin cancer the sun brings from its
text: reflection on the tropic sea were
text: on his cheeks. The blotches ran
text: well down the sides of his face and
text: his hands had the deep-creased
text: scars from handling heavy fish on
dialog: the cords. But none of these scars
dialog: were fresh. They were as old as
text: erosions in a fishless desert.’
text: Ella stands there, watching. When he realizes she’s there:
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Good morning, honey, you sleep
dialog: well?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Like a rock. When’s the last time I
dialog: slept this late?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Okay, I’m off, I’ll be back at the
dialog: usual time...
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Where are you going?
text: He kisses her, exits the room and heads down the corridor.
text: Ella follows him in confusion. She stops at the door,
text: watching as he waves goodbye. But after a few steps he
text: freezes, lost. He turns to her:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: But this isn’t our house.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Where are we?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: In a good place.

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Santiago is the perfect character.
dialog: He achieved the inner spiritual
dialog: success that defines Hemingway's
dialog: ‘true man’. To be defeated but not

speaker_heading: YOUNG WAITRESS

dialog: There’s a quote of William
dialog: Faulkner's where he says Hemingway
dialog: was “one of the bravest and the

dialog: And add on to that for me: “one of

scene_heading: 50 EXT. CAMPER, MOVING, PALM BEACH - DAY 50
text: The Leisure Seeker travels down a coastal road lined with
text: palm trees. Palm Beach's skyline serves as backdrop.
text: Ella's sick; she cannot stop herself from grimacing. John
text: notices what’s happening. He pulls to the side of the road.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Don’t stop, John. Let’s find a
dialog: campsite.
scene_heading: 51 INT. CAMPER, AT CAMPSITE NEAR PALM BEACH - NIGHT 51
text: Later, after setting them up, John helps Ella into bed in the
text: camper. He takes off her shoes.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I’m sorry, but I really do need to
dialog: lie down. If you’re hungry, there’s
text: some cheese in the fridge.
text: John does not answer - he’s too focused on being attentive.
text: Finally, Ella’s lying comfortably. John asks, tenderly:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You better now, Lillian?
dialog: Scene 51 Page 93.
text: Ella looks at him, struck by the fact that John called her
dialog: that name once again.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: I won’t go home quite yet. Don’t
dialog: fret, I won’t leave you alone until
dialog: you're okay.
text: A inspired thought crosses Ella’s mind. She decides to be
dialog: Lillian:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Where’s Ella now?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Ella? Ella’s at home.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: At home?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Uh-huh. Baby’s taking its toll. I
dialog: should be there. Good God. I’m not
dialog: right. I better go to her.
text: Ella's trying hard to stay calm. She swallows back her pride
dialog: and continues.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Wait. Does Ella know about us?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You know she doesn’t. I mean, I
dialog: couldn’t bear it if Ella knew.
dialog: Neither could you. It’d break her
dialog: heart. Mine, too. I’m so selfish-
dialog: The question has stirred John up.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ella must never know! Never. We
dialog: have to stop this, Lillian.
text: Ella experiences a pang to the heart and can barely hold back
dialog: her tears. But she needs to know everything.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Yes, we must stop. It’s gone on a
dialog: long time.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Too long, I guess, yes...
dialog: Scene 51 Page 94.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: How long is too long?
text: John sighs as he thinks back.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We said it’d be only the once and
dialog: it’s been nearly two years now-
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: But do you love me?
text: John shakes his head and looks at her sadly.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Lillian, we’ve talked about this
dialog: and you agreed. We’re wonderful
dialog: friends. The best, but I love Ella.
dialog: We're expecting another baby.
text: Ella collapses back on the pillow. She’s desperate now.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ella's the love of my life, she’s
dialog: everything to me. We’ve another
dialog: baby on the way, for god’s sakes.
text: Ella knows that she’s hearing a great declaration of love,
text: but she’s too angry to care. John extends his arms. Deeply
dialog: moved, he says:
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry, but goodbye, dear
dialog: Lillian goodbye -
text: He leaves the camper with a bowed head. Ella rises cursing
text: from the bed.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Son of a bitch! Where are you
dialog: going? Get back here! Come here so
dialog: I can kill you!
text: As she screams she grabs objects, dishes, anything at hand,
text: throwing it all on the ground.
text: John, hearing the commotion, rushes back in.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Ella, what's happening?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Oh, so now I’m Ella again? Damn
dialog: you!
dialog: Scene 51 Page 95.
text: She begins to strike him with all her remaining strength.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (protecting himself)
dialog: What are you doing? Why are you so
dialog: mad? What’s happened?
text: Ella dials a number, calling someone at reception.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Good evening, I’m calling from
dialog: space 37. Could you please send a
dialog: taxi here a.s.a.p? Thank you.
text: She hangs up in a fury. John watches her blankly as she
text: begins to pack a bag, filling it with his clothes.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (disoriented)
dialog: Ella, what are you doing?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Quiet, fool. Our trip ends here.
text: As usual, when she turns on her phone, someone calls. Ella
text: grabs it and shouts:
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Will - what the hell do you want?
dialog: Just leave me alone!
text: And then she turns off her phone.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPSITE NEAR PALM BEACH - NIGHT 52
text: A taxi approaches the Leisure Seeker. A confused John stands
text: in front of it.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: You called a cab?
text: Ella answers as she descends the motor home’s steps dragging
text: a bag.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Do you see any other customers
dialog: waiting around?
text: She shows the bag to John.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Here’re all your things. Night,
dialog: shirt, socks, your damned briefs...
text: Scene 52 Page 95A.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What’s happening, Ella?
text: Ella doesn't respond. She turns to the taxi driver.
dialog: Scene 52 Page 96.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Please help me load my husband and
dialog: his stupid bag.
text: The intimidated Cabbie gets out and obeys. He carefully puts
text: the bag in the trunk. Ella, brusque and furious, opens the
text: back door of the taxi.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: (to John)
dialog: Get in, imbecile.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Why are you so mad, Ella?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Mad? Me? I’m not mad at all. On the
dialog: contrary - I’m relieved. Happy as a
dialog: clam!
text: She tells the Cabbie, who is back behind the wheel:
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Take us to an old folks’ home. The
dialog: crummiest you can find.
scene_heading: INT. RESIDENTIAL CARE CENTER, PALM BEACH - NIGHT. 53
text: Ella puts the bag and John’s wallet on the reception counter
text: in front of a puzzled Clerk. John looks around, baffled.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: This isn’t where we live.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: No it isn’t. We’re at a place where
dialog: they keep old fools like you. (to
dialog: the Clerk) Put him a room, please.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Ella, why are you so irritable?
text: The Clerk, very calmly, as if she’s speaking to a baby,
dialog: addresses Ella.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Ma’am, we cannot accept new
dialog: patients without following
dialog: established guidelines.
dialog: Scene 53
dialog: Page 97.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Establish them, then.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: You can come tomorrow morning at
dialog: 9:30 to the intake office. If the
dialog: gentleman falls within the required
dialog: parameters he will be put ona
dialog: waiting list. At present, this runs
dialog: about ten months.
text: Ella removes documents and credit cards from John’s wallet,
text: acting as if the Clerk has not even been speaking.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: That sounds more like your problem
dialog: than mine. Here’s everything you'll
dialog: need. Money, credit cards,
dialog: documents. And this photo...
text: She puts down a photo from an insurance company advertisement
text: that depicts three smiling generations of a family.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
text: He cut it out of a magazine. He
dialog: thinks this is us, that this is his
dialog: family! He carries it around in his
dialog: wallet! Do you understand now who
dialog: you're dealing with? All right, I’m
dialog: tired and you have things to do.
dialog: He’s all yours. Good night.
text: Ella turns her back before the Clerk has time to respond:
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Goodbye, John.
text: And she moves off quickly, heading toward the waiting taxi.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (to John)
dialog: She must realize that you cannot
dialog: stay here.
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: At times she seems like a wounded
dialog: buffalo, I know. Are you familiar
dialog: with ‘The Short Happy Life of
dialog: Francis Macomber?’ (muttered) His
dialog: wife got him in the back of the
dialog: neck with a 6.5 Mannlicher. Women
dialog: with guns ...
dialog: 54
dialog: Scene 53 Page 98.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: What do we do? Call the police?
text: She's addressing the HEAD NURSE, who is looking over the
text: documents left on the counter.
speaker_heading: HEAD NURSE
dialog: I doubt they’d take him.
scene_heading: INTERCUT - INT. CAMPER/ INT. ELLA’S AND JOHN'S HOUSE - NIGH.
text: Ella sits on the double bed in the open dining area. The
text: slide projector's on her knees. She’s obsessively viewing
text: slides projected small and crooked on the camper’s wall,
text: plucking them angrily from containers. She’s looking for
text: Lillian, tossing any that don’t picture her in a messy pile.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: There you are, bitch.
text: She speaks directly to Lillian, pictured smiling sweetly in a
text: 70s miniskirt.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at you, with your thighs on
dialog: display. Coming into my house all
dialog: slutty.
text: She chooses another photo, this one of a barbecue in the
text: garden. Lillian has downcast eyes and a downcast expression.
text: John’s back is to her as he grills hamburgers. Ella comes
text: closer to better see Lillian’s face.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: But look at this face. Are you
dialog: suffering, bitch? What about me,
dialog: the woman who so happily takes your
dialog: photograph?
text: Ella scours the picture, looking at the back of John’s pants.
text: She addresses him:
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: I bought you those pants. And you
dialog: took them off for Lillian, you pig.
text: Angry tears come to her eyes. She takes a sip from the bottle
text: of Canadian Club at her side, then changes the photo. There’s
text: no Lillian - she throws it on the pile. She finds one that
text: depicts Jane at the age of four, watching Lillian from below
text: with a serious look.
dialog: Scene 54 Page 99.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: (indignant)
dialog: Jane! You knew! And you never said
dialog: a word!
text: She fumbles through her bag, removes her phone and pounds out
dialog: a number.
text: In the guest bedroom, Jane wakes up with a start. Her husband
text: PHILIP gives her a worried look:
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Is it them?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yes, it’s Mom! Hello?
text: In the camper, Ella speaks to her daughter with a voice that
text: alternates between outrage and near-tears.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Your father fooled me all our life
dialog: and you knew it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Mom, what’s happening? Where are
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: You never said a word. Always on
dialog: his side! Professor my ass.
text: In_ her bedroom, Jane gives her husband a terrified look.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Mother, you’re raving! I’m at your
dialog: house with Philip and Will - we’re
dialog: all here, waiting for you. Where
dialog: are you? Let us come get you.
text: In the camper, Ella is a whirlwind of recriminations,
text: unstoppable, maybe even drunk.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I’m alone. I got rid of your father
dialog: and I’m coming back home. Or maybe,
dialog: I’m going to the seaside. I don’t
dialog: ever want to see him again.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (distressed)
dialog: Mom - where’s Dad?
dialog: Scene 54
dialog: Page 100.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I'm finally free of that horrible
dialog: creature who ruined my life. I
dialog: don't give a damn about Hemingway
dialog: or Melville or those little
dialog: pedantic lessons that always made
dialog: me feel like an idiot!
text: Jane tries to interject.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Mom...
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: The liar! What do you read in all
dialog: those books? Just lies!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Mom!
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: He lied his whole life! And I bet
text: he’s pretending to be senile, too.
dialog: He’s just an impostor!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (raises her voice)
dialog: Mom! Calm down and answer me!
dialog: Where’s Dad? You didn’t leave him
dialog: on his own, did you?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Never thought you’d have a
dialog: vindictive mother, did you? You see
dialog: what I’ve become? It’s all his
dialog: fault. And yours! Who do you think
dialog: you are, you two? Go to hell!
text: Before Jane can interrupt again, Ella hangs up. She clutches
text: her head in her hands. She sobs. In a burst of anger, she
text: rips off the wig, exposing her little bird-like head. Her
dialog: daughter tries to call her back:
scene_heading: THE TELEPHONE RINGS
text: But Ella turns it off and slams it on the bed. She throws
text: herself down, then pulls herself up, almost out of breath.
text: She takes another sip of Canadian Club, swallows two blue
text: pills, throws herself back down. She turns out the light. But
text: she’s still wide-eyed.

scene_heading: JOHN’S HOUSE - NIGHT.
text: John sits in a chair in the waiting room. They’ve placed him
text: in front of a television to keep him happy while the Clerk
text: and Head Nurse discuss this absurd situation.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Maybe we should look for his
dialog: children online? We could explain
dialog: the situation to them.
speaker_heading: HEAD NURSE
dialog: I hope they aren’t like his wife.
dialog: Crazy woman.
text: They stop, because a taxi has pulled up in front of the
text: entrance, carrying Ella. She gets out with her cell-phone
text: pressed to her ear.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: You're right, Jane darling. I’m
dialog: sorry. I’m sorry!
text: She keeps the phone to her ear as she enters the lobby.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: I just don’t know what came over
dialog: me. Maybe it was my meds.
dialog: Everything's fine, darling. Daddy's
dialog: okay. No, I was only joking. I'd
dialog: never abandon him. Now, can you do
dialog: me a favor?
text: Now Jane is in her parents’ living room with Will and Philip,
text: all of them in pajamas.
dialog: Scene 55 Page 102.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (hesitant)
dialog: A favor?
text: Ella's in the waiting room. She steps up behind John. She
text: looks at him, though he’s unaware of her presence.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Go to Lillian and tell her
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Mom, Lillian’s...
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Tell her she’s the dirtiest whore
dialog: on earth.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (dumbfounded)
dialog: What did you say?
text: Jane, now in their parents’ kitchen, raises her eyes to
text: Lillian, who is also there, next to Will. Lillian wears a
text: sweater over her nightgown. After the first phone call
text: earlier that night they’ve organized a crisis team.
text: While Jane’s been left speechless, Ella, in the waiting room,
dialog: adds:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: No, in the universe. The biggest
dialog: whore in the whole universe.
text: Ella hangs up the phone and approaches the reception. The

speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Where’s my husband?
text: The Clerk points to the adjoining waiting room.
text: While in the kitchen Will asks:
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: So what's happening?
text: Jane watches Lillian and stutters:
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Nothing. Everything’s fine.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: But where are they?
dialog: Scene 55 Page 103.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I have no idea, but Mom seems
text: very... energized. And she sends
dialog: her love to you, Lillian.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Isn't that sweet...
text: Ella sees John in the waiting room, quietly watching a
text: basketball game on the TV with some other patients.
text: Ella’s still upset, but her anger has given way to
text: bitterness. She touches John’s shoulder. He turns and smiles
text: as if nothing has happened.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hi, darling Ella.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I understand everything. That night
dialog: you came home - remember? I smelled
dialog: of wax, or was it oil? Vinegar?
dialog: DDT? I was cleaning the floor. All
text: hot and sweaty. Seven months
dialog: pregnant.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (bewildered)
dialog: What?
text: The employees have reached them and are cautiously trying to
dialog: intervene:
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Ma’am? Is everything all right? Can
dialog: we call someone to come get you?
text: Ella is offended.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Can’t you see that I’m speaking
dialog: with my husband?
text: The Head Nurse exchanges a look with the Clerk, who seems
text: even more frightened. Ella turns to John and continues.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: You didn’t say anything, but you
dialog: got down on all fours to help.
dialog: Then, while I was taking a bath,
dialog: you got in the tub with me.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: Scene 55 Page 104.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn’t know anything, but I
dialog: sensed you were back. And although
dialog: I knew nothing, I forgave you.
text: Who knows how much John understands. He kisses her hand. Then
text: he gestures to the man who sits watching the game in the
text: chair next to him.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: This chap likes the Bulls. Raymond
dialog: Chandler was a Bulls fan.
dialog: Hemingway loved bulls. But that
dialog: was in Spain.
text: The Clerk talks to them as if they were spoiled children:
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: You really should be going. It’s
text: Mr. Davidson's bedtime.
text: Ella takes John by the hand and pulls him up:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Don’t worry. I’m not leaving my
dialog: husband in this dump to be treated
dialog: like a fool. Come on John.
text: John gets up nimbly, and when he sees Ella walking with

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Lean on me, sweetheart.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: And now I have to forgive you all
dialog: over again. 48 years later.
text: John understands nothing of what she’s saying, but seems to
text: sense her conciliatory tone.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Thank you, Ella.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I don’t know if I’m a bitch or
dialog: you're a son of a bitch.
text: John stops for a second, thinking about it.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I guess anything’s possible.

scene_heading: INT. CAMPER, MOVING DOWN THE OVERSEAS HIGHWAY - DAY 56
text: The Leisure Seeker seems to skip the surface of the water as

speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Could you pull over, John?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Let’s get down to look.
speaker_heading: JOHN

dialog: up here?
text: Ella loses her patience immediately.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: John, pull this camper over
dialog: immediately. I want to get out and
dialog: look.
text: John obeys. Ella opens the door and gets down. She walks to
text: the edge of the bridge, suspended between water and sky. John
text: reaches her after a moment. She hears him coming but does not
text: turn around. She speaks as she takes in nature’s sublimity:
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, John. It’s so beautiful.
text: John looks around in bewilderment.
speaker_heading: JOHN

scene_heading: EXT. KEY WEST CAMPSITE — DAY 57
text: John and Ella have hooked up the Leisure Seeker in a campsite

text: a bench with other guests to board a shuttle. He continues to
dialog: read his new favorite book, “Nature Pop-Ups Land Life.” He
text: points out the pop-up animals to a bemused TEXAN with a
text: cowboy hat sitting next to him.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (points to lion)
dialog: Hemingway shot one of these.
dialog: (points to giraffe) But not one of
dialog: these.
text: As he speaks, Ella steps up behind him. She watches her

dialog: this.
speaker_heading: TEXAN
dialog: (helpless)
dialog: There’s a Cuban restaurant down the

scene_heading: INT./EXT. HEMINGWAY HOUSE - DAY. 58
text: Hemingway's house is crowded with tourists. There’s the
text: restaurant, a shop full of souvenirs, tour guides who explain
dialog: the same things in the same words to different groups. Weird,
text: slightly evil cats lounge everywhere, photographed by phones
text: and posted immediately on Facebook. Ella is very disappointed
text: by the place, which seems to her to be as bogus as the set of
text: a TV show. She looks at John, mortified. But John doesn’t
text: seem disappointed at all. In fact, he throws himself into a
text: wedding ceremony taking place in the special wedding site on
text: the house’s grounds. He wanders happily among the guests, as
text: if they were his relatives. In the drunken chaos, no one
text: seems to mind him. They are from Miami, a mixture of Anglos
text: and Latinos; they make a real racket. John toasts strangers;

text: he even joins the group photo. Ella descends the porch stairs
text: and tries to take him by the arm, to get him out of there.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Enough of this farce, John. No one
dialog: will believe this.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: But Ella - Gary and Marisol are
dialog: getting married!
dialog: Scene 58 Page 107.
text: There’s a large banner in which the names are interwoven in a
text: heart. Ella’s not nervous, she’s afflicted with pain.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I’m sorry. You’ve wanted to come
dialog: for so many years. And look at it.
text: But John is no longer hearing her. He’s drawn to the bride
text: and her bridesmaids, who have lined up to dance, their white
text: dresses glowing against the deep green lawn. Someone puts on:
scene_heading: CUBAN SALSA TIMBA DANCE MUSIC
text: The girls in white begin to dance deliriously, all together,
text: as if possessed. John watches this ecstacy, and there’s a
text: hint of the dance in his own feet.
text: Ella, meanwhile, is stricken by a wave of nausea. She
text: soundlessly calls out. John doesn’t hear her, he doesn’t
text: notice. Ella goes in search of a bathroom to throw up. She’s
text: giddy and sweating. She cannot reach the toilet - she’s
text: gripped by a dizzy spell that sends her to the ground. She
text: loses consciousness. Nearby visitors call for help.
speaker_heading: VISITORS SUMMON HELP
text: In the garden, John is overwhelmed by the song, by how the
text: wedding guests sing together as the girls dance, like the
dialog: whole thing was choreographed:
text: In the house, paramedics load Ella onto a stretcher. No one
text: notices her little golden purse that lies on the ground just
text: outside the bathroom door. She seems to have a glimmer of
text: understanding as they load her on the ambulance. She realizes
text: what’s happening, that John is not with her.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: John. My husband.
text: She hasn't the strength to protest more strongly; her voice
dialog: is just a whisper.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Leave me alone. Please, I beg you.
dialog: I can’t go. John. Leave me...
text: The paramedics don’t hear her. As they close the ambulance
text: doors, Ella is overcome by feelings of illness and
text: exhaustion. She’s taken away mumbling:
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: John. John.
dialog: Scene 58 Page 108.
text: Working with cool efficiency, the paramedics put an oxygen
text: mask over her mouth, then pierce a vein and insert a drip.
text: The ambulance rushes off with siren screaming.
text: John walks into the house in a daze. He looks around in
text: amazement. He gazes at Hemingway's desk, which holds an old
text: Remington, just like his back home. He studies the framed
dialog: photos of the great writer in the company of Fidel and Che;
text: or marlin fishing on his boat Pilar. But there's something
text: missing. He’s lost something, but he cannot remember what it
text: is. He approaches a young female GUIDE.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: GUIDE
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I’m looking for...
speaker_heading: GUIDE
dialog: Looking for...?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Help me, please.
text: The Guide speaks to him like he’s a child.
speaker_heading: GUIDE
dialog: Are you looking for the bathroom?
text: It’s out back by the souvenir shop.
dialog: Do you feel okay?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Thank you, miss. You’re very
dialog: helpful.
text: He follows her directions. In the hallway outside the
text: bathroom, he sees Ella’s golden purse on the ground. He
text: stops, perplexed. It reminds him of something. He picks it
text: up, opens it, pulls out a lipstick and sniffs it.
scene_heading: EXT. LOWER KEYS MEDICAL CENTER - DAY 59
text: The taxi arrives at the hospital, a big modern edifice with
text: mirrored walls. John gets out with Ella’s purse in hand. The
text: taxi driver calls him back.
speaker_heading: KEY WEST CABBIE
dialog: Excuse me - sir?
dialog: Scene 59 Page 109.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It says dePoo Building.
speaker_heading: KEY WEST CABBIE
dialog: You want the emergency room
dialog: entrance. Now, that’1l be 35
dialog: dollars.
text: John smiles sweetly.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Don’t worry about it.
text: He walks away. The Cabbie gets out and goes after him.
speaker_heading: KEY WEST CABBIE
dialog: Hey man, don’t try to pull that
dialog: shit. You owe me 35 dollars.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Do I? Okay.
text: He opens Ella’s golden purse and takes out the money.
scene_heading: INT. LOWER KEYS MEDICAL CENTER - DAY. 60
text: John sits in front of a couple of doctors, who are speaking
text: very seriously, as if he could possibly understand them.
speaker_heading: FIRST DOCTOR
dialog: ...in order to figure out what was
dialog: causing these symptoms we did a
dialog: full body CAT scan. We certainly
dialog: didn’t expect a situation as grave
dialog: as what we found.
speaker_heading: SECOND DOCTOR
dialog: The original tumor was in the
dialog: colon, wasn’t it, Mr. Spencer?
text: John understands that he is being questioned.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I... yes, uh-huh, I’m John Spencer.
text: The doctors attribute his vagueness to a state of shock.
speaker_heading: FIRST DOCTOR
dialog: But now there’s been a bloodborne
dialog: spread through the lymphatic
dialog: system, attacking almost all
dialog: internal organs.
dialog: Scene 60 Page 110.
speaker_heading: SECOND DOCTOR
dialog: To be honest, Mr. Spencer, it’s
text: amazing that she’s even alive with
dialog: her blood chemistry readings.
speaker_heading: FIRST DOCTOR
dialog: Were you really taking an RV trip?
text: John looks at them, blinks, and asks:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Where is my wife?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Ella's in her hospital bed, attached to a drip, monitored,
text: half her face covered by an oxygen mask. The door opens and a
text: young CUBAN NURSE enters with John, who has her purse in
dialog: hand.
text: Ella opens her eyes as John approaches, then opens them wider
text: in amazement. She pulls away the oxygen mask.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Oh my god, John, how’d you get
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I brought you this.
text: She kisses him on the lips, then realizes that the nurse is
text: watching from the door.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: A little privacy, please.
speaker_heading: CUBAN NURSE
dialog: Oh, sorry.
text: She closes the door. Ella takes the purse and immediately
text: applies some make-up to her face, using the tiny mirror.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: It’s so amazing that you found me.
dialog: Who helped you?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Let's go.
text: She caresses John’s face, deeply moved.
dialog: 61
dialog: 62
dialog: Scene 60 Page 111.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I don’t know, hon. I don’t think
dialog: they’re going to release me now
dialog: that they’ve caught me.
text: But John stubbornly pulls back her covers and takes her hand.
text: He sees her shoes and arranges them beneath the side of the
text: bed, inviting her to get down. He drapes his jacket over the
text: shoulders of her hospital gown.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We'll go, now.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: They move through a crowded corridor, walking slowly, John
text: carefully supporting his wife. They pass by the reception
text: desk. Ella, wearing John’s jacket, is in great pain and
text: deeply confused. She looks around, not understanding how to
text: get out of here. She straightens her wig and, acting like a
text: visitor, stops a passing nurse:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Excuse me, where’s the exit?
text: The nurse, oblivious, shows the way out.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI, KEY WEST - SUNSET 61
text: John and Ella embracing aboard a taxi.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I can’t believe this. You're my
dialog: hero.
text: John smiles innocently.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: John? Oh my god...
text: John’s relaxed expression makes her realize that he’s taking
text: a big, satisfying piss. A dark stain widens on his pants.
scene_heading: EXT. KEY WEST CAMPSITE - DUSK 62
text: John, his pants wet, helps Ella out of the taxi at the
text: Leisure Seeker. When she can’t make it up the ladder, he
text: bends down and picks her up.
dialog: Scene 62 Page 112.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: What are you doing? You’ll give
dialog: yourself a hernia.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: But you’re so light, Ella...
scene_heading: KEY WEST CAMPSITE- INSIDE THE CAMPER - DUSK AND NIGHT 63
text: Carefully he lowers her to the bed. She’s exhausted and he’s
text: having trouble breathing. He stands in front of the bed, his
text: hand outstretched against the wall for balance, as he tries
text: to catch his breath. She looks at him.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: You need to change, John. Your
text: clean shorts are in the bottom
dialog: drawer. You'll have to excuse me
dialog: for not helping.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You rest.
text: He moves away from the wall. Regains his balance. Breathing
dialog: okay, now -
text: John takes off his soaked trousers, puts on his night-shirt,
text: while she takes a bottle of Valium from her bag.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: We both need a good nap. I’d given
dialog: up hope in the hospital; I didn’t
dialog: think I’d see our Leisure Seeker
dialog: ever again.
text: She's filled a glass with many drops of tranquilizer. She
text: hands it to John.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Drink half of this. Look at you,
dialog: you didn’t even wash. Come here.
text: As John drinks, she gets some wet wipes from a packet on the
dialog: nightstand.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on.
text: John obeys. She lifts his night shirt and cleans between his
text: thighs. Something happens that makes her laugh.
dialog: Scene 63 Page 113.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, goodness!
text: John smiles as well, proud of his unexpected erection. He
text: takes her hand and puts it on his cock.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hello, sweetheart.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (to his cock)
dialog: Well done. But you can stand down-
text: But John thinks otherwise. He lifts her hospital gown.
text: He maneuvers above her, on all fours. He starts gently to
text: open her legs
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: (conscious of impending
dialog: pain)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (total concentration)
dialog: Will you hand me the ‘what’s it’
dialog: there, please
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: The face creme?
text: She reaches for the tube/jar of creme on the night table.
text: John takes it and puts some on his cock and on her vagina
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t think I can, John.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We'll try. Just for a second -
text: Very, very carefully he penetrates her -
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay? Is it bearable?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Yes, darling. Yes. I’m okay -
text: After a moment he stope his push into her. Their pubic bones
dialog: are together-
dialog: Scene 63 Page 114.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (quietly astounded)
dialog: I’m there -
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Yes - there
text: He is dead still, looking down at her. He sees just the
text: faintest grimaces of discomfort in her eyes
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (hardly breathing)
dialog: Still all right? -
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (smiling slowly)
dialog: Yes. All right.
text: They lie still, then Ella starts to slowly move -
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Don’t move -
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (looking at him)
dialog: You don’t want to come?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No, just this -
text: Ella reaches up to his face and pulls him down to her lips
text: and very gently kisses him. There is an air of ethereal bliss
dialog: about them -
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I love you, John -
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: All my life, my darling. All my
dialog: life-
text: They lie there very still feeling every part of their
text: Aristophanic selves united and then, very gradually, he
text: starts to withdraw from her - Ella watches him. He
text: concentrates deliberately on his action
text: Finally, as if in slow motion, John moves off her and lies
text: beside her.
text: He is on her right side, his right hand moves between her
text: legs and encloses her vagina -
dialog: Scene 63 Page 115.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: (deeply moved)
dialog: This was perfect-
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Just perfect. Thank you, my darling
dialog: girl. You are very, very beautiful -
text: They lie there, the two of them, together, a whisper of s
text: smile, eyes closed, in a state of outer-worldly wonder and
dialog: peace.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: When she reopens them, it’s pitch black outside. John snores.
text: Ella gets up with difficulty, careful not to wake him.
text: At the small table, she finishes the letter she’s been
text: writing all trip. She folds it, writes ‘To Jane and Will’ on
text: the back, then leaves it on the table. She downs the
text: remaining half-glass of extra-strength Valium.
text: She goes to the driver's seat and starts the motor.
text: She bends down to the floor with a deep sigh to remove the
text: mat that covers the trap door. She rips off the tape. Exhaust
text: fumes begin to spread through the cabin. She joins John in
text: bed and hugs him. The fumes thicken, making everything fuzzy
text: and opalescent.
text: An image from outside: The Leisure Seeker vibrates with the
text: engine running under a full moon.
speaker_heading: ELLA V/O
dialog: My darling Jane and Will. Here’s
dialog: our lawyer’s number: I’ve taken
dialog: care of everything, all the
dialog: arrangements. There’s nothing for
dialog: you to worry about, although I
dialog: think our final Visa bill will be
dialog: outrageous. We had a bit of fun
text: there at the end.
scene_heading: EXT. KEY WEST CAMPSITE —- MORNING 64
text: The following morning, the Texan is having breakfast with his
text: wife. He sees that the Leisure Seeker’s engine is running.
text: Perplexed, he goes to knock on the door. Then he opens it.
speaker_heading: ELLA V/O
dialog: .».-I’m so sorry to hurt you like
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: Scene 64 Page 116.
speaker_heading: ELLA V/O (CONT'D)
dialog: I know how painful it must be. But
dialog: pretty soon you’re going to feel
dialog: something else. Relief. Relief
dialog: that you won’t have to watch our
text: bodies and our minds fade away.
dialog: Relief that the burden we were
dialog: becoming has been lifted from your
dialog: shoulders. And you musn’t feel
dialog: guilty about that...you musn’t.
text: A deeply upset Texan emerges from the Leisure Seeker, calling
text: for help. Other campers flock to the scene, joined by
text: campsite staff. One of them enters the camper to turn off the
text: engine, while someone else calls 911.
speaker_heading: ELLA V/O (CONT'D)
dialog: I loved your father. Very much. I
dialog: didn’t have much longer, and I
dialog: couldn’t leave him alone. We were
dialog: always together. And I hope we’re
dialog: together somewhere now. Who knows?
scene_heading: EXT. BOSTON CEMETERY - DAY. 64
text: The funeral’s in their home town cemetery. Will is there, as
text: is Jane, with her husband and their children: 21 year-old
text: Rose and 19 year-old Stephen. Many old friends. And Lillian,
text: who seems the saddest of all.
speaker_heading: ELLA V/O
dialog: This was our last wonderful
dialog: vacation. We had some beautiful
dialog: days. It was our happy ending.
text: As they walk away, Jane keeps a close eye on her brother,
text: worried that he will not be able to handle this.
text: Will folds his mother’s letter and puts it in his pocket.
text: He’s read and re-read it many times. He catches his sister's
dialog: eye:
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: How you doing, kiddo? Sad?
text: And he, with a bittersweet smile, shakes his head. He puts
text: his arm around her waist and they walk off together.
