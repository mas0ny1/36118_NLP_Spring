text: A strange ROARING sound...
text: CLOSE ON A YOUNG WOMAN
text: ...in darkness. Light begins to spill on her from the right
text: - revealing her face, lost in thought. This is RACHEL
text: SINGER - pretty, painfully young looking. A surgical
text: dressing covers half her face.
text: As we pull back a little we see that two YOUNG MEN sit
text: either side of her. They are STEPHAN GOLD (thirties) thick-
text: set, capable, and DAVID PERETZ (late twenties), dark-haired
text: and pale-faced.
text: The three faces in the darkness, each looking straight
text: ahead - something from a Caravaggio painting.
text: The roaring, which we realise is the sound of ENGINES
text: gradually runs down into silence.
text: The light from the bay door which is opening off-screen
text: begins to flood the scene with HARSH DAYLIGHT, revealing
text: the inside of a CARGO PLANE.
text: Stephan turns to look at the growing light. Then he turns
dialog: to Rachel.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: Breathe.
text: He stands. Rachel turns to look at David but he is standing
text: too, his face a mask.
text: Rachel gathers herself, then stands and turns to follow the

text: She emerges onto the empty patio, slides the glass door

text: She lights a cigarette, inhales greedily, trying to calm

text: As if sensing something she turns to see a SMALL BOY - her

dialog: Let's go.

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS 9
text: The apartment block stands on stilts. Abandoned furniture

scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 6.

text: Parked on the far side of the road, two identical cars,

text: The Agent moves to the leading car, opens the driver's door

dialog: But we'll have breakfast before

dialog: (To Sarah, ill-at-ease)
dialog: Well, I'll be back. We

speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: I've marked the place. I thought
dialog: perhaps from chapter eleven...?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: .»..Yes, thank you.
text: Rachel nods absently, flicking through the pages of the

dialog: has no idea what that means.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 8.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: If you'd rather read something

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No, that's fine.

scene_heading: UNIFORM. It's titled: DIETER VOGEL, "The Surgeon of

dialog: (A little automatic)
dialog: ...It's a wonderful achievement.
dialog: I'm very proud of her.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: And I'm sure you were invaluable

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (Keeping it light)
dialog: Actually, my mother withstood all
dialog: interrogation. My father was the
dialog: talker. (Trying a joke) I'm the
dialog: only journalist in Israel she
dialog: won't speak to.
text: Miriam laughs obligingly but Sarah instantly regrets the
dialog: remark.
text: There is a sudden excited MURMUR from the table. The women
text: look over to where Stephan approaches the table. He is ina

text: in the background.
text: Rachel's face hardens.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I thought he couldn't come.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (Standing up, surprised)
dialog: So did I.

speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: (To the politicos)

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You came.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: I came. So you're the famous
dialog: author I've heard so much about?
text: Rachel watches as he takes a place at the table, picks up a
text: copy of the book and examines the cover photograph, holding
text: his glasses a little from his eyes to focus.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (Without looking)
dialog: Rachel.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Stephan.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: (To Sarah)

dialog: It went well?
speaker_heading: SARAH'S HUSBAND
dialog: She was wonderful.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: That's good. Good, good. That's
dialog: very good.
text: Rachel takes a sip of water and notices Stephen's hands,
text: crumbling some bread - they're SHAKING.
text: She looks up at his face, reads the hidden STRAIN there.
text: He senses her gaze and meets it, and for a second his smile
text: falters and SOMETHING LIKE PANIC flickers in his eyes.
text: Rachel stares back at him, disturbed. Miriam stands,
text: tapping her glass with her fork.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 10.

speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: I just want thank you all for

dialog: table. And even more thrilled

dialog: read for us...
text: Applause. She gestures to Rachel who stands, still looking

text: at the marked place and hesitates, only now realising what
text: she is about to read. Then...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "On the evening of the 31st of

text: Young Rachel stands in the small kitchen. Rain lashes on

text: We TRACK with her as she walks into the...
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM 14
text: And begins to place the pots on the floor to catch the
text: rainwater which is dripping through various points in the
dialog: ceiling.
text: As she positions the last pot we REVOLVE around her to get
text: our first view of the far wall. And there, tied to a
text: radiator, is DIETER VOGEL, now 50. He's bound, his mouth
text: taped, apparently asleep.
text: Rachel doesn't, of course, react to this sight. Instead
text: she begins to clear away some pieces of BROKEN GLASS BOWL
text: from the floor. We TRACK with her as she walks back down
text: the short hallway into the kitchen, drops the pieces of
text: bowl into the bin. From the living room comes the three
text: distinct PINGS of rainwater dripping in the pots.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 11.
text: She stops suddenly, puzzled. It's a moment before she works
text: out what she's noticed - something has changed in the sound
text: of the rainwater next door.
text: There are only two drips instead of three.
text: She walks back towards the living room...
text: RACHEL'S P.O.V - through the living room door we can see
text: that one of the pots has been overturned. Rachel slows to a
text: stop. A sudden wave of adrenalin causes her to turn
text: but...it's too late. Vogel steps out of the alcove he's
text: been standing in so that he is directly in front of her.
text: Before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open
text: with a SHARD OF GLASS.
text: Instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face. Vogel
text: grabs her by the hair and stepping behind her, tries to
text: worm his other hand underneath her raised arms to reach her
text: throat with the glass.
text: Her training kicking in, Rachel uses a krav magah move to
text: grab and twist Vogel's forearm, breaking his hold on her
text: and turning the arm until, with a yell of pain, Vogel drops
text: the shard. He swings wildly at her, but Rachel ducks the
text: fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face.
text: Vogel stumbles back, surprised by her speed and the sudden
dialog: pain of the blow.
text: Rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded by
text: blood from her wound washing into her eyes.
text: As she wipes her eyes clear, Vogel grabs a LAMP from a
text: small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into her
text: face. She falls.
text: Vogel begins to run, but, driven by adrenaline and
text: desperation, Rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges at
text: him, catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards
text: the front door.
text: Vogel stumbles, manages to pull a leg free and stamps down
text: on Rachel who lets go with a moan. He stamps again, steps
text: free and kicks her hard in the head.
text: Rachel rolls with the force of the kick and comes to a
text: rest, losing consciousness.
scene_heading: RACHEL'S P.O.V - LOW ANGLE - Fluttering in and out of

scene_heading: EXT. TERRACE. HOTEL NEAR TEL AVIV - NIGHT 23

text: After a moment a CAR purrs alongside. She ignores it for a
text: moment, keeps on walking, the car cruising beside her.
text: Finally, almost angrily, she stops and gets in. The YOUNG
text: AGENT sits in the back seat next to her. The car pulls
text: smoothly away.
scene_heading: EXT. TEL AVIV AIRPORT - DAY 38
text: Rachel climbs from the car and walks towards the building,
text: pulling her wheeled suitcase.
text: The young agent has climbed out and moves swiftly ahead of

scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT PASSPORT CONTROL - DAY 39
text: Rachel looks down at her passport. We see her PHOTOGRAPH

speaker_heading: RACHEL'S P.0.V
text: A CROWD of people are waiting beyond the check-point for

text: one YOUNG MAN has his back to us, turning away to light a
dialog: cigarette.
text: Then he turns - Young David - a fine, sensitive face,
text: darkly shadowed eyes. This is the SHOT we saw earlier. A
text: moment when we see how anxious he is to play his part
text: right. Then he smiles his beautiful smile...

scene_heading: INT. EAST BERLIN - SAFE HOUSE. DAY 45
text: The place looks like a squat.
text: YOUNG Stephan sits playing idly at a battered old upright
text: piano, a cigarette in his mouth. He looks up as David and
text: Rachel walk in and stand framed in the doorway, looking
text: every inch the young married couple. Stephan looks at them
text: for a beat, then starts to play the first few bars of
text: Mendelssohn's wedding march.
dialog: 46
text: The other two blush furiously, not amused. Rachel takes her
dialog: case from David.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Where do I sleep?

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - LATER 46

text: Both men can hear the BATH RUNNING in the bathroom, both
dialog: very aware of this new female presence in the house they've

speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: What do you think of your new

text: David frowns at the steel strip, seeming preoccupied.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Too young.

speaker_heading: STEPHAN

speaker_heading: STEPHAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You didn't notice.
text: He begins to sort his possessions out.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what I've noticed? You
dialog: don't notice women. I've noticed

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (examining the steel)
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: Two years. All the places we've

dialog: Before I get into that bed, is
dialog: there anything you have to tell
dialog: me?
text: David sighs, blows on the steel strip and holds it up for
dialog: Stephan to examine.
text: We hear the bathroom door open and there is a quick glimpse
text: of Rachel wrapped in a towel as she slips past the door
text: heading for her room. The two men watch her pass. Stephan

speaker_heading: STEPHAN

text: to hear more but the voices fall silent.
scene_heading: 48 INT. SAFEHOUSE - MORNING 48
text: David, holding a kitchen knife, MOVES TO STAB Stephan.
text: Stephan uses a krav magah move to disarm him. The knife
text: clatters to the floor as he twists David's arm behind his
dialog: back.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 21.
text: There's an element of showing off and Stephan uses a
text: little more force than is necessary. David winces but
text: doesn't say anything.
text: Stephan turns to Rachel who has been watching.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: Yes?
text: Rachel nods and they change places. David picks up the
text: knife and repeats the "attack" move on her. She disarms him
dialog: easily.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN (CONT'D)
text: Now an attack from behind.
text: David takes his position, grabbing Rachel from behind, but
text: he's so awkward with her the attack seems a little
dialog: tentative.
text: Stephan talks as Rachel practises breaking free from the
dialog: hold.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Where have you come from?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Argentina.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: My husband is an Industrial

speaker_heading: STEPHAN

speaker_heading: STEPHAN (CONT'D)
dialog: She's not going to fucking break
dialog: David. Move.
text: He takes David's place.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (Beat)

speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: So, first time in the field.
text: Rachel feels herself blush a little angrily. Stephan grabs

scene_heading: 51 INT. BERLIN SAFE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM. CONTINUOUS. 51

dialog: 53
dialog: 54
dialog: 55
text: forces herself to look at the terrible PHOTOGRAPHS inside -

text: held up by two Nazi nurses, a row of DEAD BABIES, rulers
dialog: laid beside them to indicate dimensions...
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 23.

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - MORNING 53
text: A tram trundles down the wide Berlin street.
text: Rachel and David are walking to Vogel's surgery, holding
text: hands. She's pale, very frightened. David walks, trying,
text: and failing, to think of anything to say to her.
text: He suddenly notices an odd sound. It's Rachel, humming
text: tunelessly to herself, very low. Something about this
text: pierces him. He gives her hand a squeeze.
scene_heading: EXT. CLINIC - DAY 54
text: The two stand in the doorway, at the foot of the stairs

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (In German)

text: Indistinct shadows move on the other side.
text: She turns to look at the other two women sitting looking
text: through magazines, then back to the door. A shadow darkens
text: as it approaches the glass, then the door opens and a NURSE

scene_heading: INT. EXAMINATION ROOM. DAY. 56
text: Rachel stands behind a SCREEN, trying to control her
text: nerves. All we can hear is the sound of RUNNING WATER and
text: Rachel's tense breathing. Finally she takes off her skirt
text: and unbuttons her blouse with trembling fingers. She puts
text: on the gown, and slips out of her underpants, stumbling as
text: she steps out of them.
text: We TRACK with her as she walks out from behind the screen
text: into the large brightly lit room. She walks towards the
text: GYNAECOLOGICAL CHAIR at the centre of the room. On the far
text: wall, behind a screen, someone stands washing their hands
text: at a basin.
text: As she walks, Rachel passes a tray of MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS,
text: her glance lingering on it.
text: She reaches the chair and climbs onto it. A pause and then,
text: tentatively, she lifts her feet into the stirrups, tugging
text: the gown to cover herself as best she can.
text: She tries to steady her breathing, focussing on the
text: ceiling. A bright LIGHT shines down on her.
text: We hear footsteps approach.
text: Rachel closes her eyes.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: Good morning, Frau Roget. I'm
dialog: Doctor Bernhardt.
text: Rachel opens her eyes. Vogel is sitting on a small stool,

dialog: us.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Good morning, doctor.
text: He turns and smiles at us - and he has a wonderful, warm
text: smile, the air of a gruff but kindly Uncle.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: Alright now, just relax. We're
text: going to do a little examination.
dialog: If you feel at all uncomfortable,
dialog: you just say. Alright?
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 25.
text: She manages to nod.
speaker_heading: VOGEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, this is my hand... and
dialog: this is the speculum. It's going
dialog: to feel cold.
text: Rachel reacts as Vogel pushes the speculum into place,

speaker_heading: VOGEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I ask how old you are?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Twenty five.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: And how long have you and your

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Nearly two years.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: Uhuh. Well, the ovaries look
dialog: fine. Alright, let's see... your
text: cervix is slightly retroverted.
dialog: Tilted backwards?
text: Rachel raises her hand to her LOCKET NECKLACE and begins to
dialog: fiddle with it.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Really?
text: The angle from which we next see VOGEL, and the way the
text: image of his face freezes in black and white, tells us
text: clearly that this locket conceals a CAMERA DEVICE.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: Mmm. But that generally shouldn't
dialog: affect fertility.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Oh, good.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: You have a slight accent, Frau

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Argentina. We just moved here...
dialog: A few months ago.

speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: Whereabouts in Argentina? Buenos
dialog: Aires?
text: He looks up at her and Rachel instinctively moves her hand
text: away from the locket. She finds herself nodding.
text: Vogel looks away again. Rachel bites down on a wave of
dialog: panic.
speaker_heading: VOGEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, Buenos Aires. Beautiful. I
dialog: went once, when I was young. We
dialog: went to the Opera house I
dialog: remember. What's it called again?

scene_heading: EXT. QUIET STREET - DAY 58
text: The two turn the corner, out of sight of the clinic. David
text: glances at her. She looks pale, shaken. He feels a wave of
text: sudden tenderness for her, opens his mouth to say something
text: then catches himself.
text: CLOSE on their hands. After a moment David LETS GO. They
dialog: walk on.

dialog: So. Everything...?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (in German, abruptly)
dialog: Next appointment is on Wednesday.

text: Stephan he is uncomfortable with the thought of what Rachel
dialog: has been through.

dialog: face...
text: But then Rachel lets go and walks off towards the toilets.

text: side, wriggling back as far as he can.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: If it's them, he dies.
text: Vogel lies, breathing hard through his nose, eyes on the
text: gun aimed at him.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 67.
text: David suddenly steps in between the two, the gun now
text: pointing at his chest.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Move.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You're not doing this.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: He's not getting away from me.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: This isn't the mission.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: I decide what the mission is! If
dialog: I say he dies, he dies.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We're finishing this mission.
dialog: We're taking him back.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: Get out of the way!
text: There is another KNOCK at the door. David and Stephan stare
text: at each other, the tension building. Abruptly Rachel turns
text: and walks down the hallway towards the door. Stephan calls
dialog: after her.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: Rachel. Rachel!
text: From the hallway we hear the sound of the door being opened
text: - the murmur of conversation.
text: The two men stand frozen, listening. Vogel lies, breathing
text: hard through his nose.
text: We hear the door close. The three listen as footsteps
text: approach down the hall...
text: Rachel walks back in. A long beat.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (Dully)
dialog: It was the lady from the bottom
dialog: apartment. She invited us to her
dialog: New Year's Eve party.
text: She turns and walks back out. The others stay where they
dialog: are, frozen.
text: We hear a PIANO PLAYING as we...

scene_heading: 150 KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: 150
text: As the piano music plays we see David and Stephan practise
text: krav magah moves - careful, controlled, but under it all an
text: edge of real tension between them.
speaker_heading: 151 LIVING ROOM
dialog: 151
text: Vogel is tied in his usual place. Stephan sits ina
text: dangerous mood. He's playing the piano. A lyrical rendering
text: of Deutschland Uber Alles. Vogel is watching him.
speaker_heading: 152 KITCHEN
dialog: 152
text: As the music continues the two men's workout grows more
text: intense - the punches and blocks build in speed, faster and

dialog: 153
dialog: 154
dialog: 154
dialog: 155
dialog: 155
dialog: 156
dialog: 156
text: faster, both men breathing hard with the exertion, neither
text: willing to stop, a real violence simmering under the
dialog: surface.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Stephan knows he's watched and avoids Vogel's gaze until he
dialog: can stand it no longer and looks...
speaker_heading: KITCHEN
text: David is the first to break through the blocks - his fist
text: stopping inches from Stephen's face. The two men freeze,
text: staring at each other, breathing hard. The music crashes to
text: a halt.
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: Stephan is staring at Vogel. He begins to play the anthem
text: more discordantly, hitting the keys more violently, as if
text: the music is possessing him.
text: Then suddenly he stops, stands up and walks away from the
text: keyboard. Stares at Vogel.
text: Vogel is very aware of the sudden change in atmosphere, a
text: sense of impending violence.
text: Stephan doesn't move. The moment hangs.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: David is taking over the shift from Stephan. They pass each
text: other in the doorway without a word.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 69.
text: David stops, staring...
text: Vogel lies in his usual place. A SACK has been placed over
text: his head, hooding him.
text: The effect is deeply sinister.
dialog: 157
dialog: 157
scene_heading: KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
text: Stephan sits eating with Rachel. David walks in and throws
text: the SACK on the table. Stephan glances at it, continues
dialog: eating.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: It's your shift.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (To Rachel)
dialog: Did you know about this?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (To Stephan)
dialog: His mouth's taped. You want him
dialog: to suffocate?
speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: I was sick of seeing his face. Go
dialog: back in.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Don't do that again.
text: Stephan gets up and walks calmly towards David as if
text: shooing him back out the room.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: You don't give orders David. It's
dialog: your shift now so you can go back
dialog: in there...
text: He has his hands on David's chest, gently pushing him back.
text: David takes his hold of the hands, pulling them free and
text: suddenly there's a flurry of violent movement as Stephan
text: yanks his arms free of David and the two men shove at each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Stop it!
text: They stop, breathing hard.

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We're not animals. Just remember
dialog: what we are. Remember what we're
dialog: not.
text: He walks back out. Stephan sits back at the table, starts
text: eating again. He glances at Rachel, but she won't look at
text: him. After a moment she gets up and walks out.
scene_heading: INT. SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: David looks up from his chair to see in the hallway.
text: Something purposeful in her manner alerts him.
scene_heading: HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: David appears in time to see Rachel is putting on her
dialog: overcoat.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Rachel doesn't look at him.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I have to get out.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (Gently)
dialog: Rachel...
text: Rachel tries to unbolt the door. David bars her. Rachel
text: tries to talk calmly but she's fighting panic.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Get out of my way, please.
dialog: I'm just going to go out for a
dialog: few minutes. That's all I want to
dialog: do.
text: Stephan walks out of the kitchen, taking in the scene.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She wants to go out.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (appealing)
dialog: No one will see me. Tell him,
dialog: David. I just want to walk. I
dialog: just want to get some...air.
dialog: 160
dialog: 160
dialog: Please.
text: Stephan shakes his head.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 71.
text: Rachel tries to unlock the door, but David has hold of it.
text: She struggles against him.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: Don't be stupid.
text: He takes her arm. Rachel jerks free.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: GET OFF ME!
text: Then she slumps against the door, her back to them. She's
text: crying brokenly.
text: A beat as the two men stand over her, not attempting to
dialog: comfort her any further.
text: Stephan turns and walks away.
text: David leans his head against the door, waiting for her to
dialog: stop.
scene_heading: INT. SAFEHOUSE - LIVING ROOM. EVENING.
text: It's raining heavily outside and water is dripping through
text: the cracks in the ceiling.
text: David kneels next to VOGEL with a bowl of oatmeal and
text: strips the tape from his mouth.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: Thank you. David.
text: David doesn't react.
text: Vogel hums a tune to himself in between spoonfuls, watching
text: David, his mood strange.
speaker_heading: VOGEL (CONT'D)
dialog: David and Stephan and Rachel...
text: He gives a soft laugh, finding something amusing in the
dialog: sound of the names.
speaker_heading: VOGEL (CONT'D)
dialog: If I had a choice I'd prefer
dialog: Rachel to feed me. So gentle...in
dialog: another life, the makings of a
dialog: Nurse, I think...in another
dialog: life...
text: David continues to feed, careful to appear immune to Vogel.
speaker_heading: VOGEL (CONT'D)
dialog: How is she today?
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 72.
speaker_heading: VOGEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You should let her get more rest.
dialog: It's a dangerous time, the first
dialog: month or two of the pregnancy.
text: David stares at him, unable to hide his shock.
speaker_heading: VOGEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: You didn't know?
text: Vogel absorbs this thoughtfully.
speaker_heading: VOGEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You're not the father then?
dialog: (Beat) I thought it would be you.
dialog: I thought...I don't know. The way
dialog: you look at her. The way she
dialog: looks at you...
text: David stirs the oatmeal, trying to think about what he's
text: just discovered. Vogel doesn't take his eyes off him...
speaker_heading: VOGEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Women can be like that, they like
dialog: to make you dance first, I
dialog: remember. (As though to himself)
dialog: So, she chose the other one...?
text: He shakes his head, shrugs.
speaker_heading: VOGEL (CONT'D)
dialog: That must be hard, watching them
dialog: together, right in front of you.
dialog: And you not saying a word. Like
dialog: the Poet says - "Great souls
dialog: suffer in silence." I wouldn't
dialog: have taken Stephan as a family
dialog: man. Too ambitious, too...?
dialog: Whereas you? David, I see you
dialog: with children...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (Quietly)
dialog: Shut up.
text: Vogel stares at him. This is the first time someone has
text: spoken to him in weeks. He's quick to hide his sense of
dialog: triumph.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: I am expressing my sympathy. For
dialog: your suffering.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What does a monster like you know
dialog: about suffering?
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 73.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: I'm a doctor, David.
text: David stares at him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: A doctor. (beat) You blind
dialog: children trying to change the
dialog: colour of their eyes. You inject
dialog: people with petrol. You...you
dialog: replace people's hands and legs
dialog: and you watch as they...
text: He stops himself.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: This isn't medicine. This is
dialog: disease. This is sickness.
text: Vogel seems to consider this.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: So we were all insane? Is that
dialog: the answer?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: There's no answer. I'm not
dialog: looking for an answer. I'm not
dialog: looking for...
text: He forces himself to be silent, tries to regain control of
text: himself. He offers Vogel another spoonful, but his hand
text: trembles a little with the violence of his emotions.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: You're trembling.
text: David pushes the spoon into Vogel's mouth, starts to load
text: another spoonful.
speaker_heading: VOGEL (CONT'D)
dialog: It's strange. Here I am - the
text: victim, kidnapped, bound, soon to
dialog: be murdered, but I think you are
dialog: the one that is afraid, David.
dialog: (Beat) Afraid of the monster.
text: He leans closer to David.
speaker_heading: VOGEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (Softly)
dialog: Boo.
text: They stare at each other, eye to eye. Vogel senses a new
text: brittleness in David. His tone becomes more assured.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 74.
speaker_heading: VOGEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes. Do you know why it was easy
dialog: to exterminate you people?
dialog: Your weakness. I saw it. Every
dialog: day I saw it. Every one of them,
dialog: thinking only of how to avoid
dialog: being flogged, or kicked, or
dialog: killed. Only thinking of
dialog: themselves.
text: David looks up at him with a strange, crooked smile, eyes
dialog: glittering.
speaker_heading: VOGEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Why do you think it only took
dialog: four soldiers to lead a thousand
dialog: people to the gas chambers?
dialog: Entire families? Because not one,
dialog: out of thousands, had the courage
dialog: to resist, the courage to be the
dialog: first to fall. Not one would
dialog: sacrifice himself. Even when we
dialog: took their children from them. I
dialog: knew then that you people had no
dialog: right to live, no right to...
text: He may have begun his speech hoping to get a reaction from
text: David but he has lost himself in his rant and so rather
text: than triumph we see only a moment of startled fear in his
text: eyes as David suddenly swings the bowl violently at his
text: head, SHATTERING IT on the pipe to which he is tied.
text: He grabs Vogel by the collar and begins to punch him, hard,
dialog: again and again.
text: Vogel slides sideways, limp. And still David punches him in
text: a murderous rage, possessed, wanting to break his skull
text: open, to kill him.
text: Rachel and Stephan run in, with Rachel reaching him first.
text: She throws her arms around him, trying to stop him, but -
text: instinctively - he throws a punch behind him. It connects,
text: splitting her lip and sending her flying to the ground.
text: Stephan runs at him, knocking him to the floor, and remains
text: lying on him, the two of them breathing hard, the assault
text: finally over.
text: VOGEL slumps forward, held up only by the rope at his
text: wrists binding him to the pipe on the wall.
text: Stephan is still struggling with David, who's panting,
text: adrenalised, staring wildly at Vogel's slumped body.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: Out. We're going out.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 75.
text: He begins to drag him out. Stephan nods in the direction of
speaker_heading: VOGEL.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Rachel)
dialog: Are you going to be alright?
text: Rachel nods.
text: As she hears the door close, she turns to stare at Vogel.
text: He's barely conscious, his face smeared with blood.
scene_heading: 161 INT. SAFEHOUSE - BATHROOM. NIGHT.
dialog: 161
text: Rachel drenches a cloth under the tap.
scene_heading: 162 INT. SAFEHOUSE - LIVING ROOM. MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 162
text: Rachel cleans the blood from VOGEL's face. He has his eyes
dialog: closed.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: (Mumbling, in German)
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
text: She tears off a new strip of tape and places it over
text: VOGEL's mouth, gently.
text: She notices the rain leaking in through the ceiling and
text: walks off towards the kitchen. We hold on Vogel, apparently
text: sleeping. Then his tied hand reaches out, straining and
text: manages to reach one of the SHARDS of broken bowl.
scene_heading: 163 KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 163
text: Rachel gathers three METAL SAUCEPANS.
text: She stops for a moment looking at FIREWORKS flashing in the
text: sky. She remembers - it's New Years Eve.
text: We TRACK with her as she walks into the living room and
text: begins to place the pots on the floor to catch the
text: rainwater which is dripping through various points in the
dialog: ceiling.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON VOGEL'S HANDS

scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 76.
speaker_heading: ON RACHEL
text: ..as she finishes with the pots and notices the pieces of
text: shattered bowl scattered around Vogel. She kneels down in
text: front of him and collects up the pieces. She glances up at
text: Vogel, checking him. He is still slumped, eyes closed.
text: We TRACK with her as she walks back into the kitchen. From
text: the living room comes the three distinct PINGS of rainwater
text: dripping in the pots.
text: She drops the pieces of bowl into the bin and stops,
text: puzzled. It's a moment before she works out what she's
text: noticed - something has changed in the sound of the
text: rainwater next door. There only two drips instead of three.
text: She walks back towards the living room...
text: RACHEL'S P.O.V - through the living room door we can see
text: that one of the pots has been overturned. Rachel slows to a
text: stop. A sudden wave of adrenalin causes her to turn
text: but...it's too late. Vogel steps out of the alcove he's
text: been standing in so that he is directly in front of her.
text: Before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open
text: with a SHARD OF GLASS.
text: Instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face. Vogel
text: grabs her by the hair and stepping behind her, tries to
text: worm his other hand underneath her raised arms to reach her
text: throat with the glass.
text: Her training kicking in, Rachel uses a krav magah move to
text: grab and twist Vogel's forearm, breaking his hold on her
text: and turning the arm until, with a yell of pain, Vogel drops
text: the shard. He swings wildly at her, but Rachel ducks the
text: fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face.
text: Vogel stumbles back, surprised by her speed and the sudden
dialog: pain of the blow.
text: Rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded by
text: blood from her wound washing into her eyes.
text: As she wipes her eyes clear, Vogel grabs a LAMP from a
text: small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into her
text: face. She falls.
text: Vogel begins to run, but, driven by adrenaline and
text: desperation, Rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges at
text: him, catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards
text: the front door.
text: Vogel stumbles, manages to pull a leg free and stamps down
text: on Rachel who lets go with a moan. He stamps again, steps
text: free and kicks her hard in the head.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 77.
text: Rachel rolls with the force of the kick and comes to a
text: rest, losing consciousness.
scene_heading: RACHEL'S P.O.V - LOW ANGLE - Fluttering in and out of

text: He reaches the gate and goes through, his shadow

text: He's gone.
scene_heading: INT. BERLIN SAFEHOUSE - LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
text: Rachel holds a blood-soaked tea towel to her cheek, trying

speaker_heading: STEPHAN
text: Nothing. Not a trace. Nothing at
dialog: all.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 78.
text: He hurries to the drawers and takes out the gun, puts it
text: into his waistband.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN (CONT'D)
dialog: He might go to the house, might
dialog: try and get a message to the
dialog: wife...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (Without looking up)
text: He's not going back to the house.
dialog: He's gone. Fifteen years, it took

dialog: And no-one's going to find him

speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: So we what? We...are you going to

speaker_heading: DAVID

text: Stephan drops the gun onto the table, sits down. Outside we

speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: No-one's ever going to find him

text: Something in his voice causes Rachel to look up at him.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: What if he didn't escape?
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 79.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: Only four people know what

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (Realizing what he
dialog: means)
speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: Nobody needs to know what
dialog: happened here.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: He escaped.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: That's the truth. But that
dialog: doesn't have to be the truth we
dialog: take home. The truth can be
dialog: anything we want it to be. The
dialog: truth is Vogel tried to escape,
dialog: you struggled with him and got
dialog: hurt. The truth is, seconds
dialog: before he got away, Rachel got
text: the gun and shot him. The truth
dialog: is we got rid of him.... got rid
dialog: of the body... got rid of every
text: trace of the Surgeon of Birkenau.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: We can't lie about this!
speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: No, you know what? We have to. We
dialog: have to! This is...this isn't
dialog: about us. This is about Israel.
dialog: This is a national humiliation!
dialog: We can't be seen to fail. And in
text: the end, Vogel rots away his life
text: in some jungle, looking over his
dialog: shoulder, waiting for the
dialog: bullet...? Who's to say...?
text: He looks at them both, trying to convince them, trying to

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He's gone. What does it
dialog: matter? (Beat) He's gone.

speaker_heading: STEPHAN
dialog: (Seizing )
dialog: He's right. It makes no

text: The truth stays in this room.
dialog: Between us. Agreed?
text: Rachel looks at David again, wanting some kind of sign.
speaker_heading: STEPHAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'll tell you something. At that

scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 104.

scene_heading: INT. TOILETS. BABENKO HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Rachel sits in a CUBICLE. She takes the BLACK CASE from her

text: the false bottom of the case away to reveal a HYPODERMIC

scene_heading: INT. ROOM 414 - CONTINUOUS
text: Rachel enters the room. The curtains are drawn and Rachel
text: hesitates for a moment, her eyes adjusting to the gloom.

text: She walks through them, staring at faces. Is he here? Is he
dialog: amongst this ordinary world?
text: She feels her pace quicken as she's drawn on through the
text: room. It's as if she's back at that terrible night. Vogel's
text: ahead of her somewhere, escaping all over again.
text: She FLASHES through DOUBLE DOORS into a junction area - a
text: long, empty corridor leading away from her on the right,
text: ahead another set of double doors...
text: She bursts through these doors and finds herself in...
scene_heading: 241 INT. LOCKER ROOM/BATHROOM - DAY
dialog: 241
text: A long, white tiled corridor of a room. A row of windows
text: down the right, under which sit WASHBASINS. There's a row
text: of LOCKERS and DOORS along the left.
text: Rachel walks on, feeling increasingly as if she's ina
dialog: dream.
text: She's deep into the room before she realises it's a dead-
text: end - there's no exit ahead of her.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: (a dull rasp)
dialog: Why did you come...?
text: She turns and freezes.
text: Vogel has emerged from one of the doorways on the left. Now
text: he's between her and the doors on the far side of the room.

speaker_heading: VOGEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Why did you have to come? You
dialog: didn't have to follow me.
text: He begins to advance slowly towards her.
speaker_heading: VOGEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Was it Schevchuk? Did he talk?
text: Rachel stands frozen as he creeps closer. He reaches out a
text: hand as if to reassure her, a ghastly attempt at
dialog: reasonableness.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: I can stop him. I won't tell him
dialog: anymore. (Almost pleading) Nobody
dialog: needs to know.
text: As if the spell has broken Rachel makes a sudden dart for
text: the doors. But before she can pass him, Vogel has moved
text: with surprising speed and, almost before Rachel has seen
text: the SCISSORS in his other hand, he has stabbed them into
text: her shoulder.
text: She reels over against the opposite wall, dislodging a
text: GLASS SHELF which shatters into a WASHBASIN behind her.
text: Vogel goes after her, pinning her against the basin, one
text: hand on her throat, the other hand trying to stab her
text: again. Rachel manages to grab the scissor hand and the two
text: struggle frantically.
text: The scissors inch closer to her FACE, to her EYE.
text: Her other hand emerges from the basin behind her holding a
text: piece of the broken glass shelf, which she whips across
text: Vogel's face.
text: He gives a horrible shriek and lets her go, clutching at
text: his cheek.
text: Rachel collapses gasping to the floor.
text: Moaning, Vogel stumbles to a basin, blood dripping down
text: onto the white porcelain from his slashed face.
text: He suddenly notices Rachel has made it to her knees and is
text: trying to crawl towards the door
text: He walks after her, pulls back her head, gets ready to stab
text: the scissors into her throat.

dialog: You Jews never knew how to kill.

scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 114.
text: Then he gives a gasp of pain, eyes closed, his whole body
text: doubling with the pain, hands weakly scrabbling at the
text: PIECE OF GLASS Rachel has stabbed into his thigh.
text: He falls, almost on top of Rachel, and she finds herself
text: pressed against his contorted face as he hisses and spits
text: in agony.
text: His hand searches blindly for the dropped scissors.
text: Rachel grapples with him, almost embracing him, apparently
text: trying to prevent him for reaching it.
text: His searching hand locates the scissors and his eyes open
text: in triumph, staring straight into Rachel's. He raises the
text: scissors above his head.
text: Then he stabs Rachel in the stomach.
text: Rachel jack-knifes, as if she's been punched.
text: Then...nothing. Both lie still. The only sound is Vogel's

text: .»..as he walks down the corridor, breathing hard, trying to
text: make it back to his room, back to safety.
text: Suddenly he staggers against the wall.
text: Something's wrong, something in his back. He twists around
text: trying to locate the source of the strange sensation. And
text: there it is - the HYPODERMIC NEEDLE Rachel has stuck
text: between his shoulders.
text: He touches it with his fingertips, eyes wide with horror,
text: feeling the rush of lethal chemicals through his blood. He
text: twists again trying to pull the needle free but his legs
text: are already giving way and he collapses to the floor.
text: Moments later he's dead.
