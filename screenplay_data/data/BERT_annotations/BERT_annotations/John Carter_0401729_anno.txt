scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE SKIES - DAY
text: Endless green, lush and wild, extends to the horizon...as we
text: soar with two MILITARY HELICOPTERS. On a mission.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL AFRICAN JUNGLE - DAY
text: A COMBAT BOOT splashes down amidst torrential rain. It belongs
text: to CAPTAIN JOHN CARTER (28), of Dev Group, the most elite of
text: special forces units. He’s handsome but world-weary. A wisdom
dialog: beyond his years.
text: He spins at a close sound -- rifle now aimed at a tiny RED
text: LIZARD, who regards him like a visitor from another planet.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: Clear.
text: Three seconds later, a DOZEN ARMY RANGERS fast rope into view
text: all around him, at the base of their tethers--
text: --dropping from the two HELICOPTERS hovering above. The CHOPPER
text: WASH whips the terrain, but the rainstorm drowns the sound. The
text: little lizard darts away for his life.
text: A soldier lands next to Carter -- JAMES POWELL (27), all
text: tattoos, attitude, rock & roll. James Dean with a captain's
text: commission. They trade a nod. Nice landing.
text: And then watch as a CIA MAN descends on the last tether, missing
text: the clearing, crashing through branches and landing in a puddle
text: on his ass. Amused, Powell locks to Carter:
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: War is hell.
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE CLEARING - DAY
text: A BINOCULAR POV of a jungle settlement -- a village of huts and
text: shacks, now occupied by members of an AFRICAN REBEL ARMY. A
text: handful of ragtag SOLDIERS, one with a Stinger launcher.
speaker_heading: CARTER (0.S.)
text: Ten I can see. AK's, RPG‘S...two Jeeps
text: with machine gun mounts. Intel's right
dialog: about the Stingers.
text: Carter (lowering the binocs), lies next to Powell, hidden at the
text: jungle’s edge.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: The villagers are being held ina
text: school house on the northeast edge.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Take five men from the east and
dialog: eliminate every rebel you encounter.
dialog: I'll do the same from the south.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What about the civilians?
text: Powell doesn’t answer.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: We're here to liberate them... right?
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: If possible.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What have you and that spook cooked up?
text: Powell gives Carter a long look.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Okay. You gotta right to know. Story
text: is some gemstone showed up at a London
text: jeweler’s. The CIA got hold of it.
dialog: Turns out to be a whole new type of
dialog: mineral. Never seen before. Has some
dialog: amazing properties. Lots of uses.
dialog: Lasers...and other tech stuff. They
dialog: traced it back to this village. We've
dialog: been ordered to locate and secure the
dialog: source. Everything else is secondary.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Once again, they feed us a phony story
dialog: so we’ll do their dirty work.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: It's the job.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Maybe. But I’m still coming in from
dialog: the Northeast.
text: Carter starts to head out. Powell sighs.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Bad tactics. But we’ll all go in from
dialog: the Northeast. Isolate the civilians
dialog: first.
dialog: 3.
text: Powell sticks out his fist. Carter bumps it with his fist.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Still friends?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Womb to tomb.
scene_heading: INT. REBEL COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER
text: KABOOM! CONCUSSION GRENADES blast through the walls, causing a
text: quartet of REBEL OFFICERS to dive for cover. Maps and mineral
text: samples scatter to the ground--
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE CLEARING
text: --as the Army Ranger unit STORMS the village from all sides.
text: SHARPSHOOTERS lay down cover fire, as Carter, Powell and others
dialog: race to cover of mud huts--
text: --picking off REBELS as‘they'race into view, guns blazing. It’s
text: chaotic urban warfare, deep in a remote jungle.
text: Carter and Powell advance with care as RAT-A-TATATATA! --
text: AUTOMATIC FIRE eats up the dirt dead ahead. A GUNNER in a
text: thatched-roof tower atop a tribal worship house fires a MACHINE
text: GUN. Carter’s on his radio:
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Sniper in the compound!
text: A REBEL JEEP pulls into view from the other direction. Two
text: rebels with Kalashnikovs take a bead on Carter and Powell--
scene_heading: INT. VILLAGE HUT
text: --forcing them to dive inside as mud walls get RIDDLED with
text: gunfire. Holes POP just above the level of their heads. Powell
text: glares at Carter, who frowns--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Never say it’s your last mission.
scene_heading: EXT. EDGE OF VILLAGE
text: Carter and Powell dart out another way, trading FIRE with the
text: chasing Jeep. Powell takes out the DRIVER and the Jeep crashes.
text: Carter sees the Tower Gunner facing the other way--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Cover.
text: --and races for the worship house. Powell lays cover fire.
scene_heading: INT. TRIBAL WORSHIP HOUSE
text: BOOM! Carter blows through the door, picking off two REBEL
text: OFFICERS before they can fire back. The building has been
text: converted into a rebel command post. A SENIOR OFFICER starts
text: FIRING, as Carter dives for cover--
text: --falling amidst MAPS, CHARTS and SOIL SAMPLES. Massive mounds
text: of DIRT and CRUSHED ROCK fall around him. Geological testing
text: EQUIPMENT tumbles off tables as GUNFIRE rings out.
text: Carter braces for a shot -- and now sees the SENIOR OFFICER has
text: his gun to the head of a FEMALE VILLAGER, bound in an
text: interrogation chair. The officer SHOUTS threats--—
text: --and Carter doesn’t hesitate. BAM!
dialog: be theese
text: His shot kills the Officer.
text: Carter springs to the ladder-stairs to the Tower and climbs up
text: behind the Machine Gunner, levelling his rifle--
text: --as the Machine Gunner whirls on him and OPENS FIRE--
text: --just as Carter DROPS back through the trap door, landing hard.
text: The Hulking Gunner abandons his post and LEAPS through the door
text: in pursuit. With a huge machete--
text: --and CRASH! Carter blocks the machete strike with his rifle,
text: wielding it like a two-handed sword. The Gunner CLASHFS again
text: and Carter parries. The huge rebel drives Carter back, SLASHING
dialog: madly--
text: --and KNOCKING the gun from Carter’s hands. Carter hits the
text: deck. The Gunner plants a BOOT on his neck just as Carter goes
text: for his ankle-holstered pistol--
text: --and the machete comes down just as the pistol goes up--
text: --and BAM! The Gunner falls. Sideways.
text: Carter looks to see Powell in the doorway, rifle smoking. They
text: both catch their breath, exhausted...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I had him.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Whatever you say.
dialog: 5.
text: The sounds of GUNFIRE fade, replaced by SHOUTS of “All Secure.”
text: Their unit's taken the village. They swiftly free the bonds of
text: the female prisoner-- A ranger arrives on the scene.
speaker_heading: RANGER
dialog: The village has been taken. All
text: civilians are safe and secure in the
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: Help her to the others.
text: The Ranger escorts the Woman out. Carter picks up MAPS from the
text: scattered rock samples and equipment...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Well, they were up here looking for
dialog: rocks, all right.
speaker_heading: POWELL (0.S.)
dialog: (a strange tone)
dialog: Yeah. Yeah they were.
dialog: 4
text: And Carter turns to see what Powell’s staring at...
text: On the tribal altar, there’s a SUNDIAL-shaped totem made of
text: baked red clay...with six gem-sized indentations in it -- empty -
text: - encircling a larger center indentation.
text: It is filled with an INCANDESCENT FIRE-RED GEMSTONE, which seems
text: lit from within by an otherworldly glow. The gem absolutely
dialog: takes their breath away.
text: And off their looks of pure amazement...
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE SCHOOL - DAY
text: ARMY RANGERS cut the locks on the doors--
text: ~-as IMPRISONED VILLAGERS spill out, bound and blindfolded. The
text: soldiers free their bonds and the villagers embrace them--
text: --as Carter and Powell watch from the worship house door. The
text: CIA Man arrives, storming right past them--
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: It’s in there, Spooky.
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE CLEARING - DAY - LATER
text: The rain has stopped as HELICOPTERS set down, bringing support
text: personnel...and more INTELLIGENCE OPERATIVES, who are rushed
text: toward the worship house by the CIA Man.
text: At the village's edge, Carter and Powell sit, scraping mud from
text: their boots, looking like hell...
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: I'm gonna miss saving your life, you
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Won't miss saving yours.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: We get home, we're gonna change our
dialog: minds. We'll take two weeks and want
dialog: to be right back in it.
text: Carter smiles. Shakes his head.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: What about the private security work?
dialog: You still thinking about it? Us ex-
dialog: Dev Group guys can make a lot of money.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I'm tired of killing.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: But you're so good at it.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Ironic. Isn't it?
text: Another Ranger voice CRACKLES over Powell’‘s radio--
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Gold Team -- South Perimeter -- please
dialog: report.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: We got jungle and more jungle. Anybody
dialog: needs some, send ‘em on over.
text: He clicks off. Carter still surveys the jungle...
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: I'm just trying to picture you -- back
dialog: there in the Blue Ridge, building your
text: little house on a hill without a war to
dialog: fight.
text: Carter smiles.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I‘11 send you a postcard.
text: And suddenly a RUSTLING in the jungle springs them to their
text: feet! Their rifles are ready, instantly on alert...
text: ..-and then Carter, scanning the trees, spots A PAIR OF EYES
text: amidst jungle foliage.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Ten o'clock!
text: A DARK FIGURE takes off running -- just as Carter sights his
text: rifle. Carter and Powell leap into action!
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Go, go, go!
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE
text: The two soldiers CRASH through the underbrush, giving chase--
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: We‘ve got a rebel on the south
dialog: perimeter! We're in pursuit!
text: --as they SMASH through huge leaves and dangling vines, as the
text: fleeing FIGURE stays far ahead of them, visible only as a
text: DISTURBANCE in the overgrown jungle.
scene_heading: EXT. DEEPER JUNGLE
text: Carter and Powell LEAP a stream, as more LIZARDS watch--
text: --and keep CRASHING through dense jungle, running hard and
text: blind, finally bursting through into a--
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING
text: Where a few VINES hang down, just overhead, from high trees.
text: They catch their breath, listening for movement--
text: --and then see a RUSTLING in the jungle ahead. Then several
text: yards further. And further still. Powell starts for it--
dialog: 8.
text: --but Carter grabs his arm. Powell frowns. Carter points to
text: the vine right beside his head. It’s swaying gently, while the
text: rest of the vines are not.
text: Together, they grip their rifles...and snap them upward--
text: TO SEE A YOUNG AFRICAN BOY
text: Clutching the vine twenty feet above them. He wears a satchel
text: and has a handful of stones he's been throwing. Surprised, the
text: two friends hold their fire...
speaker_heading: CARTER .
dialog: (in broken dialect)
dialog: Climb down, we won't hurt you. We're
dialog: not with the rebels.
text: But the Boy remains clinging, scared. Powell’s had enough--
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: The hell with this.
text: --as he raises his rifle and FIRES -- snapping the vine! --
text: --and sending the AFRICAN BOY tumbling twenty feet to the mud.
text: He lands on his butt, as his satchel spills open and--
scene_heading: SIX MORE INCANDESCENT RED “FIRE-GEMS”
text: Fall out, GLOWING MAGICALLY as if from within. Carter and
text: Powell's eyes go wide. The Boy gasps, then scrambles to reclaim
text: them...but Powell keeps him at bay...
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Carter...?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yeah. I see ‘em.
text: Carter picks up the glowing stones, with wonderment...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Your village...did they tell you to
dialog: hide these? From the rebels? How long
dialog: have you been out here hiding?
text: The Boy trembles. He looks like he hasn't eaten in weeks. So
text: Carter trades a look with Powell...and puts the stones back in
text: the boy’s satchel.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I want you to take these back to your
dialog: people. Don't let our soldiers see
dialog: them. They belong to you.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Carter, what are you doing?
text: Carter hands the grateful boy the satchel.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Now I want you to tell me something.
text: The Boy nods.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Those rocks. Do you know where your
dialog: village found them?
dialog: Another nod.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN OVERLOOK - DAY
text: Carter, Powell and the Boy push through the foliage to emerge at
text: an overlook -- with a view of e lush MOUNTAIN RANGE rising into
text: the clouds. Near'*the base, a JAGGED CREVASSE cuts into the
text: range like a deep, black scar.
text: The Boy is happily devouring a Baby Ruth candy bar as he points
text: to the canyon and speaks a single African word.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: He says “the cave.”
text: He raises binocs, intrigued. Powell consults a map:
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Whatcha got on that crevasse?
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: It's not here. It’s not charted.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: There was an earthquake around here a
dialog: year ago. Could’ve opened it up.
text: They trade a long look...as their radios CRACKLE:
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Base to Gold Team, base to Gold
dialog: Team...report on pursuit.
text: Carter raises his radio...until Powell takes it away:
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Uh, yeah, we lost that rebel...still
dialog: out here searching.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: POWELL (cont'd)
dialog: Might've found their supply route,
dialog: though. Gonna have a look. May take
dialog: some time.
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Copy that. Good luck, Gold Team.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Thanks. We'll need it.
text: Powell clicks off..-.and meets Carter's gaze...
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - EDGE OF CREVASSE - DAY
dialog: 10.
text: Carter and Powell trek toward the crevasse, hacking jungle:
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: We're taking a look, right? A look.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: That is the mission.
speaker_heading: " CARTER
dialog: We take a gem, it’s a court-martial.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: We take one, we take ten, I know.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: We don’t even know what they’re worth--
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Besides killing for.
text: Suddenly, the narrow CREVASSE opens up before them.
text: ominous ribbon, a crack in the earth. Depth unknown.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: We’ve been doing this for fifteen
dialog: years. For who, our country? No. NSA,
dialog: CIA, guys like Spooky. Their wars,
dialog: their agendas. What are we leaving
dialog: this Army with?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: We're alive. There's that.
text: Powell studies the dark abyss, with a measured tone:
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: You ever seen gems like that? How much
dialog: land in the Blue Ridge you think one of
dialog: them buys? Forget private security
dialog: work. A few of those rocks and we
dialog: never have to kill anyone ever again.
dialog: A dark
dialog: ll.
text: Carter weighs this. Powell pushes the moment.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: We've been best friends for fifteen
dialog: years right?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: More or less.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: How many times before this have I asked
dialog: you to break the rules?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I‘ve lost count.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: So what's one more?
text: Carter laughs. Powell holds a hopeful stare.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Alright, but after we find the stones
dialog: we're going to turn them over to the
dialog: brass.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: After I put a few aside for my old age.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That’s between you and your court-
dialog: martial tribunal.
scene_heading: INT. JUNGLE CREVASSE
text: Powell DESCENDS on a rope line, lowered by Carter. He feels his
text: way down jagged walls, scanning a light across the walls - -
text: spotting flecks of worthless QUARTZ and MICA.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Lots of rocks -- no pretty redheads!
speaker_heading: CARTER (0.S.)
dialog: How far down you figure?
text: Powell scans with his light. Still only blackness.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Good goddamn question. More rope?!
text: Fifty feet above him, a silhouetted Carter shakes his head. Just
text: below, Powell now spots a series of LEDGES, like a natural
text: staircase. He starts swinging himself--
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: There's some ledges here, I think I can
dialog: get a little deeper--
text: --and as he swings, the rope FRAYS against some rock...but
text: Powell grabs hold in time. He perches on a ledge--
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Okay, I'm gonna unhook--
text: --and as he unclips from the rope line, the ledge CRUMBLES!
text: Powell flails and tumbles, plummeting into darkness! His
text: TERRIFYING YELL echoes -- and then abruptly cuts silent.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Powell?! POWELL!!!
dialog: No response.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE
text: Carter tears back into the foliage, SLASHING at long,’ sturdy
text: vines...and hustling to tie their ends together...
scene_heading: EXT. EDGE OF CREVASSE
text: With the vines secured to a tree, Carter takes a knife and
text: carves a STAR AND TWO STRIPES symbol into the tree. Then he
text: backs to the edge of the crevasse. His FLASHLIGHT is taped to
text: his belt, aimed downward. He takes a deep breath--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I‘m coming for you.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN OVERLOOK
text: Far away, Carter disappears into the crevasse. Watching him is
text: the African Boy..-.wearing an enigmatic stare:
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Goodbye, soldier.
text: He crunches another bite of Baby Ruth. And he’s gone.
scene_heading: INT. CREVASSE
text: Carter rappels through the opening, navigating far past the
text: crumbling ledges and the end of Powell's rope--
text: --and then his light finds the bottom of the crevasse. With the
text: broken end of Powell’s rope. And traces of BLOOD.
dialog: 13.
text: Carter scrambles to the end of his vines...and drops six feet to
text: the crevasse floor. He scans his light...following drops of
text: blood...to the dark, jagged mouth of a CAVE.
scene_heading: INT. CREVASSE CAVE
text: Carter wanders through the pitch darkness--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Powell?! Can you hear me?
text: There's no reply. But his light illuminates STRANGE MARKINGS on
text: the walls -- characters, shapes and symbols in an unknown
text: language. Intrigued, Carter edges deeper-~-
text: --and now his LIGHT picks up a GLINT OF RED. He stops still.
text: Ahead, through an archway, he sees twinkling RED LIGHTS --
text: dozens of them -- like constellations in the sky.
text: He stumbles closer, passing through the archway into--
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND CATHEDRAL
text: A massive chamber, a domed room thirty feet high with thousands
text: of mystical RED FIRE-GEM CRYSTALS in the walls.
text: More MARKINGS, coordinates in an unknown language, are carved in
text: bas-relief all around the base of the chamber. The room was
text: clearly built by an intelligence...but whose?
text: Carter marvels, circling the room. He runs his hands across the
text: fire-gems. They shimmer BRIGHTER to his touch.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What is this...?
text: Then, Carter spots something in the middle of the room. A
text: SUNDIAL-type marking in the ground. Like a compass charting
text: both time and space. And as he edges closer--~
text: --he kneels to examine it, seeing a large DIAMOND-like stone in
text: the center, reflecting infinite facets. And as he just barely
text: touches it with one of his hands--
text: THE ENTIRE CHAMBER RUMBLES WITH ENERGY
text: As if ACTIVATED. The “sundial” Carter’s kneeling on LOWERS
text: abruptly into the ground, causing a WHITE GLOW to spill out. on
text: instinct, Carter scrambles aside--
text: --and sees the canopy of FIRE-GEMS GLOW BRIGHTER, as if
text: instantly charged. They CRACKLE with energy, as the HUM grows
text: deafening, and RED BEAMS of ENERGY “connect” linking all the
dialog: erystals in a spiderweb network--
dialog: 14.
text: Carter's astonished...as a SWIRLING WIND begins to build, and
text: the FIRE-GEMS glow hotter, illuminating PREHISTORIC FOSSILS in
text: the walls, embedded DINOSAURS and MASTODONS--~-
text: --while the dinosaur and mastodon fossils GROW SKIN AND PELTS
text: and suddenly COME TO LIFE, as meanwhile the cavern ceiling
text: SPLITS APART to reveal the night sky high above--
text: --and the HUM grows deafening and the GLOW blinding and the wind
text: now SPINNING at impossible speed as Carter sees--
text: TIME MOVING BACKWARDS ALL AROUND HIM
text: As the rock above him retracts and the DINOSAURS clamber
text: backwards from their eternal resting places and Carter's
text: buffeted body shakes as if it's being ripped apart--
text: --in the maelstrom of sound and light and time which cascades
text: into a sudden SONIC BOOM!
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - PREHISTORIC ERA - NIGHT
text: In a distant angle, DINOSAURS watch as a PILLAR OF RED-HOT LIGHT
text: fires straight up into the universe beyond.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY
text: Amidst a low blanket of reeds and tall grasses, RED ENERGY
text: CRACKLES and SPARKS. Angle rises to reveal a circle of
text: flattened, burned grasses...with John Carter, unconscious,
text: scorched and battered, at its center.
text: Carter struggles up. Disoriented and nauseous. Confused to see
text: he‘s no longer in the crevasse cave.
text: He's surrounded by strange foliage -- blacks, browns and
text: Silvers. Arid and harsh. A jungle, yes, but nothing like the
text: one he was in. There’s a craggy tree canopy overhead. Unnatural
text: insect chattering and faint avian calls.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Powell?! POWELL!!!
text: He grabs his equipment belt, checks his compass. Its needle is
text: SPINNING wildly. His GPS readout is blank.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: Gold Team to base. This is Carter to
dialog: base, do you read me? I've lost a fix
dialog: on my position.
dialog: 15.
text: His radio CRACKLES and HISSES with static. And then he hears a
text: different CLICK-HISSSS. CLICK-HISSSSS. An insect-like purr very
text: near his right ear.
text: He turns, careful and slow...and sees a BABY MALAGOR perched on
text: a reed only inches from his cheek. Like a tiny four- winged
text: pterodactyl. It cocks its head, curious. Even cute.
text: --as the Baby Malagor BARES TERRIFYING FANGS and HISSES--
text: --and Carter RECOILS, instantly disappearing from frame--
text: AND SLAMS BACKWARDS AGAINST A TREE TRUNK
text: Eyes shut, Carter winces, rubbing his skull. Back to the tree,
text: he lifts his head to see--
text: THAT HE‘S FIFTEEN FEET OFF THE GROUND
text: Straddling a large branch, with the ground far below him. The
text: Baby Malagor hasn't moved. But it’s twenty feet away.
text: Carter blinks, confused.
text: He swings a leg over the branch and lowers himself, dangling for
text: a moment, then dropping carefully to the ground.
text: He looks upward at the tree branch, fifteen feet up. Testing
text: the thought, he crouches low...and then leaps.
text: AND SKYROCKETS WAY PAST THE BRANCH
text: Shooting far higher -- twenty, thirty, forty feet -- CRASHING
text: through branches and flailing for purchase. Finally, he grabs
text: hold of one. Dangling, he looks down--
text: --and sees the tiny Baby Malagor still observing. Intrigued.
text: Carter drops from the tree, his hands trembling. He crouches,
text: grasping the ground as if afraid to let go.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What happened to gravity?
text: Chancing it, Carter slowly rises back to his full height.
text: Nothing happens. He surveys the terrain...
scene_heading: EXT. EDGE OF FOREST - MOMENTS LATER
text: Carter comes SOARING from the forest canopy, arcing groundward
text: to land in a crouch. He's breathing hard, gauging the distance
dialog: he just leaped...
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: What happened to me...?
text: He rises to face a rising rock slope. He picks up a large shard
text: of black rock, testing its weight. To his amazement, he’s able
dialog: to toss it easily in his hand--
text: --and then he wheels and hurls it like a discus, watching it
text: PIROUETTE high over the rise and out of sight. Somewhere
text: distant, there’s a creature’s throaty CALL of dismay.
text: And off Carter's stunned reaction...
text: A MASSIVE HERD OF FLYING MALAGORS
text: comes SOARING over the rise, dozens of them, riding the winds
text: like four-winged dragons. Carter dives for hiding as they soar
text: over the trees...where the Baby Malagor gives Carter one last
text: HISS and ascends to join his family.
text: Carter blinks. He can’t believe his eyes as he marches to the
text: edge of the rise for a vantage of--
scene_heading: A SWEEPING MARTIAN LANDSCAPE
text: Like an African savanna, with a shallow marshy pond below which
text: teems with a panoply of MARTIAN WILDLIFE. Bizarre desert
dialog: predators the size of dinosaurs...
text: ...and all framed against a STARSCAPE backdrop, with the nearest
text: planet rising prominently...a familiar ringed planet fills the
dialog: sky.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: I‘m dead... have to be...
text: Above a nearby rock outcrop, he can see the top of a TALL STONE
text: TOWER. It looks man-made. His eyes narrow...
scene_heading: EXT. ROCK OUTCROP - DAY
text: Staying out of sight of the watering hole predators, Carter
text: scales the rocks for a view of what’s beyond...
text: -.. and sees a great DOMED STRUCTURE built into the hillside,
text: with a glistening egg-shaped dome. Its incongruity in the
text: landscape and softness of its lines suggest that it was designed
dialog: and built.
dialog: 17.
scene_heading: EXT. INCUBATOR - DAY
text: Carter jumps to a spire and looks down upon the dome... Through
text: a thick, curved, transparent roof, he sees HUNDREDS OF EGGS four
text: feet high, three feet in diameter, with a leathery white shell.
text: Sunlight is refracted through the dome and grows with intensity,
text: providing heat. The building’s purpose is clear - it is an
scene_heading: INCUBATOR.
text: --And guarding the entrance are two CALOTS - formidable,
text: ferocious creatures about six feet long, as thick as a rhino,
text: with ten stubby legs, frog-like heads with three rows of teeth,
text: and tusks jutting from wide jaws. One might think of an
text: ugly/cute English Bulldog when looking at them, but one calot
dialog: could eat five Earth dogs for breakfast.
text: Carter hears a GROWL. Turning, he comes face-to-face with a
text: THIRD CALOT (whom he will later name WOOLA). Stouter than the
text: others, with an endearing patch of color around one eye, it
text: regards Carter with curiosity...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Easy boy...
text: Woola GROWLS a low woola-woola-woola, and edges a step forward,
text: his eyes flaring with alarm..
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: ...I’'m not going to hurt you...
text: .+..as a HUGE SHADOW falls over both Carter and Woola, and Carter
text: realizes that’s what the beast was growling at. Carter swallows
text: hard...and swiftly spins--
text: TO SEE A TWENTY-FOOT TALL WHITE APE
text: SHATTERING two RIGHT FISTS through the glass of the incubator
text: dome, CLAWS OPENING to snatch its newfound prey--
text: --just as Carter dives aside, and scrambles up -- only to get
text: BASHED by a hulking hairy forearm as it swings back, sending him
text: COLLIDING through the incubator’s wall -- back outside.
text: The maniacal creature has two legs, four arms and a head like a
text: gorilla’s. Its claws SMASH into two of the eggs instead,
text: hauling out TWO STICKY GREEN FETAL CREATURES. The mucous-
text: covered, four-armed blind babies WRITHE and SQUEAL--
text: --as the White Ape devours them whole, gnashing jaws, slurping
text: and swallowing...and then turns Carter’s way.
dialog: 18.
scene_heading: EXT. INCUBATOR
text: Carter grabs his pistol and OPENS FIRE. The bullets pepper the
text: Ape’s chest like BB’s. Completely harmless.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Not good--
text: He scrambles, colliding with one of the dead calots. The
text: animal's ribcage is exposed -- and Carter's able to snap off a
dialog: scimitar-like RIB for a weapon--
text: --just as the White Ape LUNGES for him, landing on its mid-
text: limbs and flashing out its upper claws--
text: --and Carter LEAPS straight up, just missing its grasp, to a
text: perch on the side of the dome. Surprised, the Ape turns--
text: ~-just as Carter takes a desperate jump -- right at it,
text: EMBEDDING the rib in its neck as Carter sails past its shoulder
text: and lands hard in the dirt, tumbling to a stop. The Ape HOWLS
text: MADLY, staggered but not killed--
text: --and LEAPS again out of the enraged animal's grasp, landing
text: atop the rock outcrop and racing over its summit--~
text: JUST AS A SECOND WHITE APE RISES
text: into view to cut him off! Even larger and more savage than the
text: first, it BACKHANDS two arms before Carter can react--
text: --swatting him like a fly to SMASH HIM BACK THROUGH THE DOME--
scene_heading: INT. INCUBATOR
text: --and crash-land among the eggs. A human throw toy. In agony,
text: Carter rolls onto his back. To see Woola the calot lying next
text: to him, with ugly but sympathetic eyes.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You take the big one--
text: As SMASH! The larger Male Ape LUMBERS through the destroyed
text: entry. The Female Ape LIMPS to his side, with the calot-rib
text: still stuck in her neck. They thrash the grasses as Carter and
text: Woola both scamper for better cover--
text: The Female Ape SCOOPS up an egg, bites off the top and sucks out
text: the fetal creature inside. She then CRUSHES the eggshell and
text: HURLS it at Carter, knocking him down--
text: --and allowing the Male to GRAB him! The Male raises him high
text: in the air, opening his savage JAWS wide, ready to thrust him
text: down his gullet--
dialog: 19.
text: WHEN WOOLA CHARGES INTO VIEW
text: Taking a flying leap at the Ape‘s legs, SINKING jaws in and
text: wrenching a leg out from under. The Male buckles, loosening his
text: grip -- and allowing Carter to tumble free.
text: Trapped between them, Carter sees the Female blocks the exit.
text: Carter glances to the roof, then steels his gaze--
text: And races at the Female. She drops low, ready for his charge --
text: until he plants off an egg and LEAPS skyward!
text: Soaring straight up to the dome’s roof, where he hangs onto a
text: broken girder with one hand, dangling right above her wide- open
dialog: gnashing jaws--
text: Carter hangs on by one hand, about to fall to his doom...and now
text: opens the other hand...to reveal a CONCUSSION GRENADE.
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: Compliments of the U.S. Army.
text: And lets it drop. Right down the ape’s throat.
text: The ape ROARS...and then gets silenced as the grenade DETONATES,
text: ravaging the ape with internal injuries from its concussive
text: force! The beast topples to ground, dead.
text: Carter falls -- but lands safely in the silvergrass. The Male
text: Ape BELLOWS mournfully, HURLING Woola at Carter. With a
text: thundering run, he blocks any other escape. They’re done for.
text: He BEATS his chest, and now CHARGES!--
scene_heading: AS SUDDENLY HIS TORSO ERUPTS
text: With black blood and a GREEN FLASH, as if EXPLODING from within!
text: The Ape staggers...and then topples, revealing--
text: TWELVE SILHOUETTED RIDERS ON THE ROCKS BEYOND
text: Like a military platoon, except the silhouettes aren’t human.
text: They are THARKS, twelve feet tall and four~armed green warriors,
text: adorned in armor and battlements, riding THOATS, great part-
dialog: horse/part-rhino cavalry animals.
text: One among them holds a SMOKING RADIUM RIFLE. His gun gives a
text: steady, “recharging” whine. The rest await this leader’s
text: command. He is GENERAL TARS TARKAS.
text: The riders descend the rocks, approaching. Twin tusks curve
text: upward from their jawbones. Hairless heads, menacing faces,
text: armed to the teeth with spears, swords and rifles.
dialog: 20.
text: Carter tenses -- he drops his “knife” and opens his hands to
dialog: show he means no harm.
text: The Tharks (among them savage, scar-faced LIEUTENANT VAXX) all
text: look to TARS TARKAS, the leader, awaiting an order. Tars
text: motions for all to lower their guns.
speaker_heading: VAXX
dialog: (to Tars, gesturing
dialog: angrily)
dialog: Loquesh va baresh! Baresh ku tain!
text: Tars holds him with a steely look. Vaxx falls silent. Carter
text: keeps a surrendering pose, but addresses Tars:
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: My name is John Carter. Do you
dialog: understand me?
text: Tars betrays nothing.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I’m not your enemy? I’m lost. I’m
text: trying to find a friend.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: (intrigued)
dialog: Friend.
text: Carter nods, warily relaxes. Tars lowers his rifle. And then
text: points to his own armor:
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Thark.
text: Curious, Tars dismounts and notes the smashed incubator wall,
text: the destroyed eggs, the two dead calots, and the wounded third.
text: He picks up the blade fashioned from the rib, points at the
text: white ape, and asks Carter...
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Baresh?! Baresh ku tain?
text: Getting the gist of the question, Carter nods in the
text: affirmative, but moves to the wounded Woola and adds...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: They attacked us. We were able to kill
dialog: one.
text: Upon hearing Carter’s English, the Tharks look befuddled. Armor
text: clanks as Tars raises a single finger...and presses it to
text: Carter's chest. A testing touch.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That‘’s right. Him and me.
text: Tars nods, with some amusement, then strides past Carter and
text: examines the calot’s wound, calling to Vaxx who THROWS A SPEAR
text: at Woola! A shocked Carter SPRINGS in the air and SNATCHES it,
text: saving the calot’s life.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No! He saved my life.
text: The Tharks don’t know what to make of Carter’s leap! An audible
text: sound is heard as they look on in awe. TWO see it as an act of
text: aggression, LAUNCH spears at him, and Carter VAULTS to a rock,
text: avoiding both projectiles.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
speaker_heading: SHENN!
text: Heeding Tars‘s order, the warriors sheath weapons. Carter nods
text: his thanks and returns to Woola...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: These boys think you're done for. You
dialog: want to live? Move.
text: The calot “smiles” and gets to its feet. Carter looks to
text: fars... The Thark nods - Woola will be spared.
text: Tars Tarkas remains impossible to read...but something akin to a
text: smile crosses his face...and he finally signals sharply. With a
text: thunder of armor, all Tharks DISMOUNT at once.
text: Vaxx curses, lowering his weapons, with vengeful eyes directed
text: Carter‘’s way. And when Tars turns his back, Vaxx kicks Woola --
text: sent tumbling across the dust.
scene_heading: EXT. INCUBATOR/ROAD - DAY
text: The Apes’ bodies BURN and their PELTS are loaded onto thoats,
text: while Tharks are busy repairing the shattered dome.
text: A stunned Carter sits prisoner, hands and feet bound by CHAINS.
text: Woola’s beside him, looking forlorn. They watch Tars marching
text: the scene, commanding his soldiers--
text: --as Carter’s radio, on the ground beside him, suddenly SQUAWKS
text: with the sound of GUNFIRE and LASER FIRE, as if tuning in an
dialog: interstellar war.
dialog: 22.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY
text: A DOZEN THARK EGGS hang from baskets and braces, carried by pack
text: Thoats...as Tars Tarkas and his Thark platoon trek across a
text: seemingly endless hostile landscape.
text: Amidst the caravan expedition, Carter sits bound atop a thoat --
text: a prisoner. His tired, ragged face looks toward the
text: horizon...and his eyes widen, at what seems like a mirage...
text: For from the infinite desert rises a massive METROPOLIS...
scene_heading: EXT. THE CITY OF THARK - DAY
text: Nestled in the deep recesses of a dry sea bed lies a crumbling
text: DOMED city, looming over the tiny riders. Perched on high are
text: more MALAGORS. Two launch and SWOOP over the caravan, helmed by
text: THARK RIDERS in cockpit harnesses.
text: Tars gestures a signal and the Malagors return to the city,
text: SCREECHING an announcement. Soon, TRUMPETS sound and a huge
text: ENTRY GATE is opened.’..two massive iron doors hauled apart by
text: lumbering mastodon-sized ZITIDARS...
text: An overwhelmed Carter cannot believe what he's seeing.-. This
text: is like watching a fairy tale come to life... Vaxx kicks Carter
text: forward, snapping him back to “reality.”
scene_heading: EXT. INNER THARK - DAY
text: The caravan rides into a dense warren of reclaimed buildings and
text: sandstone streets, bustling with THARKS. Thousands of them.
text: Citizens BOW at the sight of Tars and his warriors, who are the
text: elite of Thark’s military. And they CHEER at the sight of the
dialog: eggs.
text: Tars Tarkas subtly raises a hand to acknowledge the crowd's
text: acclaim. A murmur then ripples, as Tharks spot Carter --
text: regarding him with curiosity and scorn. He can only look on,
dialog: with a mind that’s been completely blown...
scene_heading: EXT. THARK PALACE - DAY
text: In the city center, a bombed-out cathedral-like building towers
text: over the rest. Once an architectural wonder, now a
text: deteriorating monument to war.
text: At the caravan’s fore, Tars Tarkas exchange salutes -- the
text: crossing of mid-limbs -- with four PALACE GUARDS.
dialog: 23.
scene_heading: INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY
text: A grotesque Thark in a chain-mail cloak, TAL HAJUS, stands on a
text: dais with three THARK ELDERS and his assassin mistress, SARKOJA,
text: a lovely serpent of a Thark.
text: Hajus spits venom, scrawling lines of troop movement on a map
text: (with three of his hands at once). Doors THUNDER open--
text: --as Tars Tarkas enters, with his senior officers (Vaxx and
text: Jakkal). The room was once a great library or museum left by
text: whatever ancient race built the city. Overturned shelves,
text: tables and books litter the floor.
text: Tal Hajus ROARS, angered by the interruption.
text: Tars hurls the APE HEADS at Hajus’ feet. Hajus quiets. Tars
text: calmly drops to a knee. The other Tharks do the same.
text: Hajus frowns at the sight of the pale human, still standing.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: (to Carter, a command)
dialog: Sakk.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I don't understand-- I don’t know what
dialog: you want.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Sakk.
text: Tars points to the ceiling. Carter still hesitates. So Tars
text: motions to his officers, who draw SWORDS and attack him--
text: --giving him no choice but to LEAP right over them, to a high
text: perch above the doorway! Tars BARKS another command. His
text: officers HURL their pikes. Carter evades, GAMBOLING from one
text: wall to another, flying over their heads. Tars BARKS another
text: command. The officers stop. Tars smiles, looks to Hajus. He
text: can’t help but be impressed.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Sakk.
text: He motions for Carter to come down. Carter does, warily.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: My name’s John Carter, from America.
text: Tars Tarkas and Tal Hajus trade a stare.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Mak jeddak. Lo Jonn-kata. Thark?
dialog: 24.
text: Hajus eyes Carter carefully, then sneers a dismissive hand:
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: Thark.
text: BOOM! Palace GUARDS grab Carter, marching him brusquely from
dialog: the room. And, he believes, to his execution...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Listen to me! I’m looking for a
dialog: friend. You’re not my enemy, I mean
dialog: you no harm. :
text: ...and as he resists, the guards BLINDFOLD him and hold him
text: fast...and finally head-butt him into submission. As his entire
text: world GOES DARK.
scene_heading: INT. SANDSTONE QUARTERS - NIGHT
text: Carter’s eyes snap open as he bolts up in bed -- a stack of hay-
text: covered burlap, surrounded by chain-mail netting. He's been
text: stripped to his army shorts.
text: But he's alive.
text: The room glows with FIRELIGHT. He sees his washed clothes
text: hanging from a line. He sees a meal left on a table. And he
text: hears a throaty PURRING. Woola-woola-woola...
text: Carter turns to see Woola guarding the door, licking his wounds.
text: Carter’s eyes narrow...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Woola-woola-woola to you too.
text: He hears RADIO STATIC from behind him. He spins to see an
text: antechamber, where a lithe female Thark, SOLA, sits on the
text: floor, exploring Carter’s military gear: dog tags, compass,
text: concussion grenade. She's fiddling with his radio--
speaker_heading: CARTER .
dialog: Hey! That‘s mine! Hey!
text: --he runs over and she springs back, clutching the radio. He
dialog: tries to guard the rest of it--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Get out of here! Go! Mine!
text: --but she bows repeatedly, submissive. He now sees a washbasin
text: and a cookpit in her room. And now realizes.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You did all this. For me.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: Sola.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Sola.
text: Sola smiles. In her hands, the radio SQUAWKS to life with
text: inhuman cries and explosions. The sounds of battle. She puts
text: it to her ear. Carter‘s eyes widen--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What is that?! What are we hearing?
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: Zodanga. Lok Helium. Dak kavall.
text: She sees he doesn’t understand. So she leads him to a balcony,
text: stepping out to overlook--
scene_heading: TEE ENTIRE CITY OF THARK
text: the broken-domed city teeming with six-limbed, green-skinned
text: THARK behemoths. Bustling and training, marching in military
text: formation by torchlight. But Sola points to the horizon--
text: --where it GLOWS with FLICKERS of light, abrupt and sudden,
text: fireworks from a distant battle. Tiny TRACER LIGHTS are visible
text: -- some kind of airships. The FLASH-GLOW moves in concert with
text: what Carter’s radio is tuning in--
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: Dak kavall, she said. Dak kavall.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The war.
scene_heading: INT. CARTER'S QUARTERS - CLOSE ON NOTEBOOK - NIGHT
text: Carter's sandy, bloodstained hands open a tiny military journal
dialog: and start to write...”My name is Captain John Carter, Dev Group,
dialog: United States Army. I ama prisoner of war...”
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: It was incredible. It was impossible.
dialog: Somehow I had traveled millions of
dialog: miles through space, and infinite years
dialog: through time...and yet war remained.
dialog: Here. Everywhere. War.
text: ANGLE WIDENS to reveal Carter, writing by firelight. Sola is

dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.0O.)
dialog: From that, there was no escape.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF THARK - DAY - BEGIN EXTENDED MONTAGE
text: Carter emerges, followed by Sola and Woola. He wears his own
text: clothes, but with Thark touches: a makeshift armored
text: breastplate and Thark DAGGER (which on him, seems a sword). He
text: attracts the stare of all THARKS passing by...
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.0O.)
dialog: The sight of Earth in the sky meant I
dialog: was still in the same solar system. The
dialog: red dust, the presence of water... to
dialog: me, that meant Mars... or as Sola
dialog: called it, Barsoom. And as for the
dialog: Martians...Thark was the name -- for
dialog: their people, their city, and as I came
dialog: to soon realize...for me.
scene_heading: EXT. THARK PLAZA -— DAY
text: Carter and Sola join a CROWD at some kind of public ceremony.
text: The dozen EGGS that were retrieved from the Incubator sit on a
text: dais, with necklaces of GREEN FIRE-GEMS draped across them. As
text: the crystals start to GLOW...
text: ...the eggs crack open, and mewling THARK BABIES emerge,
text: clambering out, sticky and new. The Thark Crowd ROARS,
text: thrusting pikes and swords high. Carter stares, stunned...
text: ...for as the Babies first rise to stand, they are handed SWORDS
text: and PIKES of their own. Each then follows a MENTOR THARK off to
text: a distant “training ground”...
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: This wasn’t a society, it was a
dialog: militia. The males, females and
dialog: children alike. And the general who'd
dialog: spared my life...wanted me to be a part
dialog: of it.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAINING GROUND - DAY
text: Tars Tarkas stands watching with his senior OFFICERS, as the
text: Thark Babies are taught to fight by their Mentors...
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.0.)
dialog: His name was Tars Tarkas. The rest
dialog: feared him and obeyed him. To him, I
dialog: was some kind of prize.
dialog: 27.
text: +++a€S ANGLE TRACKS the row to find Carter at the end, holding
text: two pikes and learning to defend himself...from Sola.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: The strength and agility I now
dialog: possessed had worth to him in battle.
dialog: It was all these creatures valued. It’s
dialog: what they taught their young from the
dialog: moment they were born. Strength.
dialog: Valor. Victory.
text: Carter PARRIES two of Sola’s (half-speed) blows, then HOPS the
text: other two, but her fourth arm HURLS a pike that hits him in mid-
text: air. He hits the dirt hard, armor dinged--
text: --and Sola has a blade to his throat. She shrugs. “Sorry.”
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: Their training was much as mine had
dialog: been. Attempt. Fail. Repeat and repeat
dialog: again until you succeed. Then repeat
dialog: until you excel.
scene_heading: INT. CARTER’S QUARTERS - DAY
text: A SLIMY MARTIAN RODENT is placed before Carter, on a dinner
text: plate with a charcoal stick. He looks repulsed as Sola sits
text: across from him with a plate of her own...
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.0O.)
dialog: The one called Sola remained at my
dialog: side. From her, I began to learn some
dialog: of their language.
text: Carter motions to his mouth, fearing the worst...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Eat?
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: Tog. Jonn-kata toq.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Jonn-kata toq.
text: He lifts the dripping rodent glop and takes a bite. Gray juice
text: dribbles down his chin. He chews grimly.
text: Sola wears an amused look. She takes her charcoal stick and
text: strikes it on the table -- it FLAMES alight. She then skewers
text: her own gray glop with it. Immediately, the meat COOKS FROM
text: WITHIN, roasting to an appetizing smoky brown.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: As the days passed, I tried to find out
dialog: what I could... There would be no help
dialog: in my search for Powell.
scene_heading: INT. CARTER'S QUARTERS - DUSK
text: Carter uses a STONE to draw an etching on the room's wall,
text: trying to depict the crevasse cave for Sola:
speaker_heading: CARTER .
dialog: It was a cave...with ted crystals.
text: Rocks -- like this -- but red. Vekk.
text: Red. With a diamond in the center --
dialog: and when I touched it, it started, all
dialog: the crystals connected...
text: He draws connecting lines between the crystals he’s drawn. Sola
text: (and Woola) watches patiently, trying to follow.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: If it sent me here, it could send me
dialog: back, right? Have you ever seen this?
dialog: A cave like this?
text: Sola shakes her head. Carter looks despondent...
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: She had no knowledge of a way home. Nor
dialog: any knowledge of what had happened to
dialog: Powell. But I would keep looking.
scene_heading: EXT. CARTER’S QUARTERS - BALCONY - NIGHT
text: Carter sits perched upon his balcony’s ledge, watching the far-
text: off GLOW of a firefight beyond the mountains. He has his radio,
text: listening to STATIC and the faint thunder of bombs...
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.0O.)
dialog: And every night, I listened to the
text: sounds of war. There was another
dialog: civilization out there -- one even the
dialog: Tharks were afraid of -- but who they
dialog: were and who they fought remained a
dialog: mystery to me.
scene_heading: EXT. THOAT CORRAL - DAY
text: CRASH! A CHILD WARRIOR hits the ground, gored and bleeding,
text: rolling away from a bucking, gnashing THOAT -- the Tharks’ half-
text: horse/half-rhino, razor-jawed pack animals.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: To the Tharks, I was an alien. An
dialog: oddity, a pet. But the days turned to
dialog: weeks, and all the while, Tars Tarkas
dialog: was watching. Testing...
text: Carter and Sola approach the corral -- enclosed by a fence made
text: of ENERGY BEAMS. Tars Tarkas surveys the training...
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: And I knew my one chance of survival
dialog: here was to master their fighting
dialog: skills...
scene_heading: EXT. THOAT CORRAL ~ MOMENTS LATER
text: An ENERGY GATE retracts with a HUM, allowing a very reluctant
text: Carter to edge in. The simmering thoat SNORTS.
text: But Carter studies the myriad scars on the thoat’s back...and
text: instead unhooks his holster belt. His blades hit the dust. As
text: Sola and other Tharks trade alarmed looks...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Easy girl. I won‘t hurt you.
text: The thoat stamps hooves like a bull, razor-teeth bared. Carter
text: reaches out a gentle hand--
text: --and the thoat CHARGES! Snarling, it lowers its head and
text: COLLIDES with Carter -- who gets plowed backwards across the
text: ground -- toward the ENERGY FENCE! At the last second, he
dialog: manages the leverage to PUSH OFF--
text: --and bolts SKYWARD, doing a single backflip, then plummeting
text: down headfirst just as the thoat REARS UP at the fence--
text: --as Carter LANDS squarely on its back, hanging on! The thoat’s
text: enraged. Tars has seen enough. He BARKS a command to his Thoat
text: Wranglers, who aim HARPOON RIFLES--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: NO!
text: --and wrenches the thoat’s mane to turn her, just as the rifles
text: FIRE! The barbs WHISTLE past, piercing the dirt instead.
text: Carter hangs on, pressed at the thoat’s ear--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Easy now...I won't hurt you...
text: He strokes its flank in a steady rhythm that starts to calm it.
text: The thoat stops bucking, settling down...
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I won't hurt you...
text: ..-till she's finally at rest. Carter rides it over and
text: dismounts, stroking its face. The other Tharks look mystified,
text: but Tars Tarkas sagely nods. Well done.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAINING GROUND - DAY
text: Carter again jousts PIKES with Sola. His hair has grown longer
text: and ragged. And this time he out-duels her...
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: Over time, the walls of my room became
dialog: a comfort. The taste of my rations and
text: the smell of the desert became
dialog: familiar...even the sight of Earth in
dialog: the midnight sky...
text: Carter extends a hand to help Sola up. She seems surprised by
text: the gesture. But takes it.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: And little by little, the language of
dialog: the Tharks...became mine...
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF THARK ~ NIGHT
text: A flurry of activity as five THARK GUARDS race past Carter, Sola
text: and Woola. Shouts and cries of alarm...which we hear Carter
dialog: starting to “process”...
speaker_heading: THARK GUARDS AS AN ECHO (V.O.)
dialog: Lok kalos! Slokell! Munitions house! Intruders!

scene_heading: INT. MUNITIONS WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: Warhoon!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Warhoon? What‘s a Warhoon?
dialog: 31.
text: Suddenly, a BARRAGE OF CROSSBOW BOLTS come whizzing from above,
dialog: killing three of the guards!
text: Carter and Sola spin to see FIVE SHADOWED SIX-LIMBED FIGURES on
text: a ledge, scampering for a high window. Shaped like Tharks but
text: leaner and even meaner. Carter dives for cover--
text: --as more BOLTS come flying. The WARHOON ARCHERS clutch
text: pillaged BUSHELS of weapons on their backs as they flee--
text: --so Carter grabs a RADIUM RIFLE and “charges” it expertly,
text: taking a bead on the stone ledge and FIRING!
text: The ledge disintegrates, as three of the Warhoons FALL. The
text: other two drop their stolen weapons and flee.
scene_heading: EXT. WAREHOUSE ROOF/CITY WALL - NIGHT
text: Carter LEAPS through the window in pursuit and GAMBOLS to the
text: outer city wall...where he sees two Warhoon Shadows slip away
text: into the desert night. He gets off two GREEN RADIUM BLASTS, but
text: they! explode into the sand...
scene_heading: INT. MUNITIONS WARHOUSE
text: Back at the window, Carter sees the Thark Guards FIRE more

text: The Tharks then look to Carter, nodding with respect..
speaker_heading: THARK GUARD AS AN ECHO (V.O.)

text: A CRUDE MAP of the planet is spread upon Carter's bed. He and
text: Sola sit cross-legged before it. She's explaining...
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: Malagors. Zitidars. Calots. Thoats.
dialog: She told me her people lived lifespans
dialog: of centuries. I wondered whether I
dialog: would too. She told me of the Warhoon
dialog: raiders they fought. And of the great
dialog: war beyond the mountains -- between
dialog: kingdoms called Zodanga and Helium.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: : 32.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: And of the fearsome Sab Than, the
dialog: Desert Prophet, the Prince of Zodanga,
dialog: who'd banished the Tharks to this
text: wasteland nearly one hundred years ago.
text: Carter finds his compass, with its lost, spinning needle, and
text: holds it up to the map. Explaining directions on Earth...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And through it all, she was the only
dialog: Thark who ever asked me of my world. It
dialog: was as if she'd given up on her own...
text: Suddenly, there’s a POUNDING at ‘the door. Sola rises, answers
text: it...to find two stern-faced THARK OFFICERS.
text: Her manner turns grave...as she faces Carter:
speaker_heading: SOLA AS AN ECHO (V.0O.)
dialog: Mak tek terra. It is your time.
scene_heading: EXT. THARK PLAZA, ~ DAY
text: Carter's escorted through a crowd -- another ceremonial
text: gathering -- toward the dais. As the way clears...
text: +.-he sees Tars Tarkas waiting for him. With an officer's suit
text: of THARK ARMOR. And off Carter's shocked look...
scene_heading: EXT. THARK PLAZA - MOMENTS LATER
text: +++he WEARS THE ARMOR, standing before the Thark crowd as they
text: ROAR, thrusting pikes and swords high. Like a Knight of the
dialog: Round Table...he's one of them now...
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.0.)
dialog: Within months...I had gained their
dialog: acceptance. Was it months -- has it
dialog: only been months? It is the first
dialog: thing they teach you in the Army. If
dialog: you are captured, learn the ways of
dialog: your enemy. Live as they want you to.
dialog: Win their trust.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: For with that, comes the way to escape.
text: Suddenly, there's a WILD SCREECH from above! All Tharks look up
text: to see a MALAGOR circling and screaming! Two more join it, as
text: their RIDERS shoot RED FLARES into the sky--
text: --as a LOUD KLAXON sounds, a warning cry throughout the city--
text: --as the ceremony falls apart! Tharks hurriedly race through
text: the streets, using mid-limbs as legs to resemble centaurs,
text: armed, armored and ready for--,
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: BATTLE STATIONS!!!
dialog: (Note: From this moment on, we perceive all language on Mars --
dialog: as Carter does -- as dialogue we can understand.)
text: Tars mounts his own thoat and races into the fray. Carter
text: trails Sola, who charges up a PLAZA STAIRCASE to see--
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: Hurry, Jonn-kata! From the skies! We
dialog: are under attack!
scene_heading: EXT. PLAZA LANDING
text: --several THARKS manning positions astride huge RADIUM CANNONS,
text: launchers w/ gunner cockpits. Aiming skyward at--
text: A GARGANTUAN AIRSHIP IN THE CLOUDS
text: Descending from gray cirrus,.:the craft is a half-mile long with
text: an open-deck like a great PIRATE SHIP! A dozen “FIGHTER”
text: ESCORTS zip past it -- as a steady STROBE LIGHT blinks from the
text: ship’s bow. BLACK SMOKE tails from its EIGHTH RAY ENGINES.
dialog: It's badly damaged...
text: -..and in the streets, Tars Tarkas notices. His eyes narrow.
scene_heading: EXT. WAR PALACE COURTYARD
text: KLAXONS and MALAGORS scream on as Tal Hajus marches an outer
text: corridor with COUNCILORS, as Tars finds him--
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: My King! It is a Helium ship! It
dialog: signals for help!
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
text: It is a trap. Fire at will.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: We have not been attacked!
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: General Tarkas. Every second you doubt
text: is a second Tharks die. Turn back the
dialog: assault.
dialog: (with venom)
dialog: Kill everything on that ship.
scene_heading: EXT. SKIES ABOVE CITY
text: On city rooftops, great GREEN BANNERS are snapped open, like
text: signals to the Thark Malagor pilots above--
dialog: 34.
text: --who SOAR INTO BATTLE, gripping their mounted PULSE GUNS as
text: their Malagors SWOOP up to meet the Helium Fighters--
scene_heading: EXT. PLAZA LANDING
text: --while THARK MARKSMEN fire and the main airship is ROCKED!
text: Only now do the Helium forces return fire -- two FIGHTERS strafe
text: the city as RADIUM CANNONS on the main ship launch EMBER BOMBS --
text: which spiral like catherine wheels, spitting WHITE SPARKS as
text: they hit the streets and DETONATE--
text: --COARSING down alleyways and into buildings, cutting down
text: Tharks in the plaza -- with a bolt ZIPPING right at Carter--
text: --just as an armed-to-the-teeth THARK races blindly past, and
text: the EMBER-FRAG rips him in two instead. Spared by fate, Carter
text: picks up the fallen Thark’s rifle and runs on.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP PARAPET
text: Meanwhile, Tars bounds to where FIXED ARTILLERY is perched --
text: tractor-trailer-sized CROSSBOWS with coils of rope cables.
text: Operators take aim on the mother craft--
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
text: NORTH WALL! FIRE AT WILL!!!
text: --and huge STEEL GRAPPLES are shot into the sky, trailing the
dialog: taut cable -- and IMPALE the skin of the battleship! In mere
text: moments, a half-dozen cables have hold of the ship--
text: --and their cable coils start to retract. Like a whale
text: harpooned, the great airship is pulled toward the city! Its
text: engines GLOW with heat, but it can’t escape the cables!
scene_heading: ON A ADJACENT PARAPET
text: Carter scampers to a high vantage, across an alley from Tars’
text: artillery post. Tars and co. are focused ahead, and don't
text: notice a Helium FIGHTER soaring at them from behind--
text: --so Carter LEAPS to an unoccupied RADIUM CANNON, turning the
dialog: cockpit to take aim up--
text: --just as Tars spins to see Carter’s cannon aimed at him--
text: --just as Carter SHOOTS a BLAST that whistles past Tars and
text: SHATTERS the hull of the coming FIGHTER! The one-man flier
text: WOBBLES, thrown off course... and Tars FIRES a second shot,
text: hitting the engine as the fighter EXPLODES!
text: Tars nods a look of gratitude... then roars to his men:
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: DEFEND THE CITY!
scene_heading: EXT. SKIES ABOVE CITY
text: As the battle rages, the airship’s ENGINES and CANNONS are soon
text: obliterated. Like a hooked and netted fish, it’s hauled through
text: the city’s broken dome, colliding below rooftops--
text: --and allowing cheering THARKS to drop onto the ship’s deck!
text: Tars puts his rifle over a cable and SLIDES onto the ship! As it
text: descends into view for Carter--
text: -- see it TEE! with Hi -SIZED ENEMY S. ORS! The only
text: difference is their RED SKIN. They shoot RIFLES and draw
text: desperate SWORDS, suddenly desperately overmatched--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (astonished)
dialog: They‘re human...
text: --by the Tharks who SWARM their deck, cutting them down left and
text: right. Carter watches from the rooftop as Tars SLASHES his way
dialog: through ten men all by himself...
text: He stares as Tharks rid the airship of every RED MAN, hurling
text: bodies to the ground below.
text: AND AT THE AIRSHIP‘S EDGE
text: ENGINES FLARE as one HELIUM INTERCEPTOR craft TAKES OFF! Like
text: an escape jet with a shrouded cockpit, bat-shaped and sleek--
text: --it rockets skyward just as Tars spots its flight! He FIRES
text: his rifle and just MISSES! The Interceptor SPARKS and SMOKES,
text: as it jets skyward, disappearing in the distance--
speaker_heading: VAXX O.S.
dialog: General Tarkas!
text: Tars and Carter turn to see Vaxx drag from the ship a SQUIRMING
text: FIGURE hidden by a rose-colored cloak. The captive elbows Vaxx
text: and slips past him... The Tharks LAUGH at the futility of the
text: escape attempt as the figure runs toward Carter who
text: instinctively raises his sword to strike--
text: --as the figure‘'s cloak and hood fall away--
text: TO REVEAL THE PRINCESS OF MARS
text: A red-skinned, raven-haired woman, beautiful and strong, clad in
text: fine silks with a bare midriff, highlighted by a DIAMOND STONE
text: in a gold setting at her navel. This is DEJAH THORIS.
dialog: 36.
text: Carter stops in mid-strike, blade held high. It‘s an angel
text: before him -- the most beautiful woman he's ever seen. And
text: Dejah is just as confounded -- to see a man in Thark regalia.
text: Astonished, Carter lowers the sword--
text: Behind him, Tars, Vaxx and a dozen THARK SOLDIERS have arrived.
text: Dejah scampers up, trapped--
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: General Tarkas -- I'm here for you!
dialog: Please listen to me! I've traveled to
dialog: Thark for you!
text: Tars motions to his soldiers. As they brusquely drag her off,
text: she meets eyes with Carter. She gets only confusion, no glimpse
text: of sympathy. So her eyes harden -- and look away.
text: Tars nods to Carter, with genuine respect. Then marches off. In
text: his wake, Sola appears...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (still shell-shocked)
dialog: Your enemy...they’re like me...
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: No, Jonn-kata. Not like you.
dialog: {a proud smile)
dialog: You are alive.
text: As if on cue, EXPLOSIONS ring out from the huge battleship’s
text: hull, sending a FIREBALL of acrid smoke and flames into the sky,
text: framing Tars in a portrait of awesome destructive power.
text: Consumed by the glee of brutal victory, the Tharks raise their
text: swords and fire rifles! And Carter can only watch...
text: .-.-with both remorse and the fear of what's to come.

scene_heading: A CHAOTIC AERIAL WAR ZONE
text: above verdant green plains, where ZODANGAN AIRSHIPS and HELIUM
text: AIRSHIPS are dueling the skies, trying to shift the front lines
text: of what is clearly a massive war.
text: The Interceptor nimbly dives and dodges low, above ZODANGAN
text: GROUND TROOPS -- tens of thousands deep -- as they exchange
text: volleys of LASER FIRE with HELIUM ARMED FORCES, holding the line
text: atop a ridge, beyond which lies--
dialog: ~
dialog: 37.
text: THE GLEAMING CITY OF HELIUM
text: An awe-inspiring futuristic metropolis, made of hovering city
text: sections, in a crater valley of rivers and waterfalls.
text: A FORCE SHIELD around the city flickers with ENERGY RIPPLES as

text: The Interceptor flies in, banks beneath a FLOATING PALACE--
scene_heading: INT. HELIUM AIR FORCE HANGAR

speaker_heading: YOUNG PILOT

scene_heading: INT. KING’S QUARTERS - DAY
text: The King of Helium, TARDOS MORS, 60’s, great gravitas, sits with

text: flanked by HELIUM GENERALS.
speaker_heading: TARDOS MORS
dialog: Do you know her fate?
speaker_heading: YOUNG PILOT
dialog: No, your Majesty. She was alive...
text: The King raises his head, grieving done.
speaker_heading: TARDOS MORS
dialog: Then there’s still a chance.
speaker_heading: HELIUM GENERAL
dialog: It was madness, your Majesty. To place
dialog: her hope in the Tharks--
text: Tardos Mors stands, using a silver cane. Steps to a window, to
text: overlook FORMAL GARDENS, where a HOLOGRAPHIC FIGURE in a cloak
text: stands amidst cherry blossom trees. Back turned.
speaker_heading: COURT ADVISER (0.S.)
dialog: Sab Than is waiting, your Majesty.
scene_heading: EXT. FORMAL GARDENS -— DAY
text: The dark-cloaked HOLOGRAM is SAB THAN, the young Prince of
text: Zodanga, 30. The lower half of his face is red-skinned, with
text: Maori-like markings. The top half is shrouded by a HELMET.
dialog: 38.
text: He watches the cherry blossoms fall around him, and indeed
text: through him, with a wistful sort of stare...
speaker_heading: SAB THAN
dialog: It's a tragedy, your Majesty, that a
dialog: place of such beauty...must be
dialog: destroyed in order to be saved.
speaker_heading: TARDOS MORS (0.S.)
dialog: The tragedy is to believe that.
text: Sab Than’s hologram turns...to see Tardos Mors -- old and tired.
text: Yet his diamond pendant shines. Overhead, the city’s force
text: shields SHUDDER, absorbing enemy blasts.
speaker_heading: SAB THAN
dialog: You can’t survive. Surrender and you
dialog: save the lives of millions.
speaker_heading: TARDOS MORS
dialog: But not their future.
speaker_heading: SAB THAN
dialog: I was raised in the desert -- over one
dialog: hundred years ago. Do you know what
dialog: life is like there? A drop of rain, a
dialog: blade of grass...they are all miracles.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: In time, this entire planet will be a
dialog: desert. Its people will all need
dialog: miracles. Why is Helium unwilling to
dialog: try?
speaker_heading: TARDOS MORS
dialog: We can share what resources we have. We
dialog: can’t control nature.
speaker_heading: SAB THAN
dialog: But we can... This planet is dying!
dialog: So you will deliver me the Atmosphere
dialog: Plant or I will destroy your Kingdom to
dialog: take it!
speaker_heading: TARDOS MORS
dialog: It can’t be controlled. It can only be
dialog: protected. If you try to override the
dialog: Plant, it will destroy us all!
speaker_heading: SAB THAN
dialog: According to you!
speaker_heading: TARDOS MORS
dialog: According to those much wiser than me.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: SAB THAN
dialog: I offer the people a miracle. I've won

speaker_heading: TARDOS MORS
dialog: Peace.

speaker_heading: SAB THAN

text: in the flesh, turning to a window overlook--
text: OF THE CITY OF ZODANGA
text: A TOWERING METROPOLIS OF DARK METAL ISLANDS among smog- clouds.
text: Each islarid*is supported by massive stilts. It’s a jungle gym
text: of Soviet-style architecture -- slums upon slums, like a
text: blackened scab upon the sky’s foul soot blanket.
text: Giant ZODANGAN AIRSHIPS are sky-docked at platforms, with
text: SOLDIERS scurrying to re-arm and re-supply. It is clearly a
text: well-oiled war machine...as Sab Than turns to a GENERAL:
speaker_heading: SAB THAN
dialog: No mercy.
scene_heading: INT. WAR COUNCIL CHAMBER - THARK - DAY
text: Doors THUNDER OPEN to reveal a court-like rotunda. Eight ELDER
text: THARKS, the War Council, flank a central pulpit -- where Tal
text: Hajus slumps in a lazy, draconian pose.
text: Carter slips in, desperate to find the princess. An assembly of
text: THARK OFFICERS watches as Dejah is brought before Hajus. At the
text: fore are Tars, Vaxx and Sarkoja.
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: Princess of Helium. How unexpected. To
dialog: what do we owe the hostilities?
text: Despite the environs, she’s far from intimidated:
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: Commander Hajus, I demand the safe
dialog: treatment of my ship’s prisoners--
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: What prisoners?
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: (pure bitterness)
dialog: You’re even more savage than your
dialog: reputation.
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: And you more beautiful. Enough
dialog: compliments.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: We were a damaged vessel requesting
dialog: safe harbor. We returned fire only
dialog: when provoked--
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: Lack of wisdom in red men surprises no
dialog: Thark.
text: The Thark audience laughs. Dejah sees Tars Tarkas doesn't.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: We were engaged -by Zodangan warships
dialog: over the Korus Hills. Mine was a
dialog: diplomatic mission. My destination was
dialog: Thark.
text: There’s a MURMUR of surprise among the assembled Tharks. Tal
text: Hajus narrows his eyes as the murmur grows...
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: For decades, we have maintained the
dialog: entire planet’s water supply, despite
dialog: the brutal interference of your Tharks.
dialog: You know that if not for our scientific
dialog: operations, there wouldn’t be the
dialog: resources on Mars to support a single
dialog: life -- green or red.
text: Hajus scowls, but doesn't dispute this.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: Within days, my city will fall. only
dialog: an alliance will save us both--
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: Your war with Zodanga is not Thark
dialog: concern.
speaker_heading: DEJA
dialog: Sab Than wants the Atmosphere Plant. He
dialog: intends to override it.
text: Another MURMUR in the audience...this one of worry...
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: It provides our air, our water, our
dialog: existence. It has run itself since the
dialog: dawn of time! Is that for one man to
dialog: control? If it even can be controlled?
text: Hajus gives a dismissive wave. Dejah meets the gaze of Tars
text: Tarkas...and now turns toward him...
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: That Plant was a gift from the Orovars,
dialog: the creators -- beyond our science and
dialog: understanding. My people have sworn to
dialog: protect it~-
speaker_heading: SARKOJA
dialog: You will addressss Commander Hajusss!
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: I address all Tharks.
speaker_heading: SARKOJA
dialog: Ssstrike her! Ssstrike her down!
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: (pleads with Tars)
dialog: I promise you, this is your fight.
dialog: Tharks once knew the meaning of honor.
dialog: You were more than thieves and killers -
dialog: - until this King--
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: STRIKE HER DOWN!
text: It's Vaxx who heeds the command. He charges Dejah and BACKHANDS
text: her to the floor! Her navel's DIAMOND STONE is again revealed
text: as Vaxx is upon her, raising his sword--
text: --only to have it PARRIED aside with a CRASH of metal that sends
dialog: the blade flying from his hands!--
text: --as Vaxx spins to see Carter standing there. Sword ready.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Try again and I'll kill you.
text: The entire council GASPS -- hearing Carter speak their language.
text: Even Tars looks astonished.
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: He speaks...? Our language?
dialog: 42.
text: The entire room of Tharks now STANDS, drawing WEAPONS. But
text: Carter stands his ground as Dejah raises herself on one elbow,
text: watching with wide, staring eyes.
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: Take the Earth Man away! He has no
dialog: right in this War Council!
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: But he does, my King. He is the Thark
dialog: who captured her. He has the right to
dialog: name her fate.
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: The Earth Man?!
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: It is the law.
text: Another MURMUR as all wait to see Hajus’ reaction...
speaker_heading: VAXX (0.S.)
dialog: This is a Thark? Then let him die like
dialog: a Thark--
text: Carter looks up to see -- BAM! -- Vaxx's four hands SHOVE him
text: backwards. Vaxx calls to all assembled:
speaker_heading: VAXX
dialog: I demand Justice}!
text: Carter doesn’t know what's happening. Tars now looks grim. So
text: does Dejah, now held captive by Sarkoja...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: “Justice,” what’s “justice”...
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: You have been challenged, Jonn-kata.
text: Vaxx takes a sudden step toward him -- so Carter spins, pulling
text: both his DAGGER-SWORDS defensively--
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
text: The weapon is chosen.
text: Vaxx nods smugly. And draws his own daggers -- four of them.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What is this? For what?
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: For honor, Jonn-kata. From this moment
dialog: on, only one of you may live.
dialog: 43.
text: Carter meets Dejah's eyes. He’s in this for her...
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: I wonder, princess. How many fools
dialog: have gone to their deaths...over you?
text: And Vaxx CHARGES! Lunging with all FOUR DAGGERS, whipping
text: wildly. Carter PARRIES two blows, but a third CLANKS off his
text: armor and a fourth SLASHES his side! Carter buckles to a knee,
text: as Vaxx brings his two free arms SLASHING DOWN--
text: --and Carter dive-rolls forward -- through Vaxx's legs -- in the
text: nick of time. He looks up to see Vaxx charge again--
text: --but this time Carter drops into a fighting stance, both blades
text: ready. He backs up, PARRYING a succession of four blows -- and
text: when Vaxx swings them in pairs--
text: --Carter ducks the two high strikes and PARRIES the two low.
text: Vaxx brings the high arms slashing down and Carter parries
text: those. When the low arms strike from the side--
text: --Carter forcibly splits the held high blades, leaping up with a
text: FORWARD FLIP and landing a SLASH to Vaxx'’s shoulder. Blood
text: spurts and the Thark buckles!
text: The Thark audience REACTS as Carter lands in a ready crouch.
text: Vaxx spins, PIROUETTING TWO BLADES at him--
text: --and just as they’re about to ROTOR into Carter's face, he
text: flashes his daggers up, KNOCKING them harmlessly aside. Vaxx's
text: extra daggers skitter into the crowd.
text: AND VAXX TAKES A ROARING, RUNNING LEAP
text: As Carter dive-rolls forward, letting Vaxx land beyond him! He
text: struggles up -- but Vaxx is there! He barely PARRIES a blow,
text: only to have Vaxx PUNCH him in the gut.
text: Vaxx SLICES his second blade -- Carter ducks away, but another
text: fist BACKHANDS him to the floor. He loses a dagger. Vaxx just
dialog: has too many arms for Carter to defend--
text: --as Vaxx stalks forth, grinning, toying with him now. Wounded
text: badly, Carter struggles to crawl away, trying to reach his last
dialog: fallen dagger--
speaker_heading: VAXX
dialog: When you choose your weapon, Earth
dialog: Man...next time, choose a gun...
text: And as Vaxx slashes down CROSSED DAGGERS for the final blow,
text: Carter HURLS HIS LAST DAGGER like a point-blank javelin -- with
dialog: the same strength he'd thrown the Martian rock!
dialog: 44.
text: THUNK! Time seems to stop. Vaxx stands stock-still...as a
text: trickle of blood runs from his lips. His crossed daggers are
text: still held at his chest--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Next time.
text: --pinned there by Carter's DAGGER, which has run right through
text: Vaxx's wrists and impaled his heart.
text: Vaxx hits the floor, dead. The Tharks are astonished. So is
text: Dejah. As Carter wearily stands...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You say I name the princess’ fate?
text: Tars looks to Hajus, who grudgingly nods.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Then I say she lives.
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: (a defiant sneer)
dialog: Then live you shall, Princess. While
dialog: we determine just what you are worth.
dialog: And to whom.
text: With a POUND of his staff, the Council is dismissed. Hajus nods
text: to Sarkoja, who hauls Dejah away. The Thark officers POUND
text: their own sword-hilts on the ground -- a war-like drumbeat.
text: Dejah and Carter lock eyes...
text: ++-as she’s pulled out of sight. The Thark officers keep up the
text: DRUMBEAT. It’s like they're saluting...him.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: (to Carter)
dialog: Come with me.
scene_heading: INT. VAXX'S QUARTER’S - PALACE - NIGHT
text: Tars leads Carter, Sola and Woola into a well-furnished room...
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Your mastery of our weapons was
dialog: expected. Your mastery of our language
dialog: was not.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: You are an interesting man, Jonn-kata.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Call me John.
dialog: 4s.
text: Before Carter can ask why, squires enter carrying the clothes,
text: armor, and weapons of Vaxx.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: This is now yours.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (re: Vaxx‘’s possessions)
dialog: Shouldn’t this be left to his family?
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: You still have much to learn about
dialog: Tharks.
text: Tars and Carter sit at a table as Vaxx's squires bring plates of
text: strange fruit and vegetables.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Eat.
text: Woola comes sniffing for table scraps. Carter tosses him a
text: Martian rodent, pats his flanks:
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Run along, Woola. It’s all right.
text: The calot plops his belly on the floor.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: “Woola.” Why?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Just something we do back home.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: You command the calot as you do the
dialog: thoats -~ without force. It is an
dialog: interesting tactic.
text: Tars studies Carter, eyeing the sword in his hilt.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: And you use your sword in a most
dialog: intriguing way...
text: Tars stands and imitates Carter's fighting moves, but the
text: actions are clumsy. Carter rises and pulls his sword...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You're lunging too quick...
dialog: 46.
text: Carter demonstrates a more elegant approach. With an excellent
text: student's observational skill, Tars repeats the action with
dialog: fluidity.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Good.
text: Feeling high-spirited, Tars moves to a weapons rack and adds to
text: his other three hands mace, ax, and shield.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: I use this when I’m surrounded...
text: With a magnificent display of skill, Tars uses each limb with
text: equal dexterity against an assault by invisible opponents.
text: Stopping, he offers the weapons to Carter...
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: You try.
text: Carter hold up his hands - “Only two arms."
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Sorry.
text: Carter breaks a smile. Tars laughs, returns the weapons to the
text: rack and gestures with his two free arms...
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Grow two more and I will make you
dialog: Captain of the Guard.
text: Carter and Tars laugh.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Where did you learn to fight?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: West Point. A military academy...
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: +.. Where they train in the way of the
dialog: warrior... It was taught to me from
dialog: the moment I hatched.
dialog: (with some regret)
dialog: It is all we learn.
text: Dismissing any temptation to be introspective, Tars leans
dialog: toward more “upbeat” subjects...
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Perhaps... Perhaps it is well that you
dialog: found your way to Barsoom.
dialog: 47.
text: Carter smiles, but he's not sure.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (gnawing at him)
dialog: I must ask you, Tars, about the
dialog: princess. What will become of her?
text: Tars reaches for his stein, but cannot bring himself to drink.
text: The joy has vanished. From the shadows, Sola listens in...
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: (uncomfortable)
dialog: Tal Hajus will not honor her request
dialog: for an alliance. Instead he will sell
text: her to the prince of Zodanga.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: So she came to you for help.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Yes. Because Tharks should respect-:
dialog: honor. Yet honor means nothing to Tal
dialog: Hajus.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What will Tal Hajus do?
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: He will... Our King, he... He will
text: “keep” her before turning her over to
dialog: Zondanga. .
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: “Keep?”
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: He has a “taste” for red women. His
dialog: decadence knows no bounds...
text: Carter is stunned, saddened, appalled, and quietly furious.
text: Desperate to change the subject, Tars rises...
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Let me show you my rifles!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (polite)
dialog: Tars... I’ma little tired... If
dialog: you'll excuse me, I’ll say good night.
text: Tars knows that he has lost a degree of Carter’s respect, but
text: replies with equal politeness...
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: As you wish.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THARK PLAZA - DUSK
text: FIERY TORCHES light the gutted, looted Helium battleship, as
text: HUNDREDS OF THARKS cut free its tethers. But rather than fall
text: to the ground, it instead floats higher. Like a great blimp,
text: the behemoth ascends into the sky--
text: --as the FIRE spreads within it. Against a star-scape backdrop,
text: it lights up like a FUNERAL PYRE, billowing black smoke and
text: flame. Rising to join the galaxy beyond...
scene_heading: EXT./INT. CARTER’S BALCONY - SAME
text: ...as Carter watches from his balcony, lost in thought. He
text: turns to see Sola and Woola approach, watching the sky with him.
text: In a far part of the palace is a LIGHTED ROOM in a HIGH TOWER.
text: Carter analyzes ledges and other old balconies. Sola points to
text: Malagors patrolling the sky...
speaker_heading: SOLA
text: They watch the sky for Helium
dialog: airships...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Then they won't be looking for me.
dialog: (to Woola)
dialog: Stay.
text: Concerned, Sola watches Carter JUMP thirty feet to the NEXT
text: LEDGE... Mortar gives way and bricks drop to the street
text: alerting the Malagors! Carter quickly pulls himself up, hidden
text: from view as the Malagors soar past.
scene_heading: INT. DEJAH’S ROOM - PALACE - NIGHT
text: Dejah watches the burning FUNERAL PYRE, tears fill her eyes as
text: her lost ship drifts to the heavens. Alone, Dejah begins to
text: disrobe, but stops when she hears...
speaker_heading: CARTER O.S.
dialog: Princess...
text: She spins and covers herself, drying her tears. For a moment,
text: neither says a word, both acutely aware of a subtle yet intense
dialog: mutual attraction...
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
text: There are four guards. Right outside.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Then send for them.
text: He waits. She hesitates. And curiosity gets the best of her...
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: (with suspicion)
dialog: Who are you? -
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: My name is John Carter. I'm a prisoner
dialog: here as well.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: You attacked my ship and killed my men.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I thought you were my enemy.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: And now you think differently?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yet you live among Tharks, you wear
dialog: their armor, you speak their language.
text: He points to the starscape beyond the balcony:
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I’m from Earth. The future. I’m here
dialog: by mistake. We were lost in a cave --
dialog: a friend and I -- and we ended up here.
dialog: All I want is to find him and return
dialog: home. Have you seen or heard of a man
dialog: like me?
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: No.
text: A weighted beat between them.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: You believe there is a way back.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That cave was a portal. It was built -
dialog: - by an intelligence--
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: The Orovars.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: They were the ancestors of all life.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: DEJAH (cont'd)
dialog: They traveled the galaxies, colonizing
dialog: planets. They built the Atmosphere
dialog: Plant that makes Mars inhabitable, they
dialog: built our canals, our cities -~ and
dialog: then vanished a million years ago. If
dialog: there’s a portal on Earth...I suspect
dialog: they built your planet too.
text: Dejah goes to the window, where Earth hangs in the night sky:
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: You say you‘re from the future?
text: Carter nods.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: Does life on this planet survive?
text: Carter hesitates. She waits with troubled eyes.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yeah. .Yeah it does...
text: She smiles, emboldened.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: This is why we fight.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What will happen to you?
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: Tal Hajus will keep me prisoner. Red
text: men are all the same to him. He blames
dialog: us all for his people's exile.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And if I were to help you?
text: She looks up, surprised.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Would you help me in return? Your
dialog: kingdom has ships, communications... to
dialog: help me search for my friend.
text: Dejah studies his gallant face...with a newfound hope...
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: Beyond this city lie oceans of desert -
dialog: - full of Warhoons and worse. It will
dialog: take days to get to Helium...if it even
text: still stands.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I’1l take the chance.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: And if he’s dead? If you never find
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I'll have tried.
text: She searches his eyes, trying to allay last suspicions...
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: Then tell me, John Carter. How do we
dialog: escape ten thousand Tharks?
text: Their whispering faces are close enough to kiss...there's a
text: charge in the air...but Carter remains focused:
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: By deciding to leave.
text: Carter backs into the shadows, and with one last look,
text: disappears over the side of the balcony... as Dejah turns back
text: to the window and allows a troubled smile.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: John Carter. Of Earth.
text: +.-and as she looks to the stars, ANGLE moves past her to a
text: hidden GRATE in the high shadows of the ceiling. From a rooftop
text: perch above...a pair of THARK EYES gleam...
text: Sarkoja has been watching.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SKIES ABOVE ZODANGA - NIGHT
text: More WARSHIPS rumble as they detach from their docking spires,
text: heading into the black and murky cloudscape...
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE ZODANGA - WAR ROOM - NIGHT
text: Sab Than marches the bridge level, flanked by GENERALS--
speaker_heading: ZODANGAN GENERAL
dialog: Lord Prince, we've intercepted a
dialog: communication from Helium--
text: --as they arrive at a COMMUNICATIONS CONSOLE. An INTELLIGENCE
text: OFFICER reads a decoded message:
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: INTEL OFFICER
dialog: "King of Thark, I request the safe
dialog: return of the Princess. Reward will be
dialog: yours at any price.”
speaker_heading: ZODANGAN GENERAL
dialog: It was coded with a royal frequency.
speaker_heading: SECOND GENERAL
dialog: How could the Tharks have taken her
dialog: prisoner?
speaker_heading: SAB THAN
dialog: If she's there, she went willingly. For
dialog: an alliance.
text: Sab Than stares at HOLOGRAM SCREENS charting the progress of his
text: armies’ assault on Helium...
speaker_heading: SAB THAN
dialog: And if she’s there...so is the key.
speaker_heading: SECOND GENERAL
dialog: We'll redeploy our warships. We'll
dialog: surround Thark and take her ourselves.
speaker_heading: SAB THAN
dialog: Our ships can’t be spared.
text: Sab Than nods to his SENIOR AIDES, silently in his shadow:
speaker_heading: SAB THAN
dialog: Ready my armor and my ship.
dialog: (to his Generals)
text: This is the turning point.
dialog: (darkly)
dialog: Leave the princess to me.
scene_heading: INT. CARTER’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Late, silent. Embers in the fire. Woola snores, slumbering at
text: the foot of the bed...as a SHADOW slips past. It’s Carter.
text: With a farewell look.
scene_heading: INT. SPIRAL ATRIUM - NIGHT
text: Carter ghosts down the stairs and into the corridor. But
text: sensing a presence, he grabs his sword and spins--
text: --to see Woola on the bottom step. Sitting. Panting.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Perfect.
dialog: 53.
scene_heading: EXT. THARK STREETS - NIGHT
text: Two SENTRY THARKS patrol past, as Carter darts across the street
text: in their wake, keeping to shadows. Woola scampers right behind,
text: as Carter glares:
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You're not coming! Go home, get outta
dialog: here. Go!
text: Woola doesn't. So Carter points his sword -- a threat:
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You stink and you're ugly but it was
dialog: very nice meeting you. Now go slobber
text: on somebody else.
text: The beast whimpers with mournful eyes...but finally slinks away.
text: Carter sheathes his sword and looks skyward. With a LEAP...he’s
text: on the rooftops.
text: Woola immediately turns tail and races the way they came.
scene_heading: INT. CARTER'S QUARTERS
text: Woola bursts in, chuffing and nuzzling Sola’s sleeping face. She
text: shoots awake -- and sees Carter’s empty bed.
scene_heading: EXT. ATOP THARK BUILDINGS - NIGHT
text: Carter scampers the rooftops, under cover of darkness. A new
text: perch gives him a vantage of the Palace Tower--
text: --where a LIGHT is on in Dejah’s high window. A high stone
text: corridor bridges it to the rest of the palace, but the tower is
text: also ringed by a crumbling outer staircase -- beginning halfway
text: up. Directly beneath it is a thatched-roof GUARDHOUSE, with a
text: small CAMPFIRE. And two SENTRY THARKS.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWER GUARDHOUSE - NIGHT
text: The sentries cross paths, then separate, allowing Carter to dart
text: through the shadows between them, planting a foot off a supply
scene_heading: box and LEAPING HIGH-~-
text: --to grab the lowest crumbling stair! He pulls himself up--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Close.
text: --and suddenly the STONE breaks apart beneath his weight! His
text: hands scrape the stairs, coming up empty, eyes wide--
dialog: 54.
text: --and he FALLS straight back down! SMASH! He punches a hole
text: through the straw guardhouse roof, glancing off HAY BALES and
text: THUMP! Hits the ground on his back--
scene_heading: AS A CREATURE'S GIANT EYE
text: opens right behind him. A staring pupil, the size of Carter's
text: entire head. At a SNORT, Carter slowly turns...
speaker_heading: THARK GUARD (0.S.)
dialog: I heard something! By the tower!
text: +..to see a slumbering MALAGOR wake. The shack is his home. His
text: dragon-like head rises, wings unfurling--
text: --and Carter swiftly looks to the CAMPFIRE beyond the doorway,
text: its burning logs within reach. With an idea...
scene_heading: EXT. TOWER - SECONDS LATER
text: The Sentry Tharks come running just as the straw-roofed house
text: GOES UP IN FLAMES! And in the next instant -- SMASH! The
text: panicked Malagor CRASHES straight through the burning roof,
text: FLAPPING WINGS skyward, elevating straight up--
text: --with Carter perched on its back! Skying a pure vertical--
text: --he comes even with the tower's stairs and jumps off. He
text: crouches in shadow, unseen by the guards below--
text: --as the Malagor pumps its wings, shrieks, and flies off,
text: snuffing last bits of flame from its wing-tips. The Sentries
text: try to smother the mysterious stable-fire...while Carter
text: scampers a spiral to the high window.
scene_heading: INT. DEJAH‘S ROOM
text: Carter slips inside, seeing Dejah’s figure asleep beneath her
text: covers. He races to the bed-- .
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: It's time to leave, Princess--
text: But the bed is empty.
speaker_heading: SOLA (0.S.)
dialog: She is gone...
text: Carter wheels to see Sola step into the light, waiting for him.
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: You didn’t say goodbye, Jonn-kata.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Where is she?
scene_heading: INT. TOWER CORRIDOR
text: Carter and Sola rush out to see two THARK GUARDS lying dead,
text: felled by radium gunfire. Carter’s still astonished:
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You did this? These are your people...
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: They were, a long time ago. And now
dialog: they know of your plans. Tal Hajus
dialog: hoped you would seek to escape. It
dialog: gives him a reason to take your life.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: You stood up against him -- in the
dialog: Council. You remind us it is possible.
text: She wears a look of pride...and remains resolute...
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: You won't survive the desert, Jonn-
dialog: kata. Not alone.
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: That seems to be the general consensus.
text: She offers him her pistol. Carter takes it and nods.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Take me to her...
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - NIGHT
text: On a ledge above, a FIXED TENT sits beside two RADIUM CANNONS,
text: buffeted by a gale. A guarded checkpoint.
text: Two THARKS stand by their post when they hear a DISTANT WHINE.
text: Immediately, they rush to their gunner positions--
text: --as they and their cannons are OBLITERATED in a STRAFING OF
text: RADIUM FIRE as a Zodangan FIGHTER (with tail-mounted cannons)
text: SOARS past, right through the pass.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: THE FIGHTER
text: Is piloted by Sab Than. His metallic mask consults a blinking
text: target-screen, with a map of the city of Thark...
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT BEYOND THARK - NIGHT
text: We see the city in the b.g. as ENGINES ROAR...and the ship drops
text: low, hovering over the sands.
text: A HATCH swivels open and a CARGO DISC lowers, carrying Sab Than
text: mounted on an ARMORED THOAT. As they reach the sand--
text: --Sab Than spurs his mount and rides off. For the dark city.
text: Sab Than gallops the midnight sand...and as he does, his armor
text: BLENDS with his surroundings, cloaking him again as a HEAT-~
text: MIRAGE SHIMMER. A trick of the eye.
scene_heading: EXT. GATES OF THARK
text: Three GATE SENTRIES tense at the sound of hoofbeats. They ready
text: weapons, pointing them into the dark desert...
text: ...aS a HEAT-MIRAGE of a THOAT charges forth, cantering to a
text: halt in a swirl of dust. The Sentries hold fire--
speaker_heading: GATE SENTRIES
dialog: There‘s no one there--!
text: --and don’t notice Sab Than’s HEAT-MIRAGE leap over the Tharks
text: to land right behind them. They spin at the sound--
text: --as a SWORD-MIRAGE cuts two of them down in an instant! The
text: third sentry scampers back, waving a sword defensively-~
text: --as a SWORDPOINT-MIRAGE plunges out of his chest. The Thark
text: falls to his knees, as Sab Than’s MIRAGE is at his ear:
speaker_heading: SAB THAN
dialog: Open the gates.
scene_heading: INT. TAL HAJUS’ BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT
text: In an opulent room that reeks of cruel carnality...stands a
text: tense Dejah. Chained to a post is a fierce BANTH, a ten- legged
text: Martian “tiger.” Doors THUNDER open as Tal Hajus enters with
text: Sarkoja, who greets the Banth like a kitten...
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: That's a sweet little girl. To think
dialog: she once despised me...
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: I find that hard to believe.
text: Hajus rubs the thing’s belly and it purrs.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: Why was I moved from my room...
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: Moved? You escaped with the Earth Man.
dialog: Why you may never be found.
text: Dejah tenses, with Sarkoja now circling behind her...
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: What are you hiding, Princess?
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: I have no idea what you’re--
speaker_heading: ; TAL HAJUS
dialog: Your “kingdom says’ they'll pay any
dialog: reward I name. Who would be worth
dialog: that...amidst a war? Not one life. Not
dialog: even a princess.
dialog: (slyly)
text: Only what she has. Or what she knows.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: You are mistaken.
text: Hajus merely nods, leaving the Banth...
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: You reds with your scientific prowess,
dialog: your knowledge, your secrets. What
dialog: have you ever shared with my people?
text: The princess backs away...
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: You think of us as savages. But let me
dialog: ask you: when the last lakes dry up,
dialog: when the winter rains cease...what will
dialog: any of us be but savages?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And the ones who survive...will be the
dialog: ones who are best at it.
text: Dejah watches Sarkoja pour a decanter of WINE. It‘s filled with
text: long and slithering MAGGOT-WORMS...
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS ~
dialog: You will tell me what you are hiding,
dialog: Princess. Or you will beg for the

speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: But they’1l pay...my people will pay...
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS

text: Atop the city walls, Tars Tarkas and Major Jakkal arrive on
text: scene. Tars stares into the dark desert...seeing the HEAT-
text: MIRAGE of a thoat. He whips up his rifle and FIRES--
text: --as a GREEN PULSE-BOLT strikes the steed, lighting it up and re-

scene_heading: INT. WAR PALACE ATRIUM

text: Suddenly, Dejah CHARGES him -- darting for the door -- but two
text: of his claws HURL her back to the bed, cutting her--
text: --and at the sight of Dejah’s bleeding wound, the worms in the
text: wine grow more and more frenzied...
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: Have you never known Issla worms,
dialog: princess? They enter your bloodstream
text: through an open wound -- and then
dialog: breed. The pain is said to be
dialog: unbearable. Their secretions slow your
dialog: blood loss, so that torture that would

text: Dejah tries to cover her forearm, dripping red...
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: And time means so very little...in the
dialog: desert...

speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS

text: Sola spurs her mount and gallops it across the open square,
text: LEAPING the edge of the fountain--
text: --and landing in its recessed base. Twenty feet below ground,
text: it REVEALS its basin extends below the fountain’s rim. Into
dialog: darkness -- underground.
text: Carter and Dejah trade a look to see Sola disappear--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Hang on.
text: --and as Dejah wraps arms tight around him, Carter spurs his
text: mount, galloping into the open--
text: AS A RIFLE’S POV NOW SIGHTS THEM
text: --from high above, where Sab Than is perched on the tower
text: balcony with his own radium rifle -- as he FIRES!
scene_heading: AND A BLUE PULSE-BOLT RIPS RIGHT AT
text: Carter and Dejah, just as Woola sees and leaps to protect them!
text: And takes the BOLT in his side! Woola falls in a flash of BLUE
text: FLAME. Black-Eyes the thoat skids, sending Carter and Dejah
dialog: thrown to the ground--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Woola!
dialog: 64.
text: --and as they scramble up, Sab Than reacts to Carter’s face. Not ~
text: red, not green. Who is that? Woola’s fallen...he convulses with
text: BLUE CRACKLING ENERGY...as he meets Carter's eyes...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Thank you, my friend...
text: Reluctantly, Carter and Dejah leap over the fountain’s side, to
text: join Sola and scramble back aboard Black-Eyes--
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: Ride! Ride!
text: WHILE ON THE TOWER BALCONY
text: Sab Than reloads his rifle and sights -- but too late. They've
text: all vanished from view, underground. The warlord lowers his
text: rifle...with a troubled stare...
scene_heading: INT. CANAL RUINS ENTRANCE - NIGHT
text: The.two thoats descend sandstone steps.. Sola lights PHOSPHOR
text: FLARES. Carter's wracked with pain; Dejah holds him.
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: They've been dry for generations, but
text: they lead beyond the city walls. 7
text: --and as they round the steps, the tunnel opens onto a massive
text: CANAL CAVERN, an aqueduct that once transported water for
text: millions. In crumbling disrepair, but still intact.
scene_heading: EXT. DRY RIVERBED - OUTSIDE THARK - NIGHT
text: The Canal spills into a DRY RIVERBED. Reaching the end of the
text: tunnel, Sola and Dejah crawl out of the Canal and climb to a
text: ridge... Lagging behind, Carter follows...
scene_heading: EXT. RIDGE - OUTSIDE THARK - NIGHT
text: Rising from the riverbed, a relieved Carter turns to Dejah and
text: Sola who look like they just received a death sentence.
text: Carter spins... Sitting atop a panting thoat is Tars Tarkas.
text: In each hand he holds a rifle. Two are pointed at Sola and
text: Dejah. He aims the Third at Carter. Dispirited, overcome by
text: pain, Carter drops to his knees, hangs his head, and raises his
text: arms in surrender.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Jonn-kata. -~
dialog: 65.
text: A beaten Carter looks up... Tars throws him the rifle and
text: gestures at the TWO THOATS.
speaker_heading: TARS_-TARKAS
dialog: (with regret) .
dialog: You ride with them, Sola?
text: Terribly torn, Sola fights back tears and nods. Coolly, fTars
text: tosses two rifles to her and the last to the princess.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Travel north to the Warhoon border. In
dialog: two days, double back to the Ishkee
dialog: Valley - it is a safe route to Helium.
dialog: I will tell them your tracks lead
dialog: south.
text: Overwhelmed, Carter tries to thank him..
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Tars...
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Say nothing. If ever I see you
dialog: again... You will die by my hand.
text: A stoic Tars kicks his thoat and returns to the city.
scene_heading: INT. TAL HAJUS’ BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT
text: ANGLE TRACKS past fallen guards and Sarkoja’s worm-ravaged
text: corpse...to find Tal Hajus. As his eyes crack open...
scene_heading: INT. THARK PALACE - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT
text: KER-CHUK! Doors crash open as Tal Hajus STORMS in, oblivious to
text: his wounds. Thark SERVANTS scamper in tow-- _
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS -
text: TARS TARKAS! WHERE IS HE? WHERE IS--
text: --and stops short. Standing on the map dais, hands clasped and
text: back turned...is Sab Than. Scared THARK ELDERS wait...
speaker_heading: SAB THAN
dialog: Tal Hajus. You were in possession of
dialog: the Princess of Helium. And you chose
dialog: not to inform Zodanga.
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: I was on the verge -- of sending word--
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: SAB THAN
dialog: That you had her? Or that you let her
dialog: escape?
text: Sab Than now turns. Tal Hajus takes an instinctive step back,
text: as Tars Tarkas arrives in the doorway behind him.
speaker_heading: SAB THAN
dialog: Who is he?
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: Lord Prince--? *y
speaker_heading: SAB THAN
text: The one who rides with her.
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: He claims to come from Earth. We
dialog: captured him many months ago -- in the
text: Paktar Sea Beds.
speaker_heading: SAB THAN
dialog: And you let him live?
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: (a glare to Tars)
dialog: We thought he had worth as a warrior.
dialog: He is without your technology or skill,
dialog: but he has power.
text: The Prince of Zodanga marches forth. Hajus tenses...
speaker_heading: SAB THAN
dialog: Your people exist at my pleasure. When
dialog: the war is over, you should wish to be
dialog: remembered well.
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: We will find her, Lord Prince--
speaker_heading: SAB THAN
dialog: Yes you will.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Or you'll find extinction.
text: Hajus reluctantly lowers a knee, bowing, and Sab Than strides
text: past. His armor DE-MATERIALIZES, turning him into a vanishing
text: HEAT-MIRAGE at the door. Gone.
text: In his wake, Hajus rises. Stares daggers at Tars Tarkas.
dialog: 67.
scene_heading: EXT. MARTIAN DESERT - NIGHT
text: Wind WHIPS fiercely as A BLOOD RED SUN rises over an endless
text: sandscape. Dunes to the horizon. In the distance, two tiny
text: THOATS trudge the sand. An injured Carter slumps behind Dejah,
dialog: deathly weak...
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: (to Sola)
dialog: He's losing too much blood...
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: There is no help in the desert. Let us
text: ride without rest for the Saravak Pass.
dialog: And pray.
text: Sola looks behind them, we can see the faint lights of Thark,
text: miles distant across the angry desert night.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - FROM THE SKIES - DAY
text: A MALAGOR with a THARK RIDER swoops over the desert, scouring
text: for signs of them as it flies over a ragged ribbon of trench - -
text: an exposed aqueduct, ceiling collapsed and long gone ary.
text: It soars on, over a contingent of Thark SOLDIERS on THOATS led
text: by Tars Tarkas. A pack of TRACKING CALOTS lead them on...hooves
text: pounding, following Carter’s trail...
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY
text: A fierce SANDSTORM rages as Sola urges her thoat against the
text: gale. Suddenly, a feverish Carter FALLS! Dejah drops to his
text: side. He's wracked with sweat and shivering, eyes shut...
speaker_heading: DEJAH
speaker_heading: SOLA!
text: Sola scrambles over, feeling his breaths rise and fall. She
text: inspects his bandaged wound and then spots some scrub-plant
text: thorn bushes in the sand, battered by the gale--
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: Stay with him. Give him shelter. And
dialog: keep him awake.
text: Sola then forges ahead into the sandstorm -- all alone.
dialog: 68.
scene_heading: INT. DESERT CAMP - DAY
text: A makeshift tent has been put up, with Carter and Dejah inside,
text: huddled against the elements. Dejah brings a canteen of water
text: to his lips...
text: ...and sees, around his neck, his Army DOG TAGS. She reaches
text: for them, tentative. Wipes the grime away to read his name.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (delirious, slurred)
dialog: I want to tell you the truth...
text: She startles, releases his tags. His breath is ragged...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: The truth...about the future...
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: This planet doesn’t survive.
text: Dejah trembles, unwilling to believe it. Carter nods.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: The Barsoom I’ve known...has no life.
dialog: You won't win your fight.
dialog: (winces, shuts eyes)
dialog: I’m sorry...
text: Dejah edges back. Then grows resolute:
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: It's the future of all planets, isn’t
dialog: it? Yours too. So do you stop
dialog: fighting for your survival today?
speaker_heading: CARTER -
dialog: Come with me...
text: She's surprised. His mind is drifting, delirium near...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: To Earth...
dialog: (with reverence)
dialog: There‘s all the water you could ever
dialog: dream of. Rivers...oceans...
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: And is there no war?
text: Carter falls silent.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: That is the world I dream of.
text: They trade a solemn look. Carter's fading fast...and as he
text: loses consciousness, she tenses, clutching him--
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: No...stay awake...stay awake...
text: --and, without other recourse, presses her lips to his and
text: kisses him. She holds it...but when she looks back...his eyes
text: are shut. She takes his hand, feeling his pulse...
text: He’s still alive. She then sees his NOTEBOOK poking from his
text: pocket. She opens it up to the first page: “My name is Captain
dialog: John Carter, United States Army, etc.”
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: I fought today alongside Tharks. I
dialog: killed men who were strangers for a
dialog: cause I don't understand or believe in.
dialog: How it reminded me of home...
text: Still holding his hand as the tent buffets from the storm
text: outside...she settles in...
scene_heading: INT. DESERT CAMP - NIGHT ~ LATER
text: Where Dejah continues to read his journal...as the DIAMOND STONE
text: at her navel gleams in the dim light...
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.0O.)
dialog: I write tonight not knowing if these
dialog: words will be my last. A princess of
dialog: Mars has asked me to help her. And in
dialog: return, she says she‘ll help me. I’ve
text: no idea if she’s telling the truth. But
dialog: I have no one else to trust...
speaker_heading: SOLA (0.S.)
dialog: Princess?!
text: The tent flap OPENS SUDDENLY as Sola peers in, with armfuls of
text: cactus branches and an excited look:
speaker_heading: SOLA
text: The storm has lifted.
text: Dejah emerges...to see that MOUNTAIN FOOTHILLS now loom near.
dialog: They've crossed the desert!
dialog: 70.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN PLATEAU - NIGHT
text: A CAMPFIRE crackles as Sola roasts an avian carcass, while the
text: thoats munch on bramble.
text: Meanwhile, Dejah spreads CACTUS SLUGS on Carter's wound. They
text: eat the infection, excreting juice and pulling the skin tight
text: like a LIVING BANDAGE...as he winces badly...
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: Ow! It feels like the knives are still
dialog: in there! wy
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: Don't touch. Let them work. Now eat.
dialog: Regain your strength.
text: She brings food to Carter and Dejah. Dejah studies her:
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: Why are you helping us?
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: I believe as you do -- that the wrong
dialog: Thark leads us. Thark children were
dialog: once raised by their parents, not the
dialog: King. Now they are taught to kill
dialog: before they even know their names.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And before Hajus, it was different?
text: The question stops her. She stares off at the landscape:
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: My parents’ generation was the last to
dialog: mate for love. Under Hajus, it was
dialog: outlawed. Those Tharks who resisted,
dialog: like my mother, fled to these mountains
dialog: to raise us in secret. Until their
dialog: hideaways were found.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: What happened to her?
speaker_heading: SOLA
text: She was executed. Like all the rest.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And your father?
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: He stayed in the city. He surely
dialog: believes I am dead... ,
speaker_heading: (MORE).
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: SOLA (cont'd)
dialog: But a few of us survived out here...
dialog: and returned to Thark when we were
dialog: grown. We blended in. Found our place.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: You‘ve never told your father that
dialog: you're still alive?
text: Sola shakes her head solemnly.
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: He would not want to know what I had
dialog: lived to witness. That he is the
dialog: greatest soldier for the Thark who
dialog: destroyed our lives.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (realizes)
dialog: Tars Tarkas...
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: Your father is Tars Tarkas?!
text: Sola regards them. Nods. Then, to Dejah:
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: You should never have come, you see.
dialog: Because he’s forgotten -~ we've all
dialog: forgotten ~- what‘’s worth fighting for.
scene_heading: EXT. MARTIAN DESERT ~ NIGHT
text: Where Tars stares grimly over the sands. He leads a search
text: patrol of twenty THARKS on thoats...as two Zodangan ASSAULT
text: FLIERS roar across the sky overhead--
speaker_heading: MAJOR JAKKAL
dialog: Zodangan search planes! They’ve
dialog: crossed into our territory!
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: It's only ours until they want it. Keep
dialog: searching. No rest.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAINS - NIGHT TO DAWN - BEGIN MONTAGE
text: Carter, Dejah and Sola trek the jagged mountains, navigating
text: treacherous trails. Carter gains strength as they go.
text: Approaching a steep climb, their thoats falter. They won't make
text: it up the incline. The group trades a look -- and Carter
text: removes the animals’ harnesses and reins--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Welcome home. You're free...
dialog: 72.
text: --and slaps their flanks, sending them into the wild.
scene_heading: EXT. A JAGGED ROCK FACE
text: The threesome climb. The route is precarious, but Carter starts
text: to climb with confidence now, with Dejah behind him--
text: --till her footing gives way and she slips, sliding down rocky
dialog: scree right past Sola--
text: --just as Carter FREE-RAPPELS from above her, landing below
text: Dejah and catching her just in time before she slides over a
text: perilous drop. And off their shared, grateful look...
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF PEAKS - PRE-DAWN - END MONTAGE
text: Sola scans the route ahead with a digital spyglass, seeing
text: contrails in the sky. She motions they should wait...
text: ..-and as Dejah looks for Carter, she finds him sitting on a
text: rock ledge, staring at Earth. A moment alone.:.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Why did he come for you? Sab Than. He
dialog: was willing to fight all of Thark by
dialog: himself. For you.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: Not for me.
text: Dejah considers...and finally unburdens the truth...
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: For the key to the Atmosphere Plant.
dialog: It’s the secret my family is sworn to
dialog: protect.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And what if he’s right? What if inside
dialog: the Plant there is a way to change the
dialog: planet's fate?
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: If you could give one man control of
dialog: Earth -- the weather, the tides, the
dialog: oxygen -- would you? Would you trust
dialog: that to anyone? Is that what its maker
dialog: intended?
text: Carter nods, muses. Dejah holds the stare.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: We could use a soldier like you.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: This isn’t my war.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: For the fate of the world?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Your world. Not mine.
text: Too harsh. Dejah looks away, stung.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: So am I, John. For the truth I didn’t
dialog: tell you...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Your friend the Earth Man is dead.
text: Carter reacts, standing suddenly...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What are you talking about...
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: The tags you wear around your
dialog: neck...I've seen them before. Your
dialog: radio, your clothes -- I’ve seen them
dialog: all. They rest in a museum -- in my
text: city. With the skeleton of a man.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That’s impossible...
speaker_heading: DEJAH
text: The name on the tags is James Powell.
text: Carter stops still.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: He was found buried in the Paktar Sea
text: Beds. Over a hundred years ago.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: He traveled here ten minutes before I
dialog: did!
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: Ten minutes on your planet. It is you
dialog: who say you traveled through time.
dialog: (beat)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: DEJAH (cont'd)
dialog: In the museum, he's our most famous
dialog: exhibit. He‘s known as the “Proof.”
dialog: That there is life on other worlds.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Why didn’t you tell me...
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: Would you have helped me if I had? I
dialog: said I'd help you find him. And I
dialog: will.
text: She starts toward him...
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: You came for your friend but you're a
dialog: century too late.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I trusted you.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: I want you to.
text: She reaches a gentle hand; he recoils from her touch.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Red men, green men, you‘re all the
dialog: same. You want a soldier for your army
dialog: -- to run, to fight, to kill. No one
dialog: asks what I want--
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: You‘re not alone--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I AM ALONE!!!
text: A silence. Hurt, anger and despair.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: There's a place for you in Helium --
dialog: with my people. With me.
text: He meets her eyes...and turns his back on her. It's all too
text: much for him. She lets her gaze fall.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: Then may you find your way home, John
dialog: Carter... Where the wars are your own.
text: She walks away. Leaving him staring at his distant home
dialog: planet...forever out of reach...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 75.
scene_heading: EXT. BORDER RIDGE - DAY
text: The trio marches on, with Carter now far ahead. Sola trades a
dialog: look with Dejah -- why does he walk alone today? Dejah shakes
text: her head, feigns a mystery...
text: ++-and as Sola and Dejah ascend a ridgetop, they find Carter has
text: stopped in his tracks. At the gruesome sight of--
text: TWENTY THARK HEADS ON PIKES
text: Of tall, charred wood. The BONES of Thark arms and legs hang
text: like wind chimes from cross-beams. Some RHINO VULTURES fly off,
text: cackling. It's like a macabre fence of scarecrows.
text: Beyond the pikes is a dark, foreboding trail leading into a
text: TOWERING PETRIFIED FOREST.
text: Sola stops, shaken, chilled by the sight...
speaker_heading: SOLA
text: The Ohn Tokk Wood. Warhoon country.
text: Carter exchanges a look with Dejah.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: Compared to them, the Tharks are
dialog: philosophers.
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: And compared to a Thark, princess, you
dialog: are a light snack.
text: Suddenly, a HORN'S ECHO filters up from the rocky valley they
text: ascended from. Carter springs back to the ridge’s edge,
text: scanning with the digital spyglass--
text: --until he spots a COLUMN OF THARK RIDERS, many miles distant,
text: snaking across a far ridge.
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: Riders. Looks like a Thark search
dialog: party. I’d say a day away--
scene_heading: WHEN SUDDENLY--
text: A terrifying SHRIEK as A FEARSOME SHAPE SPRINGS UP in front of
text: Carter's face! He’s knocked backward as he sees the hissing,
text: gnashing jaws of a...
scene_heading: WARHOON WARRIOR
dialog: 76.
text: --rise from the rocks before him. The brute is adorned with
text: crude ANIMAL-BONE ARMOR and heavily tattooed with tribal
text: markings, and before Carter can react, the Warhoon flashes a
scene_heading: STINGER WHIP--
text: --which wraps around Carter's neck, choking him! Carter aims
text: his pistol, but the Warhoon snaps another WHIP, snaring his arm.
text: The gun falls. A third WHIP snares a leg -- a fourth WHIP
text: snares his other leg. Sola rushes to his aid--
text: AS TWO BARBED BOLTS ARE SHOT INTO HER BACK
text: knocking her down. Dejah spins to see FOUR ARCHER WARHOONS
text: march over the rise beyond the pike-fence, with fierce CROSSBOWS
dialog: aimed! Sola struggles up--
text: --and four more BOLTS drop her to the dust. Dejah rushes for
text: her sword, snaring it and turning--
text: TO SEE TWENTY WARHOONS APPEAR
text: over the rise, surrounding them in every direction!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Dejah--!
text: --as he reaches out a hand and she throws him her sword--
text: --just as the Warhoon swings him with the whips toward a RAVINE
text: CREVASSE. Carter manages to slice three of the whips free,
text: grabbing the fourth and JERKING IT with all his might--
text: --which sends the surprised Whip Warhoon SKYING over the edge,
text: PLUMMETING into the crevasse to his death. Carter scrambles
text: back atop the ridge--
text: ONLY TO FIND HIMSELF SURROUNDED
text: He and Dejah stand back-to-back, with wounded Sola trapped
text: nearby...as the Warhoons close in on them. In what they all
dialog: believe are their last moments...
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: I'm sorry, John Carter. For everything.
text: ---and as a bittersweet look passes between them...suddenly a
text: DEEP RUMBLE sounds from above...and all look skyward to see--
scene_heading: SAB THAN'S BAT-SHAPED BOMBER
text: Now darkening the sky above, as it zeroes in and swoops toward
text: ground. The Warhoons part to clear a landing area--
dialog: 77.
text: --as the ship DOCKS, amidst exhaust vapor hued crimson by
text: landing lights. A HATCH opens and out march Zodangan SOLDIERS,
text: flanking Sab Than in his magnificent armor.
speaker_heading: SAB THAN
text: Dejah Thoris. At last.
text: He reaches them...and studies Carter...
speaker_heading: SAB THAN
dialog: And you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I waited years for you. And then I
dialog: forgot.
text: Carter stands his ground, as the Zodangan Prince now removes his
text: hawk-like helmet...to reveal THE RED-SKINNED FACE OF CAPTAIN
text: JAMES POWELL. Carter’s in total shock...
text: ...as Powell grabs him in a forceful embrace. He claps Carter's
text: shoulders, beaming:
scene_heading: POWELL AKA SAB THAN
dialog: Beats some pretty red rocks, doesn’t
dialog: it?
text: Carter staggers, looking to Dejah...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Powell...
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: Your friend? The Earth Man? No, he'‘s--
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: A skeleton in your museum? That‘s the
dialog: Zodangan who first found me -~ in the
dialog: desert, over a century ago. I took his
dialog: life and left mine.
dialog: (touches his red face) -
dialog: It’s the atmosphere, Carter. In time,
dialog: it’ll change you. Extend your life to.
text: Powell nods to a black tribal marking on his throat, which
text: obscures a raised SCAR.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: That fall in the crevasse cut me open.
dialog: Voice has never been the same.
dialog: (a wry smile)
dialog: Then again...what has?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You started this war...?
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Like we always said, Carter. Finally
dialog: found something worth fighting for.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: For murder! You've killed millions!
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: This planet dies. You know it and know
dialog: it. Someone had to tell them. Someone
dialog: had to try and save it.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: You?! You will bring its death!
text: She suddenly charges him -- only to be grabbed by Carter. It’s
text: instinct. He holds her firmly -- and Powell nods a thanks.
text: Dejah looks to Carter with betrayal...
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Where is the key to the Plant,
dialog: Princess?
text: Suddenly, Sola breaks free from the Warhoons and CHARGES... and
text: Powell instantly spins with his radium pistol--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: James, wait--!
text: --as Carter steps in front of Powell's gun. Powell can’t open
text: fire. Then Carter spins on Sola--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Don't, Sola! Stop! Please...
text: --and Sola stops short of her attempted attack...as Zodangan
text: forces now hold her fast. Powell narrows his eyes at Carter’s
text: actions...and turns back to Dejah:
speaker_heading: POWELL .
dialog: Everything you love will die...unless
dialog: you tell me where I find the key.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: Everything I love will die...when I do.
text: Carter stands conflicted...as Powell turns to his soldiers:
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: To my ship.
text: They haul Dejah away to the ship. Another group hauls up Sola
text: too. Powell regards them, rueful:
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Half this planet's run by savages. And
dialog: the other half, philosophers. This
dialog: world was desperate for men. Like you
dialog: and me.
scene_heading: INT. BOMBER - POWELL’S CABIN - DAY
text: Powell leads Carter into a well-appointed room --~ with military
text: charts on tables. Plates of food and drink.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Now as for “James,” you'll need to stop
dialog: with the “James.” It's “Lord Prince,”
dialog: that’s how they like it. You'll have
dialog: your own title too. It’s incredible,
dialog: isn’t it? What gravity allows us to
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: On Earth...it was only ten minutes...
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: I landed like you did, in the Paktar
dialog: Sea Beds. They were home to Zodangan
dialog: villages then -- the poorest people on
dialog: Mars. They took me in as one of their
dialog: own. With my skills, I made a natural
dialog: leader...and when I told them of their
dialog: planet's fate, the word spread. And
dialog: more villages started to follow.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Sab Than. The Desert Prophet.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Imagine it. An “Atmosphere Plant.”
dialog: Imagine all life on Earth run by an
dialog: ancient computer -~ causing famine,
dialog: floods, global warming, all of it. What
dialog: if all that could end? If we simply
dialog: opened the computer and changed the
dialog: program?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What if it can’t be changed?
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: You've spent too long with the
dialog: Princess.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What if changing it destroys the
dialog: computer?
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: We're men of action, Carter!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: It's not our place to play Gods.

dialog: “Play” Gods?! WE ARE GODS!
text: He roars it, with megalomaniacal amusement. Carter remains
text: stone-faced. Powell’s smile fades:
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: What did we ever fight for on Earth?
dialog: Religious strife, border disputes, oil
dialog: supplies. I’m talking about whether or
dialog: not a whole world survives!
dialog: (a heartfelt plea)
dialog: You're here now. We need you.
speaker_heading: Lee : CARTER
dialog: We need to go home is what we need.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: I’ve been here for one hundred and
dialog: thirty years, don’t you think I've
dialog: searched? There are no portals on
dialog: Mars. My army’s mapped every mile of
dialog: it. This is the only home we have
dialog: left!
text: He indicates his opulent cabin quarters...
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: For fifteen years, we fought for
dialog: others. You've never known what I've
dialog: known. What it’s like...to be a
dialog: leader. To be revered.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I know now.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: We were looking for treasure, John.
dialog: You can’t fault me for finding it.
text: His stare darkens. Carter shows no signs of taking his side.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: You‘re either with me or against me.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What happened to you...?
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: I‘ll leave you to the Warhoons unless
dialog: you're with me.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I thought we were friends.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: We were. But that was a short time in
dialog: my life. And a very long time ago.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We’re both Gods here John. And if
dialog: you‘re not with me, there’s only room
dialog: for one.
scene_heading: EXT. BORDER RIDGE - DAY
text: The Warhoons crowd around a bound Carter, as he’s escorted off
text: the ship. He strains for one last glimpse of Dejah (thru a
text: window) as Powell’s ship closes--
text: -~and off ‘the fear in their eyes--
text: --Carter raises a hand in farewell--
text: -~as Powell steps to Dejah’s side, with a sad, bitter gaze--
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Goodbye, my friend.
text: As the ENGINES ROAR to life, Carter's surrounded by Warhoons,
text: with the Leader scrutinizing his features...with interest. And
text: then a RIFLE BUTT comes crashing down and DARKNESS.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DUNGEON CAVERN - NIGHT
text: WAR DRUMS and FIERCE CRIES are THUNDERING from somewhere...
text: ...as Carter’s eyes flicker open. He struggles up to find
text: himself in a filthy cage made from the RIBS of zitidars. Inky
text: black stalactites and stalagmites dot this cavern.
text: He winces at his torn wound, which he tears away to reveal an
text: ugly swollen bruise. It's nowhere near healed.
text: Suddenly, there‘s a COMMOTION ahead. Four THARKS, in chains,
text: are hauled in by WARHOONS and thrown into a cell...
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS (0.S.)
dialog: Some of my best soldiers.
dialog: 82.
text: Carter spins. From the cage next to him, Tars Tarkas steps from
text: the darkness. All four of his arms in chains.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: And all for you.
text: Their cages separate them. Still, Carter steps back...
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: I swore I would kill you, Jonn-kata. It
dialog: is a promise I will keep.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What is this? A prison?
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
text: The Warhoons take no prisoners.
text: The WAR DRUMS build in volume. Faint screams from somewhere.
scene_heading: TARS TARKAS =: «.
dialog: What did you want that the Tharks
dialog: failed to offer you?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: My freedom. Have you never wanted
dialog: that?
text: Tars stares darkly.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I hear you were once an honorable
text: people. Led by more than just shame
dialog: and fear.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: A Thark fears nothing!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Your King fears everything. He
dialog: separates children from their parents,
dialog: so they have no one to fight for but
text: him. He educates his people in battle
dialog: alone. And he trusts no one who's not
dialog: a Thark.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: As he never trusted you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Unlike me.
text: Suddenly, the ROAR OF A THOUSAND WARHOON echoes through the
text: caves. The WAR DRUMS pick up the pace. Tars tenses:
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: They're coming...
scene_heading: EXT. WARHOON GAUNTLET PIT - PRE-DAWN
text: Four huge WARHOON GUARDS march Carter and Tars up a mine- shaft
text: incline. One of each man's legs are now connected by a ten-foot
text: chain. WAR DRUMS pounding up ahead--
text: --as they emerge at one end of a football-field pit of LAVA
text: ROCK. Uneven terrain, dotted with smoking FUMAROLES and
text: burbling TAR PITS -- all bordered by towering SPIRES OF BONE,
text: like a giant ribcage rising from the rock.
text: And it’s surrounded by HUNDREDS OF WARHOONS, drunk and wild. The
text: event has the rowdy, illicit atmosphere of a cockfight -- on a
text: grand scale. A BONFIRE along one wall lights the pit.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: It’s called the gauntlet. Their idea
dialog: of sport.
text: Carter and Tars are positioned inside a NEW CAGE, like a
text: racehorse’s starting gate. They're flanked by two other “teams”
text: -- one a pair of HELIUM MEN, one a pair of THARKS.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: If you make it to the other side...you
dialog: live until the next one.
text: Carter surveys the field: it's divided into three “sections,”
text: each marked with a natural ROCK PEDESTAL at the far edge. Each
text: base has a large BONE-GRATE built into the ground before it.
text: Atop the first pedestal are two SHIELDS, the second two AXES,
text: and the third -- a single BROADSWORD.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And all we have to do is run?
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: You will want to.
text: Suddenly, all the Warhoon drums suddenly STOP. And in the
text: silence, the Warhoon Leader raises a cudgel and BELLOWS!
text: AS SUDDENLY THE CAGE DOORS SNAF OPEN!
text: And the three “teams,” Tharks, Zodangans and Carter & Tars are
text: released into the arena! Ahead, the first BONE-GRATE unlocks,
dialog: splitting inward--
dialog: 84.
text: AND ALLOWING A PACK OF CALOTS TO CHARGE OUT
dialog: hurtling headlong for the teams! Nothing like Woola, these are
text: wild, mangy and starved as~-
text: --BAM! Carter gets DECKED by the Thark team and trampled -- his
text: chain goes taut and Tars hits the dirt. Angrily:
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Such a waste of my training.
text: The snarling wild calots are halfway to them...
text: ..-as the pair of Helium Men hit the calot line -- as the lead
text: Man is SNATCHED up and driven backward. His teammate dives low
text: as the calot leaps over him, DEVOURING the first -- and snapping
text: him free of the linked chain.
text: Other calots COLLIDE with the Tharks, who are wrestled down, but
text: manage to hurl the calots off and run onward--
text: --while the lone Helium Man scrambles up the first rock
text: pedestal, about to grasp the SHIELD -- only to have his trailing
text: chain SNARED by a Thark. The Tharks pull him back, hurling him
dialog: aside--
text: ~-as Carter and Tars see the ten CALOTS all charging them!
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: To the death, show no fear--
text: --as, unseen by him, Carter charges at Tars, and just as Tars
text: half-turns his way, Carter collides and GRABS HIM FAST--
text: AND TANDEM-LEAPS INTO THE AIR
text: SKYING RIGHT OVER the calots to land in a heap beyond! As the
text: ten calots reverse course, they scramble up--
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Ah. Some training after all.
text: --while the Tharks pluck the SHIELDS from the pedestal,
text: triggering the next BONE-GRATE ahead to collapse in--
scene_heading: AND TWO TIGER-LIKE BANTHS CLAMBER OUT
text: Giant, ten-legged carnivores, with thickets of razored teeth and
text: gleaming red eyes. They lumber toward the scent of prey.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Banths. Very bad...
dialog: 85.
text: As Carter and Tars watch the calots behind them DEVOUR the last
text: Helium Man, the Tharks CHARGE the banths, shields ready--
text: --until the Thark in the rear raises the razored-edge of his
text: shield and SLICES it across his partner's neck! His partner
text: falls. The Thark SLICES again, severing his ally'’s foot--
text: --and with both shields, the betrayer Thark CHARGES the banths,
text: pile-driving them with the SHIELDS and blasting a path through
text: their snapping jaws. He’s past them!
text: And as one Banth lumbers to DEVOUR the helpless other Thark, the
text: second CHARGES Carter & Tars! Carter nearly loses his
text: balance...on the edge of one of the boiling TAR PITS--
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Stand your ground.
text: When Carter tries to run, Tars holds him firm. Alarmed, he sees
text: the Banth lunge at them, jaws wide--
text: --as Tars suddenly HURLS Carter to the right and dives to the
text: left, pulling their chain taut in mid-air--
text: --as the Banth CRASHES JAWS down upon...the chain! Splitting
text: it! Carter and Tars are freed! The Banth whirls on Carter, who
text: DIVES and ROLLS, evading snapping jaws. But the Banth’s TAIL
text: whips around, knocking Carter onto his back!
text: The Banth lunges jaws again...and Carter GRABS two of its front
text: fangs! Blocking the Banth, struggling in place--
text: --and then with all his strength, PUSHING IT BACKWARDS. Like a
text: blocking sled, he edges the Banth toward the tar pit right
text: behind it. The Banth shrieks, whipping its tail--
text: --but it can’t reach Carter, as Carter drives him into the
text: boiling oil sludge tail-first. With one last leaping heave,
text: Carter upends the Banth -- BAM! -- onto its back--
text: --and leaps off as the screaming animal gets CONSUMED by the
text: smoking sludge. Carter looks to Tars...who nods approval.
text: Up ahead, the lone Thark reaches the second pedestal and the
text: SPEARS -- which trigger the final BONE-GRATE to retract--
scene_heading: AND A HULKING FOUR-ARMED SIMIAC
text: climbs from his subterranean cage. It's one of the “Giant Apes”
text: Carter fought at the Incubator, but this one is gray and twice
text: their size. He has dragon-like scales, dirty, scarred and
dialog: feral. He's the Warhoons’ prize fighter.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: These guys. I hate these guys...
text: The lone Thark is now armed to the teeth -- with two spears and
text: two shields. He's ready for the Simiac’s CHARGE--
text: --and as he hurls his spears, PIERCING the Simiac, it never
text: slows, grabbing all four of the Thark’s arms and SNAPPING them
text: off. He then grabs the shocked Thark by the torso--
text: --and shovels him into his mouth like a living hot dog. The
text: Simiac wolfs down the Thark in seconds flat. He plucks out the
text: spears like they're splinters...
text: ...and then his gaze finds Carter and Tars.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Killed one once, didn‘t I?
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Yes. But that was a girl.
text: At the sight of the Simiac, the remaining Banth and Calots skulk
text: away, cowering. The Warhoon crowd GOES WILD...
text: BACK IN THE GAUNTLET PIT
text: Carter spies the huge BONE SPIRES bordering the pit, an idea
text: forming. He spots the sword on the final rock pillar...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: We're in this together, aren’t we?
text: Tars says nothing...as they lock eyes--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I need that sword.
text: --and the Simiac CHARGES! Carter grabs the two SHIELDS from the
text: fallen Thark-limbs. He LEAPS ASIDE as the Simiac swipes--
text: --and lands near the BONFIRE WALL bordering this section of the
text: course. Carter dips the shields in a TAR PIT and then touches
dialog: them to the bonfire--
text: --and the SHIELDS are aflame! He now stalks the Simiac -- and
text: as it throws FISTS, Carter blocks them with the FLAMING SHIELDS,
text: causing the beast's paws to catch fire!
text: But the Simiac seems unfazed, hurling now-FLAMING FISTS at
text: Carter. Each impact knocks Carter yards backward, forcing him
text: to scramble up. His shields go flying--
dialog: 87.
text: --as with the diversion, Tars has a clear path to the pedestal.
text: He scrambles up, grabbing the SWORD.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Jonn-kata!
text: He hurls it...and Carter leaps, landing beside a tar pit and
text: dipping the blade in tar just as the Simiac’s upon him--
text: --and Carter meets its flaming fist with the sword -- which
text: catches the SWORD AFLAME! With both hands, Carter slashes and
text: parries, fending off the beast‘s blows--
text: --and then leaps straight up, to eye-level, and SLASHES OUT the
text: Simiac’s eyes with a last FIERY SWING.
text: Blinded, it HOWLS, stumbling back...right into the BONFIRE WALL!
text: Its whole body LIGHTS UP, consumed by fire-~
text: --as its arms flail -- BAM! BAM! -- colliding with one of the
text: tall bone spires...and cracking it...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Is that all you've got! IS THAT ALL
dialog: YOU'VE GOT?!
text: --and as the dying Simiac continues flailing and battering--
scene_heading: THE CURVED BONE SPIRE CRACKS FREE
text: Toppling backwards like a tree felled at the trunk...to BRACE
text: against the side of the gauntlet pit! Like a ramp out!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Go, go, go!
text: Seizing the chance, Carter and Tars race up the bone spire--
scene_heading: EXT. ROCK BADLANDS - ABOVE THE PIT
text: --and find themselves on a table-land with a some mangy THOATS
text: and ZITIDARS tethered to a makeshift hitching post. Tars pulls
text: Carter to a sudden stop...and directs his gaze...
scene_heading: EXT. GAUNTLET PIT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Furious Warhoons CHARGE OUT of the pit, scaling ladders, only to
text: be brushed back by the FLAPPING WINGS of a MALAGOR--
text: WITH TARS AND CARTER AT THE REINS
text: As they evade the RIFLE BLASTS of the vanishing Warhoons--
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Thought you were gonna kill me.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: First things first.
text: --as they soar ever-higher, to give us a new vantage of the
text: Gauntlet Pit...where all those bone-spires form the RIBCAGE of a
scene_heading: GARGANTUAN SKELETON. A prehistoric MARTIAN WHALE.
text: BACK AT THE PIT’S EDGE
text: While Warhoons roar with rage, they charge across the table-
text: land -- and then several suddenly COLLIDE and fall back-~
text: --as if they've hit something invisible...which they have. A
text: RIPPLING HEAT-MIRAGE turns into a ZODANGAN ASSAULT FLIER as its
text: engines FIRE. Two PILOTS have been lying in wait--
speaker_heading: ZODANGAN PILOT
dialog: Alert the Prince.
scene_heading: EXT. MARTIAN CANYONS - DAY - LATER
text: Towering cliffs of rock, miles high, flank a long-dry
text: riverbed...as the Malagor SOARS through a narrow pass...where
text: there are ominous STORMCLOUDS on the horizon...
text: -.-and now the Malagor suddenly SHRIEKS, tugging at its reins.
text: Tars struggles to keep it flying level--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What's wrong?!
text: Tars’ eyes narrow, at the darkening skies:
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: There's something...out there...
text: And as they stare at the OMINOUS CANOPY ahead, they watch the
text: image ripple slightly, as if there’s a MIRAGE in front...getting
text: closer...the mirage of a small airship...
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: GET DOWN!
scene_heading: AND SUDDENLY BLUE RADIUM BOLTS OPEN FIRE
text: from nowhere! The Malagor dives low, evading as the ASSAULT
text: FLIER zips past, again MATERIALIZING INTO VIEW--~
text: --as do its two Pilots at the open-air ship's controls. Their
text: ship BANKS in pursuit of the Malagor.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: It is a Zodangan Assault Flier! We
dialog: will never outrun it! We have to get
dialog: to the clouds!
scene_heading: EXT. MARTIAN SKIES - IN DARKENING CLOUDSCAPE
text: The Malagor SOARS into the ominous clouds, wisps of heavy gray.
text: Winds whip harder here, buffeting them all.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You're taking us into a storm!
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: They will never follow! This is no
dialog: storm, Jonn-kata -- it is where all our
dialog: weather starts!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (in amazement)
dialog: The Atmosphere Plant?!
text: Tars nods. They look back to see the Assault Flier sweep
text: through rumbling clouds, DIVING toward them.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And they'll never follow, huh?
text: The Flier OPENS FIRE -- as RADIUM-BOLTS rip into the Malagor’s
text: WINGS, shredding and smoking them! The creature WAILS, as Tars
dialog: drives it through more clouds--
text: --as they watch the diving Flier DROP AWAY and disappear into
dialog: the gray cirrus below--
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Take the reins! Pull these to dive --
dialog: on my signal!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What about you?!
text: Tars weighs him with a grudging smile:
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: On my signal...
text: He edges out to the Malagor’s wing, and spots a GLIMPSE of the
text: Assault Flier through the clouds below--
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: NOW!
dialog: 90.
text: --and Carter pulls hard on the low reins, forcing the Malagor’s
text: chin down and DIVE-BOMBING--
text: --to FLASH RIGHT PAST the Assault Flier as Tars LEAPS OFF--
text: AND TACKLES THE PILOTS ABOARD THEIR FLIER
text: to their shock, as Tars’ four arms sweep them all overboard, as
text: they FALL THROUGH THE CLOUDS, guns firing--
text: --while Tars just barely manages to hang on to the side of the
text: Flier, which wobbles badly, going down--
scene_heading: AS ABOARD THE MALAGOR
text: Carter loses sight of Tars. He’s hit by a GUST of turbulence as
text: the Malagor WAILS, its strength giving out. Carter tugs at the
text: reins, but the beast stops flapping--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No! Hang on! C'mon, HANG ON!
text: --as they cut through the clouds, lower and lower, until
text: suddenly huge DUNES OF BLACK SAND rise up dead ahead...and the
text: Malagor CRASHES to Earth and the whole world goes DARK!
scene_heading: EXT. MARTIAN VALLEY ~ DAY
text: ANGLE SOARS above the BLACK SMOKE and RUBBLE that once was a
text: small Helium farming community. Destroyed by Zodanga’s forces.
text: A ribbon of REFUGEES trudges across the land...
scene_heading: INT. POWELL'S AIRSHIP
text: +..as Dejah watches from the window of Powell’s quarters. He
text: sits in his captain-like chair:
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: Tell me, “James Powell.” What sort of
dialog: man sends his friend to his death?
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: You send an entire people. Their fate
dialog: is sealed -~ and yet you ask them to
dialog: fight.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: I ask them to follow their conscience.
text: Powell rises and approaches her as she presses...
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: For millennia, our meager resources
dialog: have been shared among us all.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: DEJAH (cont'd)
dialog: We've rationed and conserved. And then
dialog: you arrive...to say no such sacrifices
dialog: must be made.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Despite the fact you have no proof.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: I will. Once I have your key.
text: He stands close. She holds her ground.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Wherever it’s hidden, you will tell me.
dialog: The war ends the moment you do.
text: He reaches for her hand, raises it...and presses his lips.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: I taste blood on them, princess.
text: He exits, leaving her alone at the window. She stares out again
text: at the column of refugees...and places a hand to her stomach,
text: lifting the edge of her clothes--
text: ~-to reveal that the gold royal crest that pierces her navel is
text: empty. The inset DIAMOND STONE is gone.
scene_heading: EXT. MARTIAN ASH BADLANDS - DAY
text: STORMCLOUDS surround...with FLASHES OF HEAT LIGHTNING on the
text: horizon, as amidst dunes of VOLCANIC ASH...rests a dead Malagor,
text: half-buried.
text: From beneath one of its wines... struggles a battered, ash-
text: covered Carter. But he’s alive. He surveys the clouds...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Tars Tarkas?! TARS TARKAS!!!
text: But only wind HOWLS back. So he crawls up the dune...where he’s
text: confronted with a black desert vista...
scene_heading: EXT. ASH BADLANDS - DAY - MCNTAGE
text: From a high vantage, Carter trudges ahead through FIERCE WIND
text: and SWIRLING BLACK ASH -- i:so:0ssibly harsh conditions. The
text: THUNDER is ominous and constant...
text: He keeps struggling onward, 2s FORKS OF LIGHTNING connect with
text: an ash dune peak in the dis*ance...
text: In the midst of the tempest, he falls to his knees, bracing his
text: body, pounded by SWIRLING :°‘i...as he starts to crawl forward,
text: hand-over-struggling-hand...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
scene_heading: EXT. ASH BADLANDS ~ DAY - END MONTAGE
text: Carter's eyes snap open, battered by the gale. He's collapsed
text: from exhaustion. And yet a mere few yards ahead...
scene_heading: THERE'S A SINGLE BLUE FLOWER
text: poking out of the ash. Weakly, Carter pulls himself toward it,
text: and as he reaches for the flower~-
text: --his hand passes through a curtain of ash...to touch the flower
text: on the other side. Where the air is still.
text: Carter drags himself forward, through the weather “curtain”--
text: TO FIND HIMSELF IN A FIELD OF BLUE FLOWERS
text: In a grassy expanse, utterly calm, and towering above him--
text: IS THE ATMOSPHERE PLANT
text: A GIANT COLUMN of twisting white clouds rises three miles into
text: the air from it, feeding the very atmosphere of Mars. It's like
text: the eye of a hurricane. Storm winds swirl all around it, but
text: here -- on the inside -- all is calm. The sheer metal edifice
text: ‘has no doors, no windows. No way inside.
text: Awestruck, Carter staggers to the wall of the building -- which
text: covers four square miles and towers two hundred feet. He sinks
text: to the ground, exhausted...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: The whole war...over this...
text: He laughs ruefully, delirious from his trek. His laughter
text: convulses his body -- he winces, holding his wound. And then he
text: keels over. The wound is really hurting him now--
text: --and as he looks down, he sees a STRANGE GLOW coming from his
text: side, like a hot coal inside his skin, as his scar starts to
text: split apart. His flesh grows WHITE HOT--
text: AND A WIDE BEAM OF BLINDING LIGHT
text: SEARS out from his side, “projecting” on the wall of the plant
text: like a CURTAIN OF ENERGY, which causes a DOOR-SIZED SECTION of
text: the wall to RIPPLE INTO VIEW--
text: --and then the section of wall VANISHES as if it were never
text: there, revealing a long silver corridor!
text: And the BEAM OF LIGHT cuts off, leaving a WHITE HOT INGOT in
text: Carter’s side as it slips free out of the wound--
dialog: 93.
text: -- al itse to be Dejah‘s DIAMOND ‘ONE. It hits the
text: ground and cools, all its energy receding.
text: Carter stares in complete amazement...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: The key.
scene_heading: INT. SILVER CORRIDOR
text: A long hall, with another RIPPLING “DOOR” at the end. It’s like
text: an airlock -- between a space where the laws of physics apply
dialog: and another where they don't.
text: And as Carter walks through, clutching the “key” in his
text: hand...his WOUNDS mysteriously heal, his skin is CLEANED of
text: ash...and his limping gait becomes strong and sturdy...as he
text: passes through the beckoning “ripple”~-
scene_heading: INT. ATMOSPHERE PLANT
text: --into the plant itself. He finds himself on a balcony,
text: overlooking a METROPOLIS-SIZED EXPANSE OF MACHINERY. It extends
text: for miles ahead, miles above and miles below.
text: And as he turns to where he expects the “door” to be, he finds
text: it extends for miles behind hin.
speaker_heading: A VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Welcome, John Carter.
text: Carter spins back to see a TINY OLD MAN in a cloak, inches away
text: from his face, seemingly hovering above the machinery chasm.
text: He's impossibly aged, nearly mummified, but with a slightly
text: enlarged head and features...and white skin.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Who...are you...
speaker_heading: THE OROVAR (V.O.)
dialog: The one who remained.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: On all our worlds, there is always one
dialog: who remains.
text: Carter reacts, incredulous. The man’s mouth has not moved. He
text: speaks telepathically.
speaker_heading: THE OROVAR (V.O.)
dialog: I am the last of the Orovars.
text: The little man hovers before him. Expressionless.
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You...you run the Plant?
speaker_heading: THE OROVAR (V.O.)
dialog: It runs itself. I merely stay.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: THE OROVAR (V.O.)
dialog: In the event we ever must come back, I
dialog: must let the others know. That Mars is
dialog: safe. That life goes on.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It is the same with your planet Earth.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You know where I'm from...
text: The Orovar nods sagely.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What else do you know?
speaker_heading: THE OROVAR (V.O.)
dialog: That you wish to return.
text: With that, the Orovar waves a slow hand...
text: With a familiar HUM, a TRANSLUCENT PEDESTAL rises from the
text: depths of the plant -- until it’s level with their platform.
text: Then a CANOPY OF RED FIRE-GEM CRYSTALS shimmers into view all
text: around it -- just like the portal chamber in the cave.
speaker_heading: THE OROVAR (V.O.)
dialog: Our pathways were never meant to be
dialog: discovered. Our worlds should never
dialog: have crossed.
text: With another wave, a HOLOGRAM WALKWAY, like a shimmering plank
text: appears -- from the platform to the pedestal.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Is that...my way home...?
speaker_heading: THE OROVAR (V.O.)
dialog: Your way is of your own volition.
text: He motions Carter onto the holo-walk. Carter takes a step --
text: it‘'s translucent and shimmering, but it's solid.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I don't understand. If you Orovars can
dialog: create worlds, create life...why don't
dialog: you interfere? With the fates you've
dialog: set in motion?
speaker_heading: THE OROVAR (V.O.)
dialog: It is our science.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And your planets are...experiments?
speaker_heading: THE OROVAR (V.O.)
dialog: That we may one day know the essential
dialog: nature...of whatever intelligence
dialog: created us.
text: Carter advances, nearing the portal. But then...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What will happen if Powell takes over
dialog: the Atmosphere Plant?
speaker_heading: THE OROVAR (V.O.)
dialog: To attempt to control it will be to
dialog: destroy it.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Then you'll stop him.
speaker_heading: THE OROVAR (V.O.)
text: One does not stop an experiment.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You'll just stand by? You’ll just
dialog: watch this planet die?
text: The Orovar stares patiently. As if dealing with a child.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I helped start this war. You know
dialog: that? It’s my fault he’s here.
speaker_heading: THE OROVAR (V.0O.)
dialog: In science, there are causes. There is
dialog: no such thing as fault.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Someone has to tell him! That all this
dialog: can't be controlled! Someone has to
dialog: stop him!
text: Carter stares at the diamond stone in his hand...
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What if the key remains inside the
dialog: Plant?
speaker_heading: THE OROVAR (V.0.)
text: It is one. It is not the only.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Goddammit! Don’t you know what's
dialog: happening?! There’s a war out there
dialog: and millions are dying! Why won't you
dialog: involve yourself?!
speaker_heading: THE OROVAR (V.O.)
dialog: Why won't you.
text: He speaks without judgement. Carter despairs, looks to the
text: portal. The beckoning crystals...the way home...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And would I survive? Would she?
text: The Orovar says nothing.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I’m one man. What can I do?
speaker_heading: THE OROVAR (V.O.)
dialog: Yes, John Carter. Forever and always.
dialog: That is the experiment.
text: With a heavy sigh, Carter sets his jaw...and steps to the
text: pedestal. The crystal canopy begins to GLOW, and a HUM rises.
text: The Orovar lifts a farewell hand...
text: The HUM grows deafening. The crystals BLAZE RED. And Carter's
text: conflicted face is bathed in a BLINDING GLOW...
scene_heading: EXT. ATMOSPHERE PLANT - DUSK
text: The field of blue flowers is serene and still...as a pair of
text: BOOTS step out from the plant. _ Carter emerges...
text: .+-and turns to see the Orovar in the RIPPLING “doorway.”
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Never leave a man behind.
text: The little man hovers with a faint smile on his face. Scientific
dialog: interest? Envy? Pride?
speaker_heading: THE OROVAR (V.O.)
dialog: Look to the southwest skies.
dialog: 97.
text: And then the “doorway” turns opaque...and is a wall again.
text: Carter turns to the “curtain” of weather...starting to regret
text: his choice...and now stares skyward, hearing faintly...
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS (0.S.)
dialog: Jonn-kata, are you out there?! CAN YOU
dialog: HEAR ME?!
scene_heading: EXT. ASH BADLANDS - IN THE SKIES
text: Amidst the stormclouds, the Zodangan Assault Flier HOVERS...with
text: Tars Tarkas at the helm. He struggles to control the ship as
text: his SEARCHLIGHT sweeps the dunes--
text: --and now illuminates Carter rushing into view, waving arms to
text: signal. With amazement, Tars broadly smiles...
scene_heading: EXT. EDGE OF BADLANDS - DUSK
text: From the STORM CLOUDS, the Assault Flier SHOOTS away, flanked by
text: flares of LIGHTNING...with Tars and Carter aboard.
text: Tars turns to see Carter staring at the receding storm.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: What happened to you back there?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (a distant stare)
dialog: I saw my future.
text: Tars turns back to the flier’s controls, smoke pours from its
text: underside as the engines STRAIN.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Why did you come back?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I saw a friend in trouble.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: A...friend...
text: Tars frowns as if it’s a word he’s only heard about.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: I have ten thoats, Jonn-kata; you may
dialog: take your choice from among them, and I
dialog: will accompany you to the nearest
text: waterway that leads to Helium.
dialog: (off Carters look)
text: Tars Tarkas may be a cruel warrior, but
dialog: he can be a friend as well.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And what happens when you return to
dialog: Thark without me?
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Death, possibly, or worse.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Is this not a choice “friends” make?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Why do you fight for him?
text: The great Thark stops. Something registers.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
text: A soldier follows orders.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: From the Thark who killed his family?
text: Tars' eyes narrow suddenly.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I know about her, General. How she
dialog: kept your name a secret. How she died
dialog: to save you and your child.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: No...you know nothing...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I know you once fought for her. You
dialog: once fought for love.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: YOU KNOW NOTHING!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I heard the story from your daughter
dialog: herself. From Sola.
text: Turning toward him, Tars suddenly stops as if shot.
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: She’s a prisoner of Zodanga -- along
text: with the princess. She believes in a
dialog: better way for her people.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Sola?
text: Tars wears a distant, dark stare.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: On my planet, armies march for flags
dialog: and leaders. But we fight for our
dialog: family and our children. I know of no
dialog: greater honor than that.
text: Tars looks as if he’ll kill Carter then and there. But instead,
text: he turns away...
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: I have orders, Jonn-kata. To return to
dialog: Thark.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Then we go together.
text: Tars stops. Looks back.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And you can watch one more life end for
dialog: you.
text: Tars turns away and stares over the bow...at another Helium
text: FARMING SETTLEMENT below -- all skeletons and scorched earth
dialog: now.
text: And off the dark look in Tars’ eyes...
scene_heading: EXT. CITY OF THARK - DAY
text: The Assault Flier SOARS across the desert. Atop a city wall,
text: CANNON GUNNERS draw a bead...until they hear a distinctive Thark
text: HORN. And now see Tars Tarkas at the helm...
scene_heading: INT. WAR COUNCIL ROTUNDA - DAY
text: The War Council is in session, with Tal Hajus slumped in his
text: central pulpit. An elder Councilor is speaking--
speaker_heading: THARK ELDER
dialog: But my King, the desert wells will not
dialog: sustain us. And Zodanga refuses us
dialog: fair rates of trade--
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: Tharks will survive! We have always
dialog: survived! Let the red men slaughter
dialog: each other and we will remain--
text: Suddenly, the doors THUNDER open as a Thark GUARD races in--
speaker_heading: THARK GUARD
dialog: A Zodangan ship--!
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: A war council is in session--!
speaker_heading: THARK GUARD
dialog: It is General Tarkas!
text: A MURMUR in the room. Hajus’ face falls...as suddenly a THOAT
text: rides right in to the council chamber, with Tars Tarkas and
text: Carter his prisoner. Tars dismounts, hauls Carter down-~-
text: --spilling him to the floor, hands bound, before the council.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
text: He is found.
text: Hajus scowls to see Tars alive...but hides his displeasure.
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: Then let us have his execution.
speaker_heading: / CARTER . ,
dialog: I’ demand the right to speak:
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: (to Tars)
text: Cut him apart. First his tongue.
text: Tars hesitates. Tal Hajus eyes’ narrow with suspicion.
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: General Tarkas--
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
text: He is still a Thark. Last words are
dialog: his right.
text: Hajus glowers, feeling the stare of the War Councilors.
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: Speak. Then you die.
text: Carter slowly stands, and faces.the Thark audience:
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Soldiers of Thark...I’ve been one among
dialog: you. I've fought shoulder to shoulder.
dialog: You're a brave people and you love
dialog: bravery, but is that all? Tal Hajus
dialog: dreams of war -- of carnage and
dialog: suffering. While you true warriors
dialog: dream...of an end to it all.
dialog: (turns to Hajus)
dialog: You’ve made your people into an
dialog: arsenal, not an army.
speaker_heading: (MORE).
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: CARTER (cont'd)
dialog: You‘re merely weapons that kill --
dialog: without asking what you’re killing for.
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: For Thark!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Which Thark? Who? Tell me just one
dialog: name. One Thark whose life matters
dialog: more than your own.
text: All await his answer. And he has none...
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: What “one Thark”? All of Thark! Only
dialog: a child would mourn the death of just
dialog: one Thark!
dialog: (to Tars, rages)
dialog: Enough, Tarkas! Kill him! Now!
text: But Tars doesn’t move. His eyes are on Carter's.
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: I SAID KILL HIM!
text: So Hajus himself draws four BATTLE AXES and LEAPS DOWN from his
text: pulpit, only to have Tars step in front of Carter:
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: I demand Justice.
text: An astonished gasp from the room...
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: I challenge you.
text: Hajus stares, stunned...as Tars pulls his own four swords. The
dialog: whole War Council is watching...
speaker_heading: TAL HAJUS
dialog: Here is your death. -
dialog: And Hajus charges.
text: Their weapons CRASH together, with thundering two-armed swings.
text: It’s a meeting of veteran warricrs -- despite Hajus’ corpulence,
text: he's a worthy opponent. They strike and spin, powering steel
dialog: against steel--
text: --as their multi-limbs bash the BLADES back and forth. Hajus
text: charges like a wild bull, keeping Tars off-balance. He fights
text: like a Thark possessed, unbowed by any HITS that Tars lands.
dialog: He’s starting to wear Tars down-~-
dialog: 102.
text: --and KNOCKS three of his swords from his hands with a ROARING
text: sweep of his axes. Tars now holds a lone sword--
text: --and now glances to Carter, remembering their “fencing” lesson.
dialog: Tars takes a balanced stance--
text: --and as Hajus gleefully CHARGES for the kill, Tars moves back
text: on a single axis, PARRYING all four strikes with only one of his
text: own. Hajus’ last lunge leaves him off-balance--
text: --and Tars now ATTACKS, lunging forward, moving Hajus back on
text: his heels, seizing an opening, SWEEPING his sword--
text: --and he CUTS OFF the King's head. The rest of Tal Hajus slumps
text: to the floor.
text: A shocked silence in the room.
text: Then Tars turns to face the assembled THARK OFFICERS...and as he
text: does, they all kneel. For him now.
text: Tars regards the elders of the War Council. They Bow their
text: heads in deference too.
scene_heading: THARK COUNCILLOR
dialog: It is Justice...my King.
text: Finding Carter’s eyes, Tars gets a nod of gratitude and respect.
text: And Carter kneels too.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: We await your command.
scene_heading: EXT. GATES OF THARK - DAY
text: Tars Tarkas clambers atop the ruined gates, where HUNDREDS OF
text: THARKS have assembled, with more coming, as news of their new
text: King spreads. There’s excitement in the air...
text: -.-and from around a corner, a calot comes running at full-
text: speed, just as Carter turns in amazement--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Woola...?!
text: --as Woola, alive and well, tackles him to the ground, slurping
text: him with a grotesque tongue! He‘s streaked with SCARS from the
text: radium bolt. But loyal and overjoyed...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yeah, okay, okay -- I’m happy to see
dialog: you too, yeah, all right...
text: And as he struggles up, Tars address the growing crowd:
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Soldiers of Thark! Our planet has long
dialog: been dying, yet forever have the Tharks
dialog: survived! And forever more we will.
dialog: But only if Zodanga falls. For they
dialog: fight for a fantasy...that will destroy
dialog: us all.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The peaceful people of Helium shall
dialog: never defeat Zodanga alone, nor will
dialog: we, but together...there is hope.
text: He trails off, surveying the stone Thark faces. No signs of
text: like minds. But still, he tries:
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Tharks have never made alliances, and
dialog: this is not our war. I will not
dialog: command you to go. However, any Thark
dialog: who volunteers...
text: He looks to Carter below, in the gateway:
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: -.-we'll take him.
text: A moment‘s silence, and then one of Tars’ senior officers, Major
text: Jakkal, steps up beside Carter.
speaker_heading: MAJOR JAKKAL
dialog: We will take him.
text: And then a boyish young Thark Captain joins the group...
speaker_heading: THARK CAPTAIN
dialog: We will take him.
text: .--and now the words start to spread into the crowd, like a
text: rallying cry, as swords are lifted...
scene_heading: THARK SOLDIERS
dialog: We will take him./We will take him! We
dialog: will take him!/WE WILL TAKE HIM!
text: And as the cries build to a deafening THUNDER, with swords and
text: pikes thrust into the air, Tars meets Carter's eyes...
scene_heading: EXT. ZITIDAR MOSQUE - DAY
text: The great doors are thrown open, casting light on the mighty
text: pack-animal ZITIDARS as THARKS rush in to prepare them.
dialog: 104.
scene_heading: INT. WEAPONS MUSEUM ROOM - DAY
text: THARKS swarm the weapons cases, piling armfuls of blades, guns
text: and armaments. Girding for war.
scene_heading: EXT. PLAZA LANDING - DAY
text: BLACK-AND-GREEN FLAGS whip in the wind -- standards held by SIX
text: THARK RIDERS on thoats. Tars paces before them, with Carter and
dialog: War Councilors nearby:
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Our city alone willbe no match. There
dialog: are six other tribes of Tharks amidst
dialog: the desert. You must enlist as many as
dialog: you can.
scene_heading: THARK COUNCILLOR
dialog: They have never fought under a common
dialog: flag, my King.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: It is not a flag they will fight for.
text: He spins back to the contigent of riders, bellowing:
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Tell them Tars Tarkas will be the first
dialog: into battle! With or without them!
dialog: For he would rather fight and die, then
dialog: to wish that fate upon his children!
dialog: Tell them the great city of Thark
dialog: fights for no flag, but for our mothers
dialog: and fathers, our daughters and sons!
text: MAY WE ONCE MORE PRAISE THEIR NAMES!
text: He raises high his sword...and the riders SPUR their mounts,
text: galloping off with vigor and purpose.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT BEYOND THARK
text: The SIX RIDERS gallop out of the city gates, immediately fanning
text: out to ride in different directions...charging and vanishing
text: into six furious clouds of sand:
scene_heading: EXT. WAR PALACE PLAZA
text: Carter, Tars, Jakkal and other officers stride into the plaza to
text: see A THOUSAND THARKS standing in formation.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: March them for Helium by the Kabar
dialog: Pass. Save your best fifty for me. We
dialog: take the Old Canal Road.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: JAKKAL
dialog: But that leads to Zodanga...
text: Tars nods to Carter, then addresses his officers:
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
text: Jonn-kata has a friend to find.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And I have a daughter to save.
scene_heading: EXT. SKIES ABOVE ZODANGA - DAY
text: Zodangan CARRIER SHIPS and FIGHTERS take off for the front,
text: leaving the murky city...as ANGLE closes on its castle...
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE ZODANGA - WAR ROOM ~ DAY
text: Officers and soldiers are busy with maps and screens -- of LIVE
text: IMAGES of the Assault on Helium. Its patchwork force shield is
text: severely damaged. The bombardment is relentless...
text: ...and on the room's bridge level, Dejah sits prisoner, watching
text: the destruction with tears in her eyes. To the side sits Sola,
text: heavily chained and flanked by GUARDS.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: How much more death are you willing to
dialog: witness, princess?
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: One.
text: She stares daggers. Powell smiles thinly. He motions to a
text: TECHNICIAN, who brings up on-screen images of three floating
text: Helium AIRSHIPS, apparently taken captive.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: We captured these refugee ships en
dialog: route to your polar outposts. Tell me
dialog: what I want and I will spare them.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Where is the key?
text: Dejah watches the screen, says nothing. This destroys her...
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: (to an Officer)
dialog: Detonate.
text: On screen, one of the refugee ships EXPLODES. Two remain.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Where is the key?
dialog: 106.
text: Dejah shuts her eyes. A tear rolls down her cheek.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: (to the Officer)
dialog: Detonate.
text: On screen, the second refugee ship EXPLODES. One now left.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: On Earth, there was once a great war --
dialog: a war for the whole world. Do you know
dialog: what it took to end it? The death of
dialog: innocents. Of whole cities. And if
dialog: that's what Mars requires ...
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: I only take your lives to save them.
text: More tears roll down Dejah’s face. Powell turns to his Officer,
dialog: to give the last command, when--
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: Princess! :
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: (hisses)
dialog: Silence!
text: Powell stops. He studies the look that passes between them
dialog: the revelation dawns...
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: You know...
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: The Thark knows.
text: Sola looks wary. Dejah glares a look of resolve.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Tell me the key’s location, Thark...
text: and the princess lives.
text: Powell draws his sword and puts it to Dejah’s throat.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: Silence, Sola! I command you!
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Tell me.
dialog: ++-AS
text: Sola's torn. Dejah’s stare is resolute. And as Powell presses
text: the swordpoint, drawing blood...
speaker_heading: SOLA
text: Jonn-kata. Jonn-kata has the key.
dialog: 107.
text: And off Powell's astonished look...
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF ZODANGA - GROUND LEVEL - DAY
text: A Zodangan FLIER passes, on patrol... as Woola pops into view
text: from a ROCK OUTCROP. He surveys the distant thicket of “stilts”
text: reaching high into the noxious clouds--
dialog: --and woola-woola-woolas that the coast is clear to Carter, Tars
text: and the fifty-Thark STRIKE FORCE laying in wait. Tharks unfurl
text: TENTED CAGES atop two ZITIDARS-~-
text: --to reveal MALAGORS inside. A way to reach the skies.
scene_heading: EXT. SKIES OF ZODANGA - MOMENTS LATER
text: Among the stilts, four Malagors SOAR into the clouds -- each
text: ferrying ten Tharks, faces shielded by scarves--
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Do not breathe until we are past the
dialog: red men’s poisons...
text: --and Carter presses a scarf over his face too as they enter the
text: PLUMES of GRAY and BROWN...
scene_heading: INT. WAR ROOM - SAME
text: Where Powell now approaches Sola with the sword...
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: Jonn-kata was hurt in our escape. When
dialog: the princess tended to his wound, she
dialog: placed the stone from her royal crest
text: inside it.
dialog: (looks away)
dialog: She does not know I saw her...
text: Powell’s stunned. He marches to Dejah and rips her silks aside,
text: to reveal the gold mounting at her navel. Empty of its diamond
dialog: stone.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: You had your key.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: You entrusted this planet to him?
text: He's ready to strike her -- then spins to his officers:
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Send ships back to Warhoon lands! Talk
dialog: to every single savage and find the
dialog: Earth Man's grave!
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: What makes you so sure he has one...
scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE ZODANGA - IN THE SKIES
text: Amidst the THUNDEROUS deployment of further troops -- unseen and
text: whisper-quiet -- the Malagors ASCEND to castle level--
text: --encountering a trio of LOK-WING GLIDERS on patrol, but before
text: the shocked Pilots can sound an alarm, Thark ARCHERS shoot them
dialog: from the skies!
text: The Malagors land on the parapets of Castle Zodanga, as the
text: Thark strike force leaps off and slips into the shadows. With
text: Tars, Carter and Woola among them...
scene_heading: INT. WAR ROOM - DAY
text: Powell stalks toward Dejah...
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: There was a time I envisioned a future
dialog: for us, Princess. A peaceful union of
dialog: our cities. You and I, side by side.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But I learned one thing on Earth. Peace
dialog: is the time between wars. It’s never
text: the end in itself.
text: He draws his sword as he’s almost there...
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: We're at war, Princess. You are my
dialog: enemy. This is your end.
text: And as he raises his sword high to strike her down--
speaker_heading: CARTER (0.S.)
dialog: Princess of Helium!
text: Powell spins to the far doors to the war room...where Carter
text: stands alone, radium pistol aimed right at him...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Your mission is accomplished.
text: The entire room of officers and technicians is momentarily
text: frozen. One man? Alone? And then they watch as Tars Tarkas
text: step to his side. And then two more Tharks. And then ten. And
dialog: as Powell realizes--
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: THARKS!!!
dialog: 109.
text: THE FIFTY THARKS COME STORMING IN
text: From all entrances, causing INSTANT CHAOS! They slash SWORDS
text: and throw SPEARS ~- four at a time -- taking down the Zodangans
text: who scramble for guns.
text: Carter FIRES and Powell dives aside. Dejah tries to run but
text: Powell LEAPS across the bridge level and grabs her--
text: --as Carter LEAPS in kind, up to the bridge level, while
text: Zodangans and Tharks BATTLE it out on the level below. Powell
dialog: has Dejah held before him as a shield--
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Her life for the key, Carter!
text: Sola’s two guards have pistols drawn, aimed at Carter. Carter's
text: pistol is on Powell. And Powell‘s sword is at Dejah’s throat.
dialog: It’s a standoff.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Her life for the key...
text: Carter wavers, and then retrieves a small POUCH--
speaker_heading: DEJAH
speaker_heading: NO, JOHN!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Release her first.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: The key first.
text: They stare each other down, as Carter relents and tosses the
text: pouch...as Powell hurls Dejah aside -- but backwards -- into the
text: arms of his guards! Powell snares the pouch--
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: Noll:
text: --as it opens...and out falls a U.S. Army CONCUSSION GRENADE.
text: Powell's face falls as he immediately spins and LEAPS--
text: --as the grenade DETONATES, propelling his “leap” with double
text: force, smashing him into the screens of the War Room. Dejah,
text: Sola and the guards are all thrown backwards--
text: --with Sola blown off the bridge level, down to the technical
text: area where the Zodangan/Thark MELEE is in full force--
text: --while Dejah is blown into a dcorway. She scrambles up and
text: runs, with the stunned guards in pursuit--
dialog: 110.
text: --as Carter springs up FIRING at Powell, who GAMBOLS to a high
text: catwalk, as nimble and agile as Carter -- and he’s gone. Carter
text: looks back to the Tharks--
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Save the princess, Jonn-~kata!
text: --and so he races for the exit corridor--
text: --while Tars SLASHES on, with Tharks swiftly taking control of
text: the room. RADIUM SHOTS fire and a few Tharks fall, but most CUT
text: DOWN the Zodangans like wheat. Woola runs wild...
text: ..-and as Tars MOWS through Zodangans, he reaches the back of
text: the room, where fallen Sola lies unconscious, still chained.
text: Tars stops still at the sight of her. He’s overcome with buried
text: emotion -- and collapses to her side--
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Sola...Sola, hear me...
text: He brushes her face, as her eyes flutter open. She starts to
text: brighten, then troubled, looks away--
speaker_heading: SOLA
dialog: I‘ve betrayed you, General...
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: And I you, my child.
dialog: And off her astonishment...
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: Princess of Thark.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRSHIP DOCK - CASTLE - DAY
text: Dejah outruns the Guards to the docking station for Powell's
text: Bomber Ship. An access door LOCKS behind her, leaving the
text: guards on the other side...and as she thinks she’s safe--
text: --Powell suddenly DROPS into view from high above.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Time to pay, Princess.
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE CORRIDOR
text: Carter races in pursuit, seeing the Guards struggling with the
text: access door. And just as it starts to rise--
dialog: lil.
text: --Carter OPENS FIRE, with RADIUM BOLTS felling the Guards as he
text: races toward them, hearing the RUMBLE of engines-—-~
scene_heading: INT. POWELL’S BOMBER
text: --as Powell’s at the controls, hurling Dejah to the floor as the
text: ship RUMBLES to life. When he turns his back, Dejah races for
text: the open entry hatch, but she's too late--
text: --just as the Bomber Ship LIFTS OFF--
scene_heading: EXT. AIRSHIP DOCK
text: --and Carter emerges on scene to see the ship LEAVING the dock.
text: Drifting away with an arcing turn...twenty
dialog: feet...forty...seventy...
text: --and as Carter meets Dejah‘s eyes, at the open hatchway--
text: --he never breaks stride, racing the length of the dock--
text: AND LEAPING INTO THE AIR’ “~?
text: With a hard step off the dock’s edge...skying an arc toward the
dialog: ever-departing ship--
text: --a full mile above the unseen ground below--
text: --and as his seventy-foot arc nears its end, perilously close to
text: falling short, Dejah extends both arms out the hatchway--
dialog: AND HE CATCHES THEM
text: At the very last second! Their arms lock like trapeze artists

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I don’t have to.
text: Powell frowns.
dialog: With that,
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I only have to send you home.
text: Carter pulls a SWORD...and hurls it over Powell's
text: head...to land on the “pathway” pedestal. It ACTIVATES the
dialog: “pathway”.
text: The CRYSTALS start to glow--
dialog: 127.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Say hi to Earth for me.
text: --and Carter CHARGES! Powell FIRES his rifle just as Carter
text: LEAPS overhead. Powell tries to track him but--
text: --GREEN RADIUM BOLTS explode at his feet! Tars and Dejah have
text: opened fire! Powell’s RIFLE is shot away--
text: --and Powell swiftly sweeps a helmet-visor across his face and
text: activates his armor’s “MIRAGING.” With a RIPPLE, his figure
text: becomes a near~invisible DISTORTION OF HEAT. Tars and Dejah
dialog: can’t see him...and neither can Carter as--
text: ~-a sudden CUT opens across his chest. Carter staggers, struck
text: by an invisible blade! The DISTORTION then plants a kick to his
text: chest, sending him FLYING--
text: --to CRASH-LAND within the domed “pathway” as it starts to HUM
text: and a SWIRLING WIND begins to build--
text: --as Powell's HEAT-MIRAGE, invisible sword in hand, marches
text: toward him, victorious--
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: JOHN! GET OUT OF THERE!
text: Carter struggles up, trying to pinpoint the DISTORTED AIR--
text: --as a deep GASH opens on Carter’s leg, and another GASH on an
text: arm. He‘’s getting sliced up by his invisible foe.
text: Carter retrieves his sword and tries to parry. His blade gets
text: BASHED this way and that...and then falls--
text: --as Carter feels an invisible swordpoint PRESS INTO his neck,
dialog: drawing blood--
speaker_heading: POWELL (0.S.)
dialog: Prepare to die on two planets.
text: --and as the DISTORTION OF A BLADE is drawn back--
text: --from the balcony, Tars Tarkas aims his rifle...at Carter.
speaker_heading: TARS TARKAS
dialog: He’s mine.
text: --and FIRES! Carter sees the GREEN RADIUM BOLT shooting right
text: at him! And then suddenly it DETONATES a foot from his face,
text: CRACKLING GREEN ENERGY to illuminate Powell. Shot in the back!
text: His compromised armor now fails--
dialog: 128.
text: ~--and he RE-MATERIALIZES! Carter scrambles for his sword and
text: Powell staggers back to full strength -- and their blades
text: COLLIDE! They strike and counter, slamming swords together--
text: --as the MAELSTROM of wind and light swirling around them
text: builds. The FIRE-GEMS glow hotter--
text: -~obscuring the view of Dejah and Tars from the balcony--
text: --as Powell's savage blows drive Carter back, slipping on the
text: holo-walk's edge as he loses his balance--
text: --teetering over the abyss of machinery! His sword falls! But
text: as Powell swings his blade again, Carter JUMPS, leaping over him
text: to the far side of the “pathway”--
text: --where he snares two of Tars’' SWORDS -- as they’re thrown to
text: him -- out of mid-air! Powell pauses in surprise. Carter now
text: has two swords, once in each hand--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You may have the experience. You may
dialog: own the technology. But you were never
text: trained by Tharks.
text: --and with a murderous look, he charges. Powell meets him
text: halfway, BASHING swords together, trying to fend off every two
text: blows with his lone blade, but it’s all too much as--
text: --Carter SLICES him apart and RUNS HIM THROUGH. Powell falls to
text: the ground, shocked and dying.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Goodbye, James.
text: Carter’s in the middle of the “pathway,” with a fifty-foot
text: distance separating him from Tars, Dejah and safety, with the
text: HUM growing DEAFENING and the FIRE-GEMS ever-brighter--
text: --building toward their climactic BLINDING LIGHT--
speaker_heading: DEJAH
dialog: Jump! Now! JUMP!!!
text: --and Carter does, LEAPING the gap, arcing right toward her--
text: JUST AS ENERGY BOLTS FIRE FROM THE FIRE-GEMS
text: Throughout the crystal canopy, activating, creating a WEB OF
text: LIGHT BEAMS connecting Carter, still within--
text: --and just as he reaches her -- and touches Dejah's hand--
dialog: 129.
text: --he’s suddenly jerked back into the air, toward the center of
text: the chamber as Dejah CRIES OUT and her vision of him DISAPPEARS
text: in a BLINDING BLAST OF RED!
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - STROBED IMAGES
text: A wildly kinetic series of fragmented images. Stars, comets,
text: planets, seen for only two or three frames. Like galactic
text: strobe lights. Sound ROARS and then SILENCES. We're racing
text: through a dark tunnel, with little to light our way--
text: --and as the STROBING IMAGES take the shape of a BLUE PLANET,
text: wisping clouds and a forest thicket we’re hurtling towards--
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. VIRGINIA WOODS - DAY
text: Amidst autumn leaves and barren branches, ANGLE FINDS a
text: flattened, scorched circle...within which Carter lies. He
text: struggles up, disoriented-~-
text: --and sees the body of Powell lying nearby. Carter turns him
text: over. He's made the journey too -- as a dead man.
text: Carter notes the familiar trees, leaves and sound of birds.
text: Clouds and a faint full moon in the sky...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Told you I‘d bring you home...
text: He closes Powell's eyes and then notices a cord around his neck.
text: He pulls it into view...to reveal the King’s DIAMOND STONE is
text: affixed to it.
text: Carter grips it tightly...as if wanting to hang onto a world he
text: knows he’s now lost...and then snaps it free.
scene_heading: EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - DAY
text: Carter marches up a rise, wearing the DIAMOND STONE around his
text: own neck. He tucks it beneath his shirt--
text: --as he hears SHOTS fired. Carter tenses...but then hears
text: WHOOPS and CRIES. A group of scruffy YOUNG BOYS appear atop the
text: rise, seeing him below--
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Sir! Were you in the war, sir?!
text: Confused, Carter nods. The boy grins, slaps a newspaper--
dialog: 130.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: It’s over, sir! General Lee
dialog: surrendered! We can go home!
text: The boys run off. Carter hurries up the rise and sees--
text: A HUGE FORMER BATTLEFIELD
text: At the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Where CANNONS lie
text: abandoned, and SOLDIERS in Civil War dress -- blues and grays --
text: are crossing the field to opposite sides.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: Home, he said. Home.
scene_heading: EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY
text: Carter walks among the CIVIL WAR VETERANS, incredulous...
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: It was the Virginia I had once longed
dialog: for. But it was not my time.
dialog: (beat) Toy
dialog: From that moment forth, it was ina
dialog: memory. In a dream..
text: He looks up to a mountain ridge, where there’s a small CABIN
text: high on a hill.
scene_heading: INT. MOUNTAIN CABIN - DAY
text: Carter stands in the doorway. A modest one-room cabin. Dust
text: and broken furniture. Abandoned due to the war.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: Of a life perhaps lost forever...
text: He looks again at the DIAMOND STONE around his neck.
scene_heading: INT. MOUNTAIN CABIN - TIMELAPSE - DAY
text: The cabin is furnished now. As we PICK UP Carter at a desk by
text: the window, again writing in his journal...
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.0.)
dialog: What I‘d lived through had changed me.
dialog: I was no longer like other men. The
dialog: years would pass, and they would
dialog: die...but I did not.
text: ANGLE PANS to the window and the Shenandoah Valley below, and we
text: see a TIMELAPSE VERSION of over a century of progress. Paths to
dialog: roads, horses to cars, hamlets to cities...
dialog: 131.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.0.)
dialog: The lifespan of that other world had
dialog: followed me here...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: On this planet, I now live as a
dialog: stranger.
text: And as ANGLE COMPLETES THE 360 PAN, back to the room, it’s now a
text: modern-day HOME. Decorated in an astronomy theme. Charts of the
text: solar system. Telescopes. And drawings of Thark, Helium and
dialog: Dejah...
text: ...as ANGLE returns to Carter's desk. The seat is empty. The
text: journal sits there. And now, a DOOR opens in the b.g. and a
text: FIGURE marches in, crossing to the desk--
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: But still I believe... There is a way
dialog: back. And one day...I will find it...
dialog: A way for someone to answer my call. To
dialog: my love, my friends, my home...
text: --and sets down a “Washington Post” newspaper, dated 2005, as
text: it’s thrown open to an interior page...
text: ...aS a HAND circles a minor story in the bottom corner,
dialog: headlined “7.4 Earthquake Ravages Central Africa.”
scene_heading: EXT. AFRICA - MOUNTAIN OVERLOOK - DUSK
text: A FIGURE in modern adventurer’s gear stands at a familiar jungle
text: overlook, gazing off with binoculars at a lush mountains with a
text: small black SCAR now in its side.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: I won't tell you where I’m going. I
dialog: won't tell you how to follow. But I'll
dialog: leave behind my story...for anyone who
dialog: wants to know what ever happened to
dialog: Captain John Carter.
text: The figure turns, to reveal Carter -- over a hundred years
text: later, and yet he hasn't aged a day. The DIAMOND STONE hangs
text: around his neck. He tucks it under his shirt, and has a last
text: bite of a Baby Ruth candy bar...
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: I believe in a better world. A world
text: without war. A world of peace.
text: ...and then heads for the mountain. Into the jungle. With the
text: MOON hanging brightly high above.
scene_heading: MATCH DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 132.
scene_heading: EXT. HELIUM - VALLEY OVERLOOK - NIGHT
text: Where EARTH hangs prominently in the same position, blue and
dialog: brilliant and mysterious...
text: ...being watched by silhouettes standing all together. Tars
dialog: Tarkas. Sola. Woola. And Dejah Thoris...
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: For I know, in my heart I know...
text: And now Dejah‘s SILHOUETTE edges aside...to reveal she’s holding
text: the hand of a SILHOUETTED LITTLE BOY.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: ..-my future's waiting.
text: And as a triumphant soundtrack FANFARE rises, we--
text: cuT TO BLACK.
