text: Tending to the bride are: mother MIRABELLE, a domineering

text: sister; and bridesmaid MARNEY, fetching and shallow.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I can't believe my weddin' day is
dialog: finally here. In an hour, I'll be
dialog: married to the man o' my dreams.
dialog: Somebody pinch me.
text: Charlene pinches her, hard.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Ow! I meant, figuratively.
speaker_heading: CHARLENE
dialog: I pinched your figure, didn't I?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: (pirouettes)
dialog: How do I look?
speaker_heading: MARNEY
dialog: Like you crap diamonds.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: Marney. I don't appreciate such
dialog: language in my house.
speaker_heading: MARNEY
dialog: Sorry, Mrs. M. It just sort of...
dialog: (eyes Delilah in mirror)
dialog: slid out.
text: Delilah holds... then bursts into giggles.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: (stamps her shoe)
dialog: Enough of that! This is your wedding
dialog: day for heaven's sake. Not some
text: tawdry night in a cheap motel.
dialog: Charlene, doesn't your sister look
dialog: beautiful?
speaker_heading: CHARLENE
dialog: (admitting defeat)
dialog: Yes, Momma.
text: She crouches to adjust Delilah's skirt.
speaker_heading: MARNEY
dialog: I feel like a whale in this thing,
text: just waiting to be harpooned.
speaker_heading: CHARLENE
dialog: Tell me about it.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: (pats Marney's arm)
dialog: You're not a whale, Honey.
text: She brushes past Charlene, who reddens.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: It's only for a few hours. Then
dialog: y'all can get naked, hop on an usher,
text: and jump in the pool.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: They will do no such thing.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I'm just teasin', Momma. Try and
dialog: relax. You're makin' me nervous.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
text: A bride is supposed to be nervous on
dialog: her wedding day.
speaker_heading: CHARLENE
dialog: Like it's a law or something?
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: It is a law. Your family comes
dialog: bearing gifts. Don't you want to
dialog: make a good impression on them?
speaker_heading: MARNEY
dialog: How many candle holders you figure
dialog: you'll get?
dialog: Mirabelle
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Enough to start my own cathedral.
speaker_heading: MARNEY
dialog: I'll tell you what I'd want... a
dialog: Naloni Bucintoro watch. That's right.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Aren't you forgettin' somethin'?
speaker_heading: MARNEY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Your husband, the guy you'd be
dialog: marryin'. Aren't the gifts s'posed
dialog: to be for both of you?
speaker_heading: MARNEY
dialog: Oh please. How much enjoyment is he
dialog: gonna get out of a china bowl, or a
text: crystal flute sitting in a cabinet?
dialog: So he might as well be not enjoying
dialog: something that makes me happy.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: We have a philosopher among us. Any
dialog: idea when your big day will come?
speaker_heading: MARNEY
dialog: I kicked Trent to the curb two months
dialog: ago, so it probably won't be in the
dialog: next few weeks.
text: gives Marney a look of disdain.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Serves him right for what he done.
speaker_heading: CHARLENE
dialog: What'd he do?
speaker_heading: MARNEY
dialog: Made a pass at my mother. I'm still
dialog: surprised she told me.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Should've set the bastard on fire
dialog: after somethin' like that.
speaker_heading: CHARLENE
dialog: That's not the answer. Living well's
dialog: the best revenge.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Oh? Is that what you did after
dialog: Howard?
text: Charlene narrows her eyes at Delilah and marches out.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: That was a bit below the corset,
dialog: don't you think?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I'm sorry, Momma. After today, she'll
dialog: have two weeks to get over it.
dialog: (to Marney)
dialog: "Fore I lose another bridesmaid, you
dialog: mind takin' one o' the programs down

speaker_heading: INSERT PROGRAM

scene_heading: INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - GUEST ROOM -- DAY
text: The bridegroom shadowboxes in front of a mirror. KELVIN
text: WINGFIELD, 30, the body of a flyweight, the ego of a
text: heavyweight. A pencil moustache outlines his upper lip.
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: You want some o' this? Huh? You
dialog: want some o' this, Bitch? Cuz I
dialog: know you can't handle some o' this.
text: The BEST MAN, 20s, trades barbs with three ushers: BUCK,
text: CHUCK and TUCK. They all swig longneck beers.
speaker_heading: BEST MAN
dialog: Kick that chump's ass, Kel.
text: The ushers laugh. A knock on the door.
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: Beers. Finish 'em. Now.
text: The groomsmen guzzle, toss bottles in the trash. Kelvin
text: fixes his hair in the mirror.
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: Come in.
text: Marney sashays in.
speaker_heading: MARNEY
dialog: Delilah wanted me to give you this.
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: MARNEY
dialog: The program. Can you get with it?
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: Bring it here. Let me see it.
text: He motions to his entourage to leave. Marney stomps over.
text: Best Man shuts the door on his way out.
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: I didn't get a chance to see it.
dialog: (admires his picture)
dialog: What do you think of it?
speaker_heading: MARNEY
dialog: Pretty weak if you ask me.
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: Weak? There's a word I don't like.
dialog: Especially from someone so... eye-
dialog: grabbing.
speaker_heading: MARNEY
dialog: Please. I feel like Orca coming out
dialog: of the closet in this thing.
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: No, I mean it.
speaker_heading: MARNEY
dialog: You're a good liar. I can tell.
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: I'm a fighter, Marney. I can't stand
dialog: for lies and I can't stand for
dialog: weakness. I pride myself on my
dialog: strength.
dialog: (puffs out chest)
dialog: My agility.
text: (gyrates like a
dialog: Chippendale dancer)
dialog: And my ability to... move things.
dialog: (presses his junk
dialog: against her)
text: Marney lets out a little squeak. They lock lips, grope at
text: each other like teenagers in a back seat.
text: Kelvin spins Marney around, lifts up her skirt.
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: These hoop skirts were a great idea.
dialog: Surprised there even was a war.

speaker_heading: FLOWER GIRL (0.S.)
dialog: Stop it! I'm telling!
text: Delilah scoots into the
scene_heading: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
text: just as Flower Girl slaps the RING BEARER, the seed of Chucky
text: but a smidgen taller, in the face.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Hey! Stop it you two!
text: Ring Bearer slaps Flower Girl back, knocking her down. She
text: immediately cries.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Shame on you! Don't you ever do
dialog: that again!
text: Ring Bearer farts with his mouth at Delilah and scrams.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Come back here, you! Don't you ever
dialog: hit a lady! You hear me?!
text: She stoops to Flower Girl, whose face is puffy pink.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Hey, Sweetie. It's alright. Wanna
dialog: come with me? Come on, let's go.
text: She helps her up, escorts her into
scene_heading: DELILAH'S BEDROOM
text: On the way in, Delilah swipes a hairbrush and a tissue off
text: her bureau. She directs Flower Girl to a small platform
text: that stands before an ornate full-length mirror.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: We're gonna fix you up, good as new.
dialog: (hands tissue)
dialog: Here you go, Sweetie.
text: Flower Girl wipes her eyes. Delilah stands behind her,
text: brushing her hair.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Wanna know somethin'?
speaker_heading: FLOWER GIRL
dialog: (sniffling)
dialog: What?
text: She looks up at Delilah's reflection.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I ain't ever seen a prettier flower
dialog: girl in my entire life. You know
dialog: that? 'Deed, it's true. Look at
dialog: this hair. Bet it drives all the
dialog: boys wild. They're just not sure
dialog: why yet. Wait until it gets long.
dialog: You'll have to beat 'em off with a
dialog: curlin' iron. There. All better.
dialog: Now, wanna come see me get married?
scene_heading: EXT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - BACKYARD - WEDDING TENT -- DAY
text: The Guests chat boisterously on rows of folding chairs,
text: separated by an aisle of manicured grass. A brass QUINTET
text: occupies the final row.
speaker_heading: TUBA
dialog: Try not to screw it up this time.
speaker_heading: FRENCH HORN
dialog: Blow it out your arse.
speaker_heading: CENTER STAGE
text: The MINISTER, 50s, emerges in a gray suit and red bow tie.
text: Smiles at the large gathering.
text: Kelvin appears, looking a bit disheveled, buttons his jacket.
text: The Quintet plays PRELUDE MUSIC.
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: How's it going?
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Good. Thank you for asking. Feeling
dialog: a bit nervous?
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: No, actually. I'm quite relaxed.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Splendid.
text: The PROCESSION begins.
text: Buck escorts Mirabelle and KELVIN'S MOM, 50s, a museum of
text: Silicone and collagen, to their seats in the front row.
text: Best Man follows, arm in arm with the Maid of Honor, Charlene.
text: He waves like he's just arrived on Oscar night.
text: Chuck and Tuck strut down the aisle.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You and Jezebel thinking of getting
dialog: married?
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Her name's Jesselyn, jackass.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Jesselyn Jackass. I like it.
text: The Bridesmaids, including a rumpled Marney, parade in pairs.
text: Behind them, the Ring Bearer, looking sweaty and confused.
text: And then, the Flower Girl. She freckles the aisle with
text: magnolia petals.
text: Ring Bearer turns and gives her a dirty look. She proudly
text: produces her tongue for him.
text: A pregnant pause. Anticipation builds amongst the Guests.
text: The Quintet strikes up Mendelssohn's WEDDING MARCH.
text: Delilah appears with her father, SAMUEL, 50s, silver hair
text: and a downward smile, a keeper of many secrets. The bride
text: carries a bouquet of pink magnolias.
text: They proceed down the aisle. Flashbulbs and smiles light up
text: the tent. Kelvin steals a look at Marney, who blushes.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Think they did it?
speaker_heading: BEST MAN
dialog: Course they did, look at her. She's
text: as pink as a baboon's ass.
text: The Minister turns to the Best Man, shocked.
speaker_heading: BEST MAN
dialog: Sorry, Your Honor.
text: Kelvin sneers at Mirabelle and Charlene, both looking bloated
text: and uncomfortable as they fan themselves.
text: Delilah and Samuel arrive at the altar.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Who gives this woman in marriage?
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: I do.
text: Samuel kisses Delilah's cheek, puts her hand in Kelvin's.
text: He takes a seat next to Mirabelle.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Dearly Beloved, we are gathered
dialog: together here in the sight of God to
dialog: join together this Man and this Woman
dialog: in holy Matrimony. If any man- or
dialog: woman- can show just cause, why they
dialog: may not lawfully be joined together,
dialog: let him- or her- now speak or forever
dialog: hold their peace.
text: Marney has a COUGHING fit. A murmur ripples through the
text: crowd. Delilah scowls at her.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Is she gagging on something?
speaker_heading: BEST MAN
text: But he's standing all the way over
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: BUCK
dialog: Shut up.
text: Kelvin and Delilah face each other.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Kelvin, wilt thou have this woman as
dialog: thy wedded wife, to live together
dialog: after God's ordinance in the holy
dialog: estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou love
dialog: her, comfort her, honor, and keep
dialog: her in sickness and in health; and,
dialog: forsaking all others, keep thee only
dialog: unto her, so long as ye both shall
dialog: live?
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: I... been doing some thinking.
text: GASPS from the crowd nearly bring down the tent.
speaker_heading: USHERS
dialog: Woops.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: What?
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: Look...
text: Delilah's eyes bug as Kelvin searches for the right words.
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: I'm a fighter, Delilah. I can't
dialog: stand for lies and I can't stand for
dialog: weakness. I pride myself on --
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: What in God's name are you talkin'
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: I think I got a few more good rounds
dialog: in me. And I just don't think I'm
dialog: ready to hang up my belt. Capeesh?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I'll show you capeesh.
text: She swings at him with her left. Kelvin slips her punch.
text: A right from Delilah. He slips it again.
text: She winds up and delivers a roundhouse left. Kelvin slips
text: her punch for a third time, only this time, Delilah trips on
text: her train and collapses. She CLONKS her head on the stage.
speaker_heading: GUEST
dialog: My God! Is she alright?!
text: Mirabelle faints. Delilah's out like a light. The Minister
text: stoops down to assist. He peers up at Kelvin but he's gone.
text: The bridegroom leaves with his entourage.
speaker_heading: BEST MAN
text: Another TKO from the K-man.
text: The Guests stand with their mouths agape. Some shout: "Where
dialog: are you going?" And "You forgot your bride." Children Boo.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Mirabelle holds smelling salts under Delilah's nose.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: (opens her eyes)
dialog: Yeckh, what is that? Get that thing
dialog: away from me.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: A little gratitude would be nice.
dialog: I've never done this before.
dialog: 11.
text: Delilah sits up. Nearly everyone has left. It begins to
dialog: sink in: The Wedding That Never was.
text: Charlene and Marney sit in the first row looking despondent.
text: Samuel approaches Delilah, kneels down next to her.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: Are you alright, Honeybee? Let me
dialog: help you up.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: Leave her be! She needs to do it
dialog: herself.
text: Samuel backs off.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: (slowly stands)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: You mean you don't remember? He
dialog: left you. The one wearing the tuxedo.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Thanks, Momma. That helps.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: I think Delilah could do without the
text: snide remarks right now.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: What do you know about it? Do you
dialog: know what went into putting on this
dialog: wedding day?!
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: I think I do. I paid for it.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: That's just marvelous. And what did
dialog: I invest? Nothing at all, right?!
dialog: Only the fancy wedding invitations,
dialog: and the registry, and that Godforsaken
dialog: rehearsal dinner --
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: I just think --
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: Those God-awful programs, and the
dialog: fittings, and the million alterations
dialog: on those bloody hoop skirts, and the
dialog: guest list, and the thank you cards --
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: Don't you think --
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: And the photographer, and the
dialog: videographer, and the caterer, and
dialog: the minister, and the florist, and
dialog: the band, and that fat slob chauffeur
dialog: brother of yours, AND a five thousand
dialog: dollar cake that nobody ate!
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: Yes, but, this wasn't Delilah's fault.
text: Mirabelle huffs and storms off. Samuel watches her leave.
text: He takes a seat, dizzy and disconcerted.
text: Delilah turns to her sister and Marney.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: This isn't really happenin', right?
speaker_heading: MARNEY
dialog: I'm sorry, Honey.
text: A hint of a smile appears on Charlene's face. She looks
text: away, trying to hide it.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Is somethin' funny?
speaker_heading: CHARLENE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Then why are you smilin'?
speaker_heading: CHARLENE
dialog: Nothing. It's nothing.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I bet I look pretty funny, huh?
dialog: "When Beauty Queen Weddings Go Wrong."
dialog: Right? Fox is gonna be all over my
dialog: ass now. Real funny, Charlene.
text: Charlene can't hold it any longer. She bursts out laughing.
speaker_heading: CHARLENE
dialog: I'm sorry, Delilah.
dialog: (scampers away)
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Some family.
text: Samuel gives her a pained look. Delilah sits next to Marney.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: This was so humiliatin'. There ain't
dialog: no comin' back from somethin' like
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: MARNEY
dialog: You will, Sweetie. Might not feel
dialog: like it now, but... you'll see. The
dialog: sun will come up tomorrow, right?
dialog: Isn't that what the 1i'l orphan girl
dialog: says?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I just wanna beat him senseless.
speaker_heading: MARNEY
dialog: You could do that. But that'll just
dialog: get you thrown in jail for assault
dialog: "n battery. It's not worth it.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: How could he do that to me?
speaker_heading: MARNEY
dialog: Honey, men like Kelvin are a dime a
text: baker's dozen. Crying over somebody
dialog: like that, well... that's just foolish
dialog: if you ask me. You can do better.
text: Delilah spies the wedding cake in the corner of the tent.
speaker_heading: MARNEY
dialog: I swear to you...
text: Delilah charges at the cake like a belle out of hell. She
text: flails at it, stirring up a whirlwind of icing.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: (mocking Kelvin)
dialog: You been doin' some thinkin', huh?!
dialog: You couldn't think up a brain fart!
dialog: I'll give you somethin' to think
dialog: about !
text: Strawberry mousse splatters all over her hoop skirt as she
text: punches away. Samuel buries his head in his hands.
text: Delilah snatches the figurine of Kelvin atop the cake and
text: flings it into the trees.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Smallest pecker I've ever seen!
text: Marney raises her eyebrows, confused by the comment. Delilah
text: looks down at herself, thoroughly covered in cake. Perhaps
text: a moment of clarity. Then, shamelessly, she licks herself.
dialog: 14.
text: Mirabelle and Charlene pop back into the tent. They get an
text: eyeful of Delilah going to town on the cake. Her indulgence
text: verges on pornography.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: (aghast)
dialog: Oh my word.
speaker_heading: CHARLENE
dialog: (salivating)
dialog: Oh my word.

text: The ALARM CLOCK goes off: the sound of a Boxing Fight Bell.
text: Delilah reaches her hand out and shuts it off.
scene_heading: SUPER: ONE WEEK LATER
text: Delilah, still in bed. One-gallon buckets of ice cream have
text: been hollowed out. They sit sadly on the floor by the bed.
text: Her phone rings, Delilah reaches for it.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: BRIDESMAID (V.O.)
dialog: Delilah? It's me, Cassandra. How're
dialog: you holding up?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I'm fine.

speaker_heading: BRIDESMAID (V.O.)
dialog: Listen... I'm not gonna be able to
dialog: make it to that picnic on Sunday...
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: But we've been plannin' that for a

speaker_heading: BRIDESMAID (V.0O.)

speaker_heading: DELILAH

speaker_heading: BRIDESMAID (V.O.)

text: talking about it.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Okay. Bye...
dialog: (hangs up)
scene_heading: SUPER: ONE WEEK LATER
text: Delilah, still in bed. Pizza boxes have joined the empty
text: ice cream containers on the floor. One box, half-eaten,
text: sits squarely on Delilah's wedding dress.
text: Her alarm clock goes off. Delilah flings it across the room.
text: She returns her face to the pillow and shuts her eyes.
text: Slowly, her eyes open again. They focus ona
speaker_heading: FRAMED PICTURE
text: of Kelvin boxing in the ring.
text: Delilah picks it up and studies it. An epiphany.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Assault 'n battery, my hot ass.

speaker_heading: CHARLENE
dialog: Okaaay.
text: She turns to her mother like Delilah might be nuts.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: Delilah, I didn't raise you to talk
dialog: like that.
text: Delilah pours herself a glass of orange juice.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: You know somethin', Momma? You are
dialog: ab-so-lute-ly right. You taught me
dialog: to speak proper, act like a lady,
dialog: drown all my sorrows in iced tea,
dialog: and take action when the need calls
dialog: for it. And you know what? That's
dialog: exactly what I'm gonna do.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: What are you talking about, for
dialog: heaven's sake?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: (downs her juice)
dialog: Y'all are lookin' at the first female

text: Mirabelle EXPLODES with laughter. Charlene looks at her

speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: That's right. You laugh. But I'm
dialog: tellin' you right now... I'm gonna
dialog: box my way up the ranks and beat the

speaker_heading: DELILAH

speaker_heading: CHARLENE
dialog: That's insane. He'd kill you.
speaker_heading: DELILAH

speaker_heading: DELILAH

speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Go pahk your ass ova there.
text: Delilah ambles to the opposite side of the ring. Many of

text: In the ring, Slice is throttled by two left hooks. Delilah
text: looks on as Slice retaliates, hammering her Opponent.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Take it easy, you're losing your

dialog: told you. If you get mad, you get
dialog: crazy, and if you get crazy, you're
dialog: gonna end up in a hospital. I'm not
dialog: having that here. This ain't about
dialog: emotion. It's about heart. You

speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I'm aware where the mall is, thank
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Whaddya want, then?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Is this your gym?
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Better fuckin' believe it.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: My name's Delilah MacIntosh. It's
dialog: nice to meet you.
text: She puts out her hand, comes up empty.
speaker_heading: TANDY

speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Nope. I'm campaignin' to be a boxer.

text: with her feet up behind a desk, squeezing a tennis ball in
text: each hand. Delilah fills out an application on a clipboard.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I never got your name.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Tandy. So what brings a girl like
dialog: you to boxing?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Well... I'm a graduate of Norton
dialog: Beauty College. I've got my
dialog: manicurist license, as well as my
dialog: cosmetology license.
speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I won the Miss Georgia beauty pageant
dialog: two years ago. And um, this year,
dialog: I'm the Magnolia Princess.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: So... what brings a girl like you to
dialog: boxing?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Oh. I wanted to change career paths.
dialog: Uh huh. I mean, beauty's only skin
dialog: deep, right? That's what they always
dialog: say. 'N who knows, maybe they're
dialog: right. Workin' in an office is just
dialog: not my thing. I'd die if I had to
dialog: sit in a cube all day, wouldn't you?
text: Tandy looks dizzy, rubs the confusion from her eyes.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: You married?
text: Delilah covers her engagement ring.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: No. Still single.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Well, Delilah, I gotta warn you.
dialog: Boxing's a far cry from doing the
dialog: friggin' catwalk. Ya follow me? It
dialog: can get pretty brutal out there.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
text: Dangit! An eyelash got in my eye.
dialog: Just a sec.
text: Slyly, she slips off her engagement ring, drops it into her
text: pocketbook, and takes out her compact.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Lately, my eyelashes seem to have a
dialog: mind o' their own. I dunno what's
dialog: goin' on with them.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Yeah, I can see how that might be
dialog: hard.
text: She smirks at Delilah as she fishes for an eyelash.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: (closes her compact)
dialog: Miss Tandy. I don't wanna
dialog: inconvenience you, truly I don't.
dialog: But I do know that if I'm gonna box,
dialog: I'm sure as hellfire gonna need
dialog: someone to train me.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Amen to that.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: So if it's not too much trouble...
dialog: you think you might be up for it?
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Why me?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Why you?
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Yeah, why'd you pick me?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Well um... I heard you were the best,
dialog: so... why would I settle for somethin'
dialog: less?
text: Tandy raises an eyebrow.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Is my hair a mess? I'm sorry. It
dialog: was real windy on the way in here.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Delilah, your resume's pretty damn
dialog: impressive, I'll give you that. But
dialog: I don't see how beauty pageants and
dialog: a manicure license qualify you as a
dialog: boxer. Boxing's about discipline.
dialog: Not how pretty you look. I think
dialog: you should stick with what you're
dialog: good at. You're just not cut out
dialog: for something like this.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: You know what? That's where you're
dialog: wrong. You have any idea what it
dialog: takes to win a beauty pageant? Do
dialog: you? A million miles on the
dialog: treadmill, all the food you can't
dialog: eat, can't drink, can't smoke, don't
dialog: smile too much or you might get laugh
dialog: lines, takin' vitamins every day,

speaker_heading: DELILAH

dialog: whatever-seed, and still try to find
dialog: a way to sleep eight hours a night
dialog: when all you can think about is that
text: chocolate fudge cake sittin' in the
dialog: fridge. Don't let the mascara and
dialog: eyeliner fool you, Miss Tandy. I'm
dialog: all about discipline. Now are you
dialog: gonna train me or what?
text: Tandy stares at Delilah in silence. She pulls out a notepad
text: and pen, scribbles.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: There's things you're gonna need.
dialog: You can pick 'em up at Jesse's around
dialog: the corner. Be here tomorrow at
dialog: eight. And when you get here, could
dialog: you be a little less... pink?

speaker_heading: BUMPY
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: A big bag. You know, for boxin'.
speaker_heading: BUMPY
dialog: Oh, you mean a heavy bag.

speaker_heading: BUMPY
dialog: Um, yeah. Good for you.
text: He stops in front of a row of black and brown heavy bags.
speaker_heading: BUMPY
dialog: We have these here. They're well-

speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Do you have anythin' happier?
speaker_heading: BUMPY
dialog: Happier.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Yeah. I mean, look at these. They're
dialog: all so dull-lookin'.
dialog: (points to brown one)
dialog: This one looks like King Kong had an
dialog: accident. Who wants to see that?
speaker_heading: BUMPY
dialog: Miss, I hope you don't mind my asking,
dialog: but, why boxing? I mean, look at
dialog: you. You're a knockout.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Ha!
speaker_heading: BUMPY
dialog: Guess I stepped into that one. Look,
dialog: I'm sorry, but I'm afraid we don't
dialog: have any happier-looking heavy bags.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: That's too bad.
speaker_heading: BUMPY
dialog: Can I interest you in a slam, ma'am?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: What?!

speaker_heading: DELILAH

speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: It's a pleasure. Didn't that hurt?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: It's no problem. He misses all the

speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Oh hush. My name's Romeo. I could
dialog: never wear that color yellow, but it

speaker_heading: DELILAH

speaker_heading: TANDY

dialog: Alright, ladies. This ain't a

dialog: can see what you're doing. Put your
dialog: feet like this.

text: Delilah crouches like she's got a load in her pants.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Don't bend so far. You're not in
dialog: the bathroom. We're gonna start off
dialog: slow. Just jab with your left,

dialog: punching straight out from your chin.
text: Delilah clenches her fists and punches wildly.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Like that?
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Don't clench your fist. Keep your

dialog: (jabs in slow-motion)
dialog: Straight from the chin. Then squeeze
dialog: right before ya reach your target.
text: Delilah jabs again. A little better.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Okay. Now this time, turn your fist
dialog: a little when you punch.

speaker_heading: DELILAH

speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Snap it out. Pull it back. Fast.
dialog: Let your punch hang and you'll fuckin'

text: Delilah swings a roundhouse right.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: What are ya, breaking up a bar fight?

dialog: (demonstrates)
dialog: This time, the power's not coming
dialog: from your arm.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: It's not?
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Nope. It's coming from your torso,

dialog: and from your right foot when ya
dialog: pivot.
text: Delilah tries a few straight rights.
speaker_heading: TANDY

speaker_heading: DELILAH

speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: But be quick about it.

dialog: floor.
text: Tandy gets to work wrapping Delilah's left hand.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Hook your thumb, wrap your wrist,
dialog: your knuckles, then back to your
dialog: thumb. Cross over, wrap your knuckles
text: again, and tie it off at the wrist.
dialog: You do your right.
text: Delilah gives it a shot. She doesn't use enough tension,
text: the wrap droops from her hand.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: You're a little too loose.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: No I'm not.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: I'm talking about the wrap.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Oh.

speaker_heading: TANDY

speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Dig your hand in there deep. Like

speaker_heading: TANDY

speaker_heading: HEAVY BAG
text: next to one Slice is pounding on.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: We're starting with jabs. Remember
dialog: your stance. Make sure ya hit the
dialog: bag with the front of your fist, not
dialog: the top. That'll hurt like a son-of-
dialog: a-bitch.
text: Delilah jabs at the bag once, then again while the bag tails
text: away. She loses her balance and tumbles. She starts to get
text: up, embarrassed, and the bag hits her FLUSH on the way back.
speaker_heading: SLICE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: You really showed him.
text: Tandy helps Delilah up, glares at Slice.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Mind your own business.
dialog: (to Delilah)
dialog: Wait 'til the bag swings back before
dialog: ya hit it again. Make it work for
dialog: you, not the other way around.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Like this?
dialog: (wallops the bag)
dialog: Take that!
dialog: (again)
dialog: And that!
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Good. But don't get so pissed off.
dialog: Clean out your ears, cuz this is
text: important. A boxer who goes in mad,
text: comes out hurt. Ten times out of
dialog: ten. Boxing's about discipline.
dialog: This ain't the WF.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: World Wildlife --

scene_heading: EXT. SAVANNAH STREET -- DAY
text: Still in her green sweatsuit, Delilah jogs. Exhausted, but

text: She nears a fruit stand where fresh peaches are on display.
text: Snags one as she passes by. Grins at the startled VENDOR.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Oh no! I'm stealin' a peach. Better
dialog: call the fuzz.
text: The Vendor gapes at her as she runs away. Delilah turns...
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Catch!
text: She hurls the peach back, but misses the Vendor by a mile.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Oops. Sorry!
text: She trots back to him. Fishes a dollar from her fanny pack.

text: Short little wheeze. Like this.
text: She wheezes for Delilah.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Should I call someone? Sounds like
dialog: you're havin' a heart attack.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Do it with me.
text: Delilah wheezes quietly. Tandy beckons for more. She takes
text: it up a notch. Or two. Or three.
text: The two begin to wheeze in harmony, and the Gym-goers find
text: it impossible to resist. EVERYONE begins to wheeze, until
text: it sounds like the entire gym may enter into cardiac arrest.
text: Tandy holds up a stop sign with her hand, the wheezing stops.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: We're taking another field trip.

speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: So, Tandy, what brought you to boxin'?
text: Tandy's eyes are fixed on the fight.
speaker_heading: TANDY

dialog: What were you doin' before?
speaker_heading: TANDY

dialog: That bastard.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Oh. Um... the one in green.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: What about 'im?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I bought that same color the other
dialog: day, that... copycattin'... jackass.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: (chortles)
dialog: Whadda you care? Afraid you might
dialog: clash?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: No. I'm not afraid.
scene_heading: INT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM -- DAY
text: Hank holds the heavy bag as Delilah, in electric blue sweats,
text: slugs away. Tandy looks on. Delilah's getting better, mixing
text: in some left hooks and uppercuts with her jabs.
speaker_heading: TANDY
text: More power with the uppercut. Punch
dialog: from your legs.
text: Delilah dips and thrusts a whopper of an uppercut.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Good! Show me another hook.
text: She delivers a few ineffectual left hooks.
dialog: She steps
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Let me show ya something.
dialog: (steps up to the bag)
dialog: Take the ball of your left foot, and
dialog: plant it like you're putting out a
dialog: cigarette.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Good idea. I hate cigarettes.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Then pivot your body to the right.
dialog: Legs, hips, back. All of it. Like
text: a gate swinging from a post.
dialog: (throws a few hooks)
text: out of the way and Delilah takes a crack at it.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Don't worry about looking funny.
dialog: Tuck your hand to your chest when ya
dialog: come around. Snap it out, and
dialog: recover. Don't leave yourself open.
text: Delilah generates more torque as she practices her hook.
text: Romeo jumps rope on the platform.
dialog: She leads
speaker_heading: RING
dialog: and pulls
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: You go, darlin'!
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Oh Romeo, Romeo... what for ow thou...
dialog: I dunno, whatever...
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Okay, let's talk defense.
dialog: Delilah to the
text: on gloves. Tosses Delilah her headgear.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: We're fightin'?
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Hell no. We're gonna practice slips.
dialog: I'm gonna throw some punches, and
dialog: you're gonna avoid them. If ya can.
text: Delilah puts on her headgear.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Cinch it on tight.
dialog: (assists her)
dialog: Now, I want ya to watch my body.
dialog: Every punch your opponent misses,
dialog: costs her some energy, right? See
dialog: where my next punch is coming from,
dialog: then move your head outta the way.
text: She throws a soft jab at Delilah's head, she evades it.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Good. Keep your eyes on mine.
text: Throws a left hook, Delilah steps out of the way.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: This ain't dodgeball. Don't use
dialog: your feet. Only your head.
text: She throws more punches, a little faster now.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: The idea's to avoid the attack, but
dialog: use as little energy as possible.
text: Delilah's into it, bobbing her head back and forth.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: This is kinda fun.
text: Tandy puts a little more power behind her punches and POPS
text: Delilah in the mouth.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Owwwwwwwwwww !
dialog: (falls to her knees)
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Oh shit.
text: She squats next to Delilah, pulls her hand away from her
text: mouth. Blood pours from a cut on Delilah's lip.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Somebody get me a towel!
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL -- DAY
text: Delilah sits on a gurney, enclosed by a privacy curtain.
text: She holds a white towel to her lip.
text: She looks down at her hand and notices the impression left
text: by her engagement ring. Delilah brings the towel down and
text: tries to wipe away the mark.
dialog: 38.
text: The curtain opens wide and in walks Doctor NATE MORE, 30s,
text: widowed, and hasn't combed his hair since.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Are you here for stitches?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Oh God, please no. I've never had
dialog: stitches 'fore in my life.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Hold on. Let's have a look.
dialog: (pulls up a stool)
dialog: I'm Doctor More. Delilah, is it?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: That's a little intimidating. I
dialog: haven't had a haircut in months.
text: Delilah makes a scissoring motion with her fingers.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: So what brings you here?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I was involved in a boxin' accident.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: A boxing accident.
dialog: (walks to counter)
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Uh huh. I was learnin' how to do
dialog: The Slip, and I zigged when I
dialog: should've zagged.
text: Nate drips solution onto a cotton ball.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: That's too bad. I've got some good
dialog: news for you though.
text: He leans in and cleanses the wound.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: No stitches.
text: Delilah unabashedly hugs Nate's head, he nearly tumbles.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: That's so great! Thank you so much.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: (nose to nose)
dialog: Be sure to keep it dry.
scene_heading: INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - DELILAH'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Delilah turns on the light, tosses her gym bag on the bed.
text: She steps in front of her full-length mirror and inspects
text: her face. A thin adhesive strip rides her upper lip.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Oh yuck. I look like him.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE (0.S.)
dialog: What do you think you're doing?
text: Delilah turns. Mirabelle stands in the doorway, arms folded.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: What're you talkin' about?
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: Oh my God! What is that?!
text: She hoofs it across the room, dodging SlamMan.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: Is that a cut? Is it deep?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: It's just a tiny one.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: How did you get it?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I already told you.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: You haven't told me anything. I
dialog: hardly see you anymore. Where've
dialog: you been going?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: (mocking her)
dialog: You mean you don't remember?
text: Mirabelle searches the files in her head.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: The other mornin'. You were havin'
dialog: breakfast. There was a lot of
dialog: laughter, as I recall.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: If you're telling me you've taken up
dialog: boxing, I'm gonna go ballistic.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Momma, you're already there.
text: Mirabelle pulls at her own hair, SCREAMS like a banshee.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I'm sorry if that upsets you. If
dialog: you need somethin' to hit, try the
dialog: SlamMan.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: I want that monstrosity out of here!
text: She punches SlamMan in the head. Breaks a nail.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: Good heavens. Now look what you've
dialog: done. This is all your fault!
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: My fault?!
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: You must have done something. Said
dialog: something stupid that upset him for
dialog: him to do that to you.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Did you just call me stupid?
text: Mirabelle inches backward.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Step back, Momma. Let me show you
dialog: how it's done.
text: She throws on her bag gloves, goes off on SlamMan. Mirabelle
text: looks on in horror. Races out clutching her hand.
scene_heading: INT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM - RING -- DAY
text: Delilah spars with Slice, both in headgear. No sign of Tandy.
text: Delilah bounces around like she's at a disco. Slice toys
text: with her, arms down, smiles ugly through her mouthguard.
speaker_heading: SLICE
text: That Band-Aid looks like a moustache.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Must stink to know I'm still prettier
dialog: than you.
dialog: 41.
text: Slice STINGS her on the side of the head.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Maybe I oughta grow a full beard so
dialog: you can catch up.
text: Slice ZINGS her on the other side of the head.
speaker_heading: SLICE
dialog: Keep talking, SilverSpoon. I'm kinda
dialog: enjoying this. Shouldn't you be in
text: a ball gown somewhere, cookin' up
dialog: some grits?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: As a lady, I'm prone to wearin'
dialog: dresses. Where do rednecks normally
dialog: shop?
text: Slice laughs.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Did you get your three squares today?
dialog: I didn't notice any Slim Jim wrappers
text: in the trash.
text: As Delilah sweats, her skin strip begins to peel off.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Is that a new perfume you're wearin'?
dialog: I never tried Raid.
text: Slice swings, but this time, Delilah slips her punch.
speaker_heading: SLICE
dialog: Such a sweet li'l thing, coming in
dialog: here to learn how to box. Should be
dialog: married 'n pregnant by now...
text: Tandy hustles into the gym carrying a grocery bag.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Aren't you married? Or don't you
dialog: have a brother?
text: Her skin strip falls. Slice unloads and CONNECTS on Delilah's
text: cut, dropping her flat on her back.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Slice! You sloppy shit-bitch!
text: She drops her bag and hops into the ring.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Get away from her!
dialog: 42.
text: Slice edges out of the way. Blood pours from Delilah's lip.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: I let you down.
text: Tandy uses the bottom of her shirt to press down on the cut.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY -- DAY
text: Delilah sits on a gurney, a towel to her mouth, her eyes a
text: bit swollen. Tandy leans next to her as TRAFFIC passes by.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: It's gonna be stitches for sure this
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Don't worry. You'll still be the
text: prettiest one at the gym.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: You really think so?
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: I know so.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Why're we sittin' out here anyway?
speaker_heading: TANDY
text: Because they ran out of room.
text: Nate turns the corner, sees Delilah.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I should've stayed in sales with all
dialog: these repeat customers.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
text: The cut opened, Doctor More.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Uh oh. Another boxing accident?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Uh huh.
text: Nate smiles, he glances over at Tandy and all of a sudden
text: Tandy feels like she's intruding on a private conversation.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: I'll see ya back at the gym.
dialog: (goes, stops)
dialog: Wait. I'm your ride.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: That's okay. I'll just call a cab.
dialog: It's not that far.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Okay. Bye.
dialog: (leaves)
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Thanks for drivin' me.
text: She lets go of her towel, Nate inspects her lip.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: You're lucky, Miss Delilah. A little
dialog: Dermabond should do it. But that's
dialog: two strikes. Your eyes look swollen
dialog: to me, too.
text: He rips open a peroxide towelette and cleanses the cut.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Smells nice. Like lemons.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: You know what goes good with that?
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - CAFETERIA -- DAY
text: Delilah squeezes lemon into a cup of tea. A topical skin
text: adhesive highlights her upper lip.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: (sips coffee)
dialog: So you're gonna beat the grits out
dialog: of your ex-fiancé?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: "Deed I am.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: He embarrassed me. And I'd like to
dialog: return the favor.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Would they even allow that?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: They're gonna have to. Boxers must
dialog: be good for business, wouldn't you
dialog: say?
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I'd like not to think of it asa
dialog: growth industry.
text: Delilah notices his wedding band.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Is your wife a doctor, too?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: No, actually. She passed away.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that.
dialog: She must've been young.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Too young.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Do you have any kids?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: One daughter. Abby.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Does she look like...?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Isabel. They have the exact same
text: eyes.
text: Both at a loss what to say next.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: There's a um... Charity Ball goin'
text: on at the Convention Center on
dialog: Saturday night. If you think you
dialog: might be up for it, it'd sure be

dialog: You know, in case I get into any

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I dunno. Saturday... I think I might

speaker_heading: DELILAH

speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: I won't stand for this. It's bad

dialog: on her wedding and have nothing to
dialog: show for it. But now she's got this
dialog: cockamamie idea in her head that's
dialog: gonna threaten her only asset which
dialog: is her looks. I won't stand for it.
dialog: You have to talk to her.
speaker_heading: DINING ROOM
text: Charlene eavesdrops.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL (0.S.)
dialog: Maybe it's just a phase she's gotta
dialog: work herself through.
text: BACK TO KITCHEN
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: We're not talking hula hoops and yo-
dialog: yos, Samuel. She's one facial scar
text: away from bagging groceries at the
dialog: Piggly Wiggly.

dialog: Is that what you want?
scene_heading: INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NIGHT

scene_heading: DELILAH'S BEDROOM
text: Samuel raises his hand to knock, peeks in.
text: Delilah hunches in a blue ball gown, whimpering in front of
text: her full-length mirror. Her back to Samuel, she wipes tears
text: from her eyes.
text: A sad look from Samuel and he sneaks away.
dialog: 46.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENTION CENTER - LOBBY -- NIGHT
text: Elegant, refined. A HOST of tuxedos and ball gowns.
text: Delilah emerges through a revolving door looking impeccable,
text: aside from her TWO BLACK EYES.
text: Her appearance garners her an unfamiliar sort of attention,
text: which shows on her face when she spots two of her Bridesmaids
text: directing their BEAUS toward a more dignified place to mingle.
text: Smiling her way and dressed to the nines, is Nate. He holds
text: out his hand, she takes it.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: You did say "boxing," didn't you?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: (sigh of relief)
dialog: Yes, I did. I ran out o' concealer.
text: They stroll through the crowd of onlookers.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENTION CENTER - DINING HALL -- NIGHT
text: Delilah and Nate eat dinner at a table with six other GUESTS.
text: A few find it difficult not to stare at Delilah's bruises.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: (sips wine)
dialog: So how old's Abby?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Thirteen. Eighth grade philosopher.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: You have a picture?
text: Nate takes out his wallet, an accordion of pictures unravels.
text: Straight down into his soup.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Jeez! I'm an idiot.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Hurry, she's drownin'!
dialog: (hands him her napkin)
text: Nate wipes off the pictures, Delilah leans over to see.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: My God, she is just beautiful. Even
text: with minestrone in her hair.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Yes, she is.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: What's she like?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: She's a good egg. With a double
dialog: yolk, you might say.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Whaddya mean by that?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: She's definitely got two sides to
text: her. There's the side I hear on the
dialog: phone a lot with her friends. And
dialog: then there's sort of a long-distance
dialog: Abby. That's the one that normally
text: shows up for dinner.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Has this been goin' on since...
text: Nate nods. They share a forlorn look.
text: Back to eating. Delilah raises her fork, looks up ata
text: TABLE ACROSS THE WAY
text: where Kelvin and Marney dine, laughing and smiling.
speaker_heading: DELILAH'S EYES
text: glow fuchsia. She puts her fork down.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Would you excuse me for a minute?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Thank you. I won't be long.

scene_heading: KELVIN & MARNEY'S TABLE
text: They see her drawing near, and freeze with fear.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: (addressing table)
dialog: How're all y'all doin' tonight?

speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Please forgive my appearance. I
dialog: don't mean to interrupt, I know all

speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Raise your hand if you got the sea
dialog: bass.
text: She looks around the table, a TIMID COUPLE raises their hands.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Itn't it scrumptious?
speaker_heading: TIMID HUSBAND
dialog: Very scrumptious, thank you.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Goooood. All y'all've had a chance
dialog: to meet Mr. Wingfield here?
text: She gestures to Kelvin, the Guests nod.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
text: Flyweight boxer. Handsome for his
dialog: size, don't you think? But I never
dialog: seen those Peter Jackson movies.
dialog: What you probably don't know - all
dialog: but one - is that he left me at the
dialog: altar. And my guess is, for the
text: woman seated to his left.
dialog: (Guests gasp and turn)
dialog: Itn't she sweet? Anyone know who
dialog: she is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIMID WIFE
dialog: Marney, right?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: That's right. Marney Cobb. She was
dialog: my best friend.
dialog: (Guests gasp again)

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Naturally.
speaker_heading: DELILAH

dialog: before?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Yes, I have. A little over two years
dialog: ago.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Feels sort o' surreal, doesn't it?
dialog: Funny. I was expectin' my next dance
dialog: to be with someone 'bout six inches
dialog: shorter than you.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I can slouch if you like.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: No, don't do that. I don't want you

speaker_heading: NATE

speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Until when?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Until the ride's over. And you have
dialog: to get off.
text: Delilah looks up at him.
speaker_heading: DELILAH

dialog: stop.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Delilah, if you stop smiling, it'll
dialog: be the end of all of us.
speaker_heading: DELILAH

dialog: That sounds about right.
scene_heading: INT. ARENA - RING -- NIGHT
scene_heading: SUPER: FOUR MONTHS LATER
text: The sound of a fight BELL.
text: A leaner Delilah springs out of her corner. Her helmet is
text: color-coordinated with the rest of her outfit.
text: Her opponent, VALERIE VENDETTA, 30, snarly redhead, dances
text: over with confidence.
text: They trade jabs. Valerie throws a couple of straight rights
text: that Delilah parries.
text: Delilah tries a straight right, misses, loses her balance.
text: Valerie makes her pay for it with a wicked shot to the ribs.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: (slaps the mat)
dialog: Snap 'n back! Snap 'n back! Don't
dialog: leave yourself open!
text: Delilah bobs erratically east to west. Valerie connects
text: with a left uppercut.
text: Delilah delivers three left jabs, dropping her opponent back.
text: A left hook from Valerie that Delilah slips, she retaliates
text: with one of her own, surprising Valerie and her right temple.
text: Delilah loses her balance when she tries for a left uppercut,
text: but enough so to miss a vicious straight right from Valerie.
text: The BELL. Delilah retreats to her corner. Tandy, Hank and
text: Romeo enter the ring.
dialog: 51.
text: IN THE CROWD
text: Samuel sits alone, his Panama hat pulled down low.
dialog: BACK TO RING
text: Hank rubs Vaseline under Delilah's left eye.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Is that non-comedogenic?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Sure. What?
text: Romeo gives her a swig of water.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: You're all over the place out there.
dialog: Did Slice stick a curling iron down
dialog: your shorts?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Yes, she did. I'm still gettin'
dialog: warmed up.
dialog: (smiles up at Romeo)
text: Romeo laughs, until he sees Tandy's look.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: This girl's just waitin' for ya to
dialog: lose your balance so she can knock
dialog: the shit outta ya. Make the bitch
dialog: wait.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You can do it, Delilah.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Thanks, Hank.
text: The BELL. Delilah comes out of her corner, bobbing less.
text: Valerie starts in with two right uppercuts to Delilah's ribs.
text: Not ready for them, she stiffens up.
text: Delilah comes back with a jab and a straight right, Valerie
text: parries them both. She counters with a combination of her
text: own, landing both.
text: Delilah's back to moving helter-skelter. Conscious of her
text: left ribs, she lowers her guard. Valerie lets loose a
text: straight right that drops Delilah flat.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Shit!
dialog: 52.
text: REFEREE starts the countdown. Delilah doesn't budge an inch.

scene_heading: ACROSS THE WAY

speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Delilah!
text: The RING PHYSICIAN, 50s, enters, stoops down to Delilah.
speaker_heading: RING PHYSICIAN
dialog: Can you hear me?
text: He checks her airways, tilts her head back.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: COME ON...
speaker_heading: RING PHYSICIAN
dialog: Can you hear me, Miss MacIntosh?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I do. I do. I dooo...

dialog: That's all he needed to say.
text: Ring Physician and Tandy look at each other quizzically.
scene_heading: INT. ARENA - DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Dimly lit, a few lights have been punched out. Delilah sits

speaker_heading: DELILAH

speaker_heading: ROMEO

speaker_heading: DELILAH

speaker_heading: TANDY

speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: We don't want that.
speaker_heading: TANDY

speaker_heading: LOST HUSBAND
dialog: We would ab-so-lute-ly like to try
text: them. Sooner rather than later.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Well, that's easy. You head straight
text: down River Street, take a sharp left
dialog: on Bay by Cromwell Theatre. That's
dialog: where they had that awful fire twelve
dialog: years back. Oh, and it was such a
dialog: shame, too, cuz at that time it was
dialog: the oldest theatre in all o' Georgia.
dialog: They redid it nice 'n pretty, but
dialog: it's just not the same. When you
dialog: reach the end o' Bay, you wanna turn
text: left onto Matlin and a quick right
dialog: onto Acorn. You'll see Ernesto's
text: Cafe on the corner. It used to be
dialog: Henry's Diner, but when Henry's wife
dialog: caught 'im cheatin' with the hostess,
dialog: poor man lost everythin'. Benny's
text: is just two more blocks from there.
dialog: Straight shot, you can't miss it.

speaker_heading: DELILAH

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: And this is from a beauty pageant
dialog: winner.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: So... why are you boxing?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Why not? Girl doesn't have to be
dialog: one thing, does she?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Yeah, but, boxing can ruin your looks.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Uh huh. Just like stress, 'n second-
dialog: hand smoke, 'n my favorite, Father
dialog: Time. Besides, it's fun. Look!
text: She jabs with her left, a right cross, a left uppercut.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Works the kinks out. C'mon, let me
dialog: show you.
text: Abby rolls her eyes, mopes over to Delilah.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: (demonstrates)
dialog: Line up your right heel and your
dialog: left toe. Flex your knees, bend
dialog: your hips a little, tuck your elbows
dialog: in, and put up your dukes.
text: Abby caves, she assumes the boxer's stance.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
text: Now jab.
text: Abby jabs with her left.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: (joins in)
dialog: Good. Now try your right.
text: Nate grins as they punch away in harmony.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I've really done it now.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Snap it right out. Good. This is
dialog: the punch you'll use in case you're
dialog: ever in a street fight. Or if you
dialog: just wanna beat up the class clown.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What about bullies?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Them, too.
text: Nate gazes at Abby. She steals a look back at him.
dialog: They stop
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Abby, is there something you wanna
dialog: tell me?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: No. It's not a big deal.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: What's not a big deal?
text: jabbing. Abby sulks.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: It's just this jerk in my math class.
dialog: Tommy Willis.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: What about Tommy Willis?
speaker_heading: ABBY
text: He's been... snapping my bra. I
dialog: can't get him to stop.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: How long has this been going on?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: A month.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: A month? Why didn't you tell me?
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: We all have to fight our own battles.
dialog: Isn't that what you said?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: This is different.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Because you're my daughter. That's
dialog: why.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Might I offer a suggestion?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: The combination punch!
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Delilah, please... let's be realistic.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Hear me out. Is this boy bigger
dialog: than you?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Yeah, he's pretty big. And fat.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Don't you worry 'bout that. That's
dialog: just hormones 'n poor eatin' habits.
dialog: Come with me.

speaker_heading: GRASSY AREA
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Delilah, what are we doing?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: What are we doin'? We're puttin'
dialog: arrows in your daughter's quiver.
dialog: That's what we're doin'. Three to
dialog: be exact. And you're gonna be the
dialog: honorary guinea pig. Is that okay
dialog: with you, Abby?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Uh huh.
text: Delilah sets Nate in front of her.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Now. Make like you're Tommy Willis.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: What do you expect me to do?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Improvise.
text: Nate puffs out his cheeks like he's a hundred pounds
text: overweight. He raises his arms up like a monster, aims for
text: Delilah's bra. Abby giggles.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Now just watch me, Abby.
dialog: (demonstrates in slow-
dialog: motion)
text: Left jab. Then a straight right.
text: Then finish 'im off with a left hook.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Got it.
text: (pulls out a tiny
dialog: notepad and pen)
text: Left, right, left.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Right. I'm gonna do it a little
dialog: faster this time, okay?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Okay.
text: Delilah delivers the combination on Nate. She pulls the
dialog: punches a bit, but truth is, she didn't like the comment
text: about being realistic. Nate falls heavily on his keester.
text: Delilah hovers over Nate menacingly. A WOMAN in a pink
text: sweater approaches.
speaker_heading: PINK SWEATER
dialog: Miss MacIntosh?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PINK SWEATER

speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Thank you for that. You're so sweet.
speaker_heading: KIP
dialog: So now it's all beginning to make
dialog: sense. Wait a sec. No it isn't.
dialog: Some jerk jilts you, and you put on

text: GRAVEDIGGER, 36, spiky blonde hair, the bizarro Delilah.
text: Delilah throws three lightning lefts- each of them, strikes.
dialog: 66.
text: Gladys returns fire with a straight right that clears
text: Delilah's sinuses. She adjusts her headgear.
text: A one-two combination from Delilah throttles Gladys, but
text: she's late returning to guard and pays for it in spades.
text: Delilah's rhythm turns haphazard again. Gladys sees that
text: she's off balance and capitalizes with a mean left hook.
text: The BELL. Hank sets down a stool and goes to work applying
text: Vaseline, Romeo waters down Delilah.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You're doin' good, you're doin' good.
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Kick her ass, Delilah. This one's

speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I did better the first two rounds,
dialog: didn't 1?
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: What are you asking me for? Don't
dialog: you know when you're getting your

speaker_heading: The BELL.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: What's with you?
text: Coming full speed ahead is Gladys. Right cross. POw!
text: Delilah falls back against the turnbuckle. She bobs and
text: weaves like mad, trying to evade the flurry of punches.
text: Then, Delilah GROWLS at Gladys. Her opponent steps back.
text: Delilah struts out of her corner like a cat on the prowl.
text: Gladys swings and misses. Another one, misses. Delilah's
text: full-on into her box step, throwing rapid jabs as she goes.
dialog: 67.
text: When Gladys tries for a right hook, Delilah sidesteps. When
text: she lunges forward, Delilah drops back out of harm's way.
text: Just when Gladys thinks she's got a read on her, Delilah
text: switches genders on her box step. Not only does Gladys miss,
text: but she leaves herself wide open. Delilah CONNECTS with a
text: left hook that sends her opponent spiraling down to the mat.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Oh my God.
text: Outside the ring, Romeo jumps up and down, high-fives Hank.
text: As the REFEREE counts, Gladys slowly rises to her feet.
text: Delilah beams with confidence, swaggers as she throws
text: everything but the kitchen sink at her opponent. Gladys
text: tries to shield herself from the barrage. The BELL.
text: Hank and Romeo storm the ring.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I knew you could do it!
speaker_heading: ROMEO

text: table: 40s, white pantsuit, and a pretentious scarf.
speaker_heading: PRETENTIOUS
dialog: Thank you. Smells delightful.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: So is this something that would pay
dialog: per assignment, or would she receive
dialog: an annual salary?
speaker_heading: PRETENTIOUS
dialog: It's per assignment. But, trust me,
dialog: it's quite lucrative, just the same.
dialog: I suppose if I talk to some people --
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: I think she might be coming.
dialog: (nonchalantly)
dialog: I am so glad I tried this brand of
dialog: coffee. Isn't it heavenly?
text: Delilah saunters in, ignoring the people seated at the table.
text: She rests the box of cookies on the counter.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: Oh, Delilah. There's someone I'd
dialog: like you to meet. This is Ms.
dialog: Williamson. She works for Ciao Belle
dialog: magazine.
text: Pretentious stands and extends her hand with a flawless smile.
text: She towers over Delilah.
speaker_heading: PRETENTIOUS
dialog: It's so nice to meet you.
text: Delilah shakes her hand, more than a little suspicious.
speaker_heading: PRETENTIOUS
dialog: Please, won't you join us?
dialog: (takes a seat)
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I prefer to stand, thank you. What's
dialog: this about?
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: How does a dream come true sound?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
text: Like it's dark out and I'm asleep.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: Oh you wouldn't want to sleep through
dialog: this, Honey. Please, fill my daughter
dialog: in on all the details.
speaker_heading: PRETENTIOUS
dialog: Delilah, our magazine is currently
text: in need of a new fashion model. One
dialog: that fits your specs to a tee. I
dialog: can tell immediately that --
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: My mother put you up to this?
speaker_heading: PRETENTIOUS
dialog: Well, um... I'm the newest member of
dialog: her bridge club and --
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: How does one hundred thousand a year
dialog: sound for having your picture taken?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: What's the catch?
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: Oh now that's the best part. You
dialog: won't have to box anymore. Isn't
dialog: that right, Kaleena?
text: Delilah reaches for the box of cookies, stuffs her face.
speaker_heading: PRETENTIOUS
dialog: That's true. We strongly encourage
dialog: our models to participate in rigorous
dialog: physical activity, but with minimal
dialog: risk. Stationary bikes, rowing
dialog: machines, treadmills...
text: Her cheeks puffy, Delilah looks a little like Dizzy Gillespie.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: What in God's name are you doing?
text: Delilah TALKS but every word is indiscernible.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: I didn't raise you to be this
dialog: disrespectful.
text: Delilah tries for a REPLY, but again it's incomprehensible.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: Go on, leave. Now! Go box yourself
dialog: into a corner, why don't you?
text: Delilah delivers an elaborate curtsy and departs with a beauty
dialog: queen wave.
scene_heading: INT. NATE'S HOME - KITCHEN -- DAY
text: Nate mixes a protein drink in a blender. Delilah sits at
text: the table, gazing blankly out the window.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Maybe she'll come around.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I dunno. She seemed pretty hurt.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: At least now we won't have to meet
dialog: in the ER. That's a relief.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I guess.
text: Her brooding comes to an abrupt halt.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Wait. Are you sayin' you feel
dialog: relieved about all this?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Maybe a little.
text: Delilah cocks her head back like: "I didn't just hear that."
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Okay more than a little.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: How could you say a thing like that?
dialog: I've invested my whole life in this.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: You think it's easy for me, watching
dialog: people take swings at you?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: No, but, this is my future we're
dialog: talkin' about.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: If being concerned about you makes
dialog: me selfish then I'm plumb out of
dialog: ideas. I'm not in a real hurry to
dialog: lose someone I care about.
text: A moment of silence. Nate pours the protein drink. On the
text: countertop, he glimpses the Sports section. Headline:
dialog: "Delilah Buries the Gravedigger!"
dialog: Nate sets
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I'm just not sure it was all because
dialog: I didn't tell her about Kelvin.
text: the drink on the table, sits across from Delilah.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: She said: I hope you guys are real
dialog: happy together. Lord knows she
dialog: couldn't've have meant him.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Maybe she meant us.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I s'pose.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Do you think she might be --
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I dunno... I don't think so. We
dialog: waltzed once but we were just
dialog: practicin' my footwork.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Maybe you were.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Is it gettin' hot in here or is it
dialog: just me?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: No, it's getting hot. Very hot.
dialog: Smokin' hot, as a matter of fact.
dialog: C'mon.
text: Delilah follows him out.
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: Nate collapses on the sofa. Delilah curls up in a ball.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: How's Abby doin'?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Better, actually. She's not
text: disappearing as fast after dinner.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: That's a start. She upstairs
dialog: studyin'?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Nope. She's got piano, Tuesdays.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Interestin'.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Wanna know something?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I didn't even know she was wearing a
dialog: bra.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Well maybe she is. But I'm not.
scene_heading: INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - DELILAH'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Delilah slugs away on SlamMan, sweat flicking off of her.
text: Mirabelle appears in the doorway, carrying a photo album.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: Can I show you something?
text: Delilah stops abruptly, in no mood for Momma's bullshit.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: I came across it this morning.
dialog: Thought you might wanna have a look.
text: She sidles up to Delilah, and opens the
speaker_heading: PHOTO ALBUM
text: Pictures from all of Delilah's beauty pageants.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: Do you remember? We took you to so
dialog: many...
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: How come I haven't seen a lot of
dialog: these?
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: They're for special occasions. Just
dialog: like this. So many years, so much
dialog: energy and hard work, you devoted.
dialog: I just want to say... how proud I am
dialog: of you.
dialog: (off Delilah's
dialog: perplexed look)
dialog: I mean it. How many people do we
dialog: know come up with one goal today,
dialog: just to forget about it tomorrow?
dialog: That's why New Year's resolutions
dialog: are such a joke. And that's why...
dialog: it pains me to see you slide.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Who's slidin'? I'm not slidin'.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: I never stopped to consider just how
dialog: traumatic an experience it must've
dialog: been for you. To be left standing
dialog: there. That's my fault. I should've
dialog: known better. It's understandable
dialog: you'd want an escape route of some
dialog: kind. And you chose boxing.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Momma. It's not just an escape route.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: Honey, who could blame you for wanting
dialog: to beat the bejesus out of that boy?
dialog: I couldn't. It's just awful what he
dialog: did. But do you really want to throw
dialog: away everything you worked for?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: This isn't even about me, is it.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: What? Of course it is.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: No it isn't. It's about you. And
dialog: how you're always lookin' for a return
dialog: on your investment. Well sometimes
dialog: it just doesn't happen, Momma!
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: Mirabelle
dialog: She heads
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Sometimes a stock tanks and you just
dialog: gotta take it like a lady!
dialog: (paces)
dialog: You know what I think? I think this
dialog: was about you from the very beginnin'.
dialog: Ever since I was five.
text: yawns.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: And to see you come in here holdin'
dialog: your precious photo album, tryin' to
dialog: forge a Hallmark card outta nothin'...
dialog: well that's just tacky, Momma.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: (red alert)
dialog: Don't you ever use that word on me.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I just did! Tacky, tacky, tacky.
dialog: Want a Tic Tac, Momma?
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: You know what the real shame is in
dialog: all this?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I'm sure you're gonna tell me.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: Charlene. That's right, your sister.
dialog: You remember her? God knows she's
dialog: been neglected far too long. I'm
dialog: just gonna have to find a way to
dialog: make it up to her.
dialog: (stretches)
dialog: Lord knows I'm not gonna be around
dialog: forever.
dialog: for the door.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: That's exactly how you operate, isn't
dialog: it, Momma? Ulterior motives and
dialog: veiled threats. Before you know it,
dialog: you've got the whole world on a yo-
dialog: yo. Well, you know what, Momma?
dialog: Keep your money. I hope it keeps
dialog: you warm at night.

text: tie. Milling about are Best Man, Buck, Chuck and Tuck.
speaker_heading: BEST MAN
dialog: You kicked that bitch's ass tonight.
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: That's what I do.
text: He adjusts his tie and spits on the floor.
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: Let's blow this Popsicle stand.
text: He leads the way out down a
speaker_heading: LONG HALLWAY
speaker_heading: BUCK
dialog: What's next for the K-man?
speaker_heading: KELVIN
text: (pumps his fist as he
dialog: farts)
dialog: That's what's next. I say we grab
dialog: ourselves some high-quality snapper.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: I had fish two nights ago.
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: He means pussy, you dumbass.
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: Chucky, haven't you gotten laid yet?
speaker_heading: BEST MAN
dialog: Hey, maybe we should start a charity.
speaker_heading: BUCK
dialog: The Fuck Chuck Fund. Whaddya think?
speaker_heading: BEST MAN
dialog: More like the Upchuck Fund.
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: For as little as fifty-two cents a
dialog: day, you can send Poor Chucky here
text: to a prostitute.
text: The entourage laughs its way through the exit doors.
dialog: 78.
scene_heading: EXT. ARENA -- NIGHT
text: Kelvin and the gang are greeted by some flash bulbs. A
text: REPORTER, 30s with super thick hair, approaches with a mike.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Mr. Wingfield, I wonder if I might
dialog: have a word with you.
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: Stop wondering and ask away.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Obviously, another victory tonight.
dialog: Superb performance. But the question
dialog: that's really on people's minds
dialog: involves your ex-fiancée, Delilah
dialog: MacIntosh. On Good Mornin', Savannah
dialog: the other day --
speaker_heading: KELVIN
text: (raises his hand like
dialog: a stop sign)
dialog: I'm aware of the interview. There
dialog: won't be any fight. So let me stop
dialog: you right there. I have too much
dialog: respect for women to start throwing
dialog: punches at them, I thank you very
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: So there's no chance of that
dialog: happening.
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: You catch on quick.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: You go by the name Sir Kelvin. Now,
dialog: were you actually knighted by the
dialog: Queen?
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: Is that actually your hair?
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Toupee.
dialog: (flinches)
dialog: Touché. With all due respect, Mr.
dialog: Wingfield, it sounds like your ex-
dialog: means business. Are you aware that
dialog: she upset Gladys the Gravedigger?
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: No, I wasn't aware. But I can't say
dialog: it surprises me either.
scene_heading: INT. MALL - RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
text: A suspended television is tuned into Kelvin's interview.
speaker_heading: ON SCREEN
text: Kelvin and the Reporter walk and talk.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: So you feel that your ex-fiancée
dialog: does have enough talent to --
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: No, I mean it doesn't surprise me
dialog: that the judges would squeeze her
dialog: through.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: But the decision was unanimous.
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: Look. She's real friendly with
dialog: people. And she likes to have a
dialog: good time. I guess it pays to make
dialog: yourself available that way.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Just a sec. Are you suggesting there
dialog: was some impropriety on the part of
dialog: Miss MacIntosh?
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: We're just talking. But let me ask
dialog: you this... have you ever known a
dialog: pretty woman to not use looks to her
dialog: advantage?
speaker_heading: RESTAURANT
text: Delilah watches the TV, her eyes crimson with rage. She
text: does an about-face and stomps out of the restaurant.
scene_heading: INT. MALL - FORMAL WEAR SHOP -- NIGHT
text: Delilah barges in, surprising a small SALESCLERK, 50s, with
text: a distinctive white moustache. He drops a box of hangers.
speaker_heading: SALESCLERK
dialog: (composes himself)
dialog: May I help you, madam?
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Yes, I need a tuxedo. Size thirty-

text: Salesclerk looks scared. He positions himself behind a rack.
scene_heading: INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - DELILAH'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Delilah stands in the center of her room, drawing on
text: something. She steps back a few paces to get a better look.
speaker_heading: SLAMMAN
text: Now decked out in a tuxedo and a white bow tie. A pencil
text: moustache, drawn in permanent marker, lines his upper lip.
text: Delilah eyes SlamMan with perfect fury. Slowly, she slides
text: on her bag gloves.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: This is gonna hurt you a lot more
dialog: than it's gonna hurt me.
text: She unleashes hell.
scene_heading: INT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM -- DAY

scene_heading: INT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM - LOCKER ROOM -- DAY
text: Delilah marches over to the
speaker_heading: SINKS
text: and sets her gym bag on the counter. She pulls out a brush.
text: As Delilah brushes her hair, she spots Slice two sinks over,
text: applying makeup. She wears a pale purple blouse.
text: Slice scowls at Delilah through the reflection.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Must be hard.
speaker_heading: SLICE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Hatin' someone you don't even know.
speaker_heading: SLICE
dialog: You mean you?
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: SLICE
dialog: I know enough.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Where're you goin' all fancied up?
speaker_heading: SLICE
dialog: What's it to you?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Just makin' conversation. If you'd
dialog: rather stand here and grimace at
dialog: each other, I guess that's fine.
dialog: (wraps her ponytail)
dialog: Got a lunch date?
text: Slice looks at Delilah askew.
dialog: She folds
speaker_heading: SLICE
dialog: Hank's taking me to that Thai
dialog: restaurant that opened up.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Oh the one on Hanover? I been meanin'
dialog: to try that one. By the way, that
dialog: blush is all wrong for you.
dialog: (zips up her gym bag)
speaker_heading: SLICE
dialog: No it ain't.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Course it is.
text: her arms like a professor eager to pontificate.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Makeup one-oh-one. You're either
text: cool, cool, cool or warm, warm, warm.
speaker_heading: SLICE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: You've got auburn hair. Nice auburn
dialog: hair, as a matter of fact. That was
dialog: a compliment, don't let it fluster
dialog: you. Your colorin' is both warm and
dialog: intense. So guess what? You want
dialog: your makeup and clothes to match.
text: Warm, warm, warm.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: That blush is too light for you.
dialog: Makes you look harsh. And you don't
dialog: need any help with that. Let me
dialog: see, I might just have somethin’...
text: She unzips her gym bag and dumps a cornucopia of makeup onto
text: the counter.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: (sifting through it)
dialog: That one's too light. No, not that
dialog: one. HERE. This'll work. Autumn.
dialog: It won't wash you out. Now go on
dialog: and rinse that stuff off your face.
text: Slice hesitates.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Go on, now. You don't wanna go ona
dialog: date lookin' like Casper the Friendly
dialog: Ghost, do ya?
text: Slice washes her face.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Here's a towel.
dialog: (tosses one from her
dialog: bag)
dialog: Nothin' I like more than a clean
dialog: slate. Now, is that the only shirt
dialog: you got?
speaker_heading: SLICE
dialog: I usually wear one at a time.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I'll see what I got in the car.
text: She skedaddles. Slice watches her leave. She looks over
text: the abundance of makeup, glimpses herself in the mirror.
text: She's just not accustomed to this level of attention.
scene_heading: INT. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
text: Abby walks with her friend, MELISSA. Both carry backpacks.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I can't believe Mr. Hogan is having

dialog: what do you say... they're slow, and
text: slimy, and French people eat them.
dialog: Case closed.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: At least we don't have to dissect
dialog: them. That would really suck.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY
text: They exit the building.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Call me if you're not doing anything
dialog: later. I'll come over and show you
dialog: those boots I got.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Later.
text: She veers course, cutting across the playground.
text: The sound of RUNNING footsteps behind her, culminating with
text: the SNAP of Abby's bra.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Cut the shit, you asshole!
text: TOMMY WILLIS has got about a hundred pounds on Abby, with
text: rosy cheeks. His THREE BUDDIES are skinny and pale.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (mocking)
dialog: Cut the shit, you asshole.
text: The Buddies laugh hysterically.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Why don't you make me?
text: Abby thinks about it. She removes the backpack from her
text: shoulder and drops it casually to the ground.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Okay.
text: She raises her sleeves and puts up her dukes.
dialog: Tommy looks at his Buddies befuddled: you really think I
dialog: should fight this girl?
text: He turns to face Abby, raises his fists.
speaker_heading: BUDDIES
dialog: (chanting)
text: TOMMY...
text: Tommy bends his head forward, pumps his fists. He peeks at
text: Abby through his eyebrows. An evil grin spreads out over
text: his face.
dialog: 84.
text: They move in a circle. Tommy throws a few weak punches,
text: thinking it will intimidate Abby. It doesn't.
text: He decides to go for the stomach. Mistake. Abby catches
text: Tommy with an UPPERCUT that brings him to an upright position.
text: This sets her up nicely for a ONE-TWO that drops him on his
text: ass. The Buddies double over laughing.
speaker_heading: BUDDIES
dialog: (chanting)
text: ABBY...
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Come on. Get up, Bubbalicious.
text: Tommy is more staggered than he'd like to admit. He can't
text: quite make it to his feet.
text: A final crowd-pleaser: Abby reaches into her shirt and undoes
text: her bra. The Buddies jump about like they're auditioning
dialog: for Springer.
text: Abby approaches Tommy from behind and manages to clasp the
text: bra around his enormous torso.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You're gonna need a bigger cup size.
scene_heading: INT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM -- NIGHT
text: Delilah, alone in the corner, affixes iron plates toa
text: barbell. By the looks of her, she's been at it all day.
text: She lies down to bench press. Manages to lift the bar up.
text: Squeezes out three reps.
text: She goes for a fourth, brings the weight down to her chest.
text: But that's it. She's on empty. Delilah struggles but she
text: can't get the bar off her chest. Deep breath, one more try.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Motherfuckin' horseshit cocksucker
dialog: fuckin' piece of shit asshole
dialog: motherfuckin' shitstain bitch!
dialog: The Gym-goers are not accustomed to hearing this language
text: from Delilah. They look on in sheer horror as she adds
text: complexity to her litany of profanity.
text: Tandy emerges from her office.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: (to Gym-goers)
dialog: Are you fuckin' BLIND?
text: She races over and snags the barbell, sets it on the rack.
dialog: Delilah's
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Trying to kill yourself, Goldilocks?
text: too spent to reply. She sits up, gasping for air.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Should I look outside and see if the
dialog: moon's blood red?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: I never heard you swear like that.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I save it. Special occasions only.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: I see. How's the hunt for a trainer
dialog: going?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: It's goin'. No, that's a lie. Tell
dialog: you the truth, I haven't been lookin'.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I wouldn't wanna put anyone else
dialog: through the trouble.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Whaddya mean?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: There's only so many people you can
dialog: let down 'fore you start feelin'
dialog: ashamed o' yourself.
dialog: (lies down on bench)
dialog: A lot easier this way.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Why didn't you tell me about wanting
dialog: to fight Kelvin?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I heard what you said to Slice. The
dialog: day I walked in here. I figured...
dialog: (fighting herself)
dialog: It's still no excuse for lyin'.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: What makes you think he would fight
dialog: you? After all this, he could just
dialog: say no.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I s'pose he could. Already done it
dialog: once. Guess I didn't think that far
dialog: ahead.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Or worse, what if he did fight you
dialog: and kicked your teeth in? Say Goodbye
dialog: to Magnolia Princess. And how's that
dialog: for embarrassing? Getting beat up
dialog: by the guy who left you at the altar.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Never said it was gonna be easy.
dialog: But that's how I know it's right.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: You feel like getting outta here for
dialog: a while?
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER -- DAY
text: Delilah and Tandy in a rowboat. Delilah does all the work.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: This was a great idea. Nice to be

speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: (fixes her hair)
dialog: So how does your boyfriend -- Nathan,
dialog: is it?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Nate.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: How does he feel about you boxing
dialog: Kelvin?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: He's very supportive.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Isn't he worried you might get hurt?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I s'pose so. Anything happens, at
dialog: least he's a doctor.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Yeah, that's right. The way you two
dialog: met. You got yourself a story right
dialog: there. All this time spent trying
dialog: to hook up at the bar... I shoulda
dialog: tried the ER.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: So uh... do you have a boyfriend?
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: No. I don't.
text: An uncomfortable silence.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: You two have gone out quite some
dialog: time, haven't you?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: "Bout five months.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: You think he might be the one?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Sure feels like it.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: (mulls it over)
dialog: Because I don't have to ask.
text: Tandy realizes that's checkmate. She curls her frown of
text: discontent into a smile, for Delilah's sake.
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: You know, you're gonna need to attract
dialog: more attention if you wanna get Kelvin
dialog: in the ring with you. And for that,
dialog: you need a gimmick.

speaker_heading: MR. NADDLE
dialog: Ms. Burrows. What brings you here?
text: He leans back in his swivel chair and props up his feet.
dialog: Wouldn't you know, he's wearing beach sandals. Eight toes,

speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: (looking away)
dialog: My client would like to formally
dialog: challenge your fighter, Mr. Wingfield,
text: to a three-round bout.

text: back into shape.
speaker_heading: MR. NADDLE
dialog: I'd be happy to run the idea past

speaker_heading: TANDY

speaker_heading: MR. NADDLE
dialog: Is something the matter?

speaker_heading: DELILAH

speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Oh right. I guess one of the tenants
dialog: complained that I was blasting k.d.
dialog: lang all day. And I'm like, Grits-
dialog: for-Brains, I'm at the gym all day.
dialog: So it couldn't be me. Besides, I

speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: I'm sorry, Sweetie. He said No.
text: The bottom falls out from under Delilah.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: Probably cuz he's scared. But I'm
dialog: sure he'll tell his society friends
dialog: something different.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: That's awful. You mean all this was
dialog: just...
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: I can see how it feels that way.
dialog: But look at you, you're in the best

dialog: You met some new people...
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I know but...
speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Should count for something.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: It does but... I'm not sure where

speaker_heading: TANDY
dialog: You're in a bar. Having a drink.

speaker_heading: DELILAH

speaker_heading: NATE

speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: This might've been the first thing I

text: Kelvin shares a chuckle with the Folks.
speaker_heading: BEST MAN

speaker_heading: BEST MAN
dialog: She just had... so much energy. You
dialog: know? Tons and tons of spunk. Inside

dialog: decision is umaninous. I mean,
text: umaminous. No wait. Unaminous.
dialog: Sorry. U-nan-i-mous.
text: A few mock cheers.
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: BEST MAN
dialog: They're just made for each other.

speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Good evenin'. How y'all doin'?
text: The disguise comes off.
speaker_heading: BUCK
dialog: Get down! She's got a bomb!

speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Honestly, you should move to Hollywood

dialog: and Marney, so nice to see you...
dialog: (waves )
dialog: I'm sorry to startle you nice folks.
dialog: I don't make a habit of crashin'

dialog: of. I'd like all y'all to meet my
dialog: boyfriend, Doctor Nate More.
text: Nate offers a brief wave from the back of the room.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Doctor More works over at County
dialog: Hospital. And for those of you who
dialog: don't know, the hospital's in need
dialog: of more space. But they lack the
dialog: necessary funds. Some o' the patients
dialog: there wind up gettin' treated in the
dialog: hallway. It's happened to me. Raise
dialog: your hand if this's happened to you.
text: The Folks look at each other bewildered.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Go on, don't be shy.
text: Some of the older Folks raise their hands.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: See, Nate 'n I didn't care for that.
dialog: So we went ahead and started up a
dialog: charity drive. It's called Room to
dialog: Grow. Now why am I tellin' you nice
dialog: folks this? Well, I'd like to take
dialog: this opportunity to invite Mr.
dialog: Wingfield here to join me in the
dialog: ring.
text: Kelvin smirks at his constituency, wags his finger at Delilah.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: All proceeds from the bout would go
dialog: toward expandin' the hospital. 'Fore
dialog: you know it, y'all won't have to
dialog: leave your flowers out in the hall
dialog: when you go visit Grandma after she
dialog: falls 'n breaks her hip. Or when
text: Grandpa throws out his back. Wouldn't
dialog: that be nice?
text: Nods and murmurs of agreement.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I can't speak for Kelvin, but I find
dialog: boxin' to be empowerin', ya know?
dialog: It's changed my life entirely. And
dialog: I just think if there's a way of
dialog: improvin' someone else's life, by
dialog: golly I'm gonna do it. Amazin' what
dialog: throwin' a few punches can do. Wanna
dialog: try it with me?
text: She throws a slow series of left and right jabs, alternating.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Come on now. It's just me.

text: falls flat on his back.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Itn't it fun? Everybody! You, too,
dialog: bridegroom.
dialog: (chants)
scene_heading: KELVIN... KELVIN... KELVIN...
text: The number of Folks jabbing, and chanting, grows and grows.

dialog: 96.
scene_heading: INT. KELVIN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN -- DAY
text: Kelvin broods over the society pages. A topless Marney plops

speaker_heading: KELVIN

speaker_heading: MARNEY
dialog: Always was. Ever since we were kids.
dialog: Any idea when the fight would happen?
speaker_heading: KELVIN

speaker_heading: MARNEY

speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: Point that thing away from me. It's

text: Marney opens the box.
scene_heading: A NALONI BUCINTORO WATCH

speaker_heading: KELVIN

speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Well, it wouldn't be sanctioned, so

speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: I can think of at least two places

speaker_heading: MIRABELLE

speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Thanks, Daddy. I appreciate you

speaker_heading: SAMUEL

speaker_heading: MIRABELLE

speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: You know what? I think I might have
dialog: a better idea.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: Why not have it here?
scene_heading: DELILAH MIRABELLE
text: ABSOLUTELY NOT.

speaker_heading: SAMUEL

speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: That would be fantastic, Daddy!
text: up and kisses her father on the forehead.
speaker_heading: MIRABELLE
dialog: You can ignore me all you want. But
dialog: there will be NO boxing match at
dialog: this house. Is that understood? I
dialog: won't stand for it.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: No. You will stand for it. This is
dialog: our house. And this is something
dialog: our daughter wants. If you don't
dialog: want to be part of it, that's your
dialog: prerogative. And your loss.
text: Mirabelle SMASHES the dishes in the sink and scampers away.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Was that a rebuttal?
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
