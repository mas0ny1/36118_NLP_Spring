speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. NORTH SEA/VILLAGE - NIGHT
text: We skim above a dark, wild ocean. The camera turns toward a
text: lone island, Berk. It is a gigantic shard of rock jutting
text: straight out of the water.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.)
dialog: This, is Berk. It's twelve days
text: North of hopeless, and a few
text: degrees South of freezing to death.
text: It's located solidly on the
dialog: meridian of misery.
text: The camera drifts over rolling hills to reveal a small
text: village nestled on an outcropping of sea mounts.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: My village. In a word, sturdy.
dialog: And it's been here for seven
dialog: generations, but every single
text: building is new.
text: The camera drifts closer, circling.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: We have fishing, hunting, and a
text: charming view of the sunsets. The
dialog: only problems are the pests. You
dialog: see, most places have mice or
dialog: mosquitos. We have...
text: Sheep graze peacefully on a hillside. Suddenly one is
dialog: snatched.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. STOICK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: A door is pulled open... as a DRAGON swoops directly toward
text: it, BLASTING FIRE. The door is SLAMMED. The fire shoots
text: through the slats of wood, illuminating HICCUP, a gangly
text: teenage Viking.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: ...dragons.
scene_heading: EXT. STOICK'S HOUSE
text: He reopens the sizzling door, as leaps off of the front
text: porch. He weaves through the erupting mayhem as Vikings pour
text: out of the buildings, ready for a fight.

scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 2.
text: More dragons swarm in, setting rooftops alight and hauling
dialog: off sheep.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.)
dialog: Most people would leave. Not us.
dialog: We're Vikings. We have stubbornness
dialog: issues.
text: Vikings sound the alarm. Viking men and women pour out into
text: the streets, axes in hand.
text: ON HICCUP darting through alleys, staying under eaves, making
text: his way through the battle.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: My name's Hiccup. Great name, I
dialog: know. But it's not the worst.
dialog: Parents believe a hideous name will
text: frighten off gnomes and trolls.
dialog: Like our charming Viking demeanor
dialog: wouldn't do that.
text: Dragons sweep back and forth, dodging axes and blasting the
text: Vikings who throw them. A burly warrior gets tossed in an
text: explosion, knocking Hiccup to the ground.
speaker_heading: VIKING
speaker_heading: (FIERCE)
dialog: Arggghhhhh!
dialog: (cheery, insane)
dialog: Mornin'!
text: Hiccup gets to his feet and continues to rush past gigantic
dialog: men and women.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.)
dialog: Meet the neighbors. Hoark the
dialog: Haggard...
speaker_heading: HOARK
dialog: What are you doing out!?
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: ... Burnthair the Broad...
speaker_heading: BURNTHAIR
dialog: Get inside!
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: ... Phlegma the Fierce...
scene_heading: PHLEGMA THE FIERCE
dialog: Get back inside!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 3.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: . Ack.
text: He passes a silent ox of a viking, picking his ear.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Yep, just Ack.
text: Enter STOICK, the biggest Viking of all. He yanks Hiccup from
text: the path of a strafing dragon and holds aloft to the crowd.
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: Hiccup!?
dialog: (accusingly; to the crowd)
dialog: What is he doing out again?!
speaker_heading: (TO HICCUP)
dialog: What are you doing out?! Get
dialog: inside!
text: The flames light up his scowling face and matted red beard.
text: He sets Hiccup down and turns to the sky, searching.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.)
speaker_heading: (IN AWE)
dialog: That's Stoick the Vast. Chief of
dialog: the tribe. They say that when he
dialog: was a baby he popped a dragon's
text: head clean off of its shoulders.
dialog: Do I believe it?
text: Stoick grabs a wooden cart and hurls it, knocking the
text: strafing dragon out of the sky.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes I do.
text: An EXPLOSION forces Vikings to DUCK. Stoick stands firm,
text: brushing flaming debris off of his shoulder.
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: (barking; to his men)
dialog: What have we got?
speaker_heading: VIKING #1
dialog: Gronkles. Nadders. Zipplebacks. Oh,
dialog: and Hoark saw a Monstrous
dialog: Nightmare.
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: Any Night Furies?
speaker_heading: VIKING #1
dialog: None so far.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 4.
speaker_heading: STOICK
speaker_heading: (RELIEVED)
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: VIKING
dialog: Hoist the torches!
text: Massive flaming braziers are raised on poles, lighting up the
text: night sky... and revealing swirling dragons of all types.
text: Below, Hiccup crosses an open plaza and ducks into an open
text: building with a tall chimney.
scene_heading: INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - CONTINUOUS
text: He crosses behind a counter, where a peg-legged, one-armed
text: hulk of a Blacksmith reshapes blades with a hammer and tongs
dialog: appendage.
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Ah! Nice of you to join the party.
dialog: I thought you'd been carried off.
text: Hiccup dons a leather apron and starts to put away Gobber's
text: scattered appendages.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Who me? Nah, come on! I'm way too
dialog: muscular for their taste. They
dialog: wouldn't know what to do with all
dialog: this.
text: Hiccup strikes a bodybuilder pose.
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: They need toothpicks, don't they?
text: Hiccup gets to work, transferring bent and chipped weapons to
text: the forge as Vikings crowd the counter for replacements.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.)
text: The meathead with attitude and
text: interchangeable hands is Gobber.
dialog: I've been his apprentice ever since
dialog: I was little. Well...littler.
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: ON STOICK
speaker_heading: STOICK
text: We move to the lower defenses.
dialog: We'll counter-attack with the
text: catapults.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 5.
text: Armed men rush past, flanking others who carry sheep to
text: safety. Stoick follows up the rear as, overhead, a dragon
text: strafes the rooftops with Napalm-like fire.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.)
dialog: See? Old village. Lots and lots
dialog: of new houses.
speaker_heading: VIKING
speaker_heading: FIRE!
text: In response, the fire brigade charges through the plaza --
text: four TEENS, tugging a large wooden cask on wheels. From it,
text: they fill buckets of water to douse the flames. One among
text: them is a cute, energetic Viking girl.
text: Hiccup leans out of the stall to watch her.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.)
dialog: Oh and that's Fishlegs, Snotlout.
text: The twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut.
dialog: And...
speaker_heading: (DREAMY)
dialog: Astrid.
text: A SLOW-MOTION explosion erupts behind her, framing her in a
text: sexy ball of fire. The others join her, looking awesome and
dialog: heroic.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Their job is so much cooler.
text: Hiccup tries to join them as they pass, but he's hooked by
text: Gobber and hoisted back inside.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (PLEADING)
dialog: Ah, come on. Let me out, please. I
dialog: need to make my mark.
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Oh, you've made plenty of marks.
dialog: All in the wrong places.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Please, two minutes. I'll kill a
dialog: dragon. My life will get infinitely
dialog: better. I might even get a date.
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: You can't lift a hammer. You can't
dialog: swing an axe...
text: Gobber grabs a bola (iron balls connected by rope).
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 6.
speaker_heading: GOBBER (CONT'D)
dialog: ... you can't even throw one of
dialog: these.
text: A Viking runs by and nabs it out of Gobber's hand, hurling it
text: at a dive-bombing Gronkle. The bola binds its legs, sending
text: it into a heavy crash.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: (ready with the answer)
dialog: Okay fine, but...
text: He rushes to the back corner of the stall and presents a
text: bizarre, wheel barrow-like contraption.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: ... this will throw it for me.
text: Hiccup OPENS the hinged lid of the device. An arm springs up,
text: equipped with twin bows. They prematurely launch a bola,
text: narrowly missing Gobber... and taking out a Viking at the
dialog: counter.
speaker_heading: VIKING
dialog: Arggh!
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: See, now this right here is what
dialog: I'm talking about.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Mild calibration issue.
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Hiccup. If you ever want to get out
dialog: there to fight dragons, you need
dialog: to stop all...
text: Gobber gestures in Hiccup's general direction.
speaker_heading: GOBBER (CONT'D)
dialog: ... this.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
speaker_heading: (ASTONISHED)
dialog: But... you just pointed to all of
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Yes! That's it! Stop being all of
dialog: you.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 7.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
speaker_heading: (THREATENING)
dialog: Ohhhh...
speaker_heading: GOBBER
speaker_heading: (MIMICKING)
dialog: Ohhhhh, yes.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: You, sir, are playing a dangerous
dialog: game. Keeping this much,
dialog: raw...Vikingness contained.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: There will be consequences!
text: Gobber tosses him a sword.
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: I'll take my chances. Sword.
dialog: Sharpen. Now.
text: Hiccup takes it begrudgingly and lobs it onto the grinding
text: wheel. He stews... fantasizing...
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.)
dialog: One day I'll get out there. Because
dialog: killing a dragon is everything
dialog: around here.
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE - LOWER PLAINS - CONTINUOUS
text: Nadders land, gathering like seagulls around a seemingly
text: vacant house.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.)
dialog: A Nadder head is sure to get me at
dialog: least noticed.
text: The Nadders clamber onto the building, tearing the roof and
text: walls apart. Sheep pour out and SCATTER.
text: Elsewhere, hippo-like Gronckles pick drying racks clean of
text: fish and fly off like loaded pelicans.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
text: Gronckles are tough. Taking down
dialog: one of those would definitely get
dialog: me a girlfriend.
text: A stealthy, snake-like dragon head peeks over a rooftop,
text: breathing gas into a chimney.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 8.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: A Zippelback? Exotic, exciting. Two
dialog: heads, twice the status.
text: A second head pokes through the door and lights it. KABLAM!
text: The two heads fly through the explosion, their necks zipping
text: together to reveal a single body.
text: It flies past Stoick as he climbs to the top of a CATAPULT
text: TOWER.
speaker_heading: CATAPULT OPERATOR
dialog: They found the sheep!
speaker_heading: STOICK
speaker_heading: (FRUSTRATED)
text: Concentrate fire over the lower
dialog: bank!
speaker_heading: CATAPULT OPERATOR
dialog: Fire!
text: Boulders are catapulted at the corralling Nadders...
text: Just as a huge red dragon whips past, spraying the base of
text: the catapult with sticky fire.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.)
dialog: And then there's the Monstrous
dialog: Nightmare. Only the best Vikings go
dialog: after those. They have this nasty
dialog: habit of setting themselves on
dialog: fire.
text: It emerges from the flames, climbing the catapult with a
text: leering, toothy grin.
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: Reload! I'll take care of this.
text: Stoick takes on the Nightmare, face to hammer.
text: Suddenly, a LOUD BALLISTIC MOANING streaks overhead. The
text: catapult crew ducks.
scene_heading: INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - CONTINUOUS
text: ON HICCUP, looking up from his work, reacting to the same
dialog: sound.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.)
dialog: But the ultimate prize is the
dialog: dragon no one has ever seen. We
dialog: call it the--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 9.
speaker_heading: VIKING
dialog: Night Fury! Get down!
text: Vikings everywhere take shelter. The moaning sound BUILDS.
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE - CATAPULT - CONTINUOUS
text: The Monstrous Nightmare suddenly stops fighting and takes
text: flight. Stoick looks skyward.
speaker_heading: STOICK
speaker_heading: JUMP!
text: KABOOM! The Catapult EXPLODES as though hit by an artillery
text: shell... sending Stoick and the crew leaping for their lives.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.)
dialog: This thing never steals food, never
dialog: shows itself, and...
text: The sound recedes, leaving the crippled catapult in flames.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: ...never misses.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: No one has ever killed a Night
dialog: Fury. That's why I'm going to be
dialog: the first.
scene_heading: IN THE STALL
text: Gobber trades his hammer for an axe.
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Man the fort, Hiccup, they need me
dialog: out there!
text: Gobber pauses. Turns with a threatening glare.
speaker_heading: GOBBER (CONT'D)
dialog: Stay. Put. There. You know what I
dialog: mean.
text: Gobber charges into the fray, HOLLERING.
text: ON HICCUP, a smirk crosses his face.
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER
text: WHAM! Hiccup pushes his wheeled contraption through a wall of
text: clustered Vikings. He weaves through the ongoing mayhem, as
text: fast as his legs can carry him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 10.
speaker_heading: VIKING #6 (O.S.)
dialog: Hiccup, where are you going!
speaker_heading: VIKING #7
dialog: Come back here!
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: I know. Be right back!
text: ON THE PLAIN BELOW
text: The Nadders have cornered the house-full of sheep. They close
text: in, ready to spring upon them.
text: Stoick suddenly appears, HURLING FISHING NETS over them. The
text: surprised Nadders are caught. Stoick and his men rush in.
text: A Nadder blasts a hole through its net. Stoick leaps onto it,
text: clamping his thick arms around its head, forcing its jaws
dialog: shut.
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: Mind yourselves! The devils still
dialog: have some juice in them.
text: ON THE PLAIN ABOVE
text: Hiccup reaches a cliff overlooking the smoking CATAPULT and
text: drops the handles to the ground. He cranks several levers,
text: unfolding and then cocking the bowed arms of his contraption.
text: He drops a bola onto a chamber and then pivots the weapon on
text: a gimbal head toward the dark sky.
text: He listens, with his eye pressed to the scope, hand poised on
text: the trigger. He hears the NIGHT FURY approaching... and turns
text: his aim to the defense tower. It closes in for the final
text: strike, completely camouflaged in the night.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: Come on. Give me something to shoot
dialog: at, give me something to shoot at.
text: KABLAM! The tower topples. The blast of fire illuminates the
text: dragon for a split second. Hiccup pulls the trigger.
text: KERTHUNK! The flexed arms SNAP forward, springing the weapon
text: off the ground. The bola disappears into the sky, followed by
text: a WHACK and a SCREECH.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 11.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: (surprised, then elated)
dialog: Oh I hit it! Yes, I hit it! Did
dialog: anybody see that?
text: Hiccup's victory is short-lived. A Monstrous Nightmare
text: appears, slithering up over the lip of the cliff.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Except for you.
text: ON STOICK, holding down the netted Nadders. He hears a
text: familiar HOLLER and looks up to see...
text: HICCUP running through the PLAZA, SCREAMING, with the
text: NIGHTMARE fast on his heels.
text: Alarmed, Stoick abandons the Nadders and runs off.
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: (to his men, re: the
speaker_heading: NADDERS)
dialog: DO NOT let them escape!
speaker_heading: IN THE PLAZA
text: Vikings scatter as Hiccup dodges a near fatal blast. The
text: Nightmare's sticky, Napalm-like fire splashes up onto
text: buildings, setting them alight.
text: Hiccup ducks behind the last standing brazier -- the only
text: shelter available. The Nightmare blasts it, spraying fire all
text: around him. Hiccup peers around the smoldering post. No sign
dialog: of the Nightmare.
text: He turns back to find it leering at him, blocking his escape.
text: It takes a deep breath. Hiccup is finished.
text: Suddenly, Stoick LEAPS between them, tackling the Nightmare
text: to the ground. They tumble and wrestle, resuming their
text: earlier fight. The Nightmare tries to toast him, but only
text: coughs up smoke.
speaker_heading: STOICK (CONT'D)
dialog: You're all out.
text: He smashes the Nightmare repeatedly in the face, driving it
text: away. It takes to the air and disappears. Winded, Stoick
text: turns to Hiccup.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.)
dialog: Oh, and there's one more thing you
dialog: need to know...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 12.
text: The burnt brazier pole collapses, sending the massive iron
text: basket crashing. It bounces down the hill, destroying as it
text: goes and scattering the Vikings who were holding down the
text: netted Nadders. The freed dragons escape... with several
text: sheep in tow.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry, dad.
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE - UPPER PLAZA - CONTINUOUS
text: The escaped Nadders fly past with sheep in their clutches.
text: The raid is over. The dragons have clearly won.
text: The murmuring crowd eyes Stoick, awaiting his response.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
speaker_heading: (SHEEPISH)
dialog: Okay, but I hit a Night Fury.
text: Stoick grabs Hiccup by the back scruff of his collar and
text: hauls him away, fuming with embarrassment.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: It's not like the last few times,
dialog: Dad. I mean I really actually hit
dialog: it. You guys were busy and I had a
dialog: very clear shot. It went down, just
dialog: off Raven Point. Let's get a search
dialog: party out there, before it--
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: --STOP! Just....stop.
text: He releases Hiccup. Everyone goes silent, staring
text: expectantly.
speaker_heading: STOICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Every time you step outside,
dialog: disaster follows. Can you not see
dialog: that I have bigger problems?
dialog: Winter's almost here and I have an
dialog: entire village to feed!
text: Hiccup looks around. All eyes are upon him.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Between you and me, the village
dialog: could do with a little less
dialog: feeding, don't ya think?
text: A few rotund Vikings stir self-consciously.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 13.
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: This isn't a joke, Hiccup!
speaker_heading: (EXASPERATED)
dialog: Why can't you follow the simplest
dialog: orders?
speaker_heading: HICCUP
text: I can't stop myself. I see a dragon
dialog: and I have to just... kill it, you
dialog: know? It's who I am, Dad.
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: You are many things, Hiccup. But a
dialog: dragon killer is not one of them.
text: Sting. Hiccup looks around to see many nods of agreement.
speaker_heading: STOICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Get back to the house.
speaker_heading: (TO GOBBER)
dialog: Make sure he gets there. I have his
dialog: mess to clean up.
text: Stoick lumbers off in the opposite direction.
text: Gobber leads Hiccup through the walk of shame. They pass the
text: teen fire brigade as they snicker.
speaker_heading: TUFFNUT
dialog: Quite the performance.
speaker_heading: SNOTLOUT
dialog: I've never seen anyone mess up that
dialog: badly. That helped!
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Thank you, thank you. I was
dialog: trying, so...
text: Hiccup avoids Astrid's glare and heads up toward a large
text: house, standing prominently on the hill above the others.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: I really did hit one.
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Sure, Hiccup.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
text: He never listens.
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Well, it runs in the family.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 14.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: And when he does, it's always with
dialog: this... disappointed scowl. Like
text: someone skimped on the meat in his
dialog: sandwich.
scene_heading: (MIMICKING STOICK)
dialog: Excuse me, barmaid. I'm afraid you
dialog: brought me the wrong offspring. I
dialog: ordered an extra large boy with
text: beefy arms. Extra guts and glory on
dialog: the side. This here. This is a
text: talking fish bone.
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: You're thinking about this all
dialog: wrong. It's not so much what you
dialog: look like. It's what's inside that
dialog: he can't stand.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Thank you, for summing that up.
text: They reach the doorway.
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Look, the point is, stop trying so
dialog: hard to be something you're not.
text: Hiccup SIGHS heavily.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: I just want to be one of you guys.
text: Gobber eyes him sympathetically. Hiccup turns and goes
text: through the front door.
text: And straight out the back door. He hurries off into the
text: woods, determined.
scene_heading: INT. GREAT HALL - DAY
text: A noisy din of PROTESTING VOICES leads to...
text: STOICK, glowering in the firelight. Surrounded by his men.
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: Either we finish them or they'll
dialog: finish us! It's the only way we'll
dialog: be rid of them! If we find the
dialog: nest and destroy it, the dragons
dialog: will leave. They'll find another
dialog: home.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 15.
text: He sinks his blade into a...
text: LARGE NAUTICAL MAP, spread out on the table... the blade
text: pierces the middle of an uncharted corner, swirling with
text: painted sea monsters and dragons.
speaker_heading: STOICK (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (DECIDEDLY)
text: One more search. Before the ice
text: sets in.
speaker_heading: VIKING
dialog: Those ships never come back.
speaker_heading: STOICK
speaker_heading: (MATTER-OF-FACT)
dialog: We're Vikings. It's an occupational
dialog: hazard. Now who's with me?
text: Stoick throws up his fist. No one follows. The crowds shifts
text: in restless silence. Head scratches. Eyes averted.
speaker_heading: VIKING
speaker_heading: (FEEBLE)
dialog: Today's not good for me.
speaker_heading: VIKING (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (EQUALLY FEEBLE)
dialog: I've gotta do my axe returns.
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: Alright. Those who stay will look
dialog: after Hiccup.
text: Hands jut into the air, volunteers galore. Enthusiastic
text: murmurs of prep and packing fill the room.
scene_heading: PHLEGMA THE FIERCE
dialog: To the ships!
speaker_heading: SPITELOUT
dialog: I'm with you Stoick!
speaker_heading: STOICK
speaker_heading: (DRY)
dialog: That's more like it.
text: The Vikings rush for the door, leaving Gobber and Stoick
text: alone. Gobber gulps back the contents of his tankard
text: attachment and scrapes back the bench.
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: I'll pack my undies.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 16.
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: No, I need you to stay and train
text: some new recruits.
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Oh, perfect. And while I'm busy,
dialog: Hiccup can cover the stall. Molten
text: steel, razor sharp blades, lots of
dialog: time to himself...what could
dialog: possibly go wrong?
text: Stoick sinks onto the bench beside Gobber, his brow burdened.
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: What am I going to do with him
dialog: Gobber?
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Put him in training with the
dialog: others.
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: No, I'm serious.

speaker_heading: STOICK

speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: You got a headache.
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: That rock split in two. It taught

dialog: He could crush mountains, level

text: A drawn map of the island, covered in X's.
text: Hiccup looks up from it and peeks over a gorge, expectantly.
dialog: Sees nothing.
text: He adds another 'X' to the page, then scratches his pencil
text: over the whole map in frustration. He snaps the book closed
text: and pockets it.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Uggh, the gods hate me. Some people
dialog: lose their knife or their mug. No,
dialog: not me. I manage to lose an entire
dialog: dragon.
text: Hiccup WHACKS a low-hanging branch. It SNAPS back at him,
text: hitting him in the face. He looks up to see a snapped tree
text: trunk. His eyes follow it to a long trench of up-turned
dialog: earth.
text: He follows it to a downed, black dragon, its body and tail
text: tangled in a bola. It appears dead. Hiccup approaches,

speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (IN SHOCK)
dialog: Oh wow. I did it. I did it. This

speaker_heading: (ELATED)

speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoa!
text: Hiccup springs back, terrified. He turns his blade on it.
text: Rattled, Hiccup creeps along the length of the weak, wounded
text: dragon, dagger poised to strike.
text: As he reaches the head, Hiccup finds the Night Fury staring
text: coldly at him. Hiccup tries to look away, but he's drawn back
text: to its unnerving, unflinching stare.
text: With the dragon safety tangled in the ropes, Hiccup jabs with
text: his dagger, puffing himself up with false bravado.

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I am a VIKING!
text: Hiccup raises the dagger, determined to prove his Viking-
text: ness. The dragon's labored breathing breaks Hiccup's clenched
text: concentration. He opens an eye, uncertainty leaking through.
text: The dragon holds the stare. Something profound is exchanged.
text: Finally, the Night Fury closes its eye and lowers its head,
text: resigned to its fate.
text: Hiccup tries to go through with it, holding the dagger
text: aloft... fighting himself... until finally lowering it with a
text: frustrated sigh.
text: He looks over the dragon's chaffed rope wounds.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: (muttered, ashamed)
dialog: I did this.
text: He turns to leave. Pauses. And glances back at the dragon,
text: chest heaving.
text: Hiccup GRUMBLES. He checks over his shoulder to ensure that
text: no one is watching... then hurries back to cut the ropes.
text: The Night Fury's eye shoots open. With the dragon watching
text: his every move, Hiccup hurriedly saws through the bola ropes.
text: As the last rope falls free, the Night Fury suddenly POUNCES!
text: In a blur, the dragon is upon him, pinning Hiccup down,
text: grazing his neck. Looking like it's about to kill him. Hiccup
text: is paralyzed. The dragon's breath ruffles his hair. Hiccup
text: opens his eyes to find the Night Fury's wolf-like stare
text: boring into him. The exchange is intense, profound.
text: The dragon draws a deep breath, as though it's about to torch
text: him, then lets out an ear-piercing scream instead. It turns
text: and takes flight, flapping violently through the canopy of
text: trees. It bashes against a nearby mountain side, recovers,
text: and drops out of view some distance away.
text: Winded, Hiccup struggles to his feet, staggers a few steps,
text: collapses to his knees, and faints.

speaker_heading: STOICK (CONT'D)
dialog: When you carry this axe... you
dialog: carry all of us with you. Which

dialog: so does that disqualify him or...?
text: The recruits LAUGH and chatter in the background.
speaker_heading: TUFFNUT
dialog: Can I transfer to the class with

text: Gobber throws a supportive arm around Hiccup and ushers him
dialog: along.
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: (cheery, in confidence)
dialog: Don't worry. You're small and
dialog: you're weak. That'll make you less

speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: I believe in learning on the job.

speaker_heading: RUFFNUT

speaker_heading: TUFFNUT

speaker_heading: RUFFNUT
dialog: Ooops, now this one has blood on
dialog: it.
text: The Gronckle takes aim at the distracted twins. Blam! The

text: SPIN like tops and go down.
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Tuffnut, Ruffnut, you're out!
speaker_heading: TUFFNUT
speaker_heading: (DAZED)

speaker_heading: RUFFNUT
speaker_heading: (CONFUSED)

speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Those shields are good for another

speaker_heading: GOBBER

speaker_heading: GOBBER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hiccup, get in there!

text: Snotlout appears, trying to hit on her.
speaker_heading: SNOTLOUT
dialog: So anyway I'm moving into my
dialog: parents' basement. You should come
dialog: by sometime to work out. You look
dialog: like you work out--
text: She cartwheels out of the way, allowing a shot to shoot past

speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Snotlout! You're done!

text: Astrid ROLLS away. A split-second later a lava slug knocks
text: Hiccup's shield clear off of his arm. Hiccup is exposed.
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: One shot left!
text: Hiccup panics and chases after his shield as it rolls across
dialog: the ring.
text: The sudden movement sends the Gronckle chasing after him,
text: leaving Astrid in the clear.
speaker_heading: GOBBER (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (WORRIED)
dialog: Hiccup!
text: The Gronckle drives straight toward Hiccup, pinning him
text: against the wall. It opens its mouth and cocks its tail,
text: ready to fire point-blank.
text: Gobber lunges in and hooks the Gronckle's mouth at the last
text: second, causing its head to jerk back and fire against the
text: stone wall above Hiccup's head.
speaker_heading: GOBBER (CONT'D)
dialog: (rattled, but masking it)
dialog: And that's six!
text: Gobber wrestles the irate Gronckle back into his pen.
speaker_heading: GOBBER (CONT'D)
dialog: Go back to bed, ya overgrown

speaker_heading: GOBBER (CONT'D)
dialog: Remember... a dragon will always,
text: (with a stern look to
speaker_heading: HICCUP)

speaker_heading: (MUTTERED)
dialog: So...why didn't you?
text: He drops the bola and presses on in the direction it flew
text: off. He drops into a rocky crevice and follows it to an...
text: ISOLATED COVE complete with a pristine spring pool. He scans
text: the high stone walls... then notices a single black SCALE on
text: the ground. He crouches and picks it up, studying it.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Well this was stupid.
text: SUDDENLY, the NIGHT FURY blasts past him. Hiccup recoils,
text: watching the massive beast struggle to climb the walls. It
text: flaps violently, then peels away to a rough landing. The
text: dragon is trapped.
text: Hiccup grins, excited to see it again, and slips closer.
text: He watches as the dragon, exhausted and frustrated, leaps
text: into the air, beating its wings furiously. Again and again,
text: it rolls uncontrolled and CRASHES heavily.
text: As if remembering to snap a photo, Hiccup pulls a leather-
text: bound book and flips past drawings of weapons to a blank
text: page. He sketches the dragon quickly, desperate to record the
dialog: image.
text: The Fury claws at the steep rock walls, trying climb out of
text: the cove. It SLIPS and falls hard, crushing several saplings.
text: The Fury rolls back to his feet and slowly crawls to the
text: water's edge. He spots fish in the shallow water and snaps at
text: them... but comes up empty. He lowers his head, looking
dialog: weakened.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (MUTTERED)
dialog: Why don't you just...fly away?
text: ON HICCUP as he spots the problem. He adjusts his drawing,
text: carefully erasing one half of the dragon's tail. He
text: accidentally drops the charcoal stick. It rolls off of the
text: rock outcropping that hides him from view and bounces into
text: the cove. TINK. TINK. TINK.
text: The Night Fury raises his head, spotting Hiccup. They

text: Hiccup squeezes through and enters the cove.
text: A BEAT, then Hiccup hears a SNORT from behind him.
text: Hiccup turns to see the Night Fury, crouched on a rock like a
text: stealthy panther. It descends, approaching him... ready to
text: pounce.
text: Hiccup swallows his fear and offers the fish. Doing so
text: reveals the dagger at his waist. The dragon sees it and
text: hisses. Hiccup reaches for it, eliciting a growl. He pauses,
text: carefully lifts it by the handle, and tosses it away. The
text: dragon calms.
text: As it approaches the fish, Hiccup notices that it's missing
dialog: teeth.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Huh. Toothless. I could've sworn

speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Uh, no. No, I don't have any more.
text: The Fury backs Hiccup against a rock, placing himself the
text: same position as before. The dragon closes in over him,
text: staring blankly.
text: A tense moment passes... then Toothless regurgitates a chunk
text: of fish onto Hiccup's lap. They exchange stares. Hiccup
text: realizes what Toothless wants him to do.
text: Hiccup crouches slowly and squeamishly picks it up.
text: The dragon waits expectantly. Hiccup gags and gnaws off a
text: bite of the slimy fish. He forces a smile. Toothless mimics
dialog: him.
text: Amazed, Hiccup sits up and tries to touch him. Toothless
text: HISSES and flaps off to a crash on the other side of the

text: and curls up on it like a giant dog.
text: He turns to find Hiccup seated beside him. Toothless

text: minding his own business. Toothless appears behind him,

text: Toothless walks off. A moment later, he reappears with an

text: instant growl from Toothless. He steps on it again. Toothless
text: growls again. Realizing how sensitive he is, Hiccup steps
text: carefully between each line, turning round and round until he
text: unwittingly bumps into Toothless.
text: Toothless snorts. Once again, they're face to face. Hiccup
text: slowly extends his hand. Toothless hesitates. Hiccup turns
text: his head away and closes his eyes. To his amazement,
text: Toothless bridges the gap and presses his muzzle against
text: Hiccup's hand.
text: In a flash, the dragon is gone, leaving Hiccup astounded.

speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: No, no, no! It's okay. Yeah, I

scene_heading: INT. BLAKCSMITH STALL - LATER
text: Hiccup adjusts the harness and uses a metal clamp to affix

scene_heading: EXT. SKY/FIELD - DAWN
text: Hiccup and Toothless zip through the air -- his rudimentary
text: harness and tail controls are working, barely. They crash-
text: land in an open field.
text: Hiccup recovers to find Toothless still rolling around in the
text: tall grass. Hiccup discovers that it's a patch of âdragon-
text: nip.' Toothless writhes on his back, tongue wagging, in
dialog: complete bliss.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - MORNING
text: Hiccup grabs the head as instructed, then discreetly pulls a
text: fistful of âdragon-nip' and presses it up to the Gronkle's
text: nose. It immediately stops struggling and goes weak in the
text: knees. Hiccup drops the handful of dragon-nip to the ground.
text: The Gronkle goes down with it, whimpering and blissful.
text: From Gobber and the recruits' point of view, Hiccup is
text: controlling the Gronkle with no more than a limp arm.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON
text: The recruits walk home together, surrounding Hiccup and
text: BOMBARDING HIM WITH QUESTIONS.
speaker_heading: FISHLEGS
dialog: Hey Hiccup, I've never seen a

speaker_heading: TUFFNUT

speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: You guys go on ahead and I'll catch

text: Astrid watches, suspicious.
scene_heading: EXT. COVE - LATER
text: Hiccup rubs Toothless behind the ear, causing him to relax
dialog: and fall over.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - LATER
text: An angry Deadly Nadder approaches Hiccup. Just as Astrid
text: moves in to strike, Hiccup performs his special rubbing
text: technique, which sends the Nadder down. Astrid and the other
text: kids look on from the sideline in amazement.
scene_heading: INT. MEADE HALL - CONTINUOUS
text: Hiccup sits down at a table to eat. The other recruits notice
text: him and move over to his table to talk to him -- leaving
text: Astrid alone.
speaker_heading: FISHLEGS
dialog: Hey Hiccup!
speaker_heading: SNOTLOUT
dialog: What was that? Some kind of trick?
dialog: What did you do?
speaker_heading: TUFFNUT
dialog: Hiccup, you're totally going to
dialog: come in first, there's no question.
scene_heading: EXT. COVE - LATER
text: Hiccup is using a mirror-like object to create a patch of
text: light on the ground. Toothless claws and chases the light
text: patch like a cat chasing a laser pointer.

speaker_heading: TUFFNUT
dialog: Ha. It's like the size of my--
text: Tuffnut is taken down in a blur.
speaker_heading: TUFFNUT (CONT'D)
dialog: Get it off! Get it off! Oh! I'm
dialog: hurt, I am very much hurt!
text: Hiccup stops the Terrible Terror with the same light-patch
text: trick he used earlier with Toothless. The tiny dragon
text: retreats back to it's cage. The teens approach him yet again
text: as Astrid looks on with suspicion.
speaker_heading: TUFFNUT (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO ASTRID)

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - MOMENTS LATER
text: Astrid furiously hurls her axe at a nearby tree. She notices
text: Hiccup walking by in the distance, carrying one of his

text: loses her in the woods.
text: She HUFFS, frustrated.
scene_heading: EXT. COVE - LATER
text: Hiccup straps a newly designed harness onto Toothless. With
text: Toothless tied to a nearby post with a rope. Hiccup rides him
text: in the air -- while stationary. Toothless looks like a giant
text: kite tied to a tree stump. This harness seems to work.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - MOMENTS LATER
text: The rope breaks and the pair CRASH into a tree. Hiccup's face
text: is red.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Oh, great.
scene_heading: EXT. BERK - NIGHT

speaker_heading: VIKING
dialog: Hiccup.
text: Hiccup nods, trying to look casual. Once the coast is clear,
text: he covertly steers Toothless into the Blacksmith's stall.
text: Toothless PRESSES himself inside, rooting through stuff and
text: making a racket. Astrid, walking nearby, is alerted.
speaker_heading: ASTRID (O.S.)
dialog: Hiccup?
text: Hiccup FREEZES. Then frantically tries to pry the ring off
text: the saddle hook. It won't budge.
speaker_heading: ASTRID (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you in there?
text: Too late - she's right outside.
text: ON ASTRID walking along the outside of the Blacksmith's.
text: Hiccup JUMPS OUT the window and CLOSES the shutters behind
text: him. Hiccup's harness line is stretched through the window,
text: still attached to Toothless' saddle.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Astrid. Hey! Hi Astrid. Hi Astrid.
dialog: Hi Astrid.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: I normally don't care what people
dialog: do, but you're acting weird. Well,
dialog: weirder.
text: Toothless spots a nearby sheep and makes a move toward it. As
text: a result, Hiccup is suddenly PULLED TIGHT against the window
text: shutters. He STRIKES A POSE to compensate... then gets PULLED
text: THROUGH the shutters. They snap back in Astrid's face.
text: Astrid reopens them and finds nothing but an empty stall.
text: In the distance, Toothless and Hiccup slip off unseen.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCKS - DAWN
text: A lone, battered ship is pulled into a slip, overloaded with
text: equally battered-looking men. They disembark to a crowd of

text: Gobber hobbles through the MUMBLING crowd to find Stoick --

speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Well, I trust you found the nest at

speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: Not even close.
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Ah. Excellent.
text: Gobber follows Stoick up the ramp and snags his duffle bag
text: with his hook appendage, sharing the burden.
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: I hope you had a little more
dialog: success than me.
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Well, if by success, you mean that

dialog: with, then... yes.
dialog: Stoick stops. What does that mean?
text: A group of merry villagers rush past.
speaker_heading: VIKING #1

speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: He's... gone?
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Yeah...most afternoons. But who can
dialog: blame him? I mean the life of a
dialog: celebrity is very rough. He can
text: barely walk through the village
text: without being swarmed by his new

text: Stoick is doubly confused.
speaker_heading: STOICK

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - AFTERNOON
text: Toothless and Hiccup soar through a perfect blue sky.
text: Billowing clouds rise like mountains. The ground seems miles
text: below them.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Okay there bud, we're gonna take
dialog: this nice and slow.
text: Hiccup checks a leather cheat sheet, clipped onto his
text: harness. Inscribed upon it are several tail positions and
dialog: their pedal position equivalents.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Here we go. Here we go...position
dialog: three, no four.
text: He presses the pedal, causing the tail to flare. They roll
text: off into an arcing bank, gloriously lit by the late afternoon
dialog: sun.
text: Hiccup tucks tight against his neck, thrilled that his new
text: harness and vest are holding. The foot controls make the tail
text: appendage quick and responsive. He watches Toothless' every
text: fluctuation, trying to match it with the prosthetic.
text: Hiccup sizes up a target -- a towering arch of stone, rising
text: from the sea.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 53.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, it's go time. It's go
dialog: time.
text: They dive toward it, lining up to pass through the arch.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on. Come on buddy. Come on
dialog: buddy!
text: They zip through the arch. A perfect maneuver.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah! Yes, it worked!
text: The triumph is short-lived. They smack into one of several
text: sea stacks as Hiccup tries to keep up with the turns.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry.
text: They hurtle into another rock pillar. Toothless grumbles.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: My fault.
text: Toothless swats him with his 'ear' plate.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.
dialog: (referring to the cheat
speaker_heading: SHEET)
dialog: Position four, no three.
text: They pierce the clouds. For the first time, Hiccup can see
text: the whole of the island below them. It shrinks with every
text: passing second. He SWALLOWS hard and tightens his grip on the
dialog: handles.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah! Go baby! Yes! Oh, this is
dialog: amazing! The wind in my...
text: He spots the leather guide tearing free in the turbulence.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (PANICKED)

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 54.
text: ... and NABS IT before it's carried out of reach. Toothless,
text: however, obeys the command and suddenly STOPS beating his
dialog: wings.
text: As they slow to a stop, Hiccup goes weightless. The rings of
text: his vest float off of the harness hooks. Hiccup suddenly
text: finds himself detached, free-falling.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh gods! Oh no!
text: Without Hiccup, the tail loses control. Hiccup and Toothless
text: spiral downward. Toothless FIGHTS to get back under Hiccup.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: (trying to calm Toothless)
dialog: Alright, okay. You just gotta kinda
dialog: angle yourself. No, no...come back
dialog: down towards me. Come back down--
text: Hiccup extends his arms and legs, giving himself as much
text: surface area as he can. He angles back towards Toothless as
text: the tumbling dragon WHACKS Hiccup with his wing.
text: After a few more misses, Hiccup finally GRABS HOLD of the
text: harness and manages to lock in -- just in time to pull
text: Toothless out of his dive... barely shy of the tree tops.
text: They careen past the wooded cliff and directly into a
text: treacherous slalom course of jutting sea stacks.
text: Hiccup pulls the cheat sheet from his teeth and attempts to
text: check positions. It flaps violently in the turbulence, making
dialog: it impossible.
text: With no time to think, Hiccup throws it away and steers
text: Toothless' tail on instinct... with perfect intuition.
text: Together, they manage a tight, hair-rasing series of split-
text: second turns, making it to the open water, unscathed.
text: Hiccup takes a breath and glances back at the death-defying
text: obstacle course, now safely behind them. He beams, relieved.
text: He sits back and throws his arms up in victory.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: YEEAHHH!
text: Toothless concurs with a happy SQUEAL and a fireball.

scene_heading: EXT. BLACK SAND BEACH - SUNSET
text: Hiccup and Toothless lounge on a sprawling, deserted beach,
text: snacking of freshly caught fish. As Hiccup cooks his over a
text: fire, Toothless suddenly regurgitates a fish head. Hiccup
text: smirks with forced politeness.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Uh..no thanks.
text: (gesturing to his fish on
speaker_heading: A STICK)
dialog: I'm good.
text: Several Terrible Terrors land like seagulls, hissing and
text: nipping at each other as they approach Toothless' pile of
dialog: fish.
text: One grabs the regurgitated fish head and drags it away.
text: Another attempts to steal it from him. They face off and last
text: fire balls at each other to settle the fight. Hiccup and
text: Toothless watch, amused. That is until...
text: Toothless spots one of his fish leaving the pile. A stealthy
text: Terrible Terror is exposed as the thief. They tug on the
text: fish, and it snaps back into Toothless' mouth. He swallows it
text: back tauntingly.
text: Irate, the little dragon paws at the ground and blast
text: Toothless. He opens his mouth, the gas hiss comes, and
text: Toothless fires a tiny flame straight into its mouth, causing
text: the gas to backfire into the little dragon. It coughs up
text: smoke and staggers away, looking ill.
text: Hiccup laughs.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
text: Not so fireproof on the inside, are
dialog: you?
text: Hiccup throws the hapless Terror his freshly cooked fish.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Here you go.
text: The appreciative little dragon gulps down the meal and

text: is amazed.

scene_heading: INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - HICCUP'S CLOSET - NIGHT
text: HICCUP is lost in thought, his head laid of a desk full of
text: Toothless drawings. Burdened with the weight of the world.
text: Suddenly, STOICK appears in the doorway. Hiccup jumps and
text: quickly covers up his desk.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Dad! You're back!
text: He skirts the bench, blocking Stoick's view of Toothless, the
text: prosthetic fin, and other drawings.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Gobber's not here, so...
text: He strikes an awkwardly casual pose, trying to cover up as

speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: I know. I came looking for you.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
speaker_heading: (CAUGHT)
dialog: You did?
speaker_heading: STOICK
speaker_heading: (STERN)

speaker_heading: HICCUP

speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: Just how long did you think you
dialog: could hide it from me?
speaker_heading: HICCUP
speaker_heading: (IN VAIN)

speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Oh gods. Dad I'm so sorry. I was

speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: You're not...upset?
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: What?! I was hoping for this!
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Uh...you were?
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: And believe me, it only gets

text: Hiccup's elated expression sinks.
speaker_heading: STOICK (CONT'D)
dialog: And mount your first Gronckle head
dialog: on a spear. What a feeling!

text: into the wall.
speaker_heading: STOICK (CONT'D)
dialog: You really had me going there, son.
dialog: All those years of the worst Viking
dialog: Berk has ever seen! Odin, it was

text: Hiccup gets back up, grimacing in the irony of it all.
speaker_heading: STOICK (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: STOICK (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: STOICK (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: HICCUP
speaker_heading: (SINCERE)

speaker_heading: STOICK (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: (SHOCKED)

speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: AAAAUUGGGHHH! Why would you do

speaker_heading: ASTRID

speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: No. It's okay! It's okay...
text: Toothless pulls up short and lands hard, SPRAYING Astrid with
dialog: sand.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (CALMING)
dialog: She's a friend.

speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO ASTRID)
dialog: You just scared him.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: I scared him!?

speaker_heading: ASTRID (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (INTENSE WHISPER)
dialog: Who is him?
speaker_heading: HICCUP.
dialog: Astrid, Toothless. Toothless,
dialog: Astrid.
text: Astrid backs away, eyeing Hiccup and Toothless together with

speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: We're dead.
text: Satisfied with Astrid's departure, Toothless turns away.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO TOOTHLESS)
dialog: Where do you think you're going?
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER
text: ASTRID races through the trees. A large shadow overtakes her.

dialog: 
scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 64.
text: Hiccup and Toothless fly Astrid to the top of a towering
text: pine. It bows and creaks under their weight as Astrid dangles
text: a hundred feet in the air.
speaker_heading: ASTRID (CONT'D)
dialog: Hiccup! Get me down from here!
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: You have to give me a chance to
dialog: explain.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: I'm not listening to ANYTHING you

speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Then I won't speak. Just let me
dialog: show you.
text: Hiccup extends a hand.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Please, Astrid.
text: She eyes him and the dragon, then the ground far, far below.
text: After a moment, she swats Hiccup's outstretched hand away and
text: reluctantly climbs over the pedal, lines, and harness. She
text: settles behind Hiccup, avoiding as much contact as possible.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: Now get me down.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
text: Toothless? Down. Gently.
text: Toothless leers mischievously. He spreads his wings slowly.
text: With a WHOP, they fill with the updraft. Toothless releases
text: the tree, tucks in his legs, and HOVERS in place.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: See? Nothing to be afraid of.
text: Toothless suddenly LAUNCHES straight upward. Astrid SCREAMS.
text: The acceleration is tremendous. Every downbeat bucks the
text: saddle, heaving them into the sky, doubling their speed like
text: a rocket. Astrid is thrown backward. She SCREAMS and hugs
text: Hiccup for dear life, squeezing the breath out of him.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Toothless! What is wrong with you?!

text: Toothless rockets over the ocean waves, deliberately dipping
text: them in the froth.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Toothless, what are you doing?!
dialog: We need her to like us!
text: Toothless rockets skyward and begins tumbling head over tail.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: And now the spinning. Thank you for
dialog: nothing you useless reptile.
text: Astrid clamps her hand over her eyes.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: Okay! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Just
dialog: get me off of this thing.
text: Astrid is defeated, her aggressive energy gone. Satisfied,
text: Toothless relents.
text: They level off and head up into the clouds. Astrid opens her
text: eyes again, and looks out over a world she'd never dreamed
text: of. She reaches out and touches clouds, pierces columns
text: ablaze in golden hues, and floats over a vast, alien sky-
text: scape. Her terror is replaced by wonder. She grins, despite
dialog: herself.
text: Toothless rises above a blanket of clouds...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - NIGHT
text: ...and levels off under a starry sky. They emerge from a
text: blanket of clouds under the dancing Northern Lights,
text: shimmering in ribbons across the vast sky.
text: Below them, Berk's torches flicker in the inky darkness. The
text: new perspective is breathtaking.
text: Astrid tucks her arms into Hiccup's vest, burying her chin
text: into his shoulder. The moment is not lost on either of them.
text: Hiccup smiles nervously.
text: Toothless climbs past Berk's tallest peaks and heads out over
text: open water, leaving the village lights behind them.

speaker_heading: (BEAT)

speaker_heading: ASTRID (CONT'D)
dialog: So what now?

speaker_heading: ASTRID (CONT'D)
dialog: Hiccup, your final exam is
dialog: tomorrow. You know you're going to
dialog: have to kill...
speaker_heading: (WHISPERED)
dialog: ... kill a dragon.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Don't remind me.
text: A strange, unearthly din approaches. Toothless' ear plates
text: suddenly stand on end. Panicked, he abruptly dives, dipping
text: into cloud cover.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Toothless! What's happening? What
dialog: is it?
text: Toothless BARKS at him. 'Quiet!'
text: Suddenly, out of the dense cloud, a Monstrous Nightmare
text: emerges.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Get down!
text: Hiccup and Astrid duck. The Nightmare calls out. A Zippleback
text: appears to the other side of Toothless, boxing him in.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Toothless. You've got to get us out

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 67.
text: Other dragons, previously invisible in the thick clouds,
text: appear all around them. HUNDREDS of them, all carrying fish
text: and game in their talons.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (WHISPERED)
text: It looks like they're hauling in
dialog: their kill.
text: The Zippleback eyes them ravenously.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: What does that make us?
text: The dragons BANK and dive in formation, plummeting through
text: the thickening fog and weaving between towering, craggy sea
dialog: stacks.
text: They emerge at the base of a massive volcanic caldera,
text: glowing with rivulets of lava. The flock of dragons fall into
text: rank, funneling through a crack, and zipping through a
text: winding tunnel.
text: It gives way to a vast, steamy inner chamber, tiered with
text: pocky shelves. Dragons of all breeds lay about, nested in
text: hordes.
text: The arriving dragons fly in, dropping the fish and game into
text: a central pit, glowing red and shrouded in mist.
text: Hiccup is amazed.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: What my dad wouldn't give to find
dialog: this.
text: Toothless peels away from the procession, landing on a small
text: shadowy shelf to keep a low-profile.
text: Hiccup and Astrid peek around, taking in the busy hive of
text: sorts. They watch as the food continues to be dropped into
dialog: the pit.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: It's satisfying to know that all of
dialog: our food has been dumped down a
dialog: hole.
speaker_heading: ASTRID

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 68.
text: Last to arrive is a dim-witted Gronckle. It hovers over the
text: pit and regurgitates his paltry contribution -- a pathetic
text: little fish. As it falls into the steamy pit, a terrible ROAR
text: rings out.
text: The Gronckle tries to flee, but before it can, a gargantuan
text: dragon head juts from the steamy pit and SNAPS it out of the
text: air. Swallowing it back whole.
text: Hiccup and Astrid recoil, terrified.
speaker_heading: ASTRID (CONT'D)
dialog: What is that?
text: The monstrous beast SNIFFS the air, seemingly aware of them.
text: It nears the ledge where Toothless is hiding... and ROARS.
text: Several dragons take flight in fear.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Alright buddy, we gotta get out of
dialog: here. Now!
text: Toothless takes flight, barely evading the monster's snapping
dialog: jaws.
text: The behemoth dragon lunges for them, snatching a Zippleback
text: out of the air instead.
text: Toothless disappears into the winged exodus as thousands of
text: dragons flee the caldera in fear.
scene_heading: EXT. HIDDEN COVE - NIGHT - LATER
text: Toothless glides into the cove and touches down on the
text: moonlit beach.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
text: (her mind reeling, talking
dialog: Hiccup's ear off)
dialog: No, no, it totally makes sense.
text: It's like a giant beehive. They're
dialog: the workers... and that's their
text: queen. It controls them.
text: She leaps off of Toothless and runs toward the village.
speaker_heading: ASTRID (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's find your dad.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: No, no! Not yet. They'll... kill
dialog: Toothless.

speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Astrid, we have to think this
dialog: through carefully.
text: Astrid eyes him, incredulous.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: Hiccup, we just discovered the
dialog: dragons' nest...the thing we've
dialog: been after since Vikings first
dialog: sailed here. And you want to keep
dialog: it a secret? To protect your pet
dialog: dragon? Are you serious?
text: Hiccup stands firm, resolute.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Yes.
text: Astrid's taken aback.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Then what do we do?
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Just give me until tomorrow. I'll
dialog: figure something out.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: Okay.
text: Astrid PUNCHES Hiccup in the arm.
speaker_heading: ASTRID (CONT'D)
dialog: That's for kidnapping me.
text: Hiccup looks to Toothless for support. Toothless SNORTS,
text: dismissive.
text: Astrid grabs him. He braces for another hit. She KISSES
text: Hiccup on the cheek.
speaker_heading: ASTRID (CONT'D)
dialog: That's for, everything else.
text: In the awkward wake of the moment, Astrid hurries off...
text: leaving Hiccup RUBBING his cheek, stunned.

dialog: Well, I can show my face in public

speaker_heading: (PLAYFUL)
dialog: If someone had told me that in a

dialog: placing first in dragon training...
dialog: I would've tied him to a mast and
dialog: shipped him off for fear he'd gone
dialog: mad. Yes! And you know it!
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: But here we are. And no one's more
dialog: surprised...
text: ON HICCUP standing at the entrance to the ring, listening,

speaker_heading: STOICK (CONT'D)
dialog: ... or more proud than I am. Today,

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Astrid. If something goes wrong...
dialog: just make sure they don't find

speaker_heading: ASTRID
speaker_heading: (GRIM)
dialog: I will. Just promise me it won't go

speaker_heading: ON THE TEENS
text: HOOTING and HOLLERING from the stands.
speaker_heading: TUFFNUT
dialog: Show 'em how it's done, my man!
text: Hiccup locks eyes with Stoick. Stoick nods with a smile.
text: Hiccup returns a half-smile. Takes a deep breath.
text: He hoists a shield onto his forearm and selects his weapon
text: from a rack of many -- a small dagger.
speaker_heading: STOICK
speaker_heading: (MUTTERED)
dialog: Hrmph. I would've gone for the
dialog: hammer.
text: Hiccup turns to face a bolted, heavy door. Takes a deep
dialog: breath.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: I'm ready.
text: The door bolt is raised. The crowd grows quiet...
dialog: Beat.
text: BOOM! The doors blast open with a stream of sticky fire.
text: Followed by a Monstrous Nightmare, coated in flames. It tears
text: out of its cave like an irate bull -- as the crowd roars and
text: jeers.
text: It climbs the walls and chain enclosure like a bat, hissing
text: at the provoking crowd and blasting fire.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 72.
text: It spots Hiccup and descends, leering and licking the flaming
text: drool from its lips.
text: The crowd grows silent, bracing for the big fight.
text: With the Monstrous Nightmare's eyes locked upon him, Hiccup
text: deliberately drops his shield and dagger stepping away from
text: them. The dragon pauses, confused.
text: ON STOICK, also confused.
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: What is he doing?
text: The dragon presses closer, snorting. Hiccup extends his open
text: hand. It snarls.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
speaker_heading: (WHISPERED)
dialog: It's okay. It's okay.
text: The dragon continues to pace, focused on... HICCUP'S HELMET.
text: Hiccup realizes, then reaches up and removes it. Taking a
text: breath to acknowledge the point of no return, he tosses the
text: helmet aside. It hits the ground.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm not one of them.
text: GASPS and MURMURS race through the crowd.
text: ON STOICK, as all eyes turn to him. He's welling with upset.
text: Hiccup avoids Stoick's glare and remains focused on the
text: Nightmare, holding his hand out. It paces around him, calming
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: Stop the fight.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: No. I need you all to see this.
text: The crowd gets restless.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)

text: Stoick whacks his hammer against the iron enclosure, rattling

text: Spooked, the Nightmare snaps at Hiccup's outstretched hand.
text: Hiccup YELPS and springs backward.
text: The spell is broken. The Nightmare reacts to Hiccup's sudden
text: movements and blasts another stream of fire. Hiccup SCREAMS
text: and barely dives out of reach.
scene_heading: EXT. COVE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: ON TOOTHLESS

dialog: Out of my way!
speaker_heading: ASTRID

scene_heading: EXT. COVE - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS
text: A narrow stream of fire narrowly avoids Hiccup as he

speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: Hiccup!
text: She picks up a hammer and hurls it at the Monstrous

speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: This way!
text: Astrid makes it through, but the Nightmare BLASTS the

speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Night Fury! Get down!
text: Toothless bounds over the crowd and BLASTS a hole through the

text: The Vikings rush to railings... in time to see a flurry of
text: wings cutting through the dissipating smoke. Toothless and
text: the Nightmare tumble into the clear, locked in a toothy,

text: The Nightmare snarls, circling them. Toothless lunges and

text: To everyone's shock and horror, Hiccup gets to his feet and

speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: Stoick no!
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Dad! No! He won't hurt you!

speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: No, don't! You're only making it
dialog: worse!
text: Stoick raises his hammer as he charges for Toothless.
text: Toothless ducks and pounces on him. They tumble end over end.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Toothless! STOP!
text: He pins Stoick and inhales. The familiar hiss of gas builds.

speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: I should have known. I should have

speaker_heading: HICCUP

speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: Set sail! We head for Helheim's

text: He then notices HICCUP watching from his familiar cliff-side

text: ON STOICK at the bow of his ship. He taps his fingers on the

speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Ah. I was wondering where that

text: A clicking buzz becomes audible, growing louder. It fills the

dialog: air.
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: Stay low and ready your weapons.
text: Stoick's ship suddenly JERKS to a halt as the keel burrows

text: Astrid stops him.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
speaker_heading: (CORRECTING)
dialog: Uh-uh.

speaker_heading: SNOTLOUT
dialog: Where are you going?!

speaker_heading: STOICK (CONT'D)
dialog: (War cries and slashing efforts)

text: The battle-ready Vikings drop their weapons, confused.
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Is that it?

speaker_heading: VIKINGS

speaker_heading: SPITELOUT

dialog: Beard of Thor...what is that?

speaker_heading: (AGHAST)

text: The Vikings scramble in all directions.
speaker_heading: VIKING #3
dialog: Get to the ships!
speaker_heading: STOICK

text: Gobber drops in beside Stoick, like two soldiers in a trench.

speaker_heading: STOICK

speaker_heading: GOBBER

speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Then I can double that time.
text: Stoick grins. Friends to the bitter end. They BREAK COVER and

speaker_heading: STOICK
speaker_heading: HERE!
speaker_heading: GOBBER

speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Ruff, Tuff, watch your backs! Move

speaker_heading: FISHLEGS
dialog: Yeah! It's working.

text: The Red Death thrashes, knocking Snotlout off of his dragon

speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: Yeah! You're the Viking!

speaker_heading: SNOTLOUT
dialog: Whoa!
text: ON THE GROUND
text: The monster's tail sweeps across the burning ships, snapping

speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
text: Hiccup swims toward Toothless. They're both caught in a mess

text: Snotlout sees the Zippleback diving toward him and DASHES

text: As the twins sweep past, both missing him... but perfectly
text: snatching him where the necks merge. Ruff and Tuff eye each

speaker_heading: TUFFNUT
dialog: I can't believe that worked.
text: The Red Death spots Astrid and INHALES, preparing to blast.
text: She and her Nadder get caught in the suction, pulled toward

text: ON THE GROUND
text: The Vikings watch with dread. They hear the familiar whir of
dialog: the...
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Night Fury! Get down!
speaker_heading: IN THE AIR
text: A massive BLAST jolts the Red Death's head sideways. Astrid
text: is thrown clear of its mouth... AND her Nadder. She tumbles
text: through the air. The ground races toward her, when...
text: She's suddenly CAUGHT by the leg. She looks up to see
dialog: Toothless.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Did you get her?
text: Toothless grunts.
text: ON THE GROUND
text: They fly over the crowd of Vikings and set Astrid down, mid-

speaker_heading: HICCUP
speaker_heading: (TO TOOTHLESS)
dialog: That thing has wings! Okay, let's
dialog: see if it can use them!
text: Hiccup pulls Toothless into a turn. They plummet, gaining
text: tremendous speed. The wind buffets them as they target the
dialog: Red Death as super sonic speed.
text: KABLAM! Toothless unloads a fireball against the Red Death's
text: head. It goes down with a rumble as they climb anew.
text: ON THE GROUND
text: The Vikings shield themselves from the dust of the fallen

speaker_heading: IN THE AIR
text: Hiccup looks back as they put distance between them.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you think that did it?
text: Suddenly, the enraged behemoth RISES into frame... flapping

speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, he can fly.
text: Hiccup and Toothless DIVE into the tangled sea stacks - they
text: weave through the rock like rabbits through a briar. The Red
text: Death SNAPS at them, but cannot reach them. Hiccup and
text: Toothless PULL AHEAD.
text: The Red Death SMASHES through the canopy of rock and pulls in
text: behind Toothless. He BURSTS THROUGH fifty-foot formations
text: like they were saplings.
text: ON THE GROUND
text: Stoick, Gobber, and the Teens watch as Hiccup and Toothless
text: streak past, weaving through sea stacks.
speaker_heading: TEENS

text: Hiccup and Toothless can't slow the monster down. Hiccup eyes
text: the clouds above. An idea hits him. He locks eyes with
dialog: Toothless.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Okay Toothless, time to disappear.
text: Toothless PULLS into a steep climb, heading toward the

speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on bud!
text: The Red Death follows, closing in fast.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: (hearing the gas)
dialog: Here it comes!
text: BLAST! They narrowly dodge a column of flame and smoke. They
text: reach the low-hanging clouds and pierce them. The monster
text: follows, immediately losing them in the hampered visibility.
text: It roars irritably.
text: From out of nowhere, Toothless DIVES at the huge dragon,
text: BLASTING and PUNCTURING a hole in its wing. Toothless and
text: Hiccup are gone again before the dragon can get a shot at
dialog: them.
text: ON THE GROUND
text: The Vikings stare up at the sky listening to the resounding

speaker_heading: IN THE AIR
text: HICCUP and TOOTHLESS dive in again and again, using the

dialog: wings.
text: It BELLOWS in frustration and WHIRLS around, unleashing fire

text: Hiccup sees the glow of fire cutting towards them.

dialog: Watch out!

speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, time's up. Let's see if this
dialog: works.
text: He pulls Toothless into a turn. They fly directly into the
text: Red Death's face, taunting it.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on! Is that the best you can
dialog: do!?
text: Toothless utters an insult too, and they jackknife into a
text: steep dive. The Red Death pursues.
text: Toothless PUMPS his wings, racing faster than he's ever gone
text: before. Hiccup and Toothless stay just ahead of the Red Death
text: -- no longer trying to evade it.
text: Hiccup glances back to check the tail - it's disintegrating.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Stay with me buddy. We're good.
dialog: Just a little bit longer.
text: The Red Death closes the gap. Hiccup tucks in and holds
text: Toothless steady -- allowing the monster to set its sights on
text: them. It narrows its eyes.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold, Toothless.
text: The Red Death OPENS his mouth. The familiar gas HISS emanates
text: from his throat -- ignition is coming.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: NOW!
text: Hiccup HITS the PEDALS HARD as Toothless extends one wing.
text: They PIVOT in place, hurtling directly into the Red Death's
dialog: mouth.
text: Toothless FIRES point blank down the monster's throat. Its
text: amassing gas is ignited, BACKFIRING into the monster,
text: erupting in a chain of blasts throughout its body.
text: Hiccup and Toothless BURST from the clouds, the Red Death hot
text: on their tail, exploding from within. It glances forward and
text: sees the ground rushing up. It throws open its wings,
text: attempting to put on the brakes, but the punctured, damaged
text: wings can't stop its momentum.
text: As the Red Death chokes on the expanding fireball, he sees
text: Toothless suddenly pull out of the dive, streaking up, past

scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 99.
text: The Red Death HITS the ground, head-first. It EXPLODES like
dialog: the Hindenburg.
text: Hiccup and Toothless weave through the monster's massive back
text: plates, wings, and flailing legs -- a high-speed recall of
text: the FREE FALL slalom run. The expanding fireball races toward
text: them, about to swallow them.
text: They manage to clear the obstacles. Hiccup glances back.
text: They're outrunning the fireball.
text: He looks forward just in time to see the monster's massive
text: club tail careening toward them.
text: He tries to shift their direction. The last shreds of
text: Toothless' tail tear away. Hiccup's pedals go DEAD.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: No. No.
text: Hiccup and Toothless can't maneuver - they're dead in the
text: air. The giant club tail CLIPS Toothless, TEARING Hiccup from
text: the harness and sending him tumbling against the backdrop of
text: the fast-approaching fireball.
text: Toothless STRUGGLES with all his might to reach the
text: unconscious Hiccup. But the fireball swallows them both.
text: ON THE GROUND
text: The Vikings watch in horror as Hiccup and Toothless disappear
text: into the boiling inferno.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: Hiccup? Hiccup!?

text: He hurries to the dragon's side. Toothless is roughed up, but
text: conscious. His scorched saddle, however, is vacant.
text: Stoick looks to the sky in despair. He buckles at the knees,
text: overwhelmed by the loss.
speaker_heading: STOICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh son...I did this...
text: Astrid pushes through the crowd, her eyes welling up.
text: Followed by Gobber. They flank Stoick as he kneels, slumped
dialog: over.
text: Behind them, a ring of Vikings form, keeping a respectful
text: distance. As the dust and smoke clear, a ring of wild
text: dragons can also be seen, gathering just behind and between
dialog: the Vikings.
text: Toothless stirs and groggily rolls his head toward Stoick.
text: Their eyes meet.
speaker_heading: STOICK (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm so sorry...
text: Toothless unfolds his wings, revealing Hiccup, unconscious,

speaker_heading: STOICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Hiccup.
text: He scoops Hiccup into his arms. Listens to his heart. Bursts
text: into relieved laughter.
speaker_heading: STOICK (CONT'D)
dialog: He's alive!
speaker_heading: (TO TOOTHLESS)
dialog: You brought him back alive!
text: The crowd roars. Followed by the dragons. The Vikings look

speaker_heading: (PRIVATELY)
dialog: Thank you... for saving my son.

speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
text: HICCUP, asleep, his head on a pillow. Healing scars on his

speaker_heading: HICCUP
speaker_heading: (GROGGY)
dialog: Oh, hey Toothless.
text: Toothless excitedly nuzzles and nudges Hiccup.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, okay! I'm happy to see you
dialog: too, bud. Now just--
text: Toothless steps on his groin, causing Hiccup to sit BOLT
text: UPRIGHT with a YELP.
text: He looks around, confounded. He's in his bed, moved beside
text: the fire pit on the main floor of his house.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm in my house.
dialog: (re: Toothless, leaning
text: over him, excited)
dialog: You're in my house.
text: Toothless TEARS around the room, knocking things over, far
dialog: too big for the space.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Uh...does my dad know you're in
dialog: here?!
text: Toothless pauses at the foot of the bed, tongue wagging. He

dialog: 'happy dog' energy.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (DISTRESSED)
dialog: Okay, okay -- no Toothless! Aw,
dialog: come on...
text: Hiccup shifts to get out of bed... then pauses... sensing

scene_heading: ON THE BARE FLOOR
text: His booted foot touches down. Followed by a mechanical
text: prosthetic in place of his second leg. It's an ingenious
text: spring-loaded replacement, made of wood and iron.
text: Toothless lands by the bed and approaches calmly, sniffing
text: the new leg. He raises his eyes to meet Hiccup's, seemingly
text: aware of what Hiccup is going through.
text: Hiccup braces himself on the bedpost and tries to stand on
text: it. He winces and stifles the pain...
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay...okay...
text: ... but STUMBLES with the first step. Toothless catches
text: Hiccup's fall with his head... and slowly lifts him up,
text: stabilizing him.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks bud.
text: Hiccup leans on him like a crutch. They take a few steps
dialog: together.
text: Their missing parts form a poetic silhouette as they make
text: their way toward the door.
text: Hiccup pries it open (as he did in the opening scene),
text: revealing a MONSTROUS NIGHTMARE flapping outside the door.
text: Hiccup YELPS and slams the door closed. He turns to
text: Toothless, alarmed.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Toothless? Stay here, bud.
text: Hiccup pauses... and cracks the door open again. He peeks
text: outside, his eyes widening. He allows to door to swing open,
dialog: revealing...
text: ... the Monstrous Nightmare, carrying Snotlout on its back.
speaker_heading: SNOTLOUT
dialog: Come on guys, get ready! Hold on
dialog: tight! Here we go!
text: A class of newbie dragon riders follow him through frame on a

scene_heading: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 103.
text: Vikings and dragons mill about by the dozen, basking on the
text: rooftops, weaving along the plaza. No one seems upset, there
text: isn't a sword in sight.
text: Under the framework of a MASSIVE BARN, a Nadder BLASTS fire
text: onto a metal brace. It steps back to let a Viking hammer it
text: into shape. Nearby, a Gronkle lands, carrying a tree trunk in
text: his mouth. He shows a Viking what he's found. The Viking pats
text: his head. Another Viking backs a Zippleback into a stall to
dialog: check it for size.
text: Hiccup takes a step outside, finding Stoick waiting for him
text: on the step.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: I knew it. I'm dead.

dialog: Think it'll do?
speaker_heading: HICCUP

dialog: That's for scaring me.
