scene_heading: OPENING CREDITS:
dialog: 
text: A SPOTLIGHT slices black space.
dialog: 
text: In its beam, a DANCER materializes. She is fair-skinned.
dialog: Beautiful and pure.
dialog: 
text: The maiden twirls on pointe, a smile on her face, light as
text: air and carefree.
dialog: 
text: She pauses, her face grows worried. Sensing someone watching.
dialog: 
text: Scared, she peers into the darkness.
dialog: 
text: She moves now, looking, growing more frantic.
dialog: 
text: Then, a SINISTER MAN emerges out of the darkness behind her.
text: She stumbles backwards, frightened.
dialog: 
text: She tries to escape, twirling away, but he pursues. His true
text: form is revealed, the demon ROTHBART.
dialog: 
text: He flings his open hand towards her, casting the spell.
dialog: 
text: She wants to scream, but nothing comes out. She looks at her
text: body, sensing something happening to her. Something
dialog: terrifying.
dialog: 
text: She spins, panicking, but it's too late. She disappears
text: beneath the beast's cape.
dialog: 
text: She emerges as the WHITE SWAN, the iconic protagonist of SWAN
dialog: LAKE.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO BLACK.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 2 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 2
dialog: 
text: In the darkness, a pair of EYES. They belong to NINA, the
text: same dancer. She lies awake in bed, thinking about her dream.
dialog: 
text: The room looks like it hasn't been redecorated since she was
text: a teenager. Stuffed animals. Dolls. Pink and frilly.
dialog: 
text: The door opens, throwing LIGHT on her face. Nina looks
text: towards the door and smiles softly at whoever opened it.
dialog: 
text: Nina sits up and hangs her BARE FEET off the side of the bed.
text: Like all ballerinas, she's beautiful and her feet are
text: atrocious. Covered in corns, broken blisters and bunions. She
text: arches them, doing her first extensions of the day.
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 3 INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING 3
dialog: 
text: The room is empty of furniture to leave space for dancing. A
text: large mirror covers the opposite wall entirely.
dialog: 
text: Nina rubs her knees to get them warm, and then begins her
text: morning exercises, extending and contracting her feet and
text: legs in precise and rhythmic motions.
dialog: 
text: The skin on her chest stretches tautly over her sternum.
text: Defined vertebrae run up her back, sinewy muscles contract as
text: she moves. Her slender neck leads into her hair, contained
text: in a ballerina's bun.
dialog: 
text: Nina looks serene as she moves, completely in her element.
dialog: 
text: She hears someone fussing about in the kitchen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
speaker_heading: (WHILE STRETCHING)
dialog: I had the most amazing dream last
dialog: night. I was dancing the White
dialog: Swan.
dialog: 
dialog: No answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA (CONT'D)
dialog: Different choreography, like the
dialog: Bolshoi's. It was the prologue,
text: when Rothbart casts his spell.
dialog: 
text: Still no answer.
dialog: 
text: Nina continues to stretch.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 4
dialog: 
text: Nina sits at the table. An older woman, ERICA, places a
text: POACHED EGG and a QUARTER-GRAPEFRUIT in front of her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: You're in a good mood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I'm just excited to get back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Off-season always makes you grumpy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
speaker_heading: (RE: GRAPEFRUIT)
dialog: Look how pink. So pretty.
dialog: 2A.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA NINA
dialog: (inside joke) (inside joke)
dialog: Pretty. Pretty.
dialog: 
text: They giggle and Erica resumes packing Nina's shoulder bag
text: with extra clothing, shoes, snack filled tupperware, duct
dialog: tape, ribbon, thread, etc.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA (CONT'D)
dialog: Plus he promised to feature me
dialog: more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: He certainly should. You're the
dialog: most dedicated dancer in the
dialog: company.
dialog: 
text: Nina smiles, comforted, and begins taking her vitamins.
dialog: 
text: Erica walks over with a SWEATSHIRT and holds it above her.
text: Nina pulls it over her head and starts to push her arms
text: through the sleeves.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA (CONT'D)
scene_heading: (NOTICING SOMETHING)
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: There.
dialog: 
text: Erica points to her shoulder. Nina feels and finds a small
scene_heading: SCRATCH MARK.
dialog: 
text: She shrugs and shakes her head.
dialog: 
text: Erica gives her a suspicious look, but lets it go and smiles.
text: Nina finishes pulling down the sweatshirt.
dialog: 
text: Erica hugs Nina into her chest and kisses the top of her
dialog: head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA (CONT'D)
dialog: Sweet girl.
dialog: 
text: Erica releases her and Nina begins eating.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 5 INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY 5
dialog: 
text: Nina rides inside a crowded subway, staring absentmindedly at
text: her faint reflection in the train's window.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, another train roars by on the opposite track,
text: snapping her awake.
dialog: 
text: In the next train car, she sees the back of a BALLERINA
text: standing in the midst of the crowd. Her head bops to music
text: playing through iPod earphones.
dialog: 
text: Nina moves a strand of hair out of her eyes, and at that
text: exact moment, the girl in the next car moves in the same way.
text: Mirroring her.
dialog: 
text: Unnerved, Nina slowly lowers her arm. So does the other girl.
text: Although Nina can't quite see her face, the girl seems
text: IDENTICAL from Nina's vantage point.
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
text: The train jerks to a stop as it arrives at a station. Nina
text: sees the girl head to the exit. She cranes to see her face,
text: but her view's obscured.
dialog: 
text: The doors slide shut and the train pulls out. Nina watches
text: the platform whisk by, keeping her eyes peeled, but she
text: doesn't see the girl.
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 7 EXT. LINCOLN CENTER - DAY 7
dialog: 
text: Nina emerges from the subway station onto a city street.
dialog: 
text: She arrives at the MAJESTIC-LOOKING THEATER, where a few
text: other BALLERINAS likewise trickle towards the entrance. They
text: all look strangely similar: slender, carrying shoulder bags,
text: wearing leggings and loose sweatshirts.
dialog: 
text: She passes a ROW OF POSTERS featuring the company's prima
text: ballerina, BETH MACINTYRE.
dialog: 
text: Nina looks at them, a little envious, before continuing on to
text: the STAGE DOOR.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 8 INT. SOLOIST DRESSING ROOM - DAY 8
dialog: 
text: Crammed into a single dressing room, Nina and the company's 5
text: SOLOISTS get ready for rehearsal. Chatting, sewing ribbon
text: onto shoes, applying makeup, putting band-aids on blisters.
dialog: 
text: Nina removes a new pair of BALLET SHOES, admires them for a
text: moment, before cutting off the satin toe with scissors.
dialog: 
text: In the background, catty VERONICA and Russian GALINA gossip.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERONICA
text: Can't believe she's back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALINA
dialog: Of course she is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: She can't take a hint? Company's
text: broke. No one comes to see her
dialog: anymore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLOIST 1
dialog: No one comes to see ballet period.
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: That's not true, I heard the Royal
dialog: had one of their best seasons yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALINA
dialog: He needs to try something new.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No, someone new.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLOIST 1
dialog: Like who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Like someone who's not approaching
dialog: menopause.
dialog: 
text: They snicker.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I think it's sad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: What's sad?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Beth's such an amazing dancer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALINA
dialog: So's my grand-mother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Fonteyn danced into her 50's...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERONICA
speaker_heading: (ROLLING EYES)
dialog: Yeah, we know.
dialog: 
text: Irked, Nina starts POUNDING the shoes against the floor to
dialog: soften the toe.
dialog: 
text: Her eyes are drawn to a NEW GIRL standing in the doorway.
text: Nina pauses to scrutinize her. She wears vampy make-up, hair
text: down. Dark and sexy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEW GIRL
dialog: Soloists?
dialog: 
text: Wary, the girls mumble mmm-hmm's and nod.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEW GIRL (CONT'D)
dialog: Great.
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
text: She slinks past the suspicious group of girls and plops down
text: at an open spot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEW GIRL (CONT'D)
dialog: Fucking got off the wrong stop and
dialog: had to hoof it from 79th.
dialog: 
text: Nina exchanges glances with the other girls, taken aback.
dialog: 
text: The new girl notices the looks, smirks to herself and starts
text: getting ready.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 9 INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 9
dialog: 
text: Nina wears a look of intense concentration as the entire
text: company warms up, including the pubescent CORPS MEMBERS and a
text: handful of MALE DANCERS.
dialog: 
text: LEGS, HANDS, and FEET repeat the same movements all around
text: her, led by a severe BALLET MISTRESS.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BALLET MISTRESS
dialog: To the back, fondu, to the back,
dialog: plie. Fourth, fourth, and one and
dialog: fifth, to the back...
dialog: (to a corps member)
dialog: Like this. Push it. Why can't you
dialog: do this?
dialog: 
text: Using the mirror, Nina monitors her movements carefully. The
text: mistress surprises her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BALLET MISTRESS (CONT'D)
dialog: It needs to be looser. Relax. Let
dialog: it flow.
dialog: 
text: Flustered, Nina nods and tries to follow her instruction.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, the girls around Nina begin stripping off their
text: sweatshirts and insulated pants.
dialog: 
text: Nina sees that the intense and brooding director of the
text: company, THOMAS LEROY, has entered the space. He has the
text: unkept look of an artist. Magnetic and intense.
dialog: 
text: The ballerinas remove their warm-up gear to show off their
dialog: bodies.
dialog: 
text: Leroy walks around the room, judging his flock. Smiles and
text: glances are thrown his way.
dialog: 
text: He goes up to the ballet mistress, takes her hand and kisses
text: her on the cheek. Even she manages a smile.
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
text: He heads to the line of soloists, studying them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: We all know the story: virginal
text: girl, pure and sweet, trapped in
text: the body of a swan. She desires
dialog: freedom, but only true love can
dialog: break the spell.
dialog: 
text: He taps a dancer on the shoulder, she lights up. He walks,
text: then taps another. A selection process of some kind.
dialog: 
text: Nina looks nervous, has an inkling of what it means.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
text: Her wish is granted in the form of
dialog: a prince.
dialog: 
text: He nears Nina. She sneaks peeks at him, eager and hopeful.
text: He acknowledges her with a small nod and a smile.
dialog: 
text: But he walks on without tapping her. She deflates.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
text: But before he can declare his love,
dialog: her lustful twin, the Black Swan,
text: tricks and seduces him.
dialog: 
text: He approaches the New Girl. Nina watches, threatened.
dialog: 
text: But he doesn't tap her either.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
text: Devastated, the White Swan leaps
text: off a cliff, killing herself. But,
text: in death, finds freedom.
dialog: 
text: He taps one more soloist and then CLAPS.
dialog: 
text: The music stops and all the girls face him, attentive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: Good morning, company.
dialog: 
text: They respond "Good morning" in nervous, unsure voices.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: We open our season with Swan Lake.
dialog: Done to death, I know. But not like
dialog: this. We strip it down. Make it
text: visceral and real.
dialog: 
text: He pauses for effect.
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: And a new production needs a new
text: Swan Queen. A fresh face to present
dialog: to the world.
dialog: 
text: Surprised, the soloists glance at each other, trying to keep
dialog: their cool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: But which of you can embody both
dialog: swans? The white and the black?
dialog: 
text: Nina prepares for disappointment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: All the soloists I touched...
dialog: Please go to your scheduled
dialog: rehearsals this afternoon.
dialog: 
text: The girls are confused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: And the girls I didn't touch, meet
dialog: me in studio B at five.
dialog: 
text: Nina breathes, realizing the girls he didn't tap are the ones
text: he's selected, purposefully toying with them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 10 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY 10
dialog: 
text: Hidden inside a nook, Nina has her eyes closed, nervously
text: HUMMING the score to Swan Lake.
dialog: 
text: She makes small motions with her feet and hands, going
text: through the choreography in her mind. Preparing for the
dialog: audition.
dialog: 
text: A loud CRASHING sound snaps her out of it.
dialog: 
text: She goes out into the hallway to investigate.
dialog: 
text: The door to a PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM is halfway open. Nina
text: cautiously approaches.
dialog: 
text: Inside, she can see someone moving around the room in a fury,
text: trashing it.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, the door swings open and BETH MACINTYRE bursts out.
dialog: 
text: She makes brief eye-contact with Nina.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What?!
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
text: Nina just shakes her head.
dialog: 
text: Beth scoffs as she slams the door behind her. She clips down
text: the hall in the opposite direction.
dialog: 
text: Nina waits until she's gone, then moves closer to the door
text: and peeks inside, curious.
dialog: 
text: She checks to make sure no one's around and quickly enters.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 11 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - SAME 11
dialog: 
text: Large and comfortable. Beth's presence is everywhere.
text: Photographs, clothing, and personal belongings scattered
text: across the space.
dialog: 
text: Nina looks at herself in the mirror and smiles, imagining how
dialog: great it would be...
dialog: 
text: Then she notices a LARGE VASE lying on the floor. The flowers
text: have been shredded, water everywhere.
dialog: 
text: She moves to the vanity counter and touches Beth's
text: belongings in reverence. The items are neatly laid out:
dialog: ballet supplies, jewelry, and makeup.
dialog: 
text: Her fingers brush a tube of LIPSTICK. She picks it up.
dialog: 
text: Nina slips the lipstick into her bag and exits the room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12 INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 12
dialog: 
text: In the middle of her audition, Nina dances Odette's Variation
text: from Act II of the ballet, a frightened look on her face.
dialog: 
text: Although her movement is incredibly precise, there's a
dialog: definite vulnerability. Exactly as the White Swan should be:
text: fear tinged with melancholy.
dialog: 
text: Leroy waves his arm. The music and Nina stop abruptly.
dialog: 
text: He approaches her and, when he gets close, taps on her
text: sternum with two of his fingers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: So Nina, would you like to be the
dialog: Swan Queen?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: If you want me to be.
dialog: 
text: He leans in and talks softly so the other girls can't hear.
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Well, if I was just casting the
dialog: White Swan, she'd be yours.
dialog: 
text: She can't help but smile, flattered. He pulls away from her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: But I'm not.
dialog: 
text: He turns to the PIANO PLAYER.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: Maestro, Odile's Coda.
dialog: 
text: The piano player rifles through the song book.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: Show me your Black Swan, Nina.
dialog: 
text: Nervous, she glances over at Veronica and Galina, who
text: anxiously await their turn.
dialog: 
text: She takes a few breaths, then looks towards the piano player
text: and nods.
dialog: 
text: The music begins.
dialog: 
text: Nina dances a few steps, and then launches into the most
dialog: difficult and famous part of Swan Lake: The Black Swan's
text: Coda. It consists of 32 consecutive fouettes (spins).
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, not so controlled.
dialog: 
text: The music builds in intensity, she pushes herself into the
dialog: next turn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: Seduce us! Not just the Prince, but
dialog: the court, the audience, the entire
dialog: world! The fouettes are like a
dialog: spider spinning her web. Come on!
dialog: Attack it! Attack it!
dialog: 
text: Leroy runs his hand through his hair, dismayed.
dialog: 
text: A look of worry spreads across Nina's face. Knows she's
dialog: blowing it.
dialog: 
text: The door CLANGS open and throws Nina's focus completely. She
text: stumbles, several spins short of finishing.
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
text: The New Girl obliviously marches into the room, listening to
text: an iPod.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (SARCASTIC)
dialog: Good of you to join us.
dialog: 
text: The New Girl notices everyone staring and pulls out her
text: earphones to talk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEW GIRL
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Girls, this is Lily. Straight off
dialog: the plane from San Francisco. She's
text: filling Rebecca's old spot.
dialog: 
text: LILY gives a small wave. Nina eyes her with scorn as she
text: catches her breath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: Go on, get warmed up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I'm good.
dialog: 
text: Lily starts stripping off her layers, revealing her lithe
text: body. On her back, she has a TATTOO OF LILIES.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Should I go again?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: (distracted by Lily)
dialog: I've seen enough. Thank you, Nina.
dialog: 
text: She looks down, getting his meaning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, Veronica. Your turn. The
dialog: White Swan's variation...
dialog: 
text: Furious, Nina marches out of the room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: A13 INT. THEATER BATHROOM STALL - NIGHT A13
dialog: 
text: Nina stands up from a kneeled position and flushes the
text: toilet. She wipes her mouth with the back of her hand and
text: exits the stall.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 15 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 15
dialog: 
text: Nina walks along a quiet side street. She clutches her
dialog: jacket, for warmth and comfort.
dialog: 
text: Her CELL PHONE starts ringing. She digs it out of her bag and
text: checks the CALLER ID: MOM. She silences it and puts it away.
dialog: 
text: Up ahead, she sees the sidewalk dead end at a construction
text: site, and detour into an enclosed PASSAGEWAY beneath the
text: scaffolding.
dialog: 
text: Nina slows, a little scared, but decides to push on.
dialog: 
text: The passageway is dark. The temporary lighting dim and
dialog: flickering.
dialog: 
text: She walks quickly, trying to get to the other side.
dialog: 
text: She hears the sound of soft FOOTSTEPS approaching. She
text: stops, and the other FOOTSTEPS stop.
dialog: 
text: She looks up and sees the faint outline of a SLENDER WOMAN
text: standing there, almost ghostlike.
dialog: 
text: Nina starts walking again, keeping her head down, and the
text: other woman continues as well.
dialog: 13.
dialog: 
text: As they pass each other, Nina glances at the woman's face and
dialog: discovers...
dialog: 
text: The woman looks EXACTLY LIKE HER.
dialog: 
text: But the moment passes as the woman continues walking.
dialog: 
text: Nina stares after her, perturbed.
dialog: 
text: Her cell phone starts RINGING again, piercing the silence.
text: Nina continues out, ignoring the phone.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 16 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 16
dialog: 
text: Nina enters and locks the deadbolt and chain-lock behind her.
dialog: 
text: She turns and is startled to see Erica standing right there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: How did it go?
dialog: 
text: Nina looks at her confused. Erica helps take off her coat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA (CONT'D)
dialog: You were late, so I called Susie in
dialog: the office. An audition?! Can't
dialog: believe he just sprung that on you.
dialog: 
text: Nina nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA (CONT'D)
dialog: So?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: It went okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Just okay?
dialog: 
text: Erica hangs up her coat, turns and sees Nina tearing up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA (CONT'D)
dialog: Darling?
dialog: 
text: The tears start falling now.
dialog: 
text: Erica goes to her and wraps her in an embrace.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA (CONT'D)
dialog: Shhh, shhh, tell me what happened.
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 17 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 17
dialog: 
text: Nina lies on the floor, stewing. Her legs straight in the air
text: to drain the lactic acid in her muscles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (FROM KITCHEN)
dialog: I told them it doesn't matter how
dialog: talented their daughter is, if she
dialog: misses any more classes, she's out.
dialog: She forgets half of what I teach
dialog: her, and I waste time catching her
dialog: up. It's ridiculous.
dialog: 
text: Nina sits up and retrieves a pair of point shoes from her
text: bag. She considers them for a moment, then starts to put them
dialog: on.
dialog: 
text: She stands, takes a breath, and does a single spin, testing
dialog: the waters.
dialog: 
text: She takes a breath and spins again, then again, then again.
text: Each spin is punctuated by a jab of her foot into the floor.
dialog: 
scene_heading: THWACK, THWACK. THWACK.
dialog: 
text: She jabs her toe down, hard...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Ow!
dialog: 
text: She winces in pain and automatically grabs her foot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA (O.S.)
dialog: Everything alright?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I'm fine!
dialog: 
text: Nina leans her back against the mirror and removes her shoe.
text: Her right big toenail has split, oozing blood.
dialog: 
text: Nina breathes through the pain and puts her shoe back on.
dialog: 
text: She reassumes the position, takes a couple breaths, and
text: starts spinning again.
dialog: 
text: Her toe jabs into the floor. She winces a little with pain,
text: but keeps pushing.
dialog: 
text: Her face grows more determined, focused. 20, 21, 22 spins....
dialog: 
text: She starts to look powerful, willing herself to succeed.
dialog: 14A.
dialog: 
text: At the end of the 32nd spin, Nina jabs her foot down hard.
dialog: 
dialog: She's done it!
dialog: 
text: Nina looks at herself in the mirror, glazed in sweat, a
text: slight smile of satisfaction.
dialog: 15.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 18 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 18
dialog: 
text: Nina sits on the edge of the bed, as Erica douses some GAUZE
text: with PEROXIDE and dabs it on the split toenail. Nina reacts
text: to the sting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Shhh. Almost done...You're working
dialog: yourself too hard. We all have off
dialog: days.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: If that girl hadn't barged in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I'm sure she didn't mean to.
dialog: Remember when you started? If I
dialog: hadn't taken you to each of your
dialog: classes, you would have been
text: completely lost.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I'm gonna talk to him. Tell him I
dialog: finished it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: He knows you can do the coda. It
dialog: won't convince him one way or the

dialog: Oh, sweetheart, I know it's
dialog: disappointing. When you start to
dialog: get older, there's all this
dialog: ridiculous pressure. God knows, I
dialog: understand.
dialog: 
text: Erica squeezes some arnica gel into her palm and massages it
text: into Nina's calves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA (CONT'D)
dialog: But it's alright. No matter what.
dialog: You'll probably get to dance the
dialog: Pas de Quatre again. That's such a
dialog: wonderful part. Or maybe he'll make
dialog: you a Big Swan. Either way, you'll
dialog: shine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I know, mom.
dialog: 15A.
dialog: 
text: Erica removes Nina's EARRINGS, then opens a JEWELRY BOX

text: BALLERINA spins to TINNY MUSIC.
dialog: 
text: Nina gets under the covers. Erica tucks her in and sits down
text: on the edge of the bed.
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Everything will be better in the
dialog: morning. It always is.
dialog:

scene_heading: 22 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY 22
dialog: 
text: Nina waits anxiously outside Leroy's office.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: She puts on a nervous smile. He doesn't reciprocate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Yes, Nina?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Do you have a minute?
dialog: 
text: He doesn't answer, just opens the door to the office and

dialog: 
text: She takes a breath and then follows.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 23 INT. LEROY'S OFFICE - SAME 23
dialog: 
text: Nina closes the door and faces the cozy, dark space. Large
text: couch, posters from the ballet on the wall--several featuring
dialog: Beth.
dialog: 
text: Leroy lights a cigarette, quietly studying her and not making
text: this easy. He takes a drag, and exhales.
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: If now's not a good time...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Now's fine, what is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I just wanted to tell you, I
dialog: practiced the coda last night, and
dialog: I did it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: How thrilling for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
speaker_heading: (THROWN)
dialog: Well...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Okay, Nina, listen, I honestly
dialog: don't care about your technique,
dialog: you should know that by now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Yes, but-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Anyway, I've already chosen
dialog: Veronica, so...
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
speaker_heading: (DEVASTATED)
dialog: I see.
dialog: 
text: She makes a move towards the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: You're not going to try and change
dialog: my mind?
dialog: 
text: She looks back at him, uncertain.
dialog: 
text: Leroy nonchalantly stubs out his cigarette.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: You must have thought it was
dialog: possible, coming to find me like
dialog: this.
dialog: 
text: He pauses, looks her up and down as if trying to decipher
dialog: her.
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: Why are you here? All dolled up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
speaker_heading: (UNSURE)
dialog: I came to ask you to give me the
dialog: part.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: That all?
dialog: 
text: She doesn't know what he means. He comes around his desk and
text: approaches her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: Truth is, when I look at you, all I
dialog: see is the White Swan. Yes, you're
text: beautiful, fragile, fearful. Ideal
dialog: casting. But the Black Swan...it's
dialog: a hard fucking job to dance both.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I can be the Black Swan too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Really? She's hungry, volatile. In
dialog: four years, every time you dance, I
dialog: see you obsess over getting each
dialog: move exactly right, but I never see
dialog: you lose yourself.
dialog: 
text: Insecure, she looks like she wants to run out of the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: All that discipline, for what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I want to be perfect.
dialog: 
text: He laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Perfection's not just about
dialog: control. It's also about letting
text: go. Surprising the audience.
dialog: Surprising yourself. Transcendence.
dialog: 
text: He considers her for a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: Very few have it in them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I-
dialog: 18A.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: It lasts for a moment, but he suddenly jerks away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Ow! Fuck!
dialog: 
text: He touches his lip, stunned.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: You bit me.

dialog: 
text: She's too scared to respond.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (AMUSED)
dialog: I can't believe it. That fucking
dialog: hurt.
dialog:

speaker_heading: NINA
speaker_heading: (MUMBLED)
dialog: Sorry.

text: Veronica notices. Nina looks away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERONICA
speaker_heading: (IRKED)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: Nina shakes her head.
dialog: 
text: A sudden energy sweeps the room, and she hears the sound of
text: scuffling feet and whispering. "It's up." "She just posted
dialog: it." "C'mon."
dialog: 
text: The dancers start exiting into the hallway. Veronica turns to
dialog: follow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Veronica?
dialog: 
text: Veronica turns around. It's hard, but Nina decides to be a
dialog: good loser.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA (CONT'D)
dialog: Congratulations.
dialog: 
text: Nina subtly glances at the exiting girls and Veronica
text: immediately gets it.
dialog: 
text: She excitedly pushes through the crowd of girls, wanting to
dialog: see for herself.

dialog: 
text: Knowing the outcome already, Nina continues stretching in the

scene_heading: 25 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - SAME 25
dialog: 
text: A crowd of dancers surround the bulletin board, jostling to

dialog: 
text: Nina starts walking down the hall in the opposite direction.
dialog: 
text: Behind her, she can hear a small commotion and then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERONICA (O.S.)
dialog: Why did you tell me that?
dialog: 
text: She turns and sees Veronica, her face flushed with anger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERONICA (CONT'D)
dialog: Your idea of a joke?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
speaker_heading: (CONFUSED)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Fuck you.
dialog: 
text: Veronica storms away.
dialog: 
text: The group of girls stares at Nina, making her very self-
text: conscious.
dialog: 
text: Nina tentatively approaches the bulletin board, to see what
text: Veronica's outburst was all about.
dialog: 
text: First a few, then more and more of the girls smile at her.
text: They make room for her as she pushes through.
dialog: 
text: She finally gets to the CASTING NOTICE, finds "Swan Queen"
scene_heading: AND UNDERNEATH:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA SAYERS
dialog: 
text: Stunned, she turns around to face the mass of ballerinas.

dialog: 
text: The other girls start congratulating and hugging Nina, some

dialog: 
scene_heading: 26 INT. THEATER BATHROOM - DAY 26
dialog: 
text: Nina bursts in through the door and heads directly for one of
dialog: the stalls.
dialog: 
text: She locks herself in for privacy and dials a number on her
text: CELL PHONE. She holds it to her ear, anxiously waiting for
dialog: the person to answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Hey...Everything's fine...He picked
dialog: me, mommy.
dialog: 
text: She waits for a response.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you hear me?...Yes, I'm going
dialog: to be the Swan Queen.
dialog: 
text: Nina laughs at her mother's response and can't help but start
text: crying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll be home soon, okay? I just had
dialog: to tell you.
dialog: 
text: Nina hangs up and the tears really start flowing. She's
text: dreamt of this for so long, it's almost too much to bear.
dialog: 
text: She wipes the tears off with the back of her hand and pulls
text: herself together. She comes out of the stall...
dialog: 
text: Horrified to discover "WHORE" written on the mirror in RED
speaker_heading: LIPSTICK.
dialog: 
text: Nina looks around the bathroom, to make sure she's alone.
dialog: 
text: She snags a paper towel and wipes off the insult, smearing

dialog: 
text: Nina opens the door and pokes her head in.
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
text: But Erica's not in there either. Nina glances at the walls.
dialog: 
text: Where several homemade PAINTINGS hang, all of the same
text: subject: Nina as a young girl, posing in a tutu. On a desk,
text: the ORIGINAL PHOTOGRAPH is clipped to a painting in progress.
dialog: 
text: Out of the corner of her eye, one of the portraits seems to
text: shift. Nina turns towards it, but the painting's now
text: perfectly still.
dialog: 
text: Unsettled, Nina withdraws.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 29 INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 29
dialog: 
text: Post-shower, Nina's fuzzy reflection stares back in a steam
text: covered mirror.
dialog: 
text: Nina takes her hand and wipes a streak across, to see herself
text: more clearly.
dialog: 
text: She looks nervous. The enormity of what's in front of her
text: setting in.
dialog: 
text: She turns side-to-side, scrutinizing her body. She lifts her
text: arm and pinches the skin to check her weight.
dialog: 
text: She notices a small cluster of RED BUMPS on her shoulder. A
speaker_heading: small RASH.
dialog: 
text: She feels the bumps with her fingers, bothered.
dialog: 
text: She checks the same place on her other shoulder.
dialog: 
text: There's no rash, just faint streaks of SCAR TISSUE.
dialog: 
text: Nina slides the hamper in front of the door to block it.
dialog: 
text: In the mirror now, one of the bumps is scratched and
dialog: bleeding.
dialog: 
text: Nina quickly wipes the blood off with her finger.
dialog:

scene_heading: 30 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 30
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: My daughter, the Swan Queen.
dialog: 
text: She opens her arms and Nina falls into a hug.
dialog: 
text: She looks at the cake. It has a ballerina sketched with
text: frosting. Nina hides her disdain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Oh, mom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: It's our favorite, vanilla with
text: strawberry filling.
dialog: 
text: Erica picks up a knife and slices into the cake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Just a little piece.
dialog: 
text: Erica ignores her and starts cutting a very large piece.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA (CONT'D)
dialog: That's way too much.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: It's a celebration.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA

dialog: Mom, don't. I'm sorry.

dialog: 
text: She dances away from him, a scared look on her face,

dialog: 
text: David gives chase, but Nina spins out of his grasp,
text: disentangles from him.
dialog: 
text: But he eventually snags her, and they come very close
dialog: together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Okay!
dialog: 
text: The music stops. Nina breaks out of character and looks at

dialog: 
text: The Russian ballet mistress nods and smiles, clearly pleased.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, Nina. Very good.
dialog:

text: approaches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: But I knew the White Swan wouldn't

dialog: 
text: Curious, she walks to the open doorway and stops to watch.
dialog: 
text: CORPS MEMBERS and a few soloists form two lines on both sides
text: of the room. In the middle, Veronica dances along with Lily.
dialog: 
text: Nina pays close attention to Lily, sizing her up. Her dancing
text: is explosive, exudes sex.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (O.S.)
dialog: Watch the way she moves...
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
text: Leroy has snuck up behind Nina at the doorway and gets very

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
text: Imprecise, but sensual. She's not

dialog: 
text: More applause. Nervous, Nina unconsciously picks at her

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: As we all know, every great career

dialog: at the end of the season. She will

dialog: She will be greatly missed, but she

dialog: But as we bid adieu to one star, we
dialog: welcome another!

speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: As you know, we open our season

dialog: Taking the role of our new Swan

dialog:

dialog: proceedings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: Soon you will have the pleasure of
dialog: seeing her perform, tonight we

text: Leroy escorts Nina out. It's a couple hours later and she's

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I think I drank too much. All those

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: You did well.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
speaker_heading: (MELTING)
dialog: I guess.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: I'll get you a cab. Where you
dialog: going?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Oh, Upper West Side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Why don't you come to my place
dialog: first? It's on the way.
dialog: 
text: She gives him a coy glance, reading between the lines and
text: hiding her excitement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: For a drink. Unless you've had
dialog: enough.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: No, that's good.
dialog: 
text: He starts to look for a cab.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. BRINSON (O.S.)
dialog: Thomas!!!
dialog: 
text: They turn, see Mrs. Brinson, the host of the party, standing
text: at the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. BRINSON (CONT'D)
dialog: You need to say hello to Karen
dialog: Halloway before you disappear.
dialog: She's from Texas. Correction: she
dialog: is Texas.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
speaker_heading: (TO NINA)
dialog: A minute more of ass-kissing. Wait
dialog: here.
dialog: 
text: He runs back inside to say his goodbyes.
dialog: 
text: Nina smiles after him, giddy and anxious.
dialog: 
text: She notices a slender figure watching her from the shadows of
text: the adjoining doorway. In the dark, she looks like Nina.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
speaker_heading: (CONCERNED)
dialog: Hello?
dialog: 
text: Spotted, the figure backs up, seeming to disappear.
dialog: 
text: Nina cautiously approaches, but can't see anyone.
dialog: 
text: She gets closer to the doorway...and someone JUMPS OUT,
text: startling her.
dialog: 
text: It's Beth, drunk and shivering. Cheeks streaked with mascara.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA (CONT'D)
dialog: Beth? What are you doing out here?
dialog: 
text: Beth stares her down. Nina backs up, nervously grabbing her
text: earlobe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA (CONT'D)
dialog: I was crushed to hear that you're
dialog: leaving.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What'd you do to get the role?
dialog: 33.
dialog: 
text: Nina shakes her head, confused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT'D)
dialog: He always said you were a frigid
dialog: little girl.
dialog: 
text: Her words needle Nina, too close to the truth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT'D)
dialog: So what did you do to make him
dialog: change his mind? Suck his cock?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Some of us don't need to do that.
dialog: 
text: Nina's struck a nerve. Beth starts to come at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You fucking little whore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
speaker_heading: (GUILTY)
dialog: Beth, I'm-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (O.S.)
dialog: What's going on?
dialog: 
text: They both turn to see Leroy returned.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I need to talk to you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: You're drunk. You should go home.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Don't do that! Don't just dismiss
dialog: me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
speaker_heading: (EXASPERATED)
dialog: Poor, poor little princess. Try to
dialog: hold it together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I'm going to drop by later, okay? I
dialog: have something I want to give you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
speaker_heading: (IGNORING HER)
dialog: Come on.
dialog: 
text: He puts his arm around Nina, starts to lead her away.
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: A token of my appreciation.
dialog: 
text: He ignores her and raises his arm to hail a cab. As they
text: enter the cab, Beth calls after them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Make the most of it Nina.
dialog: 
text: Through the cab window Nina looks at Beth, troubled by her
dialog: words.

scene_heading: 39 INT. LEROY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 39
dialog: 
text: Tasteful but spare loft. Modern and expensive furniture.
text: Large windows.
dialog: 
text: Nina stands alone, looking around his inner sanctum, wide-
dialog: eyed.
dialog: 
text: She explores the pieces of art, the furniture. She touches
text: some of it, in awe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (O.S.)
dialog: Here.
dialog: 
text: She turns, finds Leroy holding out yet another flute of
dialog: champagne. For himself, a scotch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
text: She looks up at him, expecting him to make a move. Instead,
text: he walks away, and sits in a chair. He gestures for her to
dialog: sit as well.
dialog: 
text: Confused, she sits across from him, alone on the large couch.
dialog: 
text: He takes an unceremonious sip of his drink and studies her.
text: Uncomfortable, she takes a drink as well.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: I thought it'd be good to talk
dialog: about the role. Ground us a little.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: The better we get to know each
dialog: other, the more productive we'll
dialog: be. I don't want there to be any
dialog: boundaries between us.
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Me neither.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Good. So, do you have a boyfriend?
dialog: 
text: She's caught off guard by his question and just smiles
text: uncomfortably. He waits for an answer. Finally she manages a
dialog: reply.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: No...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Have you had many in the past?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
text: A few. But no one serious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: You're not a virgin, are you?
dialog: 
text: Her expression sours at this line of questioning. She shakes
text: her head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: Then there's nothing to be
dialog: embarrassed about, is there?
dialog: (she shakes her head)
dialog: And you enjoy making love?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Excuse me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Sex. Do you enjoy it?
dialog: 
text: Blushing and feeling awkward, she takes a sip of champagne.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: We need to be able to talk about
dialog: this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: So?
dialog: 
text: Nina looks at him, embarrassed, and shrugs.
dialog: 
text: He smirks, and joins her on the couch.
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: I have a homework assignment for

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Yes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Go home and masturbate. Live a

dialog: 
text: She blanches, scandalized. He finishes off his scotch and
dialog: stands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: It's late. Lots of work tomorrow.
dialog: The doorman will find you a cab.
dialog: 
text: He leaves her alone in the living room.

scene_heading: 40 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 40
dialog: 
text: Nina looks at herself in the mirror, removing bobbie-pins, as

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Sounds like quite an evening. Wish
dialog: I could have been there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: You know I asked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I know, Susie told me. Guess he
dialog: wanted you all to himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: That's not why.
dialog: 
text: Erica looks adoringly at Nina's reflection in the mirror.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I don't blame him.
dialog: 
text: Erica starts to remove Nina's DIAMOND EARRINGS, but pauses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA (CONT'D)
dialog: Where did you get these?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: They're fake.
dialog: 37.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Fooled me.
dialog: 
text: Erica removes the earrings, then walks behind Nina to unzip
text: her. Nina faces her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I can do it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Turn.
dialog: 
text: Nina turns back around, reticent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: He must have been at your side all
dialog: night, showing you off.
dialog: 
text: Erica finishes unzipping the red dress and sees Nina's
dialog: shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh Nina...
dialog: 
text: Remembering, Nina pulls away from her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: It's just a rash.
dialog: 
text: Erica gruffly pulls Nina to the mirror and turns her around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: 
text: Nina checks her reflection and sees the RASH, red and
text: irritated from scratching.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: It was worse a couple days ago.
dialog: It's already getting better.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: You've been scratching again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: NO-
dialog:

scene_heading: 41 INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 41
dialog:

dialog: 38.
dialog: 
text: Erica finishes dabbing her back with HYDROGEN PEROXIDE and
text: replaces the cap on the bottle.
dialog: 
text: She pulls out NAIL CLIPPERS and cuts Nina's nails down to
text: their base. Each CLICK makes Nina twitch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I thought you'd outgrown this
dialog: disgusting habit.(click) You
dialog: haven't done it for years. (click)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Mom, please.
dialog: 
text: Erica grabs Nina's other hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: It's the role, isn't it? All this

dialog: too much.
dialog: 
text: Nina stares at her, seething.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 42 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - LATER 42
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Don't be mad at me. You know I love
dialog: you, you know I want what's best.
dialog: But we have to take care of you.
dialog: 
text: Nina doesn't respond.
dialog: 
text: Erica opens the JEWELRY BOX and the tinny music begins
dialog: playing.
dialog: 
text: She hums and starts to stroke Nina's hair.
dialog: 
text: Nina tries to brush her hand away.
dialog: 
text: But Erica brings it back and keeps stroking.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 43 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 43
dialog: 
text: Nina lies wide awake after a restless night.
dialog: 
text: She slowly reaches down under the covers, down between her
text: legs, to complete Leroy's "homework assignment."
dialog: 
text: She closes her eyes and starts to maneuver.
dialog: 39.
dialog: 
text: She suddenly hears a RUSTLING sound and a short SNORE.
dialog: 
text: She freezes and opens her eyes. She slowly sits up in bed and
text: sees Erica SLEEPING on a chair in the corner of the room.
dialog: 
text: Nina glares at her.

dialog: 
text: She watches Veronica perform her leaps. She rejoins the
text: group, giving Nina a nasty stare.
dialog: 
text: Nina avoids it, looking towards Lily, who gives her a small
dialog: smile.
dialog: 
text: Just as Nina's turn arrives, a panicked YOUNG CORPS DANCER
text: rushes in and makes a beeline for the severe ballet mistress.
dialog: 
text: Nina takes one leap and then stops dancing, sensing
dialog: something's wrong.
dialog: 
text: The corps dancer whispers into the ballet mistress' ear. A
text: look of shock on the mistress' face.
dialog: 
text: The dancer collapses into the older woman's arms.
dialog: 
text: The piano music trickles to a halt.
dialog: 
text: Nina exchanges glances with some of the other dancers.
dialog: 
text: First a few, then more dancers approach the two women,

dialog: 
text: Nina hangs back, filled with a sinking feeling.

speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Oh my god...

speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: I'm sure she did it on purpose.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: How do you know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Everything Beth ever did came from
text: within. From some dark impulse.
dialog: It's what could make her so
text: thrilling to watch. Even perfect at
dialog: times. But also destructive.
dialog: 
text: Nina hesitates, but has to ask.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Was it right after we saw her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: It's not your problem. This has
dialog: nothing to do with you.
dialog: 
text: She looks away, not so sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: Nina, don't let yourself be
dialog: distracted. Dance is not
dialog: immortalized like music, poetry or
dialog: art. It lives for now. For this
dialog: moment only. And this is your
dialog: moment.
dialog: 
text: She attempts a nod.

scene_heading: A46 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - DAY A46
dialog: 
text: Beth's belongings have already been packed up and cleared.
text: Guilt-ridden, Nina tries to get ready.
dialog: 
text: She picks up her duffel bag, and removes her SATCHEL. She
text: unpacks its contents onto the counter: needle and thread,
text: cigarettes, a makeup compact, and the tube of lipstick.
dialog: 
text: She looks over at the vase of flowers. A few have wilted.
dialog: 
text: She pulls them out to make the bouquet look fresh again.

scene_heading: 46 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 46
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Members of BETH'S FAMILY surround the bed, blocking Beth from

dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLDER NURSE
dialog: You can go in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: It's okay.
dialog: 
text: The older nurse gives her a skeptical glance and continues on

dialog: 
text: Nina walks a little further and leans against the wall to
dialog: wait.
dialog: 
text: She hears the sound of shuffling feet, looks over, and sees

scene_heading: 47 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM- DAY 47
dialog: 
text: Beth is bandaged and unconscious, attached to MACHINES.

text: Nina stands at a distance, too intimidated to approach at
dialog: first.
dialog: 
text: She looks around the room. It is lined with large, EXPENSIVE-
text: LOOKING BOUQUETS.
dialog: 
text: She removes the flowers Leroy gave her from the brown bag,
text: and sets them next to the others.
dialog: 
text: Nina slowly approaches Beth's bedside.
dialog: 
text: Beth's face is heavily wrapped with bandages. Only her closed
text: eyes and pale lips can be seen.
dialog: 
text: She scans down her body, sees a sliver of her thigh, purple
text: with bruises.
dialog: 
text: Curious, Nina lifts the top edge of the blanket and peeks
dialog: underneath.
dialog: 42.
dialog: 
text: The legs are bloated and horribly bruised, pierced with large

dialog: 
text: She looks lower and lower, and discovers MAGGOTS feeding on

dialog: 
text: Nina quietly slips back inside her room.
dialog: 
text: She removes the wood piece and jams it between the door
text: closet, creating a makeshift doorjamb
dialog: 
text: She tests it. Holds pretty well.
dialog: 
text: She hears a creek. FOOTSTEPS approach. She removes the wood

speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: No, no, not so stiff. Don't be

dialog: 
text: He lets go, she moves away from him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Use each finger, your face, your
dialog: tits, everything. Entice me!
dialog: 
text: He grabs her wrist. She spins. He lets go. He grabs her other
text: wrist, she spins to face him.
dialog: 
text: They get very close.
dialog: 
text: Just before they kiss she dips, pulls away.
dialog: 43-46B.
dialog: 
text: He grabs her arm again, she spins, then he stops her, her

dialog: 
text: He runs his hands down her arms. Slowly, seductively. She
text: trembles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: Just feel my touch and respond.
dialog: 
text: She turns and leans in close, as though to kiss him... almost
text: touching lips...but then she tries to push off again. He
text: tightens his grip, holds her there.
dialog: 
text: She looks back at him, questioning. He looks at her
text: intently, pulls her to him, and kisses her.
dialog: 
text: She melts and eagerly kisses him back. He pulls away,
dialog: momentarily.

dialog: 
text: He pushes her back against the mirror. She whimpers.
dialog: 
text: He runs his hand down her body, then reaches between her

dialog: 
text: She throws her head back as he kisses her neck. She breathes

dialog: 
text: Suddenly, he pulls away from her. She looks at him confused,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: NINA

dialog: 
text: The world has soft edges, colors are vivid and bleed into one

dialog: 
text: Lily twirls her around.

scene_heading: 66 INT. CLUB BATHROOM - LATER 66
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Nina watches her hand with a smile on her face, glances at

dialog: 
text: Nina flees to the door. Pauses. She peeks back and sees that
text: it's actually Lily.
dialog: 
text: Relieved, she grabs Lily and kisses her, revved-up.
dialog: 
text: Lily responds with equal force. They claw at each other,
dialog: passion exceeding coordination.
dialog: 
text: Lily pulls Nina's shirt off and throws her onto the bed.
dialog: 
text: She straddles Nina, who looks up at her carnivorously.
dialog: 
text: Lily takes her own top off, plunges down and kisses Nina.
dialog: 
text: Nina flips Lily over, becomes the dominant one.
dialog: 
text: Lily scratches Nina's back, over some of the rash.
dialog: 
text: There's subtle movement underneath the skin. Little pin
text: pricks push up the flesh, trailing behind her hand.
dialog: 
text: Self-conscious, Nina grabs Lily's hand and holds her wrists
dialog: down.
dialog: 
text: She bites her neck. Lily smiles, likes the violence.
dialog: 
text: She digs her nails into Nina's hands.
dialog: 
text: Then Lily gets back on top of Nina. The tattooed lilies on
text: her back undulate and spread out. Morphing into dark wings.
dialog: 
text: She kisses down Nina's body. Further and further...
dialog: 71.
dialog: 
text: Lily starts to go down on Nina.
dialog: 
text: Nervous, Nina whimpers. Glances down and sees the DOUBLE.
dialog: 
text: She tries to pull away.
dialog: 
text: LILY shushes her.
dialog: 
text: Nina calms back down, seeing that it's her. She takes a

dialog: 
text: Bumps shoot up all over her skin as her breath quickens.
dialog: 
text: She closes her eyes, allows the sensation to invade her body
speaker_heading: and CLIMAXES.
dialog:

text: The girl spins and Nina sees her face. It's Lily!
dialog: 
text: Horrified, Nina runs onto

dialog: 
speaker_heading: 76 STAGE 76
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Nina bursts onto stage as the Black Swan, accompanied by
dialog: Rothbart.
dialog: 
text: She looks powerful, intense as she moves towards David.
dialog: 
text: His face shows his surprise.
dialog: 
text: Nina dances the first Pas de Deux with him. They finish and
speaker_heading: EXIT

speaker_heading: 111B BACKSTAGE 111B
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
speaker_heading: WOW-
dialog: 
text: She walks away from him.
dialog: 
text: Alone, she looks at her arms, sees black points trying to
text: push through again.
dialog: 
text: Some fully emerge as shiny BLACK FEATHERS.
dialog: 
text: She just watches them, not panicking, but accepting the
text: transformation taking place. Even beckoning it.
dialog: 
text: Her second entrance cue is played.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER
dialog: That's you!
dialog: 
text: She leaps back on
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 111C STAGE 111C
dialog: 
text: For the Coda. She takes a brief pause, closing her eyes once
text: more, and then completely lets herself go.
dialog: 
text: She spins with ferocity. More BLACK FEATHERS burst out from
text: her shoulders and back.
dialog: 
text: At last, she truly embodies the Black Swan.
dialog: 98.
dialog: 
text: She finishes the Coda, punctuating her last spin with a sharp
text: step that echoes through the theater.
dialog: 
text: The audience looks on, mesmerized. Too stunned to clap at
dialog: first.
dialog: 
text: 111D Nina looks down at the stage, her face glazed with sweat 111D
dialog: 
text: She has returned to normal. No feathers. Normal eyes. A
dialog: woman.
dialog: 
text: She finally looks up at the audience, and they ERUPT in a
text: standing ovation.
dialog: 
text: Nina walks to the front of the stage, takes her bow.
dialog: 
text: Nina looks up at the MASS OF BODIES filling the auditorium,
text: vibrating with applause.
dialog: 
text: Proud, Nina smiles and bows again. Again and again.
dialog: 
text: She finally runs off stage, the applause still going strong.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 112 INT. BACKSTAGE - SAME 112
dialog: 
text: Nina enters the wings, other dancers cheer loudly. Even
text: Veronica and Galina.
dialog: 
text: She pushes past all the smiling faces. It feels very
dialog: surreal.
dialog: 
text: She sees Leroy clapping and shaking his head. Blown away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Get back out there! Get back-
dialog: 
text: She stops his mouth with a kiss. The kind of kiss that you
text: can't stop. Not desperate, but adamant.
dialog: 
text: Finally she disengages, staring at him in the eyes, but
text: before he can say anything...
dialog: 
text: She turns and rushes back on stage. He's stunned. Like he's
text: been run over by a truck.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 113 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - LATER 113
dialog: 
text: She walks towards her dressing room, a satisfied smile on her
dialog: face.
dialog: 
text: She passes the stage manager.
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER
dialog: Great job. You got fifteen til the
dialog: last act.
dialog: 
text: She nods and arrives at her room.
dialog: 
text: She opens the door, makes sure no ones looking, and enters
dialog: quickly.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 114 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - SAME 114
dialog: 
text: She closes the door behind her, locks it. Turns and sees the
text: broken glass all over the floor.
dialog: 
text: She eyes the closed wardrobe. A pool of blood drips out from
text: under the door.
dialog: 
text: She picks up a towel and lays it over the blood.
dialog: 
text: She starts to undress.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 115 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 115
dialog: 
text: Back in the White Swan costume, she re-applies the makeup.
dialog: 
text: There's a KNOCK on the door. She looks towards it, her face
dialog: only halfway made-up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
text: One second.
dialog: 
text: She goes to the door, opens it just a crack.
dialog: 
text: She peeks through and finds...
dialog: 
text: LILY looking back at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Hey...you were amazing.
dialog: 
text: Nina's petrified.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY (CONT'D)
dialog: Seriously. I'm sorry things got so
dialog: messed up between us. Just, holy
dialog: shit, totally blown away...
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
text: Nina barely manages a nod.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway, wanted to tell you. I'll
dialog: let you finish. Merde.
dialog: 
text: Lily turns and walks away.
dialog: 
text: Nina swiftly shuts the door.
dialog: 
text: She turns around, stares at the wardrobe.
dialog: 
text: She steps cautiously towards it, her face repeated
text: countlessly in all the reflective shards.
dialog: 
text: She lifts the towel from the ground and looks at it.
dialog: 
text: It is clean. No blood. She looks down at the floor. No blood
dialog: there either.
dialog: 
text: She slowly opens the door to the wardrobe...
dialog: 
text: And finds it empty. No body whatsoever.
dialog: 
text: She looks over at the broken mirror. Sees her reflection
text: staring back at her.
dialog: 
text: She stares at it for a long beat, and realizes something.
dialog: 
text: She touches her stomach and winces a little. Pulls back her
text: hand. It's coated with red liquid. Blood.
dialog: 
text: It's started to soak through the costume, creating a faint
text: red spot. The fabric is ripped at the center of the stain.
dialog: 
text: She feels inside for confirmation.
dialog: 
text: And discovers a stab wound, in her own stomach.
dialog: 
text: She pulls out the sharp tip of mirror still stuck inside.
text: Blood begins flowing more rapidly.
dialog: 
text: She drops the mirror.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER (V.O.)
dialog: (On the PA)
dialog: White Swan in 5.
dialog: 
text: In a daze, she sits down at the vanity, and finishes applying
text: the rest of the White Swan's makeup.
dialog: 101.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 116A INT. STAGE - LATER 116A
dialog: 
text: Nina dances the final Pas de Deux as the White Swan. Losing
text: blood by the second, everything is woozy and blurry.
dialog: 
text: She can't do all the steps, but her performance is pained,
text: making it poignant.
dialog: 
text: A spot of red begins to soak through at the center of her
dialog: costume.
dialog: 
text: The music turns ominous, and VON ROTHBART, the evil sorcerer,
text: comes onto stage.
dialog: 
text: Nina dances away from him, back upstage, towards the cliff.
text: It's time for her final leap.
dialog: 
text: Her energy fading, she teeters up the stairs of the set. One
dialog: step at a time...
dialog: 
text: She gets to the top, takes one last look around, at all the
text: eyes watching her.
dialog: 
text: She notices a familiar face in the audience: HER MOTHER. She
text: watches with a profound sadness, tears streaking her cheeks.
dialog: 
text: In the front of Nina's costume, a dark circle has started to
text: form. Her blood fully seeping through.
dialog: 
text: And Nina leaps...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 116B INTO BLACKNESS 116B
dialog: 
text: She falls through an endless void, her eyes closed.
dialog: 
text: She slowly twists around in the air, so that she's falling
dialog: backwards.
dialog: 
text: She hears something. Soft and muffled.
dialog: 
text: The faint sound of applause.
dialog: 
text: 116C She lands slowly and comfortably on PADDING. 116C
dialog: 
text: The sound of applause is now loud, uproarious.
dialog: 
text: A group of BALLERINAS surround the mattress, clapping for
text: her, each one dressed as a WHITE SWAN.
dialog: 
text: Leroy pushes through the group to get to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Listen to them! They love you! Get
dialog: up, get up!
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: I always knew you had it in you,
dialog: little princess. Go take your bow!
dialog: 
text: Nina is too weak to move.
dialog: 
text: Lily pushes her way into the group and GASPS, pointing at
text: Nina's abdomen.
dialog: 
text: Leroy follows her gaze and discovers the spot of blood, which
dialog: has grown in size.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: What did you do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I felt it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Oh my god.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: ...perfect.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEROY
dialog: Someone, get help.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Shhh...
dialog: 
text: Leroy looks back at her. She smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA (CONT'D)
dialog: It was perfect.
dialog: 
text: He understands.
dialog: 
text: The APPLAUSE grows more and more faint. Her eyes glaze over
text: and everything goes completely SILENT.
dialog: 
text: Nina lies there motionless, a smile frozen on her face.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO BLACK.
dialog:
