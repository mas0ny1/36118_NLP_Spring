text: screaming fans at Madison Square Garden.
dialog: 
text: The sounds of a SCREAMING, CHEERING CROWD overwhelm us. Over
text: the images, RINGSIDE ANNOUNCERS boom commentary:
dialog: 
dialog: ----"Oh, my! Ram hit with a devastating piledriver!"
dialog: 
dialog: ----"I've never seen a guy get fired into a buckle that hard!"
dialog: 
dialog: ----"The Ayatollah taking it to The Ram outside the ring!"

scene_heading: INT. EAST WILMINGTON HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Present day. Post-match. Randy, pushing 50, still with the
text: same long, dyed-blond mane, sits on a bench in the boys
text: locker room of a Wilmington, Delaware high school.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CHYRON: 20 YEARS LATER
dialog: 
text: He pulls off his purple spandex wrestling tights. Lime-green
text: ram's horns run up the sides. They're the same kind of tights
text: as in the `80s pics----and may well be the actual same pair.
dialog: 
text: Naked except for a jockstrap, Randy takes a breath. Achy,
text: sweaty, saggy, exhausted. A battered warrior. Scars all over
text: his body. Despite the rough shape he's in, it's clear he's
text: just given it his all in the ring. He swigs down a few pills
text: with a beer.
dialog: 
text: Promoter SCOTT BRUMBERG, a heavyset man in a Mets jersey with
text: BRUMBERG - 44 on the back, approaches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG
dialog: Great show, Ram. Ya turned it out.
dialog: (a little sad)

speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry. I was sure the gate'd be

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EAST WILMINGTON HIGH SCHOOL - SHORT TIME LATER
dialog: 
text: Randy, changed into his street clothes, limps out of the
text: school, each step labored and painful. Waiting near the
text: entrance are TWO FANS, both men in their 30s.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FAN #1
dialog: Yo, Ram. Think you could...?
dialog: 
text: Fan #1 holds out a SHARPIE and an old WRESTLING PROGRAM from
text: the `80s. On the cover is a shot of Randy wrestling CORPORAL
text: PUNISHMENT, a heel in a drill instructor get-up.
dialog: 
text: Randy takes the program, happy to oblige.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FAN #1 (CONT'D)
dialog: I was there.
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Randy hands back the program. FAN #2 hands him a MINI-POSTER.
text: The faded, mid-'80s poster features Randy, biceps bulging,
text: crushing a head of broccoli between his fists. Across the
text: top, it says "EAT YOUR VEGETABLES, PUNK!"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FAN #2
dialog: (as Randy signs)
dialog: My first match ever was you versus
text: Davey Diamond at the Spectrum.
speaker_heading: (NOSTALGIC)
dialog: 1985...
dialog: 
text: Randy smiles a little. He remembers, too. He hands back the
text: poster. Fan #2 looks fondly at Randy, a part of his boyhood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FAN #2 (CONT'D)
dialog: (vaguely sad)
dialog: You were awesome.
dialog: 
text: Randy nods, a bit uncomfortably. The two fans, muttering
text: thanks, drift off into the Delaware night. Randy is left
text: standing alone, still holding Fan #1's pen.
dialog: 
text: He walks over to a beat-up old CONVERSION VAN and climbs in.
text: Turns on the engine. Music starts up on the stereo mid-song.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

dialog: 
text: RANDY'S POV: The door is PADLOCKED.
dialog: 
text: He tugs on the lock. Tugs on the door. No dice.

text: Randy lies on a scrunched-up mattress on the floor, unable to
dialog: sleep.
dialog: 
text: The van wall is decorated with a MINI-SHRINE Randy has built
text: to himself. Old magazine and newspaper clippings, mini-
text: posters, etc. A few changes of clothes lie in a messy heap in
dialog: the corner.
dialog: 
text: He grabs a bottle of pills and pops a few, washing them down

dialog: Raaam!

scene_heading: RANDY'S POV: Through the front windshield, TWO 8-YEAR-OLD
text: KIDS, boosted by TWO OTHER KIDS, are peering in.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE OAKS - SHORT TIME LATER
dialog: 
text: Randy is playfully tussling with the four kids. He picks one
text: of them up and "bodyslams" him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: (announcer voice)
dialog: Oh, my... look out!
dialog: 
text: He picks up another one and fake-drops him on his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Suplex!

speaker_heading: LEN THE MANAGER
dialog: You'll get in when I get my rent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: You know I'm good for it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEN THE MANAGER
dialog: Sure. You're good for it every time
dialog: this happens.
dialog: 
text: Randy sigh-groans in frustration.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Can I at least park in back?
dialog: 
text: Len looks at Randy. A wave of pity comes over him.

speaker_heading: LEN THE MANAGER
dialog: Twenty bucks.

scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE OAKS - IN BACK - EVENING
dialog: 
text: Randy sits on a MILK CRATE by his parked van. On the ground
text: in front of him is a BLENDER connected to an extension cord
text: stretching to another TRAILER. He pours a protein-shake
text: packet into the blender.
dialog: 
text: The trailer door opens. A WOMAN comes out. Lighting a
text: cigarette, she looks up at the cloudless, starry sky.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Wayne casually clicks a porn site closed on his computer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's try that again.
dialog: 
text: Randy steps out and closes the door behind him. He knocks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE (CONT'D)

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, hi, Randy! What can I do for

speaker_heading: RANDY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: What's the matter, they raise the

dialog: 
text: He passes Cheetah's, a STRIP CLUB. He keeps an eye on it as

dialog: Think you could...?
dialog: 
text: She coldly takes it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: No problemo.

text: Randy SMASHING KID LOCO IN THE FACE with a flying drop-kick.
text: Kid Loco falls to the canvas.
dialog: 
text: Randy struts around the ring, exhorting the crowd, soaking up
text: their cheers.
dialog: 
text: Distracted, Randy doesn't notice Kid Loco peeling himself off
text: the mat. Kid Loco sneaks up behind Randy and SMASHES HIM IN
text: THE HEAD. Randy goes down.
dialog: 
text: Kid Loco lifts Randy up. They're both on their knees, chest-
text: to-chest. Kid Loco steps to his feet, lifting Randy with him.
dialog: 
text: Kid Loco tightens around Randy's arms, arches his back,
text: presses out his chest and... WHAM!! He and Randy fly with a
text: LATERAL DROP. Randy's head hits the canvas hard as he slams
text: down on his back.
dialog: 
text: As Randy writhes on the mat, Kid Loco HEADS FOR THE
scene_heading: TURNBUCKLE.
dialog: 
text: RANDY'S POV: Kid Loco is untying the turnbuckle's padded
dialog: cover.
dialog: 
text: Randy, clutching his back, discretely reaches into the
text: waistband of his tights and pulls out a RAZOR BLADE. He tucks
text: the blade between two fingers in his cupped palm.
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Kid Loco heads back to Randy. He picks up him by the hair and
text: drags him to the turnbuckle, throwing him HEAD-FIRST into the
text: exposed metal post beneath.
dialog: 
text: Randy, clutching his smashed head, discretely runs the blade
text: along his hairline. No one sees it happen.
dialog: 
text: BLOOD STREAMS DOWN Randy's forehead. The crowd's ELECTRIFIED.
dialog: 
text: Kid Loco slams Randy's head into the metal post again. Again.
text: Randy slumps over the corner ropes. Kid Loco cockily struts
text: around the ring.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KID LOCO
dialog: Look at this loser! How pathetic.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON Randy. The taunting stirs something in him. A look
text: comes over him, like he's Bruce Banner about to become the
dialog: Hulk.
dialog: 
text: Kid Loco saunters back over to Randy. He grabs his head for
text: another post smash, but HE CAN'T. Randy's neck and arm
text: muscles bulge. His neck veins pop like he's suddenly super-
dialog: charged.
dialog: 
text: A look of FEAR comes over Kid Loco. He knows the tide is
text: about to turn.
dialog: 
text: Randy reaches over his shoulder and grabs Kid Loco by the
text: hair. He pulls him in close.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: (under breath)
dialog: Let's go home.
dialog: 
text: Randy juts his hips back and bends over, gaining the leverage
text: he needs for a throw. Kid Loco shakes his head, begging no.
dialog: 
text: Randy straightens his legs, raises his lower back, and yanks
text: down on Kid Loco's head. Kid Loco's feet fly off the canvas
text: as his head gets BURIED INTO THE MAT. He gets stuck UPSIDE
text: DOWN with his feet over the ropes.
dialog: 
text: Randy, holding onto the top rope with both hands, thrusts his
text: knee into Kid Loco's stomach. Again. Again.
dialog: 
text: Kid Loco somehow manages to untangle himself from the ropes.
text: He scurries away. Randy goes after him.
dialog: 
text: Randy hits Kid Loco with everything he's got. Dropkicks.
text: Elbows. Bodyslams. He pours it on, unstoppable.
dialog: 
text: Randy drags Kid Loco into the middle of the ring. He looks
text: out at the crowd.
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: RANDY'S POV: A trio of fans are chanting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRIO
dialog: Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
dialog: 
text: Randy cups his hand to his ear. The chant quickly spreads.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHOLE CROWD (O.S.)
dialog: RAM JAM! RAM JAM! RAM JAM!...
dialog: 
text: Randy "mulls" it over. He looks at his laid-out foe. He looks
text: at the corner. He heads for the corner.
dialog: 
text: Randy climbs to the top rope. He looks around at the crowd
text: like he's still undecided.
dialog: 
text: RANDY'S POV: The fans are cheering, wild with anticipation.
dialog: 
text: Randy bends his arms, pressing them against the side of his
text: head like ram's horns. (Just like in the photo in the opening
dialog: montage.)
dialog: 
dialog: He LEAPS.
dialog: 
text: The leap is not terribly high or graceful. He crashes down
text: onto Kid Loco horns-first. Kid Loco's whole body convulses.
dialog: 
dialog: The fans lose it. This is what they wanted. The Ram Jam. The
dialog: money shot.

speaker_heading: DUDE #2 DUDE #1
dialog: Jesus!! What the FUCK!!
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Thanks a lot. That was 200 bucks

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hellbilly Cannibaaaal!
dialog: 
text: Through the curtain, HELLBILLY CANNIBAL emerges. A huge,
text: overalls-clad, mangy, wild-eyed masochist. Crumbs cling to
text: his scraggly beard. He's dragging a heavy CANVAS SACK.
dialog: 
text: A TEENAGER in the crowd holds up a sign reading HELLBILLY
text: CANNIBAL SUCKS A FAT DICK.
dialog: 
text: Hellbilly Cannibal climbs into the ring with his sack and a
text: folding chair. He heads to the center of the ring, where
text: Randy awaits.
dialog: 
text: They sit down on chairs facing each other. Under Hellbilly
text: Cannibal's chair is his canvas sack. Under Randy's is his
text: Dollar Tree plastic shopping bag.
dialog: 
text: Hellbilly Cannibal punches Randy. Randy punches Hellbilly
text: Cannibal. They take turns punching each other, each shot a
text: little harder than the last. It's like a violent game of
dialog: "slaps".
dialog: 
text: After a stretch of this, Hellbilly Cannibal reaches into his
text: sack and pulls out a can of BUG SPRAY. He SPRAYS it in
text: Randy's face. Randy falls off his chair. He staggers around
text: the ring clutching his face, howling in agony.
dialog: 
text: Hellbilly Cannibal smashes the blinded Randy over the head
text: with his chair. Randy falls to his knees. Hellbilly Cannibal
text: reaches into his sack and pulls out a FLUORESCENT LIGHT TUBE.
text: Wielding it like a bat, he SMACKS RANDY in the face. The tube
text: explodes with a pop.
dialog: 
text: Grabbing a folding chair, Hellbilly Cannibal charges toward
text: Randy. He takes a flying leap, riding the chair like a boogie
text: board. Just as he's about to crash down on Randy, Randy ROLLS
text: OUT OF THE WAY. Hellbilly Cannibal's spine gets a violent
text: jolt as the chair hits the mat.
dialog: 
text: Randy reaches into his Dollar Tree bag and pulls out an
text: aluminum COOKIE TRAY. He smacks Hellbilly Cannibal in the
text: face with it. The tray makes an awesomely loud METALLIC
text: CLANG. Randy hits him a bunch more times.
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Randy is starting to get winded. His heart beats faster.
dialog: 
text: He picks up Hellbilly Cannibal and flings him toward the
text: ropes. Hellbilly Cannibal, bouncing off, ducks Randy's
text: awaiting forearm. He bounces off the opposite ropes and
text: crashes into Randy knee-first.
dialog: 
text: Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy by the hair and smashes his
text: face into the corner post. He scoops him up and FLIPS HIM
text: OVER THE TOP ROPE, out of the ring. Randy LANDS HARD on the
text: concrete floor.
dialog: 
text: Hellbilly Cannibal hops out of the ring with the folding
text: chair. He WHALES RANDY IN THE FACE with it. Randy stumbles
text: backwards toward the metal barricade between the ring and the
text: fans. Hellbilly Cannibal kicks him in the chest. Randy flips
text: over the barricade, into the crowd. Fans scatter in an
text: exhilarated panic.
dialog: 
text: Hellbilly Cannibal throws Randy into a row of empty chairs.
text: Randy goes sprawling. Chairs fly everywhere.
dialog: 
text: Randy gets up. His heart is beating LOUD. FAST.
dialog: 
text: Randy, dazed, heads toward the SNACK-BAR AREA. Hellbilly
text: Cannibal follows after him. Randy grabs a metal GARBAGE CAN
text: and WHIPS AROUND WITH IT, smacking Hellbilly Cannibal square
text: in the face. Hellbilly Cannibal goes down.
dialog: 
text: Randy shakes out the can's contents over Hellbilly Cannibal,
text: showering him in trash. He shoves Hellbilly Cannibal's head
text: into the can and falls on it, ass-first.
dialog: 
text: Randy grabs the ladder resting along the base of the ring. He
text: POUNDS THE GARBAGE CAN with it, making an UNHOLY RACKET.
dialog: 
text: With the can still over his head, Hellbilly Cannibal rises to
text: his feet. He HEADBUTTS RANDY with the can. Randy, stumbling
text: around, gets headbutted again. Hellbilly Cannibal throws off
text: the can and drags Randy back to the ring by his hair,
text: carrying the ladder in his other hand.
dialog: 
text: Plopping Randy down on the mat, Hellbilly Cannibal sets up
text: the ladder in the middle of the ring. He heads back out and
text: grabs the folding table, setting it up by the ladder. He
text: reaches into Randy's Dollar Tree bag and pulls out a BOX OF
text: THUMBTACKS. He scatters the tacks all over the table.
dialog: 
text: Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy and pulls him up the ladder
text: with him. They stand at the top, perched high above the
text: table. Just as Hellbilly Cannibal is about to push off, Randy
text: surprises him with a VICIOUS HEAD-BUTT. Hellbilly Cannibal is
text: caught totally off guard. Randy headbutts him again. Randy
text: grabs Hellbilly Cannibal and PUSHES OFF.
dialog: 
dialog: 32.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: In mid-air, Randy does a 180 twist, causing Hellbilly
text: Cannibal to CRASH THROUGH THE TABLE with Randy on top of him.
dialog: 
text: Hellbilly Cannibal rolls around the mat in a daze, his back
text: bloodied and covered with tacks. He staggers to his feet.
text: Randy hits him with a dropkick.
dialog: 
text: Randy's heartbeat is DEAFENING. All other sounds drop out.
dialog: 
text: Randy pulls Hellbilly Cannibal off the mat. As he gears up
text: for another dropkick, his KNEES BUCKLE. A look comes over his
text: face. He DROPS TO HIS KNEES, one hand on the mat.
dialog: 
text: Randy grabs his arm. He massages it. He FLOPS OVER, clutching
text: his chest. He lies on his back gasping for breath, sucking at
dialog: the air.
dialog: 
text: RANDY'S POV: The fans are unaware anything is wrong. They
dialog: assume it's part of the act.
dialog: 
text: Hellbilly Cannibal sees a look of FEAR in Randy's eyes. He
text: knows this is real. He looks out at the crowd.

scene_heading: HELLBILLY CANNIBAL
dialog: Is there a doctor?
dialog: 
text: Few fans look around. Most of them still think this is a gag.
dialog: 
text: Among those who sense it's real is JERRY DIFUSCO, the event's

speaker_heading: JERRY DIFUSCO (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's get him up.
dialog: 
text: With no small effort, they lift Randy. They carry him to the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEX LETHAL
dialog: Put him down.
dialog: 
text: They lower him to the mat. Lex hops out of the ring and grabs

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Several of the other guys hop out of the ring, supporting
text: Randy's underside as they carefully, awkwardly pull him out.
dialog: 
text: By now, the crowd realizes this is real. They surge forward

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: So, like, wrestling...
dialog: 
scene_heading: DR. TARACHANDANI
dialog: Not a good idea.

speaker_heading: RANDY

speaker_heading: RANDY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Damn. What are you gonna do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I don't know. I don't know what to
dialog: do. If I can't wrestle...
dialog: 
text: He loses himself in some bleak thought.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: It just happened. You don't have to
dialog: figure everything out this second.
dialog: Give yourself some time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Time's all I got. I just sit there
dialog: all day...
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He stares off bleakly again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: You really shouldn't be alone right
dialog: now.
dialog: 
text: He turns to her, looking her in the eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: That's why I came to see you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: (a little unnerved)
dialog: Randy...
dialog: 
text: She looks at him with sympathy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT'D)
dialog: I feel bad what happened. But you
dialog: and me... I can't go there.
dialog: 
text: Randy gives her a sour, disappointed look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You should be with family now. You
dialog: have a daughter, right? Where is
dialog: she?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: We don't really get along too good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: It doesn't matter. You need her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: (bitter chuckle)
dialog: She don't need me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Everybody needs a father. Trust me.
dialog: 
text: Randy shrugs, not so sure. Cassidy glances at the dashboard
dialog: clock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry. I gotta get back in.
dialog: 
text: She puts a sympathetic hand on his knee.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You take care of yourself.
dialog: 
text: She gives him a peck on the cheek. He lingers there for a
text: second. A weird, tentative moment.
dialog: 
dialog: 46.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You gonna be okay?
dialog: 
text: He nods, putting his brave face back on.

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I'm Randy The Ram. I've taken
dialog: bigger bumps than this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: I'm sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Maybe I'll give my daughter a call.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: You should.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Why the fuck not? I'm her father. A
dialog: person only gets one father in this
dialog: life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Exactly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Unless you're adopted.
dialog: 
text: Cassidy laughs. She gives him a friendly pat on the shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: You're gonna be just fine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Definitely.

scene_heading: INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - DAY
dialog:

dialog: 
text: RANDY'S POV: It's a mid-'80s photo of Randy and his infant
text: daughter Stephanie in front of the family Christmas tree.
text: Randy, wearing a Santa cap, is smiling and laughing,
text: Stephanie perched on his huge, steroid-pumped bicep.
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He flips the photo over. On the back are a bunch of scribbled
text: PHONE NUMBERS. They're all crossed-out except the last one.
text: The numbers get progressively more faded from bottom to top,
text: as if they've been written down over the course of years.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE OAKS - PAY PHONE - SHORT TIME LATER
dialog:

speaker_heading: (answering machine BEEP)
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VAN - LATER
dialog: 
text: Randy sits in his van by the curb of a modest, lower-middle-
text: class house. He looks at the house, working up the nerve to
dialog: approach.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - LATER
dialog: 
text: Randy stands at the doorstep of the house. Steeling himself,
text: he rings the bell. A WOMAN (22) appears at the door in a T-
text: SHIRT and PANTIES.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: (a little thrown)
dialog: Hey... Is Stephanie home?
dialog: 
text: The woman looks at Randy a little coldly, sensing who he is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE WOMAN
dialog: Who can I say it is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Her father.
dialog: 
text: She disappears into the house.
dialog: 
text: A few moments later, Stephanie emerges with a BACKPACK slung
text: over her shoulder. In her hands is a TEXTBOOK. She heads
text: straight down the driveway, blowing past Randy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Where you going?
dialog: 
text: He goes after her.
dialog: 
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Stephanie!
dialog: 
text: He catches up. She stops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: What do you want?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Can we talk?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Now's really not a good time.
dialog: 
text: She resumes walking, briskly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Wait!

dialog: Where ya going?
dialog: 
text: He looks at the textbook in her hands: PRINCIPLES OF CHILD
scene_heading: DEVELOPMENT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You in school? That's great.
dialog: 
text: She turns DOWN THE SIDEWALK. He continues following.

speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: What school?
dialog: 
dialog: No answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: What school?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Middlesex County Community.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Middlesex? That's kind of a hike.
dialog: Where's your car?
dialog: (no response)
dialog: You taking the bus? Lemme give you
text: a lift.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: That's okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: It's no problem.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Really. I'm parked right by.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Stephanie picks up the pace, trying to lose him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You're walking pretty fast there.
dialog: You running late?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: I could help you with that.
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: Give you a ride.
dialog: 
text: She keeps right on walking.

speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: New Jersey Transit sucks!
dialog: 
dialog: And walking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
text: Left at the second stop sign.

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Yes, ma'am!
dialog: 
text: Randy drives. He slows at the second stop sign, which is at a
text: bigger, FOUR-LANE STREET. He makes the left. They drive for a
text: stretch in awkward silence. Randy seems a little nervous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: You gonna talk?
dialog: 
text: A pause as Randy gathers his words.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: There's something I wanted to tell
dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Okay...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I had a heart attack.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Last week.

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He looks at her earnestly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: I wanna try to fix things.
dialog: 
text: Stephanie sits there in calm silence, processing all of this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: You are such an asshole.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Now you wanna fix things. Now that
dialog: suddenly you're all scared and
dialog: alone from your heart attack.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What? No. It's not like----
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: This is so fuckin' you. You only
dialog: come around when you need something
dialog: from somebody, when they can do
dialog: something for you. Selfish fuck.
dialog: Good. Be alone.
dialog: 
text: She suddenly OPENS HER DOOR as the van is moving. She HOPS
text: OUT. Randy hits the brakes, alarmed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
text: Stephanie stumbles and falls. She gets up. Walks off in the
dialog: direction they came from.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. RAHWAY RECREATION CENTER - GYMNASIUM - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Randy, standing at a folding table in a gym, unzips a duffel

text: high-flying, mid-air Ram Jam photo from the height of his
dialog: '80s glory.
dialog: 
text: He puts them on the table. Looks around the gym.
dialog: 
text: RANDY'S POV: He's at an AUTOGRAPH SHOW that hasn't started
text: yet. Around the perimeter of the gym, TEN FOLDING TABLES are
text: set up. At each one, a BEAT-UP, WORN-OUT OLD WRESTLER is
text: laying out his wares----8x10s, old match tapes, etc.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG (O.S.)
dialog: Didn't think I'd see you here.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG
dialog: Heard you collapsed at the DiFusco
dialog: show. Sounded pretty scary.
dialog: 
text: Randy smiles coyly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Sold the shit outta that one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG
dialog: No way!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I gotta give credit. DiFusco came
dialog: up with the idea. We're setting up
text: an angle for a grudge match.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG
dialog: Wow... Dude, you are good.
dialog: 
text: Randy gives a proud "Hey, what can I say?" shrug.

speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What minivan?
dialog:

speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You see the flyer?
dialog: 
text: Randy looks at him blankly. Brumberg walks over to a nearby
text: table, where there's a stack of BRIGHT-ORANGE FLYERS. (The
text: same flyer can be seen scattered around the room on chairs,
text: the floor, etc.) He grabs one and brings it back over.

speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER
dialog: 
text: The signing is underway. FIVE OR SO FANS mill about the room,

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON RANDY:

speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: Thanks.

speaker_heading: RANDY

text: autographs----just as soon as somebody comes over.

scene_heading: INT. GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER
dialog: 
text: Randy sits at his table, bored. There are NO TAKERS. He looks
text: around the room at the other wrestlers.
dialog: 
text: RANDY'S POV: One is asleep. Another looks borderline
text: homeless. Across from him is a 40-SOMETHING WRESTLER in a
text: WHEELCHAIR. Attached to his calf is a URINE BAG. A feeble
text: stream of urine trickles into the bag.
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
dialog:

text: hair is pulled back in a ponytail. She's also a good three
text: inches shorter out of her stripper heels.
dialog: 
text: They shake hands, a bit awkwardly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: I almost didn't recognize you. You
dialog: look all... clean.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: "Clean"?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Like classy.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Gee, thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Nah, nah, I don't mean that bad. I
dialog: like it.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: It's like in "Grease", where she
dialog: turns into the hot rock `n' roll
text: chick at the end. Except backwards.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Oh-kaay...
dialog: 
text: Randy looks at her sneakers, a far cry from the clear heels
dialog: he's used to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: So, uh... Should I call you Cassidy
dialog: or Pam?
dialog: 
text: She gives the question genuine thought.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: This is awesome...
dialog: (rubs hands together,
speaker_heading: PSYCHED)
dialog: We are gonna find something great!
dialog: 
text: Cassidy is less loose and playful than Randy, much more in
text: business mode. They come to the back where, against the wall,
text: she finds what she's looking for: a bunch of CARDBOARD BOXES
text: bursting with a wildly eclectic assortment of tops, skirts,
text: pants, etc. She starts sifting through.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Do you know her size?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: She's kinda skinny, a little
dialog: shorter than you.
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I'm not sure.

scene_heading: SWEATSHIRT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: What about this?
dialog: 
text: Randy makes a sour face. She tosses it back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT'D)
dialog: So like, what is she? Goth? Punk?
dialog: Hippie?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Preppy? Stoner?
dialog: 
text: Randy ponders the choices.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Not really...
dialog: 
text: Cassidy lets out a good-natured groan of frustration. Randy
text: watches as she continues searching.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, Pam?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY

dialog: 
text: Cassidy looks at him. She can feel his sincere appreciation.

speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: You're welcome.
dialog: 
text: She returns to searching. Sift, sift, sift, sift...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I think she might be a lesbian.
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Cassidy stops sifting. She looks up at him.

speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)

dialog: 
text: Cassidy leads Randy by the arm over to the...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEN'S AREA:

text: a RETRO BOWLING SHIRT. She holds it up to Randy, who makes a
text: scrunched-up face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Ah, maybe she's just a friend.
dialog: 
text: Cassidy puts the bowling shirt back. As she does, something
text: catches Randy's eye.

speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: (POINTING)

speaker_heading: RANDY

speaker_heading: RANDY

speaker_heading: CASSIDY

speaker_heading: RANDY

speaker_heading: CASSIDY

text: Randy looks off at something by his van. An idea hits him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Wait.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Now both our kids got something.
dialog:

speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE AYATOLLAH
dialog: What things?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Y'know, the spots.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE AYATOLLAH
dialog: Ah, we can just wing it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: You don't wanna hash it out?
dialog: 
text: The Ayatollah gives him a dismissive, cavalier wave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE AYATOLLAH
dialog: It'll be fine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: We should have at least a basic
dialog: plan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE AYATOLLAH
dialog: How's this: I'm the heel, you're
text: the face. Done.
dialog: 
text: The Ayatollah chuckles. Randy walks off, highly annoyed.

scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Ready to do this?
dialog: 
text: Through the wall, ARABIC MUSIC starts to play.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE AYATOLLAH
dialog: Believe so.

speaker_heading: CASSIDY

speaker_heading: RANDY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: What about your heart?

speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll be fine.

speaker_heading: CASSIDY

speaker_heading: RANDY

speaker_heading: CASSIDY

speaker_heading: RANDY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Fuck the real world. Nobody gives a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: I quit my job, drove 14 hours

scene_heading: INT. COMMENTATORS' TABLE - CONTINUOUS
dialog:

text: is a VIDEOCAMERA on a tripod.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1
dialog: There he is, folks! Randy The Ram!
dialog: 
text: Randy raises a set of ram's horns high in the air. Fans do

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #2
dialog: History about to be made here at
dialog: the Greenville Civic Auditorium.
dialog: 
text: Randy takes a long lap around the ring, ramming chair after
text: chair. His head gets a little bloody. The fans eat it up.
dialog: 
text: Randy climbs into the ring, where The Ayatollah awaits.
dialog: 
text: The cheers continue. Loving, appreciative, sustained cheers.
text: Randy stands there soaking it in, basking in their love.
dialog: 
text: He grabs the microphone from the ring announcer. He looks
text: around. A hush comes over the crowd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I just got one thing to say to you
dialog: people...
dialog: 
dialog: 111.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Randy looks toward Cassidy, standing over by the entrance
text: curtain. He looks out at the larger crowd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
text: LOUD CHEERS. Randy takes a contemplative pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You take your lumps and bruises in
dialog: this game. But you know what? It's
dialog: all worth it. Because of you guys.
dialog: Your cheers keep me young. They
dialog: make me feel alive.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: In 1982, the year I wrestled my
dialog: first professional match, I was six-
dialog: foot-one. By 1993, I was five-foot-
dialog: eleven. Three back surgeries in 11
dialog: years knocked two full inches off
dialog: my height. I may be down to five-
text: eleven, but performing in front of
dialog: you people has always made me feel
dialog: 10 feet tall. And that's the way
dialog: it's always gonna be.
dialog: 
text: Randy looks toward Cassidy, who's standing over by the
text: entrance curtain. Their eyes meet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Forever.
dialog: 
text: Randy lowers the mike, finished. The fans CHEER WILDLY, the
text: loudest cheers yet.
dialog: 
text: As Randy nods appreciatively at the crowd, The Ayatollah
text: SNEAKS UP BEHIND HIM with a folding chair.
dialog: 
text: Fans shout, trying to warn Randy about the sneak attack, but
text: he doesn't hear them.
dialog: 
text: The Ayatollah SMASHES HIM OVER THE HEAD. Randy goes down. The
text: match is on.
dialog: 
text: The Ayatollah picks up Randy and throws him into the ropes.
text: Randy bounces back toward The Ayatollah, who lazily puts up
text: an elbow for Randy to run into. Randy practically has to lead
text: his face to the elbow. Hitting the mat, Randy pops back up
text: and grabs The Ayatollah.
dialog: 
text: The Ayatollah, phoning it in, throws Randy into the ropes
text: again. This time, The Ayatollah has a raised knee waiting for
text: Randy. Randy runs into it, doing his best to sell the shot.
dialog: 
dialog: 112.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: (under breath)
dialog: You're workin' pretty light here.
dialog: 
text: Randy gets up and grabs The Ayatollah's arms. With a nifty
text: move, he flips The Ayatollah over his shoulder, SLAMMING HIM
text: HARD into the mat. Randy falls on top of him, pressing The
text: Ayatollah's face into the canvas.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE AYATOLLAH
dialog: Jesus. Relax.
dialog: 
text: Randy flips The Ayatollah over onto his back, pinning his
text: shoulder blades. The REF swoops in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: One!... Two!...
dialog: 
text: The Ayatollah KICKS OUT. They both get up. The Ayatollah jogs
text: toward the ropes. He bounces off. Randy braces for something
text: good, but all he gets is a feeble CHEST SLAP. Randy grabs The
text: Ayatollah and puts him in a headlock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Anytime you wanna join in.
dialog: 
text: Randy scoops up The Ayatollah and drops him over his knee
text: with a BACKBREAKER. The Ayatollah grimaces in pain as he hits
text: the mat. Before he has a chance to get up, Randy hits him
text: with a FLYING ELBOW DROP.
dialog: 
text: The Ayatollah gets up, pissed at the rough treatment.
dialog: 
text: Randy goes for a dropkick, but The Ayatollah catches his
text: ankles in midair. He JERKS UPWARD on Randy's legs, sending
text: Randy CRASHING TO THE MAT on the back of his head. The
text: Ayatollah falls on Randy's throat with his knee. He grinds
text: Randy's face into the canvas as Randy did to him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ENTRANCE CURTAIN:

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Much.
dialog: 
dialog: 113.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The Ayatollah picks up Randy and throws him into the ropes.
text: Randy bounces back, flinging himself sideways at The
text: Ayatollah. The Ayatollah catches him in mid-air, cradling him
text: in his arms. The Ayatollah drops Randy onto his bent knee.
text: Randy falls to the canvas, clutching his side. The Ayatollah
text: falls on top of him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE AYATOLLAH
dialog: Forgot how much fun this is.
dialog: 
text: The ref swoops in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: One!... Two!...
dialog: 
text: Randy KICKS OUT. As Randy "recovers", The Ayatollah jumps out
text: of the ring and grabs a folding chair.
dialog: 
text: The Ayatollah, climbing back in, props up the chair in a
text: corner. He picks Randy off the mat and flings him at the
text: chair. Randy VAULTS OVER IT, sailing through the ropes and
text: OUT OF THE RING. He hits the concrete floor, CRASHING against
text: the metal barricade.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ENTRANCE CURTAIN:
dialog: 
text: Cassidy winces. She starts to tear up a little.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE RING:
dialog: 
text: The Ayatollah hops out of the ring. He stands over Randy,
text: kicking him repeatedly. He grabs his Iranian flag, waving it
text: tauntingly at the crowd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FAN #1 (O.S.) FAN #2 (O.S.)
dialog: Camelfucker! Fat piece of shit!
dialog: 
text: The Ayatollah looks down at Randy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE AYATOLLAH
dialog: Pathetic.

dialog: Pitiful godless infidel!
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE CROWD:
dialog: 
text: Boos rain down on The Ayatollah.

dialog: 114.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: JUST OUTSIDE RING:
dialog: 
text: The Ayatollah takes the butt end of his flag pole and JABS IT
text: into Randy's side. Randy grimaces in pain.
dialog: 
text: The Ayatollah unties the flag from its pole and WRAPS IT
text: around Randy's neck. He JERKS UPWARD on the flag, lifting
text: Randy off the mat by his neck. Randy THRASHES AROUND,
dialog: fighting for breath.
dialog: 
text: The Ayatollah releases Randy from the choke. Randy crumples
text: to the ground, gasping for air. The Ayatollah picks up Randy
text: by his hair and flings him back in the ring.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE RING:
dialog: 
text: The Ayatollah grabs the folding chair from the corner. He
text: SMASHES RANDY OVER THE HEAD with it. Randy's forehead is
text: BLEEDING. The Ayatollah hits him again, taking dead aim at
text: the forehead cut. MORE BLOOD. Randy crumples to the mat.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ENTRANCE CURTAIN:
dialog: 
text: Cassidy, alarmed, instinctively goes halfway toward the ring.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Randy!
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE RING:
dialog: 
text: The Ayatollah scoops up Randy and BODYSLAMS him. He falls on

dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE AYATOLLAH
dialog: (under breath)
dialog: Wanna take it home?
dialog: 
text: Randy's eyes drift in Cassidy's direction.
dialog: 
text: RANDY'S POV: Cassidy is CRYING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Stop it! Stop it, Randy!
dialog: 
text: Randy turns back to The Ayatollah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: It's time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE AYATOLLAH
dialog: All you, bro. Lead the way.
dialog: 
dialog: 115.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Randy flips The Ayatollah over. Randy struggles to his feet.
text: He picks up The Ayatollah and levels him with a dropkick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.)
dialog: Dropkick!
dialog: (a second one)
dialog: And another!
dialog: (a third one)
dialog: And another!
dialog: 
text: His heart is POUNDING. The fans sense it's near the end. A
dialog: chant rises:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CROWD (O.S.)
dialog: Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
dialog: 
text: Randy falls on top of The Ayatollah, putting him in a rest-

speaker_heading: CROWD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #2 (O.S.)
dialog: Just listen to this crowd!

speaker_heading: THE AYATOLLAH
dialog: If you ain't up to it...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CROWD (O.S.)
dialog: Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
dialog: 
text: Randy looks around at the crowd, chanting, hungry for the Ram
text: Jam. He looks The Ayatollah in the eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Let's do this.
dialog: 
text: Randy gets up. He lifts The Ayatollah off the mat, locking up
text: with him chest-to-chest. He arches his back and thrusts his
text: hips. The Ayatollah's feet fly off the canvas as his legs
text: whip into the air. His body does a COMPLETE FLIP as he slams
text: onto his back. Randy stays with him, his body contorting in a
text: tight BACK FLIP as he CRASHES DOWN on top of him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.)
dialog: Lateral drop!
dialog: 
text: Randy gets up. His HEART LURCHES.
dialog: 
text: He lowers himself back down to his knees. Puts his hand to

dialog: 
text: RANDY'S POV: He catches a glimpse of Cassidy disappearing
