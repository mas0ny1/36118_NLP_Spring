scene_heading: ON AN OLD STONE LIGHTHOUSE
text: Standing sentry on a rocky bluff, high above the POUNDING
speaker_heading: SURF.
text: And as we GET CLOSER, we see A MAN STANDING IN THE WINDOW,
text: staring out at the vast sea with troubled eyes.
scene_heading: INT. THE LIGHTHOUSE - DAY
text: Inside the small, glass-enclosed room, the MAN sets a pen and
text: ink on a writing table. He opens a leather-bound book, the
dialog: cover of which reads:
scene_heading: JOURNAL OF PATRICK MALONE
text: He inks the pen and begins to write.
speaker_heading: MALONE (V.O.)
dialog: April 21st, 1905. The die is
dialog: cast...
scene_heading: ON A STRETCH OF WHITE SAND BEACH - NIGHT
text: TWELVE MEN stand in a line. Some hold kerosene lamps. All
text: are dressed in black, like their mood.
speaker_heading: MALONE (V.O.)
dialog: A vote has been taken and our
dialog: decision made. I have volunteered
dialog: to carry-out the deed, much to the
dialog: dismay of my Erica and the
dialog: children...
text: MALONE moves down the line of men. The last of them hands
text: him an official-looking PARCHMENT, rolled and tied with a
text: ribbon. Without ceremony, MALONE turns and walks towards
speaker_heading: THE OCEAN ~ NIGHT
text: Where two OARSMEN shove a longboat into the surf. MALONE
text: gets in, and we’1l notice some cargo, lashed-down under a
dialog: tarp.
speaker_heading: MALONE (V.O.)
dialog: My mind races with the thought of
dialog: what I must now do. Of what must
dialog: be done.
text: And as they put out to sea, MALONE looks back to find...
text: ELEVEN MEN standing on the beach. Silent. Watching.
speaker_heading: ON MALONE
text: STEADY ROWING is the only SOUND we hear. MALONE sits rapt in
text: thought, when something up ahead catches his eye. The
dialog: OARSMEN stop rowing and we
text: REVERSE ANGLE to reveal an advancing FOG BANK, not 50 feet
text: ahead. The OARSMEN look to MALONE.
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: Afraid of a little fog, are we?
text: He nods at them to press on. They pick up the rhythm again,
text: disappearing into the swirling mist...
scene_heading: INT. A SHIP’S HOLD ~- NIGHT
text: MOVING through the belly of a clipper ship, a labyrinth of
text: light and shadow, lit by hanging lanterns swaying from the
dialog: rafters.
text: There are PEOPLE in here, scurrying about, performing what
dialog: we'd guess are their assigned duties. They are oddly dressed
text: in cloak and shroud, and we cannot see their faces.
text: A MAN, dressed like the others, descends the creaky stairs
dialog: into the hold. His name is BLAKE, and we can tell by the
dialog: deference paid him, he is their leader.
text: He walks amongst them with his lantern, offering a gentle pat
text: on the back or a quiet nod...
scene_heading: INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
text: BLAKE enters the room. A WOMAN sits at a dressing table,
text: facing away from us, brushing her long, dark hair. We notice
text: her HAIRBRUSH -- made of pure gold, engraved with INTRICATE
dialog: PATTERNS...
text: On hearing BLAKE enter, she pulls her shroud up over her head
text: and turns. We see her only in profile, and from this angle,
text: she is unmistakably beautiful.
text: BLAKE walks over to her. She looks up at him, uneasy.
text: Reassuringly, he reaches out to touch her face.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Don't worry. This is a new
dialog: beginning. For all of us.
text: When he pulls his hand away, there is milky-white MAGGOT
text: wriggling on his fingertip. This doesn’t seem to bother him
text: in the least, as he flicks the thing away.
text: Then he leans in to kiss her and his lantern lights the half
dialog: of her face we couldn’t quite see...
text: ...covered in pus-filled boils and sagging, gangrenous
text: tissue. But her eyes are alive and filled with love for this
dialog: man.
dialog: They kiss.
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN WATER - NIGHT
dialog: It's as if we’ve been swallowed whole by a thick and
text: undulating fog, creeping in on us from every side. Again, we
text: PICK UP the ROWING SOUND...
dialog: ...which seems to be coming at us, then we could swear it’s
text: moving away. We’re becoming more and more disoriented now.
text: Up is down and down is up and soon the SOUND seems to wrap
dialog: around us like the fog itself, when...
text: THE BOW OF THE LONGBOAT
text: PIERCES the mist. There’s a DULL THUD as the LONGBOAT bangs
text: into something not yet seen. The OARSMEN stow their oars as
text: MALONE raises his lantern and WE SEE WHAT THEY'VE HIT...
text: THE BATTERED HULL OF THE CLIPPER SHIP.
text: Light spills from tiny portholes belowdecks, illuminating the
dialog: name painted on her bow:
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH DANE
text: MALONE draws a pistol. The OARSMEN look surprised. MALONE
text: reaches out, RAPPING on the Dane’s hull with the butt:
text: KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!
scene_heading: INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON a pair of embracing hands. WIDEN to reveal they
text: belong to BLAKE and the WOMAN. He gets up to leave, but she
dialog: doesn’t want to let go.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: It’s going to be fine. I promise
dialog: you with all my heart.
scene_heading: EXT. THE LONGBOAT - NIGHT
text: MALONE sits in the LONGBOAT, pistol stowed, bobbing alongside
text: the DANE, when A CLOAKED SHAPE leans out over the gunwale --
speaker_heading: BLAKE.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Williams?
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: (looking away)
dialog: Yes.
text: BLAKE disappears momentarily. A leather SATCHEL comes flying
text: over the rail, practically hits MALONE in the head.
text: MALONE takes out the PARCHMENT we saw earlier, places it in
text: the satchel, flings it back up on deck.
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: Leave the gold on deck and get your
dialog: people down below. I/’11 not ~
dialog: subject myself to your wretched...
text: A rope-ladder is dropped over the side. The OARSMEN rise.
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: Wait.
text: MALONE takes out a knife, slashes open the tarp, revealing
text: the cargo: three large cans marked KEROSENE. The shocked
dialog: OARSMEN look to MALONE -- nobody said anything about this... ~
scene_heading: EXT. ELIZABETH DANE’S DECK ~- NIGHT
text: First one up, MALONE lifts his lantern. The deck appears
text: empty, save for a rusted metal CHEST. MALONE goes over and
text: flips open the lid to find it brimming with GOLD COINS.
text: He dips into it, letting the cold wealth run through his
text: fingers, startled when HE HEARS SOMETHING...
text: MALONE holds up his lantern, sees BLAKE’s cloaked shape
text: standing at the bow.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: You’re not Williams.
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: No. But I represent his interests.
dialog: His, and the rest of the town
dialog: fathers.
text: MALONE'S hand slips behind his back, producing the PISTOL.
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: We want the rest of your gold,
dialog: Blake. All of it.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: ’ The deal we made was more than
dialog: fair. Take what's there, and go.
text: MALONE nods to the OARSMEN who crack open the KEROSENE, begin
text: dousing the Dane’s wooden deck.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: In God's name, what kind of people
dialog: are you?
text: MALONE lights a wooden match with his thumbnail, holds it
text: over the deck -- something for BLAKE to think about.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Alright! I’11 need to go below.
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: (blows out the match)
dialog: Go on. But if you try anything,
dialog: the ship burns.
text: MALONE turns the pistol on his own men.
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: Go with him. ~
speaker_heading: OARSMAN #1
dialog: Please... Don’t make us go down
dialog: there... With them.
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: Down there...
dialog: {cocks the pistol)
dialog: Or up here.
scene_heading: INT. BELOWDECKS - DANE - NIGHT
text: We descend into the ship's hold, crowded with BLAKE'S people.
text: The OARSMEN follow BLAKE, covering their noses at the
dialog: unbearable stench.
scene_heading: EXT. ELIZABETH DANE’S DECK - LATER ~- NIGHT
text: MALONE stands waiting impatiently at the hatchway. One of
text: the OARSMEN starts to come up the ladder. MALONE puts his
text: boot on the man’s shoulder. .
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: Gold first. Then you.
text: A heavy CHEST is thrust upwards. MALONE grabs it by the
dialog: handle...
text: The OARSMAN starts back up the ladder, when MALONE kicks him
text: in the teeth, sending him tumbling back down.
text: MALONE kicks over a full can of KEROSENE, which goes spilling
text: into the hold. BLAKE looks out from the shadow of his cloak,
text: EYES dark and malevolent, fixing MALONE with a cursed stare.
text: MALONE recoils at this, dropping his lantern into the hold.
text: We hear a WHUMPH as the kerosene ignites. And then we hear
text: the SCREAMS as MALONE slams the hatch shut. He shoots the
text: bolt across and BASHES THE HASP, rendering it useless,
dialog: sealing them in.
dialog: Forever.
text: In a hurry now, MALONE slides the first chest to the edge of
dialog: the deck, but it’s heavy and he’1]l never get it down the rope
text: ladder by himself. In a greedy panic, he spots the Dane’s
text: lifeboat, suspended by ropes at deck level.
scene_heading: THE LIFEBOAT - A MINUTE LATER
text: MALONE has loaded both chests into the lifeboat. SMOKE
text: billows up through the planks of the Dane’s deck. People are
text: SCREAMING down below, POUNDING for a way out.
text: MALONE gets into the lifeboat, takes his knife and SLASHES’
text: the ropes holding him aloft...
text: But one of the ropes SNAGS in a pulley, dropping the bow
text: sharply. The weight of the chests sends them SMASHING
text: through the first two bench seats, threatening to crash right
text: through the bow and into the water.
text: MALONE LUNGES FOR THEM as the lids POP OPEN, sending hundreds
dialog: of gold coins to the bottom of the sea, when
text: The hung rope FREES ITSELF. The life boat falls, smacking
text: down into the water. Relieved, MALONE turns his back on the
text: smoldering ship, picking gold coins off the floor of the
dialog: lifeboat, when
text: A HAND SMASHES THROUGH ONE OF THE PORTHOLES, burnt flesh
text: dripping from the bone, locking MALONE in a death grip!
text: Out of his wits, MALONE struggles to break free, HACKING at
text: the hideous hand, bashing at it with an oar as the SCREAMS
text: from inside the DANE build into an unholy frenzy.
text: With a last, bone-crunching WHACK, the hand withers and
text: MALONE is free. He rows away from the doomed ship using all
text: his strength, gliding past. a barnacle-encrusted BUOY...
text: And WE HOLD ON THE BUOY, bobbing in the ocean, as a hundred
dialog: years of time and tide pass before our eyes...
text: A SLEEK WHITE CHARTER BOAT powers past the BUOY, splashing it
text: with a glassy sheet of water.
text: NICK CASTLE, 20, is on the FLYBRIDGE, at the helm of this 42-
text: foot luxo SPORT-FISHING BOAT. His hair is blown back by the
text: wind, emphasizing his raw good looks. His SWEATSHIRT tells
text: us who he’s working for: ANTONIO BAY SPORT-FISHING CHARTERS.
text: WORKING THE REAR OF THE BOAT is BRETT SPOONER, 20, Nick's
dialog: best friend and fellow employee. Simple, honest, made of
dialog: good stuff, SPOONER’S got a mop of surfer’s hair, and hasn’t
dialog: yet lost all his baby fat...
text: SPOONER uses a mean-looking BONING KNIFE to splay open a
text: yellowfin, while TWO SUNBURNED FISHERMEN drink beer after a
text: day on the water. SPOONER offers up a slice of raw tuna.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Sushi?
text: The FISHERMEN decline, so SPOONER happily sucks it down, and
dialog: as the boat breezes by us, we'll notice the name painted her
dialog: stern:
speaker_heading: SEAGRASS.
scene_heading: EXT. ANTONIO BAY - HARBOR - SUNSET
text: As the SEAGRASS glides-in under the harbor lights, NICK
text: begins STRIPPING down to his boxers...
scene_heading: EXT. THE SEAGRASS - MARINA - DUSK
text: NICK expertly parks the boat in its slip. He shuts down the
text: engines, grabs his clothes and slides down the ladder onto
text: the deck, where the FISHERMEN are gathering their gear.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (in a hurry)
dialog: Thanks for your business, guys.
dialog: See you next year. Hustle it up,
dialog: would you, Spooner?
text: SPOONER pulls two big fish from the FREEZER in the hold.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Dude. Nice underpants.
scene_heading: INT. CHARTER BOAT - LATER - DUSK
text: SPOONER enters the cabin, looking for NICK.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Yo, Nick!
speaker_heading: NICK (0.8.)
dialog: In here.
scene_heading: INT. THE HEAD - DUSK
text: NICK stands shirtless, lean and muscled, hair wet from a
text: shower. He buttons his jeans, straps on his watch, checks
dialog: the time -- he’s way late.
text: SPOONER dances into the doorway, stands beside NICK in the
text: mirror. He pulls his shirt up over his considerable belly.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Look -- twins.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Dream on.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Not you an’ me. These.
text: SPOONER starts tracing little circles around his nipples.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Don’t bug me, Spooner. I’m late.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: For what? We still got decks to
dialog: swab.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Elizabeth's coming home tonight.
dialog: I’m picking her up at the train.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Wait, wait, wait. I remember you
dialog: telling me this...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: So you do have one brain cell
dialog: left...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: ...to which I think’I responded,
dialog: her mom will slice off your teeny
dialog: weeny little balls, and have
dialog: herself a Nick's special.
speaker_heading: (of£ NICK’S look)
dialog: Testicle on rye.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Screw her mom.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I tried. I think my Soloflex abs
dialog: were too much for her.
text: SPOONER picks up NICK’S brush, starts brushing his own mop.
dialog: It’s hopeless.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I thought Elizabeth and her mom
dialog: ~ were in some big hatefest.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don't know. Just back me up on
dialog: this, alright? Hose down the boat
dialog: and gas it up for tomorrow. That
dialog: way, we won't get fired.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: We?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah, we. Like, we need to keep
dialog: our jobs so we can buy our own boat
dialog: some day...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Oh, that we.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (out the door)
dialog: See you at the beach party.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: By the way, how do you plan to
dialog: handle the thing between you and
dialog: Stevie?
text: NICK stops, turns, puts his hands on SPOONER’S shoulders.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Spooner. That was a one-time
dialog: thing. And I regret it.
dialog: (checks his watch again)
dialog: I am so late.
scene_heading: EXT. ANTONIO BAY - MAIN STREET - DUSK
text: NICK drives down MAIN STREET of the quaint little coastal
text: town, past Jimmy's Chowder Shack and the Rainy Ale Tavern...
dialog: 10.
text: He passes the Tasty-Freeze and Tisdale's Hardware, and then
text: we notice the BLEACHERS erected on either side of the street,
dialog: and the BANNERS proclaiming Antonio Bay’s 100th birthday
dialog: celebration.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: As a low-hanging ground fog rounds a corner and begins
text: spreading towards us. It flows over sidewalks and into the
dialog: streets...
scene_heading: INT. NICK'S PICKUP TRUCK - DUSK
text: NICK drives the road out of town, a can of Bud between his
text: legs, about to take a swig, when he notices
text: A SHERIFF’S PICKUP TRUCK parked on a berm beside the road.
text: The door is open and we can see the SHERIFF walking up to
text: A BIG FOR SALE sign, planted in the ground. WORDING on the
dialog: sign: 50 acres, prime development site, artist's rendering
dialog: of some cookie-cutter condos, phone number, etc.
text: NICK slows, watching as the SHERIFF hammers something onto
text: the sign. He yells out the window.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What‘re you doin to that sign?
speaker_heading: ON THE SHERIFF
text: He looks over and smirks. The brass bar opposite his badge
dialog: reads MALONE. In his 40’s, he was handsome once, but TOM
text: MALONE now has the look of a man who has lost his edge...
text: He takes a step towards NICK’S truck, and we can see the
dialog: plaque he just nailedon: SOLD
speaker_heading: . SHERIFF :
dialog: What’re you doin way out here,
dialog: Hotrod?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Just goin for a ride. Somebody
dialog: finally buy that land, or what?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Don’t you worry about it. Let’s
dialog: just say I won't be Sheriff of this
dialog: dump much longer...
text: NICK eyes him, trying to put it together...
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: ‘What the hell’re you lookin at?
dialog: (then)
dialog: I don’t smell beer in that truck,
dialog: do I?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No sir. Not unless it’s Root Beer.
speaker_heading: ; TOM MALONE
dialog: That‘s good. Now you go on and
dialog: enjoy your ride. And be sure and
dialog: obey those little white signs with
dialog: the numbers in ‘em.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yes sir.
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Prick.
text: NICK smiles and drives off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. NICK'S PICKUP TRUCK - LATER
text: NICK swigs his beer now, scenery whipping by outside the
text: window. He shifts the truck into high gear.
speaker_heading: NICK'S POV - NIGHT
text: The headlights illuminate the winding road, cutting through
text: dense green forest. Pockets of MIST swirl and drift across
dialog: the road...
text: From the RADIO in the dash, we HEAR a sensual female voice:
speaker_heading: STEVIE (V.0O.)
dialog: It’s nine-thirty on a beautiful
dialog: Friday night in Antonio Bay. I’m
dialog: Stevie Wayne, and I’m gonna go a
dialog: little ‘old school’ on you tonight.
dialog: Here's a track from [Ramones, etc.]

dialog: your alternative to the modern
dialog: music establishment.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: ...the voice that launched a
dialog: thousand ships.
dialog: 12.
text: MUSIC comes over the radio. NICK reaches down to turn up the
dialog: volume, and when he glances up:
text: NICK'S POV - ENTERING A POCKET OF MIST
dialog: It's a white-out. WHEN SUDDENLY,
text: A GIRL APPEARS IN THE MIST
text: NICK SWERVES and hits the brakes, watching her in the
text: headlights as he passes by. She’s hitch-hiking, a suitcase
text: at her feet. And she’s hot.
text: He checks his watch again, looks back at the GIRL as if torn.
text: And now she’s eyeing him, too...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Shit.
text: He puts on the brakes, makes a’u-turn and goes back for her.
text: He pulls over, rolls down his window.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: "Hi.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Hi, yourself.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Don’t you know hitch-hiking is
dialog: dangerous?
text: The GIRL just shrugs.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You want a ride?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: But you’re headed in the wrong
dialog: direction.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (with a big smile)
dialog: Not anymore. .
text: The GIRL picks up her suitcase, sashays around the front of
text: the truck and opens the door. She is barely 20, beautiful,
text: and strong -- a dream of a girl-next-door.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: You're not a freak or anything.
dialog: Are you?
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah. Actually I am.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (smiling)
text: She gets in and closes the door. She looks straight ahead,
dialog: but they aren’t going anywhere.
text: She finally turns to NICK, who looks at her with gleaming,
text: almost mesmeric eyes. She starts to say something, when he
text: reaches out, tracing the line of her jaw, her lips.
text: Suddenly she’s all over him and he just rolls with it. Soon
text: they are reaching inside each other’s clothes, popping
text: buttons, sliding down in the seat...
speaker_heading: ~ GIRL
dialog: God, I missed you...
dialog: (stops kissing him)
dialog: And Nick?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yes, Elizabeth...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Next time, don’t be late.
text: They go at it again, quickly disappearing from view.
text: CAMERA SLOWLY BOOMS UP from the truck, RISING through the
text: trees, to reveal the STARS, the craggy COASTLINE, and a
text: familiar-looking LIGHTHOUSE out on the point.
text: Its BEACON strakes the horizon, fingering the darkness,
dialog: ~ moving on, as we HEAR...
speaker_heading: STEVIE (0.S.)
text: It's a little after 10 o’clock and
dialog: I'm Stevie Wayne, your very own
dialog: beacon in-the-night...
text: CAMERA races at the LIGHTHOUSE with lightning speed, BLINDED
text: for an instant by the LIGHT on top as it whooshes by again,
dialog: and now we're
text: INSIDE that same small, glass-enclosed room at the top of the
text: eld stone lighthouse -- now the broadcast booth of KAB.
text: CLOSE ON STEVIE WAYNE -- 20’s, funkily sensual, a young Joan
text: Jett type. Her hair is. up and she wears a cut-up Ramones T-

dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: I'm high tonight in the KAB
dialog: lighthouse on Spivey Point...

dialog: Dammit !
text: PULL BACK to find STEVIE sitting at her console, one foot on
text: the board, painting her toe nails with deep purple polish.
text: She grabs a kleenex to dab a smudge...
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: .-you can say that on the radio
dialog: nowadays. Anyway, by now you know
text: the drill. The big shin-dig is
dialog: planned for Sunday, with a surprise
dialog: performance by a local band you

dialog: flashing lights.
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: I don’t mean literally, you morons.
scene_heading: EXT. MERRY MARKET - MAIN STREET - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. MERRY MARKET - ANTONIO BAY - NIGHT
text: A BAG BOY picks up his broom, cranks the volume on his radio,
text: as the song Stevie just cued plays in the b.g. He goes to

dialog: » him stop...
text: He looks around the store, eying the creepy old curios
text: dangling from the ceiling, hanging on walls, etc. --
text: Shaking it off, he starts to sweep, when the lights inside
text: the soda cases begin to flicker and buzz.
text: BOTTLES start CLINKING together on the shelves. The whole

speaker_heading: BAG BOY
dialog: Shit! It’s the big one!
text: He drops his broom and races for the exit, when he sees:
text: THE AUTOMATIC DOORS slamming open and shut all on their own,
text: fast, and erratic -- lethal even -- and when he turns, he
text: sees something that freezes him in his tracks:
text: MICROWAVE POPCORN starts to POP. Still in the packages.
text: Right on the shelf.
scene_heading: EXT. ANTONIO BAY SAVINGS AND LOAN - NIGHT
text: The screen on the ATM begins BUZZING with a weird, sepia-tone
text: FLUX. It looks like there’s an IMAGE trying to form
text: somewhere in there, but then we hear the KA-CHUNK of the cash
text: dispenser, as TWENTIES begin spitting from the machine.
text: An OLD LADY passes by, her eyeglasses on a decorative chain
text: around her neck. At first she just keeps walking, but when
text: she realizes no one is watching, she goes back, scooping the
text: bills into her purse.
scene_heading: EXT. SERVICE STATION - NIGHT
text: Closed. Dark. The AIR HOSE DING-DING’s. But there’s nobody

scene_heading: EXT. REAL ESTATE OFFICE - NIGHT

dialog: spells out a word: DANE
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
text: A burned-out BEACHCOMBER in a tattered navy pea coat shuffles
text: up the beach. In one hand is a METAL DETECTOR, which he
text: waves over the sand. In the other is a FLASK.
text: He takes a drink and we notice his thrashed sea captain's cap

dialog: 16.
scene_heading: EXT. A ROCKY COVE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Stevie’s extremely cool.
text: SEAN saunters up with fresh beers, shoots NICK a look he
text: pretends not to see. He hands ELIZABETH a beer.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah, Elizabeth. Welcome back to
dialog: dullsville. Hey Nickster. Let's
dialog: go water the sand...
text: NICK and SEAN get up, move off into the darkness. EMILY
text: scoots closer to ELIZABETH.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Something
speaker_heading: nor EMILY
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: SOMETHING
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: So. What’s it like?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: College guys. The parties. The
dialog: dorms. You know...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: It’s fine, I guess.
speaker_heading: . EMILY
dialog: Fine? I thought it'd be like,
dialog: exotic. And glamorous.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Well, let’s see. I’ve gained five
dialog: pounds from the dorm food. There’s
dialog: a big, hairy Russian chick on my
dialog: floor that stares at me in the
dialog: showers, and two of my professors
dialog: have hit on me, only one of whom is
dialog: male.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (dreamy)
dialog: That's awesome. Sure beats Antonio

text: smiles a sad little smile, suddenly looks away...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Did you hear that?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I dunno, I thought I... Nevermind.
text: sweeps behind ELIZABETH in a blur, but neither she
dialog: sees it.
text: shrugs if off, POPS open her beer, when
text: COMES HURTLING out of the darkness landing SMACK IN
text: EMILY’S LAP -- viscera and mandibles and shell -- like that
text: skittering ALIEN on the guy’s face in the movie...
speaker_heading: EMILY and
dialog: it’s just
text: ELIZABETH JUMP UP SCREAMING, until they realize
text: a DEAD SPINY LOBSTER upside-down in the sand.
dialog: 18.
text: NICK and SEAN run up laughing, high-fiving each other.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Hardy-har, children.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: That's so not cool!
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You shoulda seen your faces.
text: Suddenly, A PALE WHITE FACE appears in the darkness behind

speaker_heading: FACE
dialog: Boo!
dialog: The whole group JUMPS! It’s the BEACHCOMBER.
speaker_heading: NICK ©
dialog: Jesus, Machen! What the hell do
dialog: you want?
text: MACHEN looks around, sizing up the partiers with lusty eyes.
speaker_heading: MACHEN
dialog: I'll take a Bud if you got it.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Hey, Machen. I got yer beer.
dialog: Go fetch.
text: SEAN fakes like he’s gonna throw the can, when ELIZABETH
text: takes it, hands it politely to MACHEN.
speaker_heading: MACHEN
dialog: Thank you..
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You're welcome.
text: MACHEN guzzles some beer which runs down his chin, while NICK
text: eyeballs the taped-together metal detector.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You been up and down the beach with
dialog: that thing every day since I can
dialog: remember. What the hell’re you
dialog: looking for?
text: MACHEN reaches into his pocket, pulls out a gleaming GOLD
dialog: COIN, exactly like the ones we saw in the opening.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: MACHEN
dialog: More of these...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: MACHEN
dialog: You sure you wanna know?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What? Are we gonna get a curse or
dialog: something? | Oooocoochhhh.
text: They all laugh, but not MACHEN.
speaker_heading: MACHEN
dialog: It's the coin of greed. The coin
dialog: of lust. The coin of doom.
text: The PARTIERS look at each other.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You're freaky-deaky, old man.
text: MACHEN checks his watch.
speaker_heading: MACHEN
dialog: Five minutes till midnight.
dialog: Not much time left...
text: MACHEN turns towards the fire, staring into it.
speaker_heading: MACHEN
dialog: In five minutes, it’11 be the
dialog: twenty-first of April.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: So?
text: MACHEN puts the coin on his tongue, the takes a swig of beer
dialog: SWALLOWS IT!
speaker_heading: MACHEN
dialog: They’11 get nothin’ from me.
text: Now MACHEN just stares, transe-like, into the crackling fire.
text: There is a hushed silence as the PARTIERS just stare at the
text: BEACHCOMBER. Only the HISS of the flames and then...
text: THE SOUND OF AN ENGINE blasts open the silence as
text: SPOONER DRIVES THE SEAGRASS RIGHT UP ONTO THE BEACH!
dialog: 20.
text: He jumps off onto the sand, obviously drunk. He’s got a
text: camcorder in his hand, taping two BEAUTIFUL BLONDES in
text: sweatshirts and bikini bottoms...
text: And as they come off the boat, we realize one of the girls, a
text: BRUNETTE, is actually wearing a blonde wig, which is starting
dialog: to fall off her head.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: (videotaping)
dialog: Ladies. We have arrived.

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: They’re not?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What the hell are you doing,
dialog: Spooner!
text: SPOONER turns the camera on NICK.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: This is Nick Castle. As you can
dialog: see, Nick’s a bit pisssed off right
dialog: now. Let’s find out why...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Shut that thing off, shithead.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: (still taping)
dialog: Wait a minute. Up there on the
dialog: beach! Is that a... Yes. There's

text: women, cavorting around half-naked,
dialog: polluting their bodies and minds.
dialog: God, that sounds like fun. Let’s
dialog: investigate!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Give me the keys, Spooner.
text: SPOONER strolls past him with the TWINS in tow.

speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Relax, Nick. I left em on the

scene_heading: EXT. SEAGRASS - NIGHT
text: NICK climbs onto the flybridge. SEAN, ELIZABETH and EMILY
dialog: walk down to the boat.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Want some help?
text: NICK reaches in his pocket, tosses ELIZABETH his truck keys.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Take my truck to your mom’s. I‘1l
dialog: come get it in the morning. I’ve

dialog: marina.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You never did.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Look, Nick. You guys only got a

dialog: Elizabeth home. I/11 get Spooner
text: and the boat back to the marina.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No, the boat’s my responsibility.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Dude, I can handle my dad’s 42-foot

speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: I’m listening.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I got something on my doppler a

speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: Sounds kinky.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Looks like a fog bank about twenty

text: STEVIE opens a little ACCESS WINDOW in the glass, taps a
text: GAUGE outside the lighthouse...
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: Then my gauges must be wrong,
dialog: ‘cause I show a wind blowing due
dialog: East. What kind of fog moves

speaker_heading: DAN

speaker_heading: STEVIE

speaker_heading: DAN

speaker_heading: STEVIE (cont'd)

scene_heading: THROUGH THE CAMCORDER VIEWFINDER

speaker_heading: SPOONER,
dialog: There’s no fog out there!
text: Back on the flybridge, SEAN continues looking anyway -- until
text: the ENGINE starts to sputter. He checks the controls, eyes
dialog: going to the fuel gauge...
speaker_heading: EMPTY.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Shit! Spooner! We’re outta gas.
speaker_heading: SPOONER,
dialog: Dude. That sucks.

speaker_heading: FATHER MALONE

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: FATHER MALONE

speaker_heading: ON DECK
text: SPOONER is mixing cocktails, when the STATIC begins blocking
text: out the signal from KAB.
text: He goes over to mess with the stereo, when something OFF
text: CAMERA grabs his attention. He puts the camcorder down (it
text: is still running), goes over to the rail.
text: A PULSING GLOW of bone-colored light, reflected on his face.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I think there’s a friggin’ fog bank
dialog: out there...
scene_heading: INT. STEERING HOUSE
text: SEAN turns, glances out the window. The unearthly light
text: PULSATES on his FACE.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What the hell is that?
scene_heading: EXT. THE FOG - NIGHT
text: An eerie WHITE WALL is almost upon them, lit from within by
text: some strange phosphorescent light. Soon, it blots out the
text: entire horizon. Glowing. Throbbing. Swirling.
scene_heading: EXT. SEAGRASS - NIGHT
text: SPOONER backs away from the rail as THE FOG begins drifting
text: into frame, flowing and shifting, enveloping the SEAGRASS.
text: We begin to HEAR A HOLLOW RUSHING SOUND, like BREATHING,
text: ragged and phlegmy. SPOONER looks around, disoriented.
speaker_heading: SEAN (0.S.)
dialog: Spooner! What's out there!
scene_heading: EXT. REAR OF THE BOAT - GENERATOR HOLD - NIGHT
text: The FOG drifts along the rear of the boat with a strange
text: fluidity, almost WITH PURPOSE...
text: As it reaches the GENERATOR HOLD, it SWEEPS DOWN, curling
text: into the cracks and seams around the hold as if it knows
dialog: precisely where it wants to go...
scene_heading: INT. STEERING HOUSE
text: SPOONER and the girls come racing into the steering house,
text: SLAMMING the door behind them.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I can’t see shit! Turn on the...
text: SPOONER stares at the instrument panel in shock. Everything

scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE RADAR SCREEN
text: A LARGE DOT PINGS close to the center.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Christ! There’s something right in
dialog: front of us!
scene_heading: INT. GENERATOR HOLD
text: The FOG drifts down and is INHALED BY THE CARBURETOR! The
text: generator begins to CLANK and SMOKE and finally BREAKS DOWN.
scene_heading: INT. STEERING HOUSE
text: The LIGHTS GO OUT.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: The generator!
text: SPOONER grabs a FLASHLIGHT, races out of the steering house,

scene_heading: EXT. SEAGRASS
text: .SPOONER can barely see two feet in front of him as THE FOG
text: continues to PULSE. The RUSHING sound grows louder with each

dialog: down at
speaker_heading: POV - GENERATOR HOLD
text: BLACK SMOKE pours from the hold.
text: SPOONER leans down to get a better view, when he hears a
text: CREAKING NOISE beside the boat. He swings the flashlight
text: around, points it into the fog.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Hello! Is somebody out there!
scene_heading: POV - INTO THE FOG
text: As the flashlight FINDS SOMETHING -- a thick, rusted CHAIN
text: rising out of the water. He follows it up to its source and
dialog: we finally see it:
dialog: 29.
text: THE CHARRED, ROTTING HULL OF A CLIPPER SHIP!
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: SEAN! You gotta see this!
scene_heading: INT. STEERING HOUSE
text: SEAN hurries out of the wheelhouse, past the two girls, shuts

dialog: What is!

scene_heading: INT. STEERING HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The GIRLS peer out the window, trying to see what’s going on.
text: Suddenly there’s a banging at the door -- loud and even:
text: KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!
text: The REAL BLONDE goes to the door...
speaker_heading: REAL BLONDE
dialog: Spooner? Is that you?
dialog: ..and opens it.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SEAGRASS - NIGHT
text: SPOONER and SEAN stand listening to a SOUND coming from the
text: other end of the boat, like water dripping on the deck.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: What is that?
text: And now, FOOTSTEPS, coming towards them, closer, closer...
text: SPOONER shines the flashlight in that direction, BUT THERE'S
text: NOTHING THERE.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: We gotta get the hell outta here,
dialog: Spooner.
text: Suddenly, HYSTERICAL CRIES peal from the steering house.
text: There’s a horrible THUDDING sound, as if bodies are being
dialog: heaved and broken, then...
speaker_heading: DEAD SILENCE.
text: SEAN and SPOONER are freaked out of their minds. They stand
text: there in the quiet, frozen by fear, when...
text: A BODY COMES SMASHING THROUGH THE STEERING HOUSE WINDOW, hits
text: the deck with a wet smack. SPOONER shines the light down --
text: it’s one of the GIRLS -- wig askew, her body bent and twisted
dialog: in ways it was never meant to go.
text: SPOONER turns to face SEAN, the flashlight wavering in his
dialog: hand, when suddenly...
text: SEAN’S body JOLTS. His head snaps back, arms and legs
text: spraddled, as if pinioned by some invisible, overwhelming
dialog: force...
text: ...and the following happens fast. THE FOG, formless at
text: first, quickly compacts itself into something too grotesque
dialog: to be human, but capable of very human movements...
text: IT TAKES UP THE BONING KNIFE, inching it closer and closer to
speaker_heading: SEAN'S EYES...
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: HELP ME SPOONER! !11!
text: ON SPOONER NOW, eyes wide in horror, as we HEAR two obscene
speaker_heading: PUNCTURE SOUNDS.
text: SPOONER backs up, stumbling. He catches himself, and when he
dialog: turns...
text: The FOG is there, inches from his face. He tells himself
dialog: this can’t be real...
dialog: 31.
text: THE FOG seizes hold of SPOONER’S neck, its “£ingers” pressing
text: the flesh on either side of his vertebrae. It rears back
text: now, like a cobra about to strike, when
text: SPOONER opens his mouth in a scream that never comes, as THE
text: FOG suddenly DIVES DOWN HIS THROAT! And off the HORRIBLE
text: SOUND of CARTILAGE and TISSUE being forced beyond their

scene_heading: AN OLD. STONE CHURCH - NIGHT
text: Dark stone and bleeding mortar. Built to last. A SPIRE juts
text: skyward in a tapered pike, housing the church’s CLOCKTOWER.
text: At its peak is a LARGE CROSS.
text: The FACE AND HANDS OF THE CLOCK are black and without luster,
text: tarnished by a century’s exposure to the elements. They tell
dialog: us it is now HALF-PAST MIDNIGHT, and as we HEAR the’ SOUND of
text: an approaching vehicle, CAMERA BOOMS DOWN to:
speaker_heading: A CEMETERY
text: Next door to the church. HEADLIGHTS splash over GRAVESTONES,
text: a few of which are simple slabs, but most are more elaborate,

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Don’t make this harder than it
dialog: already is. Just kiss me.

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: When you said a friend was picking

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Hello, Mother. Nice to see you,
dialog: too.
text: KATHY helps her in with her suitcase.
speaker_heading: KATHY

text: bites his toe. He yelps.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Mmmm. Tastes like chicken.
text: NICK'S head pops out now, and they fall back onto the
text: pillows. He leans over to kiss her, when A LOUD POUNDING ON
text: THE DOOR startles them both.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Maybe if we don’t say anything
text: they’11 go away.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Maybe it’s a she. Maybe I should

text: And as she starts to get up.
speaker_heading: POV - FRONT DOOR
dialog: We can see it from the bed, when...
text: KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (growling)
dialog: Who is it!!!
dialog: (there’s no reply)
dialog: If that’s you, Spooner, I’m gonna
dialog: kick your ass!
dialog: And then...
text: KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!
text: Disgusted, NICK springs up, pulling on his boxers, stopped by
dialog: what he sees next,
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE .DOOR
text: A BONE-COLORED LIGHT, PULSING just outside. Through the
text: sidelights, we can see a SWIRLING MIST pressing against the
dialog: glass.
text: Something beyond appears to move now, a gray shadow in all
text: the white, moving with lazy hypnotizing speed...
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What the hell...
scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE DOORKNOB
text: NICK reaches for it, WHIPS open the door...
scene_heading: EXT. NICK'S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
text: He comes out onto the porch, looks out.
text: NICK'S POV - On the BEACH, as the wall of FOG roils back out
dialog: to sea.
text: ELIZABETH comes out now, wrapped in nothing but a blanket.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Who was it?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don’t know.
text: He stands there, scanning the beach for some sign of life.
text: There's nothing but empty beach and dark ocean., so he turns
dialog: to go back inside, when...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: That’s weird.
text: She points. He looks.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Those footprints. Like somebody
dialog: walked out of the water, right up
dialog: to the door.
scene_heading: THEIR POV - THE BEACH
text: The FOOTPRINTS lead from the ocean up to his door. But the
text: rest of the beach is completely smooth, washed clean by the
dialog: tide...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DAY
text: A glistening BLACK CRAB darts into a crevice as a WAVE
text: CRASHES ON THE ROCKS...
text: WHITE WATER SPRAYS across the screen, and as the froth
text: recedes, we can see SOMETHING SHINY, wedged between the
dialog: rocks...
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: A FRESH-FACED LITTLE BOY
dialog: Comes bounding up the beach. This is the boy we saw in the
text: PHOTO. He plays a game with the tide, trying to stay dry,
text: sending the sandpipers scurrying, when SOMETHING CATCHES HIS
speaker_heading: EYE.
text: He walks over, bends down to see something GOLD, glinting in
text: the sunlight, half-buried in the sand.
text: Another wave crashes down. The BOY reaches for the thing,
text: and when the water recedes, HE GRABS IT...
text: He holds it up, wiping away the sand and slime, when we
text: realize it’s THE GOLD HAIRBRUSH from the opening, caked with
text: crud, its bristles eaten away by the sea...
scene_heading: INT. BEACH HOUSE ~- DAY
text: The front room is cozy, lots of wood and stone, with a
text: fantastic wall of GLASS DOORS looking out at the beach.
text: Through them, we see the BOY run by.
speaker_heading: BOY (0.S.)
speaker_heading: MOM!
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
text: SOMEBODY is sound asleep in bed as the BOY blasts through the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Mom! Wake up! Look what I found!
text: There is no movement, so the BOY rips down the covers to find
text: STEVIE curled up in her t-shirt and panties.
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: Ubhhgggghhh. Hi Andy...
text: He drops his wet and sandy swag on the pillow beside her.
text: The first thing she sees when she opens her eyes...
speaker_heading: . BOY (ANDY)
dialog: I found it on the beach. Between
dialog: some rocks! I think it’s gold!
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: We should be so lucky...
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: It’s heavy. Feel.
dialog: 38.
text: STEVIE picks it up, tests its heft, impressed.
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: Must’ve been somebody’s hairbrush
dialog: once upon a time...
text: STEVIE puts it down, smiles warmly and kisses her son.
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: So. Wanna go out for breakfast?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: (jumps off the bed)
dialog: Yeah, but first I wanna go back
dialog: down to the beach. Maybe the tide
dialog: washed up more stuff!
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: Half an hour, okay? I’ve got to go
dialog: in a little early today.’ Maybe
dialog: Mrs. Kobritz will help you look.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Mom. Please. All she does is eat
dialog: Tim-Tams and watch Wheel of
dialog: Fortune.
text: ANDY races out. STEVIE sits there for a moment. She smiles
text: when she sees ANDY past the window - a mother watching her
dialog: son grow up.
text: Then she glances down at the brush.
scene_heading: INT. STEVIE’S BATHROOM - SINK - DAY
text: STEVIE holds the brush under running water, wiping away
text: layers of gunk and slime, revealing the intricate etching on
text: the back. She rubs it dry with a towel, and underneath, it’s
dialog: shiny -- like gold. Hmmm...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - MORNING

text: She digs her toes into the sand, enjoying the crash of the

dialog: 39.
text: NICK comes out, hands her a cup of coffee, kisses her on the
dialog: head. .
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I think the beach is the only thing
dialog: I really miss.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: You. And the beach.
text: We HEAR NICK'S PHONE ringing inside the house.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hold that thought.
text: He runs inside. She gets up, wandering down to the hard
text: sand. She picks up a seashell, admiring it, when she hears
dialog: NICK shout from the deck:
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Elizabeth!
text: She turns to him, instantly worried by the look on his face.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Spooner and Sean never made it back

speaker_heading: HANK

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Unbelievable. I’m gonna need a

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Sure. Key’s in it. You want me to

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Spooner? Sean!
text: There’s no reply and no sign of life (or death) on deck.
text: NICK helps ELIZABETH aboard.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Maybe somebody picked them up.
text: NICK notices some BROKEN GLASS on the deck, looks up to see
text: the shattered STEERING HOUSE WINDOW.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Maybe not.
scene_heading: INT. STEERING HOUSE - DAY
text: The door CREAKS open. NICK steps inside. He goes to the
text: window, notices BLOOD on the broken glass. He looks down at
text: the CONTROLS, turns to ELIZABETH:
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Look at these gauges. They’re all
dialog: shattered.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Like your truck.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah...

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Spooner!
scene_heading: EXT, THE DECK - DAY

text: in the arm of the fighting chair. Its line has been cast.
speaker_heading: ° ELIZABETH
dialog: Would they’ve been fishing?
speaker_heading: NICK (0.S.)
dialog: I don’t know. Why?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: There’s a line in the water...
scene_heading: INT. CABIN - DAY
text: He shakes his head -- none of this makes any sense.
dialog: A2.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I have no clue, Reel it in for me,
dialog: will you, before we lose the rig.
text: NICK reaches the last door in the cabin, open just a crack.
text: He pushes it. Slowly, it CREAKS inward to REVEAL...
text: SOMEONE LYING ON THE BED, facing away from us, hair wet and
text: matted with SEAWEED...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Sean?
speaker_heading: BACK ON DECK

dialog: strain.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Nick! There’s something on this
dialog: line...
speaker_heading: BACK IN THE CABIN
text: _ NICK moves to the bed, reaches out tentatively, when
text: THE BODY LOLLS OVER ONTO ITS BACK and we see SEAN'S HOLLOW
text: EYE SOCKETS GAPING OUT AT US!
text: NICK recoils, hitting the wall, backing out the door before
dialog: he vomits...
speaker_heading: ON DECK
text: NICK stumbles out of the cabin, leans over the rail, heart
text: pounding. ELIZABETH keeps reeling, LOOKS OVER AT HIM.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Nick! What is it?
dialog: And she’s still focused on NICK, when we SEE SOMETHING APPEAR
text: JUST BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER at the end of her
dialog: line...
text: HUMAN BODIES, pale, bent and broken, fish-bitten ARMS and
text: LEGS and FLOWING BLONDE HAIR, bound tight in a tangle of
dialog: fishing line...
dialog: ...and just when we realize it’s the TWINS -- or what’s left
dialog: of them...
text: THE LINE SNAPS! ELIZABETH turns back, catching only the
text: slightest glimpse, as the BLOATED CORPSES sink out of sight.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: NICK!
text: He comes over to her, following her gaze...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What was it?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I don't know, I couldn’t tell. It
dialog: looked like...bodies.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Jesus. C’mon. I’m getting you off
dialog: this boat.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (stopping him)
dialog: Tell me what you saw in the cabin.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: We've gotta deal with this
dialog: together, Nick! Now tell me!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Sean. He's dead.

scene_heading: INT. SEAGRASS - GENERATOR HOLD - DAY
text: The door opens. NICK enters the hold, has a look around. He
text: notices the GENERATOR, coated with a thin film of salt
dialog: crystals. He touches it -- that makes no sense...
scene_heading: EXT. BOSTON WHALER - DAY
text: ELIZABETH hugs herself, suddenly feeling very alone, when she
text: HEARS SOMETHING CREAK on deck. She stands up, looking
text: towards the sound, and in a thin voice:
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Nick? Is that you?
scene_heading: INT. GENERATOR HOLD - DAY
text: NICK stands up -- nothing more to see here. He exits the
text: hold, SLAMMING the door.

text: She looks up, registering THE FREEZER. She reaches for the
text: handle and gives it a pull, but the thing won’t budge. She
text: tugs again, harder this time, but still no joy.
text: She puts her feet against the wall, gives it one last YANK
text: and this time the DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN! ELIZABETH SCREAMS!!!
text: THERE'S A PERSON IN THE FREEZER!!! BLUE from the cold, HAIR
text: COVERED IN ICE CRYSTALS. IT’S SPOONER! Is he DEAD? He must

speaker_heading: TOM MALONE
dialog: Somebody wanna tell me what the

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: He hasn't said a word since we

speaker_heading: TOM MALONE

dialog: There’s something out there, Nick.
speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: They were out on the Seagrass last

text: STEVIE, firing a blast of CO2. As the dust settles, THE
text: FIRST THING WE NOTICE is THE HOLE IN THE CONSOLE TOP -- a
text: perfect outline of the BRUSH, which has melted completely
dialog: through.
text: But, underneath, THE BRUSH HAS VANISHED, and we WIDEN to see
text: The fire has SCORCHED THE PLASTER where the art once hung,
text: REVEALING A WEIRD PATTERN on the lighthouse wall. Maybe a
dialog: window, or a trap door was here once, but it has long since
text: been BRICKED-IN.
text: STEVIE reaches up, brushing away blistered plaster, when
text: ONE OF THE BRICKS comes loose in its mortar. She pokes at it
dialog: curiously, SURPRISED WHEN IT GIVES WAY, and we can HEAR it
text: fall into the hollow of the wall...
text: She drops the fire extinguisher and stands there, staring at
text: the open hole. She leans in, peering into the void, but it’s
text: PITCH DARK in there and she can’t see a thing.
text: She jimmies a few more bricks loose, drops them on the floor.
text: With more light now, she sticks her head in...
dialog: 54.
scene_heading: STEVIE’S POV - INSIDE THE WALL
text: SHE SEES SOMETHING wedged between the studs, but the light

scene_heading: POV ~ INSIDE THE HOLE - A MINUTE LATER
text: STEVIE'S ARM REACHES IN...fingers feeling around blindly,
text: straining for the thing, but she can’t quite reach it, when
dialog: SOMETHING LASHES AROUND HER WRIST! !
scene_heading: ON STEVIE’S TERRIFIED FACE
text: As she tries to pull her arm from the hole! THE LIGHTS and
text: ELECTRONICS in the room begin to flicker and buzz, and
text: whatever has her, PULLS HER INTO THE WALL, with force enough
text: to send the rest of the bricks cascading down around her...
text: SHE FALLS, SHRIEKING in horror at what’s now attached to her
dialog: hand!
text: CLOSE ON HER HAND - AN OLD BOOK IS TETHERED TO IT BY A
text: LIVING SNARL OF LONG, BLACK HAIR, LACED WITH SAND AND SLIME
dialog: AND UNDULATING SEAWEED!!!
text: She goes for a pair of SCISSORS on the desk, HACKING AT THE
text: SLIMY MASS. YELLOW OOZE spurts from the SEAWEED TENDRILS, as
dialog: whatever it is FINALLY LETS GO and the book falls to the
dialog: floor.
text: _She checks her wrist where the thing had hold of her -- red,
text: puffy, rising welts...
text: She looks down at the book, only now, it’s just a dusty old,
text: leatherbound book. No sign of anything strange.

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: It didn’t belong to anybody...
speaker_heading: STEVIE

dialog: makes a decision.
text: She takes off her sweatshirt, throws it over the book, then
text: kicks at it to be sure it’s “dead”.
text: Satisfied, she brings a wastebasket over, and in one quick
text: motion, scoops up the book and dumps it in, keeping her
dialog: distance...
text: She goes to her computer, types something in. The DISPLAY
text: READS: PRE-RECORDED TRACKS - 60:00. She hits ENTER and the

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What is up with you?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I mean Sean’s dead, and you're

text: SPOONER opens the bathroom door, takes his clothes off the

dialog: emotions. :
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I can’t remember what happened
dialog: anymore. Like it’s just... Gone.
dialog: I’m so sorry he's dead, Nick, but I

speaker_heading: TOM MALONE (0.S.)
dialog: Is that so?. :

text: Surprised, SPOONER looks back at MALONE, who stands in the

speaker_heading: MRS. KOBRITZ

speaker_heading: MRS. KOBRITZ

speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: Father Malone?

scene_heading: INT. FATHER MALONE’'S ROOM - DAY

dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: FATHER MALONE
dialog: What've you got there?
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: Something happened today. If I
dialog: told you what, you’d think I was
dialog: crazy. And maybe I am. But all I
dialog: know is right now, I’m afraid for
dialog: my son and I don‘t know what else
dialog: to do.
text: She dumps the wastebasket onto his desk. THE JOURNAL spills
text: out. MALONE eyes the cover, looks up chillingly.
speaker_heading: FATHER MALONE
dialog: Where did you get this?
speaker_heading: STEVIE
text: In the lighthouse. Hidden ina
dialog: wall.
speaker_heading: FATHER MALONE
dialog: Hidden...

speaker_heading: FATHER MALONE
dialog: I'm afraid can’t help you.
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: Something’s happening, isn’t it,

speaker_heading: FATHER MALONE

speaker_heading: STEVIE

text: STICKING OUT BETWEEN THE PAGES...
text: Hesitant, she picks it up, pulling out TWO OLD, CREASED
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHS :
text: THE FIRST is a panorama-type, taken from a hillside vantage

dialog: reads: ANTONIO BAY ~ 1905
text: THE SECOND PHOTO is of our TWELVE MEN, assembled on the

scene_heading: INT. EXAMINATION ROOM

text: open and comes in. She stands there for a beat, then moves
text: tentatively, approaching her friend, seeing death up-close
dialog: for the very first time.
text: It’s too much for her. She turns to go, tears welling in her
text: eyes, when behind her, WE SEE SEAN SIT UP ON THE STEEL TABLE!
text: CLOSE ON HIS PURPLED FEET - as they hit the linoleum, moving
text: stiffly across the floor.
text: Hearing this, ELIZABETH stops. Slowly, she TURNS...
text: SEAN THRUSTS HIS ARMS OUT, TAKING HER BY THE HEAD, SQUEEZING

speaker_heading: TOM MALONE
dialog: My great grand-dad. One of the

text: He's clinging to it like it was worth its weight in gold.
speaker_heading: STEVIE

dialog: Did you read any of it?
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: No.
text: MALONE offers the book back to STEVIE...

scene_heading: EXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Yo! Who's there?
text: Silence. DAN turns, yelling towards the phone again.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I think some fool got drunk and
dialog: started taking this hundred-year

speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: NO! NOOO00000000!

dialog: 75.
text: A HUGE FIREBALL COMES HURTLING BACK THROUGH THE DOOR WITH
dialog: TREMENDOUS FORCE, only this fireball is SCREAMING!!!
scene_heading: INT. LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: STEVIE listens in horror over the phone, when a SMASHING
text: SOUND breaks the silence, like all the glass in the

text: Dead silence. She listens. Quiet.
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: (weak)
dialog: Dan...
text: STEVIE hangs up. Freaked. Thinks. Punches her cell phone,
text: HOME pops on the display... Puts the phone to her ear, but
text: the call won't go through. Nothing but SCRATCHY STATIC...
text: So she picks up the land line and dials...
scene_heading: EXT. TELEPHONE POLE - NIGHT
text: There's a GLOW on the pole as THE FOG swirls up the base,

dialog: just outside...
scene_heading: EXT. TELEPHONE POLE - NIGHT
text: THE FOG achieves the top of the telephone pole. A thick ROPE
text: OF MIST forming a noose around the main cluster of wires...
dialog: 76.
scene_heading: INT. STEVIE’S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
text: MRS. KOBRITZ moves over to the phone, reaching blindly for
dialog: it, if she could only take her eyes off the tube...
scene_heading: EXT. TELEPHONE POLE - NIGHT
text: We hear the TENSILE POPS as the wires SNAP!!!
scene_heading: INT. STEVIE’S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
text: MRS. KOBRITZ finally finds the phone.
speaker_heading: MRS. KOBRITZ
dialog: Hello? Hello!
scene_heading: INT. LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: The phone goes dead in STEVIE’S hand. She jiggles the
text: cradle. Nothing. She slams the receiver down in
text: frustration. She stands for a moment by the window, then
text: looks out again. Sees THE FOG...
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
text: We’re on top of a hillside, looking down into a STAND OF
text: TREES. Nothing unusual here. But a moment later, the forest
text: begins to GLOW...
scene_heading: EXT. WATER TANK - NIGHT
text: .THE FOG surges towards a huge METAL WATER TANK, perched on

text: CLOSE ON A RED VALVE-HANDLE - as THE FOG creeps over, IT
text: BEGINS TO TURN, RELEASING A HUGE TORRENT OF WATER THAT GOES
text: FLOODING DOWN THE HILLSIDE.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE

text: Conerete and steel. The THRUM of turbines and generators

scene_heading: EXT. SWITCHBACK - WOODS - NIGHT
text: NICK'S truck roars PAST CAMERA.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
text: The GLOWING FOG moves out of the woods, rolling towards the

text: the FOG moves closer, pressing up onto the shoulder, almost
dialog: to the asphalt now, when...
text: NICK'S TRUCK flies right by... one split second before THE
text: FOG swirls over the road...
scene_heading: INT. NICK'S PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. ANDY’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: ANDY moves to his window. Outside, we see a REVENANT OF FOG
text: moving around the sill, searching for a way in. ANDY taps
text: the glass. The FOG stops, cocks its “head”, as if curious,
dialog: then...
scene_heading: EXT. STEVIE’S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The FOG dips below the windowsill, still searching. We FLOW
text: WITH IT, as it hugs the foundation, investigating the
text: possibilities. Finally it wafts out to the street, rolling
text: over the curb, hugging the gutter...
text: . flowing down into the sewer.
scene_heading: EXT. POWER STATION - NIGHT
text: SPINES OF THE FOG surround the building, each acting
text: independently of the next, all seeking a point of entry.
text: There’s a CRACKED WINDOW in the back. One SPINE OF FOG
text: “turns”, as if to notify its counterparts, which QUICKLY
text: MERGE into a SWIRLING MASS...
scene_heading: INT. POWER STATION - NIGHT
text: THE FOG seeps in through the broken window, drifting towards
text: the GENERATORS...
scene_heading: INT. LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: STEVIE flips a switch, brings the mic to her lips.
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: This is Stevie on KAB. There’s a
dialog: problem with the phones here at the

scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
text: Passing a turnoff, NICK’S TRUCK SCREECHES TO A STOP, backs up
dialog: and turns the other way.
scene_heading: INT. POWER STATION - NIGHT
text: THE FOG splits into TWO DISTINCT TENDRILS, curling sharply,
text: allowing themselves to be SUCKED INTO THE GUTS OF THE DUAL
speaker_heading: TURBINES.
text: ZAAAAAAAAP! THERE‘S A HUGE FLOWING ARC OF ELECTRICITY BEFORE
text: THE WHOLE SYSTEM OVERLOADS AND EXPLODES!
scene_heading: INT. LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: The lights flicker and die. The electronics DRONE to a stop.
text: STEVIE checks her console. Everything's dead.
scene_heading: EXT. LIGHTHOUSE ROOF - NIGHT
text: The LIGHTHOUSE BEACON goes out, grinding to a halt.
scene_heading: INSERT - A RESERVE BATTERY IN AN ORANGE COAST-GUARD CASING.
text: WE HEAR AN AUTOMATIC SWITCHING SOUND.
scene_heading: EXT. LIGHTHOUSE ROOF
text: THE BEACON COMES BACK TO LIFE.
scene_heading: INT. LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Unfortunately, this has no effect on the lights inside the

dialog: to swallow it whole...
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: Screw this.
text: She picks up her car keys and goes.
scene_heading: “EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

speaker_heading: TOM MALONE

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: This is awesome.
speaker_heading: MRS. KOBRITZ
dialog: I think we better close all the
dialog: windows. Check your bedroom. I/11
dialog: check your mother’s.
text: As they turn for the bedrooms, we HOLD on the GLASS DOORS as
text: THE FOG rises up the panes, swirling, flowing, AND WITHIN IT,
text: WE COULD SWEAR WE SEE FACES - HAUNTED FACES - PEERING IN.
scene_heading: INT. CRAWLSPACE - STEVIE’S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
text: WE’RE CLOSE ON A SLOW-DRIPPING PIPE as a WATER DROPLET forms,
text: then falls, forms, then falls...
text: Suddenly, the dripping stops. An TINY PUFF OF FOG leaks out,
text: then we HEAR THE PIPES MOAN as it passes through...
scene_heading: INT. COAST GUARD WEATHER STATION - NIGHT
text: The station is dark and quiet. EVERY WINDOW IS SHATTERED,
text: but there is no sign of THE FOG.
text: Through the open door, we see NICK’S PICKUP drive up. He and
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH get out.
text: They come in through the open door and we hear GLASS

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Hello? Anybody here?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Be careful, there’s glass
dialog: everywhere.
text: ELIZABETH stays right beside him.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: What is that smell?
dialog: 81.
text: They cross the room, assaying the damage, when WE HEAR:
scene_heading: SPLAT. SPLAT. SPLAT.
text: ELIZABETH’S flashlight finds a GOOEY RED LIQUID, pooling on
dialog: the floor...

speaker_heading: NICK ELIZABETH

scene_heading: EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: STEVIE gets into her car. THE FOG is coming towards her,
text: bearing down, ODDLY LIT every few seconds by the LIGHTHOUSE
speaker_heading: BEACON.
text: She looks behind her as she fumbles the key into the
text: ignition, seeing nothing but white. She hits a button, which
text: raises the CONVERTIBLE TOP, slowly...slowly. She winds up
text: the windows now, which close just as
text: THE FOG swallows the car. STEVIE turns the key. The engine
text: kicks over, but won’t catch.
scene_heading: INSERT - UNDER THE CAR‘S HOOD
text: THE FOG seeps in around the grille, following the injector
text: lines, and as STEVIE cranks the engine, it PENETRATES THE AIR
dialog: INTAKE . .
scene_heading: INT. STEVIE'S CONVERTIBLE - NIGHT
text: She tries once more, but it’s not happening. Outside, in the
text: PULSING WHITE, she sees that familiar MOVEMENT in the mist,
text: IMAGES rushing past, when SUDDENLY, THERE’S A POUNDING ON THE
dialog: GLASS...
text: KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!
text: STEVIE screams, makes a checking 360...but there’s nobody
dialog: there...
scene_heading: INT. STEVIE’S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
text: MRS. KOBRITZ stands in the kitchen. She strikes a match,
text: lights a few CANDLES, when she hears a strange GURGLING
text: coming from the sink.
dialog: 82.
text: She picks up one of the candles, leans down to get a better
dialog: look...
speaker_heading: HER POV - THE SINK
text: The drain is backing up. The garbage disposal begins
text: coughing up dark, scummy water.
speaker_heading: MRS. KOBRITZ
dialog: Shit.
text: She gets a plunger from under the sink and goes to work, as
text: the PIPES begin to rattle and groan...
text: She leans down again, inspecting, but the drain is still
text: clogged. Some greasy bubbles rise ominously to the surface.
text: Reluctantly, she pushes up her sleeve and sticks her hand in
text: up to the elbow, grimacing, feeling around for a long beat.
text: Finally there comes a look on her face as if she’s found the
dialog: problem, when
text: Her arm is tugged by something unseen. There’s a puzzled
text: look on her face, and then
text: KERSPLASH!!! Her arm is jerked violently down the drain,
text: SUBMERSING HER FACE in the DARK WATER. BUBBLES ROIL as the
text: old woman screams and struggles beneath the surface, as she
dialog: is JERKED DOWN AGAIN, HARDER AND HARDER, when...
text: SUDDENLY the THRASHING STOPS.
text: We're behind her now, as she stands up, gasping for breath,
text: hair dripping unctuous water on her bright pant-suit...
text: HER POV - as she pulls her arm from the water...
text: TO FIND IT COVERED IN PUS-FILLED BOILS AND SAGGING,
speaker_heading: GANGRENOUS TISSUE.
text: She TURNS TO FACE US NOW, A STEAMING MONSTROSITY OF GREEN,
text: ROTTING FLESH AND YELLOW OOZING PUS.
text: She reaches up to touch her face, but the skin only comes off

text: drop from her mouth and hit the floor.
dialog: y
dialog: 83.
scene_heading: INT. STEVIE’S CAR - NIGHT
text: STEVIE tries to start the car one last time. Hopeless.
text: Outside, the weird strobing of the lighthouse beacon
text: continues, BUT WHAT SHE DOESN’T SEE, are tiny wisps of THE
text: FOG, SEEPING-IN THROUGH THE VENTS IN THE DASH...
text: Before she can react, tendrils of the stuff surge in, moving
text: past her shoulders, LOCKING THE DOORS!
text: THE FOG jerks the seatbelt out of its reel, PINNING STEVIE TO
text: HER SEAT BY THE THROAT.
text: HER SEAT SLIDES BACK - her feet can no longer touch the
dialog: brakes,
text: The GEARSHIFT POPS INTO NEUTRAL and the CAR BEGINS TO ROLL!
dialog: (towards the cliff above the ocean which we can’t see, but we
dialog: know is there)...
text: With one hand clutching at the belt around her neck, STEVIE
text: grabs the parking brake with the other. THE FOG fights her
text: for it, rasping at her fingers, turning them bloody, until
text: she finally must let go.
text: The car keeps rolling, building momentum now, as STEVIE SEES
text: A BUTTON ON THE DASH:
speaker_heading: DEFROSTER.
text: She hits it full blast. Her hair BLOWS BACK. THE FOG makes
text: a weird, almost child-like SOUND as the warm air from the
dialog: defrosters hits.
text: THE FOG seems to diminish somehow, and in that instant, she
text: pulls the seatbelt from around her neck,
scene_heading: EXT. STEVIE'S CONVERTIBLE - NIGHT
text: THE FRONT WHEELS of the slow-rolling car drop. The car skids
text: out over cliff’s edge.
scene_heading: INT. STEVIE’S CONVERTIBLE - NIGHT
text: She finds the doorhandle, and JUMPS out, falling, falling,
text: until she SMACKS down on a tiny outcropping.
text: Visibility ZERO, she backs away from the ledge, hugging the
text: wall of the cliff, when out of the WHITE VOID ABOVE...
text: THE CAR FALLS -- A TON OF STEEL AND RUBBER GO FLYING RIGHT.
text: PAST HER, MISSING THE LEDGE BY INCHES, DISAPPEARING INTO THE

speaker_heading: CLOSE ON ANDY
text: Who stands in the doorway, FRIGHTENED beyond belief. He runs
text: down the hall into his room, slams the door.
scene_heading: INT. ANDY’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: He stands there, trembling and afraid, his eyes on the light
text: coming under the crack of his door.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON THE DOOR
text: As a thin wisp of THE FOG appears underneath.
text: ANDY rips the covers off his bed, stuffs them under the
text: crack, seemingly quashing the threat, when...
text: KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!
text: He backs away from the door, wanting to panic. Instead, he
text: rushes over to his desk, searching for something, until he
text: finds a roll of SCOTCH TAPE...
scene_heading: EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Battered and bruised, STEVIE claws her way back up and over
text: the cliff. She looks for the BEACON ON THE LIGHTHOUSE,
text: locates it, gets to her feet...
text: AND MAKES A RUN FOR IT, the BEACON her only compass.
text: WEIRD SHAPES AND IMAGES WISK PAST IN THE ETHER, reaching out
text: for her as she runs, snatching at her hair, her clothes,
dialog: blinding her in all the white...
scene_heading: INT. LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: STEVIE bursts in, SLAMS the door, slides the bolt across.
text: She opens a storage closet, shoves some rags under the crack
text: in the door.
text: She goes over, rips a tarp off the lighthouse’s auxiliary
text: generator. She YANKS the cord. The thing sputters. She
text: YANKS again.
dialog: 85.
text: In a frenzy, she pulls the generator cord over and over.
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: Please start... Please...
text: Suddenly, the generator SPUTTERS to life, HUMMING steadily.

speaker_heading: LINEMAN
dialog: We got power up to here. Trouble’s
dialog: gotta be at the substation.

text: THE GUY looks up at his buddy, takes a bite of his sandwich,
text: when we see A SLITHERING TENDRIL OF THE FOG SNAKE ITS WAY
text: RIGHT UP HIS NOSE.
text: The GUY blinks, wipes his nose, checks his sleeve. Then, he
text: turns and matter-of-factly grabs the levers of the lift
speaker_heading: bucket and PULLS.

dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: LINEMAN
dialog: Lucius! What the hell’re you doin!

speaker_heading: TOM MALONE

scene_heading: INT. THE CHURCH - NIGHT

text: HE TURNS TOWARDS ELIZABETH, REACHING OUT TO HER, AS THE FOG
text: DECIMATES HIM FROM THE SCALP DOWN...
text: THE BONES OF HIS SPINE AND RIBCAGE FALL DOWN AROUND WHAT USED

text: THE FOG CONTINUES TO FORTIFY ITSELF, taking on a predatory

text: ON THE MALONES.
text: Side-by-side at the fireplace. TOM looks at his brother,
text: slowly distancing himself. BUT IT’S NOT BOBBY THE FOG
dialog: WANTS...
text: TOM MALONE begins to tremble. THE FOG reaches out and
text: touches his face, almost caressing it.
text: It draws him in, examining him now like a piece of meat ina

text: almost as if it is searching for something in TOM MALONE’S
dialog: eyes...
text: MALONE IS SUDDENLY YANKED HEAD-FIRST INTO THE BELLY OF THE

text: SUDDENLY, STEVIE LETS OUT A YELP. She lifts up her arm, sees

text: SHE SQUIRMS, as if being contained by forces unseen,
text: something PULLING HER HAIR NOW, arching her head back as...
speaker_heading: CAMERA FOLLOWS A KNIFE
text: As it appears from the darkness below her waistline, the

scene_heading: EXT. THE WOODS - NIGHT

text: But the thing with the knife SLAMS HER BACK AGAINST THE

scene_heading: THE ELIZABETH DANE.
scene_heading: EXT. A CLEARING - NIGHT
