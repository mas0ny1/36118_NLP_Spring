scene_heading: 1 INT. LIMBO RADIO 1
dialog:

dialog: There's an old joke. It comes from "The
dialog: Iliad," but I think it was popularized by
dialog: Oscar Wilde. It goes like this:
dialog: ...A bear's taking a shit, like, out in the
dialog: woods one day. And he sees this rabbit,
dialog: also taking a shit. The rabbit, wait, I
dialog: mean, the bear, he's shitting up a storm,
dialog: cuz he's been eating Mexican. The
dialog: wiping's taking forever, and his shit
dialog: keeps sticking to his fur. Wait, what
dialog: happens next? Oh, right-- he asks the
dialog: rabbit if he ever has trouble wiping. The
dialog: rabbit says no, shit just slides right
text: off him. So the bear picks the rabbit up
text: and wipes his ass with him.
dialog: (pause, as if for applause)
dialog: Well, I never said it was a good joke.
dialog: And see, that makes it perfect, because
dialog: it's pretty much the story of my life.
dialog: 
text: We can now see that he's perched on a stool, wearing a REM t-
text: shirt and old jeans. He gesticulates vaguely as he talks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Growing up, my parents were huge Woody
dialog: Allen fans. Still are. Personally, I hate
dialog: him. Same thing with the Beatles, such a
dialog: part of my background that I must have
dialog: been about 16 by the time I realized how
dialog: useless it was to rebel by ignoring the
dialog: Beatles or any other cultural artifact of
dialog: their generation. Even if I did spend my
dialog: childhood hearing my father go on and on
dialog: about how, like, Nirvana would never mean
dialog: anything because they're not the Beatles,
dialog: blah-blah. I don't know, this is all
dialog: starting to sound a little bit too
dialog: angsty, you know, and that's about the
dialog: last thing I'm going for here... Shit, I
dialog: really got off track there, didn't I?

text: As Max shakes his head, a hanging RADIO MIKE comes into view.
text: It has the call letters of a college radio station on it.

scene_heading: 2 INT. MAX'S CHILDHOOD HOME ­ FLASHBACK ­ DAY 2
dialog: 
text: YOUNG MAX, about five, sits on the floor and watches BANANAS
text: with his FATHER, a large, relaxed man with a mustache who
text: reclines in a tacky 80's chair and smokes a cigar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (O.S.)
dialog: Anyway, like the Beatles thing­ and this
dialog: is the point of that whole long-winded
dialog: example­ I was force-fed Woody Allen from
dialog: a young age. I remember watching Bananas
dialog: when I was about five. Of course, I hated
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: Young Max is laughing hysterically at the screen.
dialog: 
text: Max stands to the side, watching his younger self and his

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: This is my old house. We lived here, in a
dialog: dull suburb of New York, until I was ten,
dialog: when we moved to a different house in a
dialog: different dull suburb of New York.

text: On TV, a woman is bit in the breast by a snake and is chased

scene_heading: 3 INT. MAX'S SECOND HOME ­ FLASHBACK 3
dialog: 
text: In pajamas, ADOLESCENT MAX, 16, watches a newer TV in an
text: identical family room. This time, ANNIE HALL is playing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.)
dialog: Oh yeah. This wasn't the first time I saw
dialog: Annie Hall, but it was the first time I
dialog: actually appreciated it. I was flipping
text: channels on a Saturday afternoon, and
dialog: there it was, and I was stunned to find I
dialog: loved it, more stunned to find that my
dialog: parents may have had a point all along.

dialog: 
text: Adolescent Max walks alone to class. Other students rush by
text: in groups. He looks a little lost.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.)
dialog: Oh God, high school. I hated this place.
dialog: I was a Junior when I gave up trying to
dialog: fit in. Fortunately, being a social
dialog: outcast is a lot easier when your school
text: is filled with idiots.
dialog: 
text: A pair of GOTH POSERS pass. Max keeps his distance. From the
text: other direction, a 6 FOOT TALL GIRL makes eyes at Max. He
text: walks into a water fountain, drops his books.

scene_heading: 5 INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM ­ FLASHBACK 5
dialog: 
text: Adolescent Max gets hit in the face with a volleyball.
text: Everyone laughs at him, including the COACH.
dialog: 
text: Max stands to the side and winces.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: There was something in Annie Hall I
dialog: identified with. Maybe it was the style
dialog: of humor, or the defeatist attitude, I
dialog: don't know. All I know is, I kept going
dialog: back. Different people are inspired by
dialog: different things, and my source of
text: inspiration became a 20-year-old movie
dialog: about a failed relationship.
dialog: 
text: The volleyball rolls over and he picks it up.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 6 INT. RADIO STATION -- PRESENT 6
dialog: 
text: From behind Max, we see the station as it really is: small,
text: dark, cramped, and totally filled with crap. Max wears
text: headphones, sits before a large console and audio gear.
dialog: 
text: He now holds a volleyball.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: So after high school I ended up here.
dialog: There was never really any choice, not

speaker_heading: MAX
speaker_heading: (TO CAMERA)
dialog: It was freshmen year when we started
text: watching Annie Hall as a tradition.
scene_heading: (LOOKING AROUND)
dialog: Jeez, this must have been the very first
dialog: time. What's Amy doing here? I'm pretty
dialog: sure Amy wasn't here.
dialog: 
text: AMY is attractive, bookish, and sitting on Max's bed.
text: CHARLES, a skinny guy in a large chair, tries to get her
text: attention by wiggling his eyebrows seductively.
dialog: 
text: Max puts the tape in the VCR, hits rewind, and moves to sit
text: on his bed. He pauses when he sees how close he'll come to
text: Amy. Finally, he climbs over her and awkwardly sits at the
dialog: far end.
dialog: 
text: Amy watches, rolls her eyes, and looks at BETH, who shakes
text: her head sadly. Beth is pretty in an earthy way, spunky and
text: sad at the same time. She looks sympathetically at Max, who
text: is trying not to act nervous (and failing).
dialog: 
text: The couple is SAM, who's short and charismatic, with a cool,
text: slightly punkish personal style; and JEN, same height, cute
text: and serious, conservative dress. They lie on the floor
dialog: together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO CAMERA)
dialog: That's Sam and Jen. Sam was the alpha-
dialog: male of our group, which tends to consist
dialog: mostly of zeta-males. He had been going
dialog: out with Jen a couple weeks and we were
dialog: all waiting to see if she would change
dialog: him...
dialog: 
text: Sam slides a pillow under her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Are you comfortable, honey?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: I'm fine, Sam. I was worried about you.
dialog: Sure you don't want me to move over?

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh no, no, Jen, if you're happy, I'm
dialog: happy.
dialog: 
text: Max and Charles exchange a look-- there they go again. Max
text: makes a show of putting a pillow under a large Darth Vader
text: doll. Beth laughs, Amy is amused. Sam looks back and is

dialog: 
text: Max and Amy stand and face each other as the lights fade to
text: black around everyone else.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I didn't say I liked it, I said it
dialog: reminded me of you. It reminded me of
dialog: what I didn't like about you, the
dialog: cynicism, the neurotic insecurity, and oh
dialog: yeah, when you started calling me every
dialog: day. All the reasons we were never more
dialog: than friends.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Well, at least you're being honest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Of course I'm being honest. This is a

speaker_heading: ERICA
text: AND WHAT IS IT WITH JEWISH MEN AND THEIR
dialog: PENIS ISSUES?!
dialog: 
text: Max freezes in place. The entire crowd of students turns to
text: look at him. He manages a weak smile and turns back to Erica,
text: but she's gone, out the doors into the night.
dialog: 
text: Max turns back to the crowd and shrugs, but the crowd turns
text: away. Max suddenly sees someone: Beth, looking at him. He
text: blushes, self-conscious, and hurries away.

speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.)

dialog: pizza place, I called an ambulance, and
dialog: timed them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Who won?

speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: So what'd you do?!

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I gave him the pizza!

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: But you can tell with everybody? I don't
dialog: know if that's sad or incredible.
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Or incredibly sad. I'm amazed I'm the
dialog: only one who can tell. Take any couple.
dialog: If it's not incompatible lifestyles, it's
dialog: conflicting priorities. If it's not that,
dialog: it's usually clashing levels of self-
dialog: esteem. It's always something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Living with you would be a nightmare. I'd
dialog: be afraid to bring any boyfriends home.
dialog: Oh, uh, sorry.
dialog: 
text: Awkward pause.

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You guys never talk about anything
dialog: important anyway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Oh, come on, we have philosophical
dialog: discussions all the time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Like whether Voltron could kill the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: To name one hot-button issue, yes. You
dialog: want us to talk about girls? Sam is
text: nearly married to Jen, Charles doesn't

dialog: chatrooms across the country, and Scott,
dialog: well... you know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: For such "close" friends, it just seems

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'm not sure. It is the beginning of the
dialog: semester, it's time for our Annie Hall
dialog: night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Have you ever noticed that the more Annie
dialog: Hall you watch, the less successful you
dialog: are romantically? I think we'd do much
dialog: better if we watched, say, Ocean's 11.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What are you talking about? If you're
dialog: sick of Annie Hall, that's one thing, but
dialog: don't blame our sad little lives on it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 20 INT. GENERAL STORE -- CONTINUOUS 20
dialog: 
text: Charles picks out breath mints.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: No, I'm telling you, I was thinking about
dialog: this over break. Ever since we started
dialog: watching it, what has your love life been
dialog: like? And mine? Every semester, we watch
dialog: this movie, and then spend the semester
dialog: alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Alone? Last semester you hooked up with
text: like a dozen women.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You know actresses don't count.
speaker_heading: (POIGNANTLY)
dialog: I'm looking for a meaningful,
dialog: sophisticated relationship. Like Frank
dialog: and Ava. No more shallow dames for this
dialog: cat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
speaker_heading: (AGITATED)
dialog: Where did you get this grudge against my
dialog: favorite film?
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I'm just kidding around, Max. We'll watch
dialog: it tomorrow. Tonight, there's a party.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: And anyway, your theory fails to account
dialog: for our collective dorkiness and bad
dialog: haircuts. Plus, look at Sam.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Sam hasn't seen Annie Hall since freshman
dialog: year, and he's in his third year with
dialog: Jen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: So look at what not watching can do to
dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Ouch. Why are you still on this? I said I
dialog: was kidding.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 21 INT. RADIO STATION -- PRESENT 21
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What a nightmare. I dunno why I can't
dialog: stop thinking about these things. I guess
dialog: I've been a little restless lately, since
text: getting back from winter break.
dialog: Everything's been kind of weird lately.
dialog: 
text: He grabs a CD from a rack.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Hope you enjoyed this week's Reggae
text: Revelry Hour. This is Max filling in for
dialog: Rasta Ronnie, taking you out with a
dialog: little Bad Religion.
dialog: 
text: He puts in the CD, hits "Shuffle/Repeat," and leaves. The
text: caller request lines blink furiously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: TITLE CARD: white on black: "SUNDAY"
dialog: 
scene_heading: 22 INT. COMMON ROOM -- MAX'S SUITE - EVENING 22
dialog: 
text: Max's dormitory suite: four bedrooms off a common room, which
text: has three battered couches, a coffee table, and in a corner,
text: several small fridges and two televisions in a pile.
dialog: 
text: Christmas lights are still up. A neon `Guinness' sign dwarfs
dialog: it all.
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Max and Charles are here, standing, while Sam and Jen sit on
text: one couch and SCOTT and AMANDA sit on the other.
dialog: 
text: Charles puts on his gloves and coat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Max, you're coming and that's the end of
dialog: it. When's the last time you went to a
dialog: party?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Who cares? It's unnatural. If I went into
text: a stranger's house and ate their food
dialog: under any other circumstance, I'd be
dialog: arrested.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I'm not taking no. With Sam on board,
dialog: it's gonna be like old times.
dialog: 
text: He gestures at Sam, who stands. Unlike the hipster from
text: freshman year, Sam now resembles a middle-aged accountant.
text: There are bags under his eyes and square clothes on his back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah, I haven't been out with you guys in
dialog: ages.
dialog: 
text: Jen looks up from her magazine with disapproval.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: You're going out?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Aw, honey, just for a little while.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: You know I have to work until midnight.
dialog: It's not my fault the supervisor won't
dialog: let me out of it.
dialog: 
text: She glares. He teeters between his friends and his
text: girlfriend. His girlfriend wins. He sits back down, trying to
text: hide his disappointment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: She has a point, guys. I should catch up
dialog: on my chemistry reading anyway.
dialog: 
text: The guys roll their eyes, let down but unsurprised.
dialog: 
text: Across the room are SCOTT, perpetually poker-faced and
text: reserved, and AMANDA, understated, with the subdued manner of
text: a long-suffering wallflower.
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She sits off to the side, sneaking looks at Scott. He's
text: watching a golf-related infomercial.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: So Scott... How come you're not going out
dialog: with Charles and Max?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Can't go. Graphic design work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: Oh really? I have work, too, but it's
dialog: okay, I got a lot done today. What do you
dialog: have to do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Graphic design work.
dialog: 
text: TOMMY enters. He's preppier than anyone else, conservative
text: clothes capped off by a goofy smile and thick glasses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: What's up, all?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Tommy, at last. Save me from this lounge
dialog: lizard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Yeah, what are you doing tonight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
text: Physics lab. Fortunately, the semester's
text: just begun, so before the work piles up,
dialog: I can party. That's why the beginning of
dialog: the semester rules.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Great, so come party with me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I can't, I have physics work.
dialog: 
text: He disappears into his room. Charles takes Max's hat from a
text: hook, jams it on his head, and shoves him towards the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 23 INT. COLLEGE APARTMENT ­ LATER 23
dialog: 
text: A typically lame college party, still early in the night. The
text: furniture is "student budget modern" type. A jazz record
text: plays quietly, while pretentiously-dressed PARTY-GOERS sip
text: wine and eat cheese and crackers.
dialog: 
text: Max and Charles survey the room, drinks in hand.
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
text: Cheers to a new semester, full of
dialog: potential that will surely go to waste.
dialog: 
text: They toast.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: This is it, I'm telling you. This is the
dialog: semester I pass all my classes and meet
dialog: the dame of my dreams.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Good luck, and may she have a sister.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: More importantly, may she grant us our
dialog: occasional freedom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Ah, forget about Sam. I don't like it any
dialog: more than you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: He's become a total non-entity. Freshman
dialog: year, we were like Frank and Deano. Now
dialog: it's like Frank and freakin' Peter
dialog: Lawford.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Hey, he was one of my best friends. Now
text: we share a room and he's like a stranger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
text: Hottie at 3 o'clock. Keep an eye on her
dialog: for me so it doesn't look like I'm
dialog: interested.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah, right, then if you fail to sodomize
dialog: her, you'll blame me. Me, or Annie Hall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Look, all I said was, it would explain
dialog: our lives.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: The problem is, every crazy theory
dialog: explains something. I took a class last
dialog: semester with a professor who claimed
dialog: that the planet is being destroyed by
text: white, male, meat-eating capitalists.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: So? Everybody knows that.
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: But she had a theory that explained how:
dialog: apparently racism, sexism, socialism,
dialog: environmentalism, and vegetarianism are
dialog: all inherently linked. I brought a Big
dialog: Mac to the first class, and I thought I
dialog: was going to be the victim of a vegan-
dialog: socialist uprising.
dialog: 
text: Sam walks in and makes a beeline for the guys. Excitement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hey! I made it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I can't believe it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Wow, the laws of nature have stopped
dialog: working. Maybe I should try to meet some
dialog: chicks after all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: How'd you get away?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I told her I was going to the lab. She
dialog: doesn't mind if I'm working while she is.
dialog: How's the party?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Sucks. Who are they trying to be, with
dialog: this wine and cheese? What kind of party
dialog: doesn't even have beer?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I can get into this. It's better than
dialog: those frat parties. Check out the fox in
dialog: the beret.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Man, it's so good to be out. Between Jen,
dialog: homework, and labs, I hardly have time
dialog: for anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You could always change your major. You'd
dialog: have a lot more free time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I feel the same way about science that I
dialog: do about Jen. It's a lot of work, but
dialog: it's worth it.
speaker_heading: [MORE]
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I have doubts about both, actually. But
dialog: still, what could be dumber than changing
dialog: your major for a girl?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Changing your girl for a major.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Would you do it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It wouldn't be an issue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Of course not, when has studying ever
dialog: interfered with what's important, like
dialog: video hockey or your radio show that
text: nobody listens to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I meant, I'd have to have a girl first.
dialog: And lay off the radio show. There's a
dialog: reason I took the 3am slot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: And every time I see you doing homework,
dialog: you're taking a break. You're the best
dialog: I've ever seen when it comes to
text: procrastinating.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I should be, procrastination is one of my
dialog: favorite hobbies. Isn't it funny that my
dialog: two favorite hobbies rhyme?
dialog: 
text: Charles' expression turns sour as he looks across the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Oh, shit, Sara's here.
dialog: 
text: SARA, good-looking and excitable, arrives with a theatrical
text: flourish. Her age and manner indicate, among other things,
text: that she is a freshman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Ta-daaa! Hey guys, what's going on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (DEADPAN)
dialog: We were just talking about the mediocre
text: resonations of sub-hybrid fields.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I can't believe you think they're
dialog: mediocre. Those guys rock.
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: (doesn't get it, doesn't care)
dialog: Oh. Well, I just wanted to stop by and
dialog: say "hey" to my favorite guys. So hey!
dialog: How was everyone's break?
dialog: 
text: She is clearly talking to Charles, who is scanning the room
text: over her shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It could have been better but it could
dialog: have been worse. For me, that's good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Mine was great! I partied with my best
dialog: friend Melanie, who I haven't seen in
dialog: ages. Aren't these parties just the best?
dialog: So much better than the theater group
dialog: parties.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I dunno, it's a bunch of 21-year-olds who
dialog: want the 18-year-olds to know how mature
dialog: they are.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hey, Charles, you going to the fraternity
dialog: party after this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Ugh, no.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You gonna be back at your suite then?
dialog: Maybe I'll stop by.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Uh, yeah, we should be back in, uh, many
dialog: many hours.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Okay then, I'll catch up with you guys
dialog: later.
dialog: 
text: She tugs on Charles's shirt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (STAGE WHISPER)
dialog: I missed you.
dialog: 
text: She leaves.
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Shit, I was hoping to avoid her for at
dialog: least a few more days.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What do you have against her? She seems
dialog: nice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: First, she makes my skin crawl. Second,
dialog: if word gets out, it'll ruin my
text: reputation in the freshman dorms.
dialog: 
text: Sam looks to Max for the real story.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Never hook up with people in your cast.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I am a world-class knucklehead.
dialog: 
text: A pretty girl approaches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I'm sorry to interrupt, I thought I heard
dialog: one of you say "Max."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: One of us is Max.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
speaker_heading: (TO CHARLES)
dialog: Oh, great, just as I hoped. I just wanted
dialog: to say, I heard your radio show last week
dialog: and I thought it was great. Thoughtful
dialog: and poignant and funny, too. You know,
dialog: you look just like I imagined, too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'm Max.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'm Max.
speaker_heading: (SUDDENLY STRUCK)
dialog: Oh my God, you heard my show?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You're Max? Then who are you?
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Charles. I'm an actor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
speaker_heading: (TO MAX)
dialog: You okay? You look like you're in pain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You don't get it, I can't do my show if I
dialog: even suspect someone is listening. Now I
dialog: have to change time slots. Again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I'm sorry, I didn't realize I wasn't
dialog: supposed to listen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
speaker_heading: (INCONSOLABLE)
dialog: No, it's no good, the whole episode is
dialog: ruined. This is a disaster.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I work in theater a lot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Alright, listen. I was kidding. Your show
dialog: actually kind of sucked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Just kidding! It was awesome.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I also direct.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Uh, when did you tune in? I need to know
dialog: which episode you ruined.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: At one point you dialed a phone sex line.
dialog: It was hilarious. It's not every day
text: someone calls 1-900-4RIMJOBS to discuss
dialog: politics.
dialog: 
text: Sam quickly pulls Charles away as he starts to comment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: And she hung up. "This isn't the place
dialog: for that kind of talk..."
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Yeah, it's like, for four dollars a
dialog: minute, you should talk about whatever
dialog: you want. You know the country's in
text: trouble when a phone sex operator thinks
text: talking politics is beneath her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Perhaps she'd been screwed by
dialog: politicians. Phone sex is just pretend
dialog: but politics... I know my ass is still
dialog: sore.
dialog: 
text: He catches himself and falters. Julie notices something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Listen, I'm being flagged down by my over-
dialog: protective friends. It was nice meeting
dialog: you, though.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Wait, wait. How did you know about my
dialog: show?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Someone mentioned you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Anybody I know? Oh, duh, I guess it would
dialog: have to be someone I know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It was from a good source. I was told I'd
dialog: like you, but to really know you, I
dialog: should hear your show.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What, really?
dialog: 
text: She appraises him for a beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It was Beth.
dialog: 
text: And with that, she leaves. Max watches her, loses her in the
text: crowd. Something catches his eye across the room.
dialog: 
text: MAX'S POV: Sam is in a corner, trapped by an upset Jen. From
text: his gestures, he is on the defensive.
dialog: 
text: Charles moseys over.
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Check it. Jen traded shifts and got out
dialog: of work, so she went to the lab to
text: surprise Sam. He wasn't there, and
text: then Tommy gave away that he was here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
text: Busted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: And how. Let's bail before the beheadings
text: begin. Plus, The Rat Pack's on HBO later.
dialog: 
text: They put on their coats.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: How can you stand that show?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I told you, it's research. It's why I got
dialog: three phone numbers, Max, while you were
dialog: talking to that cutie.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 24 INT. COLLEGE APARTMENT STAIRWELL 24
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: "Cutie"?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: We just met. I was working up to it.

speaker_heading: (ON MACHINE)
dialog: Uh, hi, Max. Guess who? It's Beth. Been a
dialog: while, huh? Since that lunch last August
dialog: that somehow never happened. Anyway, uh,
dialog: just checking in, I guess. Hope your
dialog: break was okay. Uh, and----
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BEEEEEEEP. The machine cuts her off. Max sighs, picks up the
text: phone, dials.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Hello? Beth?... Sorry... Hello...? Hey, how's
dialog: it going?... Yeah, in person... Too long... So
dialog: anyway, I just wanted to say hi, and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Ow! Shit! Ow!
dialog:

speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: Jeeezzus! Shit, sorry you um...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: It's all right, this isn't the first time

dialog: not the naked one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: It's just that, I mean, I'm just
dialog: surprised to see you here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hmm, yeah, I must have shown up after you
dialog: came back, or something. I was planning
dialog: to go home, but I guess I fell asleep.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You all right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: She's around all the time! I chose to
dialog: live with my hombres, not her. She's got
dialog: to realize that we're not right for each
dialog: other and get on with her life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No, I mean, I thought I heard you fall or
dialog: something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Oh, what? I just stubbed my toe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That sucks. Bad way to start the day.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: The toe's the least of it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: This is funny, in a way. Yesterday you
dialog: were complaining about not having any
dialog: girls. Now you're complaining because you
dialog: have one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I know. It's a shame. And I was attracted
dialog: to her once, too. What happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Want me to tell you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: No! I think I've heard enough from the
dialog: Nostradamus of failed relationships to
dialog: last a lifetime.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Speaking of failed relationships, I was
dialog: thinking about your Annie Hall theory.
dialog: Specifically, I was thinking that you're
dialog: insane.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I said I was joking, so why do you keep
dialog: bringing it up?
dialog: 29.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It's like you insulted my religion. Like,
dialog: "Hey, Cardinal, I think Jesus might be
dialog: why you're not getting laid..."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Your attitude's too dour. You've gotta be
dialog: more fun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It's not my fault Annie Hall's honest
dialog: about the futility of romance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You're just a wuss. The very thought of
dialog: not seeing that movie scares you. You're
dialog: like a junkie, you need movie methadone.
dialog: Like, from now on you can only see
dialog: Manhattan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Forget it, I hate Manhattan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You think addicts like Methadone?

dialog: in hurricanes. I bet they think it's a
dialog: worthy issue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I just feel like there are other things
dialog: we could be talking about. You're the one
dialog: person I could rely on to say something
dialog: original.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Okay, okay.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: So, what classes are you taking?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: This was a mistake, wasn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What? No.
dialog: 
text: They stop in front of Frannie's, a small greasy spoon.

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Look, let's just call it a day. I was
dialog: excited to hear from you, but I can't
dialog: take you like this.
dialog: 
text: A COUPLE exit, the guy holds the door for them. They
text: hesitate. Suddenly, from inside:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (O.S.)
dialog: Max! Beth! Come sit with us!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No, I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. To
dialog: be honest, it's nice being with someone
dialog: besides my suitemates for a change.
dialog: 
text: They look in and see...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 28 INT. FRANNIE'S ­ CONTINUOUS 28
dialog: 
text: ...Charles, Scott, Amanda, Sam and Jen, seated around a huge

speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Oh my, God, Beth! It's great to see you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: It's been so long!
dialog: 
text: Everyone scoots over to make room. Max is still stunned but
text: has no choice. He sits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: How did we ever fall out of touch? We
dialog: shouldn't let that happen again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I know! I even miss this place. I live on
dialog: the wrong side of campus now. You guys
dialog: still come here? It's so dark and the
dialog: menu is tiny.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: It never changes, that's why.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (TO JEN)
dialog: What are you gonna get?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Maybe an omelet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Do you have to get eggs? I'm allergic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: So don't get the eggs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It's just that, it's the smell. It's the
dialog: smell that bothers me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Are you serious? How can you be allergic
dialog: to the smell of my eggs?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Don't worry about it, Jen. He's just
dialog: incredibly picky about food.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Even other people's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Look, if you're going to have eggs, let
dialog: me at least switch seats with Sam, so
dialog: I'll be farther away from it.
dialog: 32.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Max, what's up with you today? Join a
dialog: support group.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: If it really bothers you, why don't you
dialog: and Beth switch?
dialog: 
text: This would put Beth next to Charles. She looks at him and he
text: smiles. Unable to help herself, she smiles back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What about people at other tables? Should
dialog: we ask the management to stop serving egg-
dialog: products to people upwind of you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Why can't you just get along with
dialog: everyone for once?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Alright, alright, you win, we'll switch.
dialog: Come on, Beth, get up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
speaker_heading: (JOKINGLY)
dialog: What makes you so sure I'm gonna switch?
dialog: I don't think I'm gonna move.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Don't give in, Beth. I've got your back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You owe me. Remember when you threw that
dialog: egg at me in the dining hall?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Okay, I'll get up. But I'm ordering an

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Oh, hey. Yeah, I hate coming here this
dialog: time of day, but I need money. You know,
dialog: gambling debts and all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Aren't ATMs great? They save so much
dialog: time. Think about what life must have
dialog: been like before them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I can't support an acronym without
dialog: knowing what it stands for. I once joined
dialog: NAMBLA because I thought it was an animal

dialog: 
text: She laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: So, are you a junior, too?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I'm listed as a sophomore, but I've taken
text: some time off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What're you majoring in?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Why is that always the first question?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It was my second question.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: And how would you answer it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'd be honest. Oh, wait. Media Studies.
dialog: This week, I'm majoring in Media Studies.
dialog: I used to be a double-major, Renaissance
dialog: Footwear and Neurosurgery, but, ya know,
dialog: it was just too hard to get course credit
dialog: for watching movies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I bet. Me, I'm in Soc., but I'm leaning
dialog: toward Business, or Psych. Or Art
dialog: History.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Why don't you just be undeclared?
dialog: 34.

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Not my style.
dialog: 
text: Max's turn-- but he spots ANNIE HALL on the marquee.
text: Impulsively, he turns Julie to face him, so that her back is
text: to it. In doing so, he steps away from the ATM.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you okay? I thought you needed money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Uh, I forgot, my bookie takes checks now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Seriously, is everything okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Actually, yes. But I need something from
dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Your name.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It's Julie, no nickname. Don't even think
dialog: of calling me "Jewel."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Okay, Julie with no nickname, I, um, I'll
dialog: see you around?

speaker_heading: JULIE

text: Max, startled, fumbles open the tumbler.

speaker_heading: MAX

dialog: about what we hate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: I know. It's just sometimes, I wish...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah, I know.

speaker_heading: MAX

dialog: 
dialog: Julie is with ANDY and MARK. Andy is your basic hippie,

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Hey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Wassup.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: ...And Andy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Hey Max, how's it hanging, bud?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Fine. I, uh, really like your jacket. Is
dialog: that real carpet?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Yeah, man. I couldn't believe my luck
dialog: when I saw it. This shade of shag is,
dialog: like, so rare. I was like, woah...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Hey, are we gonna burn this or what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Yeah, man. Hey, you guys are like all
dialog: invited, if you can handle some kind bud...
dialog: "Maui wowey," you know?
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX

scene_heading: 38 INT. ANDY'S APARTMENT ­ A LITTLE LATER 38
dialog: 
text: Mark, Julie, and Max sit around a wooden table in a small

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Hey man, you like Zappa?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Dweezil or Moon Unit?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Frank.
dialog: (then gets it, laughs)
dialog: Man, that isn't even funny. You should
dialog: check out "Apostrophe" some time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: "Apostrophe"?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It's an album.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I thought he was correcting my grammar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Can I get anyone beers? Julie?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You know it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
text: Mark distributes beers to everyone but Max.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Sorry, Max, we don't have enough.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Uh, yeah, sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You want mine?
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No thanks. I'm kinda picky about beer.
dialog: I'm more into stuff like Guinness, Bass,
dialog: Killians.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
speaker_heading: (DISDAINFUL)
dialog: That's so... British.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It's a coincidence, I swear.
dialog: 
text: Julie has trouble opening her beer. Mark rushes over with his
text: keychain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I thought Guinness was going to be cool,
dialog: but it sucks. Made me nauseous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Dude, puking blows. That's why I smoke
dialog: weed. You get high right away and no
dialog: hangover!
dialog: 
text: Andy pulls out a baggie of marijuana, and rummages through
dialog: the closet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah, I don't know. Giving me pot is like
dialog: letting Richard Simmons smoke crack. I'm
dialog: paranoid enough as it is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yeah, well, some people just can't handle
dialog: their bud.
dialog: 
text: Mark glares disparagingly at him while Max pretends to
text: examine the ceiling. Julie pulls out cigarettes, lights up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Andy, what are you looking for?
dialog: 
text: Andy finds it: a gigantic bong made from a vacuum cleaner. He
text: sets it up on the counter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Wow. I bet you could use that for yard
dialog: work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Julie, you don't smoke either, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Really?
dialog: 49.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Yeah. I used to, but when it became my
dialog: social life I knew I needed to stop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Kind of like why I stopped playing
dialog: Dungeons and Dragons. It was, uh, in
dialog: sixth grade, but it was kind of similar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Why don't we go smoke in the living room?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
text: Oh, Ampersand's crashing on the couch
dialog: tonight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: "Ampersand"? What kind of name is that,
dialog: Esperanto?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Well, his name was Mike, but he couldn't
dialog: cope. He thought it was, like, too
dialog: square. He wanted a name that would tell
dialog: people, here is a person that only the
dialog: brave will understand! Here is a person
dialog: living beyond the walls!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
text: He must have been listening to
dialog: "Apostrophe" at the time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Or Prince, cuz, like, Prince's name was a
dialog: squiggly-thing. But Mike wanted something
dialog: powerful, meaningful, and above all,
dialog: something you could type. Therefore,
text: "Ampersand." It's already on the keyboard
dialog: and everything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: How much did that cost? Because I have a
dialog: friend who wants to change his name to
dialog: Not Bill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Is his name Bill?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No, Not Bill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What about originally?
dialog: 50.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Originally he wanted to change it to

speaker_heading: MARK

dialog: 
text: He's got an anchor on his right biceps. Max snickers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Gee, Mark, that's really cool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I know it's not what you suggested, but I
dialog: needed something more... masculine.

speaker_heading: MAX

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You just call me a hippie?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Sorry, Popeye, I guess I was thrown by
dialog: the Dave Matthews merchandise.

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Mark, lay off. Go take a hit off the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: No, well, a little, sure. But there are
dialog: always men around. During fire drills,
dialog: more guys come out than girls. Never the
text: same ones either. They come and go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I bet they do.
dialog: 
text: Julie catches herself and laughs. Max shares a smile with her

speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: Max!
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Uh, hi...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: It was great running into your friends,

speaker_heading: MAX

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: We're having dinner tonight. Wanna come?

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Don't put me in the middle of this. Are

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah, we're definitely broken up. I guess
dialog: sometimes it seems like we're sliding
dialog: back into our old patterns.

speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: It's not what you think. I need a

dialog: of Soc.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Well, there's a great local band playing

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Um, sure. Might be cool to catch a band
text: before success ruins them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Great. I'll see you there.

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: SCOTT

speaker_heading: AMANDA

dialog: 
text: An absurd metal band plays on-stage. The room is packed, and
text: the crowd is mostly one big mosh pit.
dialog: 
text: Max wades through the slamdancers, freaked. He makes it to
text: the coffee bar. Julie soon appears, sweaty. She's been here
dialog: awhile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Hey!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Oh, hey! It's good to see you.
dialog: 
text: The surging crowd shoves Max into Julie. They fall against
text: each other. Max is near panic but Julie's laughing, getting
text: off on the energy of the room.
dialog: 
text: The SINGER smashes the mic against the wall, then brandishes
text: the stand menacingly at the crowd, who step back in alarm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Who are these guys?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: They're Anhedonia. They're "sludge-core."

speaker_heading: SINGER
dialog: You're all a part of the conspiracy!
dialog: You're all human! Every one of you wore
dialog: diapers! You're all full of shit!
dialog: 
text: The singer storms off. The band follows. The crowd applauds
text: with some confusion. Julie whistles loudly and claps.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: That's their trademark. They insult the
text: crowd at the end of the set. Sometimes he
dialog: breaks the mike two songs in. We were
dialog: lucky: they played for almost 40 minutes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Luck had nothing to do with it.
dialog: 58.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Look, the mike's not even broken. They
dialog: were just tired of playing, but they
dialog: wanted to give us something to remember.
dialog: Now that's showmanship.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You have to wonder about any band whose
dialog: highlight is their exit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It worked for The Who.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'm sorry, the who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Ha ha. Come on, is that the kind of a
dialog: joke a celebrity DJ would make?

dialog: Don't worry about him, he isn't a threat.
dialog: You're far more interesting.
dialog: 59.
dialog:

dialog: There's this joke that sums it up for me...

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You're not fooling me, you know. I can
text: see right through this aloof image.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It's not an insult. I get the sense that
dialog: there's this whole other side of your

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I hope he's a better dancer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: See, this is the side you show, playing

dialog: Did I ever tell you about the bear and
dialog: the rabbit in the woods--?
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Now it's your turn, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Let's see. Okay, here's one: I have a
dialog: boyfriend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Fuck. I sure hadn't guessed that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Okay, well, not anymore. Eric and I were

text: over break.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Since high school, wow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Yeah. He's kind of a jerk. It was all a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (on the spot)
dialog: Uh, I have a friend who says it's because
dialog: I watch Annie Hall too much.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: That's crazy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Exactly. That film practically raised me.

speaker_heading: MANAGER

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Sure. I know this place. Their food is

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I've been able to do it since high
dialog: school.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: That's a scary gift. I mean, even if
dialog: people are destined to break up, the will
dialog: to stay together is very powerful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That's the real tragedy. Look at all the
text: unhappy couples in the world.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I don't know if your gift is really that
dialog: special, Max. I mean, we break up with
dialog: everyone we ever date... Until the one we
dialog: stay with forever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: See how ridiculous dating is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: How did you get this attitude if you love
dialog: Annie Hall?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What do you mean? That's what Annie's all
dialog: about.
dialog: 
text: Julie looks dubious. Max flicks on the radio.

speaker_heading: DJ

dialog: that's it for me.
dialog: (sound of CDs falling)
dialog: Whoops! Anyway, next up is Verbal

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Why is your radio set to the campus
dialog: station?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Actually, it's stuck on it. It's how I
dialog: first heard your show.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I thought Beth told you about me.

speaker_heading: JULIE

dialog: 
dialog: The kind of place that's perfect for Parents Weekend. At this

text: dance floor, where couples dance to the standards. Max and
text: Julie are at a table in the corner, looking out of place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
speaker_heading: (SMIRKING)
dialog: This is a nice place. Ritzy. Interesting
dialog: mix of people here, you've got these men
text: with their suits, taking their waitress
text: girlfriends out to impress them into bed,
dialog: because they can't get them any other
dialog: way. Really, as if a fast car can ever
dialog: make up for a small dick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: If it did, do you think I'd be here? I'd
text: be down at the Porsche dealer with a ski
text: mask and an Uzi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Guys, always obsessed with dick size.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Well, sure, there's that, but it would
dialog: also be nice to have a car with a heater.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Let's guess which couples are destined to
dialog: break up. How about them?
dialog: 
dialog: Indicates a COUPLE dancing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No, I can't tell just by looking. I need
dialog: some info.
dialog: 
text: Their waitress, DONNA, arrives.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Hi! Do you have a boyfriend?
dialog: 
text: Max is aghast. Donna stares a beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
speaker_heading: (TO MAX)
dialog: What do you need to know?
dialog: 64.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Uh, just a description.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Describe him for us. It's okay, I'm a
dialog: psyche major.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DONNA
text: Well, he's tall... ish. Brown hair. Funny.
dialog: Very friendly. Fixes cars. Close with his
dialog: brother. Uh, what else? Believes in God.
dialog: Has a sweet tooth. Uh...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That's plenty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: So can I take your order?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: We're not ready, thanks.
dialog: 
text: Donna puts her pad away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: So what was that all about then?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Max here thinks you're going to break up
dialog: with your boyfriend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Sorry. It's all in there. You qualified
dialog: "tall" so as not to make him appear too
dialog: handsome, said "friendly" like a
dialog: euphemism, chose "fixes cars" instead of
text: the more dignified "auto mechanic," and
dialog: finally, mentioned his brother á propos
dialog: of nothing, like you're threatened by
dialog: him.
dialog: 
text: The waitress looks like she's been slapped. After a pause,
text: she turns her back and walks away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Hey! Don't shoot the messenger!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'm such an idiot. She's going to shit in
dialog: our food now. I can't believe you asked
dialog: her that.
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Hey, we're all people here, right? If you
dialog: want to talk to someone, talk to them. I
dialog: don't spend my time trying to justify
dialog: talking to people or whatever. You limit
dialog: yourself if you do that. If you spend too
dialog: much time worrying, you don't spend
dialog: enough time living, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What are you, a fortune cookie?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You have to keep yourself open to
dialog: possibilities in life. I'm the first one
dialog: in my family to go to college. Sometimes
dialog: I can't believe I'm here, at a semi-
dialog: prestigious university getting a halfway-
dialog: decent education-- this has always been
dialog: my dream. How did you end up here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I had a coupon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I know what you mean, financial aid is a
dialog: bitch. And the university experience
dialog: itself is kind of disappointing. All
dialog: those rich students with no idea how
dialog: lucky they are. But I don't think about
dialog: them. I think about me, I think about
dialog: where I want to be someday: a world
dialog: traveler, running some huge company, or,
dialog: you know, doing some fantastically
dialog: important work. And when the day comes
dialog: that I can relax, I'm going to charter a
dialog: boat, sail around the world, and see the
dialog: Seven Wonders.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I thought they broke up when Stevie left.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Come on, aren't you curious about the
dialog: world? Doesn't the sheer scope of life
dialog: fill you with wonder?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Wonder, horror, it's such a fine line...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE

dialog: 
text: Max in CLOSE-UP. Over his shoulder, images of Beth arguing

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Even when Beth was part of the group, she
dialog: didn't fit in. Like, she never just lets
dialog: things be. She always has to know exactly
dialog: what I'm thinking. It was sort of cute
dialog: when we were friends, but now it's like a
dialog: proctology exam.
speaker_heading: (SIGHS)
dialog: Hard to imagine a friendship going more
dialog: wrong.
dialog: 
text: The image of Beth STOPS on a shot of her looking at him with

text: Julie, beaming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah, but Julie. Juliejuliejulie. She's
dialog: smart, she's funny, isn't constantly
dialog: hassling me. How she can stay such a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah. This is a real change of pace.
dialog: Staying away from Annie Hall is like some
dialog: kind of magic trick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I was wondering about that. You seem
dialog: different lately.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You know how when things are going badly,
dialog: there are certain parts I like to watch?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Like how you spent your whole sophomore

dialog: repeat?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I realized that I don't know what part to
dialog: watch when things are going well.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You know, I actually regret mentioning
dialog: that theory. In fact, Sam and I were
dialog: thinking of watching it tonight. You in?

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Are you on crack? I meet a girl I really
dialog: like, that I may actually have a chance
dialog: with, and you want me to put it all in
dialog: jeopardy?

speaker_heading: BETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you okay?

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah, why?

speaker_heading: BETH

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Who is he with? He never calls me
dialog: anymore. I think he might be seeing
dialog: someone. Have you heard anything?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I don't even know him. What's so special

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Sort of. Well, no, I guess not.
speaker_heading: (DISTRACTED)
dialog: I know something's going on. I'm such a
dialog: fool. Why are we always attracted to
dialog: people that are completely wrong for us?
dialog: Is it because they excite us?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I guess so. You know, we should try to be
dialog: more exciting. Like the other day, I
dialog: waited until the last minute before
dialog: returning a video. And next time, I swear
dialog: I'm not going to rewind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Really?

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah, the agencies won't leave her alone.

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I just got my textbooks for this term.

text: Max holds up a thick book, Post-Modern Semiology. The entire

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Holy shit.

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Was she alone?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Not if you count this huge purse she had.
text: She was rummaging through it and finally
dialog: had to dump the thing out. I swear, I'm
text: surprised Kennedy's brain didn't fall out
dialog: of that thing. Anyway, it made me think
dialog: of Annie Hall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Oh, great.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
text: Although Julie dresses better.
dialog: 
text: Max slowly lowers his controller.

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: CHARLES

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I didn't say that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I don't want to like someone because she
text: reminds me of someone in a movie. Now I'm
dialog: wondering why I like her. Maybe I don't.

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Good Lord, Max. Take some harder classes.

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Great game.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No. I don't know how to play it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: MAX

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Yeah, a little. This semester isn't

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Well, you know. Nothing even worth

speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Look at my life. Look at this thing with
dialog: Julie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Jeez, she's not like Annie when the film
text: starts, she's like Annie at the end. Or
dialog: maybe, the Millennium Edition.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: The worst part is, maybe I knew this all
dialog: along.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Max, what's really the problem here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: And Annie Hall's not even my type.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You have a type?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'm into bipeds with most of their teeth.
dialog: No Lutherans or fictional characters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Who would you rather sleep with, Julie or
dialog: Annie Hall?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That's not two choices, that's one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Okay, Annie Hall or me?
dialog: 
text: Max knocks over her soda.

speaker_heading: BETH (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I'll take what I can get.
dialog: 81.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It's only because you'd laugh at more of

dialog: dimension-- you'd be laughing with me in
dialog: addition to at me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You joke while you're in bed?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: That's so weird.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'm weird.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: No, it's weird because I do the same

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Girls think I'm a loser.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Julie doesn't. And you really like her.

speaker_heading: MAX

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Six pages? That's nothing. Triple spaced,
dialog: in 14 point type, that's only like 500
dialog: words. If a picture's worth a thousand

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Don't worry about it, I needed a break.

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What are you, from Maine?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Shit, I'm sorry.

speaker_heading: MAX

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Yeah. I've spent my life learning how to
dialog: be a student, and at the end of the
dialog: semester it will all be useless.
dialog: Everybody already wants to know what I'm
dialog: going to do, and I have no idea. I
dialog: started making up stories to tell people.
dialog: An aunt asked me if I'm excited about
dialog: Chicago, and I couldn't remember if I'd
dialog: said I was moving to the city or going to

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Something that pays the bills.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: My grandfather once told me that if you

text: He whirls on her.

speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: We make you sick? Sam, say something to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why should I? We've made him sick for

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: MAX
speaker_heading: (FEEBLY)

speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: College is a great opportunity. It's

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Yeah, it's about avoiding the real world

speaker_heading: CHARLES

speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Some of us work really hard to get
dialog: through school.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Look, my parents worked their whole lives
dialog: to give me the opportunity to be here.
dialog: But the truth is, private schools like
dialog: ours make money by showing students a
dialog: good time for four years. It's bullshit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: You think social work is bullshit?
dialog: 100.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: How can you say that? Annie Hall is so
dialog: uplifting!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Listen, since the other night, I've been
dialog: doing some thinking...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: There's your mistake. Mindless happiness
dialog: is always better than thoughtful
dialog: reservation. Unless you're talking about
text: nude bungee jumping.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I don't think that this is a good time
dialog: for us to jump, or leap, or whatever, you
dialog: know, together. Into a relationship.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: But, but... we just saw a movie about how
dialog: relationships are worth it, no matter

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Did we?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah, I guess we really did.

text: Max covers his face, breathes deep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Are you okay? Will you please calm down?
dialog: I like you very much, but I told you, I
dialog: just got out of a serious relationship,
dialog: and it ended really badly. We saw each
dialog: other almost every day at the beginning,
dialog: but by the end of the semester, I hadn't
dialog: seen him in a month. He stopped returning
dialog: my calls and stuff, and I mean, he
dialog: basically avoided me, then I heard he was
dialog: seeing one of my friends.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: But that was him, not me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It's nobody's fault, I know. I mean, I've
dialog: been trying but it's hard. Relationships
dialog: are very difficult to maintain. There are
dialog: so few successful couples.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What's successful? Like, my parents have
dialog: been married thirty years, but--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: My parents are divorced.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Okay, bad example. But why think ahead?

speaker_heading: JULIE

dialog: 108.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You told it the night of our date. I hate
dialog: that joke, Max. It's not a philosophy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: But I think I know what it means now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Yeah, and it's dreary and depressing,
dialog: right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Not this time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: No?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
speaker_heading: (INTIMATELY)
dialog: Beth, I just want to say, before it's all
dialog: over and I don't have the chance, that
dialog: I'm sorry. For everything. Last semester
dialog: and last year.
dialog: 
text: Beth is speechless; she never though she'd ever hear that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: You mean the world to me, and I was an
dialog: idiot to throw it away. You were right:
dialog: if I can't be a friend to you, how could
dialog: I be a boyfriend? I've done a lot of
dialog: things wrong, and I've been confused as
dialog: hell, but I think it's time for a change.
dialog: 
text: Beth looks him over, as if for the first time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Really.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Then allow me to recommend a movie that
dialog: you've never seen before. It's called
dialog: Annie Hall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I was going to see it tonight. Do you
dialog: want to join me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I would love to, but I think you need to
dialog: do this alone.
dialog: 109.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No, you're right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: But I'll see you later?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Sure. After the movie, I'm doing my last
dialog: radio show. It's going to be all
dialog: requests. You should tune in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: The end of an era.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
text: The start of a new one.
dialog: 
text: He smiles and walks away. The fog begins to obscure him.
dialog: 
text: Beth opens her backpack and removes a Walkman. She hits POWER
text: and the LED changes from TAPE to RADIO.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: And that's how I let go of her. Although,
dialog: it's probably more honest to say that she
text: let go of me. Julie, Beth, and Annie.
dialog: Three women in my life and I was
text: desperate for one.
dialog: 
text: REVERSE ANGLE. Beth stands alone, watching him go. She snaps
text: the headphones over her ears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: Of course, I saw her again. It's a small
dialog: campus. The last time was at a film
dialog: festival. We're better friends now then
dialog: ever, and there's always a chance we can
dialog: have some kind of future together. So
dialog: far, so good.
dialog: 
text: Finally, Beth turns and walks away.
dialog: 
text: CUT BACK TO: Max still walking, getting smaller and smaller.
text: Soon all we see is fog.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: She'll always mean a lot to me, and it's
text: nice to run into her and reminisce about
dialog: what we, ya know, went through. It was a
dialog: weird period of my life. I mean, shit, I
dialog: really got off track there, didn't I?
