dialog: 
text: A perfect rainbow is trapped inside two flawless DIAMONDS,
text: glinting in the morning sun.
dialog: 
text: Tounted on crushed velvet, the identical diamonds are on a glass
text: covered pedal stool in the middle of a vast, marble MUSEUM HALL.
dialog: 
text: The stunning beauty of the stones is matched only by the
text: breathtaking beauty of the young woman who's admiring them. MARIE
text: CLIFFORD's creamy seventeen year old skin is dappled in the
text: cornucopia of colors emanating from the diamonds...
dialog: 
text: She reaches out tentatively towards the glass case. Not to touch
text: the diamonds, but to run her fingers over a picture that's mounted
text: in the case below the priceless jewels. It's of a MOTHER cradling
text: her BABY DAUGHTER...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Today's the day, Mom...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURATOR (O.S.)
dialog: You here again, Marie?
dialog: 
text: Marie spins round, sees the bespectacled CURATOR, 60's, standing
text: behind her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
text: Just leaving.
dialog: 
text: Marie carefully adjusts the sign atop the glass case...
dialog: 
text: 'THE MOTHER DAUGHTER DIAMONDS...'
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MUSEUM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Marie fires up her powerful BMW, parked right outside the austere
text: Museum building. The powerful stereo blasts, sending the birds
text: fluttering skywards...
dialog: 
text: CREDITS appear over...
dialog: 
text: ARIEL FOOTAGE of a narrow highway, Marie's BMW streaking through
text: the endless tract of Florida wetlands. In the water, GATORS, warm
dialog: themselves in the early morning sun...
dialog: 
text: MOVING over the vast tracts of swampland, flocks of tropical BIRDS
text: stretch their majestic wings, locals speed across the stagnant
text: waters in their deafening AIRBOATS...
dialog: 
text: Through thick trees and foliage to trailer homes and tract housing
text: and into the town of Blue Bay, where the nip/tucked denizens sip
text: three martini lunches and tee off at the local country club.
dialog: 
dialog: 03/22/2004 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Marie steers her BMW into the showroom-like parking lot of Blue
dialog: Bay High School.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MARIE'S BMW - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Marie guides her powerful car towards her parking spot, when...
dialog: 
text: SCCCREEEECCCHHHH!
dialog: 
text: She SLAMS on the brakes as a figure darts in front of her car.
text: Almost gives her a heart attack, throwing her forward, flailing
text: arms crashing into the stereo, then snapped back by her seatbelt.
dialog: 
text: She sits stock still for a second, then looks up, out of her
text: windshield at the young woman scouring at her, only inches from
text: the front bumper of the BMW.
dialog: 
text: The sudden jolt has changed the radio station. A newscaster
text: rambles on...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
dialog: ... operation, aimed at finally capturing
dialog: the Black Widow suspect after a six month
dialog: trail of embezzlement and fraud, once
text: again failed to snare its subject.
dialog: 
text: ELENA SANDOVAL, 17, stands defiantly in front of the BMW, her
text: don't-fuck-with-me stare in direct contrast with her come-fuck-me
dialog: clothes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
dialog: Blue Bay Police Detective Michael
dialog: Morrison was able to recover over
dialog: $400,000 in stolen money, but the
dialog: suspect, described as Female, between
text: eighteen and thirty, remains at large...
dialog: 
text: Marie reaches out with a trembling hand, turns off the stereo,
text: then leans out of the car window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I'm... so... sorry...
dialog: 
text: Elena smiles wryly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: You will be.

scene_heading: INT. BLUE BAY HIGH AUDITORIUM - MORNING
dialog: 
text: The auditorium is packed with the Blue Bay High student body. The
text: natural order is clear, the pastel flock at the front, the meat
text: headed jocks in the center, and the rejects at the back.
dialog: 
text: Marie is amongst her sweater monkey friends, but she's still
text: shocked by what happened out in the parking lot...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (handing over a present)
dialog: Happy birthday, babe. They ain't
dialog: diamonds, but you're just gonna have to
dialog: wait for those...
dialog: 
text: Marie tentatively opens the gift, sees a pair of OPAL EARRINGS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (unconvincing)
dialog: Thank you. Thank you so much...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Are you OK, hon?
dialog: 
text: Marie looks back, to the far reaches of the auditorium where the
text: freaks and geeks crowd round Elena, worshipping her like the
dialog: Goddess she is...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I...yeah...I'll be fine...It's
dialog: just...that new girl...I almost hit her
text: in the parking lot...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You mean the towel girl, the one who
dialog: transferred in? Jesus, she's trouble. You
dialog: know the only reason she's slinging
dialog: towels is 'cos it's court ordered...
dialog: 
text: Marie and Elena make brief, electric eye contact, across the sea
text: of hormonally challenged students as Principal LIONEL MOSSTER, his
text: ill-fitting sports jacket coffee-stained, steps onstage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOSSTER
dialog: We're here today to address a growing
dialog: epidemic that affects all of you.
dialog: 
text: He pauses, waits for the student body to quiet down...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOSSTER
dialog: National studies report sexual activity
text: among students at an all-time high.
dialog: 
dialog: 03/22/2004 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The students all cheer, naturally.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOSSTER
dialog: We'll see who's cheering when you've got
dialog: an unwanted pregnancy on your hands, or
dialog: get slapped with a paternity suit...Or
dialog: arrested for date rape. But don't take my
dialog: word for it...
dialog: 
text: He motions behind him to KRISTEN RICHARDS, early 30's, a natural
text: beauty who's doing her best to hide behind a bland gray suit and
text: glasses, and CHAD BORMAN, late 20s, devilishly handsome...
dialog: 
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MOSSTER
dialog: Miss Richards and Dr. Borman are here to
dialog: tell you about the pitfalls first hand...
dialog: 
text: Kristen steps up to the lectern.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Good morning, my name is Kristen
dialog: Richards. I'm an officer for the Miami
dialog: juvenile parole board, as some of you
dialog: already know...
dialog: 
text: Quick glance at Elena who rolls her eyes...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: But that's not what brings me here today.
dialog: When I heard about Principal Mosster's
dialog: sex education program I thought I'd
dialog: volunteer my own personal story, in hopes
dialog: that you might learn from the mistakes I
dialog: made. Back in High school all I wanted to
dialog: do was get drunk, stoned and laid...
dialog: 
text: The students roar their approval.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: By my junior year, my life was a blur of
text: cheap beer, anonymous sex, partying every
dialog: night of the week...
dialog: 
text: Elena covers her mouth, as if to cough...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: (through fake coughs)
dialog: ...whore...
dialog: 
text: Kristen ignores the slur.
dialog: 
dialog: 03/22/2004 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: And then, one night at some pathetic frat
dialog: party, someone slipped a roofie in my
dialog: drink...and raped me.
dialog: 
text: This quiets the auditorium.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: There isn't a day goes by my skin doesn't
dialog: crawl when I think of the violation and
dialog: humiliation I endured. I can promise you
dialog: that if you make the same kind of wrong-
dialog: headed choices I did, you'll be seeing
dialog: Dr. Borman...
dialog: 
text: Chad steps to the podium.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: Thank you, Miss Richards. My name's Dr.
dialog: Chad Borman. I run the forensics lab at
dialog: the police department, where my work has
dialog: helped convict hundreds of sex offenders.
dialog: Most teens like Ms. Richards never get
dialog: their lives together. The physical scars
dialog: may go away, but the emotional damage
dialog: stays forever.
dialog: 
text: While Chad drones on, MUDDY, a Gremlin-eyed drooler, sitting in
text: front of Elena, looks back at her shapely legs as she puts them up
text: on the back of the chair. He spots the ugly plastic bracelet
text: locked around one of her ankles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: That's not...what I think it is, is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Whattchya think it is, bitch?
dialog: 
text: The words catch in his throat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: One of them...Parole leashes...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Bingo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: So you can't, like, go more than ten
dialog: miles from the cop shop?
dialog: 
text: Elena taps the flashing red light on the plastic bracelet.
dialog: 
dialog: 03/22/2004 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Five. I got someone's panties in a bunch.
dialog: 
text: Back at the podium, Chad leans forward, making sure his words
text: resonate with the student body.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: And as for the perpetrators of this
dialog: heinous act, even if you are still a
dialog: minor, you will be tried as an adult,
dialog: and, if convicted, you will do hard time.
dialog: 
text: He pauses to let the impact of this wash over the students.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: Are there any questions?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Yeah, I got one for Miss Richards.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Ask away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: When they found the scumbag who took your
dialog: precious flower of virginity, you sued
dialog: his sorry ass, right?
dialog: 
text: Kristen is taken aback by Elena's insensitivity, stumbles over her
text: words, finally spitting out the sad, sorry truth...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Uh, no, actually, I was never able to
dialog: make a positive ID. All I remember was
text: his alcohol-soaked breath whispering in
dialog: my ear, "You won't remember, but you'll
dialog: never forget..."
dialog: 
text: Elena cracks a sideways grin...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: So what you're really saying is you
dialog: fucked for free...
dialog: 
text: Kristen has no answer to that. Principal Mosster does his best to
dialog: control the situation...
dialog: 
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MOSSTER
dialog: Miss Sandoval. You're on thin ice, young
dialog: lady!
dialog: 
text: Like Elena cares. She leans back, nods. Job done.

scene_heading: EXT. BLUE BAY HIGH DIVING POOL - DAY
dialog: 
text: The bright Florida sunshine washes down on packed bleachers by the
text: side of the massive diving pool, where a diving meet is in full
dialog: swing...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: Blue Bay High School would like to
dialog: welcome all participating diving teams
dialog: from the tri-county region...
dialog: 
text: Breathtaking beauties from teams all over the region, in their
text: school colored bikinis, are scattered around the pool area.
dialog: 
text: But all eyes are on the home team. Masturbatory fantasies abound
text: as the Blue Bay Girls' Diving Team runs through stretches...
dialog: 
dialog: And as exquisite as these girls are, they pale in comparison to
text: absolutely sweet Marie, stunning in her nearly see-through white
dialog: bathing suit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: First up, district champion Marie
dialog: Clifford...
dialog: 
text: The crowd cheers, watching Marie edge out to the diving platform
text: twenty feet above. Jenny right behind, waits on the ladder...
dialog: 
text: JAY CLIFFORD, Marie's chisel-jawed stepfather in his late
text: thirties, focuses a DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA on Marie from the front
text: row of the bleachers...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: C'mon now baby, you can do it...
dialog: 
text: Marie just rolls her eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Your stepfather's just got a lot invested
dialog: in the team.
dialog: 
text: Marie looks at her stepfather, nods tentatively, but then notices
text: the incongruous figure of Elena, sidling up to him...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to Marie)
dialog: Just try to keep those legs together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA (O.S.)
dialog: Shouldn't be a problem for Miss teen
dialog: Virgin.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 03/22/2004 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jay looks round, lowers the camera when he comes face to face with
dialog: the world's hottest towel girl...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Excuse me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: You're Mr. Clifford, right? As in
dialog: Clifford construction?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: I am, yes, but...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I'd love to see one of your erections...
dialog: 
text: Whoa. Jay's lost for words as he diverts his attention to the
text: platform where Marie stands perfectly still before stepping into
dialog: the air.
dialog: 
text: It's a spectacular sight as the beautiful Marie completes a double
text: back flip, entering the water with near-perfect form. She quickly
text: resurfaces, climbs out of the pool and exchanges high fives with
text: her teammates before crossing to Jay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Nice take off, gotta work on the
dialog: landing...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I can't do any better...
dialog: 
text: Jay shakes a finger at her, silences her immediately.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: No such word as 'can't. Now do it again.
dialog: Only better...
dialog: 
text: Marie takes a deep breath, approaches the ladder once more. As
text: she's about to start the arduous climb, Elena hands her a towel...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Bet you choke.
dialog: 
text: Stops Marie in her tracks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: What's your major malfunction?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Just wanted to make a wager. Between best
dialog: friends.
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Marie just starts to climb the ladder to the high dive platform.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: You blow this dive, I get those diamonds
dialog: of yours.
dialog: 
text: Marie stops, looks down on Elena from the fifth rung of the
text: ladder, shakes her head...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: How'd you know about my inheritance?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Talk of the town, birthday girl. Today's
dialog: the day, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: And what, pray tell, are you willing to
dialog: wager when I win?
dialog: 
text: Elena thinks for a second, glances back at Jay with a big smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I'll stay away from your stepfather. You
dialog: make it, I won't be your new stepmom
dialog: anytime soon. Whattya say?
dialog: 
text: Marie just stands there incredulous for a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Take your sorry ass back to the swamps.
dialog: 
text: She ascends the ladder, leaving Elena behind...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Choke!
dialog: 
text: Marie clambers up onto the high dive platform, tries to focus on
text: the task at hand. But can't help but notice her nemesis below,
text: walking slowly, seductively, up to Jay, intoxicating him...
dialog: 
text: Marie blocks out the distraction, concentrates at the task at
text: hand, stepping to the edge of the platform and the 20 foot drop
dialog: looming beyond...
dialog: 
text: She slides a ring off her finger, kisses it for luck. It's an odd
text: design. Four curved gold ridges, just ready to hold a Diamond...
dialog: 
text: She throws the ring into the pool ahead of her, the gold glinting
text: in the afternoon sunlight as it drops into the water, and a split
text: second before it breaks the surface, Marie is airborne...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 03/22/2004 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She twists magnificently through the air, a sight of breathtaking
dialog: beauty. Thank God this is in slow motion.
dialog: 
text: And as she gets ever closer to the water's surface, she tucks,
text: does one last back flip, straightening out at the last possible
text: instant, slicing through the water with nary a splash.
dialog: 
text: Marie surfaces to roaring APPLAUSE. Treading water, she can't help
text: but watch her Jay's smiling face in the bleachers...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CLIFFORD MANSION - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Sickeningly expensive POWERBOATS and de-rigged SCHOONERS line the
text: inlet leading to the verdant lawns of the Clifford Mansion...
dialog: 
text: Banners and streamers wishing Marie a happy birthday decorate the
text: grounds. Partygoers soak in the blazing Florida sun, sip at non-
text: alcoholic punch, and stare out gratefully across the thin stretch
text: of water that separates them from the riff-raff on the mainland...
dialog: 
text: Marie sits away from it all, lost in thought, as Jenny, in cutoffs
text: and a bikini top, sidles up beside her.
speaker_heading: J
speaker_heading: ENNY
dialog: What's the matter, sweetie, pissed that
dialog: one judge only gave you a 9.7?
dialog: 
text: Marie forces a smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Nah. I'm cool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, babe.
dialog: You got diamonds on the mind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY (O.S.)
dialog: Have either of you seen my video camera?
dialog: 
text: Marie looks round to her stepfather, shakes her head, bringing a
text: bemused look to Jay's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: I had it at the dive meet, I'm sure...
dialog: 
text: He shrugs, picks up a crystal glass, hits a fork sharply against
text: it, drawing the attention of the assembled partygoers...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Ladies, Gentlemen, friends, raise a glass
text: to Marie, on her eighteenth birthday.
dialog: 
text: Everyone raises their fine crystal.

speaker_heading: JAY
text: She's become every inch of the woman her
dialog: Mother hoped she'd be. Wherever she is
text: now, Julie's looking down and smiling.
dialog: 
text: Tears well in Marie's eyes...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: And that's why, on your eighteenth
dialog: birthday, Marie, I know your mother
dialog: wanted you to have...
dialog: 
text: He notices, out of the corner of his eyes, two well-dressed MEN
text: standing at the entrance to his house. Whoever they are, Jay's
text: instantly unnerved. He stumbles over his words...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: ... she wanted you to have... a wonderful
dialog: birthday party surrounded by all your
dialog: friends.
dialog: 
text: e glances back toward the house, watching the two men enter...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Please excuse me.
dialog: 
text: ... and hurries after them. Marie is left dumbfounded. So close,
dialog: but so far...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Jay! What about my present?
dialog: 
text: She chases after him...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CLIFFORD MANSION HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Marie makes her way down the sleek white corridors inside the
text: opulent Clifford Mansion, past framed family photos, of Jay, Marie
dialog: and the late Julie...

speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Jay?
speaker_heading: H
text: e's nowhere to be found. Frustrated, Marie finds herself alone in
text: the kitchen. She angrily selects a bottle of Champagne, pops the
text: cork. Before she can swig any alcohol she hears raised voices.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY (O.S.)
dialog: It simply can't be done...
dialog: 
text: Marie tentatively edges out of the kitchen, back into the hallway,
text: and down towards Jay's study...
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: In all construction there's delays.
dialog: 
text: Marie sidles up to the door jam, peaks through the crack. What she
text: sees makes the blood run cold in her veins...
dialog: 
text: An imposing Cuban businessman, MR. BARAJAS, stands threateningly
text: over a visibly frightened Jay. Another man, CICATRIZ, dressed in
text: designer silks, stands menacingly in the corner, clearly the brawn
dialog: of this little operation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BARAJAS
dialog: Four months is not a delay. It's a
dialog: disaster.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: You have my word, Mr. Barajas, the
dialog: building is almost finished. Just give me
dialog: a week, two tops.
dialog: 
text: Barajas nods to Cicatriz, who moves in on Jay with lightning
text: quickness, holds a Razor sharp KNIFE against his thumb.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BARAJAS
dialog: We are long past the negotiation stage.
dialog: 
text: Cicatriz runs the steel blade across Jay's thumb. Marie has to
text: cover her mouth from screaming as she sees a trickle of blood
text: stain the spotless white carpet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BARAJAS (CONT'D)
dialog: For every day the building goes
dialog: unfinished, we'll take a finger...
dialog: 
text: A sinister grin stretches across Cicatriz's lips.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CICATRIZ
dialog: Pray, Mr. Clifford, you finish before the
dialog: eleventh day...
dialog: 
text: And with that the Cuban men head to the door. Marie scrambles
text: away, her heart pounding...
dialog: 
text: She's halfway down the hallway when Mr. Barajas and Cicatriz exit
text: Jay's study. She turns, tries to look innocent as the Cuban
dialog: 'businessmen' stare her down.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to Marie)
dialog: I'll be right there. With your gift...

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CLIFFORD MANSION - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Marie stumbles down the lawns, past the semi-clad partygoers, in a
text: daze, as she takes hits from the bottle of champagne.
dialog: 
text: Jenny and the dive team wait by the dock, and welcome their lost
text: sheep with open arms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: So? Did you get the key? Are you Blue
dialog: Bay's richest bitch?
dialog: 
text: Marie's thoughts are drowned out by the ROAR of a powerful engine.
text: All attention turns to a rusted MOTORCYCLE as it streaks across
text: the verdant lawns, leaving a spray of MUD in its wake.
dialog: 
text: nd atop the bike... Elena, in skintight leathers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Holy shit, who invited her?
dialog: 
text: Marie's slightly drunken eyes narrow. Elena brings the bike to a
text: screeching halt inches from the surprised guests. The ultimate
dialog: partycrasher...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: This is a private party...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Don't mind me. I ain't here for your
dialog: stupid party.
dialog: 
text: She's striding towards the Mansion, towards Jay who's standing at
text: the patio doors, an exquisitely wrapped present in his hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Get the hell outta here! NOW!
dialog: 
text: Marie stumbles after Elena, grabbing her from behind, holding her
text: back. There's a tense moment before...
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Damn girl, whattcha been drinking?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Stay away from my stepfather!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Make me...
dialog: 
text: And that's it. Marie lashes out with a haymaker punch. Connects on
text: Elena's jaw and she goes reeling back. But it's ignited the street
text: fighter in her, and she comes roaring back into the fray, ramming
text: into Marie and together they tumble to the ground...
speaker_heading: T
text: he crowds gather to watch the cat-fight, in equal parts appalled
text: and aroused. It's a hair pulling, teeth gnashing, make up smearing
text: wrestling match, no holds barred. The drunken Marie has the upper
text: hand, the alcohol fueling her rage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY (O.S.)
dialog: What the hell's going on here?
dialog: 
text: And that stops the fight right there and then. Marie looks up to
text: see a red faced Jay standing over her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: This...trash is just looking for a meal
dialog: ticket...
dialog: 
text: Elena gets to her feet, licks the blood from her split lip.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Mr. Clifford. Betcha proud of little
dialog: Marie now, huh?
dialog: 
text: He hauls Marie to her feet, thrusts her towards the mansion.

speaker_heading: JAY
text: Party's over.
dialog: 
text: Groans from the crowd, but Jay's mind is made up.

dialog: 
text: Inside are stacks of CASH, piled high, along with a shiny new

speaker_heading: JAY

speaker_heading: ELENA (O.S.)

speaker_heading: JAY

speaker_heading: ELENA

speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Enough's enough. I think it's time you

speaker_heading: ELENA

speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Gimme the camera back...
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Come get it.
dialog: 
text: Jay's reaching his elastic limit. He reaches for the camera, but
text: Elena won't let go. They wrestle for control of the video camera.
text: And finally the camera slips from both their grasps, flies across
text: the room and SHATTERS on the concrete floor...

speaker_heading: MARIE

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY
dialog: 
text: The deafening roar of an air boat cutting through dense sawgrass,
text: speeding across the endless swampland expanse. Elena expertly
text: maneuvers the machine, the wind racing through her hair...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SWAMP ROAD - DAY
dialog: 
text: Chad's speakers blare out heavy metal as his rusty DAEWOO bangs
text: down the desolate swamp dirt road through the thick trees. Every
text: hundred feet or so, the road runs parallel with the water, then
text: cuts back into the trees.
speaker_heading: C
text: had spots an Air Boat not more than a few hundred yards from him.
text: He does a double take just as the road disappears back into the
dialog: trees. That wasn't...it couldn't be, could it?
dialog: 
text: The winding dirt road crosses back to swampside and Chad's worst
text: fears come true...Elena's racing along side of him in the AIRBOAT,
dialog: fighting to keep up...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Pull over!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHAD'S CAR - DAY
dialog: 
text: The road runs parallel to the swamp again and Chad's eyes nearly

speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Give us back the diamonds!

speaker_heading: HIM!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: FUCKING HELL!
dialog: 
text: He yanks the steering wheel hard left, swerves his car clean off
text: the dirt road and into the thick swathe of Melaluca trees, Marie's
text: BMW shoots past, missing his car by inches...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MARIE'S BMW - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Marie slams on her brakes, brings her BMW to a skidding halt on
text: the dirt road. She looks back over her shoulder, at the swaying
text: Melaluca trees. No sign of Chad's car...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SWAMPSIDE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Elena brings the airboat to rest at swamp side, leaps into the
text: reeds and clambers up to the dirt road. There's no sign of Chad's
text: car, just a hole in the dense undergrowth where it ploughed
dialog: through...
dialog: 
text: Marie comes running up to join Elena, a tire iron in hand...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: (sternly)
dialog: We're not hurting him, Marie, got it? We

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I

dialog: 
text: Marie stalks down the path Chad's car took off the dirt road...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I'm gonna kill him.
dialog: 
text: Elena's breath catches in her throat. Marie disappears into the
text: trees and she's alone, out on the deserted swamp road...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Marie! Don't do this...
dialog: 
text: She hears a scream, a girl's scream...

speaker_heading: ELENA

speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: You okay?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: No, I'm pretty damn far from okay...
dialog: 
text: She points to the front seat of the crashed car...
dialog: 
text: Elena can barely bring herself to look inside. Marie shoves her in

dialog: I appreciate the help...

speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Right back at ya.

speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: You could have a helluva holiday on that

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE

dialog: Gotcha...

scene_heading: EXT. SWAMP - DAY
dialog: 
text: Chad's face is drained of color as he runs through the dense
text: swampland, hugging the priceless diamonds. Sweat cascades from his
text: brow, and thick plumes of blood from wounds all over his body
text: swirl in the stagnant waters...
dialog: 
text: Most gruesome of all is a broken TURN SIGNAL embedded in his right
text: leg. As the water gets knee-deep, the last of Chad's reserve
text: energy goes. He collapses in the stagnant marsh.
dialog: 
text: Not far off, GATORS circle. It's only a matter of time before they
text: notice the blood in the water.

speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Call it off, Marie. We gotta go or
dialog: she'll find us here...
dialog: 
text: A splashing sound from up ahead silences both girls...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: You hear that?
dialog: 
text: The sound echoes off the dense trees. Marie points left.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE

scene_heading: INT. KRISTEN'S CAR - DAY
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY
dialog: 
text: Elena bursts up to the surface of the bloody water, gasps for
text: breath. Looking down she sees Chad, holding on to her like his
dialog: life depends on it. It does...
dialog: 
text: He pulls her back down into the water, just as she catches a
text: glance of the circling GATORS...
dialog: 
text: Using her as leverage, Chad pulls himself out of the swamp,
text: climbing over her writhing body to the relative safety of solid
dialog: ground...
dialog: 
text: Elena coughs and splutters, floundering in the blood soaked water.
text: The ravenous Gators approach, sensing a feeding frenzy...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: Don't move! Don't splash, they can sense

dialog: Hel..help me...
dialog: 
text: She reaches out a hand to Chad, only a few feet away...
speaker_heading: H

dialog: 
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: And he smiles as the Gators ease open their powerful jaws...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHACK!
dialog: 
text: Chad's eyes roll back into his head as blood flows from his nose,
text: ears and mouth. He falls forward, stiff as a board, and SPLASHES
text: down into the water next to an apoplectic Elena. Behind him stands
text: Marie, the BLOODY TIRE IRON in hand...
dialog: 
text: Marie reaches out a hand, pulls Elena out of the water. She
text: collapses onto her back and sucks in the stagnant swamp air...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: What are you doing? Our diamonds are

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Which way, which way...
dialog: 
text: Split second decision. Left. She spins the wheel, takes the left
dialog: hand fork...
dialog: 
text: Bad choice. Just a few meters down the right fork is an abandoned
text: BMW, an idle airboat, a crashed car, one dead man and two wild,
dialog: wild things...

scene_heading: EXT. SWAMP ROAD - DAY
dialog: 
text: Elena and Marie, soaked to the bone, drag Chad's cold, dead corpse

speaker_heading: MARIE

scene_heading: EXT. CHAD'S CAR - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: With trembling hands, Elena opens the trunk of Chad's crashed car.
text: She pulls out a plastic gas container, sloshing the fuel around

dialog: 
text: She carefully places the empty container down, standing twenty
text: feet back from the wreckage, fumbling in her pocket for a match...
dialog: 
text: She can barely control her hands, her whole body shaking in
dialog: fear...
dialog: 
text: Finally she pulls out a MATCHBOOK, still sopping wet from the
text: swamp. She strikes match after match, but they won't light, until,
text: finally, one produces a tiny flame that simmers for a second then
text: smoulders out...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Don't do this to me, please...

dialog: 03/22/2004 68.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: In frustration, she runs back to Chad's car, looking desperately
text: for a lighter, climbing all the way in. Because of the slight
text: slope it's on, the car's flimsy door slams shut behind her.
dialog: 
text: Elena pays no heed, continues to rummage through the glove
dialog: compartment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: You gotta have a lighter or some...
dialog: 
text: She's cut off as the WRECKED CAR'S HORN BLARES OUT!

text: steering wheel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Jesus...
dialog: 
text: She struggles with all her might to pull Chad's body back off the
dialog: horn...
speaker_heading: S

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...

scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM - AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: CURATOR

dialog: 
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE CAR
dialog: 
text: Elena reaches over, carefully closes Chad's bloodshot eyes.
text: Satisfied, she turns to get out, only to find the passenger side

speaker_heading: OUTSIDE THE CAR
dialog:

speaker_heading: INSIDE THE CAR

dialog: Christmas ornaments...

speaker_heading: CURATOR

speaker_heading: ELENA
