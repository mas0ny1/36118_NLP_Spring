scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
dialog: December 16, 2010
dialog: 
text: OVER BLACK WE HEAR THE DULL SOUNDS OF INDUSTRY; A MUFFLED
scene_heading: MASS OF MACHINES, GEARS, STEAM. FADE IN ON:
dialog: 
text: A SIGN. Twelve feet across. Painted decades earlier, grim-
text: covered black, white and red. It reads in large 40's era,
text: hand-painted type, "SAFETY IS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN!" Then:
text: "DAYS SINCE LAST ACCIDENT" and below that, NUMBERS, painted
text: on hanging metal cards. Four possible digits can hang here,
dialog: but there are currently three: "784."
dialog: 
text: SLOWLY PUSH IN on this sign as a MAN APPEARS, rising on a
text: forklift, in a greasy, monochromatic work jumpsuit. Removes
text: the "4" from its hooks. Then removes the "8." Then the "7."
dialog: 
text: Finally, he hangs up a number. "1."
dialog: 
text: The man LOWERS out of frame as we creep even closer to the
text: hanging single digit, wondering about the accident... and how
text: bad it was and the FACTORY SOUNDS GROW DEAFENING -- AND AS IT
text: BUILDS TO A CRESCENDO, WE CUT TO SILENT BLACKNESS.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - PORCH - DAY
dialog: 
text: Shiny black loafers. Black pants, three inches too long. We
text: BOOM UP, stopping at a boy's hand reaching into the black
text: suit jacket pocket. Pulls out a WOMAN'S GOLD NECKLACE with a
text: LOCKET. He holds the locket. Rubs it gently with his thumb.
text: CONTINUE TO BOOM UP. We now SEE THE BOY'S FACE.
dialog: 
text: This is JOE LAMB, 14. On the precarious edge of adulthood. He
text: looks out at the horizon with stricken eyes.
dialog: 
text: He moves forward and we PAN, so we're BEHIND HIM NOW. In the
text: frosty distance, past countless leafless trees and modest
text: homes, is a STEEL MILL. Smokestacks and structures. The
dialog: lifeblood of this late 70's town.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LAMB LIVING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Close on CHARLES' MOTHER AND FATHER, funeral attire. She
text: looks out of the window sadly; heartsick and concerned.
text: Behind her, he picks at his plate of food.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES' MOTHER
dialog: I'm so worried for that boy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES' FATHER
dialog: Joe's gonna be okay.
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES' MOTHER
dialog: ...she was everything to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES' FATHER
dialog: Jack's gonna step up. He's a good
dialog: man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES' MOTHER
dialog: But he was never really a
dialog: father...I don't think he
dialog: ever...understood Joe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES' FATHER
dialog: (maybe a little concerned
speaker_heading: HIMSELF)
dialog: Joe's gonna be okay.
dialog: 
text: But his wife isn't so sure.
dialog: 
text: Then, BOYS' HUSHED VOICES:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LAMB DINING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: CHARLES (we'll see him in a moment) LEANS FORWARD, reaching
text: for food on a buffet table. Charles' leaning has revealed
text: CARY, a blonde kid in a dark blue sport jacket and tie, and
text: PRESTON, pale and smart, in a DARK SWEATER:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: What do you think was in the
dialog: coffin?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Jesus, shut up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: I mean cause of how she died.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY (CONT'D)
dialog: ... you weren't wondering that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESTON
dialog: No, I'm eating macaroni salad.
dialog: 
text: We now see CHARLES, big and in an ill-fitting BLACK SUIT, and
text: MARTIN, good looking, in a shirt and tie, at the buffet:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I was thinking that, about the
dialog: coffin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I don't know how you guys can eat.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Try a Goddamn turkey roll and
dialog: you'll discover how. They're
dialog: delicious.
dialog: 
text: CUT WIDE TO REVEAL that we are in a modest Ohio house in the
text: year 1979. At a wake. Forty-odd friends and neighbors, darkly
text: dressed. Quiet discussions. Some crying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: Either nothing was in there, or
dialog: like whatever they scraped up--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Jesus -- guys--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES MARTIN
dialog: I heard it crushed her
dialog: completely. At least keep your voices
speaker_heading: DOWN--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESTON CHARLES
dialog: A steel beam-- those things
dialog: weigh a ton. Literally. If it had been open casket, I
dialog: would not be eating right
dialog: now. Despite the turkey
dialog: rolls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK (O.S.)
dialog: Hey-- Lucy.
dialog: 
text: They look up -- in the other room, a dog (mutt, Lucy) has
text: jumped on a guest, for food. JACKSON LAMB, Joe's father, 42,
text: black suit, moves to the dog, walks her out of shot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Bet Joe's not gonna wanna do my
dialog: movie anymore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Why do you think why? The story.
dialog: It's about the living dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESTON
dialog: His mother's not a zombie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: But she's dead, shithead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: Those turkey rolls are pretty good.
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Told you.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: A WIDE SHOT. A grey, snow-covered, early February day here in
text: LILLIAN, OHIO. Many cars are parked outside the house,
text: notably a SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SQUAD CAR in the driveway.
text: Joe, a vision of black on white in his too-big black suit,
text: now sits on a small swing set he hasn't used in years.
dialog: 
text: He solemnly looks down at the LOCKET he still holds. No doubt
text: trying to reconcile the fact that it no longer hangs around
text: his mother's neck. Then a SOUND. Joe looks up. A CAR has
text: arrived -- a distinct 1968 BUICK GSX -- a YELLOW MUSCLE CAR
text: with a BLACK RACING STRIPE down its center. Joe watches as
text: the car sits there for a moment. Then a MAN gets out. Someone
text: Joe has seen before, but doesn't know personally. A man in
text: his early 40's, in jeans and a work shirt. He's not exactly
dialog: sloppy, but if you look closely, you could tell he's been
text: drinking. This is LOUIS DAINARD.
dialog: 
text: Joe watches Louis carefully as he moves to the house, to the
text: porch and inside the house. Joe's eyes glued on the house for
text: a while. Then he looks back to the locket. He OPENS IT, and
text: stares at the picture inside (which we do not see). And as he
text: stares, TEARS come to his eyes.
dialog: 
text: A moment broken by the SOUND OF RAISED VOICES -- Joe turns
text: toward the house. After a beat, the SOUND of something
text: BREAKING -- something glass. Then the house BACK DOOR bursts
text: open -- Joe cranes his neck -- and what he sees he'll never
text: forget: his father, Jack, leading an in-pain and HAND-CUFFED
text: Louis Dainard from the house and into the rear of the squad
text: car. When he slams the back door, he sees Joe. Sort of
text: freezes as their eyes lock. But Jack's more uncomfortable
speaker_heading: THAN COMFORTING:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll be home soon.
dialog: 
text: And Jack gets into the car and drives away. Joe watches them
text: drive off. And after a beat, he looks down at the locket
text: again. Mom's just gone. Finally he CLOSES IT -- and we hear
text: an oddly LOUD SNAP and our SCREEN GOES BLACK.
dialog: 
text: Over darkness: APPLAUSE -- then a LONE VOICE: "I want you...
text: to want me!" DRUMS kick in, CHEAP TRICK BLASTS. CUT TO:
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY
dialog: 
text: Hundreds of KIDS eagerly leave their last day of school for
text: the year, winter a memory. GIRLS emphatically embrace each
text: other good-bye. BOYS run off, just happy to be out. Lots of
dialog: "Have a great summer!"
dialog: 
text: DOLLY WITH Joe, who walks through the crowd alone, backpack
text: on shoulder.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly Charles is there, red-faced -- he hands Joe PAGES:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: That was the longest day ever--
dialog: here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What's this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: New scene, check it out. Let's hit
dialog: the 7.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (as he reads)
dialog: You hear Martin barfed in the hall?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I know, does that guy ever not
dialog: barf? Keep reading.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE CHARLES
dialog: -- I am reading. -- Not carefully. Focus, this
dialog: is important.
dialog: -- Detective Hathaway has a
dialog: wife?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: I think it might help make my movie
dialog: better. I need two things: a better
dialog: story and production value.
dialog: 
text: They head across the street to the 7-Eleven. Suddenly Cary is
text: there, a BURN WRAP on his right arm now:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY CHARLES
dialog: Martin booted all over his
dialog: locker, it was the grossest
dialog: one yet-- Let Joe focus, he's reading.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY CHARLES
dialog: After he ate two boxes of
dialog: Mike and Ikes-- never seen so
dialog: many colors in my life. Will you shut up a minute?
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Who's gonna play the wife, Jen?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: No way -- did I tell you what she
dialog: did with my top hat?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh yeah, that was bad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: What wife?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Alice Dainard.
dialog: 
text: Joe stops. His friends don't. PUSH IN ON HIM --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. 7-ELEVEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: As they head to the doors:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I was returning that book on codes
text: and ciphers-- she was in the silent
dialog: reading section -- I thought,
dialog: "Screw it." So I asked her if she'd
dialog: play Hathaway's wife.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You talked to Alice Dainard really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: You're not supposed to talk at all
dialog: in the silent reading section--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES CARY
dialog: Shut up. It's for "silent reading."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: She said yes, we're filming tonight
text: and she's driving.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. 7-ELEVEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Joe, Charles and Cary scan the candy aisle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: -- driving where?
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES JOE
dialog: To the train depot -- did you
dialog: not read the scene I just
dialog: gave you? Does Alice have a license? Is
dialog: she old enough? Whose car are
dialog: we taking? Are you making
dialog: this up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Jesus, Freak Show, she offered to
dialog: drive and I accepted--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: (takes scene pages)
dialog: Can I see --?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: -- was she nice? Why is she doing
dialog: this? I don't understand, we don't
dialog: even know her--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Maybe she just wants to be in a
dialog: good movie, y'ever think of that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I don't think that's what it is--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I've been working on this movie for
dialog: months. I'm just trying to make it
dialog: good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: (reading, disapproving)
dialog: Hathaway's married now? Really?
dialog: 
text: Charles swipes the pages from critic Cary.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What was she reading?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: ... what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: In the silent reading section, what
dialog: was Alice reading?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Who gives a rat's ass what she was
dialog: reading-- the festival deadline's
dialog: in one week -- my movie's gotta be
dialog: great!
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: CHARLES' SUPER 8 MOVIE BEING PROJECTED ON A MOVIE SCREEN.
text: SLOWLY PUSH IN ON THE SCREEN: kids earnestly playing adults:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BUILDING 47 - DAY (SUPER 8)
dialog: 
text: DARKNESS. Then a DOOR OPENS. It's DETECTIVE HATHAWAY (played
text: by MARTIN), in silhouette. He enters. It's an old WAREHOUSE,
text: dirty, cobwebbed, crowded with CRATES, old MACHINERY,
text: CHEMICAL BARRELS and JUNK. The Detective turns on his
text: FLASHLIGHT -- aims it -- sweeps it across the space -- the
text: light HITTING THE LENS for a moment.
dialog: 
text: The Detective walks through the spooky, dark space. A low,
text: growling industrial DRONE makes the whole place oddly creepy.
text: Then: A SOUND -- quick but strange -- slithering -- and the
text: Detective aims his flashlight -- tense. He watches. Waits. We
text: see where he's aiming the light, which cuts through THICK
text: DUST in the air. It's an old office door, ajar.
dialog: 
text: Hathaway is still. Nervous. Watching the door -- waiting for
text: it to open... and then -- from the darkness BEHIND HIM -- a
text: terrifying open-mouthed ZOMBIE APPEARS -- ATTACKS -- and the
text: Detective TURNS -- his flashlight KNOCKED TO THE GROUND --
text: and Hathaway falls too -- the wild-eyed gaping-mouthed Zombie
text: DROOLING as it tries to bite Hathaway's flesh -- we recognize
dialog: that the Zombie is CARY. Actually, not a bad performance. The
text: Detective pulls out his GUN -- but the Zombie grabs his wrist
text: -- they wrestle with the gun -- the Zombie wanting to rip
text: into Hathaway's neck -- but Hathaway sees three SHARP-TIPPED
text: NAILS sticking out of an old piece of WOODEN CRATE -- and
text: after a significant struggle, Hathaway PUSHES THE ZOMBIE BACK
text: so his head is IMPALED BY THE NAILS -- which we see ENTER HIS
text: SKULL!!! The Zombie (stuck to the crate via the nails)
text: SCREAMS AND DIES and just at Hathaway catches his breath THE
text: IMAGE DIMS AND FREEZES; the projector has just been STOPPED.
dialog: We are in:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHARLES' ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Board games, books, records, a stereo, toys, and magic. Super
text: 8 film equipment and paraphernalia. Movie ONE SHEETS hang:
text: CARRIE, HALLOWEEN, EARTHQUAKE and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.
text: No sports memorabilia. Charles turns on the lights, looks
dialog: anxiously at Joe:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That was a good zombie murder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Yeah, but it's not a st-- thank you
dialog: for that-- it's not a story yet.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: Older kids enter this film festival
dialog: -- I'm competing with fifteen- and
dialog: sixteen-year-olds, who have better
dialog: stories and cars and production
dialog: value, I've got nothing!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES' MOTHER (O.S.)
dialog: Charles! Dinner!
dialog: 
text: As he tosses Joe a SUPER 8 FILMMAKER MAGAZINE:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I'm coming!
speaker_heading: (TO JOE)
dialog: There's a whole article in there
dialog: about stories, you should read it,
dialog: it explains everything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (looks at magazine)
dialog: I don't understand how the wife
dialog: makes it a story--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES CHARLES' MOTHER (O.S.)
dialog: Jesus, that's what I've been
dialog: explaining: in the scene
dialog: we're filming tonight, the
dialog: wife telling the detecting
dialog: she's scared for him, that
dialog: she loves him-- Charles!
dialog: -- I'M COMING!!!
dialog: -- so when he investigates
dialog: the zombie stuff you'll be
dialog: scares -- you'll feel
dialog: something -- because you
dialog: don't want him to die because
dialog: they love each other! Does
dialog: that make sense?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: I just can't believe you talked to
dialog: Alice Dainard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You're impossible.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES' MOTHER (O.S.)
speaker_heading: CHARLES!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: GOD, MOM! I'M COMING!
dialog: (opens the door, whispers)
dialog: Midnight. Okay? Don't forget.
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I won't forget.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Read this.
dialog: 
text: Joe just nods and looks at the magazine.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHARLES' KITCHEN - DUSK
dialog: 
text: A hectic FAMILY: Charles' mother cooks. JEN, his smoking hot
text: 17-year-old sister, ANGRILY sets the table where his father
text: pays bills. Pale 15-year-old sister PEG does a PUZZLE. Twin 9-
text: YEAR-OLD BOYS bicker over an action figure. TV in the living
text: room plays a MATCH GAME. Joe and Charles enter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Mom, it's not fair that I can't go
dialog: to Wendy's. Every single person is
dialog: going except me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES' MOTHER
dialog: Then every single person can tell
dialog: you how it was --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES' FATHER
dialog: Move the puzzle, get the napkins.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: MOM---
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES' MOTHER
dialog: It's your turn to babysit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: So...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEG
dialog: Get off that thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Mom, why can't I switch with
dialog: Charles?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Because you crushed Charles' top
dialog: hat, you ever think of that?
dialog: 
text: Disgusted, Jen LOUDLY sets Charles' place as --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Oh, really, guess what? We're
dialog: switching.
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Charles grabs a roll.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Guess what, no we're not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES' MOTHER
dialog: Charles take these to the table!
dialog: Benji, it's time for dinner. Hey,
speaker_heading: JOE--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Goodnight, Mrs. Kaznyk--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES' MOTHER
dialog: Grab a seat, we have lots of food.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh no thanks, Ma'am, I'm okay.
dialog: (to Charles, loaded)
dialog: "See you tomorrow."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Later days.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES' FATHER
dialog: There's always a place for you
dialog: here, you know that--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh, yessir. Thank you.
dialog: 
text: Joe leaves; Charles' parents share a look of pity for Joe.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHARLES' HOUSE - DUSK
dialog: 
text: An anomalous moment in this small steel town: the sun sets
text: through the distant trees and it's beautiful, despite the
text: distant belching SMOKESTACKS. Joe leaves Charles' house and
text: CROSSES THE STREET to his own. SQUAD CAR in the driveway.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S HOUSE - DUSK
dialog: 
text: Joe comes into the kitchen through the BACK DOOR. Lucy the
text: dog greets him. A TV is head somewhere. NIGHTLY NEWS reports
text: on the ONGOING CLEAN-UP OF THREE MILE ISLAND. A half-empty
text: BEER BOTTLE on the table. Joe peeks into the living room --
dialog: but no one's there.
dialog: 
text: Joe looks around for his father. Heads down the hallway.
text: Stops when he sees something off camera. We HOLD on Joe's
text: face, sort of quietly stunned.
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: And we se his POV: Jack, Joe's father, in uniform pants and T-
text: shirt, sits on the edge of the bathtub, head in his hands,
text: quietly CRYING.
dialog: 
text: Joe is stunned, staring at his dad. But he can't look away.
text: And when he finally starts to head off, Jack looks up. Joe's
text: mind scrambles for something to say, but Jack sniffles, gets
text: it together, quick. Puts on a strong face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey -- I'll be out in a minute--
dialog: 
text: Joe nods as Jack forces a smile and closes the bathroom door.
text: HOLD ON JOE. Stunned and heartsick.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAROL'S DINER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Commodores quietly sing "EASY" on the PA. Joe and his father,
text: in civvies, sit beside each other at the counter. Jack eats a
text: beef stew and reviews office paperwork, not looking at his
text: son. Joe eats a grilled cheese, deeply lonely and not even
dialog: knowing it.
dialog: 
text: Jack pulls out a PAMPHLET, and places it on the table:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's a six-week program, hands-on
dialog: training with college coaches.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You'll like it. I know I did.
dialog: 
text: Joe looks at the pamphlet for HEWITT SPORTS CAMP. Images of
text: happy, smiling, healthy ATHLETIC KIDS. Not his thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I thought I was going to have the
dialog: summer for myself--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Things have obviously changed for
dialog: us. And it'd be good for you to
dialog: spend some time with kids who don't
dialog: run around with-- cameras and
scene_heading: MONSTER MAKE-UP--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I gotta help Charles finish his
dialog: movie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I have nothing against your
dialog: friends. I like your friends.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
text: Except Cary, who can't stop
dialog: lighting things on fire. You'll
dialog: like it there.
speaker_heading: (FINALLY)
dialog: It's what we both need.
dialog: 
text: Joe looks back at the pamphlet -- his other hand coming up
text: from under the table -- and Jack sees that Joe is HOLDING HIS
text: MOTHER'S LOCKET. Jack wants to cry again. He wants to throw
text: that locket away, out of sight. But he just turns away.
dialog: 
text: Joe stares at the pamphlet. PUSH IN on the photo of beaming
text: 15-year-old KIDS. Then CUT TO THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: TIGHT ON QUASIMODO; a plastic, painted AURORA model. RACK
text: FOCUS to the paintbrush that comes into frame -- FOLLOW IT TO
text: JOE, holding the brush, at his desk, making a model. A boy's
text: room recently devoid of a mother's oversight; a mess. COMIC
text: BOOKS and other PLASTIC MODELS, all built and painted by Joe.
text: CARS and CREATURES and a TRAIN. His bedside CLOCK RADIO
text: (11:56 PM) quietly plays "BAKER STREET." Then a RADIO SQUAWK -
text: - Joe grabs a KID'S WALKIE-TALKIE:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (V.O.)
dialog: Okay, it's time -- don't get
text: caught, over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I won't. Over.
dialog: 
text: Joe turns off the walkie -- and he grabs a small plastic
text: FISHERMAN'S TACKLE BOX as we HEAR:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (V.O.)
dialog: Wanna hear something gross?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY (V.O.)
dialog: I do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN (V.O.)
dialog: No please, if you're really asking.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Midnight. Sitting on the curb with their GEAR and talking
text: quietly, are Joe, Charles, Martin, Preston and Cary. Martin
text: dressed in his detecting SUIT. Joe eats from a bag of
dialog: Twizzlers.
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I sneezed so hard yesterday I shit
dialog: my pants.
speaker_heading: (THEY MOAN)
dialog: I debated telling you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESTON
dialog: That's called a "sharteeze" by the
dialog: way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES CARY
dialog: Well then I totally
dialog: sharteezed in my pants. That's exactly what I'm
dialog: talking about: the world is
dialog: crazy, there's a name for
dialog: everything...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Twizzler me.
dialog: 
text: Joe passes him a Twizzler.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: So... people are turning into
dialog: zombies because of the chemical
dialog: factory, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Martin? I don't see how the guy
dialog: playing Detective Hathaway can ask
text: where the zombies are coming from.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: Another classic from Smartin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I told you, I don't like it when
dialog: you call me that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: I'm sorry, Smartin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Shut up.

speaker_heading: JOE
speaker_heading: GUYS--
dialog: 15.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: All the boys look. Their faces BRIGHTEN. Headlights. The boys
text: stand as the car STOPS beside them -- IT'S THE YELLOW BUICK
text: WITH THE BLACK RACING STRIPE THAT PULLED UP TO JOE'S HOUSE
text: DURING THE WAKE. But now, sitting in the driver's seat is 14-
text: year-old ALICE DAINARD. She sees Joe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Joe Lamb?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: -- yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: What the hell's he doing here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
text: Make-up, sound and special effects.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: He's the deputy's kid!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES JOE
dialog: -- what? (touch flattered)
dialog: -- you knew that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Charles, I don't have a license. I
dialog: can't drive with him!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You want Joe to-- stay back? I--?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: It's too late! He's seeing me in
dialog: this car right now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You can trust me. My dad'll never
dialog: know. I won't tell him anything.
dialog: 
text: Looking away, she's pissed. All the boys in silent wait. She
text: considers, annoyed. Shakes her head. Finally:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Get in.
dialog: 
text: The boys EXCITEDLY SCRAMBLE into the car.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The Buick crosses the nighttime horizon, leaving the small
text: town, driving through a rural landscape.
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESTON (V.O.)
speaker_heading: (TERRIFIED)
dialog: You're driving very well. I'm
dialog: impressed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BUICK - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Alice drives. The boys shoved in the back with the gear -- in
text: front Charles struggles with his backpack and camera bags as
text: he pulls out PAGES, arranging them. With her driving, there's
text: an unusual, electric energy in the air. Joe eats his
text: Twizzlers in the back, trying not to stare at Alice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: So I wrote a couple new lines, can
dialog: I show you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: New lines? Charles-- what, I have
dialog: new lines?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Shut up. There aren't a lot--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: I'm sorta trying to drive--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: What would be great is: could you
dialog: cry during the scene? Can you do
dialog: that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: ... no...?!
dialog: 
text: Cary messes with the radio. Alice moves his hand away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: You know the first place I'm gonna
dialog: drive when I get my license?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (offering to Alice)
dialog: Want one?
dialog: 
text: Alice looks at him in the rear view. Their eyes hold a beat.
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: New Castle, Pennsylvania. Fireworks
dialog: capital of America.
dialog: 
text: She takes the Twizzler he offers and looks back to the road.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: So I don't have any new lines,
dialog: right? Because I just learned
dialog: these.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Shut up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESTON
dialog: I have never been a passenger in a
text: vehicle without an adult driving.
dialog: I'm unresolved as to how I feel
dialog: about it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RURAL OHIO - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The Buick WOOSHES PAST a solitary KELVIN GAS STATION. The car
text: dips into the darkness, beneath a blanket of stars.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN DEPOT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The Buick pulls up to this small, EMPTY TRAIN STATION in the
text: middle of, essentially, nowhere. A series of HANGING LIGHTS
text: illuminates the TRAIN PLATFORM. There's a small office,
text: currently closed. No one around.
dialog: 
text: The kids get out of the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Guys, there's an electrical socket
dialog: up here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Hey, Charles, Charles, do I have
dialog: more lines?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: No. But you can pick up some stuff.
dialog: 
text: The boys carry many bags and the tripod.
dialog: 
text: PLATFORM - Charles looks at the scene through the "lens" he
text: creates with both hands.
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: Guys, this is going to be great.
dialog: Get the lights and camera on that
dialog: end, we'll shoot this direction
dialog: first, like we talked about! Joe,
dialog: get the mike plugged in-- make sure
text: the new batteries are in the camera
dialog: before you do the make-up!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
text: Joe walks past Alive, who watches him. It strikes her that
dialog: Joe is Charles' lackey.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN DEPOT - PLATFORM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Martin sits alone with his copy of the pages, quietly reading
text: and memorizing his lines.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: "-- Sweetheart, this is my job, I
dialog: have no choice." "That's nothing
dialog: you need to worry about..." "What
dialog: am I suppose to go to Michigan with
dialog: you..."
dialog: 
text: Cary grabs his paper and throws it to the wind, sending
text: Martin running after it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: No, no, no. Cary.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PLATFORM
dialog: 
text: Preston sets up the lights as Cary arrives to show him his
text: backpack full of FIRECRACKERS:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: I took apart two packs of cherry
dialog: bombs and made my own M-80.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESTON
dialog: Your obsession with fireworks --
dialog: and I'm saying this as a friend --
dialog: concerns me. And my mother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: Well you're a pussy. And your mom
dialog: has one.
dialog: 
text: Cary takes off. Martin returns with his paper.
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Bogus, Cary.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN DEPOT - PLATFORM - EDGE OF PLATFORM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Charles writes in his notebook. He starts to get up...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Martin, I have a new line for you.
dialog: 
text: He gets up to reveal Joe putting make-up on Alice. He walks
text: over to Martin, Cary and Preston. Charles and Martin AD LIB.
dialog: 
text: TIGHT ON JOE'S TACKLE BOX, which opens. Inside is an
text: assortment of MAKE-UPS, sponges, cotton balls, brushes, derma
text: wax, spirit gum, and a large jar of FAKE BLOOD. Joe is
text: preparing to make up Alice, who sits in front of him,
text: watching carefully as Joe prepares BASE MAKE-UP on a sponge.
text: He looks to her. A beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You mind?
dialog: 
text: Alice shakes her head: nope. Joe starts stippling the make-up
text: onto her face. He is now, via sponge, touching the face of a
text: girl he's admired for some time. After a beat:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: My dad works at the mill.
dialog: 
text: And she looks at him. Almost as if she were looking for
text: something. Joe stops stippling. The tension is almost too
dialog: much for him to bear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Close you eyes. Please.
dialog: 
text: He indicates the sponge: it's for the make-up. She does. Joe
text: starts applying the make-up to her eyelids. There's something
text: provocative for Joe, being so close to Alice, with her eyes
text: closed. Then, PRE-LAP:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (O.S.)
dialog: So this is very emotional.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN DEPOT - PLATFORM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The lights (plugged into the car cigarette lighter) and
text: camera (a EUMIG) are set. Alice has been made up, wears a
text: coat with purse. Martin, in his tie, faces her. They both
text: look over their script pages as Charles adjusts the camera.
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Joe, observing, holds the boom mike (a condenser mike taped
text: to a broom handle), Preston wears an overcoat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Alice: Mrs. Hathaway really doesn't
dialog: want her husband to keep investiga--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: I know, we read it, we get it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Okay, I'm just directing. Martin
dialog: get on your mark. Martin, you're
dialog: going to have to reassure her. Do
dialog: you know what "reassure her" means?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yeah, I think so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Okay-- we're starting on Alice's
dialog: side first-- Preston: a couple
dialog: seconds after "action" walk to the
dialog: pay phone, make it look like this
dialog: place is busy--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESTON
dialog: I know what that looks like.
dialog: 
text: POP! Everyone JUMPS -- Charles turns -- Cary, laughing, has
text: just exploded a firecracker:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Asshole, could you stop blowing
dialog: shit up for two seconds and deal
dialog: with the camera?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: Sorry man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Let's rehearse this -- save your
dialog: real performances for when we're
dialog: filming, though.
dialog: 
text: Martin and Alice put away their pages -- Cary gets behind the
text: camera. Charles stands near the camera, kneeling to camera-
text: height. Joe wears headphones and holds the boom over the
text: actors' heads. Preston holds a suitcase, ready to walk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: Ready? Here we go... action!
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Martin and Alice now perform as their characters, DETECTIVE
scene_heading: JOHN HATHAWAY and MRS. REBECCA HATHAWAY:
dialog: 
scene_heading: DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
dialog: I'm going to stay here and
dialog: investigate. I think it would be
dialog: safer if you leave town.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. HATHAWAY
dialog: John. I don't like it. This case.
dialog: These murders.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
dialog: What am I supposed to do, go to
dialog: Michigan with you?
dialog: 
text: Preston walks past them, acting in the background.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. HATHAWAY
dialog: Mackinac Island's beautiful this
dialog: time of year.
dialog: 
text: We're TIGHT ON JOE NOW, watching Alice. Slowly amazed at the
dialog: unexpected depth and truth she brings to this role --
dialog: 
scene_heading: DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
dialog: Sweetheart. This is my job.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. HATHAWAY
dialog: The dead, coming back to life...? I
dialog: think you're in danger--
dialog: 
scene_heading: DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
dialog: I have no choice--
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. HATHAWAY
dialog: You do have a choice. We all do...
dialog: 
text: And holy shit, Alice actually starts to cry as she performs
text: her lines. Not overdone, not hammy. Just fucking real.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)
dialog: John, I've never asked you to stop.
dialog: I've never asked you to give up or
dialog: walk away.
dialog: 
text: Charles watches -- in awe -- he's suddenly, giddily
text: transported. But it's JOE who, as he stares, becomes
dialog: galvanized; any vague interest in Alice has just set:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)
dialog: But I'm asking you now-- please.
dialog: For me. Don't go back. Don't leave
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)
dialog: I need to know this isn't the last
dialog: time I'll see you.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I just love you so much.
dialog: 
text: Martin is thrown by the passion and heart of her performance.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
dialog: ... I... I love you too...
dialog: 
text: And in the heat of it, Alice looks at Charles, unsure:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Was that okay? Or... not really?
dialog: 
text: Charles is stunned -- almost crying -- can't talk -- and as
text: he searches, behind him, a LIGHT --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: -- uh, that was... I'm... that--
dialog: yeah, good. Just like that.
dialog: 
text: Then a distant AIRHORN -- Charles looks: AN ONCOMING TRAIN.
text: PUSH IN ON CHARLES, TIGHT. He turns to them all:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: PRODUCTION VALUE!!! Is there film
dialog: in the camera?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: -- I didn't put it in--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: PUT IT IN!!! PUT IT IN!!! Joe, get
dialog: the mike ready. Go, go, Preston,
dialog: get in position. Costume, costume.
dialog: Martin, get that tripod set up.
text: Joe, help her with her costume.
dialog: Hurry, hurry! Go! I hope we don't
dialog: miss the train. Preston, get in
dialog: position! Martin, you know you
dialog: lines, right?! IS THE FILM IN THE
dialog: CAMERA YET?!
dialog: 
text: As Charles runs to Alice, takes her script pages.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: I love how calm he is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah, he's a very relaxed guy.
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Joe laughs a little as he goes -- Cary RIPS OPEN a YELLOW
text: SUPER 8 box -- Joe grabs the mike -- Cary INSERTS the film:
text: CLICK! Joe plugs in the mike, Charles grabs the camera:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Everyone ready...?! Be extra loud
dialog: when the train passes by! Oh God, I
dialog: hope it stops! You ready?!
dialog: 
text: They're set to film toward Alice, the approaching train in
text: her background -- Charles puts on the headphones --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: And... ACTION!
dialog: 
dialog: And they're shooting:
dialog: 
scene_heading: DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
dialog: I'm going to stay here and
dialog: investigate. I think it would be
dialog: safer if you left town for a couple
dialog: of days.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. HATHAWAY
dialog: John. I don't like it. This case.
dialog: These murders.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
dialog: What am I supposed to do, go to
dialog: Michigan with you?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. HATHAWAY
dialog: Mackinac Island's beautiful this
dialog: time of year.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
dialog: Sweetheart. This is my job.
dialog: 
text: Charles watches, beaming with excitement. Joe holds the boom,
text: looks to Charles to make sure it sounds okay; this is when he
text: notices something in the distance. HEADLIGHTS. A quarter mile
text: away, a vehicle drives along the horizon. A beat. But the
text: train is APPROACHING -- GETTING LOUDER -- which makes Joe
text: turn back toward the train -- the thing almost upon them --
text: LOUDER AND LOUDER, so the actors begin to YELL over the
speaker_heading: GROWING DIN:
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. HATHAWAY
dialog: THE DEAD, COMING BACK TO LIFE?! I
dialog: THINK YOU'RE IN DANGER!
dialog: 
scene_heading: DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
dialog: I HAVE NO CHOICE!!!
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. HATHAWAY
dialog: YOU DO HAVE A CHOICE! WE ALL DO!!!
dialog: John, I've never asked you to stop.
dialog: I've never asked you to give up or
dialog: walk away.
dialog: 
text: Joe looks back at the headlights -- and sees something very
text: odd: the distant vehicle TURNS ONTO THE TRACKS. PUSH IN ON
text: JOE, unsettled -- as the train CROSSES THEM NOW -- Joe looks
text: back toward Alice -- a BLAST OF AIR, shockingly LOUD!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)
dialog: But I'm asking you now-- please.
dialog: For me. Don't go back. Don't leave
dialog: me. I need to know this isn't the
dialog: last time I'll see you.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I just love you so much.
dialog: 
text: Alice and Martin continue to yell their lines -- Charles is
text: almost LAUGHING at how good this looks -- but Joe LOOKS
text: DESPERATELY BACK toward the headlights -- the train LIGHTING
text: UP THE OLD PICK-UP THAT IS ABOUT TO CRASH INTO THE TRAIN!
dialog: 
scene_heading: DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
dialog: I love you too!!
dialog: 
text: And Joe finally swings the mike down and YELLS:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE CHARLES
dialog: GUYS, WATCH OUT!!! Joe what the hell are y--?!
dialog: 
text: -- just then BA-BA-BA-BAM!!! THE TRAIN ENGINE, HUNDREDS OF
text: YARDS AWAY, SLAMS INTO THE TRUCK -- THE KIDS GASP -- REACT --
scene_heading: AS THE TRAIN ENGINE DERAILS!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Run!
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE TRAIN BEGINS TO CRASH -- ACCORDION -- THE KIDS SCREAM --
scene_heading: RUN -- ENTIRE 50-TON CARS JACKNIFE AND CRASH UPWARD -- FLYING
scene_heading: VERTICAL -- CHARLES' SUPER 8 CAMERA AND TRIPOD SLAM ONTO THE
text: PLATFORM, LANDING SIDEWAYS, STILL FILMING as the CRASH WAVE
dialog: APPROACHES AND PASSES THEM!
dialog: 
text: THE KIDS SCATTER, PRESTON AND MARTIN RUN ONE WAY. CHARLES,
text: CARY AND JOE RUN ANOTHER. JOE STOPS AS ALICE RUNS AROUND THE
text: BUILDING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Alice!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Joe, we have to go.
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: They run off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: I DON'T WANT TO DIE!!!
dialog: 
scene_heading: AS NEARBY CARS RIP OFF TRACKS, TUMBLE -- CARS FROM FATHER
text: BACK JETTISON TOWARD THEM, SLAMMING INTO THE DEPOT,
scene_heading: SHATTERING IT -- THE ENTIRE AREA IS DECIMATED IN AN INSTANT!
dialog: And then --
dialog: 
text: IT'S OVER. Just the odd, dying CHUGS and SCREECH-SCREECH-
text: SCREECH of TRAIN WHEELS running out of momentum, HISSES of
text: STEAM, the unnatural bending of steel.
dialog: 
text: In the DUST, JOE lies frightened on the ground, eyes tightly
text: shut. His mind races, his heart pounds -- and then: A LOUD
text: METAL BANG! Joe stands up fast, faces a MOUNTAIN of twisted
scene_heading: STEEL -- UPSIDE-DOWN TRAIN CARS PILED FRIGHTENINGLY around
text: him. Just another few feet and he would've been crushed. But
text: what was that sound? Something metal? Then again: SLAM! Joe
text: BACKS UP, afraid -- it was almost a LABORED GROAN --
text: MECHANICAL or ANIMAL?! A crazy SCREECH, another BANG, then
dialog: AGAIN and AGAIN!!!
dialog: 
text: We see Joe TIGHTLY GRIPPING HIS NECKLACE LOCKET IN HIS HAND --
text: THEN: CRASH! -- AWFUL-LOUD -- and a TWISTED TEN-FOOT SQUARE
text: SHEET OF METAL EXPLODES FROM BEHIND THE OVERTURNED TRAIN CARS
text: -- Joe covers his head as the metal STABS THE GROUND, twenty
text: feet away: a TRAIN SLIDING DOOR. Joe turns to see it --
text: stunned -- then back to the direction of the NOISE -- but it
dialog: is GONE. Nothing.
dialog: 
text: TIGHT ON CHARLES' CAMERA -- on its side, FINISHING UP A
scene_heading: CARTRIDGE OF FILM.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE (O.S.)
dialog: Guys?!
dialog: 
text: Joe finds MARTIN, on his knees, THROWING UP -- Martin keeps
text: throwing up, but pumps a THUMBS UP.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Martin, are you okay?! Preston, is
dialog: that you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESTON
dialog: I'm okay! Though I think I'm having
dialog: a heart attack! And I have a
dialog: scrape!
dialog: 
text: Joe MOVES FORWARD -- up to camera -- behind him, Cary
text: appears, smiling. This kid enjoyed the crash:
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: Guys, did you see those explosions?
dialog: That was awesome.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Has anyone seen Alice?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (O.S.)
dialog: I'm alive! Is anyone dead?
dialog: 
text: Through the debris, steel and dust. Joe moves forward --
text: Charles, shaken, eyes wide, appears through the thick dust --
dialog: 
text: Joe moves forward, looking at, under a train WHEEL
text: ASSEMBLY... BLOOD. A PUDDLE OF BLOOD and Joe's heart sinks as
text: he moves toward it -- another woman he loves, crushed?!
dialog: Charles and Preston and Cary see the blood --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D) PRESTON
dialog: -- oh God-- -- no -- nonono...
dialog: 
text: Martin, still sick, calls out:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN CARY
dialog: -- what? Guys, what is it? ... shit...
dialog: 
text: Joe moves closer to the blood -- heartsick -- on the verge of
text: DEEP, REAL TEARS -- everything stops -- but then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE (O.S.)
dialog: -- what's all that blood?
dialog: 
text: Joe WHIPS AROUND -- standing in the dusty mess is ALICE --
text: shaken, but absolutely alive. Joe just BEAMS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE (CONT'D)
dialog: What's the blood? -- did someone
dialog: get hurt--?
dialog: 
text: But JOE SUDDENLY KNOWS -- he moves to the blood -- reaches
text: below the wheels -- the others watch, freaked out --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIDS (AD LIB)
dialog: Joe, wait -- maybe you shouldn't
dialog: touch -- what are you-- careful!
dialog: 
text: Joe pulls out his CRUSHED MAKE-UP KIT. He brightens:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It's my fake blood. It's fake!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: What is this stuff?
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: ALICE NOTICES THAT HE'S HOLDING THE NECKLACE. Joe notices
text: this and POCKETS IT self-consciously. PRESTON calls out:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESTON
dialog: Guys, what are these things?
dialog: 
text: Joe looks -- they all move to Preston (except Cary, who heads
text: off): CRATES have spilled from a nearby split car; many
text: shattered, revealing THOUSANDS OF SMALL WHITE-METAL CUBES
text: which now litter the ground. Joe kneels, picks one up:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Hey, don't touch it, what are you
dialog: doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
text: They look like white Rubik's cubes
dialog: or something. They're heavy like
dialog: metal or something. There's like a
dialog: billion of them.
dialog: 
text: It's just a few inches per side, an UNUSUAL DESIGN. Behind
text: them, having walked up the ANGLED SIDES of overturned train
text: cars, Cary calls out:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: Guys, get up here. You can see
dialog: everything from up here.
dialog: 
text: They move up the mass of metal, revealing a VAST VIEW OF THE
text: WRECK. It seems to stretch on forever. It is SOBERING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES CARY
dialog: Oh my God. ... Look at that...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESTON
dialog: According to my Uncle Seth, an
dialog: accident like this is exceptionally
dialog: rare.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It wasn't an accident.
text: (turns away, eyes on the
speaker_heading: FIELD)
text: There was a truck. On the tracks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: What? Driving on the tracks?
dialog: 
text: Joe's seen it. He points. Chilled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: There.
dialog: 28.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Thrown fifty yards from the main wreckage is THE PICK-UP
text: TRUCK. SHEARED IN HALF UPON IMPACT and lying in the overgrown
dialog: grass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: How can a pick-up truck derail a
dialog: train? That's impossible.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESTON
dialog: Obviously it isn't.
dialog: 
text: BOOM UP from behind the SHATTERED PICK-UP as the kids
text: approach from the wreckage. PUSH IN ON THEM as they arrive at
text: the truck and STOP; what they see makes Joe's heart pound --
text: they're stunned -- all of them. They just stop. Finally:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: ... holy shit...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: -- is that him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (covers her mouth))
dialog: -- yeah, it's him--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: -- who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESTON CHARLES
dialog: It is, yeah, for sure-- Holy shit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: What? Who is that?
dialog: 
text: WE SEE NOW: it's DR. WOODWARD -- 75, seat-belted, bloody and
text: unconscious, stuck inside the crushed wreckage. Alice moves
text: closer -- scared and sad for him --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Dr. Woodward...?
dialog: 
dialog: No one can take their eyes off this as, SOTTO:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: That's Dr. Woodward? The science
dialog: guy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESTON
dialog: Biology.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: Honors biology.
dialog: 29.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Wow... I'm not in his class.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: We know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Shut up, Cary.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Remember when Old Man Woodward took

speaker_heading: PRESTON
dialog: That trailer Woodward keeps in the
dialog: school parking lot.
dialog: 
text: Joe moves next to Alice, who reaches out and gently NUDGES
dialog: him -- you keep expecting him to suddenly grab her --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: ... Dr. Woodward?
dialog: 
text: But he's apparently dead; when she nudges him, he LEANS, his
text: arm drops limp from the steering wheel, where he was HOLDING
text: A PAPER, that has now fallen onto the ground. Joe picks it
text: up. UNFOLDS IT: it's an OLD MAP -- thin, off-white paper.
text: They hold it up, the map now backlit and obscuring Woodward.
text: We see MARKER WRITING ON IT -- a BLACK LINE, from Nevada to
text: Dayton -- and NUMBERS written along the way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESTON JOE
dialog: Map of the contiguous United
dialog: States... -- what's the writing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE (CONT'D) CHARLES
dialog: -- dates and times. -- what's that line across?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It's a schedule for the train.
dialog: 
text: But a SHADOW has appeared: A TREMBLING HAND -- before they
text: can react, it RIPS THE MAP AWAY -- THEY ALL SCREAM AS OLD DR.
text: WOODWARD IS REVEALED, BLOODY EYES OPEN, in a DAZE:
dialog: 
scene_heading: DR. WOODWARD
dialog: -- who-- who are you?
dialog: 30.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: They're all speechless for a moment. Finally, too loudly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Dr. Woodward! It's Charles Kaznyk!
dialog: From fourth period! You've been in
dialog: an accident!
dialog: 
text: BUT WOODWARD HAS REACHED INTO HIS JACKET AND PULLED OUT A GUN
scene_heading: -- THE KIDS JUMP BACK, STUNNED --
dialog: 
scene_heading: DR. WOODWARD
dialog: They will kill you. Do not speak of
dialog: this -- or you -- and your parents -
dialog: - will die.
dialog: 
text: We're on Joe's stunned face -- but DISTANT VOICES make him
text: turn his head: hundreds of yards away, through the wreck,
scene_heading: FIGURES WITH FLASHLIGHTS APPROACH FAST --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: -- guys, look --
dialog: 
text: The rest turn to look -- their minds are racing, all of them:

speaker_heading: PRESTON CHARLES
dialog: My dad will de-ball me! Let's get out of here!!!
dialog: 
text: Now they're SPRINTING -- FLASHLIGHT MEN getting closer.
dialog: 
text: Charles arrives on the platform, grabs his camera.
dialog: 
text: Alice hurries past, hunting for her keys in that big purse --
text: she eyes the FLASHLIGHT MEN getting closer:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: MOVE YOUR ASS, WE GOTTA GO!!!
dialog: 
text: Joe grabs his make-up kit -- another duffel -- runs for the
text: car, past a whining Charles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: GET IN THE CAR!!!
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: As the FLASHLIGHT MEN APPROACH, Joe runs and gets in the
text: front seat, the other boys in back -- Alice SLAMS the car
text: into REVERSE, SCREECH-BACKS UP, narrowly avoids debris, then
text: RIDES OFF -- the FLASHLIGHT MEN arrive -- SOLDIERS -- their
text: adrenaline pumping. One man who WALKS UP TO THE CAMERA,
text: eyeing the vanishing car with intense suspicion: COLONEL
text: NELEC. He then looks to the ground in front of him.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON A FRESH, EMPTY YELLOW SUPER 8 FILM BOX. Nelec steps
text: to it, picks it up. Looks at it. Then back up at the

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It's okay-- no one's saying

dialog: 
text: The boys all muster, "no's." Joe turns sweetly to Alice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)

text: They all kind of look at each other. What a night. Charles,

text: the tripod. Joe nods.
dialog: 
text: Alice finds something on the passenger seat and holds it out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Joe, this is yours.
dialog: 
text: Joe goes to the window. Alice holds it out: THE CUBE. He

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: -- oh, thanks,

speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: I should never have done this.

dialog: 
text: Pull back WIDE to see Joe's room -- while in the FOREGROUND

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Uh... no.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES' MOTHER
text: It's on the news.

speaker_heading: CHARLES

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
text: Meanwhile, local science teacher

dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BABBIT
dialog: Twenty microwave ovens: gone from

dialog: 
text: The town ROARS its approval -- Jack, impotent, tries:

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Mrs. Babbit, I don't believe the

dialog: Until you can tell me who's messing

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Hey -- he was at my house yesterday

dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER ROSKO
dialog: (quiet to Jack)
dialog: We brought him in about the car lot
dialog: and other things -- he's clean.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I'd appreciate it if you would

dialog: 
text: Louis heads out -- HOLD ON JACK AS he turns, ENTERS HIS
text: OFFICE, and as that door opens, we CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: The door opens of his messy, motherless room. Joe and Alice
text: enter. He could not be more self-conscious. He moves stacks
text: of comic, tosses some dirty clothes behind the bed -- pair of
text: underwear and socks. He closes the closet and hangs a bath
text: towel on his desk chair. She looks around sa she enters. The
text: light dim, intimate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh gawd, I didn't clean up.
dialog: 
text: Joe quickly moves a pile of papers and books from the desk to
text: the floor; NOTEBOOKS AND SCHOOL WORK spill out and we get a
text: GLIMPSE of some "B-MINUSES" and other "C-PLUSES" in RED.
dialog: 
text: Joe, embarrassed, hides them, then moves to his MODELS:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: -- you made all these?
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah, that's the Hunchback of Notre
dialog: Dame. I watched that one on TV.
speaker_heading: HERE---
dialog: 
text: Alice sits on the bed. Joe takes the FIVE-CAR TRAIN MODEL.
text: She moves close:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is the train they wanna
dialog: destroy.
dialog: 
text: Alice hold it. Joe watches her. She really looks at it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: ... it looks real.
dialog: (beat, studies)
dialog: It looks so old...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That's dry brush technique.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: After you've painted the base
dialog: color, you take something like...
dialog: (grabs up Testors bottle)
dialog: Euro Gray.
dialog: 
text: Her face is so close to his. Her hair touches his ear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Euro Gray...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: There are so many different grays,
dialog: it's crazy. And you pour a little
dialog: onto like a paper plate. Then you
dialog: take a dry brush and you just dip
dialog: it in, then you brush on the paper,
text: so the paint's barely on the brush.
dialog: Then you make small brush strokes
dialog: on the model. Little ones, like
dialog: where the wear and tear would be.
dialog: Around the wheels. Or where the
dialog: doors would slide. Then you do it
dialog: again, like with Camouflage Gray--
dialog: or here, I used Insignia Red to
dialog: make it look like there was another
dialog: coat of paint on there before. Like
dialog: they painted over it, but you could
text: see it scratched off.
dialog: 
text: Lost in thought, he looks at her. Suddenly self-conscious.
dialog: 63.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: What was that necklace?
dialog: (off his awkward stare)
dialog: The one you were holding at the
dialog: train crash. Was it your mom's?
dialog: 
text: It takes him a beat. Finally:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: My dad gave it to her the day I was
dialog: born. She wears it all the time.
dialog: Used to.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: It was bad, how she-- died and
dialog: stuff, but they got the necklace
dialog: back. So.

dialog: Guys, what the hell?! No one knew

speaker_heading: JOE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You gotta be the soldier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: CHARLES

speaker_heading: (TO ALICE)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER ROSKO
dialog: Alright. Now what does she look
dialog: like?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: She's got dark hair, it was in

dialog: are?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER ROSKO
dialog: Yes, I know what rollers are.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: She went to her car--
dialog:

speaker_heading: EXCUSE ME--

dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER JOE
dialog: We just made the discovery

scene_heading: DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
dialog: Of course.

dialog: I would never have given you this

text: As it continues, we see Alice behind the camera, watching

text: Jack's CRUISER pulls up.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WOODWARD'S HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: A dozen OFFICERS go through HUNDREDS OF CARDBOARD BOXES of

text: reviews a folder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OVERMYER
dialog: Nothing so far--

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NELEC
dialog: How much more is there?

text: Sixty boxes in the basement, maybe

speaker_heading: NELEC
dialog: What, more tax returns?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OVERMYER
dialog: It's here somewhere. If we can't
dialog: find it, Woodward'll tell us where
dialog: it is.
dialog: 
text: But Nelec has seen something outside: THE KIDS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NELEC
dialog: ... the hell's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OVERMYER
dialog: ... looks like kids making a
dialog: movie...
dialog: 
text: Behind them, a WINDOW, showing the street, where Jack insists
text: Joe get into the car. Nelec looks out -- sees Jack take Joe
text: by the arm, grab the tripod and head to his squad car.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WOORWARD'S HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: As Jack gets out, he sees the kids and isn't happy. He moves
text: toward Joe and his friends:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Joe.
speaker_heading: (TO JACK)
dialog: Hey, Mr. Lamb!
dialog: 
text: Joe spins around as Jack arrives, grabs his camera from
dialog: Charles and saying firmly, to Joe:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Get in the car.
dialog: 
text: Joe is stunned -- instantly humiliated in front of Alice --
text: he's taken back to the squad car --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Uh-- Mr. Lamb? That's your camera,
dialog: but technically, that's my film--
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jack OPENS the car's back door -- Joe gets in -- Jack SLAMS
text: it shut, then throws the camera and tripod into the passenger
text: seat and SLAMS that door, heading to the house, leaving Joe
text: in the back. Nelec heads outside -- Jack moves to him:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NELEC
dialog: I would like to help you out
dialog: deputy. I really would. But we
dialog: operate on a need to know basis.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why are your trucks sweeping the
dialog: town?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NELEC
dialog: We'll be out of your way shortly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Then I'm sure you wouldn't mind me
dialog: contacting DC. Talk to some friends
dialog: about "Walking Distance."
dialog: 
dialog: This lands on Nelec.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: All right. We'll do it that way.
dialog: 
text: Jack heads off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NELEC
dialog: Deputy.
speaker_heading: (JACK TURNS)
dialog: Let's talk. Just not here.
dialog: 
text: Jack stops, turns to uncomfortable Nelec.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SQUAD CAR - DAY
dialog: 
text: Joe, his breathing heavying, sits in the car, heart pounding,
text: watching his father move over to talk to Nelec, close again.
text: Then he looks over at his friends -- Charles giving him a
text: "WHAT THE FUCK?!" Look. Alice watches him sympathetically.
text: She mouths to him a guilty, "...is it me...?" And Joe shakes
dialog: his head: "No." But we -- and she -- know better.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: The squad car pulls up. Jack gets out, Joe follows -- THE

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Door opens. Jack enters, then lets Joe pass him. Joe closes
text: the door hard and says, angrily, but restrained:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: This is new. All this. For the both
dialog: of us. Dealing with-- all this,
dialog: just us. So I'm going to make this
dialog: as clear and simple as I can:
dialog: You're not friends with Alice
dialog: Dainard. When I say no, I don't
dialog: mean maybe. I don't mean yes. I
dialog: mean no. I've known Louis Dainard
dialog: for alotta years-- he's been
dialog: nothing but trouble. Your mother
dialog: used to say he's not a bad guy, he
dialog: just needs a chance, he's just sad -
dialog: - well I tried to be good to him,
dialog: but I can't. Not anymore. I will
dialog: not allow him or his daughter in
dialog: this house. I will not allow you
dialog: spending time with her, doing
dialog: projects or whatever it is that
dialog: you're doing. THAT'S IT. I hope
dialog: we're clear.
dialog: 
text: Jack turns to leave -- but Joe, enraged, says:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: We're not clear.
dialog: 
text: Jack stops -- stunned -- Joe's heart pounds --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What'd you say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: We're not clear. You and I aren't
dialog: clear about anything. We couldn't
dialog: be less clear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Joseph Francis Lamb--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
speaker_heading: (ERUPTING)
dialog: Just `cause mom died doesn't mean
dialog: you know anything about me!!! You
dialog: don't. You don't know about Alice
dialog: either -- she's kind!
dialog: 70.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm not having this discussion with
dialog: you--!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: She's NICE to me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't care what she is! Her
dialog: father is a selfish, irresponsible
dialog: son-of-a-bitch!
dialog: 
text: Jack moves CLOSE to Joe -- intimidating -- Joe steps back --
dialog: Jack is fucking intense:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: You listen to me, I've got twelve
dialog: thousand people in this town that
dialog: are scared out of their minds--
dialog: they've got one person they can
dialog: rely on -- it used to be someone
dialog: else, but now it's just me.
dialog: 
text: Jack suddenly stops himself, realizing what he's saying. And
text: to whom he's saying it. But somehow, in this moment, he can't
text: be a better father than law officer. Not yet. More upset at
text: himself than Joe, he heads out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LILLIAN STREET - DUSK
dialog: 
text: Joe rides UP A HILL -- BOOM UP -- REVEAL THE TOWN CEMETERY.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Joe sits, his back against his mother's grave. Holds her OPEN
text: LOCKET, staring at it. He's just come here for comfort. But
text: then -- a SOUND -- and Joe turns. Deep and low, in the
text: distance. Joe is motionless. HEARS IT AGAIN. He stands, pulls
text: out his flashlight -- aims the beam down ROWS OF GRAVES,
text: toward the big CARETAKER'S SHED in the distance. Another
text: INTENSE, LOW SOUND -- then a high pitch HIT, like METAL ON
text: WOOD and Joe backs up, nervous. Another odd sound -- then
scene_heading: ANOTHER -- which TRANSITIONS US TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MUNICIPAL AIRPORT ENTRANCE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jack's squad car arrives at the abandoned airfield.
dialog: 71.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MUNICIPAL AIRPORT BUILDING - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jack's car pulls up. He gets out of the car. Suddenly the
text: three large MILITARY TRUCKS' HEADLIGHTS COME ON -- all aimed
text: at Jack -- he is blinded -- tries to see --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hello--?
dialog: 
text: And now BODIES are seen of SOLDIERS, holding and aiming
text: WEAPONS. Then, a VOICE over a TRUCK PA:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Drop your weapons. Put your hands
text: on the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: --I'm here to see Colonel Nelec. He
dialog: told me to meet him here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: You're under military arrest. Drop
dialog: your weapons.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: WHERE'S NELEC?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MILITARY MEDICAL ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: TIGHT ON NELEC. Past an IV and medical machinery. He's
text: looking at someone we don't yet see. In the background,
text: Overmyer stands, watching. Nelec is quiet, simple:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NELEC
dialog: I don't want any more trouble. Do
dialog: you?
dialog: 
text: Now we see who he's talking to. IT'S DR. WOODWARD. Battered
text: and scraped, he lies in a medical bed, afraid, but defiant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NELEC (CONT'D)
dialog: We've been going through your
text: belongings, looking for evidence.
dialog: Of what you knew, how you knew
dialog: it... and who else might know.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I remember you. In the lab. And I
dialog: recall we didn't see eye to eye,
dialog: but that's no excuse for doing what
dialog: you did here.
dialog: 72.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Dr. Woodward swallows. Feels that his time on Earth is coming
text: to an end no matter what he does here. By the door, Overmyer
text: is quietly putting on his BLACK GLOVES.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NELEC (CONT'D)
dialog: So in the spirit of moving forward
dialog: and avoiding more trouble, tell us
dialog: where you put your research. I know
dialog: you had someone document the crash
dialog: that night. Tell me who that was
dialog: and I'll help you, I swear to God.
dialog: On my mother's life -- if you help
dialog: us now, we will take care of you.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DR. WOODWARD
dialog: I've seen what happens, Mr. Nelec,
dialog: when you take care of people.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NELEC
dialog: --I'm going to bait him. I'm going
dialog: to catch him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DR. WOODWARD
dialog: He's in me, you know. As I am in
dialog: him. So when you see him next, as
dialog: I'm sure you will... I'll be
dialog: watching you, too.
dialog: 
text: Nelec offers a vague, searching smile. But Woodward will not -
text: - not ever -- relent. So. Nelec moves to the door, he remains
text: FACING CAMERA, his back to Woodward, as Overmyer moves to the
text: bed. PUSH IN ON NELEC'S FACE, UNDERSTANDING HIS TRUE NATURE
speaker_heading: AS WE CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Joe sleeps, power still out. Then, a KNOCK. He wakes up.
text: Another KNOCK. His window. He moves to it. Opens it. It's
text: Alice. Joe is half asleep, but also stunned. Very quietly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALIE
dialog: -- are you-- were you sleeping?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Before, earlier, b-- no, you okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Oh, you wanna come in?
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: And Alice climbs in. Joe sits on the floor. Alice does too.
text: It's odd and silent for a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
text: Power's still out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
text: Room's still messy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: I was in bed, couldn't sleep.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Thinking. I wanted to tell you
dialog: something, before tomorrow -- Don't

dialog: 
text: Joe stares, amazed at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't think it's right, do you? I

speaker_heading: BOSSY--

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: He can be sorta li-- I've known him
dialog: since Kindergarten, though--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: He shouldn't always get what he
dialog: wants. I mean, who always gets what
dialog: they want? -- I know I don't know
dialog: you at all. Even though... it sort
dialog: of feels like I do.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Do you not... feel like that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: -- no, I totally do, I'm just...
dialog: sort of in shock at this whole
speaker_heading: CONVERSATION--
dialog: 
text: And the POWER RETURNS -- Joe's CLOCK LIGHT goes on behind him
text: -- but more chilling, the PROJECTOR comes back on; the SILENT
text: HOME MOVIE OF HIS MOTHER PLAYS. Joe crawls to the projector
dialog: to stop it -- but:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: -- no, keep it-- please --
dialog: 
text: Alice moves closer to the screen. Joe sits behind her. She
text: watches the film. Can't take her eyes away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... is that her?
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: ... yeah...
dialog: 
text: And as Alice watches, we GENTLY PUSH IN... as tears start to
text: fill her eyes. Behind her, at a near WHISPER:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... it's so weird watching her like
dialog: this, like she's still here...
dialog: (beat, lost in it)
dialog: ... she used to look at me, this
dialog: way... like really look. And I
dialog: just... knew I was there. That I
dialog: existed.
dialog: 
text: A tear drops down Alice's face, though Joe can't see that.
dialog: Finally, quietly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: He drank that morning. My dad.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: He missed his shift.
dialog: (beat, hard)
dialog: Your mom took it for him. The day
dialog: of the accident.
dialog: 
text: Watching his mother, Joe is quietly stunned. Finally, eyes
text: wet, Alice turns to Joe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... I know he wishes it was him.
text: Instead of her.
speaker_heading: (HARD BEAT)
dialog: ... and sometimes I wish it was,
dialog: too.
dialog: 
text: Joe just stares at her... heartsick and speechless. Finally:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Don't say that.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: He's your dad.
dialog: 
text: Just then, the SUPER 8 movie ENDS: the film FLIPFLIPFLIPS.
text: Joe turns off the projector -- but a SOUND REMAINS. A sort of
text: SHUDDER-HUM. Joe unplugs the projector, but the sound
text: remains. Then they look: THE SHUDDERING IS COMING FROM THE
text: CUBE HE TOOK FROM THE CRASH SITE, sitting on his desk.
dialog: 
text: Joe and Alice move to it. He turns on his desk lamp. The cube
text: VIBRATES, almost imperceptibly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE JOE
dialog: -- has this--? -- no.
dialog: 75.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Joe opens a drawer, grabs a paintbrush -- he touches the cube
text: -- the thing SHUDDERS ON ITS OWN.
dialog: 
text: They are amazed. They get LOW -- eyes at desk level -- the
text: SHUDDERING INCREASES IN PITCH AND VOLUME -- he reaches out to
text: touch it with his finger, but suddenly the cube BULLETS AWAY -
text: - ACROSS THE ROOM -- AND BLASTS THROUGH THE WALL, LEAVING A
text: FIVE-INCH HOLE IN THE WALL! She screams -- they both fall to
text: the floor, STUNNED -- PUSH IN ON Joe, his heart pounding. He
text: moves to the wall -- looks through the hole: in the distance,
text: trees and the TOWN WATER TOWER.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ALICE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Alice enters the dark house quietly. She steps carefully
dialog: toward her room, when --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS (O.S.)
dialog: Morning.
dialog: 
text: His voice makes her JUMP. She turns: sitting in the dark, in
text: an armchair, is her father. He's awake. And drunk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You wanna tell me where you were?
dialog: Or you want me to tell you.
dialog: 
text: A tense beat, her mind races. Breathe, Alice, just breathe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Sit down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: I should go to bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I wanna talk to you. I said sit
dialog: down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: I don't want to sit down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Then go. Be just like your mother
dialog: and leave.
dialog: 
text: This kills her -- but she does: she leaves the house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: GO AHEAD, GO!
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ALICE'S HOUSE - PRE-DAWN
dialog: 
text: Alice, crying, gets on her bike and rides off -- a DISTANT
text: FIERY GLOW past the factory and over the hills. The front
text: door opens -- Louis comes out and yells, miserable:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: ALICE!!! WAIT!!!
dialog: 
text: But she's far gone -- Louis' mind races -- he runs to his
text: BUICK -- starts it up -- PULLS OUT FAST and goes after her --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LILLIAN STREET - PRE-DAWN
dialog: 
text: Alice PEDALS HARD, she wants to escape everywhere. No cars on
text: the street, no people. A block behind her, SCREECH: a CAR
text: turns onto the road. Her father's car -- she makes a turn --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BUICK - PRE-DAWN
dialog: 
text: We're with Louis as he drive -- clearly drunk --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SHARP TURN ROAD - PRE-DAWN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: ALICE!!! I'M SORRY!!!
dialog: 
text: Louis sees her, tries to stop, but can't -- and his car SLAMS
text: INTO A PARKED CAR IN A VIOLENT, SUDDEN STOP!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LILLIAN STREET - PRE-DAWN
dialog: 
text: Alice GASPS -- stops pedaling -- looks back at her father's
text: car, wide-eyed and terrified -- should she go back?!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BUICK - PRE-DAWN
dialog: 
text: Louis is bleeding. Badly hurt. He adjusts himself --
text: painfully -- then looks into the CRACKED-GLASS REAR VIEW
text: MIRROR -- AND HE SEES SOMETHING THAT MAKES HIS EYES GO WIDE.
dialog: 77.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LILLIAN STREET - PRE-DAWN
dialog: 
text: Alive is still looking back at the car -- SO SHE DOESN'T SEE
text: THE SHAPE THAT IS COMING BEHIND HER -- and just as she
text: decides: I'M NOT GOING BACK, she turns to begin riding on --
text: BUT SEES SOMETHING AND SCREAMS --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BUICK - PRE-DAWN
dialog: 
text: THROUGH THE MOSAIC OF THE SHATTERED REAR VIEW MIRROR, WE SEE
scene_heading: THE CREATURE GRAB ALICE -- HER SCREAMS BECOME HER FATHER'S:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: -- ALICE, NO!!!!! NO!!!!!!!
dialog: 
text: Louis tries to get out of the car -- but it's painful -- and
text: his door is JAMMED SHUT -- he goes for the passenger door --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LILLIAN STREET - PRE-DAWN
dialog: 
text: -- when Louis finally gets out -- he runs from his car --
text: stumbling drunk and bleeding -- SCREAMING, SHREDDING HIS
speaker_heading: VOCAL CHORDS --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: ALICE!!!
dialog: 
text: But all that's there is her bike -- and before he can even
text: get that far, Louis FALLS HARD onto the pavement, crying, a

dialog: the sidewalk.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: In the great distance, the WATER TOWER. We BOOM DOWN in a

text: of SIX SOLDIERS standing in the field. But ONE stands out
text: front, wearing a FLAME THROWER. And suddenly the quiet is
text: broken by the ROAR OF FLAME. A WIDE, WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT as
text: the flames ARC in the tall, dry grass. Over the radio:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Firelight is 0500 hours. Operation

scene_heading: EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - EARLY MORNING

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I told you not to pick it up in the

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What are you so angry about? That

scene_heading: EXT. OLSEN CAMERA AND HI-FI - DAY
dialog:

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What's your problem?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: My whole movie's a disaster `cause
dialog: of you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I know, my dad's being a turkey.
dialog: 79.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Whatever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: We're still gonna finish your

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: It's not about the movie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What are you talking about? Of
dialog: course it is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Just forget it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: There's nothing wrong--
dialog: 
text: As we CONTINUE BOOMING UP, we arrive at the top of the WATER

speaker_heading: SMOKE LOOMS --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHARLES' HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: As Joe and Charles ride their bikes up to his house:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'll get the camera back, I know

dialog: make the festival.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: It's not about the movie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Then what is it about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Jesus, you don't even get it do
dialog: you? It's obvious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What's obvious?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: That night of the crash, you

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: -- what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
text: Like Mr. Attitude all of a sudden.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Your movie was over! That's what
dialog: you said! You were upset. I gave
dialog: you a camera! I helped you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Don't pretend like you did it for
dialog: me! You didn't do it for me and you
dialog: know it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What's your problem?
dialog: 
scene_heading: Charles ROLLS THE FILM, DIMS THE LIGHTS --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: It was never about me! It was
dialog: always about Alice!
dialog: 
text: And suddenly on the poster board pinned to the closet, there
text: she is: ALICE, from the night of the train crash. The scene
dialog: plays as they filmed it:
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. HATHAWAY
dialog: John. I don't like it. This case.
dialog: These murders.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
dialog: What am I supposed to do, go to

dialog: 
text: THE FILMED SCENE CONTINUES as Joe and Charles argue:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well, you're the one who wanted the
dialog: wife in the movie!
dialog: 81.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Not so you could fall in love with
dialog: her!
dialog: 
text: Joe's mind spins -- how does he respond to this?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What do you even care what I think
dialog: about Alice?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Because I like her! That's why!
dialog: That's why I asked her in the first
dialog: place! So I could get to know her,
dialog: not YOU!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: -- wait, you like Alice Dainard?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You're such an idiot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (from Charles' movie)
dialog: Guys, look out!
dialog: 
text: They watch for a moment as the TRAIN CRASH HAPPENS -- but
text: it's SO SUDDEN, SO FAST, the camera picks up almost nothing.
text: Within a moment, the camera is on its side, filming the
text: SETTLING DEBRIS. Charles moves forward, so the film is now
text: partially BEING PROJECTED ON HIM.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: SHIT! Look at all that smoke! We
dialog: can't use any of this. And you
dialog: won't even let me blow up your
dialog: train. Everything's bogus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: We can make another train and blow
dialog: that one up.
dialog: 
text: Joe moves forward. Part of the film PROJECTED ON HIM, too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: I do like her. Sorry about that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CJAR
dialog: Shut up. It's okay.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: That's not even what bothers me.
dialog: (beat, finally, sad)
dialog: It's that she likes you too. That
dialog: really bothers me. I dunno...
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: But Joe has seen something -- on the screen -- SOTTO:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: ... Charles...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I know it's stupid. What would she
dialog: ever like me? I haven't leaned out
dialog: yet, which the doctor says is gonna
speaker_heading: HAP--
dialog: 
text: But Joe has slapped Charles' arm, his eyes locked to the
text: screen -- Charles looks too -- AND NOW WE SEE IT: through the
scene_heading: BROKEN CAMERA LENS -- SOMETHING MOVES -- SOMETHING BIG --
text: FROM THE TRAIN CAR, THROUGH THE WRECKAGE -- what the hell is
text: it? TOO DAMN BIG -- MOSTLY OUT OF FRAME, ITS SHAPE AND FLESH
text: TOO BIZARRE -- we only see the LEGS as it clears frame --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: -- Joe, what the hell--?!
dialog: 
text: PUSH IN ON THEIR FACES AS THEY SEE THE ALIEN THEY'VE CAPTURED

dialog: 
text: And there is Joe and Nelec, face-to-face -- Joe seeing the

dialog: Harder! Come on, you PUSSY!!!
dialog: 
text: With all his might, Joe hits the window again -- the
text: SLIGHTEST sound of glass adjusting -- meanwhile, SLAM!!! The
text: creature BUSTING the bus door -- PRYING it wider like a
text: sardine can -- NELEC SITS AGAINST THE GLASS AND OPENS FIRE,
text: FUTILELY, ON THE CREATURE. He makes a CALL on his walkie:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NELEC
dialog: This is Nelec -- use the big guns.
dialog: Whatever happens to me, you take it
dialog: down, you kill him --
dialog: 
text: -- and he drops the walkie and FIRES AGAIN -- the LOUD
text: GUNFIRE BARELY AUDIBLE behind the glass with the boys as Joe
text: hits the glass again -- BAM -- a CRINKLING of glass --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You can do it!
dialog: 
text: Joe hits again -- so does the creature -- as Nelec RUNS OUT
text: OF AMMO. That was never really hope anyway. Joe hits again
text: and CRASH! The window SHATTERS! Glass chunks RAIN DOWN on the
text: boys -- all covering their face -- Cary seeing the CREATURE
scene_heading: STARTING TO ENTER THE BUS --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: Go! Joe, move!!!
dialog: 
text: With all the boys helping, Joe pulls himself up -- outside
text: the bus, Joe peeks out -- the fucking creature -- its back to
text: Joe -- just fifteen feet away, focused on the door -- and Joe
text: strains to climb out here, onto the top-side of the bus.
dialog: 
text: And as the boys climb out, the creature climbs in -- first
scene_heading: Joe, then Charles (AD LIB DIALOGUE WITH CARY AND MARTIN: "You
dialog: gotta lose some weight --" "I know!!!"), Then Cary, and
text: Martin last -- they all jump down to the dirt -- they hear
text: SCREAMS and turn back for a moment --
dialog: 
text: Inside the bus, Nelec watches as the creature ENTERS THE
scene_heading: TIGHT-FITTING BUS, SMASHING BENCHES, MAKING ITS WAY
text: TERRIFYINGLY DOWN THE AISLE TOWARD HIM. And as the creature
text: descends upon him, in the silence before the final lunge --
text: Nelec says, eerily quietly, terrified:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NELEC
dialog: -- it was my turn once... to find
dialog: you. Now... it's your t--
dialog: 103.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Before he can finish, the creature fucking ATTACKS -- and it
text: would be horrible and brutal, if the BLOOD DIDN'T SPRAY UPON
scene_heading: THE BULLETPROOF GLASS -- WHICH OUR CAMERA IS SAFELY BEHIND --
scene_heading: OBSCURING THE NIGHTMARISH VIEW.
dialog: 
text: In the field, a distance away, the boys watch the bus SHUDDER
text: and SHAKE. Then... silence. They see the creature burst out
text: of the bus -- then RUN OFF -- fast and stealthy, away from
text: them in the overgrown grass, like a native hunter. Which, of
text: course, is partly what it is. They're sort of stunned.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I just sharteezed a little.

scene_heading: INT. GREENVILLE AIR FORCE BASE HANGAR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Louis stares off, lost. Two AIR FORCE SOLDIERS arrive:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: You need to come with us, we have
dialog: some questions for you --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: -- what, is she... Is she dead--?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER TWO
dialog: Just come with us.
dialog: 
text: Standing is hard for heartsick Louis, his legs so hurt --
text: suddenly JACK IS THERE, acting the role of Air Force:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey fellas, I've got orders from
dialog: Colonel Nelec to personally
dialog: transport this man to base.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: He's all yours, Staff Sergeant.
dialog: 
text: As the two Soldiers head off, Jack wraps Louis' arm over his
text: shoulders, heads off in the other direction, as Louis looks
text: him over, confused:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Where're we going--?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: -- to find our kids.
dialog: 
text: On LOUIS' FACE -- a surprised glimmer of HOPE --

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRANSPORT BUS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Moments later, TIGHT on a POCKET -- Joe pulls out his
text: MOTHER'S NECKLACE. WIDEN to see that he's taken the necklace
text: from Overmyer's dead body. Cary holds up his backpack.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: Got my fireworks back!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: (who gives a shit)
dialog: Congratulations!
dialog: 
text: They turn: a car comes, fast -- PUSH IN ON JOE who studies
text: the oncoming car, as behind him:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: They're coming, man! I think we
dialog: should go!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No--!!! No, look!
dialog: 
text: The car ARRIVES: It's DONNY. He gets out of his car, wild-

speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: Ho ho!!! You dorks are alive! I
dialog: didn't know...!
dialog: (finally sees the bus)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: Hop in, man! But you should know: I

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You want me to drive?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I saw something at the cemetery.
dialog: Woodward said it's subterranean-- I
dialog: think I know where it--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: What's that? What are those sounds?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Guys, that sounds like guns!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: (points to a tank)
dialog: What the hell is that?!
dialog: 
text: SUDDENLY, BOOM!!! A DEAFENING, CONCUSSIVE GUNBLAST! They're
text: LIT UP by what they see ahead: in the oncoming cross-street,
scene_heading: TANKS -- TWO OF THEM -- AND A ROCKET-LAUNCHING VEHICLE FIRE
text: AGAIN AND AGAIN AT SOMETHING WE CAN'T YET SEE! The boys COVER
text: THEIR EARS -- Donny awakens, but only for a moment --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: TURN THE CAR AROUND!
dialog: 
text: Joe quickly turns left into a driveway -- but we PUSH IN
text: TIGHT ON HIM -- from the direction they just came are MORE
text: TANKS AND MILITARY VEHICLES -- Joe's eyes go wide -- they're
scene_heading: stuck. GUNFIRE CONTINUES!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: We gotta go by foot--!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Where?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Just follow me!

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Drugs are so bad!
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER

text: Soldier hurries off.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Joe in the lead - they turn and look back -- a massive shot
text: of the neighborhood under fire -- houses getting BLOWN TO
text: SHIT in collateral damage.
dialog: 
text: An EXPLOSION HITS TOO CLOSE -- the boys SCREAM as they run
text: BETWEEN HOUSES -- and WE TRACK WITH THEM -- four boys racing
text: through a neighborhood under siege -- power GOES OUT -- and
text: some explosions are much closer than others -- another BIG
text: HIT and they go to a back door of a house -- and go inside --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: -- they run in for cover -- they're silhouetted in this dark
text: space by the EXPLOSION LIGHT emanating from the windows.
text: They're all out of breath in a strange KITCHEN --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: You guys see those explosions? They
dialog: were huge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: -- whose house is this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: (he hands him a picture)
dialog: Kathy's. I got it off the fridge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Kathy? Oh, Kathy's cool.
dialog: 
text: Another CRAZY LOUD AND BRIGHT EXPLOSION -- the light fixtures
text: sway. Charles grabs a coke on the counter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D) CHARLES
dialog: Charles-- that's not yours-- -- what?! I'm thirsty and I'm
dialog: in a war zone!
dialog: 
text: Another fucking LOUD BLAST -- sound of GLASS BREAKING -- and
dialog: the creature ROARING --
dialog: 107.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: And there it is, in silhouette, moving past the bay window --
text: Joe realizes: where the creature is, so are the blasts:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Come on, guys, let's go. Come on!
dialog: 
text: Joe runs -- the others follow --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: Where we going?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: To the cemetery--
dialog: 
text: But as they get to the living room a HUGE EXPLOSION BLOWS OUT
text: A WALL! They all go down -- but Martin is in agony all of a
text: sudden -- his leg RIPPED by concrete. If there's good news
dialog: here, the creature has left this area -- the explosions
text: getting further away. But there's blood and Martin is in real
dialog: pain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: What happened to my leg? It hurts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Oh shit, Martin, you gotta bone
dialog: sticking out of your leg!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: There's a hole in the house!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Joe, gimme that thing on the
dialog: curtains!
dialog: 
text: Charles wants the tie around the curtains, still hanging on
text: the wall that now has a HOLE in it; MILITARY VEHICLES can be
text: seen driving past outside. Joe hands Charles the thick fabric
text: tie -- which Charles fashion into a tourniquet, wraps it
text: around Martin's leg, tight --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm gonna go find Alice-- you have
dialog: to stay with Martin.
dialog: 
text: Charles looks at Martin -- can't argue. Says, sincerely:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: ... you gonna be okay without me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (a meaningful beat)
dialog: ... yeah.
dialog: 108.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Charles nods -- Joe looks to Cary:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: I'm not staying with the girls!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: God, Cary. Shut up!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: Calm down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Oh, my leg hurts!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Come on, Cary, we gotta go.
dialog: 
text: Joe nods, determined, and he and Cary head off --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: This is going to hurt.
dialog: 
text: Martin screams.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: I haven't even done it yet.
dialog: 
text: Joe and Cary run through the semi-demolished neighborhood,
text: many houses shattered, some cars obliterated. The only lone
text: figures in town.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Joe and Cary stop, out of breath, at the graves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: So what are we doing here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Just follow me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: I've been following you for the
dialog: last five blocks. What are we doing
dialog: here?
dialog: 
text: Joe and Cary run through the graveyard and over to the
scene_heading: CARETAKER'S SHED.
dialog: 109.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT./INT. CEMETERY CARETAKER'S SHED - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: They're out of breath -- they try ONE garage door, windows
text: CAKED WITH DIRT. Stuck. The SECOND door. Dirt-caked windows.
text: Stuck. The third is a barn door -- they try it: locked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Help me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: Help you with what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: We need to get inside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: For what? What's in these windows?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Cary, help me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: It's dirt. Why is there dirt in
dialog: these windows?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Help me, on three.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE/CARY
dialog: One, two, three.... One, two,
dialog: three.... One, two threee.
dialog: 
text: The two begin KICKING the door together -- on three -- one --
text: two -- CRASH! Again and again, until finally the door KICKS
text: OPEN -- and they almost FALL INSIDE -- and thank goodness
dialog: they didn't -- because -- and now we're looking STRAIGHT DOWN
text: FROM INSIDE THE SHED -- the entire floor of the shed has been
text: DUG OUT -- DROPPING FORTY FEET STRAIGHT DOWN, dirt PILED,
text: caked along the sides of the structure. The boys catch their
dialog: breath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: Whoa. This is scary.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You got any sparklers in there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: Are you kidding me?
dialog: 
text: Cary opens his backpack, whips out a Fourth of July SPARKLER.
text: LIGHTS it with a lighter and DROPS IT IN. The thing falls far
text: enough to tell them it's too far to jump.
dialog: 110.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: But burning on the dirt floor of the nearly-dug hole, it
text: lights up a TUNNEL at the bottom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: -- Alice is down there.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A JEEP roars past.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JEEP - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jack drives fast. Louis sits beside him. It's awkward. But
text: not angry. Finally, vulnerable, scared and sad:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I came to your house that day. To
dialog: tell you that I never meant to hurt
dialog: anyone. Swear to God.
dialog: (beat, respectful tears)
dialog: I'm sorry, Jack. About what
dialog: happened to your wife.
dialog: 
text: Jack looks at him for a moment, then back to the road. A
dialog: beat. Finally:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: ... It was an accident. It was an
dialog: accident.
dialog: 
text: Jack glances at him. A small nod of forgiveness and
text: gratitude. Louis wants to cry again, but just accepts it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SHED - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Joe begins CLIMBING DOWN the ROPE.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CEMETERY SHED HOLE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Joe lands on the bottom. Dark as hell -- looks up -- at Cary
text: climbing down into the hole -- the barn roof looming above
text: him. Now Cry lands too. There are THREE POSSIBLE WAYS TO GO.
text: Joe's mind races about which way to go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: Joe, I don't understand--
dialog: 
text: We HEAR a DISTANT RUMBLING -- like something far off, but
text: MECHANICAL. Then:
dialog: 111.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Shhh. This way.
dialog: 
text: They begin their walk into the dirt tunnel, a TALL OVAL
scene_heading: TUNNEL, TWENTY FEET TALL --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL #1 (W/FURNIURE) - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: We're SO FAR AWAY, that the screen is mostly black, with a
text: small speck of SPARKLY LIGHT.
dialog: 
text: They come to an area LITTERED WITH THE STUFF OF A LIVING
text: ROOM. They look up: ANOTHER HOLE LEADING DOWN, DUG STRAIGHT
text: THROUGH A HOUSE. They continue, coming to an INTERSECTION --
text: where a NEW TUNNEL branches off.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: There's DIM LIGHT from up ahead, where the tunnel BENDS. The
text: RUMBLING/MECHANICAL SOUND LOUDER now. Joe and Cary slowly
text: move forward -- seeing something off-camera that scares and
text: amazes them all at once.
dialog: 
text: IT'S A HUNDRED-FOOT DIAMETER, FORTY-FOOT TALL UNDERGROUND
scene_heading: SPACE, FILLED WITH A MECHANICAL MARVEL -- A MASSIVE, BIZARRE
scene_heading: CONTRAPTION COMBINING THOUSANDS OF MECHANICAL PIECES, FROM
scene_heading: THE MISSING MICROWAVES, CAR ENGINES, ANTENNAS, AND COUNTLESS
scene_heading: OTHER DEVICES -- WIRES AND CABLES HANG AND CONNECT
text: EVERYWHERE, ALL LEADING TO THE DIRT CEILING, HEADING UP, TO
text: SOMEWHERE ABOVE GROUND. THE THICK-WITH-FUMES SPACE CHUGS AND
text: HUMS WITH A SLOWLY INCREASING PITCH, AS IT IT'S WARMING UP,
text: GETTING READY TO FINALLY, ACTUALLY WORK.
dialog: 
text: They cross to the other side. Cary bumps into a HANGING
text: SHERIFF PRUITT. Cary is about to scream, but Joe puts a hand
text: on his mouth and leads him away from Pruitt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: It's Sheriff Pruitt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I know. Cary look.
dialog: 
text: Makeshift HANGING BULBS provide some light; a number of other
text: TUNNELS are visible from here, too. Joe and Cary look at the
text: space in disbelief.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: What is this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: We're under the water tower.
dialog: 112.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Then Joe sees something that makes him grab at Cary's shirt.
text: Cary looks: THROUGH THE MASS OF METAL AND MACHINERY AND
text: DANGLING CABLES, AT THE OTHER END OF THIS UNDERGROUND
text: EXPERIMENT, IS THE CREATURE. HUNCHED OVER. BACK TO THE BOYS.
text: AND IT'S SAVAGELY EATING SOMETHING. IT MOVES A BIT: WE SEE
text: IT'S A HUMAN LEG. Joe and Cary would SCREAM if they didn't
text: need to stay quiet. In a panicked WHISPER:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
text: It's eating a person.
dialog: 
text: Joe moves away from Cary to get a better view of the other
text: side of the machinery -- and there he sees, in an INSET
text: section of the rock-wall, THREE HUMAN BODIES, HANGING
text: LIFELESS FROM THEIR FEET, WRAPPED IN SOME KIND OF THIN
text: SHELLAC. TIGHT ON JOE as he sees, among them, ALICE. His
text: heart POUNDS, his resolve quadruples. Cary sees her too --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: She's here. We're going to use your
text: firecrackers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: I don't think it's going to hurt
dialog: it, Joe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
text: There are other tunnels.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: So?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I need you to make noise. Lots of
dialog: it, right here, in two minutes.
dialog: Make it loud and make it last--
dialog: gimme some sparklers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: (goes through his bag)
dialog: -- why-- what are you gonna do--?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (takes SPARKLERS and a
speaker_heading: LIGHTER from Cary)
dialog: Make sure you're gone by the time
dialog: it blows: you can't be here, you
dialog: gotta run.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: Where are you going?
dialog: 113.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: But Joe's already gone. Stay with Cary, who opens his
text: backpack, starts pulling out his amazing array of EXPLOSIVES,
text: glancing up to make sure he's out of the creature's view --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL #3 - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: MOVE FAST with Joe as he races, a LIT SPARKLER giving him his
text: light -- the MECHANICAL RUMBLING all but gone now. Joe runs,
text: looking for another way into the creature's massive space --
text: he finally finds another INTERSECTION -- he turns into it --
text: he disappears down the tunnel --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Cary's made a long, insane pile of FIRECRACKERS -- he uses an
text: OPEN M-80 and begins laying a SQUIGGLY, LONG LINE OF GUN
text: POWDER back, away from the firecrackers -- away from the
text: entrance to the creature's CONTRAPTION space.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Joe races down the dirt tunnel, the SOUND OF THE MECHANICAL
text: RUMBLING -- and its INCREASING PITCH -- getting LOUDER. The
text: SPARKLER DIES as LIGHT BEGINS TO REVEAL JOE, who slows --
text: peers around the dirt tunnel bend -- he is now on the OTHER
text: SIDE of the space. He sees the creature -- then looks across
text: to the lifeless body of Alice. His heart sinks.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Cary's done laying out the charges -- he pulls out his
dialog: lighter -- FFFT! FFFT! The damn thing won't light --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: -- come on-- damnit!
dialog: 
dialog: FFT! FFT! No go -- he keeps trying.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Joe watches as the creature FINISHES WITH ITS MEAL AND HEADS
scene_heading: FOR THE OTHER HANGING BODIES -- PUSH IN ON JOE, DESPERATE --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: -- Cary, come on, come on--
dialog: 114.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Cary frantically trying the lighter -- FFT! FFT! FFT!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: -- damnit!!!
dialog: 
text: He looks up -- watches the creature GRAB AND PULL ALICE'S
text: LIFELESS BODY DOWN FROM HER HANGING POSITION -- it moves with
text: her to where he was eating the teacher -- Cary SHAKES THE
text: LIGHTER, STARTING TO CRY AND HE FLICKS IT AND FFFFFTH!!! IT
text: LIGHTS! HE TOUCHES IT ON THE GUN POWDER AND RUNS OFF --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MECHANICAL CONTRAPTION SPACE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The creature PULLS AWAY the fibrous covering over Alice --
text: its TENTACLES SLITHER OUT.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Watching this is horror, Joe's about to run in just as
text: BABABABABABABABAM!!! The creature JERKS UP from its almost-
text: meal of Alice, looks toward the EXPLOSIVE SOUNDS, then LEAVES
text: HER, quickly moving for the tunnel --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The creature arrives in the SMOKE-FILLED TUNNEL, as the
text: FIREWORKS FILL the tunnel with BRIGHT, MULTI-COLORED LIGHTS --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MECHANICAL CONTRAPTION SPACE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Joe SPRINTS in, gets to Alice -- lightly slaps her face --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: -- Alice, please -- please --
dialog: (nothing -- SLAP)
dialog: Alice, wake up!
dialog: 
text: Nothing -- so he fucking SLAPS HER FACE HARD and she suddenly
text: INHALES SHARPLY, he eyes WIDE, terrified --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Alice! You're alive! Can you hear
dialog: me? Are you okay?!
dialog: 
text: She's CATCHING HER BREATH, nodding, looking at him, amazed --
dialog: 115.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: What is this? What are you doing
dialog: here?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm just-- doing the best I can to
dialog: save you.
dialog: 
text: She GRABS HIM AND HUGS HIM TIGHT, teary and grateful --
dialog: during which -- quietly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: How did you know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Your dad. He told me. He was
text: worried. And flipping out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: -- we need to move--
dialog: 
text: But she breaks out of the hug and grabs his shirt, intense:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA (O.S.)
dialog: Excuse me?
dialog: 
text: TINA, a 24-year-old , disoriented woman with curlers in her
text: hair, wakes up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are we?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MECHANICAL CONTRAPTION SPACE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Joe and Alice have helped down one FAMILIAR FACE: SHERIFF
text: PRUITT. They're out of breath, but their survival instinct
dialog: has kicked in:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: I left my bag in my car. Then I
dialog: went to my car to get my bag--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: It's been experimented on for
text: years. It's terrified and exhausted
dialog: and hungry, it just wants to go
dialog: home. When it touched me, I knew --
dialog: 116.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Alice, help me get the sheriff
dialog: down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIME CUT:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PRUITT
dialog: Follow me. I can get us out of
dialog: here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Sheriff, we came that way.

speaker_heading: SHERIFF PRUITT
dialog: Don't argue with me.

speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Come on, kids, let's go with the
dialog: sheriff.
dialog: 
text: Joe and Alice follow. They run into a tunnel. We PUSH IN ON
scene_heading: THE MECHANICAL DEVICE -- the PITCH INCREASING MORE NOW -- AS
text: IF IT'S ABOUT TO "FUNCTION" -- The creature returns and sees
text: that the humans are gone. He takes off.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Sparkler lighting the way, we're with Joe and Alice -- Pruitt
text: and Tina behind them:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Sheriff, I really think we're going
dialog: the wrong way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRUITT
dialog: We'll talk about it when we get up
dialog: top.
dialog: 
text: They continue following Pruitt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY (O.S.)
dialog: Joe!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I told you to get out!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: I thought this was the way out. I
dialog: tried! Hey, Alice, welcome back--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRUITT
dialog: Kids, come on, we gotta go.
dialog: 117.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BUT HE'S LOOKING BACK AND HIS SPARKLER ILLUMINATES THE
text: CREATURE THAT IS RIGHT UP AHEAD AND TINA SCREAMS -- THEY ALL
text: DO AS PRUITT TURNS AND IS TAKEN, LIFTED HIGH, KILLED IN THE
text: DARK AS THEY ALL TURN AND RUN -- PRUITT'S HORRIBLE SCREAMS
text: terrifying as the foursome sprint in the opposite direction!
text: After RUNNING HARD for a beat:
dialog: 
text: They haul ass, but after a long moment TINA IS GRABBED AWAY
text: INTO THE DARKNESS!!! HER SCREAMS CONTINUE behind them --
dialog: 
text: They run and run and run, but then BOOM: they hit a DEAD END.
text: A DIRT WALL. No more tunnels. No options. Out of breath, they
text: turn -- but dare not go back toward the horrifying blackness.
text: The only SOUND the sparkler, their erratic breathing and the
text: DISTANT INCREASING PITCH OF THE CREATURE'S MECHANICAL DEVICE.
dialog: 
text: THE CREATURE IS THERE -- FORTY FEET FROM THEM, --
scene_heading: APPROACHING! ALICE SCREAMS -- SHE AND CARY MORE BACK AGAINST
text: THE WALL -- AND THE CREATURE MOVES FOR THEM, BUT JOE YELLS AS
text: THE THING PASSES THE FIREWORKS:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: GO! YOU DON'T WANNA BE HERE, GO!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: Joe, what are you doing?
dialog: 
text: IT KEEPS COMING -- PAST THE FIREWORKS, AMAZINGLY BACKLIT AS
text: IT LUMBERS TOWARD JOE, DESPERATELY TRYING TO STAND GROUND:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
text: WE UNDERSTAND! WE KNOW HOW HARD
text: IT'S BEEN! BUT NOT EVERYONE IS
speaker_heading: HORRIBLE!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: Joe, shut up, it's gonna kill you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY NOW!
dialog: 
text: AND IT GRABS JOE AND LIFTS HIM -- Alice and Cary SCREAM AS
text: JOE IS BEING SQUEEZED -- HE LOOKS INTO THE GLOSSY BLACK EYES
text: OF THIS BEAST, WHICH COULD KILL HIM AT ANY TIME -- but in
text: this moment of fear comes something else. Simple truth -- he
scene_heading: WHISPERS, SHAKILY:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: -- I know bad things happen-- bad
dialog: things happen, but you can still
dialog: live. You can still live, you can
dialog: still live, you're gonna be okay--
dialog: 118.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: JUST AS WE THINK THE CREATURE'S GONNA KILL HIM: A DISTANT
scene_heading: MECHANICAL TONE -- THE CREATURE TURNS, ACKNOWLEDGING THAT
scene_heading: SOUND -- THEN TO JOE AGAIN. IT CONSIDERS HIM. ITS EYES'
scene_heading: COVERING PEELS AWAY -- REVEALING HUGE, WET, VULNERABLE EYES.
text: AND THE THING LOOKS AT HIM. REALLY LOOKS AT HIM. In a way, as
dialog: you imagine his mother once had. And Joe feels this too. AND
text: AFTER A LONG, SCARY BEAT, THE CREATURE SETS HIM DOWN. Joe
text: backs up as the creature TURNS FAST AND SPEEDS AWAY. JOE IS
scene_heading: STUNNED. SHOCKED RELIEF. ALICE AND CARY, TOO --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: Okay, wait a minute, WHAT?!
dialog: 
text: Then, over the HIGH-PITCHED MECHANICAL SOUND comes RUMBLINGS -
text: - like THUNDER from above -- and the three LOOK UP --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - MAIN STREET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The kids round a corner -- ON MAIN STREET, COUNTLESS METALLIC
scene_heading: OBJECTS -- ANYTHING METAL AND LOOSE -- has been INVISIBLY
text: DRAGGED -- FLOATING -- toward the WATER TOWER -- at different
text: speeds and with different personalities, metal objects BULLET
text: TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER AND STICK THERE.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, THE DINER WINDOW SHATTERS as a STOVE RIPS THROUGH
text: IT -- we PAN WITH IT as it TUMBLES TOWARD AND UP THE WATER
text: TOWER! HUNDREDS OF OBJECTS move past them -- from bicycles to
text: silverware and sinks! DISHWASHERS AND TVS SMASH THROUGH THE
scene_heading: TOWN'S APPLIANCE STORE WINDOW -- A TV FLOATS, UNPLUGGED, PAST
text: THE KIDS -- AND IT IS ON -- AND SHOWS AN EPISODE FROM THE
text: TWILIGHT ZONE -- all things eventually SLAMMING into the
text: WATER TOWER, the objects BEGINNING TO CRUSH TOGETHER, FORMING
dialog: ONE DENSE METALLIC MASS!
dialog: 
text: BAM! BAMBAM! Sounds like GUN BLASTS -- the KIDS TURN: behind
text: them are the RED CARGO CONTAINERS -- ONE BY ONE those cubes
text: BURST THROUGH THE CONTAINERS: BAM! BAMBAMBAM! BAMBAM! And
text: they SLAM INTO THE WATER TOWER -- AND THEY BEGIN TO FORM AN
text: ODD, HUGE CRESCENT SHAPE ABOVE THE TOWER! Alice is cry-
dialog: laughing at seeing it work --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARY
dialog: -- what's he doing...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: ... he's making a model.
dialog: 
text: AGAIN and AGAIN, pieces FLY OVERHEAD, beginning to FORM WHAT
text: IS CLEARLY AN ALIEN CRAFT -- LIGHTS BEGINNING TO ILLUMINATE
text: FROM INSIDE as it continues -- ONE OF THE SPOTLIGHTS
text: ILLUMINATING A JEEP THAT HAS JUST ARRIVED: JACK GETS OUT. HE
scene_heading: SEES JOE. JOE IS SURPRISED TO SEE HIM -- ALICE CONCERNED.
dialog: 119.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BUT THEN THE KIDS ARE BOTH INCREDULOUS TO SEE JACK HELP LOUIS
text: OUT OF THE JEEP -- THE TWO MEN MOVE THROUGH THE DEBRIS IN THE
text: STREETS, STUNNED AT THE ACTIVITY SURROUNDING THEM, BUT
text: FOCUSED ON THEIR CHILDREN; A TUMBLING TYPEWRITER ALMOST TAKES
text: OUT JACK, BUT HE AVOIDS IT AS IT SHOOTS UP TO THE WATER
text: TOWER.
dialog: 
text: JACK GETS TO HIS SON -- HOLDS HIS SHOULDERS -- LOOKS DEEPLY
text: INTO HIS EYES, TOUCHES HIS FACE AND EMBRACES HIM --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: -- I got you. I got you.
dialog: 
text: LOUIS, CRYING, DESPERATELY SORRY -- AND SHE SEES THIS IN HIS
scene_heading: SAD, WOUNDED FACE -- SHE HOLDS OUT A HAND -- HE TAKES IT AND
text: PULLS HER INTO AN EMBRACE, HUGGING HIS DAUGHTER DESPERATELY.
dialog: 
text: BEHIND THEM, THE SHIP CONTINUES TO TAKE SHAPE, ALMOST FULLY-
text: FORMED -- but here, as he is being hugged by his father, Joe
text: LOOKS DOWN: SOMETHING IN HIS POCKET Is MOVING -- he considers
text: it, confused for a moment -- but he reaches in and pulls it
text: out. HIS MOTHER'S NECKLACE -- and he holds the chain, but the
text: LOCKET PULLS TOWARD THE WATER TOWER -- wanting to go.
dialog: 
text: Joe knows what this means. He looks up at his father, who
text: also understand. AND THIS IS WHEN WE GO INTO SLOW MOTION --
text: FROM HERE UNTIL THE END. After a long beat, Joe HOLDS THE
text: NECKLACE UP, toward the tower -- the thing PULLING... TEARS
text: in Joe's eyes as he looks up at it -- not wanting to let go,
text: but knowing he must. Jack, heartsick, watches his son, on the
text: verge of letting go. Alice watches Joe, on the verge of tears
dialog: -- except Joe just can't bring himself to do it, not now, not
dialog: ever. But then something happens.
dialog: 
text: Pulled by the invisible force, THE LOCKET POPS OPEN. And we
text: see what's inside. A PHOTOGRAPH of Joe's MOTHER. A young
text: woman, HOLDING HER ONE SMALL BABY. And Joe looks at his
text: mother -- and in this moment, she at him and Jack's eyes
text: suddenly WELL WITH TEARS -- Alice, too, tears streaming down
text: her face and finally Jack reaches out -- and puts his hand on
dialog: his son's shoulder -- which was all Joe needed, really.
dialog: 
text: And finally... after all... JOE LETS GO. OUR SCORE SOARS AS,
text: IN SLOW MOTION, the necklace SHOOTS ACROSS THE MAIN STREET UP
text: TO THE WATER TOWER!
dialog: 
text: AND WHEN IT HITS, THE ENTIRE TOWER IMPLODES FROM PRESSURE --
text: A FIREWORKS-LIKE EXPLOSION OF WATER BURSTS AND SHOWERS THE
scene_heading: STREET AS THE MAJESTIC SHIP COMPLETES ITS FORMATION -- and
text: that's when Joe sees the CREATURE, LEAVING -- CLIMBING UP THE
text: WATER TOWER AND ENTERS HIS SHIP -- AND IT BEGINS TO LIFT. AS
text: IT TAKES OFF, THE WEIGHT OF THE TOWER IS TOO MUCH: IT
text: COLLAPSES INTO MAIN STREET.
dialog: 120.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: THE SHIP RISES SLOWLY INTO THE SKY -- ITS PURE WHITE
scene_heading: SPOTLIGHTS FINALLY SCANNING THE GROUND BENEATH IT -- LILLIAN,
scene_heading: OHIO -- EARTH -- A PLANET IT IS FINALLY LEAVING --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT./EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: And we PUSH IN on Charles and Marin, who watch, amazed, as
text: the distant light RISES INTO THE SKY --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: And we PUSH IN as DONNY SLEEPS, the REFLECTION OF THE RISING
text: SHIP seen in his windshield --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - MAIN STREET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Joe and Alice, Jack, Louis and Cary watch, amazed, as the
text: ship disappears into the night sky, we are TIGHT ON JOE'S
text: HAND, as it takes ALICE'S.
dialog: 
text: And looking skyward, Joe smiles.
dialog: 
text: As our SCORE SWELLS, we finally...
dialog: 
text: FADE TO BLACK.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE END
