dialog: Written by
dialog: John Fusco
dialog: Fourth draft
dialog: Oct. 5, 1990
dialog: 
text: A DRUM. Beating slow. And deep. Like a heart.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. THE GREAT PLAINS SOUTH DAKOTA - DAWN
text: Something is rising from the Black Hills. A sphere of light,
text: too red to be the sun. A sphere of contained fire, undulating
text: in crimson and ochre, and rising slowly, majestically, to
text: the pulse. To the DRUM. It is the sun. But it is a Paha Sapa
text: sunrise. A Black Hills sunrise. And it is spectacular.
text: The DRUM, pounds deeper, bigger, as the sun gets higher.
text: Stronger. Igniting a vast landscape of gentle slopes and
text: foothills; throwing shadows on the plains that look like, as
text: the Indians say, an old man dancing. The grass is golden.
text: And high. The wind moves through it, snakes through it.
dialog: Slowly.
scene_heading: BEGIN CREDITS.
text: Voices; a TRADITIONAL INDIAN SONG (Lakota), summoning Wakan
dialog: Tanka - The Great Mystery.
text: And now, rising up over one of the small land waves, a head
text: comes into view. Shoulders. A man, running in ghostly SLOW
text: MOTION, his long black hair trailing in the wind. The INDIAN
text: MAN wears only buckskin pants and a bone choker around his
dialog: neck.
text: Legs and arms churning, the man runs with antelope grace,
text: backlit by the sunrise, bounding toward us. Running... his
text: heart pounding. SONG RISING... DRUM POUNDING... FIVE MORE
text: VOICES in high-pitched tremolo join the song.
text: And then the runner soars, like an eagle from a bluff,
text: airborne, flying over a small dip, arms outstretched, and it
dialog: would be a wondrous thing if there were not a fine, crimson,
text: mist all around him and if slow motion was not suddenly
text: overtaken by LIVE SPEED, revealing the brutal force of gunfire
text: which has slammed the Indian into the air, throwing him.
text: Slamming him hard into the grass. And it is over as quickly
text: and violently as a deer shot dead.
text: LAKOTA SONG ends abruptly.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - THE GREAT PLAINS
text: the sun burns like lava at the horizon. DRUM beats like a
text: heart. And Somewhere off in a distant cottonwood, an OWL.
text: Then Silence. Deep, disturbing stillness.
scene_heading: EXT. CAPITAL BELTWAY - WASHINGTON. D.C - DAY
text: ROCK N'ROLL shatters the silence.
text: Cars -- a multicolored metallic criss-cross reflecting off a
text: building made of mirrors -- races past an electronic billboard
text: that blinks in red skyhigh digital: PRUDENTIAL LIFE INSURANCE.
text: 7:59. 73 degrees.
text: The D.C. Superhighway. And off behind it, in the distance,
text: Capital Hill holds imposing vigil, the massive cast iron
text: dome of The Capital, catching the sun. But everything is
text: soon smothered by a METRO BUS, hogging the far lane of the
text: Beltway, leaning on its HORN.
dialog: Good morning.
dialog: And the rock n'roll is everybody's radio, everybody's tempo.
scene_heading: CARBON MONOXIDE WAVE
text: shimmers across the beltway hugging then releasing a solitary
text: vehicle that we stay with... move with... A black Nissan 240
text: SX, hard-waxed.
scene_heading: INT. 240 SX - TRAVELING
text: Behind the wheel -- an intense young man with close-cropped
text: black hair, eyes hidden by sunglasses. Whatever he does for
text: a living, he does in a suit (not expensive but well-fit. But
dialog: we might also note that any extra suit cash has gone instead
text: into the silver-plated watch on his left wrist). Lean as a
text: rake, sallow in the cheeks, there is something insatiable
text: about him -- a hungry energy that won't let him go.
text: RAY LEVOI, late 20's, early 30's, pulls out of a threatening
text: traffic jam and races on the narrow right between thirty
text: cars and a cement girder.
scene_heading: EXT. T STREET - OUTSIDE WEST-CENTRAL
text: The black SX has jumped off an exit and has entered the light-
text: industrial section of Washington. It pulls up near a loading
text: dock behind an old gray building and several parked cars and
text: vans. Ray steps out, smooths his jacket, locks and SETS HIS
speaker_heading: CAR ALARM.
text: Another young man -- chubby, clean-shaven; in a nicer suit
text: than Ray's -- steps out from a parked Miata, and approaches
text: Ray. CARL PODJWICK balances a coffee, a U.S.A. Today and a
text: black eel-skin briefcase.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Hey. Nice tie.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Don't get too attached.
text: They start walking briskly toward the loading dock.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Ya got the paper?
text: They mount steps.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You're my hero, Carl.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm
dialog: shakin', man, look at me.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
text: They stop at the door of a service elevator and Carl breathes.
text: Expanding his chest, exhaling. Ray adjusts Carl's tie for
text: him, his collar. He speaks quietly. Quickly.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Anyone stops us going in, we're with
dialog: the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company.
dialog: We have rug samples.
speaker_heading: CARL
text: Rug samples.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: We are one-dimensional, boring
text: peddlers of fine carpet, Carl.
text: Carl nods. Ray hesitates, adjusts his own collar and enters
text: the service elevator. Carl follows. Door closes.
scene_heading: BEGIN CREDITS END.
scene_heading: INT. GRAY BUILDING - FENCING OPERATION
text: Carl follows Ray into the big sparse room of unfinished
text: sheetrock walls. There is nothing in here but cardboard boxes,
text: and two people; a bearded HISPANIC MAN standing behind a
text: counter, writing on a clipboard. The other is a middle-aged
text: BLACK MAN in a purple silk shirt sitting in a chair with a
text: newspaper held open. He barely looks over the top of the
dialog: Wall Street Journal.
speaker_heading: BLACK MAN
dialog: Hey, look who's here.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Louis, my man, what's happenin'?
text: Ray walks up to the counter. Carl lingers, fidgeting. Ray
text: sets his briefcase on the counter and click-clicks it open.
text: The Hispanic fence man looks inside, and begins pulling out
text: stacks of treasury checks.
speaker_heading: FENCE MAN
dialog: Clean ones?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Immaculate.
text: Ray gestures to Carl and he nervously sets his briefcase on
text: the counter, fumbles with the first latch. The second. He
text: flips it open.
text: The fence man casts his eyes down at a neat cache of Grade A
text: Treasury. A lot of it. Then his eyes rise to Carl.
speaker_heading: FENCE MAN
dialog: What ya got there, seventy-five
dialog: thousand?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: A hundred and ten. Count it.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (BLACK MAN)
dialog: Have the girl count it, we can't sit
dialog: around here countin' bonds, we got
dialog: things to do here.
text: The fence man pushes an intercom button and yells into a
dialog: speaker.
speaker_heading: FENCE MAN
dialog: SALLLLY!
text: Carl's eyes flit to Ray. Ray's eyes flit to Carl.
text: Louis crushes his newspaper down and lifts a big Colt Python
dialog: from his lap just as --
text: A section of sheetrock kicks open and THREE FEDERAL OFFICERS
text: bust out, each clutching a handgun, SHOUTING inaudibly.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: F.B.I.! Get your face on the fuckin'
dialog: floor! MOVE!
text: Carl startled, does an almost effeminate dip down to one
text: knee, but that knee is swept out from under him, slapping
text: him flat onto plywood where he is instantly frisked down by
text: the fence man who is wielding a 9 mm handgun. But the white
text: collar criminal is more stunned by the fact that --
text: Ray is walking across the floor with his hands in his pockets
text: over to the Mr. Coffee. He pours one, and adds some milk.
text: Turns and watches the bust while opening a packet of Sweet
dialog: n'Low.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Slam dunk.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Beauty. Beauty...
text: Ray rests his weight against the coffee station, takes a
text: careful sip. Carl is yanked to his feet by the fence man and
text: he stands there, looking at Ray, baffled. Completely shocked.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu--
dialog: Larry. That's not even your name, is
dialog: it? What's your real name, you fucking
dialog: scumbag?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Don't have one, Carl. I have a number,
dialog: man. Just like the numbers on those
dialog: treasury checks. You stole from your
dialog: own country, Carl. Shame on you.
text: Coffee in hand, Ray walks briskly toward the door.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Sugar Ray.
text: Ray turns. Louis takes a few steps toward him, putting his
text: gun back in his waistband.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: They want ya Home. Upstairs wants to
dialog: see ya.
text: Ray stands frozen, holding the door knob, and digesting what
dialog: are apparently influential words.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Make sure ya spell my name right.
text: Ray just stares for a moment. Then hurries out the door.
text: Carl, being arm-gripped by two agents and photographed like
text: a trout, gazes bewildered at the door.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: We just spent four months together...
dialog: I thought he was my friend... what
dialog: the fuck, man?
dialog: (even more incredulous)
dialog: He had dinner at my mother's.
text: CAMERA FLASHES at him, an agent on either side, striking a
dialog: natural pose.
scene_heading: EXT. J. EDGAR HOOVER BUILDING - ESTABLISHING - DAY
text: The huge, imposing, mausoleum-like Hoover building, bordered
text: by artificial turf, hemmed by cherry trees in blossom. Turning
dialog: out to be a nice day on Pennsylvania Avenue.
scene_heading: INT. FBI DIRECTOR'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: 8x10 BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOS dealt like cards onto a table,
text: one on top of another.
text: 1 -- an aerial shot of some wasteland.
text: 2 -- a closer bird's eye of the same, what looks like a NASA
dialog: photo of Mars.
text: 3 -- a vast expanse of the Great Plains.
text: ROBERT F. TULLY, Number-Two-in-Command, deals a fourth photo
text: onto the table. He is an understated, fatherly man, well-
text: manicured in cotton pencil-striped shirt, white-tab collar
text: and tie. The photos and maps and files a foot deep on the
text: huge table are neatly organized.
speaker_heading: INTERCOM
dialog: SA Levoi, Sir.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Please.
text: Seated, at the far end of the table, engrossed in the deep
scene_heading: spread of information, SA (Special Agent) FRANK COUTURE is
text: about to break the record for longest single ash on the end
text: of a cigarette and the smoke forces his eyes into tight,
text: concentrating, slits. "COOCH" as they call him in the Bureau
dialog: has seen thirty years in some rough "provinces". He has
dialog: survived the Hoover era and is a legend in the Sessions era
text: but survival has honed an edge. An edge with a touch of ironic
dialog: cop humor.
text: Ray enters, walks into a firm shake.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Ray...
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Mister Tully.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Do you want a coffee?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No. No, no. Thank you.
text: Ray sits nervously across from Cooch who looks up from the
text: photos and studies the younger man through reading glasses
text: and cigarette smoke, and he looks at him like he doesn't
text: know who the hell he is or why he's sitting there.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal
dialog: Division.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Oh, yeah -- right.
text: Cooch sticks his cigarette in his left hand, shakes with his
dialog: right.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Ray this is --
speaker_heading: RAY / TULLY
dialog: Frank Couture.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: COUTURE
dialog: Hello, Ray.
text: The handshake is still locked. Cooch is still squinting at
text: the younger agent. Ray obviously knows something about Agent
dialog: Couture.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: It's an honor.
text: Tully leans back in his chair, crosses his legs casually.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Ray, we're taking you off the street.
dialog: We need you out in South Dakota.
text: Ray's enthusiasm suddenly deflates.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: South Dakota...
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Did I do something unsatisfactory,
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame
dialog: that on your grandmother.
text: Ray looks completely baffled now, swinging a look from Cooch
dialog: to Tully.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.
dialog: (scanning file)
dialog: French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and
dialog: one-eighth American Indian.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Sioux Indian, right?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: -- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
text: Ray nods, looks from Tully to Cooch. What's going on here?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Ray, there's been a homicide out in
text: an area known as The Badlands. Indian
dialog: Reservation.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: It's not the first. There's been
dialog: several. And our field office in
dialog: Rapid City is getting a lot of heat...
dialog: none of the investigations have turned
dialog: up jack shit.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: The main problem is, Ray, these people
dialog: are extremely distrustful of
dialog: outsiders, non-Indians. Relations
dialog: have not been amicable.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Different culture. Hard to penetrate.
dialog: The Indians don't like white cops
dialog: poking around. And that's why we're
dialog: in a position where we have to bring
text: in an American Indian agent.
text: Tully straightens the edges of a bureau memorandum.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: With an Indian representative out
dialog: there, we hope to keep hostilities
dialog: dormant; this is a COINTELPRO,
dialog: Selective Operations Unit, and it'll
dialog: be easier on Agent Couture if you
dialog: can gain the people's trust and maybe --
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what
dialog: you're saying... I've got a little
dialog: Indian blood, that's true. But --
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I am not an... an Indian. I can't
dialog: just go in and --
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: -- your father was part Sioux.
text: A beat. Ray lowers his eyes to the photos.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I didn't know him, Sir. He passed
dialog: away when I was six.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Seven.
text: Ray looks up at Cooch. Another uneasy beat. Cooch lights a
text: cigarette as if lighting a cigarette was a science.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Don't worry about it, Ray. As long
dialog: as the people have proof that we
dialog: sent them one of their own, no one's
dialog: gonna ask you to weave baskets or
dialog: make it rain.
text: Ray sits before the files and photos, looking unsure. He has
text: come to garner a promotion but has just been sent to The
text: Graveyard. Or in the FBI argot, Indian Country.
text: Tully pivots his leather chair in a full circle and slaps an
text: assignment folder down in front of the young agent.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GREAT PLAINS - SOUTH DAKOTA - DAWN
text: The very landscape from opening image. Gentle waves of land,
text: rolling out to touch the Black Hills. The sun rises up out
text: of the distant silhouette like a waking God. HEARTBEAT DRUM.
dialog: Hypnotic.
text: And then a car blows by, throwing up gravel and agate and
text: gypsum. ZOOOOM! Right by us. Gone.
text: When a dense screen of red dust clears, an old, bent, metal
text: sign at roadside becomes visible. It reads, through punched
text: and rusted bullet holes: "Entering Bear Creek Indian
dialog: Reservation."
text: HEARTBEAT DRUM calls in the high-pitched, mournful voices of
text: LAKOTA SINGERS. The same haunting song.
scene_heading: INT. LE BARON - MOVING
text: Cooch is at the wheel. Ray, passenger. His lap is a desk for
text: several folders, and he works through them as they drive.
text: Both agents eat a sandwich as they travel.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Eight murders in less than a year.
dialog: All of them Indian. All of them
dialog: unsolved. Is the law a non-entity
dialog: out here or what?
text: Cooch opens a folder that sits between them, and taking his
text: eyes off the road for a dangerous five seconds, locates some
text: photos, and hands them to Ray. Ray's expression tells us
dialog: they are not pretty.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Those are two agents who went into a
dialog: reservation a few years ago to serve
dialog: a warrant. They were executed at
dialog: close range. That one there is a
dialog: police officer killed by the Mohawks
dialog: up in Canada more recently.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Jesus...
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: The agents who have worked out here
dialog: say its like going into Nam.
text: Unfamiliar terrain, foreign language,
dialog: foreign customs... and you never
dialog: know when you might walk into a few
dialog: rounds. They hold a lot of old anger
dialog: for the white man out here.
text: Ray considers this as he looks out at the unfamiliar terrain
text: while on the RADIO, a D.J. speaks in LAKOTA LANGUAGE. Ray...
text: back at Cooch, studying his face.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Were you in Nam?
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Airborne. That's where they used to
dialog: get us agents from. Now we get 'em
dialog: from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League.
text: Accountants and computer whiz-kids.
text: Yuppies with guns.
dialog: (lights a smoke)
dialog: That's scary shit.
text: Ray smiles, sets the AC on high.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Not as scary as a Hoover man with a
dialog: computer.
text: Cooch throws a quick look Ray's way. And a smile. He
text: appreciates the sting of a right off a left.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've
dialog: loved you. He'd love anybody who
dialog: joined the bureau to, what was it?
dialog: "To enforce the laws of my country
dialog: and protect her interests"?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You crashed my file?
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: No. I consulted it. We're going into
dialog: Indian Country, I wanna know what
dialog: kind of individual is covering my
dialog: ass. Don't you?
text: Ray has finished his sandwich. He wipes his hands on a
text: kerchief while taking in the sight of chalky buttes cramming
text: roadside.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You've been in the bureau for thirty
dialog: years. You survived The Hoov, the
dialog: Black Panthers and Abscam. I don't
dialog: see any bullet holes. That's good
dialog: enough for me.
text: Cooch looks at Ray, amused. He likes this guy. And then he
text: notices a look of growing consternation on his partner's
dialog: face.
scene_heading: RAY'S POV - MOVING
text: as they drive through the first settlement, a little, broken
text: and scattered community, littered with wrecked cars on blocks,
text: and overpopulated with hungry dogs. HEARTBEAT DRUM softly
dialog: under.
text: SIX INDIAN CHILDREN with dirty but beautiful faces and long
text: blue black hair run alongside the car, curious. One of them
text: YELLS SOMETHING we don't understand.
text: PAST the trading post -- a white man's store -- where SIX
text: OGLALA SIOUX -- four men, two women sit like wax figures,
text: only their eyes moving to light on the freshly waxed
dialog: government car.
text: A little house has a tipi erected beside it. And a satellite
text: dish. The house beside that one has been half chopped away
dialog: to feed the wood stove.
dialog: Poverty.
scene_heading: EXT. BEAR CREEK COMMUNITY - RESERVATION - DAY
text: The federal car drives out of the community and further into
text: vast bluffs and strange rock formations where it is swallowed,
text: leaving the ramshackle village in dust.
text: A lone dog -- all its ribs showing -- chases, BARKING.
scene_heading: EXT. BADLANDS - SHORT TIME LATER
dialog: We are on the Moon. Or Israel. But not America. Not any
text: America we've ever seen. A thirty-mile eroded landscape of
text: dunes and crevices, soft rock strata and fossils. Barren.
text: And eerie. A LAKOTA DEATH SONG underscores the otherworldly
dialog: ambiance of this place as --
text: SHOES scuff through the gumbo and multi-colored stones. Two
text: pair of black, spit-shined, lace-ups. Three. Tripping.
text: Scuffing. And then a fourth pair. But they are not loafers.
dialog: They are Georgio Brutini's and they belong to --
text: Ray, as he and Cooch follow two Special Agents from the
text: regional office. SA MILES is about Cooch's age, balding. SA
text: SHERMAN is closer to Ray's age but instead of a suit like
text: the rest, he favors an army-green jacket. Neither is a South
text: Dakota shit-kicker but transplanted field agents. All four
text: shield their eyes with dark glasses, and here in the Badlands
text: it is wise because the sun makes dunes shimmy and craters
text: become faces. It plays mischief on the eye, making Ray and
dialog: Sherman nearly trip on --
speaker_heading: A DEAD BODY
text: lying face down in the rainbow sand. Dried blood and horse
text: flies cover his blown out torso. The agents stand over him,
text: breathless from the rugged walk.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Who found him?
speaker_heading: MILES
text: Indian kids. Hunting fossils.
text: Cooch studies the body from where he stands. Sherman hands a
dialog: file over to Ray.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Okay. I think Agent Levoi and I can
dialog: proceed from here. What are your
dialog: call signals?
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
dialog: PX-10 and 11. Anything we can do to
dialog: help you out, just radio.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Good. Thanks, Guys.
text: The agents start back through the Badlands. Ray is already
text: squatting a safe distance from the body, covering his nose
text: with a kerchief while looking in the file.
text: Cooch takes a bended knee on the other side of the body.
text: Flies buzz on and around the corpse.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Leo Fast Elk... Thirty seven...
dialog: single... Member of the Tribal
dialog: Council.
text: Cooch makes a note then slowly circles the body. He holds a
text: hand out to Ray and the younger agent turns the file over.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Looks like Fast Elk wasn't fast enough
dialog: to outrun that load. What do you
dialog: make of the damage?
text: Ray gets closer, swats at Flies with the folder.
speaker_heading: RAY
text: Six rounds. 357.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: That's what it looks like, doesn't
dialog: it? But that's what a ten gauge,
text: choke-bored, shotgun will look like
dialog: when it hits your lower back from
text: five feet away.
text: Ray looks up impressed. Cooch rises and walks off gingerly,
text: scanning the surroundings.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Somebody was serious about doing
dialog: this guy, that's for sure.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Ray.
text: Cooch is standing ten feet away, staring at the ground. Ray
text: walks over, carefully. He follows Cooch's frown down at the
text: twisted layers of earth.
text: ON THE GROUND
text: a circle has been etched deep in the soft gumbo, and in the
text: center of the circle, a white eagle plume sticks straight
text: up, dancing in the wind.
text: Cooch and Ray each lower themselves to their haunches to
text: study the strange sight. Cooch puts his reading glasses on,
text: stares at it. Then lights a cigarette.
text: Ray hefts up a camera and begins CLICKING off shots. He starts
text: moving around it, taking shots at different angles. And then
text: the sound of a DISTANT MOTOR draws both agent's attention.
speaker_heading: POV:
text: way out in the bizarre moonscape of eroded rock and earth, a
text: lone figure on a motorcycle bounces and grinds, born out of
text: a silvery heat mirage. It's fifty yards off but heading
text: straight for us. The HEARTBEAT DRUM.
text: REVERSE - RAY AND COOCH try to make the figure out.
text: IN THE BADLANDS
text: the archaic mud-caked Harley chugs and stalls, spits and
text: choices, and begins an incredible drive straight up the steep
text: side of this natural wonder. At the throttle is an imposing
dialog: figure.
text: WALTER CROW HORSE is a portly Indian in his late-thirties
text: with a black reservation hat worn low over a face that seems
text: to have been cast from a bust of Sitting Bull. Sitting Bull
text: with aviator shades. Denim jacket over checkered shirt. Faded
text: jeans. Well broken duct-taped boots. His hair is worn long
text: in tight duel braids.
text: The rusted bike bajas up and down slopes, finally stalling
text: out, twenty feet or so from the murder site. Crow Horse swings
text: his bulk off the bike like dismounting a horse. He looks
text: around suspiciously then pulls a rolled-up blanket from the
text: carrier rack.
scene_heading: LEO LITTLE SKY
text: lies in death. Crow Horse's boots move in stealthily, creaking
text: like saddle leather.
text: He squats and looks at the corpse... then looks around with
text: animal alertness. He reaches into the front pocket of his
text: jacket and pulls out some Bull Durham tobacco. He pinches
text: some and offers it to the four directions around the body.
text: He then unrolls the blanket, begins to move the dead man...
text: sense something and wheels to see Cooch standing behind him,
text: one hand behind his back where his gun must be, and the other
text: hand holding up open wallet. The sun hits his badge.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Good morning.
text: Crow Horse hawks his eyes onto a big rock, a full second
text: before Ray steps out, his .45 drawn but held at ease.
text: Crow Horse slowly raises his arms as Ray moves up to him,
text: studying him.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Leo's been out here too long, man.
dialog: I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: This is a restricted area.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Check him out, Ray.
text: Ray frisks the Indian, finds an old leather wallet, and then
text: a gun. A .38.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Nice piece. You come back here to
dialog: cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's
dialog: your name?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: It ain't Geronimo.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: I think maybe you guys got off the
dialog: wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear
dialog: Creek Indian Reservation.
text: Cooch walks around to the front of Crow Horse, and studies
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: I know where I am. I'm on federal
dialog: land, doing a federal investigation,
dialog: and if you don't wanna cooperate you
dialog: can take a ride in a federal car,
dialog: and spend the rest of the day in a
dialog: little room, answering federal
dialog: questions. It's your call. Who are
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born
dialog: and raised on this reservation.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: You're a wise-ass. Ray check his
dialog: wallet.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Who the fuck is he?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: -- a fucking cop.
text: A pause. A long, dead of South Dakota, Badlands pause. Cooch
text: turns and looks at Ray who holds up the open wallet, revealing
text: a badge. Like Cooch's it shines in the sun.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Walter Crow Horse. Tribal Police.
text: Cooch stands staring at the Indian... then takes a few steps
text: over to Ray and grabs the wallet. He examines it. Then looks
text: at Crow Horse and laughs.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: He's a fucking cop.
text: The Indian cop has plenty of time to get up on his own but
text: he kneels there, tauntingly, waiting for Ray to help him.
text: Ray walks over and offers a hand. Crow Horse takes it, and
text: pulls himself up, looking square into Ray's sunglasses.
text: Cooch walks over and hands the officer his wallet, and his
text: .23. Crow Horse takes the items, eyeing the older agent.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: We got the wire ya was comin'. You're
dialog: the Indian official, yeah?
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...
dialog: (searching his
dialog: imagination)
dialog: Ray... Little Weasel.
text: Ray does a take but quickly recovers, meeting Crow Horse's
text: scrutinizing gaze. Crow Horse nods to Ray, and Ray nods back
text: in case it's the Indian thing to do. Crow Horse nods again.
text: Ray nods again.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Leo's gotta get to burial, Brother.
dialog: He's gotta make the journey.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: What journey?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Tell him, Ray.
text: Ray stares at Crow Horse, uneasy. The wind sings through the
dialog: Badlands.
speaker_heading: RAY
text: Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: We'll have to give Leo a refund.
dialog: Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In
dialog: case you don't know, Officer,
dialog: violation of the Major Crimes Act on --
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: -- an Indian Reservation is within
dialog: the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau
dialog: of Intimidation. I know that.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Good. Thank you.
text: Crow Horse says something in Sioux to Ray. Ray just stares.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: I said when can Leo be taken to
dialog: ceremony?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: After we've completed our
dialog: investigation.
text: Crow Horse is staring at Ray.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: That's a nice suit.
text: Ray looks offended. Cooch puts a hand on Crow Horse's shoulder
text: and walks him toward his beat-up motorcycle.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Somebody must be doing something
dialog: somewhere in your jurisdiction,
dialog: Officer Crow Foot.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: You ain't gonna cut his hands off
dialog: and send 'em to Washinton, are ya?
dialog: They done that to one of our girls
dialog: once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna
dialog: need his hands.
text: Crow Horse turns and looks at Ray. Ray is quick this time.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch.
text: He does quillwork.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: I think Leo's retired from quillwork
dialog: for the moment.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: -- did you understand me when I said
dialog: that --
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: (walking away)
dialog: -- violation of the Major Crimes Act
dialog: on an Indian Reservation is within
dialog: the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau
dialog: of Instigation. I know that.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Goodbye.
text: Crow Horse appears to be getting on his bike when suddenly
text: he moves like a cat and lays his knife to the dead man's
text: head. He cuts away a patch of hair.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: What the hell you doing?!
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
text: His mother needs a piece of his hair.
dialog: It's for the Keeping of the Souls
dialog: Ceremony.
dialog: (wrapping lock of
dialog: hair)
dialog: Has to be kept for four days.
text: Cooch and Ray stand there, watching Crow Horse mount his
text: bike and push off down a nasty slope back through the
text: Badlands. He starts his motor. It dies. Then starts again.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Keeping of the souls. Do they still
dialog: burn their dead or something?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Beats the hell outta me.
text: Ray and Cooch look off across the Badlands, as far out of
dialog: their element as they can be.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON - THE WHITE EAGLE PLUME
text: in the circle in the sand, fluttering in the wind.
text: The gold spit-shined Le Baron eases to a crawl, passing an
text: old wooden sign. "Leaving Bear Creak Indian Reservation."
text: And immediately pulling in front of a squat old bar with a
text: burned out neon Miller light. DWIGHT YOAKUM croons "Youuuuuu-
text: Got-Your Little-Ways" on the jukebox from inside.
text: The Buffalo Butte bar has several cracked and sun-bleached
text: buffalo skulls hanging off the edge of its flat roof and big
text: faded white letters painted across the front read: "No Indians
dialog: Allowed."
text: (This sign actually exists today in the res-line border town
text: of Scenic, South Dakota). The car pulls up beside a pick-up
text: and parks. Ray and Cooch step out, careful to walk wide around
text: a PITBULL in the bed of the truck.
text: A WHITE LOCAL walks out of the bar and looks askance at the
text: suits. As the two feds approach the bar, Cooch looks up at
text: the warning sign. Ray sees it too.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Sorry, Ray. You're gonna have to
dialog: wait in the car. I'll bring you out
text: a cheeseburger.
text: The young agent smiles, amused, starts to enter the bar but --
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Hey!
text: Ray spins quickly, paranoid about entering. But the man
dialog: calling to them is --
scene_heading: An Indian himself. TRIBAL PRESIDENT OLIVER CLEAR MOON, a
text: small man in his late fifties who peers out at the agents
text: through fat bifocals. He wears a straw cowboy hat, red
text: windbreaker and his hair is cut short, or "bobtailed" as the
dialog: Indians say.
text: Clear Moon is walking away from a parked pick-up truck, toward
text: the white men, eyeing the two with deep curiosity.
speaker_heading: CLEAR MOON
dialog: (heavy Indian accent)
dialog: You made it. Was-te.
text: Cooch discreetly peeks into a folder as he walks toward the
dialog: man
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: You must be... President Clear Bone.
speaker_heading: CLEAR MOON
dialog: Clear Moon.
dialog: (pointing to the sky)
dialog: Moon. You must be the Sioux.
text: He is pointing his long, skinny finger at Cooch.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: No. That's Ray here. Ray...
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
text: Clear Moon beholds the young agent with hopeful eyes, a smile
text: breaking across his flaccid brown skin. He takes Ray's hand
text: in a respectful double-clutch and grips him tightly... almost
dialog: desperately.
speaker_heading: CLEAR MOON
dialog: It's about time they sent us one of
dialog: our own. Was-te.
text: He keeps pumping Ray's hand, looking into his face with great
text: admiration. Cooch looks on with amusement.
speaker_heading: CLEAR MOON
dialog: Things are no good here. It is like
dialog: war zone. We need an official who
dialog: understands what is good for the
dialog: Indian people. Who knows Indian way.
text: Clear Moon has not released Ray's arm as he leads them to a
text: string of seedy motel units across the street.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I thought we were staying on the
dialog: reservation.
speaker_heading: CLEAR MOON
dialog: Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are
dialog: on Indian land.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: CLEAR MOON
dialog: Are you hungry? I have some nice raw
text: kidney in the truck.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: He's starving, Mr. Clear Moon. Get
dialog: him some raw kidney. He hasn't had
dialog: any Indian food in days...
text: And Clear Moon guides them through the front door of room
text: 13. Ray looks over his shoulder threateningly at Cooch who
text: winks and pats his back.
scene_heading: EXT. RESERVATION LINE - NIGHT
text: A lone headlight appears out of the black. HEARTBEAT DRUM.
text: But faster. Relentless. A "res" car, a dented, rusted, peeling
text: old station wagon, drives slowly toward the reservation.
text: Then suddenly, someone steps in front of the car. A BIG MAN
text: in cowboy boots and blue jeans.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL - ROOM 13 - NIGHT
text: Ray lies in bed. Awake. He is hanging off the bed with a
text: file open on the floor and using the moon to light photos
text: and memorandums. And then he hears LAUGHTER outside. And
text: GLASS BREAK.
text: He gets out of bed quickly, snatching up his pants, putting
text: their on, and going to the window.
scene_heading: POV - OUT WINDOW:
text: SEVERAL LOCALS out in front of the bar help a middle-aged
text: INDIAN MAN out of the station wagon.
speaker_heading: WHITE LOCAL
dialog: Where you goin'? Back to the res?
text: A young local bends down behind the Indian while another
text: shoves him, sending him tripping over the bent man and onto
text: his back in the dirt.
speaker_heading: WHITE LOCAL
dialog: What ya doin'? You drunk?
text: MORE LOCALS come out from the bar, beers and drinks and
text: interested in what's going on.
speaker_heading: REVERSE - RAY
text: at the window, observes. Cooch enters from the connecting
text: room, puffy-eyed but quickly buttoning his shirt. He shares
text: Ray's view.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Let's take a walk.
text: Ray is transfixed.
scene_heading: EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE BAR - NIGHT
text: The Indian man, is pushed into a stumble, and caught by
text: another white man as a little game of catch takes place.
text: Cooch, stepping into the circle, shirt half unbuttoned, hair
text: a mess, looks on. Then steps in front of a big local and
text: catches the Indian as he comes stumbling. He holds onto him,
text: looking at the faces that turn his way. Ray steps up beside
text: him, looking tense.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: What's goin' on here?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I can't walk across the goddamn street
dialog: without some breed-ass fallin' all
dialog: over me?
text: And then Cooch shoves the Indian with all his might back
text: across the road. The locals resume their fun, and Cooch looks
text: at a local man and shares a chattering laugh that makes Ray
dialog: do a serious take.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Watch out now, he wants a kiss, Ray,
dialog: wants a kiss --
text: The Indian ends up stumbling back toward Ray, and Ray catches
text: him this time. The man maintains a perfect vacant expression
text: and keeps acting as though nothing of the sort is happening.
text: But he is dizzy, and exhausted, and Ray keeps him from
dialog: falling.
text: Cooch looks at Ray. Their eyes meet. Ray shoves the man
text: forward. This time, instead of catching him, the local on
text: the receiving end, hauls off and punches him in the face.
text: The Indian drops.
text: Cooch runs in, grabs the Indian under the arms and drags him
text: back to his car.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Go ahead, skin, get your ass back on
dialog: your sacred land. Get outta here.
text: He shoves him behind the wheel as the locals crowd around.
text: They don't see Cooch throw the wheel stick in drive, and
text: lean into the man's ear.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Get outta here. Drive.
text: Cooch slams the door, and kicks it, and the vehicle lurches
text: forward. A beer can clanks off the rear window, and rolls
text: clanking into the middle of the road.
text: Ray stands there with the locals as they all watch the car
text: drive off across the reservation line. Cooch, belly sticking
text: out of his unbuttoned shirt, and a breathless smile on his
text: face, heads to the bar without breaking stride. This man has
dialog: done "underground" before.
scene_heading: INT. BUFFALO BUTTE BAR - NIGHT - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Cooch and Ray sit in a booth with DENNIS VAUGHN, a strapping
text: local man, ranch-raised, and gentlemanly. In fact, downright
dialog: likeable.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: So what type of salesmen are you
dialog: gentlemen anyway?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Liquor. We heard they like their
dialog: drink on the reservation, and we
dialog: were gonna see if we couldn't unload
text: some surplus on the way to Nebraska.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Now keep that between us, Dennis,
dialog: cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny
dialog: Law they got here.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want
dialog: you to meet a coupla fellas from
dialog: Denver.
text: BROOKS, a small, older man with a feed store cap and a clean
text: cowboy shirt, comes over with a beer and a pensive look on
text: his face. He pulls up a chair and positions himself at the
text: end of the booth.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Liquor salesmen. Be nice to them,
dialog: maybe they'll give you a sample of
dialog: some of that gin you like.
dialog: (to Ray)
dialog: He likes that Russian shit that --
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: They ain't liquor salesmen. They're
dialog: FBI.
text: Cooch and Ray don't flinch. Dennis does. He looks between
text: the two, cautiously.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow
dialog: like you, doing in a joint like this?
dialog: Let me buy you a glass of some of
dialog: that Russian shit you like.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: FBI? What you investigatin'?
speaker_heading: COOCH
text: A murder. On the reservation.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Again. Figures, man.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: You'll never find out who did it.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: You underestimate me, Brooks.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: No. You underestimate these grass
text: niggers. They're killing each other.
dialog: That's all they do. Get drunk and
dialog: kill each other. Then cover for each
dialog: other. Who gives a damn really as
dialog: long as they stay on their
dialog: reservation. You ask me, the
dialog: government shouldn't care one
dialog: particle.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: You know how in your big cities, you
dialog: got your niggers and you got your
dialog: Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got
dialog: Indians. That's just the way it is.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: The only good Indian is a dead Indian,
dialog: does that old adage still hold true
dialog: out here?
text: Cooch laughs good-naturedly. Ray smiles. But Brooks looks
dialog: offended.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: That set-to you saw out front, was
dialog: nothin' more than a message we were
dialog: sendin' to the sonsabitches that are
dialog: divertin' water from the river.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: We got rights. We got a ranch just
dialog: up here.
text: Ray catches this. Glances a look off Cooch who works on a
text: cold draught beer.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Did any of you gentlemen know Leo
dialog: Fast Elk?
text: Both men shake their heads. Get quiet.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: You fellas are here to investigate a
dialog: Indian crime, you should keep to
dialog: Indian land, and talk to them, not
dialog: us. But you wanna drink here and
dialog: shoot stick here, that's your right,
dialog: and we respect that.
dialog: (to Dennis)
dialog: Come on, Son, we're up on the table.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: You fellas wanna play doubles?
text: Cooch shakes his head, distracted, and the two locals leave,
text: enroute for the pool table. Ray watches them go, curious.
scene_heading: EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE BAR - NIGHT
text: Ray and Cooch, cross the street back to the motel. It is
text: black and chillingly still.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Water. Worth killing for out here,
dialog: I'd think.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Get the plate numbers off everyone
dialog: of these cars.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I already did.
text: Cooch looks at Ray, impressed.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Couldn't sleep.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Good.
text: They stop in front of their rooms and Cooch pulls a small
text: tape recorder from his waistband. A micro-cassette recorder
text: that he examines in the dim door light.
speaker_heading: RECORDER
dialog: (locals)
dialog: -- out here we got our Indians. And
dialog: that's the way it is.
text: Cooch shuts it off.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: By the time you get to the main
dialog: village, sun'll be up. I want you to
dialog: fraternize. Socialize. Penetrate.
dialog: Infiltrate. Eat some raw kidney, and
dialog: get these Indians talking. I'm gonna
dialog: Powwow with Big Chief Clear Moon and
dialog: find out more about Leo.
text: He hands Ray the recorder.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Done.
text: Cooch starts for his room but in a long, exaggerated country
text: step as he breaks into the HANK WILLIAMS tune that has all
text: but driven him insane inside the joint. Ray watches him go,
text: and cracks a laugh.
scene_heading: INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING - SUNRISE
text: Ray's at the wheel, looks intense as he studies the vast
text: expanse of slopes and rock formations and the rising sphere
text: of flame that lights the road in strange color. He is reading
text: a name list that he traps against the wheel.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Hobert Standing-Buffalo-That-Walks-
dialog: Dreamer.
dialog: (a dry run)
dialog: Hello, I'm looking for Hobert Standing-
dialog: Buffalo-That-Walks... Dreamer.
text: Ray pulls up a long dirt drive and parks.
scene_heading: EXT. OLD TRAILER - ACROSS FROM BADLANDS  SUNRISE
text: Ray walks to the front door of a war-torn trailer that is
text: halfway swallowed by weeds and plants. It is static out here.
text: Dead still. Ray approaches the front door. There is a huge
text: hole in it. He knocks above the hole.
text: After a moment, the door opens a crack. A dark, weather-beaten
text: face barely shows.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Good morning. I'm looking for Hobert-
dialog: Buffalo-Dreaming...
dialog: (cheat sheet)
dialog: Hobert Standing-Buffalo-That-Walks--
text: The door closes. Locks.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: --Dreamer.
text: Ray stands there for a moment then lowers himself to look
text: through the huge hole in the door.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Sir?
text: A tattered chair is pushed against the door, covering the
text: hole. Ray stands up, turns on the steps. And before he can
text: let out a flustered sigh, he spots something across the dirt
text: road. Something that makes him remove his shades, look again.
text: Whatever it is, it doesn't make him happy, and he is hurrying
text: across the road.
scene_heading: EXT. BADLANDS - DAY
text: A motorcycle, parked between the road and the badlands. We've
text: seen the ancient bike before. Ray walks past it, looking at
dialog: it.
text: He pushes his shades up on the bridge of his nose and looks
text: down into the moonscape.
text: Walter Crow Horse is down there, on his haunches, "feel
text: tracking", laying his fingers inside tracks and reading them.
text: He doesn't even look up at the sound of the FBI agent's
text: footsteps.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Ray Little Weasel. FBI. I like the
dialog: way ya sneaked up on me. Must be
dialog: Indian.
text: The wind whistles and moans through the Badlands as Crow
text: Horse continues feel tracking.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What are you --
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Watch out!
text: Ray draws back.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: You're steppin' on sign.
text: Crow Horse lowers his face to the ground and blows some
text: scattered dust out of a print. Lightly lays his fingers inside
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Hey.
dialog: (ignored)
dialog: Hey, you, listen up --
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: -- Leo wasn't killed here. He was
text: dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald
text: tread. Muffler held on with baling
dialog: wire.
text: Crow Horse checks out another track.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: The man you want... stepped outta
text: the car, dragged Leo out, laid him
dialog: down. Then walked over here and made
text: a circle in the earth with a stick.
dialog: I can't find the stick. He stuck an
text: eagle plume in the circle, got back
text: in his car, dustin' his own prints
text: with a pine bough for about six feet,
dialog: but he missed a print, right here,
dialog: see. He got in his car and went Hell-
dialog: bent-for-Holy-Sunday outta here. He
dialog: ditched that pine bough three miles
text: across the flat, in the Little Bear
text: River, it floated down to
text: Thundershield Gap. The car hit paved
dialog: road, and was outta here.
text: Crow Horse rises, points down the road.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: The killin' was done where Leo's
dialog: mother lives. But he was driven here
dialog: into these Badlands.
text: Ray is frowning at the big Indian, trying to get a fix on
dialog: this
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth
dialog: of that print, pressure releases...
dialog: I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: -- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You're trying to tell me you can
dialog: read all that from a track?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: No. Not just a track. You gotta listen
dialog: to the trees, man. To the leaves. To
dialog: this sand, you FBI's kicked all up.
dialog: You gotta listen to the earth.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Is that right? Well, listen to this:
dialog: drag your ass. This is a restricted
dialog: area.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: No, this is the home of the Oglala
dialog: Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who
dialog: killed Leo. Whether you get him or I
dialog: get him, I just want him. Shit's
dialog: been goin' on too long.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You've got no jurisdiction.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: You got no know-how. About Indian
dialog: Way. Or about Jack Shit for that
dialog: matter.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow
dialog: Horse, but I just flew in from a
dialog: place called the Twentieth Century
dialog: where we have such things as
dialog: electrostatic tracking methods,
dialog: psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting;
dialog: I don't have to crawl around with
dialog: the scorpions and talk to the fucking
dialog: trees to get answers. Leo was killed
dialog: right here.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Go back to the M.E., take a look
dialog: inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me
dialog: how chicken feed got in there. Trust
dialog: me, there ain't chickens in the
dialog: Badlands. His mother's place is --
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: -- his mother never lived here. She
dialog: was from up in North Dakota.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: I'm talkin' his spiritual mother.
dialog: Maisy Blue Legs.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: His spiritual mother...
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: To us Indians, our spiritual relatives
dialog: are as close as family. I've got
dialog: seven mothers on this reservation.
dialog: Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole.
dialog: I'm giving you a break. But if my
dialog: partner finds out you're here, you're
dialog: gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux
dialog: Falls Maximum Security.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Easy. Easy... I'm goin'.
text: Crow Horse walks back up toward the road.
text: Ray lets him leave then crouches where Crow Horse was, begins
text: looking at tracks.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, Little Weasel.
text: Ray turns, and sees Crow Horse perched on a high bank -- the
text: one Ray came down -- and he's in a tracking stance.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: You weigh one sixty-three, yeah? Not
dialog: a beer drinker. You're one of these
dialog: tofu and pilaf characters. Pack your
dialog: gun, under your coat -- left shoulder.
dialog: But you got backup; a little .32,
text: .38 maybe, in a ankle holster that
dialog: gives you a right foot drag, Shoes
dialog: are too tight at the toe but, man,
dialog: they look cool. And that's what
dialog: counts.
text: Ray just stands frozen, blown away. Crow Horse rises, dusting
text: off his hands, and heading to his vehicle.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Crow Horse.
text: The Indian turns. The wind moans. Ray scrutinizes him,
text: deliberating.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Fuck you.
text: Crow Horse grins and waves, and ambles away. DOWN IN
speaker_heading: THE BADLANDS
text: Ray stands, sweating under his suit jacket, and not sure if
text: he's amazed or pissed off.
scene_heading: EXT MAISY BLUE LEGS HOUSE  BLACK TAIL DISTRICT - DAY
text: A trailer sits off from the river in beaten solitude. There
text: are two junked cars and one burned black.
text: Wind blows across deep bald tire tracks. Ray walks slowly
text: beside them, surveying, following them to a place where they
text: become puckers and skids next to a dilapidated outhouse.
text: There is a shotgun blast in the side of it. Ray studies it,
text: enters the outhouse. Exits, and walks the rutted gumbo earth
text: to where it meets rolling hills of golden grass. He stands
text: here, mesmerized.
text: CHICKENS scratch around in the dirt.
text: Like so many far-off res homesteads, this is a haunting place.
text: Made more so by a persistent SQUEAKING, a rusty, metallic
dialog: squeal coming from --
speaker_heading: A WATER PUMP
text: across the yard, where MAISY BLUE LEGS, a Sioux elder, works
text: the handle. She wears thick bifocals and keeps her hair under
text: a bandanna. No water comes forth from the pump, and she tries
text: again and again until she breaks a sweat. And then she sees
dialog: the waal'cu standing out there.
text: Urgently, she turns and starts back to her trailer with an
text: empty coffee can.
text: Ray starts after her.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Mrs... Blue Legs? Can I ask you a
dialog: few questions --
speaker_heading: MAISY
dialog: (1/3 res speed)
dialog: -- go away. Leave us alone...
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Ma'am, Please --
text: She mounts the metal steps. Ray is losing her. He gets a
text: foot on the bottom step, and attempts something he does not
dialog: want to do.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Mrs. Blue Legs. I'm Indian.
text: Halfway through the screendoor, Maisy turns and looks at the
text: young man in suit and shades.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'm Sioux.
text: Maisy lowers her bifocals, studies him. Then walks in, slaps
text: the door shut, and locks it. A towel hung as a shade folds
dialog: down.
text: Ray lingers at the bottom of the steps.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah, right.
text: And he walks around the side of the trailer, looking at the
text: ground. In the gaping space between the trailer blocks, and
text: the grass, there is much junk stored, and Ray kneels to look.
text: He is drawn to a pair of cowboy boots, caked with dried mud.
text: He picks up a boot, looks at the sole, then touches the mud.
text: His fingers break through the hardened crust and come back
text: moist and blue. He looks at this sniffs it. There is a tense,
text: water-torture like tempo coming from the old pump where water
text: barely drips onto a hub cap in the dirt. Ray sets the boot
text: down. Goes to grab the other boot and --
text: a WESTERN DIAMOND BACK RATTLER coils out from the shade of
text: the boot, RATTLING and HISSING from white mouth and three-
text: inch fangs, and Ray has done a backflip and roll, slapping
text: his shoulder holster and pulling lead and BLAM! BLAAAM! he
text: unloads two, and the reptile is so dead, there's not even
text: enough snake left to make a truck-stop key chain.
text: He kneels there, flushed in the face, holding his breath and
text: double-clutching his gun. The SHOTS ECHO through the Badlands
text: like the aftermath of dynamite. From inside the trailer, he
text: can hear CRYING. A low moaning. Praying softly.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Shit. Mrs. Blue Legs! It's okay!
text: Then his RADIO CRACKS IN.
speaker_heading: RADIO (COOCH)
dialog: X21, give me a 20.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Black Tail District, X22. You ready
dialog: for this? Leo wasn't killed in the

speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Maisy Blue Legs place?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: How'd you know?
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: I got one up on ya.
speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: I've got the doer. I know who he is.
text: Ray looks relieved.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Meet me at base. Over.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Cooch. You're my hero.
text: Ray looks down at the dead snake, still rushed from it, and

dialog: reflex.
scene_heading: EXT. LOOKS TWICE HOUSE - BEAR CREEK RES - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON an AMERICAN FLAG, flapping in the hot night wind.
text: But something is wrong about the image. The flag is hung
dialog: upside lit by --
text: A full moon that also illuminates an overgrown field that
text: fronts a small, one-level house where the flag hangs. Three
text: old cars decorate the front yard. A busted screendoor creaks
text: in the wind, and somewhere off in the hills, a DOG BARKS

speaker_heading: COOCH (O.S.)
dialog: Jimmy Looks Twice.
scene_heading: INT. LE BARON
text: SA Couture and SA Levoi sit inside the car, staking out this

text: Cooch has the suspect's file on his knee.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Who is he?
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: One of the leaders of the Warriors
dialog: of All Red Nations. Militant
dialog: organization.
text: He hands an open file over to Ray.
text: CLOSE ON - FILE PHOTO: a raging fire and six long-haired,
text: fist-raising Indians, yelling at the camera.
speaker_heading: COOCH (O.S.)
dialog: The progressive Indians don't like
dialog: them because they want everybody to
dialog: go back to the old Indian ways, and
dialog: the old way Indians don't like them
dialog: because they use violence to get
dialog: attention.
text: RAY SHUFFLES TO
text: PHOTO 2 -- a big Indian in a wheel chair, holding a rifle.
text: He is shirtless under a vest and on his muscular right
text: shoulder there is a clearly defined tattoo of a circle with
text: an eagle feather through it.
text: PHOTO 3 -- a Close Up of the tattoo.
text: PHOTO 4 -- a propaganda flyer with the letters W.A.R.N. and
text: the same symbol -- perfect circle, pierced by a white eagle
dialog: feather.
speaker_heading: RAY
text: White eagle feather through the
dialog: circle. That's their symbol.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: That's right.
text: Ray shuffles through more of the same with great interest.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: They obviously wanted it to be known
dialog: that they offed Leo. Some kind of
dialog: statement.
speaker_heading: COOCH
text: Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head
text: through a glass door of the tribal
dialog: offices three months ago. And
dialog: threatened him several times since.
dialog: President Clear Moon and the regional
dialog: FBI feel he made good on that threat.
text: Cooch takes a long, tight breath then turns around in his
text: seat, coming up with an M-16. Ray lifts one of his own. He
text: looks out the car window.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'd just like five minutes alone
dialog: with the motherfucker who hung that
text: flag upside down.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my
dialog: ship. Now: remember what I told you
dialog: about Nam? Watch the grass, watch
dialog: the trees, watch the shit house, be
dialog: on your toes, and if we get committed,
dialog: don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Alright. Alright.
text: Cooch whacks a top clip into the M-16. Ray slams a clip in
dialog: his.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: It's show time.
text: Car doors open in skillful silence.
scene_heading: LOOKS TWICE HOUSE - CLOSER - NIGHT
text: and Ray maneuver toward the house, rifles ready. Cooch gets
text: under the picture window, sneaks a look. Nothing. He follows
text: Ray around the side.
speaker_heading: POV:
text: off in a backfield, lit by a hot fire, a small round hut
text: covered in patchwork quilts, canvas and buffalo hide. A
text: strange mist floats around it, and from inside, voices are
text: heard -- A DRUMMING AND CHANTING in LAKOTA. And EAGLE SOUNDS.
text: Dozens of shrill whistles. Are there birds inside this thing?
speaker_heading: REVERSE - RAY
text: and Cooch, kneeling in the weeds, look dumbfounded. And more
text: than a little unnerved.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: What the hell is that?
scene_heading: NEAR THE INIPI LODGE
text: An INDIAN YOUTH DOOR TENDER with shoulder length hair falling
text: over a T-shirt, steps out of the dark and walks to the fire.
text: He prods it with a broken pitch fork.
text: He turns to get some more wood and walks right into an M-16,
text: trained chest level. Ray stares him down.
speaker_heading: RAY
text: On the ground.
text: The boy drops boot camp fast.
text: Cooch moves up on the sweat lodge, looking quizzically at
text: it, trying to figure out how to open it. He grabs a canvas
text: flap at the front and after a moment's hesitation and a look
text: at Ray, he tears the flap away.
text: A BLAST OF 200 DEGREE STEAM explodes forth and Cooch dances
text: back, throwing up his rifle.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: (inside lodge)
dialog: Mitakue Oyasin!
text: GRANDPA SAMUEL REACHES, a rail-thin Sioux elder, appears
text: through the steam like a vision. Bent in the tiny doorway,
text: he searches out the interruption.
text: Cooch aims the M-16 at the old man.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: This is the FBI! Come on out of there
dialog: nice and slow. Let's move it! Hands
dialog: on your head!
text: Grandpa Reaches crawls out first, ignoring the "Hands on
text: your head" order from Cooch. His eyes move back and forth
text: between the two agents.
text: FIVE MORE INDIANS, from 16-45 come out, looking confused.
text: Cooch makes the towel-wrapped men spread out in a line. The
text: old man is speaking to the others in LAKOTA, and Ray steps
text: up to him, cuts him off.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Hands on your head, Sir. Come on,
dialog: come on...
text: The archaic figure just looks through him. Starts to walk
text: away. Ray takes his thin arm. He locks eyes with the old
text: man. Slowly, he obeys, raising his hands and laying them on
text: his head.
text: From the lodge, the last man emerges. It's Crazy Horse reborn
text: out of the burning sage. JIMMY LOOKS TWICE is in his mid-
text: thirties -- big, well over two-hundred pounds. But lean. His
text: braids fall nearly to his hips. His face is handsome but at
text: the moment, twisted in a full-blood's scowl.
speaker_heading: LOOKS TWICE
dialog: (outraged)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: James Looks Twice?
speaker_heading: LOOKS TWICE
dialog: That's right. What are you doing
dialog: here? This is a religious ceremony
dialog: you're desecrating.
text: Looks Twice shoots hawk-like black eyes onto Ray.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: We're FBI, James. We just need to
dialog: ask you a few questions.
speaker_heading: LOOKS TWICE
text: We are in the middle of a sweat lodge
dialog: ceremony. Do you drag people out of
dialog: your churches when they're in the
dialog: middle of prayer?
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Let's take a walk, Jimmy. Come on.
text: Cooch takes a careful step behind Jimmy and cuffs him. Looks
text: Twice speaks to the others in LAKOTA, and they disband,
text: heading to a shade arbor where their clothes hang.
text: As Cooch starts marching Looks Twice toward the house, Ray
text: keeps an eye on the departing. One of them stops halfway to
text: the fence and turns. Grandpa Reaches looks at Ray with eyes
dialog: that have seen one hundred and one hard years in Indian
dialog: Country.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Go ahead. You can all go home.
text: And he follows Cooch and the cuffed Jimmy to the house.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: We just wanna take a look around
dialog: your place, Jimmy. We're not here to
dialog: bust your balls.
text: AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE
text: Cooch leads the half-naked suspect to the backdoor. Cooch
text: show: a warrant, tries the door but it is locked.
speaker_heading: LOOKS TWICE
dialog: What's this about?
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
speaker_heading: LOOKS TWICE
dialog: You think I killed him? Cuz he was
dialog: an apple? Well, let me tell you
dialog: something about Leo, Man --
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: -- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's
dialog: the key?
text: Jimmy doesn't answer. He glares with hatred into Cooch's
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Ray, use the federal master key.
text: Ray steps up, gets ready to throw a frontkick at the door.
speaker_heading: LOOKS TWICE
dialog: No. Don't do that. Don't deface the
dialog: property, man. The key's in there.
text: With his hands cuffed, he can only jerk his head toward a
text: big hole in the wall down near the foundation. Cooch quickly
text: drops to a knee and checks out the hole.
speaker_heading: LOOKS TWICE
text: Inside... in the coffee can.
text: Cooch reaches in, probes.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: There's no coffee can in --
text: Something horrifying happens so fast, Cooch has no time to
dialog: react.
text: Whatever has taken his arm has done so with such force, his
text: body jolts like he's touched raw voltage. The South Dakota
text: BADGER rips through his leather jacket -- we get a glimpse
text: of its striped face and yellowed teeth -- through his shirt.
text: Through flesh, and deeper, GROWLING insanely while COOCH
text: HOLLERS in shock tries to pull free and --
text: Jimmy Looks Twice spins from the porch with a skillfully
text: executed back kick, knocking Ray off the step and to the
text: ground. The Indian bolts like a deer into the darkness.
text: Ray rolls in the grass, throwing his M-16 up. He hesitates.
text: But only for a moment before FIRING and decimating the corner
text: gutter, a junked car, several trees. But no sign of Jimmy.
text: Cooch falls back in the grass badly mauled. His arm has been
text: ripped open down to the bone.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Jesus... Jesus...
text: Ray starts toward Cooch.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Get him...
text: Ray takes off, crashing through weeds, into a stream, wading
text: through mud. He throws his flashlight left and right. He
text: crosses the river, shines the light in a field of wild sage.
text: Nothing. He runs like a sprinter, looking everywhere. But as
dialog: he enters an --
speaker_heading: OPEN FIELD
text: all he finds is Jimmy's towel. He picks it up and looks around
text: the area, breathing heavily.
text: And then suddenly, something leaps up out of the grass. Ray
text: swings his M-16 up, ready to blast. But it is a DEER, taking
text: off into a mystical blue night. THE DRUM. Beating fast. Heavy.
scene_heading: TURTLESHELL RATTLE. EAGLE BONE WHISTLES.
speaker_heading: IN THE YARD
text: Cooch traps his bleeding arm between his knees to stanch the
text: blood. He speaks quietly but firm into his radio, trying to
dialog: stay in control.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: Assault on federal officers. Suspect
text: has left the area. One officer down.
text: Issue a Fugitive Alert immediately.
dialog: Over.

dialog: throughout --
scene_heading: AN FBI SATURATION SEARCH
text: FOUR AGENTS surround a little tar-paper shack, rifles up and

text: and some TEN CHILDREN. DOGS.
text: A SMALL TRAILER that has thirty junked cars in its yard and
text: serves as a reservation parts store is crawling with FEDERAL

text: run through the cars. WARPATH DRUMS...
text: -- A BELL UH 1-B "HUEY" HELICOPTER chutters low over the
text: grasslands, over the Badlands, flattening wheat. It swings
text: down over the main settlement. CHILDREN gather in the street
dialog: to look up at it but then run when --
text: -- SIX FEDERAL CARS come down the main road. They pass by --
text: -- THE FRONT PORCH OF THE TRADING POST where Ray stands,
text: talking to the elders. A few of the same from earlier but
dialog: several new ones.
text: He is sweat-drenched, and has shed his jacket and tie. He is
text: showing them photos of Jimmy but getting no response. And
text: then, for a little iodine on top of that, a MOTORCYCLE ENGINE,
text: spitting and choking and coughing comes around the corner,
text: Walter Crow Horse, manning the handlebars.
text: He pulls up to Ray and just looks at him. DRUMS FADE.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: You're an easy man to track, Ray. Ya
text: walk like a penguin with a hard-on.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Is that right? What are the trees
dialog: saying today?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: They're sayin' that nobody's gonna
dialog: talk to you cuz they don't give away
dialog: one of their own. But they did say
dialog: there's somebody way across the Little
text: Walking River who wants to talk to
dialog: you.
text: Ray soaks sweat off his forehead as he eyes the Indian on
text: this one. He sees himself in the polaroid shades.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: He sent me to find ya. He says he's
dialog: got information.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Let's go.
text: Ray quickly leaves the porch.
scene_heading: EXT. GRANDPA SAM REACHES TRAILER - OUTSIDE SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: Silent. The unnerving silence of the Great Plains filled
text: only by FLYS, big horseflies, buzzing around drying sage
text: that hangs from the rafters of a shade arbor. A GOAT stands
text: under it, just gazing across --
text: the vast spread of grass and dry land where an ancient
text: Airstream trailer sits lop-sided. Sheets are hung as curtains.
text: Six old cars -- two from the early 50'a -- sit stripped to
text: the hubs on blocks in the overgrown grass. The air is dry
dialog: and heavy and the only sound is --
text: FLYS. Ray swats at them as he steps over a truck seat that
text: lies in the grass, stuffing and springs hanging out. Crow
text: Horse walk. a few steps ahead, toward the trailer.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: (with reverence)
dialog: Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty
dialog: medicine.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Medicine. As in medicine man?
text: Crow Horse nods slowly, looking at Ray in a very serious
dialog: manner
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Why does he wanna see me?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Good question. Hardly sees anybody
dialog: anymore. Hasn't left this place in
dialog: twenty years. Did you bring some
dialog: tobacco?
text: Crow Horse stops walking, making Ray do the same.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: When you go see an elder, you always
dialog: bring some tobacco as a gift.
text: Ray reaches into his shirt pocket and fishes out a pack of
text: Marlboro. Crow Horse glances at it, and shrug-nods. They
text: continue on toward the trailer.
scene_heading: INT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER
text: Grandpa Samuel Reaches sits in a taped and tuckered easy
text: chair, his alert black eyes moving from side to side. We
text: recognize him from the sweat lodge ceremony at Looks Twice'
text: although today he wears a straw cowboy hat giving him a more
text: youthful look despite a face like a map of the Badlands.
text: He wears a vest over a western shirt, baggy work slacks, old
text: cowboy boots.
text: His brown wrinkled hands run over the top of the Marlboro
text: pack as if he's reading braille.
text: Crow Horse sits across from him on a stool. Ray leans on one
text: of the plain green walls, looking uncomfortable. A three
text: foot adhesive fly strip hangs from the ceiling, thick with
text: dead ones. There is a black and white TV with Sesame Street
text: wailing, honking and guffawing through static.
text: Grandpa fixes his eyes on Ray for only split seconds at a
text: time but one gets the feeling he's doing an incredibly deep
text: reading of the young man. Slowly, he sits up -- focusing
text: intensely on Ray.
text: He begins to speak. A hoarse, strained, string of LAKOTA,
text: spoken like it used to be, gesturing toward Ray. When he
text: finishes, he sits back in his chair. Ray looks intrigued.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: He wants to know if you ever watch
text: the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie
dialog: Monster is not to be trusted -- a
dialog: trickster.
text: Ray looks puzzled. Crow Horse laughs bull-wild as Grandpa
text: takes up a fly swatter and takes out a big horsefly. The old
text: man begins speaking Indian again.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: He says there's something wrong with
dialog: Big Bird -- he's crazy,
dialog: (stops laughing)
dialog: He says you stopped the Inipi ceremony
dialog: last night...?
text: Crow Horse turns a questioning look at Ray. Ray doesn't
dialog: flinch.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: But he is not unhappy with you because
dialog: he knows you.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: He knows me?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: He says he saw you in a vision some
dialog: time ago.
text: Crow Horse stops translating suddenly even though the old
text: man continues speaking. Crow Horse looks concerned, and ASKS
text: A QUESTION IN LAKOTA. We don't know what he's asking but the
text: tone is absolute amazement.
text: This question triggers an exchange between he and Grandpa,
text: the old one getting angry. Grandpa wins.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: I guess he had this vision some time
dialog: ago, in the Moon of the Popping Trees --
dialog: uh, back in the winter. He says you
dialog: come from Wasi'cu city in the East
dialog: but that your people... way back...
dialog: are of the Minniconjou Sioux. But
dialog: you yourself don't know that.
text: Ray's brow is drawn tense as he stares at the old Indian,
text: absorbing the translation. Grandpa speaks more fervently
text: now, incorporating Indian sign. Each time Grandpa does the
text: hard Sioux HAND SLAP, Ray blinks.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: He says he knew you'd be coming to
dialog: Bear Creek. He was told. It is the
dialog: will of Tunkasilia -- the grandfather
dialog: that you come here. He says let's
dialog: smoke the caanunpa the sacred pipe,
dialog: symbol of truth. So that there will
dialog: be no lies between us.
text: The old man has taken a long wooden stem and a red stone
text: bowl from a beaded pipe bag. He joins the two together then
text: begins offering a pinch of tobacco to the Four Directions.
text: While this goes on, Ray fidgets.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What's he smoke in that?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry,
dialog: we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture
dialog: in The Pipe. That's a white man's
dialog: myth. This is a sacrament.
text: The old man is offering the pipe to Ray.
speaker_heading: GRANDPA
dialog: Mltaku Oyasin.
text: Ray looks at Grandpa. The old man offers the pipe again.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: You don't smoke with him, it means
dialog: you're hiding something.
text: Ray takes the pipe, looks at it... then passes it to Crow
text: Horse. The big Indian takes it from Ray, giving him a long
text: eye, then offering the pipe to The Directions before smoking.
text: Crow Horse puffs hard, eyes closed, then slowly releases
text: some smoke upward. Ray watches it climb and fade. The old
text: man then takes up an old turtle shell rattle. He speaks.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: He says Wakan. Sacred. Five hundred
text: year old turtleshell rattle, passed
dialog: down from the Grandfathers. Heavy
dialog: duty.
text: He shakes the rattle very slightly, moving it in front of
text: Ray. He speaks just above a whisper.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: He says, it is good. The Spirits are
dialog: here. The Spirits want to know what
dialog: you're doing here?
text: Ray smirks.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Tell him I'm trying to find the man
dialog: who murdered Leo Fast Elk. Ask him
dialog: if he knows where he is.
text: Crow Horse asks the old man in Lakota. No answer. The pipe
text: is back to grandpa, and he offers it to the Directions, to
text: the Earth then upward before smoking himself. He begins to
dialog: speak again.
text: Passionately. In long glottal Sioux sentences, adding sign,
text: fingers crossing, brushing an arm, a slap here and there,
text: He is working himself into an excited state, and Ray keeps
text: looking at Crow Horse, very interested in the old man's
dialog: answer.
text: Finally Grandpa's breath comes up short and wheezing, he
text: ends his oratory with a solid hand slap.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: He said he doesn't know.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: He just did the Gettysburg Address
dialog: in Sioux. What did he say?
text: Crow Horse ignores him. Grandpa speaks again. More hand
dialog: language.
text: The old man is staring at Ray while whispering to Crow Horse.
text: He strokes his badger claw necklace.
text: Crow Horse looks at Ray and seems hesitant to translate this
dialog: new piece of information.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Uh... Grandpa likes to trade; no one
dialog: stops by here without gettin' stuck
dialog: in the old Indian barter. He, uh...
dialog: he likes your shades.
text: Grandpa smiles toothlessly. Ray who has his driving glasses
text: in hand, lifts them to say "these?" but Grandpa sees it as
text: an accepted deal, and swiftly removes his necklace. He holds
dialog: it out.
text: Ray slowly, hesitantly surrenders his sunglasses, and takes
text: the necklace. Crow Horse bursts into laughter and so does
text: Grandpa, enjoying a good trade. He draws a hand through the
text: air in a sort of horizontal karate chop, meaning done deal.
text: Ray looks confused. Out of his element. And out of his shades.
text: Another fly gets snagged on sticky tape.
scene_heading: EXT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER
text: Crow Horse is hurrying toward his bike, Ray with him.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What was he saying?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Why should I tell you.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Because he was talking to me.
text: Crow Horse keeps walking.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Does he know something?
text: Crow Horse stops walking and eyes Ray, deliberating.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
text: The old man saw an owl. Over there
dialog: in the dry wash. Last week.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: And...
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
text: He saw an owl.
text: A silent moment. Ray tries to figure out what he's missing
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: So what?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
text: The owl is a messenger. When one
dialog: shows itself to a Sioux... it means
dialog: someone's gonna die. The owl told
dialog: him about Leo.
text: Ray stares vacantly.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: The owl told him about Leo. That's
dialog: incredible. I guess we just broke
dialog: the back of this investigation, didn't
dialog: we? Evidence doesn't get any harder
dialog: than that -- not for my money. Is
dialog: there anyway we can seduce this owl
dialog: into Federal Court?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: He also said "listen to the water."
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Listen to the water. Listen to the
dialog: owl. He also said, don't trust the
dialog: fucking Cookie Monster.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
text: Crow Horse KICK STARTS his bike and burns off down the drive
text: Ray feels the presence of the old man, standing behind the

text: OVER THIS, A SCREAMING. A HIGH-PITCHED, CHILLING, SCREAM
dialog: that takes us straight into --
scene_heading: SLACK TAIL POWWOW GROUNDS - RES - LATER

speaker_heading: A WACIPI
text: is going down. A Powow. Held in the center of a huge arbor.
text: This DANCER, a traditional Kit Fox dancer, is dressed in
text: authentic costume and is dancing with TEN OTHERS dressed in
text: various traditional garb and paints.
text: Under the arbor, TWO HUNDRED INDIANS in modern clothing sit
text: on blankets or in lawn chairs, watching the dancing. A group

text: SIXTY CARS (res beaters) are parked off around the arbor,
text: less interested kids sitting on them, smoking cigarettes. A

text: Drifting through the cars and people are Special Agents
text: Couture, Miles, Sherman and Levoi. They stroll through,

text: Ray slows his step and takes in --
scene_heading: THE POWWOW CIRCLE

text: An OLD-INDIAN MAN sitting in a lawn chair, removes his cowboy

text: and shuffles out to the center pole along with --
text: FOUR OTHER VETERANS who have exchanged cowboy hats for
text: veteran's caps. There is even a traditional dancer in there,
text: wearing a veteran cap. As a mournful WAR SONG is banged out
text: by the singers, a flag is unrolled by the veterans. An

dialog: all five Indian men, hoist --
speaker_heading: THE AMERICAN FLAG

speaker_heading: CHASING HAWK
dialog: What is that that you honor there,

scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE ARBOR
text: the four FBI agents stand, watching.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Okay. Here we go.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Who's this guy?
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
dialog: Anderson Chasing Hawk. Second in
text: command behind Jimmy.
text: AT THE CROW'S NEST
text: Chasing Hawk hands the mic over to another Warrior. MAGGIE
dialog: EAGLE BEAR would be the most beautiful woman Ray has even
text: seen if she was not the meanest-looking. Her thick black
text: hair falls over a denim jacket down below her horse-hair
text: belt. Her faded jeans are stuffed into worn cowboy boots.
text: And she is full of fire. She begins speaking in LAKOTA.
text: Fluently. And with hand sign, like the old man.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE ARBOR
text: the agents stand. Cooch is writing into a small notebook.
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
text: Magedelana Eagle Bear. Eagle's claws
text: and a bear's balls.
speaker_heading: MILES
text: She keeps an AR-15 assault rifle in
dialog: her truck. And she'll use it.
text: As Ray watches her, someone approaches in a less hostile
text: manner. It is President Clear Moon, looking very upset. He
text: holds the hand of a LITTLE GIRL, dressed in traditional
text: dancing garb.
text: He approaches Ray.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Mr. Clear Moon.
speaker_heading: CLEAR MOON
dialog: Our police are afraid of them. Please
dialog: get them out of here.
text: Clear Moon gestures for the little girl to run off. He leans
text: in close to Ray.
speaker_heading: CLEAR MOON
dialog: They're going to kill me next. That's
dialog: what I hear. These new Indians are
dialog: destroying everything. Our people
dialog: are a quiet people.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let
dialog: them go. We're tightening the net on
dialog: him. We know he's on the reservation.
text: Clear Moon is looking past Ray at the Warriors. They are
text: approaching the agents, and Clear Moon looks at Ray with
dialog: great concern.
speaker_heading: CLEAR MOON
dialog: Help us.
text: And he slowly retreats to his lawn chair under the arbor.
text: Chasing Hawk, Maggie and the other Warriors strut up to the
text: agents. All but one who is bound to a wheelchair. We've seen
text: RICHARD YELLOW BIRD, the big Cheyenne who wears a Red Power
text: baseball cap, an earring, and thick bifocals -- in one of
text: the file photos. His arms are plastered with tattoos.
speaker_heading: AGENT SHERMAN
dialog: Where's Jimmy? We thought he'd be
dialog: dancing today.
text: The warriors make a show of not acknowledging the FBI
text: presence. They have walked over here just to walk by them.
text: That is there statement. But Yellow Bird stops cranking the
text: wheels of his chair and stop: long enough to look up at Ray.
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: Are you the Washington Redskin?
text: Even the agents crack grins at this bit of Indian wit. All
text: but Ray who just stands there, arms folded across his chest,
dialog: considering the crippled activist.
scene_heading: AGENT MILES
dialog: Say hello to Richard Yellow Bird,
dialog: Ray.
text: Yellow Bird sits there, staring up at him through thick
text: glasses But then Maggie Eagle Bear takes the handles of Yellow
text: Bird's wheel chair. She looks at Ray with eyes that are choke-
text: cherry black, eyes that look right through him. He returns
text: the glare. And then she pushes Yellowbird forward and leaves
dialog: the feds alone.
text: Ray turns to Cooch who is lighting a cigarette, and
text: concentrating on the movements of this group as they wander
text: under the arbor, visiting people. LAKOTA SINGERS start up.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Ray, get to Jimmy's place and keep
dialog: it tight. I'm gonna get a tail on
dialog: his Warriors.
text: IN THE POWWOW CENTER
text: the under ten year-old "fancy dance" -- TWENTY-FIVE INDIAN
text: CHILDREN, whirling and stomping and dancing.
scene_heading: JIMMY LOOKS TWICE HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The battered old house sits under a full moon. The upside
text: down flag moves slightly in the cross winds.
scene_heading: ACROSS THE ROAD
text: several junked cars. Among them a black, rusted out VW van
text: with a smashed windshield. A PACK OF RES DOGS sniff at its
dialog: tires.
scene_heading: INT. JIMMY'S VAN
text: In the dim light, a boot. A black cowboy boot. Up on the
text: dash. Bluejeans. T-shirt. Second hand leather. And a black
text: cowboy hat. Ray is staking out Jimmy's house.
text: Across the passenger seat and console is an M-16 rifle. On
text: his belt, a .357 Red Hawk. He yawns. From outside, he hears
text: a sound.
text: POV: down below the van, a small, patchy RES DOG with a
text: missing leg is looking up at him with his tongue long and
text: salivating.
text: RAY breaks off a piece of sandwich and drops it down to him
text: just as -- HEADLIGHTS catch his face. He slides down low,
text: watching an old pick-up truck creak onto the dirt road,
text: leading to Jimmy's.
text: POV: the truck parks. Someone jumps out, gracefully. Indian.
text: Long braid. Quick steps. Front door. Inside.
text: RAY lifts his radio.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: X22. Read.
speaker_heading: RADIO
dialog: Go ahead, Ray.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I have a pick-up truck. No plates.
dialog: Subject -- Indian -- entering
text: suspect's house. Over.
speaker_heading: RADIO
dialog: Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts
dialog: to leave the area, move in. And hold
text: him. Over.
text: Ray sets his radio down, unclips the leather guard on his
text: handgun. Picks up the Big Mac.
scene_heading: EXT. LOOKS TWICE HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The front door creaks open, and the subject dashes back out.
text: In the dark we cannot latch onto features.
text: Suddenly the junker van comes alive, guns onto the dirt road,
text: racing toward the running Indian who gets the door of the
text: truck open but freezes in the van's highbeams as --
text: Ray leaps out, M-16 in hand.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: FBI, freeze, Motherfucker -- drop
dialog: it, drop it!
text: Ray maneuvers in Quantico fashion, keeping the rifle on the
text: Indian's back. The Indian drops what he's holding. And turns
text: around. It's not a he. We've seen her before. At the Powwow.
text: Maggie Eagle Bear. Her hair is pulled back tight, braided.
text: Ray moves in toward her, surprised at first, but still
dialog: cautious
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Turn around, put your hands on the
text: roof of the truck.
text: She does what he tells her. As Ray moves in on her, he notices
text: an INDIAN CHILD sitting in the passenger seat, looking out
text: into the highbeams, frightened.
text: Ray toes Maggie's legs out wider, frisks her one-handed,
text: pats down her boots.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You're the Indian FBI.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: That's right. Turn around.
text: Maggie turns around, looks Ray in the eye. He looks self-
text: conscious in the cowboy hat.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: The people are glad they sent you.
dialog: They usually send in guys who come
dialog: at ya with highbeams, screamin' "drop
dialog: it, Motherfucker", stick a gun in
dialog: your face, frisk ya down. Even if ya
dialog: got a child with ya. No, it's good
dialog: to have ya. It's gonna be was-te
text: times on the res.
text: Ray is looking down at what she dropped. A bundle lying in
text: the grass. He bends down, starts to untie it.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I was gonna warn ya about messin'
dialog: with somebody's medicine bundle but
dialog: I forgot you know all about that
dialog: stuff.
text: IN THE BUNDLE -- an eagle skull, tobacco strings, sage, sweet
text: grass, and several white eagle feathers.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: This Jimmy's?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You're not gonna catch him. He can
text: shape-shift into different animals.
text: Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Is that like an hereditary thing,
dialog: Magdelana, or can one take classes?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you
dialog: wanna do this?
speaker_heading: RAY
text: He tried to kill him twice before.
dialog: That's a good place to start don't
dialog: ya think? Leo was on the other side,
dialog: wasn't he?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: -- Leo was an apple, that's right.
text: Red on the outside, white on the
dialog: inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked
dialog: his ass a coupla times. But he didn't
dialog: kill him.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Who did?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You're the FBI. That's your job,
dialog: isn't it? Ya know how many of our
dialog: Warrior brothers got killed out here?
dialog: I never saw any investigating then.
dialog: Why now? What's going down here?
speaker_heading: RAY
text: A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect.
text: Before somebody else gets a shotgun
text: blast in the spine.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All
text: over again.
text: Ray doesn't have a clue as to what this radical bullshit is
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Look. You and I can stand here in a
dialog: culture clash til the sun comes up,
dialog: talking about what's right and what's
dialog: wrong. You're from the reservation.
dialog: It's a different world.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street.
dialog: I did four years at Dartmouth before
dialog: I ever set foot on this res. So I
dialog: know about the other world, Ray.
dialog: If this information doesn't throw Ray, the use of his first
dialog: name does.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Are you gonna keep that medicine
dialog: bundle or are you gonna respect its
dialog: power?
text: Ray is holding the medicine bundle. He deliberates, then
text: hands it over. She takes it with careful hands, casting a
text: somewhat surprised look up at him.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: When you see Jimmy, tell him the
text: sooner he turns himself back into a
dialog: human being and gives himself in...
dialog: the sooner we back off this
dialog: reservation. Okay?
text: Maggie gets in the truck, starts it up. She looks out at
text: him, studying him. Trying to figure him out. HEADLIGHTS are
text: coming fast from down the main road.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Grandpa Reaches says you come from
dialog: heavy Indian blood. I used to think
dialog: Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I
dialog: know he is.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Move it, Magdelana.
text: Maggie drives forward, turning down another little wagon
text: road, and bumping into the black night only moments before,
text: Cooch's Le Baron pulls in.
text: SA Miles and Sherman's vehicle pull in behind it. The regional
text: feds fall in behind Cooch, everyone, packing rifles.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Ray, you alright?
text: Ray turns, nodding. An FBI van pulls in from the other
text: direction and FOUR AGENTS empty out, wearing FBI windbreakers
text: and heavily-armed.
speaker_heading: AGENT SHERMAN
dialog: What do we got, Ray?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: It was just Eagle Bear. I questioned
dialog: and released her.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: What'd she say?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: She talks a lot of shit. We're not
dialog: doing our job. Jimmy's innocent.
dialog: "What's the FBI really doing here."
dialog: Some shit about the Fort Laramie
dialog: Treaty.
text: Cooch nods. The agents form a tight unit out below the upside
dialog: down flag.
speaker_heading: RAY
text: She took something from the house.
dialog: What she called a medicine bundle.
text: Most likely Jimmy's.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Let's see it.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I gave it back to her.
speaker_heading: AGENT SHERMAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: If it is Jimmy's, she's taking it to
dialog: him. We'll have a runner. But I
dialog: borrowed a little mojo...
text: Ray reaches inside his pant leg, down around his boot and
text: carefully removes a white eagle feather. He gingerly tucks
text: it in a plastic bag.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Way to go, Raymond. Miles, take that
dialog: to lab. Sherman, I want you to go
dialog: back to base and produce some written
dialog: material. Something that indicates
dialog: that our girl Maggie is leaking
dialog: information to us. And make sure
dialog: that material finds its way into the
text: hands of the Warrior Movement.
text: Sherman and Miles, take off. Cooch, an impressive master of
text: COINTELPRO, now turns to the van squad.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: You gentlemen missed that medicine
dialog: basket. Go back through the house,
dialog: and make sure you missed nothing
dialog: else. And lay some wire, too. Let's
dialog: do it.
text: The van squad moves toward the house, leaving Cooch and Ray
text: alone in the highbeams that light the yard.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let
dialog: the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an
dialog: informant?
speaker_heading: COOCH
text: Her own people start to suspect her,
text: it creates discord from within. The
dialog: Warriors don't know who to trust,
text: they start infighting, and Jimmy
text: loses his support.
text: Ray nods, impressed.
text: Cooch bends down near the road, touches the dirt.
speaker_heading: COOCH
text: Her oil pan is shot.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Jesus, I don't know. You tell me.
dialog: You're the Indian.
text: Cooch wipes the oil on a handkerchief as he rises, smiling
text: playfully at Ray. He starts back toward his car. Some sort
text: of bird is COOING in the night.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Get a tail on her, Ray.
text: Ray looks up at the upside down flag. Then watches Cooch
text: walking way.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Cooch.
dialog: (a quiet, tired laugh)
dialog: Where the fuck did they send us?
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: A long way from home. You be careful
dialog: out there.
text: Cooch, standing there with his glasses on and his right arm
text: bandaged, looks tired, too. He gets in his car.
text: In the yard, Ray starts for the van, the res dog, trying to
text: follow. He chases it away. And then as he gets closer to the
text: van, he looks up to investigate the COOING SOUND.
text: AT THE TOP OF THE FLAG POLE
text: there is a shadow. What looks to be a large bird. It just
text: hovers. In the shadows.
speaker_heading: DOWN BELOW
text: Ray looks up at the pole, watching. Then walking on.
scene_heading: EXT. BEAR CREEK RES - SUNRISE
text: Mind-blowing sunrise of airbrush red. Clusters of lodge-pole
text: pine. The spectacular mesa. PAINT HORSES graze in a field, a
text: few out in the center of the road.
scene_heading: AT GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER
text: the old man comes down the front steps in a frail walk,
text: carrying a paper plate. He steps down into the sage clusters
text: that grow just off his trailer, and offers the plate up toward
dialog: the sky.
text: He then stoops, and scrapes a half-eaten English muffin,
text: some potato chips and half a banana onto the Earth in a neat
dialog: pile.
text: He straightens his back the best he can, looks up again, and
text: prays softly.
speaker_heading: THE BADLANDS
text: possess an otherworldly beauty at this magic hour, a maze of
text: shadows and rainbows. In the distance we cannot mistake the
text: frame of Walter Crow Horse. He's out there, long hair blowing
text: against the white bluffs. Stalking. Tracking.
text: ON THE VILLAGE ROAD
text: a puppy chases a hen in a klutzy, innocent manner then bumps
text: into the tire of a parked car. Taking a shot at doghood, he
text: hikes his leg, squirts a hubcap belonging to --
text: Cooch's Le Baron. Cooch leans on the hood, drinking a coffee
text: from a foam-plastic cup, and supervising SIX G-MEN who have
text: a map spread out over the hood and are discussing it.
scene_heading: MAGGIE EAGLE BEAR'S HOUSE
text: is way out in a remote corner of the res, a little home,
text: trailer and tipi right on the river. The river is rushing
text: hard this morning, catching the light of the sun. Maggie's
text: truck is parked in front.
text: Out at the river, Maggie, her hair long and unbrushed, and
text: wearing an extra large T-shirt and nothing else is hauling
text: water in buckets from the river.
text: THREE INDIAN CHILDREN are with her, helping her. Near the
text: house, an OLD WOMAN in bifocal glasses, feeds some chickens,
text: and a cat that gathers with the chickens and eats feed.
scene_heading: INT. OLD VAN  NEAR MAGGIE'S
text: Ray, still in his field clothes sits, training binoculars on
text: the distant house. He opens a carton of milk, drinks some.
text: Then hears a whimpering. In the passenger seat sits the three
text: legged res dog. Ray has taken him with him. He drinks some
text: milk, then opens the carton up fully and sticks it out so
text: the dog can lap it up. Ray laughs in disbelief, shaking his
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: For all I know, you're Jimmy. And
dialog: you're just waiting for a shot at my
dialog: jugular. Drink, Jimmy. Milk is good
dialog: for you --
text: The dog is lapping the milk, desperately. And then a ROARING.
text: A motorcycle.
text: IN THE SIDE MIRROR: Crow Horse, racing up on the left of the
text: van. Ray pulls his hat down low, and sits back. The motorcycle
text: passes on the left, slowing enough so that Crow Horse can
text: flip Ray the middle finger. Then he races on, far down the
dialog: road.
text: Ray sits there, shaking his head. He'll let it go. Bullshit.
text: He starts the car.
scene_heading: EXT. TRIBAL POLICE SHOOTING RANGE - DAWN
text: Crow Horse guns in, sliding in dirt up to the run-down, low
text: budget shooting range -- six plastic milk jugs on sticks,
text: jammed in the mud.
text: A moment later, the van hammers in. Parks. Ray gets out.
text: He's removed his hat so as not to invite any crap from Crow
dialog: Horse.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Don't be mad. That was just an old
dialog: traditional gesture that means hello,
dialog: how are you.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.
text: Ray executes a hard, slapping, "up your ass" gesture.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Have a nice day.
text: Crow Horse bursts into laughter in his raspy, staccato laugh.
text: He walks off a few steps, picks up a spent shell and pitches
text: it. His laughter simmers and he gets serious.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked
dialog: it out. You can stop taggin' my
dialog: sister.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: She's your sister?
scene_heading: RAY AND CROW HORSE
dialog: Spiritual sister.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Gotchya. We just nailed a genetic
dialog: match between the eagle feather left
text: at the murder site and one in Jimmy's
text: medicine bundle. It came from a white
dialog: eagle. Same bird.
text: Crow Horse fingers an eagle feather that hangs from his hat
dialog: band.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: So did this one. Wambli is a rare
dialog: and sacred creature. When someone
text: finds a dead one, the feathers get
dialog: around the res. We share everything.
dialog: A lot of power in the eagle feathers.
dialog: But you think that's bullshit too,
dialog: don't --
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (ala Crow Horse)
dialog: -- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the
text: outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a
text: car pulled into the yard. He came
text: out, approached the vehicle then saw
text: that the man behind the wheel was
text: Jimmy. He tried to get back into the
text: trailer, but the car came highballing
text: at him. He started running for the
text: open grass. With the car moving,
text: Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window,
dialog: took aim -- missed once, hitting the
dialog: shitter -- fired again, and severed
text: Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and
text: came to a stop in the grass. And
dialog: some chicken feed. Stale chicken
dialog: feed with four days mold.
dialog: (a beat)
text: Electromagnetic printing.
text: Crow Horse stares, a little surprised.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy
dialog: Looks Twice was nowhere near there.
dialog: Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years
dialog: old, his mother and father was killed
text: in a car wreck right down there near
dialog: Elk Mountain.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I don't see the connection.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: The connection is, it did a head
text: number on him. He's petrified of
dialog: cars. Won't drive. I've known him
dialog: all my life, and he's never gotten
text: behind the wheel of a vehicle. He
text: rides passenger and he rides horses,
dialog: and that's it. The man that shot Leo
text: down was behind the wheel of a moving
dialog: car.
text: Ray absorbs this with great interest.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: That's not solid.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: You want solid? That one, single,
dialog: print he left in the Badlands -- the
dialog: one the FBI missed and then stepped
dialog: all over -- it belongs to a man who
text: walks heels first. Like a white man.
dialog: Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk --
text: ball of the foot first. The man who
text: murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
text: Ray lets a pent-up sigh escape.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You're saying a white guy did it...
text: Crow Horse chews this over, unable to hide a nagging
text: frustration. He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: When Leo was dumped out there in the
text: Badlands, he was dropped on his back.
dialog: Our man made an effort to turn him
text: over, onto his face. It's an old
dialog: Ind'n belief that if a dead man is
dialog: turned face down, his spirit won't
dialog: leave. And in the killer's case, it
dialog: won't come back and jump all over
dialog: his shit. That's an Ind'n thing a
dialog: white man wouldn't know.
text: The two of them stand there, thinking this over. Ray takes
text: out his notebook and starts writing. Crow Horse walks away,
text: turns to face the propped up targets.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: And that's the way it is. Write it
dialog: down.
text: To punctuate, Crow Horse slaps leather, draws his .38, and
text: begins blasting at the milk bottles. He hits the bank. A
text: tree. One of the posts. But not a single target.
text: When he is done, he looks over his gun, disappointed. Starts
text: reloading. Ray starts laughing, looking at the missed targets
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: You laugh all you want, Breed. Sunset
dialog: tonight, I get my man.
text: Ray looks at Crow Horse, sees that he's serious, and follows
text: him toward his motorcycle.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Alright, Crow Horse. I'm listening.
text: I'm listening to the trees, to the
dialog: stones. Who is it?
text: Crow Horse turns toward Ray, and creates a long dramatic
dialog: pause.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Damned if I know.
text: And he hauls his bulk onto his motorbike.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: But the Old One. He did a Yuwipi
dialog: ceremony last night.
text: Crow Horse winks at Ray as he slams the kickstart. To no
dialog: avail.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: The old man? He's gonna tell you who
dialog: killed Leo?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's
dialog: gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him.
dialog: I'm late.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses
dialog: you're wearing.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Grandpa traded with me.
dialog: (flips the bird)
dialog: Goodbye.
text: And Crow Horse nails his kick start. The BIKE ROARS alive
text: and the Indian works the throttle hard, leaving gravel and
text: black exhaust. Ray stands there, drifting between logic and
text: instinct. He looks at his watch, then starts at a slow,
text: thoughtful shuffle toward his car.
scene_heading: EXT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
text: The dust-buzzard broncs and bounces down Grandpa's driveway,
text: coming to a stop near the wrecked cars. Crow Horse dismounts
text: and unhooks a carton of smokes from the back.
text: A moment later, the junker van pulls in, bouncing and shaking.
text: Crow Horse stares at the approaching vehicle, his eyes hidden
text: behind Ray's former shades. He cracks a slow smile because --
text: Ray is stepping quickly from the van, and carrying two packs
text: of Marlboros.
scene_heading: INT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER
text: Grandpa sits in his chair, his black eyes moving smoothly
text: from side to side. Smoke enshrouds his ancient face, giving
text: the sense of another time and place. He speaks LAKOTA.
text: Crow Horse, sitting on a stool across from him, holds The
text: Pipe. He passes it to Ray who sits in a busted lawn chair
text: next to him. The room is dark as the sun sets out the window
text: in red and purple. Ray looks at the pipe. Grandpa will not
text: speak until Ray smokes. And so he does, drawing on the stem,
text: awkwardly.
text: HEARTBEAT DRUM as Grandpa speaks Indian.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
text: He says, back behind Red Deer Table,
dialog: where the Elk-People-used-to-live...
dialog: there are strange creatures from
dialog: another world who eat stones... and
dialog: who will kill anyone who crosses
dialog: into this place.
text: Ray looks at Crow Horse, searching for a hint of lightness.
text: But there is only great reverence as he watches Ray blow
text: smoke upward.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: He says, in the Yuwipi ceremony last
dialog: night, he saw you... going back into
dialog: the land beyond Red Deer Table. I
dialog: was with you. But that was all the
text: Spirits let him see so he doesn't
dialog: know if you were killed or not. But
dialog: he thinks you probably were.
text: Ray smirks as he passes the pipe to Grandpa. Crow Horse looks
text: nervous. Grandpa offers the pipe to the directions and then
text: disengages the bowl from the stem. He speaks again. Crow
dialog: Horse translates.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Go to the land where the Elk-People-
dialog: used-to-live and you will find the
dialog: answers you came here looking for.
dialog: But you must go as two. That is the
dialog: vision. I have spoken. And this is
dialog: so.
text: Grandpa leans closer to Crow Horse and whispers some Lakota.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: He wants to trade.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: He likes your watch.
text: Ray looks at Crow Horse, nervous.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I can't do that,
dialog: (explaining)
dialog: It's a Rolex.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: A what?
text: And Grandpa is already holding out something to offer. It is
text: a cigarette. Grandpa offers it again.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'm sorry, this is --
dialog: (loud to Grandpa)
dialog: -- this is very, very expensive.
dialog: It's --
dialog: (to Crow Horse)
dialog: Tell him this is an expensive watch.
text: Crow Horse tells the Old Man. Grandpa speaks Indian.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: He says, you need to go on Indian
dialog: time. He says your watch is ruining
dialog: your life anyway.

speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Red Deer Table, Ray.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Don't tell me: heavy duty.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
text: Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi
dialog: Spirits. It's one of those few places
dialog: we'd never go to as kids. Still don't.
dialog: Some of the old people say Crazy
dialog: Horse is buried back there. We have
text: to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.
text: They step into the yard and Ray stops, turning to Crow Horse
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I
dialog: say that evil spirits are killing
dialog: everybody on the reservation?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Ray --
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: -- no. No offense to the old man. I
dialog: appreciate you trying to help. But I
dialog: put my ass on the line coming out
dialog: here, man.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: What'd you expect to hear?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Not Native American myths and legends.
dialog: I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember?
dialog: Not National Geographic.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: What you call myths, we call our
dialog: history.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: It's not real.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: What's real to you? Wall Street?
dialog: Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I can't be dicking around here. That's
dialog: all I'm saying. I don't carry
dialog: crystals, I don't wanna come back in
dialog: another life. I just wanna do my
dialog: job, and do it right, and get the
dialog: fuck outta here.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal
dialog: Mineo Indian.
text: Crow Horse drives "Indian" home with a hard finger in Ray's
text: chest. Ray knocks his hand away, explosively. Crow Horse is
dialog: ready.
speaker_heading: GRANDPA (O.S.)
dialog: Knock it off!
text: The old man is standing at the top of the steps. Ray and
text: Crow Horse are YELLING OVER EACH OTHER, and hands are up.
speaker_heading: GRANDPA
dialog: Will ya knock it off? You're actin'
text: like a couple of old women.
text: Ray stands there, one hand up in defense, another poised to
text: throw a punch. Bewildered, he stares at the old Indian holding
text: onto the porch railing.
speaker_heading: GRANDPA
dialog: For cryin' out loud. Knock it off.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: He speaks English.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Only when he's really pissed off.
speaker_heading: GRANDPA
dialog: Come inside. Watch TV.
text: And Grandpa goes back in, screendoor slapping shut behind
text: him. Ray is just staring, his jaw dropped. Crow Horse starts
text: laughing. Harder than he has yet, and Ray starts walking
text: toward his car in fuck-this steps.
text: He gets into the car, closes the door and looks out the open
text: window at Crow Horse. The Indian moves first.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Don't accuse nothin' of not bein'
dialog: real, Little Weasel. Cuz the only
dialog: thing around here that ain't real is
dialog: you.
text: Ray lifts his arm off the door, and springs his middle finger
text: up at Crow Horse. He holds it there for a long moment just
text: looking at the big Indian.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Take care of yourself, Walter.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Likewise.
text: Ray checks the time on his watch then guns away. Crow Horse
text: stands there, watching him go. Eventually he shuffles back
text: toward the trailer.
scene_heading: EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - NIGHT
text: Room 14 has been transformed into a major COINTELPRO base;
text: four computer terminals are set up, card tables spread with
text: photos, boxes of files stacked on the bed, and SIX AGENTS,
text: manning the computers, thumbing through files.
scene_heading: THE CONNECTING ROOM (RAY'S ROOM)
text: A meeting takes place around a table of paperwork and coffee
text: cups, and a .45 laid atop a file. Cooch, SA Miles, SA Sherman,
text: TWO OTHER REGIONAL AGENTS and Ray.
speaker_heading: SA SHERMAN
dialog: We've gotten word that Jimmy has
dialog: been trying to hook up with Maggie
dialog: Eagle Bear... but some of the Warriors
dialog: have been sending word to Jimmy that
text: she may be an FBI operative. So he
dialog: doesn't know where to go.
text: Cooch taps some ashes into an empty coffee cup. They sizzle
dialog: in cold residue.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Bingo. It's working.
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
text: He's out of room. All the reservation
dialog: exits have been watchdogged. We got
dialog: him. I give it twelve hours.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Well we better use those twelve hours
dialog: to apprehend the right man.
text: The agents all look at Ray. A pin can be heard falling to
text: the cheap carpet.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
speaker_heading: RAY
text: Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from
text: the driver's seat of a moving car
dialog: then drove those eight miles to the
dialog: Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never
text: been behind the wheel of a car. It's
dialog: a known fact out here that he's
text: petrified of driving. His parents
text: were killed in a car wreck.
text: Cooch nods, lights another smoke, intrigued.
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
dialog: That's not very solid.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: There was also a print found in the
dialog: Badlands that indicated diagetic
text: locomotion. Heels first. Jimmy's
text: walking pattern doesn't match. He
text: has a distinct Indian walk.
speaker_heading: SA MILES
dialog: Indian walk? You been smoking hooch
dialog: in the peace pipe, Ray?
text: LAUGHTER. Except for Cooch who just stares at Ray, digesting
dialog: what he has said.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: They don't smoke hooch in The Pipe,
dialog: Miles. They smoke something called
dialog: kinickinick, it's like a tobacco.
text: Sherman looks at Cooch.
speaker_heading: SA SHERMAN
dialog: Well, you're right about X21 being a
dialog: Washington Redskin, that's for sure.
dialog: What else, Ray?
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: You boys want a soda?
speaker_heading: SA MILES
dialog: Oh, yeah, a Coke. You buying?
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: No, Ray's buying. Sherman? Coke?
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
dialog: Oh... no. No, Cooch, I'm working on
dialog: a coffee here. Indian walk?
text: Cooch nods to Ray and Ray follows, gathering up some paperwork
text: He looks determined as a terrier.
scene_heading: EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - NIGHT
text: Ray and Cooch throw long, slim shadows on their way to an
text: archaic Coke machine.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Genetic ditto on evidence found at
dialog: the site with evidence you found in
text: his belongings. An incontrovertible
text: motive. And definite footprints on

dialog: house.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: When did we get that?
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Today. And now you -- there's a dog
dialog: in the van --
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: -- I know. I fed it, and I can't get
dialog: rid of --
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: You weren't sent here to go off on
dialog: your own detail, Ray. You were sent
dialog: here to assist in a Selective
dialog: Operations Unit. These regional agents
dialog: are inept -- that's why they were
dialog: sent out here to The Graveyard, to
dialog: Indian Country. I need you behind
dialog: me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'm not trying to pull against you,
dialog: Cooch. I've just been having
dialog: nightmares about the way Leo was
dialog: killed.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Your first homicide, that's gonna
dialog: happen, Ray...
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I just wanna make sure no one else
dialog: gets done in that way because we
dialog: were in bed with the wrong doer.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Ray. I never get into bed with
dialog: somebody unless I know for sure.
dialog: Just the way I was raised.
text: Ray studies him with a smile building. Cooch shrugs, sips
dialog: some soda.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Alright. Alright...
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: (lightly)
dialog: Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you --
dialog: give a yuppie a badge and he wants
dialog: to take over the world. Go get a
dialog: tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with
dialog: her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I
dialog: want you to make the collar.
text: Ray nods, starting for the van.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Ray.
text: He turns. Cooch looks at him for a time. It is a warm look.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: I'll sleep around a little.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Thanks, Cooch.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: And get rid of the dog.
text: Ray gets in and pulls the dog out. The dog sits at roadside,
text: tilting its head at him, confused. And he pulls out. It runs
text: after him.
scene_heading: EXT. DIRT ROAD NEAR EAGLE BEAR'S - RES - NIGHT
text: The van sits parked down the road from Maggie's dimly-lit
text: home. Ray sits behind the wheel, watching the house. LOCUSTS
text: make a steady and unnerving sound. It is black. Black under
text: big sky. Ray lets his head sag out the open window and he
text: takes in the vastness.
text: POV: stars. Millions of stars. And an incredible full moon.
text: It hangs huge over distant fields, a perfect sphere. The top
text: half of the moon is yellow, the bottom half a lava red.
speaker_heading: REVERSE - RAY
text: stares at it, lost in thought. From Maggie's house, he hears
text: someone SINGING. Singing a traditional SUNDANCE SONG while
text: they haul water from the creek. A WOMAN'S VOICE, trilling
text: out the beautiful but haunting "hey-o-hey-o-hey-o-hey-ohhhhh."
text: Ray just sits, listening. And then something draws his
text: attention to his rearview mirror.
text: The res dog, lying in the back seat is GROWLING. Lip curled
text: back, growling low.
text: Ray looks at him, looks out the window. Blackness. Nothing
text: but the sound of locusts. And a slight crosswind in the wheat
text: fields. The dog stops growling. And Ray fixes his gaze on
text: the house again, lifting a pair of binoculars and --
text: BOOOOOOM! The rear windshield is SHATTERED by an explosion.
text: Ray throws himself low across the passenger seat -- BOOOOOM!
text: The driver's side window and part of the door explodes.
scene_heading: RES ROAD NEAR EAGLE BEAR'S
text: The federal van is HAMMERED BY GUNFIRE. All the windows,
text: shattered, the metal doors splayed. Someone is going for the
dialog: kill,
scene_heading: THE PASSENGER DOOR
text: is thrown open just as its window implodes, and Ray slides
text: out belly first, gripping his M-16 and crawling like a dog
text: soldier into tall wheat at roadside as the car, the road,
text: the wheat, the dirt, the night are slammed by gunfire.
text: The res dog overtakes Ray and vanishes in the wheat. Ray
text: vanishes, too. It is quiet for a moment, then Ray, pops up
text: ten feet away, and UNLOADS THE M-16, in a left to right,
text: clean sweep before dropping again. He lies there, listening.
text: The LOCUST HAVE GONE QUIET. His breath is heavy. His heart's
text: got to be pounding through the dirt he lays in.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Motherfucker.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - THE ROAD
text: the decimated van, aerial still high. The distant lights of
text: Maggie's house. And the giant Moon, hovering over it all.
dialog: HEARTBEAT DRUM into --
scene_heading: SAME ROAD  RES - DAWN
text: TWENTY FEDS comb the dirt road, the wheat fields, picking up
text: shells with gloved hands, scanning the vast distance.
text: IN THE FRONT YARD of Maggie's, FOUR INDIAN CHILDREN stand
text: with the Old Woman, watching.
scene_heading: INT. LE BARON  TRAVELING  ANOTHER DIRT ROAD
text: Cooch, flushed in the face, mans the wheel. He wears only a
text: T-shirt which indicates, a desperate rush to the scene. His
text: eyes scan the surrounding homes and fields.
text: In the passenger seat, Ray sits, drinking a coffee. He looks
text: haggard.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Bastards...
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: All I could think of was... not here.
dialog: I don't wanna eat it on an Indian
dialog: Reservation, three thousand miles
dialog: from home.
speaker_heading: COOCH
text: He's out there. He's out there playing
dialog: Sitting Bull with us. I want the
dialog: motherfucker so bad I'm getting a
text: bleeding ulcer.
text: Ray turns around in his seat, looking off across dry land.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: It may have been Maggie's way of
dialog: saying "get off my ass."
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: She's that subtle?
speaker_heading: RAY
text: Eagle's claws and a bear's balls
dialog: that's what her profile says.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Well, she's running now, too. These
dialog: fucking people like to run, don't --
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: -- Cooch. Woh. Stop.
text: He does. Ray is turned around in his seat, staring off into
dialog: the distance.
scene_heading: EXT. DIRT ROAD
text: The Le Baron whines backward, and off the road, into some
text: grass Ray steps out, keeping his gaze fixed. Cooch bails
text: from the driver's side, joins him.
scene_heading: HEARTBEAT DRUM.
text: RAY'S POV: Four-hundred feet across a flat area of sandstone
text: and grass clusters, something shimmers in the undulations of
text: the harsh morning sun. Something of pea green and rusty
text: metal... glass catches sunlight and makes prisms. A car. An
text: old res car, sitting in a long, chasm in barely a foot of
dialog: green water.
scene_heading: EXT. DRY WASH - SHORT TIME LATER - PAY
text: Ray and Cooch go through the car, around the car, with gloved
text: hands and grease pencils and plastic bags, sweating in the
text: hot sun.
speaker_heading: COOCH
text: Tread matches. It's the car.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yes.
text: Excited, Ray walks off, scanning the area.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: But this doesn't make any sense,
dialog: Ray. If it's just been sitting in
dialog: this dry wash for seven days... why
dialog: the hell didn't we find it?
text: Ray picks up a handful of stones, sifts them in his hands.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Because this isn't a dry wash.
text: Cooch watches him slosh shoes first through a rut where the
text: water shimmers a foot deep or less.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: It's the Little Walking River.
text: Ray turns, shucking up mud.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: And it was full of water when I drove
dialog: by here three days ago. Full. I
dialog: mean... a river.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: The Little Walking River. You're
dialog: right. This is part of it. So whoever
dialog: sunk this car didn't compensate for
dialog: drought. Goddamn.
text: Ray doesn't hear Cooch. He stares past the SAC at the long
text: wide chasm, wet in some places, arid in others, and what he
text: hears must be an echo in his head.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Listen to the water...
text: Cooch is listening to a TRANSMISSION across his radio and he
text: walks off a few feet, exchanging information with the
scene_heading: REGIONALS.
text: Ray stands, ankle deep in stagnant water, his face sweat-
text: soaked, his eyes transfixed on heat undulations.
scene_heading: EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - ROOM 13 - DAY
text: A flat-bed tow truck drives past the motel with the killer's
text: car on it. Behind the truck is a fed car which stops at the
text: motel, and the Le Baron which also pulls in. Miles and Sherman
text: get out from the first car, Ray and Cooch bail from the Le
dialog: Baron.
text: With RADIOS TRANSMITTING, the agents walk, dusty and tired,
text: into room 14. Ray hesitates, snagged by the sight of --
text: A motorcycle parked in front of the Buffalo Butte Bar. Parked
text: with pick-up trucks and station wagons. It's the mud-caked
text: old Barley. Parked right under the NO INDIANS sign.
text: He puzzles over this.
scene_heading: INT. BUFFALO BUTTE BAR - DAY
text: Dark. Even during the day. Cigarette smoke. Sawdust. On the
text: archaic juke box, RANDY TRAVIS sings "Old 8x10" while behind
text: the bar, the BAR OWNER, an old man with long white hair and
text: beard, busies himself with leather work. SEVERAL WHITE LOCALS
text: sit on the old water drum bar stools.
text: Heads lift, turn when Ray enters in his "fraternizing" clothes --
text: jeans and boots, leather jacket. He scuffs up thick sawdust
text: as he heads to the furthest booth back where --
text: Crow Horse sits, alone over a bourbon and a beer. Ray
text: approaches carefully, upset by the sight. He slides into the
text: booth and point blanks the Indian.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of
dialog: your Imagination.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What
dialog: are you doing?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: You're right about the old man. His
dialog: power's long dried up. He's supposed
dialog: to be a medicine man but he won't go
dialog: see the people. He says we changed,
dialog: and we don't listen. Well, he don't
dialog: go out and talk no more. I haven't
dialog: had a drink in three years but I
dialog: just turned my sobriety chip into
dialog: that man behind the bar, and this
text: Hoss is gettin' watered.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in
dialog: here, Man.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Cuz I'm a skin?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Cuz you're a cop.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Not no more.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: You tell me. You tell me who went to
dialog: the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian
dialog: Annihilation and said I was messin'
dialog: with your case, man. I don't give a
dialog: goddamn about your case.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: And I don't give a goddamn about
dialog: whether you wear a badge or not,
dialog: Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.
text: Crow Horse shimmers his black eyes onto Ray.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Still after Jimmy?
speaker_heading: RAY
text: They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Yeah. Jimmy's prints are there. But
text: they cross over Benjamin Black Star's
dialog: prints. And he wasn't there until
dialog: six o'clock the mornin' after to get
dialog: eggs from the chickens. So Jimmy
dialog: wasn't there til the next day. Follow?
text: Ray just looks vacantly at Crow Horse. Crow Horse resents
dialog: the vacancy.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Look, man... you better bust Jimmy
dialog: and get out before somebody shoots
dialog: up more than your car next time.
text: Ray glares at him.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Next time I'll be ready. You get the
dialog: word to who ever it is.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
text: Ray doesn't blink.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: You think you was sent here cuz you're
dialog: a good cop?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian.
dialog: And a good cop.
text: Crow Horse leans toward Ray and speaks more quietly.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: You ever think that maybe you was
dialog: sent here cuz the FBI's need one
dialog: good reason to take out the entire
dialog: Warrior Movement. And what better
dialog: reason than one of their men, gettin'
text: blown away on the res. A low-rent,
dialog: expendable public servant sent in to
dialog: take a bullet for his country.
text: Ray is fuming. He can't believe what he's hearing, what's
text: being insinuated, but he's giving it thought and it's getting
text: him angry. He smashes a hand down on the table.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'm sick of your shit --
speaker_heading: RANCHER (O.S.)
dialog: I'm sick of the two of ya timber
text: niggers spewin' off.
text: Standing over the booth is a long, tall RANCHER'S SON. Rangey
text: with red curly hair tucked under a BLACK HILLS CLASSIC cap,
text: and arms built by tractor work. And behind him, TWO OLDER
text: RANCHERS fall in. And ANOTHER YOUNG MAN, grinning with
dialog: amusement.
text: Ray and Crow Horse look up.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Sorry, we don't speak United States.
speaker_heading: RANCHER'S SON
dialog: Yeah, well I do. Get the Jesus up,
dialog: and get the Jesus out or I'm gonna
dialog: go out to my truck and come back
dialog: with my hardware.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Woh, hold on there, Jack, you're --
speaker_heading: RANCHER'S SON
dialog: -- don't "jack" me, Squanto. I'll
dialog: bury your lazy ass right here.
text: Ray realizes now that they think he's Indian, too. Crow Horse
text: sees this revelation and complicates it by suddenly speaking
text: LAKOTA to Ray.
text: The rancher grabs Ray by the cheeks.
speaker_heading: RANCHER'S SON
dialog: I'm talkin' to --
text: Ray decks him. Backhands him in the solar plexus then, lays
text: a burner of a Quantico roundhouse to his ear, knocking him
text: across the bar, over a mop and bucket and into sawdust.
text: The others start to fall at him but someone has jumped in,
text: holding them back, and sticking himself in the way. It is
dialog: Brooks. The old timer Ray met his first night here.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: No! No, you butt holes! He ain't
dialog: skin! He AIN'T SKIN!
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Yeah he's In'dn. Miniconjou Sioux.
text: The rancher's son who is coming back with a broken beer
text: bottle, slows his step and shifts his eyes from Brooks to
text: the young fed There is a lot of heavy breathing. But no
text: talking just yet. The young rancher eyes Ray.
speaker_heading: RANCHER'S SON
dialog: You ain't Indian?
text: Ray just stands tense, staring at him. And it's strange.
dialog: Because he hasn't really looked like he has any Indian blood
text: up to this moment. But dressed the way he is, and his eyes
text: glaring, face drawing tense, he might pass for a breed
text: although that's probably the Italian. But Ray doesn't answer
text: the question. Crow Horse starts laughing. Drunkenly.
speaker_heading: OLDER RANCHER
dialog: What's so damn funny?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Well, it's just that the cavalry
dialog: used to always threaten the Lakota.
dialog: The cavalry ain't around anymore.
dialog: The Lakota still are.
speaker_heading: RANCHER'S SON
dialog: I got no trouble tellin' where you
dialog: come from, Fat Red.
text: Crow Horse rises and walks unsteadily across the floor,
text: leaving the bar. Brooks is whispering to the others,
text: apparently about who Ray is. The bar man comes up to Ray,
text: holding a tray, on which sits a shot and a beer. Ray looks
text: at it for a moment.
speaker_heading: BAR MAN
dialog: Sorry. On the house.
text: Ray knocks the tray out of his hand, spilling beer and whiskey
text: all over the bar man and the locals around him.
text: And he walks out, leaving the locals confused.
scene_heading: INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING - RES - DAY
text: Ray looks strung-out as he drives. If it's not the conflict
dialog: at the Butte, it's the dangerous seed Crow Horse planted,
text: and it is playing with his mind. He is on his RADIO.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No plates. No registration. Serial
dialog: numbers removed. And all prints washed
dialog: off by the river. That's great. This
text: is turning out to be a walk in the
dialog: park, do you know that?
speaker_heading: RADIO
dialog: (woman agent)
dialog: Come back?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Never mind.
text: But before he hangs the radio. IT CUTS BACK IN.
speaker_heading: RADIO
text: Ray. X22.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I read, Cooch.
speaker_heading: RADIO
dialog: Remember that upside down flag back
dialog: at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: RADIO
dialog: They took it down, set fire to it,
text: and threw it on the doorstep of room
dialog: 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your
dialog: room.
text: Ray seethes quietly as he drives.
speaker_heading: RADIO
dialog: We traced the number of the truck
dialog: that dumped it, and it belongs to
dialog: one Maggie Sanders, also known as
dialog: Maggie Eagle Bear. She's been all
text: over the res, riling up the
dialog: traditionals, telling them not to
text: break, and to keep Jimmy in hiding.
dialog: She's a problem now. And she's yours.
dialog: Get her off the reservation.
text: Ray keeps driving.
scene_heading: EXT. WOUNDED KNEE MEMORIAL - DAY
text: Maggie's old pick-up is parked near an arch gate of the tiny
text: cemetery where a tall monument is fenced off from other graves
text: There are tobacco offerings and other medicines hanging on
text: the fence and on the monument.
text: It is a quiet place. Still.
text: Maggie stands before the unkempt monument in her denim jacket,
text: her hair blowing across her face in the wind. She PRAYS IN
speaker_heading: LAKOTA.
text: Behind her TEN CHILDREN from the Bear Creek School stand,
text: heads bowed respectfully. Two of them sit on the lap of
text: Richard Yellow Bird who looks on from his wheelchair, praying
text: quietly with Maggie. When Maggie completes her prayer, she
text: ties some tobacco to the monument then turns and faces the
text: children. One of them, a LITTLE GIRL -- heavy-set -- raises
dialog: a hand that we might note is deformed. As many of the children
dialog: we have seen on the res, are.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: Are they all right under here?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Two-hundred and sixty-seven men,

speaker_heading: LITTLE BOY
dialog: Where were they runnin' to?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: A place called The Stronghold.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: They died for a dream. But you live.
dialog: You are their great-great

dialog: to honor their dream. Of protecting
dialog: the Mother Earth. And being proud of
dialog: being Indian.
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOY
dialog: My mother told me that they call us

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Yeah, well, let me tell you something,
dialog: Henry: just be glad he wasn't looking

text: him. Behind her an HONORING SONG, sung by ten children haunts
text: the still air.
text: He doesn't budge as she mounts the gentle bluff and joins
dialog: him there.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: We're praying at the grave. Do you
dialog: wanna join us?
text: A long silence. The voices carry in the wind.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No, Maggie. But you're gonna have to
dialog: join me for a ride. I'm taking you
dialog: to Rapid City.
text: Maggie looks at him. They lock eyes.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: So much power. I see it in your eyes.
dialog: This... hunger for power. Or for
dialog: what you think is power.
text: As if exhausted by the thought, Maggie sits down on the bluff,
text: looking out at the children who are still singing the song.
text: As she speaks, she begins digging her fingers in the earth.
text: Ray stands over her.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You burned an American flag today.
dialog: And left it for me...
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: -- You desecrated it, it had to be
dialog: burned.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I desecrated it?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You forced an innocent man to run
dialog: like an animal. You've tried to poison
dialog: my people's hearts against me with
dialog: your manipulation, with letters I
dialog: never wrote... you've been watching
dialog: me eat, work, raise my family...
dialog: wash myself in the river. And now
dialog: you're here, arresting me at a sacred
dialog: place.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: In your eyes, that's power.
text: Maggie lifts herself onto her knees and looks down into the
text: small hole she's dug. She picks up a little pine cone.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: So I plant this tree for you. And I
dialog: take all this stuff that you've laid
dialog: on me and my people, and I put it in
dialog: this hole with this pine cone.
dialog: (she covers it)
dialog: And I bury it. Cuz ya know what it
dialog: is, Ray? Bullshit. And shit is
dialog: fertilizer.
dialog: (she stands)
dialog: And The Mother will turn your lies
dialog: into something that lives.
text: Maggie rises, dusting off her hands. She looks him in the
dialog: soul.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: That's what power is, in the Indian
dialog: way.
text: (holds her hands out
dialog: to be cuffed)
dialog: Take me to Rapid, Ray. I'm the enemy.
text: Ray just stares at her, struggling with what he's feeling,
text: what he's hearing. What he's supposed to be feeling. Silence
text: hangs between the two of them.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: If I told you... that I think Jimmy's
dialog: innocent... but I'm in over my head...
dialog: would you believe me?
text: Maggie looks at him, considering. Then toward the long dark
text: silhouette of a mountain range across the plains.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: See those Black Hills out there,
dialog: Ray? When the people lost the land
dialog: in 1868, the government took
dialog: everything but those hills. They
dialog: allowed us to keep those Black Hills,
dialog: to live there. Signed a treaty. Until
dialog: they found gold. Then they told us
dialog: we had to leave because of National
dialog: interest. They broke that treaty.
dialog: Anyone who fought or spoke out against
dialog: it, wound up dead or in jail. And
dialog: the people wound up here. On a
dialog: reservation.
text: While she looks off at Paha Sapa, Ray stares at her profile.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: While up there, in the Black Hills...
dialog: they carved the faces of four
dialog: presidents.
text: She looks at Ray with an ironic smile, and she catches him
text: transfixed.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Your relatives must've taught you
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: NO.
dialog: (after thought)
dialog: My father never told anybody he had
dialog: Indian blood. But he still used a
text: few Indian words around the house.
dialog: He called me Washee. Said it meant...
dialog: good boy.
text: Maggie starts giggling.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like
dialog: tallow we put in stew. I think he
dialog: was calling you chubby boy.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Great.
text: Maggie is laughing as she looks back at the children who are
text: no longer singing. Ray reaches inside his jacket and takes
text: out five polaroids. He shuffles them as he ponders. He hands
text: one to Maggie who has caught herself opening up too much to
dialog: the Wasi'cu.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You ever see that car before?
text: Maggie looks at the first photo and says nothing. She hands
text: it back quickly. Ray won't take it.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Who's it belong to?
text: Maggie ignores him. Ray studies her reaction.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Help me, Maggie...
text: Maggie is looking away. She picks a long blade of grass and
text: smoothes it in her hands.
text: Ray looks at her a moment longer then rises, dusting off his
text: jeans, and standing there. He thinks for a long moment,
text: pinches the bridge of his nose, then looks out at the Black
text: Hills, pensive.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I didn't see you today, Maggie.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Goodbye.
text: Maggie watches him go. Looks away. Then watches him again.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Goodbye... Wa-shee.
text: Ray stops. She stands on the bluff, her hair riding the wind
text: and her eyes searing. And then her lips do something that
text: might qualify as half a smile. A sense of humor rising up
text: through anger. Survival humor.
text: Ray looks at her for a long moment. And then he walks on,
text: leaving her there.
scene_heading: INT. LE BARON - PARKED AT WOUNDED KNEE - DAY
text: Ray sits behind the wheel, going through files on his lap,
text: photographs of Indians. And thinking hard.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Anyone who fought or spoke out against
dialog: it... wound up dead or in jail.
text: Ray looks out the window toward the monument.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (to himself, flustered)
dialog: That was 1868, Maggie...
text: Exhausted, Ray lays his head back on the seat, and lets a
text: long, constricted breath free. THUNDER ROLLS like the slow,
text: deep roar of some giant bear up in the hills. He opens his
text: eyes, looks out the window.
text: POV: rain is coming down, and Maggie is getting the children
text: into the back of her truck. She helps them get a tarp over
text: their heads. Then as Yellow Bird pulls himself into the cab
text: of the truck, she hefts the wheelchair and two boys load it
dialog: in.
text: She gets in, starts up, and rolls off down the sloping road.
scene_heading: EXT. LE BARON - WOUNDED KNEE  STRANGE TWILIGHT
text: Ray steps out of the car into the rain and closes the door.
text: He stares at the burial grounds. Then slowly, he starts toward
text: them as if magnetically drawn. HEARTBEAT DRUM.
text: A shroud of mist lays over the cemetery, growing thicker as
text: the rain falls harder. DRUM BEATS DEEPER. Ray is walking
text: toward the memorial, getting drenched. Then he hears something
text: strange. HOOFBEATS.
speaker_heading: RAY'S POV:
text: coming down the dirt road, toward him, a HORSEMAN drives his
text: mount at a fast trot. The rider is only a vague image in the
text: mist, his face hidden. As he rides closer, we can make out a
text: shotgun in his hand. And he throws it up, takes aim.
speaker_heading: REVERSE - RAY
text: paralyzed for a moment. And then going for his gun. But it's
text: not there. He's left it in the car. He breaks into a run.
text: But there's a shorter distance now between the horseman and
text: the car and Ray has no choice but to turn and flee.
text: His boots slap wet pavement, and his breath draws heavy and
text: desperate as he bounds off the road and races down a grassy
text: slope, looking over his shoulder, panicking.
text: His legs and arms churning, his face contorted. And then
text: someone passes him out, running just as hard. AN INDIAN WOMAN
text: in 1890 Winter rags, clutching a BABY to her breast and
text: CRYING. SCREAMING. Ray looks at her, incredulous as he runs.
text: But he keeps running.
text: The rider is right behind him. He FIRES. The GUNSHOT CRACKS
text: the sky like thunder. BOOOOM!
scene_heading: INT. LE BARON  TWILIGHT
text: Ray jumps awake. Cooch is POUNDING on the window. And the
text: three-legged dog inside is BARKING. Ray quickly rolls the
text: window down, letting in THUNDER.
text: Cooch starts to say something then takes note of Ray's peaked
text: face. Sweat runs down his temples, beads at his nose.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Jesus, you alright?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't
dialog: believe it. I --
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Never turn your radio off! I thought
dialog: I was gonna find you scalped! Damn
dialog: it!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: -- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got
dialog: Jimmy nailed. Let's go!
text: And Cooch runs to his car. Ray fires the car's big engine
text: and takes off behind Cooch who is driving a fed Chevy. CRAZY
scene_heading: HEARTBEAT DRUM INTO --
scene_heading: EXT. GRANDPA REACHES TRATLER - LATE DAY
text: The rain pelts Grandpa's little Airstream trailer, wind snaps
text: at sheet plastic in the windows. An ancient sewing wheel
text: CREAKS RUSTY in the wind.
text: Three clean, late-model fed cars pull down the muddy drive
text: as two SWAT vehicles pull in from another road. The Le Baron
text: pulls in, and Ray bails out with the others. When he sees
text: where he is, he looks distraught.
text: Agents are running behind junked cars, positioning themselves
text: around the trailer.
scene_heading: INT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER  LATE DAY
text: The holy man is sitting in his chair, smacking Flies with a
text: swatter. Tonight he wears a black reservation hat and stares
text: vacantly at the TV where RONALD MACDONALD swings a giant
text: baseball bat, and falls on his face, bouncing back up. And
dialog: then BOOM!
text: The door is open and Cooch leads Miles, Sherman and Ray
text: inside. Cooch has a gun on the old man.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!
text: The old man slowly removes his hat and hangs it on a knee.
text: Carefully he places his wrinkled hands on his thinning white
text: hair. His eyes seek out Ray who stands in the doorway, M-16
text: in hand, looking concerned. He stares at Ray.
text: Cooch storms into a back bedroom, Miles moves to a window.
text: Sherman stands over the old man.
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
dialog: Where is he, Sam? Where's Jimmy?
text: Grandpa looks at Sherman, ignores him, looks back at Ray.
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
dialog: He's a medicine man, Ray. The
dialog: "spiritual leader" of the Warriors.
dialog: That right, Sam?
text: With RADIO TRANSMISSIONS crackling through the house, Cooch
text: comes back down the hall, and heads to the door.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Trailer's clean, let's go.
text: Ray starts to follow but he sees Sherman pick something up
text: from near Grandpa. The 500 year-old turtleshell rattle.
text: Grandpa's eyes widen slightly.
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
dialog: You been the one making it rain like
dialog: that, out there, Sam?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Hey, put that down.
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
dialog: Can you make Jimmy outrun an M-16,
dialog: Sam?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Sherman!
text: Sherman drops the turtleshell rattle on the linoleum floor.
text: Then drives his heel into it, CRUSHING the fragile
dialog: turtleshell.
text: Ray grabs him and slams him into the tin wall. Miles gets
text: between them, grabbing Sherman.
speaker_heading: MILES
scene_heading: EASY, MEN! HEY! --
speaker_heading: RADIO
text: HE'S ON THE ROOF! HE'S ON THE FUCKING
text: ROOF! COME ON GUYS, COME ON, GUYS!
text: They're out the door, leaving the old man to sit looking
text: down at the shattered rattle. He closes his eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER
text: In a blizzard of rain, Jimmy Looks Twice in a cowboy shirt,
text: jeans and boots, leaps off the top of the Airstream, clutching
text: his medicine bundle. FLOODLIGHTS HIT him from all directions.
text: BULLHORNS screaming at him.
text: He tries to turn a corner and runs right into a fed. Ray,
text: having run out the back door has slammed right into him. He
text: has his rifle on him, and they stare each other down for a
text: split second before he is converged on. Guns at his back, at
text: his head.
text: He is swept off his feet, face down, and frisked. He looks
text: up at Ray, desperately.
speaker_heading: LOOKS TWICE
dialog: Brother, the old man told me about
dialog: you. Listen to me: what was Leo trying
dialog: to tell me? He wanted to meet me at
dialog: Maisy --
text: Another fed, pushes his face into the mud, cuffs him behind
text: his back.
speaker_heading: FED
dialog: Save your speeches for prison, Jimmy.
text: With two FIVE MAN SWAT TEAMS swarming the area, and six agents
text: pushing Jimmy toward a car, Cooch stands there in the pouring
text: rain, looking relieved. Ray stands near him, looking abhorred.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Damn. That's one hard running Indian.
text: Ray watches Jimmy as he is shoved into the back of Miles and
text: Sherman's car and driven away. He is twisting around in his
text: seat to look at Ray. Desperately. The SWAT teams disband,
text: return to their vehicles.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: It's over, Ray. I aged five years.
dialog: But it's over. At least I'm gonna
dialog: look like I'm ready for the advisory
dialog: desk. Let's go get a beer.
text: Cooch heads to his car and Ray starts shuffling toward his
text: as if he is dared by it all. He is looking at the trailer
text: and there on the rickety porch is Grandpa. He comes down the
text: steps slowly, holding his hat on against the wind. He watches
text: the cars pulling out.
text: Ray walks over to him, looking sick.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Look... I'm not who you think I am.
dialog: (a long beat)
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: And after a moment of locking gazes, he starts for his car,
speaker_heading: GRANDPA
dialog: Out back that way... is a placed
dialog: called Wounded Knee.
text: Ray turns.
speaker_heading: GRANDPA
dialog: I was one years old there when our
dialog: people were shot down. My mother hid
text: me in the snow in a blanket. One of
dialog: those killed was a Holy Man called
dialog: Wakiyan Cante -- Thunder Heart. They
dialog: killed him while he was running for
dialog: The Stronghold. It is his blood --
dialog: the same blood that spilled on the
dialog: grass and snow at Wounded Knee --
dialog: that runs through your heart like a
dialog: buffalo.
text: Ray frowns, disturbed by this story.
text: The old man is speaking with conviction. With power.
speaker_heading: GRANDPA
dialog: Thunder Heart has come. Sent here to
text: a troubled place to help his people.
dialog: That's what I am told. Maybe you're
dialog: right and I am mistaken. Your mind
dialog: is young, mine is old. If so, so be
dialog: it. Ho Hecetu Yelo. I'll speak no
dialog: more.
text: Ray stands, almost paralyzed, digesting this. He turns and
text: looks into the old man's sharp eyes. Grandpa has closed his
text: eyes, and as he is pulverized by the rain, he turns his face
text: toward it and from way down in his belly, he begins to SING
text: IN LAKOTA. And it is too much. Too weird. He wheels and
text: hurries to the car. Gets in, and beats a fast path out of
text: the old man's lonesome patch of land.
text: BLUE HEAT LIGHTNING knifes the sky. THUNDER ROLLS, and rumbles
scene_heading: into POOL BALLS --
scene_heading: EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL AND BAR - LATE DAY
text: The agents have taken over both sides of the streets, gathered
text: in front of the bar and the motel, putting firearms into
text: cases, removing flak jackets.
text: POOL BALLS knock from inside the bar while outside, A DAKOTAN
text: takes a piss near a truck while his GIRLFRIEND stands at his
text: back, yelling at him. CHARLIE DANIELS sings country on the
text: juke Ray heads to room 13, starts unlocking the door. Cooch
text: comes up behind him.
speaker_heading: COOCH
text: Buffalo burgers and cold beer,
dialog: Raymond. Don't worry about the sign
dialog: out front... you don't have to be
dialog: Indian anymore.
text: Cooch throws a mock punch at Ray and he mock blocks, tired.
text: He musters a smile. But he isn't all there.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: You have a fever. You okay?
text: Ray nods. Cooch lets a few agents walk past, LAUGHING. He
text: speaks quietly.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Listen: when we get back tomorrow,
dialog: you're gonna find Tully laying a
dialog: promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to
dialog: prove that his yuppie agents are
dialog: making good. He's offering you New
dialog: York. Tell him you want Atlanta.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Cuz I want New York.
text: Ray tries to break a smile again. Cooch cups his arm.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Cooch. They sent us out here because
dialog: the place was being neglected. Now,
dialog: all of a sudden, there's two five
dialog: man SWAT teams out there tonight.
text: Bell Huey choppers flying all over
dialog: the place. Federal occupation to
dialog: catch one guy. Why, Cooch? What's
dialog: going on?
text: Cooch stares at Ray. The younger agent looks like he indeed
text: has a fever.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: National security, Ray. Get some
dialog: sleep. Tomorrow, we fly.
text: Cooch hurries across the rain-swept street. Ray steps inside
text: and closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 13 - BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL
text: Ray closes the door, and stands there. He seems to be having
text: trouble breathing. He looks down at his boots. There is
text: something on the floor. Something that has been slipped under
text: the door earlier. He just stares down at it. Then slowly
text: stoops.
text: CLOSE ON: the polaroid of the res car he gave to Maggie
dialog: earlier. She
text: has returned it. He turns it over. Written across the white
text: backing of the photo, in dark black marker is the name --
scene_heading: YELLOW BIRD.
text: Ray stares at this for a moment then hurries over to boxes
text: of files on the bed. He rummages like a nervous thief and
text: comes up with a folder. He flips through it, casting off
text: files and 302's and profiles and finally stopping on --
text: The 8x10 BLACK AND WHITE of Richard Yellow Bird seen earlier.
text: Sitting in his wheelchair, Red Power cap on, tattoos marring
text: big arms. And under it a DOUBLE MUG SHOT stamped LEAVENWORTH
scene_heading: PRISON. Under that ANOTHER PRISON MUG SHOT stamped SIOUX
text: FALLS PRISON. And under that a --
text: THIRD MUG SHOT stamped "PAROLED."
text: Ray, his eyes fixed on this one, takes a few steps and sits
text: on the end of the bed. He then stuffs the file back in a
text: box, and takes off toward the door.
scene_heading: EXT. RESERVATION ROAD - SUNSET
text: The Le Baron throws up loose rock and red dust, driving toward
text: a place where the sun begins a slow drop behind the Black
text: Hills. HORSES run out of the road. HEARTBEAT DRUM.
scene_heading: EXT. MULE DEER DISTRICT  RES - SUNSET
text: A tarpaper shack. Outhouse. Clothesline on which jerked meat
text: hangs. No cars. A lonely, unnerving place. Le Baron pulls
text: in. Ray gets out, adjusting the gun at the back of his
text: waistband. He starts for the shack. Ray raps a fist on the
text: splintered plywood door. Knocks again. He checks out a boarded-
text: up window. The door finally opens. Just a crack. Tiny black
text: eyes peer out into the fading light.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'm looking for Richard Yellow Bird.
text: Ray sticks his open badge, gold eagle wings, near the crack.
text: The door closes. Then unlatches and opens. Yellow Bird sits
text: there in his wheelchair, tiny tobacco bundles in his lap.
text: He's been tying them.
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: The Washington Redskin. Thought you'd
dialog: be gone by now.
text: He pivots his chair to allow Ray room to enter.
scene_heading: INT. YELLOW BIRD SHACK
text: Yellow Bird, in a T-shirt that reveals twenty different ink
text: tattoos, rolls himself across the warped floorboards to a
text: cheese crate where his eye glasses sit. He puts the thick
text: bifocals on and focuses resentfully on Ray in the ochre
text: flicker of the dirty room.
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: What ya want?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Must be a bitch getting around in
dialog: that wheelchair. How long you been
dialog: in it?
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: Since I got a iron pipe put across
dialog: my knees, man. Fight with three
dialog: wasi'cus, ya know.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: At Sioux Falls Pen?
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: No, that was Leavenworth. This --
dialog: (shows a scar)
dialog: was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Leavenworth a tough joint?
text: Ray walks across the room, his eyes on a covert mission.
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: You ever try solitary confinement?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No. Can't say that I have, Richard.
dialog: Richard do you know why I'm here?
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: Washington sent ya. I know that.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yes, Washington sent me, Richard.
dialog: They sent me here because this whole
dialog: thing has been fucked. Do you know
dialog: what I mean when I say this whole
dialog: thing has been fucked, Richard?
text: Yellow Bird stares at Ray.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: An arrangement was made between you...
dialog: and us. Do you remember that
dialog: arrangement?
text: Yellow Bird looks at Ray, strangely, shaking his head. Ray
text: starts to look like maybe the game's not working. Like maybe
dialog: this doesn't add up. But --
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: I'm here, ain't I?
text: Ray lets a tense breath out.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Not for long, Richard. You got early
dialog: parole under the stipulation that
dialog: you would help us in a situation,
dialog: and you didn't deliver.
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: What the fuck you talkin' about?
text: Ray sits in a busted chair, reaches down to his ankle holster
text: and pulls out a .38. He holds it, resting it on the arm of
text: the chair. He strains to look out through the boarded window.
text: Yellow Bird fidgets in his chair.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Get up out of the chair, Richard.
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: What's with you people? Why do ya
dialog: have to fuck with my head all the
dialog: time? I came through, man.
speaker_heading: RAY
text: Get up out of the chair, and walk
text: toward the backdoor, Richard.
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: (not moving)
dialog: I get thrown in solitary until I
dialog: don't know my own fuckin' name, and
dialog: then you people tell me I can beat
dialog: nine years if I help you. I helped
dialog: you!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Get up!
text: Yellow Bird stands. He takes a step forward. Limping. He's
dialog: got leg problems but he can walk. Heels first. And bowed.
text: But he can walk. He is shaking.
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: They said I'd never see FBI again,
dialog: and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I
dialog: don't feed ya information on the
dialog: Warriors, it's back to the pen. I
dialog: don't do this, back to the pen. Your
dialog: word against my word. Against a con
dialog: Indian's word. I really got a chance,
dialog: man, right?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: They sent me here, Richard because
dialog: they said you didn't hold up your
dialog: end of the arrangement, and I have
dialog: to transport you back to Leavenworth.
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: (crying)
dialog: What the fuck, man? What do you people
dialog: want? I did what you wasi'cu's told
dialog: me to do.
speaker_heading: RAY
text: Leo Fast Elk... is alive.
text: Yellow Bird wheels.
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: No way. No fuckin' way.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: How the hell do you know?
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: I blew his back out with a buffalo
dialog: gun, that's how I know! Now you're
dialog: gonna say I didn't, so you can throw
dialog: me back in solitary?
text: Ray is trying hard not to reveal his horror at this
text: confession, at this understanding of the machinery. He sits
text: there with his gun, blinking away sweat that beads at his
text: brow. Yellow Bird is weeping in a highpitched voice that
text: doesn't match his great bulk.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: The men who came to see you at
dialog: Leavenworth. The one's who made the
dialog: arrangement... who were they? Maybe
dialog: I can talk to them.
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: Miles. Three other suits. That's all
dialog: I know 'em as -- suits. Were you
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You turned Leo over on his face. But
text: the coyotes must've turned him back
dialog: over, man, cuz his spirit is out.
text: It's out, and it knows.
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: What do you know about spirits? You
dialog: ain't no In'dn.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Leo knew something heavy and was
dialog: trying to tell Jimmy. But you must
dialog: not know how serious it was or you
dialog: would have delivered. Do you realize
dialog: what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do
dialog: you?!
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: I took him out before he got the
dialog: chance. He didn't say nothin' about
text: Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in
dialog: the dirt. Forever.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What's Tashka Sha, speak English,
dialog: speak English!
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: Red Deer Table! What's with you,
dialog: man?
text: Ray grabs onto these words, rolls them silently on his lips
text: And now Yellow Bird is getting suspicious of the fed.
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: Wait a minute. Wait -- what are you
dialog: doin'? You ain't a FBI. You ain't
dialog: the law. Let me see your --
text: Ray snaps out his gun, straight-armed.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'm the fucking law!
text: Yellow Bird jumps back, raising his hands.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: All I know... is I did what I did...
dialog: and I ain't in solitary, gettin'
dialog: pumped up with downer, gettin' beat
dialog: to shit. But I tell you what, Suit.
dialog: Take me back. Cuz I can't take this
dialog: shit no more.
text: And then HEADLIGHTS pierce the gaps in the boarded windows.
text: Yellow Bird collapses against the wall, bangs his head off
text: it. He lets a long, pained, cry escape from under his breath
text: and he begins a slow slide down the wall, to the floor.
text: Ray peers out the cracks in the boards.
speaker_heading: YELLOW BIRD
dialog: Man, I don't know who the fuck I am
dialog: no more.
text: Ray gets up, putting his gun away and heading to the door.
text: He stops and looks back at the Indian, sitting on the floor,
text: clutching his knees, staring into the kerosene flicker.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You and me both.
text: Yellow Bird looks at him, his glasses foggy, his face
text: contorted And Ray leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. YELLOW BIRD'S SHACK - NIGHT
text: Ray steps out into the falling night. There is a car parked
text: there. With a high aerial. Ray raises a hand in a slight
text: wave, walks on. At the fed car, A REGIONAL AGENT behind the
text: wheel, waves a hand. Watches Ray get into the Le Baron.
text: Ray gets in the car and takes off.
scene_heading: LE BARON - TRAVELING
text: Ray drives like a crazy man through the dark reservation.
text: Through miles of open land and strange rock formations. And
text: he looks trapped. HEADLIGHTS flicker in his rearview. He
text: sees this. Slams the gas pedal.
scene_heading: EXT. RES ROADS - NIGHT
text: The Le Baron races at 85 down the dirt stretch. A moment
text: later a car rattles by at 90.
scene_heading: INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING
text: Ray reaches over to the passenger seat and pulls up the M-
text: 16. He lays it across his lap. Looks in the rearview again.
text: Then makes a sudden sharp turn.
text: He pulls off the road quickly, throwing up dust into the
text: already foggy night, the car goes out of control.
scene_heading: EXT. WOUNDED KNEE MEMORIAL - NIGHT
text: The car that was following drives right past the narrow layby,
text: hidden by grassy slopes and keeps flying down the long
dialog: stretch.
scene_heading: INT. LE BARON
text: Ray skids through the dirt, trying to stop -- he can't --
text: and the Le Baron fishtails, smashing into a chain-link fence.
text: And coming to a stop.
text: Breathing as if he's been running not driving, Ray looks
text: behind him to make sure he lost the car. He did. When he
text: turns back to his wheel, he sees --
text: THROUGH THE CHAINLINK FENCE
text: lit by his headlights: THE WOUNDED KNEE gravesite. He is
text: right up on the arch, and the tall stone marker beyond it.
scene_heading: EXT. WOUNDED KNEE MEMORIAL - NIGHT
text: The Le Baron just sits parked, headlights making the night
text: fog crawl up from the base of the old tomb, along the fence.
text: The driver's door opens slowly. And Ray steps out. He walks
text: through the arch. Into the small fenced area. Up to the stone
text: which is overgrown with stubborn weeds, half-hidden in mist.
text: Ray studies the tomb.
scene_heading: POV: THE NAMES ON THE STONE ARE CHISELED VERTICALLY:
scene_heading: CHIEF STANDING BEAR
speaker_heading: MR. HIGH HAWK
speaker_heading: AFRAID OF BEAR
text: Weeds are grown up over the rest of the names. Ray's hands
text: clear them, grab at them and rip them away from more names:
speaker_heading: PRETTY HAWK
speaker_heading: BLUE AMERICAN
scene_heading: SHERMAN HORN CLOUD
text: With frantic abandon, Ray is ripping weeds away. He drops to
text: his knees, clearing weeds.
speaker_heading: STRONG FOX
speaker_heading: THUNDER HEART
text: MOVING DOWN and then suddenly back up to the name:
speaker_heading: THUNDER HEART
scene_heading: REVERSE ON - RAY
text: kneeling in the weeds, the wind getting restless around him,
dialog: screaming the way plains winds do but only these winds are
text: filled with a whistling. What sounds like EAGLE BONE WHISTLES,
text: piping shrill.
text: Ray kneels before the marker, staring at the name on the
text: stone, his hair thrown around by the wind that drives across
text: the grass, whistling eagles, building to an unbearable, pitch.
text: Ray stares at the name as if he is looking through a small
text: hole into another world. A world that frightens him. He gets
text: up and backs away from the stone, through the gate. And gets
text: back in his car, quickly. He takes off.
scene_heading: EXT. MAGGIE EAGLE BEAR'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The little home on the river. Dark. Empty. Ray runs up the
text: steps, pounds at the door. No answer. Pounds again.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Maggie!
text: He keeps knocking. Nothing. He hurries back down the steps,
text: starts around the back of the house and something attacks
text: him, leaps at him from the dark, knocking him off his feet,
text: into the grass. Hits him again.
text: But as quickly as he falls, he rolls, throwing up his hands
text: and blocking a savage kick aimed for his face. He traps the
text: boot, twists it and drops the attacker onto his back. In a
text: matter of seconds, he is on top of the man, sticking his gun
text: in his throat. He grabs a flashlight from his jacket and
text: shines it in the man's face.
text: Crow Horse. Breathing like a wild animal.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Five-hundred year old turtleshell
dialog: rattle...
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Crow Horse, listen --
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: You got Jimmy. Let her go.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Crow Horse, listen. You have to come
dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No. So we can do what the old man
dialog: said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We
dialog: have to go.
text: Crow Horse lies there, breathing heavy. Ray on top of him,
text: still clutching his gun.
scene_heading: INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING - NIGHT
text: Ray and Crow Horse are quiet as they eat up the dirt roads.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
text: Maybe the old man's visions are still
text: strong.
text: Ray nods, concentrating. After a time:
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Do they come in dreams, these visions?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin'
dialog: sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge.
dialog: Ya never know when.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Just before we caught Jimmy... I had
dialog: a dream that I was being chased. And
dialog: I was running with other people. Old-
dialog: fashion Indian people. I got shot in
text: the back. Like Leo.
text: When Crow Horse doesn't respond, Ray looks over and finds
text: him staring. He looks back to the road. And when he looks
text: back at Crow Horse, he is still staring at him.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Where was this?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where
dialog: I was, and that's where the dream
dialog: was. Why?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: You were running with the old ones.
text: At The Knee. Heavy duty.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Well, it was just a dream, I --
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man?
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Nothin'. Forget it.
text: Crow Horse looks out the window as if to avoid Ray who is
text: confused by the Indian's smoldering. After a moment, Crow
text: Horse looks at him.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: You had a vision. You had yourself a
text: vision. A man waits a long time for
dialog: a vision. Might go his whole lifetime
dialog: and never get one. And along comes
dialog: some instant Indian with a Mastercard
text: and brand-new shoes, has himself a
dialog: vision.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: I'm a full-blood Oglala.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: We've driven a long way. Where is
dialog: this place?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know,
dialog: just one of them, what do ya call
dialog: 'em, fitful dreams?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah. Fitful dreams.
text: Crow Horse feels better. He looks out the window, nodding.
text: But it doesn't last long.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Bullshit. You had a vision. You got
text: sign from the old ones.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What the hell do you want me to do?!
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Stop.
text: Ray brakes. Crow Horse is looking past him. Ray turns. The
dialog: spectacular mesa that we have admired with every sunrise,
text: looms massive now that we are under it. Moonlight falls on
text: it. And the HEARTBEAT DRUM pulses from it.
scene_heading: EXT. WHERE-THE-ELK-PEOPLE-USED-TO-LIVE - NIGHT
text: The land behind Red Deer Table is Badlands. Badlands pierced
text: by a few rutted old wagon roads. At a place between two
text: grotesque buttes, Crow Horse stops, looking uneasy.
text: He digs into his pocket, pulls out some loose tobacco and
text: spills it on the ground. Then he walks on.
text: Ray observes this, starting forward, then stopping long enough
text: to fish a cigarette out from his pocket and drop it next to
text: Crow Horse's offering.
text: THROUGH THE BADLANDS
text: Ray and Crow Horse walk, carefully under a full moon, scanning
text: the area. Crow Horse stops, checks out some tracks. Ray walks
text: on, looking up at the table. He shines his flashlight up and
dialog: it illuminates --
text: A RED RIBBON, tied on stakes on a ridge. Ten stakes. Twenty
text: stakes. Ribbons blowing in the wind.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
text: Ray sweeps the light along, walking faster, and then something
text: frightening occurs. Something... some unseen thing snags him
text: by the leg, sucking him into the Earth with a horrible GUSHING
speaker_heading: SOUND.
text: Ray is drawn into a hole up to his hips, a bluish-black slime,
text: oozing out around him. Crow Horse grabs him, struggling to
text: pull him up. He does, stumbling back and stepping into a
dialog: hole himself.
text: The two men are wheeling, throwing flashlight beams around,
text: slapping through a wet jelly, and finally getting their
dialog: bearings.
text: Ray touches the ground where a blue-black chemical solution
text: oozes out with water from the aquifer below. His flashlight
dialog: scans --
text: TWENTY DRILLED HOLES IN THE EARTH. A uranium strip-mining
text: grid laid out in a 50 x 60 pattern. The far side is fenced
text: by flagged stakes.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Jesus. Oil?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
text: Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came
dialog: in from the Nebraska side, and did
dialog: some shotgun testin'. They're gettin'
dialog: ready to suck this baby dry.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: 1868...
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: That's what we're doing here. National
dialog: interest. National security. Only
text: this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: We're standin' on broken treaty
dialog: ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to
dialog: be here. It'll poison the water.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Leo knew about it. Tried to tell
dialog: Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: So they took care of Leo.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Listen to the water... the river
dialog: keeps goin' down then rising again.
text: Ray goes to another hole and sticks his arm in up to the
text: elbow, sniffs the solution.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: They're drainin' our water table.
dialog: That's our life, man...
text: Ray is looking past Crow Horse at --
text: Something strange in the moonlight. COYOTES. Some forty yards
text: away, on a flat stretch of stoney ground. Six Coyotes, dancing
text: in the shadows of rock formations. MOVING IN ON THEM as Ray
text: walks forward, they circle... scatter... run back... circle
text: again. Look straight at Ray, eyes glowing.
dialog: And run.
speaker_heading: REVERSE - RAY
text: and Crow Horse walk toward them. To the place they just left.
text: A place in the dirt, they were digging up. When they reach
text: it, they stare down into the dirt.
speaker_heading: A BODY
text: lies there, face down. Denim jacket and a shock of black
text: hair, thrown into tangles and dirt. It was buried. Until the
text: coyote caught wind. Crow Horse bends down, touches the
text: jacket... turns the body over And almost vomits when he sees
dialog: Maggie Eagle Bear.
speaker_heading: RAY
text: looks down in disbelief.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No. No...
text: Ray steps back, his boots squishing in solution and sealant
text: and soiled water. He covers his mouth, stopping himself from
text: getting sick. And then he explodes, YELLING.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - RED DEER TABLE
text: in the moonlight. And RAY'S YELLING ECHOING up out of the
dialog: rocks
scene_heading: EXT. BEAR CREEK VILLAGE - NIGHT
text: The sordid little village the feds first drove through sits
text: sleepy on the rim of sunrise.
text: A DOG BARKS hollow as the Crow Horse motorcycle chutters
text: down and coasts up in front of one of the little homes --
dialog: rundown but it has a satellite dish and a decent car like so
text: many. The Le Baron pulls up behind it.
scene_heading: INT. LE BARON - NIGHT
text: Crow Horse walks over to Ray's window, his jeans and boots
text: muddy. No one speaks for a long moment, the night filled by
text: crickets. And that one dog.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: This Clear Moon's house?
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Yeah. It's time to beat the drum.
dialog: You better wait here. He don't trust
dialog: the white man.
text: Crow Horse crosses the street. Ray sits there, and he looks
text: almost hurt by this statement. But he is the white man. But
text: he is Indian. He lets a long breath escape, rubs at a temple.
text: He takes out a smoke. Tries to light it. His hands are shaking
text: too badly. But he gets it lit, and sits tense, looking in
text: his rearview.
scene_heading: INT. CLEAR MOON HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Oliver Clear Moon sits in a chair, his strong Indian mouth,
text: beginning to tighten at the jowls.
text: Across from him, Crow Horse sits on the edge of a couch.
text: MRS. CLEAR MOON, a rotund, gentle woman brings him a coffee.
text: A TEENAGE GIRL in a men's extra-large T-shirt stands in the
text: hall, looking at him.
text: Clear Moon in pajamas, rises, and with a coffee in hand,
text: starts walking in slow steps toward the kitchen. He loses
text: control before he gets there and hurls the cup across the
text: room into the sink, smashing it. He wheels and faces Crow
text: Horse. He SPEAKS LAKOTA. Asking questions. Crow Horse SPEAKS
text: LAKOTA. Answering him.
text: Mrs. Clear Moon, understanding, shakes her head in disbelief
text: and her eyes begin to well. Oliver, walking back to his chair,
text: sits, and thinks for a moment. MORE LAKOTA. He gets up, goes
text: to a drawer and rummages. He sits again, and tosses something
text: onto the coffee table. It is a badge. A tribal police badge.
scene_heading: INT. LE BARON - PARKED - CLEAR MOON'S - DAWN
text: Ray nervously awaits Crow Horse's words as he appears at the
text: window again. The Indian shows hope in his tired eyes.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's
dialog: callin' council fire. All the old
dialog: chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta
dialog: be at Grandpa's place in two hours.
dialog: We need to get the tribe together.
dialog: We need to block this thing.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What we need... is Richard Yellow
dialog: Bird.
text: Crow Horse looks at Ray who stares dead ahead.
scene_heading: EXT. YELLOW BIRD'S SHACK - RES - DAWN
text: The shack is just as Ray left it earlier, kerosene flickers
text: dancing yellow through the gapped boards. Ray and Crow Horse
text: with guns drawn, approach the front door.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: I thought it was a rare case of a
text: brother getting a break in the courts.
dialog: We did an honorin' song for him and
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: He's looking at a few hundred years
dialog: in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come
text: out without a fight.
text: Crow Horse snakes around toward the rear of the shack.
text: Ray knocks at the front door. It is unlatched and it creaks
text: open a little. Ray pushes it open and sees --
scene_heading: INT. YELLOW BIRD SHACK
text: An empty wheelchair.
scene_heading: EXT. YELLOW BIRD SHACK
text: Ray steps away from the door, looking around the vast plains
text: as the sun comes up out of the Black Hills. He is roadblocked,
text: and it shows in his eyes. It's all getting too big.
text: Crow Horse leans against the shack, watching Ray. And then
text: RADIO STATIC from inside the Le Baron. Ray pivots and stares
text: at it as if someone is inside the car. His call signal is
text: being paged. But he just stands there, looking at it.
speaker_heading: RADIO
text: X21. Read. X21...
text: Ray reaches inside the car and lifts the handset. He takes a
text: breath before pressing it to his lips.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: X21. Come back.
speaker_heading: RADIO
dialog: Ray. What's your 20?
text: Ray looks at Crow Horse who looks equally spooked. The agent
text: clears his throat.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Reservation.
text: A long, unnerving pause. No response from the other side.
speaker_heading: RADIO
dialog: What are you doing on the reservation?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'm on my way back in. Over.
text: Ray holds the handset down at his side, looking over the top
text: of the car toward the Black Hills.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man.
dialog: Ray...
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You go to the council fire. I'm going
dialog: back in.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Ray.
text: Ray swings in behind the wheel, starts the car, and barrels
text: off recklessly down the rutted road, leaving Crow Horse
dialog: behind.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Ray!
text: The Le Baron is already out to where sight reaches farther
text: than sound and silent white dust mushrooms skyward.
scene_heading: EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - MORNING
text: A RAVEN is sentinel on a telephone wire that crosses the
text: road from the bar to motel. A few trucks remain parked in
text: front of the joint.
text: Ray approaches room 13, looking shell-shocked. His boots
text: leave blue mud prints all the way to the door. He unlocks
dialog: it.
scene_heading: INT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - ROOM
text: Ray has cast off his field clothes and is halfway into one
text: of his cleaner suits. He looks haggard but still buoyant,
text: his eyes piercing. The connecting door creaks open and Cooch
text: walks in. The SAC is freshly showered and he is fidgeting
text: with a Windsor knot. He studies his number two man, says
text: nothing for a moment but is obviously holding something down.
text: His face is a red hue.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: (extra casual)
dialog: Couldn't sleep, Ray?
text: Ray looks at Cooch. When he speaks, his voice is dry.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No...
text: Cooch crosses the room, and picks up Ray's jeans which look
text: like they went through a sandlot tackle match in a mud hole.
text: Ray tucks his clean shirt in; watching Cooch.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I had to finish something with Crow
dialog: Horse.
text: Cooch walks up to Ray slowly and takes his face in his hand,
text: turning it toward lamp light to study the bruise along his
text: left eye, a residual from a Crow Horse hook.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: That's where you were. You had to go
dialog: back and have it out with the Indian
dialog: law...
text: Ray nods, and Cooch slowly breaks a smile. An insecure smile
text: but a smile just the same. He starts to laugh.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: You fucking hot head, we can get in
dialog: trouble for that.
text: Cooch laughs in amusement and Ray's face crinkles into a
text: grin as he lowers his eyes, wiping a paper towel over his
text: face. And then, suddenly, Ray lunges at Cooch.
text: He slams the Agent in Charge against the hollow wall, and
text: holds him there. His eyes wild.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Why didn't you tell me what we were
dialog: doing here?
text: Cooch is stunned.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: We're running a cover-up and you
dialog: didn't --
text: Cooch suddenly explodes, throwing Ray off of him and sending
text: him reeling back against the sink. He points a finger at his
dialog: charge.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: You ever put your hands on me again
dialog: and you'll be doing the books for a
dialog: baitshop in the fucking Everglades,
dialog: Mister.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You didn't tell me about Red Deer
dialog: Table --
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: -- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What is it? It's genocide, that's
dialog: what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some
dialog: U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for
dialog: the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
text: Cooch's eyes go frighteningly cold. He can't believe what
text: he's hearing.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Jesus Christ. What are you doing?
dialog: What the hell were you doing out
dialog: there?
text: Ray says nothing. He just stands there, against the sink,
text: breathing like a fighter against the turnbuckle.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: This was a Selective Operations Unit,
dialog: Agent Levoi. There is classified
dialog: information pertaining to our national
dialog: security. You don't question that,
dialog: you don't go digging into that shit --
dialog: that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: -- if they mine uranium there, these
dialog: people will have no place left to
dialog: go...
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: We were sworn in on the Constitution
dialog: to protect federal matters, Ray. I
dialog: don't know about uranium, I don't
dialog: know about Red Dog Table -- all I
dialog: know is we did our job. It's over.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: We neutralized anybody with a voice.
dialog: Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who
text: was standing in the way of the land.
dialog: Is that it?
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: No. We neutralized enemies of the
dialog: United States. Anti-American radicals
dialog: who have killed federal officers out
dialog: here!
text: Ray turns to the sink, turns the faucet on to get some water
text: on his face. The water only trickles into the basin.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Jesus, Ray. You think I don't like
dialog: the Indians? Not true. These were
text: noble people but their day is gone.
dialog: They're a conquered nation. They
dialog: want all of America back but they
dialog: can't even keep the garbage out of
dialog: their own front yards. It's sad,
dialog: Ray. But it's just the way it is. We
dialog: have to function as a colonial police
dialog: force out here.
text: Ray leans on the sink, watching the water start to spurt
text: free. He shuts it off. Turns to look at Cooch. And it is
text: then the door opens -- some knocking after the door is already
text: opened -- and SA Miles enters.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You gentlemen ready -- hi, Ray.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Yeah, we're ready.
text: Ray doesn't turn from the sink.
scene_heading: EXT. RESERVATION ROAD - TOWARD GRANDPA REACHES - MORNING
text: Crow Horse chugs along on his motorbike toward the council,
text: his long hair and eagle feather trailing in the wind.
scene_heading: EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - MORNING
text: Two federal vehicles are waiting in front of Cooch's Chevy
text: and Ray's Le Baron. One is an FBI van where Sherman helps
text: THREE AGENTS load file boxes and computers.
text: Cooch walks with Ray toward the Le Baron, looking at him as
text: the go. Ray looks better as he breathes the morning air. As
text: they pass the second fed car, the back window power glides
text: down, and someone looks out with a friendly smile.
speaker_heading: CLEAR MOON
dialog: Ah, there you are. The Sioux.
text: Ray stops dead. Beholds the Tribal President who wears a
text: western cut jacket and a strained expression behind his smile.
text: He hole a hand out to Ray.
speaker_heading: CLEAR MOON
dialog: You got the troublemakers off our
dialog: land. Good, Was-te.
text: Ray stares at him, speechless. Horrified. What is he doing
text: here? What about the council fire? Ray somehow nods. Then
text: walks on to the Le Baron. Cooch gets behind the wheel of the
text: car that Clear Moon sits in. Clear Moon's eyes follow Ray to
dialog: the car.
scene_heading: EXT. RES ROAD - TO GRANDPA REACHES
text: Crow Horse guns past a little shack. As he does, he looks in
text: his side mirror then out across the grasslands. Then quickly
text: IN HIS MIRROR: a car has pulled out from behind the shack.
text: CROW HORSE observes this. Then twists the fuel throttle hard.
scene_heading: INT. LE BARON
text: Ray gets behind the wheel, looks at his watch. He is
text: panicking. He starts the car, reverses, slams into drive.
text: RAYS POV: swerving and reckless as he races forward. Sherman,
text: walking around to one of the cars has to run out of the way.
text: The other agents clear out, looking in confusion as Ray cuts
text: a hard U -- sweeps PAST THE BAR, SMASHES INTO AND THROUGH
text: the old hitching post -- and HEADS TOWARD the reservation
text: which lies vast before him.
scene_heading: EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL
text: With agents scrambling about, looking after the car, Cooch
text: gets out, looking into the dust Ray left behind. HEARTBEAT
speaker_heading: DRUM.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: RAY!
text: Sherman appears beside Cooch aiming a questioning look. When
text: Cooch quickly gets back behind the wheel, Sherman pulls his
text: radio up and starts yelling into it.
text: Cooch reaches out the window and grabs his radio arm.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: No, damn it. You call teams in and
dialog: this is gonna be a fucking media
dialog: event. Get me three cars, six agents,
dialog: block all reservation exits. It's
text: under control.
text: And Cooch squeals out with a petrified Clear Moon in the
text: backseat, inquiring nervously.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD TO GRANDPA REACHES
text: Crow Horse passes by an abandoned horse trailer. When he
text: does, another car pulls out. And follows. The first car passes
dialog: by.
text: Crow Horse sees he's being followed. He cranks his throttle
text: and the engine grinds then dies. He heels his kickstart on
text: the fly, and keeps it alive. But his old horse is no match
text: for the big engines coming up fast behind him.
scene_heading: INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING
text: Ray is leaving little transitional developments and trailers
text: behind. His eyes bore into the road before him, looking for
text: a sign of Crow Horse, and in the rearview for a sign of his
dialog: FBI mentor.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD TO GRANDPA REACHES - BADLANDS
text: Crow Horse has the throttle open. But the two cars are coming
text: up on both sides, trying to sandwich him. To his right the
text: Badlands loom deep, a drop into a caliche netherworld of
text: jagged rock.
text: He throws the bike right, trying to ride the thin ribbon of
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: THE FIRST CAR
text: floors it, and swipes him, and the bike goes over the edge,
dialog: launched into --
speaker_heading: THE BADLANDS
text: where it does a violent triple flip, throwing Crow Horse
text: then smashing into a tent shaped dune.
speaker_heading: A RIFLE
text: sticks out from a window and punches the Badlands with THREE
speaker_heading: SHOTS.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD TO GRANDPA REACHES
text: The Le Baron rifles past the abandoned horse trailer. Black
text: smoke drifts in a wind ahead.
text: Ray veers onto the shoulder, barely gets the car in park
text: before bailing and running wildly down into the Badlands.
scene_heading: EXT. BADLANDS
text: Ray runs, stumbles through the rock and gypsum, searching
text: the area. He runs around the burning motorcycle, looking
text: left and right.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Crow Horse!
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
text: lies on his back in the Badlands, eyes open, fixed unmoving
text: on the sky. Ray comes out of the flame-waves, running with
text: his .45 held high. He throws himself to his knees beside the
text: injured Indian.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Crow Horse!
text: Crow Horse rolls his eyes toward the FBI agent. He has a
text: gash behind his ear, and pink sand clings to the blood. He
text: lifts his head, tries to form words.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear
dialog: Moon...
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I know. Come on. We gotta get off

speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Bullshit, let's get outta here,
text: Ray gets an arm under the big Indian, helps him up out of a
text: jagged crevice.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Grandpa...
scene_heading: EXT. RESERVATION ROAD
text: Cooch's car speeds down the stretch. Followed by Sherman's.
text: The FBI van. All at one-hundred and five. Gravel and dirt
dialog: flies.
scene_heading: INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING
text: With Crow Horse half-passed out in the passenger seat, Ray
text: keeps the wheel steady. And then his RADIO STATICS.
speaker_heading: RADIO
scene_heading: X21, please read. Ray. Ray. X21,
dialog: please read. This is Cooch. Please
dialog: come in, Ray. Where are you?
text: Ray just stares down at the radio, keeps the pedal floored.
text: The throws the wheel left.
scene_heading: EXT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER
text: The Le Baron fish-tails in a cloud of dust and Ray leaps out
text: of the car, runs toward the little trailer, gun in hand. The
text: windows are all busted, and the door is wide open. Ray runs
text: in. Then straight back out, shaking his head to Crow Horse.
text: Crow Horse hangs his head out the passenger window.
speaker_heading: RAY
text: He's gone.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: He hasn't left this place in twenty
dialog: years. They got him.
text: Ray starts to get back in then hesitates. He looks out across
dialog: the plains to see --
text: THREE FED CARS in the distance, fast approaching, dust rising.
text: Ray gets in quickly.
scene_heading: EXT. RESERVATION EXIT
text: Cooch's car is parked in a roadblock. Clear Moon stands near
text: him, and addresses UNIFORMED TRIBAL POLICE as they spill out
text: from a van, carrying rifles and shotguns.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: X21. Ray. Ray, please come in.
text: Cooch has torn his tie away, his shirt is open, and he is
text: sweat soaked. Miles gets out of a car that pulls up.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: We have a renegade agent, Cooch? He
dialog: gets off the reservation...
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: -- he's not getting off the
dialog: reservation.
text: And Cooch gets back in the car, drives off.
scene_heading: INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING
text: With Ray driving like a maniac, Crow Horse is turned around
text: in his seat, watching the federal cars spreading out, the
text: chopper moving in.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: They got us sealed. What are we gonna
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: We're going for The Stronghold.
text: Crow Horse looks at him.
speaker_heading: RADIO
dialog: (Cooch)
dialog: Ray. Can you hear me? You are fucked.
dialog: There's no way out of this. If you
dialog: won't listen to your own laws, then
dialog: listen to this:
dialog: (static: a new voice)
dialog: This is President Clear Moon. This
dialog: nation does not want your sympathy.
dialog: You cannot use this reservation as a
dialog: sanctuary. Stop where you are now.
text: Ray and Crow Horse exchange a look.
speaker_heading: RADIO
dialog: (Cooch)
dialog: Whatever you are trying to do is
dialog: futile, Raymond. You have nothing.
dialog: Nothing.
text: Ray picks up the mic as he cranes to keep an eye on the
text: rearview.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
speaker_heading: RADIO
dialog: (Cooch)
dialog: Yellow Bird committed suicide at
dialog: three o'clock this morning. Some
text: gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him
dialog: into a corner. You're playing a losing
text: game. Pull over.
text: Ray takes the mic and for some reason, he's putting it inside
text: his jacket near his shoulder where he keeps his leather.
text: Crow Horse looks at him, puzzled. And then the sound comes
text: forth, the static crackling of a micro-cassette recorder.
speaker_heading: RECORDER
dialog: (Ray)
dialog: How the hell do you know?
dialog: (Yellow Bird)
dialog: I blew his back out with a buffalo
dialog: gun, that's how I know. And now you're
dialog: gonna say I didn't and put me back
dialog: in solitary?!
text: Ray keeps the tape running into the radio as he drives through
text: rugged Badlands. Crow Horse, stunned by the voice, eyes Ray
text: as the tape rolls.
scene_heading: INT. CHEVY - TRAVELING
text: Cooch and Clear Moon stare in horror at the radio.
speaker_heading: RADIO
dialog: (Yellow Bird)
dialog: You people tol' me I could beat nine
dialog: years if I helped you. I helped you!
dialog: (rewinding)
dialog: I could beat nine years if I helped
dialog: you. I helped you!
text: Cooch is shaking his head in vitrified disbelief. He slams
text: the pedal almost through the floor.
scene_heading: INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING
text: The tape ends and Ray now lifts the mic to his mouth.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (into mic)
dialog: Fuck you.
text: And he too, buries the accelerator.
text: EXT. BADLANDS ROAD  TO THE STRONGHOLD
text: The Le Baron burns forward and we SWEEP UP TO A MIND-BLOWING
text: AERIAL VIEW of the Badlands as four fed cars spread out in
text: formation, following.
scene_heading: INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING
text: Crow Horse is turned around, looking at the pursuit.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Walter.
text: Crow Horse turns, sees what Ray is looking at.
text: POV: The Stronghold -- a narrow opening in hulking rock
text: formations. Large enough for a car to get in, and keep
dialog: followers out.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: That's it. The Stronghold. Get us in
dialog: there, we got a chance.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: We're in there. We're in there --
text: just ahead, the earth is gone. A wavering heat pond turns
text: out to be a crevice and they nose down into it, burying the
text: front end in sand and rock. WINDSHIELD SHATTERS.
scene_heading: EXT. THE STRONGHOLD
text: The Le Baron is stuck, wheels spinning out. Ray and Cooch
text: bail. Guns drawn, they start running for the Stronghold.
text: AT THE EDGE OF THE ARROYO
text: the caravan slides in recklessly, two of the fed cars coming
text: dangerously close to going over the edge. The regional
text: officers and six Clear Moon goons empty out, running down
text: the dip, rifles and shotguns ready.
text: Three more field agents come down from another direction,
text: followed by Cooch. Sherman hands a bullhorn to him.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: (via bullhorn)
scene_heading: FREEZE! NOW!
text: The sound of FIFTEEN PRIMING FIREARMS stops Ray and Crow
text: Horse in their tracks. Just twenty feet from The Stronghold.
text: Crow Horse, windless, stumbles to a knee. Ray turns slowly,
text: facing the small army.
speaker_heading: COOCH
speaker_heading: DROP IT.
text: Crow Horse, rises, sucking wind, and ditches his gun in the
text: Badlands. Ray holds onto his .45 a moment longer. Then drops
text: it. He stares at --
speaker_heading: THE WALL OF MEN
text: Cooch, SA Miles, SA Sherman, Six regional officers, six Clear
text: Moon goons. And now, coming out of the backseat of Cooch's
text: Chevy, Oliver Clear Moon, walking tentatively, cautiously.
text: Cooch lowers the bullhorn. He takes the opportunity to stare
text: at Ray. To let Ray stare at him. The older agent looks broken.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Crow Horse, get your face in the
dialog: dirt. Ray... come forward. Let it
dialog: go. Let's just let it go...
text: AT THE STRONGHOLD ENTRANCE
text: Crow Horse lowers himself to a knee then lies face down. Ray
text: just stands there, the wind against him.
speaker_heading: COOCH (O.S.)
dialog: Come on, Ray. Come forward.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No way, Cooch.
text: Ray refuses to move.
speaker_heading: COOCH
text: sweating, tries to keep control. All around him, hands are
text: on guns. Cooch is walking toward Ray.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Ray. I'm coming to talk to you. I'm
dialog: gonna walk you out of here. And we're
dialog: gonna get the hell outta this place.
text: Cooch walks toward him, a gun hanging at one side, bullhorn
text: at the other. The agents behind him, around him, all raise
text: rifles, all take aim.
text: Sherman, looking sick, gets to a knee and sets aim. The sound
text: of clacking steel, all around. But Cooch seems disturbed by
text: the sound. Because its coming from above. He raises an eye
dialog: from the rifle sight to see --
text: ALONG THE EDGE OF THE BUTTE
text: FIFTEEN INDIANS, training rifles and shotguns down below.
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
text: looks up from his rifle, bewildered. Then alarmed.
text: ALONG THE EDGE OF THE BUTTE
text: We PAN across fifteen Indians -- old people, women, kids.
text: Their weapons are weak but many.
text: And at the end of the row, Maisy Blue Legs rises, clutching
text: a rifle. And PAST HER, ANOTHER. TRADITIONAL PEOPLE, many
text: from the trading post porch, rise to the edge, armed. Silent.
text: Twenty, twenty-five, thirty traditionals, forming a line
text: along the ridge, a line that runs in a circle, broken by the
text: Stronghold entrance, then starting again on the next butte.
text: Thirty-five, forty of them. And more, standing along the
text: opposite craggy rock, some wearing tractor caps, some cowboy
text: hats, some just long hair blowing in the wind. Fifty, sixty,
text: SEVENTY-FIVE RESERVATION PEOPLE forming a circle on the rocks;
text: it's Little Big Horn revisited. A fourteen year-old boy
text: struggles to keep a huge shotgun at his shoulder.
speaker_heading: DOWN BELOW
text: Clear Moon's mouth is as dry as Badlands soil. Cooch is
text: panicking, his eyes running along the high edge.
speaker_heading: RAY
text: stands equally astonished, assessing the back-up.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
text: lifts himself, stands, taking in the sight.
text: AT THE EDGE OF THE BUTTE
text: stepping stiffly but steadily through the line of armed
text: locals, pushing his way to the very edge so as to look down,
text: Grandpa Sam Reaches. The wind makes feathery tails out of
text: his long thinning strips of white hair.
speaker_heading: DOWN BELOW
text: Ray looks up at the old man, then turns to face Cooch.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You're right, Cooch. It's over.
text: Cooch slowly, lets the bullhorn fall. Then the rifle. He
text: looks back at Sherman who does the same, and all the way
text: down the line, everyone dropping their arms under the threat
text: of a lot more guns from above. And now Ray walks forward,
text: collecting his gun. Anderson Chasing Hawk, one of the
text: Warriors, runs down to Ray, breathless.
speaker_heading: CHASING HAWK
text: All the exits are blocked. There's
text: two more fed cars tryin' to get in.
dialog: And some press.
text: Ray notices that Cooch is staring at him, hard. He shakes
text: his head slowly. Strongly.
speaker_heading: COOCH
dialog: Ray...
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Let the press through.
text: Chasing Hawk takes off, running, and Cooch watches in
text: consternation. Ray just stands eye to eye with him, holding
dialog: his ground.
scene_heading: UP TO ARIEL VIEW - OVER STRONGHOLD
text: And along the ridge, Grandpa and the locals don't budge,
text: watching every move.
text: CLIMBING HIGHER, we rise above the circle of proud Sioux to
text: see, on the inside of the Stronghold, thirty old trucks and
dialog: res cars.
text: CLIMBING HIGHER into and through the fast-moving clouds that
text: the Lakota call The Grandfathers as the HEARTBEAT DRUM and
text: LAKOTA SINGERS takes over all sound.
scene_heading: SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BEAR CREEK RESERVATION - MAIN SETTLEMENT - LATER
text: The HIGH WINDS of THREE MEDIA HELICOPTERS are delighting a
text: storm of Indian children and BARKING DOGS, running through
text: the streets past junked cars on blocks.
text: Over on a little plot of grass and dirt, a pair of hands are
text: digging a small hole. Ray lays a pine cone in the hole and
text: looks down at it for a moment... before hand-plowing the
text: dirt back over it and patting it flat. He rises, knocking
text: dirt off his knees and hands.
text: Crow Horse walks over, bandaged and favoring wounds, and Ray
text: falls in with him, walking down the middle of the village
text: road. His eyes are tired. But hopeful.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: The people are already talkin' about
dialog: their vote for a new tribal prez.
dialog: They wanna vote for Jimmy.
text: Ray nods, encouraged as they walk along. His eyes follow the
dialog: helicopters.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What about the water...
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: You bought her some time, Kola. Ain't
dialog: never gonna be over... but you bought
dialog: her some time.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Some Indian time?
text: They reach the dusty, dented Le Baron and stand there, looking
text: at each other.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Indian time.
text: Crow Horse offers a hand to Ray. He takes it in a white man's
text: shake then follows Walter's cue into the Indian "allies"
text: grip and slap. They hold it there, looking into each other's
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: Where ya gonna go, Ray?
text: Ray ponders for a moment.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'll have to see what the visions
dialog: say about that one.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: You didn't have another vision...
text: Ray shrugs. Crow Horse discreetly gestures below his belt.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Yeah, right here.
text: Ray cracks a smile, a long time coming.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You take care.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: If you ever need a place to come
text: back to and listen to the trees a
dialog: little... we'll be here.
text: Ray stands looking at him, searching for words.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE
dialog: Ain't no word in Sioux for goodbye.
text: Ray goes to get in his car. But he sees someone sitting across
text: the street on the trading post porch. The old man.
text: Ray considers him for a moment then walks over. They lock
text: eyes. Grandpa stares at Ray as if he's never seen him before,
text: and then arcs a brow. He touches his sleeve at the wrist.
text: Ray rolls his sleeve back to reveal his Rolex. Grandpa smiles
text: and Ray strips it off. He hands it to the old man and his
text: face crinkles into caliche earth.
text: Grandpa holds the watch up in the light, admires it then
text: puts it in his shirt pocket. He moves a flat hand through
text: the air in the "done deal" sign language. Ray, a little
text: surprised that he gets nothing in the trade, returns the
text: smile and walks away.
text: He gets to his car and wipes away two inches of dust from
text: the broken windshield.
scene_heading: INT. LE BARON
text: After THREE TRIES, he gets the engine started. He pulls his
text: gun off his waistband, goes to lay it on the passenger seat
text: and finds something there.
text: Grandpa's sacred caanunpa. The Pipe. Symbol of truth. Ray
text: looks out the window at the old man who is watching him with
text: those sharp black eyes. Ray lifts his hand, holds it flat,
dialog: and does the Sioux done deal sign.
scene_heading: EXT. BEAR CREEK RESERVATION - DAY
text: The Le Baron eats up the dirt road at a moderate, gravel
text: crunching pace. It slows as it passes Maggie Eagle Bear's
text: quiet home on the river. Children walk with the old woman,
text: carrying buckets from the river.
text: The Le Baron slows to a crawl, then drives on.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: THE TRADING POST PORCH
text: where the elders sit, watching the dust blow.
speaker_heading: CROW HORSE (V.O.)
dialog: (voice lingering)
dialog: We will be here.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CROW HORSE walking off down the road. He stops, and looks
text: over his shoulder, trying to glimpse the distance.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: THE LE BARON driving off the res, under big sky as it ascends
text: a rough hill, waddles through potholes, negotiates with some
text: horses in the road and rolls on toward the reservation line
text: where the sun throws shadows that look like an old man
dialog: dancing.
text: AT THE PLACE IN THE ROAD
text: where West goes to Rapid City, and East back to Bear Creek,
text: Ray stops like the bullet-punched sign orders. He doesn't go
text: West. Doesn't go East. He sits there. Fishes a smoke out
text: from a pocket, clicks a lighter, and fires up. He sits there,
dialog: smoking.
text: Deliberating.
text: SUDDEN CUT TO BLACK.
text: And after a long silent beat, A DRUM. Like a heart.
