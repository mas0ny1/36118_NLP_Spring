dialog: Deep Impact
speaker_heading: SPACE
text: Deep, dark. Stars, distant planets, silence. The universe
text: spreading out before us in all of it's terrifying mystery.
text: Inviting, seductive. The dark edge of an infinite lethal
dialog: precipice daring us to jump.
text: It BLURS. OUT OF FOCUS. And back. Brilliant, SHARP. The
text: soft CLICK of a SHUTTER. It hangs open for an eternity.
text: Then, CLOSES. The WHINE of film advancing. We're ina --
scene_heading: STATE PARK IN VIRGINIA - NIGHT
text: With a pretty girl, SARAH, no more than fourteen, taking
text: photos of the night sky through her small telescope. She's
text: surrounded by a dozen other telescopes, three or four feet
text: long, reflectors and refractors.
text: TEENAGERS, a few adults, all take pictures of the night
text: sky using cameras attached to their telescopes. The
text: SHUTTERS open, close. The camera motors ADVANCE.
text: The teacher, MR. PERRY, supervises.
speaker_heading: WE MOVE TO:
text: LEO BIEDERMAN, whose interest in the sky is almost equal to
dialog: his interest in Sarah.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Matt Sheperd?
text: Sarah doesn't look up from her telescope.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: He asked me. It's just a party.
dialog: He's nice.
speaker_heading: LEO

speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: And the one next to it?
speaker_heading: LEO

speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: And the one next to that?
text: Leo stares through the telescope, hesitates. Finally...
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It's Megrez.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: No it's not.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You said you didn't know.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: I know where Megrez is. I'm talking
dialog: about the other thing.
text: He stands up for Perry to take a look. So does Sarah,
text: through her telescope.
speaker_heading: LEO (CONT'D)
text: South, about ten degrees.
dialog: 
text: Leo can't help but glance down as Sarah's jeans part from

speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: (eye in the viewer)
text: Probably a satellite.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Huh?
text: As Perry starts to walk away.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: (an afterthought)
dialog: Take a picture and send it to Dr.

text: Leo looks through his telescope at this distant light,

text: A huge telescope swings slowly into place beneath a crystal
text: clear night sky.
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSED ON SCREEN, A SINGLE WORD: "SKYWATCH"
text: Silhouetted against the brilliant stars, a man, plumes of
text: white breath escaping into the bitter desert darkness,
text: MARCUS WOLF. He releases the telescope from its clamps.
text: LOOKS DOWN at the mirror as it swings into position. wolf
text: steps off, walks back to the --
scene_heading: OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: FLICKS off the white running lights as he goes, bathing
text: the scene in red. Studies the sky on a large computer (no
text: one looks through an eyepiece anymore). He picks up an
text: envelope leaning against the monitor. In it, photographs
text: of the stars and a group shot, Perry and his kids. Leo
text: and Sarah hold up a sign: LEE HIGH SCHOOL ASTRONOMY CLUB.
text: Wolf grabs a slice of congealing pizza from a picked-over
text: Domino's box, shuffles the kids' photos. Not much of
text: interest. Stops at one. A beat. Turns it over, finds
text: the scrawled coordinates indicating its location in the
text: sky. Intrigued, he walks back into --
scene_heading: THE DOME - NIGHT
dialog: Controls the telescope with the kind of simple buttons you
text: find on a hospital bed: Up, Down, Left, Right. The huge
text: motors GRIND as the telescope moves.
text: The sky changes above us as he jogs back to - -
scene_heading: THE OBSERVATION ROOM
text: The image on the monitor rotates, LOCKS into place. He
text: compares the screen to the photo. Smiles.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Hello, do I know you? ...where
dialog: are you going in such a hurry...?
text: Taps in a command, the cursor squares on one area of the
text: image, ENLARGES. He stares, enters the ascension and
dialog: declination directions and observation time. Numbers race
dialog: by, trajectories, speed. Finally...
speaker_heading: WOLF (CONT'D)
dialog: ...oh shit...
text: Drops his slice of pizza into the trash, swings around to
text: his open laptop. Double clicks on his AOL folder.

text: The modem SQUAWKS. A BUSY SIGNAL. The modem disconnects
text: then CLICKS alive again. Dials the back-up number as Wolf

scene_heading: "CAROLYN SHOEMAKER Ph.D. Department of Planetary Sciences,

speaker_heading: WOLF'S CAR - NIGHT 11
text: Wolf listens to Puccini. The Jeep speeds around the snowy

dialog: cellular phone and stay on the road.
scene_heading: TRUCK - NIGHT 12
text: Puccini collides with Garth Brooks as McCloud guzzles his

text: Wolf holds the phone down in front of him, trying to dial

scene_heading: TRUCK - NIGHT 14
text: The cigarette ash fills the screen. We know it's going to

speaker_heading: MCCLOUD
dialog: Â»..0h fuck...!
text: His hand dances wildly, searching for the hot ash.
text: A MONTAGE OF ACCELERATING IMAGES 15
text: Wolf's Jeep rounds the bend in the wrong lane. McCloud's

text: Wolf's lights BLIND him. Wolf SCREAMS. McCloud YANKS the
dialog: wheel, the semi SKIDS.
speaker_heading: MCCLOUD
dialog: ...Jesus...!
text: The collision is a ballet of destruction, the drama of two
text: bodies trying to occupy the same space at the same time.
text: The mass of the truck dominates the Jeep. The Jeep's small
text: frame has nowhere to go but back into itself. Abstractly,
text: this is sculpture, at the moment, this is death.
text: Flying glass is everywhere. The Jeep's canvas roof SHREDS
text: and flails. Its engine pushes the steering column up into
text: the cab. The semi shoves the Jeep up and through the
text: guardrail, twisting metal and wood BURSTING out into space.
text: The Jeep SURGES end over end, down the side of the mountain,
text: towards the snowy woods, a hundred yards below.
text: The MANILLA ENVELOPE WITH THE COMPUTER DISK soars out of
text: the rags that were the Jeep's roof. For a moment it lands

text: down his face. He stares through the twisted guardrail down
text: into the canyon at the burning wreckage until:
