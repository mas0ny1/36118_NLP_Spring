scene_heading: EXT. CONCOURSE VILLAGE CO-OP - DAY - FANTASY
text: A door opens and a pair of BEAT UP CONVERSE KICKS step
text: outside. They belong to NATASHA KINGSLEY, 17, beautiful, with
text: an enormous afro. The sun on her face makes her smile.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: I don’t care what anyone says...
dialog: New York’s the best city in the
dialog: world.
text: While on her phone, Natasha struts by local shops: a
text: Pakistani restaurant with a line of CAB DRIVERS out the door,
text: an Optimo cigar store, and a Taiwanese electronics store.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: It's a place where 8.5 million

scene_heading: EXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY - FANTASY
text: Passengers rush down the stairs as she climbs up to the “D”

dialog: It’s a lot to take in.
text: A train whizzes by revealing her on the platform.
scene_heading: EXT. FORT WASHINGTON - DAY - FANTASY
text: Natasha emerges from the “A” train at 175th. BEVERLY “BEV”

speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: But with a little luck you can find
dialog: a best friend.
scene_heading: EXT. THE UNITED PALACE THEATER - DAY - FANTASY

text: Natasha and Bev squeeze in as the line moves forward.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: It's a city where hard work and
dialog: determination are constants against
dialog: unknown variables in the equation
dialog: for success--
scene_heading: INT. THE UNITED PALACE THEATER - EVENING - FANTASY
text: Inside the ornate auditorium, velvet seats are filled with
text: FAMILY and FRIENDS. The STUDENTS, now dressed in graduation
text: caps and gowns, enter single file to Pomp and Circumstance.
scene_heading: INT. STAGE - EVENING - FANTASY
text: PRINCIPAL and FACULTY on stage. Natasha’s poised at the edge.
text: Like a runner in blocks. Her name is barely called when she
text: Marches across the stage to claim her diploma.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: ...And dreams can become tangible
dialog: when you reach out and grab them.
scene_heading: EXT. STATEN ISLAND BACKYARD - NIGHT - FANTASY
text: A Caribbean-American Graduation Party in full swing. Lights
text: strung from corner posts. A Jamaican flag stretched across
text: the fence. Jerk chicken and fish on the grill. Dishes with
text: curried goat, oxtails, plantains, peas and rice. ADULTS in
text: traditional garb. And TEENS on a makeshift dance floor. Find
text: Natasha and Bev in the middle. Dancing. Laughing.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: I wouldn’t have wanted this perfect
dialog: night to happen anywhere but here:
dialog: the city I’m proud to call my home.
text: On Tasha’s face, smiling as she looks at the night sky filled

scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. NATASHA’S APARTMENT - DAY - REALITY
text: A NASA STAR MAP on a wall. Pull out to reveal Tasha in a
text: small apartment, moving boxes everywhere.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: Or at least a city I used to call
dialog: my home.
dialog: 
text: Behind her, a LITTLE HAND pulls back the bright blue curtain
text: separating the room. REVEAL: PETER, 9 years old, chocolate
text: with dreadlocks and a grin from ear to ear.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
text: Unless a cataclysmic blunder is
dialog: corrected, the odds of me actually
dialog: graduating with my friends are
text: declining. Rapidly.
text: Peter whips the curtain closed, unseen.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: You see, I’m an illegal immigrant
dialog: and my family is scheduled for
dialog: deportation. Tomorrow.
text: WHOOSH - Natasha pulls back the curtain. Peter is juggling a
text: soccer ball on his knees in the next room. ZOOM in on Peter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Look, Tasha!
text: Peter fumbles with the ball. The ball gets away from him,
text: bumping into a neat stack of Natasha’s books.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: How many times do I have to tell
dialog: you not to practice in our room?!
text: Peter picks his nose and examines what he dug up.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: Ewww! Peter, stop it. You’1l never
dialog: get friends that way.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Doesn't matter. I’1l make new
dialog: friends in Jamaica!
text: Natasha sighs heavily, the weight of her family’s struggles
text: on her shoulders. A key RATTLES in the lock.
text: MRS. KINGSLEY, Natasha’s 40-ish, world-weary mother, drags in
text: from work wearing a waitress uniform.
dialog: 4.
text: She sees a kitchen full of dirty dishes. NOTE: Mr. And Mrs.
text: Kingsley both speak with a heavy Jamaican accent and dialect.
scene_heading: MRS. KINGSLEY
dialog: Tasha. How many times I’m gonna
dialog: have to tell you to clean the
dialog: dishes before I come home?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You haven’t even closed the door
dialog: yet and you're already yelling--
scene_heading: MRS. KINGSLEY
dialog: It's not enough to pick up dirty
dialog: plates at work? I come home to pick
dialog: up dirty plates too?!
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Mom, please. I’11 do it now.
text: Mrs. Kingsley heads to her bedroom. Natasha goes into the
text: kitchen, draws soapy water and washes the dishes. Mrs.
text: Kingsley emerges from the bedroom wearing a bathrobe.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: You work too much.
scene_heading: MRS. KINGSLEY
dialog: Somebody gotta keep a roof over all
dialog: our heads, child. Who else gonna do
dialog: it?
text: REVEAL: MR. KINGSLEY, late 40s, small frame, sad eyes,
text: sitting in front of the TV. We haven’t noticed him until now.
text: Mr. Kingsley watches as LAWRENCE OLIVIER performs a monologue
text: from “Othello” on screen. He studies him intently.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: My father’s an actor. At least,
dialog: that’s why he came to America. But
dialog: that’s not exactly how it’s worked
dialog: out.
text: PULL OUT: Mr. Kingsley performs the scene along with Olivier.
text: He’s in perfect sync with the actor on TV.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: It’s his fault we’re in this mess.
text: Natasha finishes the dishes. Mrs. Kingsley makes eggs.
scene_heading: MRS. KINGSLEY
dialog: You want breakfast?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I have an appointment at the
dialog: Immigration Office this morning.
text: It's at eight.
scene_heading: MRS. KINGSLEY
dialog: You don’t think it’s time for you
dialog: to give up now, Tasha? You don’t
dialog: think what you’re doing is futile?
text: Natasha grabs a piece of fruit off the table.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: There’s still time, Mommy. We have
dialog: today. And I’m going to use every
text: last second. Can’t give up yet.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Don’t think of it as giving up.
dialog: Think of it as embracing destiny.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I’d rather make my own.
text: Peter smiles, turns up Sister Nancy’s “Bam Bam” and sings
text: along. Natasha rolls her eyes. She grabs her headphones and
dialog: her Physics textbook.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (re: textbook)
dialog: We leaving, Tasha. You don’t have
dialog: to turn in homework. We’re free!
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I’ll be back later.
scene_heading: MRS. KINGSLEY
dialog: You have a lot to finish here. I
dialog: still see open boxes in your room.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Mom, I really gotta go.
text: Natasha heads for the door, determined. She takes a deep
text: breath, opens the door and steps outside.
scene_heading: EXT. ELEVATED TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY
text: Natasha stops at a specific spot on the platform and checks
text: her phone: 6:55 AM. She looks down the track-- nothing.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Ugh. Come on. Not today.
scene_heading: INT. DANIEL’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY
text: DANIEL JAE HO BAE, 17, stands in front of a mirror sizing
text: himself up in the suit he’s wearing. He adjusts his red tie,
text: clearly uncomfortable in what he’s wearing.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: Today's the day my whole life has
dialog: led up to...
text: From outside the room, his mother, MIN SOO, 40s, calls out:
speaker_heading: MIN SOO (0.S.)
dialog: (in Korean)
dialog: Daniel! I’m making you a special
dialog: breakfast. Hurry down.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: The day of my college interview for
dialog: Yale.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Coming!
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: The day that decides my future.
text: Behind him, shelves full of the world’s greatest poets:
text: Shakespeare, Shelly, Frost, Poe, Plath, Angelou, Hughes.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: Normally I’d write a two-page poem
dialog: about something of this magnitude.
dialog: At least a haiku. But today, my
text: anxiety’s holding me hostage.
text: Daniel grabs his writer’s notebook, throws it into his
text: satchel. Takes one final glance at himself.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: Because I need every brain cell
dialog: focused on nailing this interview.
text: Daniel takes one final glance at himself, then exits.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Daniel’s mother steams frozen dumplings. Daniel pours a bowl
text: of Cap’n Crunch. She shakes her head disapprovingly. Min Soo
text: speaks with a heavy Korean accent.
speaker_heading: MIN SOO
dialog: Too much sugar. You need a sharp
dialog: mind today.
text: She grabs the bowl of cereal, replaces it with a plate of
text: dumplings, and pours the dry cereal back into the box.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: I’m pretty sure I inherited my
dialog: mother’s anxiety...
scene_heading: INT. JFK AIRPORT - CUSTOMS - FLASHBACK
text: YOUNG MIN SOO and YOUNG DAE HYN, nervous and afraid, present
text: their paperwork to the CUSTOMS AGENT.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: Which started the day she uprooted
dialog: her whole life in Korea to come to
dialog: America. For most immigrants,
dialog: moving to a foreign country is an
dialog: act of faith. What if you can’t
dialog: adapt? What if you’re not welcomed?
dialog: What if you lose all sense of your
dialog: identity and culture?
scene_heading: INT. HOME - FLASHBACK - TWO YEARS LATER
text: FAMILY and FRIENDS crowd the apartment. Min Soo holds her
text: first born, CHARLIE, as ONE-YEAR-OLD DANIEL crawls toward
text: various objects: a stethoscope, pen, basketball, etc. Each
text: object represents a career or “fate.” THIS IS A KOREAN
text: DOLJANCHI or “DOL” where the child “chooses their destiny.”
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: So when my brother and I were born,
dialog: she gave us both an American name
dialog: and a Korean name. So we would know
dialog: where we were from. And where we
dialog: were going.
text: The family cheers as Young Daniel nears the stethoscope, then
text: grabs the PEN instead to his parents’ dismay.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - PRESENT
text: Min Soo interrogates her son between his bites of breakfast.
speaker_heading: MIN SOO
dialog: How’s your grade in math? You don’t
dialog: like math.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: B plus. But the rest are A’s.
speaker_heading: MIN SOO
dialog: Why no A in math yet, Daniel? Aigo!
dialog: It's time you get serious...
dialog: (then, in Korean)
dialog: Don’t be like your brother.
text: Right as she says this, Daniel’s brother, CHARLIE, 19, walks
text: into the kitchen. Pretends he doesn’t hear this, but his
text: resentful demeanor gives him away.
speaker_heading: MIN SOO (CONT'D)
dialog: I made mandu.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Awww. Daniel’s “special breakfast.”
dialog: I‘ll pass.
text: Charlie strokes Daniel’s hair. Daniel slaps his hand away.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: My brother, Charlie, is an asshole.
text: Charlie grabs the box of Cap’n Crunch, then pours cereal and
text: milk into a bowl and sits. He chomps loudly with each bite.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: He’s been at home the past semester
dialog: because he failed too many classes
dialog: at BU. An epic screw up that my
dialog: parents can’t accept.
speaker_heading: MIN SOO
dialog: Close your mouth when you eat.
text: Charlie ignores her then SLURPS the remaining milk from the
text: bowl. He stands, looks down at Daniel.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Good luck with your day, little
dialog: brother.
text: Charlie tries to touch Daniel’s hair again and is batted
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT’D)
dialog: Wouldn’t want to disappoint Mommy
dialog: and Daddy if you don’t get into an
dialog: Ivy.
text: Charlie exits, leaving his dirty bowl on the table.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: I should hate Charlie, but these
dialog: days, I mostly feel sorry for him.
speaker_heading: MIN SOO
dialog: I just don’t understand what
dialog: happened to your brother. Why he
dialog: can’t behave, like you.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Umma, give him a break.
text: Daniel finishes the last of the dumplings. Grabs his plate
text: and hand washes it in the sink.
text: Min Soo looks over her son, eyes honing in on his bun.
speaker_heading: MIN SOO
dialog: You cut your hair before the
dialog: interview.
text: Daniel groans, but Min Soo is not having it.
speaker_heading: MIN SOO (CONT'D)
dialog: Too long. You look like a girl.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: They let girls into Yale, too.
text: Min Soo scolds him with her eyes, then hands him a money
text: pouch with deposit slips.
speaker_heading: MIN SOO
dialog: Appa forgot this. You bring it to
dialog: him. After you get a hair cut.
text: Daniel takes the pouch. Kisses his Mom on the cheek.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Alright, Umma. I’1l get it cut.
dialog: (off her skeptical look)
dialog: I promise.
text: Daniel grabs his bag and heads for the door.
scene_heading: EXT. NORTHERN BLVD. - DAY
text: Daniel makes his way through his busy Queens neighborhood,
text: passing a slew of restaurants, bars and vendors, etc., all
dialog: written in Korean.
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: INT. USCIS - WAITING ROOM - LATER
text: Natasha frantically charges through the MULTI-CULTURAL
text: RAINBOW of IMMIGRANTS. Heads over to the RECEPTIONIST.
text: Sweating and short of breath.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Natasha Kingsley for Karen Whitney.
text: The Receptionist checks her appointment sheet, and shakes her
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: You’re too late. You’1l have to
dialog: call the main USCIS line and make a
dialog: new appointment.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: No, you don’t understand. I can’t
dialog: reschedule!
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: I’m sorry. You’ll have to call the
dialog: main line.
text: The Receptionist shrugs and looks down, dismissing Natasha.
text: Natasha starts to panic.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I don’t have time for that. This is
dialog: an emergency. The trains were
dialog: delayed.
dialog: (getting emotional)
dialog: Just-- could you please call Ms.
dialog: Whitney? She told me to come back.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Your appointment was for 8 AM. It
text: is now 8:15. She’s seeing another--
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Please. Just call her. Now!
text: Natasha’s now hysterical voice rings through the reception
text: area. The other applicants stare in her direction.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I guess ‘desperation’ translates
dialog: into every language.
text: The Receptionist nods at a SECURITY GUARD standing by the
text: door. He sets his jaw and turns toward Natasha.
dialog: 11.
text: But before he can reach her, another door opens. A tall,
text: thin, brown-skinned man beckons Natasha: LESTER BARNES, 40s.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: (to the Receptionist)
dialog: It's alright, Mary. I’1ll take her.
scene_heading: INT. USCIS - LESTER BARNES’S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER
text: Natasha sits in front of an immaculately kept desk. Turns as
text: Lester enters with a RED FILE in his hand.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: My name is Lester Barnes.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Hi, I’'m--
text: He holds up a hand to silence her.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Everything I need to know is in
dialog: this file. Do yourself a favor and
dialog: stay quiet while I read it.
text: Natasha falls silent. Reaches across his desk and pockets one
text: of his business cards. After a beat, Lester finally looks up.
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT’D)
dialog: Why are you here?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Karen--Ms. Whitney--told me to come
dialog: back. She said maybe there was
dialog: something--
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Yeah, well Karen’s new. Your
dialog: family’s last appeal was rejected.
dialog: The deportation stands as is. You
dialog: and your family will have to leave
dialog: tomorrow.
text: He closes the file and pushes a box of tissues toward her in
text: anticipation of her tears. Natasha shakes it off.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: I didn't cry when my father told us
dialog: about the deportation orders. I’m
dialog: not going to start crying now.
text: Natasha gathers her things. Heads for the door. But she stops
text: with her hand on the knob, swallows her pride. Turns around.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: So there’s really nothing you can
dialog: do to help me?
text: He taps the closed file with his fingers.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Your dad’s DUI--
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Is his problem. Why do I have to
dialog: pay for his mistake?
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: You’re still here illegally.
text: Natasha nods, on the verge of tears. She heads for the door.
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT’D)
dialog: I’ve been to your country. I’ve
dialog: been to Jamaica.
text: He smiles at the memory as Natasha turns back to him.
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT’D)
dialog: I had a nice time. Everything is
dialog: irie there, man. You'll be alright.
text: Natasha glares at Lester.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Where did you go?
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Negril. Very nice place.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Did you leave the hotel grounds?
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: I wanted to but my--
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: But your wife didn’t want to
dialog: because was she scared, right?
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: No, it’s just--
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You listened to Bob Marley, and a
dialog: bartender got you some pot and
dialog: someone told you what irie means,
dialog: and now you think you know
dialog: something. That is not a country.
dialog: That is a resort.
text: He holds up his hands, defending himself.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: Don’t tell me I'll be alright. I
dialog: don’t know that place. I’ve been
dialog: here since I was eight years old.
dialog: Now it’s my senior year. I should
dialog: be worrying about the same things
dialog: my friends are-- like prom and
dialog: graduation. But instead I’m
dialog: worrying about being shipped to a
dialog: country that’s totally foreign to
dialog: me. This is my home!
text: Natasha’s tears finally pour out. Mr. Barnes slides the
text: tissue box closer. She takes a handful, then heads to the
dialog: door--
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Wait.
scene_heading: EXT. NORTHERN BLVD. - DAY
text: Daniel leans against a street light, checking his phone.
text: JUMPS as someone WHISTLES loudly in his ear. He turns--
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What the--?
text: Reveal OMAR HASSABALA, 19, Middle Eastern, raised on Hip Hop.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: I thought you were going to wait
dialog: until right before the meeting to
dialog: put the stick up your ass.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Don’t be mad because I’m going to
dialog: be part of the one percent.
text: Omar checks out Daniel’s suit, laughing.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: You look like a Lebanese insurance
dialog: salesman.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You’re supposed to be making me
dialog: feel better about going to Yale.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: That's what I’m doing. Easing your
text: impending sense of doom with the
dialog: use of comedy. It’s a known tactic.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Well, try something else.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: You could just be like me and not
dialog: go. How about that?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Unlike you, I actually care about
dialog: what my parents think. And anyway,
dialog: the interview’s today. Too late to
dialog: back out now.
text: Omar shrugs and leads the way down the subway stairs.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: You’re supposed to wear black to a
dialog: funeral by the way. Not gray.
text: Daniel playfully hits Omar and they descend into the subway.
scene_heading: EXT. USCIS - DAY
text: Tasha stares at a business card and dials the number on it. A
text: WOMAN answers the line.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (V.0O.)
text: Mr. Fitzgerald's office.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Hi, I'd like to make an appointment
dialog: with Mr. Fitzgerald as soon as
dialog: possible, please.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (V.O.)
dialog: Who am I speaking with?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Natasha Kingsley.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (V.0O.)
dialog: Hi, Natasha. What issue can I help
dialog: you with?
dialog: 15.
text: Tasha hesitates, afraid to say the words aloud. Silence.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (V.O., CONT’D)
dialog: Hello, ma’am? He does have a slot
dialog: at 11 A.M. Can you tell me your
dialog: issue?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I’m an illegal alien.
text: Tasha’s heart races, afraid. We see the giant imposing
text: federal buildings surrounding her as she sits on the steps.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY - DAY
text: Daniel and Omar sit in the congested subway car. Daniel looks
text: at his reflection in the shiny metal subway door. Turns so he
text: can see his ponytail.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: You should just let me cut your
text: hair. I brought my pocket knife.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: No, thanks.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: Your mom’s right, you gotta lose
dialog: the man bun. You don’t want to be a
dialog: virgin forever.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You know, if this interviewer’s so
dialog: smart, he’ll recognize a cool
text: haircut when he sees one.
speaker_heading: OMAR
text: Or at least a desperate attempt at
dialog: cool.
text: The train COMES TO A SCREECHING HALT. The friends, along with
text: the other PASSENGERS, wait patiently for a beat. THEN, a
text: super CHIPPER VOICE over the loudspeaker...
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR (V.O.)
dialog: Looks like we got a slight delay,
dialog: folks. Track work on 68th.
text: A collective GROAN from the passengers.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR (V.O.)
dialog: I know you’re all panicking,
dialog: thinking that you’re late...
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: but look on the bright side, maybe
dialog: the universe is telling you
dialog: something.
text: GROANS again.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: I knew we should’ve taken the
dialog: express.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR (V.O.)
dialog: Happens to me all the time.
dialog: Something goes off in my routine --
dialog: boom...must be the Universe. It’s
text: full of unexpected blessings.
speaker_heading: PASSENGER #1
dialog: Usually the nut jobs are on the
text: train, not driving it.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR (V.O.)
dialog: Deli screws up my order.
dialog: Universe... Maybe I shouldn’t be
dialog: eatin’ deli sandwiches all the
dialog: time. Guess what? I switched it up
dialog: and lost twenty pounds. Thank you,
dialog: universe.
text: The train does a collective eye roll in complete disbelief.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: This guy needs a drug test.
text: The Conductor goes quiet. After a few more seconds in the
text: dark, the train finally pulls into Grand Central.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR (V.O.)
text: We've reached the end of the line.
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, back to your
dialog: regularly scheduled program.
text: Passengers breathe a sigh of relief as the DOORS OPEN.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR (V.O.)
text: This train is now out of service.
dialog: But remember: The universe is
dialog: talking... So slow down and listen.
text: Omar rises from his seat and heads to the exit. Daniel SITS a
text: beat, taking in the conductor’s words.
dialog: 17.
scene_heading: INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - MAIN CONCOURSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Daniel and Omar emerge from the train to find themselves in
text: the main concourse of Grand Central Station.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: How much time you got before work?
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: ‘Bout an hour. Why?
text: Daniel looks to the walkways situated behind on the massive
text: windows overlooking the terminal.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It's been a while since we went up.
dialog: Today’s the perfect day.
text: Daniel starts to make his way through the diverse crowd of
text: people rushing to their trains.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on!
text: Omar follows after Daniel, almost losing sight of him in the
dialog: pedestrian traffic.
scene_heading: EXT. TASHA’S HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
text: Tasha stands outside the fence of her school. Fighting tears.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: It’s still hard for me to believe
dialog: that after today I may never see
dialog: this school again.
text: INSERT SHOTS: She and Bev sitting down at the courtyard
text: outside laughing, walking the hallways, gossiping, etc.
text: BACK TO SCENE: The real Bev walks up.
speaker_heading: BEV
dialog: Please tell me you have good news.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: Bev’s the closest thing I have to a
dialog: sister. The longest time we’ve ever
dialog: been apart is two weeks.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I wish. I was late, so they
dialog: wouldn’t let me see Ms. Whitney.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: BEV
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: So what does that mean? You're
dialog: leaving?! Isn’t there someone else
dialog: you can talk to?

speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I’ve got one last shot. This guy
dialog: Jeremy Fitzgerald. He’s supposed to
dialog: be some kind of immigration fixer.
speaker_heading: BEV
dialog: Oh my God! That’s amazing!
dialog: (then)
dialog: Wait, why are you here? He should
dialog: be “fixing” this! Go!
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I’ve got a few hours before my
dialog: appointment with him.
speaker_heading: BEV
dialog: You should come to Chem Lab and
dialog: mess with Mr. Busby. He’s got on
text: his polyester mom jeans again.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: My appointment’s uptown. I don’t
dialog: want to rush. I’m just gonna hit
dialog: the record store. Kill some time.
text: The bell rings.
speaker_heading: BEV
dialog: Text me the address. I’'1l skip out
dialog: after my test and we can grab
dialog: lunch.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Perfect.
text: They share a look. Bev heads back inside. Tasha puts her
text: headphones on and queues up Major Lazer album. We hear GET
text: FREE and see it carry her worries away.
scene_heading: INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - GLASS WALKWAY - DAY
text: Daniel and Omar chill behind the oversized windows of the
text: main terminal, overlooking the bustling crowd below. All of
text: Grand Central’s architectural glory in perfect view.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: My life’s gonna go one of two ways
dialog: after today. If I don’t get into
dialog: Yale, it’ll be Charlie all over
dialog: again. And if I do...white jackets
dialog: and picket fences from now until
dialog: eternity.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: The American Dream.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Even if I win, I lose. What kind of
dialog: future is that?
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: If losing means you're rich, sign
dialog: me up.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I just wish I could do something
dialog: about it.
text: Daniel sighs. He turns over and lies face up on the walkway.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: There's gotta be something more to
dialog: it all than this.
text: His gaze catches the gigantic mural of the Universe painted
text: on the ceiling of the terminal.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You ever notice that before?
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: Notice what?
text: Off Daniel’s look, Omar joins him on the ground, eyes up. The
text: majesty of the mural is on full display. Several
text: constellations are recognizable.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
text: It’s a sign.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: Oh, see now, you’re just making
dialog: stuff up. We’ve passed this thing a
dialog: million times.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yeah, but have you ever seen it?
dialog: It's like the conductor said on the
dialog: train, maybe the universe is trying
dialog: to tell me something.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: Yep. “You’re losing it, bro.”
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I’m serious, Omar. Of all the days
dialog: we've been here, today is the day
dialog: that I notice the most amazing
dialog: thing in all of Grand Central? It’s
dialog: not a coincidence.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: Okay, then let’s suppose this
dialog: conductor was right...the universe
dialog: is talking. What’s it saying?
text: Daniel sits up, looking out into the main terminal. People
text: shuffle back through the concourse. He looks around, eyeing
text: everything in sight...nothing. A train pulls in.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I don’t know yet.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: Go figure.
text: Daniel plops down on the ground, then... He spots HER in the
text: crowd. A young, Black woman with an enormous, curly AFRO and
text: almost-as-enormous PINK HEADPHONES. It’s Natasha.
text: Her eyes are closed as she sways to her music, in complete
text: bliss. Omar notices Daniel’s gaze and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: OMAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Now what?
dialog: (looking out)
dialog: It’s just a cute girl, Daniel.
dialog: Relax.
dialog: (double take)
dialog: Okay, she’s real cute.
text: Natasha walks underneath them, moving her backpack to one_
text: shoulder REVEALING the back of her jacket. It reads: CARPE
text: DIEM. Daniel’s completely struck.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Look at her jacket! Carpé Diem.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: Carpé wha--
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Carpé Diem... “Seize the Day.”
dialog: (off Omar, unfazed)
dialog: It's gotta be a sign. C’mon on!
text: Daniel drags Omar off in the direction he last saw Natasha.
scene_heading: EXT. NYC STREET - MOMENTS LATER
text: Daniel’s eyes light up as he follows Natasha from a distance.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: This is stalker-ish, you know.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: No, it’s not. I’m maintaining a non-
text: creepy, half-block distance.
text: Tasha enters a record store. GALAXY RECORDS. Daniel stops in
text: his tracks. Stares at Omar.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: the store’s sign)
dialog: You gotta be shitting me! This is
text: definitely a Sign.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: Okay. Definitely ironic. I'll give
dialog: you that... And she is cute...
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I want to know where this leads.
speaker_heading: OMAR,
dialog: Hopefully not to jail. But if it
dialog: does, don’t call me.
scene_heading: INT. GALAXY RECORD STORE - DAY
text: Natasha enters the record store, smiling anyway.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: If today were not today, I would
dialog: spend all day here.
text: Tasha enters the “Rap” section. Then she sees a COUPLE making
text: out next to a poster of Madonna's Like a Virgin. She frowns.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: Ugh. Of all the people to run into,
dialog: on today of all days, why did I
dialog: have to run into my ex? Why isn’t
dialog: he in school? This is my place!
text: These two are ROB, 17, and KELLY, 17. Kelly snakes her hand
text: out and SNATCHES A RECORD. She slips it between their bodies
text: and into her bulky jacket. Tasha shakes her head, appalled.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (0.S.)
dialog: She’s just going to steal that?
text: Tasha turns to find Daniel standing right behind her.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I know! Doesn’t anybody work here?
dialog: Can’t they see what’s happening?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Shouldn't we say something?
text: Tasha shakes her head.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: (re: Rob and Kelly)
dialog: No. I know them.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Sticky Fingers is your friend?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: She’s my boyfriend’s girlfriend.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: How does that work exactly?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I mean ex-boyfriend. He cheated on
dialog: me. With her, actually.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: TMI, Tasha. I didn’t need to
dialog: volunteer that tidbit toa
dialog: stranger.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Great pair.
dialog: (beat, then)
dialog: We should tell someone.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: No way! If I say something, it’s
dialog: going to look like I’m jealous and
dialog: messing with them.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Are you?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: That's kind of a personal question,
dialog: isn’t it?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: We were having a moment.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Were we?
text: Rob pauses from making out, looks up to see Tasha and Daniel
text: staring at them from a distance.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
text: Jesus Christ bleeding on a popsicle
dialog: stick...he saw me!
text: Rob gives Tasha a half-smile and a small wave. Tasha turns
text: her back to him, facing Daniel instead.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh God...is he coming over here?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Maybe we should make out or
dialog: something. Like spies do in the
dialog: movies.
text: Daniel blushes. Hard.
text: Tasha notes his blush and leans back.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m not serious. Obviously.
text: Rob approaches them.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Hey...
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Why are you and your girlfriend
dialog: stealing things?
dialog: 24.
text: Rob holds his hands up and takes a step back.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Whoa, dude. Keep your voice down.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: This is an independent record
dialog: store. That means it’s family
dialog: owned. You’re stealing from real
dialog: people. Do you know how hard it is
dialog: for small businesses to survive
dialog: when people like you just take
dialog: stuff?
text: Tasha spots an EMPLOYEE approach Kelly.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Uh...don’t look now, but I think
dialog: your girlfriend just got busted.
text: Rob looks over at Kelly. EMPLOYEE #2 has now joined them. Rob
text: shoves his hands into his pockets and walk-runs toward the
text: front door.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Rob!
text: But Rob doesn’t stop. He bolts out, leaving her behind.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Damn, that was cold.
text: Kelly hands Employee Prince’s “Purple Rain” from under her
text: jacket. The employee snatches the record.
speaker_heading: EMPLOYEE
dialog: Come back in here again and I will
dialog: call the cops.
text: Kelly nods, then exits quickly.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Well, at least she has good taste.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Yeah, I guess if you’re going to
dialog: steal a Prince record, might as
dialog: well be his best one, right?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I don’t know if that’s his best
dialog: one. Solid top three, for sure.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Tell me, in your opinion, what is
dialog: his best album?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Controversy. My mom used to play
dialog: that song all the time when I was a
dialog: kid.
text: Tasha smiles, impressed. Daniel stares at her, googly-eyed.
text: Grinning.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Listen, Red Tie--
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Daniel. My name is Daniel.
text: He sticks out his hand for a shake. Tasha shakes it. He holds
text: it a beat too long. A moment passes between them.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: It was nice meeting you, Daniel.
dialog: But I really have to go--
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Well, maybe I can walk you--
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: No, I’m good. Take care, Daniel.
text: Tasha puts her headphones back on and starts walking for the
text: door quickly, leaving Daniel standing there kicking himself.
scene_heading: EXT. NYC STREET - DAY
text: Natasha walks out into the crowd and spots Rob and Kelly up
text: ahead. Kelly cries as Rob gives his best half-ass
text: explanation. Natasha moves past them unnoticed.
text: Daniel, ear to his phone, eyes Tasha in the distance as he
text: follows her.
speaker_heading: OMAR (V.O., ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Why didn’t you just get her number
dialog: in the record store?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Because she wouldn’t give it to me.
speaker_heading: OMAR (V.O.)
dialog: I think that’s clearly a sign,
dialog: don’t you?
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: But it’s not like she totally blew
dialog: me off. She was nice. I’m telling
dialog: you, there was a spark there.
speaker_heading: OMAR (V.O.)
dialog: And following her like a serial
dialog: killer is going to reignite that?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I’m not following her. She just
dialog: happens to be going my way.
text: Natasha stops at the crosswalk ahead of Daniel.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, shit, I’m getting close. She'd
dialog: definitely think I was stalking her
dialog: if she turned around now.
speaker_heading: OMAR (V.O.)
dialog: Well, then whatever you do, don’t --
text: Daniel hangs up in a panic. Strains, deciding whether to flee
text: or say something as he approaches. Daniel takes a deep
text: breath. He’s about to veer off when--
text: A WHITE BMW flies down the avenue. The light turns red again
text: and Natasha STEPS OFF THE CURB, not paying attention.
text: SHE’S ABOUT TO GET HIT when Daniel YANKS her backwards by her
text: arm. They fall backwards onto the sidewalk.
text: Natasha lands half on top of Daniel as her phone and
text: headphones CRASH AGAINST THE PAVEMENT. She looks down at the
text: spider webs cracking across her phone’s screen.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: What. The. Hell?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: That guy almost killed me.
text: She looks up the block as the BMW sits on the side of the
text: road with its blinkers on. Then looks to her headphones.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you know how long I’ve had
dialog: these?
text: Natasha cradles her broken headphones in her hands.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I‘1l buy you another pair.
text: She shakes her head “no.”
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s the least I can do.
text: Tasha finally looks at him.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You already saved my life.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You wouldn't have died. A little
dialog: maimed, maybe.
text: Natasha stares back at him, unfazed. Her eyes fill with
dialog: tears.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I’m having just the worst day.
dialog: (a beat; realizing)
dialog: Wait. Were you following me?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Man, I knew you would think that.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You just happened to be right
dialog: behind me?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Maybe it was meant to be.
text: Natasha exhales deep.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I’m just gonna ignore that. Thanks
dialog: for your help.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: At least tell me your name.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Natasha.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Nice name.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: So glad you approve.
text: Daniel stares at her, inquisitive.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: Why are you staring at me?
text: Daniel blushes again. Natasha stares at his face. His hair.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
text: Observable Fact: The man-bun pushes
text: him from cute to kind of sexy.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Now you're staring.
text: Tasha blushes, then clears her throat.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Why are you wearing a suit?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I have an interview later. Wanna go
dialog: get something to eat?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yale. Alumni admission interview. I
dialog: applied Early Decision.
text: Natasha shakes her head.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: No, I meant why do you want to get
dialog: something to eat?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I’m hungry?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Hmmm. I’m not.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Coffee then? Or tea or soda or
dialog: bottled water?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Why?
text: Daniel shrugs.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Why not? Besides, I’m pretty sure
dialog: you owe me your life since I just
dialog: saved it.
scene_heading: INT. MOM AND POP COFFEE SHOP - DAY
text: Daniel and Tasha sit across from each other at a
text: Tasha checks the time on her phone: 10:00 A.M.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Wait. Why aren’t you in school?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: (lying) . ;
dialog: I have a doctor’s appointment in an
dialog: hour.
text: Tasha sips her coffee. Silence.
dialog: 29.
text: cozy table.
text: Daniel fidgets nervously. Blows on his cappuccino so hard a
text: little foam flies up on his face. Tasha chuckles.
text: She then looks at his satchel, suddenly curious.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: What do you keep in there?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
text: Not much. My notebook. I carry it
dialog: pretty much everywhere I go.
text: Daniel pulls out a black notebook. Flips through
text: Tasha glances at it. Sees the handwritten blocks
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You're not a poet, are you?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: No, I just kind of dabble in it.
dialog: For fun. Next year I‘ll be pre-med.
text: Self-conscious, Daniel quickly puts the notebook
text: bag. Tasha notices, leans in.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: (flirting)
dialog: So what are your poems about? Love?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Among other things. Yes, love.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I don’t believe in love.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Well it exists, whether you believe
dialog: in it or not.
text: it quickly.
dialog: of text.
dialog: back in his
text: He laughs.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Oh really? Can you prove it?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Thousands of love songs. Poetry.
dialog: The institution of marriage.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Words on paper. Never mind the fact
dialog: that eating large amounts of
dialog: chocolate has the same effect on
dialog: you as falling in love.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I love chocolate.
text: Tasha laughs, too.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You say it’s just words on paper,
dialog: but you have to admit all those
dialog: people are feeling something.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: People just want to believe.
dialog: Otherwise they would have to admit
dialog: that life is just a random series
dialog: of good and bad things that happen
dialog: until one day, you die.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: And you're okay with believing that
dialog: life has no meaning?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I’m okay believing in the things
dialog: that science can make sense of. If
dialog: love made sense, more than forty-
dialog: eight percent of all marriages
dialog: would make it.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Are your parents married?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Yeah, but if that’s what marriage
dialog: is, it’s not for me.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: So no fate, no magic, no meant-to-
dialog: be for you?
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Boy, please. Quantum Physics is all
dialog: the magic I need.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone
text: so charmingly deluded.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: And you find that appealing?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I find it interesting.
dialog: (beat, then)
dialog: What if I told you I could get you
dialog: to fall in love with me
dialog: scientifically? Without chocolate.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I would scoff. A lot.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I’m serious. It’s a thing. The New
dialog: York Times had an article about it.
dialog: Researchers put a bunch of couples
dialog: in a lab and had them ask each
dialog: other a bunch of intimate
dialog: questions. Also, they had to stare
text: into each other’s eyes for four
text: minutes without talking.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: That sounds ridiculous.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: And yet, it’s a real thing.
text: Daniel and Natasha stand in line at the register, waiting to
text: pay. Daniel has his phone out.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: There are thirty-six questions. How
dialog: about I choose ten randomly.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Knock yourself out. It’s never
dialog: going to happen.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Great. Question number one, what
dialog: are the five key ingredients to
dialog: falling in love?
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I don’t believe in love, remember?
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: Okay. Fine--mutual self-interest
dialog: and socio-economic compatibility.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Do you even have a soul?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: No such thing.
text: He laughs at Tasha as if she’s kidding, but she’s not.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Well, my ingredients are friendship
dialog: and chemistry.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: (patronizing)
dialog: But, of course. Sorry, go on.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I think some kind of moral compass
dialog: is important. And let’s see...
dialog: Physical attraction and the X
dialog: factor.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: What’s the X factor?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Don’t worry. We already have it.
text: He smiles charmingly. A strand of Daniel’s hair falls into
text: his face. He puts it behind his ear.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: This quiz isn’t going to make me
dialog: fall in love with you, Red Tie.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It's Daniel. And give me today.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Can’t. I have a doctor’s
dialog: appointment.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Okay. I’1l walk you there.
dialog: 33.
scene_heading: EXT. NYC STREET - DAY
text: Tasha leads the way, darting in and out of pedestrian
text: traffic, as Daniel struggles to keep up.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: So, where are we headed?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I am heading to my appointment on
dialog: the east side and you are,
text: apparently, tagging along with me.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yep. And while we’re walking...
text: Daniel takes out his phone.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You ready for more questions?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You are relentless.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Persistent. Now, question number
dialog: two: Would you like to be famous
dialog: and how?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You first.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I'd be a famous poet laureate.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: And you'd be broke.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Broke with money But rich with
dialog: words.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: What does a poet laureate even do?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
text: Offers wise and poetic counsel.
text: Tasha makes some gagging sounds.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Be cynical all you want, but many a
dialog: life has been saved by poetry.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You’re not joking, are you?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What about you? What kind of fame
dialog: do you want?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Easy. I'd be a benevolent dictator.
text: Daniel laughs.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You know, all dictators think
dialog: they’re benevolent. Even the ones
text: holding machetes.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Nope. Pure benevolence from me. I
dialog: would decide what was good for
dialog: everyone and do it.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: But what if what’s good for one
dialog: person is not good for another?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Can’t please everyone. As my poet
dialog: laureate, you could comfort the
dialog: loser with a good poem.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Touché.
text: She glances at him, feeling a surprising connection. They
text: stop at a corner, waiting for the light to change.
text: We enter a MUSICAL MONTAGE of them walking through the city
text: as they get to know each other. The urban sounds melt away as
text: a wistful piece of music takes over. Natasha soaks up the
text: city she’s about to say goodbye to and Daniel continues to
text: try and win her full attention.
text: Daniel pulls out his phone again and begins scrolling through
text: questions. Natasha watches him.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Tell me again why you're wearing a
dialog: suit?
dialog: (off his groan)
dialog: Come on, I get to ask questions
dialog: too.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yale. Interview.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Really. Are you nervous?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I’m fine. My parents have only been
dialog: prepping me for this my entire
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: They're immigrants, huh?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Mine too. Do you even want to go to
dialog: Yale?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It doesn’t matter what I want.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: It's your life.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: And what about yours? You sound
dialog: like you’ve got it all figured out.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I’m going to be a data scientist.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: Data scientists analyze data and
dialog: recommend actions based on the
dialog: results. They’re also very well-
dialog: paid.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: That’s so practical. Have you
dialog: always known what you wanted to be?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Well, it wasn’t predestined. I did
dialog: research on growing fields in the
dialog: sciences. I chose one, and tada.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: So, it’s not something you're
dialog: passionate about?
text: She shrugs.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I don’t want to have to rely on
dialog: anyone or wind up working night
dialog: shifts just to make ends meet. I
dialog: can’t live off of passion any more
dialog: that I could off of love.
text: They climb some steps and walk along an elevated walkway.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It's a long life to spend doing
dialog: something you’re only ‘meh’ about.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: It's a long life to spend chasing
dialog: dreams that aren’t real. Do you
dialog: know how many people want to be
dialog: actors or writers or rock stars? A
dialog: lot. Ninety-nine percent of them
dialog: won't make it. Zero point nine
dialog: percent of those left will barely
dialog: make any money doing it. Only the
dialog: last zero point one percent make it
dialog: big. Everybody else just wastes
dialog: their lives trying to be them.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Are you secretly my father?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Ha ha. Look, when you’re a happy
dialog: doctor making lots of money, you’ll
dialog: thank him that you didn’t become a
dialog: starving artist dreaming
text: pointlessly about making it big.
text: Tasha notices the disappointed look on Daniel's face.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: Wait, you’re not serious about the
dialog: poetry thing, are you?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Honestly? If I had my way, yeah.
dialog: This track I’m on is too
dialog: predictable. Yale. Medical school.
dialog: Residency. Marriage. Children.
dialog: Retirement. Nursing home. Funeral
text: home. Cemetery.
dialog: (then)
dialog: People have big, beautiful brains!
dialog: We invent things that fly. We are

dialog: How great would it be if we all

text: Their eyes meet. She’s inspired by his passion.
scene_heading: EXT. FITZGERALD'S BUILDING - DAY
text: Tasha stops in front of a glass high-rise building on lst
text: Ave. Its corporate design contrasts with the illustrious UN
text: building on the opposite side of the street. She looks up at
text: the building, knowing it may be her last hope.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: So, this is me.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I can wait for you out here.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Daniel. You have an interview and I
dialog: have this... thing. This is where
dialog: we say goodbye.
text: Daniel falls silent for a beat.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Am I going to see you again?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: There are eight and a half million
dialog: people in this city. Unless we just
dialog: happen to run into one another,
dialog: again the odds aren’t in our favor.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Let’s do that over. Do you want to
dialog: see me again?
text: A beat. Neither one moves...
text: Daniel doesn’t wait for her reply.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Never mind. I can see that you're a
dialog: little stressed by this
dialog: appointment...like I was before I
dialog: saw you. Let’s try something.
text: Daniel raises his arms laterally, away from his body.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Lift your arms like this.
dialog: 38.
text: Natasha obliges, reluctantly. Daniel inches closer and closer
text: to her, arms out.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Ummm. What are you doing?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: They say that something as simple
dialog: as a hug can do wonders for stress.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Do they?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Mmmhmm, it’s science.
text: Daniel stands face to face with Natasha, both of their arms
text: outstretched, almost wrapping around one another. But they
dialog: don’t touch.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: If this is goodbye, then let this
dialog: hug be my parting gift. Okay?
text: Tasha pulls him in. He holds her tight. Tasha lets her head
text: drop onto his shoulder and her body relax into his arms.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: Go, Tasha. Time to go.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: Let go, Daniel. Let her go.
text: Daniel releases her. Tasha pulls back, smiles at him.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Nice meeting you, Daniel. Good luck
dialog: with your interview.
text: Daniel nods. Tasha heads to the building.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (calling after her)
dialog: You really don’t think we’ll see
dialog: each other again, do you?
text: She turns back to Daniel.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: It’s highly unlikely.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: The odds were that we'd never meet
dialog: in the first place, you know. But
dialog: we did.
text: Daniel looks to the sky. Cracks a smile.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Why are you smiling?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Because I know this isn’t our last
dialog: time together.
text: Daniel’s naiveté upsets Tasha. Tears gather in her eyes.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Goodbye, Daniel.
text: Tasha turns away from him so that he can’t see her face. She
text: walks through the large glass doors of the building.
scene_heading: INT. BUILDING - HALLWAY/FITZGERALD’S OFFICE - DAY
text: Tasha opens a door to find a partially built office. The
text: walls are half painted and bare bulbs hang from the ceiling.
text: Sawdust and paint splotches cover the tarped floor.
text: A woman, HANNAH, 30s, sits behind the desk. She smiles as
text: Tasha approaches.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: You must be Natasha.
text: Tasha nods.
speaker_heading: HANNAH (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry, I have some bad news.
text: Tasha’s stomach folds in on itself.
speaker_heading: HANNAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Jeremy-- Attorney Fitzgerald, was
text: in a car accident an hour ago.
text: Hannah continues the story as Tasha listens.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: Turns out that BMW that almost hit
dialog: me had already done its fair share
dialog: of damage...
dialog: 40.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK STREET - EARLIER
text: JEREMY FITZGERALD crosses the street.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: My attorney-to-be was crossing the
dialog: street, and without his own
dialog: personal Daniel to save him...
text: BOOM. The WHITE BMW cruises through a stoplight and KNOCKS
text: JEREMY TO THE GROUND.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
text: A drunk and distraught insurance
text: actuary hit him.
text: Jeremy crawls to the side of the street as other PEDESTRIANS
text: help him up and call 911.
scene_heading: INT. FITZGERALD'S OFFICE - PRESENT
text: Hannah continues talking to Tasha.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: His wife says he’s fine, just a few
dialog: bruises. But he won’t be back until
dialog: later this afternoon.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: But that might be too late--
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Didn't you hear what I said? He was
dialog: hit by a car. He’ll see you later.
text: Hannah pushes a sheaf of forms over to Tasha.
speaker_heading: HANNAH (CONT'D)
dialog: In the meantime, I need you to fill
dialog: out these forms.
text: Hannah points Tasha to an adjacent desk. She fills most of it
text: quickly. Then pauses at the back page. The prompt: “PLEASE
text: GIVE A FULL ACCOUNTING OF YOUR TIME IN THE UNITED STATES.”
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: I have no idea what to write. So I
dialog: give the facts: my family traveled
dialog: to America on a tourist visa and we
dialog: have not left the country since. We
dialog: have committed no crimes, except
dialog: for my dad’s DUI.
dialog: 41.
text: Tasha jots this down quickly, then hands the papers back to
text: Hannah. Hannah flips through it, then stops on the back page.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: You need more here.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: What does America mean to you? Why
dialog: do you want to stay?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Is that really--
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Anything Jeremy can use to humanize
dialog: you will help.
text: Tasha sits back down. The phone rings as she stares at the
text: blank page. Struggling. Hannah talks as Tasha tries to focus.
text: A second phone line rings as Tasha works on the forms. Hannah
text: hangs up and grabs the second line before it can ring twice.
speaker_heading: HANNAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my God, Jeremy. Are you alright?
text: As Jeremy responds, a relieved smile crosses Hannah’s face.
speaker_heading: HANNAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank goodness, I was worried sick!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yes, of course. I'll see you later.
text: Hannah hangs up the phone and comes back into the reception
text: area, aglow with relief.
speaker_heading: HANNAH (CONT'D)
dialog: He’s alright.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: That’s great.
text: Hannah takes the forms from Tasha and reads through them.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: I’ve seen lots of cases like this--
dialog: you'll be okay.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You think so?
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Jeremy never loses. I’m not
dialog: supposed to say this...but just
dialog: know there’s hope.
text: Tasha exhales, a burden lifted.
scene_heading: INT. FITZGERALD’S BUILDING - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Tasha exits the elevator.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S8.)
dialog: Hey!
text: Tasha turns to the voice. It’s Bev.
speaker_heading: BEV
dialog: How'd it go?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Good. I think.
speaker_heading: BEV
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Well, it’s not official yet, but...
dialog: there may be something other than
dialog: resigned dread in my future.
text: Bev squeals, then squeezes Tasha tight in a hug.
speaker_heading: BEV
dialog: That's amazing! Are you going to
dialog: call your parents?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: And say what? A man who I don’t
dialog: know sent me to see another man I
dialog: don’t know. Then a paralegal, who
dialog: is not a lawyer, whom I also don’t
dialog: know, says everything will be all
dialog: right. What’s the use in getting
dialog: all our hopes up?
speaker_heading: BEV
dialog: Hope seems like a good substitute
dialog: to whatever you’ve been feeling.
text: Tasha smiles.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: BEV (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t tell me. Can you use the
dialog: scientific method on it? Can you
dialog: observe it, measure it, experiment
dialog: with it and repeat your
dialog: experiments?
speaker_heading: NATASHA & BEV
dialog: You cannot.
text: They both laugh.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You know I can only take so much
dialog: positivity.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But there is something measurable I
dialog: have to tell you. I met a boy...
speaker_heading: BEV
dialog: Um, what? When? Deets please!
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Okay, so I saw Rob up at Second
dialog: Coming this morning...
text: As Tasha tells her story, INSERT FLASHBACK SHOTS of Daniel
text: enhanced by her memory and favorable shades of lighting:
text: - Beautifully backlit after he saved Tasha’s life.
text: - Getting foam on his nose at the coffee spot.
text: - Lovingly looking at her as he says “goodbye.”
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: And as I gave Bev the full Daniel
dialog: rundown, it hit me...
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I didn’t even get his full name!
speaker_heading: BEV
dialog: What a fail.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I know! I should’ve gotten his
dialog: number.
text: Tasha looks down to her phone. It’s 11:35.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: I mean, what if this immigration
dialog: nonsense does resolve itself? How
dialog: will I find him again?
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: BEV
dialog: Maybe he waited for you. Wouldn't
dialog: that be romantic?
text: Bev looks around the lobby, searching.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Don’t be ridiculous. He had an
dialog: interview. He’s not still here.
text: In spite of herself, Tasha starts to look around the lobby
text: too. Hopeful. But she can’t find him. Her shoulders slump.
speaker_heading: BEV
dialog: Ha! You’re disappointed.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: And how is that funny?
speaker_heading: BEV
dialog: Because you really like this dude!
dialog: I’ve never seen you like this.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: (still searching the
dialog: lobby)
dialog: Please. It’s not like I think we
dialog: were meant to be or anything
dialog: ridiculous like that...just saying,
dialog: it would've been nice--
text: Tasha finally sees Daniel. He’s crossing the lobby, making a
text: beeline for her. She covers her excitement.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Hey. What happened to your
dialog: interview?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: No hug. No “I’m so happy to see
dialog: you"?
speaker_heading: BEV
dialog: You clearly don’t know Tasha that
dialog: well. Hi, I’m Bev. You must be "the
dialog: boy.”
text: Tasha cuts her eyes at Bev, deadly.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Actually it’s Daniel.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: BEV
dialog: Nice to meet you, Daniel.
dialog: (to Tasha)
dialog: Okay. I’m out.
text: Bev hugs Tasha.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I thought we were having lunch.
speaker_heading: BEV
dialog: I think you’ve got other plans.
text: Bev grins from ear to ear as she trots off. She types Tasha a
dialog: text: Call me later. PS, pls get the digits this time!!!
text: Tasha turns to a smiling Daniel.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Your interview?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Oh, that old thing? I postponed it.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Are you insane? This is your life
dialog: we're talking about.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I didn’t burn the building to the
dialog: ground, ‘Tash. I just moved it
dialog: until later.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: ‘Tash? We're doing nicknames
dialog: already?
scene_heading: EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
text: Tasha shivers a little and rubs her hands down her forearms
text: from the cold. Daniel takes her jacket and helps her into it.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Did you postpone for me?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Absolutely.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: What makes you so sure I’m worth
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Instinct. How did your thing go?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Fine. I have to come back at 3:30.
text: Daniel looks at his phone: 11:45 AM.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Looks like we have more time
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Looks that way, huh?
text: The two of them exchange flirty smiles.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: So, what should we do now?
scene_heading: EXT. HARLEM - MLK BLVD DAY
text: The Manhattan skyscrapers have been replaced by small,
text: closely-packed stores with bright awnings. Harlem feels less
dialog: like a city and more like a neighborhood. Almost everyone's
text: black. Tasha and Daniel walk down the street, talking.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Your father owns a black hair care
dialog: shop called “Black Hair Care”?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yep. Not the most creative name in
dialog: the world, I’1l give you that.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Hmm. I guess when you said ‘store,’
dialog: that’s not what I was expecting.
dialog: How'd they get into that?
scene_heading: INT. STILL PHOTO SEQUENCE - FANTASY
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: My family didn’t enter the Black
dialog: hair care business by chance.
text: A STILL PHOTO OF DANIEL’S FAMILY COMES TO LIFE.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: When Dae Hyun and Min Soo moved to
dialog: New York, Dae Hyun’s cousin gave
dialog: them a loan to open a Black Hair
dialog: Care store.
text: A photograph of a Korean plane suddenly moves, the plane
text: lands in New York City. A photo of Dae Hyun’s COUSIN springs
text: into action as he hands Daniel’s parents some cash. A Hair
text: Care Store frozen in time suddenly bustles.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: His cousin had a similar store and
dialog: it was thriving. As were stores
dialog: other South Koreans had opened up.
text: A wide shot reveals the cousin in front of a store, he goes
text: inside. A dozen other Black Hair Care Stores are alive and
text: thriving on the block.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: And South Koreans didn’t dominate
dialog: the Black hair care industry by
dialog: chance. In the 1960s wigs made with
dialog: South Korean hair were insanely
dialog: popular in the African-American
dialog: community.
text: Various photographs of BLACK WOMEN come to life. As they walk
text: down the street, wigs of every style are on display.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: So much so that the South Korean
dialog: government banned the export of raw
dialog: hair to ensure South Korean wigs
dialog: could only be made in South Korea.
dialog: That combined with the U.S. banning
dialog: the import of wigs containing
dialog: Chinese hair effectively solidified
dialog: South Korea’s dominance in the wig
dialog: market. The wig business evolved to
dialog: the more general Black hair care
dialog: business. Of which South Koreans
dialog: currently control 60-80%.
scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE - EXT. HARLEM STREET - DAY
text: They finally stop in front of his father’s store. Posters of
text: BLACK WOMEN in all styles--afros, weaves, braids, etc., adorn
dialog: the windows.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: So this is it...
dialog: 48.
text: Daniel turns to Tasha, tugs his tie from side to side
dialog: nervously.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: So, you should know that my dad’s
dialog: really...
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Daniel. It’s fine. I get it. All
dialog: parents are embarrassing.
text: Daniel averts his eyes. Tasha reaches out for the door, but
text: he stops her.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Maybe you could just wait out here.
text: Tasha lets the door go, stunned. Daniel reaches for the door.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I‘ll be right back.
text: He sees the hurt in Tasha’s eyes, feels awful.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry, can I try that again?
text: Tasha gives him a big smile. Daniel opens the door for Tasha.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: After you.
scene_heading: INT. BLACK HAIR CARE STORE - DAY
text: A bell chimes as they enter. It’s small and crammed with rows
text: of metal shelves and products. Dae, DAE HYUN, 50s, is busy
text: ringing up a customer at the register.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Well, this is it... You need to go
dialog: to the bathroom or anything?
text: There's one in the back.
text: Tasha shakes her head. He strangles the pouch with his hands.
dialog: Nervous.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Want to show me around?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
text: Not much to see. First two aisles
dialog: are for hair.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Shampoo, conditioner, extensions,
dialog: dyes, lots of chemical things I
dialog: don’t understand. Aisle three is
text: make-up. Four’s equipment.
text: He glances at his dad, but he’s still busy.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you need something?
text: Tasha touches her hair, suddenly insecure.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn’t mean a product. We have a
text: fridge in the back with soda and
dialog: stuff.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Sure.
text: They walk down the hair dye aisle. Tasha stops in front of
text: some boxes with brightly colored dyes, picks up a pink one.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Pink?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Doesn't seem like your style.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Shows how much you know.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I think you would look beautiful
text: with a giant pink afro.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: The whole thing wouldn’t be pink.
dialog: Maybe just the ends.
text: He reaches for the box and now they’re both holding it and
text: facing each other in an aisle that only has space for one.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It would look like strawberry
text: frosting.
text: Daniel pulls a few strands of Tasha’s coils. He smiles. She
text: smiles back. A small moment.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (0.S.)
dialog: Oh, look. My little brother’s here.
text: Daniel jerks his hand from her hair. They both let go of the
text: dye at the same time, and the box clatters to the floor.
text: Charlie saunters down the aisle toward them, eyes filled with
text: curiosity and a mischievous glee.
text: Daniel hands the dye back to Tasha.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What’s up, Charlie?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: The sky is up, little brother.
dialog: (then, re: Tasha)
dialog: Who is this?
text: Charlie’s eyes are on Tasha. Daniel takes a deep breath and
text: readies himself to say something, but Tasha jumps in.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I'm Natasha. A friend of your
dialog: brother's.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh, I thought maybe he’d caught a
dialog: shoplifter. We get a lot of those
dialog: in a store like this. I’m sure you
dialog: understand.
text: Tasha’s eyes widen, stunned by his rudeness.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Jesus Christ, Charlie.
text: Daniel angrily takes a step toward his brother, but Tasha
text: grabs his hand, pulling him back. Daniel stops, links his
text: fingers with hers and squeezes.
text: Charlie makes a big show of looking down at their joined
text: hands and then back up at them.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Is this what I think it is?
text: He claps his hands together with a loud smack and does a
text: laughing two-step dance.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: This. Is. Great. Yes. You know what
dialog: this means don’t you? All the heat
dialog: will be off me.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: When the ‘rents find out about this
dialog: I’‘1l be a boy scout again. Fuck
dialog: academic probation.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Wow. You’re an asshole.
text: He smiles as if Tasha’s paid him a compliment.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: (to Daniel)
dialog: Do your thing and let’s get out of
dialog: here.
text: She squeezes his hand. They turn away and run right into his
text: father. Tasha pulls her hand away, but it’s too late.
speaker_heading: DAE
dialog: (in Korean)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Mom said I had to bring you this.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Want me to help translate for your
dialog: friend?
speaker_heading: DAE
dialog: (to Charlie)
dialog: I thought you didn’t understand
dialog: Korean.
text: Charlie shrugs.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I get by.
speaker_heading: DAE
dialog: (in Korean)
dialog: Is that why you failed out of
dialog: school? You only get by?
text: Charlie’s smile lessens. Embarrassment showing.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to Tasha)
dialog: Don’t worry, he’s not talking about
dialog: you. Not yet at least.
text: Dae’s face goes completely blank. He suppresses his anger and
text: feigns a smile at Tasha.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: DAE
dialog: You want something before you
dialog: leave?
text: He clasps his hands, half-bends at the waist like he usually
dialog: does for his customers.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: No, thank you, Mr.--
speaker_heading: DAE
dialog: Yes. Yes. You’re a friend of
dialog: Daniel’s. Take anything you want.
text: He pats at his pockets until he finds his glasses and peers
text: at the bottles on the shelf.
speaker_heading: DAE (CONT'D)
dialog: Not this aisle. Come with me.
text: Natasha and Daniel follow him helplessly while Charlie
text: snickers. Dae finds what he’s looking for one aisle over.
speaker_heading: DAE (CONT'D)
dialog: Here. A relaxer for your hair. To
dialog: make your hair not so big.
text: He pulls a tub from a shelf and hands it to her. Charlie
text: laughs long and loud.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Thank you, Mr.--
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Bae.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Mr. Bae. I don’t need any--
speaker_heading: DAE
dialog: Your hair’s too big.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I like it big.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Better get a different boyfriend.
text: Daniel glares at his brother.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: We're leaving.
dialog: 53.
text: Daniel practically flings the pouch at his father. Then he
text: reaches for Tasha’s hand and leads her toward the door.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Thank you, come again.
scene_heading: EXT. HARLEM - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: CHYRON: 12:15PM
text: Daniel sighs as he tugs Tasha up the block. She shakes her
text: head. Daniel finally stops, hangs his head.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: Tasha’s giggles turn into all-out laughter. She clutches her
text: stomach as Daniel stares at her, unamused.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I don’t think that could've gone
dialog: any worse. Racist dad. Racist and
dialog: sexist older brother. And the
dialog: store! I mean the ancient posters
dialog: of those women and your dad
dialog: offering me a relaxer.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I’m glad you think this is funny.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Come on. Tragedy is funny.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Are we in a tragedy?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Of course. Isn’t that what life is?
dialog: We all die at the end.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I guess so.
text: He steps closer, takes her hand and places it on his chest.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Seriously. I’m sorry. I’m sorry
dialog: about my family. I’m sorry about
dialog: everything, about the whole history
dialog: of the world and all its racism and
dialog: the unfairness of all of it.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: What are you even saying? It’s not
dialog: your fault. You can’t apologize for
dialog: racism.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I can and I do.
text: Tasha warms to his earnestness.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I get it. It’s hard to come from
dialog: some place or someone that you’re
dialog: not proud of... But you’re not your
dialog: dad. Or your brother thankfully.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I feel like I need a palate
dialog: cleanser now. What’s your favorite
dialog: place to go in the city?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Hmm. There’s so many. But I guess
dialog: if I had to pick one, I’d say the
dialog: planetarium.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Really? Never been.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Are you serious? Not even the
dialog: obligatory fourth grade field trip?
text: Daniel shakes his head. Tasha looks at her phone.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: Then we have to go. There’s a
dialog: twelve-thirty show if we leave now,
dialog: we can make it.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - LATER
text: Daniel and Tasha sit side by side.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: So, you ready for the next
dialog: question?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Oh boy...are we back to that?
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I‘ll take that as a yes.
dialog: (searches)
dialog: Alright, here we go. How do you
dialog: feel about your relationship with
dialog: your mother and father?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You first.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Well. You met my dad...it’s
dialog: complicated. Of course I love him,
dialog: but you can love someone and still
dialog: have a not-so-great relationship
dialog: with them, you know?
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Sometimes I feel like we’re on
text: opposite sides of a soundproofed,
text: glass wall. We can see each other
dialog: but we can’t hear each other.
text: The train brakes suddenly and jostles them even closer
dialog: together.
text: She doesn’t move away.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: And your mom?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Pretty good. She’s kind of like me.
text: She paints.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: So she’s a delusional optimist too?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I guess so.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Now your turn.
text: Tasha rolls her eyes.
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I‘1l make it easy on you. You can
dialog: just give me a thumbs up or thumbs
dialog: down, okay?
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Mom?
text: Tasha gives the thumbs up.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Way up?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Let’s not go overboard. I’m
dialog: seventeen and she’s my mom.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Dad?
text: Tasha gives the thumbs down.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Way down?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It’s hard to love someone who
dialog: doesn’t love you back.
text: Daniel and Tasha fall silent as a STREET MUSICIAN carrying a
text: VIOLIN boards the car. She starts to play Prince’s “When
dialog: Doves Cry.”
text: Daniel nudges Tasha.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: She’s playing Prince. Kind of a
dialog: coincidence, don’t you think?
text: Tasha rolls her eyes.
text: The Musician is so passionate and the tune is so infectious
text: that an ELDERLY PASSENGER starts to loudly hum along. As the
text: song goes on, OTHER PASSENGERS hum as well.
text: Daniel smiles big at Tasha as he joins in.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You're so goofy.
text: The Musician finishes with a flourish and the car breaks out
text: in applause. A true New York subway Moment.
text: The Musician takes a bow.
speaker_heading: STREET MUSICIAN
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, if you like
dialog: what you heard, I do accept tips.
dialog: Cash, credit or debit.
text: The Musician holds her hat in one hand and an iPhone with a
text: card-reading square in the other as passengers head out.
dialog: 57.
text: Tasha stops, pulls out a dollar and puts it in her hat.
text: Daniel smiles and does the same.
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - HALL OF METEORITES - DAY
text: Tasha and Daniel wander through the minimal dark space.
text: Spotlights shine on Meteorites. Natasha runs her hand across
text: the metal-cold surface of a pockmarked rock and ske closes
text: her eyes, fingering the divots. Daniel comes close, watching
text: her. She turns to him, her voice a whisper.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: This rock is 4.5 Billion years old.
dialog: Almost as old as our solar system.
text: Daniel smiles.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: Just think about that, before
dialog: humans ever existed, this object
dialog: was flying through the universe for
dialog: billions of years!
text: Daniel pauses, taken aback by her.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You’re like a kid in a candy store.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Just think, humans have only been
dialog: around for at most two-hundred-
dialog: thousand years. This rock has been
dialog: around for five-thousand times as
dialog: long as all of human history
dialog: combined.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: The way you talk about this stuff,
dialog: you should be pursuing astronomy.
text: Natasha walks off into the darkness of the exhibition space.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: There’s not a lot of jobs in
dialog: astronomy. Not like the other
dialog: sciences.
text: Daniel follows her, pauses in a pool of light.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: But this is what you love.
text: Natasha stands in the darkness, just outside the spotlight.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Cliche as it sounds, love doesn’t
text: put food on the table.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Isn’t that why you’re going to
dialog: Yale?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I don’t know how it is with your
dialog: family, but in mine, my parents
dialog: have a lot of power. And they've
dialog: already decided my fate.
text: Daniel walks back into the blackness. Tasha follows him. She
text: looks at her watch.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Show’s about to start.
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - PLANETARIUM THEATER - LATER
text: The night sky is projected on an ENORMOUS SCREEN. Tasha and
text: Daniel stare up at the stars, transfixed.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
text: The night sky... both beautiful and
dialog: mysterious.
text: Images of the Milky Way galaxy appear.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: But the stars only tell part of the
dialog: story. You see this denser band of
dialog: stars? That’s the Milky Way. It's
dialog: our galaxy.
text: Daniel’s eyes go wide as he takes in the spectacle. Tasha
text: notes his reaction and smiles to herself.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: It's big. So big that even at the
dialog: speed of light it would take
dialog: 100,000 years to travel across it.
dialog: And this galaxy of ours contains
dialog: only about 100 billion stars.
text: The two of them are so caught up that everyone DISAPPEARS
text: around them.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Luckily the Milky Way is not the
dialog: only galaxy in the Universe.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Many of the stars we see are
dialog: actually in whole other galaxies
text: very far away.
text: Daniel eyes Tasha’s hand on her lap.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: There are about 170 billion
text: galaxies, comprised of hundreds of
dialog: billions of individual stars.
text: Natasha’s elbow lightly brushes Daniel’s arm. She notices and
text: they exchange a look, both embarrassed.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: There are more stars in the
dialog: universe than grains of sand on all
dialog: of Earth’s beaches combined.
text: Daniel looks down longingly at her hand. Reaches his pinky
text: slowly towards hers.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Some may find this vastness, this
dialog: unending darkness, proof of our
dialog: insignificance. But I see ita
dialog: little differently.
text: Daniel’s pinky lightly touches her hand. A pause. Natasha
text: freezes. Daniel withdraws his hand quickly.
text: NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON appears on screen, as if he’s standing in
dialog: the middle of the universe. He’s our narrator.
speaker_heading: TYSON (V.O.)
dialog: The most astounding fact to me is
dialog: the knowledge that the atoms that
dialog: comprise life on earth, the atoms
dialog: that make up our human bodies, are
text: traceable to the stars.
text: Daniel takes a deep breath, slowly brings his hand towards
text: Natasha’s hand again.
speaker_heading: TYSON (V.O.)
text: Stars that collapsed and then
dialog: exploded, they became the
dialog: ingredients for life itself.
text: Daniel’s fingers lightly cover Natasha’s fingers. A pause,
text: his hand on hers.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: TYSON (V.O.)
dialog: So when we look up at the night
dialog: sky, we aren’t drawn in merely for
dialog: its beauty...we’re drawn in because
dialog: whether we know it or not, we are
dialog: all part of this universe, we are
dialog: all in this universe, but more
dialog: importantly, the universe is in
dialog: uS...
text: Natasha reciprocates at last. She pulls her fingers around
text: his and their hands intertwine. The tension building...
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - PLANETARIUM THEATER - LATER
text: The lights are up. Daniel’s still blown away by what they
text: just saw. Tasha’s distant. Both of them remain in their
dialog: seats.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: That was...really something.
text: Tasha doesn’t hear him. She checks the time on her phone
text: again: 1:01 PM. She slides her hand away from Daniel's.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Did I say something wrong?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: No, it’s not you. Well, maybe it
dialog: is...Don’t you think it’s weird
dialog: that we've spent so much time
dialog: together today? I mean, we just
dialog: met. We’re practically strangers.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Honestly, I don’t think it’s weird
dialog: at all. Plus, you’ve met my
dialog: family...we’re definitely out of
dialog: the stranger zone.
text: Natasha softens. At ease.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Yeah, I guess. It’s just a lot to
dialog: take in.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I don’t know...I just feel
dialog: connected to you.
text: A beat. Natasha’s belly growls. Their laughter relieves the
text: romantic tension.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You like Korean food?
scene_heading: EXT. KOREAN MARKETPLACE - DAY
text: Music plays as Daniel and Tasha make their way through the
text: densely packed streets of Koreatown. Neon signs in Korean,
text: street vendors, bicycles, and the smell of delicious food
text: wafting in the air.
text: Natasha sees Korean people exiting a building dragging big
text: suitcases. She SIGHS, the weight of the world on her
text: shoulders. Daniel notices. She brushes it off, moving on down
text: the street. They take a quick SELFIE together as the music
dialog: ends.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: So how come you call yourself
dialog: Korean? Weren’t you born here?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: People always ask where I’m from. I
dialog: used to say here, but then they ask
dialog: where are you really from, and then
dialog: I say Korea.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I don’t think you should say you’re
dialog: from Korea.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Because it’s not true. You’re from
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I love how simple this is for you.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Well, your solution to everything
dialog: is to tell the truth. I struggle
dialog: with my identity and you tell me
dialog: just to say what’s true.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Why not? It’s not up to you to help
dialog: other people fit you into a box.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Do people do it to you?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Yeah, except I’m really not from
dialog: here. We left Jamaica when I was
dialog: eight. The first time I saw snow, I
dialog: was in homeroom and I was so amazed
text: I stood up to stare at it.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Oh no.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Oh yes.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Did the other kids--
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Yep. It wasn’t pretty.
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: But eventually this became home. I
dialog: love it here. I could stay in New
dialog: York for the rest of my life.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Well, you should.
text: Natasha deflects.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Well I’m not going to be around
dialog: much longer... You know, if I don’t
dialog: get some food soon. Where are we
dialog: going again?
text: Daniel stops in his tracks. Tasha follows his lead.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Turn around.
text: The pair stand at a nondescript doorway. Confused, Tasha
text: looks to Daniel.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Trust me.
text: He takes her hand and they head inside, the sound of people
text: greeting them in Korean “Annyeonghaseyo” echoes.
dialog: 63.
scene_heading: INT. KOREAN RESTAURANT - DAY
text: Daniel and Tasha sit at a booth in a small hole-in-the-wall
text: joint. Tasha looks over the menu.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I’1l eat whatever you tell me to.
text: Daniel rings the little bell attached to the table and a
text: WAITRESS appears almost instantly. She gives Natasha a quick
text: look, turns to Daniel.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: (in Korean)
dialog: How can I help you?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (in Korean)
dialog: We'll have two seafood soon dubu,
dialog: kalbi, and pa jun.
text: The waitress nods and then walks off.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: There’s a bell?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Awesome, right? It takes all the
dialog: mystery out of food service. When
dialog: will my waiter appear? When will I
dialog: get the check?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Do American restaurants know about
dialog: this? Bells should be mandatory.
text: Daniel laughs.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: No, I changed my mind. Can you
dialog: imagine some jerk just leaning on
dialog: the bell demanding ketchup?
text: The Waitress returns and places the soup and two uncooked
text: eggs on the table. She tosses paper-clad spoons and
text: chopsticks into the center of the table.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh, can I have a fork, please?
text: The Waitress gives her a disapproving look, then walks off.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: Does this mean she’s not going to
dialog: bring me a fork?
text: Daniel laughs.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Don’t worry about her. Try this...
text: Daniel pulls the soup bowl towards him.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: This is soon dubu.
text: Tasha watches as he cracks the egg into the soup. She does
text: the same, then dips her spoon in and takes a bite.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Mmm. It’s delicious.
text: Daniel smiles as Tasha does a little happy dance. He watches
text: her eat, amused. A stream of traffic flowing through a door
text: in the rear of the restaurant catches Tasha’s eye.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: What’s going on back there? This
dialog: some kind of Korean mafia joint?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Oh, no. That’s the norebang.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: Korean karaoke.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Then why don’t I hear any music?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: They have private rooms. Koreans
dialog: are all about embarrassing
dialog: themselves in private.
text: A beat, then a mischievous look comes over Daniel’s face.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Why are you looking at me like
dialog: that?
scene_heading: INT. NOREBANG - PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A small, dimly lit room. Plush, red leather couches. A large,
text: square coffee table sits in front of the couch. On it, a
text: microphone and a remote. Next to the door there’s a large TV.
dialog: 65.
text: Daniel pours over the thick song book, he’s been flipping for
text: a while, agonizing over it. Natasha watches him.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Just choose a song.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: This is norebang. You don’t choose
dialog: a song. A song chooses you.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: How poetic.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Isn’t it?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I don’t know, most poems I’ve read
dialog: are about three things: love, sex,
dialog: or the stars. You poets are
text: obsessed with stars. Falling stars.
text: Shooting stars. Dying stars.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Stars are important.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Sure, but why not more poems about
dialog: the sun? The sun is also a star and
dialog: it’s the most important one. That
dialog: alone should be worth a poem or
dialog: two.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Being the most important star
dialog: doesn’t make it the most poetic.
dialog: Who wants to write about something
dialog: so domineering? I’d rather ruminate
text: on the romantic underdogs that play
text: in the night sky.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Domineering? You’ve got it all
dialog: wrong. The sun is a benevolent
dialog: star. A giver...it’s also our
dialog: greatest symbol of hope.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: How’s that?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: The brightest stars that we see at
dialog: night are often the light from
dialog: stars that have already died.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's sad, really. But the sun is
dialog: different. Everyday it brings
dialog: energy and life and hope to us.
dialog: Without it, we’d all be lost. I
dialog: think that’s something worth
dialog: writing about.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Hope, huh? I never pegged you to
dialog: believe in something as intangible
dialog: as hope.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Just a manner of speech. It only
dialog: means that something is possible.
dialog: The sun makes everything on earth
dialog: possible.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You know what? You’re right. I will
dialog: only write poems about the sun from
dialog: now on...
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: And sex.
text: Natasha rolls her eyes. He winks. Then starts flipping
text: through the book. He pulls the rubber hand from his hair and
text: tosses it on the table. Tasha tries not to stare.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Are you a good singer?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Not gonna lie. I am kinda good.
text: He grabs the remote to key in his song choice. Tasha smiles.
text: The music starts and Daniel slowly settles into a dramatic
text: slump: feet planted wide, hair obscuring his bowed head and
text: microphone held high in the air, ready to rock.
text: The opening chords of “Kiss” by Prince fill the room. He puts
text: a hand over his heart and croons the first verse. It’s
text: Magnetic. As the song unfolds he embodies Princes’ sexual
text: power in a completely fun and charming performance.
text: As Daniel’s sings, Tasha’s imagination takes over. BEGIN
scene_heading: FANTASY MONTAGE:
dialog: 67.
text: --Daniel and Tasha months down the road: lying in bed
text: together laughing and eating cookies, Daniel playing Soccer
text: with Tasha’s brother, Daniel and Tasha wandering Ellis Island
text: together holding hands. And then years down the road, Daniel
text: on one knee holding a ring out to a glowing Tasha. Walking
text: down the aisle, cooking breakfast pregnant, pushing a
text: stroller down the streets of New York arm and arm. The
text: fantasy is of a whole life with Daniel, a beautiful life.
text: Daniel leans in while the songs plays without him and a
text: cheesy guide track keeps crooning. They kiss. IN the middle
text: of the cheesiest and most epic tiny room in the universe.
text: ON CELL SCREEN: MEETING WITH FITZGERALD IN 30 MINUTES.
text: She pulls away and stares intently at the message. It fills
text: her with panic and dread. She’s not going to marry anyone.
dialog: She’s not going to have kids with Daniel. This is all a sham.
text: Her life is over, not starting. Daniel see her shift in
dialog: attitude.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Everything okay?
text: Tasha stares at him with fear and protective anger in her
text: eyes. She almost whispers.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I gotta go.
text: She then bolts out of the room.
text: Tasha runs down the crazy hallways filled with colored lights
text: and crazy patterns. Neon flashing in her face as she wells up
text: with tears.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Hey - what are you doing?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I’m sorry. I gotta go.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Woah! Wait! What are you sorry for?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I just have to go. This all has to
dialog: stop Daniel.
text: Daniel chases her down the hall and she starts to run harder
text: when she eyes a door at the end of a long hallway. She slams
text: into the door at full speed.
dialog: 68.
scene_heading: EXT. NOREBANG/NEW YORK STREET - DAY
text: Tasha and Daniel squint and shield their eyes as they crash
text: out into the sunlight.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: God, it’s bright out.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
text: Back to reality.
text: With tears still in her eyes Tasha strides down the sidewalk
text: clearly to get away from everything.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Wait, what just happened?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Nothing happened.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Bullshit. You’re acting completely
dialog: different. What changed?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Nothing’s changed.
text: Daniel catches up to her and Tasha looks away.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What are you so afraid of?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: There’s something real here. I know
dialog: you feel it too.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Oh, you know how I feel? Do you?
dialog: You don’t know shit Daniel.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What’s your problem?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: This. You and me. This thing. Well
dialog: this can’t happen. It’s over ok.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Hey don’t I have a say in this. I
dialog: know there's something here.
dialog: 69.
text: Natasha leans in and speaks low, with intesity.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Oh, well do you know that I’m not a
dialog: citizen? Huh? So you know that my
dialog: family is being deported tomorrow?
dialog: Huh do you know that? Do you know
dialog: that all this - whatever it is. It
dialog: NOT meant to be. Do you know that
dialog: part?
text: Daniel stares, silent. Totally blindsided.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What? You’re leaving the country?
dialog: Why didn’t you tell me. It’s like
dialog: this is all a lie?!
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I didn't lie to you. I just didn’t
dialog: tell you everything.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I postponed my appointment because
dialog: of you!
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I didn't ask you to do that.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: But you didn’t say you’d be living
dialog: in another country in less than
dialog: twenty-four hours, either.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: It wasn’t your business.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: And it is now?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Look, Daniel. I told you not to
dialog: fall for me, okay? I tried.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: No, here’s how you try. You open
dialog: your mouth and you say the truth.
dialog: Just say, “Daniel, I’m leaving the
dialog: country.” “Daniel, don’t fall in
dialog: love with me.”
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You think a few kisses mean
dialog: something?
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I think those kisses did.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Lets just end this. You have your
dialog: plans and I have mine.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Sure. Whatever. I get it. Just like
dialog: that. OK, Have a nice life.
text: Daniel grabs his jacket and strides away. Tasha watches him
dialog: go.
scene_heading: INT. BLACK HAIR CARE STORE - DAY
text: Daniel walks into the store visibly upset. His dad’s busy
text: with a customer. Charlie’s face goes into a full asshole
text: smirk as he sees Daniel is alone.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Where's your girlfriend? She dump
dialog: you already?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Fuck you, Charlie.
text: Charlie stops smirking, takes a good look at Daniel, noting

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why. Are. You. Here. Little.
dialog: Brother. Shouldn’t you be
dialog: interviewing for Second Best School
dialog: today?
text: A beat. Daniel stares at Charlie, disgusted.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Why are you such an asshole?
dialog: Seriously. What’d I ever do to you?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Is that what you came back for? To
dialog: whine about me being mean to you?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: So you don’t have an answer? That’s
dialog: just the way you’re made?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That’s right. I’m stronger. And
dialog: smarter. And better than you.
dialog: 71.
text: Daniel glares at his brother, anger building.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: If you’re so smart, what are you
dialog: doing back here, Charlie? Big fish,
dialog: small pond syndrome? Were you just
dialog: a tiny douchebag fish at BU?
text: Charlie clenches his fists. He gets right in Daniel’s face.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You want to know why I don’t like
dialog: you? Because you’re just like them.
dialog: You and your mandu and perfect
dialog: Korean. We’re not even from the

speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Wait. You’re mad because I like
dialog: dumplings and I speak Korean?
dialog: That’s your beef?
text: Charlie steps closer, gets in his face.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, my problem is you don’t have a
dialog: spine. You’ve always done what
dialog: they’ve told you to. You’re their
dialog: little golden boy. It’s pathetic.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Wow. I’m not even angry at you
dialog: anymore. I just feel sorry for you.
text: Charlie sees the pity in Daniel’s face. He grabs Daniel by

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Fuck you. You think anybody’s gonna
dialog: care about that shit at Yale?
text: (then, smirking)
dialog: What? You think you’re cool now
dialog: because you brought some black girl
dialog: in here--
text: Daniel PUNCHES Charlie in the eye socket, then recoils from
text: the pain in his hand. Charlie stumbles back.
text: Charlie’s face turns from pain to surprise to rage. He
text: punches Daniel in the stomach, then keeps coming. Daniel
text: tries to block his face, but it’s no use. Charlie’s fist
text: splits Daniel’s lip.
dialog: 72.
text: He rears back, ready to deliver another blow, but Daniel

speaker_heading: DAE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t care what your brother
dialog: says. The only thing that matters
dialog: is you go to school, you become a
dialog: doctor, you be successful. You find
dialog: a nice girl and have children and
dialog: you have the American Dream. You
dialog: don’t throw your future away for
dialog: temporary things you only want
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: But Appa, what if I don’t want the
dialog: same things you want?
text: His father holds up his hand, silencing him.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: DAE
dialog: Doesn’t matter what you want. If
dialog: you don’t go to Yale and become a
dialog: doctor, then you’re on your own.
text: A standoff. They hold eye contact. Neither budging.
text: Finally Daniel grabs his crumpled suit jacket, throws it on
text: and marches out the door. Busted lip and all.
scene_heading: INT. JEREMY FITZGERALD'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Hannah greets Tasha as she enters.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Perfect timing, Miss Kingsley.
dialog: Follow me, please.
text: Hannah leads Tasha into the back office, knocks lightly on
text: the door. JEREMY FITZGERALD, 50s, opens the door, a small
text: bandage above his eyebrow and another around his wrist.
speaker_heading: HANNAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Jeremy, Tasha Kingsley.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: Come on in.
text: Jeremy smiles warmly at Tasha. Tasha enters hesitantly.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Tasha)
dialog: Sit, sit, sit, sit. Sorry for the
dialog: delay. I reviewed your file.
dialog: Please, tell me how this all came
dialog: to pass.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I’m not sure where to begin...
text: Fitzgerald leans in.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: +..So I start with the night my
dialog: father ruined our lives.
scene_heading: INT. NATASHA’S APARTMENT - FLASHBACK - NIGHT
text: Tasha, Peter and Mrs. Kingsley sit around the small kitchen
text: table as Mr. Kingsley clears the Chinese take out and pulls
text: an envelope out of his pocket.
dialog: 74.
scene_heading: MR. KINGSLEY
dialog: My family. Please do me the very
dialog: great honor of coming to see me
dialog: perform the role of Walter Lee
text: Younger in the Village Troupe’s
dialog: production of “A Raisin in the
dialog: Sun.”
text: He pulls out three tickets and proudly hands them out. But
text: Mrs. Kingsley doesn’t take hers.
scene_heading: MRS. KINGSLEY
dialog: You and your foolishness. You can
dialog: keep your ticket. I’m not going
dialog: anywhere.
text: Mrs. Kingsley storms out. A beat later a DOOR SLAMS down the
text: hall. Peter slumps in his chair.
scene_heading: MR. KINGSLEY
dialog: Don’t worry ‘bout your mother. She
dialog: don’t mean it, man.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: But she did mean it. She didn’t go
dialog: with us. Said it was a waste of her
dialog: hard-earned money.
scene_heading: INT. OFF BROADWAY THEATER - FLASHBACK - NIGHT
text: Tasha and Peter sit front row with an empty seat between
text: them. Stare up at the stage.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: I want to be able to say that my
dialog: father was not good. That his
dialog: talents were only mediocre.
dialog: Mediocre would explain all the
dialog: years of rejection...
text: ON STAGE Mr. Kingsley gives a command performance. The
text: audience, including his children, are entranced.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: But he was excellent. Transcendent.
dialog: He belonged on that stage more than
dialog: he’s ever belonged with us.
text: LATER - The actors bow, with Mr. Kingsley center stage,
dialog: soaking it all in.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: I’ve never seen him happier. And
dialog: I’m certain he will never be that
text: happy again.
text: LATER STILL - Mr. Kingsley stands center stage, staring off
text: into the empty theater - save for Tasha and Peter. Peter
text: breaks his father’s trance.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You ready, Pops?
text: Mr. Kingsley looks down at them with far-away eyes.
scene_heading: MR. KINGSLEY
dialog: You children go on ahead. I’1l see
dialog: you later.
scene_heading: INT. BAR - FLASHBACK - LATER THAT NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Mr. Kingsley drinks with his cast mates. They down shot after
text: shot, enjoying the evening.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: So instead of coming with us, he
dialog: went out drinking with his “fellow
dialog: actors.”
text: Mr. Kingsley finally downs his last drink and stumbles toward
dialog: the exit.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - FLASHBACK - NIGHT
text: QUICK CUTS: Mr. Kingsley drives down the street recklessly. A
text: POLICE CAR turns the sirens on and pulls behind him.
text: On Mr. Kingsley’s face. Shit. He knows he messed up.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: And though he only had three beers,
dialog: those three beers were enough to
dialog: change everything.
text: The POLICE OFFICER approaches the window and asks for license
dialog: and registration.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: In all the time he’d been here,
dialog: he'd never had one run in with the
text: law. But here he was, face to face
dialog: with cops, without the proper
dialog: paperwork to show.
dialog: 76.
scene_heading: INT. FITZGERALD'S OFFICE - PRESENT
text: Fitzgerald’s still listening. Now puzzled.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: Can’t believe he’d get behind the
dialog: wheel like that with so much at
dialog: stake.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I don’t think he was thinking about
dialog: anything but how happy... how free
dialog: he was in that moment.
text: On Tasha’s face. There’s more to it than she’s saying.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: That was part of it, but not the
dialog: whole story...
scene_heading: INT. NATASHA’S APARTMENT - FLASHBACK - NIGHT
text: Tasha leans her ear against the door of her parents’ bedroom.
text: INSIDE Mr. and Mrs. Kingsley argue.
scene_heading: MRS. KINGSLEY
dialog: When we met you said all my dreams
dialog: would come true. You remember that,
dialog: Kingsley? You’re a good actor
dialog: because you make me believe all the
dialog: pretty things you say.
scene_heading: MR. KINGSLEY
dialog: I’m tired of your dreams. What
dialog: ‘bout mine? If it wasn’t for you
dialog: and the children, my life would be
dialog: better. If it wasn’t for you and
dialog: the children I would have all the
dialog: things I want. I’d be doing the
dialog: thing God put me on this earth to
dialog: do.
text: IN THE HALLWAY - Tasha slumps down as her father’s words hit
dialog: her heart.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: But I don’t tell Fitzgerald that
dialog: part-- that we are my father’s
dialog: greatest regret because we got in
dialog: the way of his dreams.
dialog: 77.
scene_heading: INT. FITZGERALD'S OFFICE - PRESENT
text: Fitzgerald sits silent, hands steepled as he thinks.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: I wonder how many stories like mine
dialog: has Fitzgerald’s heard over the
dialog: years. How many hopeless cases he’s
dialog: had to sit through...
text: Fitzgerald looks over one of the forms then gets a yellow
text: legal pad out of his desk drawer, then jots something down.
text: Then he sits in silence for a long beat. His expression very
text: hard to read. Tasha stares at him, nervously.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
text: Each moment of silence is soul
dialog: crushing. I knew I shouldn’t have
dialog: listened to Hannah. Shouldn’t have
dialog: gotten my hopes up...
dialog: Then finally--
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: Miss Kingsley--
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: It’s okay. I know I’m out of
dialog: options. Thank you for your time.
text: Tasha moves to get up. But Fitzgerald waves her back down.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: You’re never out of options.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: What do you mean? Are you saying
dialog: you can fix this?
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: I’m going to go see a judge friend
dialog: of mine. He’ll be able to get the
dialog: Voluntary Removal reversed so at
dialog: least you don’t have to leave
dialog: tomorrow. After that we can file an
dialog: appeal with the BIA-the Board of
dialog: Immigration Appeals...
dialog: (checks his watch)
dialog: Give me a couple of hours. I can
dialog: make this happen. Just need to get
dialog: the judge to file by six o'clock.
text: Tasha’s taken aback.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
dialog: I‘1l call you when it’s all sorted
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: But you think you can sort it out?
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: Yes. I’ve done it many, many times
dialog: before. You'll be fine.
text: He smiles at her confidently. Tasha’s eyes light up. She
text: throws her arms around him in a big, impromptu bear hug.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Thank you. You have no idea how
dialog: much this means to me. My family.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: I should call my parents and tell
dialog: them, but right now, all I can
dialog: think about is Daniel.
scene_heading: INT. DINER - DAY
text: Daniel sits at an empty booth. Omar sees him and walks over,
text: looks him up and down.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: Dude, what the hell happened to
dialog: you? Did you get robbed?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What?
dialog: (then realizing)
dialog: I got into a fight. With Charlie.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: Oooh! Finally! That dick’s had it
dialog: coming for a good ten years...
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: How'd your interview go?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Postponed it. For Tasha.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: Are you insane?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yes. Probably. But then we got into
dialog: it and now I’ve lost her, too--
dialog: 79.
text: Omar sits down across from Daniel.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: You’re such a drama queen. It’s
dialog: just a girl, man. There’s other
dialog: girls.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: No. Not like her. I didn’t even get
dialog: her number.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: So Facebook her.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I don’t know her last name.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: So? If it’s in the stars, nothing
dialog: can stop it. Even your clumsy, no-
dialog: game-having ass, can’t fuck up this
dialog: good thing if it really was sent
dialog: down from Zeus or whoever.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Am I supposed to sit here and wait
dialog: for her to walk in the door?
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: No, but you can retrace your steps.
dialog: Or, better yet, Do you know where
dialog: she might be headed?
text: Daniel thinks. Then jumps up from the booth and runs out.
scene_heading: INT. 52ND STREET SUBWAY - DAY
text: Tasha walks down the platform and onto the UPTOWN train.
scene_heading: INT. 52ND STREET SUBWAY - DAY
text: Daniel sprints down the platform, barely making it onto the
text: DOWNTOWN train as the door closes.
text: We pull out to REVEAL Tasha and Daniel are in the same place
text: heading in opposite directions.
text: Natasha’s on the UPTOWN TRAIN, back to the platform. Daniel's
text: on the DOWNTOWN TRAIN facing it.
text: The trains start moving in opposite directions.
dialog: 80.
scene_heading: INT. BLACK HAIR CARE STORE - DAY
text: The bell on the door CHIMES with happy optimism as Tasha
text: steps in. Looks behind the counter and sees Charlie on his
text: phone. He barely looks up as Tasha approaches the counter.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Hey.
text: Charlie finishes with his text and finally looks up. His eye
text: is red and swollen.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: Wow! That thing’s gonna be black
text: and blue by morning.
text: Charlie raises his hand and touches his eye self-consciously.
text: His knuckles are bruised too.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Daniel’s not here.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I know. I was hoping you could help
dialog: me find him. Do you have his cell
dialog: phone number?
text: Charlie leans back in his chair.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You two get into a fight?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Do you have it or not?
text: He flips his phone end over end.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What’s your deal? You got a Korean
dialog: boy fetish or something?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Charlie. Please. I have something
dialog: important I need to tell him.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Tell me why I should.
dialog: Tasha thinks...
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Well, think about how much trouble
dialog: I’ll cause for your brother. He’s
dialog: in love with me.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT'D)
dialog: You give me his number, he chases
dialog: after me and you can just sit back
dialog: and enjoy the show while your
text: parents freak out on him. It’s like
dialog: you said-- it’1l take all the heat
dialog: off you.
text: Charlie throws his head back and laughs.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That's a pretty decent pitch.
text: Charlie takes a beat, considers this. Then he pulls up the
text: number and shows it to a surprised Tasha.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK STREET/EXT. HARLEM STREET - MINUTES LATER
scene_heading: INTERCUT AS NECESSARY:
text: Daniel stares down at a number he doesn’t recognize on his
text: phone. Answers it anyway.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Is this Daniel?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Natasha?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Yes, it’s me. Your brother gave me
dialog: your number.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Charlie? Yeah, right. Who is this?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Daniel, it’s me. It’s really me.
text: Daniel stands up, moving away from Omar.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Why are you calling me?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Just give me a chance to explain.
text: Daniel is still hurt from their fight.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Are you sure I’m not a not a waste
dialog: of time?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Come on, Daniel. It’s complicated.
dialog: Meet me somewhere. Please?
text: Off Daniel’s look, he’s softening.
scene_heading: EXT. 2ND AVE - MANHATTAN - DAY
text: Montage of Natasha and Daniel walking and talking through the
text: city. Natasha is explaining her deportation situation to
text: Daniel. Quickly cut, this scene is set to a bittersweet
text: musical theme. Daniel digests her story.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: And I thought my home life was
dialog: complicated. What’s the good news
dialog: again?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Oh, a new lawyer thinks he can get
dialog: the order reversed...
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Does that mean--
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I might not have to leave tomorrow.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (beaming)
dialog: What? Seriously? No way!
text: Daniel LIFTS Tasha off her feet and SPINS her around.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: He wasn’t a hundred-percent sure,
dialog: but there’s a chance.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I can’t believe it.
text: Daniel holds Tasha. Their eyes meet. Daniel tilts forward.
text: Before he can kiss her, she pulls away with excitement.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I got an idea.
text: She takes his hand and leads him towards...
dialog: 83.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOSEVELT ISLAND TRAM STATION - MANHATTAN - DAY
text: The little Roosevelt Island tram car glides over the East
text: River and into the station. Natasha and Daniel buy tickets.
scene_heading: INT. ROOSEVELT ISLAND TRAM - DUSK
text: The tram is empty but for Daniel and Tasha. All of New York
text: is in view. A breathtaking panorama.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Last time I was on this thing was
dialog: in second grade. And there was an
text: old guy who smelled like tuna fish.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I hate tuna fish.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Right? Now I’ve got an idea.
text: Daniel scrolls a playlist on his phone and presses PLAY. We
dialog: hear PURPLE RAIN by Prince:
text: Tasha smiles. He’s cute. His striking looks illuminated by
text: the setting sun. She looks awkwardly at the floor, then out
text: the window, laughs. He takes her hand, pulls her close.
text: They dance slowly in the middle of the sky. The MUSIC PLAYS
text: as We SWEEP around the car, all of New York City glimmering
text: around them.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Is it gonna hurt if I kiss you?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It'll be a good pain.
text: She pulls him in. Then, a kiss like no other. Sparks fly.
text: Tasha opens her eyes. She pulls back.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: All our kisses aren’t going to be
dialog: like that are they?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You know. Insane.
text: Daniel smiles.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I don’t know... maybe we should try
dialog: it again and see.
text: They kiss again, holding one another as the music continues
text: to play. The entire city lit up at night. Lights twinkling in
text: the surrounding skyscrapers, like stars in the sky.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOSEVELT ISLAND - DOCK - NIGHT
text: Manhattan glows across the East River. Tasha rests on
text: Daniel’s chest, wrapped in his arms.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It's getting late. Are your parents
dialog: going to be worried about you?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: They're okay...told them I was with
dialog: Bev tonight. What about your
dialog: parents?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I’1l deal with them later.
dialog: Tonight’s about us.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: In that case...got any more of
dialog: those questions for me?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You’re not in love with me yet?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Don’t worry. We’ve got time now.
text: Tasha nuzzles further into Daniel’s warm body.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: How about the dinner guest
dialog: question?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You mean who I'd invite?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yup.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Easy. Carl Sagan.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You'd like him...a scientist anda
dialog: writer. It was almost romantic how
dialog: much he loved the universe.
dialog: (then)
dialog: People think science is so cold,
dialog: but it isn’t true. It actually
dialog: makes you appreciate your life.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Meaning...
text: Tasha smiles, shifts her gaze upward to the heavens.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Think about it...the universe is
text: 99.99999% empty space. Nothing but
text: rocks and burning stars spread out
dialog: over a billion galaxies--and yet
dialog: here we are, the two of us
text: together, looking out at the
dialog: universe. We won the cosmic lottery
dialog: just by being born...the time we
dialog: have on this earth is
dialog: extraordinary. It’s up to us to
dialog: make the most of it.
text: Daniel is speechless. Charmed by her words. They lock eyes.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I want to make the most of
dialog: everything...with you.
text: Daniel’s instincts take over. He kisses her.
text: A SHOOTING STAR begins a TIMELAPSE of the night sky, ending
text: as the sun rises above the New York skyline.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOSEVELT ISLAND - DOCK - DAY
text: Tasha’s already up, watching the sunrise. Daniel’s ALARM goes
text: off, waking him. Tasha greets him with a kiss.
speaker_heading: TASHA
dialog: Good morning.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I could get used to waking up like
dialog: this. How long have you been up?
speaker_heading: TASHA
dialog: I wanted to see the sunrise. It’s a
dialog: perfect morning.
text: Daniel joins her. They look out to the city together. A beat.
text: Then, a hint of dread on Daniel’s face.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I'd better go. My interview’s in an
dialog: hour.
speaker_heading: TASHA
dialog: I’m coming with you.
scene_heading: EXT. FITZGERALD'S BUILDING - MORNING
text: Daniel hesitates at the entryway before going inside.
speaker_heading: TASHA
dialog: Wait? What are we doing here?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: My interview’s in the same building
dialog: as your appointment. Looks like
dialog: we've traded places.
speaker_heading: TASHA
dialog: Really? What are the odds?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I keep telling you--
speaker_heading: TASHA
dialog: Don’t say it.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I won't rub it in this time. Will
dialog: you wait for me?
text: Of course she will. Tasha steps closer, straightens his tie
text: for him. Daniel dusts off his pants.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: How do I look?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
text: Like a poet in a suit.
text: Tasha pecks him on the cheek.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: You got this!
text: Daniel takes a deep breath and heads in. Natasha hangs back.
scene_heading: INT. FITZGERALD'S BUILDING - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Daniel taps on the door. Silence. He tries the handle.
text: Locked.
text: Daniel SIGHS. Almost relieved. Then...
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD (0.S.)
dialog: Daniel Bae.
text: Daniel presses his ear to the door. Checks the handle again.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (into the door)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD (0.S.)
dialog: Behind you.
text: PULL BACK to REVEAL Fitzgerald, watching Daniel talking to
text: the door. Daniel looks back and straightens up.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Oh--Umm... Hi.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: Jeremy Fitzgerald.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Mr. Fitzgerald. It’s nice to meet
dialog: you.
text: Fitzgerald unlocks the door and opens it wide.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry...I thought--
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: No, I’m late. Come in and have a
dialog: seat.
scene_heading: INT. JEREMY FITZGERALD'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Fitzgerald looks over Daniel’s application as he moves to his
text: desk. Daniel sits and sees a file on the desk. “Natasha
text: Kingsley.” Daniel stares, shocked.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Are you an immigration lawyer?
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: I am. Why?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I think I know one of your clients.
text: Daniel picks up Tasha’s file and Fitzgerald immediately
text: snatches it back.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: Don’t touch that. It’s privileged.
text: He pulls it as far away from Daniel as possible.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Sorry. You...you saved my life.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I met her-- Natasha-- yesterday.
dialog: Just a handful of hours ago she
dialog: said she was being deported, but
dialog: then she met with you and you did
dialog: your lawyer magic, and now she’s
dialog: going to stay.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: And how did that save your life?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: She’s The One.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: Didn't you say you just met her
dialog: yesterday?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: And you know she’s the one?
text: Fitzgerald stares at Daniel skeptically.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
dialog: Why are you here?
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Um, I’m here for my admission
dialog: interview?
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: No, really. Why are you here? You
dialog: obviously don’t care about this
dialog: interview. You postponed it and now
dialog: you show up here in wrinkled
dialog: clothes, looking like you’ve been
text: in a brawl. It’s a serious
dialog: question. Why did you come here?
text: Daniel takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Honestly? My parents made me. So I
dialog: guess I have to be here.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: No, you don’t. You can just get up
text: and walk out that door.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I owe it to my parents.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: My parents are immigrants. They
dialog: work all the time so my brother and
dialog: I can have the American Dream.
dialog: Nowhere in the American Dream does
dialog: it say you can skip college and
dialog: become a starving artist.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: It says whatever you want it to.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Not in my family it doesn’t. If I
dialog: don’t do this, I get cut off. No
dialog: funds for college. No nothing.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: Would they really do that?
text: Daniel FLASHES BACK to the image of HIS FATHER’S FACE as he
text: gives Daniel the ultimatum.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yes. He would.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: So I guess you have to be sure this
dialog: artist life is worth it.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Haven't you ever done something
dialog: only because you’re obligated to?
dialog: Just because you made a promise?
text: Fitzgerald’s eyes drift away.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: Meeting your obligations is the
dialog: definition of adulthood, kid. And
dialog: today, I have to make a call that I
dialog: didn’t want to have to make.
text: He pulls out Natasha’s file.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
dialog: I couldn’t do it.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: Stop her deportation.
dialog: (off Daniel’s look)
dialog: Your Natasha...she’s going to be
dialog: deported today. I’m sorry, kid.
text: Daniel stares down at the file, incredulous.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
dialog: I tried everything--
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You didn’t try hard enough.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: Listen, I know you’re upset.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It’s not her fault her dad messed
dialog: up. She’s been here all of her
dialog: life. America is her home!
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: I wish there was something I could

dialog: after you and I are done here.
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You’re just going to call her and
dialog: tell her over the phone?
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: Does it matter how she hears it?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Of course it matters. I don’t want
text: her to have her heart broken by
text: someone she barely knows.
text: Daniel walks out, into the empty reception area. Fitzgerald
text: follows.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: So that’s it? No more interview?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You said it yourself. I don’t
dialog: really care about Yale.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: Look, Daniel, Yale’s a big deal.
dialog: Going there could open a lot of
dialog: doors for you. It did for me.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: And you're still not happy.
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: What’s another half an hour to
dialog: finish this interview?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Time counts, Mr. Fitzgerald... But
dialog: you know that already.
text: Daniel storms off in search of Natasha.
scene_heading: EXT. FITZGERALD'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
text: Daniel walks through the sliding glass doors. His face is
text: grim. Tasha takes notice.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: What happened?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I really love you.
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Daniel, what’s wrong?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You don’t have to say it back, but
dialog: I really do. I just want you to
dialog: know it.
text: Tasha’s phone rings. It’s Fitzgerald's office.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t answer it.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I have to--
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Please don’t.
text: His tone alarms her. Tasha lets it go to voicemail.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: What happened in there?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You can’t stay here...
dialog: (beat, then)
dialog: My interviewer was your lawyer.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Fitzgerald?
text: Daniel nods.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: He couldn’t get the order
dialog: overturned.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: But he said he could do it!
text: Daniel’s squeezes her hand and tries to pull her in, but
text: Tasha pushes him away.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: Are you sure? Why were you even
dialog: talking about me?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Your file was on his desk.
dialog: 93.
text: He grabs her hand again. Tasha pulls it back forcefully.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Stop. Just stop!
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Just tell me what he said. Exactly.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: He said the deportation order
dialog: stands. You and your family have to
dialog: leave. Today.
text: Tasha sits on the edge of the fountain. Daniel joins her.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: What are we going to do?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I should go home. Flight’s this
dialog: afternoon.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I‘1l go with you.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: I mean to your house.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I don’t think that’s a good idea.
dialog: My parents are there and I have too
dialog: much to do. You’1ll just get in the
dialog: way.
text: He stands up and holds out his hand for hers.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Here’s what we’re not going to do.
dialog: We are not going to argue. We are
dialog: not going to pretend that this
dialog: isn’t the worst thing on earth,
dialog: because it is. I’m going with you
dialog: to your parents’ house. I’m going
dialog: to look at the place where you
dialog: sleep and eat and live and wish
dialog: that I’d known just a little sooner
dialog: that you were right here.
dialog: (beat, then)
dialog: Is that okay with you?
text: Tasha nods yes. They start walking toward the subway station.
dialog: 33
dialog: 94,
scene_heading: INT. NATASHA’S BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY
text: Daniel fidgets with his suit. Tasha feigns a smile.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Should I take my jacket off? I feel
text: like an idiot.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You don’t have to be nervous.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I’m going to meet your parents.
dialog: Now’s as good a time to be nervous
dialog: as any.
text: He unbuttons the jacket but doesn’t take it off.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: The good thing is, you can screw up
dialog: all you want. You’ll probably never
dialog: see them again.
scene_heading: INT. NATASHA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 33
text: Tasha cautiously steps in, followed by Daniel. Peter packs
text: suitcases as he sways to loud dancehall music.
scene_heading: MRS. KINGSLEY
dialog: Turn that music off.
text: Peter does just that as Tasha’s Mom sees her.
speaker_heading: MRS. KINGSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Lawd, ‘Tasha. I been calling and
dialog: calling you for--
text: Mrs. Kingsley notices Daniel and pauses.
speaker_heading: MRS. KINGSLEY (CONT’D)
dialog: Who's this?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: This is Daniel.
text: Mrs. Kingsley zeroes in. Examines Daniel more closely.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Sorry to meet you under these
dialog: circumstances, Mrs. Kingsley.
text: Daniel shakes Mrs. Kingsley’s hand, then Peter greets him.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (smiling wide)
dialog: ‘Tasha’s never brought a boy here
dialog: before.
text: Mrs. Kingsley waves Tasha to the side.
scene_heading: MRS. KINGSLEY
dialog: ‘Tasha, I need to talk to you.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Is it about Daniel? Because if it
dialog: is, we can just do it right here.
dialog: He’s my boyfriend.
text: Mr. Kingsley walks in as the words leave Tasha’s lips.
scene_heading: MR. KINGSLEY
dialog: Since when do you have a boyfriend?
dialog: That's what you been doing all day
dialog: and night instead of helping your
dialog: family pack up?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: No. What I was doing was trying to
dialog: fix your mistakes.
scene_heading: MR. KINGSLEY
dialog: It don't look nothing like that to
dialog: me.
dialog: (turns to Daniel)
dialog: You know the situation?
text: Daniel nods.
speaker_heading: MR. KINGSLEY (CONT’D)
dialog: Then you know that now’s not the
dialog: time for strangers to be here.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: He’s not a stranger. He’s my guest.
scene_heading: MR. KINGSLEY
dialog: And this is my house--
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Was your house. You weren’t
dialog: responsible enough of a father to
dialog: keep it, remember? Or maybe you
dialog: couldn’t handle the responsibility
dialog: of being a father at all...
scene_heading: MR. KINGSLEY
dialog: What’s that supposed to mean?
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I heard what you told mom after the
dialog: play--
scene_heading: MRS. KINGSLEY
dialog: Baby. There’s no point in rehashing
dialog: all this now.
scene_heading: MR. KINGSLEY
dialog: No, man. No, man. I want hear what
dialog: she has to say to me.
text: Just as father and daughter square off. Daniel interjects.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Tasha, you don’t have to--
text: Mr. Kingsley pushes Daniel back.
scene_heading: MR. KINGSLEY
dialog: Say what you have to say, Tasha!
text: Tasha looks at Daniel, she wants to do this. She steps up to
dialog: her father.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I heard what you said about me and
dialog: Peter... That we were your greatest
dialog: regrets. How could you say that
dialog: about your own children?
text: The steam comes out of Mr. Kingsley’s engine. He searches
text: futilely for words...
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m sorry that life didn’t give you
dialog: all the things you wanted.
scene_heading: MR. KINGSLEY
dialog: I didn’t mean it ‘Tasha. It was
dialog: just talk. All of it was just--
text: She holds up her hand to stop him. Tears pool in Mr.
text: Kingsley’s eyes.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Maybe you were right. Maybe you
dialog: weren’t meant to have us. Maybe you
dialog: really were cheated.
scene_heading: MR. KINGSLEY
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: Was just talk ‘Tasha. I really
dialog: didn’t mean nothing by it.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: It doesn’t matter if you meant it
dialog: or not. Hearing you say those words
dialog: spoiled all the good memories I did
dialog: have of us. Made me wonder, did you
dialog: regret my existence when we were
dialog: watching cricket matches together?
text: Eating mint chocolate chip ice
dialog: cream after school? What about the
dialog: day I was born?
text: Tears stream from Natasha’s face. Daniel holds her. She pulls
text: free from him, continuing.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: But I decided, you don’t get to
dialog: regret us. People make mistakes all
dialog: the time. Small ones, like getting
dialog: in the wrong checkout line. And big
dialog: ones like giving up... I saw the
dialog: play. That night, on stage you were
dialog: incredible. But in real life, all
dialog: you’ve done is quit on your family.
dialog: Leaving the rest of us to pick up
dialog: where you left off.
text: Mrs. Kingsley’s crying now too. Peter walks into her arms for
text: a hug.
scene_heading: MR. KINGSLEY
dialog: ‘Tasha, I’m sorry. You should have
dialog: never heard those words from my
dialog: mouth. When we came here, it was
dialog: supposed to be different... but
dialog: America has never been what they
dialog: said it was gonna be for me. I
dialog: can’t stand seeing your mother work
dialog: her fingers to the bone day in and
dialog: day out anymore than I can stand
dialog: the holes in your brother's
dialog: sneakers. We’re immigrants, Tasha.
dialog: How can I be a man when the rest of
dialog: the world says that I am not?
text: Tasha wipes her brother’s face. Comforts him. Replies.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You decide who you are, that’s how.
dialog: That’s why we came here, not for
dialog: handouts, but to make our own
dialog: lives.
text: Mr. Kingsley holds his head in his hands. Ashamed. Tasha
text: approaches, gently laying a hand on his shoulder.
dialog: 34
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: Dad, I know what it cost you to
dialog: bring us here. But just because it
dialog: got hard, doesn’t mean we don’t
dialog: still need you. When we get to
dialog: Jamaica, you can’t give up. You can
dialog: be a father. A husband. And an
dialog: actor all at once. It’s up to you.
text: She hugs him. Mrs. Kingsley and Peter join in.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: It wasn't exactly the ending I was
dialog: hoping for this morning, but at
dialog: least we were on our way to being a
dialog: family again.
text: Tasha sniffs, then motions for Daniel. Together as one, they
dialog: embrace.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. CAB - DAY 34
text: Peter looks out from the back of a cab as it drives off with
text: Tasha’s family. On the curb, a CABBIE loads Tasha’s suitcase
text: into the trunk of another cab. Tasha finishes a FACETIME with
text: Bev as Daniel climbs into the backseat.
speaker_heading: BEV (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: I’m booking my flight now!
dialog: Christmas in Jamaica is a thing,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: NATASHA (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Yes, I believe so.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I’m so sorry, Bev. It all happened
dialog: so fast.
text: The cabbie gets inside the car.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: I have to go. I’1l call you soon as
dialog: I land. Love you.
text: Tasha hangs up, then gets in the cab.
scene_heading: INT. CAB - DAY
text: Natasha looks out the window, soaking up her Bronx
text: neighborhood one final time. Then she lays her head on
text: Daniel’s shoulder.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Do you think we would've worked out
dialog: if I stayed?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: No question. Do you?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Yes.
text: Daniel smiles.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT’D)
dialog: How hard would it have been for
dialog: your parents?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It would take them a long time.
dialog: Longer for my dad. I don’t think
dialog: they’d have come to our wedding.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I have something to tell you.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You shouldn’t go to Yale and be a
dialog: doctor if your heart’s not in it.
dialog: If you want to be a poet and write
dialog: your heart out, do that. There’s
dialog: still time.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What about doing the practical
dialog: thing?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
text: Practicality is overrated.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Does that mean you don’t want to be
dialog: a data scientist anymore?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I don’t know. Maybe not. You got me
dialog: thinking. It’d be nice to do
dialog: something I’m actually passionate
dialog: about, like study the stars.
text: Daniel turns to her, surprised.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What a difference a day makes.
text: They're silent for a long beat.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: So, how many more questions do we
dialog: have left?
text: He takes out his phone.
text: He laughs.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Just one. And we still have to
text: stare into each other’s eyes for
dialog: four minutes.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: We could do that or...we could just
text: make out instead.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: You guys know I can hear you,
dialog: right?
text: (through the rearview
dialog: mirror)
dialog: I can see you too.
text: Tasha and Daniel join in.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Okay, last question. Of all the
dialog: people in your family, whose death
dialog: would you find the most disturbing,
dialog: and why?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: My dad.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Why him?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Because he’s not done yet. What
dialog: about you?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yours.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I’m not your family, though.
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yes, you are. In some other
dialog: universe maybe we're married, with
text: two kids, or maybe two cats.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You always find the right words.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You’1ll make a great poet.
text: Daniel takes this in. The cab pulls to the curb.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRPORT - DAY
text: Tasha and Daniel stand at the curb, trying their best to keep
text: it together. Prince’s “I Would Die For You” starts playing on
text: the radio inside the cab.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You hear that?
text: Tasha cracks a somber smile.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Three times in one day...what are
dialog: the odds?
text: Daniel winks. Tasha softens.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: So...are you ready for the finale?
text: Daniel sets his phone timer for FOUR MINUTES then takes both
text: Natasha’s hands in his.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m not sure if we’re supposed to
dialog: hold hands during this part but --
dialog: why not.
text: The clock runs. They stare into each other’s eyes, giggling a
text: little at first. Tasha looks away but Daniel squeezes her
text: hands just enough to get her to focus. As she stares in his
dialog: eyes...
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: Daniel believes this is fate...
dialog: that everything aligned for us to
dialog: be in the right place at just the
dialog: right time. I don’t know that this
dialog: is fate.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: But I do know that a lot of events
dialog: had to transpire for us to be
dialog: standing here, right now, in the
dialog: middle of this vast universe.
dialog: That’s amazing.
text: They continue to stare, less self-conscious. Their smiles
text: drift away as they catalog each other’s face. Tasha relives
dialog: all the moments that led them here:
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: Because if I hadn't been late to my
dialog: appointment, I wouldn’t have met
dialog: Lester Barnes. And if he hadn’t
dialog: said the word ‘irie,’ I wouldn’t
dialog: have had a meltdown. And if I
dialog: hadn’t had my meltdown, I wouldn’t
dialog: have eventually met Daniel.
text: As she speaks, we see GLIMPSES of the day.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
dialog: And if I hadn’t met Daniel, I may
dialog: have never known this feeling
dialog: that’s taking over me right now.
dialog: This feeling that can only be--
text: The phone timer BUZZES, bringing Tasha BACK TO REALITY.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Love.
dialog: (beat, then)
dialog: I love you, Daniel Bae.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I guess the questionnaire worked.
text: Tasha’s phone RINGS. She looks down. It’s her mom.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You have to go...
text: She nods. But neither one of them moves.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I don’t know how to say goodbye.
text: Daniel’s eyes mist.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Then don’t...
text: On Tasha’s face, she has to.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: This day can’t be all there is. It
dialog: just can’t--
text: Before he can finish, Tasha pulls him into a long, final hug.
text: Then she reluctantly lets him go.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Bye, Daniel.
text: Tasha turns and walks off, leaving Daniel looking on,
text: heartbroken, as she disappears inside the airport.
scene_heading: INT. CAB - DAY
text: Daniel gets in a cab and shuts the door. Slumps in his seat.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Where to?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I don’t care. Just drive.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT - TICKET COUNTER - DAY
dialog: 
text: Natasha and her family check their bags.
scene_heading: MRS. KINGSLEY
dialog: Get out your ID's.
text: Tasha searches her purse, absentmindedly. Her heart still
dialog: with Daniel.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. AIRPORT - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY
text: The cab approaches two paths: one to exit the airport, the
text: other to return to the terminals. Daniel looks back and forth
text: between the two paths. Then suddenly sits up.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Can you please circle back?
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Did you forget something?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yes, sir. Something really
dialog: important.
text: The cabbie takes the terminal exit and they circle back.
dialog: 104.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS
text: Natasha and her family enter the long TSA security line.
text: CLOSE ON her ticket. ONE WAY.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS
text: The taxi pulls up to Tasha’s terminal. Daniel hands the
text: cabbie a few bucks and then takes off running.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS
text: Daniel sprints through the airport, searching for Tasha.
scene_heading: TICKETING AREA —- CONTINUOUS
text: Daniel panting heavily, hair in his face. No Tasha. He looks
dialog: up...
text: ON THE DEPARTURES BOARD
text: Countries from all over the world. He finds the flight to
text: Jamaica. Daniel notes the gate. DARTS off.
scene_heading: INT. TSA SECURITY CHECKPOINT - CONTINUOUS
text: Tasha and her family wait their turn in the TSA line.
speaker_heading: ON DANIEL
text: Searching the crowded line for her. No Tasha. Then finally...
text: He spots a familiar AFRO in the crowd of people. He slows to
text: a brisk walk, fixes his hair, then ducks under the stretched
text: barriers, cutting the line.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON NATASHA
text: She’s lost in her own world, head down. Forlorn. Then...
speaker_heading: DANIEL (0.S.)
dialog: ‘Tasha!
text: She turns at the sound of her name.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON DANIEL
text: His eyes go WIDE...
dialog: 105.
text: It’s TASHA! She looks on at Daniel, in disbelief.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Marry me. Then you can legally
dialog: stay.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Marry you? You can’t be serious.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: You are.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You love me, right? Isn’t that what
dialog: you just said?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I do, but--
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: So we'll elope and we’1ll move
dialog: somewhere cheap... I’ll get a
dialog: crappy job and write at night...
dialog: and you can finish school and
dialog: graduate with your friends and then
dialog: become a data scientist or-- an
dialog: astronomer! You can do whatever you
dialog: want, Tasha. Just stay.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Daniel... listen. I do really love
dialog: you. But we have to be smart. We’ve
dialog: only known each other for a day. A
dialog: day. You keep saying we're meant to
dialog: be, but what if we’re not?
text: An ANNOUNCEMENT drowns her out.
speaker_heading: GATE AGENT (V.O.)
dialog: (loudspeaker)
dialog: This is the boarding call for
dialog: flight 436 to Jamaica...
text: Time’s up. Tears gather in Tasha’s eyes. She takes Daniel by
dialog: the hand.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Right now, this is real life. The
text: plane waiting on the tarmac to send
dialog: me and my family back to Jamaica is
dialog: very real. I tried to stay...
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT'D)
dialog: I tried everything and I failed,
dialog: and now that’s it. I have to go.
text: Tasha lets a single tear fall down her face. Daniel wipes it
text: off. They stand face-to-face in the security line.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I don’t want to lose you.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: What happens next is up to us. We
dialog: decide our fate. There’s Facetime,
dialog: emails, Skype... we'll figure it
dialog: out. We’re not going to give up,
dialog: okay?
text: Tasha plants a final kiss on Daniel’s cheek, then rejoins her
text: family in the security line. Daniel looks on, distraught.
scene_heading: INT. TASHA’S PLANE - DUSK
text: Tasha stares out the window as the sun begins to set. Her
text: mother pats her arm reassuringly.
scene_heading: MRS. KINGSLEY
dialog: It's going to be okay, Tasha.
dialog: You'll see...
text: Tasha manages a small smile. The plane ascends into the night
text: sky. Tasha looks out the window watching the city fade.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (V.O.)
text: From up here, the city lights look
dialog: like earth-bound stars. And I know
dialog: one of those stars is Daniel...
scene_heading: INT. AIRTRAIN - DUSK
text: Daniel sits on a train, watches a plane take off. Is it

speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: You come to me from another world.
text: He looks out the window as the airport fades into the
dialog: distance.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O., CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. AIRTRAIN - DUSK
