scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM. CAY
text: A private day schoci. Twenty 10th grade boys are sitting in
text: desks in geometry class. They are dressed in school uniform,
text: jight blue shirts and khakis. Tne boys look dazed and sleepy.
text: The teacher, MR. ADAMS, is at the front of the room,
text: finishing a complicated equation on the chalkboard.
speaker_heading: MR. ADAMS
dialog: Except when the value of the x co-

text: A boy named ISAAC has raised his hand.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: What about that problem?
text: Isaac points to a startling and intricate arrangement of huge
text: numbers and strange symbols filling-up a forgotten corner of
text: the chalkboard. The heading above it says Extra Credit.
speaker_heading: MR. ADAMS
dialog: Oh, I really just put that up there
dialog: as a joke. That's probably the hard-
dialog: est geometry equation in the world.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: How much extra credit is it worth?
speaker_heading: MR. ADAMS
dialog: Well. I've never seen anyone get it
dialog: right before, including my mentor Dr.
dialog: Leaky at MIT. So I guess if anyone
dialog: here can do it,
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'll make sure none of you ever have
dialog: to open another math book again for
dialog: the rest of your lives.
text: There is some quiet murmuring. The name Fischer is repeated
text: over and over. The boys begin to look to a student in the
text: back row.
text: Unlike his classmates, he wears the Rushmore school blazer
text: with insignia on the breast pocket and a Rushmore repp tie
text: knotted tightly. His hair is smartly parted and swept back.
text: He is extremely skinny and pale. He is MAX FISCHER.
text: Max has a cup of coffee on his desk and he is reading the
dialog: Wall Street Journal.
speaker_heading: MR. ADAMS
dialog: Max? You want to try it?
text: Max looks up.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'm sorry. Did someone say my name?
text: Everyone laughs. Max smiles slightly. He buttons his blazer
text: and straightens his tie. He picks up his cup of coffee and
text: takes a sip. He goes to the chalkboard and sets to work.
text: The boys watch with nervous anticipation. Mr. Adams compares
text: Max's progress with the notes in his book. Max's equation
text: quickly fills-up most of the board. He finishes it with a
text: flourish, throws his piece of chalk in the trash, and turns
dialog: to face the class.
text: Everyone looks to Mr. Adams. Mr. Adams raises an eyebrow. He
dialog: nods .
text: The classroom erupts into wild, ecstatic applause. Everyone
text: surrounds Max, cheering, as he walks calmly back to his desk.
text: They hoist him into che air.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Max with his eyes closed, smiling serenely, listening to the
text: applause. He mutters: .
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.
text: A little hand grabs Max's arm and shakes him. Max opens his
text: eyes. The person shaking him is his chapel partner, DIRK
text: CALLOWAY, a fourth grader with nearly white hair. Max looks
dialog: around.
text: They are in chapel, surrounded by rows of boys in school
text: uniforms. Dirk puts his finger te his lips.
speaker_heading: DIRK
dialog: Shh.
text: Max rubs his eyes and sits up in the pew. The applause dies
text: down and Max looks to the pulpit as the guest chapel speaker,
text: HERMAN BLUME, steps up to the microphone.
text: Mr. Blume is a tough-looking guy about fifty years old ina
text: black suit. He begins his chapel speech.
speaker_heading: MR. BLUME
dialog: You guys have it real easy. I never
dialog: had it like this where I grew up.
dialog: But I send my kids here. Because
dialog: the fact is, whether you ceserve
dialog: it or not: you go to one of the
dialog: best schools in this country.
text: Max's eyes light-up.
speaker_heading: MR. BLUME
dialog: Rushmore. You lucked out.
text: Max leans forward to the railing and begins to listen
text: intently.
speaker_heading: MR. BLUME
dialog: Now for some of you it doesn't matter.
dialog: You were born rich and you're going
dialog: to stay rich. But here's my advice to
dialog: the rest of you: take dead aim on the
dialog: rich boys. Get them in the crosshairs.
dialog: And take them down.
text: Some of the students and faculty begin to look at each other
text: with puzzled expressions. Max is nodding and taking notes on
text: the flypage of a hymnal.
scene_heading: INSERT HYMNAL:
dialog: Rushmore -- best school in country.
dialog: rich kids -- bad?
speaker_heading: MR. BLUME
dialog: Just remember: they can buy anything.
dialog: But they can't buy backbone. Don't

text: Two Jack Russell terriers follow quickly at his heels.
scene_heading: DR. GUGGENHEIM

dialog: Maybe you could give us an encore.
dialog: (whistles to the dogs)
dialog: Nicholas! Copernicus!
speaker_heading: MR. BLUME
dialog: (lighting a cigarette)
dialog: I don't give a shit. I paid for the

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Mr. Blume.
text: Max has appeared beside them. Dirk tags along behind him.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: My name’s Max Fischer. I just wanted

speaker_heading: MR. BLUME
dialog: You don't say. Tell me something.
dialog: How long have you gone here?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Ten years.
speaker_heading: MR. BLUME
dialog: Then you've been in a dreamworld
dialog: for ten years.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I know it, sir.
text: Max smiles broadly. They each notice that their haircuts are
text: identical, neatly parted on the side.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Your speech was excellent. Except
dialog: I disagree with your ideas about
dialog: rich kids. Because. After all, we
dialog: don't choose whe our fathers are.
dialog: But that's really my only criticism.
speaker_heading: MR. BLUME
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: Thank you.

dialog: Calloway.
speaker_heading: MR. BLUME
dialog: (gfiakes Dirk's hand)
dialog: Nile to meet you, Dirk.
speaker_heading: MAX .
dialog: Thank you for coming today, sir.
text: Max shakes Mr. Blume's hand. Mr. Blume smiles. But Max
text: doesn't go. He just stands there. Searching for the words.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I really. I think it's. You're
dialog: right about Rushmore. Look around.
dialog: It truly is a great school.
text: Mr. Blume nods. A little uneasy.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Anyway. Nice to have met you.
text: Max goes. Mr. Blume and Dr. Guggenheim watch him walk away
dialog: with Dirk.
speaker_heading: MR. BLUME
dialog: What's his name again?
scene_heading: DR. GUGGENHEIM
dialog: Max Fischer.
speaker_heading: MR. BLUME
dialog: He's a sharp little guy.

scene_heading: DR. GUGGENHEIM
dialog: We're putting you on what we call

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And what does that entail?
scene_heading: DR. GUGGENHEIM
dialog: It entails that if you fail another

dialog: leave Rushmore.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I see.
dialog: (raises an eyebrow)
dialog: In other words, I'll be expelled.
scene_heading: DR. GUGGENHEIM
dialog: Right.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Dr. Guggenheim. I don’t want to
dialog: tell you how to do your job. But
dialog: the fact is no matter how hard I
dialog: try I still might flunk another
dialog: class. And if that means I have to
dialog: stay on for a post-graduate year,
dialog: then so be it. But if --
scene_heading: DR. GUGGENHEIM
dialog: We don’t offer a postgraduate year.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Well. We don't offer it vet.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And what about the fact that I'm

scene_heading: DR. GUGGENHEIM
dialog: You're not dyslexic.
speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You remember how I got into this
dialog: school?
scene_heading: DR. GUGGENHEIM
dialog: Yeah, I do. You wrote a play.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That's right. A little one act. And
dialog: my mother read it and felt I should go

dialog: gave me a scholarship, didn't you?
text: Dr. Guggenheim nods.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Do you regret it?
scene_heading: DR. GUGGENHEIM
dialog: No, I don't regret it. But I still
dialog: might have to expel you.
text: Max nods. He smiles sadly and whispers:
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Couldn't we just let me float by?
dialog: For old times’ sake?
scene_heading: DR. GUGGENHEIM

speaker_heading: DIRK

dialog: Oh, no. Not again. What are you
dialog: going to do?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: The only thing I can do. Try to

speaker_heading: DIRK

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Where’d you go to school, by the

speaker_heading: MISS CROSS

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: MISS CROSS
dialog: Latin-American studies.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Ah. That‘s interesting. Did you

speaker_heading: MISS CROSS
dialog: This is more like Central America.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Sure. Central America and what-not.
dialog: But moving on: they're going to
dialog: cancel Latin. They have to make
dialog: room for Japanese.
speaker_heading: MISS CROSS
dialog: Really? That's too bad. All the

speaker_heading: MAX
