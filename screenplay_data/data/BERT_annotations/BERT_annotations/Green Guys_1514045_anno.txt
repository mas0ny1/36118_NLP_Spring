dialog: Forward.
dialog: To Whom It May Concern,
dialog: | wrote this script in the Spring of 2009 when | was 22, about to turn 23. | wanted to
dialog: make a movie utilizing my dad’s law offices in Phoenix, Arizona, and so | came up with
dialog: this story about stockbrokers creating a ponzi scheme. This was around the time that
dialog: the Bernie Madoff scandal broke and it was everywhere. | finished the first draft in two
dialog: weeks and six months later we were shooting.
dialog: | constantly read scripts online and thought it was only fair to “pay it forward” by posting
dialog: my own script as well. It was my first produced feature screenplay and although I’ve
dialog: improved as a writer since then, I’m still very proud that we got this made. (it’s currently
dialog: available on iTunes and | now liken it to a micro budget “Wolf of Wall Street”)
dialog: Enjoy and please look out for my new work as well.
dialog: Sincerely,
dialog: Cole Mueller.
dialog: Sunday, March 30th, 2014.

text: He holds a gun in his hands, clutching it tightly.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HALLWAY -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: OFFICIAL #1
dialog: He's ready-
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL #2
dialog: -Full confession?
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL #1
dialog: Full confession.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL #3
dialog: He wants total immunity.
text: They turn the corner and enter a small dark room, where a single

text: The three men pull up chairs across from him.
text: One of them pulls out a small recording device, sets it up in
text: front of the man.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL #2
dialog: Someone went to work on that eye.
text: The man doesn't respond.

speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: We're an exclusive group here,
dialog: Jeffrey. Do you realize that?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I guess so-
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: -How long have I known you?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: About...four years.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Okay. No offense, but the only reason
dialog: we are talking right now is because
dialog: I've built a rapport with you.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: We have twenty other people that want
dialog: to meet with us but we're sitting here
dialog: with you.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: We don't let just anyone invest with
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: We're trying to maintain an image.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Yes, of course.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Someone's gonna get rich. It might
dialog: as well be you.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Do you understand what this
dialog: opportunity is? I mean, do you truly
dialog: understand what this opportunity is?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Um...
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Tell'em Billy.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: We will all but guarantee ten percent
dialog: back on your investment in the first
dialog: month.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: In the first month?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: The first month, Jeffrey. You have
dialog: to realize...there is a reason that
dialog: we are some of the most sought after
dialog: brokers in the country right now.
dialog: It's because we've created our brand.
dialog: The Phoenix Group brand. And it
dialog: stands for strength, reliability and
dialog: consistency.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I just don't like how the minimums-
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: -There's only a minimum so we can know
dialog: that you are serious about the
dialog: investment. Serious about the
dialog: commitment.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Look-If you feel uncomfortable after
dialog: a few months and you want your money
dialog: back, you can just pull out, and
dialog: that'll be it.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: But you won't. Because after you see
dialog: the returns you're getting in the
dialog: first two months, you'll be dying to
dialog: give us more money.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Do you know how our site works,
dialog: Jeffrey?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Well, let me break it down really
dialog: quick. We have implemented a system,
dialog: utilizing the internet, that allows
dialog: our investors to constantly keep
dialog: track of their net gains. Billy here
dialog: is the computer whiz that created it.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: It's set up so that you can look at
dialog: your account at any time, and
dialog: actually see where your money is
dialog: going. You will be fully aware of any
dialog: fluctuation. Complete transparency.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: And I'1l have access to that account?

speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: LEVI

speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I get to be Wyatt Earp.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Fuck that, Andrew. I'm Wyatt.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No, you're more of a side kick.
dialog: You're more of a Doc Holliday.
speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: TRAVIS

speaker_heading: LEVI

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You can't be Jesse James.
speaker_heading: LEVI

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Doesn't work like that.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Fuck yourselves.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Yeah, you're gonna have to be...
dialog: well...you're fucked.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: I'm Jesse James because I say I
dialog: am.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Whatever, Levi.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: So we've decided? Billy is Billy.
text: Travis is Doc. Levi is Jesse James.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Black Jesse James.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Black Jesse James. And I'm Wyatt
dialog: Earp.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: And what are we called?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I think we're more of a Rat Pack if
dialog: you ask me.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: That's not gonna work because
dialog: everyone wants to be Sinatra.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: And Levi won't wanna be Sammy Davis.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: I'd be Sinatra.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Black Sinatra?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Look--How about we just all shut the
dialog: fuck up and get down to business, huh?
dialog: I wanna get back to the point I was
dialog: trying to make.
text: Everyone quiets down...
speaker_heading: LEVI (CONT'D)
dialog: Gentlemen--We can define this
dialog: century. The internet is allowing us
dialog: to do things we've never done before.
dialog: It's allowing us...to do what we're
dialog: doing.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Scamming the shit outta people.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: We are not "scamming" people.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: How is it different?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Because...these people will never
dialog: feel the affects of losing their
dialog: money. All we're doing is searching
dialog: for oil, and when we find it, we
text: extract a small, insignificant
dialog: share.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Well, insignificant to them.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: These people. .how many people we have
dialog: already?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Seventeen.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Seventeen! Okay, clearly, they're
dialog: all fucking millionaires. They give
dialog: us that one hundred thousand...like
dialog: Peter Williams did...they give us
dialog: that one hundred thousand knowing its
dialog: just going to sit in that account and
dialog: accumulate cash flow. It's money
dialog: they never plan on touching in the
dialog: first place!
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Good point.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: We are taking money from people
dialog: that already have it...people that
dialog: plan on dying rich...and we're giving
dialog: it to the new generation...us!
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Gotta keep it going is all.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Gotta keep it going.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Gotta stay out of trouble.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: We will...as long as we
dialog: communicate...collaborate...and
dialog: continue finding investors. This
dialog: isn't going to work if we let up.
dialog: Seventeen is good. It is. But it's
dialog: not eighteen. And eighteen isn't
dialog: nineteen. And nineteen isn't
dialog: motherfucking twenty.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I think getting that call room was a
dialog: good idea.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: We hired anyone yet?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: We hired the main manager, not the
text: telemarketers.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Okay, well we gotta get on that.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I'm still against it.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Well, before it was just private
dialog: investors we met through
dialog: connections. Now it's cold calls? I
dialog: don't know.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: But the problem is we ran outta
dialog: connections, Andrew.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: It's fine. Anything gets
dialog: fishy...ever...all we do is get rid
dialog: of the call room.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yeah...

dialog: pedestal.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Of course-
speaker_heading: TAN'EL
dialog: -Do you know how I stay on my
dialog: pedestal? By making good decisions.
dialog: By making the right decisions. I
dialog: don't partner with people, rule
dialog: number one. I don't trust anyone. I
dialog: don't get fucked, rule number two.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: That's a pretty good rule.
speaker_heading: TAN'EL

speaker_heading: TAN'EL
dialog: That painting right there cost me one

dialog: was an investment. Because now, I
dialog: have people come over, look at the
dialog: painting, I tell them how much it
dialog: cost, and they are impressed. It
dialog: reflects positively on me. I paid to
dialog: impress people...and it continues to
dialog: pay off. I want the same thing in all

speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: TAN'EL
dialog: I like you boys. I wouldn't have
dialog: given Travis my card if I didn't like

dialog: his money.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Okay, okay.
speaker_heading: TAN'EL
dialog: My point is that I take risks. I
dialog: realize that it takes money to make
dialog: money. But if I don't make money, if
dialog: I lose money, someone is going to get
dialog: their balls cut off. If I invest with
dialog: you gentlemen, and I lose money,

speaker_heading: TELEMARKETER
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Okay, your first mistake. You can't
dialog: ask them how they are right off the
text: bat. Someone calls up and asks how
dialog: you are you're gonna say who the fuck
dialog: is this? The suspicion grows
dialog: immediately. So,
dialog: you have to hit them with your
dialog: identity immediately. "Hi, sir.
dialog: This is Big Fuckin' Pussy at the
dialog: Phoenix Group. I'mcurious, have you
dialog: heard of us?" Of course
dialog: they haven't heard of us, but this

dialog: say no, you
dialog: say “okay, great. Well, let me tell
dialog: you a little bit about what we do."
dialog: Never tell them it's a sales call.
dialog: They'll fuckin' hang up. And never
dialog: tell them you're going
dialog: to make them money. They'11 hang up.
dialog: All you do is tell them that you'd
dialog: like to inform them about our
dialog: services and that if they would like
dialog: more information then you can connect
dialog: them directly to a broker
dialog: for a consultation. You book the
dialog: consultation, that's a lead. That's

speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)

dialog: He calmly
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know what you guys have going
dialog: on...but whatever it is, you can be
dialog: sure that you will be caught
dialog: eventually-
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: -Let me cut you off right there, sir.
text: sips his coffee.
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Our profession is legitimate and we
dialog: have the referrals to prove it.
dialog: There's a reason the SEC isn't on our
dialog: backs.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: They have thousands of registered
dialog: traders to worry about-
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: -You want my contact list of
dialog: investors? You can have it. Every
dialog: one of them will tell you about the
dialog: deposits they get from us every
dialog: month.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: But is it bigger than their
dialog: investment is my question.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Well, Mr...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Northcut.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Northcut. Why don't you write me a
dialog: check and find out?
speaker_heading: MIKE
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: No? Okay, then, if you wanna talk
dialog: further, you know where to find
dialog: me...at the fuckin' coffee shop
dialog: trying to fuckin' relax. Good
dialog: day to you.
text: He slides out and walks away. Mike seems frustrated.
scene_heading: EXT. COFFEE SHOP --
text: Billy walks quickly down the street. He's thinking hard,

scene_heading: INT. ANDREW'S OFFICE -- DAY
text: Andrew is on the phone, having a consultation with a lead...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Sir, we are in the business of
dialog: making money. That's what we do.
dialog: Would you like to talk to some of my

dialog: returns they're getting as we speak?
text: Billy walks in, Andrew holds up his hand.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: I understand. Well, then let me
dialog: talk to your wife about it. (pause)
dialog: Yes, that's fine. Call anytime.
dialog: (pause) But Rick, remember, you're
dialog: dealing with the champs here. You're
dialog: dealing with Andrew Thomas! If you
dialog: were smart, you'd tell your wife that
dialog: if she wants that anniversary in the
dialog: Bahamas this year, you should do
dialog: something with your money and allow
dialog: us to help you. (pause) Okay, Rick.
dialog: I'1l have my phone on me at all times.
dialog: Bye now.
text: He hangs up, then holds his cell phone like a gun, pointing it
dialog: at Billy.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: We are in the old west, Billy. And
dialog: this here, is my damn pistol.
text: He spins it around in his hand.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: We're the cowboys, baby. Modern age
dialog: cowboys.
text: Billy comes over and sits down across from Andrew.
text: Andrew sits down and starts doing some paperwork.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: We are in the desert.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: And I have the quickest draw in the

speaker_heading: LEVI

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Eh. So what's up?

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Andrew...I was down gettin' some
dialog: coffee this morning...and some
dialog: F.B.I. official approached me.
text: Andrew freezes, looks up at him.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: He wanted me to give him information
dialog: and said that I'd get total immunity
dialog: and all this shit.
text: He takes out Mike's business card and flips it onto Andrew's
dialog: desk.
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: They're investigating us, man.
dialog: They're onto us!
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Calm down.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: See, we're making money now. Lots of
dialog: money. And people don't like that.
dialog: They don't wanna see young guys
dialog: making more than they do.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: He was like "you're gonna get
dialog: caught."
text: Andrew ponders...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: This is okay. He wants to talk to
dialog: someone? Send him up to my office
dialog: next time this guy approaches you.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You sure about that?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yes. There's nothing to pin on us.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: This just got me thinking...I don't
dialog: know...how long...
text: He stops. Andrew leans in...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Say what you wanna say, c'mon.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I don't wanna get caught, Andrew.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Knock that off, right now!
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I just-
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: -First off, you knew what you were
dialog: getting into when you got involved.
dialog: You have to believe one hundred
dialog: percent in this or it falls
text: through...or the pyramid crumbles.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I know, I know...this guy...just kind
dialog: of shook me up a little bit. Before
dialog: I thought we were untouchable-
text: Suddenly, Levi walks in...
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Andrew, you call that last lead?
text: He sees the mood...
speaker_heading: LEVI (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: ANDEW
dialog: (bluntly)
dialog: Billy wants to quit.
dialog: What?! No...I...
text: Levi looks at him sternly...
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: You wanna fucking quit?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: No, I just said...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Tell him what you just told me.
text: Billy nervously stands up, takes a deep breath...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: The fuckin' F.B.I. talked to me, man.
dialog: F.B.I.
text: Levi contemplates...
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: What'd you say to them?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: It was just one guy. I told him to
dialog: fuck off, what'd you think?!
speaker_heading: LEV
dialog: Okay, okay...this is fine. I don't
dialog: know what triggered this but this is
dialog: fine.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: And I didn't say I wanna quit, I just
dialog: said...
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Well, I'll clear that up for you right
dialog: now...this is amafia, Bill. And like
dialog: all mafias, you can't quit, you
dialog: can't...it's for life. Blood in,
dialog: blood out kind of thing.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I would never think about quitting.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Remember, we are defining the 21st
dialog: century right now, as we speak. We
dialog: are defining the age of technology
dialog: with this. Jesse James, remember?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I know, I know.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: So are you cool?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: You're cool?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Okay...now...let's make some phone
dialog: calls, huh?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Yeah.
text: Billy gets up and walks out of the room.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: And that F.B.I. official approaches
dialog: you again, you tell him Levi wants to

speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Becky?! You home?!
text: He pauses, waits for an answer, and then quickly opens up a
text: cabinet drawer and takes out a handle of Jack Daniels. He grabs

text: pouring, takes a big swig.
text: It doesn’t go down smooth and he winces.
text: We HEAR footsteps from the other room...
text: Mike quickly tries to hide the alcohol but Becky turns the corner

speaker_heading: BECKY

speaker_heading: BECKY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: tough day.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: A promise is a promise, Mike.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I know, I know. Look—I haven’t had
dialog: a cig in weeks. Can’t we take this
dialog: one at a time?
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: It was your idea to quit! I agreed
dialog: of course, but you can’t just back
dialog: out of it.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Your right. Well, how about I quit
dialog: next week? I need something to keep
dialog: me going. I need something to keep
dialog: my blood boiling.
text: He walks over to her and puts his hands on his shoulders.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m chasing some bad people right now.
dialog: But I don’t think anyone believes me.
dialog: They think I’m wrong..but I’m not..and I’m

speaker_heading: TRAVIS

speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: PLAYER

speaker_heading: PLAYER
dialog: You're lucky I don't break your nose
dialog: right now.
text: Travis scowls and looks away...
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Can someone get this guy a piece of
dialog: gum, fuck.
text: The Player shoves Travis in the chest and he flies back! The
text: rest of the players get up and try to break it up. Travis flies
text: back at him but is stopped by Billy.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You better watch your back! I fuckin'
dialog: know people man! I could buy you
dialog: right now! You
dialog: know how much money I have?! Huh?!

scene_heading: INT. MANSION —
text: They wander into the home and it is gorgeous to say the least.
scene_heading: REAL ESTATE AGENT
dialog: This was actually just put on the market.
dialog: Perfect for a young, rich couple like
dialog: yourself.
text: She laughs.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: How do you know we’re rich? Do I smell
dialog: like money or something?
text: He smiles and sniffs his shirt as a joke.
scene_heading: REAL ESTATE AGENT
dialog: I think I know when you asked to look
dialog: at houses in the two to five million
dialog: dollar range!
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yes of course.
scene_heading: REAL ESTATE AGENT
dialog: How long have you been married?
speaker_heading: ANDREW

scene_heading: REAL ESTATE AGENT

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, MANSION —
speaker_heading: HEATHER

speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT’D)
dialog: I gotta take this.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I thought you said you weren’t gonna

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Baby, please, I have to. This is
dialog: important.
speaker_heading: HEATHER

text: They all look at him. Travis feels uncomfortable...
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
text: No one says anything.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong?
text: Levi leans forward.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: We need to talk to you.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Yeah, about what?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: You're drawing too much attention to
dialog: yourself...to us.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: I don't wanna lecture you,
dialog: Travis...but...we don't need any
dialog: extra attention from anyone. People
dialog: hear you talking about how much money
dialog: you have, they're going to start
dialog: getting interested into where that
text: money is coming from.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Our cover is completely credible.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: It doesn't matter, Travis. We can't
dialog: seem reckless.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: You a little tattle-tale, Bill?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Leave him out of this.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Okay, so what do you want me to say?!
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Just take it easy for a little bit.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Just be smart. Use common sense.
text: Travis takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Shit...alright, fine. You gonna take
dialog: my gambling priviledges away too?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Gamble all you fuckin' want. Lose
dialog: your entire share if it makes you
dialog: happy.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: You know what, fuck you, Levi. You
dialog: always act like you're the leader,
dialog: but let me tell you something, there
dialog: is no fucking leader!
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, OFFICE BUILDING --
text: As they're arguing, Richard wanders up the hallway, going over
dialog: to ask them a question.
text: He hears Travis shouting, and stops by the door.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, OFFICE BUILDING --
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: You wanna be in charge, Travis?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: That's my fucking point! No one is
dialog: in charge! We're a fucking team!
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Travis, just chill out.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: We get busted, we all go down
dialog: together. Together. No one is
dialog: different here. And I might as well
dialog: point something else out...this
dialog: whole fucking scam was my idea! The
dialog: fake accounts, the Ponzi scheme!
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Quiet down.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Sit your ass back down and shut your
dialog: mouth!
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I was the one who thought this shit
dialog: up, man! And don't forget it!
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE BUILDING --
text: Richard is listening closely now, looks confused, squints. He
text: passes over the doorway, blocking a little bit of light going
text: into the room.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, OFFICE BUILDING --
text: The guys continue to argue as Billy watches the doorway...sees
text: the light in the doorway kind of flickering because of Richard.
text: He watches more closely and finally jumps up and rips open the
text: door. He sees Richard, grabs him and throws him into the room.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: What the-
text: Immediately Andrew and Billy toss him into a chair. They all
text: gather around him...
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: What the fuck did you just hear?!
text: Richard is freaked out...
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Nothing, nothing. I was just walking
dialog: by.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Bullshit!
text: Travis wanders away, rubbing his head in frustration.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Richard...be smart here...tell us
dialog: what you heard.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I...I didn't...hear anything.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You're lying, Richard.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: How long were you standing there?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Just for like...a minute.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: A minute! You can hear a lot ina
dialog: minute, Richard.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Dammit!
text: Andrew walks away.
text: Levi contemplates...
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: We gotta kill him.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What?!
text: He tries to jump up but Billy and Andrew grab him again and hold
text: his arms behind his back as he continues to squirm.
text: Levi bends down right in front of his face.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Richard...tell me...what would you
dialog: do right now?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I...I...don't...
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: I'm sorry. We have to kill you.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I don't care what you're doing, I
dialog: dont...I won't tell anyone...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: So you did hear something!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Just the end.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Tell me what you heard, Richard. Tell
dialog: me what you heard and we'll think
dialog: about not killing you.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I just...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Time to talk, c'mon.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I just heard Travis, say, the thing
dialog: about the fake accounts.
text: Travis turns to the group...
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: You're right...we do have to kill
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Guys, guys, please...
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: I'm gonna go get my gun, I'll be right
dialog: back.
text: He turns for a moment...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Wait a second.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You have a gun?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Hell yeah I have a gun.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: For shit like this, what you think?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You're just gonna shoot him right
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Yes! One shot and it's done.
text: He holds his hand like a gun and points it at Richard AND FIRES
text: IT LIKE A GUN AND WE SEE RICHARD IN A DREAMLIKE SEQUENCE BEING
text: SHOT, BUT THEN WE QUICKLY CUT BACK TO REALITY AND SEE HE'S STILL
dialog: ALIVE.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What would we do with the body?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: We'll carry his ass outta here and
dialog: dump it somewhere.
text: CUT TO DREAM SEQUENCE -- THE FOUR GUYS CARRYING RICHARD'S DEAD
text: BODY THROUGH THE HALLS -- QUICKLY CUT BACK TO REALITY.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Hold on. Let's figure this out first.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: There's nothing to figure out! He
dialog: knows! He knows! He knows! He knows!
dialog: He leaves this room and we're all
dialog: dead!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Who am I gonna tell?-
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: -Richard, shut up!
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: How about we just...
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Just what?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I don't know. This is tough.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: No, this isn't tough. This is an easy
dialog: decision in my book.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You don't think anyone's gonna be
dialog: curious why he disappeared?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Not if we do it right.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Everyone knows I work here...people
dialog: will know what happened...
text: Levi jumps back over to Richard and talks an inch from his
dialog: face...
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Say one more word...c'mon...say one
dialog: more...
text: Richard freezes.
text: Levi goes back over to Andrew.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: We can't kill him. The F.B.I.'s all
dialog: over us right now anyway, we don't
dialog: need to give them another reason to
dialog: talk to us.
text: Levi looks back over at Richard...
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: How about this...
text: He walks over to him, talks in a quiet, calm voice...
speaker_heading: LEVI (CONT'D)
dialog: If you tell anyone, if...if...if...

speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Alright...now...go back to work.
text: Richard gets up and runs out of the room.
text: They all look at each other.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: This is a problem.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I think we should like...tap his
dialog: phones or something...
text: Levi nods...
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Not a bad idea.
text: A beat.
text: Travis looks over at them...
speaker_heading: TRAVIS

text: Andrew wanders in behind her, watches her for a moment...
text: She turns and is startled by him...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Oh shit, Andrew. You scared me.

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Wine.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I know it's wine. What year?
speaker_heading: HEATHER

speaker_heading: HEATHER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: HEATHER

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Hey, those are my business partners

speaker_heading: HEATHER

speaker_heading: TRAVIS

speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: It just is...
speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Jonathan, okay.
text: Walter has a cocktail on the table next to him, grabs it and

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: At what point do I cut off the
dialog: conversation?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Keep it going as long as possible.
dialog: Try to set up another meeting. Try
dialog: to get some referrals.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You need to get referrals. Try to get
dialog: a list of everyone they have
dialog: investing.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Why the fuck would they give me that?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Because...they're trying to gain
dialog: credibility. They're trying to get
dialog: you to trust them.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: At least get one.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Say you want to follow up and get a

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Fuck.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: It's fine. We don't need him.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Who do we got right now?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Some CEO of...an accounting

speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: We background check this guy?
text: They don't respond.
speaker_heading: LEVI (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus! We let anyone walk up in here
dialog: now? Background check, background
dialog: check!
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: He seemed credible and usually that's
dialog: Travis' job.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Travis is a fuck up, so let's not use
dialog: that excuse.

speaker_heading: WALTER

scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM --
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: So how you feeling today Mr.
dialog: Mitchell?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Good, good...
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: You feel like making money today?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Today?!
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Well, are you ready to start the
dialog: process of making money? Cuz' that
dialog: can happen right now, yes.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: You gonna buy me dinner before you try
dialog: to fuck me?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Walter...how much do you know about
dialog: us and what we do?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: A little...I saw the website.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: The website doesn't let you know who
dialog: we are. How we work. You can only
dialog: determine that by meeting like we are
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What are your names again?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Levi, Andrew, and that's Billy.
dialog: We're basically brothers here.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Brothers, huh? Don't look like
dialog: brothers.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: As far as you're concerned we are.
dialog: Our company is a family of
dialog: like-minded individuals dedicated to
text: prospering in a vicious and
dialog: competitive world. We look out for
dialog: each other...like brothers...
dialog: we have each other's backs...like
dialog: brothers...and we trust each
dialog: other...like brothers. If you invest
dialog: with us, you will be treated in the
dialog: same fashion.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Well, what concerns me is...I want to
dialog: know where my money is going.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: We don't reveal who we invest with,
dialog: or what stocks we buy, but you can see
dialog: the allocation of funds, per month,
dialog: and also track the returns.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Why can't I see where my money is
dialog: going?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Because then you become a critic, a
dialog: referee. We don't want you to judge
dialog: our expertise, or for that matter,
dialog: spread any information about what
dialog: stocks we feel are quality.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I guess that makes sense.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Of course it makes sense.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm still skeptical though.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: There's nothing to be skeptical
dialog: about, sir. It's not like we're gonna
dialog: take your money, kidnap you, carry
dialog: you into the woods, chop your body up
dialog: into little pieces, cover each limb
dialog: with honey and then wait for the
text: wolves to show up.

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Why is that not possible?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Trust me.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I wanna know, Mike. Why is that not
dialog: possible? What's with the vendetta?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: There's no fucking vendetta!
dialog: Alright, yeah, I'm skeptical

speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: Lot of business majors dying to hear
dialog: some of your secrets.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Well, I don't think I'm giving away

speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: It'd be a good story.
speaker_heading: LEVI

speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: People think I look young..and that’s
dialog: because I am.I’m twenty eight years old.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: And that’s what makes your story so
dialog: intriguing.
scene_heading: INT. ANDREW'S APARTMENT -- DAY

scene_heading: INT. ANDREW'S APARTMENT --
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I'm doing really well right now...as

scene_heading: INT. F.B.I. OFFICE -- NIGHT
dialog: Mike sits

speaker_heading: LEVI (V.O.)

speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: LEVI (V.0.)
dialog: And yet, it's survival of the

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: You have to fight for every breath out

speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: Well, you have business partners,
dialog: don't you?
dialog: He pauses
dialog: He breaks
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Everyone in business...is out for
dialog: themselves...that's a fuckin' fact.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: What advice do you have for the young

speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Ethics are overrated.
text: into laughter.
speaker_heading: LEVI (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm just kidding. No I'mnot. Yes,
dialog: Iam. Okay...my advice? Find your
dialog: niche.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: Does it ever get stressful knowing
dialog: that you are in control and in charge
dialog: of millions and millions of dollars...
dialog: of other people’s money.
text: Levi stares back at him, a slight grin on his face...
text: The journalist stays relentless...
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST (CONT’D)
dialog: And how have you managed to stay so
dialog: consistent in your investments? Is it true
dialog: you guarantee returns?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: There is no way to guarantee returns.
dialog: Who told you that?
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY
text: Mike is standing in front of a projector screen in this small
dialog: conference room.
text: Peter Donnelly is standing in the back of the room with his arms
dialog: crossed.
dialog: Mike is explaining what he thinks our guys are doing...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Basically...what I believe...is that
dialog: it's a form of online banking, but
dialog: they use their own program and their
dialog: own database. For instance, if
dialog: someone gives them one hundred
dialog: thousand dollars, they create an
dialog: “account" for this person. With this
dialog: "account" the investor can check
dialog: their balance, can check
dialog: their gains, losses etc. But what I
dialog: believe they're doing...is setting
dialog: up invisible money. This
dialog: account...this number...is just
dialog: that...a number. It has no monetary
dialog: representation. They actually
dialog: deposit the investment into their own
dialog: account.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: Then how do they give returns to their
dialog: investors?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Well, that's it right there. They're
dialog: feeding money from investor to
dialog: investor. In achain. So when they
dialog: give their investors the returns,
dialog: they are actually depositing money
dialog: into that person's account, but it is
dialog: only a small percentage of what that
dialog: person invested. So technically, as
dialog: long as the investor never decides to
text: walk away, they could be funneling
dialog: their own money back to them forever.
dialog: The group
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Now, is any of this information
dialog: backed up? Confirmed?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It's just speculation at this point,
dialog: sir.
dialog: sighs.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Don't bother us anymore with
dialog: speculation...get some facts.
dialog: Alright, who's next?!
text: Peter walks down the aisle toward the front of the room.
text: Mike starts breathing hard, getting more and more frustrated
text: until he bursts out...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I’m not done!
text: Peter pauses in his tracks.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I’m not done! This is priority! This
dialog: is a high-technology crime! Maybe you’re
dialog: not briefed enough on this material
dialog: Peter but let me tell you..this is the
dialog: twenty-first century and the biggest
dialog: wars we have are the cyber-wars!
text: Addressing the rest of the officials in the room...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Please cover your ears--I’m about
text: to start cussing now.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Sit your fucking ass over in that
dialog: motherfucking chair Northcutt!
text: Mike pauses and then walks over to his chair and sits down.
text: Peter wanders over to the projector screen, examines it and
text: turns around.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: First off, you ever call me Peter
dialog: again and I’ll rip your nose off your
dialog: fucking face. You address me as “sir”
dialog: or you address me as Mister Donnelly.
dialog: I may be attractive and youthful but I have earned
dialog: my status as “Mister.”
dialog: You got that?
text: Mike doesn’t react.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Issue number two..we are not in the business
dialog: of skepticism Mike. We are in the business
dialog: of fact. And I like facts. Facts don’t
dialog: fucking lie, and the only facts you have
dialog: right now, Mike, Mike Northcutt, is that
dialog: you are a novice fucking official that
dialog: enjoys raising his voice to heads of criminal
dialog: investigative divisions.
text: (he begins pacing the aisles)
text: A man is shot with a bullet equals fact.
text: A car crashes into a telephone pole equals
dialog: fact. Tears are wet, fire is hot, ice is cold, fact,
dialog: fact, and fact. You have no facts son,
dialog: you have skepticism and the world is not
dialog: run that way and neither is the Federal
dialog: Bureau of Investigation. This may be the wrong
dialog: Unit for you. Maybe you should transfer
dialog: to Cyber Division and handle internet
dialog: Fraud? You know where they’re stationed?
dialog: (changing tones) Do you wanna know where
dialog: they’re stationed? You want to be in the
dialog: criminal investigative division? This division? You
dialog: need to do some criminal investigating.
dialog: You need to get tangible evidence. So let
dialog: me say it one more time, Mikey, and I hope you can
dialog: contain your tears. Don’t bother us again with
dialog: speculation—get some facts.
dialog: (he heads toward the door)
dialog: Now all of you go turn your teeth into
dialog: fucking fangs and start making some arrests.

speaker_heading: TAN'EL

speaker_heading: LEVI

text: Billy is leaning back in his chair, zoning out. He's taking
text: pieces of computer paper, crushing them into little balls and
text: trying to shoot it into the waste basket near the door. He shoots
text: a few times and misses.
text: He stretches, takes a deep breath, bored.
scene_heading: EXT. RUNWAY, MEXICO -- DAY
text: The plane comes to a smooth stop on the runway.
text: Our guys get out and are met with Tan'el's assistant, standing

text: They all shake his hand and get in.
scene_heading: EXT. RANCH -- DAY
text: Tan'el is sitting in a lawn chair in the back of the ranch. He's
text: wearing a wife-beater, smoking a cigar, and shooting a rifle
text: at a few targets.
text: He fires...BANG! Misses. He reloads. BANG! BANG! He misses
dialog: again.
text: He squints, trying to see if he hit it or not.
text: After a moment, our guys turn the corner, being led by the
dialog: assistant.
text: Tan'el hears them and turns...
speaker_heading: TAN'EL
dialog: Oopa!
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: How you doin' sir?
speaker_heading: TAN'EL
dialog: Good, good. Where's Travis?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
text: He's back home.
dialog: Changing subjects...
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: You a good shot?
text: Tan'el looks down at his rifle.
speaker_heading: TAN'EL
dialog: One of the best!
dialog: He clearly is terrible.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Can I try?
speaker_heading: TAN'EL
dialog: Sure, sure.
text: He hands the gun to Levi. Levi grabs it, seems comfortable with
text: the rifle, walks over in front of the lawn chair, quickly cocks
text: it, points it at a target...BANG! BANG! BANG! He hits three
dialog: straight targets.
text: Tan'el tries to not look impressed.
speaker_heading: TAN'EL (CONT'D)
dialog: Good, good. Almost as good as me!
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: I'm trying.
scene_heading: INT. BILLY'S OFFICE -- SAME TIME
text: Billy is still hanging out in the office. He looks at his watch,
text: then gets up, grabs his jacket, and leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. RANCH -- DAY
text: Andrew is holding the gun now, looking down the sight. He
text: fires...misses...fires...misses.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: You suck, Andrew.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Shut up.
text: He lowers the gun...
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: This seems like a pretty good
dialog: bargaining tool.
speaker_heading: TAN'EL
dialog: It is, it is. I use it in all my
dialog: negotiations!
text: They laugh.
speaker_heading: TAN'EL (CONT'D)
dialog: So...you have my money?
dialog: Silence...a beat.
dialog: Finally...
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Well, that's why we wanted to come
dialog: down here.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: We really want you to continue to work
dialog: with us.
speaker_heading: TAN'EL
dialog: I already explained this. I need that
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Let's try to figure something out
dialog: that works for both of us.
text: Tan'el calmly reaches out for the rifle.
speaker_heading: TAN'EL
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Can I see that for a moment?
text: Andrwe hands it to him.
text: Tan'el quickly grabs it and points it right at Levi's head.
speaker_heading: TAN'EL (CONT'D)
dialog: Give me my money.
text: Levi nervously smiles.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET -- SAME TIME
text: Billy, hands in his pockets, wanders down the street.
text: He passes a deli, stops, and heads inside.
scene_heading: INT. RANCH -- SAME TIME
speaker_heading: TAN'EL
dialog: Everyone is a good shot when they're
text: standing an inch from their target.
dialog: I don't think I can miss from here.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Just calm down, calm down.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Let's talk about this.
speaker_heading: TAN'EL
dialog: I made a mistake. I was too quick to
dialog: invest with you gentlemen. Too
dialog: stupid.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: We can make you money. Just give us
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: TAN'EL
dialog: No! If my money is not in my account
dialog: by next weekend...I will kill you. Is
dialog: that clear? Is that English? I can
dialog: tell you in Spanish if you want?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Well, this wasn't much of a
dialog: negotiation, was it?
speaker_heading: TAN'EL
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Give us two weeks. And just the rest
dialog: of the capitol.
speaker_heading: TAN'EL
dialog: Why two weeks? Why more time?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: We have to organize our accounts.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Yeah, crunch some numbers.
speaker_heading: TAN'EL
dialog: Okay, two weeks.
text: He lowers the gun and smiles.
scene_heading: INT. DELI -- SAME TIME
text: Billy looks over the menu, orders, pays, and takes his seat at
text: a table about ten feet away. He's looking at his cell phone.
text: As he's looking at his phone, a MAN enters through the front
text: entrance. Billy hears him, but doesn't look up.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Hey, Walter, how ya doin'?
text: Billy finally looks up, sees Walter and does a double take. He
text: recognizes him and realizes he's going by a different name...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (smirking)
dialog: Hey, Jonathan...
text: Walter snaps his head over to him, gives a surprised expression
text: and quickly turns back to the cashier.
text: Billy flashes a huge smile, knows he was spying on them.
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice one.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RUNWAY -- DAY
text: Andrew and Levi walk down the runway.
text: Levi has his phone to his ear...
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Billy, what's up?
scene_heading: INT. BILLY'S HOUSE -- SAME TIME
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You guys landed yet?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: We're just taking off. Be there in
dialog: a few hours.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Okay...well...when you land...I need
dialog: you guys to come over to my house.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I'll explain when you get here.
text: He hangs up.
text: Levi lowers the cell phone, looks oddly over at Andrew.
scene_heading: EXT. BILLY'S HOUSE --
text: They walk up to the front door and knock. After only a moment,
text: Billy rips the door open, he's biting his nails.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: So what's going, Billy?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I have to show you something.
text: The guys look confused. Billy turns and leads them through his
text: house and over to a bedroom.
text: They open the door next to him...
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM -
text: Sitting there on the far side of the room is Walter, a blindfold
text: around his eyes, his mouth bleeding, and his arms tied behind
dialog: his back.
text: Andrew quickly slams the door shut again...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What the hell is that?!
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: That's Walter, man.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Walter?!
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: He's F.B.I. He was spying on us.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What are you talking about?!
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Remember Jonathan Mitchell? The
dialog: investor of that accounting firm we
dialog: met last week?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: That's him!
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: So why the hell is he tied up in your
dialog: house, Billy?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I didn't know what to do.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Oh my god.
text: Andrew walks away, rubs his forehead.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Billy, Billy...listen to me for a
dialog: second. Did anyone see you bring this
dialog: guy here?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Are you sure about that?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Yes, positive.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What the hell were you thinking?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I was thinking I was gonna save our
dialog: asses by catching a spy!
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: This is insane.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: But Billy...what do we do now, huh?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I don't know!
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Dammit.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Where’s Travis? Does he know about this?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: He didn’t answer.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Billy...I appreciate you looking out
dialog: for us. I know you thought this was
dialog: the right thing to do, but this was
dialog: not the right thing to do. This was
dialog: the wrong thing to do.
text: Billy rubs his eyes.
text: Andrew opens the door again and studies Walter...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Is he knocked out?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Yeah, I think so. I hit him pretty
dialog: hard.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: So let's just dump him somewhere.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Then he'll just come back and arrest
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: No, no. I blindfolded him right away,
text: he doesn't know where he is.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Will he recognize you from our
dialog: company?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You don't think so?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Yeah. He only saw me for a moment.
dialog: He probably won't remember anything.
text: Andrew closes the door.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: We need to worry about Tan'el right
dialog: now, we don't have time to think about
dialog: a freaking hostage!
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Billy's gonna handle this.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: You're gonna fuckin' dump him back
dialog: off somewhere, somewhere in this
dialog: desert so no one sees your ass doing
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: walright...okay.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Got it?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Yeah, got it.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Somebody call Travis!
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT -- EVENING
text: All is quiet until...Billy's flies by and screeches to a stop.
text: No one is around.
text: Billy quickly jumps out and walks around to the side of the car.
text: He opens the door, grabs Walter by the arms and drags him out
text: into the desert.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What the hell?! You better run!
dialog: You're going to jail for a long time,
dialog: son!
text: His blindfold is still on, he has no clue who Billy is...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Sure about that?
text: Billy jumps into the driver's seat and takes off.
text: Walter tries to get to his feet, but trips and falls.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Our guys sit around the room.
text: Andrew's pacing back and forth.
text: Travis is there.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Tan'el...
text: No one says anything.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: There's nothing we can do with him.
dialog: We have to bite the bullet on this
dialog: one. Cut our spending and continue
dialog: to push forward, finding more people.
dialog: We haven't even asked any clients to
dialog: refer us yet. We should work those
dialog: connections more.
dialog: A beat...
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Tan'el...what if...what if we killed
dialog: him...kept the money.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Are you fuckin' serious? Levi get you
dialog: on that coke or what?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: First of all, fuck off. Secondly,
dialog: that's not a bad idea, Travis.
text: Billy doesn't say anything.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Are you insane?!
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: You wouldn't kill him for ten million
dialog: dollars?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No! What the-where the hell am I?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: It's definitely intriguing.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Intriguing?! You plan to just walk
dialog: in there, say "hey, howya' doin?" and
dialog: then cap his ass? You don't think
dialog: anyone's gonna have a problem with
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Well, obviously, we'd be smarter
dialog: about it than that.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: What would you do for ten million
dialog: dollars, Andrew?
text: He doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: (overly articulate)
dialog: What would you do for ten million
dialog: dollars, Andrew? Tell me.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Shit...I don't know! Not murder!
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Then I'll do it, or Levi, or Billy.
speaker_heading: DREAM SEQUENCE:
text: We see Tan'el smoking a cigar, laughing, and then Levi, Travis
text: and Billy come up behind him. Levi draws a gun and POINTS IT
speaker_heading: AT HIM.
text: ON THE SOUND OF THE TRIGGER WE CUT BACK TO...
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM --
dialog: Silence.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: You stay here, be a pussy.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I don't consider that being a pussy
dialog: you head-case. I consider that
dialog: rational thinking.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Travis is right though...you don't
dialog: have to be involved.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I'm involved no matter what, so stop
dialog: saying that. If I know about it, and
dialog: I don't stop it, I'm involved.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I just don't see any other way.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: How about giving him his money back?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: We wire him his ten mill, we suck it
dialog: up, and move on. We haven't spent
dialog: that much of it any way.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, I gotta get out of here. I'm
dialog: not having this conversation.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Now you quitting?
text: Andrew stops...
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (mockingly)
dialog: You can't quit, right? This isa
dialog: mafia...blood in...
text: No one responds.
text: He leaves.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You don't really wanna murder Tan'el,
dialog: do you?
text: Travis leans back in his chair.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I think it should be an option.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I'm worried about Andrew, I am.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: You don't need to be.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I don't know...I mean...I thought
dialog: I was feelin' skeptical but
dialog: Andrew...I think everything's
dialog: starting to get to him. What if he
dialog: tells someone?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Well, then we'll probably know about
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: (frankly)
dialog: I tapped his phones and miked his
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: What? Are you kidding?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: No. I'm serious.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Why?!
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Wait-You tap my shit?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: You're a liar.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: I didn't, Travis! I trust you.
dialog: Andrew, I don't trust. Not lately.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I don't like that, man. That's fucked
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: I'm lookin' out for us, okay?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: When did you tap his phones?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Same time I did Richard's. If he's
dialog: so trust worthy then we should have
dialog: nothing to worry about, right?
dialog: Levi's point kind of makes sense.
text: The group sits in silence.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, ANDREW'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: Heather sits on the floor, looking at some CD's.
text: She pops one into the stereo and turns it upa little bit...as...
text: Andrew walks in the front door. He's slouching, looks tired.
text: Heather hears him...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Hey baby.
text: He wanders into the living room...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
text: Just listening to some music.
text: He collapses onto the couch.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Some day, I bet we won't even have
dialog: CD's.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Well, first we had records, then
dialog: tapes, now CD's, I mean it's the year
dialog: two thousand, I'm sure they're gonna
dialog: think of something.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Maybe like a little CD player, but it
dialog: has all your music without putting
dialog: any CD's in.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: That's just crazy.
text: She laughs.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Whatever.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Wasn't it weird how everyone thought
dialog: Y2K was gonna be the end of the world?
dialog: Everyone bought all this canned food,
dialog: searched for bomb shelters, and then
dialog: the clock struck midnight and nothing
dialog: fuckin' happened. Nothing. How can
dialog: people be so wrong about something?
dialog: Just completely wrong.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I was worried.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No way! You were?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: A little bit. You weren't?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You know, you think you're a tough
dialog: guy, but I know you're really just a
dialog: big baby.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (playfully)
dialog: Dem's fightin' words.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I could take you.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Really, huh?
text: She gets up and jumps on him.
text: They wrestle for a moment and it ends with Andrew holding her.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: So, where are we having the wedding?
dialog: We haven't even decided yet.
text: Andrew grows serious...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: How about...Jamaica?
text: He doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: HEATHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, not Jamaica.
text: He takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: We might have to push it back for
dialog: awhile.
text: She perks up and turns to him...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Well...we had some...problems...at
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: What kind of problems?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: We lost some money.
text: Heather looks concerned.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I don't wanna get into it...but...
dialog: I just want you to know that I'm
dialog: trying to give you the wedding of your
dialog: dreams...I wanna make sure it's
dialog: perfect. So I'm going to need more
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Can you tell me what happened?
text: He takes another breath...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Remember that big investment we got?
dialog: Well, we lost it.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You lost it? How?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: We had to give it back.
text: He gets up and starts pacing, getting increasingly stressed out.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: I really didn't wanna talk about
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: If we're going to get married, I
dialog: deserve to know everything about your
dialog: life, don't I?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yes, but...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You can talk to your wife, Andrew.
dialog: What are you hiding?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I'm not hiding anything.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Sure sounds like it.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: It's just...complicated...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I want to trust you. I have to trust
dialog: you...you have to trust me.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I trust you.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Then tell me what's going on.
text: He turns to her. He's about to crack.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Everything I do...I'm not
dialog: perfect...I've made mistakes...but I
dialog: think...I don't know...I'm sick of
dialog: being the bad guy.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Bad guy?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What I'm about to tell you, you can't
dialog: repeat, you can't question, and I
dialog: want you to know that I'm trying to
dialog: make it right. Okay?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Okay. You can trust me.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I can trust you?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Of course. I love you.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Well, I'm telling you this because I
dialog: love you too. I love you more than
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Just tell me.
text: He walks over and sits down next to her...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Our company...baby...our company is
dialog: a fucking fraud. We don't invest,
dialog: we're not stock brokers, we're
dialog: frauds! What we do...we take peoples
dialog: investments and then pay them back
dialog: small portions of their own money
dialog: pretending it's their interest. But
dialog: there is no fucking interest! We're
dialog: spending their money!
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: But...how...wouldn't you run out?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Not if you keep getting investors!
dialog: Especially if the investments keep
dialog: getting bigger! And we keep getting
dialog: them! Baby...we're stealing their
dialog: money! This house is stolen!
dialog: Everything in here! Everything I buy
dialog: you! It's all a scam, baby!
text: He gets up and starts pacing.
text: He notices she's starting to get nervous.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: But Heather...see...the only reason
dialog: I'm telling you this is because I'm
dialog: gonna stop, I'm quitting, I'm not
dialog: gonna be a criminal anymore.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: What if someone finds out?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No one's gonna find out, ever. No one
dialog: knows. No one will ever know.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I think you should tell someone.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: And go to jail?! Are you insane?!
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Are they gonna let you just walk away?
text: Andrew ponders...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No, not exactly. I'm still figuring
dialog: that out.
text: Heather starts to tear up.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: Heather--Don't cry. Everything's
dialog: gonna be fine. Really. I promise.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I don't want anything to happen to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Nothing's gonna happen to me.
dialog: We're going to be alright.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: How are you gonna protect yourself?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: There is one option...a backup
dialog: plan...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: If all else fails, and I have to get
dialog: out, if I need to do something
dialog: drastic...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: There's this F.B.I. agent that's
dialog: been trying to get information from
dialog: us. He told us...he told
dialog: Billy...that...he'd grant immunity
dialog: to anyone who disclosed information
dialog: about our company, if it lead to

speaker_heading: TRAVIS

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM, ANDREW'S HOUSE -- DAY

scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR --

scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM --
text: Levi, Billy, and Travis sit around the conference table with

speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: Can you close the door?
text: Andrew closes the door.
text: As he does, Levi stands up and smoothly takes out a gun and points

text: freezes.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What the fuck?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Sit down.
text: Andrew puts his hands up and wanders over to a chair.
text: He sits down and Travis immediately whips out some duct tape,
text: rips off a large piece and slaps it across Andrew's mouth. He
text: jerks up but Billy grabs his arms and holds them behind the
text: chair. Travis takes the rest of the duct tape and starts
text: wrapping it around his body and the chair.
text: Levi leans in...
speaker_heading: LEVI (CONT'D)
dialog: Andrew, Andrew, Andrew. We have a
dialog: problem.
text: Andrew fights for a moment...
speaker_heading: LEVI (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know why we're doing this?
text: He obviously can't respond...
speaker_heading: LEVI (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought we were brothers. I thought
dialog: we were family. We had a circle of
dialog: trust here, Andrew. But you know what
dialog: you did? You broke that bond. You
dialog: broke the motherfuckin' trust
dialog: circle, Andrew.
text: Andrew's eyes look confused.
speaker_heading: LEVI (CONT'D)
dialog: You were gonna sell us out. You were
dialog: gonna tell the F.B.I. and fuck us!
text: He shakes his head furiously.
speaker_heading: LEVI (CONT'D)
dialog: You can't deny that!
dialog: I...hear...everything. I have tiny
dialog: little eyeballs everywhere. This
dialog: isn't easy for us, Andrew. This is
dialog: hard....very, very hard. We don't
dialog: wanna have to kill you...but...I
dialog: think we have to. I think we have to
dialog: kill your girl too.
text: Andrew is breathing heavily, and in one big burst of strength
text: tries to rip out of the duct tape. He kind of breaks some of
text: it, and Travis and Billy hold him back down.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Use more duct tape, shit.
text: Billy holds him down as Travis applies more tape.
speaker_heading: LEVI (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe I'm wrong here. Maybe I
dialog: shouldn't kill you. Do you have a
dialog: better idea? A better option? Cuz
dialog: we don't. We're not going to jail,
dialog: Andrew. We're not gonna let you sell
dialog: us out.
text: Andrew is trying to say something, we hear it muffled by the
dialog: tape.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Maybe we should let him say
dialog: something.
text: Levi thinks about it...finally...rips the duct tape off of his
dialog: mouth.
text: Andrew yells out in pain.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Talk, talk, talk.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (through breaths)
dialog: I don't...know...what the hell
dialog: you're talking about.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Andrew...I miked your house.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: I...miked...your...house. You were
dialog: going to rat us out.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What? No! No, I wasn't!
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: We fucking heard you.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I wasn't serious! I would never
dialog: do that!
text: He motions to Travis to cover his mouth up again. Travis quickly
dialog: does...
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: No denying it now, sir. I'm sorry.
text: Levi wanders over to the window.
speaker_heading: LEVI (CONT'D)
dialog: You've put us in a very difficult
dialog: position.
text: He clutches his gun in his hands, calmly walks over to Andrew,
text: and WHACK! He hits him in the face with the back of his gun
text: and knocks him out.
scene_heading: FADE TO BLACK:
text: WE HEAR A RUSTLING AROUND, BREATHING, FINALLY, BRIGHTNESS...
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- DAY
text: Andrew was in the back of a trunk, his face bruised and cut.
text: His hands are tied behind his back and he still has duct tape
text: over his mouth. Billy has just popped the trunk.
text: They're on top of a parking garage, no other cars around.
text: Billy is leaning up against the car.
text: He takes out a cigarette and lights it.
text: Andrew squirms for a moment and then realizes he can't free
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I don't know how we got here, man.
dialog: I feel like I'm in a fucking
dialog: nightmare...and I'm just waiting to
dialog: wake up from this shit.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: They're looking for Heather right
dialog: now, Andrew. And me? I'm supposed
dialog: to get rid of you. I'm supposed to
dialog: kill you. I'm supposed to kill one
dialog: of my best friends!
text: Billy rubs his head.
text: Andrew fights harder to untie himself but it's useless.
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: The first outlaws of the 21st
dialog: century, huh? It sounds
dialog: romantic...but...all this shit...
dialog: everything we've been doing for the
dialog: last two years...it's all fucked up.
dialog: We're all insane, you know that? To
dialog: do what we've been doing? You have
dialog: to be wired a little
dialog: differently up here to go through
dialog: with any of this stuff. You know...my
dialog: goal...was always just about making
dialog: money...make as
dialog: much money as you can...make all the
dialog: money in the world...prove to people
dialog: and myself that I could do it. Why?
dialog: Probably cuz it was important to my
dialog: parents, I guess. But, one day I
dialog: finally realized
dialog: that isn't what makes me happy. I
dialog: still don't know what does
dialog: though...I'm still trying to figure
dialog: that out.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: You're one of my best friends,
dialog: Andrew. I could never kill you...I
dialog: could never kill anyone. Levi?
dialog: Travis? They could kill.
dialog: They might have already killed her.
dialog: I don't know. But...that's for you
dialog: to figure out I guess.
text: He tosses his cigarette away, reaches over and helps Andrew out
text: of the trunk. Andrew's feet and hands are tied and he collapses
text: onto the ground.
text: Billy stands over him...
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm leaving, Andrew. Billy the Kid
dialog: isn't gonna die young. Billy the Kid
dialog: is running off into the sunset. You
dialog: guys? I don't know what's going to
dialog: happen. I don't wanna know. I don't
dialog: wanna be here anymore. I wanna
dialog: change, I wanna be somebody else,
dialog: have a different
dialog: life.
text: He takes out a small knife and unties his feet and hands.
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wyatt Earp, huh? Good luck, man.
dialog: Take care of yourself.
text: He tosses Andrew's cellphone into his lap, rushes over to the
text: driver's seat and gets in. Andrew jumps up and rips the duct
dialog: tape off his mouth...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Billy! Wait! Where are they?! Where
dialog: are they?!
text: He jogs after the car but Billy quickly peels away and is gone.
text: He stops and looks down at his cellphone.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PARKING GARAGE -- LATER
text: Andrew dials Heather's number, and rushes down the stairs.
text: He listens for a moment, but the answering clicks on...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Fuck!
text: He continues down the stairs. Dials again...answering machine.
text: He reaches the bottom of the stairs and takes off into a full
dialog: speed sprint.
text: Mid-stride, he dials again...
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS -- LATER
text: Andrew runs along the city street, breathing hard, sweating,
text: scanning the area for a taxi.
text: He sees one and darts into the street to flag it down. He waves
text: his arms wildly into the air. The taxi slams on its brakes.
dialog: cut TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ANDREW'S HOUSE -- LATER
text: Levi and Travis are parked across the street waiting in their
dialog: car.
text: Travis lights a cigarette.
text: They wait, not talking to each other, Levi's eyes fixed on the
text: front door.
dialog: cut TO:
scene_heading: INT. TAXI -- EVENING
text: Andrew is breathing hard, continues to dial her number and still
dialog: no answer.
text: He reaches into his pocket, grabs his wallet and opens it. He
text: takes out Mike's business card and looks at it.
text: Finally, he dials the number.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Hello? Mike Northcut? (pause) Yes,
dialog: this is Andrew Thomas with the
dialog: Phoenix Group. (pause) I have
dialog: something to talk to you about.
scene_heading: EXT. ANDREW'S HOUSE -- EVENING
text: The taxi pulls up to his house and Andrew jumps out. He doesn't
text: pay the driver and just runs toward the house.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Hey! You owe me...
text: He trails off as Andrew reaches the front door. He opens it...it
dialog: was unlocked.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Heather?!
text: He jogs into the kitchen, no one. He jogs into the living room...
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, ANDREW'S HOUSE --
text: Levi and Travis are standing there, Levi holding a gun...
text: Andrew sees them and freezes...
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: What the...
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Shit! I told you I should do it!
text: Levi doesn't respond to him.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Where's my wife?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: You tell me. We've been waiting for
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Where's Billy?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: He left.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: What'd you mean "he left?"
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: He's gone! He bailed! He doesn't
dialog: wanna be a part of this anymore...
dialog: just like me.
text: Levi raises his gun to Andrew...
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Too bad.
text: Andrew puts his hands up...
dialog: Levi kind
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You think me and Billy are the only
dialog: ones who wanted out? Travis was gonna
dialog: do the same thing I was!
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Shut the fuck up.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I'm serious, Levi! He said you were
text: getting out of control.
text: of looks over at Travis...
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Shoot him, please.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: He told Billy too! He always hated
dialog: that you were the leader! Remember?!
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Gimme the gun, please, I'll shoot
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: What's he talking about?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: He's trying to save his ass, what'd
dialog: you think?! Fucking kill him, man,
dialog: and lets get outta here!
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: It's the truth, Levi! Ask Billy!
dialog: It's true! He always hated how you
dialog: were Jesse James and shit, the
dialog: leader...isn't that right Travis?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Shut your fucking mouth, Andrew.
dialog: Levi! Gimme the gun!
text: He lunges for it, but Levi steps back and points it at him.
text: They freeze there for a moment.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: What're you doing?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Maybe I should just kill both of you?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Yeah, fuckin' maybe.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: You really gonna let him manipulate
dialog: you like this? Are you that weak?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: I forgot...do I trust you?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: You're so fucking paranoid, man.
text: Travis takes out a cigarette and lights it.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You need to figure some shit out for
dialog: yourself, because if you can't trust
dialog: me, you can't trust anyone.
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Yeah, maybe I can't trust anyone.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: You know...I always thought I had
dialog: some problems...but...compared to
dialog: you...
scene_heading: EXT. ANDREW'S HOUSE -- SAME TIME
text: A car pulls up to the side garage...and out steps Heather.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, ANDREW'S HOUSE --
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Is this what you wanted, Andrew?
dialog: You wanted this thing to
dialog: self-destruct? We were on top of the
dialog: world, you realize that?
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: We still are...
text: Suddenly, Heather crosses into the living room, sees them
text: standing there, and SCREAMS!
text: Her high-pitched scream startles Levi and he SHOOTS TRAVIS!
dialog: BANG!
text: The bullet slices through Travis' chest, his cigarette drops
text: from his mouth.
text: In this instance, Andrew spins around, and grabs Heather...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: RUN!
text: Levi looks over at them but rushes over to Travis...
speaker_heading: LEVI
dialog: Shit! Shit!
text: Travis is coughing up blood, as Levi leans down next to him.
speaker_heading: LEVI (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn't...mean...
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (coughing)
dialog: This feels...pretty real.
scene_heading: EXT. ANDREW'S HOUSE --
text: Andrew and Heather run out to her car...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Gimme the keys!
text: She tosses the keys to him, and they pile in.

scene_heading: EXT. ANDREW'S HOUSE --
text: Levi makes it outside in time to see Andrew and Heather drive
text: down the street.
scene_heading: INT. CAR -- LATER
text: Andrew and Heather drive down the street, Andrew pulls the car
text: over on the side of the road. He unbuckles his seat belt, reaches
text: over and they hug...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Baby, I love you.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I'm scared...what's going on...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: It's okay...everything is taken care
dialog: of now...we're gonna be alright...

text: EXTREME CLOSE-UP ON A FEW BULLETS BEING LOADED INTO A CHAMBER.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE -- NIGHT
text: (SCENE FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE)
text: WE ARE WIDE on this darkly lit office. A giant glass wall
text: overlooks the bright, city lights of Phoenix, Arizona.
text: Standing in the middle of the room is a MAN, that we now identify
dialog: as Levi.
text: He is holding a gun in his hands...clutching it tightly.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HALLWAY -- NIGHT
text: WE ARE CENTERED ON A WHITE HALLWAY -- THREE MEN, F.B.I.
text: OFFICIALS, suddenly rush around the corner.
text: We now identify one of the men as Mike Northcut.
text: They're holding a few folders, walking briskly...
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL #1
dialog: He's ready-
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: -Full confession?
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL #1
dialog: Full confession.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL #3
dialog: He wants total immunity.
text: They turn the corner and enter a small dark room, where a single
text: light shines over a MAN at a table, that we now identify as
dialog: Andrew.
text: The three men pull up chairs across from him.
text: One of them pulls out a small recording device, sets it up in
text: front of Andrew, and hits record.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Someone went to work on that eye.
text: He doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ve been chasing you guys for awhile
dialog: now, huh?
dialog: Still no response...
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: But I always knew..I always knew.
text: He reaches over and hits record on the recording device.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay...tell us what happened...
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE -- NIGHT
text: Levi continues to clutch the gun, staring out at the city.
text: Finally, in one swift movement, he raises it to his head and
dialog: fires.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM --
text: Andrew leans into the light...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Well, first, I wanna know I have
dialog: immunity.
text: Mike looks around.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Sir, we actually can't promise that
dialog: at this time, but I assure you, that
dialog: your cooperation will favor you in
dialog: court sentencing-
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: -What if I told you that I could help
dialog: bring in another person
dialog: too...someone you might be very
dialog: interested in bringing in. Would
dialog: that give me immunity?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Who?
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT -- DAY
text: There are two SUV's parked in the middle of the desert. After
text: a moment, we see Andrew get out of one of the cars.
text: He walks out into the middle of the two cars and waits for a
text: moment, until the doors of the other car open and out steps
text: Tan'el and his assistant.
text: Andrew flashes a huge fake smile.
speaker_heading: TAN'EL
dialog: My favorite broker!
text: Andrew tosses them a duffle bag...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Ten million. Back like we told you.
speaker_heading: TAN'EL
dialog: My man! And don't think I won't want
dialog: to invest with you guys again.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I don't think that's gonna happen.
speaker_heading: TAN'EL
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I'm quitting the business. Moving
dialog: away for awhile.
speaker_heading: TAN'EL
dialog: Too bad. Well, I hope you live a good
dialog: life my friend.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You as well.
text: They shake and Andrew turns and heads back to his car.
text: He gets in as Tan'el wanders back to his car.
text: Andrew peels out and dust flies up. Before Tan'el is even in
text: the car, Andrew is already booking out of there. Finally, after
text: Andrew's car is about fifty yards away, WE SEE FOUR BLACK SUV'S
text: APPEAR FROM EACH ANGLE HEADING RIGHT TOWARD TAN'EL'S VEHICLE.
text: Tan'el looks around, scared, not knowing what's going on.
scene_heading: INT. F.B.I SUV --

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yeah, we just gotta find where that
text: home is now.
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Well, what are you thinking...Vegas?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Can we afford Vegas?
text: Heather reveals the duffle bag with the one million dollars in
dialog: cash...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: We got about one million, so how long
dialog: can that last in Vegas?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I guess we'll find out.
text: They both laugh.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT --
text: THEY FLY THROUGH THE DESERT AND FINALLY REACH A PAVED ROAD. WE
text: WATCH THEM DISAPPEAR INTO THE DISTANCE.
text: We hear a voice over from an earlier scene as they drive away
dialog: and we see the desert, old west landscape...
speaker_heading: LEVI (V.0.)
dialog: Welcome to the twenty-first century,
dialog: gentlemen.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (V.O.)
