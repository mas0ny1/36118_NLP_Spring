text: The QUICK CUTS end with MAX:
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: My mom's a teacher.
text: As Max starts to sit:
speaker_heading: MS. BERRY
dialog: And your dad?
speaker_heading: MAX
speaker_heading: (HESITANT)
dialog: My dad? He's . . . a liar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MS. BERRY
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: A liar? I don't think you
dialog: mean "a liar."
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Well... he wears a suit and
text: goes to court and talks to the
dialog: judge and--
speaker_heading: MS. BERRY
speaker_heading: (RELIEVED)
dialog: Oh! I see-- you mean he's a
dialog: lawyer.
text: Max shrugs.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM .-- DAY
dialog: 
text: FLETCHER REID, early 30's, stands before the JUDGE. His
text: manner is utterly genuine and convincing.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
text: A dark street. . . a stormy
dialog: night... two desperate men
dialog: struggle... one man is taken
dialog: to the hospital, the other to
dialog: ja il. The prosecutor wants
dialog: you to believe this is an
text: open-and-shut case of a poor
text: man, brutally victimized.
text: He nods at the victim - - a fragile OLD MAN in his 70's.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, for once I agree with
dialog: t he prosecutor. This is an
dialog: open-and shut case -- but the
dialog: true victim is my client.
text: Fletcher's CLIENT is a 250 pound brute in a suit.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Put yourself in his shoes for
text: a moment--walking home from
text: church, alone, in a
dialog: frightening part of the
dialog: suburbs.
text: As he describes his client's movements, Fletcher ACTS THEM
speaker_heading: OUT:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: You're nervous, timid, looking
dialog: over your shoulder -- when
dialog: suddenly, you encounter him--
dialog: (pointing at the
dialog: old man)
text: pouncing from the shadows.
dialog: You quiver in fear. The
text: streetlight flashes on
text: something shiny in his hand--
dialog: a knife?
text: Suddenly Fletcher becomes the attacker, brandishing a
text: weapon. The jurors RECOIL.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: And in that terrifying instant
dialog: you do what any respectable
dialog: citizen would -- you defend
dialog: y ou rse lf. Only after you
text: shatter his arm and collarbone
dialog: do you realize it's all a
dialog: mistake... the man was merely
text: walking away from an ATM
text: machine, the apparent flash of
text: metal caused by his bank card.
text: He reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (CONCERNED)
dialog: As you stand over his
dialog: crumpled, though potentially
dialog: still-dangerous form, your
dialog: he art goes out to him. You
dialog: want to help. First, you
dialog: gather up the many bills he
dialog: dropped, to stop them from
dialog: bl owi ng away. Second, in an
dialog: effort to get the name and
dialog: number of someone to notify,
dialog: you take his wallet. Finally,
dialog: you leap into the man's Lexus
dialog: to head for assistance, when
text: suddenly a police car speeds
dialog: up. You breathe a sigh of
dialog: relief: "Someone to look -after
dialog: the injured man! Oh joy!"
dialog: But do the police applaud your
dialog: initiative? Do they hail your
dialog: heroism? No-- they arrest you
dialog: and throw you in the slammer!
text: He walks along the jury box:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: 路 And why? Why does the State
dialog: turn its massive power against
dialog: this individual?
dialog: (takes an
speaker_heading: IMPRESSIVE
dialog: moment, then
dialog: answers his own
speaker_heading: QUESTION:)
dialog: Discrimination,
dialog: (to a black
speaker_heading: JUROR)
dialog: But this time it's not based
dialog: on race.
dialog: (to a female
speaker_heading: JUROR)
dialog: Not based on gender.
dialog: (to a man wearing
dialog: a crucifix)
dialog: Not based on religion,
dialog: (to a heavy set
speaker_heading: JUROR)
dialog: No--this time it's
dialog: discrimination based on size!
dialog: . I know what the prosecution
dialog: wants you to think - - i t ' s
dialog: always the big guy's fault.
dialog: Is that what we've come to as
dialog: a society -- persecuting
dialog: people because they're large?
text: Fletcher points accusingly at the opposition.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Shame on you, Mister
dialog: Prosecutor! Shame on you!
dialog: (turning back to
speaker_heading: JURY)
dialog: The state is trying to
dialog: barbeque my client on the spit
dialog: of Justice. Only you can douse
text: the flames. The decision is
dialog: your s. And please...don't let
dialog: your emotions run away with
dialog: y ou . The fact that my client
text: is a family man, raising his
dialog: sons alone after the tragic
dialog: death of their mother, has
dialog: absolutely no bearing on this
dialog: case.
text: In the front row we see two sad-faced YOUNG CHILDREN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Instead, let cold reason be
dialog: your guide as you decide the
dialog: fate of this church-going,
dialog: orphan-rasing widower!
text: Fletcher returns to his seat. Jurors, dab their eyes.

speaker_heading: BEGGAR
dialog: Could you spare some?

speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Unquestionably.

speaker_heading: BEGGAR
dialog: Will you?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BEGGAR
dialog: How come?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Because I resent your
dialog: p re sen ce. You fill me with an
dialog: unpleasant mixture of disgust
dialog: and guilt. Further, I don't
dialog: believe you'll use the money
dialog: for food, but I believe you'll
dialog: use it for, at worst, drugs,
dialog: or, at best, whiskey, or
dialog: . cigarettes. Also, I'm cheap.

speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Fifty per cent of your estate.
text: Richard is SHOCKED.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Fifty per cent? With a pre-
dialog: nup and proof of adultery?
dialog: What's your case?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Our case is simply this. . .
text: Fletcher opens his mouth to enlighten her -- but he CAN'T
text: GET THE WORDS OUT. He tries to FORCE OUT SOUNDS, but
text: succeeds only in looking like a fish gasping on dry land.
speaker_heading: DANA .
dialog: Interesting, though based on
dialog: your track record, I expected
dialog: a little more.
text: Nearing panic, Fletcher whirls to his BRIEFCASE and grabs
dialog: the brief.
text: FLETCHER ..
dialog: Wa it! Wait! I've got it in
dialog: writing!
text: But when Dana tries to take the document, the astonished
text: Fletcher finds himself PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO RELEASE IT.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Let go!
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: I'm trying!
dialog: 
text: He INVOLUNTARILY snatches the document away and IT PULLS

speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Fine, thank you.
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
dialog: And you, Mr. Reid?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Well, I'm a little upset about
dialog: a bad sexual episode I had
dialog: last night--
text: Fletcher screeches to a standstill, suddenly aware of what
text: he just said. After an awkward silence--
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
speaker_heading: (DRYLY)
dialog: Well, you're still young.
dialog: It'll happen more and more.
dialog: In the meantime, what do you
dialog: say we get. down to business?
dialog: First, Mr. Reid, I see that
dialog: your client was previously
dialog: represented by Mr. Rand of
dialog: your office.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Yes, Your Honor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
dialog: I take it you're seeking to
dialog: substitute in as counsel?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Yes, Your Honor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
dialog: Fine , fine. And for the
dialog: record, the reason is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Mr. Rand had severe ethical
dialog: objections to my client's
dialog: case.
text: Fletcher is incredulous. Somehow his greatest asset in the
text: world, his mouth, has become his worst enemy.
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
dialog: I take it you don't share the
dialog: same ethical objections, Mr.
dialog: Reid?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: I have lower standards, Your
dialog: Honor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
dialog: I see. Well, if Mrs. Cole
dialog: wants the substitution of
dialog: counsel, I'll allow it. Is
dialog: that what you want, Mrs. Cole?
text: Virginia looks to the judge, then to Fletcher, whose
text: unorthodox syle seemed so brilliant earlier.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
speaker_heading: (UNSURE)
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: (aside, to
speaker_heading: FLETCHER)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
speaker_heading: (WORRIED)
dialog: .
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: (to judge, with
speaker_heading: SOME
speaker_heading: DESPERATION)
dialog: Your Honor, I ' d like a

scene_heading: JUDGE STEVENS "
dialog: This case has already been
dialog: delayed several times, Mr.
dialog: Reid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: I realize that, Your Honor,
dialog: but I ' d really, really, really
text: like a continuance.
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
dialog: I'll have to hear good cause,

dialog: problem?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER'S P.O.V.
dialog: 
text: The ROOM begins to SPIN slowly -- then faster -- then
dialog: faster -- until we wind up squarely on --
speaker_heading: FLETCHER'S FACE
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: I can't lie!
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
speaker_heading: (IMPATIENT)
dialog: Commendable, Mr. Reid, but I'm
dialog: still waiting for the good
dialog: caus e. Now, do you have it or
dialog: . not?
speaker_heading: ' FLETCHER
speaker_heading: (TRUTHFUL)
dialog: Not.
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
dialog: Motion for a continuance
dialog: denied. Is there any chance
dialog: of a settlement in this case?
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: I don't think so, Your Honor.
dialog: Mr. Reid made it abundantly
dialog: clear that the last thing in
dialog: the world he wanted was to --
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
speaker_heading: (DESPERATE)
text: SETTLE! SETTLE! SETTLE!
text: Dana and Mr. Cole look at Fletcher with surprise.
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
dialog: There appears to have been a
dialog: change in strategy. Let's go
dialog: to my chambers and negotiate.
text: He BANGS the gavel.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JUDGE STEVENS'S CHAMBERS - MORNING
text: Dana and an apprehensive Fletcher sit before the judge
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Your Honor, under the terms of
dialog: the prenuptual agreement, if
text: Mrs. Cole commits adultery,
dialog: she is entitled to nothing.
dialog: We have in our possession an
dialog: audiotape made by a licensed
dialog: private investigator of an
dialog: explicit act of sexual
dialog: congress with a man who is not
dialog: her husband.
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
dialog: Sounds pretty damning, Mr.
dialog: Reid.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: It certainly does.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: However, my client has no
dialog: desire to see his ex-wife
dialog: destitute. Against my advice,
dialog: he's willing to offer her a
dialog: cash settlement of.two point
dialog: four million dollars.
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
dialog: Two four seems like a pretty
dialog: fair offer, Mr. Reid.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Fantastically fair.
dialog: Phenominally fair. In fact,
dialog: I'd say beyond fair, bordering
dialog: on stupid.
text: Dana fumes. The judge finds Fletcher's boldness
text: refreshing.
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
dialog: What are you suggesting, Mr.
dialog: Rei d? That Ms. Appleton's
dialog: willingness to proffer such an
dialog: offer betrays a lack of faith
dialog: in her position?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: (utterly sincere)
dialog: No, not at all. She's got my
dialog: client dead to rights. When
dialog: 
dialog: attorneys go to sleep at
text: night, they dream of having a
dialog: case as strong as hers.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Can the sarcasm, Reid. All
dialog: right, I admit it -- I've seen
dialog: you make even the lamest case
dialog: fly. But this time I have
dialog: you. Even Clarence Darrow
dialog: couldn't explain this away.
text: She brandishes the audiotape.
speaker_heading: JUDGE SAMIOAN
dialog: Wel l, Mr. Reid? without a
dialog: dynamite explanation, I'd say
dialog: you're dead in the water.
dialog: How's you client's story?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: The best that money can buy,
dialog: Y o u r Honor. 路
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
dialog: Strong corroborating evidence?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: We have evidence that you are

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: To who?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Max, sometimes grownups...

dialog: Se venty pounds. I thought she
dialog: was gonna give birth to a car.
dialog: But she'd say to me "How do I

speaker_heading: FLETCHER

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: VIRGINIA

dialog: Audrey's patience are growing thin...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Okay, okay... The whole truth
dialog: and nothing but the truth,
dialog: (with difficulty,
speaker_heading: SINCERELY)
dialog: I tried to stop the plane

dialog: You mad at me?
text: Max nods. Fletcher's at a loss for how to begin. Then:
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: You wanted me to stop lying.
dialog: But lying isn't the problem. ..
dialog: Why we lie ~ that's the
dialog: problem. Sometimes we lie to
dialog: make someone else feel better.
dialog: But sometimes we lie because
dialog: the truth gets in our way...
dialog: (touches him)
dialog: But being an adult means you
dialog: sacrifice some things for more
dialog: 
dialog: important things. Much more
dialog: important things. I was so
dialog: stupid, Max.
dialog: (pointing to his
dialog: own head)
dialog: Malfunction in vector one.
dialog: All this time you've been here
dialog: and I could see you anytime I
dialog: felt like it. And I...
dialog: didn't. Please don't go to
dialog: Boston. Max, I love you more
dialog: than anything else in the

dialog: I couldn't say it if it
dialog: weren't true. Not today.
text: A moment as Max studies his father, then:
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (to Audrey)
dialog: He's telling the truth, Mom.
dialog: He's not allowed to lie. I

text: But Fletcher's looking at his watch...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Max. .. it's 9:22.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Max, you made the wish at

text: for the last seven minutes.
text: Max steps away from Fletcher.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: So then, you were...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: No! It wasn't a lie. I just
dialog: wanted to be honest with you
dialog: and tell you -- there was no

dialog: You just have to believe me.
text: Max looks at Audrey, who is letting Max decide for himself

dialog: Mommy... do we have to go to
dialog: Boston?
text: Audrey looks at Jerry, then back at Max.
speaker_heading: AUDR EY
dialog: No. We don't have to.
