dialog: And your dad?
speaker_heading: MAX
speaker_heading: (HESITANT)
dialog: My dad? He's . . . a liar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MS. BERRY
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: A liar? I don't think you

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Well... he wears a suit and

speaker_heading: MS. BERRY
speaker_heading: (RELIEVED)

text: Max shrugs.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM .-- DAY
dialog: 
text: FLETCHER REID, early 30's, stands before the JUDGE. His
text: manner is utterly genuine and convincing.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
text: A dark street. . . a stormy
dialog: night... two desperate men
dialog: struggle... one man is taken
dialog: to the hospital, the other to
dialog: ja il. The prosecutor wants
dialog: you to believe this is an
text: open-and-shut case of a poor
text: man, brutally victimized.
text: He nods at the victim - - a fragile OLD MAN in his 70's.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, for once I agree with
dialog: t he prosecutor. This is an
dialog: open-and shut case -- but the
dialog: true victim is my client.
text: Fletcher's CLIENT is a 250 pound brute in a suit.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Put yourself in his shoes for
text: a moment--walking home from
text: church, alone, in a
dialog: frightening part of the
dialog: suburbs.
text: As he describes his client's movements, Fletcher ACTS THEM
speaker_heading: OUT:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: You're nervous, timid, looking
dialog: over your shoulder -- when
dialog: suddenly, you encounter him--
dialog: (pointing at the
dialog: old man)
text: pouncing from the shadows.
dialog: You quiver in fear. The
text: streetlight flashes on
text: something shiny in his hand--
dialog: a knife?
text: Suddenly Fletcher becomes the attacker, brandishing a
text: weapon. The jurors RECOIL.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: And in that terrifying instant
dialog: you do what any respectable
dialog: citizen would -- you defend
dialog: y ou rse lf. Only after you
text: shatter his arm and collarbone
dialog: do you realize it's all a
dialog: mistake... the man was merely
text: walking away from an ATM
text: machine, the apparent flash of
text: metal caused by his bank card.
text: He reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (CONCERNED)
dialog: As you stand over his
dialog: crumpled, though potentially
dialog: still-dangerous form, your
dialog: he art goes out to him. You
dialog: want to help. First, you
dialog: gather up the many bills he
dialog: dropped, to stop them from
dialog: bl owi ng away. Second, in an
dialog: effort to get the name and
dialog: number of someone to notify,
dialog: you take his wallet. Finally,
dialog: you leap into the man's Lexus
dialog: to head for assistance, when
text: suddenly a police car speeds
dialog: up. You breathe a sigh of
dialog: relief: "Someone to look -after
dialog: the injured man! Oh joy!"
dialog: But do the police applaud your
dialog: initiative? Do they hail your
dialog: heroism? No-- they arrest you
dialog: and throw you in the slammer!
text: He walks along the jury box:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: · And why? Why does the State
dialog: turn its massive power against
dialog: this individual?
dialog: (takes an
speaker_heading: IMPRESSIVE
dialog: moment, then
dialog: answers his own
speaker_heading: QUESTION:)
dialog: Discrimination,
dialog: (to a black
speaker_heading: JUROR)
dialog: But this time it's not based
dialog: on race.
dialog: (to a female
speaker_heading: JUROR)
dialog: Not based on gender.
dialog: (to a man wearing
dialog: a crucifix)
dialog: Not based on religion,
dialog: (to a heavy set
speaker_heading: JUROR)
dialog: No--this time it's
dialog: discrimination based on size!
dialog: . I know what the prosecution
dialog: wants you to think - - i t ' s
dialog: always the big guy's fault.
dialog: Is that what we've come to as
dialog: a society -- persecuting
dialog: people because they're large?
text: Fletcher points accusingly at the opposition.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Shame on you, Mister
dialog: Prosecutor! Shame on you!
dialog: (turning back to
speaker_heading: JURY)
dialog: The state is trying to
dialog: barbeque my client on the spit
dialog: of Justice. Only you can douse
text: the flames. The decision is
dialog: your s. And please...don't let
dialog: your emotions run away with
dialog: y ou . The fact that my client
text: is a family man, raising his
dialog: sons alone after the tragic
dialog: death of their mother, has
dialog: absolutely no bearing on this
dialog: case.
text: In the front row we see two sad-faced YOUNG CHILDREN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Instead, let cold reason be
dialog: your guide as you decide the
dialog: fate of this church-going,

dialog: And you, Mr. Reid?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Well, I'm a little upset about

speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
speaker_heading: (DRYLY)
dialog: Well, you're still young.
dialog: It'll happen more and more.
dialog: In the meantime, what do you
dialog: say we get. down to business?
dialog: First, Mr. Reid, I see that

speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Yes, Your Honor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
dialog: I take it you're seeking to
dialog: substitute in as counsel?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Yes, Your Honor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
dialog: Fine , fine. And for the
dialog: record, the reason is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Mr. Rand had severe ethical
dialog: objections to my client's
dialog: case.
text: Fletcher is incredulous. Somehow his greatest asset in the
text: world, his mouth, has become his worst enemy.
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
dialog: I take it you don't share the
dialog: same ethical objections, Mr.
dialog: Reid?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: I have lower standards, Your
dialog: Honor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
dialog: I see. Well, if Mrs. Cole
dialog: wants the substitution of

speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Your Honor, under the terms of

dialog: she is entitled to nothing.
dialog: We have in our possession an
dialog: audiotape made by a licensed
dialog: private investigator of an
dialog: explicit act of sexual
dialog: congress with a man who is not
dialog: her husband.
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
dialog: Sounds pretty damning, Mr.
dialog: Reid.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: It certainly does.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: However, my client has no
dialog: desire to see his ex-wife
dialog: destitute. Against my advice,
dialog: he's willing to offer her a
dialog: cash settlement of.two point
dialog: four million dollars.
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
dialog: Two four seems like a pretty
dialog: fair offer, Mr. Reid.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Fantastically fair.
dialog: Phenominally fair. In fact,
dialog: I'd say beyond fair, bordering
dialog: on stupid.
text: Dana fumes. The judge finds Fletcher's boldness
text: refreshing.
speaker_heading: JUDGE STEVENS
dialog: What are you suggesting, Mr.
dialog: Rei d? That Ms. Appleton's
dialog: willingness to proffer such an
dialog: offer betrays a lack of faith
dialog: in her position?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: (utterly sincere)
dialog: No, not at all. She's got my
dialog: client dead to rights. When
dialog: 
dialog: attorneys go to sleep at

dialog: case as strong as hers.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Can the sarcasm, Reid. All
dialog: right, I admit it -- I've seen
dialog: you make even the lamest case
dialog: fly. But this time I have
dialog: you. Even Clarence Darrow
dialog: couldn't explain this away.
text: She brandishes the audiotape.
speaker_heading: JUDGE SAMIOAN
dialog: Wel l, Mr. Reid? without a

dialog: To who?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Max, sometimes grownups...

speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: You wanted me to stop lying.
dialog: But lying isn't the problem. ..
dialog: Why we lie ~ that's the
dialog: problem. Sometimes we lie to
dialog: make someone else feel better.
dialog: But sometimes we lie because
dialog: the truth gets in our way...
dialog: (touches him)
dialog: But being an adult means you
dialog: sacrifice some things for more
dialog:

dialog: important things. I was so
dialog: stupid, Max.
dialog: (pointing to his

dialog: Malfunction in vector one.
dialog: All this time you've been here

text: Max steps away from Fletcher.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: So then, you were...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: No! It wasn't a lie. I just
