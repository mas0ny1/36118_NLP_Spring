scene_heading: INT. CALVIN’S BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING.
text: CALVIN (29) wakes, jolted, alone in bed. A porn DVD menu is

text: his sheets away from his body. They are sticky.
scene_heading: EXT. SILVERLAKE STREET. LATER
text: Calvin stands in his sweats at the side of the road. His

text: Calvin's dog SCOTTY, small and sensitive, sniffs around.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Go potty. Go potty. Go potty. Go
dialog: potty. Go potty. Go potty. Scotty. Go
dialog: potty.
text: Scotty squats and pees like a girl dog.
scene_heading: INT. CALVIN’S KITCHEN. LATER.
dialog: This is a nicer house than we would expect a guy this young
dialog: to have. Very little furniture, but everything is expensive.
text: Calvin pours coffee. Toast pops up. Scotty waits for scraps.
dialog: He Loves Me 6/09/11 Draft 2.
scene_heading: INT. CALVIN’S OFFICE. LATER.
text: Calvin places the toast and coffee carefully next to the
text: typewriter on his desk. Everything in the room is white:
text: desk, floor, walls. Scotty tries to come in. Calvin shuts
text: the door.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: No Scotty.
text: Calvin sits. Silence. He positions his hands over the keys.
text: A page sits in the typewriter. Blank. Calvin's face. Also
text: blank. CUT between the page and Calvin. It’s like a

text: The phone rings, loud, jarring. Calvin answers.

speaker_heading: CALVIN

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I don’t know. I don’t know. I get an
dialog: idea, a good idea, like, why don’t I
dialog: write about my dad? And BAM, I start
dialog: thinking that is the stupidest thing
dialog: ever, who wants to read about “He was
dialog: disappointed in me, bla bla bla.” But
text: then I’m sitting there, alone, in front
dialog: of my typewriter all day, and maybe I get
dialog: something to eat, and all I can think
dialog: about is how every second I’m getting
dialog: older and he was right, what am I doing
dialog: with my life? And also. Also I am
text: feeling ambivalent about Scotty.
text: A beat. We hold on Calvin.
speaker_heading: CALVIN (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s true. I’m feeling very ambivalent
dialog: about Scotty. Dogs can be really
text: annoying. He slobbers. He chews things.
text: He pees like a girl, which for some
dialog: reason makes me feel inadequate. But
dialog: then I feel bad, because if I don’t love
dialog: him, who will?
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: Plus he needs to go outside a lot, and it
dialog: breaks up my day. Maybe that’s why I’m
dialog: not writing?
text: We see: DR. ROSENTHAL. Smart, fifties. He looks bemused.
scene_heading: DR. ROSENTHAL
dialog: Do you think that’s why you’re not
dialog: writing?

dialog: friend?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Harry, yesterday.
scene_heading: DR. ROSENTHAL
dialog: Someone other than your brother?
text: Calvin doesn’t answer. Dr. Rosenthal comes over and hands
text: him a plush teddy bear: Bobby. Calvin holds it. Dr.
text: Rosenthal goes back to his seat.
speaker_heading: DR. ROSENTHAL (CONT'D)
dialog: How was your date Tuesday?
text: Calvin plays with Bobby's ears.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I don’t know that I’m really a dating
dialog: kind of person. Just the prospect of
dialog: like...childhood stories, relationship
dialog: histories, “You’re depressed? Oh my god
dialog: I’m depressed”... Besides, if I haven’t
dialog: written that day, that’s all I can think
dialog: about. Have you been giving Bobby to
dialog: your other patients?
scene_heading: DR. ROSENTHAL
dialog: No, Bobby’s just for you.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: ‘Cause he smells weird.
scene_heading: DR. ROSENTHAL

scene_heading: DR. ROSENTHAL
dialog: .-.I want to give you a writing

speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I can’t write.
scene_heading: DR. ROSENTHAL
dialog: Okay. This would just be for me. I'd
dialog: like you to write, just a page, about
text: someone who sees Scotty, all slobbery and
dialog: scared, and likes him anyway. Just the
dialog: way he is. Do you think you could do
