scene_heading: SLOW FADE TO:
text: EXTREME CLOSE-UP of MAXIMILIAN COHEN'S eyes popping open.
scene_heading: INT. MAX'S APARTMENT -CHINATOWN FLAT  NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT
text: Max jolts his head from his desk and tries to orient him-self
text: in the darkness. He has intelligent eyes set in an exhausted,
text: good-looking face.
text: Then he notices the blood dripping from his nose. Max wipes
dialog: it.
text: Max's voiceover begins:
speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.)
dialog: Monday, September first.
text: Six-fifteen.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAWN
text: A pull-string light flips on. Max examines his bloody nose in
dialog: the mirror.
speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.)
text: The alchemist awakes.
dialog: (Imitating)
dialog: "Turn lead into gold, Max,
dialog: lead into gold." Today, I find it.
speaker_heading: TIGHT ON
text: Max's hand as three unmarked, circular pills hit his palm.
text: Then, he slams the pills into the back of his mouth.
text: Max replaces the cap on a plastic bottle of unmarked
text: prescription drugs. He drinks from the sink and splashes a
text: generous amount of water onto his head and face, cleaning his
dialog: nose.
text: He wipes his nose and examines the last remnants of blood on
text: his fingertip. Then, he dips his finger under the tap.
scene_heading: INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - MAIN ROOM - DAY
text: Max's room is constantly dark because the windows are blacked
text: out. He flips on his desk lamp.
text: A tiny ANT crawls across his desk. He looks at it for a moment
text: before getting angry and squashing it.
text: Sitting on the desk are three computer monitors, which Max
text: flips on.
text: Then he pops on more lights and more switches. We pull back
text: revealing that Max's apartment looks more like the inside of a
text: computer than a human's home.
text: The room is knee-high in computer parts of all shapes and
text: sizes. The walls are covered with circuit boards. Cables hang
text: from the ceiling like vines in a Brazilian rain forest. They
text: all seem to be wired together forming a monstrous homemade
dialog: computer.
text: This is EUCLID, Max's creation. The computer is alive with
text: sounds and lights.
text: Max works on Euclid with his solder and drill. He cares for
text: the machine as if it were his dream car
speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.)
dialog: Heat's been getting
dialog: to Euclid. Feel it most in
dialog: the afternoon when I run the
dialog: set. Have to keep the fans on
dialog: all night from now on.
dialog: Otherwise, everything is
text: running topnotch. The stack
dialog: of 286's is now faster than
dialog: Columbia's computer science
dialog: department. I spent a couple
dialog: hundred dollars. Columbia's
dialog: cost? Half a million?
dialog: (Small snicker)
dialog: Ha...
dialog: 
text: Max checks the peephole on His front door. No one is there. He
text: unbolts the five lock and slides into the hall.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENJ HALLWAY - DAY
text: As he secures his apartment, a Young girl named JENNA runs up
text: to him. Her MOM, down the hall, looks apologetic.
text: Jenna's eyes light up and she pulls out her Fisher Price
dialog: calculator.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Max, Max! Can we do one?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: (Over and over again)
dialog: Jenna! Jenna!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Oh, no.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: What's three hundred
dialog: and twenty-two times four
dialog: hundred and ninety-one.
dialog: 
text: Jenna types it into her calculator. Max finishes locking his
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (instantly)
dialog: One hundred fifty-eight thousand,
dialog: a hundred two. Right?
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: (Eyes light up)
dialog: Right.
dialog: 
text: Max heads down the staircase.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Jenna...
dialog: 
text: Jenna screams after him.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Okay, seventy-three
text: divided by twenty-two.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (instantly again)
dialog: Three point three one eight one
dialog: eight one eight...
scene_heading: EXT. CHINATOWN - DAY
text: Max watches people bustle through the busy intersections of
text: Chinatown. The streets are clogged with people.
speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.)
text: Somewhere in there.
dialog: Somewhere. I know it's right
text: in front of me. The pattern.
dialog: They say it's chaos, it can't
dialog: be understood, too much
dialog: complexity.
scene_heading: EXT. ELECTRONIC MEGADUMP - DAY
text: Max scavenges electronic parts as he carefully navigates an
text: endless dump for old and rotting computers.
speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.)
dialog: History it's there.
text: Lurking, shaping.
dialog: structuring, hiding, right
text: beneath the surface.
text: He unscrews a random IBM Board from a keyboard and slides it
text: into his pocket.
scene_heading: EXT PLAYGROUND  DAY
speaker_heading: MOVE IN
text: on Max looking up at something as he reclines on a public
dialog: bench.
speaker_heading: MAX (V.0.)
dialog: The cycling of disease epidemics,
dialog: the wax and wane of Caribou populations
text: in the Arctic, sunspot cycles,
dialog: the rise and fall of the
dialog: Nile and yes! the New York Stock
dialog: Exchange, they are all the
dialog: same.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOVE IN
text: on a tree branch - shaking gently in the wind.
scene_heading: SLOW DISSOLVE TO EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF STOCK TICKER
text: Bright stock quotes drift across the screen.
speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.)
dialog: I'll find this structure,
dialog: this order, this perfection.
scene_heading: INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Max stares intensely at the ticker on the small TV that sits
text: next to his monitors.
speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.)
dialog: Turn lead into gold.
dialog: The first. Right here. Right
dialog: here. With math. The numbers
dialog: of the stock market are my
dialog: lead. When I find the
dialog: pattern, then I will find
dialog: gold.
dialog: 
text: Max watches the right edge of the screen where the numbers
dialog: appear. He wants to see what's before that edge...
text: Max slaps the RETURN button on his computer.
text: The phone starts ringing.
text: Max eyes it suspiciously.
text: Just then, Euclid starts printing results on an old dot-
text: matrix printer.
text: Max suspiciously answers The phone.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Hello?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Maximilian Cohen, please.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Mr. Cohen?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Who's this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Hi. my name is Marcy Dawson.
dialog: I'm a partner with the predictive
dialog: strategy firm Lancet-Percy. Can I
dialog: speak with Mr. Cohen, please?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I told you...
dialog: 
text: The printer finishes printing.
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: Mr. Cohen! How
dialog: are you? It's been a long
dialog: time. Sorry I haven't been in
dialog: touch. But I was hoping you
dialog: would allow me to take you to
dialog: lunch tomorrow, say one
dialog: o'clock?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Sorry, I can't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: We're very anxious to talk
dialog: with you, sir
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I can't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: I'm prepared to
dialog: make you a generous...
text: Max hurries to wrap up the conversation.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I don't take offers for
dialog: my research. You know that.
dialog: Sorry, I Couldn't help you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: Mr. Cohen, give
dialog: me a moment...
text: But before Marcy finishes, Max hangs up. He rips off the
text: printout and heads to the front door.
text: He checks the peephole, His landlady. MRS. OVADIA, is sweeping
text: the hallway stairs humming a turn-of-the century (the last
dialog: one, not this one) tune.
text: Max waits a moment. He tousles his hair. Then he checks again.
text: She's gone. He opens his locks and releases several bolts.
scene_heading: INT.MAX'S BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY
text: Max locks his front door. Meanwhile, his next-door neighbor,
text: DEVI MINSTRY, a sexy young Indian woman, is just getting home.
text: Max looks away and tries to get his door locked.
text: She's weighted down by a bunch of bags filled with food.
speaker_heading: DEVI
dialog: Max, good!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Hi, Devi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEV1
dialog: I grabbed you some
dialog: somosas.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Great.
dialog: 
text: Devi heads over to Max with her bags of food. She looks up at
dialog: Max.
speaker_heading: DEVI
dialog: Your hair.
dialog: 
text: Devi hands the bags to Max. Then she goes to pat down his
text: Hair. Max retreats.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVI
dialog: Your hair, you can't go
dialog: out like that. Don't worry.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It's fine. It's fine.
dialog: 
text: Devi pats down his hair. Max is humiliated.
speaker_heading: DEVI
dialog: You need a mom.
dialog: 
text: Max hands back the bags and heads quickly for the stairs.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I have to go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVI
dialog: Your somosas!
dialog: 
text: An embarrassed Max takes the bag.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
text: At the counter, Max stirs cream into his coffee. Then he takes
text: three pills from the plastic bottle and drops them in his
dialog: coffee.
text: Max flips past a full-page ad in the paper that reads
scene_heading: LANCET-PERCY 86% ACCURACY (ONLY GOD IS PERFECT).
text: Max flips the page before he or we can absorb it. He compares
text: stock quotes in the Wall Street Journal against his printout.
speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.)
text: Sixteen, twenty-seven. Results: Euclid
dialog: shows tomorrow's Dow closing
text: up by four points. Anomalies
dialog: include PRONET at sixty-fire
dialog: and a quarter, a career high.
dialog: Possible explanations, either
dialog: A, an error in the June fifth
dialog: algorithm, or B, Euclid's
dialog: main processor is running a
dialog: recursion...
text: Max marks up the paper with lines and diagrams as he ponders
text: his bits and misses.
text: Then a puff of cigarette smoke drifts by and succeeds in
text: bothering Max. He fans it away when
speaker_heading: VOICE FROM OFFSCREEN
dialog: Oh sorry, am I bothering you?
dialog: 
text: Max shrugs and looks over.
text: The voice belongs to LENNY MEYERa bearded man in his late 20s
text: sucking on a cigarette.
text: On closer inspection, something is off. It seems that Lenny is
text: an Orthodox Jew. His yarmulke sticks out Slightly from his
text: wide-brimmed hat and the fringes from his tsi-tsis hang out
text: from the bottom of his untucked shirt.
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: I'll put it out.
dialog: (Which he does)
dialog: The name's Lenny Meyer
dialog: 
text: Lenny sticks out his hand. Max responds with a small nod.
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: And you are?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Max.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Max?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Max Cohen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Cohen!
dialog: (Judging)
dialog: Jewish?
text: Max shrugs and turns back to his work.
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: It's okay.
dialog: (Joking)
dialog: I'm a Jew, too.
dialog: (Serious)
dialog: Do you practice?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No, I'm not interested
dialog: in religion.
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Have you ever
dialog: heard of Kabbalah?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Jewish mysticism.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'm sorry, I'm very busy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: I understand...it's just that
dialog: it's a very exciting time in
dialog: our history. Right now is a
text: critical moment in time.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (Sarcastic)
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Yes, it's very exciting.
dialog: Have you ever put on Tefillin?
text: Max has no idea what Lenny's talking about. Lenny pulls a
text: leather box with black leather straps from his pocket.
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Tefillin. You know Tefillin.
dialog: I know it looks strange.
dialog: But it's an amazing
dialog: tradition that has a
dialog: tremendous amount of power.
dialog: It's a mitzvah for all
dialog: Jewish men to do. Mitzvahs,
dialog: good deeds, are spiritual
dialog: food for our hearts and our
dialog: heads.
text: And then Max notices that his thumb is twitching He grabs it
text: self-consciously.
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: They purify us and bring us
dialog: closer to God. You want to try it?
text: Just then, Max pays his bill and prepares to leave.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I gotta go...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Are you okay? Max? Max?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'm sorry, bye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Well, maybe some other time.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAX'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Max splashes water on his face.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Please God, Let it be a
dialog: small one.
text: He pulls a metal vaccinating gun out of the medicine cabinet.
text: Then be loads it with a small bottle of medicine. He rolls up
text: his sleeve, dabs alcohol on his arm, and fires the gun into
text: his arm.
speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.)
text: Sixteen thirty-five.
dialog: Second headache in under
dialog: twenty-four hours. They're
dialog: getting more frequent
dialog: now...more painful, too. Drugs
dialog: don't work, just take the
dialog: edge off of it. Just gotta
dialog: wait for the nosebleed.
text: Relief comes from my nose.
dialog: 
text: Next door, he hears Devi and her boyfriend talking.
speaker_heading: FARROUHK (O.S.)
dialog: So I gotta make this drop off
dialog: in Harlem and on the way down
dialog: there's these three kids
dialog: hailing me.
text: Max slaps himself in the face a few times.
speaker_heading: DEVI (O.S.)
dialog: You stopped?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARROUHK (O.S.)
dialog: I was tight, so...
dialog: 
text: Max watches his thumb twitch. And then pain shoots through
text: him. He grabs the right side of his head, massages it, and
text: pushes it in with his fingers.
text: In the mirror, he examines the right side of his scalp. He
dialog: sees nothing
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Ahh...
dialog: 
text: Max walks back into the
speaker_heading: MAIN ROOM
text: and sits down in a chair. The lamp is blinding so he
text: snaps it off. Only the bathroom light lights the room. He
text: takes a few breaths.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Leave me alone.
dialog: 
text: His neighbors conversation begins to build in volume
dialog: and distortion.
speaker_heading: FARROUHK (O.S.)
dialog: So I drop them off in the
text: Village and they dart.
speaker_heading: DEVI (O.S.)
dialog: Oh God...
dialog: 
text: Max gags and rubs his head.
speaker_heading: FARROUHK (O.S.)
text: I get out, grab my bat and
text: start running. One of the kids,
dialog: maybe sixteen, I catch a block
text: later he's cursing at me, calling
dialog: me a Paki bastard. So I whacked him,
text: right in the head.
speaker_heading: DEVI (O.S.)
dialog: Farrouhk!
dialog: 
text: The pain seems to disappear. Max looks at his hand that was
text: rubbing his bead.
text: Then he looks at the front door. The doorknob seems to
dialog: move.
text: Something begins knocking on Max's door. The knocking gets
text: louder and louder then the locks begin to unlock.
text: FARROUHK's words begin to overpower Max.
speaker_heading: FARROUHK (O.S.)
dialog: I'm kicking the bastard in the
text: ribs banging his ass, knocking his
text: head against the curb, harder
dialog: and harder, I fucking lost
text: it. A hot dog guy starts
dialog: screaming "You're cracking his
dialog: skull, you're cracking his
dialog: skull." So they pulled me off
dialog: of him and calmed me down.
dialog: Cops said he had it coming to
dialog: him.
dialog: 
text: Then something starts pounding the door. The doorknob quivers,
text: the locks unbolt. The chains are the only thing keeping out
text: the intruder. The door shakes and the chains are strained.
text: MAX is paralyzed with terror.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No! No!
dialog: 
text: And then the door smashes open. Blinding light fills the room
dialog: and we crash into the
scene_heading: BLINDING WHITE VOID
dialog: A moment of silence, then we
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAWN
text: A phone rings incessantly. Max's eyes pop open. He's scrunched
text: up in a corner of the room, squashed beneath the sink.
text: His nose is bleeding.
text: Max, crawls into the
speaker_heading: MAIN ROOM
text: and picks up the phone. He pinches his nose and tilts his head
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: Mr. Cohen. Marcy
dialog: Dawson here again I was just
dialog: looking over my schedule and
dialog: I realized I'll be in your
dialog: neighborhood tomorrow around
dialog: three.
text: Max heads to the
speaker_heading: FRONT DOOR
text: and checks the locks. He is barely listening to Marcy
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (Groggy)
dialog: Who is...
dialog: 
text: The locks seem secure.
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: Marcy Dawson from
dialog: Lancet-Percy I'm so anxious
dialog: to meet you. It will be worth
dialog: itfor both of us I promise.
dialog: See you at your house at
dialog: three, okay?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: My house...how do...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: Oh, don't worry,
dialog: I got your address from
dialog: Columbia. So three it is.
dialog: Looking forward to it.
text: Max tries to stop her but, before he can Marcy hangs up.
text: A bewildered Max slowly hangs up.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Damn.
dialog: 
text: Max checks the peephole - all clear.
text: Then, he opens his -
speaker_heading: CLOSET
text: which is filled with random computer parts and boxes.
text: He pulls a thick neuroscience book from a shelf in the back of
text: the closet. He almost knocks over an old dusty brass
text: microscope on the shelf.
text: Max flips through the book. It contains old plates
text: illustrating the brain. Max examines some of the diagrams.
text: EXT. S0L'S HALLWAY - DAY Max rings the bell on an apartment
dialog: door.
text: A few moments pass, and then SOL ROBESON opens the door.
text: Sol is a wise-looking man in his early 70's. He walks with
text: difficulty, leaning out of breath on a wooden cane.
text: His arms are covered with faded Russian prison tattoos and he
text: speaks with a thick Eastern European accent, He's happy to see
dialog: Max.
speaker_heading: S0L
dialog: Max! How are you7
dialog: 
text: Max is happy to see Sol, but he's a bit bashful and
text: intimidated.
dialog: MAX Okay.
scene_heading: EXT. SOL'S STUDY - MOMENTS LATER
text: TIGHT ON the Japanese game of Go being played. Sol is white
text: and Max is black. Sol's moves are secure and controlled while
text: Max is hesitant.
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: Stop thinking, Max, just
dialog: feel. Use your intuition.
dialog: It's the only way to get into
dialog: the flow.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: What did you think of Hamlet?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I didn't get to it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: It's been a month.
dialog: (Knowingly)
dialog: You haven't taken
text: a single break.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'm so close, Sol. I'm
dialog: so close but I just can't
dialog: grab it.
dialog: 
text: Sol changes the subject. He feeds his goldfish and points to
text: one of them.
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: Have you met the new
dialog: fish my niece bought me? I
dialog: named her Icarus. After you.
dialog: My renegade pupil. You fly
dialog: too high, you'll get burned.
dialog: 
text: Max looks up at Sol.
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: The more I see you, the
dialog: more I see myself thirty
dialog: years ago. My greatest pupil.
dialog: Published at 16, Ph.D. at 20.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: We'll see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: But life isn't just
dialog: mathematics. I spent forty
dialog: years looking for patterns in
dialog: Pi, I found nothing.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You found things...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: I found things, but not a
dialog: pattern.
scene_heading: INT. MOVING TRAIL - DAY
text: Max sits in the corner of a rickety New York City subway car.
text: The train is almost completely deserted.
text: Max looks down at his hand. He opens his palm and reveals a
dialog: black Go chip.
speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.)
dialog: Tuesday, September
dialog: second, eighteen twelve. If
dialog: Sol hadn't gotten sick who
dialog: knows where math would be. He
dialog: spent years in the numbers of
dialog: Pi. Searching for meaning, for
dialog: order.
dialog: 
text: Max notices a SKINNY MAN in a business suit staring at him.
text: The man catches Max's eye and looks away, but then he quickly
text: looks back, making Max turn away.
text: He looks down at his Wall Street journal and draws a circle
text: with its diameter then he writes "A=pir2" and "C=2pir." Next
dialog: he writes "pi=3.14159..."
speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.)
dialog: Three point one
dialog: four...off into infinity
dialog: and maybe insanity. Somewhere
dialog: in there he wanted sanity.
dialog: Sanity like he found in the
dialog: circles Pi represented.
dialog: Simple, sane circles. If only
dialog: the stock market had circles.
dialog: Some type of sanity. Some
dialog: type of form, of shape.
text: Suddenly, Max hears someone singing. Max looks up. It is the
text: Skinny Man and he's singing with passion. It's all very
text: strange to Max, who nervously looks away.
text: And then the singing stops
text: mid-verse Max looks up and the man is gone. Vanished. Max
text: looks aroundno one in Sight.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - DAY
text: Max heads up the stairs to his apartment. Just then, a toy
text: SLINKY appears from nowhere marching down the stairs.
text: Max stops and waits until the Slinky hits his foot. He picks
text: it up and looks at it.
text: He looks around wondering what's going on. Then Jenna leans
text: out over a railing and starts laughing at Max.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP-DAY
text: Max sits at the counter frantically looking at the Wall Street
text: Journal. He plops three pills into his coffee.
text: He draws circles and other shapes across the page.
text: Max is interrupted by a puff of smoke. At the same time,
text: someone touches his shoulder and says:
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Hey, Max, how you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Oh, okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Lenny Meyer.
dialog: (Motioning to the cigarette)
dialog: I'll put it out.
dialog: (Which be does)
dialog: So, what do you do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Um, I work with computers
dialog: ...math.
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Really? What type of math?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Number theory. Mostly
dialog: research.
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Number theory? No
dialog: way, I work in theory, too.
dialog: Not traditional, though...
dialog: (Points to his yarmulke)
dialog: I work with the Torah.
dialog: (Awed by the coincidence)
dialog: Amazing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (Passing it of as a coincidence)
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Yeah. You know Hebrew is
dialog: all numbers. It's all math.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Hm.
dialog: 
text: Lenny pulls out a worn' dog-eared Bible from his pocket. There
text: are paper slips marking what seems like every other page. When
text: he opens it up,
text: Max sees that the pages are marked up by highlighter pens,
text: notes and diagrams.
text: Lenny points to the text. EXTREME CLOSE-UP of Hebrew letters.
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Here, look...the ancient
dialog: Jews used Hebrew as their
dialog: numerical system. Each
dialog: letter is a number.
text: Lenny pulls out a pen and grabs Max's Journal. He writes on it
text: as he talks.
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: You see...The Hebrew "A," the
dialog: number 1. The Hebrew "B,"
dialog: Bet, is two. You can take any
dialog: Hebrew text and turn them into
text: a long string of numbers.
dialog: 
text: The waitress refills Max's coffee.
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: The Torah is just
text: a long string of numbers.
dialog: Some say that it's a long
dialog: code sent to us from God.
text: Satisfied, Lenny lights up a cigarette and takes a drag.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (Mildly impressed)
dialog: Kind of interesting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: (Proud of himself)
dialog: Yeah, like take the
dialog: Hebrew word for, say, the
dialog: Garden of Eden, Kadem. Kuf,
dialog: Dalei Mem...Kuf is a
dialog: hundred. Daled, four Mem,
dialog: forty. They equal one hundred
dialog: and forty-four. Then take the
dialog: tree of knowledge...in
dialog: the garden, Aat Ha Haim, it
dialog: equals two hundred and
dialog: thirty-three. Now you can take
dialog: that number and...
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: They're Fibonacci numbers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: The Fibonacci sequence.
dialog: Italian mathematician, thirteenth
dialog: century. If you divide
dialog: a hundred and forty-four into
dialog: two hundred and thirty-three,
text: it approaches theta.
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Theta?
dialog:

dialog: 
text: SLOW MOTION: Max looks down at his coffee cup. He pours cream

scene_heading: INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Max draws spirals all over his Wall Street Journal. Then he
text: takes a thick black marker and draws a giant spiral across the
dialog: entire page.
text: Max is ecstatic as he pounds code into the computer takes
text: moments to wake up, drops pills, and drinks a Ginseng soda.
speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.)
dialog: Simple shapes!
dialog: Tuesday, September second.
dialog: Twenty-twenty-two. Sol! Sol!
text: Sol! Shapes in the market.
dialog: Why not? And they're spirals!
dialog: Spirals!
text: Max traces a big circle on the journal. Then, he cuts it out
text: with an X-acto blade. He cuts out the middle of the circle so
text: that be has a thin loop like one of those futuristic frisbees.
text: He tears part of the loop and stretches the circle out in
text: front of him into a spiral.
speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.)
text: A circle spread out overtime.
text: It's open-ended. It has a
dialog: beginning and it grows and
dialog: changes through time. If I
dialog: can find where it fits, if I
dialog: can spin it and lock it into
dialog: a group of numbers, then I
dialog: can calculate the future.
dialog: Lead into gold. Chaos into

text: into bliss. Perfection.
dialog: 
text: Max is about to slap RETURN but he stops himselfhe's nervous.
text: Next door, Devi and her boyfriend are making love. He looks at
text: the wall with disdain. Then he looks back at the screen,
text: shrugs and confidently slaps RETURN on his keyboard.
text: Stock prices float across the screen. Max can't believe his
dialog: eyesthe quotes are absurd.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What the...
dialog: 
text: And then, Euclid crashes. The electricity in Max's room flips

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Shit!
dialog: 
text: TIGHT ON A FUSE BOX
text: Max removes a fuse. He replaces it with a penny.
speaker_heading: MAX'S ROOM
text: Max tries to reboot Euclid, but nothing happens. He tries a
text: second time, but nothing happens.
text: Devi and Farrouhk are still at it.
text: Max puts on a pair of latex gloves. He dons a surgical mask.
text: He climbs up to a loft above his monitors. A glass case, fed
text: cool air by a vent tube, encases some computer parts. He
text: carefully removes the front glass cover.
text: Then he gets it off he's stunned. Not only have the chips
text: melted down, but a strange flaky substance covers the board.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What the...
dialog: 
text: Max grabs his face, frustrated.
text: Deri and Farroakk are giggling, having a great time. Max
text: stares at the wall.
text: Then he angrily throws Euclid's mainframe onto the ground It
dialog: lands with a SMASH!
text: Under the mainframe is a small city of ANTS. They scramble for

speaker_heading: SOL

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Burnt...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: What happened?

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I don't know, first I got

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: SOL

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: MAX

text: The one with the black spot.
dialog: You see?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: Remember Archimedes of
dialog: Syracuse? The King asks
dialog: Archimedes to determine if a
dialog: present he's received was
text: actually solid gold. Unsolved
dialog: problem at the time. It
dialog: tortures the great Greek
dialog: mathematician for weeks.
text: Insomnia haunts him and he
text: twists and turns on his bed
text: for nights on end. Finally,
dialog: his equally exhausted wife,
text: she's forced to share a bed
dialog: with this genius, convinces
dialog: him to take a bath, to relax.
text: While stepping into the tub
text: he observes the bathwater
text: rise as he enters. Displacement.
dialog: A way to determine volume.
dialog: And thus, a way to
dialog: determine density, weight
dialog: over volume. And thus,
dialog: Archimedes solves the
dialog: problem. He screams
dialog: "Eureka!"Greek for "I found
dialog: it!"and is so overwhelmed he
text: runs dripping naked through
dialog: the streets to the King's
dialog: castle to report his
dialog: discovery. Now, what's the
dialog: moral of the story.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That a breakthrough will
dialog: come...
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: Wrong. The point of the
dialog: story is the wife. Listen to
dialog: your wife, she will give you
dialog: perspective. Meaning, you
dialog: need a break, Max, you have
dialog: to take a bath, otherwise
dialog: you'll get nowhere. There will
dialog: be no order, only chaos.

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Hey, excuse me, can I see
dialog: that?
text: The man hands Max the paper. Max scans the article. Then He

dialog: Six and a half.
dialog: 
text: Max looks up the column for AAR.
speaker_heading: MAX

text: Max gets suspicious and moves into the next car.
scene_heading: AT GRAND STREET
text: Max exits. He notices that the Skinny Man gets off - one car
dialog: down - as well.
text: He hustles toward the exit. As he's about to turn a corner he

text: He dodges around a corner and heads up a staircase.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY
text: He seems to have lost him, when he notices a business-woman

speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: Mr. Cohen! Perfect timing.
dialog:

speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: I was just waiting for you.

speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: I can't tell you what a

dialog: meet you. I've studied
dialog: your papers for years.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: I have something

speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: We're excited by your work.
dialog: We can't wait to discuss...
text: Max attempts to pull away but Marcy is firm on leading him to

text: The CHAUFFEUR reaches out to him. Max yanks his arm free and
text: runs away. He whips around a corner.
scene_heading: INT. BODEGA - DAY
text: Max barrels into the grocery store and buys a Journal. He

speaker_heading: MAX

scene_heading: EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Max scouts his front door. The coast is clear.
scene_heading: INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Max examines the smashed Euclid mainframe. He uncovers some of
text: the strange filo-like substance. He carefully touches it. Then
text: he grabs a small pinch of it.
text: He examines it near a light bulb. He can't guess what it is.
text: He sniffs it. He carefully tastes it with the very tip of his
text: tongue. He still doesn't have a clue.
text: Max opens his closet. He pulls out his dusty brass microscope.
text: He dusts it off. Next, he pulls out a slide Kit.
text: Max places the instrument on the windowsill. He grabs an old
text: glass slide and puts some of the flaky stuff on it. He slides
text: it under the microscope. He looks into the lens, but doesn't
dialog: see anything.
text: He gets up quickly and heads for the
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
text: where he looks at Devi's door, nervously. He gathers his

speaker_heading: DEVI (O.S.)
dialog: Farrouhk?

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Do you have any iodine?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVI
text: (concerned, she reaches for Max's hands)
dialog: Iodine...did you cut
dialog: yourself?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (Pulling his hands away)
dialog: No. I just need it to stain a
dialog: slide.
speaker_heading: DEVI
dialog: Ah, science, the pursuit
text: of knowledge. One second.
text: She heads to her bathroom. Max waits impatiently.
speaker_heading: DEVI (O.S.)
dialog: Here we are. What are you
dialog: examining
dialog: (At the door)
dialog: a potato!?
text: She hands Max a bottle of iodine.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Just something with my

scene_heading: MAX'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Max uses his pinky to drip a drop of iodine on the slide.
text: Through the wall he hears Farrouhk arriving home.
speaker_heading: DEVI (0.S.)
dialog: The neighbor's up
dialog: to his old science...
speaker_heading: FARROUHK (O.S.)
dialog: What neighbor?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVI (O.S.)
text: Next door.
dialog: 
text: Max listens to the conversation for a few moments.
speaker_heading: FARROUHK (O.S.)
dialog: Why are you talking to that dork!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVI (O.S.)
dialog: Shh! I just helped ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARROUHK (O.S.)
dialog: Pounds on wall. Hey, dork, leave
dialog: my girlfriend alone!
speaker_heading: DEVI (0.S.)
dialog: Farrouhk!
dialog: 
text: Max shakes his bead. Then he finishes preparing the slide and
text: slips the glass under the turret.
text: Max catches the low-hanging sun in the microscope's mirror and
text: reflects it through the sample and up the turret
text: into his eye.
text: MAX'S POV DOWN THE TURRET of some strange
dialog: Substance.
text: Max pulls out the slide and looks at it.
speaker_heading: FARROUHK (0.S.)
dialog: I don't give a shit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVI (0.S.)
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: Shh! C'mon, Farrouhk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARROUHK (0.S.)
dialog: I'll kill the dork.
dialog: (Exploding again)
dialog: You hear me! I'll kill you.
dialog: I'll fucking kill you!
text: Then an idea comes to him. He takes out his brain book. He
text: looks through it until he finds a picture of neurons. He
text: compares the image to the view through the turret. They look
dialog: different but there are similarities.
speaker_heading: DEVI (O.S)
dialog: Shh! Baby! Come here, baby!
dialog: 
text: Max rushes out.
scene_heading: EXT. PLAYGROUND - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Max sifts through the trash can where he threw his picks from

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I just threw out something.
dialog: I didn't realize I needed it.
scene_heading: MRS. OVADIA
dialog: Humph.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Just a printout. I, uh,

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER

speaker_heading: MAX

scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT SHUL - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Lenny, I don't really

speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Do it for me? It

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You know me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: 0f course, I've

dialog: the work we do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I have?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Yes, very much
dialog: so. The only difference is,
dialog: we're not looking at stocks.
dialog: We're searching for a pattern
dialog: in Torah.
dialog: 
text: Lenny finishes wrapping Max's arm. He reaches for another box
dialog: and strap.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What kind of pattern?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: We're not really
dialog: sure. Our calculations have
dialog: shown us that there is a
text: number encoded in the text.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What sort of number?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: We don't know.
dialog: All we know is that it's two
text: hundred and sixteen digits long.
dialog: 
text: Max, stunned looks at Lenny.
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Don't worry. This one just
dialog: goes over your head.
dialog:

dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (Coolly)
dialog: Two sixteen?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Yes. Now we have to say a
dialog: small prayer, repeat
dialog: after me.
dialog: 
text: Bewildered, Max does. After the prayer...
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: That's it. Wasn't
dialog: so bad, was it? You feel
dialog: anything?
dialog: 
text: Lenny starts removing the Teffillin from Max.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: It's a prayer about our
dialog: dedication to our one and
dialog: only God.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (Attempting calmness)
dialog: No, I mean the number, the
dialog: two sixteen number? What is
dialog: it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Oh. We don't know. We just
dialog: know that it's the most
dialog: common number encoded in
dialog: the text. It might be some
dialog: type of linguistic pattern.
dialog: If we could figure out what
dialog: the number is we could maybe
dialog: answer that.

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: SOL

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Well, there's these
dialog: religious Jews who have...
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: Religious Jews?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Well, you know,
dialog: Hassidim. I met one in the
dialog: coffee shop. The guy's a
dialog: number theorist. The Torah is
dialog: their data set. The thing is,
dialog: they're searching for a two
dialog: hundred and sixteen digit
dialog: number in the Torah.
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: Really? What's it mean to
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: They say they don't
dialog: know, but that's crazy. I
dialog: mean what are the odds...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: It's just a coincidence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: But hold on, there's
dialog: something else. You remember
dialog: those strange picks I got.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: Yesterday's stock picks?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Right. Well, it turns out
dialog: that they were correct. I hit

text: on the nose.
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: (Surprised)
dialog: Hmmm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Something's going on, and
dialog: it has to do with that
text: number. The answer is there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: Max, it's a bug.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No. it's a pattern. A
dialog: pattern is in that number
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: Come with me.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SOL'S STUDY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Sol and Max sit on either side of a half-played Go board.
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: Listen to me. The Ancient
dialog: Japanese considered the Go
dialog: board to be a microcosm of
dialog: the universe. Although when
text: it is empty it appears to be
dialog: simple and ordered, in fact,
dialog: the possibilities of game play
dialog: are endless. They say that no
dialog: two Go games have ever been
text: alike. Just like snowflakes.
dialog: So, the Go board actually
dialog: represents an extremely complex
dialog: and chaotic universe. That is
dialog: the truth of our world, Max.
dialog: It can't be easily summed up
dialog: with math. There is no simple
dialog: pattern.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: But as a Go game
dialog: progresses, the possibilities
text: become smaller and smaller.
text: The board does take on order.
text: Soon, all moves are
dialog: predictable.
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: So?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: So, maybe, even though we're not
dialog: sophisticated enough to be aware
dialog: of it, there is an underlying
dialog: order...a pattern, beneath every
dialog: Go game. Maybe that pattern is
dialog: like the pattern in the market,
text: in the Torah. The two sixteen
dialog: number.
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: That is insanity, Max.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Or maybe it's genius. I
dialog: have to get that number.
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: Hold on, you have to slow
dialog: down. You're losing it, you
dialog: have to take a breath. Listen
dialog: to yourself. You're connecting
dialog: a computer bug I had, a
dialog: computer bug you might have
dialog: had, and some religious
dialog: hogwash. If you want to find
dialog: the number two sixteen in the
dialog: world, you'll be able to pull
dialog: it out of anywhere. Two
dialog: hundred and sixteen steps
dialog: from your street comer to
dialog: your front door. Two hundred
dialog: and sixteen seconds you spend
text: riding on the elevator. When
dialog: your mind becomes obsessed
dialog: with anything, it will filter
dialog: everything else out and find
dialog: examples of that thing
text: everywhere. Three hundred and
dialog: twenty, four hundred and
dialog: fifty, twenty-three.
dialog: Whatever! You've chosen two
dialog: sixteen and you'll find it
dialog: everywhere in nature. But
dialog: Max, as soon as you discard
dialog: scientific rigor, you are no
dialog: longer a mathematician. You
dialog: become a numerologist. What
dialog: you need to do is take a
dialog: break from your research. You
dialog: need it. You deserve it

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Damn it already! Stop
dialog: following me. I'm not
dialog: interested in your money. I'm
dialog: searching for a way to

dialog: searching for perfection. I
dialog: don't deal with mediocre

dialog: you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
dialog: I admit I've been a bit too

dialog: for five minutes of your time.
dialog: Here...
dialog: 
text: Marcy hands Max a metal stopwatch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
text: ...a stopwatch.
dialog: Already ticking. Allow me the
text: four and a half minutes left
dialog: Let me tell you what I want.
dialog: Let me tell you what I can
dialog: offer you. Afterwards, if you
dialog: don't want to talk to me, then
dialog: fine, we part as friends and
dialog: I promise that you will never
dialog: see me again. That's fair,
dialog: isn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
text: (After a moment, he looks at the stopwatch)
dialog: Go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: Good. It's funny,
dialog: even though we have different
dialog: aims and different goals
dialog: we're actually incredibly
dialog: alike. We both seek the same
dialog: thingperfection. I know...
dialog: clearly we're seeking
dialog: different types of
dialog: perfection, but that is what
dialog: makes us perfect candidates
dialog: for a fruitful partnership.
dialog: If you let me, I can be your
dialog: greatest ally. Take the
dialog: acacia tree...in East
dialog: Africa. It is the most
dialog: prevalent plant in all of
dialog: Kenya because it has managed
dialog: to secure its niche by
dialog: defeating its major predator,
dialog: the giraffe. To accomplish
dialog: this, the tree has made a contract
text: with a highly specialized red ant.
text: The tree has evolved giant spores which
dialog: act as housing for the ants
dialog: In return for shelter, the
dialog: ants supply defense. When a
text: giraffe starts to eat the
text: tree's leaves, the shaking
text: branch acts like an alarm. The
text: ants charge out and secrete an
text: acid onto the giraffe's
text: tongue. The giraffe learns its
dialog: lesson and never returns.
dialog: Without each other, the tree
dialog: would be picked dry and the
dialog: ants would have no shade from
dialog: the brutal African sun Both
dialog: would die. But with each
dialog: other, they succeed, they survive,
dialog: they surpass. They have
dialog: different aims, different
dialog: goals but they work together.
dialog: Max, we would like to establish
dialog: a mutually benefiting alliance
dialog: with you.

text: The tracks are rusted and fucked up. All we hear is the sound
text: of DRIPPING WATER. The sound is warped and grows and morphs
dialog: until it's downright scary.
text: Max sits on a bench sucking down pills. His head begins to
text: hurt. He touches the right side of his scalp and nubs it.
text: As the blood surges through his head it brings him waves of
text: pain. He gags several times. Then the pain lets loose and all
text: Max wants to do is die. He smashes the side of his head with
text: his fist.
text: Across the tracks on the far platform he sees someone.
text: For a moment Max's pain dissipates. His view is obscured by
text: the columns. Max gets up and sees the Young Hasidic Man - from
text: earlier - staring at him.
text: The Man stares at Max without any emotion. Max notices blood
text: dropping from the Man's right hand.
text: Max looks at the Man's face and sees for a split second his

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Hey!
dialog: 
text: Max charges up a flight of stairs. He crosses a passage over
text: the tracks and flies down the stairs to the other side of the
dialog: platform.
text: The Man is gone. A pool of blood sits where the Man was. Max
text: touches it with his toe. It's sticky. He notices a trail of
text: blood leading off from the pool.
text: He follows it around a corner where it leads into a corner.
text: He notices something strange in the shadows. He carefully
text: advances on it. Hiding in the shadows is what looks like a
text: small piece of brain. It seems to be moving slightly.
text: Max uses a pen in his jacket to carefully touch it.
text: Suddenly, Max hears a train's HONK HONK behind him. Max spins
text: around. Nothing is there but silence.
text: He turns back to the gray matter. He touches it again. Once
text: again, he hears the deafening HONK HONK. Max spins around, but
dialog: nothing is there.

dialog: The most I can

dialog: Schneider's fascination with

dialog: bit of a quack...but...then again,
dialog: look at Kepler. He was really into
text: Pythagoras. The leader of an
dialog: ancient sect which believed
dialog: the entire universe could be

text: TIGHT ON MAX carefully measuring out a golden rectangle.
text: The rectangle fits perfectly over Leonardo Da Vinci's Man.
speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.)
dialog: If you take the

text: over is a rectangle that has
dialog: the same ratio as the
dialog: original rectangle. au can
dialog: continue squaring the

dialog: to infinity.
text: TIGHT ON MAX squaring rectangle after rectangle. Then he draws
text: the golden spiral through the rectangles.
speaker_heading: MAX (V.0.)
dialog: Then, if you

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Too much...too soon.

dialog: Ohh...
dialog: 
text: He grabs a bottle of medicine but knocks them an into the

text: Frustrated he collapses into the mirror.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Stop, please, stop.
dialog: 
text: Slightly sobbing he examines his scalp pulling his hair apart.
text: He sees something.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What the?
dialog: 
text: So he takes out a scissors and starts removing some hair.
text: Meanwhile his neighbors' lovemaking gets more intense. Their
text: screams carry into Max's head.
text: Max finishes removing a patch of hair from the right side
text: of his head. He has uncovered a light scar on his head. He
text: examines it in the mirror.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What is it!? What is it!?
dialog: 
text: Then his neighbors' lovemaking turns outright evil. It
text: sounds like Sodom and Gomorrah next door and Max
dialog: can barely stand it.
text: A jolt of pain surges into his head. He grabs his scar as he
text: vomits blood into the sink.
text: He starts banging his head against the mirror. He bangs
text: his head again and again until the mirror CRACKS!
text: His neighbors are cumming and their cries of joy are twisted
text: and agonizing.
text: The mathematician looks at himself and begins to sob. He
text: reloads the gun and fires it right into the scar on his head,
text: where the pain is coming from.
text: Max collapses to the ground in complete agony until the bare
text: bulb in the bathroom starts blinking on and off.
text: Suddenly the pain is gone.
text: Then he hears something. It's Euclid, buzzing with life. He
text: gets to his feet and head's into Euclid.
text: The main monitor is screaming with numbers. The lights in the
text: room flicker on and off like on a disco dance floor. A
text: filo substance billows out of Euclid.
text: And then a number pops onto the screen. Max estimates how many
text: digits are on the screen.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Two...two hundred. That's it! That's it!
dialog: 
text: Max grabs a piece of paper and a pencil. He starts writing
text: down the number. He mumbles each digit as he sees it.

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Oh...

dialog: The number, the number.
dialog: 
text: Max looks at Euclid. The screen is blank. He looks at the

scene_heading: MRS. OVADIA
dialog: You're out, you hear me, you're out.

dialog: 
text: He points to his head.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: But what is it?
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Ovadia starts looking at all the junk in the room.
speaker_heading: DEVI
dialog: Are you okay?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. OVADIA
dialog: What is this stuff? What does it do?
dialog: 
text: Max finally realizes that all these strangers are in his womb.
text: He flips.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: 0ut, out, you have to get
dialog: out. Get out, get out it's my
dialog: room!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARROUHK
dialog: (To Devi)
dialog: Let's go.
dialog: 
text: The phone starts ringing again.
scene_heading: MRS. OVADIA
dialog: That's it, no way. You're
dialog: the one out of here, mister.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Out! 0utt
dialog: 
text: The three neighbors retreat to the front door.
speaker_heading: DEVI
dialog: Are you okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Out! Get out!
dialog: 
text: Max slams the door in their faces.
text: Max rubs his chin and looks around the room. He starts
dialog: saying the number to himself He gets more and more
text: excited as he reads each digit.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT
text: Max stirs cream into his coffee. Then he pulls out the
dialog: Journal.
text: A phone continues to RING.
text: In the clouds of the Lancet-Percy ad - in The Journal Max
text: writes down the two hundred and sixteen digit number. He
text: studies it, examines it, draws on it, tries to figure out what
dialog: it is.
speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.)
text: Saturday? Dark outside. There
dialog: was a moment there...when, I don't
dialog: know...when I didn't exist. What? What?
text: We hear a phone being picked up. The ringing stops. Silence,
dialog: then:
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON (O.S.)
dialog: Max, is that you? Max?
dialog: (Pleading)
dialog: Max, just talk to me. Things
dialog: are a bit out of hand down
dialog: here. People are getting
dialog: desperate.
dialog: (Suddenly firm)
dialog: We had a deal, Max. A deal.
dialog: Talk to us, Max.
text: We hear the sound of a phone hanging up.
text: At the coffee counter, Max pops a handful of pills and
text: crumples the paper.
scene_heading: INT. MAX'S BATHROOM - LATER
text: Max stares at his BALD head in the mirror. All of his hair has
text: been removed. A fleshy scar sits on his scalp above his right
dialog: ear.
text: Max ignores the incessantly RINGING phone.
text: Max flips through an old neuroscience book. He examines a few
text: illustrations and finds the part of his brain that's killing
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MAX (V.0.)
dialog: Must be an explanation, must be a
dialog: reason. Must.
text: With a thick black marker, he carefully outlines the part of
text: his head that is causing the pain.
scene_heading: INT. MAX'S APARTMENT-LATER
text: Max sits in his chair staring at the stock market monitor. The
text: phone continues to RING.
text: Numbers drift by.
text: A single beam of sunlight leaks through the window and shines
text: on the edge of the screen. Walking along the edge in the
text: sunlight is a tiny ant.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Bastard.
text: Max gets up to squash it. But as he gets closer he suddenly
text: feels mercy. He looks at the ant in awe.
text: And then, his attention switches to the ticker.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Two and a quarter, twelve
dialog: and an eighth, six and two
dialog: eighths.
dialog: 
text: Max states the numbers right before they enter onto the
dialog: screen.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I know these...Seven
dialog: and a quarter. Two and a half
dialog: ...oh...oh...
dialog: 
text: Max strains to figure out what is going an. Suddenly, he's
text: overwhelmed with fear.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: My God. It's gonna
dialog: crash, it's gonna fucking
dialog: crash.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SOL'S APARTMENT - DUSK
text: Max charges into the room. Sot is looking at his Go board. Sol
text: looks up when Max comes in.
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: You're early. I was just
dialog: studying our...
dialog: (Noticing ,Max's head)
dialog: What did you do to yourself?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You lied to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOL

dialog: to take a break.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You found the two sixteen

dialog: saw it.
dialog: 
text: Sol doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I saw it, Sol. I don't
dialog: know what happened, but I
dialog: know things. The market is
dialog: going to crash. It's going to
dialog: crash. It hasn't yet, but I
dialog: know it will. I saw it, Sol.
dialog: What is it, Sol? What's the
dialog: number?
text: Sol sighs. He looks down at the board and collects himself.
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: You have it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It's in my head!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: (Leveling with Max)
dialog: Okay, sit down.
dialog: Max does.
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: I gave up before I
dialog: pinpointed it. But my guess
dialog: is that certain problems
dialog: cause computers to get stuck
dialog: in a particular loop. The loop
dialog: leads to meltdown, but
dialog: right before they crash they...
dialog: they become "aware" of
dialog: their own structure. The
dialog: computer has a sense of its
dialog: own silicon nature and it
text: prints out its ingredients.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: The computer becomes conscious?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: In some ways...I guess...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (To himself)
dialog: Studying the pattern made Euclid
text: conscious of itself. Before it died it
dialog: spit out the number That consciousness
dialog: is the number.
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: No, Max, it's only a
dialog: nasty bug.
speaker_heading: SOL
text: A door in front of a cliff.
dialog: You're driving yourself over
dialog: the edge. You need to stop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Stop? How can I stop? I'm
dialog: this close.
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: The bug doesn't only
dialog: destroy computers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What are you saying?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: Look what it did to your
dialog: computer. Look what it's doing
dialog: to you.
dialog: 
text: Max doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: It's killing you. Leave it
dialog: unknown.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (Clarity)
dialog: You were afraid of

speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: Max, I got burnt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: C'mon, Sol.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: It caused my stroke.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That's bullshit. It's
dialog: math, numbers, ideas.
dialog: Mathematicians are suppose to
dialog: be out on the edge. You
dialog: taught me that!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: Max, there's more than
dialog: math! There's a whole world...
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That's where discoveries
dialog: happen. We have to go out
dialog: there alone, all alone, no
dialog: one can accompany us. We have
dialog: to search the edge. We have
dialog: to risk it all. But you ran
dialog: from it. You're a coward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: Max, it's death!
dialog: 
text: Max stands up and screams down at Sol.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You can't tell me what it
dialog: is. You don't know You've

speaker_heading: SOL
dialog: Get out! Max, get out!

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I want to understand it.

scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY - PORT AUTHORITY - NIGHT
text: Max paces on a downtown train as it pulls into 42nd Street.
text: Through the open doors, Max notices a YOUNG PHOTOGRAPHER in
text: jeans and a leather jacket photographing him from the uptown
dialog: platform.
text: Max is enraged and screams at him. The man ducks behind a
text: column, but a few moments later he's back snapping pictures.
text: The doors start to shut, but Max uses his body to get
text: off the train.
text: The Photographer sees him coming and flees.
text: Max follows the man's movement on his platform. When the young

text: Max catches a glimpse of his foe entering the catacombs
text: heading toward Times Square. Max pursues.
text: Max chases him down a looooong passage.
text: But he loses him at an underground five-way fork in the road.
text: One staircase is Uptown and Queens...

speaker_heading: SMASH TO
scene_heading: EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NEON NIGHT
text: In the heart of New York, Max spins around searching for his

text: His frustration mounts until out of the comer of his eye he

text: around to see the source The reflection is from a giant,
text: brilliant stock ticker - 50 yards long and luminous.
text: Max stares at the quotes They are hypnotizing and Max is
text: suddenly calm.
text: Then, Max has a premonition. He turns and spots the

scene_heading: EXT. PORN SHOP - 42ND STREET - NIGHT
text: Max whacks the Photographer against a back-lit image of a

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Who are you working for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER
dialog: Here, here.
dialog: 
text: The photographer hands Max his wallet.
speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: MAX

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Who are you?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER
dialog: I'm...a...student I've got

dialog: 
text: The Photographer pulls out his student ID. Max looks at it.
text: Then he rips out the film-exposing it.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Leave me alone, damn it.
dialog: Leave me alone.
text: Max hands the man back his camera and leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Max heads home in a furious state. Suddenly, he sees two of

text: sees Marcy Dawson blocking his exit.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Marcy? What's up?
dialog: 
text: Max retreats.
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: Let's take a ride, Max.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I can't, I got work...
dialog: 
text: Max looks back at the tough guys who are almost on top of him.
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: We had a deal! NOW get in the limo!
dialog: 
text: Marcy releases a vicious slap that nearly knocks Max down. Max
text: whimpers.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Don't ever hit...
dialog: 
text: He pushes Marcy aside and darts.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT
text: Max flees. Jake and Brad charge after him. They're right on
text: him - he has a meter or so on them.
text: He scurries through a construction site and over a footbridge.
text: Then, he runs into an all-night
speaker_heading: BODEGA
text: The tough guys chase after him and he gets a bit of a
text: lead in the narrow aisles. He pleads with the owners for
dialog: help - nothing doing.
text: Jake heads him off and uses his body to block the aisle. But
text: Max grabs a can of beans and slams it down on the tough guy's

scene_heading: EXT. UNDERNEATH CAR - NIGHT
text: Max dives under a car and crawls for terror. He sees two sets

text: at him.
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: Enough, Max, c'mon out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Leave me alone. I don't
dialog: know anything.
text: Max retreats in the opposite direction. Suddenly Jake and Brad
text: grab him and drag him out.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Hey! Hey! Hey!
dialog: 
text: They search him, taking his wallet, keys, everything.
text: Marcy looks at the guys, who shake their heads. She walks over
text: to Max and shows Max the front page of the Wall Street
text: Journal. It reads, "MARKET CRACHES"
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: You're responsible for this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I didn't do anything. I
dialog: didn't play the market.
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: But we did.
dialog: 
text: Marcy pulls out a folded, worn piece of paper. She opens it.
text: It's Max's stock pick that he threw out. Part of THE number is
dialog: on the page
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: You have to be careful
dialog: where you throw out your trash.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: How could you do that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: You gave us faulty information.
dialog: You gave us the carrot, the right
dialog: picks, but then you only gave us
dialog: part of the code.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You selfish, irresponsible
dialog: cretins. How could you be so
dialog: stupid!?
text: Marcy jabs Max in his stomach. Max falls to the ground. The
text: tough guys sit on him.
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: C'mon, Max. This isn't a
dialog: game anymore. We're playing
dialog: on a global scale. We used
dialog: your code. Foolish...I admit.
dialog: But we can fix things if we
dialog: make some careful picks. Give
dialog: us the rest of the code so
dialog: we can set things right.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: C'mon! I know who you are.
dialog: You're not gonna save the world.
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: Look, Max...
dialog: 
text: Marcy nods to Jake, who pulls out a gun and points it at Max's
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: My God, what are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: Information is
dialog: the private language
dialog: of Capital. We tried to
dialog: establish a symbiotic
dialog: relationship but if
dialog: you choose to compete and
dialog: enter our niche we are forced
dialog: to comply with the laws of
dialog: nature.
dialog: 
text: Max thinks for a second. Max thinks hard. He realizes be
dialog: can't give them the number.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You can't kill me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCY DAWSON
dialog: C'mon, Max. You
dialog: don't get it. I don't
dialog: give a shit about you. I only
dialog: care about what's in your
dialog: fucking head. If you won't help
dialog: us help yourself, then I'll
dialog: have only one choice. Destroy the
dialog: competition. I'll take you
dialog: out of the game. Survival of the
dialog: fittest, Max. And we've got
dialog: the gun.
dialog: 
text: Jake cocks the gun. Max starts to cry.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You bastards! You stupid
dialog: bastards!
text: Suddenly, Jake is whacked with a sawed-off baseball bat.
text: He smashes into the sidewalk.
text: It is Farrouhk, Max's neighbor, who's just pulled up in his
dialog: taxicab.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (Spotting his savior)
dialog: Farrouhk!
dialog: 
text: Farroukh threatens Marcy and the other tough guy, who
text: retreat in fear. Farroubk is afraid as well, so he doesn't

speaker_heading: FARROUHK
dialog: He's sick! He's sick!
dialog: 
text: Max gets to his feet and runs behind Farrouhk.

speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Max!
dialog: 
text: Max looks at Farrouhk and then he looks at Lenny. Ephraim
text: grabs Max and pulls him toward the station wagon.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (To Farrouhk)
dialog: C'mon...
dialog: 
text: Farrouhk heads for his cab. Ephraim helps Max into the
text: backseat of the wagon and climbs in after him.
text: Lenny Meyer jumps into the passenger seat and the gray-bearded

text: Farrouhk jumps into his cab.
scene_heading: INT. LENNY MEYER'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Farrouhk what about Farrouhk!?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Stay down!
dialog:

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: He's okay, he got

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What's going on?

speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Do you have the number?

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah, I have it!

speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: You have it. Where is it?
dialog: You have it written down?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
text: Lenny nods to Ephraim, who starts scanning through
text: Max's pockets. Max resists. The other guys hold him down.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What are you doing!? What
dialog: the hell are you doing!?
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: We're not joking
dialog: around, Max? Where's
dialog: the number?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (Pushing Ephraim away)
dialog: It's not on me. It's in my
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: You memorized it?
dialog: Did you give it to them?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Who!? Those
dialog: Wall Street bastards.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Why do you care?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Just answer me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Screw you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: (In Hebrew)
dialog: Hit him!
dialog: 
text: Yisrael screeches the car to a halt. He spins around in his

speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: You're dealing with something
dialog: really big now, Max. I don't
dialog: want to hurt you, so answer
dialog: me. Did you give it to them?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: They've got part of it
dialog: Now get off me!
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Damn it! Damn it!
dialog: They're using it.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Using what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Shut up!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Let go!
dialog: 
text: Max chews into Ephraim's hand which is pinning him. Ephraim
text: screams and lets loose a punch to Max's jaw.
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: No, don't!
dialog: 
dialog: But Lenny is late, and Max's world - as well as ours goes
dialog: black.
scene_heading: INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Max stares suspiciously at the bathroom. He slowly picks up
text: his drill. Wielding it like a hammer, he carefully advances
dialog: into the
text: BATHROOM where he looks into the sink. He almost vomits when
text: he sees a piece of human brain sitting above the drain. Ants
text: swarm across its surface.
text: Max becomes furious. He whacks it with the drill. Blood flies
text: up into his face. In a wild rage, he smashes it and punches
dialog: it.
text: Then he drops the drill and uses his bare hands to shove it
text: down the drain. Screaming like a madman, he jams it until it
text: is gone.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT SHUL - DAY
text: A wise-looking, bearded Hasidic man with benevolent, piercing
text: eyes stands tenderly over Max. He wears traditional black
text: clothes. Lenny Meyer paces nervously in the background.
text: As Max comes through, RAV COHEN speaks.
speaker_heading: RAV COHEN
dialog: Max, Max. You're
dialog: okay I'm Rabbi Cohen. Cohen
dialog: like you. I'm sorry for what
dialog: Lenny did, he's been
dialog: reprimanded. It is not our way
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah, yeah
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAV COHEN
dialog: Everything will be
dialog: fine, Max. You need to give
dialog: us the number. Do you have
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: (Charging over)
dialog: I told you we don't know
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You wouldn't be so
dialog: flipped out if you didn't
dialog: know. What's happening to me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: Give us the number!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Screw you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAV COHEN
dialog: Okay, okay! Lenny,
dialog: easy! Max, I'll tell you
dialog: what's going on. Just calm
dialog: down.
dialog: (Deep breath, then)
dialog: The Talmud tells us it began two
dialog: thousand years ago, when the
dialog: Romans destroyed the second
dialog: temple.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What are you...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAV COHEN
dialog: Just give me a chance.
dialog: You'll understand everything
dialog: if you listen.
dialog: 
text: Max takes out his pills and starts feeding himself some.
speaker_heading: RAV COHEN
dialog: The Romans also
dialog: murdered all of our priest-
dialog: hoodthe Cohanimthe Cohens,
dialog: and with their deaths they
dialog: destroyed our greatest
text: secret. In the center of the
dialog: great temple was the holy of
dialog: holies which was the heart of
dialog: Jewish life. This was the
dialog: earthly residence for our
dialog: God. The one God. It
dialog: contained the ark of the
dialog: Tabernacle which stored the
dialog: original Ten Commandments
dialog: that God gave to Moses. Only
dialog: one man could enter this
dialog: space once a year on the
dialog: holiest day of the year, Yom
dialog: Kippur On the Day of
dialog: Atonement, all of Israel
dialog: would descend upon Jerusalem
dialog: to witness the High Cohen's
dialog: trip into the holy of holies.
dialog: If the holy man was pure he
dialog: would reemerge a few moments
dialog: later and Israel was secured
dialog: a prosperous year. It meant
dialog: that we were one yea r closer
text: to the messianic age. Closer
dialog: to the return of the Garden
dialog: of Eden. But if he was
dialog: impure, he would die
dialog: instantly and it meant that
dialog: we were doomed. The High
dialog: Cohen had a single ritual to
dialog: perform in the holy of holies.
dialog: He had to intone a single
dialog: word.
text: Rav Cohen takes a dramatic pause. Max is anxious to hear the
text: end of the story.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: So?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAV COHEN
dialog: That word was the true name of God.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAV COHEN
dialog: The true name, which only
dialog: the Cohanim knew, was two
dialog: hundred and sixteen letters
dialog: long.
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (Incredulous)
dialog: You're telling me that the number in
dialog: my head is the name of God!?
text: Wondrously, Max rubs the scar on his head.
speaker_heading: RAV COHEN
dialog: (Passion building)
dialog: Yes...it's The key into
dialog: the messianic age. As the
dialog: Romans burned the temple, the
dialog: Talmud says, the High Cohen
text: walked into the flames. He
dialog: took his secret to the top of
text: the burning building. The
dialog: heavens opened up and took
dialog: the key from the priest's
dialog: outstretched hand. We've been
dialog: searching for the key ever
dialog: since. And you may have found
dialog: it. Now let us find out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That's what happened. I
dialog: saw God.
speaker_heading: RAV COHEN
dialog: No, no, Max.
dialog: You're not pure. You can't
dialog: see God unless you're pure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It's more than God...
dialog: it s everything. It's math
dialog: and science and nature...
dialog: the universe. I saw the
dialog: Universe's DNA
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAV COHEN
dialog: You saw nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I saw everything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAV COHEN
dialog: There's much more.
dialog: We can unlock the door with
dialog: the key. It will show God
dialog: that we are pure again. He
dialog: will return us to The Garden.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Garden? You're not pure.
dialog: I'm the one who has the
dialog: number
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAV COHEN
dialog: Who do you think
dialog: you are? You are a vessel
dialog: from our God. You are
text: carrying a delivery that
dialog: needs to be made to us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It was given to me. It's
dialog: part of me. It's changing me.
speaker_heading: RAV COHEN
dialog: It's killing you.
dialog: Because you are impure.
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: It will kill you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: And what will it do to
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: LENNY MEYER
dialog: We're pure. Give
dialog: us the number!
speaker_heading: MAX

dialog: sure you've written down
dialog: every two hundred sixteen number.
dialog: You've translated all of
dialog: them. You've intoned them
dialog: all. Haven't you? But what's
dialog: it gotten you? It's not the
dialog: number! It's the meaning.
dialog: It's the syntax. It's what's
dialog: between the numbers. If you
dialog: could understand you would.
dialog: But it's not for you! I've
dialog: got it. I understand it. I'm
dialog: going to see it!
dialog: (Whispers to Rav Cohen)
dialog: Rabbi...I was chosen.

dialog: and she is Sol's niece.
speaker_heading: JENNY ROBESON
dialog: Can I help you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: MAX

text: Jenny's eyes drop.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: Max rushes into Sol s study. The room is covered with Sol's P,
dialog: research books. It seems Sol had recently come out of

text: piece of paper with Sol's handwriting on it. On the paper is
text: THE number. Max slides it into his pocket.

text: spiral across the board.

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (Courageously)
dialog: No. No. I'm ready. I'm
dialog: ready! Show me!
text: Max recites THE number and uses it to get to his feet. The
text: pain rips apart his voice.
text: Max's pain and anger transform into violence. He attacks
text: Euclid furiously. He recites the number with rage in his
dialog: voice.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Three, seven, two...
dialog: 
text: He smashes the old computer apart. He tosses his step stool
text: through the mainframe.
text: Then he goes to the window and tries to rip off the cardboard
text: covering the glass panes. Nothing doing, so he yanks the
text: entire window wide open.
text: Sunlight floods the room and throws Max into the
scene_heading: BLINDING WHITE VOID
text: where Max looks around starry-eyed. The pain is gone.
text: Everything is new to Max - even his hands. The stress leases
text: from his brow and his shoulders sag.
text: Max continues to recite the number His voice becomes tender

speaker_heading: DEVI (O.S.)
dialog: Max. Max! Are you
dialog: okay!? Oh my God, Max!
text: Her voice reaches into the void.
speaker_heading: DEVI (O.S)

dialog: No, Max. No.
dialog: Stay with me Max. Stay with
dialog: me.
dialog: 
dialog: And then we cut back to
speaker_heading: THE MAIN ROOM
text: where Devi grabs Max's palm. Max's fingers wrap around her
dialog: hand. We return to
scene_heading: THE BLINDING WHITE VOID
text: where Max stops reciting the number. He suddenly opens his
text: fear filled eyes.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Where am I? What is
dialog: this? This is wrong, Sol.

speaker_heading: DEVI
dialog: Yes, breathe, Max.
dialog: Breathe...
text: Max sobs. He holds onto her for dear life
text: And then be realizes that Devi is not in his arms. He is
text: holding onto himself.
text: Then Max notices Sol's note on the ground. He looks at the
text: number. He collects himself and catches his breath.
scene_heading: INT. MAX'S BATHROOM  DAY
text: Max looks at Sol's note. He lights a match and burns it.
text: Next, he prepares something in the sink.
text: We hear the WHINE of a motor. Then it stops, Max looks at
text: himself in the mirror, He smiles. Then he gets solemn.
text: He takes a deep breath. Then we hear the motor again. Max
text: lifts up his arm. He's holding a drill. He places the bit
text: against the math section of his scalp.
text: He applies pressure and drills into his brain.
text: Max collapses as we quickly
