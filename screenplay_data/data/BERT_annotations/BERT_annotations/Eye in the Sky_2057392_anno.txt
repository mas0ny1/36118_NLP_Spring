scene_heading: ON SCREEN: EASTLEIGH, NAIROBI, KENYA - 06h00
text: A scraping sound as the door of a small brick oven opens.
text: FATIMA MO'ALLIM, early 30's, slender, Somali, reaches in and
text: places loaves of unbaked bread into the wood-fire oven.
text: A worn blue headscarf - a hijab - is wrapped around her head
text: to cover her hair but still reveals her beautiful face.
text: FATIMA runs a small home bakery business within the walls of
dialog: the family compound.
text: The bakery opens onto a sandy courtyard that surrounds a
text: small rough brick home with a corrugated sheet metal roof and
text: a separate, small roughly constructed bicycle workshop.
text: There are bicycles and bits of bicycles everywhere.
text: FATIMA’S husband, MUSA (30's) sits on a crate amidst the
text: bicycles he repairs putting the finishing touches onto a home
text: made “hula hoop” made of black PVC tubing.
text: His young daughter, ALIA, 10, watches with impatient
text: excitement as he inserts a plastic connector into the tube to
text: join the two ends in a hoop.
speaker_heading: ALIA ALIA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ALIA ALIA (CONT'D)
dialog: This is my best one ever! Kani waa midka aan weligeyga
dialog: Jeelaandoono!
dialog: (Kani waa midka aan weli-gay-

text: MUSA smiles, and hands her the hoop. ALIA takes it. She
text: swings it over her body and around her waist - and SPINS it.
text: She swings her hips, making the hoop swirl around her body.
speaker_heading: ALIA ALIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, Mama! Hooyo, Fiiri!
dialog: (Hoy-yo Fee-ree!)
text: FATIMA looks out into the yard at her and smiles.
text: As ALIA continues to spin the hoop, the CAMERA RISES UP over
text: her and continues to rise, higher and higher, until we are
dialog: seeing:
text: A BIRD’S-EYE VIEW of the compound within the surrounding
dialog: neighbourhood setting.
text: Their home is in a Somali Militia controlled neighbourhood of
text: Nairobi. The sun has just risen, but people are already on
dialog: the move.
text: Beyond the safety and privacy of the walled family compound,
text: militia hang out on street corners and guard unofficial
text: checkpoint barriers on neighbourhood entrances, making it a
dialog: no-go area for the Kenyan police.
text: Within this no-go area they stop cars and search anyone they
text: suspect of being a Kenyan security police collaborator.
text: Four YOUNG MEN drive past Alia’s compound in a pickup truck
text: with a machine gun bolted on to the back. They set the
dialog: neighbourhood tone.
text: As we rise higher we reveal that the whole area is a rabbit-
text: warren of streets, shops and market stalls.

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - POWELL’S HOUSE - SURREY - NIGHT 2
text: COLONEL KATHERINE POWELL lies awake in bed. Her husband SIMON
text: sleeps beside her in an eye mask.
scene_heading: ON SCREEN: SURREY, ENGLAND - 03h15
text: The thud of music is coming from another room: Quiet, but
text: loud enough to be irritating once one becomes aware of it.
text: POWELL has become aware of it and it is now irritating her.
text: She gets up.
scene_heading: INT. LANDING - POWELL’S HOUSE - SURREY - NIGHT 3
text: POWELL, in her pyjamas, exits her bedroom, crosses the
text: landing and stops at the bedroom from where the monotonous
text: bass is emanating.
text: She stands for a moment, wondering whether to enter the room.
text: She decides against it.
scene_heading: EXT. ALIA’S COMPOUND - EASTLEIGH - DAWN 4
text: ALIA swings her hips as the hoop whizzes around her body.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - POWELL’S HOUSE - SURREY - NIGHT 5
text: POWELL, still in her pyjamas but now also in slippers and a
text: dressing gown, enters the kitchen.
text: A Labrador dog, Jesse, gets up out of a basket.
text: POWELL pats the dog’s head, goes to the kitchen tap and
text: drinks some water. A routine.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN - POWELL’S HOUSE - SURREY - NIGHT 6
text: POWELL, with Jesse following, exits the house. She walks
text: across the garden to an office ‘shed’ and unlocks a bolted

scene_heading: EXT. ALIA’S COMPOUND - EASTLEIGH - DAWN 7
text: ALIA, laughing, swings her hips. The hoop whizzes around her.
scene_heading: YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 4.
scene_heading: INT. POWELL’S GARDEN OFFICE - SURREY - NIGHT 8
text: POWELL withdraws a secure dongle from a pocket in her gown
text: and plugs it into a USB port in a computer on a desk.
dialog: Jesse knows the routine: he has a basket in here too and he
text: lies down in it.
text: The office is full of military books, files, mementoes and
dialog: photographs: her entire military career is in this room - and
dialog: we immediately understand that this is where she lives out
text: her life. The house is just where she sleeps.
text: While her computer boots up, POWELL glances at a large pin
text: board on a wall beside her desk:
text: It is covered in hand-written notes and SURVEILLANCE
text: PHOTOGRAPHS taken in various foreign locations of WANTED
dialog: HVI's - High Value Individuals.
text: The faces are mostly Somali, but we also notice a young
text: British Muslim student named RASHEED HAMUD, and a young
text: American named MUHAMMAD ABDISALAAM. (Note: It does not matter
dialog: whether we know their nationality at this point, but their
dialog: dress is clearly western.)
text: One photograph in particular stands out from the rest:
text: A WHITE WOMAN wearing a deep blue head scarf (a hijab) which
text: covers her hair. The name SUSAN HELEN DANFORD appears beneath
text: the picture, as well as the name “AYESHA AL-HADY."
text: Another picture shows Danford without her hijab. She’s an
text: attractive woman in her early thirties.
text: In yet another she is with a man named ABDULLAH AL-HADY - who
dialog: we will learn is her husband.
text: Still other pictures of her show her in various foreign
text: locations. A few copies of different PASSPORTS show her image
scene_heading: with different names: ALLISON WEST, REBECCA SUTTON.
text: Below the images of Danford and Al-Hady are dozens of other
text: YOUNG FACES - some Western dressed, some local Somali
dialog: fighters with weapons.
text: Some have been inked out in red.
text: POWELL stares at the image of Danford for a moment.
text: Then her computer BLEEPS and she turns to check her in-box.
text: An email message comes up with A PICTURE OF A YOUNG ARMY
text: CORPORAL in a wheelchair wearing PROSTHETIC LEGS. We read:
text: YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 5.
dialog: Dear Colonel Powell
dialog: The new legs are good. I can walk to the shops, but I don't
dialog: see the point in doing that, or in doing anything.
dialog: Captain Kirby has suggested...
text: She scrolls to the end:
dialog: .-. to be honest, I wish I had died.
dialog: Corporal Shane Allen.
text: Powell sits staring blankly at the picture of the crippled
text: soldier. She is, for a moment, lost. Then she begins to type
dialog: a reply.
dialog: Dear Corporal Allen
dialog: Do not lose hope. Once you recover, I promise to assist in
dialog: reassigning you...
text: As she types, an INCOMING EMAIL ALERT pops up on her screen.
dialog: Subject: “More news on Ben.”
text: Powell stops writing her reply to the first email.
text: She hesitates, then opens the new one.
speaker_heading: We READ:
dialog: This was posted an hour ago.
dialog: http: //www.al-news.org/watch_now/
dialog: Still can't believe we lost him.
dialog: Good luck this morning.
dialog: Talk later.
dialog: Frank

dialog: the email.
text: A NEWS VIDEO CLIP opens.
text: It shows HAND HELD FOOTAGE of A YOUNG, DEAD, AFRICAN MAN in
text: plain clothes lying in filth in an alley. He has been shot in
text: the back of the head. Blood pools around his shoulders.
dialog: 10
text: YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 6.
text: The VOICE of a REPORTER plays over the footage, which cuts to
text: various images of Al-Shabaab Militants chanting with weapons
text: raised, and graphics of the geographical area described.
speaker_heading: REPORTER'S VOICE
dialog: Somali Al-Shabaab militants have
dialog: posted this picture of an unnamed
dialog: man they say they have executed in
dialog: Nairobi. The group claims he was
dialog: working for British military
dialog: intelligence attempting to
dialog: infiltrate their international
dialog: recruitment networks. Al-Shabaab
dialog: want to impose their strict version
dialog: of Sharia law across the horn of
dialog: Africa. They bitterly resent the
dialog: role of Britain and the Kenyan
dialog: military in propping up the UN
dialog: backed Somali government in
dialog: Mogadishu. The Ministry of Defense
dialog: has declined to comment, but
dialog: denounced the execution as
dialog: “sickening.”
text: Affected, but stoic, POWELL watches in icy silence.

text: POWELL, now in Wellington boots and a weatherproof jacket,

speaker_heading: HAROLD

speaker_heading: COLONEL POWELL

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: A missile from the Reaper?
speaker_heading: COLONEL POWELL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: So this is no longer a capture

speaker_heading: COLONEL POWELL

speaker_heading: COLONEL POWELL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: The Rules of Engagement you are
dialog: operating under only allow for a
dialog: low CDE.
speaker_heading: COLONEL POWELL
dialog: Yes, and my weapons only invoke a
dialog: low CDE. It’s the explosives inside
dialog: the house that bring it to a
text: potentially high CDE.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: And since you know the explosives
dialog: are there, it is incumbent upon you
dialog: to take account of them. I can see
dialog: a potential legal objection.
speaker_heading: COLONEL POWELL
dialog: Jesus, we have two suicide bombers
dialog: and three very High Value

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: And you want them off your list, I
dialog: understand that. But the Rules of

speaker_heading: COLONEL POWELL
dialog: Are you telling me that, or just

speaker_heading: HAROLD

scene_heading: LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON

dialog: The discussion continues:
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Angela, I agree we are at risk of

text: embarking on a ‘shoot to kill’
dialog: policy. But since all the legal
dialog: criteria are sound - I believe we
dialog: must allow this military action to
dialog: continue.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Legally we may be safe, but
dialog: politically, we are walking into a
text: minefield. Especially with an
dialog: American citizen involved.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON
dialog: Do I have permission, Minister?
text: They again all turn to WOODALE. He sweats:
speaker_heading: WOODALE
dialog: Well, given the situation - that it
dialog: is a change of mission - that it is
text: now a missile attack on a British
dialog: subject - in fact two British
dialog: subjects, and an American, and ina
dialog: friendly country - I think it is

dialog: to the Foreign Secretary.

scene_heading: LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: With respect, Minister, you have
dialog: heard the arguments and he hasn't.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: And the rules of engagement mean
dialog: that the Prime Minister has already
dialog: approved it - and therefore the
dialog: Foreign Secretary's input should
dialog: not be relevant...
speaker_heading: WOODALE
dialog: (interrupting, annoyed)
dialog: No, the point is, I have not been a
dialog: party to previous discussions with
dialog: the PM on such matters and the
dialog: Foreign Secretary will have been!
dialog: So... I do have a duty to refer the

speaker_heading: COLONEL POWELL (CONT'D)

text: YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 74.
speaker_heading: MUSHTAQ (CONT’D)
dialog: If the men stay in this room - and
dialog: this here is the target area - we
dialog: would expect a one hundred per cent
dialog: mortality rate in the room, an
dialog: eighty-five to ninety-five per cent
dialog: mortality rate within this area and
dialog: anything outside the building -
dialog: this area here in the street - a
dialog: sixty-five to seventy-five per cent
dialog: rate. That is just the Hellfire. If
dialog: we factor in the explosives in the
dialog: vests... We are looking at even
dialog: more extensive damage - way out to
dialog: this area here - but I can’t
dialog: accurately estimate that payload.
speaker_heading: COLONEL POWELL
dialog: But we would be containing that
dialog: payload in the vests within those
dialog: walls, right? Far less collateral
dialog: damage than them going off ina

speaker_heading: MUSHTAQ
dialog: Yes... Of course.

text: POWELL is still keeping an eye on all her screens.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Do we have an assessment of what

speaker_heading: COLONEL POWELL
dialog: The targeteer assesses a 65 to 75
dialog: percent chance of fatal injury
dialog: should we proceed. But he has also
dialog: assessed a projected loss of life
dialog: of between thirty and eighty men,
dialog: women and children if the vests are
text: detonated in an urban area. It’s a

dialog: damage: In other words to release

dialog: will remain so... It is quite
dialog: another thing to release a

dialog: will, at worst, be fatally

speaker_heading: ANGELA

speaker_heading: COLONEL POWELL
dialog: Secretary, this is an ethical
dialog: argument we cannot get into at this
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Colonel, perhaps you should address
dialog: that comment to the little girl
dialog: selling her bread! The ethical
dialog: argument is precisely what we must
dialog: “get into.”
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: Ma’am, I hope the fact that she is
text: a sweet “little girl” is not

text: YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 102.
speaker_heading: GOLDMAN
dialog: Our point of view here at the
dialog: White House is that we should
dialog: attack this target immediately.
dialog: As the military members of your
dialog: committee know, we have a points
dialog: system that takes into account
dialog: collateral damage to deduce what
dialog: is, and what is not, a legal
dialog: strike. And let me tell you,
dialog: categorically, that the existence
dialog: of this new circumstance does not
dialog: push us beyond a legitimate
dialog: military action. We are way off
dialog: what we would consider a dispute in
dialog: this matter.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Ms. Goldman, we have a somewhat
dialog: different approach to the
dialog: question of collateral damage...
speaker_heading: GOLDMAN
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Sir, you must act NOW. You have two
text: men about to embark on a suicide
dialog: mission; you have number two, four
dialog: and five on the President’s East
dialog: Africa kill list in your sights -
dialog: and you are putting the whole
dialog: operation at risk because of one
dialog: collateral damage issue?! I realize
dialog: this mission is your call, but
dialog: there will be some mighty angry
dialog: people here in the White House, and
dialog: at the Pentagon, and out there in
dialog: the world, if you allow these

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Forgive me, I’m not sure that helps

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (awkward)
dialog: James, given the developing

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Is that “Yes”?

scene_heading: LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON
dialog: Foreign Secretary, there is a

dialog: In our view they will be making a

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Gentlemen, what action is being
dialog: legally recommended to me?!
text: GEORGE sweats. WOODALE steps in:
speaker_heading: WOODALE
dialog: James, the legal argument is that

speaker_heading: COLONEL POWELL
dialog: Sir, if we do not act now we risk
dialog: losing the lives of up to eighty

speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: With respect, you can only assume
dialog: those deaths - but what is certain
dialog: is that, if we do act now, this one
dialog: girl will suffer.

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: James, Angela makes a compelling
dialog: point. If Al-Shabaab kill eighty

dialog: If we kill one girl, they do.
speaker_heading: JAMES

dialog: any other option.
speaker_heading: MUSHTAQ
dialog: Yes, Ma’am. I understand that.
text: But MUSHTAQ doesn’t understand it. POWELL’S military
dialog: intelligence career has been reduced to lying about
dialog: percentages in order to complete her mission.
text: MUSHTAQ stares at her, numb.
speaker_heading: COLONEL POWELL
dialog: You will file your report as a 45
dialog: percent CDE.
text: Silence from MUSHTAQ.
speaker_heading: COLONEL POWELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Sergeant?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: MUSHTAQ
dialog: 45 percent. Yes, Colonel.
text: POWELL can’t hold MUSHTAQ’S look.

speaker_heading: COLONEL WALSH
dialog: Steve you need to get us close in

scene_heading: INT. GROUND CONTROL STATION - NIGHT 342
text: STEVE and CARRIE glance at each other.

scene_heading: INT. GROUND CONTROL STATION - NIGHT 344

text: We see Nairobi far, far below.
text: The Reaper turns around and heads back home.
scene_heading: INT. BRIEFING ROOM A - WHITEHALL - LATE AFTERNOON 348
text: The meeting is over. GEORGE and BRIAN leave quietly, briefly,

speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: In my opinion, that was
dialog: disgraceful. And all done from the
dialog: safety of your chair.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON
dialog: I have attended the immediate
text: aftermath of five suicide bombings.
text: On the ground. With the bodies.
dialog: What you witnessed today, with your
text: coffee and biscuits, is terrible.
dialog: What these men would have done
dialog: would have been even more terrible.
dialog: That is how it is.
dialog: (almost killing her with
dialog: the line)
dialog: Never tell a soldier that he does
dialog: not know the cost of war.
text: He takes his briefcase and walks out.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - COBRA - WHITEHALL - LATE AFTERNOON 349
text: As BENSON exits the room, his AIDE-DE-CAMP hands him the

scene_heading: LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON
dialog: Thank you, Captain.
text: He takes the doll and walks away down the quiet hallway.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDORS / OPERATING THEATRE - HOSPITAL - DUSK 350

text: Moving down the corridor, they shout for attendance.
text: A NURSE rushes forward.
text: Seeing the extent of Alia’s injuries, she rushes them into a
text: rudimentary operating theater.
text: MUSA lays ALIA onto an operating table.
text: A DOCTOR approaches quickly and takes a look at her.
text: But it doesn’t take him long to realize that ALIA is dead.
text: He looks at FATIMA and MUSA.

speaker_heading: 351
text: YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 134.
text: An agonising silence. And it slowly dawns on them that they
dialog: have lost her.
text: CLOSE ON ALIA - lying there, very still.
text: And then MUSA lets out the grieving roar of an animal that
text: echoes into the next scene -
scene_heading: EXT. CREECH AIR FORCE BASE - DAWN A350
text: CAMERA PANS across a vast, empty desert, and finds the
text: isolated airforce base shimmering in early morning heat.
scene_heading: EXT. GROUND CONTROL STATION - MORNING 351
text: A METAL DOOR is shoved open hard. STEVE and CARRIE step out
text: into the blazing sun and blinding light of the Nevada desert.
text: They stop as they see COLONEL WALSH standing alone in the
text: harsh light a short distance away, silently waiting for them.
text: STEVE holds a canned drink. His hand shakes. Adrenalin has
text: kept him going. Now he is drained. A mental wreck.
text: CARRIE looks confused. Can’t process what has just happened.
text: WALSH eyes them both, then tries awkwardly to offer comfort:
speaker_heading: COLONEL WALSH
dialog: You did well. Both of you.
text: They stand in silence for a moment.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Will you let me know what happened
dialog: to the girl?
speaker_heading: COLONEL WALSH
dialog: I will find out.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I need to know that.
speaker_heading: COLONEL WALSH
dialog: I know you do.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Text me or something.
speaker_heading: COLONEL WALSH
dialog: I’1l do that.

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: Silence again. Then -
speaker_heading: COLONEL WALSH
dialog: We should get you home... I need
dialog: you back here in twelve hours.
text: STEVE and CARRIE stare at COLONEL WALSH blankly. Lost.
scene_heading: EXT. ALIA’S COMPOUND - EASTLEIGH - DAWN (FLASHBACK) 352
text: ALIA, laughing, swinging her hips, her hula hoop whizzing
text: around her.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - A ROAD - ENGLAND - NIGHT 353
text: CLOSE ON POWELL, as if she is seeing the image of ALIA,
text: driving in silence for a while, lost in thought.
text: Then she snaps out of her reverie and taps the screen on her
text: car's inboard computer. She selects ‘check messages’.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE
dialog: You have one unheard message...
text: Her husband's voice comes on.
speaker_heading: SIMON (V.O.)
dialog: Katherine, I want you to know that
dialog: I don’t appreciate your angry calls
dialog: first thing in the morning. Neither
dialog: do the boys want to be humiliated
text: in front of their girlfriends.
dialog: Robert is under a lot of stress
dialog: with his exams so you back off.
text: This is just about the last thing she wants to hear. As she
text: drives on, she is as tense as she was in the morning.
text: We pre-lap the rising SOUND of an angry crowd...
scene_heading: EXT. AMADU’S COMPOUND - EASTLEIGH - DUSK 354
text: A large crowd has gathered in the street outside the bombed
text: house. Placards denouncing America and Britain are waved.
text: Weapons brandished.
text: Some of them set fire to a United Nations flag - and angrily
text: wave the burning emblem.
text: YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 136.
text: Camera rises up, slowly leaving the crowd below.
text: As we rise higher, clouds slowly move in, until the view
