scene_heading: 1 INT. AIRPLANE - DAY 1
text: On a chartered plane flying from Miami to Newark Airport.
text: JACK is the captain. His copilot PAUL is seated beside
text: him. In the passenger cabin, a female gymnastics team is
text: celebrating a hard-won, glorious victory over the Miami
text: team. They are singing, dancing in the aisles and
dialog: drinking champagne.
text: In the rear of the cabin, there are three regular pass-
text: engers: a teenager, his mother, and a man who appears to
dialog: be a BUSINESSMAN.
text: The plane is flying over the coastline.
text: The partition between the cockpit and the passenger cabin
text: is open. Jack is very excited. He can't stop turning
text: around to look at the passengers.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Paul)
dialog: Oh my God! I can't believe my
dialog: eyes! Look at these women! Will
dialog: you look at the gorgeous calves on
dialog: them?! I'm telling you, give me
dialog: an athlete any day... Oh God!
dialog: Look at that redhead over there,
dialog: and look at that one! Christ,
dialog: I hadn't noticed her.
dialog: (miming a heart
dialog: attack)
dialog: Paul, I've just fallen madly in
dialog: love with the most beautiful
dialog: woman in the world...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (totally
dialog: uninterested)
dialog: Oh yeah? Which one?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (as though about
dialog: to keel over)
dialog: The blonde over there, she's too
dialog: gorgeous for words. Just look at
dialog: those eyes, look at those
text: shoulders and the way she moves.
dialog: I'm in love. Here, take over,
dialog: I'll be right back.
dialog: 3.
text: Jack gets up and Paul takes his place at the controls.
text: Jack makes his way up the aisle, through the girls who
text: are blocking the way, to the object of his affections.
text: She is sitting in one of the aisle seats and singing
text: her head off. Jack leans over and whispers, quickly and
text: intensely, to her.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hello. I'm the captain of this
dialog: plane. May I ask your name?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Sure, my name is Jane. Why?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Listen, Jane, I've seen many
dialog: beautiful women in my life but I
dialog: swear to you, I've never, ever
dialog: met a woman as exquisite as you
dialog: are.
text: Jack kneels down before her, and the Girl looks at him,
text: amused. He takes her hand and places it over his heart.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Jane, can you feel my heart? It's
dialog: pounding. This is horrible, I
dialog: think I'm gonna faint. Listen: I'm
dialog: madly in love with you, I'm single
dialog: and here's my phone number.
text: He hands her his business card.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm putting my fate in your hands.
dialog: If you don't call me, you'll make
dialog: me the most miserable man on earth.
dialog: This is no line and I'm not trying
dialog: to get you into bed. This is
dialog: something completely different. I
dialog: love you Jane and if you call me I'll
dialog: be the happiest man in the entire
dialog: universe -- this is 'love at first
dialog: sight.' Out of all these beautiful
dialog: women I noticed only you, and...
text: The Girl laughs as Jack goes on. Meanwhile, the Busi-
text: nessman who was seated in the rear of the plane has
text: gotten up and walked over to Jack.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: Are you Paul?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, I'm not.
dialog: (to Jane)
dialog: 4.
dialog: My name's Jack and I live in a
dialog: fabulous apartment in Manhattan
text: overlooking the park and...
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: But you're the pilot, aren't you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yes, I'm the pilot...
dialog: (to Jane)
dialog: ... I'm not even asking for your
dialog: phone number...
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: Isn't there a pilot whose name is
dialog: Paul?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Yeah, the copilot -- he's up
dialog: front...
text: The Businessman disappears in the direction of the
dialog: cockpit.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (back to Jane)
dialog: I'm leaving it all up to you,
dialog: Jane, but if you do give me
dialog: your phone number, then Jane,
dialog: then...
text: The Businessman has reached the cockpit.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: (in a low tone)
dialog: Are you Paul?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (turning around
dialog: nervously)
dialog: Yeah... Are you Jim?
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: Yeah.
text: He hands Paul a man's purse.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: Here's your cash.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What about the stuff?
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: I don't have it. We've got
dialog: problems. Too much heat. Too
dialog: 5.
dialog: risky. We think the cops are
dialog: on to us.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Whadda ya mean us? You mean me?
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: I mean shut up and listen. Two
dialog: guys will be waiting for you in
text: a black T-Bird, expecting the
dialog: dope. Just ignore them. It'll
dialog: be delivered to you on Sunday
dialog: and picked up the following
dialog: Thursday, okay?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: But I won't be home, I'll be in
dialog: the air for two weeks.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: That's your problem. Make
dialog: arrangements, a deal's a deal.
dialog: Got it!?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Got it.
text: Jack returns.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (bursting with
dialog: excitement)
dialog: I got her phone number! She gave
dialog: me her phone number!
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: That's some magnificent view,
dialog: isn't it?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's wonderful -- Life is
dialog: wonderful!
text: The Businessman goes back to his seat and Jack grabs
text: hold of the microphone.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: This is your captain speaking. In
dialog: honor of your victory, in honor of
dialog: your beauty, and in honor of Jane,
dialog: the most beautiful gymnast I have
dialog: ever met. I'm going to give you a
dialog: little demonstration of aviation
dialog: gymnastics -- reserved only for the
dialog: most important guest, hip, hip...
text: Everyone shouts "HOORAY!" except for Paul and the
dialog: 6.
text: Businessman, who remain grim.
text: Jack dips the plane very low over the water and skims the
text: cliffs along the coast. It is a beautiful, impressive
text: stunt. There are gleeful shouts in the cabin among the
dialog: passengers.
scene_heading: 2 INT. NEWARK AIRPORT - PASSENGER TERMINAL - DAY 2
text: Jack is saying an emotional goodbye to Jane as she leaves
text: with her teammates. Jane finds it all very funny, but
text: Jack looks totally wretched seeing her go.
text: Jack and Paul walk toward the exit.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: God, what a woman!
text: Paul is nervous, glancing uneasily from car to car.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Wanna share a cab?
dialog: Paul
dialog: Yeah, sure!
text: A black Ford pulls up in front of them and its driver
text: looks at Paul who immediately turns his back on him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She's so beautiful! I've never
dialog: been so in love before. Can you
dialog: believe she gave me her phone
dialog: number... Oh, Christ -- where is
dialog: it?... Oh, no, don't tell me I
dialog: lost it... It's a matter of life
dialog: and death... Oh here it is --
dialog: thank God!
text: All the while Jack has been rambling on, a beige car
text: on the other side of the street has slowed down. Paul
text: notices it. In the beige car, a narcotics agent, GRATON,
text: is behind the wheel with one of his colleagues sitting
text: beside him.
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: They're slowing down. Take a
dialog: picture.
text: The colleague snaps a picture of everyone who happens to
text: be standing near the black Ford, including Jack and Paul.
text: The black Ford pulls out. The beige car follows it.
text: Paul observes all this out of the corner of his eye.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Listen, I need a favor, I got
dialog: 7.
dialog: a little problem.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, sure... Hey, look, will you
dialog: -- look at that sparkling beauty.
text: A very beautiful woman is coming down the walkway with
text: cart overflowing with luggage. One of them falls off.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah... I mean, it's like...
dialog: There's this little package...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She'll never make it with all
dialog: that luggage she's got. I gotta
dialog: give her a hand. Look at the
dialog: colors in her hair! Christ, I've
dialog: never seen a woman like her
dialog: before...
text: He's about to walk off when Paul grabs him by the arm.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Jack, listen, can I...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sure you can, no problem...
dialog: Listen, I gotta go now, I'm
dialog: gonna see if she'll share a cab
dialog: with me. You take the shuttle,
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: But I gotta explain to you
dialog: about...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Come over to my place tonight.
dialog: We're having a huge party. Come
dialog: around 9, okay? See ya later.
text: Jack races toward the woman and begins to help her
text: with the fallen luggage. We see him talking to her
text: and we can hear a little of what he's saying.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: As exquisite as you are...
dialog: I think I'm gonna faint.
text: He kneels, takes her hand and puts it over his heart.
text: The young woman is flabbergasted.
text: A lonely-looking Paul hails the shuttle bus.
dialog: 8.
scene_heading: 3 INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT 3
text: A large, stylishly decorated apartment in Manhattan.
text: A tremendous living room. A party's going on. Very
text: LOUD JAZZ is PLAYING. The lights are dim. There are
text: about 30 guests. Lots of young pretty women. Gourmet
text: buffet. People are sitting on couches talking, others
text: are eating, drinking or dancing. In a dimly-lit corner,
text: Jack is kneeling before a girl sitting in an armchair.
text: She is laughing as she listens to him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (whispering
dialog: passionately)
dialog: This is no line and I'm not
dialog: trying to get you into bed. This
dialog: is something completely different.
dialog: This is 'love at first sight.'
dialog: Oh, I'm so happy... Let me go get
dialog: you a glass of champagne. I'll
dialog: be right back.
text: Jack gets up and goes over to the buffet. As soon as
text: he's out of the girl's line of sight, he starts running
text: toward the other end of the apartment. On the way he
text: passes MICHAEL, who's deeply engrossed in a vehement
text: conversation about modern art with a girl called SOPHIA.
text: They're fighting like cats and dogs but seem to be enjoy-
dialog: ing it.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Are you saying that's art, are
dialog: you really saying that's art?
dialog: Well then you explain why.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: It goes back to prehistoric man.
dialog: They had comic strips on their
dialog: walls, for God's sake.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (whispering
dialog: in Michael's
dialog: ear)
dialog: I'm having a hard time. I'm
text: working on two at once.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (very interested)
dialog: Oh yeah, who?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: The brunette in the armchair in
dialog: the living room -- her name's
dialog: Rosalie...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: 9.
dialog: And the other one?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Clementine -- she's waiting for
dialog: me in the den.
text: He moves away towards the den.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (to Sophia)
dialog: Wait one second for me, I'll
dialog: be right back.
text: Michael walks off in the direction of Rosalie.
text: Paul is wandering among the guests, trying to find Jack,
text: he sees PETER who is talking with another young woman,
text: NICOLE. Peter is nodding, idly looking around, com-
text: pletely uninterested in the conversation.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: You guys have a beautiful place
dialog: here. But the rent must be a
dialog: killer.
text: Peter isn't paying attention.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Isn't it a killer?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What?...
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, the rent... yeah, it's high
dialog: but split between the three of
dialog: us it isn't that bad, as long
dialog: as we don't eat.
text: Nicole laughs.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hi Peter, I'm looking for Jack,
dialog: have you seen him?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh hi, Paul, how are you doing?
dialog: Yeah, sure, I'll take you to
dialog: Jack.
dialog: (to Nicole)
dialog: Excuse me for a minute.
text: They move away.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You're a lifesaver, I've been
dialog: trying to get away from that woman
dialog: 10.
dialog: for 20 minutes. That sonofabitch
dialog: Carl is moving in on my Natalie.
dialog: Gotta go... bye.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Wait -- What about Jack?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (in a hurry)
dialog: He's around somewhere. Check
text: under all the couches.
text: Paul walks off in Jack's direction. We STAY WITH Peter,
text: who reaches Natalie. She is talking with a very styl-
text: ishly-dressed, tall, young man, CARL.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh Natalie, I've been looking
dialog: for you all night.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: All night? I just saw you deep
dialog: in conversation with Nicole!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Deep? Hell no, we were just
text: talking shop.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Oh come on Peter, we all know
dialog: what a ladies' man you are.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Who, me? Jack's the ladies' man,
dialog: not me. You're the only lady I'm
dialog: after.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: So tell me, how's your project
dialog: coming along? I heard you're not
dialog: ready yet.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We've still got two weeks left
dialog: before the semi-finals. We'll
dialog: be ready.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: We've been ready for three days
dialog: now. We're gonna kick your ass.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Their project is really incredible.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh really? You've seen it?
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: (smiling broadly
dialog: at Carl)
dialog: No, it's top secret but he's been
dialog: telling me about it...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (in a bad mood)
dialog: Ours is incredible too.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: If you ever get it finished.
text: Paul comes up to Jack, who is kneeling before Clementine,
text: whispering passionate sweet nothings in her ear. It
dialog: appears he's gotten beyond the "This is love at first
text: sight" stage. He's getting down to the nitty-gritty
text: now. Clementine is thrilled. Paul taps Jack on the
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Jack, can I talk to you for a
dialog: second?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, hi, Paul, yeah sure...
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Clementine)
dialog: ... Please darling, don't move...
dialog: I'll be right back, okay? I'll
dialog: bring us back some champagne...
text: He disappears with Paul.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're a lifesaver, Paul. I
dialog: thought I'd never get away.
dialog: Rosalie's waiting for me in the
dialog: living room. Isn't she
dialog: terrific?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Who? Rosalie?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Clementine.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh yeah, for sure, I dunno.
dialog: Listen, can you do me a favor?
text: With some difficulty, Paul follows Jack as he picks his
text: way through the people dancing, heading in Rosalie's
dialog: direction.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah... What kind of favor?
dialog: Damn, I've got to get her
text: a glass of champagne.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Listen, I've got a little problem.
dialog: I'm having a valuable package
dialog: delivered to me on Sunday, but I'm
dialog: not going to be home. I've got to
dialog: do the Hawaii-Tahiti-Australia
dialog: route, so can I have the package
dialog: delivered here instead?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (filling a glass
dialog: with champagne)
dialog: Yeah, sure, of course.
dialog: (he stops,
dialog: thinking)
dialog: No, wait, I'm leaving for South
dialog: America tomorrow. I'll be gone
dialog: for three weeks.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: But it's okay. Peter and Michael
dialog: will be here. They'll take care
dialog: of it.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Will you be sure to tell them
dialog: about it?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Absolutely. Don't worry about
dialog: a thing.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It'll be delivered Sunday and
dialog: picked up next Thursday, okay?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Delivered Sunday picked up
dialog: Thursday. Got it. No problem.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: This is a very delicate matter,
dialog: Jack. It's very important they
dialog: don't tell anybody about this
dialog: package. It could be very... uh,
dialog: embarrassing for me, you know
dialog: what I'm saying?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sure. You got it. I'll see you
dialog: later...
dialog: 13.
text: Jack is about to rejoin Rosalie. Paul grabs his arm.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Not to anyone at all. Tell
dialog: them that, okay?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay, sure, not to anyone at
dialog: all... Look, I'm sorry Paul, but
dialog: I gotta get back to Rosalie. Now
dialog: go have a good time. I'll take
dialog: care of everything.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Bye and thanks a lot.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't mention it.
text: Paul leaves.
text: Jack finally reaches the armchair where Rosalie is
text: sitting. He stops short, obviously disappointed.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Uh-oh. Too late.
text: Michael is sitting next to Rosalie, right next to her.
text: They get up to dance. As he passes Jack, Michael
text: smiles broadly.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: All's fair, old buddy...
text: Jack watches a moment, then breaks into a wide smile.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Oh my darling, oh my darling,
dialog: oh my darling Clementine.
text: Jack whirls around and heads back towards Clementine.
scene_heading: 4 INT. APARTMENT - FEW HOURS LATER - NIGHT 4
text: The guests are leaving. Commotion in the hall, people
text: are saying goodbye to Peter and Michael.
text: Natalie is about to walk out.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Natalie, why don't you stay for a
dialog: nightcap?
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: No, I've gotta get up early...
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (to Natalie)
dialog: Do you care to share a cab?
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Oh yes, thanks -- that's really
dialog: nice of you...
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (smiling
text: triumphantly;
dialog: to Peter)
dialog: Good night, Peter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (with a forced
dialog: smile)
dialog: Good night, Carl... I'll call
dialog: you Sunday, Natalie.
text: She has already left. The door closes on the last of the
text: departing guests.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: So you struck out again with
dialog: Natalie, huh? That Carl is a
dialog: real smooth operator.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He's an asshole!
dialog: (mimicking Carl)
dialog: 'I heard you're not ready yet.'
dialog: 'We're gonna kick your ass.' Well,
dialog: we may be behind schedule, but
dialog: we're still going to beat that
dialog: sonofabitch and maybe I haven't
dialog: scored with Natalie yet, but
dialog: neither has he. She's not an easy
dialog: lay, that's what I like about her.
dialog: You know what they say: it ain't
text: over till it's over.
text: Peter and Michael go into the living room. Peter is
text: picking up glasses. Michael is emptying ashtrays into
text: the wastebasket.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, I didn't do so well either
dialog: -- I blew it with Rosalie. I
dialog: don't even know how...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Who's Rosalie?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: That beauty I managed to swipe
dialog: 15.
dialog: from Jack. I was about to ask
dialog: her to stay the night when...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Your old friend Sophia appeared
dialog: and got you involved in a thrilling
dialog: conversation about modern art,
dialog: and meanwhile Rosalie...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: How could you know that?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Michael, all you want to do is
dialog: steal Jack's girl friends. You
dialog: don't give a shit about the women
dialog: themselves...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: That's not true. It's just that
dialog: Sophia drives me crazy. She knows
dialog: all the right buttons to push to
dialog: make me mad.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (going into the
dialog: kitchen)
dialog: Anyway, it was a great party,
dialog: everyone had a good time...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (still in the living
text: room, shouting to
dialog: Peter)
dialog: Terrific... time.
text: He, too, leaves the living room and runs into Jack, who
text: has his arm around Clementine's waist as he heads toward
text: his bedroom with her.
scene_heading: 5 INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT 5
text: In the kitchen Peter is straightening up. Michael joins
text: him, dumping the ashes. Peter begins washing the glasses.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Where's Jack? Did he leave?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: No, he's cuddling up with a blonde
dialog: named Clementine...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That's not Clementine. I saw him
text: doing his famous routine with
dialog: Christie...
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No, it is Clementine, the one with
dialog: the tits this big...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Christie's got tits that big,
dialog: too...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah, but he was with Christie at
dialog: the beginning of the evening --
dialog: after that he was with Rosalie
dialog: and then with Clementine. And
dialog: since I stole Rosalie away from
dialog: him... Are you following this?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'm not.
text: Jack enters the kitchen in very high spirits, singing.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nice work if you can get it, and
dialog: you can get it if you try... Any
dialog: scotch left?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, here, I just put it away.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sorry I can't give you guys a
dialog: hand, but I've got something
dialog: cooking.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I thought you were leaving at
dialog: dawn for South America?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I am, the night's still young!...
dialog: It's gonna be a lively one. I'm
dialog: gonna make us a little snack.
text: He makes up a tray with sandwiches.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: So, who is it anyway -- Christie
dialog: or Clementine?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Maxine. Beautiful, enchanting
dialog: Maxine.
text: Peter and Michael look at one another surprised, mouthing
dialog: silently, "Maxine?"
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey, Michael -- how'd it go with
dialog: Rosalie?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, things were going great
dialog: until...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Your old friend Sophia appeared
dialog: and dragged you into a thrilling
dialog: conversation about modern art and
text: in the meantime Rosalie took off
text: with someone else.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: How did you know?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I dunno -- lucky guess...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, I don't give a damn anyway,
dialog: I have 24 drawings to hand in to
dialog: my editor three days from now and
dialog: I gotta work all night anyway...
dialog: So it was all for the best. But
dialog: you better not leave that Maxine's
dialog: phone number lying around because
dialog: when I'm done...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't worry, I'll leave you her
text: phone number on the hall table.
dialog: If she's really terrific I'll put
dialog: a big 'X' next to it. 'Bye, guys
dialog: -- love ya. I won't wake you
dialog: tomorrow morning. See you in
dialog: three weeks...
scene_heading: 6 INT. APARTMENT - DAWN 6
text: Jack and Maxine noiselessly exit the apartment. Jack is
text: wearing his pilot's uniform. Maxine pushes the button
text: for the elevator. Jack sneaks back into the apartment
text: and leaves a note on the hall table that says: "Maxine
text: 227-2013." Next to the number Jack has put a big "X."
scene_heading: 7 EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF APARTMENT - DAWN 7

scene_heading: 8 EXT./INT. NEWARK AIRPORT - PLANE 8
dialog: 18.
text: Jack is in the cockpit with his copilot, RON. The
text: ENGINES are REVVING. Jack is checking gauges. He looks
text: out the window idly and sees:
text: The crew of another plane walking across the tarmac.
text: Paul is one of the crew. Paul sees Jack and begins to
text: gesture wildly, but his voice is drowned out by the noise
text: of the ENGINES.
text: Just seeing Paul is enough to remind Jack about his
dialog: package.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Damn! I forgot to tell them about
dialog: the package!
dialog: (to Ron)
dialog: I gotta make a quick phone call.
dialog: I'll be right back.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: (knowingly)
dialog: Jack, there'll be plenty of girls
dialog: where we're going.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, c'mon, I've really got to
dialog: make a phone call! What do you
dialog: think I'm going to do, pick up
dialog: one of the New Jersey delegates
dialog: to the I.B.M. convention?
text: Jack walks back towards the phone. As he walks we see
text: that the plane is filled with ugly, boring businessmen.
scene_heading: 9 INT. ARCHITECTURE OFFICE - DAY 9
dialog: In the architecture firm of which Peter is one of three
text: partners. The whole staff, about 15 people in all, is
text: gathered around a large model, the project for a big

text: JERRY, one of Peter's partners, seems particularly angry.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: The model's not finished, the
dialog: blueprints are a mess and you may
dialog: as well forget the specs, they're
dialog: a disaster! I know we're talented.
dialog: I know we're good. Then why is it
dialog: we can never get organized? Why
dialog: is it we're always behind schedule?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Look, Jerry, architects since
dialog: Leonardo have always been behind
dialog: schedule. It's a tradition, for
dialog: 19.
dialog: God's sake. Why break with
dialog: tradition?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Because this is the chance of a
dialog: lifetime for our company, and
text: there happens to be a deadline.
dialog: There are millions of dollars
dialog: at stake here. And our main
dialog: competition had their project in
dialog: three days ago!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, but word around town is
dialog: their project's a piece of
dialog: shit!
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Of course, it's a piece of shit,
dialog: but it's a ready piece of shit.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: We're just going to have to buckle
dialog: down, that's all.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: You're damn right we are. Starting
dialog: now, everybody works around the
dialog: clock! Everybody! We have two
dialog: weeks to be ready for the semi-
dialog: final selection. And we will be
dialog: ready. And we will win. You want
dialog: to know why we'll win?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Because we're gonna cheat.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'll go bribe the judges!
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I don't think this is a joking
dialog: matter, gentlemen.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Come on, Jerry...
text: A SECRETARY enters.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: There's an urgent call for you,
dialog: Peter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'm not in.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: It's Jack -- he says it's 'super
dialog: important...'
text: Peter picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hi... yeah... listen, make it
dialog: quick, I'm in a meeting here...
dialog: yeah, a package... okay...
dialog: someone'll drop it off Sunday
dialog: and pick it up Thursday...
dialog: No problem ... yeah... we'll
dialog: put it aside, okay... no, no,
dialog: we won't tell anybody about it...
dialog: Is that it?... Right, we won't
dialog: tell anyone... Hey -- love 'n'
dialog: kisses to the Brazilian girls,
dialog: vaya con dios, old buddy.
text: Peter hangs up, laughing. Jerry gives him a dirty look.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What?
scene_heading: 10 INT. APARTMENT - DAY 10
text: Peter, dressed in casual clothes, knocks on the door of
text: Michael's room, and peeks in.
text: Michael is asleep fully clothed on his bed. His drawing
text: table is strewn with papers, overflowing ashtrays and
text: empty coffee cups. The lamp is still on.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'm going out for bagels -- how
dialog: many you want, three or four?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (opening one eye)
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: PETER
text: Eleven-thirty.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: A.M. or P.M.?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: A.M. C'mon, up 'n' at 'em.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Up 'n' at 'em yourself, asshole
dialog: -- I just went to bed.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: 21.
dialog: Did you finish?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Nah, I didn't get anywhere.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well then... nap time's over.
dialog: Back to work. So how many bagels,
dialog: three or four?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Six, six!
text: He buries his head under the pillow.
scene_heading: 11 INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY 11
text: Peter opens the front door, he stumbles over an object,
text: looks down; at his feet he sees a wicker basket lined
text: with pretty pink-and-white checked gingham. In the
text: basket a tiny baby lies fast asleep, her head gently
text: resting on a lace pillow. Peter looks at this object
text: in amazement. There is an envelope pinned to the basket
text: with the words, "FOR JACK" written on it. Peter picks up
text: the letter -- he opens it and reads.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: You gotta be kidding!
text: Abruptly he turns and races back to Michael's room.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Michael! Michael!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (still groggy)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Get your ass out here and see
text: what's on the doorstep.
dialog: (mutters)
dialog: This has gotta be somebody's idea
dialog: of a joke!
text: They run to the front door.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Look for yourself.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: It's a basket with a baby in it.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No shit.
dialog: (reads Michael the
dialog: letter)
dialog: 'Dearest Jack, here is the fruit
dialog: of our love. Take good care of
dialog: her. I have to go to Europe and
dialog: Japan for six months, her name is
dialog: Mary. Good luck, Love, Sylvia.'
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What are we going to do with it?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Give it back to her mother, that's
dialog: what.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: But it says she went to Europe.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, we'll see about that, d'you
dialog: have her phone number?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Whose phone number?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: The girl's... Sylvia's...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Why the hell would I have her
dialog: number? I've never even heard
dialog: of this chick!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You mean you don't know who she
dialog: is?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No way. If I had to keep track
dialog: of all Jack's girlfriends, I'd
dialog: have to be a full-time secretary.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, what are we gonna do?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hey, look, she's waking up...
dialog: Hey, look, she's crying...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh no, this can't be happening!
dialog: She's not gonna start to cry now?!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: 23.
dialog: Uh-oh, now she's really crying!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What's her problem?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Maybe she's hungry?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, what are we s'posed to do?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Feed her, I guess...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, but what?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Soft stuff... I guess.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: Oh no, I swear to God this is
dialog: unreal! Can you believe that
dialog: bastard Jack?! 'A little package,'
dialog: he tells me on the phone, 'just
dialog: put it aside till Thursday.' Put
dialog: it aside -- can you believe him!?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Really? Jack said that?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah and he also said 'don't tell
dialog: anyone about it -- anyone at all.'
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh, so he told you about this?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, he told me a package would
dialog: be coming today, but he didn't
dialog: say it'd be this!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (very angrily)
dialog: Boy, he's got a helluva nerve!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Just listen to the racket she's
dialog: making! What are we s'posed to
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (brilliant idea)
dialog: Let's call Jack's mother!
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: She lives in Miami for Christsake.
text: She can't stop the baby crying
dialog: from Miami.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, just to ask her advice...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, he said not to tell anyone...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: But this is an emergency!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No! No way! You know what a pain
dialog: that woman is -- she'll be on the
dialog: next plane here to move in with
dialog: us...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Maybe I should call my mother...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, please -- leave the mothers
dialog: out of this, okay?! It's only
dialog: four days. We should be able to
dialog: handle that, besides you know
dialog: the rule around here: it's fine
dialog: to have a woman over once in a
dialog: while, but...
text: Michael finishes the sentence in unison with him.
scene_heading: PETER AND MICHAEL
dialog: ... never for more than one night
dialog: at a time!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And that includes mothers!
text: Peter steps over the basket and heads towards the
dialog: elevator.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Where are you going?!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'm going to the store to buy
dialog: some baby food.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What am I supposed to do while
dialog: you're gone?
speaker_heading: PETER
text: Pick her up and hold her.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (panic-stricken)
dialog: Whaddya mean, pick her up? I've
dialog: never held a baby -- I'll drop
dialog: her!
text: Peter is already gone.
scene_heading: 12 INT. SAFEWAY - DAY 12
text: Peter enters the store and rushes right over to a store
speaker_heading: CLERK.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What aisle's baby food on?
speaker_heading: CLERK
text: Down there by the meat section.
text: Peter heads for it purposefully. When he gets to the
text: right aisle, he stops short, taken aback: a vast range
text: of products extends before him. He starts examining the
text: baby food jars and cans of formulas, going from one to
text: the next, not knowing where to begin.
scene_heading: 13 INT. APARTMENT - DAY 13
text: Michael is still in the hall holding Mary very clumsily
text: in his arms. He is anxious. He realizes she's soaked.
text: This disgusts him. He holds her at arm's length; she
text: squirms. He goes and gets a towel from the bathroom,
text: spreads it out on the living room couch and lays the
text: baby down on it. MARY SCREAMS -- she much prefers
text: Michael's arms to the couch. A panicky Michael picks her
text: up again, grumbling.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Okay, okay, don't cry like that...
dialog: I'll hold you, I'll hold you.
text: He tries rather unsuccessfully to wrap the towel around
text: the child. Obviously Michael is very put off by the
text: smell coming from Mary.
scene_heading: 14 INT. SAFEWAY - DAY 14
text: Peter is talking with a Safeway CLERK, a woman in her
text: 50's, who is tall and heavy, somewhat gruff and masculine
text: in appearance, and wearing slacks and a smock.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: So what's the best brand?
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: STORE CLERK
dialog: Depends on what your pediatrician
dialog: recommends.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh right, the pediatrician...
dialog: But which one sells the most?
speaker_heading: STORE CLERK
dialog: (pointing to a
dialog: can)
dialog: This kind.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, so this is the best kind?
speaker_heading: STORE CLERK
dialog: It's the cheapest.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Then it's the worst kind?
speaker_heading: STORE CLERK
dialog: They're all good, sir.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (pointing to another
dialog: can)
dialog: Oh, okay, then I can take this
dialog: kind.
speaker_heading: STORE CLERK
dialog: It's got iron in it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh. Is that good or bad?
speaker_heading: STORE CLERK
dialog: It's very good.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, why don't they all have
dialog: iron in them?
speaker_heading: STORE CLERK
dialog: Some babies are allergic to iron.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (pointing to yet
dialog: another can)
dialog: Oh, okay, well I'll take this
dialog: kind then.
speaker_heading: STORE CLERK
dialog: That kind doesn't have any milk
dialog: in it.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, I see, there's milk with no
dialog: milk in it?
speaker_heading: STORE CLERK
dialog: Some babies are allergic to milk.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: So what's the stuff that no
dialog: babies are allergic to?
speaker_heading: STORE CLERK
dialog: Soy formula.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, okay, I'll take the soy formula.
text: He takes a can.
speaker_heading: STORE CLERK
dialog: That one's Advance.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh really? What's Advance?
speaker_heading: STORE CLERK
dialog: How old's your baby?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (Peter tries to
dialog: estimate Mary's
dialog: size)
dialog: Uh... about this old.
scene_heading: 15 INT. APARTMENT - DAY 15
text: MARY is SCREAMING in Michael's arms as he walks her up
dialog: and down the whole apartment. Now there are three towels
text: wrapped around her. Michael is exasperated. He angrily
text: sings her a lullaby.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Rock-a-bye baby on the tree top...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop crying now; c'mon, stop...
dialog: quit it, will you?... When the wind
dialog: blows, the cradle will rock...
dialog: What is that jerk doing? Milking
dialog: the cows or something?... When
text: the bough breaks the cradle will
dialog: fall...
text: MARY only SCREAMS LOUDER.
dialog: 28.
scene_heading: 16 INT. SAFEWAY - DAY 16
text: Now Peter is surrounded by three women arguing: The
text: Store Clerk standing with her arms crossed and haughtily
text: looking down on everyone; an efficient, practical sort
text: of young woman (WOMAN #1); and another thin, pale woman
text: whose baby is lying in a baby carrier in her shopping
text: cart and who seems very nervous (WOMAN #2).
speaker_heading: WOMAN #1
dialog: Does she have any teeth yet or
dialog: not? That would give us a clue
dialog: as to how old she is.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I haven't looked.
speaker_heading: STORE CLERK
dialog: (coolly disagree-
dialog: ing; to Woman #1)
dialog: My grandson's only five months old
text: and he already has two teeth.
dialog: But my daughter didn't have a
dialog: single one at seven months -- so,
dialog: y'know, how many teeth they have...
dialog: doesn't mean a thing.
speaker_heading: WOMAN #2
dialog: But didn't those friends of yours
dialog: tell you what formula they usually
dialog: give the baby?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: No, actually they had to leave
dialog: unexpectedly. They had to catch
dialog: a plane...
speaker_heading: WOMAN #1
dialog: (to Peter)
dialog: Is she teething?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Teething?
speaker_heading: WOMAN #1
dialog: Does she drool? Does she cry all
dialog: night long? Does she chew on her
dialog: fists? Does she put everything
dialog: into her mouth?
text: She acts out her words.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I know she can't talk.
speaker_heading: WOMAN #2
dialog: 29.
dialog: But didn't those friends of
dialog: yours tell you how old she was?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (as Woman #2 is
dialog: starting to get on
dialog: his nerves)
dialog: I told you they had to leave
text: unexpectedly.
speaker_heading: WOMAN #1
dialog: Or else you could weigh her; that
dialog: would tell you how old she is.
speaker_heading: STORE CLERK
dialog: See, my five-month-old grandson
dialog: weighs more than my neighbor's
text: grandson and he's nine months old.
dialog: So, y'know, how much they weigh...
dialog: doesn't mean a thing.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: So what about me? What should I
dialog: buy?
speaker_heading: WOMAN #2
dialog: Didn't they even tell you the
dialog: pediatrician's name?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (still calm)
dialog: No. They didn't.
speaker_heading: WOMAN #2
dialog: You sure have weird friends.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You have no idea how weird.
speaker_heading: WOMAN #1
dialog: Or else her hair. Does she have
dialog: lots of hair?
speaker_heading: STORE CLERK
dialog: My grandson, y'know, he has so
dialog: much hair you can make a ponytail
dialog: with it! And I know some kids
dialog: who are totally bald at a year-
dialog: and-a-half. So, y'know, how much
dialog: hair they have... doesn't mean a
dialog: thing...
speaker_heading: WOMAN #1
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Gee, he's really something, your
dialog: grandson -- is he good at math
dialog: too?
dialog: 30.
text: Peter starts to pick cans off the shelf.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Look, ladies, thanks for all the
dialog: advice. But I think I'll just
dialog: take one of each. To be on the
dialog: safe side.
speaker_heading: STOCK CLERK
dialog: (to Peter)
dialog: Don't forget -- if the baby's
dialog: less than three months old, you
dialog: have to be sure to sterilize the
dialog: bottles.
text: Peter stops and turns back.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What bottles?
speaker_heading: WOMAN #2
dialog: You know what? This must be a
dialog: kidnapping.
scene_heading: 17 INT. APARTMENT - DAY 17
text: Michael is rapidly pacing up and down the apartment,
text: vigorously rocking Mary. As soon as he sits down
text: anywhere to rest, MARY SCREAMS, so Michael pops back
text: up and begins the marathon all over again.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Mary had a little lamb, little
dialog: lamb, little lamb, if that jerk
dialog: isn't back in three seconds I
dialog: swear I'll throw her down the
dialog: garbage chute... Mary had a
dialog: little lamb, little lamb...
text: The DOORBELL RINGS.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, it's about goddamn time!
text: He hurries towards the door, grabs the knob and throws it
dialog: open.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Where the hell have you been?
text: He stops. Before him stands the apartment MANAGER, Mrs.
text: Razzolini, a squat little woman with a moustache.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh -- Hi, Mrs. Razzolini!
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: This package came for you...
dialog: Oh! What a cute little baby!
dialog: Is it yours?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No, it's not me, I mean she's
dialog: not mine...
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Oh, so it's Peter's?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No, no, it's Jack's, I mean it's
dialog: not Jack's, it's... someone loaned
dialog: it to us, I mean someone...
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: And what's the little girl's name?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Mary.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Ooh, what a pwetty wittle name,
dialog: Mary! I didn't know you had a
dialog: baby...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah, well, I have to put her to
dialog: bed now.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: You have to put her to bed? Where's
dialog: Mary's mommy?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: She's... she's not here. She'll
dialog: be back soon.
text: Michael starts to close the door. She pushes it back
text: open and holds out the package.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Oh here, this just came for you.
dialog: They just dropped it off. Can
dialog: I hold her for a second?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, like, y'see... she doesn't
dialog: like to be held by strangers...
dialog: The apartment Manager has already given Michael the
text: package and grabbed Mary. She covers her with kisses.
text: Mary smiles. Michael absent-mindedly looks at the
dialog: package.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: She loves to be held by strangers!
dialog: Hey, she's soaking wet hmm, no
dialog: I think it's number 2. Want me
dialog: to give you a hand changing her?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh no, don't worry, I'm used
dialog: to it.
dialog: (faking a smile)
dialog: Well, so long, Mrs. Razzolini.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: 'Bye, Mary, I'll come back to
dialog: visit.
text: Mrs. Razzolini regretfully hands the baby back. No
text: sooner is MARY back in Michael's arms than she SCREAMS
text: her head off.
text: He closes the door; his smile instantly fades.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What a leech! And that other
dialog: idiot isn't back yet!
text: He throws the package onto an armchair in the hall.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: So you love to be held by
dialog: strangers, do you?
scene_heading: 18 INT. SAFEWAY - DAY 18
text: In the baby food aisle there are now five women arguing.
text: Peter, his arms still laden with cans, looks uncomfort-
dialog: able.
speaker_heading: WOMAN #2
dialog: This guy doesn't even know how old
dialog: his baby is and you don't find
dialog: that strange?
speaker_heading: WOMAN #1
dialog: This guy asked for advice, I'm
dialog: giving him advice, Okay? If you're
dialog: so paranoid, why don't you run
dialog: home and chain your kid to his
dialog: crib?
speaker_heading: WOMAN #2
dialog: Anyway, I think someone should call
dialog: the cops.
speaker_heading: WOMAN #1
dialog: 33.
dialog: The cops, the cops -- I bet you
dialog: call the cops every time your
text: cat pisses on the carpet.
text: Peter slips away.
scene_heading: 19 INT. APARTMENT - DAY 19
text: Peter comes in with bags in his arms.
text: Michael, holding the baby, dashes toward him, extremely
dialog: pissed off.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What the hell were you doing?
dialog: You've been gone for hours! This
dialog: damn kid's been crying the whole
dialog: time. I've got a lot better
dialog: things to do with my time! You're
dialog: a real pain in the ass!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (flabbergasted)
dialog: Hey, how dare you speak to me like
dialog: that! You've never spoken to me
dialog: like that before...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, what the hell took you so
dialog: long? What'd you do, go out for
dialog: breakfast or something? I didn't
dialog: even have time for a cup of
dialog: coffee, for chrissakes.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Will you please cut it out for a
dialog: second, huh? I didn't have any
dialog: coffee either, it took me forever
dialog: at the goddamn Safeway.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Okay, well, here -- take the kid,
dialog: I've got work to do.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Whaddaya mean, take the kid? I
dialog: can't hold her and make her bottle
dialog: at the same time. And why should
dialog: I be the one to hold her?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: 'Cause, it's your problem. You
dialog: found this kid.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hey, asshole, I'm the one who found
dialog: 34.
dialog: her because I'm the one who was
dialog: gonna get you some bagels for
dialog: your breakfast, and...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Jesus, there she goes again! We
dialog: gotta feed her something.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, well you just don't feed a
dialog: baby. First you gotta look and
dialog: see if she has any teeth or not.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: To figure out how old she is so
dialog: we know what to feed her, that's
dialog: why.
text: Peter attempts to look into Mary's mouth but she squirms.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Do you look on top or bottom?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: How do I know?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Try feeling with your finger.
text: Peter slides his finger over Mary's gums.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I can't feel anything -- I'll
dialog: give her the stuff for newborns
dialog: and hope she's not allergic to
dialog: it.
text: Peter starts off toward the kitchen, Michael follows.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And then we'll have to see if
dialog: she's allergic to iron, to soy
dialog: or to milk -- you can't imagine
dialog: how much stuff they can be
dialog: allergic to!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: She's soaking wet -- did you buy
dialog: any diapers?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Diapers?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: 35.
dialog: (furious)
dialog: Figures. I'll take care of
dialog: this, it'll save time.
text: He sticks Mary in Peter's arms, right on top of the bags,
text: and storms out.
scene_heading: 19A INT. SAFEWAY - DAY 19A
text: Michael rushes in and stops short in front of the moun-
text: tains of diaper boxes that he starts examining in bewil-
text: derment. Finally, he approaches the Store Clerk.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Excuse me, miss, could you tell
dialog: me which diapers are the most
dialog: absorbent?
speaker_heading: STORE CLERK
dialog: I would suggest the ones that say
dialog: 'ultra-absorbent.'
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah, but which are better: 20-35
dialog: pounds or 12-24 pounds?
speaker_heading: STORE CLERK
dialog: (suspiciously)
dialog: Depends how much your baby weighs.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh right, how much she weighs...
speaker_heading: STORE CLERK
dialog: (threateningly)
dialog: You wouldn't happen to have a
dialog: friend who came in here a little
dialog: while ago, would you?
text: Michael grabs just any box of diapers.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I have no idea what you're talking
dialog: about! He's no friend of mine.
text: Michael takes off very, very quickly.
scene_heading: 20 INT. KITCHEN - DAY 20
text: Mary, in Peter's arms, is devouring her bottle.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh shit, my slacks! Goddamn
dialog: her, she took a crap!
dialog: 36.
scene_heading: 21 INT. APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - DAY 21
text: Peter and Michael have laid Mary down on the couch,
text: taking care to place several towels between her bottom
text: and the immaculate velvet. Mary is squirming, laughing,
dialog: feeling great. They have already gone through half
text: a box of cotton in their attempts to clean up the
text: crap. But it's still all over, on their hands, on the
text: baby's feet and legs, on the towels, etc.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hold her. Hold her, goddamn it!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I can't hold her. This kid's
dialog: out of control here!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Just gimme the cotton.
text: Michael lets go of Mary's feet and she sticks them back
dialog: in the crap.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh for chrissake, don't just let
dialog: go of her!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Then get the cotton yourself
dialog: if you don't want me to let
dialog: go of her!
text: Peter grabs a huge wad of cotton.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Take the towels off -- They're
dialog: full of shit.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: But the couch'll get dirty!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, but she keeps getting it all
dialog: over herself. Man, this shit is
dialog: sticky!... We need cleaning fluid
dialog: or something to get it off...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: How 'bout after-shave?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Are you kidding?! Waste our Saint
dialog: Laurent on babyshit?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Okay, let's just put the diaper
dialog: 37.
dialog: on and the hell with it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Right.
text: Michael hands him a diaper. Peter tries to figure out
text: how it goes on.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: These tape things -- do they
dialog: go on the front or the back?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: How am I supposed to know...?
text: Peter tries to slide the diaper under Mary's backside
text: but she squirms and kicks it off with her feet.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hold her under her arms -- I'm
dialog: gonna try it this way.
text: Michael holds Mary under her armpits. Peter tries to put
dialog: the diaper on her. It's hard. What's more, it would
dialog: seem that Michael didn't buy the right size -- The
text: diaper comes all the way up to Mary's chin.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What the hell kind of lousy
dialog: stinking diapers did you get?
dialog: They're way too big!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I don't think they're too big --
dialog: They're ultra-absorbent. That's
dialog: all. The more absorbent the
dialog: better.
text: Peter has more or less managed to adjust the diaper.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: How the hell do these tape
dialog: things work? Hold her for
dialog: chrissakes!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: My arms are getting tired.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: There. I got it.
text: He tapes the diaper closed.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Damn it. I didn't make it tight
dialog: enough.
dialog: 38.
text: He tapes the other side: the diaper gapes and sags.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It's not working... What about
dialog: laying her down?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Go ahead... No, not on the towels,
dialog: they're all covered with crap...
text: Michael lays Mary down right on the couch. Peter vigor-
text: ously undoes the tape, and the whole PLASTIC lining RIPS
dialog: apart.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: ... What the hell is this friggin'
dialog: mess? Oh, man, this is
dialog: unbelievable! To think, they
dialog: bombard us day and night with
dialog: their goddamn TV commercials! And
dialog: will you look at this junk? This
dialog: stuff is pure shit -- You tape it
dialog: closed, it sags, you undo the tape:
dialog: bingo -- the whole goddamn thing
dialog: falls apart!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (taking another diaper)
dialog: Well, whaddya expect, if you pull
dialog: on it like an ape, it's gonna rip!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Michael, will you give me a break,
dialog: will you please?
text: Peter takes the torn diaper off. MARY utters a TINY CRY
text: and pees copiously all over the velvet couch.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: Oh shit! Now she's pissing. Look
text: at the couch. The sneaky little
dialog: bitch was just waiting for me to
dialog: get the diaper off, then whammo...
text: Mary gives them a big smile.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I happen to like my furniture.

scene_heading: 49 INT. APARTMENT - DAY 49

text: shampoo, etc. are all over the place. He drops all his
text: purchases on the floor, sits down on the couch and picks
text: up a book, in which he's instantly absorbed: we see from
text: the cover that it's a book on children.
scene_heading: 50 INT. PETER'S ROOM - DAY 50
text: Peter is lying on his bed now surrounded by dozens of

scene_heading: 53 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 53
text: Peter and Michael are asleep in their bathrobes on the

text: Mary looks at them and smiles.
scene_heading: 54 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 54
text: Michael is giving her night feeding. Mary is falling

scene_heading: 55 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 55

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

scene_heading: 56 EXT. STREET - DAY 56

dialog: 46.
text: They are being followed by the beige Chevy that pulls

text: The two men, who look like young tough guys (punks), get
text: off their motorcycle and disappear into the lobby of the
dialog: building.
text: Graton gets out of his car and heads for the building.
text: He glances into the lobby, then goes in. He watches the

text: then calmly returns to his car.
scene_heading: 57 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 57
text: Peter and Michael are still sitting on the living room
text: couches. The DOORBELL RINGS. Michael springs up and
text: runs to open the door. Peter follows him.
text: On the doorstep stand the TWO PUNKS. One of them is

text: other, tall, thin and creepy-looking, stands behind his

speaker_heading: PUNK #1
dialog: Jack Collins live here?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yes, he does.
speaker_heading: PUNK #1
dialog: We came for the package.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Package? Oh that's cute,

dialog: Anyway, you can tell Sylvia she's

speaker_heading: PUNK #1
dialog: Sylvia?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, Sylvia! You can tell her
dialog: she's got a hell of a nerve
dialog: dumping her problems into our
dialog: laps!
speaker_heading: PUNK #1
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Problems? Did you guys have
dialog: trouble?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: 47.
dialog: He wants to know if we had trouble!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Do you have any idea what it's
dialog: been like around here for the
dialog: past four days?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: She could have at least given us
dialog: a phone number or the name of
dialog: someone to contact...
speaker_heading: PUNK #1
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: I don't get it. Didn't they tell
dialog: you we were gonna be here today?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Sure they told us! So what?
dialog: That doesn't make the last four
dialog: days any less hellish than they
dialog: were!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, anyway, they're here now,
dialog: that's all that matters!

speaker_heading: PETER
text: The next bottle's in 45 minutes.

dialog: basket.
speaker_heading: PUNK #1
dialog: Bottle? Whadda ya mean, bottle?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: About an hour after her bottle,
text: she starts yawning. Put her to
dialog: bed right away or it's pure hell
dialog: for the next three hours, at least
dialog: that's what we've noticed.
text: Peter has returned with the basket. The Punks look at
text: the baby, their eyes wide with disbelief.
speaker_heading: PUNK #1
dialog: What the hell is that? A baby?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: No, it's a very short teenager.
dialog: Of course it's a baby! Now listen
dialog: carefully: I'm giving you a can
dialog: of the milk she's been getting.
dialog: She loves it, and more importantly,
dialog: 48.
dialog: she's not allergic to it. I even
dialog: put a can of the same brand in
dialog: here for you, but in powdered form,
dialog: understand?
text: Punk #1 hears "powder" and catches on.
speaker_heading: PUNK #1
dialog: Oh! I get it! Powdered milk!
dialog: Very clever!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, right... real clever...
dialog: Okay, here. She's all yours.
dialog: Good luck.
text: He hands them the basket. Punk #1 grabs the handles.
speaker_heading: PUNK #1
dialog: Okay, I got it. You can take her
text: out now.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Take what out? I'm not taking
dialog: anything out.
speaker_heading: PUNK #1
dialog: Wait a minute, I don't get it!
dialog: We take the basket and the milk,
dialog: that's all. We ain't gonna take
dialog: the... what's inside.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Whadda ya mean, what's inside?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You take it all, man! It's a
dialog: package deal!
speaker_heading: PUNK #1
dialog: But what are we s'posed to do
dialog: with it?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: How do I know? You take it
dialog: where they told you to take it.
speaker_heading: PUNK #1
dialog: Y'mean, I take it to the
dialog: connection?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah, whatever you want to call
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: PUNK #1
dialog: Are you sure that's the plan?
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You bet that's the plan! We're
text: not keeping her one more second.
speaker_heading: PUNK #1
dialog: Okay, if that's the plan...
text: He passes the basket to Punk #2
speaker_heading: PUNK #1
dialog: ... Here, hold this. Okay, so
dialog: long!
text: They start to leave, pressing the elevator button.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (suddenly a little
dialog: worried)
dialog: Uh... listen... maybe you could
dialog: leave us the address or the phone
dialog: number just in case. So we can
dialog: find out how she's doing?
text: The Punks exchange a puzzled glance.
speaker_heading: PUNK #1
dialog: Oh, yeah, sure, the address.
dialog: (feebly searching
dialog: his pockets)
dialog: Oh shit, I don't have it on me...
dialog: But I'll call you. Okay, so long!
scene_heading: PETER &amp; MICHAEL
dialog: So long!
text: The elevator has arrived. The Punks quickly slip inside
text: it with the basket.
text: Michael closes the door.
text: Peter plops down in the armchair by the front door.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Aah, relief at last! Good riddance!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You said it! Now maybe I can get
dialog: some work done.
text: He disappears in the direction of his room.
text: Peter is sitting on something hard. He pulls it out from
text: under him, it's a package. He looks at it, casually
text: reading: "Care of Jack Collins." He tosses it to the
text: side. Suddenly, it dawns on him. He leaps up, grabs
text: the package and runs into Michael's room.
dialog: 50.
scene_heading: 58 INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - DAY 58
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (holding the package)
dialog: What the hell is this?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, a package, I guess.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Was this package delivered to
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah, why?
text: Peter raises his voice, exasperated by Michael's calm
dialog: attitude.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: When the hell did this package
dialog: arrive?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Will you quit shouting!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (screaming even
dialog: louder)
dialog: When did this fucking package
dialog: fucking arrive, Michael?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I don't know... Oh yeah, Sunday --
dialog: Mrs. Razzolini brought it up...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Holy shit!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: This is the package those guys
dialog: came for, not the baby, you
dialog: asshole.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hey, asshole yourself!... Oh shit!
text: Peter nods and begins to bark orders.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Look out the window and see if
dialog: you see them, I'm gonna try to
dialog: 51.
dialog: catch up with them...
text: Michael runs to the window.
text: Peter runs like a madman through the apartment out the
text: front door. He presses the button for the elevator.
dialog: It's in use.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Goddamit!
text: He opens the door leading to the stairs and races down
text: them, holding on to the bannister. He flies, overwhelmed
text: by anxiety. Suddenly he trips, loses his balance and
text: makes a spectacular crash landing. The package gets a
text: bit crushed, and little individual packets of white powder
text: spill out of it. Peter stares at them in horror.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What the hell is this?
text: He picks up a few packets and examines them.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, God, no... dope! That's all
dialog: we need!
text: He starts to tremble with fear. He picks the packets up
text: as fast as he can and hastily puts them back into what's
text: left of the package; then shoves it all into his pocket
text: and continues racing down the stairs.
scene_heading: 59 EXT. STREET - DAY 59

speaker_heading: PUNK #2
dialog: Well we can't ride around

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (huffing and puffing)
dialog: Oh, thank God, you're still here!
dialog: There's been a terrible mistake.
dialog: That wasn't the package you

speaker_heading: PUNK #1
dialog: What do you mean? What other

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'll take the basket back and

dialog: No mistake.

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: But I'm tellin you it was a

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: PUNK #2
dialog: (to Punk #1)
dialog: Watch it, the cops!

speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: (to his partner)
dialog: Terrific! I bet these morons
dialog: screw up everything.
text: One of the COPS gets out of his car and comes over to the
text: Punks and Peter. Peter is scared stiff.
speaker_heading: PUNK #1
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: If you called the cops on us,
dialog: pal, you're a dead man.
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: All right, what's that doing on
dialog: the back of the bike?
text: No one answers.
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: You wouldn't by any chance be
text: intending to drive with a baby
dialog: basket on your motorcycle, would
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: PUNK #1
dialog: Of course not, Officer. We'd
dialog: never do something like that.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: So why did you strap it on in
dialog: the first place if you had no
dialog: intention of driving with it?
speaker_heading: PUNK #2
dialog: So it wouldn't fall off.
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: Very funny.
text: As he speaks, Peter undoes the bungie cord from around
text: the basket and takes it off the motorcycle.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, really, Officer, they weren't
dialog: gonna drive off with it -- They
dialog: were just watching it for me while
dialog: I was doing a quick errand.
dialog: (to the Punks)
dialog: Thanks, guys.
text: Punk #1 gives him a dirty look.
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: All right, let's see some
dialog: identification, everybody.
text: The punks exchange a glance. Suddenly Punk #1 shouts:
speaker_heading: PUNK #1
dialog: Go!
text: They take off running in different directions. Cop #1
text: charges after Punk #1 and yells to his partner who's
text: still in the car:
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: Watch the guy with the basket!
text: Cop #2 leaps out of the car, gun in hand.
text: Peter stiffens with fear.
speaker_heading: COP #2
dialog: Freeze! All right, asshole, let's
dialog: see some I.D.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (urbanely)
dialog: Listen, Officer, let's stay calm
dialog: now. I haven't the slightest
dialog: intention of running. I am not
dialog: a criminal. I'm an architect.
speaker_heading: COP #2
dialog: (calming down
dialog: 55.
dialog: a little)
dialog: Your I.D., let's see it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'm terribly sorry, Officer, but
dialog: I don't have any identification
dialog: on me. I just came down with my
dialog: baby to run a quick errand. I
dialog: haven't committed any crime.
speaker_heading: COP #2
dialog: All right, let's go, in the car.
dialog: I'm taking you down to the
dialog: station.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, c'mon, that's impossible --
dialog: you see I have a baby. I have
dialog: to give her a bottle in fifteen
dialog: minutes, I can't go anywhere.
dialog: I live right in this building --
dialog: let me go up to my apartment
dialog: and I'll get you my license
dialog: immediately... You can even
dialog: come with me if you like...
speaker_heading: COP #2
dialog: All right, lead the way.
text: They disappear inside the building. Peter is carrying
text: the basket in his left hand; his right hand is clenched
text: on the horrible package hidden in his pocket.
text: Just then Cop #1 comes running back, empty-handed.
text: Graton gets out of his car and comes up to Cop #1, show-
text: ing him his badge.
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Inspector Graton, Narcotics. It
dialog: just so happens I was tailing
dialog: those two guys and now because
dialog: of you clowns I lost them,
dialog: probably forever. Thanks a lot!
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: How could we know?
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: Forget it. Listen, your partner
dialog: went in here with the guy and the
text: baby. He lives up on the tenth
dialog: floor. I can't go in because if
dialog: he sees me, my cover is blown. So
dialog: could you please try not to lose
dialog: this one, okay? He's someone who's
dialog: 56.
dialog: gotta be watched very closely.
dialog: I've called for backup and it's on
dialog: its way.
scene_heading: 60 INT. APARTMENT - DAY 60
text: The elevator doors open, Peter and Cop #2 exit.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (key in hand)
dialog: This is it. Please come in...
dialog: can I get you a cup of coffee or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: COP #2
dialog: No thanks. I'll just wait out
dialog: here.
text: Peter enters the apartment and calmly crosses through
text: the house, carrying the basket.
text: As soon as he's out of the cop's sight, he starts running
text: like a madman down the corridor. He runs into Michael
text: who was just coming to meet him.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hey, what's happening? What
dialog: were those cops doing...
text: Peter shuts him up, grabs him roughly under the arm and
text: leads him into his room, closing the door behind them.
text: Peter speaks softly but he's totally freaking out, he
dialog: can hardly breathe.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Michael... Michael... we're in
dialog: deep trouble. The package...
dialog: The package...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah? What?
speaker_heading: PETER
text: There's a cop on the doorstep...
dialog: He didn't see you... He mustn't
dialog: see you... We're in deep
dialog: trouble, Michael...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Tell me what...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: The package they came for wasn't
dialog: the baby, it was dope, drugs, a
dialog: shitload of dope! We were stopped
text: by some cops down on the street.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: But did the cops see the dope?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, it's right here.
text: He takes out the package.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Shit!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We'll get twenty years if the
dialog: cops find this on us! Climb down
dialog: the fire escape and hide it...
dialog: anywhere!
text: Michael takes the package, opens the window and starts to
text: climb out it when Peter stops him.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hey, whatever you do, don't lose
dialog: the goddamn dope, we gotta be
dialog: able to return it to those dealers
dialog: or we're dead. Those guys are
dialog: serious.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Don't worry.
text: He starts down the fire escape, then stops and turns back.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh, by the way, I put some water
text: up to boil for her bottle.
text: Michael disappears. Peter picks up Mary, grabs his wal-
text: let and leaves the room. When he gets to the hall, he
text: discovers that Cop #1 has joined Cop #2, to whom he is
text: whispering something. Peter holds his license out for
dialog: them to see.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Here's my license.
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: I'm afraid I'm going to have to
dialog: ask you to remain in the apartment.
dialog: The narcotics squad will be
text: arriving any moment now. They
dialog: want to ask you a few questions.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Narcotics squad? What do they
dialog: want with me? I don't even use
dialog: aspirin!
dialog: 58.
scene_heading: 61 INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY 61
text: Michael is buying a pair of scissors, glue and a roll of
text: Scotch tape. Then he buys a box of large diapers -- he
text: chooses the ones that come in a box. Michael leaves the
text: supermarket, whistling.
scene_heading: 62 EXT. PARK - DAY 62
text: Michael is sitting on a bench facing the grass, with
text: his back to us, he seems quite busy.
text: As we CLOSE IN, we discover that he has opened the box of
text: diapers and that he's holding one of them; its plastic
text: has been carefully cut out with scissors.
text: Casually, glancing right and left, he takes the individ-
text: ual packets of white powder out of his pocket and shoves
text: them into a little plastic bag from the supermarket.
text: Then he carefully tapes the bag so it's well-sealed and
text: flattened out, and he inserts it into the diaper, be-
text: tween the plastic and the absorbent fabric.
text: Next, the diaper is taped up, folded back up and put
text: back in the box, neatly packed between the other ones.
text: Michael closes the box again and glues it together so
text: it looks as if it's never been opened. He throws all
text: the other stuff away in a trash can and grabs hold of
text: his brand-new box of diapers. He walks away.
scene_heading: 63 INT. APARTMENT - DAY 63
text: Michael comes into the living room with his box of
text: diapers and a bag of groceries.
text: In addition to the two cops there are now THREE NARCOTIC
text: AGENTS who are interrogating Peter. He is holding Mary.
text: The basket is on an armchair.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hello, Officers... What's going
dialog: on?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Don't worry, Michael, it's
dialog: nothing serious, just a little
dialog: misunderstanding.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Did you give her the 5:30 bottle?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, I just gave it to her.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Did you change her?
speaker_heading: PETER
text: No, she's soaking wet.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Okay, I'll do it.
text: Michael puts down his bag of groceries, takes Mary from
text: Peter and disappears with the box of diapers.
text: In his room, he lays Mary down on his bed and starts
text: undressing her.
scene_heading: 64 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 64
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: And who's he?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He's my roommate.
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: (raising an eyebrow)
dialog: Oh, I see, I see...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, you don't see. There are
dialog: three of us sharing this place.
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: Oh, three, huh? A regular 'mirage
dialog: a trois'!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It's 'menage'... and it's not.
dialog: We all have lots of girlfriends,
dialog: thank you.
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: Uh-huh, so what's your friend do?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He's a cartoonist.
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: What about the other guy?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He's a pilot.
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: Ah-hah... Now that's interesting...
dialog: (to his colleague)
dialog: 60.
dialog: ... Get me those photographs,
dialog: the ones taken at Newark Airport.
text: Agent #1 looks in his attache case.
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: So does this friend of yours ever
dialog: fly to South America?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No. Never. Only North America.
text: The PHONE RINGS.
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: Would you object if I answered it
dialog: for you?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Not at all, go right ahead. I've
dialog: got nothing to hide.
text: Agent #1 picks up the phone and listens.
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: It's a collect call from a Jack
dialog: Collins in La Paz, Bolivia. That
dialog: wouldn't happen to be your pilot
dialog: friend, would it? The one who
dialog: never goes to South America?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes, it is him.
text: Agent #1 hands him the phone.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hello, yes, operator, I accept the
dialog: charges.
text: Agent #1 gestures to Agent #3 to take a look around the
text: apartment. Agent #3 slips away.
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: Would you mind very much if I
dialog: listened?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Please, go right ahead.
text: Agent #1 picks up the other telephone.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hello, Jack? Fine, yeah. How're
dialog: you? Yeah, he's fine, too.
dialog: Yeah, we left a message for you,
dialog: right... No, it was nothing
dialog: 61.
dialog: special, it was just, I mean...
dialog: to see how you were doing and all
dialog: ... No, no emergency. Everything's
dialog: fine.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: (loud)
dialog: I said everything's fine! The
dialog: what?... I don't know what you're
dialog: talking about... Oh yeah, the
dialog: package! Yeah, yeah, it got here
dialog: ... and was picked up, uh-huh.
dialog: Hey! Why didn't you call sooner?
dialog: Huh? 'Cause what?... Oh, you're
dialog: onto something hot -- well, aren't
dialog: you the lucky one!... So when are
dialog: you getting married?... Forget it,
dialog: I was just kidding... Well,
dialog: everything's fine up here. So
dialog: have a good time. See you in a
dialog: couple of weeks. 'Bye.
text: Peter hangs up. So does Agent #1.
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: Now that's interesting. So you
dialog: wanna tell me about this package
dialog: and the hot something-or-other
dialog: your friend lucked onto... in
dialog: La Paz... Bolivia... South America?
text: Peter sits down, stunned.
scene_heading: 65 INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - DAY 65
text: Mary is lying on Michael's bed. He has just finished
text: putting a regular diaper on her.
text: Then Michael looks for the tampered-with diaper in the
text: box. He finds it, checks that it is well-sealed, and
text: places it under Mary's bottom.
text: Just then Agent #3 appears in the doorway. Michael
text: calmly finishes putting the dope-filled diaper on the
text: baby on top of the other one. MARY is COOING. Every-
text: thing appears normal. However, a trained eye might be
text: very surprised by the enormous thickness of the diaper
text: covering the young lady's backside. But a narcotics
dialog: agent is not necessarily the most qualified person to
dialog: notice something odd like this.
text: Agent #3 silently observes Michael, who gives him a big
text: smile as he slips on Mary's pajama bottoms. Michael
text: picks Mary up and for the first time talks to her in the
text: kind of silly babytalk used by adoring parents.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Okey-dokey, honeybunch, it's time
dialog: to go beddy-bye now... We're gonna
dialog: take a nice long nappy-wappy...
text: He goes back to the living room, followed by Agent #3.
text: Agent #1 is in the process of showing Peter a photograph.
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: Do you recognize anyone in this
dialog: picture?
text: Peter looks: it's the photo of Jack and Paul that was
text: taken at the beginning of the movie.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Sure. This is Jack Collins.
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: Oh yeah? Now that's interesting.
text: Michael has laid Mary down for a nap in her basket,
text: observed by the five cops. He now sits down, cheerful
text: and bubbling over with enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: So! Can I get you something to
dialog: drink?
text: Agent #1 totally ignores him.
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: So, who's the baby belong to?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It's Jack's daughter.
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: And why are you two taking care of
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Because her mother's in Europe
dialog: for six months, and since Jack had
dialog: to be away for two weeks, I took
dialog: my vacation to take care of her,
dialog: I love kids.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah, Peter and I just love kids!
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: Now that's interesting. Well,
dialog: we'll be seeing each other again
text: soon, in fact very soon. In the
dialog: 63.
dialog: meantime, I'd appreciate it if you
dialog: didn't leave New York in the next
dialog: few days.
text: All the cops head for the door. Michael accompanies
text: them, putting on a very urbane act.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Come back anytime, gentlemen.
dialog: You're always welcome here. We
dialog: have no particular plans to leave
dialog: New York in the near future, so
dialog: don't worry about us now. 'Bye now.
text: Once the cops are gone, Michael races back to the living
text: room. Peter has collapsed into his armchair.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (in a low tone)
dialog: Christ, what a mess! They'll be on
dialog: our tails around the clock! How
dialog: the hell are we gonna get rid of
dialog: the goddamn dope?! By the way,
dialog: where is it?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (also speaking in
dialog: a low tone)
dialog: It's cool, don't worry, I got it
text: stashed.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Where?
text: Michael points to Mary's bottom.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: This way it's close at hand!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Are you out of your mind??
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Relax, will you.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
text: I diapered the dope on her right
text: in front of the cop and he never
dialog: noticed a thing!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I told the cops we were taking
dialog: care of her. You realize we're
dialog: now stuck with the kid till Jack
dialog: 64.
dialog: comes back. There ain't nobody
dialog: coming to pick her up, and I have
dialog: to go back to the office today!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Wait a minute. You're not gonna
dialog: stick me with this kid! Tell
dialog: them you need a maternity leave,
dialog: tell them anything, but we've got
dialog: to go 50-50 on this!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And that's not all -- we haven't
dialog: heard from the punks yet either!
scene_heading: 66 EXT. STREET - DAY 66
text: Hidden within a parked car, three men are keeping a close
text: watch on the entrance to Peter, Michael and Jack's build-

text: and pull away.
scene_heading: 67 INT. APARTMENT - DAY 67
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (on the phone; things
dialog: are heating up)
dialog: That's right, you heard right:
dialog: I'm not coming in to work for two
dialog: weeks... No, I can't explain why...
dialog: (in a louder tone)
dialog: ... Because I can't, that's all!...
dialog: NO, this has nothing to do with
dialog: chasing ass! Jerry... Jerry!
dialog: Will you stop screaming for a
dialog: minute and listen? I'm in trouble,
dialog: you understand? Deep trouble... I
dialog: know... I know...
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: (yells)
dialog: ... Goddammit, Jerry, of course
dialog: winning the competition is
dialog: important to me! The firm's my
dialog: whole life if you must know. No,
dialog: no, please -- don't send anyone
dialog: over here... Don't you come either.
dialog: No, Jerry... Okay, listen, I'll be
dialog: there in a half-hour, but I can't
dialog: stay long. No! Don't come here!
dialog: I'll be right over.
text: He hangs up. Michael enters the room, with his coat on.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: 65.
dialog: I gotta go over to Mr. Oxman's --
dialog: he just called and he's freaking
dialog: out. He says if I don't bring
dialog: some cartoons over now, the deal's
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You're going now?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah, but don't worry about it,
dialog: I'll be back before it's time
text: for her next bottle. She's asleep
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Terrific, just terrific! Jerry
dialog: just called: I have to go to the
dialog: office right now.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, call him back. Tell him
dialog: you'll come later.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: There's no way. I can't, he's
dialog: suicidal. Why don't you call Oxman
dialog: and tell him you'll be there in a
dialog: few hours.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You're crazy. Oxman is leaving in
dialog: an hour. If I don't meet him
dialog: before then, I blow my 15,000
dialog: dollar contract.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh shit, I can't take this
dialog: anymore!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Look, maybe we could pawn her off
dialog: on Mrs. Razzolini, just for a
dialog: couple of hours -- she's crazy
dialog: about her!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Good idea! Let's go.
scene_heading: 68 INT. BUILDING - DUSK 68
text: Peter and Michael get out of the elevator on Mrs.
text: Razzolini's floor. They each are holding one of the
text: handles on the basket. They are walking quickly.
text: Suddenly Michael stops Peter.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Wait -- I hear someone... I'll go
dialog: see...
text: Peter waits with the basket. Michael tiptoes to the
text: corner of the corridor.
text: At the very end of the corridor, on Mrs. Razzolini's
text: doorstep, he sees the three narcotics Agents talking with
text: Mrs. Razzolini. We can hear snippets of their
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: RAZZOLINI
dialog: Yes, I brought a package up to
dialog: them... I think it was last
dialog: Sunday...
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: What are these people like? What
dialog: kind of lifestyle do they have?
text: Michael hastily returns to Peter, still on tiptoes. He
text: leads him back to the elevator and pushes the elevator
dialog: button.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Just as I thought -- the goddamn
text: cops are grilling Mrs. Razzolini.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh shit! We sure as hell can't
dialog: hand her the baby with an ass full
text: of dope... right in front of the
dialog: narcs!
text: The elevator has arrived meanwhile.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (breaking down)
dialog: What should we do? I really gotta
dialog: go...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Listen, she's just had her bottle.
dialog: She's sleeping like a log. Let's
text: just leave her in the apartment.
dialog: What can possibly happen to her?
text: She's as regular as clockwork.
text: She won't wake up till 8:30 and
dialog: we'll easily be back by then...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, you're right, we won't be
dialog: long.
text: They rush into the elevator.
dialog: 67.
scene_heading: 69 EXT. STREET - DUSK 69
text: The three men, slumped in their car, are watching the
text: door of the apartment building.
text: The three narcotics Agents emerge from the building and
text: walk away. A short time goes by. Peter and Michael
text: emerge from the building and quickly walk away. The three
text: men get out of their car, cross the street and enter the
dialog: building.
scene_heading: 70 INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT 70
text: Peter comes out of the elevator, key in hand. He's about
text: to put it in the lock on the door, but stops short -- the
text: door is already open.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Michael? Michael, are you here?
dialog: No answer.
text: Peter pushes the door open. The sight that greets his
text: eyes is very dismaying. It looks like a tornado has hit
dialog: the house. Everything's on the floor, it's all been
text: smashed, it's all been ripped apart. Gone is the beauti-
dialog: ful apartment that had been so lovingly decorated. In
text: its place, utter devastation and shambles.
text: Peter stands there speechless for a moment, then an awful
text: thought crosses his mind. He runs like crazy into his
text: room -- the basket's not there. Stepping over the debris
text: and all the things strewn over the floor, he rushes into
text: the living room, then into Michael's room. The basket's
text: nowhere to be seen.
text: Peter falls apart; without even realizing it, he's moan-
text: ing and muttering distractedly. He runs into Jack's
text: room, into the kitchen, into the bathroom. The basket is
text: nowhere to be seen. Peter runs all over, back and forth
text: ten times in all the rooms. Tears are flowing from his
text: eyes.
text: Suddenly, he hears FAINT CRIES. They're coming from the
text: back bathroom. Peter rushes to it, practically ripping
text: the door from its hinges. There on the toilet is the
text: basket, and on it there's a note written in big messy
text: printing which says: "NEXT TIME WE TAKE HER."
text: Mary looks at Peter and smiles; she seems in great shape.
text: A distraught Peter picks her up, hugs her tightly and
text: kisses her all over as he takes her into his room.
text: Just then, Michael appears in the corridor, silent and
dialog: 68.
text: overwhelmed. He comes to the door to Peter's room and
text: looks at him. Peter, mortified to have been caught
text: kissing Mary, hastily distances himself from her, hold-
text: ing her at arm's length. He puts her down on his bed
text: and exits the room.
scene_heading: 71 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 71
text: The debris has been shoved up against the walls. Peter
text: and Michael, in their pajamas and dead tired, are slumped
text: over the table. Peter is giving Mary her bottle.
text: Michael is looking at Mary as though he were seeing her
text: for the first time.
scene_heading: 72 INT. PETER'S ROOM - NIGHT 72
text: Peter is in bed, completely out of it.
text: Michael is changing Mary very carefully. He puts one
text: diaper on her, then the second one, full of dope. He
text: lays Mary down in her basket, then places the basket on
text: the bed, nestled between the wall and Peter's body.
text: Michael, holding the soiled diaper, silently goes out.
text: Once he's alone, Peter leans over the basket. Mary and
text: he stare at each other intently and seriously. Peter
text: switches off the light.
scene_heading: 73 INT. APARTMENT - DAWN 73
text: The DOORBELL RINGS.
text: Michael, asleep on his mattress on the floor in the
text: middle of his wrecked bedroom, emerges from sleep and
text: glances at his clock: it's 6:10 AM. He staggers to the
text: front door and opens it. The door is being held together
text: with a string.
text: Agents #1, #2, and #3 are at the door, with four other
text: cops backing them up.
text: Mrs. Razzolini is standing behind them and staring, wide-
text: eyed, a look of horror on her face.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Morning, officers. Can I help
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
text: (holding out a piece
dialog: of paper to him)
dialog: Search warrant.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: 69.
dialog: (playing the gentleman,
dialog: waving away the paper)
dialog: I believe you, officer. Go ahead,
dialog: we have nothing to hide. Hello,
dialog: Mrs. Razzolini!
text: Mrs. Razzolini turns her back on him and hurries away.
text: The cops enter the apartment.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You'll have to excuse the mess...
dialog: We had a few friends over last night...
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: (looking at the
dialog: devastation)
dialog: Oh, really? Well, if I were you
dialog: I'd get myself some new friends!
text: Peter comes in, in his bathrobe, furious.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What the hell are you guys looking
dialog: for, anyway?
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: Probably the same things your
dialog: friends were looking for last
dialog: night! Didn't Mrs. Razzolini
dialog: bring you a package last Sunday?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You mean the chocolate Easter
dialog: bunnies? We ate them already.
text: He starts to walk away.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Anyway, you have no idea how many
dialog: packages we've been getting lately.
dialog: It's hard to keep track of them.
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: Maybe we can help.
dialog: (to his colleagues)
dialog: Let's get to work!
text: All the cops enter the apartment.
scene_heading: 74 INT. PETER'S ROOM - DAY 74
text: Peter is in bed, with the basket beside him. A narcotics
text: AGENT is rummaging through his scattered belongings.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Would you mind if I look in your
dialog: 70.
dialog: bed?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (big smile)
dialog: My pleasure. Try not to make a
dialog: mess.
text: Peter gets up, takes the basket off the bed and keeps it
text: in his hands. The Agent searches the bed.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: I'll look in the basket, if you
dialog: don't mind...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Be my guest.
text: He picks up Mary with her huge diaper. The Agent
text: searches the whole basket.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Thank you very much, sorry about
dialog: this...
text: He goes out. Peter, undaunted, pats Mary's big behind.
scene_heading: 75 INT. APARTMENT - DAY 75
text: The cops are leaving.
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: Well, there's obviously been a
dialog: mistake. As far as you're
dialog: concerned this investigation is
dialog: closed. We apologize again.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (big smile)
dialog: Oh, don't mention it! It was a
dialog: pleasure having you here! I hope
dialog: you'll find what you're looking
dialog: for very soon!
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: (looking straight
dialog: at him)
dialog: So do we.
text: Michael closes the door and races into the living room
text: where he discovers Peter putting on his jacket.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Did you hear that? He said
dialog: there'd been a mistake and they
dialog: weren't going to bother us anymore.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Bullshit, it's a trick.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You think so? Really?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: They just said that to put us off
dialog: guard. They saw the condition
dialog: this apartment's in.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: They know the punks were here
dialog: looking for the dope and that they
dialog: probably didn't find it. So that
dialog: means we've still got it.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: But he said the investigation was
dialog: closed.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Okay, let's just see how closed
dialog: it is. I'll go downstairs. You
dialog: watch out the window and see if
dialog: I'm being tailed.
scene_heading: 76 EXT. STREET - DAY 76
text: Michael is peeking out at the street from the window
text: above. Peter comes out of the building and turns left,
text: walking very quickly.
text: Suddenly, Peter stops, turns around and retraces his
text: steps. We can clearly see a man, who was walking about
text: six yards behind Peter on the opposite side of the
text: street, also turn around and retrace his steps.
dialog: It is Graton.
scene_heading: 77 INT. APARTMENT - DAY 77
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (entering)
dialog: So? Was I right?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: There's one guy for sure! A
text: redhead, kind of young, disguised
dialog: sort of like a college student.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I knew it. They're going to be
text: watching us around the clock.
dialog: 72.
dialog: How are we going to get the dope
dialog: back to the punks?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I have the feeling they'll come
dialog: to us.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We'll have to be very careful.
scene_heading: 78 EXT. STREET - NIGHTFALL 78
text: Michael is walking on the street carrying two bags of
text: groceries. Suddenly, a guy walks up to him and elbows
text: him sharply.
speaker_heading: PUNK
dialog: Hi! Doin' a little shopping, huh?
dialog: How's your place -- not too much
dialog: damage, I hope.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What do you guys want?
speaker_heading: PUNK
dialog: We want the dope. Tomorrow.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And we want to give it to you.
dialog: But the cops are tailing us
dialog: nonstop. Matter of fact, there's
dialog: one right behind us now...
speaker_heading: PUNK
dialog: That's your problem, man. Figure
dialog: out a way to shake 'em. Either we
dialog: safely get the dope tomorrow, or
dialog: you, your friend and the kid'll
dialog: get this.
text: (he quickly stabs
dialog: the grocery bags
dialog: three times)
dialog: We'll call you tonight.
text: He runs off, disappearing into the darkness. From the
text: slit-open grocery bag milk flows out onto the sidewalk.
text: Michael is shaking all over. Standing about twenty yards
text: away, Graton hasn't missed a thing.
scene_heading: 79 INT. COP CAR - NIGHT 79
text: Not far from Peter, Michael and Jack's building, Graton,
text: in his car, is talking into the microphone of his police
dialog: radio.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: ... My snitch told me the gang
dialog: hasn't gotten the dope back yet,
dialog: but they will soon. They made
dialog: contact with the two guys tonight
dialog: ... No, no, they don't know I'm
text: tailing them. These jerks are
dialog: going to fall right into my
dialog: hands...
scene_heading: 80 INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT 80
text: Peter and Michael are seated in the living room, which is
text: still an utter wreck. They can't take their eyes off the
text: phone that's between the two of them.
text: They are sitting silently, not moving.
text: Mary is playing in her basket.
text: The PHONE RINGS. Peter and Michael both jump three feet
text: in the air.
text: Michael picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hello? Who? Goddamn it, where
dialog: are you?...
dialog: (to Peter)
text: ... It's Jack. He just landed in
text: Newark. He came back early.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Gimme that.
text: (he grabs the receiver
dialog: out of Michael's
dialog: hand)
dialog: Jack? What the hell are you
dialog: doing?
text: (listens to a long
dialog: explanation)
dialog: Yeah... yeah... oh yeah? Well,
dialog: listen very carefully, Jack.
dialog: That wonderful, fantastic babe
dialog: you brought back from Bolivia?
dialog: The one you're gonna marry
dialog: tomorrow? Well, you're not going
dialog: to bring her here!... You are
dialog: going to say 'goodbye' to her very
text: nicely and put her in a cab back
dialog: to Bolivia... Why? Because there's
dialog: another wonderful, fantastic babe
dialog: waiting for you right here at home
dialog: ... Who is she? Oh, that's a
dialog: surprise! You'll see when you
dialog: get here. But believe me, she's
dialog: 74.
dialog: out of this world. You're going
dialog: to be up all night with this babe.
dialog: She's crazy about you.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (in a low tone)
dialog: Make it quick, the punks may be
dialog: trying to call...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: So hurry home, Jack, this little
dialog: doll can't wait to see you. 'Bye.
text: He hangs up.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (in a furious temper)
dialog: That goddamn mother fuckin' jerk
dialog: of an asshole! I swear when he
dialog: comes through the door I'll kill
dialog: him! I'll...
text: The PHONE interrupts. Michael leaps up and answers it.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hello? Listen, tomorrow, Central
text: Park at the fountain near the
dialog: merry-go-round, five o'clock. Be
dialog: there, but...
text: They've hung up on the other end. Michael hangs up
text: and sits down, drained.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: ... That was it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (equally drained)
dialog: All we can do now is hope our
dialog: plan works.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You think the cops have our phone
dialog: bugged?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don't think that's legal, is it?
scene_heading: 80A EXT. STREET - NIGHT 80A
text: Graton is speaking into the microphone of his radio.
text: Next to him sits a cop with phone-tapping equipment.
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: (very excited)
dialog: We got 'em, Chief. Five o'clock
dialog: 75.
text: tomorrow at the fountain near the
dialog: merry-go-round! I'll arrange for
dialog: back-up... Hold it, someone's going
dialog: into their building...
text: We see Jack getting out of a taxi with his luggage
text: and going into the building.
scene_heading: 81 INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT 81
text: Jack emerges from the elevator happy as a lark and
text: feeling frisky.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (opening the door)
dialog: Yoo-hoo, guys! I'm home! I've
dialog: got presents for you... so where's
dialog: that wonderful fantastic babe...
text: He enters and sees the state the apartment is in.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: ... What the hell happened here?
text: He walks into the apartment, shocked and overwhelmed.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Peter! Michael! Are you here?
text: He goes into the living room -- No one'sthere. Into
text: Michael's room. No one's there. He goes into his own
text: room, where the destruction is even moreshocking than
dialog: elsewhere since nothing has been touchedin there.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, my God! My beautiful room!
dialog: My beautiful, beautiful room!
dialog: (very angry)
dialog: Michael!... Peter -- where the
dialog: hell are you, for Chrissakes?
text: He runs like a madman into Peter's room and stops short
text: on the threshold. Michael and Peter are each holding a
text: handle of the basket as they rock it gently.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (furious)
dialog: What the hell is going on around
dialog: here? What happened to this place?
dialog: What happened to my room?
text: Peter and Michael look him right in the eye, still
text: rocking the basket.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And anyway, what the hell are you
dialog: 76.
dialog: swinging that thing for?
dialog: (silence)
dialog: Answer me for God's sake!
dialog: (looking in)
dialog: Oh my God, there's a kid in there!
dialog: Have you've gone bananas!? There's
dialog: a Goddamn kid in there!
dialog: (silence)
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, I get it. The 'silent' treatment!
dialog: Okay, if you won't talk to me, you can
dialog: talk to my lawyer! This is grounds for
dialog: divorce! You're in big trouble, the
dialog: both of you.
text: He leaves. A second later, he comes back.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I paid to have this place decorated,
dialog: too, you know. I'm not going to let
dialog: you get away with this.
text: He leaves; a second later, he comes back.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's too late to try and talk me
dialog: out of it. I'm history. I'm gone.
dialog: I'm outa here.
text: He leaves. A second later, he comes back.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm giving you one more chance to...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (very calmly)
dialog: Would it be asking too much of you
dialog: to shut your big mouth for a few
dialog: seconds? There is a child here
text: who's trying to sleep.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And that's another thing! I will
dialog: not have a baby in this house!
dialog: Babies are not part of our agreement!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Michael, please hold me back... or
dialog: I'll kill him.
text: Michael takes the basket handle from Peter's hand, places
text: the basket carefully on the bed, and walks without a word
text: towards Jack, who he takes by the arm and steers into the
text: living room. Peter softly shuts the door behind them and
text: follows.
dialog: 77.
scene_heading: 82 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 82
text: Michael sits Jack down in an armchair. He speaks with
dialog: forced calm.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: All right, Jack. Why don't we
dialog: start at the very beginning. The
dialog: very day you left for your
dialog: vacation...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey, will you please stop talking
dialog: like Mr. Rogers? It's getting on
dialog: my nerves.
speaker_heading: PETER
text: (his fuse has blown,
dialog: laughing hysterically)
dialog: His nerves! Ha. Ha. Ha. His
dialog: nerves! Michael, his nerves!
dialog: You wanna talk about nerves! Then
dialog: just shut up and listen. It so
dialog: happens we don't want a kid here
dialog: either, but when someone dumps one
dialog: on us, we take goddamn care of it.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah, we take goddam care of it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We haven't had a decent night's
dialog: sleep in two weeks. Michael's
dialog: probably going to lose a $15,000
dialog: contract...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: Peter couldn't leave. Jerry almost
dialog: jumped out the window. It's lucky
dialog: they even made it to the finals!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: First, we've got the narcs on our
dialog: ass, then there's the drug gang
dialog: threatening to carve us up. Then
dialog: bottles... bottles... every three
dialog: hours, bottles.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And diapers. Have you ever tried
dialog: to do diapers?
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: 'La Paz, Bolivia...' He calls from
dialog: ... 'I'm onto something hot.' He
dialog: says. 'Did the package get there?'
dialog: He says. You asshole!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And the day they wrecked the
text: apartment, Peter came home and
dialog: couldn't find Mary. I've never
dialog: seen him in tears like that bef...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (cutting him off;
dialog: embarrassed)
dialog: Never mind about that. Look, Jack,
dialog: you got us into this mess, and
dialog: you're going to help us get out of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What are you guys talking about?
dialog: What narcs? What gang? And who's
dialog: that fucking baby?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: For your information, the 'fucking'
dialog: baby's name is Mary. And if I
dialog: were you, I'd watch what I said
dialog: about her... because she just so
dialog: happens to be your daughter!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What??
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And it just so happens, we've got
dialog: a lot better things to do with our
dialog: lives than wipe a baby's ass, even
dialog: if she's yours!
text: Peter and Michael exit, slamming the door.
scene_heading: 83 INT. BATHROOM - DAY 83
text: Peter is slicking his hair back with Brylcream. Jack
text: is sitting on the edge of the bathtub, with his arms
text: crossed. He observes Peter silently.
scene_heading: 84 INT. APARTMENT - MICHAEL'S ROOM - DAY 84
text: Mary is lying on the bed and Michael is putting the dope-
text: filled diaper on her.
dialog: 79.
scene_heading: 85 INT. BATHROOM - DAY 85
text: Peter is giving a tousled-looking punk hairstyle to
text: Jack, who is looking at himself in the mirror.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's ridiculous. I look
dialog: ridiculous.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You look completely ridiculous
dialog: -- so what?
scene_heading: 86 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 86
text: MARY, wearing a bonnet and coat, is lying on one of the
text: couches, CHIRPING merrily. Next to her, also in his
text: coat, Michael is just finishing wrapping a brown package
text: which he puts in a plastic bag, along with a book, a
text: baby rattle, and a clean diaper.
text: Peter and Jack, disguised as punks, each with punk
text: hairstyles and wearing black sunglasses, are climbing
text: out the window leading to the fire escape.
scene_heading: 87 EXT. STREET - DAY 87
text: Michael exits the building. Mary, wrapped in a little
text: woolen blanket, is in his arms. Michael is also carry-
text: ing his plastic bag.
text: Graton, in his car, is speaking into the radio mike.
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: Okay, he's coming out alone.
dialog: I'll follow him. Someone else
dialog: stay here to keep an eye on the
dialog: other guys.
scene_heading: 88 EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY 88
text: Michael is lying on the grass near the fountain with
text: Mary on her blanket near him.
text: Graton is nearby, also lying casually on the grass,
text: watching them out of the corner of his eye.
text: Michael glances at his watch, then at the passersby.
text: The punk from the day before walks by with his arm around
text: a girl. He strolls by casually. He spots Michael and
text: their eyes meet. The couple sit down on a bench a few
text: yards away and they begin "making out."
dialog: 80.
text: Michael leans over Mary, coochie-coos her and surrepti-
text: tiously takes off her diaper, which he puts down beside
text: him. He puts the clean diaper on her.
text: Graton, nervous and wary, watches Michael and the
text: passersby. Just then, two punks (Peter and Jack) come
text: running up to Michael. He ostensibly takes the brown
text: package out of his plastic bag and gives it to them.
text: The two punks immediately take off with the package.
text: Graton leaps up, shouts "let's get 'em" and takes off
text: after the punks, followed by about 10 other plainclothes
text: detectives, who'd been hiding all around.
text: Michael quickly gets up, picks Mary up and discreetly
text: deposits the dope-filled diaper in a trash can, giving
text: the punk on the bench an intent look. Then he goes off
text: in the direction of the cops.
text: The punk calmly goes over to the trash can, takes out the
text: diaper, which he stuffs into his girl friend's purse, and
text: goes off in the opposite direction.
text: The cops have meanwhile arrested Peter and Jack, who put
text: up no resistance whatsoever. Michael now joins them.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: Inspector Graton, Narcotics. Do
dialog: you admit you gave these men this
dialog: package?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Sure. I gave it to them, just a
dialog: moment ago.
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: (to one of the cops)
dialog: Officer, will you please open this
dialog: package in front of these witnesses?
text: The cop opens the package: it's a box of chocolate
text: Easter bunnies. Graton is mortified. He crushes all
dialog: the bunnies -- there's absolutely nothing but chocolate
text: inside them.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Is it against the law to give a
dialog: box of candy to my friends?
text: Peter and Jack take off their glasses.
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: Oh, it's you guys!
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What's the problem?
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: You guys must think you're pretty
dialog: smart, don't ya?
dialog: (suddenly freezes)
dialog: Holy shit! The diaper!
text: Graton starts running like crazy back to the fountain.
text: He rummages like a sick dog all around the spot where
text: Michael had been lying. Suddenly he dashes toward the
text: trash can and dumps out its contents, throwing the
text: garbage around like a lunatic.
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: The goddam diaper! What a jerk,
dialog: what a goddam schmuck I am!
text: Peter, Michael, Jack and the 10 plainclothes detectives
text: watch Graton going bananas.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (to the cops)
dialog: I think that guy needs a vacation.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He should try South America.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, I hear it's nice there this
dialog: time of year.
scene_heading: 89 INT. GRATON'S BOSS'S OFFICE - DAY 89
text: The Chief is standing behind his desk, red-faced with

speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Let's face it... Graton... You've
dialog: got shit for brains.
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: I'm sure the dope was in the
dialog: diaper. Can I go on tailing them?
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Forget it. I have solid information
dialog: your three suspects never had anything
dialog: to do with the dealers or the dope.
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: I'm sure the dope was in the diaper.
speaker_heading: CHIEF

scene_heading: 90 INT. APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - EVENING 90
text: In the devastated living room Peter, still disguised as
text: a punk, and Michael, both very high, are dancing around
text: in circles with each other and laughing. They are
text: singing a lullaby at the top of their lungs, and har-
text: monizing. Peter is holding Mary close, and Michael,
text: holding a near-empty bottle of liquor, staggers over to
text: him and starts turning around in circles with him.
text: MARY, snuggled up warmly between Peter and Michael, is
text: LAUGHING her head off.
text: In the b.g., in the hall, Jack, also still in his punk
text: getup, is on the phone. He's got a glass in his hand
text: and is a little smashed.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Paul, hi, it's Jack! Hey, listen,
dialog: I brought you back a little present
dialog: from South America. Can I see you
dialog: right away so I can give it to you?
dialog: ... Yeah, the sooner the better!
dialog: I can't wait to let you have it.
dialog: How about 67th and East River?
scene_heading: 91 EXT. EAST RIVER - EVENING 91
text: A broadly smiling Jack arrives at the riverside. Paul
text: is sitting on a bench. When he sees Jack, he gets up
text: and comes to greet him, smiling and extending his hand.
text: Without warning, Jack suddenly jumps him and sends him
text: with a forceful shove flying into the water. Paul lands
text: on his back with a big splash, and comes back up to the
text: surface totally dumbfounded. Jack leans over the water
text: and yells at him, like a madman, still a bit drunk.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That was for your 'little' package,
dialog: and consider yourself lucky I
dialog: didn't turn you in to the cops!
dialog: And get one thing into your thick
dialog: skull: I have never touched dope,
dialog: 83.
dialog: and I never will. You and your
dialog: shit-dealing, you can go straight
dialog: to hell, and you can take the
dialog: money you make from it and stick

text: Jack turns his back on Paul and staggers off.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hey, come back! -- how'm I gonna

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (very aggravated)
dialog: Listen, Sylvia, you've got to come

dialog: The dates coincide! Big deal!
dialog: That doesn't prove a thing... But

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Why don't you call her back?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't have the number. I got
text: a message to her through her
dialog: agency, they won't tell me where
dialog: she is. I don't even know where

dialog: better believe she's not going

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What? Jesus Christ, Michael, why
dialog: didn't you let me talk to her!?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: She would have just hung up on

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Right. Full of shit.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Then she should give her a bottle

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: Solo works just as well.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Now, as for the nipples, you've

speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: As soon as the hole gets too big
dialog: she's gotta throw them out -- This
dialog: is extra, extra, extra-specially
dialog: important -- 'cause if the hole's
dialog: too big, the milk comes out too

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You're bringing her back?
speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: So what happened? Did you two

speaker_heading: JACK

dialog: Goddamn cruises...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Didn't she want to take her?
speaker_heading: JACK

scene_heading: MRS. BRETSAWS
dialog: Good afternoon. I'm Mathilda

speaker_heading: JACK

text: looks into the living room through the crack in the door.
text: Peter, too, peeks in.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Must be some nanny he found through

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (softly, to Michael)
text: She wants to see Mary.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, but the nanny, Mrs. Bretsaws,
text: she wants to see her.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, damn it, no! You're gonna

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: JACK

scene_heading: MRS. BRETSAWS
dialog: (tense, but still
dialog: calm)
dialog: I never said that I wanted the

dialog: asked to see her. If I'm going
dialog: to be taking care of the child on
dialog: a round-the-clock basis, then...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: 'Round-the-clock'? Whaddya mean
dialog: 'round the clock'? Are you

scene_heading: MRS. BRETSAWS

scene_heading: MRS. BRETSAWS

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, yeah? How do you figure that?
scene_heading: MRS. BRETSAWS
dialog: Shouldn't I be discussing all this

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, listen, Mrs. Fretsaw, umm...
dialog: Brainsore...
scene_heading: MRS. BRETSAWS
dialog: Bretsaws, Mrs. Bretsaws.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Right... Bratsnot, lemme tell
dialog: you something. With a child you
dialog: always know who the mother is,
dialog: but the father -- that's another
dialog: kettle of fish. So don't give me
dialog: that bullshit, okay?
scene_heading: MRS. BRETSAWS
dialog: Very well. I won't discuss it any
dialog: further with you. Will you please
dialog: show me where the kitchen and the
dialog: bathroom are?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What for?
scene_heading: MRS. BRETSAWS
dialog: So I can make you a list of the
dialog: things we need.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What do you mean, make you a list?
dialog: -- Don't you do the shopping
dialog: yourself?
scene_heading: MRS. BRETSAWS
dialog: No shopping or laundry or
dialog: housekeeping. I am a professional
dialog: nanny.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We have plenty of everything.
scene_heading: MRS. BRETSAWS
dialog: Do you have a sufficient amount
dialog: of fruit and vegetables for the
dialog: child?
speaker_heading: PETER
text: She only eats milk and cereal.
dialog: 94.
scene_heading: MRS. BRETSAWS
dialog: That's not enough, sir. From
dialog: the age of three months children
dialog: should be started on a normal,
dialog: varied diet.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh that's bullshit. You don't
dialog: feed a baby like an adult.
scene_heading: MRS. BRETSAWS
dialog: (mockingly)
dialog: Oh, really? And how would you
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I've read plenty of books. The
dialog: diet recommended by those quack
dialog: pediatricians today is way too
dialog: rich. I'm in favor of natural
dialog: methods, Mrs. Breathmint.
scene_heading: MRS. BRETSAWS
dialog: Bretsaws, Mrs. Bretsaws.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: For instance, if a child is having
dialog: trouble getting to sleep, what
dialog: would you do?
scene_heading: MRS. BRETSAWS
dialog: Depends, if it was a continuing
dialog: problem, I might recommend a
dialog: mild sedative...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (exploding,

dialog: I knew you'd say something like
dialog: that, you jerk!
scene_heading: MRS. BRETSAWS
dialog: Fine. Anything you say, sir.
dialog: Let me just remind you that I have

speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: 'Medicine's a whore and the

scene_heading: MRS. BRETSAWS
dialog: No, I don't. We must listen to

speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: get out of here right this minute

dialog: This is my home, now get out!
scene_heading: MRS. BRETSAWS

dialog: everything's just fine and dandy.

dialog: that's left are the daycare
dialog: centers, but Peter's positive
dialog: they're a breeding pit for A.I.D.S.
dialog: So you tell me: What are we
dialog: suppose to do? You want me to
dialog: split with the kid? Or dump her
dialog: in an orphanage?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (pretending to
dialog: play the violin)
dialog: 96.
dialog: Here we go.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Look, her mother'll be back in
dialog: less than five months. Let's not
dialog: waste a shitload of time looking
dialog: for a solution for such a short
dialog: time. Let's get organized.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What do you mean, organized?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, you'll have to ask to fly
dialog: the New York-Washington shuttle
dialog: for five months, on account of
dialog: serious personal problems.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What? Never! I'd rather be a
dialog: subway conductor.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (barking)
dialog: Then dump her in an orphanage,
dialog: 'cause there's no way we're gonna
dialog: take care of her all by ourselves
dialog: anymore!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (stubborn, yelling)
dialog: No! Never.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (unruffled)
dialog: That way, you can do the 6-10 A.M.
dialog: shift. That amounts to two bottles
dialog: and two diaper changes. You do
dialog: the shopping when you get home in
dialog: the evening and that's all. Peter,
dialog: you'll take the 6-10 P.M. shift.
dialog: That's two bottles and two diaper
text: changes, her bath and her laundry.
dialog: Since I work at home I'll take
dialog: the longest shift from 10 A.M. to
dialog: 6 P.M. I'll take her to the park
dialog: for an hour, but that's it. No
dialog: shopping, no cooking, no cleaning.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What if she gets up at night?
dialog: 97.
dialog: Whose shift is that?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well... I thought you might do

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Not a chance! I'm not doing the

dialog: I have too much work to catch up
dialog: on for the competition.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, needless to say I refuse,
dialog: too!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Listen to me, you selfish bastards!
dialog: My shift is eight hours in a row.
dialog: No way I'm gonna do nights too.
text: After 6 P.M. she can scream all
dialog: she wants, I don't give a shit.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You know, Jack, you're a real
dialog: slime ball! We give you the
dialog: easiest shift: the morning. She's
dialog: always in great shape in the morning,
dialog: isn't she? We've got to work like
dialog: crazy to save our jobs and you
dialog: have the nerve to refuse nights.
dialog: Goddamit, she's your daughter.
dialog: Are you that horny?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (extremely pissed

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Thanks for the advice -- now why

dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (in a state of
dialog: shock)
dialog: I never let her scream for hours!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You'd resort to any theory to not

speaker_heading: JACK

text: She gets up, slips on a T-shirt, and exits the bedroom.
dialog: 103.
text: She stops at the door to the living room and contemplates
text: the three men who are singing earnestly around the crib.
speaker_heading: BRUNETTE
dialog: (in a loud voice)
dialog: Hey, choir boys, you gonna keep
dialog: it up all night?
text: Peter and Michael stare at her, scandalized. Jack
text: gestures wildly to her to shut up and go away.
speaker_heading: BRUNETTE
dialog: Oh my God! There's a baby in
dialog: there! I'm sorry...
text: She goes back to Jack's room.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (hissing)
dialog: Who the hell's that broad?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Watch your mouth, will you? I'm
dialog: in love with that young lady.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Can't she speak softly like
dialog: everyone else?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (getting angry)
dialog: Listen, at night I'm in charge.
dialog: So get off my back, will you?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Will you quit fighting all the
dialog: time? She just fell asleep, for
dialog: Chrissake.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, Michael, go to hell! I'm
dialog: sick and tired of your little
dialog: 'Father Knows Best' number!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, you're right, I'm fed up
dialog: with it, too!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (terribly upset)
dialog: Okay, that's it. Into the
dialog: kitchen.
text: He exits, furious. Peter and Jack follow after him.
text: Fuming, they file one after the other down the corridor
text: past the stunned Brunette in her T-shirt who was waiting
dialog: 104.
text: for Jack by the door to his room. The three guys close
text: the kitchen door and start yelling at each other. They
text: all talk at once.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I've had it with you assholes! I
dialog: won't be the buffer between you
dialog: two anymore...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I didn't ask you to get up, I know
dialog: what I have to do.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don't mind getting up, that's
dialog: not the point...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'm not a punching bag! You
dialog: assholes!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: If I can't bring a girl back here
dialog: anymore, just say so. And I'm gone.
dialog: I'm outta here. With Mary.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You can bring whoever you want as
text: long as they speak softly like
dialog: everyone else!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: One thing I know: I can't goddamn
dialog: wait till Sylvia gets back!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, you can say that again!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And again, and again, and again...
text: Meanwhile, the Brunette has put her clothes back on and
text: gathered up her belongings. Now she enters the kitchen.
speaker_heading: BRUNETTE
dialog: Sorry to disturb you guys, but
dialog: I'm splitting. I didn't come
dialog: here to be a bedwarmer. 'Bye.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (running after her)
dialog: No! Wait, please don't go... it's
dialog: all over now, I'm coming back to
dialog: bed...
speaker_heading: BRUNETTE
dialog: (at the front door)
dialog: 105.
dialog: You're very nice, but I don't
dialog: feel like it anymore now. Some
dialog: other time, okay? 'Bye.
text: She kisses him goodbye and leaves.
text: Jack is very depressed.
scene_heading: 112 INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT 112
text: Peter, Michael and Jack have guests over for dinner.
text: CLASSICAL MUSIC, a very fancy table, candles: they're
text: at the tail-end of the dinner, before dessert. Everyone
text: is very fashionably dressed.
text: Natalie is sitting between Peter and Carl. Jay and
text: Jerry, Peter's partners, are also there with their wives.
text: Michael and Sophia are having a vehement discussion as
text: usual, Jack is between two gorgeous models: CHRISTIE
text: and CAROLINE.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Have you seen the latest bi-annual
dialog: at the Whitney? Incredible! Have
dialog: you seen it, Peter?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, I haven't had the time lately.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Ah... working hard on the
dialog: competition, are you? You may
dialog: as well throw in the T-square,
dialog: old friend, you haven't got a
dialog: chance.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (somewhat harshly)
dialog: I only wish he was working hard
dialog: on the competition, but
dialog: unfortunately, that's not the
dialog: case...
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Really? What's he doing then?
dialog: He's always so busy.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Maybe he's working hard on women!
dialog: Some people have to work really
dialog: hard to get anything!
text: Natalie bursts out laughing. Peter's about to respond,
text: but stops himself suddenly. In the b.g., a BABY can be
dialog: 106.
text: heard CRYING.
text: Peter, Jack, and Michael exchange glances. Jack rushes
text: out. The guests haven't heard anything.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (whispering to
dialog: Natalie)
dialog: Why do you always have to bring
dialog: Carl along with you?
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Don't you like him?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, c'mon -- I love him! Only,
dialog: I'd like to see you alone for
dialog: once, that's all.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: He's extremely talented -- in
dialog: fact, I hate to tell you this,
dialog: but I think he and his group are
dialog: gonna win the competition.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, we'll see about that.
text: Jack returns to the table. Peter's eyes follow him
dialog: nervously.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (in a low tone,
dialog: to Jack)
dialog: Did you give her something to
dialog: drink?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE
dialog: (drunkenly)
dialog: Oh, cut it out! No more for me!
dialog: I've had eight glasses!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (in a low tone, to
dialog: Michael)
dialog: I tried, but she doesn't want
dialog: anything --
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE
dialog: I do so want some, but if I have
dialog: anymore I'll pass out!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Save room for dessert -- it's a
dialog: three-tiered cake from Balducci's!
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: 107.
dialog: Oh! Wow!
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE
dialog: (greedily)
dialog: I love three-tiered cakes!
speaker_heading: JAY'S WIFE
dialog: So what's it made of?
text: In the b.g., the BABY starts CRYING again.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Umm, it's made with whipped cream
dialog: and loads of nipples on top --
dialog: I mean, loads of... raspberries
dialog: ... I'll be right back...
text: Peter rushes out of the room. Michael and Jack exchange
text: glances. The CRYING CONTINUES.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Are you saying that's not art? Are
dialog: you really saying that's not art?
dialog: Well, then, you explain what it is.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, it's... art. I'll be right
dialog: back.
text: He gets up and goes out. Jack watches him.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Jack, tell me about those exotic
dialog: places, what is Caracas like?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (his mind elsewhere)
dialog: Well, actually... uh, lately I've
dialog: been to Washington a lot... and
dialog: uh... I'll be right back.
text: He gets up and goes out.
scene_heading: 113 INT. PETER'S ROOM - NIGHT 113
text: The three men are talking. Jack is holding Mary, whose
text: eyes are swollen with tears.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Try and put her back to bed...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm warning you, she'll scream...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'm sure she's cutting a tooth...
dialog: 108.
text: From the living room, Christie's voice can be heard.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE (O.S.)
dialog: Yoo-hoo! What are you guys doing
dialog: in there? It's fucking boring
dialog: without you...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh shit -- the guests...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You two go... I'm staying with
dialog: her. It can't be worse than
text: listening to Carl.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That's not fair -- let's take Mary
dialog: out there...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And the hell with it.
scene_heading: 114 INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT 114
text: The three men enter the living room; Jack is carrying
dialog: Mary.
speaker_heading: GUESTS
dialog: Oh, it's a baby!
speaker_heading: GUESTS (CONT'D)
dialog: Where the hell did that come
dialog: from? Wow! Is it a boy or a
dialog: girl? Who does it belong to?
dialog: So you've got a kid now?
dialog: Incredible! Does that come
dialog: from Balducci's? No kidding,
dialog: whose baby is that?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, I would like
dialog: you to meet my daughter, Mary.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (muttering)
dialog: Your daughter... your daughter...
speaker_heading: GUESTS
dialog: You're kidding! Congratulations!
dialog: She's adorable! She looks just
dialog: like you... Oh, what a cute little
dialog: girl!
text: Overwhelmed by all the people, MARY bursts out CRYING.
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (walking her back
dialog: and forth)
dialog: Don't cry, Mary, don't cry...
speaker_heading: PETER
text: There's too much noise.
text: He shuts the MUSIC OFF. MARY keeps on SCREAMING.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (to everyone)
dialog: She's teething, that's why she's
dialog: cranky.
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: Give her to me, I'll try and calm
dialog: her down.
text: Peter takes MARY on his lap. The SCREAMING CONTINUES.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (very tense)
dialog: Don't sit down -- it'll get worse.
dialog: You have to walk around.
text: Peter gets up and walks around. Jack and Michael,
text: standing, watch him walk.
text: MARY SCREAMS even LOUDER as Peter walks back and forth
text: in the room with her. The guests watch in uncomfortable
dialog: silence.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: How long have you had this kid?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: A few months...
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: (somewhat sharply)
dialog: Who's her mother, anyway?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: She's in Europe, she'll be back
dialog: in a few days.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Does she always cry like that?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No, it's only because she's
dialog: teething, she's usually very
dialog: sweet...
text: The guests remain silent.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: 110.
dialog: (to break the silence)
dialog: You'd never think something so
dialog: small could make a noise so big.
text: MARY'S CRYING fills the room.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: What if you just put her back to
dialog: bed?
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Right -- she's just throwing a
dialog: temper tantrum, put her to bed...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We already tried...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's her teeth...
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: (to Jerry)
dialog: Do you have any kids?
speaker_heading: JERRY'S WIFE
dialog: Yeah, but they're grown up now,
dialog: thank God!
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE
dialog: (to Jay)
dialog: And do you have kids, too?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE
dialog: I said... and do you have kids,
dialog: too?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: No, we both have careers.
text: The guests remain silent, MARY CONTINUES to CRY.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: So, do you think we'll get to
dialog: taste that three-tiered cake
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (to Natalie,
dialog: sarcastically)
dialog: Oh, nothing, nothing -- I was
dialog: just trying to liven up the
dialog: 111.
dialog: conversation...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE
dialog: Gosh, my ears are ringing, I
dialog: can't hear anybody.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: I must say, a crying kid is kind
dialog: of hard to take...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: We were just saying that this
text: baby's conversation is actually
dialog: rather limited... and a touch
dialog: annoying. Don't you think?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, she's not the only one
text: with a limited conversation.
dialog: At least she has an excuse, she's
dialog: a baby! What's yours?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I frankly don't know what you
dialog: mean.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I mean, I've been listening to
dialog: your pompous drivel about the
dialog: latest trends for the last two
dialog: hours, and frankly, it's a crock
dialog: of horseshit.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Come on, Peter, be nice...
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Listen, go put the baby to bed
dialog: and you guys cool it, will you?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: It's okay. I'm used to it.
dialog: Peter's always been a sore loser.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (totally out
dialog: of control)
dialog: You motherfucker, get out of
dialog: here! Get out of my house right
dialog: now or I'll kick the shit out
dialog: 112.
dialog: of you! You snobbish scum-
dialog: sucking snake!
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Peter, cut it out!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Stop it, Peter. Give her to me,
dialog: I'll put her to bed...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (beside himself)
dialog: No, I'll go.
dialog: (to all the
dialog: guests)
dialog: And you can all go fuck
dialog: yourselves! Go back to your
dialog: asinine conversations!
text: He exits with Mary. Jack, embarrassed, follows him.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (trying to recover)
dialog: Well... umm... How 'bout if I
dialog: get the cake now, okay?
text: He exits.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Well. It seems our beloved hosts
dialog: are going to be busy playing
dialog: mother for a while, so if you'll
dialog: excuse me, I'll just slip away...
dialog: (to Natalie)
dialog: ... Natalie, may I invite you to
dialog: spend the rest of the evening in
dialog: a more hospitable place?
speaker_heading: NATALIE
text: Gladly.
dialog: (to the guests)
dialog: Goodbye.
text: They exit.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to Jerry and
dialog: his wife)
dialog: Is he out of his mind or what?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: He was absolutely obnoxious.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE
dialog: (drunk, getting
dialog: up and tottering)
dialog: Hey, Caroline, I think we should
dialog: 113.
dialog: go, too. I don't feel so good...
dialog: I think I'm gonna barf...
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: (running to
dialog: help her)
dialog: Oh, God, no! Hold it back!
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE
dialog: (starting to cry)
dialog: I wanna go home...
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Okay, we're going...
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: Sorry... say goodbye to Jack
dialog: for us...
text: They exit. Christie is hanging on to Caroline.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to Jerry)
dialog: Look, there's no point in our
dialog: staying any longer. I think
dialog: it's best we leave.
speaker_heading: JAY'S WIFE
dialog: (to Jerry)
dialog: Tell Peter if was a wonderful
dialog: party.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (sad)
dialog: Okay... 'Bye...
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Can you drop me off near Soho
dialog: by any chance?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Thanks!
dialog: (to Jerry and
dialog: his Wife)
dialog: 'Bye... Say goodbye to them
dialog: for me...
text: Sophia, Jay and his Wife exit.
speaker_heading: JERRY'S WIFE
dialog: Well, we might as well go, too.
dialog: I think the evening's over.
text: She gets up, so does Jerry.
dialog: 114.
text: Michael, very playful, comes back in carrying an
text: enormous three-tiered cake.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Ta-da! Will you look at this?
dialog: Is this a cake or what? Can
dialog: someone make a little room on
dialog: the table so I can... Are you
dialog: guys leaving?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yeah, we're beat.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hey, where is everybody?
speaker_heading: JERRY'S WIFE
dialog: Well, the atmosphere wasn't
dialog: exactly festive...
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Sorry about the cake, Mike...
dialog: It looks great!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh, never mind, don't worry...
dialog: Good night...
text: Jerry and his Wife exit. Michael is left standing there
text: with his cake. Jack comes in, full of beans.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, she's asleep at last! We
dialog: sang in har... Hey, where is
dialog: everybody?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Gone. Can you make a little room
dialog: for me on the table to put the...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You mean they're all gone?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah, all of 'em, hey, can you
dialog: make a little room for me to...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (going back out,
dialog: furious)
dialog: Peter! Peter, goddamit, get out
dialog: here!
text: Peter comes back in with Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: They're all gone!
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Who gives a shit, they're all
text: jerks anyway.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hey, could you make a little
dialog: room for me on the table so
dialog: I can...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's because of the kid. They
dialog: can't stand kids.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I can't stand kids either but
dialog: that's not a reason to leave!
dialog: Dipshits, they're all a bunch
dialog: of dipshits, every one of 'em.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh, fuck it -- I'm sitting down.
text: He sits down on a chair with the cake on his lap.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And did you hear Natalie: 'She's
dialog: throwing a temper tantrum, just
dialog: put her to bed.' What a pain-in-
dialog: the-ass that broad is!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (pissed off)
dialog: Hey, you're the pain-in-the-ass!
dialog: First you dump a baby on us, then
dialog: you scare everyone away from the
dialog: party, then...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I scared everyone aw... Just
dialog: cut the crap, will you? My whole
text: life is diapers, shuttles and
dialog: bottles. I do the graveyard shift,
dialog: I'm the one who never gets any
dialog: sleep. I...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Listen, we all have two full-time
dialog: jobs! That's for sure!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And what about me? I'm a prisoner
dialog: in this house all day long, forget
dialog: about chasing ass, I haven't
dialog: gotten laid in six months. When
dialog: the hell is your friggin' Sylvia
dialog: gonna come back?
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She's been gone for six months
dialog: and four days.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: If she's not back by the end of
dialog: next week, I'm kicking her kid
dialog: out!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You better give your goddam
dialog: Sylvia hell for this!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't worry, she's gonna get it
dialog: but good!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And you can tell her we have a
dialog: lot better things to do with
dialog: our lives than wipe a baby's
dialog: ass, goddamn it!
text: He exits. So does Jack. Michael is buried under the
text: three-tiered cake, unable to see around it.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Do you guys want some cake?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Guys?
scene_heading: 115 INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT 115
text: In her crib Mary is sleeping. She's beautiful, she

scene_heading: 116 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 116
text: Mary is in her playpen, playing with a SQUEAKY rubber
text: giraffe.
text: The DOORBELL RINGS.
text: Peter opens it: standing there before him is a very,
text: very, young, gorgeous girl.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: (bursting with joy)
dialog: Hello... I'm Sylvia, Mary's
dialog: mother. I've come to get her...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (completely dazed)
dialog: Oh, it's you... Wait, I'll go
dialog: 117.
dialog: get Jack...
text: He stands there, frozen.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: How's Mary doing?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (as if he were
dialog: dreaming)
dialog: Fine, fine, she's doing great...
text: She's getting her back teeth
dialog: in lately, it's been a bit rough...
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Can I see her?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, yeah, sure, she's in there...
text: They both enter the living room. Mary stares at Sylvia.
text: When she spots Mary, Sylvia suddenly breaks down in tears.
text: Peter is dumbfounded.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: I don't believe how much she's
dialog: grown!
text: Recovering, wiping away her tears, she walks over to the
dialog: playpen.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Hello, Mary, hello my darling...
text: She picks her up, hugs her tightly, showers kisses on
text: her. MARY LAUGHS. Sylvia starts crying again.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: How beautiful she is... Her hair
dialog: has grown... Look how much she
dialog: changed, I missed it all. I
dialog: missed her so much!
text: Peter, in a kind of daze, stares at Sylvia. Without
text: looking at Peter, she dries her eyes and tries to stop
text: crying.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: I wanted to make life difficult
dialog: for Jack but I never thought I'd
dialog: miss her so much...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (still in a fog)
dialog: Oh, yeah... make life difficult
dialog: for Jack...
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Is he here?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Is Jack here?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (snapping out of it)
dialog: Oh, yeah, yeah, I'll go get him...
text: He exits like a sleepwalker and goes straight into
text: Michael's room. The latter is asleep.
text: Peter sits down on the edge of Michael's bed and gently
text: shakes him.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Michael, Michael... Sylvia's here.
text: Michael wakes up and looks at Peter.
speaker_heading: PETER
text: Mary's leaving.
scene_heading: 117 INT. KITCHEN - DAY 117
text: Peter's giving Mary her bottle, Jack is carefully putting
text: all her stuff into a bag -- bottles, nipples, cereals,
dialog: etc.
text: In the doorway Sylvia, with reddened eyes, silently
text: watches them.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Let's see, the five bottles,
dialog: the little bottles for water,
dialog: the strainer for her cereal...
dialog: (to Sylvia)
dialog: ... Do you have a blender?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: A blender?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: For bananas and carrots and stuff.
dialog: It's time for her to start eating
dialog: them...
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: No, I don't have a blender.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: 119.
dialog: Okay, you can have ours.
text: He stuffs the blender into the bag.
text: Mary has now finished her bottle.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: (to Peter)
dialog: Do you want me to take her?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, I have to burp her first.
text: With dexterity, he places Mary face down on his shoulder
text: and walks around in the kitchen, patting her on the back.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Sylvia)
dialog: Here, could you give these to
dialog: Michael so he can pack them
dialog: with the clothes?
text: He hands two bibs to Sylvia.
text: Sylvia walks through the apartment, and stops in front
text: of Michael's room, where she looks strangely at the
text: changing table with its mattress, its pretty sheet, and
text: the baby's toilet articles.
text: Sylvia enters the living room.
text: Michael has spread all of Mary's clothes, neatly folded
text: and ironed on the couch. He is packing them in a big
dialog: bag.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Here are the bibs. Jack told me
dialog: to give them...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (taking the bibs)
dialog: Thanks... I put the woolen things
text: on the bottom and the diapers
dialog: and lighter things on top,
dialog: because you'll need those first...
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: (her mind is
dialog: elsewhere)
dialog: Yeah, sure...
text: Michael bustles about. Sylvia's gaze comes to rest on
text: the crib which stands imposingly in the middle of the
text: living room. Music boxes, little booties and stuffed
text: animals are hanging from the bars, and a pretty white
text: tulle frames the crib.
dialog: 120.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You'll have to come back and
dialog: get the crib later.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Yeah...
scene_heading: 118 EXT. STREET - DAY 118
text: A taxi is there. Behind the wheel the driver sits
text: waiting. Sylvia is sitting in the back, on the side
text: nearest the sidewalk, and on her lap is Mary, whom
text: she's gently fondling.
text: On the sidewalk, beside the open trunk of the cab,
text: are all Mary's belongings: some bags, the playpen, a
text: stroller, the baby bathtub, the changing table, etc.
text: Peter is attempting to pack it all in the trunk. Michael
text: is handing the things to him.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (tense)
dialog: Give me the playpen first...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (equally tense)
dialog: Then where are you gonna put the
dialog: tub?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Just give me the playpen.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Need some help?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, no thanks... I'd rather do it
dialog: myself...
text: Jack is standing beside the back door of the cab, leaning
text: over toward Sylvia, who is holding Mary. He is trying
text: unsuccessfully to sound angry.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You really screwed us over but

speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: I know, I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Really. Our lives have been out
dialog: of control for the past six
dialog: months.
dialog: 121.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Yeah, I bet... Actually, that was
dialog: kind of the point... But I'm the
dialog: one who really got screwed...
text: She starts to cry again.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't cry, c'mon... you're taking
dialog: her back now, it's great...
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: (wiping her eyes)
dialog: Yeah, it's great...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: D'you have enough money? Can you
dialog: manage all right?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Yeah, sure... I'm not loaded, but
dialog: it's okay -- I'm working, I've
dialog: got modeling jobs lined up...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Do you have a boyfriend?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: No. That's the last thing I need.
dialog: I've got my work. And now I've
dialog: got her.
text: She rubs noses with Mary.
text: Peter and Michael approach.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That's it, we fit it all in...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay, then... well, 'bye...
text: The three men are lined up on the sidewalk. Mary stares
text: at them, looking a little lost. They wave their hands
dialog: and:
scene_heading: PETER, MICHAEL AND JACK
dialog: 'Bye, Mary!
text: MARY LAUGHS and waves.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
text: (with a big, sad
dialog: smile)
dialog: Okay, well, thanks again -- 'Bye!
scene_heading: PETER, MICHAEL AND JACK
dialog: 122.
dialog: 'Bye!

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (playfully)
dialog: Well, that's that!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Right... That's that.
text: They head back to their apartment building.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh shit -- I forgot to explain

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She'll figure it out by herself...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah, she'll manage...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Now it's back to the good life
dialog: for us!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Sleeping late! Different women
dialog: every night! I can't wait!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Forget about the New York-Washington
dialog: shuttle! I'm off to Caracas!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And I'm gonna be able to get back
dialog: to work, so Carl better watch it
dialog: -- I'm gonna slaughter that
dialog: son-of-a-bitch! First with this
dialog: goddam competition... and then
dialog: with Natalie.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And I've got six months' worth
dialog: of sex to catch up on with Cathy,
dialog: Nora, Frances, Susan, Barbra...
text: They have entered the elevator. The doors close. They
text: come out of the elevator, in front of their apartment.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: ...Christie, Paula, Sheila, Lisa,
dialog: Kimberly, Rhonda, Rebecca, Louisa...
dialog: 123.
dialog: But not necessarily in that order!
text: They enter the apartment and Peter walks on something
text: that lets out a TERRIBLE SQUEAK.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, she forgot her squeaky

text: He picks it up and throws it onto an armchair.
scene_heading: 119 EXT. LUXURY HOTEL - DAY 119
text: Jack takes a running jump and does a cannonball into

dialog: street.
scene_heading: 121 INT. ART GALLERY - DAY 121
text: Michael and Sophia are having a big discussion about
text: contemporary art in the midst of a sophisticated crowd
text: at an opening. Michael is vehement, gesturing wildly,
text: and so is Sophia. They're both talking at once, not
text: listening to each other, and enjoying it immensely.
scene_heading: 122 INT. OFFICE - DAY 122
text: Peter, all out of breath, comes rushing into the office
text: where Natalie works. She is very surprised. He puts
text: the flowers down on her desk.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: These are for you... I'm not
text: supposed to leave the office.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: They think I'm in the bathroom.
dialog: So I can't stay. 'Bye.
text: He dashes back out. Natalie cracks up, laughing.
scene_heading: 123 EXT. AIRPORT - DAY 123
text: Jack is running on the tarmac; he quickly mounts the
text: stairs to his plane as he waves a heartrending goodbye
text: to a young woman he's left behind in the airport. At
text: the top step, he bumps into another young woman: it's
dialog: 124.
dialog: love at first sight.
scene_heading: 124 INT. APARTMENT - DAY 124
text: Michael is in bed. It's noon, the sun's shining
text: brightly, and a BLONDE is asleep beside him. Michael
text: is on the phone.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Peter? Yeah? What? Yow-ee!
dialog: Hooray! Terrific! That's
dialog: fantastic! I'll call Jack --
dialog: We're gonna celebrate tonight!
text: He hangs up. The Blonde is now awake.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: Who won?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Peter. He won the competition!
speaker_heading: BLONDE

text: A bunch of crepe paper streamers are hanging in the hall,
text: as well as posters with various things written on them:
scene_heading: PETER'S #1! CONGRATULATIONS, PETER! HURRAY, HURRAY,
speaker_heading: HURRAY!
text: Jack comes running in with a bottle of champagne, he
text: POPS the CORK.
text: Jack hugs Peter tightly as Michael comes in with glasses
text: and tries to catch the champagne that's flowing all over.
text: They all shout and go bananas celebrating.
scene_heading: 126 INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT 126
text: Peter has his arm around Natalie's waist. She's a little
text: drunk. He kisses her and leads her into his room, clos-
text: ing the door behind him. Michael and Jack, who were
text: spying on them, tiptoe over to the door. They are
text: silently exulting over Peter's second victory.
scene_heading: 127 INT. LOBBY OF OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 127
dialog: 125.
text: Michael enters a fancy building on 5th Avenue. He's
text: carrying a big portfolio and is full of beans.
text: In the lobby, he pushes the button for the elevator and
text: looks around absentmindedly.
text: His gaze suddenly freezes on something.
text: By the guard's desk he notices a stroller. Inside, look-
text: ing pretty bored, is MARY. Michael is overwhelmed.
text: He walks toward Mary and through the sea of people --
text: they exchange an intense look.
text: He looks around and suddenly sees Sylvia and two men
text: deep in discussion coming out of an elevator. Michael,
text: startled, runs and hides behind one of the elevators,
text: staring out wide-eyed.
text: Sylvia is dressed in a very chic, tight black suit, with
text: a veiled little black hat and spiked heels. One of the
text: men is carrying a bunch of cameras. They walk out
text: toward the front door, and Sylvia suddenly stops. She
text: seems to have forgotten something. She kisses them
text: goodbye and heads toward the elevator. Once she's out
text: of their sight, she turns and waits for them to leave.
text: When they're gone for sure, she rushes toward Mary and
text: showers her with kisses.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Here you are, my angel... Are you
dialog: okay, honey? Mommy's finished
dialog: now, you've been a very, very
dialog: good girl.
dialog: (to Guard)
dialog: Thanks a lot for looking after
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Oh, she's been great!
text: She wheels the stroller over to the door and quickly
text: takes off her high heels, and her hat, and stuffs them
text: into a big bag. She takes out a pair of old shoes and
text: a comfortable jacket, and slips them on. She removes
text: the pins from her hair -- she looks like her normal self
dialog: again.
text: She leaves, pushing the stroller out the door.
text: Michael stands frozen.
scene_heading: 128 INT. HOTEL - NIGHT 128
text: Jack, in the corridor of a large modern hotel somewhere
dialog: 126.
text: in the world. He is full of energy and playful excite-
text: ment. He's with a few of his colleagues, both men and
text: women. They say good night to each other.
text: Everyone goes into his or her own room.
text: Jack's the last one, he goes into his room alone. His
text: smile drops. For a moment he stands there just looking.
text: He sits down on the bed: on the pillow is a little
text: chocolate Santa Claus with a card that reads "Merry
text: Christmas. The Marriott Hotels." Jack contemplates
text: it forlornly.
scene_heading: 129 INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - NIGHT 129
text: Michael and Sophia, both in kimonos, are sitting in
text: front of the last bits of an elegant midnight supper,
text: in Michael's room. The bed in unmade.
text: Sophia, a glass of champagne in her hand, is yakking
text: away nonstop, like a real motor-mouth.
text: Michael, silent, is doodling on a paper napkin.
text: His pen is making little squares and circles; the circles
text: come together and start looking like a baby lying in a
dialog: crib.
text: Sophia is absorbed in her monologue.
text: Suddenly Michael realizes what he has drawn. He crumples
text: the napkin and throws it in the wastebasket. Sophia
text: hasn't noticed anything. Michael is bored stiff.
scene_heading: 130 INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT 130
text: Peter comes home with Natalie. They take off their
text: coats. They look tired.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: (in a bad mood)
dialog: Oh, my feet are killing me!
text: She takes off her shoes and collapses in the armchair in
text: the hall. There is a LOUD SQUEAKING noise.
text: She reaches underneath her and brings out a rubber
text: giraffe.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: What the hell is this? Oh, it's
dialog: a giraffe...
dialog: (tosses it away
dialog: and walks off)
dialog: ... Oh, by the way, have you
dialog: 127.
dialog: heard anything about that kid,
dialog: you know, the one you had here
dialog: for a while?
text: Peter stares at the giraffe, horrified. He feels the
text: tears coming to his eyes. Grabbing the giraffe, he
text: hurls it with all his might against the wall.
scene_heading: 131 INT. PLANE - DAY 131
text: Jack's in his plane, at the controls, waiting for
text: takeoff. He's daydreaming. His CO-PILOT comes in and
text: joins him.
speaker_heading: CO-PILOT
dialog: Hey, what's the matter with you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Whadda you mean, what's the matter
dialog: with me?
speaker_heading: CO-PILOT
dialog: Are you sick?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Me? No. I'm fine.
speaker_heading: CO-PILOT
dialog: C'mon, Jack! Didn't you see

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sure I did, why?
speaker_heading: CO-PILOT
dialog: Well... look...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (turning around
dialog: to look)
dialog: So it's the Rockettes, so what?
speaker_heading: CO-PILOT
dialog: And you're just sitting there
dialog: like that?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Whaddaya mean, sitting there?
dialog: I happen to be getting ready to
dialog: fly this airplane.
speaker_heading: CO-PILOT
dialog: Okay, forget it.
scene_heading: 132 INT. APARTMENT - DAY 132
dialog: 128.
text: Jack, alone in his room, with his back to us, is facing
text: his full-length mirror.
text: He's looking at himself, with one fist on his hip and
text: the other hand clutching a half-empty bottle of scotch.
text: He observes himself and slowly turns around -- we can
text: now see him in profile. His hair is disheveled, he's
text: unshaven, and he's put a pillow underneath his sweater.
text: He's pregnant. He takes a big swig of scotch. The
text: DOORBELL RINGS. Jack walks away from the mirror. He
text: staggers dead drunk. But dignified, pregnant.
text: Jack opens the door. Standing there is Graton holding
text: a stuffed animal, a rabbit.
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: Hi...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (out of it)
dialog: Hi?
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: Don't you recognize me?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (in a total fog)
dialog: Wait... uh, no...
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: I'm the one who was tailing you...
dialog: Remember, in the park...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, yeah, the park... the diaper
dialog: and all...
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: That's it, the diaper... But
dialog: don't worry. This isn't an
dialog: investigation, I left the force
dialog: four months ago, and anyway,
dialog: they've arrested the whole gang
dialog: since then... I just wanted to
dialog: ask you something...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Have you noticed? I'm pregnant.
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: (neutrally)
dialog: Oh yeah, I see...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So, shall we go for a walk?
dialog: 129.
scene_heading: 133 EXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY 133
text: Graton and Jack are sitting on a bench beside the East
text: River. Jack, still pregnant, has brought along his
text: bottle of scotch, and he takes a swig from it occasion-
text: ally. Graton has brought along his rabbit.
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: There's something I have to know...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Wouldn't you like to be pregnant?
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: What? Oh sure... maybe... no...
dialog: I dunno... Look, there's been
dialog: something bothering me for a long
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You see, if I was God, and I could
dialog: create the world all over again,
dialog: here's what I would do: I would
dialog: create Adam from Eve's rib, not
dialog: the other way around.
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: (having trouble
dialog: following)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: GRATON (CONT'D)
dialog: That's an interesting idea...
dialog: Actually, I just wanted to ask
dialog: you...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: At least that way things would
dialog: have been clearer to begin with,
dialog: y'see. They wouldn't have made
dialog: us believe that somebody could
dialog: come out of our rib, y'know?
dialog: 'Cause nothing ever comes out
dialog: of our rib, y'know? Ever. Only
dialog: out of our prick, and even then
dialog: ... Everything still has to be
dialog: done after that.
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: (very unsure)
dialog: That's for sure...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What we men know how to make is
text: planes, buildings, cars, and all
dialog: that stuff... It's useful, mind
dialog: 130.
dialog: you...
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: It's driving me crazy! This thing
text: keeps going around and around in
dialog: my head...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And you know what, it's not even
dialog: like they wanted us to believe
dialog: it -- it might have been us who
dialog: wanted to believe it... But let's
dialog: face it, nobody comes out of our
dialog: rib...
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: (dives right in)
dialog: Was the dope in the diaper, yes
dialog: or no?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Still, that's hard to take, goddam
dialog: it!
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: Was it in the diaper, or not?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The dope? It was in the diaper,
dialog: why?
speaker_heading: GRATON
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: Oh, thanks a lot. I feel so much
dialog: better now. Here, this is a rabbit
dialog: for your baby.
dialog: (shakes both Jack's
dialog: hands)
dialog: Thanks again, 'bye, I'm so happy.
text: Graton goes off, floating on cloud nine.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (reaching out
dialog: toward him
dialog: with the rabbit)
dialog: But wait -- the baby's gone...
scene_heading: 134 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 134
text: Jack and Michael, slumped in their chairs, are having
text: breakfast. It's a gray day. It's POURING out.
text: Peter, bending over a bowl of steaming water, with a
text: towel over his head, is inhaling the steam. When he
text: looks up to speak, we see his swollen tear-streaked
dialog: 131.
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (extremely, in
dialog: fact, too playful)
dialog: Tomorrow, San Francisco!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (grim)
dialog: Say hello to the Pacific for me.
speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (very hostile)
dialog: Before what?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (putting his head
dialog: back over the
dialog: bowl)
dialog: How would I dow? 'Before,'
dialog: that's all.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (on edge)

scene_heading: 135 INT. SYLVIA'S STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT 135
text: Jack, holding a bouquet of flowers and Graton's rabbit,
text: rings the doorbell of an apartment. On the door a card
text: reads "SYLVIA AND MARY."
text: A chubby YOUNG MAN with thick glasses opens the door.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hi. Is Sylvia in?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: No, she'll be back in a couple
dialog: of hours -- around midnight, she

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Wanna come in and wait for her?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sure... Why not?
dialog: 133.
text: He follows the Young Man in Sylvia's studio. It's very
text: messy. On the table there's a big heap of books and
text: papers. Mary, sitting on the floor, is wearing a diaper
text: and a sweater, but her legs are bare. She's playing
text: with an empty pack of cigarettes. She looks at Jack
text: with a serious, unruffled expression.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sylvia doing okay?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: I don't know -- I'm a med student.
dialog: I'm just babysitting. I only met
dialog: her a couple hours ago.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, I see...
text: Silence. The Young Man sits down at the table and
text: immerses himself in his books.
text: Mary doesn't look up from her pack of cigarettes anymore.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Listen, on second thought, I
dialog: don't think I'll wait for her.
dialog: Just give her this when she gets
dialog: back, okay? And this is for the
dialog: baby.
text: Jack hands the bouquet and the rabbit to the Young Man,
text: who plops them down on a chair.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Sure, no problem.
text: He immerses himself again in his books.
text: Jack heads toward the door, then turns around.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Shouldn't the baby be in bed by
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Yeah... I don't know... When I
dialog: put her to bed she cries so I
dialog: just let her stay up...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't you have any tights to put
dialog: on her legs?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Tights?... Well, it's pretty hot
dialog: in here anyway...
dialog: 134.
text: Jack gets out of there in a hurry.
scene_heading: 136 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 136

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: But you've got to let them know!
speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: C'mon, I'll call you a cab, you've

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll be a dishwasher, I'll live
text: in a flophouse.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What the hell happened?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm not going, I told you; I'm
dialog: not going ever again. I'm sick
dialog: and tired of traveling, sick and
dialog: tired of broads. They all have
dialog: the same asses and I can't seem
dialog: to love them anyway. I can't
dialog: take another hotel room, and
dialog: swimming pools and trendy
dialog: restaurants! I want to know
dialog: 135.

text: Michael has no answer to these questions. He leaves.
scene_heading: 137 INT. APARTMENT - EVENING 137
text: Michael, wearing an apron and holding a wooden spoon,

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Come on, I made us a good dinner.
dialog: I bought some filet mignon and
dialog: Haagen-Dazs butter pecan. When

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: He has? I didn't hear him...
speaker_heading: JACK
text: He's in his room.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What?
text: Michael heads towards Peter's room. Jack feebly gets

text: Michael knocks on the door. No answer.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Peter! Dinner's ready!
text: Still no answer. Michael opens the door: Peter's lying
text: face-down on his bed.
text: He's holding the rubber giraffe and sobbing. Michael
text: and Jack, dismayed, stare at him. Peter hides his face
text: in his arm.
text: Jack and Michael go to the kitchen and sit down to their

scene_heading: 138 INT. APARTMENT - MORNING 138
text: The DOORBELL RINGS. A bare-chested Michael, in jeans,

text: Sylvia is a disheveled mess.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: SYLVIA

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Well, you can imagine how much

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, of course, 'cause after

speaker_heading: SYLVIA

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: SYLVIA

speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Oh, so the flowers and the

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: SYLVIA

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah, tell me about it! Finding

dialog: taking good care of her...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Of course you're taking good
dialog: care of her -- we know what it's
dialog: like, don't cry, she looks great...
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: (sobbing)
dialog: It's just 'cause I haven't slept
dialog: in four nights -- she must be
dialog: teething or something, I don't
dialog: know but I can't manage...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Don't worry, it's nothing, she's
dialog: 138.
dialog: cutting a tooth -- you just have
dialog: to put some stuff on her gums...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: She pulled the same thing on us.
dialog: We lost all our friends in one
dialog: night -- on account of one tooth!
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: And just look at my face!
dialog: Nobody's going to want me to
dialog: model for them with the way my
dialog: face looks... And what'll happen
dialog: to me if they don't want me
dialog: anymore?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: But you're beautiful -- At your
dialog: age all you need is a good night's
dialog: sleep and you'll look like new.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Right, a good night's sleep --
dialog: but when?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, why don't you leave the
dialog: baby with us for a few days,
dialog: till you recuperate... I mean,
dialog: if you want.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: We're old pros -- it's not a
dialog: big deal for us...
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: (blowing her nose,
dialog: wiping her eyes)
dialog: Really? I can leave her with
dialog: you for a little while?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Of course. Leave her with us.
dialog: Come back whenever you want.
dialog: Get some rest.
text: Sylvia, between two sobs, picks up a big bag beside her
text: on the doorstep.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: I brought a couple of things
dialog: for her, just for a few days...
text: Michael eagerly takes the bag from her. It's followed by
text: a second, and then a third.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: 139.
dialog: (taking Mary
dialog: in his arms)
dialog: Is she hungry?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Yeah, it's time for her bottle
dialog: -- it's all ready in the bag...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll go heat up some water right
dialog: away. Would you like a cup of
dialog: coffee?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Oh, okay, thanks...
text: Peter, carrying Mary towards the kitchen, is followed by
text: Jack and Michael with the bags.
text: Sylvia blows her nose and walks around aimlessly in the
dialog: hall.
text: In the kitchen the three men bustle about with the bags,
text: the bottle, the saucepan... They've swallowed all their
text: pride and are kissing Mary all over, on her neck, her
text: hands, her tummy. They're deliriously happy. Michael
text: takes some sheets out of the bag.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'll go make up her bed!
text: He exits, and, once in the corridor, prances around,
text: leaping and dancing... He gets to the living room and
text: goes over to the crib: suddenly, he recoils and freezes,
text: a fearful expression on his face. Then he turns and
text: races back to the kitchen.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (floored)
dialog: Hey, you guys -- come and see,
dialog: come and see!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Come see, I said.
text: Jack and Peter nervously follow Michael into the living
text: room. They stop short in front of the crib: There is
text: Sylvia, curled up in a fetal position, sucking her thumb
text: and sleeping like an angel.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The poor thing, she's really
dialog: wiped out.
dialog: 140.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She'll need two or three months
dialog: to recover, at least... Maybe
dialog: more!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We could set up a room for her
dialog: here...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: A room for her and a room for
dialog: Mary...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Then we could have four shifts
dialog: instead of three!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, but I don't think she'll
dialog: agree. She's got her own life
dialog: to live.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah, she probably wouldn't want
dialog: to move here. She'd think we'd
dialog: jump on her any chance we could...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: But we'd make a rule, she'd just
dialog: be 'one of the guys!'
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: She'll never want to...
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: (very awake)
dialog: So, I'll take the ten A.M. to three
dialog: P.M. shift... And I'll take every
dialog: other night... plus the walk in
dialog: the park in the afternoon before I
dialog: go to work... and we split the
dialog: rent equally... and I'll just be
dialog: 'one of the guys'... deal?
scene_heading: PETER, MICHAEL, AND JACK
dialog: (smiling broadly)
dialog: Deal.
text: Mary suddenly comes in from the kitchen, walking unstead-
text: ily but determinedly. She's dragging Graton's rabbit by
text: its ear. She looks at the four of them and laughs her
text: head off.
speaker_heading: FREEZE FRAME.
dialog: END!
dialog:
