speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PLAYGROUND - FRANKLIN PARK - BOSTON - EVENING
text: Nestled at the edge of 64.8 acres of rugged woodland. KIDS
text: play on rope swings, timber slides and rugged wooden see-
text: saws. MOTHERS and NANNIES sit and talk together on benches.
text: A young man, CECIL ACKERMAN, 24, pale skin, red hair, is
text: watching from beyond the playground fence. His eyes follow
text: the little girls, some of them no more than 6 years old, as
text: they swing to and fro.
text: He sees a small girl, EMMA, 7, toss a ball. It goes through
text: the fence and rolls out onto the path. Emma looks to her
text: NANNY, 19, but she is deep in conversation. Emma slips
text: through a gap in the fence and goes after the ball. As she
text: bends to pick it up, she clumsily kicks it. The ball rolls
text: away down a sloping path into the woods and Emma goes after
dialog: it...
text: Cecil looks at the Nanny. At the other Mothers. Nobody has
text: noticed Emma’s absence. Cecil pushes back from the fence and
text: casually walks away.
scene_heading: EXT. FRANKLIN PARK —- EVENING
text: Emma's ball bounces off the path and into the bushes. Emma
text: follows it. Pushing though the foliage. She sees her ball
dialog: and --
text: Cecil picks it up. Emma looks up at him. He smiles.
speaker_heading: CECIL
dialog: Is this your ball?
text: Emma takes a small step back. Nods.
speaker_heading: CECIL (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s your name?
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Emma.
speaker_heading: CECIL
dialog: Emma. That’s a pretty name.
text: Cecil holds the ball out to her...
speaker_heading: CECIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t be afraid. Here. Come and
dialog: take it.
text: Emma takes a small step forward. She reaches for the ball.
dialog: Doesn't fully commit...
speaker_heading: CECIL (CONT'D)
dialog: I won’t bite, Emma.
text: Emma takes another step toward him and AN OUT OF FOCUS FIGURE
text: appears behind Cecil. A HAMMER (wrapped in plastic) rises
dialog: above him and --
scene_heading: EXT. CHILDREN’S PLAYGROUND - FRANKLIN PARK - EVENING
text: Emma's SCREAM alerts the Mothers and Nannies. All bolt up.
text: Looking around. We FOCUS on Emma’s Nanny. Scanning the
dialog: children...
speaker_heading: NANNY
dialog: Emma! Where’s Emma?!
text: Another SCREAM and Nanny vaults the fence and runs down the
text: sloping path.
speaker_heading: NANNY (CONT'D)
dialog: EMMA! !
scene_heading: EXT. FRANKLIN PARK —- EVENING
text: Nanny bursts through the bushes and finds --
text: Emma just standing there. Unhurt. She has tears streaming
text: down her face. Cecil is gone. Nanny drops to her knees and
text: envelops the sobbing child as -- in the woods somewhere we
text: HEAR a vehicle engine starting. Emma looks at the ball
text: settling on the ground. A single drop of blood rolls down
dialog: its plastic surface...

scene_heading: EXT. BOSTON MUNICIPAL COURTHOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Establishing shot of the surprisingly warm looking brick
dialog: building.
speaker_heading: MITCH’S VOICE
dialog: The defense would have you believe
dialog: that circumstance is what put the
dialog: accused in this court today.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM — COURTROOM - DAY
dialog: (A.D.A.) Assistant District Attorney MITCH BRODY, mid 30s,
dialog: stands before the Jury. He’s Boston born and raised but he’s
text: softened the accent. There’s a slight scrappy edge to him.
dialog: A fighter.
text: JUDGE McKENNA, 60s, a stern looking woman, presides.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Honesty or, in the defendant's
dialog: case, a lack of honesty - that’s
dialog: why we're here today. Call it
dialog: character. Call it backbone. Call
dialog: it common decency. Everyone has a
dialog: choice.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Lack of education opportunities, a
dialog: broken home, low employment rates
dialog: are nothing but excuses to hide
dialog: behind when you're deciding who you
dialog: want to be in this world.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Neither fate, nor society, put
text: Francis Mulligan inside the house
dialog: of Gloria Mitchell on the night of
dialog: the fifteenth. Neither fate, nor
dialog: society, told him to tie her up -
text: shove a gun in her face - and take
dialog: her belongings. That was his
dialog: choice.
text: Mitch looks at MULLIGAN, 25, Irish tats up each arm.
text: Mulligan stares back with total disrespect.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: The defense would have you walk in
dialog: his client’s shoes. Well I have.
dialog: I’m from Dorchester.
dialog: (this gets people's
dialog: attention)
dialog: It’s a shit hole. Nobody’s saying
dialog: it’s not. But that’s where I’m
dialog: from - not who I am.
dialog: 
text: Mulligan looks down. Confronted by an alternate life.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: He’s not the victim here. So, if
dialog: you're going to put yourself in
dialog: anyone’s shoes - put yourself in
dialog: Gloria Mitchell’s.
text: Mitch walks back to his seat and sits beside fellow A.D.A.
dialog: STUART KEMP, early 30s, doughy, not what you would call
dialog: handsome.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Nice close, DeNiro.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You like that?
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Not who I am? It was golden.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MCKENNA
dialog: The jury will adjourn to deliberate
dialog: a verdict.
text: Mitch, Stuart and the defense settle into their chairs to
text: wait. A defense attorney leaves to take a call...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You got any snacks? I missed
dialog: breakfast. Rachel’s on total bed
dialog: rest for the last few days.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: I told you, I’m on a diet.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You're telling me you don’t have
text: one chocolate bar hidden in there.
text: Mitch grabs Stuart’s briefcase and digs. Finds a Snickers
text: bar. Grins “ah-ha!”. Stuart looks busted.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: That's for emergencies. In case my
text: blood sugar drops.
text: Mitch’s phone buzzes. Reads: “IT’S TIME!”
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: It’s time. Oh, shit. I gotta go.
text: Mitch puts down the Snicker’s bar and starts to stuff papers
dialog: into his case...
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: But the jury’s still out.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: It’s a guilty verdict. Five years.
text: Parole after two.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: One - Judge McKenna’s soft on the
dialog: educationally challenged and nobody
dialog: got shot.
dialog: Mitch picks up his case --
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: And two?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (smiles--)
dialog: I don’t lose.
dialog: (to Judge McKenna --)
dialog: I’m sorry about this, your honor.
dialog: I’m going to have to leave my
dialog: esteemed associate to finish up.
dialog: My wife just went into labor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MCKENNA
dialog: Congratulations, counselor. You're
dialog: free to go.
text: Mitch turns to walk away -- then reaches back and snatches up
text: the Snicker’s bar.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: It’s an emergency.
text: Mitch hurries down the aisle toward the rear doors...
scene_heading: EXT. MITCH'S STREET / HOUSE - DAY
text: Mitch’s Escalade zooms into the tree-lined, suburban street.
text: Kids skateboard and play ball. He turns up the driveway of a
text: pretty, but modest, two-story starter-home.
scene_heading: INT. STUDY —- MITCH’S HOUSE - DAY
text: A PHOTOGRAPH OF A SIX YEAR OLD MITCH AND HIS MA’ (on the back
text: wooden steps of a run-down house in Popes Hill) dominates the
text: shot. It’s oddly framed (they’re both too close to one edge)
text: like we're only seeing half a picture. It sits on a desk
text: with other photos of Mitch and his wife. Through the window
text: we see Mitch’s car approach the garage. There is a groaning
text: CLUNK that shakes the house as the garage starts to open.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM — DAY
text: RACHEL BRODY, 29, crushes Mitch’s hand as she pushes. The
text: MIDWIFE, late 50s, heavy German accent, urges her on. Sparse
text: medical equipment needed for a home birth stands beside the
dialog: bed.
speaker_heading: MIDWIFE
text: The baby is crowning. I can see
text: the head. Keep pushing.
text: Mitch kisses Rachel’s head...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You're doing great.
dialog: Breath. Push....
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, push.
text: Rachel crushes his hand...
speaker_heading: MIDWIFE
text: I can see the shoulders. One more
dialog: push.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I can’t.
speaker_heading: MIDWIFE
dialog: One more.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You can do it.
text: Rachel strains with all of her might, lets out a pained gasp
text: and - the baby girl is out.
text: Midwife clears her nose and mouth and then wraps the baby in
text: a blanket and hands her up to Rachel.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: You did it. Oh, my God, I can’t
dialog: believe it.
text: Rachel holds her. Tears in her eyes...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Hello, baby girl.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Let me take a picture.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No, I’m a mess.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What are you talking about? You
dialog: look beautiful.
text: Mitch kisses her. Pulls out his iPhone and fires up the
text: screen. He sees a text: “GUILTY. FIVE YEARS. I HATE YOU.”
text: Mitch smiles.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (to baby)
dialog: I think clever daddy just won
dialog: another case.
text: Joe aims the iPhone at Rachel and the baby...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Smile.
text: Rachel smiles. Click. Mitch likes the photo...
speaker_heading: MIDWIFE
dialog: Mr. Brody, would you like to cut
dialog: the cord?
text: Midwife holds a pair of scissors out to Mitch. Mitch
text: hesitates. Rachel laughs at his expression..
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - BRODY HOUSE - DAY
text: Mitch is at the work-bench. He has a beer open. He’s
text: assembling the first pieces of A BABY CRIB. He has a wall of
text: tools in front of him, each piece hanging on a hook. He
text: takes down a screwdriver and we see there is a silhouette of
text: it drawn on the wall. A place for everything.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BOARDROOM —- DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE -— DAY
dialog: 
text: Mitch, Stuart and the rest of the DA’s staff are crowded
text: inside. All toast Mitch with a glass of champagne.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A ROW OF SHOT GLASSES ARE SLOPPILY FILLED WITH TEQUILA.
scene_heading: INT. THE PAXTON TAP - NIGHT
text: Limes are jammed on the edges and the tray is lifted and
text: carried through the crowds. Sports play on flat-screens.
text: Music pounds. The tray is put down on --
speaker_heading: A CORNER TABLE
text: where Mitch is wearing an oversized pin that reads “Baby
text: Daddy!” and is sitting with FRANK, STUART, and JOE.
dialog: Great friends who all went to law school together. Empty
text: beer and shot glasses litter the table.
speaker_heading: STUART
text: Another toast.
text: STUART picks up a Tequila shot. The others follow suit...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I’m pretty toasted already.
text: Stuart raises Mitch’s hand anyway...
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: To the bastard who has it all. A
dialog: beautiful wife, a great career --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Awesome friends.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: And now a perfect little girl.
text: Mitch lets this soak in. He does have a good life.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: To me.
text: They shoot the drinks...
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - THE PAXTON TAP - NIGHT
text: Mitch is at the urinal. Swaying. Singing to himself. He
text: washes his hands at the sink. His phone rings. Mitch wipes
text: his hands and answers it.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: RECORDED VOICE (0.S.)
text: This is a collect call from an
dialog: inmate at Concord Penitentiary. To
dialog: accept this call press one.
text: Mitch’s demeanor sobers. He clearly knows who it is. The

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey, Baby daddy. You okay?
text: Frank approaches the urinal...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Not going to hurl are you? Stu’
dialog: just got another round.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Bring it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE PAXTON TAP — NIGHT
text: The streets are quiet. A light rain falls. Mitch, Frank,
text: Joe and Stuart stagger out of the bar laughing. Frank claps
text: Mitch on the back.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I hope you’re not driving,
dialog: counselor.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Got the cab number right here.
text: Mitch shows his iPhone. Frank hugs him...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Be well, man. Give Rachel our best
dialog: and let us know when we can come

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Will do.

speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: See you at the office.

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Congrat’s again, man. Can’t wait
dialog: to meet her.
text: Frank, Joe and Stuart walk away talking and laughing.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: And don’t think I’ve forgotten you
dialog: owe me a Snicker’s bar.
text: Mitch dials a cab. Then sees A PAIR OF GUYS admiring his
text: parked Escalade. One of the Guys looks in the window.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (can’t believe these guys)
dialog: What the -- ?
text: Mitch looks around. Frank, Stuart and Joe vanish around the
dialog: corner.
speaker_heading: TELEPHONE VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Harvard Cabs.
text: Mitch kills the call and walks toward his Escalade.
dialog: Fearless. You can take the kid out of Dorchester, but you
dialog: can’t take Dorchester out of the kid.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Hey.
text: He zaps his keys. The Escalade’s lights flash.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: I help you guys with something?
text: The Guys see Mitch and walk away. Mitch stands firm by his
text: car. Keys in one hand, phone in the other. What to do? He
text: sees the Guys hanging at the street corner. Waiting.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Screw this.
text: Mitch opens the door and climbs in. Fires the engine.
text: Thunder rumbles in the night sky as he drives away...
scene_heading: INT. MITCH'S ESCALADE (MOVING) - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Rain falls on the windshield. Mitch tuns on the wipers. He
text: sees a COP CAR sitting at an intersection. Mitch drives past
text: on a green light. Doesn’t look at them.
text: He lifts the center arm rest and pulls out a tin of mints.
text: Pops a few in his mouth. Glances in the mirror as the lights
dialog: change behind him and --
text: The Cop Car drives straight across the intersection and
text: vanishes from sight.
text: Mitch breathes a sigh of relief. Turns his attention back to
dialog: the road and --
text: BOOM! The Escalade hits a YOUNG MAN!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: INT/EXT. MITCH’S ESCALADE - A SERIES OF SHOTS

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: No, no, no, no....
text: Mitch stabs the seat-belt release and pushes open the door.
text: Mitch staggers out into the rain and sees the crumpled mess
text: of a body lying fifteen feet behind the Escalade.
text: Mitch runs to the Young Man.
scene_heading: EXT. DARBY STREET - NIGHT
text: Mitch skids to a stop. Rain falls on the bloody body. Leg
text: twisted at an impossible angle. Arms broken. Young Man
text: blinks up at Mitch in the rain. Blood bubbling on his pale
text: lips. Oil and blood matting his red hair.
text: We recognize him from the opening park - CECIL ACKERMAN.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Oh, Jesus. I’m sorry. I’m so
dialog: sorry.
text: Mitch takes off his jacket and lays it over Cecil’s coatless

speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t move. I’m going to call an
dialog: ambulance.
text: Mitch runs back to the Escalade...

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PAYPHONE - DARBY STREET -— NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. DARBY STREET - NIGHT
text: Mitch runs back to Cecil.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: They're coming. You just hang on,

speaker_heading: CECIL

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Help is on its way. You’re going

dialog: 13.
text: Mitch HEARS a_ sharp, metallic SNAP from a side alley and
text: stares into the darkness.
dialog: Is somebody there?
text: Rain drums but nothing else moves.
text: Finally, in the distance, Mitch HEARS the faint howl of an
text: ambulance siren.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: You hear that? They’re coming. I
dialog: have to go now.
text: Mitch grabs his jacket, but Cecil clings to it with his one

speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: I can’t stay.
text: Mitch unpicks Cecil’s fingers from the now bloody jacket...
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: I have a family. I can’t be
dialog: involved. I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: CECIL
dialog: Please...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: Mitch pulls his jacket free and business cards fall out.
text: Mitch quickly scrapes them out of the blood and rain. Cecil
text: stares at him.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: You're going to be okay.
text: Mitch turns away. Runs back to his Escalade...
scene_heading: INT. MITCH’S ESCALADE - NIGHT
text: Mitch climbs in and slams the door. Puts his hand on the

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I’m so sorry.
dialog: Jams it into drive...
dialog: 14.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: With a spin of tires, the Escalade zooms forward and hangs a
text: hard right out of the street. All is quiet save for the

text: with the rain. Fear in his eyes...
scene_heading: INT. MITCH'S ESCALADE (MOVING) - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Streetlights whip hypnotic stripes across Mitch’s face. He

text: Opens the door. Vomits.
scene_heading: INT. 24HR CARWASH - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. GARAGE —- THE BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Mitch parks the Escalade next to Rachel’s Prius and climbs
text: out. The automatic garage door closes with a whir and a
text: clunk. Mitch climbs out, shoves his coat into a garbage bag,
text: kicks off his shoes and throws them in, too. He then
text: unbuckles his pants and removes his shirt. He looks at the
dialog: washer and dryer in the room. Decides against it...
scene_heading: EXT. PATIO —- THE BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Mitch carries the bag of clothes to the BBQ and removes the

scene_heading: INT. BABY ROOM —- THE BRODY HOUSE - MORNING

speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: MITCH

speaker_heading: RACHEL

text: Secretary watches him walk toward the conference room.
speaker_heading: WITH MITCH
text: as he walks toward the conference room. He takes a bottle of
text: Tylenol from his pocket. Stuart falls in beside him,
dialog: drinking coffee...
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: How’s the head?
text: Mitch gives him a “not good” look.
speaker_heading: STUART (CONT'D)
dialog: Man, I am so off Tequila.
dialog: 19.
text: Mitch stops at the water fountain. Stuart walks on. Mitch
text: drinks the water and swallows the Tylenol. As he wipes his
dialog: mouth he sees --
scene_heading: A PAIR OF UNIFORM COPS
text: standing at reception. The RECEPTIONIST points toward Mitch.
text: The COPS walk toward him.
text: Mitch is riveted to the spot.
text: The Cops approach, in seeming slow motion, removing their
dialog: peaked caps and --
text: Mitch turns away. Walks into a Secretary carrying a tray of
dialog: coffee.
text: Behind Mitch, the Cops are greeted by a different A.D.A.
text: They walk into his office...
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM —- DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE — MORNING
dialog: 
text: Mitch runs water on a hand towel and dabs at the coffee on
text: his shirt and tie. Takes a long, deep, calming breath.
scene_heading: INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE — MORNING
dialog: 
text: Mitch walks toward his office. Glances at the Cops talking
text: to the A.D.A. in his office. Nobody pays Mitch any
dialog: attention. He really can breathe easy.
text: Before Mitch enters his own office, Secretary looks up from
dialog: her work...
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: I called everywhere and none of
dialog: them admitted a hit and run last
dialog: night. You want me to call outside
dialog: the city?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: No. Thanks.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Oh, and somebody named Doyle
dialog: called. Wouldn’t leave his last
dialog: name.
text: Mitch stops. The name means something to him...
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY (CONT’D)
dialog: He said to tell you he’s “out” and
dialog: wants to see you. He left a
dialog: contact number.
text: Mitch takes the post-it from her.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY (CONT’D)
dialog: You want me to get him on the phone
dialog: for you?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: No. I got it.
text: Mitch goes into his office. Closes the door.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. KERRY’S CAFE - DAY
text: An overweight DELIVERY DRIVER gets into his Fed-EX truck and
text: drives away. Mitch is sitting in a window seat of Kerry's
text: Cafe. Grease and caffeine are all they sell...
scene_heading: INT. KERRY’S CAFE — DAY
text: Mitch sips a coffee and looks at DOYLE LOGAN, 30s, cropped
text: hair, tattoo poking above the collar of his sweater, sitting
text: opposite. Doyle chomps on a bacon sandwich. Moans with
dialog: delight.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Bacon. I tell you, man, it’s the
dialog: simple things you miss.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: So, how’ve you been?
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: (smiles; mouth full)
dialog: How’ve I been? You mean apart from
dialog: dating a guy called Bubba for most
dialog: of the last decade and having
dialog: “enter here” tattooed on my ass-—
dialog: cheeks?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I'm kidding, bro. I’m good. Never
dialog: better.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Are you clean?
speaker_heading: DOYLE
text: Straight to the point. Eight
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Listen...
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: (knows what he’s going to
dialog: say--)
dialog: Don’t sweat it. I wouldn’t have
dialog: come to see your ass either.
text: Mitch breathes -- been let off the hook --
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: I got your card when da’ died,
dialog: though. That was nice.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: He was a good man.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: He was a drunken ass.
text: Mitch laughs and nods. Doyle sees Mitch’s wedding band...
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: You got hitched.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Any kids?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: One. Ella.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: After your ma’.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: How old?
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (checks his watch)
dialog: Two days, seven hours and thirteen
dialog: minutes.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
text: A newbie. Congratulations, pops.
dialog: You got a picture?
text: Mitch slides his iPhone across to Doyle. Rachel and Ella are
text: the screen-saver image.
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice. And the baby’s cute, too.
text: Mitch takes the phone back...
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: You’ve done real good for yourself,
dialog: Mitch. I almost shit a brick when
dialog: my parole officer said you worked
dialog: for the D.A.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: It’s early days.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Don’t do that. You made something
dialog: of yourself. Be proud.
text: Doyle raises his coffee cup in toast and sips...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Where are you staying?
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Why, you offering?
dialog: (beat; cracks a smile)
dialog: They've got me crashing in some
dialog: halfway house. It’s part of my
dialog: reintegration program. You know -
dialog: help me back into society.
text: He digs through his pocket. Pulls out a scrap of paper...
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Here it is. Cardiff Street. I
dialog: wrote it down for you.
text: Mitch takes the paper...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: How is it?
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Four walls and a roof. Anything's
dialog: better than Popes Hill or the pen,
dialog: you know what I’m saying?
text: Doyle raises his cup and gestures for a refill.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: How are you fixed for money?
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: They've set me up with a couple of
dialog: interviews. I didn’t call to hit
dialog: you up or nothing.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: That’s good because between student
dialog: loans, mortgage payments and a new
dialog: baby, I ain’t got shit.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Maybe I could spot you some. I’ve
dialog: got a little stashed away. The bit
dialog: da’ left me. Your ma’s government
dialog: bonds.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: She wanted you to have them.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Christ, it’s good to see you,
dialog: Mitch. It really is. You look
dialog: great.
text: Mitch smiles then sees the face of CECIL ACKERMAN appear on
text: the TV. He looks fresh faced and happy, but it’s definitely
text: him. Cecil’s photo is replaced by a MALE REPORTER outside a
dialog: Boston Police Station.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (to Waitress)
dialog: Excuse me. Could you turn that up?
text: Doyle looks from the TV back to Mitch.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: What is it? What’s going on?
text: Waitress turns the sound up.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: What started out as a routine
dialog: traffic stop last night turned into
text: a gruesome murder investigation
dialog: when Boston PD Officers stopped
dialog: this white van...
text: We see a WHITE VAN through the chain-link fence.
speaker_heading: REPORTER (CONT’D)
dialog: (uninterrupted)
dialog: ..-parked here behind me in the
dialog: police impound - for nothing more
text: than a broken tail light.
text: Camera comes back to Reporter...
speaker_heading: REPORTER (CONT’D)
text: When officers, climbing from their
text: vehicle, saw blood dripping from a
dialog: rear door they demanded that the
text: driver open the van. It was then
dialog: that they discovered the body of
dialog: Cecil Ackerman, a 24 year old
dialog: parolee from Somerville.
text: Mitch watches -- breath held --
speaker_heading: REPORTER (CONT’D)
dialog: Early reports are that the driver,
dialog: who for now must remain nameless,
text: claims his innocence. Saying that
dialog: he found Ackerman dying in the
text: road, the victim of an apparent hit
dialog: and run, and was merely trying to
dialog: get him to a hospital.
text: Mitch pushes up to his feet --
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I gotta go.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: This is Jeff Franklin, reporting
dialog: live, from Back Bay.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Do you know that guy?
text: Mitch digs out his wallet...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: It’s ... it’s a work thing.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Hey, if you’ve gotta go, you've
dialog: gotta go.
text: Mitch holds out a twenty. Doyle waves it off.
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Your money’s no good here.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I’1l call you.
text: Mitch walks away.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Let’s arrange a time for me to come
dialog: meet my new family. Mitch?
text: But Mitch just pushes out the street door. Doesn’t look
text: back. Waitress tops up Doyle's coffee. Mitch’s departure
text: stung Doyle, but he covers it with a smile...
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: That was my brother. He's a big
dialog: shot D.A. He’s working an
dialog: important case.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: Waitress walks on. Doyle chomps on his bacon sandwich...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE STATION - BACK BAY — DAY
dialog: 
text: As Mitch pulls up to a meter in the Prius, he sees a pair of
text: NEWS VANS camped outside the station. Mitch climbs out and
text: walks toward the station doors. Looks through the familiar
text: chain-link fence into the impound yard and sees the white
dialog: van.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION —- BACK BAY —- DAY
dialog: 
text: Mitch approaches the DESK SERGEANT. Shows him his ID...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Detective Kanon is expecting me.
scene_heading: INT. DETECTIVE KANON’S OFFICE - POLICE STATION - DAY
dialog: 
text: DETECTIVE BLAKE KANON, 48, hair tied back, is typing a report
text: into her computer, glasses perched on the tip of her nose, a
dialog: hunt-and-peck two finger typer.
dialog: 26.
text: Her office is a mess of paperwork. Shelves lined with
text: baseball trophies. A signed photo of Kanon and Micky Mantel
text: hangs on the wall. She’s a woman in a man’s world.
text: Mitch knocks on the open door.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Detective Kanon?
text: Kanon gestures for him to come in and sit. She types a last
dialog: couple of words and then --
speaker_heading: KANON
dialog: How many tees in committed?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Two.
text: Kanon fixes it, saves, and takes off her glasses...
speaker_heading: KANON
dialog: Paperwork. Worst part of the job.
dialog: Do you touch type?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I have a secretary.
text: Kanon pops a Nicorette gum...
speaker_heading: KANON
dialog: Nice.
dialog: (offers him gum; he
dialog: declines--)
dialog: So, you got here quick. You said
dialog: on the phone you were interested in
dialog: the Ackerman murder.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: That’s right.
speaker_heading: KANON
dialog: DA assigned just you?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: This is a provisional enquiry.
speaker_heading: KANON
dialog: Walk with me.
text: Kanon picks up a stack of papers. They leave the office...
speaker_heading: KANON (CONT'D)
text: Suspect’s name is Tobias Levy.
text: Forty-Nine years old.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: KANON (CONT'D)
dialog: Car mechanic by trade. Couple of
dialog: assault charges, nothing he did
dialog: time for. No relatives. Wife and
dialog: daughter were both murdered a few
dialog: years back.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: It said on the news that he found
text: Ackerman in the road.
speaker_heading: KANON
dialog: We've had officers out there. No
dialog: broken car parts, no blood that we
dialog: can see...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: It was raining pretty hard last
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: KANON
dialog: True -- but with the dead kid’s
text: blood and hair on his clothes --
dialog: not to mention the bloody tools and
dialog: plastic sheets we found in the back
dialog: of the van -- we’ve got enough to
dialog: charge him. You guys need to
dialog: decide if it’s enough to convict.
text: Mitch looks through a window and sees --
speaker_heading: TOBIAS LEVY
text: sitting handcuffed in a chair in the middle of an interview
text: room. Levy is an unassuming man. Hair thin. His clothes
text: taken as evidence. He is wrapped in a large blanket. Hands
text: stained with dry blood.
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: He looks scared.
speaker_heading: KANON
dialog: You think the guilty ones don’t?
text: This guy’s staring down twenty to
dialog: life for this one alone.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What do you mean “this one”?
speaker_heading: KANON
dialog: I ran some keywords through the
dialog: database -- tools, torture, male
text: victims. It flagged a string of
dialog: unsolved homicides. We’re pulling
dialog: the files now.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You think this guy’s a serial
dialog: killer? You don’t even know he did
dialog: this one.
speaker_heading: KANON
dialog: Listen kid, I just work the
dialog: evidence. Every detective here has
dialog: a caseload this high -- and only 24
dialog: hours in the day to work ‘em -- so
dialog: if it turns out this guy clears up
dialog: five unsolveds -- that’s a good day
dialog: in my books.
text: Kanon starts to walks away...
speaker_heading: KANON (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell your boss he'll get everything
dialog: we've got when we get it, okay?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What if he really is just a “Good
dialog: Samaritan”? Did you consider that?
text: Kanon just waves -- doesn’t look back. There is a commotion
text: down the hall. A PRIEST is there arguing with OFFICERS.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Then let me talk to somebody in
dialog: charge.
text: Officers beckon to Kanon who sighs and approaches the Priest.
text: Mitch -- alone now -- steps closer to the window. Looks in
text: on Levy who just sits there. Unmoving. Calm.
speaker_heading: PRIEST (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: You must have made a mistake.
dialog: Tobias wouldn’t hurt a fly. I’m
dialog: not leaving until I see him.
text: Mitch looks down the hall at the Priest and Kanon talking.
speaker_heading: PRIEST (CONT'D)
dialog: Hasn’t he been through enough?
text: Mitch looks back at Levy. We see Mitch’s reflection in the
text: glass. Their faces line up over each other, like Mitch and
dialog: Levy are interchangeable...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 29.
scene_heading: INT. THE PAXTON TAP — AFTERNOON
text: The place is quiet. A few early drinkers. Mitch is sitting
text: at the bar nursing a beer. BARTENDER (GIO), 40, friendly,
text: slides him a shot of Scotch.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What’s this?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
text: Hair of the dog.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I’m not hungover.
text: Mitch rubs his hand through his hair. Needs to talk...
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: So, why the face like a slapped
dialog: ass?
text: Bartender pops the cap off a Bud Lite and hands it toa
dialog: customer.
text: Writes on their tab...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Buddy of mine did something stupid
text: and he doesn’t know how to fix it.
speaker_heading: GIO
dialog: What are we talking - stupid stupid
dialog: or illegal stupid?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Lose everything - career, wife,
dialog: freedom - kinda stupid.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Does anybody else know your friend
dialog: did this thing?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Then, shit man - whatever it is -
dialog: tell him to say twelve Hail Marys
dialog: and take it to the grave.
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: Somebody else is being blamed for
dialog: what he did.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Ouch.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: He only has two choices, right?
dialog: Fess up or let the guy take the
dialog: rap. And either way he’s screwed.
text: Mitch downs the Scotch.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Personally - and I’m an asshole -
dialog: I'd still choose the Hail Marys and
dialog: throw in a prayer that he doesn’t
dialog: get a prosecutor like you.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: This may come as a surprise to you,
dialog: Mitch, but some prosecutors lose
dialog: cases from time to time.
text: Somebody further along the bar signals to Bartender. He
text: walks away...
speaker_heading: BARTENDER (CONT’D)
dialog: Yes, pal? What can I do you for?
text: Mitch sits there. The wheels of his mind turning. He gets
text: up and throws a twenty on the bar. Hurries out the door...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JONES’ OFFICE - DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE - EVENING
dialog:

speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Mitch. I thought you’d left for

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I have a request, sir.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Oh?
scene_heading: INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - EVENING
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - CITY JAIL - DAY

scene_heading: INT. INTERVIEW ROOM —- CITY JAIL - DAY
dialog: 
text: Mitch and Stuart walk in. Levy is wearing a badly fitting
text: prison jumpsuit. Wrists cuffed. Sitting beside him at the
text: table is a wet-behind-the-ears PUBLIC DEFENDER - TERRY
text: LUNDGREN. Lundgren stands to great them. They trade
dialog: business cards...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Mitch Brody, D.A.'s office. This
dialog: is my associate Stuart Kemp.
speaker_heading: LUNDGREN
dialog: Terry Lundgren, Public Defenders
dialog: office.
text: Mitch looks at Lundgren’s card. A printed name has been
text: crossed out and Lundgren’s name written in by hand. He’s
dialog: that new.
speaker_heading: LUNDGREN (CONT'D)
dialog: I haven’t got my own cards yet.
text: Mitch and Stuart take seats across the table. Take files
text: from their briefcases. Levy just stares at Mitch.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Mister Levy, we’re going to ask you
dialog: a few questions about the night of
dialog: the 4th. If you could answer as
text: clearly and accurately as possible.
speaker_heading: LEVY
dialog: Are you my prosecutor?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yes. Yes I am.
speaker_heading: LEVY
dialog: I’m innocent.
text: Levy hold’s Mitch's look.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Then you’ve got nothing to worry
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: LEVY
dialog: Do I have your word on that, Mitch?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Absolutely.
text: Levy sits back...
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Can you tell us where you were
dialog: earlier that night, Mr. Levy? Were
dialog: you out drinking?
speaker_heading: LEVY
dialog: I don’t drink. I finished work,
dialog: went to group, then I went for a
dialog: drive.
text: Mitch notices Lundgren write that down.
text: out of ink.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Group?
text: Mitch slides Lundgren a pen.
speaker_heading: LEVY
dialog: Or try. His pen is
dialog: I help out at support groups and
dialog: church meetings.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I see. And the drive?
speaker_heading: LEVY
dialog: Just something I do. Helps me
dialog: sleep. Haven’t you ever taken a
dialog: drive at night, Mitch?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: That's beside the point. I’m not
text: the one under arrest for murder.
text: Again Mitch feels Levy hold his gaze.
dialog: Uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: LEVY
dialog: Right.
text: It’s penetrating.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 33.
scene_heading: INT. JONES’ OFFICE —- DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE -— DAY
dialog: 
text: Mitch and Stuart are sitting opposite Jones.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: What do we know about the victim?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Cecil Ackerman.
text: Mitch hands Jones a rap sheet with a photo of Ackerman on.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: A registered sex offender. Two
dialog: counts of statutory rape. Been out
dialog: on parole for three months.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: So, a real loss to humanity.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: So far, there’s no connection
text: between him and Levy.
speaker_heading: STAURT
dialog: Other than Levy’s hammer in the
dialog: back of his head, you mean.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Tell me about the murder weapon.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Weapons. Plural. Coroner couldn’t
dialog: be exact but the wounds are
dialog: consistent with the type of tools
text: and machine parts found in the back
text: of Levy’s van.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Though they also found significant
text: amounts of motor oil and grit in
text: the wounds which corroborates his
dialog: hit and run story.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: True, but the vic’s DNA and blood
dialog: were all over Levy’s clothes --
text: inside his van...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: All of which is explainable by
dialog: transference when he lifted
text: Ackerman into his van.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Or when he murdered him.
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK
text: BAM! Mitch's Escalade hits Ackerman.
text: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: STUART (CONT'D)
dialog: Levy has three counts of aggravated
dialog: assault.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: At a time when his family had just
text: been murdered in a home invasion.
dialog: He hasn’t had so much as a parking
dialog: ticket since.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: That doesn’t negate the fact that
text: he took a tire-iron to three men
dialog: and hospitalized them.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: What’s concerning you, Mitch?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I don’t see motive.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Ackerman was a pedophile.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Levy’s daughter was murdered, not
text: raped. It doesn’t fit.
text: Secretary knocks and enters.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Terry Lundgren just called. There
text: was a 911 call. Tape’s on its way.
text: Mitch looks worried...
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Secretary slots the cassette into the machine. Mitch and
text: Stuart sit opposite Jones.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Somebody called in an accident
dialog: twenty minutes before Levy was
text: picked up. When the ambulance got
dialog: there ... there was no body.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Let’s hear it.
text: Secretary presses play. Static fills the room. We can feel
dialog: Mitch stop breathing as --
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: 911 what’s your emergency?
speaker_heading: MITCH'’S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: There’s been an accident.
text: Mitch watches the room for any hint of recognition...
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: What’s the location?
speaker_heading: MITCH’S VOICE (0.S.)
text: It’s Darby Street. Just south of
dialog: 20th. Hurry.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: What’s your name, sir?
speaker_heading: MITCH’S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Please hurry. He’s hurt real bad.
text: There is a click and the call ends. Secretary presses stop.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: That’s it?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: You want me to play it again?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JONES
text: The location matches Levy’s story
dialog: but we can’t rule out the
dialog: possibility that he made the call
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Is there any way we can find the
dialog: caller?
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: He used a payphone.
text: Stuart looks up from documents that came with the tape.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: How do you know that?
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Because we'd have the man’s name if
dialog: it wasn’t.
text: Mitch breathes...
speaker_heading: JONES (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, the tape’s potentially
dialog: damaging but not conclusive. Maybe
dialog: it was a crank, maybe not, but if
dialog: we can’t find the caller then
dialog: defense can’t. Hell, it could be
dialog: anyone in Boston. It sounds like
dialog: Mitch. Where were you that night?
text: Stuart and Secretary laugh. Mitch smiles.
speaker_heading: JONES (CONT'D)
dialog: Bottom line. Do we have enough for
dialog: a conviction?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Without motive? I say no.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Stuart?
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Levy was caught - pardon the pun -
dialog: red-handed. We have physical
dialog: evidence, a documented history of
dialog: violence, no alibi, and his public
dialog: defender is the kind of guy Mitch
dialog: eats for breakfast.
dialog: Jones weighs a decision. To prosecute or not to prosecute.
text: Mitch says a silent prayer and --
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Charge him. Murder one.
text: Mitch’s shoulders sink. Jones gets up and leaves. Stuart
text: and Secretary gather papers and the tape. Stuart pats his
dialog: shoulder...
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: You've got to have more faith in
dialog: yourself, buddy.
text: Mitch is left alone. He just sits there...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - COURTHOUSE - DAY

text: A door opens and Judge McKenna walks in and goes to her seat.
speaker_heading: COURT BAILIFF
dialog: All rise.
text: Mitch and the rest of the room stand. Judge McKenna sits and

speaker_heading: COURT BAILIFF (CONT’D)

text: Judge makes a note...
speaker_heading: JUDGE MCKENNA
dialog: In the case of the people versus
dialog: Tobias Levy, your client entered a
dialog: plea of not guilty. Does he wish
dialog: to change that plea here today?
speaker_heading: LUNDGREN
dialog: He does not, your honor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MCKENNA
dialog: Very well. Defense may go ahead
text: with its opening statement.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: LUNDGREN
dialog: Thank you, your honor. This case
dialog: is nothing more than a huge
dialog: misinterpretation of the facts...
speaker_heading: JUDGE MCKENNA
dialog: Not to me, Mr. Lundgren. To them.
text: Judge McKenna indicates the Jury. Lundgren turns to them.
text: Stuart smiles. Mitch exhales... throwing this case is going
dialog: to be harder than he thought.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM — COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: The sun is low outside the windows. The CORONER is on the
text: stand. There are blow-up photos of tools from the back of
text: Levy's van on display...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You examined the body, Doctor. In
dialog: your professional opinion what was
dialog: the cause of death?
speaker_heading: CORONER
text: Blunt force trauma to the skull.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Do you know what caused that
dialog: trauma?
speaker_heading: CORONER
text: The back of the skull was badly
dialog: crushed so its hard to narrow it
dialog: down to any one item but some of
text: the marks seem consistent with a
text: hammer found in the suspect’s van.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You said “seem” consistent.
speaker_heading: CORONER
dialog: That’s correct.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Your report talks of abrasions and
text: impact wounds with motor oil and
dialog: grease in them. The defence, I’m
dialog: sure, is going to argue that those
text: wounds indicate a car ran Cecil
text: Ackerman over and that the rest is
dialog: a misinterpretation of the
dialog: evidence.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: CORONER
dialog: The accused is a mechanic who used
dialog: his van to transport old parts to
dialog: and from the wrecker’s yard. If I
dialog: remember correctly there was an
dialog: axle, leaf springs, suspension arms
dialog: inside... And the interior was
text: covered in grease and motor oil.
dialog: So any type of violent struggle in
dialog: that environment could have caused
dialog: those wounds and left that trace
dialog: evidence.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I see. And did you identify any of
dialog: those parts as things he used?
speaker_heading: CORONER
dialog: There was blood on a lot of things -
dialog: - it might be easier to say which
dialog: one’s he didn’t use.
text: This gets a reaction from the jury. They look at Levy.
text: Disgusted. Like he’s a monster. Mitch breathes. He’s not
dialog: swayed the Jury one inch...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: No further questions, your honor.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM —- MITCH’S HOME — NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Mitch has the entire case spread over the table in front of
text: him. He sips a coffee and rubs his eyes. Rachel walks in
text: carrying Ella.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Bit late for coffee, isn’t it?
text: She looks over his shoulder. Sees a photo of Tobias Levy -
dialog: years younger than the man we know - happier...
speaker_heading: RACHEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that him?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Four years ago. This is before his
dialog: family were murdered in a home
text: invasion. He was forced to watch
text: and then left for dead.
text: Mitch pulls out a picture of Levy with his wife and daughter.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: That's horrible. Did they catch
dialog: the killer?
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: He was gunned down in another home
text: invasion the next night.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Is that what made his snap?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: That’s the general consensus.
text: Mitch sips his coffee...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Here, I know you’re working, but
dialog: can you take Ella for a bit? I
dialog: need to take a shower before bed.
dialog: I smell like milk and my hair feels
dialog: like straw.
dialog: 
text: Rachel hands him Ella. He cradles her in his arms.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Does mommy smell like milk because
dialog: of you? Does she?
text: Ella's eyes sparkle as she looks up at him. She grips his
text: finger with her tiny hand. Mitch takes a big sigh. This

speaker_heading: MITCH’S VOICE (0.S.)

text: The call ends. Everyone looks to --
text: DR. EVELYN BROWN, 50s, professional, blind since birth, who
text: is sitting, calmly on the stand.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MCKENNA
dialog: Your witness, Mr. Brody.
text: Stuart leans in to Mitch...
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Piece of cake. The jury has no
dialog: idea what she’s been talking about.
dialog: Mitch takes that onboard and --
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I’m not very familiar with your
dialog: field, Dr. Brown and I’m sure
dialog: neither is the jury.
text: Brown looks toward Mitch. Even behind her black glasses we
text: sense her staring at him with some sense of recognition...
text: It gives Mitch pause. He coughs...
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Just how accurate is forensic
dialog: linguistics?
speaker_heading: DR. BROWN
dialog: Extremely.
text: Mitch stands. Begins to pace.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: But not perfect.
speaker_heading: DR. BROWN
dialog: Perfection doesn’t happen in
dialog: science.
text: Her head follows him as he moves. Listening...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: On a sliding scale of one to ten
dialog: then?
speaker_heading: JUDGE MCKENNA
dialog: (to Lundgren)
dialog: You might want to object,
text: counselor. The witness’ field is
dialog: not on trial here.
text: Before Lundgren can respond...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I'll withdraw the question, your
dialog: honor.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: You stated earlier that the caller
dialog: was genuine - and by that I assume
dialog: you mean he was reporting a real
dialog: accident.
speaker_heading: DR. BROWN
dialog: Correct.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: And you can tell this just by
text: listening to his voice.
speaker_heading: DR. BROWN
dialog: It’s more complicated than that,
dialog: but - yes.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Can you tell us anything else about
dialog: the caller?
speaker_heading: DR. BROWN
text: Probably white. Medium build.
dialog: He’s from the south of Boston, but
dialog: he’s tried hard to soften the
dialog: accent - again, not unlike yourself
dialog: counselor. You’re from where -
dialog: Dorchester?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: That’s right.
speaker_heading: DR. BROWN
dialog: The caller had a strict Roman
dialog: Catholic upbringing - so there’s
dialog: probably Irish in there - which we
text: can tell by an almost inaudible
text: prayer he mumbles while the
dialog: operator is talking. I’m sure he
dialog: didn’t even know he did it himself.
dialog: And he’s cool under pressure which
dialog: we know from the way he gives no
dialog: personal details and had the
dialog: forethought to use a payphone even
text: in his heightened emotional state.
dialog: All of which tells me he has either
dialog: a legal or criminal background.
dialog: None of which matches Tobias Levy.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Legal or criminal. That’s quite a
dialog: spread.
speaker_heading: DR. BROWN
dialog: Actually, the psychological traits
dialog: for both professions are
text: surprisingly similar.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: So, in your professional opinion is
dialog: it even in the realm of possibility
dialog: that Tobias Levy made this 911 call
dialog: himself - to establish an alibi?
speaker_heading: DR. BROWN
dialog: No. It is not.
dialog: 43.
text: The Jury trades nods of understanding. Stuart drops his pen

speaker_heading: JUDGE MCKENNA

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: That wasn’t my intention.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MCKENNA
dialog: What was?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I thought I could shake her

text: McKenna stares at him. A beat...
speaker_heading: JUDGE MCKENNA
dialog: I’m going to say this once, and

dialog: isn’t playing straight on this I
dialog: will call for a mistrial and start
dialog: the whole thing over. Do you hear
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: LUNDGREN

speaker_heading: MITCH

speaker_heading: JUDGE MCKENNA

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: That’s no excuse. I should have

speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: But you didn’t. And I don’t blame
dialog: you. But what the ef’ were you
dialog: thinking taking the case?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I couldn't let somebody else
dialog: prosecute. There are ADAs in my
dialog: office who were ready to crucify
text: him. The evidence is so ambiguous
dialog: you can paint any story you want
dialog: onto it -- he’d be railroaded.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: He would with this public defender.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I thought I could just ease back
dialog: and let the guy win but this idiot
dialog: couldn’t try his way out of a paper
dialog: bag.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: So, let him go down. You don’t owe
dialog: this schmuck anything.
speaker_heading: MITCH

speaker_heading: DOYLE

speaker_heading: MITCH

speaker_heading: DOYLE

speaker_heading: LUNDGREN

speaker_heading: REPORTER #1
dialog: What about the wounds on the body?
speaker_heading: LUNDGREN

speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: You're my brother.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I mean, ten years ago. Why did

speaker_heading: FLASHBACK

speaker_heading: KANON
dialog: You saw Gonzales at the mall?
speaker_heading: MITCH

speaker_heading: KANON

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: The point is, I looked at the

speaker_heading: KANON

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What if it was both? What if
text: Ackerman ran into the path of a car
dialog: because he was trying to get away

dialog: Ackerman was a child molester.

speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: You say it started with the death

scene_heading: EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY
text: Levy walks through the graves carrying flowers.
speaker_heading: MITCH’S VOICE (V.O.)
text: A man broke into their home and

text: Levy reaches the grave of his wife and daughter. He removes

scene_heading: INT. MITCH’S OFFICE - DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: The killer made Levy watch
text: everything. Then slit his throat

scene_heading: EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY
text: Levy stands looking at the grave. At the framed photo of his
text: wife and daughter standing beside the flowers.
speaker_heading: MITCH'’S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: It’s a miracle he survived.
text: Levy absently touches his throat. We see the FAINT SCAR
text: beneath his stubble.
scene_heading: INT. MITCH’S OFFICE - DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: So he was tortured. And all these
dialog: men were tortured, too.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: But of all the ex-cons in Boston,
dialog: why target these specific men?
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: You really can’t tell me why you’re
dialog: doing this?
speaker_heading: MITCH

scene_heading: INT. READING ROOM —- BOSTON LIBRARY — DAY
dialog: 
text: Mitch is sitting at a desk. He has a stack of binders

dialog: 76.
text: Finds the news story: “HOME INVASION MASSACRE.”
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: MICROFICHE BLURS
text: and settles on another story --
scene_heading: INT. MICRO-FICHE ROOM - BOSTON LIBRARY — DAY
dialog: 
text: Mitch reads the “GAS STATION SHOOTING” story on the screen
text: before him. He zooms in on areas of text. Finds the man who
dialog: murdered Levy’s family was --
dialog: “career criminal”...
dialog: “in and out of prison”...
dialog: “recently paroled”...
text: Mitch moves on. Then stops. Backtracks. Focuses on the
dialog: word --
text: “PAROLED”.
text: Mitch turns from the Microfish machine and digs into his
text: briefcase. Pulls out files on each of the victims. Skims
text: through pages. Finds the words --
scene_heading: INSERT - “RECENT PAROLEE”.
text: He moves on. Skims the next file. Finds --
scene_heading: INSERT - “PAROLED”
text: He skims Cecil Ackerman’s file. Finds the same thing.
text: Mitch sits back. Pondering this fact.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CARDIFF STREET - DAY
text: A low-rent neighborhood of liquor stores and welfare housing.
text: Mitch's Escalade drives into the run-down street.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. MITCH’S ESCALADE (MOVING) - DAY
dialog: 
text: Mitch has the scrap of paper that Doyle gave him. He parks
text: outside the “halfway house”. EX-CONS are sitting on the
text: steps smoking and talking.
text: Mitch gets out and approaches them. Asks about Doyle. They
text: gesture to a bar down the street.
dialog: 77.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE BAR - DAY
text: Dark as a dungeon. Mitch walk down the steps and looks
text: around the gloom. There is A MAN slumped at a table. Mitch
text: approaches him and lifts his head. It’s not Doyle.
text: A noise. Mitch looks round and sees Doyle coming in from
text: storage carrying a crate of beers. He works here.
text: Doyle sees Mitch standing over the drunk.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: That’s what you think of me, huh?
text: Doyle puts the crate down and begins stocking the fridge.
text: Mitch approaches him...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I need to talk to you.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: So, talk.
dialog: Doyle continues to work...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I need your help.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I thought you didn’t need anybody's
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: We made a mistake. That man we
text: freed. He’s a serial killer.
text: Doyle slows. Shakes his head...
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: He broke into my house. He
dialog: threatened Rachel and Ella.
text: Now he has Doyle’s attention. Mitch holds his gaze.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: You're serious.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 78.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK ALLEY - BEHIND BAR — DAY
text: Doyle and Mitch step out of the bar. Doyle stacks a crate of
text: empty bottles. Looks around. The alley is deserted.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: So, the only reason Ackerman was in
dialog: the road that night was because he
dialog: was running from Levy.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: And after you left he finished the
dialog: job.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Exactly. I was so wrapped up in my
dialog: own guilt that I didn’t see the
dialog: evidence for what it was. I didn’t
dialog: even stop to ask why Ackerman was
text: out in the rain without a coat.
text: With no shoes on. And his eyes. He
dialog: was begging me not to leave him. I
dialog: thought he was just scared...
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Fuck.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I've got to do something.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: What do you mean? Leave it the
dialog: fuck alone.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: You're going to have to.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: He all but told me he’s going to
dialog: kill again. I can’t live with
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I think you’re forgetting -- I
dialog: perjured myself -- you left the
text: scene of an accident, manipulated a
dialog: trail --
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I know. It’s bad. But all we need
dialog: is proof. Levy can’t be retried
dialog: for Ackerman but if I can get
dialog: evidence that he killed the other
dialog: men, I can cut us both a deal.
dialog: What you said under oath - what I
dialog: did - that all goes away.
dialog: Doyle nods -- it sounds logical --
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: So, what are you thinking?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: We need to get inside his house and
dialog: look around. He targeted those
dialog: men. He tortured them. He may
dialog: have overlooked something that
text: links them to him.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I’m on parole. I get caught
dialog: breaking into some guy’s house...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I’'ll break in. All I need is for
dialog: you to tail him. Warn me when he’s
text: coming back.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: So, just a little aiding and
text: abetting.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: This fucker really break into your
dialog: house?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: While we were sleeping.
text: Doyle weighs his options. He doesn’t have any...
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: He knows your ride. Rent me a

text: Doyle goes back into the bar.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Thanks, Doyle. I mean it.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LEVY'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
text: Thunder rumbles in the sky. A light rain falls. Levy walks

dialog: Challenger...
scene_heading: INT/EXT. DOYLE’S CHALLENGER - CONTINUOUS
text: Mitch and Doyle watch the van reach the end of the street.
text: Doyle starts the engine. It growls to life.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Listen to that engine. Man, this

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: And it’s rented in my name so don’t

speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Got full collision waiver, didn't

speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, Mitch - what’s your number

text: Mitch turns his collar up against the weather. He crosses
dialog: the street toward --

scene_heading: EXT. LEVY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Mitch glances up and down the deserted street. Slips through
dialog: the gate.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE PATH - LEVY’S HOUSE — CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Overgrown. Mitch tries the back door. Locked. He looks
text: through the glass. Sees a 50s style kitchen.
text: Mitch moves toward the back garden. Notices a low basement
text: window. Pushes it with his foot. It moves. He gives it a
dialog: stronger kick...
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT —- LEVY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The bolt breaks free of the rotten frame. Mitch pushes the
text: window open. Slides inside feet first. Lands.
text: Mitch pulls a pen-light from his pocket and looks around the
text: room piled with boxes and furniture. Levy’s entire family
text: life in boxes. Framed photos of Levy with his wife and
dialog: daughter. Stuffed toys. Anything luxurious.
scene_heading: EXT. FULLER'S AUTO REPAIR SHOP —- AFTERNOON

scene_heading: INT. DOYLE’S CHALLENGER —- AFTERNOON
dialog:

text: factory. Doyle kills the engine.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - LEVY'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: The basement door opens and Mitch steps up into the hallway.
text: The walls are bare. Pale squares show where family photos
dialog: used to hang. Mitch goes into --
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM —- LEVY'S HOUSE -— CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: -- and sees the TV, sitting on a folding table. One wooden
text: chair faces it. Newspapers are piled beside it, like a
text: coffee table. A week of microwave meal trays are piled on
text: the papers. A fly buzzes in the air...
scene_heading: INT/EXT. DOYLE’S CHALLENGER - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Doyle presses eject on the CD player. Bored. A Barry
text: Manillow CD pops out. Doyle drops it out the window. Sees
text: Levy getting into his van. Doyle starts the engine. Levy
text: pulls out of the Repair Shop grounds. Drives away.
dialog: 82.
text: Doyle starts to pull out after him. A passing car HONKS.
text: Doyle stomps on the brakes.
scene_heading: INT. LEVY’S VAN (MOVING) - AFTERNOON

scene_heading: INT. DOYLE’S CHALLENGER —- AFTERNOON

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM —- LEVY'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Mitch opens the bedroom door and looks inside the empty room.
text: Monastic is the best description. A sweat-stained bed. A

text: and picks up the bible resting there.
text: His cellphone rings. Loud. Mitch jumps.
speaker_heading: MITCH

text: Levy reaches over to the police scanner and fires it up.
text: Police radio chatter fills the van...
scene_heading: INT. LEVY’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
text: Mitch flicks through the Bible. Sees whole passages have
text: been marked and highlighted.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: The guy has nothing in his house
text: except a Bible, a TV and microwave
text: meals. It’s like he can’t bear to
text: be reminded of his wife and kid.
dialog: He’s hidden everything in the
dialog: basement.
speaker_heading: DOYLE’S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Anything tying him to the victims?
text: Mitch picks a calendar off the wall. Every day has the
dialog: schedule of some self-help group or other...
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: Not so far. It looks like the man
dialog: eats and sleeps here ... but that’s
dialog: about it.
scene_heading: INT. DOYLE’'S CHALLENGER (MOVING) - EVENING
text: Doyle is still tailing Levy. They approach a huge cement

dialog: But just before they reach it --
text: The white van turns off the road, through a chain-link gate,
dialog: toward an --
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - EVENING
text: And Levy parks outside. Weeds are overgrowing. Windows

speaker_heading: MITCH’S VOICE (0.S.)
text: He spends the rest of his time at

text: Doyle parks on the road and watches as Levy gets out, un-

speaker_heading: MITCH'S VOICE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: He sometimes goes to two a night.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Now that’s just masochistic. I

scene_heading: INT. LEVY’S HOUSE —- EVENING

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What do you mean “have to”?
scene_heading: INTERCUT - DOYLE AND MITCH
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: It’s one of the conditions of my

speaker_heading: MITCH

speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: A lot of ex-cons are.
text: Mitch walks into the hallway and back down the stairs..
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: And a lot of them need it.
text: Doyle keeps watching the factory. Where the hell is Levy?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I mean, I don’t know how some of

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: They admit that?
speaker_heading: DOYLE

speaker_heading: FLASHBACK

speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: And when he hears somebody who says
dialog: they’1l re-offend...
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: He offs them.
text: Doyle sees Levy walk out of the factory carrying a hammer and
text: away from his van. He disappears from view behind an old
dialog: wall...
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: (silent)
dialog: What the hell?
text: Doyle looks around. Can’t see Levy anywhere...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: He’s stopping what happened to his
text: family from happening again.
text: Mitch's foot CREAKS on a floorboard. He stops. Backsteps.
text: It creaks again. He bends and feels the edge. Lifts it to
dialog: reveal --
text: A CAVITY beneath the floor. He digs his arm in.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Hang on. I think I’ve found
dialog: something.
text: Mitch pulls out a black plastic bag. He opens it. Inside he
dialog: finds --
speaker_heading: MASSACHUSETTS IDS
dialog: -- for all the victims. Cecil Ackermann, Victor Gonzales
dialog: etc...
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: He kept their IDs.
text: Doyle gets out of the car and looks around the deserted

text: HEARS it through the phone...
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s that noise?
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: It’s the cement works.
text: Mitch leaves the bag of IDs and hurries to --
speaker_heading: THE WINDOW

text: only a few blocks away - beyond the opposite row of houses.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Is he coming back?
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: No, we've stopped. He went inside

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Carrying what?
speaker_heading: DOYLE
text: A hammer.
text: Doyle SENSES somebody behind him and turns as --
speaker_heading: MITCH

speaker_heading: KANON
dialog: So, why turn on him now?
speaker_heading: MITCH

speaker_heading: KANON

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I didn’t hurt, Doyle. I wouldn't

speaker_heading: KANON
dialog: Except Ackerman. We found this in

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: That's because Levy put it there!
speaker_heading: KANON
dialog: It has two types of blood on it --
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I’m being framed!
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: KANON
dialog: -- and by your own admission we can
dialog: now link you to three victims.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Jesus Christ - can you think
dialog: logically? Why would I do this?
dialog: What’s my motive? And if I was the
dialog: killer why didn’t I crucify Levy in
dialog: court? He was the perfect
dialog: scapegoat.
speaker_heading: KANON
dialog: You tell me.
text: Mitch SLAMS the table with his cuffed fists.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Because I’m innocent!
text: Kanon just sits and looks at him. Mitch breathes...
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. Listen to me. There’s a
dialog: bag.
speaker_heading: KANON
text: A bag.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Levy kept the IDs of all his

dialog: his family.
speaker_heading: KANON
dialog: Where is this bag?
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: In Levy’s house.
speaker_heading: KANON
dialog: In his house?
speaker_heading: MITCH

speaker_heading: KANON

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I broke in.

speaker_heading: KANON
dialog: How do I know you didn’t plant
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Because I didn’t! Jesus,

text: Kanon just looks at him. She’s like a stone wall and it’s

speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t think I should answer

speaker_heading: KANON
dialog: That's probably the first honest

scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - POLICE STATION - BACK BAY - DAY

speaker_heading: MITCH

speaker_heading: LEVY
