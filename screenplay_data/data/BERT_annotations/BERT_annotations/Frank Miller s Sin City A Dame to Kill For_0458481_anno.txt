speaker_heading: JON

dialog: No. Too... shit.
scene_heading: EXT. JON’S SUBURBAN STREET - LATER
text: Jon's commute home is almost at an end. He trudges up the

text: A new song starts. This one sounds rather good.
speaker_heading: JON (V.O.)
dialog: (Singing)
dialog: I dream of an angel

speaker_heading: JON

scene_heading: INT. JON’'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: A typical suburban bedroom. Cool music festival posters

dialog: He's forgotten the song.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: (Murmuring)
dialog: Shit.

speaker_heading: TITLES END
scene_heading: I/E. OFFICE BUILDING - THE NEXT MORNING
text: There’s no music now - just traffic noise.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - DAY
text: Jon sits at his workstation. He seems to be in marketing.
scene_heading: INT. CAFE - DAY
text: Jon waits for his order. It’s a noisy place - CUSTOMERS
text: ordering, the CLATTER of cutlery.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Beneath the noises we can just discern the sound of the
text: radio playing on a shelf - the drone of a local station
dialog: interview.
text: Something CATCHES JON’S ATTENTION - something coming from
dialog: the radio?
text: He leans a little closer, trying to hear whatever the
text: sound is - a kind of keening wail? A series of abrupt,
text: violent exclamations? The sound of something smashing?
dialog: Someone yelling?
speaker_heading: CAFE LADY
dialog: (Calling)
dialog: Cheese and ham panini for Jon?
speaker_heading: JON?
text: On the radio we just catch a distant shout of...
speaker_heading: WOMAN’S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: ---cunt!
text: Jon stares at the radio, wondering if he could have heard
text: that correctly. The Local DJ sounds a little stunned
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: LOCAL DJ (0.S.)
dialog: That was, that was The...
text: The DJ attempts the same sound Jon made when trying to
text: pronounce the band’s name. And also fails.
speaker_heading: LOCAL DJ (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And ...I can only apologize.
text: Jon looks quizzically at the radio. Then he takes his
dialog: panini.
scene_heading: EXT. SEAFRONT - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Jon sits on a bench.
text: At the other end of the bench a WOMAN reads GRAZIA
text: magazine. Jon looks at the cover. It’s something about
dialog: Nicole Scherzinger.
text: Jon pulls out his phone and types into TWITTER.
speaker_heading: JON (V.0.)
text: Nicole Scherzinger hashtag yawn.
text: His number of twitter followers has gone down to 47. He
text: frowns.
text: He becomes aware of some drama occurring on the beach. A
text: PARAMEDIC CREW rushes towards some kind of commotion in
dialog: the water.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Jon gets up and - along with other PASSERS-BY - walks
text: over to get a closer look.
text: A MAN is trying to DROWN HIMSELF in the water.
text: Two POLICE OFFICERS attempt to coax him out.
speaker_heading: BEARDED MAN
dialog: (Yelling)
dialog: No! I’m no coming out! Leave me
dialog: alone!
text: Three figures stand watching from a slight distance,
dialog: their backs to us. Although we don’t know them yet they
scene_heading: are NANA, CLARA and JEAN BARAQUE.
text: Jon finds himself beside a parked VAN. A concerned-
text: looking Californian surfer-type stands next to it. This
dialog: is DON TEAGUE.
text: The two glance at each other, nod, Jon with a “what
text: happened?” raise of his eyebrows.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: We were at this radio station and,
dialog: he and Clara had a row or, I don’t
dialog: know, I guess ...physical fight?
dialog: Next thing...
text: He indicates the water. Jon's gaze shifts to the VAN.
text: Written on the side of it is the JUMBLE OF LETTERS that
dialog: comprise the band’s name.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: You're The...
text: He gamely tries out the sound.
speaker_heading: JON (CONT'D)
dialog: You're playing tonight.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: How? Our keyboard player is trying
dialog: to drown himself.
text: The EMERGENCY SERVICES wade into the sea. Jon scratches
text: his face. A beat.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: I play keyboards.
text: Silence. Jon looks worried he sounded opportunistic.
speaker_heading: JON (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean I'd never...
text: He indicates the tormented man.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: (Somberly)
dialog: You're in.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: But I don’t know any of your
dialog: songs.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Wait there.
text: Don climbs into the mysterious darkness of the van. We
text: hear a murmured conversation. Don reemerges.
speaker_heading: DON (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you play C, F and G?
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: You're in.
text: Jon looks a little stunned.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: So what... what do we do now?
text: Don turns back to the beach again, watches with profound
text: sadness as the paramedics load the man onto a stretcher
text: and begin to carry him off the beach. One more fallen
dialog: comrade.
speaker_heading: JON (CONT'D)
dialog: Should we run through the
dialog: songs... Or...?
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: (Still watching)
text: Come to the stage door at 9pm.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: Great! I’1ll give you my number
dialog: in case anything...
text: Jon scribbles it down on a piece of paper. Don walks
text: away to the water’s edge. Jon scuttles over and
text: practically prises the paper into Don’s hand.
speaker_heading: JON (CONT'D)
text: So. Stage door. 9pm.
text: He throws one last look into the van, wondering who the
text: hell’s in there, and then heads off.
scene_heading: EXT. SEAFRONT ROAD - MOMENTS LATER
text: Jon has wound his way up from the beach, just as the
text: paramedics are loading the half-drowned keyboard player
text: into the ambulance. For a moment the two men lock eyes.
text: For an unnerving moment it seems as if THE DROWNED MAN IS
text: TRYING TO TELL JON SOMETHING - as if sensing some link?
text: Then he’s gone. Jon stares at the closing doors of the
dialog: ambulance.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Is he going to be ok?
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
dialog: He'll be fine.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: (Suddenly worried)
dialog: He'll still need to spend the
dialog: night in hospital though, right?
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
text: He swallowed a lot of seawater.
dialog: He'll have to have his stomach
dialog: pumped.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: (Relieved)
dialog: Plus I suppose there’ll be a whole
dialog: suicide risk assessment thing.
text: The paramedic looks faintly disgusted at Jon, climbs into
text: the ambulance. Jon watches as it drives away.
scene_heading: EXT. STAGE DOOR - 9PM
text: Jon is politely knocking.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: Hello?
text: Nothing. Jon looks at his watch. 9pm.
text: Jon knocks harder. The door creaks open. He nervously
text: enters.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE - DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Jon walks down the corridor and finds himself in a
text: grimy dressing room. There’s no one there.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: Hello?
text: Jon looks around.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: On the table there’s a SCRATCHING STICK with a very
text: long, curved arm. There’s also some bottles of beer,
text: one with an EXTREMELY long straw sticking out of it.
text: Jon frowns, perplexed.
text: Suddenly we hear a STRANGE BANGING NOISE from inside
text: the hall. It sounds like someone is repeatedly hitting
dialog: something.
text: Jon pauses, listens, puzzled. He realizes - this must
text: be the band. He walks towards...
scene_heading: INT. WINGS - BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Jon watches from the shadows.
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN is repeatedly banging some kind of
scene_heading: BIZARRE PERCUSSION INSTRUMENT. This is NANA.
text: A very YOUNG MAN stands playing bass. This is JEAN
speaker_heading: BARAQUE.
text: A furious looking woman stands provocatively at the
text: front of the stage, eating a pear. She tosses it aside
text: and stalks over to an odd, vast contraption covered in
text: knobs and dials and a MAD JUMBLE of coloured wires - an
text: early-1970s analog synthesizer. This is CLARA.
text: She eats the pear, tosses it aside and raises her hands
text: over the dials. She begins to play. Together they’re
text: making an EXTREMELY EXPERIMENTAL collection of sounds.
text: The audience watch this odd trio uncertainly, waiting for
dialog: something to happen.
text: And out of the darkness of the wings someone Jon hadn’t
dialog: noticed emerges...
text: He’s doing a weird jerking, shuffling dance to the
text: music. Strangest of all - he’s wearing a large FAKE
text: HEAD, with a SMILING FACE painted onto it. This is
speaker_heading: FRANK.
text: Jon and the audience gawp at the strange apparition
text: dancing across the stage before disappearing into the
text: shadows of the opposite wings. Then he wheels around
text: and dances back on.
text: Jon becomes aware that Don is standing next to him in
dialog: the wings.
text: They look at each other for a moment. Then Don gently
text: pushes Jon onto the stage.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Frank, Nana and Baraque ignore him, playing
text: relentlessly on. Clara glares at him but doesn’t move.
text: Jon stands there, not sure what to do next. Then he
text: notices a BATTERED OLD KEYBOARD set up near the back.
text: He walks over, stares down at it.
text: CLOSE ON JON’S FACE - a faint frown, thinking stopped.
text: Almost by itself, his hand reaches out and he begins to
text: play - just a little three note figure. And it fits.
text: As the song begins to swell, Jon’s other hand joins the
text: first and he begins to play along.
text: Then Frank lifts the mic he’s holding and begins to
dialog: sing - and it’s one of the strangest sounds you could
dialog: imagine. Beautiful and ridiculous at the same time.
text: Jon is lost in the ecstacy of the moment - the
text: realization of a dream.
text: Then it is abruptly over. The audience are staring in
text: silence, unsure what just happened - not that any of the
text: band are paying them any attention anyway.
text: Clara has noticed FLAMES licking out the back of her
text: synthesiser. More irritated than alarmed, she uses an old
text: scorched towel to beat out the flames, burning her hand
text: in the process.
text: Across the stage, Baraque has already begun the bass line
text: to the next song.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Baraque continues playing.
speaker_heading: CLARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop. Will you...
text: Clara throws a can of WD40 at him. It hits his face.
speaker_heading: BARAQUE
dialog: (In French,
dialog: subtitled)
dialog: Now I will have a bruise.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Good. Something to look at on your
dialog: otherwise nothing face.
text: Baraque indicates the AUDIENCE.
speaker_heading: BARAQUE

speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: BARAQUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now they see what you’re like. So
text: joyless. So angry.
text: Baraque storms off stage.
text: Clara kicks her synthesiser to the floor where it lies,
text: fizzing and sparking faintly, and stalks off through the
dialog: opposite wings.
text: Nana gives a resigned sigh, picks up her sticks and
text: leaves the stage as well.
text: For a moment it’s JUST JON AND FRANK, standing in front
text: of the nonplussed audience.
text: Jon looks uncertainly at the strange singer and Frank
text: turns his great head to look at Jon - as if seeing him
dialog: for the first time.
text: Then Clara is marching back on-stage. She takes Frank by
text: the hand and leads him away.
text: Leaving Jon alone.
scene_heading: EXT. VENUE - STAGE DOOR - EVENING
text: The band are finishing loading equipment into the van, in
text: a cold, angry silence. There is no sign of Frank. He must
text: already be in the van.
text: No-one pays any attention to Jon, who stands watching as
text: they all climb in and drive off without him.
scene_heading: INT. JON’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Jon lies in bed, tweeting on his phone.
speaker_heading: JON (V.O.)
dialog: (Typing) .

speaker_heading: JON (V.O.)
dialog: .-.-with a band tonight. Enjoyed
dialog: working with them a lot.
scene_heading: INT. JON’S LIVING ROOM - MORNING
text: Jon is miserably watching BREAKFAST TV. The keyboard
text: catches his eye. He walks over and starts to play.
text: He tries to remember the weird, wonderful melody from
text: the night before. He gets a few notes right but then
text: loses his way, the whole thing fading already, like a
dialog: dream...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He stumbles on for a little longer but then gives up.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - MORNING
text: A miserable Jon walks to work. He doesn’t compose a song.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - LATER
text: Jon looks bored. Has gazes out of the window. He
text: doesn’t compose a song. His phone rings.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: DON (V.O.)
dialog: It’s me. So Lucas got out of the
dialog: hospital and begged Clara to let
dialog: him back in the band but she
dialog: told him to lick her ass.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: Uh...
speaker_heading: DON (V.O.)
dialog: So we need a keyboard player.
dialog: And Frank said “Remember that
dialog: grateful looking boy who jumped
dialog: up onto the stage last week
dialog: uninvited.”
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I wasn’t uninvited. You invited
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: DON (V.0.)
dialog: Frank said he thought you
dialog: brought something cherishable
dialog: that night. He can sound pretty
text: muffled under the head and so
dialog: the rest of us thought he said
dialog: you brought something
dialog: perishable. Like food that
text: decays easily. Fish or fruit. So
dialog: we all said, “Come on, man,
dialog: anyone can do THAT.” But then he
dialog: repeated it clearer and we all
dialog: agreed to let you join. So. Are
dialog: you in?
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DON (V.O.)
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He hangs up. Jon looks shell-shocked. The phone rings

speaker_heading: DON (V.O.)

speaker_heading: JON
dialog: (Relieved)
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: DON (V.O.)
text: Clacket Lane Services on the M25
dialog: at 5pm today. Bring a passport.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR PARK - CLACKET LANE SERVICES - 5PM
text: Jon is waiting at Clacket Lane. He stares at a wall of
text: fog and drizzle. Nothing. Will this be another
text: disappointment? But then two headlights appear, glowing
text: faintly in the gloom and out of the fog drives the
text: band’s battered TOUR BUS, come to save us.
text: Jon watches with a mixture of excitement and
text: nervousness as the tour bus drives towards him. He
text: pulls out his phone.
text: CLOSE on the phone: Twitter.
speaker_heading: JON (V.0.)
dialog: (As he types)
dialog: You would not believe what’s
dialog: happening to me right now.
text: The van pulls up and the door slides open. We can’t see
dialog: inside.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: (Burbling)
dialog: Hi. Hello. I wasn’t sure where
dialog: to wait. Clacket Lane’s pretty
dialog: labyrinthine, isn’t it?
text: No answer issues from the van. After a moment Jon
text: climbs in. The doors close and the van sets off once
dialog: more.
scene_heading: INT. TOUR BUS - AFTERNOON
text: Jon sits in the front beside DON, who compared to the
text: rest of the band looks reassuringly normal.
text: Behind Jon sit Nana, Baraque and Clara in all their
text: compelling, alarming, silent, intense other-
dialog: worldliness.
text: And in the back, still wearing his FAKE HEAD, is Frank.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

text: Silence resumes.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTORWAY - AFTERNOON

scene_heading: EXT. FERRY PORT - EVENING

text: is loading onto a Ferry.
scene_heading: EXT. FERRY PORT - PASSPORT CONTROL HUT - EVENING
text: Through the fog we see the band showing their passports
text: to two OFFICERS. They reach Frank. They stare at his
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: FRANK

text: His accent is American. The officers lead him inside
dialog: the hut.
scene_heading: EXT. FERRY - EVENING

speaker_heading: DON

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: What do you think of Frank?
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: Um...
text: Jon and Don glance over at Frank. He’s sitting on a
text: bench on deck. Clara is, as always, at his side. Frank
text: is smoking a cigarette, using a long cigarette holder
text: that curls under the head’s neckline.
text: He finishes his cigarette, pulls it out of the holder,
text: and tosses the butt away. It catches in the North Sea
text: wind and flies back into his head.
text: Frank and Clara frantically pat down his ‘face’ to stop
text: a fire from breaking out.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: He's fucking amazing isn’t he?
dialog: He lives all the way out there,
dialog: man.
text: Don indicates the infinite, black sea, stretching out
dialog: beyond them.
speaker_heading: DON (CONT'D)
dialog: In the furthest corners. I wanna

speaker_heading: JON

speaker_heading: DON

text: Jon thinks about this, impressed.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: Never?
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Never.
speaker_heading: JON

speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JON

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: What kind of liquid food?
speaker_heading: DON

speaker_heading: JON

speaker_heading: DON

speaker_heading: JON

dialog: pretty crazy, isn’t it?
text: He laughs nervously.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: I understand. But let me tell

dialog: his ‘issues’, is without a doubt
dialog: the most one hundred percent

speaker_heading: JON
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Believe it. (Beat) Me, on the

speaker_heading: JON
dialog: Oh, well... you seem pretty sane
dialog: to me!
text: Don nods, stares out at the sea, smiling.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Yeah. (Beat) But no, seriously,

text: Jon is in the back, next to Frank, who appears to be
text: snoozing.
text: Clara and Nana and Baraque are all asleep in the front.
text: Jon nervously glances over at Frank’s head. He

text: As he looks closer he suddenly notices an EYEBALL
text: staring out at him through the EAR HOLE.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: (Shrieking)
dialog: Jesus Christ!
text: The eye vanishes, retreating back into the darkness of
dialog: the head.

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Tsss.
text: Frank is indicating that Jon gets closer. Jon does.

speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: HELP ME.

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (Energized)
dialog: I never felt better in my life.

dialog: Snow.
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: JON

text: Jon indicates the head.
speaker_heading: JON (CONT'D)
dialog: The... big false head?
text: Frank continues to stare. Jon looks suddenly worried
text: that Frank may not even know that he’s wearing a false
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: JON (CONT'D)
dialog: (Panicking a bit)
dialog: Okay. Too many questions. What
dialog: we need to do is work out the

speaker_heading: JON (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’m sorry?
speaker_heading: JON

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (Sounding nervous)
dialog: It’s all I have.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: It’s not much. Have you got a
dialog: cashpoint card?
text: Frank nervously shakes his head no.
text: They emerge from the woods and enter the...
scene_heading: EXT. BARE MOTORWAY SERVICE AREA - CONTINUOUS
text: It’s just a toilet and a coffee/snack stand on a lay-

speaker_heading: JON (V.O.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: TRUCKER

speaker_heading: FRANK

dialog: Sometimes he seems friendly.
text: Frank slips into the shadows.
speaker_heading: JON (V.0.)
dialog: But at other times more
dialog: ..-menacing...
text: Frank reappears in the doorway. Something in his body

dialog: him off.
text: Don is almost at the river when Clara stoops from

speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: All bumpy and holes and I mean

scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - DAY
text: The band have set up by the lake.

text: The band begin to play Puff the Magic Dragon...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (Singing)
dialog: Puff the Magic Dragon, lived by
dialog: the sea, and frolicked in the

text: Jon hears a PING coming from the iPhone in his hand. One
dialog: new email.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: (Singing)
dialog: Little Jackie Paper loved that
dialog: rascal puff, and brought him
text: strings and sealing wax and other
dialog: fancy stuff.
dialog: Jon is torn between wanting to maintain an appropriate

speaker_heading: CLARA

speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: You spied on us?
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: No. Yes. But that’s not the point.

speaker_heading: JON (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: LATER
text: The sex is over. Jon and Clara lie naked amid the

speaker_heading: CLARA

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don, I remember you saying that

dialog: Sea World, San Diego. And I know
dialog: you were homesick, Don. I know
dialog: there were times you wanted to
dialog: come back here, but you didn’t
dialog: because of me. Well you’re home
dialog: now Don. And we’re going to make
dialog: sure that those sacrifices you
dialog: made weren’t in vain. It’s your
dialog: album we recorded Don - and we’re
dialog: going to share it with the world.

text: It’s a down-at heel place in a Houston suburban strip.
text: Baraque, beard gone, head shaved, is busy shaving the

speaker_heading: THE WINGS

speaker_heading: FRANK

dialog: to know. That we have found the
dialog: music that will change everything.
text: The band look determined, almost grim. They march out

text: They glance at each other, understanding the huge
text: significance of the moment. Nana and Baraque begin to
text: play. After a moment Clara and Jon join in.
text: Frank stands in the wings, listening. And very slowly his

text: As the head reaches MAXIMUM ILLUMINATION he BOUNDS OUT
text: onto the stage, jerking and shuffling to the beat.
text: He sings.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: JON (CONT'D)
dialog: Frank?
text: Frank holds his hand out to hush Jon. A silence. Frank is
text: silently composing.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (with great import)
dialog: I think I’m writing my most
dialog: likeable song ever.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Can we hear it?
text: Clara looks like she wants to kill Jon.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - HOTEL - LATE AT NIGHT
text: Frank sits at the keyboard. The rest of the band gather
text: in readiness to hear Frank’s most likeable song ever. Jon
text: films the scene on his iPhone.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’ve always dreamed that one day
dialog: I’d have a band member who shared
dialog: my vision of creating extremely
dialog: likeable music. So thank you, Jon.
dialog: You gave me the little push I
dialog: needed. Okay. Enough chatter. Here
dialog: it is. My most likeable song ever.
text: Frank begins to play.
dialog: Bang! Bang! Bang! It's the same glorious, strange,
dialog: ridiculous, totally non-mainstream stuff that Frank has
text: always played. The madder end, in fact, of his oeuvre.
text: Frank finishes. A beat.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: This is your most likeable song?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yes.
text: Clara doesn’t show a thing on her face.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: People will love it.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: (Clearing his throat)
dialog: Actually, Frank, I think we can
dialog: push the likability even further.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No way! You’re shitting me. (Beat)
dialog: HOW?
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - EDGE OF TOWN - DAY
text: The band has gathered with their instruments. Jon has got
text: hold of some VIDEO EQUIPMENT. He’s standing behind the
dialog: camera.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (To Jon)
dialog: Let me see if I got this right.
dialog: You want us to make a video in
dialog: which we pretend our music doesn’t
dialog: matter so the people here who act
dialog: like babies won’t be scared of us.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: No. Well, sort of. Look. You know
text: the crazy person on the bus that
dialog: nobody wants to sit next to?
dialog: That’s us. But if we just lighten
dialog: up... be a tiny bit more likeably
dialog: self-aware...
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I’m not playing a fucking ukulele,
dialog: I’1l tell you that now.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’m going to point at my head a

text: Frank dances around a little too over-zealously, pointing
text: at his head.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: (As he dances)
dialog: Press record, Jon. I’m ready.
text: Jon presses record on his video camera and hurries over
text: to take his place behind the keyboard.
text: They start playing a MORE HIPSTER version of one of their
dialog: songs.
text: Everything is a little different. Frank’s voice and dance
text: seem more IRONIC. Jon has a new, ironic, keyboard sound.
text: And hipster sunglasses. Baraque and Nana are dutifully
text: going along with it - their bass and percussion are more
text: unvarying than normal.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Only Clara is holding out. She has adopted her most
text: intimidating scowl, and is playing as HARSHLY as she can
text: muster. But her protest is useless. Jon has managed to
dialog: make them sound likeable rather than alarmingly
dialog: experimental.
text: The overall effect - seeing the band like this - is both
text: likeable but also strangely sad.
text: The song reaches an instrumental section. Frank addresses
dialog: the camera.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: (Talking too fast)
dialog: Hi, South By Southwest. We’re the

speaker_heading: HIPSTER GIRL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: CLARA

speaker_heading: JON

speaker_heading: JON
text: He looks pretty happy to me.
dialog: Whereas you seem...
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: (Coldly)

speaker_heading: JON (CONT'D)
dialog: Gosh. You've run out of insults?
speaker_heading: LATER

speaker_heading: JON (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JON (CONT'D)
dialog: Have you seen Frank?
speaker_heading: BARAQUE
dialog: (In French,

speaker_heading: JON

scene_heading: HIPSTER PASSER-BY

speaker_heading: JON
dialog: (Beat)

speaker_heading: JON

dialog: She’s the one who’s nuts, Frank.
dialog: Not you. You’re fine!
text: Frank breaks free of Clara. He walks towards Jon.
speaker_heading: JON (CONT'D)
dialog: You know it. You told me yourself
text: that Clara is crazy. She kidnaps
dialog: you and she’s very weird and
dialog: doesn’t want you to have fans.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Remember what things were like at
text: Vetno, Frank. There was no stress.
dialog: Everything was good there.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: At this, Frank suddenly stops, midway between Jon and
text: Clara. He glances from one to the other, not knowing
dialog: which one to go to.
speaker_heading: CLARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Everything was quiet and good at
dialog: Vetno, Frank. Don’t you remember?
dialog: Let’s go back there.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: See! She wants to keep you locked
dialog: up like at Vetno. She’s just weird
dialog: and jealous.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: You’re out of your depth, Jon.
dialog: Frank. You’re not well. We need to
dialog: be somewhere quiet. Just us.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: Tomorrow night is everything we've
dialog: worked for! They’re ready to love

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Clara.

speaker_heading: JON

speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (Calling)
dialog: You win. Well done.

speaker_heading: JON

speaker_heading: CLARA

scene_heading: JON'S P.O.V - from the floor.

speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Frank.
text: A PASSER-BY grabs her.

speaker_heading: JON (V.0.)

speaker_heading: JON
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: No I wouldn’t have.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: Because you look inside of

speaker_heading: JON
dialog: Yes I can.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: So your only hope is to live off

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: JON
dialog: Actually can I just...?

scene_heading: EXT. TEXAS DESERT - LATER

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: JON
dialog: Be quiet. I’m trying to hear

speaker_heading: JON (CONT'D)
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: I can’t hear anything.
dialog: (And then,
dialog: terrified)

scene_heading: INT. KITCHENETTE - MOTEL ROOM - SOME WEEKS LATER
text: Frank and Jon are eating at the tiny table. Jon is

text: He leans back. Then he leans forward to the straw
text: again. He clinks his head against the light again.
text: Another ding.

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh Jesus I’m sorry.

speaker_heading: JON

speaker_heading: JON (CONT'D)
