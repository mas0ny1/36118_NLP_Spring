speaker_heading: SUZANNE
dialog: Send me your soul. Come to me NOW!
text: The ferocious WIND HOWLS. Trees bend. The sky darkens.. SUZANNE'S hood is whipped of her

scene_heading: ANGLE - THE GADEN BEYOND THE PORCH
text: Thick. Lush. Huge flowers flourish. A flagstone walk leads to a swimming pool filled with

speaker_heading: CARLOTTA
dialog: (dry. caustic)
dialog: Well, well, Deedee. Both your admirers have paid a call.
text: CARLOTTA looks down at the huge beetle -- and crushes it with her shoe. The BREEZE dies. The

dialog: death is not the preferable alternative.
dialog: (softening. a grin)
dialog: I'm in the life business - remember..?
text: H musters a weak smile. Tugs at his gloves. She rises.
speaker_heading: ROWAN

dialog: Let's see what we can find out-
scene_heading: EXT. A BOAT DOCK. DAY - AN HOUR LATER
text: ROWAN and MICHAEL walk down toward her boat. She glances at his gloves.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps
dialog: pouring into my head- (stark) It won't go away God - if I
dialog: could just understand it.
text: They step onto the boat's deck. ROWAN walks to the spot where she revived him, and kneels.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: You had no pulse-.. You were gone.
text: MICHAEL - tightly-wound - kneels beside her. Squeezes his eyes shut- A deep sigh.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Don't be afraid, Michael.
text: Her tone - and the use at his name - opens his eyes. An electritied sock between them. He
text: peels his gloves off steels himself, flattens his palms on the deck - and waits...
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: What do you see...?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (his face is a blank)
dialog: Nothing. Absolutely nothing-
scene_heading: EXT. AN OUTDOOR DECK. DAY - LATER

scene_heading: A KITCHEN-LlVING ROOM AREA
text: Rustic, unadorned. Half-walled by the glass doors. MICHAEL sits at a choppinq-block island,
text: and scares at his gloved hands- ROWAN pours him a scotch and sits across from him.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
text: Just one. The bar's closed.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (gulps down the drink)
dialog: The one time I want it to work...
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (bristles)
dialog: You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...?
dialog: My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved
dialog: brain - and nobody -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: No. I'm not.
dialog: (a beat- enigmatic)
dialog: Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about
dialog: some things.
text: MICHAEL nods in surprise. He tries to pull a cigarette from his pack, his gloved fingers
text: fumbling. ROWAN reaches out and stills his hand with hers. She takes out a cigarette, puts it
text: in his lips - and lights it. Their eyes lock.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Touch me.
dialog: (MICHAEL'S brow creases)
dialog: My hands were all over you. Maybe something will come from
dialog: me.
dialog: (soft. soothing)

speaker_heading: ROWAN'S VOICE (OC)
dialog: OWWWWWWW....!
text: SUDDENLY BACK TO ROWAN'S KITCHEN
text: as ROWAN - with a yelp - wrenches her hands free or MICHAEL'S vise girp. He tumbles backwards
text: onto the floor. ROWAN races round to him and kneels - cradling his head geritly
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (eyes opening- weakly)
dialog: My gloves...
text: She grabs them, and slips them on his hands. Her lush hair is tussled by a stadden BREEZE that
text: blows in from the deck.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (softly. awestruck)
dialog: I saw it. On the boat, I was - dead. (pause) you brought
dialog: me back...
text: Enongh electricity to light a city. He takes her hands gently in his.. -
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: ...with these.
text: The BREEZE sends some papers into the air. ROWAN bends to him. Their lips meet in a soft brush
text: or a kiss - and then the gates open. Lips searching- hands tearing at clothes. Limbs

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You knelt there, helpless- You couldn't save him. (pause)
dialog: There was so such anger in you-. Death infuriates you...
text: she puts her head back down on his chest. A long beat.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: It's unbelievable that you can do that.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

dialog: 'somebody dreamed them up, put something where there was nothing...'
dialog: it amazed me.
text: He turns to ROWAN, who suns herself on her back on the dock.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: My mother and I used to take long walks and make up

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Too much... too fast...?
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Mm-hmm. (pause) Scared- I feel a little like the moth
dialog: and the flame.
dialog: MICHAEL (a beat. softly)

text: checking for a pulse. She puts her ear to CARLOTTA's chest... she's dead. ROWAN stares in
text: horror --- then something shifts in her face. Something unknowable suddenly known. Suddenly
dialog: believed.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: You're here.
text: SILENCE. She walks slowly down the hall past the portraits. Stopping with her back to a huge
text: mirror in an ornate frame.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: I know you're here. (pause) You killed her, didn't you... (pause)
dialog: Come out, you bastard!
text: Behind her, in the mirror - a foggy phantasm drifts across the glass - and is gone. ROWAN
text: looks down. At her feet is the emerald pendant. She picks it up. OC, down the hall - the

speaker_heading: THE LIVING ROOM
text: Dust and decay. Cracked leather chairs. A chadelier of a hundred cut-glass pieces. Does it

speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: What did she call you --- Lasher...?
text: She whirls round. There in the corner -
text: the shimering, transparent specter - handsom, angular. Rowan is stunned - but still. They eye
dialog: each other.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: What are you...?
text: The specter flickers - and disappears. Sfle dashes to where it was... And then --- hands are
text: clutching; her from behind. She SHRIEKS --- she is twisted round --- and she looks into
text: MICHAEL'S face - and violently clings to him.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What is it...?! Tell me!
text: She tries to find words. suddenly - her head swivels from here to there - looking round the
dialog: room...
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: There's something - someone --- here.
text: He stiffens - and glances round the room
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Where's Carlotta...?
text: ROWAN shivers - and slowly, she points to the hall. He takes her hand. she's like a mule.

speaker_heading: THE DARK HALL
text: and down to the foot of the stairs. There lies CARLOTTA. MICHAEL stares drop-jawed.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Jesus christ...

speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: But how did - how could you ---

text: the steps... closer... And - something LEAPS out at that trot the DARK...
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Michael...!
text: MICHAEL swings lethally - and the cat soars past him - YEEOWWLLL! - and scampers away. They

dialog: You know...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (a slow nod)
dialog: I know. It's not possible --- but I know.

dialog: Michael - I saw him! Twice!
dialog: (a long beat. very softly)
dialog: Carlotta said I --- killed Graham - with - with my anger.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with

speaker_heading: ROWAN

speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Then what is he...?
speaker_heading: AARON
text: A spacial entity. An organized energy. something that precedes

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: A what...?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: A spirit. Perhaps evil... (to ROWAN) ...and he has come to you-
dialog: with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
text: Both Men stare at her.
speaker_heading: ROWAN

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

text: She gives him a kiss.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Wanna snack...?
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: A little wine...?
text: And he leaves. ROWAN smiles to herself - and starts brushing her hair. She picks up a hand
text: mirror to see the results... LASHER'S face locks back at her, just over her sholder. She jumps
text: a mile - whirls round... There is no one there. She slowly looks back to the mirror - there is
text: his reflection again, with his melancholy smile. Her face hardens.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: I am with you. (pause) You yearn to know me - so I am with you.
dialog: you call me --- and I love you all the more for that.
dialog: (gentle. poignant)
dialog: I know how the desert flower feels when it drinks of the rain.

text: out of the mirror and frame her face. caressing her.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: You do not love Michael How can you love - if you lie...?
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Lie...?
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: There are things you will not tell him.

text: fingers caress a breast...
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Michael is healing. If I hide things from him - it's because love him.
dialog: LASHER takes this in. Does he smile...?
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: Then you will lie to him about me - won't you...?

text: Suddenly the glass SHATTERS - piece falling to the floor.
speaker_heading: LASHER'S VOICE
dialog: You grow stronger...
text: And a spectral image of MICHAEL rises in slivers from the scattered chards - 1ike a shredded,

scene_heading: LASHER'S VOICE (IN MICHAEL'S FORM)

text: MICHAEL COMES THROUGH THE DOORWAY

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (chewing. bad French accent)
text: A chardonnay, mademoiselle - pleasantly mild, but pretentious.
text: ROWAN stares at him - between two worlds. He sees the shattered glass - and comes to her. Her

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hey - you're bleeding.
speaker_heading: ROWAN

text: MICHAEL'S face...
text: MICHAEL opens his eyes --- LASHER is gone. MICHAEL puts on his coat - and walks out...

speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
speaker_heading: GIFFORD

scene_heading: INT. THE MAYFAIR MANSION - THE MAIN HALL. MOMENTS LATER

scene_heading: EXT. THE MAYFAIR MANSION. LATER THAT AFTERNOON
text: As the guests go home, ROWAN and ARRON lean on the porch railing, watching MICHAEL on the

speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Yes - I do trust you.
speaker_heading: ARRON
dialog: Your powers are growing. Rowan. I wasn't even that focused.
text: She looks at him. Their eyes lock. Her face sobers at what she senses.

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Lasher will act, Rowan. Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three
dialog: hundred years to have it. (pause) facing him alone... I don't like -
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (adamant)
dialog: Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's. (pause) Aaron, I've seen the
dialog: pain in Michael. I can't bear to see anymore. (Pause) He's not to
dialog: know. Swear to me.
text: AARON stares back. - and finally nods. they watch MICHAEL walk along the outside of the

speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Aaron - I really could protect him - if...it I had to.
text: Watching MICHAEL, AARON reaches out and takes her hand.
scene_heading: EXT. BAYOU COUNTRY. LATER THAT AFTERNOON
text: A small highway- The late sun filters through the thick, mossy trees on either side. Water
text: shimers in the BG. A Mercedes coupe zooms INTO FAME! and speeds away.
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE CAR
text: ROWAN is at the wheel, with MICHAEL beside her.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL

scene_heading: INT. THE NEWLYWEDS' HOTEL ROOM. THAT NIGHT
text: MICHAEL, in silk pajama slacks, and his gloves, sits on the edge ot the bed- ROWAN stands
text: before him in a sheer robe. Cool, seductive. She unties the robe's sash, and it slips to the
text: floor. The moonlight washes over her body.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (soft. but al,ost.a command)
dialog: I'm yours now - completely... I want your touch. (pause) Try,
dialog: Michael. Don't let anything else in.
text: Her face shines with passion and power. She peels his gloves off - places his hands on her -
text: and buries his face against her. He hesitates, then starts exploring her with his hands.
text: She pushes him back onto the bed. A slow, sexual ballet begins - and escalates. she straddles
text: him - and mounts him. Gazing down at him, she slides into a slow, thick rhthym. Her eyes
text: close. A MOAN slips from her.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Yes, Michael. Harder--.
text: (MICHAEL shifts into a faster gear)
dialog: More...
speaker_heading: LASHER (UNSEEN)
dialog: Like this...?
text: She stiffens - her eyes pop open.
text: LASHER - spectral, his nakedness flickering - appears, wrapped round her trorn behind. His face
text: against her flushed cheek - his body moving. getting her back into her myths
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (between passion and fear)

text: LASHER strokes her roughly - perfectly...
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: Like no other...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Jesus...
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: STOP!
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: Always loved you..
text: The bodies move like a fierce machine. ROWAN'S climax takes her to speechlessness... She
text: collapses onto MICHAEL. The lovers lie still and silent. LASHER is gone.
scene_heading: INT. THE HOTEL ROOM. THE NEXT MORNING
text: MICHAEL and ROWAN in bed, asleep. He wakes with a sleepy smile and reaches out to her... she
dialog: wakes with a jolt -
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hi. I'm Michael curry. your husband...?
text: ROWAN focuses on him - getting her bearings... His hand slides under the covers to her body.
text: She stops him.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (almost hard)
dialog: No. (softens...) Not - not now.
text: She pulls the covers up over her. His grin shows.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: When you get married, I thought the sex stopped after the
dialog: honeymoon...

speaker_heading: ROWAN
text: opens an eye, listening to him leave. she closes her eyes...
scene_heading: EXT. THE NEWLYWEDS' BAYOU COTTAGE PATIO. DAY
text: ROWAN lies in a lounge chaise, eyes closed. She looks under the weather. MICHAEL sits next to

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You look a little green.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (eyes closed. flat)
dialog: Mm-hmmm...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Mm-hmm...
text: He grins. Sketching quickly now, finishing. He holds up it is a goofy caricature of ROWAN:
text: gap-toothed, freckled, cross-eyed, with pigtails going out at angles.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: So - you like your portrait...?
text: ROWAN - eyes closed - gives the slightest of nods. MICHAEL smiles mischievously.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Gee - look at that. I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Mm-hmm...
text: Suddenly - her eyes pop open. She shoots up -
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Alligator...?
text: MICHAEL grins - lies back down - and closes his eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. A BAYOU GAS STATION IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. NIGHT
text: The pumps - old with faded paint. The 'office' - a weathered shack. on the porch, an OLD MAN
text: sits in the shadows with an accordion, playing an eerie tune. A funky pick-up truck is parked
text: off to the side. The Mercedes pulls in at the pumps.
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE CAR
text: MICHAEL and ROWAN wait for service. He honks the horn.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: Everybody must be out back sacrificing a virgin to the crocodile
dialog: god.

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Excuse me..
text: (taps the OLD MAN on the shoulder)
dialog: I'm trying to find -
text: The OLD MAN turns round - half his face is a mass of ancient scars -. thick and deep - winding
text: all the way down his neck. MICHAEL reflexively rears back stunned. the OLD MAN smiles.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Jesus stopped here once - for directions.
text: And out of the office comes an ATTENDANT - 50, greasy overalls, a friendly grin.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Gator got him nice, huh mister...?
text: MICHAEL stares at the OLD MAN. And then - the ATTENANT sees the Mercedes. His eyes widen.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Jesus St. Cracker! Look at that beauty!
text: He walks to the car, circling it, admiring it. He smiles in at ROWAN. Two MEN - 30's, jeans
text: and t-shirts - come out of the office, and stand, arms folded, staring at the car. The
text: ATTENDANT leans in a window, eyeing the car's interior.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: We on the right road to the Cajun Kitchen...?
text: The two MEN get into the pick-up truck and drive off.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: See ya later. boys (to MICHAEL) Y'know, I buy American - every
dialog: time. Hell, it's the right thing to do but nobody ever built a car like
text: them Nazis. (pause) keep going two miles Kitchen's on the left.
text: MICHAEL gets in the car. Turns the ignition - and stares over at the OLD MAN, sitting
text: motionless. The ATTENDANT pats the car - and the Mercedes pulls away. The OLD MAN starts
text: playtng the slow, soft tune again.
scene_heading: EXT. A SMALL DARK ROAD. MINUTES LATER

dialog: (grins. turns to her)
dialog: Did you see the old man on the ---
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (straightening up. eye. widening)
dialog: Michael!
text: MICHAEL locks back to the road. The pick-up truck is stopptd in the middle of the road.
text: MICHAEL jams on the brakes and skids to a stop. Then - from outside the window - CLICK.
text: MICHAEL turns - and stares down the barre1 of a shotgun held in the hands of grinning MAN # 1.
speaker_heading: MAN # 1
dialog: You two lovebirds wanna step outside...?
text: MAN # 2 appears at ROWAN'S door - and opens it for her. ROWAN and MICHAEL exchange looks -
text: and step out onto the road, on opposite sides of the car.
speaker_heading: MAN # 2
dialog: I'll bet somebody owns a car like that carries a let o' cash.
speaker_heading: MAN # 1
dialog: Yup. Lots.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (simmering. deadpan)
dialog: That's smart thinking. Tell me - which one of you got to use the brain
dialog: tonight...?
text: MAN # l's grin evaporates. He shoves MICHAEL with the gun.
speaker_heading: MAN # 1
dialog: Give me your wallet, asshole!
text: MICHAEL glares at him.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Michael - give him the money!
text: MICHAEL digs out his wallet and hands it to MAN # 1.
speaker_heading: MAN # 1
dialog: Now wasn't that easy... ? You should try harder at being a help,
dialog: Michael.
speaker_heading: MAN # 2
dialog: That's probably what she, says - "Try harder, Michael." Right.
dialog: Sammy.
speaker_heading: MAN # 1
dialog: (a lewd chuckle)
dialog: Yeah. "Harder. Michael. Harder."
text: His words make ROWAN'S eyes widen. MAN # 2 runs his hand across ROWAN'S cheek. She stiffens.
text: He hooks his arm round her neck, drawing her face to him roughly.
speaker_heading: MAN # 2
dialog: That what you tell him, hon...?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Get your goddamn hands -
text: MAN # 1 slams MICHAEL against the car. MAN # 2 locks ROWAN in a grubby kiss. She is solid
text: stone. Her eyes focused on MAN # 2 like a gunsight. Suddenly - he breaks off the kiss - and
text: releases her. Staring at her weirdly.
speaker_heading: MAN # 1
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Shit, Rollie - she give you a shock...?
text: MAN # 2 steps back from ROWAN, his face twisting up. wincing. Something is happening...
text: ROWAN glares at him like a beacon.
speaker_heading: MAN # 1
dialog: (his smile fades)
dialog: Rollie. . .? Hey, man...
text: MAN # 2 goes down on one knee, hands going to his head. MAN # 1 comes over to him - his alarm
dialog: growing-.
speaker_heading: MAN # 1
dialog: Hey - what's witb you, man...?
text: MAN # 2 groans and falls to the ground. writhing in the glare of the car's headlights, a
text: trickle of blood at his nose. MAN # 1 whirls on ROWAN with the shotgun.
speaker_heading: MAN # 1
dialog: What the fuck's going on...?! what'd you do to him,
dialog: lady...?!
text: MICHAEL leaps to the hood - takes MAN # 1 down with a flying tackle - grabs the shotgun and
text: knocks him cold with the butt. He whirls to ROWAN -
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Get in the car!!
dialog: (ROWAN is entranced)
dialog: Rowan!!!
text: She's in another world. He shoves her inside - dives in his side - screeches into reverse,
text: does a 180 and speeds away.
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE CAR
text: MICHAEL - freaked - driving like a bat out of hell. ROWAN slumps in her seat, slowly coming
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (revving. blown away)
dialog: Jesus fucking Christ!!! That was you, wasn't it...?! ROWAN!
dialog: (she is silent. hazy)
dialog: But it wasn't like Graham - or Carlotta not blind fury. This time
dialog: you controlled it, didn't You...?!!! Didn't you...?! ROWAN...?!!
dialog: Goddamnit, ANSWER ME!!!
text: She slowly turns to him - her face white and haggard.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (flat. faraway)
dialog: Yes.
text: He stares at her - silent in the face of her power.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MAYFAIR MANSION. LATE NIGHT
text: The Mercedes pulls up and parks. MICHAEL gets out, dishevelled, scraped up. ROWN gets out her

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: No. (pause) This is unreal...
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: It's not some fairytale in an old book. (pause) Michael -

dialog: I didn't choose this, Michael. This is who I am.
dialog: (deeply. poignantly)
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I love you too.
text: A long beat. They walk to the dark house and enter. A light comes on. STU comes sleepily

speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What are you doing here...?

scene_heading: INT. THE OPERATING ROOM IN ROWAN'S DREAM

speaker_heading: ROWAN

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: That's cause we're below sea level.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL

dialog: ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
speaker_heading: ROWAN

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (sings - half to himself)
dialog: 'I left my heart in Ran Sanfisco...
text: ROWAN glances at the fireplace - with an almost mischievous look. She focuses on the logs -

speaker_heading: A FLAME

speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (looks up innocently)

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Stop doing that! If I've something to say, let me say it - out

speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (grins)
dialog: I'm serious. (in earnest) Whatever it was - it's still there
dialog: inside me, isn't it - change and all...?
text: MICHAEL hesitates - and nods. He slowly grins.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Just do me a favor. Don't start anymore fires - or turn on the
dialog: lights by blinking - or cook with your hands behind your -
dialog: And suddenly -
text: the blaze silently erupts from the fireplace - becoming a demonic, fiery virsion of LASHER - a
text: mass of jagged, leaping flames - and hovers over them, unseen by MICHAEL. ROWAN'S eyes bulge
text: - and she wraps her arm. tightly - glaring furiously at the flaming specter. LASHER dissolves
text: into a thousand flames - and disappears. MICHAEL separates himself fram her - startled.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What the hall are you -
text: And she pulls him back to her - and holds him tight.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (shaking with emotion)
dialog: I love you more than anything in the world, Michael.
dialog: (glances at the room)
dialog: More than anything.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MAYFAIR MANSION. DAY - A WEEK LATER
text: MICHAEL AND STU are high up on ladders fitting and hammering copper flashing along the eaves.
text: They don't see ROWAN come through the gate and up the walk.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (singing)
dialog: 'There is a house in xew Orleans...'
dialog: BZZZZZ...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL & STU
dialog: '...they call the Rising Sun...'
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (looks down)
dialog: Is that a crack about our singing...?
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Is that what you were doing...?
text: MICHAEL grins - and goes back to hammering. WHACK! WHACK!
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (brimming with excitment)
dialog: Michael, I spoke to the geneticist from Stanford, and she -
text: And - a rung of MICHAELS ladder cracks. He falls grabbing at air --- and finally grabs on to
text: a rung hanging suspended --- twisting. Nobody breathes and he finally gets his footing.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Goddamn sonuvabitch!
text: Sighs of relief all around. He climbs down. BZZZZZ...
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: You alright...?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: A little sore. Darm... (to STU) Finish up my section, will ya...?
text: STU nods - and leans to the spot where Michael was working.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
speaker_heading: (to ROWAN)
dialog: You were saying...?
scene_heading: ABOVE THEM - STU POUNDS THE FLASHING
text: WHACK! something drops free from beneath the eaves - grey, round - like a huge melon with
text: ridges - landing in front of him on the gutter. BZZZZZZZ... Two, black antennae wiggle out of
text: a crack in the sphere...
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (softly - with realization)
dialog: Oh shit...
text: The sphere splits open - and dozens and dozens of WASPS swarm out - a black cloud enveloping
text: him... He screams - topples tram the ladder - and lands with THUD. ROWAN and MICHAEL rush to
text: him. STU lies motionless...
scene_heading: INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM. EVENING - TWO HOURS LATER
text: ROWAN and MICHAEL sit at STU'S bedside. STU sleeps - his arm in a cast - his face and hands
text: swollen beyond recognition. MICHAEL shakes his head sadly, steeped in grief.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Is he - is he gonna die...?
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (her eyes locked on STU)
dialog: Lock the door.
text: (MICHAEL looks at her - confused)
dialog: Lock it
text: He rises and locks the door. Then turns and watches, silent.
text: ROWAN is still. Her eyes narrow into slits of concentration. The air seems to shimmer around
text: her. She leans to STU - to his grotesque swollen lips. She closes her eyes - and kisses
text: him... STU'S deformed face shimmers - the angry flesh lightens... and slowly, it shrinks back
text: to his normal visage.
text: ROWAN' opens her eyes - and slowly turns to MICHAEL, who stands flattened against the wall,
text: speechless, amazed. She turns back to STU, grasps his disfigured hand, brings his fingers to
text: her lips - and kisses them., one by one...
scene_heading: INT. THE MANSION - A FIRST FLOOR ROOM. LATER THAT NIGHT
text: The room is unfinished. There is a bed and a dresser. MICHAEL sits on the bed, staring at the
text: floor. ROWAN - in a robe - sits beside him.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: It was an accident.
text: (MICHAEL raises a skeptical eyebrow)
dialog: Michael - there isn't a house in New Orleans this old that doesn't
dialog: have a wasp's nest somewhere.
text: He stares at her - unconvinced. She tries for logical -
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I don't know.
text: He lies back and turns off the light. DARKNESS. She lies beside him, reaches out and finds his
text: hand. A long beat.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You changed him, Rowan. You went right down to each cell - and
dialog: changed him.
text: They lie there silently.
scene_heading: INT. THE BEDROOM. LATER THAT NIGHT
text: MICHAEL sleeps. ROWAN lies beside him, staring out the window. A BREEZE whistles. she rises
text: and walks out of the room - down the hallway - out the front door and down into
speaker_heading: THE GARDEN
text: She stares at the sky. There is a bright moon, but no stars.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: 'A moon, but no stars...'
text: The trees and bushes sway in the BREEZE.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you
dialog: can control, isn't there? The great and powerful lasher - undone by
dialog: a faulty ladder-..
speaker_heading: (SILENCE)
dialog: Why would you hurt him...?! Answer me.
speaker_heading: LASHER (UNSEEN)
dialog: I 1ove you, Rowan. I've always loved you.
dialog: (ROWAN whirls around)
dialog: I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your
dialog: thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: YOU VIOLATED ME!!! ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
speaker_heading: LASHER (UNSEEN)
dialog: (curious. sincere)
dialog: Explain this to me --- violated...?
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: You bastard...
text: The BREEZE blows stronger. A huge flower drops at her feet.
speaker_heading: LASHER (UNSEEN)
dialog: I made it for you.
text: ROWAN bends and picks up the bizarre flower- Intrigued.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Made it...?
speaker_heading: LASHER (UNSEEN)
dialog: It is from love.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: To love, you must be able to feel.
speaker_heading: LASHER (UNSEEN)
dialog: If you knew how I yearn for that...
text: And --- there in the moonlight, LASHER materializes. Shimmering. Transparent. Spectral.
dialog: Beautiful. Melancholy.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like
dialog: breeres that blow through me. Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine
dialog: to feel...
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (to be reckoned with)
dialog: It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose. And you will feel that.
dialog: Do you understand...?
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: (chastened. softly)
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (a long beat)
dialog: My love is as strong as Michael's. How is it there is love in you for
dialog: one - and not for another...?
text: She is stunned by the depth of his question. He smiles.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: You're very clever, aren't you...?
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: I am only what you are --- what all of you have been. (pause) what
dialog: do you think of yourself now, my love...?
text: She stares at the flower. Feeling its texture. Smelling it.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: How much of it is me - alone and how much is you...?
dialog: (LASHER flickers...)
dialog: Lasher --- what do you want...?
text: And he DISSOLVES nothing. She looks at the flower. It starts to shrivel - and disintegrates
text: in her fingers.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO
scene_heading: EXT. THE MAYFAIR MANSION. WEEKS LATER - DAY
text: The house is closer to renovation's end than the beginning.
scene_heading: INT. THE MAYFAIR MANSION - DIEDRE'S ROOM. SAME TIME
text: The room is almost done. MICHAEL stands at the empty window frames. gloveless, with a sketch
text: pad. BZZZ-KPIT... he cocks his head - and looks over at the toy chest. He walks to the chest,
text: opens it. and takes out the marionette. It dangles from his hand, twirling slowly.
text: MICHAEL eyes it closely - his face suddenly creasing --- The marionette looks like MICHAEL -
text: it's dressed like him and it is wearing gloves.
speaker_heading: LASHER'S VOICE!
dialog: I love the room, Michael.
text: And - the marionette starts to grow... MICHAEL drops it in terror - it keeps growing - till it
text: is life-size, it's body clattering as it jerks about like a huge, wooden puppet-version of
speaker_heading: MICHAEL.
speaker_heading: THE MARIONETTE
dialog: Michael - you've forgotten your gloves. Better off with them on,
dialog: don't you think...? (pause) Here...
text: And with a monstrous LAUGH, the MARIONETTE pulls off a glove - and his hand comes with it.
text: Blood spurts from the wrist... The other glove flies off, with the same result.
text: MICHAEL stumbles back, flailing at the muck. The MARIONETTE clatters to the floor in a zillion
text: sparks of dust. The disembodied, gloved hands lie twitching. And -
text: they mutate. Bubbling, turning scabrous. Claws sprout from the fingers. They become monstrous
text: crabs with human eyes scuttling along the floor toward MICHAEL... At his feet now - climbing up
text: his legs - up his chest MICHAEL swats them to the floor - and stomps on them, again and again
dialog: and again. turning them to pulp...
speaker_heading: ROWAN (CC)
dialog: What're you drawing...?
text: MICHAEL IS STANDING FROZEN AT THE WINDOW
text: pad and pencil still in his hand. ROWAN comes INTO FRAME. He turns - in the ozone. She looks
text: at the pad. He has sketched the marionette, dangling from a disembodied hand.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: That's really good.
dialog: (a beat. she sighs)
dialog: I have to go mleet Bea for lunch now.
dialog: (MICAEL is frozen)
dialog: I feel so had for her- There's still no word on Gifford-
text: she's a wreck.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (soft. fuzzy)
dialog: Give her my best.
text: Rowan' cocks her head at him - leans and gives a quick kiss and leaves. He looks down at the
text: sketch and stares silently.
scene_heading: EXT. THE FRENCH MARKET. AFTERNOON
text: An outdoor bazaar. An old BLACK MAN, cataracts fogging his eyes, plays guitar while a BLACK
text: BOY tap-dances beside him.
scene_heading: ROWAN AND BEATRICE SIT IN AN OPEN PATIO CAFE
text: BEATRICE has a beer and a huge plate of oysterts. Chewing, she points at the plate. ROWAN
text: shakes her head NO.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: That food poisoning did a job on me.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: I told you not to honeymoon in the Bayou. (pause) I remember when
dialog: Giff ate a bad batch of ---
text: Her eyes fill with tears. ROWAN reaches for her hand.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: It's over a month. (sighs) The police say it happens all the time.
text: She musters a weak smile. Her eyes shift to the crowd.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: Isn't that your friend...?
text: ROWAN turns to see AARON - watching the guitarist and dancer.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Aaron!
text: He turns - blooms in a smile - strolls over - and bows.
speaker_heading: ARRON
dialog: The Ladies Mayfair. Good afternoon.
text: He leans to ROWAN - and they kiss. Me turns to BEATRICS and kisses her hand. He sits down -
text: and looks ROWAN over.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Are you alright...? You look pale.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (good-naturedly)
dialog: I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health. I'm the
dialog: doctor.
text: But AARON is suddenly very focused, concentrated. Staring at her. And finally - he smiles.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: There are two.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Two what...?
speaker_heading: AARON
text: Two heartbeats.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: Excuse me...?
speaker_heading: ARRON
dialog: (points at ROWAN'S stomach)
dialog: There.
text: ROWAN looks down at herself. Her eyes widen in realization.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Are you sure...?
text: AARON nods calmly. BEATRICE looks from one to the other.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: What are you two talking about...?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: (his smile widens)
dialog: Rowan - is pregnant.
text: ROWAN looks up at him and beams. BEATRICE is stunned.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: But how could - how can you possibly --- ?
text: And she sits back - and stares at them.
scene_heading: INT. THE MAYFAIR GARDEN. LATER THAT DAY - DUSK
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP - A BUSH WITH LARGE EMERALD-GREEN FLOWERS

dialog: garden.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: If it's a boy --- Taylor.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: A bit much. (Pause) Lucas.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas. (thinks) Grayson.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (makes a tace)
dialog: Where are you gitting these...?
dialog: (thinking. her face lights)
dialog: Aaron --- if it's a boy.
text: He grins - and nods. They lean to each other and kiss.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And if it's a girl --- Diedre.
text: She blooms in a painful smile. A tear runs down her cheek.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CEMETERY. THE NEXT DAY - DUSK
text: Deserted. ROWAN, with a bouquet of tulips, walks past shadowed crypts and stops before the
text: huge Mayfair crypts the vault marked DIEDRE MAYFAIR - 1943- 1992. The vault's ledge is
text: festooned with flowers. A long beat.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (a sad smile. softly)
dialog: I'm going to have a baby. (pause) Michael wants to name it
dialog: after you - if it's a girl. Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?
dialog: (pause) Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
speaker_heading: LASHER (OC)
dialog: I bring her flowers too.
text: ROWAN whirls round. LASHER sits crosslegged on a crypt. She glances from side to side.
speaker_heading: LASHER
text: There is no one here but the dead.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Go away! I don't want you here.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: If that were true, I would not be here.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first
dialog: knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has wanted me! suzann.
dialog: and Deborah. Stella - Marguerite - Antha - Diedre - All of them.
dialog: (a beat. his melancholy smile)

text: She glares at him --- and slowly nods.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: A girl...?
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (eyes him. a beat.very cod)
dialog: It's too soon to know.
text: She turns her back on him and puts her bouquet on the vault's ledge. She doesn't move. LASHER
text: suddenly locks confused.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: You fear me. Why when you yearn so to know me...? (pause) You
dialog: want more from me than the pleasure. Much more.
text: He glides to her. His spectral face right before hers.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: you crave what I might show you. What you can learn. What
dialog: I can give you.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: So much more than Michael can.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (a powerful smile of strength)
dialog: What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever
dialog: inderstand.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: (pained. touching)
dialog: But I could understand. I want to understand!
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: I LOVE him!
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: (shimmering. angered)
dialog: Do not tell me that!
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: I LOVE MICHAEL. MICHAEL!!
text: LASHER flickers furiously --- and disappears. ROWAN scans the cemetery...
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Lasher...? Lasher...?
text: SCRRUNNCH... She turns. The marble lid or a crypt is slowly sliding off... and clatters to
text: the ground. Then, the lid of a coffin comes INTO VIEW as it opens. And - a discolored skeleton
text: rises up and climbs out - and walks toward ROWAN. She watches wide-eyed holding her fear in
text: check. The skeleton stops before her - raises its arm and bony fingers gently caress ROWAN
dialog: whitened cheek...
speaker_heading: LASHER'S VOICE (WITHIN THS SKELESTON)
dialog: (tender - but menacing)
dialog: Michael will look like this one day... (pause)... but not I.
text: ROWAN'S face suddenly twists in anger. She grabs the skeleton by the ribcage - and slams it
text: against the MAYFAIR crypt It breaks into pieces and crumples to the ground.
scene_heading: INT. THE MAYFAIR MANSION LIVING SLOOM
text: Almost finished. A magnificent design. MICHAEL, AARON and STU lift champagne glasses for a
dialog: toast.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: To the next Mayfair: Diedre - or --- Aaron.

dialog: champagne bottle-
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Anymore of this...?
text: MICHAEL nods - and heads out the room.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (calling after him. casual)
dialog: I - uh - I assume either one's middle name is gonna be Stu...
text: MICHAEL WALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY PAST THE PORTRAITS.
text: Passing the mirror, he stops - and cocks his head. The glass is turning GREEN. He raises a
text: finger and touches the glass. His finger punctures the GREENNESS - and sinks in up to his
text: knuckle. Re hesitates - and slowIy, draws his finger out..
text: THE GREENNESS POURS OUT into the hall. knocking him down. The hall is filling up, the GREENNESS
text: rising. MICHAEL struggles as it rises above his head - above the portraits and the witches
text: come out into the GREEN - surrounding him
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Michael... Do what you can.
speaker_heading: SUZANNE
dialog: Michael... Help us... The door!

text: MICHAEL IS ON THE FLOOR IN THE HALL
text: AARON is kneeling, grasping him by the shoulders.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Focus, Michael
text: MICHAEL hones in on AARON - and points at the portraits.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It was them.
text: AARON nods soberly - and helps him to his feet.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Don't tell Rowan about this.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Michael, Rowan should -
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: NO! she's pregnant, Aaron. she's got that to deal with - and the
dialog: clinic.. she is not to hear about this. (pause) don't you think I know
dialog: she spends half her lite worrying about me...
dialog: (a beat. cools off)
dialog: Listening to my heart, aren't you...?
speaker_heading: (AARON nods)
dialog: The Timex still ticking...?

speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
speaker_heading: FADE UP TO
scene_heading: INT. THE CLINIC. WEEK LATER - LATE NIGHT
text: Microscopes, centrifuges, test tube racks, cubicles and refrigerators fill a large, dark,
speaker_heading: deserted room. PAN TO
text: ROWAN AND LASHER STANDING AT A CORNER LAB TABLE
text: A single candle flickers. She holds a closed, long-stemted rose in her hand. LASHER'S
text: transparent hand reaches out and melts into bars. ROWAN shivers from the union.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: (hypnotic)
text: Imagine The sun. (pause) It is morning. It rises. The light wrashes
dialog: over you. It warms you.
text: ROWAN looks out the window. She's going far away. Outside the room. Past the dark night
dialog: outside.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: Now, Rowan. Give me the sun.
text: She almost trembles with concentration. And then --- the rose opens - the petals spreading
dialog: wide...
scene_heading: INT. ROWAN AND MICHAEL'S BEDROOM. SAME TIME
text: the WIND gusts outside the darkened windows. MICHAEL lies in bed, DAVID COPPERFIELD in his
text: hands Tapping the book. Uneasy. Distracted. He glances at the nighttable clock - 12:45 and
text: scowls. He opens the book to the first page.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: 'It was the best of times. It was the worst of times...'
text: A bitter grin darkens his face. He rises and walks into the bathroom. He strips off his
text: pajamas and turns on the shower.
scene_heading: INT. THE CLINIC LAB. SAME TIME
text: ROWAN holds the rose in one hand and lights it with a match. It ignites. She drops it on a
text: counter and watches it burn - darkening and shriveling to a curled black ash.
speaker_heading: LASHER (UNSEEN)
dialog: Now, my love --- see it as It was.
text: Her eyes never leave the burnt remains - but brighten in concentration. Deep, shining tunnels.
speaker_heading: LASHER (UNSEEN)
dialog: See the memory of life!
text: Her body tingles with a remarkable force - and the black.ned petals start to uncurl - and
text: brighten to a pink - then a vibrant, rich red. Alive again. ROWAN shivers - her body goes limp
text: and she smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LASHER (UNSEEN)
dialog: (delighted)
dialog: You see...? You see...?!!
dialog: (a beat. softly)
dialog: Rowan think what the child might do...
scene_heading: INT. THE MANSION - THE BATHROOM. SAME TIME
text: MICHAEL - naked, freshly showered, his face lathered with shaving cream. The antique mirror on
text: the wall is completely fogged from the hot, steamy running water in the sink He begins to rub
text: the mirror clear... His eyes widen - as rub by rub, he reveals -
text: A monstrous tableau in the mirrorr: A deep, hellish landscape of nightsarish creatures -
text: part-human, part-grotesqueri. - tortured. screaming silently. They turn and see him and start
text: flying toward him at impossible speed...
text: MICHAEL squeezes his eyes shut.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (like a litany)
scene_heading: I - AM - STANDING - IN - THE - BATHROOM!!!
text: He opens his eyes. The mirror reflects only his lathered face and the bathroom. A deep sigh.
text: A long beat. He picks up a razor - and starts at his cheekbone. As the razor descends, shaving
dialog: the lather off -
text: there is nothing beneath the rather in tb. mirror. No cheek - just BLACKNESS. He stares in
text: shock. Another stroke removes more lather, revealing more of the VOID. He is mesmerized - and
text: can't stop- shaving faster until all the lather is gone - and the upper half of his face
text: floats above a blackt hole in the mirror. And suddenly -
text: - the grotesqueries are trying to squeeze through the black hole with ear-splitting HOWLS -
text: hands and arms and talons pulling and ripping at each other, fighting to be the first to
dialog: escape...
text: MICHAEL grabs the mirror off the wall and hurls it to the floor, shattering it. SILENCE. He
text: steadies himself, catching his breath. Then he hesitantly brings a hand up and feels his jaw,
text: his cheeks and lip. A deep breath. He turns off the water - and walks out of the room.
text: EXT. THE MAYFAIR GROUNDS. THE FOLLOWING MORNING
text: Two WORKMEN are inside the dry, scrubbed swimming pool on ladders. applying a new coat of blue
text: sealant to the sides.
text: MICHAEL AND STU ON THE SIDE PORCH

speaker_heading: STU
dialog: ...Donna's gonna meet me in Key West, so I'll leave here a week
dialog: before Christmas and be back on the fourth. Okay...?
text: MICHAEL gives a distracted nod. STU eyes him carefully
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What's wrong, Mike...?
text: MICHAEL shakes his head dismissively.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: C'mon - you haven't been able to lie to me since you asked Martha Rutledge

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yes. (pause) Partly. It's - it's -
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Stu - do you believe in ---
text: STU'S eyes shift to something behind MICHAEL - his expressiofl quizzical. MICHAEL cocks his
text: head at STU - and turns...
text: ROWAN STANDS IN THE PORCH ENTRANCE BEHIND THEM
text: Stock still. Pale. Drawn. She's been listening.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Hi there. Want coffee...?
text: ROWAN and MICHAEL'S eyes meet. Then --- OC - CRASH! ROWAN and MICHAEL'S eyes are locked.
text: STU - turns to the sound.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE SWIMMING POOL

dialog: BACK TO THE PORCH
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What now...?
text: He walks toward the pool, leaving ROWAN and MICHAEL alone.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (simmering anger)
dialog: When aid you get home last night...?
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: What were you talking about...?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yyou look terrible. You're exhausted. You practically live at the goddamn

speaker_heading: STU (OC)
dialog: Mike! Better c'mere!

scene_heading: EXT. DOWN IN THE POOL - MOMENTS LATER
text: MICHAEL, STU, and the WORKERS watch as the puddle of spilled blue sealant on the pool floor
dialog: begins to shrink... Huh...?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: It cracked the bottom. Stuff's seeping down through a crack.
text: Almost all the sealant is gone - revealing cracks where the can hit. MICHAEL taps the cracks
text: with his foot - and STU grabs him as part of the pool caves in, leaving a hole.
text: MICHAEL lowers a ladder inte the hole. It hits bottom.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Careful...
text: MICHAEL descends OUT OF VIEW. STU glances up and there is ROWAN - staring down at him,

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Something's wrong with you.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (flaring)
dialog: Nothing is wrong with me. I know something's in there -
dialog: and so do you.

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Jesus Christ!
text: They slowly come back, leaning in for a look at the contents: A dozen, old, thick masan jars
text: with air-tight wax seals.
text: ROWAN takes them out and sets them on the floor. They are filled with greenish. viscous fluid.
dialog: It's hard to see inside - a 100 years of sediment has been stirred up. But things are
text: settling it the jars. Things are becoming visable...
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Michael --- look.
text: The jars are fil1ed with HEADS - skulls covered with slimy flesh. Jellyish, rheumy eyes. Hair
text: drifting 1ike seaweed. ROWAN and MICHAEL stare. A long beat.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Marguerite...
text: MICHAEL looks at her - uncomprehending.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Marguerite! Carlotta said - "Margutrite was something of a
dialog: practitioner herself." She meant - like a doctor --- Like ---
text: Suddenly - MICHAEL violently twists the top off a jar HISSSS... They both gag at the fumes...
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Michael --- no!
text: He plunges his bare hand into the muck and pulls out a head. His fingers sink into the skin. A

text: MARGUERITE and JULIEN stand over a MAN'S corpse, lying on a table. LASHER hovers expectantly.
text: MARGUERITE takes a crude surgical tool, servers the head, and holds it up by the hair. LASHER
text: is brightening, swirling round and round the head...
speaker_heading: MARGUERITE
dialog: Now, my love - Now!
text: LASHER dives into the head - like a vapor sucked inside. The lifeless eyes suddenly glimmer -
dialog: and come to life
speaker_heading: LASHER'S VOICE (FROM BEHIND THE EYES)
dialog: I am here, Marguerite! I can see!
text: But the eyes start to flicker and dim, like a dying light...
speaker_heading: LASHER'S VOICE
dialog: (a plaintive cry)
dialog: No...NO	pleeeeease... I am going...	slipping... The feeling... Oh,
dialog: the feeling! NOOOO!
text: And now, there is only death in the eyes again.
text: BACK TO ROWAN AND MICHAEL
text: MICHAEL drops the head. It breaks like a rotten melon. He is horror-stricken, wiping his hands
text: frantically on his shirt...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: He went into the dead! Saw with their eyes - used them...
text: ROWAN - terrified - reaches for him - but he pushes her away. Me grabs at the jars, inspecting
dialog: them, one after another...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: This one!
text: Through the glass, a head stares out at him - its state far superior to the others: the hair
text: brown and wavy, the face grotesquely beautiful. He opens the jar - and pulls it out. ANOTHER
speaker_heading: FLASH OF WHITE Inro
scene_heading: INT. DIEDRE'S ROOM [AS IF MICHAEL WERE THERE]
text: A naked MALE CORPSE lies on the brass bed - mottled, lifeless yet alive, pulsing with LASHER'S
text: spirit MARGUERITE stands naked at the bedside. JULIEN stands beside her in elegant attire -
text: with a look of twistad fascination and anticipation.
text: The CORPSE beckons to MARGUERITE. She climbs on the bed and mounts it. The grey hands move
text: with clumsy effort, pawing at her. She begins to move in a steady rhythm.
speaker_heading: LASHER VOICE (WITHIN THE CORPSE)
dialog: Marguerit. - I can feel you...
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: (leaning in. face ablaze)
dialog: Faster, Marguerite! Faster! FASTER!
text: MARGUERITE speeds up - but soon. the CORPSE'S hands slip to the bed, lifeless. Tears fill
text: MARGUERITE'S eyes. JULIEN smashes the bedpost in anger and storms away.
text: BACK TO ROWAN AND MICHAEL
text: MICHAEL still holds the skull, eye to eye.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Jesus - he tried to fuck her and Julien - Julien was there -
dialog: like, like an overseer...
text: ROWAN suddenly grabs the head - and huris it to tbe floor. Glass and flesh and bone smash
text: against the floorboards...
scene_heading: INT. THE TALMASCA GARDEN. LATER THAT DAY - DUSK
text: ROWAN and MICHAEL watch AARON as he paces - his face a study in concentraticn. He finally
text: turns to MICHAEL.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: What have the witches always asked of you...?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: "Go back, Michael. Do what you can..."
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Yes - and you have.
dialog: (turns to ROWAN)
dialog: Do you see...? He was passing over into death - but the witches
dialog: sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to
dialog: save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no
dialog: one else could...
text: He grabs MICHAEL by the wrists and raises them high.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: With his hands!
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: But why would they do that...?
text: AARON leans and smells a rose. Thinking. A long beat.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: To warn you.
text: ROWAN'S face creases in confusion. AARON turns to MICHAEL -
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches
dialog: brought you and Rowan together. Isn't that right...?
dialog: (MICHAEL nods emphatically)
dialog: They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: But it doesn't make sense. They - they used Lasher... they conspired
dialog: with him.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...?
dialog: They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside
dialog: herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood... surely
dialog: they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers
dialog: grasp... (pause) Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they
dialog: embraced in life...?!
text: MICHAEL and ROWAN turn to each other. AARON is pacing again.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: (excited)
dialog: It feels right. (pause) There is a continuum, Rowan. You're part
dialog: of them.
dialog: (halts. a long beat)
dialog: They want you to stop Lasher.
text: The concept sends them all deep into SILENCE.

text: foating in its jar. Calipers dip into the jar. PULL OUT to
text: ROWAN IN A WINDOWLESS ROOM AT THE RESEARCH CLINIC
text: as she extracts a chunk of flesh. She prepares a slide specimen, placing it under a large
text: microscope. She depotits a specimen in a centrifuge and turns it on. WHIRRRR... she programs
text: the computer - and co1umns of figures and symbols start filling the monitor. She eyes the
text: Screen and - LASHER'S spectral face appears within the glass.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: And now - do you know...?
text: ROWAN'S face hardens. She stares back defiantly.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: I know that you're evil.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: (poignant)
dialog: I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do... (sighs) ...but
dialog: Marguerite could not help me. Nor Julien...
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: (his melancholy smile)
dialog: No, my love. I want nothing more of the dead.
dialog: (a long beat)
dialog: I want you to --- chang me.
text: ROWAN falls silent - caught off-balance.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: I have kept this from you, until now. You had to learn the
dialog: magnificence of your powers first. You had to see for yourself
dialog: what you are capable of.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Think. Rowan - think of the rose - and the fire - and Stu. (pause)
dialog: You gave Michael life again - you give life to the ehild within you...
dialog: (a teat)
dialog: Give me life! Make me flesh!
text: She's stunned. He wafts out of the screen - floating round her like a sheath. She backs away
text: from him. He follows...
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: It's impossible. You want me to - to make you into something you're
dialog: not! You - you have no substance - you have no cells, no structure...
text: He circles round her. An unearthly courting dance. She is swaying, being swept up...
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so
dialog: sublime just beyond your reach...? to float in a dream that keeps a
dialog: .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?
dialog: (a forlorn moan)
dialog: I did not choose to be such as this! Suzanne brought me here. She
dialog: called to me!
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: But have I...? Ever...?!
text: LASHER is everywhere - all around her - caressing her...
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: Not with your voice, no...but you do not need a voice for me.
dialog: Only the beat of your heart. That is your voice to me ---
text: She is up against the wall nov, enveloped by him.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: --- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first
dialog: beat.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (swooning)
dialog: I love Michael...
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: (seductive. tinged with menace)
dialog: Then help me--- for his sake...
text: His sexual perfection has her floating, eyes drooping. He kisses her deeply...
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Only you...
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
text: Brightening, he fuses with her - two entities becoming one... And she surrenders to him...
scene_heading: INT. ROWAN'S LAB. HOURS LATER
text: ROWAN lies on the floor. Her eyes open. She rises groggily, and drops into her chair. Cocks
text: her head, her senses keen.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Lasher...?
speaker_heading: (SILENCE)
dialog: Lasher! Come to me!
text: SILENCE. She smiles cunningly - and nods, understanding.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (thinking out loud)
dialog: You can't. You use yourself up in the passion. (pause)
dialog: You need time.
text: She starts rapidly typing at the computer. The screen shows -
dialog: hypothesis: to examine secondary growth activity
dialog: cells induced by unknown catalyst -
dialog: and resultingly, deduce nature of catalyst
dialog: and it's reanimative authority
text: The computer shuttles. ROWAN types -
dialog: posit: if hypothesis is successful,
dialog: what is probabiliy data will disclose
dialog: specific procedure for destruction of catalyst?
text: The computers shuttles. Then, appearing on the screen -
dialog: 75 %
text: She shows a faint smile of tritamph. She sits back - puts her hands on her round stomach -
text: looks down and smiles warmly.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Maybe Aaron is right. Maybe they are trying to help. Can you feel
dialog: them...?
dialog: (her face hardens with resolution)
dialog: I swear to you - you will never know him. When you come into the

speaker_heading: STU
dialog: A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville. Oh,

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (very low-keyed)
dialog: Just don't fall off any ladders.
text: A long, silent look between them.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (soothing)
dialog: Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that. I mean -
dialog: hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
speaker_heading: ROWAN
text: Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself.
dialog: Cool. Aloof.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: I almost missed you. You have a great time - and a merry
dialog: Christmas.
text: She leans in and gives STU a big htag and a kiss.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You too.
text: MICHAEL' S mood makes everything awkward. Everyone sneaking glances. STU finally wraps

speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You two be good to each other.
text: And he gets into the taxi. ROWAN and MICHAEL watch silently till it goes OUT OF VIEW. ROWAN
text: turns round and stares at the house.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: God, Michael - it's so beautiful. It'll be weird without anybody tromping
dialog: around in there, huh...?
text: She turns to MICHAEL. He nods faintly. They stare across the gulf between them. Trying to
text: link up. He scratches his cleft with his thumb. She grins and steps to him. Her arms going
dialog: round him.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (a faint smile)
dialog: Hi. (pause) You - you wanna get some breakfast...? Maybe see

speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (hesitant. softly)
dialog: I - I... I can't, Michael. There's stuff --- at the clinic -
speaker_heading: MICHAEL

scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN NEW ORLEANS. LATER THAT MORNING

dialog: Go on. Rowan. Go on.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (smacks the desk)
dialog: Leave me alone!
text: LASHER flickers into sight. she turns and hurls a notebook at him. It goes through him and
text: hits the wall.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: What is wrong...?
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Wrong...? Science is not magic.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: (a beat. sottly)
dialog: I do not understand...
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: You went into the cells --- and you changed them. How...?!
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: There was no thought. There was no act. (pause) That is not
dialog: what I am.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: I don't know what you are!!!
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: (passionate)
dialog: That is what you must discover. (pause) see what I am, my love.
dialog: With all your power - see me, and know what I am.
text: He approaches. She brace herself - holding her ground - not backing off.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: Do not be atraid. Fear is not for you...
text: She straightens, tightening some psychic grip. She holds her hands out and frames his head. His
text: face comes to hers - meets it - then merges with hers - And they start to rise - joined as they
dialog: are - floating up...
scene_heading: ROWAN'S POV - A TRILLION FLECKS OF COLORED LIGHT
text: Dense, dazzling. The POV moves deeper - the density lessens...fewer particles, frenzied,
text: darting in a greenish haze... Deeper - terrifying speed now - zooming, plummeting toward
text: nothingness. OBLIVION -a piercing SCREAM-
scene_heading: ROWAN - SUSPENDED IN THE AIR WITH LASHER
text: SCREAMS - lurches free of him, and falls to the floor, dazed. LASHER swoops down to her,

speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: Don't stop!

speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: (intense. urgent)
dialog: Tell me what I am, Rowan.
text: She gazes at him painfully, shakes her head vehemently.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: Rowan... Rowan!

dialog: and jealousy.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: (cool anger)
dialog: You are thinking of him...
text: And she suddenly rises - and storms out of the room.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MANSION. DAY - AN HOUR LATER
text: ROWAN comes quickly through the gate. She walks inside the house and down the main hall.
speaker_heading: ROWAS
dialog: Michael...? Michael...?!

dialog: turns...
scene_heading: ROWAN'S POV - THE LIVING ROOM

speaker_heading: ROWAN

speaker_heading: MICHAEL (OC)
dialog: Nice, huh...?
text: She turns and sees MICHAEL and rushes into his arms.
scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL AND ROWAN'S ROOM. LATER THAT DAY
text: They lie in bed, in each other's arms. Private Thoughts, A long beat. MICHAEL lets out a deep

speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: It's not true. You have to believe me.
text: MICHAE is preparing his thoughts...making his mind up.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I want us to leave. This isn't home, Rowan. I could tear the house
dialog: down and start from scratch - and it still wouldn't be home. I want
dialog: to go back to San Francisco - I want our child born somewhere that's
dialog: free of death. That's all there is here! It's in the ground and the glass
dialog: and the steel and the ground. (pause) I want to leave. If Lasher follows,
dialog: So be it. Let him face us in a place where we belong!
text: MICHAEL waits. And - ROWAN looks away from him.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (her voice is sad, but hard)
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: That's not good enough. Why not...?!
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (suddenly erupting)
dialog: I can't leave now. Don't ask me to explain! I just can't!
text: That does it. He's had it. He rips the covers off and stands. Grabs his pants and starts
text: pulling them on.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me
dialog: inside! But I'm on the outside now... you put me there!
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (melting to urgency)
dialog: Michael - please - just. a little longer. Don't leave.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (bitter. sarcastic)
dialog: Why bother to ask, Ro...? Why don't you just make me stay,..?
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Stop it!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
speaker_heading: ROWAN

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: ROWAN

speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: You are magnificent, my love.
text: As ROWAN stands, entranced in her powers. LASHER swirls round the tree. The ornaments sway in

text: AARON stares - unflinching - as the car barrels over the cliff, soaring down. down... The
text: ground racing up at him...
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I am not AFRAID!
text: The car plows into the ground - and suddenly - AARON is staring at the highways center-line as
text: he speeds along.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: You are strong, Aaron...
dialog: (an evil smile)
dialog: ...but others are not so strong.
text: And he vanishes. AARON'S face creases in confusion. Huh...? A school bus is coming up toward
text: them in the other direction, on the other side of the road. AARON'S face whitens...
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Lasher, where are you...? Lasher...?! LASHER!
speaker_heading: LASHER (UNSEEN)
dialog: If not for yourself then fear for the children...
text: AARON can see the bus clearly now. Packed with children. And he can see the sudden,
text: uncomprehending look of terror on the DRIVER'S face. - as he inexplicably loses control of the
text: bus. It suddenly skids - and swerves out of lane - heading straight for a head-on with AARON.
text: AARON hesitates - uncertain - wavering - seconds to impact - and --- he swerves out of the bus
text: path at the last moment -- sacrificing himself - flying off the cliff...

text: as she is sent reeling to the floor. Dazed, fighting a blackout. - sliding down into her
dialog: dream...
text: THE OPERATING ROOM IN ROWAN'S DREAM
text: ROWAN works feverishly on the OUT OF FRAME patient. THE MASKED FIGURES watch silently.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: I - I can't do it!
text: The others urge her on - imploring, encouraging her-
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (pointing OUT OF FRAME. frantic)
dialog: But look! LOOK! How can I do it...?
text: OC - a muffled CRY.
text: TILT DOWN SLOWLY - the edge of the operating table comes INTO FRAME - and lying on it, a tiny
text: hand... PULL OUT to REVEAL ALL for the first time... It is a truly bizarre entity: the torso of
text: a man - with the head, arms and legs, toes and lingers of a tiny newborn.
speaker_heading: MASKED FIGURE
dialog: Go on! Help him!
speaker_heading: MASKED FIGURE
dialog: Help us!
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: HOW...?!
text: A FIGURE removes its mask - it is MARGUERITE. She takes a scalpel and cuts the entity from
text: navel to callarbone, then folds back the skin --- within the chest cavity, the emerald pendant
text: is where a heart should be. ROWAN SCREAMS. All but one of the FIGURES take off their masks:
text: they are the twelve MAYFAIR WITCHES - and JULIEN.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: Help him! You were made for this?
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: I can't do it! How can I do it...?!
speaker_heading: SUZANNE
dialog: Stop doubting your power!!
text: Then - the remaining MASKED FIGURE speaks:
speaker_heading: MASKED FIGURE
dialog: No! Don't listen to your words, Rowan. Listen to the feeling
dialog: behind your words. Listen to your heart.
text: He removes his mask. it is ARRON.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: It is not your power that you doubt. When you say - "I can't do
dialog: it" - you are saying - "I MUST NOT DO IT!" You are saying "I WILL
dialog: NOT DO IT!"
dialog: (his warm, kind smile)
dialog: This is what your heart tells you.
text: ROWAN ON THE FLOOR AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS
text: coming groggily out of the dream. She rises unsteadily. And LASHER stands before her. Her
text: face hardens. He starts toward her. ROWAN stands her ground - sensing danger.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: STOP!'
text: Lasher halts - shimmering. Staring deep into one another.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Aaron was in the dream. A dream tilled with spirits. (pause) you killed
dialog: him, didn't you...?
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: (a beat)
text: It was an accident. (smiles) Gifford, too.
text: She trembles. Her tears come. But - she steels herself. A long beat.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: The portraits, Lasher. Why are the witches always before a door...?
dialog: Tell me, Lasher. Now!
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: (his smile flashes)
dialog: They want to come back. (pause) We have a pact - of mutual desire
dialog: and consent. The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry. I have weaved
dialog: you all together - from the start. (pause) I brought Petyr Van Abel to
dialog: Suzanne. He had genius in him. Scientific, precise. It was a perfect
dialog: start. And on it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father
dialog: to daughter...
text: ROWAN shudders. Turning ghostly pale.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Oh god...
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: Ju1ien was your father Your great-grandfather - your grandfather
dialog: - and your father. All one in the same... That is why he fought
dialog: carlotta for your life.
text: ROWAN is shaken - backing up in horror.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: The Mayfair pact. Rowan: when I am flesh - I will unlock the
dialog: door - and the witches will come through.
dialog: (soaring)
dialog: You are the key to the door for the witches - and for me! You are
dialog: the thirteenth witch.
text: Laslirn glows brighter...
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: I will be --- perfect. (pause) That is why I chose Michael...
text: ROWAN blanches. Thrown for a loop. LASHER smiles.
speaker_heading: LASHER
text: The boy who would turn his dreams into reality. The exquisite
dialog: imagination! So aesthetic, so vulnerable... The boy so special,
dialog: he could see me! (pause) And I knew he was the one --- for us.
dialog: (he smilas)
dialog: You thought it love at first sight...? (shakes his head) I chose him
dialog: for you. (pause) The union is human perfection.
text: She doesn't quite get it. she's revving, furious, confused.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: I created you to create me --- and you have...
text: And now ROWAN sees it all. stumbling back, terrified...
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: It's growing inside you... Waiting to change... Waiting for me.
text: And ROWAN turns - and runs... A door SLAMS shut as she races toward it.
speaker_heading: LASHER (UNSEEN)
dialog: Did you think you could trick me, my love...?
text: She whirls round - LASHER floats before her - glowing like never before - a bright, pulsating
text: emerald green.
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: You thought I could not see into your soul...? I made your soul!
text: ROWAN back up against the wall. LASHER spreads out - huge, dark, roiling. Towering above her.
text: the clock begins to chime. MIDNIGHT. GONG-GONG-GONG...
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: It is Christmas Eve, my love The witching hour is at hand,
dialog: when Christ was born into the world - when the Word was
dialog: finally made Flesh --- and I would be born too. I am done
dialog: with waiting!
text: He gathers force, funnelling in on himself, whirling like a tornado - and streams toward her
text: like a jet of green vapor -
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
text: --- and the whirlwind jets up between her legs --- into her --- and disappears. She HOWLS in
text: unearthly pain - and falls to the floor. Her water breaks - blood seeping now from between her
dialog: legs -
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (absolutely, totally, completely freaked)
dialog: Oh god - oh my god - no, godddd, NO!!!
text: She SHRIEKS as a vicious contraction jolts her to her very being. And --- something is coming
dialog: out of her...
text: Out it slides --- the ENTITY FROM HER DREAM. On its back - bloody, shining - a man-sized head,
text: its infant arms and fingers and legs and feet groping and and moving and --- elongating and
text: growing with each breath, as it cries the CRY from ROWAN'S dream... ROWAN slumps into
dialog: oblivion...
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
speaker_heading: FADE UP TO
scene_heading: EXT. THE MANSION. EARLY THE NEXT MORNING - CHRISTMAS DAY
text: TRACKING with MIHAEL
text: as he barrels through the gate and bursts inside the house.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: ROWAN!! ROWAN!!
text: Racing down the hall, he freezes - staring into the LIVING ROOM. Everything topsy-turvy. A
text: carpet of broken, colored glass and pine needles covers the floor. He races toward the stairs
text: and skids to stop - a thick pool of blood on the floor there. MICHAEL races back down the
dialog: hall...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: ROWAN!!!!!!
scene_heading: EXT. THE MANSION GARDEN. MOMENTS LATER
text: MICHAEL races INTO FRAME - and stops - staring at a tall FIGURE - clad only in pants - its back
dialog: to him.
speaker_heading: THER FIGURE
text: slowly turns round. it is a man - delicate yet muscular but the skin, the expression, the
text: texture ot him is brand-new, newborn. And his face is a perfect mix of ROWAN and MICHAEL. In
text: his hand, he holds one at the newly-bloomed emerald-and-crimson flowers. He smiles...
speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: I made these.
text: It is LASHER'S voice. He holds the flower to his nose and inhales deeply- His brand-new face
text: lights with the most sensual of discoveries.
speaker_heading: LASHER THE MAN
dialog: Ahhh...	It is incredible, is it not...?
dialog: (holds the flower out to MICHAEL)
dialog: Here. For you, Father.
text: And MICHAEL knows. He HOWLS and stampedes toward LASHER, who waits with a delighted
text: expresslon. MICHAEL barrels into him - they go sprawling to the ground. MICHAEL pummeling him,
text: tearing at him, lost to murder and vengeance.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You fucking bastard! You killed my child!!!
text: But LASHER is laughing --- rejoicing in the sensations, the pain, the movement, the flesh...
speaker_heading: LASHER THE MAN
dialog: But I am your child! I AM YOUR SON!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Where is Rowan...?! Where is she...?!!
speaker_heading: LASHER THE MAN
dialog: And this is pain...? Father you cannot hurt me. No one can.
text: And LASHER rises, lifting MICHAEL up like a toy - dangling him in the air.
speaker_heading: LASHER THE MAN
dialog: I am ALIVE Father!
text: And he flings MICHAEL across the garden. LASHER smiles, and heads for MICHAEL ungainly on his
dialog: new legs.
text: ROWAN COMES CARWLING OUT OF THE HOUSE
text: - weakened, haggard, bloodied, pale.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Michael...
text: LASHER - standing over MICHAEL - turns toward the sound - and MICHAEL tries to crawl away.
speaker_heading: LASHER THE MAN
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: You want Michael...?
text: LASHER struts to MICHAEL and picks him up by the collar.
speaker_heading: LASHER THE MAN
dialog: Here! Here he is!
text: MICHAEL hangs still in LASHER'S grip, like the marionette. LASHER jostles him, shakes him with
text: a smile.
speaker_heading: LASHES THE MAN
dialog: You could use some strings, I think..
text: ROWAN is trying to crawl, but she's so weak.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Put - him - down! His - his heart...
speaker_heading: LASHER THE MAN
dialog: How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
text: He punches MICHAEL brutally in the chest. And then strikes him again. MICHAEL HOWLS -
text: breathless, eyes bulging- LASHER starts parading around the garden holding MICHAEL in the air
text: like a broken marionette..
speaker_heading: LASHER THE MAN
dialog: (mad. possessed. overdosing on life)
dialog: Look at me, Mother! Am I not a wonder...?! Something new under the
dialog: sun! The world has never seen the likes of me!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (a barely audible HISS)
dialog: A monster among men...
speaker_heading: LASHER
dialog: (suddenly expressionless. cold)
dialog: Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come. Your time is
dialog: gone.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: No! Don't! Lasher!!!
text: LASHER strikes a deadly blow to MICHAEL'S chest. MICHAEL seems to cave in.. And LASHER hurls
text: MICHAEL into the pool.
text: MICHAEL SINKS LIKE A STONE BENEATH THE WATER
text: Sinking into death for the second and last time. And - the WITCHES seep out in the water
text: surrounding him.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Let go, Michael. It is done - and he is beautiful! Perfect.
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: We can go through now. Lasher will open the door and
dialog: bring us back- (pause) Goodbye, Michael. Let go now.
dialog: Let go...
text: The phantoms fade away. Michael sinks to the bottom. DEAD.
speaker_heading: BACK AT POOLSIDE
text: LASHER stands, beaming and proud, staring into the water. ROWAN drags herself to the pool -
text: and stares down in horror.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Oh god nooooooooo....
text: She tries to slide into the pool - but LASHER picks her up gently end deposits her on the
dialog: grass.
speaker_heading: LASHER THE MAN
dialog: Mother - you must rest. You're still bleeding. Rest. please...
text: The WIND suddenly picks up. The trees sway. And then - the witches' VOICES swirl around
speaker_heading: LASHER and ROWAN
speaker_heading: SUZANNE (UNSEEN)
dialog: Lasher - bring us through!
speaker_heading: DEBORAH (UNSEEN)
dialog: Now, lasher - it is our time.
text: The VOICES beseech him, coax him, plead... And LASHER smiles up at the sky --- a widening,
dialog: cunning, wicked smile...
speaker_heading: LASHER THE MAN
dialog: Your time...? Oh, my foolish ones - but you are wrong! rt is my time
dialog: MINE! I am unto myself - one of a kind! (pause) And I have Rowan!

dialog: Lasher - please...! Save us! Bring us through!
speaker_heading: LASHER THE MAN
dialog: (suddenly vicious)
dialog: BE GONE! - or I will send you where there are no worlds at all!
dialog: GO!
text: The WIND dies. SILENCE. He turns and sees ROWAN dragging herself toward the pool. He strides
text: over and drags her away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (tries to shake free of him)
dialog: Let me go... Michaelllllll...
speaker_heading: LASHER THE MAN
dialog: ENOUGH! He is dead. You are here for me now. Michael is
dialog: gone!
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (venomous. spitting it out)
dialog: I'll destroy you. I swear it! If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
speaker_heading: LASHER THE MAN
dialog: (stunned. sincerely wounded)
dialog: 'Kill you...?' You are my mother. Do you think I would hurt you...?
text: She twists out of his grasp and sprawls on the ground. Glaring up at him. And then -
text: The WIND comes up again. Whipping the leaves around. Gathering force. LASHER looks to the
text: sky, perplexed, surprised. His newborn eyes wide and curious...
speaker_heading: SUZANNE (UNSEEN)
dialog: Rowan - he has cheated us all? (pause) You are the thirteenth.
dialog: Use your anger. Use the power! USE US!
text: ROWAN slowly rises, as if pulled up. The sky darkens. The WIND swirls. LASHER watches like a
text: child, turning round and round - and stares now into his mother's eyes.
speaker_heading: LASHER THE MAN
dialog: (soft)
dialog: Mother...
text: ROWAN glares it him. Her body seems to harden. Her eyes flare. LIGHTNING FLASHES - and a
text: hard rain pours down. LASHER'S expression changes. Doubt...? Fear...?
speaker_heading: LASHER THE MAN
dialog: (sott. heartrending)
dialog: I am your flesh... These are your eyes...
dialog: But she is steel. More than steel. She is an energy the earth has not known before... And he
text: sees it in her fact. His melancholy smile comes.
speaker_heading: LASHER THE MAN
dialog: (tender. loving)
dialog: I am your son. I would not wound you. I could not - ever.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (eerily soft)
dialog: I know. (pause) you are my son -
text: LASHER almost melts at her words. He reaches out to her -
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (turning cold as death)
dialog: - and may god forgive me.
text: He freezes - arms outstretched, mouth agape. She looks to the sky.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (imperious)
dialog: Now! NOW!!!
text: The WIND is whipped into a frenzy... A branch is torn from a tree - and crashes into LASHER.
text: He stumbles. Thorned bushes are ripped from the ground and tear at his flesh. His blood
dialog: runs...
text: In the sky, a doten whirling funnels appear descending like avenging WINDS. LASHER watches -
text: his face darkening. ROWAN'S arms rise pointing majestically like a conductor directing a
text: terrible symphony of destruction. The tunnels follow her movements, whirling and gliding... And
speaker_heading: terror rains down on LASHER
text: TREES, FLAGSTONE, ROCKS, THE WROGHT-IRON FENCE - EVERYTHING IS BEING UPROOTED, TORN APART - AND
text: SENT WHIRLING, SLASHING, AND CRASHING DOWN ON LASHER. He falls to the ground.
speaker_heading: LASHER THE MAN
dialog: MOTHER MY FLESH!!! DO NOT DO THIS!
text: ROWAN is ominous - eyes riveted on him. She points to the house - and it starts to come apart.
text: SHINGLES, TIMBERS, WINDOWS... TEARING LOOSE, FLYING THROUGH THEl AIR - SHOWERING DOWN ON
scene_heading: LASHER --- RIPPING HIM APART.
speaker_heading: LASHER THE MAN
dialog: The pain... my beautiful flesh!
text: Flesh tearing off bones! bones pulled from sockets. His very being coming apart,
text: disintegrating. His cries begin to fade in the cacophony. ROWAN' S eyes never leave him.
text: Her arms swing round and she points at what remains at her son... The funnels descend on
text: LASHER in a frenzy. Everything is obscured by the cloud of dust ard matter... Than - a final,
dialog: fading SHRIEK come. - and than --- SILENCE..
text: ROWAN's hands drop to her side... She seems to lessen... to settle back into herself. The
text: funnels fade... the dust settles... and where LASHER lay - NOTHING... The garden is gone. The
text: mansion is gone. Total destruction.
text: ROWAN comes out of her trance.
text: She races to the pool and dives in and resurfaces with MICHAEL'S lifeless body. She drags him
text: up onto the ground - and frantically tries to revive him over and over again.
text: Finally - she SMASHES his chest as she did long ago - but MICHAEL lies still. She drops upon
text: him, exhausted - weeping, inconsolable... Then -- she looks up to the sky - fury and tears in
dialog: her eyes.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: You betrayed him! All of you! Look! LOOK AT HIM!!! He
dialog: believed there was goodnese in you - and you BETRAYED
dialog: him!
text: She stands, seething - like a volcano about to erupt. Thinking. Focusing. Something is
text: coming together inside her... she is remarkable. She reaches to the sky -
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: I AM THE THIRTEENTH! I AM THE KEY! COME THROUGH
scene_heading: THE DOOR! ALL OF YOU - COME - THROUGH - THE - DOOR!
text: And the fabric of the sky tears... An ererald haze shows beyond it... Arid the PHANTOM-WITCHES
text: come soaring through the gash in the world - speeding toward their mistress...
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: All of us are one - from the beginning to now! So I command you -
dialog: come into me! Mlake THIRTEEN ONE!
text: AND THE WITCHES SWOOP DOWN - AND DIVE INTO ROWAN - FILL HER - BECOME HER. SHE BRIMS WITH
scene_heading: POWER. ALMOST A CELESTIAL GLOW.
text: She kneels beside MICHAEL, takes his hands and presses them against her heart. Her tears
text: cascade down her cheeks...
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Come back to me, Michael. Please, Michael --- come back. I love you
dialog: I LOVE YOU, MICHAEL! Oh, God - COME BACK TO ME!
text: She leans down and kissea him - deeply, deep as their love - long, long, long...
dialog: And ---
text: MICHAEL opens his eyes. Rasping, coughing, shaking with the new life Rowna has given him...
text: ROWAN, on her knees, lifts him up and cradles his head in her chest...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (barely a whisper)
dialog: Lasher... Where --- where is ---
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (loving. soothing)
dialog: It's alright...it's airight. He's gone, Michael... Gone.
scene_heading: SLOW ZOOM INTO ROWAN'S FACE
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Everything's gone, Michael. Everything except for us. (pause)
dialog: But we're here. Together. You and I...
speaker_heading: HOLD ON ECU OF ROWAN
text: She smiles strangely, and --- HER FACE FLICKERS.... AND THEN, FROM SOME NEW INNER CURRENT, HER
text: FACE STROBES B1ZARRELY WITH THE FACES OF TWELVE OTHERS WHO CAME LONG BEFORE HER...
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (very very softly)
dialog: Just you and...
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
