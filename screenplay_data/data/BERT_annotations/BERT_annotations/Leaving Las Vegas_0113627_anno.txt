dialog: September 1994
scene_heading: TITLE ON BLACK; '10 P.M. - LOS ANGELES'
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. SMART BAR IN BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT
dialog: It is the kind of bar where the well-to-do folks of LA go to
dialog: pick up - or be picked up. Lesser-known actors, agents and
dialog: executives of all ages.
dialog: Into this bar comes Ben.
text: Ben is in his thirties. He is wearing an Armani suit that
text: could use a visit to the dry-cleaner's. He hasn't shaved in
text: the last twenty-four hours (but neither has any of the actors
text: in the bar). He is a good-looking man but is clearly in
text: trouble of some kind. Although still in control of his
text: faculties, it becomes clear in the following scene that he
text: is much the worse for wear with drink. He looks around the
text: room until he sees someone he recognizes and then walks over
text: to a table where two couples are seated. The men are young
text: execs, the girls, both blonde and busty, have very white
text: teeth and smile all of the time. The camera follows Ben over
text: to the table. One of the execs looks up as Ben gets close.
text: He recognizes him but delays his recognition until the last
text: moment in the hope that Ben is not looking at him.

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Ben... how are you, man?
text: They shake hands. Ben is not invited to take a seat and Peter

dialog: the table.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Ben Sanderson, Marc Nussbaum, Sheila,
dialog: Debbie.
speaker_heading: MARC
dialog: Nice to meet you. | think | spoke to
dialog: you on the phone a couple of years
dialog: ago. Weren't you both at MGM with
dialog: Laddie?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: That's right. Are you still at ICM?
speaker_heading: MARC
dialog: No, I'm at Tri-Star now.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: That's great. Say hello to Mike for
dialog: me. That's a beautiful dress, Debbie,
dialog: and those are fabulous earrings,
dialog: Sheila.
text: There is an awkward silence. Ben does not make a move and is
text: not invited to join them. The girls smile.
speaker_heading: MARC
dialog: | gotta tell you, I'm a big fan of
dialog: your writing. | loved Bay of Pigs.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Thanks a lot. | didn't actually write
dialog: it, [just got the credit. |was

dialog: (to Peter)
dialog: Can | talk to you for a moment?
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
text: Peter gets up and he and Ben walk to the door together.
text: Peter speaks very quietly.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Listen, Ben, | can't help you any
dialog: more. Do you understand?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: This is the last time. Promise. |
dialog: just need some cash tonight. | lost
dialog: my credit cards. The money'll be on
dialog: your desk first thing tomorrow
dialog: morning, Scout's honor. How's the
dialog: new one coming along? | here you got
dialog: Richard Gere.
text: The two men look at each other for a while. Peter's friends
text: are looking at them, as are other people in the room. Peter
text: takes out his wallet and extracts some notes.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: This is all | have in cash. Please
dialog: don't drink it here.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yes, that's fine. I'll messenger it
dialog: over to you tomorrow.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: | don't want it. Ben... | think it
dialog: would be best if you didn't contact
dialog: me again.
text: And he turns and walks away, back to his table.

text: Credit sequence begins.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY OF EXPENSIVE HOTEL - NIGHT
text: A mixture of businessmen and gamblers creates a sense of
text: activity and superficial excitement. Music wafts across the
text: soundtrack, almost drowned by the dense texture of thousands
text: of slot machines, creating an insane New Age symphony.
text: Credit sequence ends.
text: Into the lobby from the street comes Sera.
text: It's hard to tell how old Sera is - somewhere between twenty-
text: five and thirty-five. She is a beautiful American girl. Her
text: face has the freshness of a model ina Sears catalogue. She
text: is dressed simply in a short black skirt and matching jacket.
text: High heels complete the picture.
text: Heads turn as she passes a group of businessmen and it's
text: clear they find her very sexy. She acknowledges their glance
text: with a half-smile and steps into the elevator.
dialog: She could be a secretary, or a PA to one of the many execs
text: here in Las Vegas at a convention. The body language is a
dialog: bit different, though.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE OF HOTEL - NIGHT
text: A view of night-time Las Vegas through a window. Traffic up
text: and down The Strip; bright, gaudy neon flashing and winking.
text: We hear the sound of men laughing and the camera pulls focus
text: and we see reflected in the glass...
dialog: ..@ group of people.
text: On the table are bowls of potato chips and dip and sandwiches.
text: The TV is on ata sports channel and two boxers pound the
dialog: shit out of each other.

scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
text: Sera looks at herself in the gold-tinted mirror in the
text: elevator. She takes out a lipstick and freshens her lips.
text: Some people get out and the elevator climbs higher. We see
text: from the indicator that she has punched the Penthouse button.
text: Camera moves in tighter and we see that she is nervous but
text: concealing it well. The elevator stops, the doors open and
text: she steps right into the Penthouse.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: A bottle of Scotch is almost empty. The man talking is Yuri.
text: He is Russian, in his early forties, a little overweight, a
text: big man wearing a blue silk suit. His thick black hair is
text: greased and combed back. He wears a lot of jewelry, all gold.
text: Rings, a bracelet and a Rolex. Two men in business suits and
text: a weird stoned woman in her late thirties listen to him.
speaker_heading: YURI
dialog: ..but please, my friends, call me
dialog: Yuri. It is my American name... |
dialog: picked it myself.
text: The three people laugh. There is a hint of contempt in the
dialog: way that they speak to Yuri.
speaker_heading: FIRST BUSINESSMAN
dialog: Where are you from, Yuri? | mean,
dialog: you sure don't talk like you're from
dialog: this neck of the woods.
text: Yuri smiles at them.
speaker_heading: YURI
dialog: (silky voice)
dialog: No... you are right, my friend. How
dialog: very observant you are. |am from
dialog: Latvia.
speaker_heading: WEIRD WOMAN
dialog: Tough place.
speaker_heading: YURI
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
dialog: Yes, | hear this too. But |am not a
dialog: tough man. | am a simple man who is
dialog: here to learn from my new American
dialog: friends.
text: The door opens and Sera comes in. Everybody stares at her.
speaker_heading: WEIRD WOMAN
dialog: (turned on)
dialog: Is this your friend, Yuri?
speaker_heading: YURI
dialog: Ah, yes... Sera.
text: The second businessman takes out a small manila envelope
text: from his inside pocket.
speaker_heading: YURI
dialog: Sera is my gift to you, my friends
dialog: from New York City. You may do with
dialog: her as you wish in this beautiful
dialog: room, which is also my gift for the
dialog: night to my friends. You will find
dialog: her a very willing girl, for all of
dialog: you... just as we arranged.
text: Yuri smiles again as the Second Businessman hands him the
text: envelope. The rest of them just stare at Sera, aroused by
dialog: the idea of her.
speaker_heading: SECOND BUSINESSMAN
dialog: Of course, Yuri. | think you'll find
dialog: this just as we discussed.
text: Yuri gets up.
speaker_heading: YURI
dialog: So, my friends... |have other
dialog: business to attend. Enjoy.
text: He heads for the door, passing Sera. She holds out his arm
text: as he passes.
speaker_heading: SERA
dialog: (whispering)
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
dialog: Yuri... please! Can | talk to you
text: for a moment.
text: Still smiling, he takes Sera's arm and leads her into the
dialog: bedroom.
speaker_heading: YURI
dialog: My friends... excuse me for just one
dialog: moment.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Mirrors reflect mirrors.
speaker_heading: SERA
dialog: | don't want this. Yuri, please. |
dialog: really don't want this. You know |
dialog: don't like to do groups.
speaker_heading: YURI
dialog: (playful)
dialog: | want this, Sera. | need this!
speaker_heading: SERA
dialog: Please, Yuri.
text: He holds put his arms. Sera goes to him. He hugs her with
text: one arm. He pulls up her skirt so that her panties are
dialog: exposed.
speaker_heading: YURI
dialog: (seductive)
dialog: These are pretty.
text: Sera watches in the mirror as he pulls her panties to reveal
text: her buttocks. He strokes her there gently with his other
text: hand. We see that there are two fine scars there. He speaks
text: gently, like a father to a daughter.
speaker_heading: YURI
dialog: Is this how you would repay me for
dialog: coming all this way to find you again?
text: Driving through the desert to protect
dialog: my little Sera.

text: from his jacket and opens it.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Yuri enters from the bedroom. The weird woman is doing a
text: line of coke.
speaker_heading: YURI
dialog: (cheerful)
dialog: Sera wanted me to ask if she might
dialog: undress at once for you. She has a
dialog: very beautiful undergarment which
dialog: she would like you to see.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BEDROOM DOOR
text: Sera comes into the room. She smiles and begins unbuttoning
dialog: her jacket.
text: She takes it off and drops it on the floor, and then unzips
text: her skirt and steps out of it. Sera is now in control and
text: playing the room. In the background. Yuri leaves the room.
speaker_heading: WEIRD WOMAN
dialog: (strange voice)
dialog: Come here.
text: Sera walks over and something strange takes place between
dialog: them.

scene_heading: INT. BEN'S BAR. LA - MORNING
text: The bar is dark but through a small window we see that it is
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
text: a very bright sunny day outside. The bartender reads the Los
text: Angeles Times. The bar surface is red vinyl. There are five
text: customers, all single men. One of them is Ben and he is
text: sitting at the bar watching TV. A game show is in progress
text: and the TV sound is loud. Ben finishes his drink and grimaces
text: before indicating to the barman that he'd like a repeat.
text: Barman pours him a whiskey — Cranberry — and the camera
text: moves in closer to Ben, ending in a close-up. Ben takes a
text: big hit from the drink and concentrates on the TV. We hear
text: from the TV sound that it is a word game with a big prize.
text: Ben smiles to himself.
speaker_heading: BEN'S POV OF TV
text: The talk show hostess, an American TV beauty, is showing the
text: audience the prizes available in today's game show.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON BEN
text: As he finishes that drink and asks for another. The camera
text: moves in close on his eyes.
speaker_heading: BEN'S POV OF TV
text: She turns from the prizes and looks straight into the TV
text: camera, which starts zooming into her. At first, what she is
text: saying makes complete sense, but then things change...
speaker_heading: HOSTESS
dialog: (smoky, sexy voice)
dialog: Just look at this studio, Ben, filled
text: with glamorous merchandise, including
dialog: an extra special prize chosen just
dialog: for you! A big, bad, BMW motorcycle,
text: complete with saddle bags stuffed
dialog: with thousands of US dollars.
text: "There are oohs" from the audience.
speaker_heading: HOSTESS
dialog: So, Ben,
dialog: (tosses her hair)
dialog: let's find a bar, get drunk and go
dialog: for a ride.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
text: The studio lights dim.
speaker_heading: HOSTESS
dialog: Then we can get a suite somewhere
dialog: and order up a case of champagne
dialog: while we fuck ourselves silly.
text: Close-up on males in the audience doing the grunt.
speaker_heading: HOSTESS
dialog: This is it, just for you, Ben.
text: She unbuttons her top, licks her fingers and makes her nipples
dialog: hard.
speaker_heading: HOSTESS
dialog: Because you've been so patient, and
dialog: because | want to fuck you, take
dialog: care of you, and because there's
dialog: nothing else in the world worth doing.
text: Section of the audience clapping - some women dabbing their
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: HOSTESS
dialog: Tell you what, Ben, let's go to Las
dialog: Vegas. The bars stay open twenty
dialog: four hours night and day. Just you,
dialog: just me, Ben, think about it, all
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON BEN
scene_heading: LOST IN HIS FANTASY
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'l think about it.
text: He looks back at the screen, but the show has returned to
text: what is known as "normal". He finishes his drink and then an
text: attack of nausea hit him. He takes a deep breath and rolls
text: his neck and his head. The barman puts down a fresh drink.
text: Ben looks at his own hands... which are steady.
speaker_heading: BARMAN
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
dialog: You should go on that show.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SMART BUSINESS SPACE - MORNING
text: Ben sitting ata desk with a phone wedged on his ear, a cup
text: of black coffee on the desk. The walls are covered with framed
text: film posters and one complete wall has shelves jammed with
text: scripts. He nods from time to time and sometimes says 'yes'
text: or ‘OK’, but it becomes clear that there is no one on the
text: other end. He drinks from the coffee cup. A woman comes up
text: to his desk, a business colleague. She puts a wad of messages
text: down on the desk.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yeah, but what's the back end like?
dialog: By the time we're through with P and
dialog: A, the above-the-ine is going to
dialog: take it to about fifteen and with
dialog: something like this... | don't know
dialog: if Disney will go for it... can |
dialog: call you back on this? OK... chow

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (pulling himself
dialog: together)
dialog: I'm fantastic, but | gotta go out
dialog: now... very important meeting, could
dialog: make a coupla million for the company.
text: Ben gets up and as he passes her he grabs her and dances a
text: few steps. It is clear that she likes Ben, but when his face
text: gets close to hers she smells the alcohol on his breath and
text: she turns away. Ben stops dancing and smiles sadly.

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (tender)
dialog: Ben?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You should go now.
text: She leaves the room and Ben goes through some routine at the
text: desk. He opens a drawer of a filing cabinet and puts in his
text: whole arm, looking for something at the very back. He pulls
text: out a small vodka bottle and opens it and then pours the
text: contents into his coffee cup. With cup in hand he leaves the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SMART OFFICE - DAY
text: Ben is sitting opposite his boss, Mr. Simpson, who is very

dialog: (genuinely moved)
dialog: This is to generous Peter.
speaker_heading: SIMPSON
dialog: (close to tears)
dialog: Well... we liked having you around,
dialog: Ben, but you know how it is.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (ashamed)
dialog: Sure thing...and I'm sorry.
text: Ben takes a swig from his coffee cup.

scene_heading: INT. BEN'S BMW , DAY
text: Ben drives though Beverly Hills. He pours the content of a
text: small bottle of vodka into an empty Coke can, puts the empty
text: bottle under the seat and then drinks from the can.
text: He slips a tape into the player and we hear "Lonely
text: Teardrops", by Michael McDonald, one of Ben's favorite songs.
text: At a traffic light a cop on a bike pulls up next to him and
text: Ben takes a pull from the Coke can and smiles, mouths the
text: word "hot". The cop nods back at him, the light changes and
text: they both pull away.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MONICA STREET , DAY
text: Ben carries a brown paper bag which clinks. Camera follows
text: him as he walks down the street. He looks at...
speaker_heading: BEN'S POV
text: A girl walking ahead of him in the same direction. She is
text: walking her dog. She is attractive from behind. We hear Ben's
dialog: thoughts.
speaker_heading: BEN (V.O.)
dialog: Beautiful, no just the shape which
dialog: is nice, but the whole walk, the
dialog: feeling, the movement. This girl is
dialog: pleased with herself. Maybe this is
dialog: the only art | can appreciate... |
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
dialog: don't know if this is good or bad,
dialog: but right now she is really beautiful.
dialog: When I was a boy it would have been
dialog: really important that she have a
dialog: pretty face, to go with this body, |
dialog: mean. | still would like to see her
text: face, but her beauty is no dependent
text: on her face.
text: The dog gets interested in something on the sidewalk and she
text: bends down to pull at its collar.
speaker_heading: BEN (V.O.)
dialog: | wonder what kind of panties she's
dialog: wearing. Shit, that's too specific,
dialog: but... on the other hand, you can
dialog: never be too specific... but then,
dialog: the infinitesimal must be, by
dialog: definition, as infinite as the
dialog: infinite.
text: Suddenly the girl stops. Ben catches up with her and cannot
text: resist looking into her face.
speaker_heading: BEN (V.O.)
dialog: God, she's so young.
text: The girl sees Ben and smiles an innocent smile,
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Hi!

dialog: looking for you.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What did they look like?
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Suits. | didn't tell them anything.
dialog: You know anything about gears?
text: Ben takes a look. The gear mechanism is all bent out of shape.
text: He bends down to have a look. It is clear from the way he
dialog: deals with this mechanical problem that he's good with his
text: hands. He doesn't try to force anything but he moves the
text: chain and gear mechanism to get to the problem.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: How'd this happen?
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: | was going real fast down on the
dialog: beach and something slipped and
dialog: everything got jammed up.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: The news is not good, kid. This bit
dialog: here... see there... it's broken.
dialog: You need a new one.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: (upset)
dialog: How much, do you think?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: | don't know. I'll find out though.
text: Ben gets up, picks up his bottles and heads for his house.

scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
text: Ben is naked and the shower can be heard in the background.
text: The house is austere, only the minimum of furnishing. He
text: pours a large tumbler of vodka and takes a gulp, then tops
text: up the glass. He turns on the stereo, selects a record —
text: Miles Davis, Kind of Blue — and puts it on the turntable.
text: He turns on the cassette recorder and inserts a new blank
text: tape. He puts the machine into the record mode. He kneels
text: down next to the deck and with complete precision puts the
text: needle on the second track without any problem. The music
text: starts and continues through the next sequence.

scene_heading: INT. LVING SPACE - DAY
text: Showered and shaved and wearing a smart dark suit, Ben looks
text: handsome and normal. He selects another record and again
text: sets up the cassette machine to record. He turns the stereo
text: up full and dances by himself while watching MTV silent. He
text: tries a turn which is a bit ambitious and loses his balance.
text: In slow motion we see him fall. Ben lies still on the floor.

speaker_heading: YURI
dialog: Why did you run away from me in Los

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: SERA
dialog: (dead serious)

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Listen, angel... the thing is that

speaker_heading: BEN (0.S.)
dialog: Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: SERA
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I've come this far... here | am, in
dialog: your house. | want you to let me pay
dialog: the rent for this month. All right?
text: And he stares at her as if to say that nothing can happen

speaker_heading: SERA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Because... it's better for me that
dialog: way. OK?
speaker_heading: SERA
dialog: Well... OK...
text: She is uncomfortable.
text: They sit in silence for a while.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Sera... |hope that you understand

dialog: think you're talking to me right now
dialog: about money.
speaker_heading: SERA
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No. I think you're talking about

dialog: twisted life into your soul.
speaker_heading: SERA
dialog: | know that...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: ..and I'm not here to demand your
dialog: attention to the point where it
dialog: changes your life. We know I'ma
dialog: drunk... but that seems to be all
dialog: right with you. And | know that you're
dialog: a hooker. | hope you understand that
dialog: I'm a person who is totally at ease
dialog: with this... which is not to say
dialog: that I'm indifferent or that | don't
dialog: care... | do... it simply means that
dialog: I trust and accept your judgement.
dialog: What I'm saying is... that | hope
dialog: you understand that | understand.
speaker_heading: SERA
dialog: Thanks, | do understand. | was worried
dialog: about how that would be... but now
dialog: I'm not. And you should know that
dialog: included with the rent here is a

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Ah, yes... Suppose sooner or later
dialog: we ought to fuck.
speaker_heading: SERA
dialog: Whatever that means. Open your
dialog: presents.
text: She hands him the larger of the two parcels.
speaker_heading: SERA
dialog: Open this one first.

text: A genuine smile comes on to his face.
speaker_heading: BEN
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
dialog: Very nice.
text: He holds the shirt against himself.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: This should work very nicely with my

dialog: item of clothing | brought over from
dialog: the motel with me.
text: Sera raise an eyebrow.
speaker_heading: SERA
text: Right... the suitcase was clinking.
dialog: So what did you do with your clothes?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I threw them into the garbage, which
dialog: was perhaps immoral, but | wanted to
dialog: come to you clean, so to speak. |
dialog: thought we could go shopping and
dialog: pick up a pair of jeans and forty-
text: five pairs of underwear and just
dialog: throw them out each day.
speaker_heading: SERA
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In
dialog: between the hundred and one proof
text: breath and the occasional drool,
dialog: some interesting words fall from
dialog: your mouth.
text: She hands him the last present.
speaker_heading: SERA
dialog: Now, try this one.
text: Ben unwraps the smallest gift. It is a silver hip flask. He
text: is very touched and a little tear trickles down his cheek.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well... looks like I'm with the right
dialog: girl.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
text: He turns it in his hands.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: | must say that I'm very impressed
dialog: that you would buy this for me. |
dialog: know you wouldn't do this without
dialog: thinking about it. Funny... you did
dialog: just what | would have done.
text: Ben stands and tries the flask in his pocket for fit. It is
text: fine. He walks to the door.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'm going to fill it right now.
speaker_heading: SERA
dialog: Do you want to go gambling tonight?
dialog: We could go out and play for a few
dialog: hours.
text: Ben comes back into the room, takes the flask out of his
text: suit pocket and has a drink.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: | hadn't planned to gamble... but if
dialog: you would keep the bulk of my money
dialog: here, then | could safely blow a
dialog: couple of hundred bucks.
text: He takes out all of his money, peels off a few hundreds and
text: then gives her the rest.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Giving you money makes me want to
dialog: come.
speaker_heading: SERA
dialog: Then come.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll
dialog: be half an hour.
text: And she leaves. There is a slight edge to her voice and Ben

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: SERA
dialog: | expect some kind of loyalty here.

speaker_heading: BEN

scene_heading: INT. CASINO - NIGHT
text: They walk around the huge space, which is full of people and
text: energy, and suddenly Ben grabs Sera and pushes her against a
text: slot machine and kisses her deeply. At first she resists and
text: then she gives in to him and responds. They knock over some
text: change, which falls to the floor, and Ben pulls from her a
text: beat to bend down and scoop up all the change and hand it to
text: the bemused player, before returning to Sera's mouth or more.
text: They break for air and then Ben leads her towards the bar.
text: As he waves to attract the barman's attention, she squeezes

speaker_heading: SERA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Ilove you.
text: But he doesn't hear her.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CASINO ACTIVITY

speaker_heading: SERA
dialog: Well -| was prepared for worse,

dialog: You seemed just fine, a little drunker

dialog: strange, but then your head started
dialog: to droop and | put my arm on your
dialog: shoulder and then, wham, you swung
dialog: you arm at me, and fell backwards
dialog: off your stool into a cocktail
dialog: waitress. You smashed everything on
dialog: her tray, it was a real mess. You
text: kept yelling and yelling.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Oh, and what did you do?
speaker_heading: SERA
dialog: I tried to shut you up and help you
dialog: to your feet but you kept swinging
dialog: at me — not like you wanted to hit
text: me, but more just waving me away.
dialog: Security came and when you saw them
dialog: you stopped yelling. They wanted to
dialog: carry you out and dump you on the

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: That's impressive. How did you do
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: We?

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (holds her hand)
dialog: What happened then?
speaker_heading: SERA
dialog: You were OK for a while, so we walked
dialog: for about a block and then you said
dialog: you wanted to go home and fuck, but
dialog: | think even you knew that wasn't
dialog: going to happen. We got a cab and
dialog: you asked him to stop at a liquor
dialog: store, even though | told you that
dialog: we had plenty at home. In the store
dialog: you gave the kid a hundred and told
dialog: him to keep the change. | asked you
dialog: if you knew it was a hundred. You

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: That's amazing. What are you? Some

dialog: not talk about it any more, please.
dialog: Not another word.
