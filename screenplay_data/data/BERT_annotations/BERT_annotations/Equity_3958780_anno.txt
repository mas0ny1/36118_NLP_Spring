scene_heading: INT. NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE. MORNING 1
text: A sea of people BUZZING in excitement -- reporters,
text: officials, men in dark suits. Occasional flashes of color as
text: women in brighter attire elbow through the crowd. Screens
text: hover overhead, each alive with rows of numbers.
text: Traders shouting orders, flashbulbs popping, constant
text: videotaping on cell phones.
speaker_heading: IPO REPORTER #1 (0.S.)
dialog: What a historic day Eric!
text: And now we pull back, realizing that the chaos at the stock
text: exchange is actually happening on a TV screen.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY 2
text: We see the face of a beautiful woman, her sharp eyes focused
text: on the screen. This is NAOMI, early 40’s, poised, tough,
text: brilliant, and pissed off by what she’s watching.
text: On the TV, a bubbly female reporter holds court at the edge
dialog: of the crowd.
speaker_heading: IPO REPORTER #1
dialog: You’ve seen the hordes of people
dialog: cheering, just now I think we had
dialog: the biggest WOO I’ve heard all day.
dialog: Nobody expected Dynacorps stock to
dialog: climb to 47--
text: An impersonal sleek hotel room. Naomi gazes at the TV, as she
text: gets ready to head out for a day of meetings. A second
text: reporter, back at the studio.
speaker_heading: IPO REPORTER #2
dialog: This IPO is certainly one of the
dialog: biggest we've seen this year--
text: Naomi shuts off the TV.
text: She keeps her gaze on the empty screen a moment. She exhales.
speaker_heading: TECH CEO (0.S.)
dialog: So, what happened with Dynacorps?
scene_heading: INT. SUSHI RESTAURANT. NIGHT 3
text: NAOMI wines and dines an eager 25-year-old male CEO of a tech

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: They elected to work with Channing
dialog: Trust for the offering.
speaker_heading: TECH CEO
dialog: But you had a long history with
dialog: those guys, didn’t you?
text: She meets his gaze. Around them, chopsticks fly over colorful
text: platters.
speaker_heading: TECH CEO (CONT’D)
dialog: Word is you low-balled them on
dialog: pricing.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Pricing is a judgment call.
speaker_heading: TECH CEO
dialog: But ultimately they IPO’d at the
dialog: higher price.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Listen Doug, I’ve taken 9 Silicon
dialog: Valley companies public in the last
dialog: five years. You want to talk about
dialog: the one I didn’t take to the finish
dialog: line?
text: Naomi leans forward, enjoying herself.
speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: Here's what nobody wants to admit.
dialog: Everything is a judgment call. And
dialog: yes, you need to trust your banker,
dialog: because this is a partnership. You
dialog: guys are the innovators, who can
dialog: build technology the rest of us are
dialog: not even imagining. But without
dialog: funding, that’s just tinkering ina
dialog: garage. I work for the largest
dialog: investment bank in the world. And
dialog: we both know I found you guys
dialog: capital when you were a couple of
text: kids with a laptop and a dream. So
dialog: we can talk about last year’s IPO
dialog: calendar, or we can talk about how
dialog: to grow your company so you can
dialog: build technology that’s going to

text: We track through the apartment, finding the remnants of

text: bottle, a pair of discarded high heels.
text: On the balcony, MICHAEL pours amber scotch into a glass. He
text: is late 40s, handsome and charismatic. He hands the glass to
text: Naomi. Michael is sharp; nothing gets past this guy.
text: They are in Michael's dimly lit enormous loft apartment.
text: Michael plays with Naomi’s hair.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: NAOMI

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Naomi.

speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You lost a major client.

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Are you saying I should be worried?
text: He hesitates.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No. You’ll be fine.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: It’s late.

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: NAOMI

scene_heading: INT. REMSON OFFICES. DAY 8
text: Naomi walks past a conference room with 10 senior male

text: Naomi clicks through her email with lightning speed.
text: ERIN enters the office in a stylish suit, carrying a heavy

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: You read up on the companies? Which
dialog: one stands out?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I was looking at--

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Cachet. I’ve got a hunch they’re

dialog: numbers on them?
text: Erin glances down at her book. She does not have those
dialog: numbers.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I will send them right over.
text: Naomi nods and starts typing something. She notices Erin is
text: still standing there.
speaker_heading: ERIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Everyone's saying there’s going to
dialog: be some movement around here... and
dialog: I am wondering if this might be the
dialog: time to--
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: No, not right now.
text: Naomi’s fingers fly over the keyboard. Erin does not budge.
text: Naomi finally turns her full attention to her.
speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: I told you I’d make a push for you.
dialog: And I will. But right now HR is out

speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I get that. But I’ve been under-

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: It’s a down year. And I am still

speaker_heading: ERIN

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Clients, for one.
speaker_heading: ERIN

scene_heading: INT. ERIN’S OFFICE. NIGHT 10
text: A janitor pushes a mop down the quiet deserted hallway. Only

text: In one of them, Erin revises graphs in a smaller, but still
text: nicely-decorated office.
text: She rubs her eyes, stretches her neck, and reaches for a
text: plastic cup of green juice which has the word KALE scribbled
text: on it. She grimaces as she drinks.
scene_heading: INT. NAOMI’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM. NIGHT 11
text: Naomi gets ready for bed, washing her face, taking out her
text: diamond earrings. Her jewelry is neatly arranged in boxes
dialog: from Tiffany's.
text: She climbs into bed, switching on a flatscreen TV, clicking
text: to resume an episode of Scandal.
text: Her laptop BINGS. She mutes Scandal as she grabs the laptop,
text: and opens an attachment from Erin, labeled CACHET. She begins
text: expertly scanning the data.
scene_heading: INT. REMSON OFFICES. DAY 12
text: Naomi moves swiftly through the office, looking over the
text: papers as she walks, Erin at her side.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: These are their latest projections?

speaker_heading: NAOMI

speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Teddy. I told you, he’s careless.
text: Naomi stops abruptly. Turns so she can see in the distance a
text: bunch of young Associates at their cubicles.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: When did they all start growing
dialog: these mustaches?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I’m sure there’s a bet.
text: TEDDY, 24, boyish with a hint of a mustache, laughs loudly,
text: projecting nothing but ease and confidence.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Who’s fucking kid is he again?
speaker_heading: ERIN

speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. REMSON OFFICES. MORNING 13
text: Naomi walks briskly towards Randall's office. Out of the
text: corner of her eye, she notices a 53 year old executive ina
text: nice suit carrying a box of belongings, flanked by two burly
dialog: security guards.
scene_heading: INT. RANDALL’S OFFICE. DAY 14
text: A gorgeous office with floor-to-ceiling windows. Many Lucite
text: trophies and framed portraits of bankers with executives.
speaker_heading: 9 Green Rev. (07/15/15)
text: Naomi faces RANDALL, Global Head of Equity Capital Markets,
text: late 50s, imposing, deliberate. He’s been at the top for a
dialog: long time.
text: A perky HR WOMAN, early 30’s, stands nearby, flipping through
text: a file, and watching Randall, who stares at a small tower of
text: Jenga blocks on his gleaming desk. Naomi waits, on edge.
text: Randall carefully pulls out a Jenga block. The tower barely
text: trembles.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Naomi. Thanks for coming in.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Of course.
text: Naomi glances at the HR woman.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: You know Leslie, from HR. She needs
dialog: a couple more names, from your
dialog: department.
text: Naomi relaxes almost imperceptibly, nods.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Teddy Sidel, and Arthur Abbott.
speaker_heading: HR WOMAN
dialog: You do know who Teddys’s uncle is?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: You asked me to identify the
dialog: weakest performers. What you do
dialog: with that information is up to you.
text: HR Woman smirks, nods to Randall, and goes.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: I’m sure you’ve heard the talk.
dialog: I’m gettin out. Retiring.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Congratulations.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: You never want to stay too late at

speaker_heading: 10 Green Rev. (07/15/15)
speaker_heading: RANDALL (CONT'D)
dialog: And this particular party is
text: sobering up.
text: Randall turns back to his blocks.
speaker_heading: RANDALL (CONT'D)
dialog: Your turn.
text: Naomi looks at him, a bit surprised. She reaches for one of
text: the blocks and pushes it gently.
speaker_heading: RANDALL (CONT'D)
text: Steady now.
text: Naomi pulls the block out; the tower remains intact.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: So they’1l be naming a new group
dialog: head.
text: He looks her in the eye.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Look, Naomi, I’m going to be frank
dialog: with you. This doesn’t look like
dialog: your year.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Because of Dynacorps.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: I’ve asked around about what
dialog: happened there. The perception
dialog: is... that you rubbed some people
dialog: the wrong way.
text: Naomi’s face is unreadable; she does not want to betray her
text: true feelings. Randall does not look away from her.
speaker_heading: RANDALL (CONT'D)
dialog: They're looking for a rainmaker.
text: Naomi smiles tightly. We begin to hear the sounds of
text: punching, grunting.
scene_heading: INT. NAOMI’S APARTMENT. NIGHT 15

scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. NIGHT 16
text: Naomi refills her scotch and hands one to Michael.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I mean at least hit me with facts.
dialog: Use my numbers against me, but
dialog: perception-- what the fuck do I do
dialog: with that?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You never really told me, what
dialog: happened with Dynacorps.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I’m sure you read the tweets.
dialog: Apparently I wore the wrong outfit.
text: He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: The truth is I don’t know. And
dialog: it’s my fucking alarm clock. Three,
dialog: four in the morning, I’m asking
dialog: myself-- what the fuck happened??
dialog: Replaying the negotiations in my
dialog: head, the valuation, the pricing.
dialog: I’ve been in hundreds of those
dialog: meetings and I’ve never had one go
dialog: south.
text: He looks at her, surprised she is being so candid with him.
speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: You don’t do that, right? Men don’t
dialog: lose sleep over this stuff.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh we do. But we don’t turn on
dialog: ourselves. More fun to be pissed at
dialog: someone else.
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s the biggest deal you could

scene_heading: INT. MENTORING EVENT SPACE. EVENING 17
text: An lofty space lined with bookshelves and high windows.
text: Naomi mingles effortlessly, laughing and chatting with an
text: ethnically diverse crowd of women, mostly in their 20s. She
text: is a star, but an approachable one, with women clamoring to
dialog: talk to her.
text: SAMANTHA, beautiful, tough, and smartly dressed, watches
text: Naomi from across the room. She is familiar with Naomi’s

speaker_heading: 14 Green Rev. (07/15/15)
text: Naomi, Samantha, and three other women face the audience.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I guess the simplest answer is: I
dialog: like money.
text: Some people laugh nervously, but the women in the audience
text: are loving this. Sam listens.
speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: I do. I mean that’s the honest
dialog: answer. I like numbers, I like a
dialog: challenge, I love negotiation. But
dialog: let's just be clear. I really like
dialog: money. I like knowing I have it. I
dialog: grew up without money, in a house
dialog: where there was never enough. I was
text: raised by a single mom with four
dialog: kids. I took my first job on Wall
dialog: Street so I could pay for my little
dialog: brothers to go to college. Remson
dialog: gave me that chance and I’ve been
dialog: there ever since.
text: Naomi sees a woman nodding sympathetically.
speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: But I’m not going to stand here and
dialog: tell you I only do what I do so I
dialog: can take care of other people.
dialog: Because it is okay to do it for
dialog: ourselves. For how it makes us
dialog: feel. Secure? Yes. Powerful? When
dialog: you understand VALUE, COST, what we
dialog: will pay for, what we will risk,
dialog: and what we can build? That’1l get
dialog: you up in the morning.
text: Sam leans forward now, intrigued.
speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m glad it’s acceptable now for
dialog: women to talk openly about
dialog: ambition. But don’t let money be a
dialog: dirty word. We can like that too.

dialog: A less corporate, funkier conference room than those we have
text: seen. On the wall, a giant gold key made up of lines of code.
text: The CEO, ED, 29, is flanked by his CFO, IAN, a numbers wiz
text: who protects Ed like a younger brother, at the head of a
text: table crowded with casually dressed managers. Ed still has
text: the look of a kid who plays too many video games. Restless
text: energy pulses under his casual exterior.
text: Teddy and Bill distribute pitch books. Erin notices that the
text: pens say “Channing Trust,” left behind by the competition.
text: She casually flicks one into a nearby trashcan as Naomi
text: begins the pitch. Naomi lives for this; she is in her
dialog: element.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: When I was a kid, if you wanted
dialog: privacy, if you wanted to send a
dialog: secret message, you made invisible
text: ink with vinegar.
text: Teddy proudly displays a large seemingly blank piece of
dialog: poster board.
speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: And when you were ready to “go
dialog: public” you revealed your message
dialog: with grape juice.
text: Bill takes a large paintbrush dipped in grape juice and
text: “paints” across the posterboard. The Remson logo appears in
text: purple as he does this.
text: People are nodding, smiling. They appreciate this touch.
text: Naomi sees Ian and a few others opening the pitch book, and
text: gives a silent go-ahead to Erin. Numbers time.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: But Cachet has certainly taken
dialog: privacy to the next level, and we
dialog: are so pleased to have the chance
dialog: to foster that growth. If you open
dialog: your books to page 2, you’ll see in
dialog: the first model, that we are
dialog: predicting a valuation of $820
dialog: million at 34 to 36 a share.
text: Ian and Ed flip through the graphs and models.

speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Well, you’re certainly presenting
dialog: us with some compelling numbers...
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: You guys can see we’ve done our
dialog: homework. But that’s not why you’re
dialog: going to give us this deal.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Okay...
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I remember what you told me the
dialog: first day we met: we’re not a
dialog: social media company with privacy
dialog: settings, we’re a privacy company
dialog: that can build a social network. An
dialog: impenetrable social network. I
dialog: understood that. The NEED for that.
dialog: I felt it in my gut. Some people
dialog: thought you guys were paranoid,
dialog: investors wouldn't go for it. Now
dialog: fast forward: Edward Snowden, nude
dialog: photos of actresses, the Sony hack.
dialog: Your revenue jumps. Your
text: competitors start rolling out. But
dialog: we were ahead of the curve. Because
dialog: we understood that every day it
dialog: gets harder to trust people in this
dialog: world. And security is the hottest
dialog: commodity around.
text: Ed is nodding. Ian looks impressed. Others are too. Erin
text: catches Naomi’s eye. They’ve got this.

scene_heading: EXT. AIRPORT. DAY (STOCK FOOTAGE) 29

scene_heading: INT. ERIN’S OFFICE. DAY 31

speaker_heading: IPO REPORTER #1
dialog: The privacy company Cachet is going

scene_heading: INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE. DAY 33
text: We are back on Naomi watching her TV screen.
speaker_heading: IPO REPORTER #1
dialog: Apparently some money managers were
dialog: surprised to hear this news, after
dialog: Bishop was reported to ruffle some

scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL’S APARTMENT. NIGHT 34
text: Naomi eyes are on her BlackBerry. Michael playfully takes it
text: from her, replacing it with a champagne glass. They clink
dialog: glasses.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You know what’s funny about the
dialog: privacy space? Half the world is
dialog: paranoid and the other half never
text: even resets their passwords.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: It’s true.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: For 20 years, my password for
dialog: everything was Rudolphl.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Like the reindeer?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I had a dog. When I was a kid.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Ahww.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What about you? Lamest password?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I’m not telling you my passwords.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Old ones. Circa 1996.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Bankerchick.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Now that is hot.
text: He grabs her roughly for a kiss. She presses against him,
text: smelling him, unzipping him as THE BUZZER sounds.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: (Frustrated) That’s Erin.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Who?
text: Naomi buttons her blouse as Michael zips up.
speaker_heading: 23 Green Rev. (07/15/15)
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: My VP, she’s dropping off the

text: She presses the buzzer button.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (Amused) You buzz people up to my

speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Erin, nice to see you.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Hi, sorry--
text: Naomi takes the binders.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Goodnight!
text: Naomi shuts the door.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Where were we?
text: He pulls Naomi to him and tosses her onto the couch. They

scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. DAWN 35
text: The early morning light streaks through the window. Naomi is
text: twisted over Michael asleep on the couch.
dialog: We hear:
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (0.S.)
dialog: Hey babe. It’s me. You were a tiger
dialog: last night. Am I seeing you later?
speaker_heading: NAOMI (0.S.)

speaker_heading: NAOMI (0.S.)
dialog: Michael -- we can’t be --

dialog: forward.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (0.S.)
dialog: You guys monitoring? You hear
dialog: anything about clients? ‘Cause the
dialog: only wall we’re crossing is... THE
text: WALL OF LOVE.
text: There is muffled laughter in the background, as if someone on

speaker_heading: NAOMI (0.S.)
dialog: You are an idiot.
text: Abby clicks off the recording.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Never a dull moment here in
dialog: compliance.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That’s his company phone? Is that
dialog: crossing the wall? I mean she’s on
dialog: the banking side--
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Well technically there’s nothing
dialog: criminal here--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Remson doesn’t have a policy
dialog: prohibiting this kind of romantic--
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Some banks do, but nope.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: And what’s your gut about this guy?
dialog: 37
speaker_heading: 25 Green Rev. (07/15/15)
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Michael? He’s got instincts. Some
dialog: people have instincts and some
text: people are getting a tip.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: We keep an eye on him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Frank mentioned you used to be an
dialog: AUSA? You ever miss it?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Wearing the white hat? Sure. But
dialog: you know what they say, you can’t
text: spread ideals on a cracker.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Do you actually know people who say
dialog: that?
text: Abby smiles politely.
scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL’S APARTMENT. MORNING 37
text: Michael makes espresso as a half-dressed Naomi making her way
text: down the stairs. He goes to her, plays with her hair.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What’s that?
text: He touches a tiny patch of reddish skin, barely visible just
text: below her jawline. She fingers it.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Nothing.
text: She begins to delicately put on her diamond earrings. He
text: admires her.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Remind me why I didn’t marry you.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Diamonds.
text: He looks curious.
speaker_heading: 26 Green Rev. (07/15/15)
speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: Remson Holiday party. Ninety-
dialog: something. Randall introduced us.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The St. Regis.
text: Naomi indicates the earrings.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: You asked me who bought these. And
dialog: I saw you, gearing up to fight off
dialog: some rival. But then I told you I
dialog: bought them for myself. After my
dialog: dad left I watched my mom leave her
dialog: best earrings at the pawn shop. We
dialog: never got them back. So I wanted to
dialog: be able to buy enough diamonds for
dialog: both of us.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You never told me that.
text: She smiles as if at an unspoken memory.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: But men like a girl they can take
dialog: care of.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah? Someone should warn them
dialog: about the alimony.
text: Naomi laughs. She pulls on her heels.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: You’re more fun divorced anyway.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: Well congrats again. People seem to
dialog: like Cachet. You remember my buddy
dialog: Marco?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: From Stanford. The tech blog guy?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: He’s always writing about privacy.
dialog: Encryption, whisper-phones, all
dialog: kinds of spy shit. Cachet could be
dialog: big.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: We certainly hope so.
dialog: 38
speaker_heading: 27 Green Rev. (07/15/15)
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I mean you think these Cachet guys
dialog: are onto something.
text: She looks at him, suddenly cautious.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: We do.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Due diligence started yet?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Michael.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You want a Chinese Wall in my
dialog: living room? I didn’t ask you
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I just think it’s simpler, not to
dialog: talk shop.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You think that some of the time.
text: She looks at him sharply.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean if it’s about you, your

dialog: to talk shop.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: That’s completely different.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Okay.
text: She set down her cup very deliberately.
speaker_heading: NAOMI

speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: No no, don’t get up. I’m with a

speaker_heading: NAOMI

speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)

text: She looks at Erin, noticing she has barely touched her

speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean we all understand the value
dialog: of privacy.

speaker_heading: ERIN

speaker_heading: GABE

speaker_heading: ERIN

speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Clothes. Maternity. My sister sent

speaker_heading: ERIN

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Good afternoon, everyone. We'd like

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Let’s do it. Where are we at?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: At this point, we’re looking at a
dialog: range of $32 to $34 a share. At 7.2
dialog: million shares, that gives us a
dialog: valuation of 868 million--
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Now just a minute here--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: We gotta have a billion valuation.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: We've looked at the comparables,
dialog: and--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You said $34 to $36 in the pitch.
dialog: You’re going to leave tens of

speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: We can get at least 35.

speaker_heading: NAOMI

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Look, you begged me for this IPO.
dialog: You want me to call Channing Trust?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Ed, what we want to avoid is a down
dialog: round--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: We know what happened with your
dialog: last IPO.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I don’t think that’s relevant here--
text: All eyes are on Naomi. Erin speaks up.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Ed, I believe our goal here is to
dialog: find the right number for all of

text: Ed turns to her.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: The number is 35.
text: Erin glances briefly at Naomi, as if asking permission. Naomi
text: nods almost imperceptibly.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Possibly. But you can think of it
dialog: like a party. We need to encourage
text: people to show up to the party.
dialog: Could be the best party in the
dialog: world, but if nobody shows up--
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: A party?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: We don’t need to--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No, hang on. I get this. A party.
dialog: Go on--
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: The $32 to $34 range will get

speaker_heading: ERIN

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, I’m not sure how I can help

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Of course. But these hedge fund
dialog: guys they’ve always got a loophole,
dialog: some way of staying out of trouble.
dialog: But they need a guy like you,
dialog: right, at a big bank? And you don’t
dialog: have so many loopholes. You’ve got
dialog: regulations, compliance looking

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Take the fall for what?

speaker_heading: 43 Green Rev. (07/15/15)
speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: SAM

dialog: But why?
speaker_heading: MARIN
text: The challenge. The naked photos.
dialog: Who knows.
text: forward and continues quietly.
speaker_heading: MARIN (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s called a man in the middle

dialog: possibility of somebody implanting

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Does Ed know about this?
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: He thinks I’m paranoid. Which is
dialog: pretty funny, when a company that’s

dialog: paranoid.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: But why tell me?
speaker_heading: MARIN

text: Ed smiles warily.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Sounds like you met Marin.
speaker_heading: NAOMI

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: You need your employees to be as

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Look, I can promise you we’ve never

speaker_heading: NAOMI

speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: It's risky territory. When he comes
dialog: on to you, and he will at this

speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yeah. I know how this works.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Okay then.
text: They walk in chilly silence.
speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: (Coolly) Then maybe you can find a

speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I’1l handle it.
