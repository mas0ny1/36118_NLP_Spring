text: MRS BROWN BY JEREMY BROCK
scene_heading: EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT
text: Begin on black. The sound of rain driving into trees.
text: Something wipes frame and we are suddenly hurtling through
text: a forest on the shoulders of a wild-eyed, kilted JOHN
text: BROWN. Drenched hair streaming, head swivelling left and
text: right, as he searches the lightening-dark. A crack to his
text: left. He spins round, raises his pistol, smacks past
text: saplings and plunges on.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT
text: Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree and heaves for
text: air. A face in its fifties, mad-fierce eyes, handsome,
text: bruised lips, liverish. He goes on searching the dark.
text: Stops. Listens through the rain. A beat. Thinking he
text: hears a faint thump in the distance, he swings round and
text: races on.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT
text: BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's
text: length, breath coming harder and harder. But even now
text: there's a ghost grace, a born hunter's grace. He leaps
text: fallen branches, swerves through turns in the path, eyes
text: forward, never stumbling once.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT
text: BROWN bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and
text: stops. With his pistol raised, he turns one full slow
text: circle. His eyes take in every swerve and kick of the
text: wildly swaying trees.
text: There's a crack and a branch snaps behind him. He spins
text: round, bellows deep from his heart:
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: God save the Queen!!
dialog: And fires.
text: Nothing happens. The trees go on swaying, the storm goes
text: on screaming and BROWN just stands there, staring into
text: empty space. A pause.
text: Slowly, he starts to frown as the fact begins to dawn on
text: him that he is alone. He stares at the thrashing trees,
text: waving their mocking arms at him. His hand lets the pistol
text: drop to his side. He feels the rain drench down his face.
text: And now, for the first time, we see that his socks have
text: fallen to his ankles and his knees are cut to shreds. He
text: shifts a foot. His dress-shoes are covered in mud. He
text: goes on staring into the dark. Nothing.
text: Just the wind and rain. Gradually, we pull back, higher
text: and higher. As we do, we hear the quiet cultivated voice:
text: FADE TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: CAPTION: "1864"
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
speaker_heading: PONSONBY (V.O.)
dialog: I have sent for a Mr. John BROWN from
text: Balmoral. Her majesty has mentioned
dialog: him, on one or two occasions, as being
dialog: a most devoted outdoor servant to
dialog: Prince Albert during his last days
dialog: there...
text: John BROWN is now just a tiny figure dwarfed by the storm.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY
text: The screen is black. As the camera pulls back, we discover
text: that we are looking at a black night-gown.
text: Queen VICTORIA is sitting at her dressing table, while an
text: elderly HAIRDRESSER, also in black, works at her hair.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY (V.O.)
dialog: ... The depths of the Queen's sorrow
text: remain impenetrable. She has now
dialog: restricted herself to a regime of such
dialog: ferocious introspection that we are
dialog: all at our wits' end...
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRINCE ALBERT'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY
text: A bust of the Prince Consort is draped in black. His desk
text: is laid out as if for work. A VALET is brushing one of his
text: suits before laying it carefully on the bed.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY (V.O.)
text: ... The Household continues, at her
dialog: instruction, to observe the rituals
text: now so familiar to her, in a vain
dialog: attempt to render vivid that which can
dialog: never be revived...
text: Close-up on a small table as a shaving brush is placed
text: carefully beside a dish of freshly poured water.
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY
text: The hairdresser is pulling VICTORIA's hair back into the
text: widow's cape. For the first time, we see her face. It is
text: set in a mask of severity.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY (V.O.)
dialog: ... It will not surprise you to hear
text: that she continues steadfast in her
dialog: refusal to accept any public
dialog: engagements, however trivial...
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY
text: A bronze cast of Prince Albert's hand hangs above the Royal
text: bed. His sleeping-gown is laid out on one side.
text: A somberly dressed middle-aged man stands by the bed:
text: DOCTOR JENNER, the Queen's physician. He is placing
text: potions and medicaments in a row on the bedside table.
text: Behind him, TWO MAIDSERVANTS are busy stripping and
text: remaking the bed while another raises the window to air the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY (V.O.)
dialog: ... Family and staff expend all their
text: efforts endeavouring to draw her out
text: of this state of unfettered morbidity,
dialog: but to no avail. Indeed, Doctor
dialog: Jenner will not undertake to vouchsafe
dialog: her sanity, unless some remedy is
dialog: found...
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY
text: VICTORIA is turning slowly around as a young ASSISTANT
text: DRESSER completes the fastening on her black crepe dress.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY (V.O.)
dialog: ... We must hope, therefore, that this
dialog: Mr Brown will appeal to the Queen's
dialog: sentimental, though deeply-held, view
dialog: that all Highlanders are good for the
dialog: health. If she can at least be
dialog: persuaded to take the air, the
dialog: prospect of further recovery may seem
dialog: less remote...
text: The assistant dresser pulls too tightly on her dress.
text: VICTORIA winces slightly.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT DRESSER
dialog: (terrified)
dialog: Sorry, ma'am.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SEA FRONT, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY
text: We glide slowly past the coastline as a caption reads:
text: "ISLE OF WIGHT. 1864."
text: A DRIVER stands against the sea front with a horse and cart
text: bearing the Royal coat of arms.
text: John BROWN leads his pony along the dockside, towards the
text: waiting driver. He is in his late thirties, fit, handsome
text: and dressed in tartan kilt and short jacket.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY (V.O.)
text: ... He is arriving by boat this
dialog: afternoon, by which time it is hoped
dialog: Her Majesty will be in a fit state to
dialog: consider riding out...
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRIVATE SECRETARY'S ROOM - DAY
text: SIR HENRY PONSONBY, the Queen's Private Secretary, is
text: sitting at his writing desk, completing a letter.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY (V.O.)
dialog: ... As to that decision, along with
dialog: all others, we remain, as ever,
text: prisoners of the Queen's grief.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Ever your devoted husband, Henry.
text: He folds the letter and slips it into an envelope. He is a
text: middle-aged man in a dark mourning suit; tall, Saturnine
text: and with a civil servant's stoop. As he looks up, we see a
text: white-stockinged FOOTMAN standing to attention by the door.
text: PONSONBY hands the letter to him.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Windsor.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CAPTION: "OSBORNE HOUSE, ISLE OF WIGHT"
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR AND QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY
text: A series of windows are being slammed open by white
text: stockinged FOOTMEN as members of the ROYAL FAMILY and UPPER
text: HOUSEHOLD hurry by in silence, all dressed in mourning and
text: rushing to make the luncheon hour.
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY
text: Queen VICTORIA heads down the empty corridor with two
text: ladies-in-waiting, LADY ELY and LADY CHURCHILL, hurrying
text: along a pace behind.
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY
text: Members of the Royal family and upper household hurry into
text: the icy dining room and take their designated places at the
text: luncheon table. Everybody is dressed in mourning and
text: nobody speaks. Wind whistles through the open windows.
dialog: Silence.
text: Among the diners we catch our first glimpse of BERTIE, the
text: Prince of Wales. He is in his mid-twenties, plump, stiff
text: dressed and balding. He stands next to his young wife,
text: PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, who fiddles nervously with her shawl,
text: trying to keep warm.
text: As BERTIE smooths down his thinning hair, DOCTOR JENNER
text: bustles into the dining room, stands himself next to
text: PONSONBY and proceeds to conduct a hurried conversation
text: with the Prince of Wales, entirely in whispers.
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: Congratulations, Your Royal Highness!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Thank you, Doctor.
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: A boy, I hear. Excellent, excellent.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Albert Victor. Eddie for short. What
dialog: do you think?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: A fine choice, sir.
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: Excellent!
scene_heading: EXT. DOCKSIDE, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY
text: JOHN BROWN leads his pony gently up the ramp and into the
text: carrier bearing the Royal coat of arms. The DRIVER leans
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Are you riding up front?
text: BROWN looks straight at this man, quiet and reserved.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I'll stay with the pony, thank you.
dialog: She's all the way from Deeside and
dialog: she's not sure she likes you yet.
text: The DRIVER shrugs and slams the doors on them.
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR AND QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY
text: VICTORIA reaches the dining room door and takes a deep
text: breath. LADY ELY and LADY CHURCHILL stop a pace behind.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: How many?
text: LADY ELY is slightly taken aback.
speaker_heading: LADY ELY
dialog: The Royal Family and senior members of
dialog: the household, ma'am.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Just them?
speaker_heading: LADY ELY
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
text: VICTORIA closes her eyes, then steels herself and steps
text: through the door.
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY
text: Everyone stiffens as VICTORIA walks in. Acknowledging the
text: other diners with a quick nod, the Queen takes her place.
text: She flaps open her napkin and, bang on cue, everyone else
text: sits and does the same. The meal is served immediately by
text: waiting SERVANTS, who plonk the food down without ceremony.
text: It's a very ordinary meal of meat and vegetables. VICTORIA
text: starts eating heartily, straight away. Everyone does the
dialog: same.
text: Only the clink of cutlery and the same eerie silence.
scene_heading: EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY
text: The Royal horse-carrier rattles into the grounds and on
text: down the driveway past the beautiful, manicured lawns
text: stretching away towards the ornate twin towers of Osborne
text: House. A few outdoor servants watch its progress
dialog: curiously.
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY
text: The silence continues as VICTORIA finishes her plain
text: pudding. Immediately, servants appear at every place and
dialog: whip away the pudding bowls whether their owners have
dialog: finished or not. Nobody thinks this odd; it is part of the
text: routine. DOCTOR JENNER clears his throat.
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: We're expecting Brown this afternoon,
dialog: ma'am.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Whom?
text: A beat. VICTORIA takes a sip of water, dabs her mouth with
text: her napkin and rises. Everyone else rises too. Suddenly,
text: the Queen turns to Bertie's nervous wife, PRINCESS
text: ALEXANDRA, and proclaims abruptly:
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: That's a very pretty shawl you are
dialog: wearing, Alex. Silk suits you well.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But you are not eating enough. One
dialog: must not let vanity overrule one's
dialog: appetite.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
text: VICTORIA nods earnestly. Lost to the effect her words have
text: had, she marches out again. Behind her, she leaves
text: PRINCESS ALEXANDRA feeling humiliated and crestfallen in
text: front of all the others. BERTIE takes her hand and
text: squeezes tight, trying awkwardly to console.
scene_heading: EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - DAY
text: The horse-carrier pulls up outside the servant's entrance
text: and the DRIVER opens the doors.
text: JOHN BROWN pulls out a watch from his waistcoat and checks
text: the time. His eyes narrow critically.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I was due at a quarter past one.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're late.
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR - DAY
text: A few minutes later, JOHN BROWN strides down the long
text: corridor with PONSONBY at his side. Their journey takes
text: them down an endless series of corridors, past servants and
text: householders hurrying about their duties. The presence of
text: the dead Albert is felt all around in the black-wreathed
text: portraits and busts that crop up along the way.
text: BROWN and PONSONBY could not be more contrasted.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: (in low tones)
dialog: Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House
dialog: is not as you will remember it. The
text: Household remains in full mourning and
dialog: no-one is permitted to raise their
dialog: voice under any circumstances
dialog: whatsoever. As for the Queen's
dialog: routine, she breakfasts at nine
text: thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at
dialog: five thirty and dinner at eight forty
dialog: five. No one is allowed to leave the
text: building while the Queen is at home.
dialog: On the rare occasions when she is out,
dialog: you may ask permission to leave, but
dialog: only with my consent.
dialog: You're to be ready to walk the pony at
dialog: any time after ten o'clock. You'll
dialog: clean her outdoor things and do any
dialog: odd jobs as and when she requires.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: How will I know?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: (surprised to be interrupted)
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: How will I know what she requires?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: You'll be sent a message.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Who'll bring it to me?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Her Highness' Equerry.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I need a man who knows where I am.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: I'm sure it won't be difficult to find
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: That's not good enough.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Then we'll have to see what can be
dialog: arranged.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Aye, do.
text: PONSONBY stiffens. A beat.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: There is to be no communication with
dialog: other members of the household on
dialog: matters concerning the court except
dialog: through myself or one of the
dialog: Equerries. No plans must be altered
dialog: unless you are given prior authority
dialog: by myself or a senior member of the
dialog: household.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I came down at the Queen's request.
dialog: I'll take my orders from her.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: In matters concerning the Household, I
dialog: act on her behalf.
text: BROWN takes the measure of him.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I do.
text: BROWN glances up the corridor.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: So, is passing wind out of the
dialog: question or do I need permission for
dialog: that?
text: PONSONBY refuses to acknowledge what he has heard. They
text: reach the door of the Royal Chamber and he concludes the
dialog: interview.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: As I am sure you remember from
dialog: Balmoral, you do not talk while in Her
dialog: Majesty's presence unless Her Majesty
dialog: addresses you directly.
text: BROWN refuses to answer, so PONSONBY knocks. After a
text: moment, the door is opened by LADY ELY who ushers them in.
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY
text: BROWN walks stiffly into the room and stops. PONSONBY
text: waits by the door.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY (O.S.)
dialog: Mr Brown, ma'am.
text: VICTORIA is bent over the desk, working at one of her
text: numerous red boxes. She scribbles furiously at a letter,
text: underlining and accenting words as she goes. Finally, LADY
text: ELY steps up to her side and whispers something in her ear.
text: She carries on working.
text: BROWN has time to survey the room. Dominating everything
text: are the same black-wreathed busts and portraits of Prince
text: Albert glimpsed in the corridor.
text: Finally, VICTORIA nods and LADY ELY beckons BROWN forward.
text: He steps up in front of the desk and waits. VICTORIA looks
text: up and BROWN bows deeply.
dialog: Silence.
text: She stares at him for a long moment without apparently
text: registering who he is. He towers over her, in bright
text: tartan, while she sits hunched in her seat, all in black
text: and knotted with tension.
text: Finally, she finds her voice. She sounds nervous and edgy.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Mr Brown.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Ma'am.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: You are here safely.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Aye, ma'am.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: You are well?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: And the pony?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: She's well, too.
text: VICTORIA blinks at the sight of him. His presence is
text: bringing him back. A beat.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Your family sent cards. It was much
dialog: appreciated.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I'm glad of it.
text: In an effort to control her emotions, VICTORIA now sounds
text: the same severe note as at lunch. But BROWN, unlike
text: others, seems unaffected.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: My husband was always very
dialog: complimentary in speaking of you. He
dialog: would have approved, I am sure, of my
dialog: calling on you in this way.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I trust it does not inconvenience you
dialog: too much.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I've no family, ma'am, apart from my
dialog: brothers and sisters.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You have a brother in service here, do
dialog: you not?
dialog: (furrowing her brow)
dialog: I forget his name.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Archie.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That will be company for you.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
text: Silence. VICTORIA starts to tire. She takes a sip of
text: water and spills a little on herself. Flustered, she
text: searches for a hanky but cannot find one. LADY ELY hurries
text: up with one of her own and the Queen dabs it off. BROWN
text: watches all of this with genuine concern. When VICTORIA
text: finally looks up, he stares at her in deep sympathy.
speaker_heading: BROWN (CONT'D)
dialog: Honest to God, I never thought to see
dialog: you in such a state. You must miss
text: him dreadfully.
text: VICTORIA stares back in stunned silence. PONSONBY coughs
text: involuntarily. LADY ELY freezes. A beat.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: You do not - he ... get him out.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Get him out. Get him out!
text: Suddenly, BROWN finds himself tugged backwards out of the
text: room. LADY ELY rushes up to assist as VICTORIA shouts
text: herself into a fit of uncontrolled sobbing.
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - DAY
text: Some minutes later, BROWN is angrily unpacking a trunk.
text: His humiliation expresses itself in the extraordinary
text: ferocity with which he slams down every object.
text: His younger brother, ARCHIE, sits on the bed. He's in his
text: early thirties, bright, sharp and dressed in the same
text: distinctive kilt and tweed.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: (telling it fast)
text: So the day they arrive, she greets the
dialog: Sultan and his family with barely a
text: word and then retires to her chamber.
dialog: The Sultan, not used to State
dialog: Occasions without a head of State, is
text: standing in the lobby waiting for
dialog: someone to tell him what to do. But
dialog: the court is under strict instructions
dialog: not to talk in the corridors so nobody
dialog: speaks to him, not a living soul, for
dialog: the whole afternoon. So now it's
text: dinner and everyone's standing round
dialog: the table -- still not a word --
dialog: waiting for Her Majesty to arrive.
text: One hour goes by, two, the Sultan's
dialog: getting a wee bit peckish to say the
dialog: least. So finally, his wee laddy
text: breaks for the cold meats and stuffs a
text: slice in his mouth. Well, the uproar
dialog: when she heard. You'd have thought
dialog: someone had stolen the crown jewels.
text: BROWN stares back, still pissed off.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: So, there are rules. Things you do
dialog: and things you don't do.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I was just telling the woman how I
dialog: feel, for God's sake.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: You don't tell Her Majesty how you
dialog: feel.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I speak as I find, Archie.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Not down south you don't.
text: BROWN slams a drawer shut. ARCHIE lets it go and watches
text: his brother. A beat.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE (CONT'D)
dialog: So what did Ponsonby do when she
dialog: started shouting?
speaker_heading: BROWN
text: I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
text: A beat, then both men burst out laughing.
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, SERVANT'S HALL - DAY
text: The clatter of voices and banging doors as under servants
text: hurry about with plates, knives and forks, laying the Upper
text: Servant's huge table for dinner. ARCHIE leads BROWN
text: through this rush of activity.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Seventy a year.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Not bad, not bad.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: How about yourself?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Sixty.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: That's pretty good for a ghillie.
text: BROWN smiles dryly. They pour themselves a drink from the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Prince Leopold? Is he the one who
dialog: bleeds all day? So what does his
dialog: valet do? Wash his poultices for him?
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: It's better than shovelling horse
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: If you were looking for promotion, you
dialog: should have picked one of the
dialog: healthier ones.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
text: She's hardly a full hamper herself.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: (beat)
text: It's only grief makes her like she is.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Three years, John. Is that not a bit
dialog: long to be grieving?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: She loved him.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Come on, man. There's love and
dialog: there's ...
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: You know what I mean.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I'm not sure I do, Archie.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: There's love and there's behaving like
dialog: you do because there's nobody to tell
dialog: you not to.
text: Hold on BROWN. He lets it go and moves on. Across the
text: hall, he spots the pretty ASSISTANT DRESSER watching them.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Which one of us is she flirting with?
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: The good-looking one.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Aye? Then she's obviously not got
dialog: enough to do.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: You work the system right, you could
dialog: ask her yourself. Just be thankful
dialog: you're not working for Household. The
dialog: Queen never lets them out of her
dialog: sight. But wee spats like us can slip
dialog: through the net, easy.
text: A beat. BROWN stares straight at him.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I'm no wee spat, ARCHIE.
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - MORNING
text: The next day, VICTORIA and her ladies are hurrying down a
text: corridor on her way into the dining room. VICTORIA
text: suddenly stops and stares out of the windows. Her
text: entourage are several steps past her before they realize
text: what's happened and scurry back to take up their positions
dialog: behind.
text: Now we see what has caught her attention. BROWN is
text: standing in the courtyard below, by his pony. She watches
text: him for a moment, then without reacting, walks on.
scene_heading: EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - AFTERNOON
text: Some hours later. It is now raining.
text: A gaggle of ROYAL GRANDCHILDREN hurry out of a carriage
dialog: from their afternoon recreational while their NANNIES
text: frantically try to keep them dry under the umbrellas. John
text: BROWN stands tall and erect on the gravel while they rush
text: around him, laughing and giggling.
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - EVENING
text: Rain on the window. VICTORIA is walking in the opposite
text: direction down the corridor with her entourage. She stops
text: at the same place as before.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (as if she had not seem him
dialog: earlier)
dialog: Who is that?
text: Lady Ely peers through the rain.
speaker_heading: LADY ELY
dialog: It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: What is he doing there?
speaker_heading: LADY ELY
text: He appears to be ... standing by his
dialog: horse.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I made no request to go out riding
dialog: today.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: How long has he been there?
speaker_heading: LADY ELY
dialog: I don't know, ma'am.
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: He was observed earlier, I believe.
text: At this moment, PONSONBY comes down the corridor.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
text: Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the
dialog: courtyard. I have no wish to go
dialog: riding.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: I'm very sorry, ma'am. I can't
dialog: imagine -- he was certainly given no
dialog: instructions.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Please make sure it does not happen
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Of course, at once.
text: VICTORIA takes one last look and walks away.
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRIVATE SECRETARY'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT
text: Half an hour later, PONSONBY stands at his desk facing
speaker_heading: BROWN.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: What on earth did you think you were
dialog: doing?
text: BROWN stares straight back.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Awaiting my orders.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: You do not report for duty unless the
dialog: Queen requests it. You know that very
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I didn't come all this way to sit on
dialog: my arse.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: You will await your orders like
dialog: everyone else. Unless you prefer a
dialog: repeat of yesterday's little
dialog: excitement.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: I beg your pardon?
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - DAY
text: The next day. From a high window, we see PONSONBY
text: scuttling madly across the courtyard towards the figure of
text: JOHN BROWN, who is standing exactly as he was the day
dialog: before.
text: VICTORIA watches impassively.
scene_heading: EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, COURTYARD - DAY
text: PONSONBY stands close to BROWN, shouting in his face.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: I thought I made myself perfectly
dialog: clear. You do not leave your room
dialog: until Her Majesty requests it.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: (eyes straight ahead,
dialog: shouting back)
dialog: Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if
dialog: her husband was here now, he'd have
dialog: had her out of that house and getting
dialog: some air in her. What the hell's the
dialog: point in me being here otherwise?!
text: From the window above, VICTORIA takes in his words. A
text: beat. PONSONBY collects himself.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Go inside at once.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Is that the Queen's request?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Yes, it most certainly is!
text: BROWN turns, grabs the lead rein and leads his horse back
text: to the stables.
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, STABLES - DAY
text: A few minutes later, BROWN is in the process of stabling
text: his horse. Suddenly he turns.
text: VICTORIA is standing at the far end of the stable with her
text: entourage.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Mr Brown.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: You have been told repeatedly not to
dialog: stand in the courtyard unless
dialog: requested to do so.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Then why do you persist in doing it?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Because I think Her Majesty is wrong.
dialog: If ever there was a poor soul who
dialog: needed fresh air, it is her.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: The Queen will ride out if and when
dialog: she chooses.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: And I intend to be there when she's
dialog: ready.
text: Silence. The two of them stare at each other.
scene_heading: EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY
text: The next day, high and wide over the stunningly manicured
text: landscape. Long lawns, wind-cropped copses and in the
text: distance, the glittering sea.
scene_heading: EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY
text: VICTORIA sits side-saddle on a horse. BROWN leads her in
dialog: silence.
scene_heading: EXT. CLIFFTOP - DAY
text: VICTORIA looks up.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Prince Albert was going to build a
dialog: bench here. He thought it one of the
dialog: best views in Osborne.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: It's a fine spot, ma'am.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: He thought so, yes.
text: She stares ahead.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: In everything I do and everything I
dialog: say, I try to think, as much as
dialog: possible, what he would do, or say, if
dialog: he were here now. My Private
dialog: Secretary wishes me to return to
dialog: public duties--
text: She stops abruptly, but BROWN cuts in.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: If Prince Albert were here today, he'd
dialog: tell him a thing or two.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Sir Henry is not alone. They all wish
dialog: it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The same people who refused to grant
dialog: my husband the title of King because
dialog: he was deemed of insufficient rank--
text: She stops again, cutting quickly back to small-talk.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: It is a fine spot for a bench, is it
dialog: not?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Aye, ma'am.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Yes.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: I have some letters in the saddle bag.
dialog: I wish to read them.
text: BROWN walks up to her side, opens the saddle bag and hands
text: her a bundle of letters held together with ribbon.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: I cannot read them like that.
text: BROWN undoes the ribbon and tries again. VICTORIA cuts in.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: You will hand them to me as I require.
text: BROWN takes off the top letter and hands it to her.
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT
text: The clatter and crush of the Upper Servant's table as UPPER
text: SERVANTS sit themselves down to dinner while UNDER SERVANTS
dialog: prepare to serve soup.
text: ARCHIE comes in and sits himself somewhere in the middle
text: next to an empty seat. A moment later, BROWN strides in.
text: But instead of sitting at the place beside his brother, he
text: goes straight to the head of the table and plonks himself
text: down. Slowly, the clatter dies away as the whole room
text: stops and stares at him in silence. BROWN fixes them with
dialog: a look.
text: An elderly butler steps into the room and stares in
text: amazement at BROWN. A smooth young man, BERTIE'S VALET,
text: hurries up to intercede.
speaker_heading: BERTIE'S VALET
dialog: Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Not now he doesn't. This is my place.
speaker_heading: BERTIE'S VALET
dialog: By whose authority?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: My own.
text: A little frisson of oh-my-gawdness. BERTIE'S VALET stares
text: icily at him.
speaker_heading: BERTIE'S VALET
dialog: The order of seating at the Upper
text: Servant's table is arranged personally
dialog: by the Queen herself.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: That's a tautology lad.
dialog: (unable to stop himself
dialog: seriously explaining it)
dialog: If you say the Queen arranges
dialog: something, you've no need to say she's
dialog: done it personally. That's
dialog: understood.
text: But as far as BERTIE'S VALET is concerned, it isn't. He
text: stares down in mute fury, then snaps his fingers at one of
text: the under servants, who rushes over. There is a hurried
text: exchange of whispers before the under servant rushes out.
text: Unperturbed, BROWN brings out his flask and pours himself a
text: substantial draft of whiskey. He turns to the pretty
text: assistant dresser, sitting to his right.
speaker_heading: BROWN (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you dresser to Her Majesty?
text: She blinks nervously at him.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT DRESSER
dialog: Assistant, sir, yes.
text: BROWN tucks into his soup. Everyone watches and waits.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT DRESSER
dialog: Mary Taylor, sir.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT DRESSER
dialog: I hope to go up next year.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: You wouldn't happen to know what the
dialog: Queen's reading for recreation, would
dialog: you, Mary?
text: The assistant dresser thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT DRESSER
dialog: Lord Tennyson, sir?
text: BROWN nods. All conversation stops as the under servant
text: bursts back in. She halts at the door, looking blankly
text: from Bertie's valet to the elderly butler. A beat. The
text: old man stiffens and makes his way to the middle of the
dialog: table.
text: BROWN looks up from his soup.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Am I the only one eating?
text: With a clatter of spoons, everyone obediently eats.
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, DRAWING ROOM - DAY
text: A few days later. A morning "drawing room." Standing
text: round the unlit fireplace are DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY, LADY
text: CHURCHILL, the two LADIES IN WAITING and PRINCESS
text: ALEXANDRA. All are dressed against the icy wind that
text: whistles through the open window where VICTORIA sits
text: knitting busily while BERTIE stands beside her, coat
text: buttoned up to the collar. PONSONBY has stationed himself
text: opposite, beside a desk piled high with red dispatch boxes.
text: He runs through the daily itinerary.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
text: Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation,
dialog: at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve
text: by a picnic in the grounds to
dialog: celebrate Princess Alice's birthday.
text: Dispatches, as usual, at two.
dialog: (finishes, then coughs)
dialog: The Chancellor writes to say that, by
dialog: happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes
dialog: for the weekend. He asks if Your
dialog: Majesty might grant him an audience.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty
dialog: might wish to be informed of the
dialog: latest developments in government.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: No. I shall be out walking.
text: A beat. BERTIE watches closely now. PONSONBY coughs
text: again, nervous.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Then perhaps Your Majesty might
dialog: consider it opportune if the Prince of
dialog: Wales were to meet him on your behalf?
text: VICTORIA stiffens. She speaks without turning.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: On no account.
text: PONSONBY gives up. Politely, but firmly, BERTIE takes up
dialog: the reins.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Mama, I really do think it's time we
dialog: made ourselves a little more ...
dialog: available.
text: VICTORIA carries on knitting.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I think we must accept our position in
dialog: the country is not entirely unrelated
dialog: to the continued absence of the
dialog: Monarchy from public life.
dialog: (silence)
dialog: I thought perhaps we might consider a
dialog: small gesture of some kind?
text: VICTORIA looks up sharply.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Gesture?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I thought, a dinner for our
dialog: ambassadors perhaps?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (cutting in firmly)
dialog: No dinners, Bertie.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why are you dressed for outdoors?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: It's so infernally cold in here.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Cold is good--
dialog: (calling across)
dialog: Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: I'm sorry, ma'am?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Cold is good!
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: Excellent, ma'am, excellent.
dialog: (trying his hand)
dialog: But perhaps if her Majesty were to
dialog: consider accompanying her new-found
dialog: physical vigor with the benefits of
dialog: mental activity...
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (becoming very agitated)
dialog: Why am I being lectured in this way?!
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: Forgive me, Your Majesty. In no way
dialog: did I wish to suggest--
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (cutting across him)
dialog: I will not tolerate anybody lecturing
dialog: me about the responsibility of the
dialog: monarchy....
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Mother....
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: ... Least of all my son. It was his
dialog: irresponsibility that drove my husband
text: to his grave.
text: An appalled silence. With great dignity, BERTIE absorbs
text: the shock of the insult and quietly steers the conversation
text: in another direction.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty,
dialog: then perhaps she might consider
dialog: allowing the Prince of Wales to host--
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I do believe they send so many boxes
dialog: to taunt me.
dialog: Doctor Jenner writes to them to say
dialog: that my nerves are in an extremely
dialog: fragile state and yet they continue to
dialog: hound me with box after box after box
dialog: after box after box!
text: Silence. VICTORIA has crossed to the window and stares out
text: at the view. Having recovered her composure, she turns to
dialog: address them all.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: I wish to take the Princesses for a
dialog: swim.
text: For a moment, nobody believes what they have heard. She
dialog: continues.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: The turns I have been taking in the
dialog: grounds have proved most beneficial to
dialog: me, and Brown thinks that salt water
dialog: will do me good.
text: Bertie stares at her in silence while PONSONBY and DOCTOR
text: JENNER exchange a worried look.
scene_heading: EXT. PRIVATE BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY
text: The doors of the Royal bathing-machine swing open and Queen
text: VICTORIA, in a voluminous swim-dress, sails out like a duck
text: into the freezing sea. As she does so, the doors of the
text: other machines open and Princess Helena and Princess Louise
text: follow her in. Dignity does not allow them to shout out,
text: but their expressions of constipated agony are a picture.
text: VICTORIA begins swimming around in a vigorous little
dialog: circle.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Don't potter, children. Swim.
text: Hold for a moment on the princesses' miserable faces.
scene_heading: EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - DAY
text: Half an hour later, PONSONBY, DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY and
text: two FOOTMEN watch as BROWN helps VICTORIA up some steps and
text: onto her horse. He glances at the stiff line of
text: householders and mutters curtly to himself.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: You could buy that lot for garden
dialog: ornaments and still see change from
dialog: ten guineas.
text: The household do not hear this, but QUEEN VICTORIA has
text: overheard and tries to suppress a smile.
text: As she settles into the saddle, her foot comes loose.
text: BROWN fastens it into the stirrups.
speaker_heading: BROWN (CONT'D)
dialog: Lift your foot, woman.
text: Everyone hears this. VICTORIA obeys. Taking the reins, he
text: then walks the QUEEN out of the courtyard. As they vanish
dialog: from site, we hear...
speaker_heading: DISRAELI (O.S.)
dialog: This nation is fortunate in so much as
dialog: it is not governed by force...
text: FADE TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: CAPTION: "1866"
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY
text: The speech continues as we follow the progress of a
text: Tomahawk cartoon doing the rounds of the Tory back benches
dialog: from knee to knee. It is entitled, "Where is Britannia?"
text: and shows an empty throne draped with the Royal cloak.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI (O.S.)
dialog: ... but by a chain of traditions that
dialog: have been cherished from generation to
dialog: generation, because in them -- in our
dialog: traditions -- are embodied all the
dialog: laws which have enabled us to create
dialog: the greatest empire of modern times...
text: During the above, the cartoon reaches the front benches and
text: lands on the knees of the young, earnest STANLEY. As he
text: frowns at the picture in front of him, DISRAELI winds up.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI (CONT'D)
dialog: ... but, even though we have amassed
dialog: great capital and even though we have
dialog: established an industry with no
dialog: parallel in the world, yet all these
dialog: mighty creations are as nothing
dialog: compared to the invisible customs that
dialog: shape our lives. To those honorable
dialog: gentlemen of the opposition who seek
dialog: to destroy the essential elements of
dialog: this country, I say let them remember:
dialog: England cannot begin again.
text: During this peroration, we see DISRAELI for the first time.
text: He is handsome, obviously Jewish and wire thin, like
text: Dickens on Slimfast. He dresses almost dandyishly but
text: speaks with startling vigor; a combination of brilliance
text: and cheek that is his key. To cheers from his back
text: benchers, he sits.
text: As he looks up, he catches the eye of his opposite on the
text: Liberal benches. GLADSTONE is different in almost every
text: respect; dour, dogged, heavy-set and tall. They stare
text: levelly for a second, then DISRAELI flashes a brilliant
dialog: smile.
text: STANLEY plops the cartoon on his lap.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Have you seen this?
scene_heading: INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, LOBBY CORRIDOR - DAY
text: A few minutes later, DISRAELI and STANLEY are strolling
text: down the busy lobby corridor. Throughout their talk, Tory
text: back-benchers bustle up to pat their hero on the back and
dialog: offer their congratulations.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Should we take it seriously?
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: The cartoon or Her Majesty's
dialog: absenteeism?
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Well, both.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: The question is, do we need her?
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Surely, you're not suggesting we
dialog: dispense--
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with
dialog: only a handful of friends must respect
dialog: public opinion.
text: The pass GLADSTONE in a huddle of cohorts.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI (CONT'D)
dialog: Gossip counts. Lord Aberdeen was
dialog: right. This country is not governed
dialog: by wisdom but by talk.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Granted, it wouldn't take much to
text: winkle the old girl out of mourning,
dialog: but if public opinion is against her,
dialog: then it doesn't do to appear too
dialog: close.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: We'll see which way the wind blows.
text: DISRAELI sweeps through a prattle of back-benchers.
scene_heading: EXT. PUBLIC BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY
text: BROWN and ARCHIE crash into the water. It is freezing.
text: BROWN braces himself against the icy shallows by bellowing
text: Burns at the sea.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: My heart's in the Highlands, my heart
dialog: is not here! My heart's in the
dialog: Highlands a-chasing the deer! Chasing
dialog: the wild deer and following the roe!
dialog: My heart's in the Highlands wherever I
dialog: go!
text: ARCHIE is so creased up with laughing, he almost drowns.
scene_heading: EXT. PUBLIC BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY
text: A few minutes later, BROWN and ARCHIE hurry back up the
text: cold beach to rub themselves dry. BROWN is very energized.
speaker_heading: BROWN
text: One box of biscuits, one box of drop
dialog: tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen
dialog: chocolate sponges. It's the same
dialog: order every week, but does anybody
dialog: bother to check it? Now she has to
dialog: travel all the way to Balmoral without
text: the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: So? Someone'll send it on ahead.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Aye, but will they?
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: John, it's not your problem what she
dialog: eats.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: The woman's surrounded by fools!
dialog: (beat)
text: She has to be packed and ready to
dialog: leave by seven thirty tomorrow
dialog: morning. Knowing that lot, they'll
text: still be dressing her at eight.
text: BROWN takes a nip of whiskey and offers some to his
dialog: brother.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: She's got an army of people to get her
text: up and out.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: But I'm the only one she trusts.
text: ARCHIE stares at him. A beat.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: She'll blow hot and cold on you, John,
dialog: she always does. You want to be
dialog: careful.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I'm on ninety pounds a year plus
text: seventy pounds for a pile of tartan
dialog: I'd be wearing anyway. That's as much
dialog: as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and
dialog: that job's only for toffs.
text: (raising his hip flask
text: triumphantly at the sea)
dialog: I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant!
text: Indoors and Out. There's no stopping
dialog: me now.
scene_heading: EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - NIGHT
dialog: A few days later.
text: The clatter of carriage and horse as the ROYAL PARTY
text: thunders through gathering dark toward Balmoral Castle.
scene_heading: CAPTION: "BALMORAL"
scene_heading: EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - TWILIGHT
text: A mass of torches encircle the ROYAL PARTY as kilted
text: GHILLIES and STAFF swarm round the carriage, opening doors
text: and clambering off boxes while a regiment of PIPERS play
dialog: them in.
text: Amid this swarm of activity, we glimpse BROWN opening the
text: door to a smiling VICTORIA as she climbs down, followed by
text: PRINCESS HELENA and PRINCESS LOUISE. Emerging from another
text: carriage come BERTIE and PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, staring grim
text: faced at the castle. HENRY PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER
text: alight from their carriage as PONSONBY slips on his gloves
text: and pinches his nose at the pain of remembrance.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Oh God, not the pipes!
scene_heading: EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY
dialog: The next day.
text: High over the vast, bleak mountains of Lochnager and Loch
text: Muick. VICTORIA and BROWN are riding fast towards the top.
text: Reaching the summit, VICTORIA points excitedly at the far
dialog: horizon.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: What are those?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Those, over there, there.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: (horse chestnut trees...)
dialog: Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Craobhan-geanmchno...
dialog: (bursts out laughing)
dialog: How can I possibly say that with a
dialog: straight face?!
text: BROWN lets it go and they ride on.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: I am thinking of publishing my
dialog: "Highland Journals."
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Are they worth reading?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I am told so.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Who by?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are
dialog: charming.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: What does he know about the Highlands?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: He has been attending at Balmoral for
dialog: many years.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: That doesn't make him an expert.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: His remarks were directed at the
dialog: quality of the writing, not its
dialog: subject.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I don't groom a horse to have it
dialog: admired by others, I groom it because
dialog: it needs grooming.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (curtly)
dialog: I do not do it for others. But
dialog: Ponsonby thinks they are good.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Just say what you have to say, woman.
dialog: What other people think shouldn't
dialog: matter to you.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (snapping)
dialog: Of course I shall say what I have to
dialog: say. I always do.
text: The stare at each other until BROWN kicks his horse on.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Aye, well, if all you want is a good
dialog: opinion then he'd be sure to oblige
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (riding alongside)
dialog: What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was
dialog: their literary merit, a skill not
dialog: intimately associated with the
dialog: knowledge of grooming.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Literary appreciation does not begin
text: and end with Tennyson.
text: BROWN lowers his head.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: (in a softer tone)
dialog: I mention you in them.
text: BROWN says nothing.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: In particular, the occasion when
text: Albert was alive; the Royal Carriage
dialog: overturned during a storm and you
dialog: demonstrated such loyal service in
dialog: returning the Queen and the Princesses
dialog: safely to Balmoral.
text: Taking a sprig of heather from her brooch, VICTORIA holds
text: it out to him. A beat.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: For friendship.
scene_heading: INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY
text: A few days later, PONSONBY, DOCTOR JENNER and BROWN stand
text: at the chamber-desk, talking over the Queen's itinerary.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: (briskly)
dialog: She'll be away on Friday between eight
dialog: o'clock and six in the evening to
dialog: visit the Grants in Glasalt. If she's
dialog: to make the journey there and back in
dialog: the day she's to have no distractions
dialog: the night before. She'll take a light
text: supper alone in her private drawing
dialog: room and retire early.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: She'll need to sign dispatches before
text: she retires.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: That can wait till the weekend.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: There are important papers from --
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: It can wait. Anything else?
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: Are you sure Her Majesty is up to such
dialog: a long journey? She has only just
text: recovered from a severe head cold.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: If I thought she wasn't up to it, I
dialog: wouldn't let her go, would I?
text: BROWN snaps together his papers and walks out, leaving
text: PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER standing lamely at the table.
scene_heading: EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY
text: The next morning. The ROYAL FAMILY are picnicking in the
text: grounds. VICTORIA walks along a path accompanied on one
text: side by BROWN, on the other by BERTIE.
text: BERTIE is in mid-plea.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Surely it is for the gentlemen to
dialog: decide when to stop...
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: It is a disgusting habit, Bertie. It
dialog: should be discouraged.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Yes, but isn't midnight a little
dialog: excessive?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
text: It is quite late enough.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: But mama, the room was built expressly
dialog: for that purpose. It has been a
dialog: smoking-room by tradition ever since
dialog: father --
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (cutting in angrily)
dialog: Brown's responsibilities are onerous
dialog: enough already. He has far too much
dialog: to do without having to stay up all
dialog: night waiting for you to go to bed.
dialog: The smoking-room will be closed and
text: the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Mama...
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: And that is my last word on the
dialog: matter.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think
dialog: it's too much that the gentlemen of
dialog: the house should be dictated to by a
dialog: servant.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: It's the Queen's decision.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: (to VICTORIA)
dialog: Mama...?
text: Before Bertie can continue, BROWN steps right into his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I think you should go now.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You've tired your mother enough.
text: BERTIE stares back, too stunned to speak. He glances at
text: his mother, but VICTORIA looks off into the distance as if
text: she has not heard. BERTIE turns and storms away.
scene_heading: INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY
text: JOHN BROWN is standing in the doorway of a small cottage
text: watching, with amused detachment, as a middle-aged couple,
text: MR and MRS GRANT, race about their tiny living room, trying
dialog: desperately to make it presentable for the Queen's sudden
text: visit. They fling open the windows, slosh water on the
text: fire, tidy up their two grubby BOYS, plump up the cushions,
text: dump knitting under the sofa and try to smarten themselves
text: up, all in the space of a few seconds.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: There's really no need for this.
speaker_heading: MRS GRANT
dialog: I'll not have her seeing it like it
dialog: is!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I know she means well, but I wish
dialog: she'd warn us she was coming.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: She thinks if she warned you, you'd go
text: pouring water on the fire and stuffing
text: the knitting under the sofa.
speaker_heading: MR GRANT
dialog: Aye, well, you can't stop a wife being
dialog: house-proud.
text: MRS GRANT surveys the room critically.
speaker_heading: MRS GRANT
dialog: All right.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Show her in.
scene_heading: EXT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY
text: VICTORIA sits on a horse and trap. BROWN steps out and
text: helps her down.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: They're ready now.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I hope they didn't go to any trouble,
dialog: John.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Ah, well...
scene_heading: INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY
text: VICTORIA steps in to be greeted by all four GRANTS in one
text: military row, smoke still steaming off the fire. BROWN
text: stands behind her, barely able to contain himself. But for
text: VICTORIA, it is all she's ever known and so she takes it as
dialog: perfectly normal.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Mr Grant. How good it is to see you.
speaker_heading: MR GRANT
dialog: (bowing deeply)
dialog: Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Mrs Grant. How is your knee? Has the
dialog: pain eased a little?
speaker_heading: MRS GRANT
dialog: (bobbing in terror)
dialog: Oh not so bad, ma'am.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Good. Oh and here are Douglas and
dialog: John. Haven't you grown?
speaker_heading: MRS GRANT
dialog: (still bobbing away)
dialog: Growing all the time, ma'am.
text: MR GRANT remembers himself and gestures VICTORIA towards a
dialog: chair.
speaker_heading: MR GRANT
dialog: Will you sit, ma'am?
text: From his place by the wall, BROWN notices how easily she
text: smiles as she is led to the chair. She points to a picture
text: on the wall and her good humour is infectious.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I know that! That's Cairn Lochan. We
dialog: picnicked there once, did we not,
dialog: John?
scene_heading: INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY
text: A few days later, a party of ARISTOCRATS, MINISTERS,
scene_heading: DIPLOMATS, ESCORTS, BUSINESSMAN and WHORES. Into this
text: brouhaha come DISRAELI, his elderly wife MARY ANNE and the
text: young STANLEY. It is all eyes and nods here. Everyone
dialog: knows everyone.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: Ah, the greasy pole.
speaker_heading: MARY ANNE
dialog: Don't be facetious, dear. Remember
dialog: your position.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: It's my position I'm thinking of.
text: Across the room, STANLEY spots BERTIE amid a crowd of
dialog: acolytes.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: I see the Prince of Wales is here.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: I hope he got his mother's permission.
text: STANLEY smiles faintly. DISRAELI homes in on a punter and
text: raises his hand, already working the room.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI (CONT'D)
dialog: Lord Salisbury!
scene_heading: INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY
text: The society party is hotting up. STANLEY is deep in
text: conversation with three SOCIETY LADIES.
speaker_heading: SOCIETY LADY 1
dialog: (ridiculously pleased with
dialog: herself)
dialog: Why is the Queen penny-wise and pound
dialog: foolish? Because she looks after the
text: Browns and lets the sovereigns take
dialog: care of themselves!
text: A peal of naughty laughter. Unseen, DISRAELI steps up.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: And in your opinion? Is she foolish?
text: The SOCIETY LADY stares blankly back.
speaker_heading: SOCIETY LADY 1
dialog: Well I ... well, I mean to say, it's
dialog: hardly right, is it?
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SOCIETY LADY 1
dialog: Well, the Queen and --
dialog: (appalled whisper)
dialog: Mr Brown.
text: DISRAELI stares at her steadily, already thinking ahead.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: La superstition met le monde entier en
dialog: flammes.
speaker_heading: SOCIETY LADY 2
dialog: (thick as shit)
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: (changing tack)
dialog: Has anybody seen this ... Mr Brown?
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: He is her personal servant, I believe.
speaker_heading: SOCIETY LADY 1
dialog: (knowingly)
text: Follows her wherever she goes.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: He would hardly make a very good
dialog: personal assistant if he did not.
scene_heading: INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY
text: BROWN stands by a wall, smiling to himself at the sight of
text: QUEEN VICTORIA struggling to help lay the table while MRS
text: GRANT nervously prattles on.
speaker_heading: MRS GRANT
dialog: ... it's not my best china. I mean,
dialog: it is my best china now, but the
dialog: family set got stolen last summer.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Oh, I'm so sorry ...
speaker_heading: MRS GRANT
dialog: Of course it was no-one on the Estate.
dialog: More likely one of the lads from
dialog: Braemar. Or further even.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'll fetch the salt.
text: MRS GRANT scurries away. VICTORIA immediately holds up the
text: spoons to BROWN with a questioning look -- above or beside
text: the plate? He nods her to the top and she quickly carries
dialog: on.
scene_heading: INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY
text: DISRAELI and MARY ANNE stand with BERTIE and his ACOLYTES.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Mr Disraeli. Ma'am.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: Your Royal Highness. What a pleasure
dialog: to see you here.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Have you met Mr Lyle? He's in
dialog: sugar...?
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: I don't think I've had that pleasure.
text: DISRAELI shakes hands with the fat sugar tycoon who wobbles
text: with drink. MARY ANNE engages him in conversation while
text: BERTIE turns DISRAELI aside.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: No doubt you've heard the rumors.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: I take no account of gossip, Your
dialog: Highness.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: My concern is for the reputation of
dialog: the Monarchy.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I fear the influence he has on her.
text: The man's word is not to be credited.
dialog: He is an arriviste of the very lowest
dialog: water.
dialog: (beat)
text: She's having a bust cast of him. In
dialog: Nero Marquino marble.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I would talk to her myself, but she
dialog: won't listen to me. She must be
dialog: persuaded, by someone she respects, to
dialog: abandon this ridiculous favoritism
text: before a situation develops.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: A situation?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I don't imagine you frequent the
dialog: Republican Clubs. But the fact that
dialog: neither you nor I are members should
dialog: not blind us to the significance of
dialog: their existence.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The Tory Party has always been our
dialog: party.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: I'm flattered you think so.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I tell you, if we don't stick together
dialog: on this, you could find yourself First
dialog: President's Opposition.
dialog: (murdering it)
dialog: Du Royaum Uni.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: Quite.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I don't think we can overstate the
dialog: seriousness of this.
text: DISRAELI nods and BERTIE walks swiftly back to his party.
text: The moment he's gone, STANLEY steps up to DISRAELI's side.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: What did he want?
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: To know when he'll be king.
scene_heading: INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY
text: VICTORIA, BROWN and the GRANTS are eating around a large
text: table. Like a wife watching her husband, VICTORIA beams
text: proudly at BROWN as he tells a story.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: ... so Grant here and myself are
text: riding over Lochnagar and the rain's
dialog: pouring down in sheets and all we're
dialog: thinking about is getting home for a
dialog: drink, when through the gloom Grant
text: spots a couple of poachers. He gives
text: me a shout and we chase them down
dialog: towards the loch until Grant has your
text: men up against the stacks and he's
dialog: shouting and cursing at them, "Why are
dialog: you poaching on Royal land?!" And one
text: of the little fellas looks up at him
dialog: and says, "coz we've come up in the
dialog: world."
text: For a split second, both the GRANTS look petrified, then
text: BROWN and VICTORIA explode into laughter and the GRANTS
text: relax. Suddenly the GRANTS are helpless with laughter too.
text: Beginning with VICTORIA's glass, BROWN pours out liberal
text: quantities of whiskey all round.
scene_heading: EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DUSK
text: Later that night, the courtyard is packed with a gaggle of
text: worried HOUSEHOLDERS holding lamps.
text: Through the light, BROWN and VICTORIA clatter into the
text: courtyard on the horse and trap. DOCTOR JENNER breaks
text: through the crowd in a state of high excitement.
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: Your Majesty! Thank goodness you're
dialog: safe! I'll have a bath prepared
dialog: immediately. I recommend Macdonald's
dialog: African Embrocation --
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: (cutting in)
dialog: Ah, pipe down, man. The woman's fine.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: We stayed a little longer than
dialog: expected with Mr and Mrs Grant. It
dialog: was most agreeable.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: We were expecting you to return by
dialog: six.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: And now I am back.
text: BROWN cannot resist one more little dig.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: We took a nip of whiskey.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: To keep out the cold.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Aye.
text: VICTORIA smiles and BROWN lifts her off the trap. Before
text: walking in she turns and, in front of everyone, says...
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Thank you, John.
text: BROWN bows and the QUEEN walks on. As she straightens up,
text: he finds PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER staring back at him in
text: utter disbelief at what she has just said. He turns and
text: leads the horse back to the stables.
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: (under his breath)
text: She's drunk.
text: PONSONBY doesn't answer. He is watching BROWN very
dialog: closely.
speaker_heading: JENNER (CONT'D)
text: A distinct flushing around the cheeks.
dialog: She was drunk, I tell you.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: No, she wasn't.
text: Silence. JENNER turns to look at PONSONBY.
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: Surely not ...
text: PONSONBY's face is set hard.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Don't even think about it.
scene_heading: INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BALLROOM - NIGHT
text: A crush of kilted GHILLIES as we slam into the height of
dialog: the annual Ghillie's Ball.
text: The whole court is reeling through the dance; all of them
text: beholding the extraordinary spectacle of QUEEN VICTORIA and
text: JOHN BROWN dancing together in the middle of the hall.
text: PONSONBY and JENNER stand by the wall, watching. Close-up
text: on PONSONBY'S face as JENNER mutters darkly.
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: Pandora's Box ...
text: With a slam of feet the reel ends, the GHILLIES roar and
text: BROWN and VICTORIA stand smiling at each other in silence.
dialog: A King and his Queen.
scene_heading: INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BALLROOM - NIGHT
dialog: Later that night.
text: We find BROWN, slouched on the ground, dead-drunk and
text: snoring loudly.
scene_heading: EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY
text: A few days later, four JOURNALISTS are scrabbling up a
text: stony path, armed with telescopes.
scene_heading: EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY
text: A large ROYAL PARTY is making its way smoothly and quietly
text: up the mountain. BROWN is on horseback, leading VICTORIA
text: on a dapple-grey.
scene_heading: EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY
text: The JOURNALISTS rattle up the hill.
scene_heading: EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY
text: BROWN and VICTORIA start pulling ahead of the main party.
scene_heading: EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY
text: The JOURNALISTS scramble up to some gorse bushes, dump
text: themselves down and start setting up the telescopes.
scene_heading: EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY
text: BROWN and VICTORIA near the summit when BROWN suddenly
text: stops. He stiffens and turns to face the wind, as if
text: catching a scent. VICTORIA frowns.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: What is it, John?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: John?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I heard something.
text: BROWN's eyes fix on some distant gorse bushes.
speaker_heading: BROWN (CONT'D)
dialog: I won't be long.
text: He dismounts and races off.
scene_heading: EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY
text: The JOURNALISTS are peering through their telescopes.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST 1
dialog: Where did he get to? I've lost him?
text: Below them, BROWN races across the riverbank and
text: undergrowth, unseen.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST 2
dialog: I don't know if there's much worth
dialog: writing about.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST 1
dialog: Hard to tell.
text: BROWN rears up above them and stops.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: This close enough for you? Go on! On
dialog: your way! You filthy scavengers!
text: The JOURNALISTS scramble to their feet and start legging it
text: down the hill, while BROWN roars furiously, hurling their
text: bags after them.
speaker_heading: BROWN (CONT'D)
dialog: You leave her alone, do you hear?!
text: The JOURNALISTS vanish below the hillside.
scene_heading: INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT
dialog: That night.
text: BROWN is standing at the head of the table, yelling at the
text: UPPER SERVANTS, irrespective of ARCHIE or anyone.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: If I catch the miserable by-blow who
dialog: told those men where she'd be, then
dialog: I'll hang his balls to dry on Jock
dialog: Wemyss, so I will!!
text: ARCHIE glances up at BERTIE'S VALET. He is staring down at
text: the table, teeth gritted, fists clenched. BROWN rounds on
dialog: them all again.
speaker_heading: BROWN (CONT'D)
dialog: What happens to John Brown is his
dialog: business, but the Queen's security
dialog: will never be compromised!
speaker_heading: BERTIE'S VALET
dialog: We --
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: You'll talk when I'm finished!
text: BERTIE'S VALET stares at him in astonishment. BROWN turns
text: back to the table.
speaker_heading: BROWN (CONT'D)
dialog: That kind of disloyalty will not be
dialog: tolerated in this house, is that
dialog: clear?
dialog: (beat, yelling)
dialog: I said, is that clear?!
text: There is a general mutter of assent. BROWN turns and
text: storms out as ARCHIE gets up to follow.
scene_heading: INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, HENRY PONSONBY'S ROOMS - DAY
text: A few days later, PONSONBY is sitting at his desk, hands to
text: his hips, listening quietly as DOCTOR JENNER reads from his
dialog: copy of Punch.
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: "Court Circular, Balmoral."
dialog: (beat)
dialog: "On Tuesday, Mr John Brown enjoyed a
text: display of sheep-dipping by local
dialog: farmers. On Wednesday, he attended a
dialog: seance where he was pleased to listen
dialog: to a recital of Auld Lang Syne by Mr
dialog: Robert Burns himself ..."
scene_heading: INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, LOWER CORRIDOR - DAY
text: BROWN crashes through a door holding a copy of the same
dialog: journal.
speaker_heading: JENNER (O.S.)
dialog: "... On Thursday, Mr John Brown walked
text: on the slopes, accompanied by family
dialog: and friend ..."
scene_heading: INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY
text: BROWN storms up to PONSONBY's door.
speaker_heading: JENNER (O.S.)
dialog: Mr Brown retired early.
scene_heading: INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, HENRY PONSONBY'S ROOMS - DAY
text: BROWN bursts in on PONSONBY and JENNER, slamming down his
text: copy of Punch on the desk. He is furious but controlled.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: If I find out that you had anything to
dialog: do with this, I will have you sacked.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: I believe that decision rests with Her
dialog: Majesty.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Don't think I can't persuade her.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: I don't doubt that the Queen was
text: highly amused. She has always had a
dialog: very healthy sense of humor.
speaker_heading: BROWN
text: This is a slur on her good name.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: In as much as the article is about
dialog: yourself, I think you must now accept
dialog: that the public has a right to its
dialog: interest in you.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Nobody has any rights over me.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: We are all of us subject to forces
dialog: beyond our control, Mr Brown, even
dialog: you.
text: BROWN stares at him in silence. A beat.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: You'll regret saying that.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: CAPTION: "1867"
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY
text: Chaos. The Tories are losing the vote as both sides of the
text: house stand and shout at each other while the SPEAKER rises
text: in his chair.
speaker_heading: SPEAKER (O.S.)
dialog: Order! Order! ORDER!
text: A buzzing silence settles as the house sits for the vote.
text: The COUNTERS approach the chair.
speaker_heading: SPEAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: Result of the vote to the first
dialog: reading of the Bill to Disestablish
dialog: the Irish Church.
text: A murmur of excitement from the LIBERALS.
speaker_heading: SPEAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: Order!
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: COUNTER
dialog: Ayes to the right, three hundred and
text: thirty, noes to the left, two hundred
dialog: and sixty-five...
text: By the time he reaches "sixty-five" his voice is drowned in
text: cheers from the Liberal benches. DISRAELI and the rest of
text: the front bench sit in stony silence.
text: Somewhere on the Liberal back benches, a wild-eyed
text: maverick, DILKE, rises to his feet shouting:
speaker_heading: DILKE
dialog: Mr Speaker, I table a motion in
dialog: furtherance of the Bill to
dialog: Disestablish the Monarchy!
text: A roar from the irate TORIES and chaos reigns again.
speaker_heading: SPEAKER
dialog: Order! Order!! ORDER!!!
scene_heading: INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, LOBBY CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: An hour later the house is empty except for a few
text: straggling MPs hurrying home. An exhausted DISRAELI stands
text: in the corridor with STANLEY.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: We're going to lose.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: You can't know that for sure.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: Gladstone's got his party facing the
text: same way for the first time in years.
dialog: We need help.
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: Where is the old girl?
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: Mrs Brown.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: It's questionable whether there's any
dialog: advantage to be had from that
dialog: direction. She's never been less
dialog: popular.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: In the press, perhaps.
dialog: (holding up Punch)
dialog: But she's sold more copies of her
dialog: Highland Journal in three months than
dialog: Punch will ever sell in a year. Time
dialog: to wheel her out.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
text: She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: What's her excuse this time?
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: The Princess Louisa is too ill to
dialog: move. Frankly, the Queen's rather
text: upset at the recent spate of bad
dialog: publicity.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're smiling.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: I was trying to imagine "rather
dialog: upset."
text: The elderly prelate, DEAN WELLSELLY, hurries in through the
text: lobby doors. DISRAELI puts on a welcoming smile.
speaker_heading: DEAN WELLSELLY
dialog: Forgive me, gentlemen. I'm late.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: Not at all, Dean. Good of you to
dialog: spare the time.
speaker_heading: DEAN WELLSELLY
dialog: I came as quickly as I could.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: You've seen the latest cartoon in
dialog: Punch, I take it?
speaker_heading: DEAN WELLSELLY
dialog: (completely lost)
dialog: I beg your pardon?
text: DISRAELI opens the copy of Punch and hands it to Dean
text: Wellselly. The Dean clears his throat and starts to read.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: (as Wellselly reads)
dialog: One of our madder brethren in the
dialog: house was calling for disestablishment
dialog: of the monarchy.
text: Dean Wellselly looks up from the article, horrified.
speaker_heading: DEAN WELLSELLY
dialog: Good Lord.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: (playing the soft glove)
dialog: I'm sure it won't come to that.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: (the hard glove)
dialog: No. But it has now become a matter
dialog: for our consciences.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I was just telling Stanley how vital
dialog: it is that the nation should feel the
text: visible influence of the Sovereign.
dialog: As a reminder that Parliament, indeed
dialog: my own ministry, depends on the will
dialog: of the Queen.
text: DEAN WELLSELLY nods his head gravely. Over his shoulder,
text: STANLEY is gaping at DISRAELI's silky distortion of the
text: party political maneuver into a moral imperative.
speaker_heading: DEAN WELLSELLY
dialog: I couldn't agree with you more, but I
dialog: am only Dean of Windsor. I don't
dialog: understand what ...
text: DISRAELI interrupts.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: We hear from Balmoral that Mr Brown is
dialog: interesting Her Majesty in some of the
dialog: forms of worship associated with ...
dialog: low-church Presbyterian.
text: Silence. DEAN WELLSELLY'S face is a picture of
text: unrestrained horror. Low-church. Presbyterian.
speaker_heading: DEAN WELLSELLY
dialog: What can we do?
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: Oh, several things.
scene_heading: INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY
dialog: Some days later.
text: Queen VICTORIA sits at her desk while Henry PONSONBY stands
text: in front of her, holding a copy of The Times.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Read it.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Again?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Read it!
text: PONSONBY coughs once and begins again.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: "The Times wishes to join the rest of
dialog: Her Majesty's loyal subjects in
text: expressing its deep joy at the news
dialog: that the Queen is soon to come out of
dialog: her mourning."
text: VICTORIA glowers at him.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Who told them that?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: I have no idea.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser
dialog: than yourself.
text: Suddenly, VICTORIA's temper goes and she shouts at him.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: No-one should think themselves wiser
dialog: than me!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It is not for any of the Queen's
dialog: subjects to presume to tell Her
dialog: Majesty when and where She should come
text: out of mourning. It is the Queen's
dialog: sorrow that keeps her secluded! It is
dialog: Her overwhelming amount of work and
dialog: responsibility, work which She feels
dialog: will soon wear her out entirely!
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Your Majesty --
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (cutting right through him)
dialog: Is it not enough that She is uncheered
dialog: and unguided that she should also have
dialog: to suffer these malicious rumors?!
dialog: (a pause, more quietly)
dialog: I am not a fool.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I know there are those in the
dialog: establishment too afraid to attack me
dialog: and so they attack my dearest friends.
dialog: Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all
dialog: I have left of Albert.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And now they attack Brown too.
text: She looks up, eyes blazing.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: I will not give him up to them.
scene_heading: INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, ROOM ADJOINING DRAWING ROOM - DAY
text: BROWN is guarding the door to the drawing room while the
text: balding BERTIE muscles up, eye ball to eye ball.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I wish to see my mother.
speaker_heading: BROWN
text: She's busy.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Convey her a message.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: She's away to Windsor tomorrow. Talk
text: to her there.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to
dialog: speak with her urgently about matters
dialog: concerning the press.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Are you deaf as well as stupid?
text: A split-second. BERTIE gapes at him.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I said, are you deaf as well as
dialog: stupid?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Do you know who you address, sir?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Whom you address.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: The future King!
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Well, everyone's entitled to their
dialog: opinion.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Out of my way!
text: Foolishly, BERTIE tries to barge his way past. Suddenly
text: BROWN loses it completely. He grabs the Prince of Wales by
text: the shoulders and pins him back, shouting right into his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: LEAVE US ALONE, WHY DON'T YOU!!
text: For a split-second, BROWN's eyes flicker as he senses he
text: has gone too far. A look of pure venom in BERTIE'S face,
dialog: then ...
scene_heading: EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUADRANGLE - NIGHT
text: Weeks later.
text: In a roar of hooves and wheels, the Royal Carriage sweeps
text: into the huge quadrangle. JOHN BROWN stands rigid on the
text: box, glowering at all the world.
scene_heading: CAPTION: "WINDSOR"
scene_heading: INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, SERVANT'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: A pair of doors open out onto a torchlit driveway as a mass
text: of SERVANTS rush in and out, ferrying bags an trunks.
text: BROWN marches in, still charged-up from the strain of the
text: journey's watchfulness. He spots an UNDER-PORTER snatching
text: a break.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: You! What's your business here?!
speaker_heading: UNDER-PORTER
dialog: (jumping to)
dialog: Under-porter, sir.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Well, don't stand where you shouldn't!
text: The UNDER-PORTER scrambles up the stairs. A few SERVANTS
text: exchange looks. BROWN seems more determined than ever to
text: exert his control.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, STABLES - NIGHT
dialog: That night.
text: Carrying an old storm lamp high over his head, BROWN walks
text: towards the stables.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - DAY
dialog: The next day.
text: BROWN is on horseback, riding with VICTORIA through the
text: grounds. He is still jumpy, eyes flicking left and right,
text: searching for intruders. They are being followed at a
text: distance by two EQUERRIES on horseback. VICTORIA frowns
dialog: peevishly.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Must they always follow us?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I ordered it. It's for your own
dialog: safety.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch
dialog: what I eat next.
text: BROWN doesn't react. A beat.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Am I not safe enough with you, John?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Aye.
dialog: (looking away)
dialog: But there are Fenians reported on the
dialog: mainland.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (tutting irritably)
dialog: The threat from the Irish is greatly
dialog: exaggerated, I'm sure.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: (snapping back)
dialog: I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
text: BROWN chucks his horse on, bringing a firm halt to the
text: conversation. A beat. He pulls up suddenly, staring at
text: the shadows in the copse.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Is anything the matter, John?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: John?
text: He stares for along moment and then lets it go.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Nothing's the matter.
scene_heading: INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, STABLES - NIGHT
text: BROWN marches down the line of horse boxes. A stable-lad,
text: BARNEY, is feeding the horses. He looks twitchy.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Hey, Barney.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Mr Brown, sir --
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: It's cold out there tonight, Barney.
text: Reaching his pony, BROWN stops and smiles. The animal
text: lifts its face to him and he softly strokes his muzzle.
speaker_heading: BROWN (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, there's a good girl.
dialog: (to Barney)
dialog: Have you had a look at this hoof? She
dialog: was limping badly. I think there
dialog: might be a stone in it.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Yeah, yeah, I did.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Good man. And is she all right?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Good. She's a good girl. Aren't you?
dialog: Yeah, she's a lovely girl. And you
dialog: know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Are you all right, Barney?
text: BARNEY twitches again and BROWN realizes too late. The
text: split-second he turns, he sees THREE MEN.
speaker_heading: BROWN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, aye...
text: The MEN pile onto him and he collapses under their weight.
text: As he falls, BROWN manages to yank himself round, bang up a
text: fist and fling the others off him. But the FIRST MAN is up
text: again, twisting an arm round his neck and tugging him back.
text: The others grapple his arms down, but BROWN is incredibly
text: strong. Even now, grunting and scrabbling, he makes them
text: fight to force him back. BARNEY stands transfixed in
dialog: horror.
text: Dumping BROWN against the wall, the men step back and start
text: kicking the shit out of him. BROWN curls into a ball, jaw
text: locked, hands over his head. Not a sound.
text: Finally, they back off, panting hard. The FIRST MAN pulls
text: out a bottle of whiskey, yanks back BROWN's head and forces
text: whiskey down his throat. It spills over his face and
text: dribbles down his neck.
scene_heading: INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY
dialog: The next day.
text: VICTORIA is standing at the windows. The door opens and
text: LADY ELY walks in.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: LADY ELY
dialog: Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: LADY ELY
dialog: I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Unwell?
speaker_heading: LADY ELY
dialog: I understand he was in a fight.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Has he been hurt?
speaker_heading: LADY ELY
dialog: I believe not, ma'am. I understand --
dialog: he'd had rather too much to drink.
text: VICTORIA walks away and steps behind her desk.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: You may go.
text: LADY ELY bows and walks out. VICTORIA stares at the desk a
text: moment, then picks up her pen and tries to work. She
dialog: cannot.
scene_heading: INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - DAY
text: BROWN sits on the edge of the bed in only his
text: undergarments. His face, arms, legs and fingers are livid
text: with bruises, but he sits there, stiff-backed and gritting
text: his teeth, while ARCHIE crouches in front of him, tending
text: to his wounds.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: And she sent no word down?
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: They said you were drunk.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why don't you tell her the truth?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: She'll think it's her fault for
dialog: keeping me.
text: ARCHIE completes one of the dressings when BROWN suddenly
text: reaches back and starts trying to put on his shirt.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I'm getting dressed.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: You've got three broken ribs, man!
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I've got my duties to attend to.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Don't be an idiot! You're in no fit
dialog: state to go anywhere.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: She'll be worried about me.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: She'll get over it.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I can't let her down now, Archie.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: And when was the last time she put
dialog: herself out for you? Look, John,
dialog: whatever she says to you now, in the
dialog: end you're still a servant.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Oh, I'm much more than that.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Aye, she may say that to you, but the
dialog: woman can say what she wants.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: You watch your tongue.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Come on, man, I'm telling you what you
dialog: already know.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: You know nothing about her!
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: When are you gonna see it, John? She
dialog: doesn't give a damn about you.
text: BROWN lunges for the bedside drawer and pulls out a card
text: showing a coy picture of a pretty woman. He holds it up,
text: eyes blazing.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: From the Queen!
text: He reads out the inscription.
speaker_heading: BROWN (CONT'D)
dialog: My lips may give a message better of
dialog: Christmas love than e'en this letter.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: To my best friend, J.B. from his best
dialog: friend, V.R.
text: (he thrusts it in his
dialog: brother's face)
dialog: Best friend!
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Aye.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: She means it.
text: ARCHIE stares at him.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: She'll drop you. When she's done with
dialog: you, she'll drop you.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Get out.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Out!
text: ARCHIE steps back but BROWN roars at him.
speaker_heading: BROWN (CONT'D)
dialog: OUT!!
text: ARCHIE steps outside and BROWN is left alone.
scene_heading: INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY
text: The next day. VICTORIA sits at her desk. PONSONBY hands
text: her letters to sign.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: ... to be followed by a visit from
text: Lady Bridport. She is keen to secure
dialog: a place for her niece as Maid of
dialog: Honor.
text: VICTORIA signs the last letter and sits back.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I am tired.
text: PONSONBY coughs.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: There is one other matter.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: I have a letter, ma'am.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: From whom?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: From Princess Helena and other members
dialog: of your family.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (stiffening defensively)
dialog: My family is quite capable of
dialog: communicating with the Queen in
dialog: person.
text: PONSONBY does not reply. Finally, VICTORIA is obliged to
dialog: ask.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: What do they want?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: They are demanding the dismissal of
text: John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
text: VICTORIA stares through the window, expressionless.
scene_heading: INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CHAPEL - DAY
text: VICTORIA walks through the ornate chapel, nervously
text: fingering her handkerchief. Waiting for her, smiling
text: softly, is the Dean of Windsor, DEAN WELLSELLY.
speaker_heading: DEAN WELLSELLY
dialog: You wished to see me, ma'am?
text: She holds his eyes for a moment, then nods.
scene_heading: INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CHAPEL - DAY
text: A few minutes later, VICTORIA and DEAN WELLSELLY are seated
text: in a corner of the chapel, talking softly. She cannot
text: bring herself to look at him and so does not notice how
text: carefully he is watching her throughout the interview.
text: This is incredibly hard for her to say, but she struggles
dialog: to be as honest as possible.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: My husband tried always to make me
dialog: think more subtly. Of course he
dialog: taught me so much and I can never
dialog: repay my debt to him, or the love I
dialog: feel, even now. But, in truth, I
dialog: think I am someone who can only feel
dialog: things while they are alive to me.
dialog: For that reason, I know I do not have
dialog: a subtle mind. I know that. But I
dialog: work hard and I try to do my duty.
dialog: (she hesitates; she is
dialog: struggling now)
dialog: However, I have noticed of late that
dialog: my feelings of grief are not so strong
dialog: and -- that I find myself leaning more
text: upon the comfort of living friends.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Friends close to me now.
text: She stops herself. She is crying. DEAN WELLSELLY watches
text: her a moment, then speaks close, choosing his words
dialog: carefully.
speaker_heading: DEAN WELLSELLY
dialog: Your Majesty, a settled resignation is
dialog: more lasting proof of affection than
dialog: active grief. If the good Lord sees
dialog: fit to bring one into contact with
dialog: congenial fellow beings, one should
dialog: not analyze one's reaction too deeply.
dialog: To allow oneself to be comforted by
dialog: someone else need not imply any
dialog: disloyalty to the memory of the loved
dialog: one.
text: Silence. VICTORIA stares into the long, dark chapel.
text: Gradually, as she takes in the tone of his remarks, her
text: disappointment turns to anger.
scene_heading: INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY
text: The next day, VICTORIA stands at the far window and her
text: back to the room. Lined up against the wall are BERTIE and
dialog: his siblings.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Sir Henry.
text: PONSONBY steps forward.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Ma'am?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Please tell the Princess, and other
dialog: signatories to this letter, that the
dialog: Queen will not be dictated to, or made
dialog: to alter, in any way, what she has
dialog: found to answer for her comfort.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do I make myself clear?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Ma'am.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: You may go.
text: They all file out.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - DAY
dialog: A few days later.
text: BROWN and VICTORIA are riding on horseback. Although
text: better than he was, BROWN'S face is still badly bruised.
text: They turn a corner banked by trees. BROWN is watching the
text: QUEEN closely. She stops.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I would like to get down.
text: Without a word, BROWN dismounts and helps her off her
dialog: horse.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: John?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Yes, ma'am?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I was told you were in a fight.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Has someone seen to those bruises?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: BROWN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ma'am?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Having considered my position here at
dialog: court, I have come to the conclusion
dialog: that it is in the best interest of
dialog: Your Majesty that I should resign.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I do not accept.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I had foreseen that you would not.
dialog: But Your Majesty should understand --
dialog: that my mind will not be changed in
dialog: this. I leave for Deeside --
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (cutting in)
dialog: The Queen forbids it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I cannot allow it because I cannot
dialog: live without you. Without you, I
dialog: cannot find the strength to be who I
dialog: must be. Please.
text: She takes his hand to her mouth and kisses it gently, then
text: looks at him, utterly helpless.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Promise me you won't let them send me
dialog: back.
text: A long silence. BROWN holds her hand tight.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I promise.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: CAPTION: "1868"
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. LOWLANDS - DAY
dialog: A few weeks later.
text: A tiny horse-drawn carriage creeps across a huge Highland
dialog: landscape.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI (V.O.)
dialog: Yesterday, Gladstone talked for three
dialog: hours on the Irish Church Bill ... I
dialog: am as guilty as the rest of
text: underestimating his reforming zeal.
dialog: Tory days may be numbered, but I fancy
dialog: there yet remains one last hope of
dialog: deliverance. Wheresoever the blame
dialog: lies, we must now close ranks and
dialog: defend Mrs Brown's England. As for my
dialog: interminable journey to the land of
dialog: Calvin, oatcakes and sulphur ...
scene_heading: EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY
text: DISRAELI hurries through the pouring rain.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI (O.S.)
dialog: ... no Prime Minister made greater
dialog: sacrifice than attempting to run the
dialog: country six hundred miles north of
dialog: civilization.
text: Reaching the castle, he hurries inside and the great doors
text: bang behind him.
scene_heading: INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY
dialog: The next day.
text: QUEEN VICTORIA is playing the piano like she walks, with
text: great vim and vigor. The tune is some quaint Scottish
text: ballad which she belts out in her clear strong voice,
text: almost drowning out PRINCE ARTHUR, PRINCE LOUISE and PRINCE
text: LEOPOLD who are meant to be accompanying her. They stand
text: in a nervous semi-circle, fumbling their harmonies.
text: Ignoring them completely, VICTORIA bobs up her head with a
text: quizzical smile to make sure she is being appreciated.
text: DISRAELI and the rest of the HOUSEHOLD stand a few yards
text: off, smiling rigidly. DISRAELI, the consummate politician
text: to his inch-high insteps, out-smiles the lot of them. This
text: man is in raptures of delight. And the more liquid his
text: smiles, the happier he makes VICTORIA. He beams, she
text: belts, until her children are drowned out completely.
text: And then, with characteristic suddenness, VICTORIA stops
text: playing and launches into one of her tirades. The
text: HOUSEHOLD wobbles in shock like children on a switch-back,
text: but DISRAELI glides smoothly from delight to sober concern.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: How dare the Irish break with the
dialog: Anglicans?
dialog: If Albert were alive today he would
dialog: never allow the Crown to give up
dialog: Church patronage. No, the Irish must
dialog: be told, very firmly, to stay exactly
text: where they are. It is the thin edge
dialog: of the wedge, Mr Disraeli. Next, you
dialog: will be telling me that the Crown no
dialog: longer governs this nation.
text: A beat. A nervous silence in the Household.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: Your Majesty remains at the very
dialog: epicenter of governance. As for your
dialog: people, look no further than the sales
dialog: of your Highland Journals to see in
dialog: what affection the nation holds their
dialog: Queen.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You sell even more copies than Mr
dialog: Dickens.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
text: VICTORIA gives him a tiny smile. DISRAELI acknowledges it,
text: then steers the conversation back.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: Of course I understand your concern.
dialog: You miss your people.
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: And they miss you.
text: VICTORIA registers a slight flicker of defensiveness at the
dialog: implied criticism.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Then they may read about me.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: Indeed, and for that they are
text: eternally grateful.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Is that not enough?
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: In so many ways ... and yet it is your
text: presence they crave. A figurehead.
text: VICTORIA has the measure of him.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I never thought to be bullied by you,
dialog: Mr Disraeli. You, I thought,
text: understood a widow's grief.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for
dialog: the nation, only for myself. As Prime
dialog: Minister I confess I miss your
dialog: presence, but that is only an
dialog: expression of my own selfish desires
dialog: and I should not burden you with it.
text: The Household waits. Has he clawed himself back? VICTORIA
text: acknowledges his apology. Her voice drops and she talks
text: directly to DISRAELI, straight from the heart.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I stay here because I am happy.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Is that such a terrible crime?
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: No, ma'am.
text: At this moment the far door opens and BROWN walks in.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Time for your walk.
text: Without a word, VICTORIA rises from her chair and starts
text: following him out. As they pass DISRAELI, she stops.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: This is my good John Brown.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: (taking him in)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I have asked him to show you a little
dialog: of Highland life while you are with us
dialog: at Balmoral.
text: BROWN measures DISRAELI suspiciously.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: What brings you here?
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: A man can refuse only so many
dialog: invitations from his Queen. It was
dialog: remiss of me not to come earlier.
text: VICTORIA smiles. BROWN stares.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: What do you know about the Highlands?
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: I am a blank sheet.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Do you hunt?
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: Occasionally.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Dare say you can be taught.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: If you hunt, you kill.
text: DISRAELI counters effortlessly.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: Well then, I'll do my best.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY
text: Staying close to the ground we develop through a series of
text: shots showing the other highlands -- sheet rain against
text: heather and gorse, rivulets of water slashing through mud,
text: crude pathways sliding in wind and all ball-breakingly
dialog: cold.
text: Coming up the hill, we begin to make out a hunting party.
text: The sound first. Like a small army, crashing their way up
text: the winding path. GHILLIES urging on their horses and
text: dogs, guns and equipment jangling off pony-hacks an then
text: the tall figure of JOHN BROWN striding out in front.
text: Making no concession to anyone, he force-marches them up
text: the hill, eyes on the hunt ahead. Behind them trot the men
text: on horseback -- DISRAELI, PONSONBY, BERTIE and other
text: GENTLEMEN, each led by GHILLIES and ATTENDANTS, among them
speaker_heading: ARCHIE.
text: Suddenly, BROWN stops and raises a hand. The party halts.
text: He listens for a second. Satisfied that he has found his
text: quarry, he brings his hand down and the party of gentlemen
text: dismount as quietly as they can.
text: As he waits, BROWN winces slightly from the pain in his
text: side. He pulls a flask of whiskey from his sporran and
text: drinks. All the time, DISRAELI keeps his eyes on BROWN.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY
dialog: The stalking.
text: Everyone is now fanned out along the hillside, a ghillie to
text: each gentleman, slowly and silently moving up the hill.
text: DISRAELI stalks with BROWN, panting hard to keep up, eyes
text: on his man, trying to make no sound.
text: Suddenly, BROWN stops. Very slowly he rises. DISRAELI
text: rides alongside and sees ...
text: A huge stag staring majestically across the hillside.
text: Keeping his movements smooth and slow, BROWN brings up his
text: rifle, cocks it and offers DISRAELI the kill. With a
text: deferential gesture of the hands, DISRAELI declines. BROWN
text: stares at him a split-second, raises the rifle to his
text: shoulder and fires.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY
dialog: The kill.
text: A rapid montage of guns firing, as we cut to ...
scene_heading: INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY
text: BROWN sweeps in from the hunt, DISRAELI dripping at his
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: (demonstrating with his
dialog: rifle)
dialog: Always remember, you keep it tight to
dialog: your shoulder, you absorb the kick.
dialog: Aim for the head. Then imagine it's
dialog: Gladstone.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Quite.
text: BROWN pulls out his flask and offers some to DISRAELI, who
text: declines. He watches BROWN take a long swig.
scene_heading: INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT
dialog: That night.
text: BROWN is standing at his place, drinking steadily. He has
text: a sheet of paper and a pen and is ticking off a list.
text: Lined up in front of him, trying desperately not to laugh,
text: are five or six UPPER SERVANTS including the pretty
text: ASSISTANT DRESSER and BERTIE'S VALET. They each step up,
text: one at a time, to make their report.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: (ticking as he goes)
text: ... Back doors, West Wing.
speaker_heading: UPPER SERVANT 1
dialog: Checked and locked, sir.
speaker_heading: BROWN
text: Side doors, East Wing.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT DRESSER
dialog: Checked and locked, sir.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Louder, girl!
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT DRESSER
dialog: (creasing up)
dialog: Checked and locked, sir.
speaker_heading: BROWN
text: Kitchen and lower house.
speaker_heading: BERTIE'S VALET
dialog: Checked and locked, sir.
speaker_heading: BROWN
text: Back and upper corridors.
speaker_heading: UPPER SERVANT 2
dialog: Checked and locked, sir.
speaker_heading: BROWN
text: Front door.
dialog: (beat)
text: Checked and locked.
text: Folding up the paper, BROWN downs his glass of whiskey and
text: sits. On his nod, dinner is served by UNDER SERVANTS amid
text: a clatter of cutlery and chat.
text: ARCHIE looks across at his brother but BROWN is hunched
text: over his plate, pecking at his food.
text: Someone titters and ARCHIE looks up. BERTIE'S VALET
text: coughs. BROWN slowly lifts his head. His eyes have the
text: slightly unfocused look of too much drink. It is clear to
text: ARCHIE that he is about to be sent-up.
speaker_heading: BERTIE'S VALET
dialog: (with a smug smile)
dialog: Did you see any Irish assassins today,
dialog: Mr Brown?
text: Brown doesn't react.
speaker_heading: BERTIE'S VALET (CONT'D)
dialog: We heard the dogs were Fenian
text: sympathizers.
text: Brown drinks.
speaker_heading: BERTIE'S VALET (CONT'D)
dialog: Or was it the stag ...?
text: Everyone bursts out laughing. Brown slams down his glass.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: There's not a soul here cares about
dialog: that wee woman's safety except me!
dialog: She'd die in a ditch if I wasn't there
dialog: to look out for her --
text: He stops. ARCHIE has come across to his brother's chair
text: and pulls gently on his arm.
text: BROWN stares at the SERVANTS. Everyone is about to burst
text: out laughing. Keeping his dignity, he pushes back his
text: chair and lets ARCHIE lead him away.
text: As BROWN reaches the double doors, the laughter hits him in
text: the back like a wave. ARCHIE holds him steady.
scene_heading: INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
text: BROWN is lying on a grubby bed. ARCHIE is looking around
text: the untidy room. For the first time, he notices a thick
text: manuscript on the table. BROWN follows his eyes.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: It's a diary.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Be careful who sees it.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: What do you take me for?
text: ARCHIE turns back to BROWN.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: You should have someone look after
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I'm all right. I just need to rest up
dialog: a wee bit.
dialog: (feeling everything spin)
dialog: The room ... You don't have to stay.
text: BROWN shuts his eyes and starts to drift. ARCHIE watches
text: over him.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
text: The place is a mess.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I can't move to tidy.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: It's what the maids are for.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I'm not having some prattler going
dialog: through my things.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Won't you give yourself a rest, John?
dialog: She's other people to look out for
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: She needs me, Archie. She canna do
dialog: without me, she said it to my face.
text: (his hands come up to cover
dialog: his eyes)
dialog: How can I stop now?
scene_heading: INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, SERVANT'S CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Dawn the next morning.
text: BROWN is scrambling into his jacket as he hurries down the
dialog: stairs.
scene_heading: EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY
text: BROWN crashes out of a side-door -- just fully dressed --
text: to be met by the smiling figure of DISRAELI. He is got up
text: in smart walking boots, plus-fours and a tweed jacket.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: You sent for me.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: I've been called back to London. My
dialog: last day. I thought I might take a
dialog: walk on Lochnagar.
text: BROWN stares straight back.
scene_heading: EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY
text: An hour later, BROWN leads DISRAELI up the hill. BROWN has
text: his head down, on with the job. DISRAELI slows to a halt.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: Princes and Lords are but the breath
dialog: of kings, An honest man's the noblest
dialog: work of God.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You must miss such magnificent views.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I don't think about it.
text: They reach the top and continue along the high ground.
text: DISRAELI glances at BROWN and notices the limp.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: Forgive me, I've called you out and
dialog: you should have been resting.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: You're injured.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: It's nothing.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: Still, someone must attend you. Your
dialog: wife should not have let you out.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I'm not married.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: This is the top.
text: DISRAELI admires the view for a moment, then continues.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: I confess, I sometimes feel as if I am
dialog: not married myself, I see my wife so
dialog: little. But I'm forgetting the
dialog: rewards.
text: He looks across. BROWN keeps staring ahead.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI (CONT'D)
text: The look on their faces when one walks
text: into the room. Still gives one a
dialog: ridiculous thrill.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I wouldn't know.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: Surely --
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: What I do, I do for my Queen.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: Was there never ambition?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Maybe, once.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: Then I envy yo.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: To have achieved one's ambition, or to
dialog: have reconciled oneself to its limits,
dialog: is a lifetime's work.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I do what I do.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: For Her Majesty.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Aye.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: But yourself?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What about John Brown?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I said.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I serve the Queen.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: No other aspiration?
text: BROWN stares for a long moment. Finally he speaks.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: To see her safe.
text: DISRAELI steps a little closer.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: You will not be unaware of the threat
text: now posed by Republicanism.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Why do you think I keep her here?
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: Ah, but therein lies the paradox. It
dialog: is her very isolation that encourages
text: the malcontents. The longer she is
dialog: away, the stronger they become; and
dialog: who, honestly, can promise security
dialog: against that? However many doors you
dialog: lock, someone will always get in.
dialog: Even here.
text: BROWN watches him, eyes alert.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: So...?
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: The truth is, the Queen would be safer
dialog: doing her duty and returning south to
dialog: her public. John Bull loves her and
dialog: John Bull is her best defense.
speaker_heading: BROWN
text: Her mind is set. She won't change
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: She trusts you, John.
text: DISRAELI is right on his shoulder now, like his own voice.
speaker_heading: BROWN
text: They don't see it.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: See what?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: The threat.
dialog: (beat)
text: I tell them, but they don't see it.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: They aren't as watchful as you.
speaker_heading: BROWN
text: Too busy looking after themselves.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
text: The greasy pole.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: No loyalty.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: No love.
text: Silence. For a moment BROWN seems unaware that someone
dialog: else has said that.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I promised to protect her from people
dialog: like you.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: For once in my life, I am not the
dialog: issue.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: She'll never understand it.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: In time, she will.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: She'll think I betrayed her.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: But others will know that you acted
dialog: for the greater good.
text: BROWN stares off into the distance.
scene_heading: EXT. LOCH MUICK - DAY
dialog: The next day.
text: BROWN is rowing VICTORIA across the loch. The EQUERRIES
dialog: wait on the shore.
text: VICTORIA trails her hand in the water, frowning at the
text: surface. BROWN concentrates on the oars, slipping them
text: carefully through the water.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I received a letter today from Mr
dialog: Disraeli. Parliament is calling for
dialog: my return to public duties.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why won't they let us be?
text: BROWN does not answer.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: He insists that the country expects me
dialog: to preside over the opening of the new
dialog: session. I refuse to offer sustenance
text: to enable his weakening grip.
dialog: Besides, you know how much I should
dialog: hate it. It frightens me.
text: She notices that BROWN has said nothing.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: John?
text: BROWN does not look at her. Finally:
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: We can't always have what we wish.
text: VICTORIA stares at him.
scene_heading: INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY
dialog: Later that day.
text: VICTORIA and BROWN are in the middle of a blazing row in
text: front of the entire Household, including PONSONBY, JENNER
text: and LADY ELY.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Duty?! You talk about duty?!
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: If duty and safety are served by the
dialog: same end then, aye, I do.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I cannot believe you are saying this?
dialog: You, who I have relied on all this
dialog: time --
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: (cutting in)
dialog: Have I ever let you down before--?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (as if he had not spoken)
dialog: -- You stand there and tell me it is
dialog: my duty ... after all you promised me!
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I'm breaking no promises!
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: You are forcing me to do the very
dialog: thing you know I fear most!
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying
dialog: to keep you safe!
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I will not hear any more about my
dialog: safety!! You made me a promise and
dialog: now you have broken it!
text: BROWN rounds on her, deeply wounded.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: -- When I took you out riding, come
dialog: rain or shine, because I knew it was
dialog: right for you, when I kept the bairns
dialog: off your back so you could have a bit
dialog: of peace, when I saw you safe from
dialog: home to home and you didn't even know
dialog: I was there...! All I've ever thought
dialog: about is you!
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Then why send me back to them?!
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Because I have to!
dialog: (pause
dialog: Will you no listen to me, woman?
text: Face turned from him, VICTORIA replies in a brittle voice.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Do not presume to talk to your Queen
dialog: in that manner.
text: A long silence. BROWN watches her, but she will not look
text: at him again. Finally, she walks very slowly across the
text: room. She turns in the doorway, her voice faltering
dialog: slightly.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Doctor Jenner, I feel unwell. I shall
dialog: retire to my chamber. Please attend
dialog: me presently.
text: As the door slams, we ...
text: FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: CAPTION: "NOVEMBER"
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, DINING ROOM - DAY
dialog: A few weeks later.
text: Close on a door as it opens. The ROYAL FAMILY are eating
text: lunch with members of the UPPER HOUSEHOLD. VICTORIA walks
text: in with LADY ELY.
text: A great scraping of chairs as everyone drops their forks
text: and stands. Clearly, they were not expecting her. In
text: silence, VICTORIA steps up and takes her place at the head
dialog: of the table.
text: At last, PONSONBY leans forward deferentially.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: May I say, how glad I am to see Your
dialog: Majesty so much recovered.
text: VICTORIA nods, then turns and looks about at the others.
text: PRINCESS ALEXANDRA is seated at the far end of the table.
text: VICTORIA frowns.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Where is my son?
speaker_heading: PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
dialog: Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Why is he not here?
speaker_heading: PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
dialog: He is sick, ma'am.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Then why are you not with him?
speaker_heading: PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
dialog: You ordered all members of the Royal
dialog: Family to attend you at Balmoral.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: What is the matter with him?
speaker_heading: PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
dialog: He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
text: VICTORIA stares blankly at DOCTOR JENNER.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: No. You are mistaken. Prince Albert,
dialog: my husband, had typhoid fever. I
dialog: asked what was wrong with my son.
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: The same, your Majesty.
text: VICTORIA stops. She stares down the length of the table.
text: A long pause.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Why was I not informed?
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: I did not consider it wise, in the
dialog: circumstances, to tax your nerves.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: How ill is he?
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Alexandra)
dialog: Alex?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: He is not well, ma'am.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: I must go to him.
text: Suddenly, VICTORIA stands. Chairs bang back as everyone
text: leaps to their feet.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: We must leave at once.
text: Abruptly, VICTORIA turns for the door and the room erupts
dialog: into activity.
scene_heading: INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY
text: BROWN stands in the corridor, a little nonplussed by the
text: servants and Householders hurrying about in every
dialog: direction.
scene_heading: EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY
text: Half an hour later, BROWN races up to the Queen's carriage
text: amid a swarm of servants, ladies' maids and Householders
dialog: rushing to be ready in time.
text: Suddenly the huge castle doors open and VICTORIA bustles
text: out with her entourage in tow. BROWN -- only just in time
text: - yanks open the door for VICTORIA to step past him and
text: take her place. She ignores him completely.
text: BROWN slams the doors. As he looks up, he sees his brother
text: ARCHIE staring at him from across the courtyard. For a
text: second the two brothers hold each other's gaze. It's
text: obvious that ARCHIE has noticed the Queen's indifference.
text: BROWN turns away and mounts the box as the carriage races
text: away under him.
scene_heading: INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, PRINCE'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY
text: Some days later. A tableau.
text: QUEEN VICTORIA sits at the foot of the bed, a matriarch
text: surrounded by her ROYAL FAMILY. They watch DOCTOR JENNER
text: bend to examine the ghostly figure of BERTIE. He listens
text: for a pulse. Finally, he looks up.
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: Better.
text: VICTORIA lets out a deep breath. She takes hold of
text: PRINCESS ALEXANDRA'S hand.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Should the good Lord see fit to spare
dialog: my son, I will order a mass to be
dialog: celebrated at St. George's. The
dialog: people must share with their Queen,
dialog: her prayers and hopes for their future
dialog: King.
scene_heading: INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BEDCHAMBER - DAY
text: A few minutes later, BROWN stands in the corridor when the
text: door bursts open and VICTORIA marches straight past him
text: with PONSONBY at her side.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
speaker_heading: (aside to BROWN)
dialog: The Queen will be riding to St.
text: George's on the fifth.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: (launching straight in)
dialog: I recommend Her Majesty uses the
text: covered carriage with a full Horse
dialog: Guard. In the event of any
dialog: disturbance I will ensure --
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (cutting in)
dialog: I will ride to St. George's in an open
dialog: carriage. It is time the Queen was
text: seen by her public.
text: VICTORIA turns and disappears down the corridor, followed
text: by PONSONBY. We linger on BROWN'S humiliation, closer and
dialog: closer until ...
scene_heading: EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, ST. GEORGE'S - DAY
dialog: Some weeks later.
text: A series of angles on BROWN as he walks amid the mass of
text: onlookers pressing against a cordon of guards surrounding
text: the cathedral. All the time, his eyes flick left and
text: right, searching the faces in front of him for potential
text: assassins. Over his intense watchfulness we hear ...
speaker_heading: DEAN WELLSELLY (O.S.)
dialog: ... praise and magnify thy glorious
dialog: name for that thou has raised thy
dialog: servant Albert Edward, Prince of Wales
dialog: from the bed of sickness.
dialog: We pray thee to perfect the recovery
dialog: of thy servant and to crown him day by
dialog: day with more abundant blessings both
dialog: for body and soul, through Jesus
dialog: Christ our Lord ...
text: The CONGREGATION mutters a vast ...
speaker_heading: CONGREGATION (O.S.)
dialog: Amen.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, ST. GEORGE'S - DAY
text: VICTORIA and other members of the ROYAL FAMILY walk down
text: the steps towards the cheering crowd. As DEAN WELLSELLY
text: and BROWN follow, BROWN sees ARTHUR O'CONNER break from the
text: onlookers, pulling out a gun. BROWN yells out:
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: NO!!
text: He races toward O'CONNER and hits him flying, bangs him to
text: the ground and twists the gun out of his hand. As they
dialog: fall we hear laughter and:
speaker_heading: BERTIE (O.S.)
dialog: So there he is, Arthur O'Conner...
scene_heading: INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, DINING HALL - NIGHT
text: It's a few days later and BERTIE is entertaining a private
text: dinner party. They include QUEEN VICTORIA, PRINCESS
text: ALEXANDRA, PRINCESS LOUISE and HENRY PONSONBY. BROWN is in
text: attendance. He stands off to one side, near the door.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (bristling with confidence)
dialog: ... all seven stone of the man,
text: paddling madly towards us through a
text: sea of Horse Guards, waving something
dialog: that looks vaguely like a pen. I
dialog: thought he must be one of the mother's
dialog: ardent readership in search of the
dialog: Royal indenture...
text: More chortling. VICTORIA watches her son, smiling proudly.
text: BROWN looks straight ahead.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I believe I saw him first and then
dialog: alerted Brown. I'm not convinced that
text: he wasn't taking a snooze on top of
dialog: the box. Anyway, we had our man
dialog: pinned down and I must say, Brown
dialog: acquitted himself admirably. Of
dialog: course the gun was a fake, but all the
dialog: same, it was well done.
text: No-one registers BROWN. But while VICTORIA does not look
text: at him, she is acutely aware of his presence.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I intend Brown to be rewarded with a
dialog: special medal cast in gold. It will
dialog: be called The Devoted Service Medal.
text: The guests applaud politely. BERTIE clinks his glass for
text: attention and raises it high.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: A toast. Victoria Regina!
text: The others raise their glasses in unison.
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Victoria Regina!
text: VICTORIA smiles. BROWN remains alone by the door.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI (O.S.)
dialog: The people of England have expressed
dialog: in a manner which cannot be mistaken,
dialog: that they will uphold the ancient
dialog: monarchy of England ...
scene_heading: INT. CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY
text: DISRAELI is delivering his come-back speech at a banquet of
dialog: Tory delegates.
speaker_heading: DISRAELI
dialog: ... If the first great object of the
dialog: Tory Party is to maintain the
dialog: institutions of the country, the
dialog: second is, in my opinion, to maintain
dialog: the Empire of England ... the
dialog: hereditary, the traditionary policy of
dialog: the Tory Party. Go to your homes,
dialog: teach them these truths, which will
text: soon be imprinted on the conscience of
dialog: the land ...
text: FADE TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: CAPTION: "1883"
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
text: The sound of rain driven hard against a window. We creep
text: slowly down the corridor until we are back with the fifty
text: year-old BROWN. With his whiskey for company, he is
text: sitting at his desk, writing in the diary.
text: The diary-manuscript is now falling apart with wear, but
text: there remain a few blank pages. Slowly, he fills them in.
speaker_heading: BROWN (V.O.)
dialog: We should not live in expectation of
dialog: contentment. Fifteen years of
dialog: vigilance will not guarantee peace of
dialog: mind. Yesterday, intruders were again
dialog: reported in the South Wing. I believe
dialog: my prompt arrival may have averted any
dialog: crisis, but it was a timely reminder.
dialog: It is a great comfort to me that my
dialog: efforts in securing the Queen's safety
dialog: over the years have not been in vain.
dialog: Certainly Her Majesty sends me no word
dialog: that she's dissatisfied. And I feel
dialog: sure that if she were unhappy she
dialog: would have found the occasion to
dialog: speak to me in person, as she has so
dialog: often done in the past.
text: A knock at the door.
speaker_heading: BROWN (CONT'D)
dialog: What is it?
text: We hear a young PAGE, breathless from running.
speaker_heading: PAGE
dialog: North woods, sir.
text: BROWN grabs his gun and rushes out.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUADRANGLE - NIGHT
text: BROWN appears at the door and strides into the storm. He
text: walks quickly across the wide quadrangle, rain soaking his
text: hair and clothes.
text: Two GUARDS watch BROWN as he races out into the storm.
text: A coin flips through the air to be caught by an
text: outstretched hand. The second GUARD grins.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - NIGHT
text: BROWN races across the open ground towards the forest.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT
text: And now we are back with the opening sequence. Truncated,
text: severe, and shot from a slightly different angle. The
text: driving rain, BROWN hurtling through the trees, the crack
text: to his left, he spins and plunges on.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT
text: Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree, heaving for
text: air. He searches the dark, stops, listens and races on.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT
text: BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's
dialog: length.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT
text: He bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and stops.
text: Pistol raised, he turns a circle, eyes on the wildly
text: swaying trees. A branch snaps behind him. He spins round,
text: bellows deep from his heart:
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: God save the Queen!!
dialog: And fires.
scene_heading: INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR - NIGHT
dialog: A few days later.
text: VICTORIA is moving swiftly down a long corridor with LADY
text: ELY. They arrive at a door. VICTORIA stands facing it.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: How long has he been this sick?
speaker_heading: LADY ELY
dialog: A few days, ma'am.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Why was I not told earlier?
text: LADY ELY doesn't answer. VICTORIA knows anyway. She nods.
text: LADY ELY knocks. The door is opened by a young UNDER
text: SERVANT who gawps at the sight of Her Majesty standing here
text: in the servant's quarters. VICTORIA walks in.
scene_heading: INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
text: The room has been cleared of bottles, but the thinness of
text: the life here shocks her deeply. The cheap furniture, the
text: anonymous prints, the bed and, finally, the sight of BROWN.
text: He is lying in bed, barely conscious. After a moment, he
text: opens his eyes and stares at her. She steps forward,
text: smiling nervously.
text: Her voice is the old voice, between friends.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: You should never have gone out in such
dialog: foul weather.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Someone has to look after you.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It could've been someone. It was
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Yes. Yes it was.
text: He cannot speak. It's difficult for her too, but she
text: speaks for him.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: My Ministers are as impertinent as
dialog: ever. Dispatches are now so numerous,
dialog: they come in a trunk. Sometimes I do
dialog: believe they will never stop. Endless
dialog: letters...
dialog: 
text: Her voice falters. A pause
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (CONT'D)
dialog: I know I have not always been the
dialog: loyal friend you deserved, John. And
dialog: yet here I am now, even now, feeling
dialog: desperate at the thought of losing
dialog: you.
text: She starts to cry.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Don't be silly, woman.
text: His old, familiar gruffness makes her smile and she pulls
text: herself together. Seeing a bowl of water on the side
text: table, she steps across. Carefully folding a cloth in
text: four, she rinses it in the water and gently wipes his face.
text: Leaning closer, she is about to touch his face when BROWN
text: gestures protectively.
speaker_heading: BROWN (CONT'D)
text: Not too near.
scene_heading: INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY
text: A week later. PONSONBY and JENNER stand at the window
text: overlooking the grounds.
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: Erysipelas.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Not too protracted, I hope.
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: A few days...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: When he heard, the Prince of Wales
text: threw the bust from the window of the
dialog: Royal Gallery. It took four hours to
dialog: gather the fragments.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: The Queen wishes to publish an account
dialog: of him.
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: Dear oh dear.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: We think she can be dissuaded.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Have you had a glance at the diary?
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Quite.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I think I'd best take it back.
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: Of course.
text: He brings out BROWN'S tatty diary-manuscript and hands it
text: over to PONSONBY. The two men move away from the window,
text: to go their separate ways. Daily business beckons.
speaker_heading: JENNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Where did you find it by the way?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
text: Some young page was boasting about
dialog: having seen it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Lucky.
text: JENNER nods.
speaker_heading: JENNER
dialog: Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: No, indeed.
text: The two men head off in opposite directions down the
dialog: corridor.
dialog:
