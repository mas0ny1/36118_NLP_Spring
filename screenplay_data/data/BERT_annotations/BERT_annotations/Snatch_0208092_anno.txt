speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: The Septuagint scholars mistranslated

dialog: because they thought they looked the
dialog: same, coming up with the prophecy
dialog: "behold a virgin shall conceive and

dialog: unfortunate consequence of taking Vinny with it. Poor Vin

text: to say this leaves Sol in a bit of a bewildered state. He's
text: looking the wrong way at the critical moment and is left

text: glass door, but it doesn't budge. With panic rising swiftly,
text: Sol doesn't fuck around he takes aim with the handgun and
text: fires, the bullet shatters the glass but it doesn't break
text: through, and the bullet now ricochets off both glass doors
text: shattering bullet-proof glass all around them. Vinny's panic
text: filled eyes attempt to follow its trajectory. Sol is unaware
text: of the ricochet and before Vin has time to warn him, Sol
text: fires another bullet. Now he observes the problem and waits
text: for the inevitable. The bullet tears through the bag of
text: coins, which then empties its contents at Vin's and Sol's
text: feet. Eventually the bullet hits poor Vince in the thigh.

speaker_heading: THE REFF
dialog: Alright lads no eye gouging no biting.
dialog: Do your worst. Back to your corners.
text: We drift again into Micky's pov, his world is becoming more
text: and more surreal. He can faintly hear Turkish whispering
text: words to him, but he's not really listening. A bell comes
text: from somewhere, and Micky instinctively walks to the center
text: of the ring. "Good night" is already there, they pace one
text: another for a second or two, Micky avoids a punch or two and
text: then he takes a hard one and he knows it, we flash to white,
text: Micky's in trouble: he lets one of his missiles go and BANG
text: it shakes "good night" to his core, all goes quiet. We go
text: to super slow motion: his knees buckle and "good night" is
text: in trouble. Micky maintains a frown as he watches his
text: opponent's knees threaten to betray him. The crowd tries to
text: digest what is happening. After a period of silence reality
text: dawns. Brick Top mouths the words in silence."Don1t go down
dialog: you fucker". The crowd wants Micky to finish the job. But
dialog: common sense reins back the coup de grace. "Good night"
text: eventually regains control of his legs and stumbles forward,
text: after a few sleepy punches he starts to provide a serious
text: onslaught.
speaker_heading: TURKISH
dialog: I don't like the look of this Tommy,
text: bring the van up to the back door.
text: This goes on for two rounds (which is montage down to a few
text: seconds). We go in the mind of poor Micky. We break the
text: music just as it's starting to look dangerous... The bell
text: goes and Micky walks to the wrong corner. Turkish pulls him
text: back to his corner.
speaker_heading: TURKISH (CONT'D)
dialog: They are on ya. You got to hurt him
dialog: Micky. Otherwise we are
dialog: rumbled.... you hear me Micky? Do

text: Micky goes out again his hands are low, BANG there is a flash
text: of white as Micky goes down in the dirt. Dust rises from
text: where he fell. He gets up quickly, his hands are still low,
text: BANG he goes down again, in no time he's up.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: 120 CONTINUED: -
text: BANG: he hits the ground again and this time when he hits
text: the deck, he penetrates the dust covered floor, like i t ' s
text: made out of water. He falls through the water like he's
text: sinking; his eyes are open and he can't breathe, he continues
text: to fall, but he's unpanicked (he is now Micky 1). When Micky
text: 1 looks up he can see himself in the corner of the ring takin
text: kidney punches from Good Night, he's winded and only semi-
text: conscious (this is Micky 2). Micky 1 makes the effort to
text: swim up and tries to penetrate the floor but he's stuck he
text: can't get through. Micky 2 takes more punishment in the
text: ring, as Micky 1 ' s hand continues to try to break the
text: underside of the floor but it stretches like rubber and forces
text: Micky 1 down again. Micky 1 looks up again and sees how
text: much trouble Micky 2 ' s in the ring. Micky 1 is panicking
text: now, he's running out of oxygen and Micky 2's being beaten,
text: Micky 1 starts -to sink again but now flames tickle the bottom
text: of his feet he looks up. and sees Micky 2 being smashed to
text: hell, his body eventually collapses and Micky 2 falls through
text: the floor. And as the latter falls through, Micky 1 manages
text: to rise from the depths and his punch manages to perforate
text: the surface. The punch continues its trajectory and has the
text: power to fell a red blooded rhino.... it catches "Good Night"
dialog: on the jaw and it's good night for "Good Night" it's unlikely
dialog: that he'll awake in the next hour. Dear oh dear everybody

text: he is about to get in, he's eyes widen to the size of saucers
text: as FOUR MEN (who we recognize from the wake) are sitting in
text: the place of his driver. They both have sawed-off shotguns
text: and empty four barrels into the chest of Brick Top and Ken.

speaker_heading: VINNY
dialog: It was over there.
text: He points to a pile of chewed up cushions.
speaker_heading: HANDS
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: VINNY
dialog: We left it in a box over there...
dialog: somewhere.
text: He walks over and finds the remains of the box.
speaker_heading: VINNY (CONT'D)
dialog: I t ' s empty.
speaker_heading: HANDS
dialog: Tony.
speaker_heading: BTT

speaker_heading: BTT
dialog: I t ' s not a fuckin tin of baked beans,
dialog: what do you mean open him up?
speaker_heading: HANDS
dialog: I mean open him up.
text: Hands does a movement that represents a knife across the
dialog: throat.
speaker_heading: BTT
dialog: That's a bit strong isn't it?
speaker_heading: HANDS
dialog: You wouldn't have a problem if it
dialog: was a person.
speaker_heading: BTT
dialog: But it's not, it's a dog and I have
dialog: never done a dog.
speaker_heading: HANDS
dialog: My heart bleeds.
dialog: There is another pause
speaker_heading: ,BTT
dialog: What dp I do?
speaker_heading: HANDS
dialog: Let me take a wild and reckless guess.
dialog: Stick a knife in his guts and see if
dialog: it's got a diamond in there? I'll
dialog: hold it still and'you open it up.

dialog: blade to Hands.
speaker_heading: BTT
dialog: I t ' s squeaking.
speaker_heading: HANDS
dialog: What, you've never heard a dog squeak
dialog: before?... Hold him still.
text: The dog isn't sure about this either. Vin is in a panic and
dialog: suddenly.
speaker_heading: VINNY
dialog: Stop! I can see it. I can see the
dialog: stone.
text: Hands at the point of entry stops. Vinny hops over to the
text: stone and picks it up. Tony lets the dog stand but keeps a
text: grip oh the collar. The dog is relieved to be semi-liberated.
text: Hands is still on his knees armed with an incredulous stare.
speaker_heading: HANDS
dialog: Well let's see it.
text: Vinny holds it up. There's a sense of relief. He then throws
text: the stone, it cuts through the air. And the dog seeing
text: .another projectile runs to intercept it. There's a pause
text: while all now focus again on the dog. This is digested
text: literally and mentally. The dog recognizes all the attention
text: it's receiving. And goes through the motions of swallowing
text: it. Hands attempts an approach. The dog understandably
text: feels uncomfortable about the advancing vanguard and decides
text: emergency action is needed, and seeing the open window
text: launches itself out of it.
