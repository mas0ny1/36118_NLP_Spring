speaker_heading: CASABLANCA
dialog: Released: 1942
dialog: Studio: Warner Bros.
dialog: Running Time: 102 minutes
dialog: Director: Michael Curtiz
dialog: Producers: Hal B. Wallis,
dialog: Jack L. Warner
dialog: Screenplay: Julius J. Epstein
dialog: Philip G. Epstein
dialog: Howard Koch
text: Based on the play EVERYBODY GOES TO RICK'S
dialog: by Murray Burnett, Joan Alison
dialog: When production began the script was only half completed,
dialog: near the end of production the script was literally being
text: written the night before, and in the final days of filming,
text: the dialogue for some scenes was written while shooting was
text: actually in progress and then rushed to the set. Dialogue
text: for the final seconds of the film was even added well after
dialog: production had been completed.
dialog: It is therefore accurate to say that no complete production
text: script for Casablanca exists. The script that follows is
text: therefore a synthesis of extant versions of the shooting
text: script, the continuity script, and a close analysis of the
dialog: finished film.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: INSERT - A revolving globe. When it stops revolving it turns
text: briefly into a contour map of Europe, then into a flat map.
text: Superimposed over this map are scenes of refugees fleeing from
dialog: all sections of Europe by foot, wagon, auto, and boat, and all
text: converging upon one point on the tip of Africa -- Casablanca.
text: Arrows on the map illustrate the routes taken as the voice of a
text: NARRATOR describes the migration.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: With the coming of the Second World
dialog: War, many eyes in imprisoned Europe
dialog: turned hopefully, or desperately,
dialog: toward the freedom of the Americas.
dialog: Lisbon became the great embarkation
dialog: point. But not everybody could get
text: to Lisbon directly, and so, a tortuous,
text: roundabout refugee trail sprang up.
dialog: Paris to Marseilles, across the
dialog: Mediterranean to Oran, then by train,
dialog: or auto, or foot, across the rim of
dialog: Africa to Casablanca in French Morocco.
dialog: Here, the fortunate ones, through money,
dialog: or influence, or luck, might obtain
text: exit visas and scurry to Lisbon, and
dialog: from Lisbon to the New World. But
text: the others wait in Casablanca -- and
dialog: wait -- and wait -- and wait.
text: The narrator's voice fade away...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OLD MOORISH SECTION OF THE CITY - DAY
text: At first only the turrets and rooftops are visible against
text: a torrid sky.
text: The facades of the Moorish buildings give way to a narrow,
text: twisting street crowded with the polyglot life of a native
text: quarter. The intense desert sun holds the scene in a torpid
text: tranquility. Activity is unhurried and sounds are muted.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
text: A POLICE OFFICER takes a piece of paper from the typewriter,
text: turns to a microphone, and reads.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: To all officers! Two German
text: couriers carrying important official
dialog: documents murdered on train from
dialog: Oran. Murderer and possible
text: accomplices headed for Casablanca.
dialog: Round up all suspicious characters
dialog: and search them for stolen
dialog: documents. Important!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. A STREET IN THE OLD MOORISH SECTION - DAY
text: An officer BLOWS his whistle several times.
text: There is pandemonium as native guards begin to round up
dialog: people.
text: A police car, full of officers, with SIREN BLARING, screams
text: through the street and stops in the market.
text: Some try to escape but are caught by the police and loaded
text: into a police wagon.
text: At a street corner TWO POLICEMEN stop a white CIVILIAN and
dialog: question him.
speaker_heading: FIRST POLICEMAN
dialog: May we see your papers?
speaker_heading: CIVILIAN
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: I don't think I have them on me.
speaker_heading: FIRST POLICEMAN
dialog: In that case, we'll have to ask you
dialog: to come along.
text: The civilian pats his pockets.
speaker_heading: CIVILIAN
dialog: Wait. It's just possible that I...
dialog: Yes, here they are.
text: He brings out his papers. The second policeman examines
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: SECOND POLICEMAN
dialog: These papers expired three weeks ago.
dialog: You'll have to come along.
text: Suddenly the civilian breaks away and starts to run wildly
text: down the street.
text: The policeman SHOUTS "Halt", but the civilian keeps going.
text: JAN and ANNINA BRANDEL, a very young and attractive refugee
text: couple from Bulgaria, watch as the civilian passes. They've
dialog: been thrust by circumstances from a simple country life into
text: an unfamiliar and hectic world.
text: A shot RINGS out, and the man falls to the ground. Above
text: him, painted on the wall, is a large poster of Marshal
dialog: Petain, which reads: "Je tiens mes promesses, meme celles
dialog: des autres."
text: The policeman frantically searches the body, but only
dialog: finds Free French literature.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PALAIS DE JUSTICE - DAY
text: We see an inscription carved in a marble block along the
text: roofline of the building: "Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite"
text: We see the the facade, French in architecture, then the high-
text: vaulted entrance which is inscribed "Palais de Justice".
text: At the entrance the arrested suspects are led in by the
dialog: police.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY
text: A middle-aged ENGLISH COUPLE sit at a table just off the
text: square, and observe the commotion across the way in front of
dialog: the Palais de Justice.
text: The police van pulls up. The rear doors are opened and
text: people stream out.
text: A EUROPEAN man, sitting at a table nearby, watches the
text: English couple more closely than the scene on the street.
speaker_heading: ENGLISHWOMAN
dialog: What on earth's going on there?
speaker_heading: ENGLISHMAN
dialog: I don't know, my dear.
text: The European walks over to the couple.
speaker_heading: EUROPEAN
dialog: Pardon, pardon, Monsieur, pardon
dialog: Madame, have you not heard?
speaker_heading: ENGLISHMAN
dialog: We hear very little, and we understand
dialog: even less.
speaker_heading: EUROPEAN
text: Two German couriers were found
dialog: murdered in the desert... the
text: unoccupied desert. This is the
dialog: customary roundup of refugees,
dialog: liberals, and uh, of course, a
dialog: beautiful young girl for Monsieur
text: Renault, the Prefect of Police.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PALAIS DE JUSTICE - DAY
text: Suspects are herded out of the van, and into the Palais
dialog: de Justice.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY
speaker_heading: EUROPEAN
dialog: Unfortunately, along with these
dialog: unhappy refugees the scum of Europe
text: has gravitated to Casablanca. Some
dialog: of them have been waiting years for
dialog: a visa.
text: He puts his left arm compassionately around the Englishman,
text: and reaches behind the man with his right hand.
speaker_heading: EUROPEAN
dialog: I beg of you, Monsieur, watch yourself.
dialog: Be on guard. This place is full of
text: vultures, vultures everywhere,
dialog: everywhere.
text: The Englishman seems to be taken aback by this sudden display
dialog: of concern.
speaker_heading: ENGLISHMAN
dialog: Ha, ha, thank you, thank you very
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: EUROPEAN
dialog: Not at all. Au revoir, Monsieur.
dialog: Au revoir, Madame.
text: He leaves. The Englishman, still a trifle disconcerted by
text: the European's action, watches him as he leaves.
speaker_heading: ENGLISHMAN
dialog: Au revoir. Amusing little fellow.
dialog: Waiter!
text: As he pats both his breast and pants pockets he realizes
text: there is something missing.
speaker_heading: ENGLISHMAN
dialog: Oh. How silly of me.
speaker_heading: ENGLISHWOMAN
dialog: What, dear?
speaker_heading: ENGLISHMAN
dialog: I've left my wallet in the hotel.
speaker_heading: ENGLISHWOMAN
dialog: Oh.
text: Suddenly the Englishman looks off in the direction of the
text: departed European, the clouds of suspicion gathering.
text: Interrupting overhead is the DRONE of a low flying airplane.
text: They look up.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OVERHEAD SHOT - DAY
text: An airplane cuts its motor for landing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PALAIS DE JUSTICE - DAY
text: Refugees wait in line outside the Palais de Justice. Their
text: upturned gaze follows the flight of the plane. In their
text: faces is revealed one hope they all have in common, and the
dialog: plane is the symbol of that hope.
text: Jan and Annina look up at the plane.
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: (wistfully)
dialog: Perhaps tomorrow we'll be on
dialog: that plane.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OVERHEAD SHOT - DAY
text: The plane SWOOPS down past a sign atop a building at the
text: edge of the airport.
text: The sign reads "Rick's Cafe Americain."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY
text: As the plane lands a swastika on its tail is clearly
text: visible. It taxis to a stop as a group of officers march
text: into formation in front of it. Behind them stand a detail
text: of native soldiers keeping guard.
text: In the group is CAPTAIN LOUIS RENAULT, a French officer
dialog: appointed by Vichy as Prefect of Police in Casablanca. He
text: is a handsome, middle-aged Frenchman, debonair and gay, but
text: withal a shrewd and alert official.
text: With him are HERR HEINZE, the German consul, CAPTAIN TONELLI,
text: an Italian officer, and LIEUTENANT CASSELLE, Renault's aide.
text: When the plane door opens, the first passenger to step out
text: is a tall, middle-aged, pale German with a smile that seems
text: more the result of a frozen face muscle than a cheerful
dialog: disposition. On any occasion when MAJOR STRASSER is crossed,
text: his expression hardens into iron.
text: Herr Heinze steps up to him with upraised arm.
speaker_heading: HEINZE
dialog: Heil Hitler.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Heil Hitler.
text: They shake hands.
speaker_heading: HEINZE
dialog: It is very good to see you again,
text: Major Strasser.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Thank you. Thank you.
text: Heinze introduces Strasser to Renault.
speaker_heading: HEINZE
dialog: May I present Captain Renault,
dialog: Police Prefect of Casablanca.
text: Major Strasser.
text: Renault salutes.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Unoccupied France welcomes you to
dialog: Casablanca.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: (in perfect English, smiling)
dialog: Thank you, Captain. It's very good
dialog: to be here.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant
dialog: Casselle.
text: As they acknowledge each other, Captain Tonelli barges in
text: front of Casselle and salutes Strasser.
speaker_heading: TONELLI
dialog: Captain Tonelli, the Italian
dialog: service, at your command, Major.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: That is kind of you.
text: But Tonelli gets no further than that as Strasser turns
text: again to Renault. They walk away from the plane, Heinze
text: following, with Casselle and Tonelli bringing up the rear,
text: engaged in a heated exchange of words.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: You may find the climate of
text: Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Oh, we Germans must get used to all
dialog: climates, from Russia to the Sahara.
dialog: But perhaps you were not referring
dialog: to the weather.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: (sidesteps the implication
dialog: with a smile)
dialog: What else, my dear Major?
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: (casually)
dialog: By the way, the murder of the
dialog: couriers, what has been done?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Realizing the importance of the
dialog: case, my men are rounding up twice
dialog: the usual number of suspects.
speaker_heading: HEINZE
dialog: We already know who the murderer is.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Good. Is he in custody?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight
dialog: he'll be at Rick's. Everybody
text: comes to Rick's.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: I have already heard about this
dialog: cafe, and also about Mr. Rick
dialog: himself.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RICK'S CAFE - NIGHT
text: The neon sign above the door is brightly lit. Customers
text: arrive and go in through the front door. From inside we
text: hear sounds of MUSIC and LAUGHTER. The song is "It Had
dialog: to Be You."
text: Again we isolate on the neon sign.
scene_heading: INSERT SIGN: "Rick's Cafe Americain".
text: We follow a group of customers inside.
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
text: Rick's is an expensive and chic nightclub which definitely
text: possesses an air of sophistication and intrigue.
text: SAM, a middle-aged Negro, sits on a stool before a small,
text: salmon-colored piano on wheels, playing and singing while
text: accompanied by a small orchestra.
text: All about him there is the HUM of voices, CHATTER and
scene_heading: LAUGHTER.
text: The occupants of the room are varied. There are Europeans
text: in their dinner jackets, their women beautifully begowned
text: and bejeweled. There are Moroccans in silk robes. Turks
text: wearing fezzes. Levantines. Naval officers. Members of
text: the Foreign Legion, distinguished by their kepis.
text: Two men sit at a table.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Waiting, waiting, waiting. I'll
dialog: never get out of here. I'll die in
dialog: Casablanca.
text: His companion seems uninterested in his dilemma. Sympathy
text: is evidently in short supply in Casablanca.
text: At another table a very well-dressed WOMAN talks toa
text: MOOR. She has a bracelet on her wrist. No other jewelry.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: But can't you make it just a little
dialog: more? Please.
speaker_heading: MOOR
dialog: I'm sorry, Madame, but diamonds are
dialog: a drug on the market. Everybody
dialog: sells diamonds. There are diamonds
dialog: everywhere. Two thousand, four
dialog: hundred.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: All right.
text: On to another table where two CONSPIRATORS talk.
speaker_heading: CONSPIRATOR
text: The trucks are waiting, the men are
dialog: waiting. Everything is...
text: He stops abruptly as two German officers walk by.
text: A REFUGEE and another MAN converse at another table.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: It's the fishing smack Santiago. It
dialog: leaves at one tomorrow night, here
dialog: from the end of La Medina. Third
dialog: boat.
speaker_heading: REFUGEE
dialog: Thank you, oh, thank you.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: And bring fifteen thousand francs in
dialog: cash. Remember, in cash.
text: On the way to the bar we pass several tables and hear a
dialog: Babel of foreign tongues. Here and there we catch a
text: scattered phrase or sentence in English.
text: SACHA, a friendly young Russian bartender, hands a drink to
text: a customer with the Russian equivalent of "Bottoms Up." The
text: customer answers with "Cheerio."
text: CARL, the waiter, is a fat, jovial German refugee with
dialog: 10.
text: spectacles. He walks, tray in hand, to a private door,
text: over which ABDUL, a large, burly man, stands guard.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Open up, Abdul.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: (respectfully)
dialog: Yes, Herr Professor.
text: Abdul opens the door and Carl goes into the gambling room.
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - GAMBLING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Their is much activity at the various tables. At one table
text: TwO WOMEN and a MAN play cards. They glance at another table.
text: One of them calls to Carl.
speaker_heading: FIRST WOMAN
dialog: Uh, waiter.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yes, Madame?
speaker_heading: FIRST WOMAN
dialog: Will you ask Rick if he'll have a
dialog: drink with us?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Madame, he never drinks with
dialog: customers. Never. I have never
dialog: seen him.
speaker_heading: SECOND WOMAN
dialog: (disappointedly)
dialog: What makes saloon-keepers so
dialog: snobbish?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (to Carl)
dialog: Perhaps if you told him I ran the
dialog: second largest banking house in
dialog: Amsterdam.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: The second largest? That wouldn't
dialog: impress Rick. The leading banker in
dialog: Amsterdam is now the pastry chef in
dialog: our kitchen.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: We have something to look forward to.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: And his father is the bell boy.
text: Carl laughs.
text: The overseer walks up to a table with a paper in his hand.
text: Then we see a drink and a man's hand, but nothing more. The
text: overseer places a check on the table. The hand picks up the
text: check and writes on it, in pencil, "Okay-Rick."
text: The overseer takes the check.
text: We now see RICK, sitting at a table alone playing solitary
text: chess. Rick is an American of indeterminate age. There is
text: no expression on his face -- complete deadpan.
text: There is a commotion at the door as people attempt to come
text: into the gambling room. He nods approval to Abdul.
text: Then a GERMAN appears in the doorway. Abdul looks to Rick
text: who glances back toward the open door and nods "no".
text: Abdul starts to close the door on the man.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: I'm sorry sir, this is a private room.
speaker_heading: GERMAN
dialog: Of all the nerve! who do you
dialog: think... I know there's gambling
dialog: in there! There's no secret. You
dialog: dare not keep me out of here!
text: The man tries to push his way through the door as Rick
text: walks up.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: Yes? What's the trouble?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: This gentleman --
text: The German interrupts and waves his card.
speaker_heading: GERMAN
dialog: I've been in every gambling room
dialog: between Honolulu and Berlin and if
dialog: you think I'm going to be kept out
dialog: of a saloon like this, you're very
dialog: much mistaken.
text: At this moment UGARTE, a small, thin man with a nervous air,
dialog: 12.
text: tries to squeeze through the doorway blocked by the German.
dialog: If he were an American, Ugarte would look like a tout.
text: He gets through and passes Rick.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: Uh, excuse me, please. Hello,
dialog: Rick.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Hello Ugarte.
text: Rick looks at the German calmly, takes the card out of his
text: hand, and tears it up.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Your cash is good at the bar.
speaker_heading: GERMAN
dialog: What! Do you know who I am?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I do. You're lucky the bar's open
dialog: to you.
speaker_heading: GERMAN
dialog: This is outrageous. I shall report
dialog: it to the Angriff!
text: The German storms off, tossing the pieces of his card into
text: the air behind him.
text: Rick meets Ugarte on his way back to his table.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: (fawning)
dialog: Huh. You know, Rick, watching you
dialog: just now with the Deutsches Bank
dialog: one would think you'd been doing
dialog: this all your life.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (stiffening)
dialog: Well, what makes you think I
dialog: haven't?
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: (vaguely)
dialog: Oh, nothing. But when you first
dialog: came to Casablanca, I thought --
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: 13.
dialog: -- You thought what?
text: Fearing to offend Rick, Ugarte laughs.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: What right do I have to think?
text: Ugarte pulls out a chair at Rick's table.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: May I? Too bad about those two
dialog: German couriers, wasn't it?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (indifferently)
dialog: They got a lucky break. Yesterday
text: they were just two German clerks.
dialog: Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: You are a very cynical person, Rick,
dialog: if you'll forgive me for saying so.
text: Ugarte sits down.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (shortly)
dialog: I forgive you.
text: A waiter comes up to the table with a tray of drinks. He
text: places one before Ugarte.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (to Rick)
dialog: Will you have a drink with me please?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: I forgot. You never drink with...
dialog: (to waiter)
dialog: I'll have another, please.
dialog: (to Rick, sadly)
dialog: You despise me, don't you?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (indifferently)
dialog: If I gave you any thought, I probably
dialog: would.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: But why? Oh, you object to the kind
dialog: He takes
dialog: 14.
dialog: of business I do, huh? But think of
dialog: all those poor refugees who must rot
dialog: in this place if I didn't help them.
dialog: That's not so bad. Through ways of
dialog: my own I provide them with exit
dialog: visas.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: But think of all the poor devils who
dialog: cannot meet Renault's price. I get
dialog: it for them for half. Is that so
dialog: parasitic?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I don't mind a parasite. I object
dialog: to a cut-rate one.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be
dialog: through with the whole business, and
dialog: I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Who did you bribe for your visa?
dialog: Renault or yourself?
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: (ironically)
dialog: Myself. I found myself much more
dialog: reasonable.
text: an envelope from his pocket and lays it on the table.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: Look, Rick, do you know what this
dialog: is? Something that even you have
dialog: never seen. Letters of transit
dialog: signed by General de Gaulle. Cannot
dialog: be rescinded, not even questioned.
text: Rick appears ready to take them form Ugarte.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: One moment. Tonight I'll be selling
dialog: those for more money than even I have
dialog: ever dreamed of, and then, addio
dialog: Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have
dialog: many friends in Casablanca, but
dialog: somehow, just because you despise me
dialog: you're the only one I trust. Will
dialog: you keep these for me? Please.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: For how long?
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little
dialog: longer.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I don't want them here overnight.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: Don't be afraid of that. Please
dialog: keep them for me. Thank you. I
dialog: knew I could trust you.
text: Rick takes them. Ugarte leaves the table just as the waiter
text: comes up.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: Oh, waiter. I'll be expecting some
dialog: people. If anybody asks for me,
dialog: I'll be right here.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Yes, Monsieur.
text: The waiter leaves. Ugarte turns to Rick.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: Rick, I hope you are more impressed
dialog: with me now, huh? If you'll forgive
dialog: me, I'll share my good luck with
dialog: your roulette wheel.
text: He starts across the floor.
speaker_heading: RICK
text: Just a moment.
text: Ugarte stops as Rick comes up to him.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yeah, I heard a rumor that those
text: German couriers were carrying
text: letters of transit.
text: Ugarte hesitates for a moment.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: Huh? I heard that rumor, too. Poor
dialog: devils.
text: Rick looks at Ugarte steadily.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: Yes, you're right, Ugarte. I ama
dialog: little more impressed with you.
text: Rick leaves the gambling room and goes into the main room.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
text: Rick makes his way over to Sam, who plays and sings the
text: "Knock Wood" number, accompanied by the orchestra. The
text: cafe is in semi-darkness. The spotlight is on Sam, and
text: every time the orchestra comes in on the "Knock Wood"
text: business, the spotlight swings over to the orchestra.
text: During one of the periods when the spotlight is on the
text: orchestra, Rick slips the letters of transit into the piano.
text: FERRARI, owner of the Blue Parrot, a competing night
text: spot, comes into the cafe, sits down, and watches Sam.
text: Then he sees Rick and they smile at each other. At the
text: end of the number Ferrari goes to the bar to speak to Rick.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: Hello, Rick.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Hello, Ferrari. How's business at
dialog: the Blue Parrot?
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: Fine, but I would like to buy your
dialog: cafe.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: It's not for sale.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: You haven't heard my offer.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: It's not for sale at any price.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: What do you want for Sam?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I don't buy or sell human beings.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: Rick and
dialog: 17.
dialog: That's too bad. That's Casablanca's
dialog: leading commodity. In refugees
dialog: alone we could make a fortune if you
dialog: would work with me through the black
dialog: market.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Suppose you run your business and
dialog: let me run mine.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like
dialog: to make a change.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Suppose we do.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: My dear Rick, when will you realize
dialog: that in this world today isolationism
dialog: is no longer a practical policy?
text: Ferrari walk over to the piano.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for
text: him at the Blue Parrot.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I like it fine here.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: He'll double what I pay you.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend
dialog: the money I make here.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Sorry.
text: Apparently satisfied, Ferrari walks away.
text: Back at the bar, YVONNE, an attractive young French woman,
text: sits on a stool drinking brandy.
text: Sacha, who looks at her with lovesick eyes, fills her
text: tumbler.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: The boss's private stock. Because,
dialog: Yvonne, I loff you.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: 18.
dialog: (morosely)
dialog: Oh, shut up.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: (fondly)
dialog: All right, all right. For you,
dialog: Yvonne, I shot opp, because, Yvonne,
dialog: I loff you. Uh oh.
text: Rick saunters over and leans on the bar, next to Yvonne.
text: He pays no attention to her. She looks at him bitterly,
text: without saying a word.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: Oh, Monsieur Rick, Monsieur Rick.
dialog: Some Germans, boom, boom, boom,
dialog: boom, gave this check. Is it all
dialog: right?
text: Rick looks the check over and tears it up. Yvonne has
text: never taken her eyes off Rick.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Where were you last night?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: That's so long ago, I don't remember.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Will I see you tonight?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (matter -of-factly)
dialog: I never make plans that far ahead.
text: Yvonne turns, looks at Sacha, and extends her glass to him.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Give me another.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Sacha, she's had enough.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill
dialog: it up.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: Yvonne, I loff you, but he pays me.
text: Yvonne wheels on Rick with drunken fury.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Rick, I'm sick and tired of having
dialog: 19.
dialog: you --
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: -- Sacha, call a cab.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: Yes, boss.
text: Rick takes Yvonne by the arm.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Come on, we're going to get your
dialog: coat.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Take your hands off me!
text: He pulls her along toward the door.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: No. You're going home. You've had
dialog: a little too much to drink.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RICK'S CAFE - NIGHT
text: Sacha stands at the curb on the street in front of Rick's
text: and signals for a cab.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: Taxi!
text: Soon one pulls up.
text: Rick and Yvonne come out of the cafe. He puts a coat over
text: her shoulders and she objects violently.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Who do you think you are, pushing me
dialog: around? What a fool I was to fall
dialog: for a man like you.
text: Rick and Yvonne approach the waiting cab.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (to Sacha)
dialog: You'd better go with her, Sacha, to
dialog: be sure she gets home.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: Yes, boss.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: 20.
dialog: And come right back.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: (his face falling)
dialog: Yes, boss.
text: Rick stands and looks up at the revolving beacon light from
text: the airport. It intermittently sheds its light on Rick's
dialog: face.
text: Renault sits at a table on the cafe terrace, watching this
text: evening's performance.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Hello, Rick.
text: Rick walks over to him.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Hello, Louis.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: How extravagant you are, throwing
dialog: away women like that. Someday they
dialog: may be scarce.
text: Rick sits down at the table.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: (amused)
dialog: You know, I think now I shall pay a
dialog: call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the
dialog: rebound, eh?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: When it comes to women, you're a
dialog: true democrat.
text: As they talk, Captain Tonelli and Lieutenant Casselle walk by
text: toward the entrance of the cafe. Casselle talks non-stop and
text: Tonelli tries. They both stop, salute Renault, and walk into
dialog: the cafe.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: If he gets a word in it'll bea
text: major Italian victory.
text: Rick laughs.
text: Rick and Renault look up when they hear the BUZZ of a plane
text: taking off from the adjacent airfield. The plane flies directly
text: over their heads.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: 21.
dialog: The plane to Lisbon.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You would like to be on it?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (curtly)
dialog: Why? What's in Lisbon?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: The clipper to America.
text: Rick doesn't answer. His look isn't a happy one.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: I have often speculated on why you
dialog: don't return to America. Did you
dialog: abscond with the church funds? Did
dialog: you run off with a senator's wife?
dialog: I like to think you killed a man.
dialog: It's the romantic in me.
text: Rick still looks in the direction of the airport.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: It was a combination of all three.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: And what in heaven's name brought
dialog: you to Casablanca?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: My health. I came to Casablanca for
dialog: the waters.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Waters? What waters? We're in the
dialog: desert.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I was misinformed.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Huh!
text: EMIL, the croupier, comes out of the cafe and walks over
dialog: to Rick.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a
dialog: gentleman inside has won twenty
dialog: thousand francs. The cashier
dialog: would like some money.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: 22.
dialog: Well, I'll get it from the safe.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You
dialog: know I can't understand --
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: -- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like
dialog: that happen all the time.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: I'm awfully sorry.
text: The three men enter the cafe.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
text: They pass Sam at the piano. He's playing "Baby Face". Rick
text: pats Sam on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Rick, there's going to be some
dialog: excitement here tonight. We are
dialog: going to make an arrest in your
dialog: cafe.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (somewhat annoyed)
dialog: What, again?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: This is no ordinary arrest. A
dialog: murderer, no less.
text: Rick's eyes react. Involuntarily, they glance toward the
dialog: gambling room.
text: Renault catches the look.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: If you are thinking of warning him,
dialog: don't put yourself out. He cannot
dialog: possibly escape.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I stick my neck out for nobody.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: A wise foreign policy.
text: They start upstairs to Rick's office, passing Casselle who
text: is still haranguing Tonelli.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: You know, Rick, we could have made
dialog: this arrest earlier in the evening
dialog: at the Blue Parrot, but out of my
dialog: high regard for you we are staging
dialog: it here. It will amuse your
dialog: customers.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Our entertainment is enough.
text: They go inside the office.
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Rick opens up the safe in a small, dark room just off the
dialog: office.
dialog: out.
text: Only Rick's shadow can be seen getting the money
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Rick, we are to have an important
dialog: guest tonight, Major Strasser of the
dialog: Third Reich, no less. We want him
dialog: to be here when we make the arrest.
dialog: A little demonstration of the
dialog: efficiency of my administration.
text: Rick moves out of the shadows and into view.
dialog: He gives
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I see. And what's Strasser doing
dialog: here? He certainly didn't come all
dialog: the way to Casablanca to witness a
dialog: demonstration of your efficiency.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Perhaps not.
dialog: the money to Emil.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Here you are.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: That's all right.
text: Emil departs.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: 24.
dialog: Louis, you've got something on your
dialog: mind. Why don't you spill it?
text: Rick closes the door to the office, then goes over to close
dialog: the safe.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: How observant you are. As a matter
dialog: of fact, I wanted to give you a word
dialog: of advice.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yeah? Have a brandy?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Thank you. Rick, there are many
dialog: exit visas sold in this cafe, but we
dialog: know that you have never sold one.
dialog: That is the reason we permit you to
dialog: remain open.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I thought it was because we let you
dialog: win at roulette.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: That is another reason. There is a
dialog: man who's arrived in Casablanca on
dialog: his way to America. He will offer
dialog: a fortune to anyone who will furnish
text: him with an exit visa.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yeah? What's his name?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Victor Laszlo.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Victor Laszlo?
text: Renault watches Rick's reaction.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Rick, that is the first time I have
dialog: ever seen you so impressed.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, he's succeeded in impressing
dialog: half the world.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: It is my duty to see that he doesn't
text: impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo
dialog: They sit
dialog: 25.
dialog: must never reach America. He stays
dialog: in Casablanca.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: It'll be interesting to see how he
dialog: Manages.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Manages what?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: His escape.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Oh, but I just told you. --
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: -- Stop it. He escaped froma
dialog: concentration camp and the Nazis
dialog: have been chasing him all over
dialog: Europe.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
text: This is the end of the chase.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
text: down to discuss the matter in earnest.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Is that a serious offer?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I just paid out twenty. I'd like to
dialog: get it back.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Make it ten. I am only a poor
dialog: corrupt official.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Done. No matter how clever he is,
dialog: he still needs an exit visa, or I
dialog: should say, two.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Why two?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
text: He is traveling with a lady.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: He'll take one.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: I think not. I have seen the lady.
dialog: And if he did not leave her in
dialog: Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly
dialog: won't leave her in Casablanca.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Maybe he's not quite as romantic as
dialog: you are.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
text: It doesn't matter. There is no exit
dialog: visa for him.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Louis, whatever gave you the impression
dialog: that I might be interested in helping
dialog: Laszlo escape?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect
dialog: that under that cynical shell you're
dialog: at heart a sentimentalist.
text: Rick makes a face.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen
dialog: to be familiar with your record.
dialog: Let me point out just two items. In
dialog: 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In
dialog: 1936, you fought in Spain on the
dialog: Loyalist side.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: And got well paid for it on both
dialog: occasions.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: The winning side would have paid you
dialog: much better.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Maybe. Well, it seems you are
dialog: determined to keep Laszlo here.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: I have my orders.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
text: Renault stands up.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: My dear Ricky, you overestimate the
dialog: influence of the Gestapo. I don't
dialog: interfere with them and they don't
dialog: interfere with me. In Casablanca I
dialog: am master of my fate. I am captain
dialog: of my --
text: He stops short as his AIDE enters.
speaker_heading: AIDE
dialog: -- Major Strasser is here, sir.
text: Renault starts to leave.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yeah, you were saying?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: (hurriedly)
dialog: Excuse me.
text: He hurries away. Rick smiles cynically.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
text: Renault walks up to Carl.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
text: Carl, see that Major Strasser gets a
text: good table, one close to the ladies.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I have already given him the best,
dialog: knowing he is German and would take
dialog: it anyway.
text: Renault walks over to one of his officers.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Take him quietly. Two guards at every
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Yes, sir. Everything is ready, sir.
text: The officer salutes and goes off to speak to the guards.
dialog: 28.
text: Renault walks over to Strasser's table as Rick comes down
dialog: the stairs.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Good evening, gentlemen.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Good evening, Captain.
speaker_heading: HEINZE
dialog: Won't you join us?
text: Renault sits down.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Thank you. It is a pleasure to have
dialog: you here, Major.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: (to the waiter)
text: Champagne and a tin of caviar.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: May I recommend Veuve Cliquot
dialog: '26, a good French wine.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Very well, sir.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: A very interesting club.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Especially so tonight, Major. Ina
dialog: few minutes you will see the arrest
dialog: of the man who murdered your couriers.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: I expected no less, Captain.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - GAMBLING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Ugarte stands at the roulette table. Two gendarmes approach
text: him from behind.
speaker_heading: GENDARME
dialog: Monsieur Ugarte?
text: Ugarte looks around.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: Oh. Yes?
speaker_heading: GENDARME
dialog: Will you please come with us.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: Certainly. May I first please cash
dialog: my chips?
text: The officer nods. They follow Ugarte to the cashier's
text: window. Ugarte puts his chips through the window to the
speaker_heading: CASHIER.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: Pretty lucky, huh? Two thousand,
dialog: please.
text: Two more guards station themselves at the door in case there
dialog: is trouble.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Two thousand.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: Thank you.
text: Ugarte starts to walk out, followed by the gendarmes. When
text: he reaches the doorway he suddenly rushes through and slams
text: the door behind himself.
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
text: By the time the gendarmes manage to get the door open again,
text: Ugarte has pulled a gun.
text: He FIRES at the doorway. The SHOTS bring on pandemonium in
dialog: the cafe.
text: As Ugarte runs through the hallway he sees Rick, appearing
text: from the opposite direction, and grabs him.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: Rick! Rick, help me!
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: Rick, hide me. Do something! You
dialog: must help me, Rick. Do something!
dialog: 30.
text: Guards and gendarmes rush in and grab Ugarte. Rick stands
text: impassively as they drag Ugarte off.
speaker_heading: UGARTE
dialog: Rick! Rick!
text: We move to Strasser's table, who has witnessed the event.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Excellent, Captain.
text: Back to Rick, still standing where he was, as a CUSTOMER
text: walks by.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: When they come to get me, Rick, I
dialog: hope you'll be more of a help.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I stick my neck out for nobody.
text: Rick comes out to the middle of the floor. An air of tense
text: expectancy pervades the room. A few customers are on the
text: point of leaving. Rick speaks in a very calm voice.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I'm sorry there was a disturbance,
dialog: folks, but it's all over now.
dialog: Everything's all right. Just sit
dialog: down and have a good time. Enjoy
dialog: yourself.
text: Rick glances toward Sam.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: All right, Sam.
text: Sam nods and begins to play.
text: Renault, Strasser, and Heinze sit calmly at their table
text: after witnessing the arrest.
text: Rick walks by.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: (calling to Rick)
dialog: Oh, Rick?
text: Rick stops and comes over to their table.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser
dialog: of the Third Reich.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: How do you do, Mr. Rick?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Oh, how do you do?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: And you already know Herr Heinze of
dialog: the Third Reich.
text: Rick nods to Strasser and Heinze.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Please join us, Mr. Rick.
text: Rick sits down with them.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: We are very honored tonight, Rick.
dialog: Major Strasser is one of the
dialog: reasons the Third Reich enjoys the
dialog: reputation it has today.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: You repeat "Third Reich" as though
dialog: you expected there to be others.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Well, personally, Major, I will take
dialog: what comes.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: (to Rick)
dialog: Do you mind if I ask you a few
dialog: questions? Unofficially, of course.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Make it official, if you like.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: What is your nationality?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (pokerfaced)
dialog: I'm a drunkard.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: That makes Rick a citizen of the
dialog: world.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I was born in New York City if
dialog: that'll help you any.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: I understand you came here from
dialog: Paris at the time of the occupation.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: There seems to be no secret about that.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Are you one of those people who
dialog: cannot imagine the Germans in their
dialog: beloved Paris?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: It's not particularly my beloved
dialog: Paris.
speaker_heading: HEINZE
dialog: Can you imagine us in London?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: When you get there, ask me.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Ho, diplomatist!
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: How about New York?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, there are certain sections of
dialog: New York, Major, that I wouldn't
dialog: advise you to try to invade.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Aha. Who do you think will win
dialog: the war?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I haven't the slightest idea.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Rick is completely neutral about
dialog: everything. And that takes in the
dialog: field of women, too.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: You weren't always so carefully
dialog: neutral. We have a complete dossier
dialog: on you.
text: Strasser takes a little black book from his pocket and turns
dialog: to a certain page.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Strasser
dialog: 33.
dialog: "Richard Blaine, American. Age,
dialog: thirty-seven. Cannot return to his
dialog: country."
text: looks up from the book
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: The reason is a little vague. We
dialog: also know what you did in Paris, Mr.
dialog: Blaine, and also we know why you
dialog: left Paris.
text: Rick reaches over and takes the book from Strasser's hand.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Don't worry. We are not going to
dialog: broadcast it.
text: Rick looks up from the book.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Are my eyes really brown?
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: You will forgive my curiosity, Mr.
dialog: Blaine. The point is, an enemy of
dialog: the Reich has come to Casablanca and
dialog: we are checking up on anybody who
dialog: can be of any help to us.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (glances toward Renault)
dialog: My interest in whether Victor
dialog: Laszlo stays or goes is purely a
dialog: sporting one.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: In this case, you have no sympathy
dialog: for the fox, huh?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Not particularly. I understand the
text: point of view of the hound, too.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Victor Laszlo published the foulest
dialog: lies in the Prague newspapers until
dialog: the very day we marched in, and even
dialog: after that he continued to print
text: scandal sheets in a cellar.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Of course, one must admit he has
dialog: great courage.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: I admit he is very clever. Three
dialog: times he slipped through our fingers.
dialog: In Paris he continued his activities.
dialog: We intend not to let it happen again.
text: Rick gets up.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your
dialog: business is politics. Mine is
text: running a saloon.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
text: Rick walks away toward the gambling room.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: You see, Major, you have nothing to
dialog: worry about Rick.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Perhaps.
text: A couple comes in the front door. They are VICTOR LASZLO,
text: the Czech resistance leader, and a very pretty young woman
text: wearing a simple white gown, MISS ILSA LUND. She is so
text: beautiful, in fact, that people turn to stare.
text: The HEADWAITER comes up to them.
speaker_heading: HEADWAITER
dialog: Yes, Monsieur?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
speaker_heading: HEADWAITER
dialog: Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.
text: As the headwaiter takes them to a table they pass by the
text: piano, and the woman looks at Sam.
text: Sam, with a conscious effort, keeps his eyes on the keyboard
text: as they go past. He appears to know this woman. After she
text: has gone by Sam steals a look in her direction.
text: BERGER, a Slight, middle-aged man, observes the couple from
text: a distance.
text: The headwaiter seats Ilsa. Laszlo takes the chair opposite
text: and surveys the room.
text: Strasser and Renault look up at them from their table.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Two cointreaux, please.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Yes, Monsieur.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: (to Ilsa)
dialog: I saw no one of Ugarte's description.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't
dialog: stay here.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: If we would walk out so soon, it
dialog: would only call attention to us.
dialog: Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part
dialog: of the cafe.
text: Berger walks up to their table.
speaker_heading: BERGER
dialog: Excuse me, but you look like a
text: couple who are on their way to
dialog: America.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Well?
text: Berger takes a ring from his finger.
speaker_heading: BERGER
dialog: You will find a market there for
dialog: this ring. I am forced to sell it
text: at a great sacrifice.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Thank you, but I hardly think --
speaker_heading: BERGER
dialog: -- Then perhaps for the lady. The
dialog: ring is quite unique.
text: He holds it down for their view. Carefully lifting up the
dialog: stone, he reveals...
text: INSERT - a gold plate in the setting underneath, an
text: impression of the Lorraine Cross of General de Gaulle.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: 35.
dialog: 36.
dialog: Oh, yes, I'm very interested.
text: Berger sits down with them.
speaker_heading: BERGER
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: (lower voice)
dialog: What is your name?
speaker_heading: BERGER
dialog: Berger, Norwegian, and at your
dialog: service, sir.
text: Renault approaches the table from behind Laszlo. Ilsa tries
text: to warn him.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Victor...
text: Laszlo understands.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: (in a low voice)
dialog: I'll meet you in a few minutes at
dialog: the bar.
dialog: (in a louder voice)
dialog: I do not think we want to buy the
dialog: ring. But thank you for showing
dialog: it to us.
text: Berger, taking the cue, sighs and puts the ring away.
speaker_heading: BERGER
dialog: Such a bargain. But that is your
dialog: decision?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: I'm sorry. It is.
text: Berger gets up and leaves as Renault moves to the table.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: I am Captain Renault, Prefect of
dialog: Police.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: 37.
dialog: Yes. What is it you want?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: (amiably)
dialog: Merely to welcome you to Casablanca
dialog: and wish you a pleasant stay. It is
dialog: not often we have so distinguished a
dialog: visitor.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Thank you. I hope you'll forgive
dialog: me, Captain, but the present French
dialog: administration has not always been
dialog: so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa
dialog: Lund?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: I was informed you were the most
dialog: beautiful woman ever to visit
dialog: Casablanca. That was a gross
dialog: understatement.
text: Ilsa's manner is friendly and reserved, her voice low
dialog: and soft.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: You are very kind.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Won't you join us?
text: He sits down.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: If you will permit me.
dialog: (calls to the waiter)
dialog: Oh, Emil. Please, a bottle of
dialog: your best champagne, and put it
dialog: on my bill.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Very well, sir.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: No, Captain, please.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: No. Please, Monsieur, it is a
dialog: little game we play. They put
dialog: it on the bill, I tear the bill
dialog: up. It is very convenient.
text: Ilsa glances off in Sam's direction.
speaker_heading: ILSA
text: Captain, the boy who is playing the
dialog: piano, somewhere I have seen him.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Sam?
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: He came from Paris with Rick.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Rick? Who's he?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and
dialog: Rick is --
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: -- Is what?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of
dialog: aman that, well, if I were a woman
dialog: and I...
dialog: (taps his chest)
dialog: were not around, I should be in love
dialog: with Rick. But what a fool I am
text: talking to a beautiful woman about
text: another man.
text: Renault jumps to his feet as Strasser enters.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Excuse me. Ah, Major. Mademoiselle
dialog: Lund, Monsieur Laszlo, may I present
dialog: Major Heinrich Strasser.
text: Strasser bows and smiles pleasantly.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: How do you do. This is a pleasure I
dialog: have long looked forward to.
dialog: There is not the slightest recognition from either Ilsa
dialog: or Laszlo.
text: Strasser waits to be asked to seat himself.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am
dialog: 39.
dialog: not gracious, but you see, Major
dialog: Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you
dialog: are a subject of the German Reich!
text: Laszlo stands.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: I've never accepted that privilege,
dialog: and I'm now on French soil.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: I should like to discuss some matters
dialog: arising from your presence on French
dialog: soil.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: This is hardly the time or the place.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: (hardening)
dialog: Then we shall state another time and
dialog: another place. Tomorrow at ten in
text: the Prefect's office, with
dialog: Mademoiselle.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Captain Renault, I am under your
dialog: authority. Is it your order that we
dialog: come to your office?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: (amiably)
dialog: Let us say that it is my request.
dialog: That is a much more pleasant word.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Very well.
text: Renault and Strasser bow shortly.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Mademoiselle.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Mademoiselle.
text: Renault and Strasser walk away.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: A very clever tactical retreat,
dialog: 40.
dialog: Major.
text: Strasser looks at Renault sharply, but sees only a
text: noncommittal smile on Renault's face.
text: Laszlo remains standing at the table as Strasser and
dialog: Renault leave.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: This time they really mean to
dialog: stop me.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Victor, I'm afraid for you.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: We have been in difficult places
dialog: before, haven't we?
text: Ilsa smiles back at him, but her eyes are still troubled.
text: On the floor, CORINA strums a guitar and begins her number.
text: Meanwhile, Laszlo looks about with apparent casualness. He
text: sees Strasser and Renault whispering together, then notices
text: Berger at the bar.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: I must find out what Berger knows.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Be careful.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: I will, don't worry.
text: He rises and goes off.
text: We see Ilsa's troubled profile.
text: While Corina sings, Sam gives a worried glance in Ilsa's
text: direction. Ilsa watches him.
text: At the bar, Berger sips a drink. Laszlo walks up and
text: casually takes a place at the bar next to Berger.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see
dialog: it again?
speaker_heading: BERGER
dialog: Yes, Monsieur.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: 41.
dialog: (to Sacha)
dialog: A champagne cocktail, please.
text: Laszlo takes the ring and looks at it.
speaker_heading: BERGER
dialog: (in a low voice)
dialog: I recognize you from the news
dialog: photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
text: In a concentration camp, one is apt
dialog: to lose a little weight.
speaker_heading: BERGER
dialog: We read five times that you were
text: killed in five different places.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: (smiles wryly)
dialog: AS you see, it was true every single
dialog: time. Thank heaven I found you,
dialog: Berger. I am looking for a man by
dialog: the name of Ugarte. He is supposed
dialog: to help me.
text: Berger shakes his head.
speaker_heading: BERGER
text: Ugarte cannot even help himself,
text: Monsieur. He is under arrest for
dialog: murder. He was arrested here
dialog: tonight.
text: Laszlo absorbs the shock quietly.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: BERGER
dialog: (with intense devotion)
dialog: But we who are still free will do
dialog: all we can. We are organized,
dialog: Monsieur, underground like everywhere
dialog: else. Tomorrow night there is a
dialog: meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If
dialog: you would come...
text: He stops when Sacha brings the drink to Laszlo.
text: Corina finishes her song, and the crowd applauds quite
text: enthusiastically.
text: Ilsa sits alone at her table.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: (to waiter)
dialog: Will you ask the piano player to
dialog: come over here, please?
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Very well, Mademoiselle.
text: Renault comes up to the bar near Berger and Laszlo.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: How's the jewelry business, Berger?
speaker_heading: BERGER
dialog: Er, not so good.
dialog: (to Sacha)
dialog: May I have my check, please?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Too bad you weren't here earlier,
dialog: Monsieur Laszlo. We had quite a bit
dialog: of excitement this evening, didn't
dialog: we, Berger?
speaker_heading: BERGER
dialog: Er, yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: My bill.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Sam wheels in the piano to Ilsa's table. On his face is
dialog: that funny fear.
text: Ilsa herself is not as self-possessed as she tries to
text: appear. There is something behind this, some mystery.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Hello, Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected
dialog: to see you again.
text: He sits down and is ready to play.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: It's been a long time.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under
dialog: the bridge.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Some of the old songs, Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
text: Sam begins to play a number. He is nervous, waiting for
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Where is Rick?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (evading)
dialog: I don't know. I ain't seen him all
dialog: night.
text: Sam looks very uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: When will he be back?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Not tonight no more. He ain't
dialog: coming. Uh, he went home.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Does he always leave so early?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh, he never... well...
dialog: (desperately)
dialog: he's got a girl up at the Blue
text: Parrot. He goes up there all
dialog: the time.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: You used to be a much better liar,
dialog: Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're
dialog: bad luck to him.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Play it once, Sam, for old time's
dialog: sake.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: 44.
dialog: I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa.
dialog: I'm a little rusty on it.
text: Of course he can. He doesn't want to play it. He seems
text: even more scared now.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: I'll hum it for you.
text: Ilsa starts to hum.
text: Sam begins to play it very softly.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Sing it, Sam.
text: And Sam sings.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You must remember this,
dialog: A kiss is just a kiss,
text: A sigh is just a sigh,
dialog: The fundamental things apply,
text: As time goes by.
text: The door to the gambling room opens. Rick comes swinging
text: out. He's heard the music and he's livid.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: And when two lovers woo,
dialog: They both say I love you,
dialog: On that you can rely,
dialog: No matter what the future brings,
text: As time goes by.
text: Rick walks briskly up to the piano.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Sam, I thought I told you never to
dialog: play...
text: As he sees Ilsa he stops short. Sam stops playing.
text: Two close-ups reveal Ilsa and Rick seeing each other.
text: Rick appears shocked. For a long moment he just looks at her.
text: Sam prepares to move the piano away.
dialog: 45.
text: Renault and Laszlo approach the table from the bar.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: (to Ilsa)
dialog: Well, you were asking about Rick and
dialog: here he is. Mademoiselle, may I
dialog: present --
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: -- Hello, Ilsa.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Hello, Rick.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Oh, you've already met Rick,
dialog: Mademoiselle?
text: There's no answer from either.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Well then, perhaps you also ---
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: -- This is Mr. Laszlo.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: How do you do?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: How do you do?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
text: One hears a great deal about Rick in
dialog: Casablanca.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Won't you join us for a drink?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Oh, no, Rick never --
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: -- Thanks. I will.
text: Rick sits down.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Well! A precedent is being broken.
dialog: 46.
dialog: Er, Emil!
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: This is a very interesting cafe. I
dialog: congratulate you.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: And I congratulate you.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Your work.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Thank you. I try.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: We all try. You succeed.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: I can't get over you two. She was
dialog: asking about you earlier, Rick, ina
dialog: way that made me extremely jealous.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: (to Rick)
dialog: I wasn't sure you were the same.
dialog: Let's see, the last time we met --
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: -- It was "La Belle Aurore."
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: How nice. You remembered. But of
dialog: course, that was the day the Germans
dialog: marched into Paris.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Not an easy day to forget.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I remember every detail. The
dialog: Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Yes. I put that dress away. When
dialog: the Germans march out, I'll wear it
dialog: again.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Ricky, you're becoming quite human.
dialog: I suppose we have to thank you for
dialog: that, Mademoiselle.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to
dialog: say it, but it's late.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: (glancing at
dialog: his wristwatch)
dialog: So it is. And we have a curfew here
dialog: in Casablanca. It would never do
dialog: for the Chief of Police to be found
dialog: drinking after hours and have to
dialog: fine himself.
text: Rick and Ilsa look at each other.
text: Laszlo signals the waiter
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Not at all.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: (to Laszlo)
dialog: Your check, sir.
text: Rick takes the check.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (to waiter)
dialog: Oh, it's my party.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Another precedent gone. This has
dialog: been a very interesting evening.
dialog: I'll call you a cab. Gasoline
dialog: rationing, time of night.
text: Renault leaves.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: We'll come again.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Any time.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Say goodnight to Sam for me.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I will.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: There's still nobody in the world
dialog: who can play "As Time Goes By" like
dialog: Sam.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: He hasn't played it in a long time.
text: Ilsa smiles.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Goodnight.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Goodnight.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Goodnight.
text: Rick and Laszlo nod goodnight to each other. Laszlo and
text: Ilsa start to the door as Rick sits down again and stares
text: off in their direction.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RICK'S CAFE - NIGHT
text: Ilsa and Laszlo leave the cafe.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: A very puzzling fellow, this Rick.
dialog: What sort is he?
text: Ilsa doesn't look at him.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Oh, I really can't say, though I saw
dialog: him quite often in Paris.
text: They join Renault at the curb.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
text: Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's
dialog: office.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: We'll be there.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: 49.
dialog: Goodnight.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Goodnight.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Goodnight.
text: They get into a waiting cab, leaving Renault on the curb,
text: smoking and looking bemused.
text: The neon sign goes off and the doorway is now illuminated
text: by the revolving beacon from the airport.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
text: The customers have all gone. The house lights are out.
text: Rick sits alone at a table. There is a glass of bourbon
text: on the table directly in front of him, and another empty
text: glass on the table before an empty chair. Near at hand is
text: a bottle.
text: He fills his glass and drinks it quickly.
text: Rick just sits. His face is entirely expressionless. The
text: beacon light from the airport sweeps around the room
text: creating a mood of unreality.
text: Sam comes in and stands hesitantly beside Rick.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Boss.
text: No answer, as Rick drinks.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Boss!
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Boss, ain't you going to bed?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Not right now.
text: Sam now realizes Rick is in a very grim mood.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (lightly)
dialog: Ain't you planning on going to bed
dialog: in the near future?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You ever going to bed?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Well, I ain't sleepy either.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Good. Then have a drink.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No. Not me, boss.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Then don't have a drink.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Boss, let's get out of here.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (emphatically)
dialog: No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (earnestly)
dialog: Please, boss, let's go. Ain't
dialog: nothing but trouble for you here.
speaker_heading: RICK
text: She's coming back. I know she's
text: coming back.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: We'll take the car and drive all
dialog: night. We'll get drunk. We'll go
dialog: fishing and stay away until she's
dialog: gone.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Shut up and go home, will you?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (stubbornly)
dialog: No, sir. I'm staying right here.
text: Sam sits down at the piano and starts to play softly,
dialog: 50.
dialog: 51.
text: improvising.
speaker_heading: RICK
text: They grab Ugarte and she walks in.
dialog: Well, that's the way it goes. One
dialog: in, one out. Sam?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah, boss?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Sam, if it's December 1941 in
dialog: Casablanca, what time is it in New
dialog: York?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Uh, my watch stopped.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I bet they're asleep in New York.
dialog: I'll bet they're asleep all over
dialog: America.
text: Suddenly he pounds the table and buries his head in his
text: arms. Then he raises his head, trying to regain control.
dialog: He holds
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Of all the gin joints in all the
dialog: towns in all the world, she walks
dialog: into mine.
text: his head in his hands.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: What's that you're playing?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Just a little something of my own.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, stop it. You know what I want
dialog: to hear.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No, I don't.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You played it for her and you can
dialog: play it for me.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Well, I don't think I can remember it.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: 52.
dialog: If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes, boss.
text: Sam starts to play "As Time Goes By."
text: Rick just stares ahead as orchestra MUSIC slowly joins Sam's
dialog: playing.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: MONTAGE - PARIS IN THE SPRING
text: A) The Arc de Triomphe from a distance.
text: B) Rick drives a small, open car slowly along the boulevard.
text: He puts his arm around Ilsa. The background scenery
text: changes to a country road as she snuggles close to him
text: and puts her head on his shoulder.
text: C) An excursion boat on the Seine. Rick and Ilsa stand at
text: the rail of the boat. They seem to be transported by
text: each other as Ilsa laughs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S PARIS APARTMENT - DAY
text: Ilsa fixes flowers at the window while Rick opens champagne.
text: She walks over and joins him.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Who are you really? And what were
dialog: you before? What did you do and
dialog: what did you think? Huh?
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: We said "no questions."
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Here's looking at you, kid.
dialog: They drink.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PARIS CAFE - NIGHT
text: Inside a swank Paris cafe, Rick and Ilsa dance. They
text: appear to be very much in love as the MUSIC plays.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 53.
scene_heading: INT. ILSA'S PARIS APARTMENT - DAY
text: Ilsa flips a coin, then tosses it over to Rick.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: A franc for your thoughts.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: In America they'd bring only a
dialog: penny. I guess that's about all
dialog: they're worth.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: I'm willing to be overcharged.
dialog: Tell me.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: And I was wondering.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find
dialog: you waiting for me to come along.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Why there is no other man in my
dialog: life?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: That's easy. There was. He's dead.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we
dialog: said "no questions."
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Well, only one answer can take care
dialog: of all our questions.
text: They kiss passionately.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: MONTAGE - NEWSREEL FOOTAGE OF THE GERMAN OCCUPATION OF FRANCE.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PARIS CAFE - DAY
text: A man sells newspapers to people crowded around him. There
text: is much excitement. Rick and Ilsa sit at a table. They buy
text: a newspaper and begin to read it.
text: Nearby, a group of frightened French people cluster around a
text: loudspeaker on a wagon. A harsh voice barks out the tragic
text: news of the Nazi push toward Paris.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Nothing can stop them now.
dialog: Wednesday, Thursday at the latest,
dialog: they'll be in Paris.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: (frightened)
dialog: Richard, they'll find out your

speaker_heading: RICK

dialog: their roll of honor.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LA BELLE AURORE - AFTERNOON
text: A small cafe in the Montmartre. A shadow on the floor
text: reflects the cafe sign "La Belle Aurore."
text: Rick, at the bar, gets glasses and a bottle of champagne.
text: He walks over to Ilsa and Sam at the piano.
text: Sam plays "As Time Goes By."
text: Ilsa seems unnerved. There is evidently something on her
dialog: mind.
text: Rick pours the champagne. His manner is wry, but not the
dialog: bitter wryness we have seen in Casablanca.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Henri wants us to finish this bottle
dialog: and then three more. He says he'll
dialog: water his garden with champagne
dialog: before he'll let the Germans drink
dialog: 55.
dialog: any of it.
text: Sam looks at his glass.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: This sort of takes the sting out of
dialog: being occupied, doesn't it, Mr.
dialog: Richard?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You said it!
dialog: (to Ilsa)
dialog: Here's looking at you, kid.
text: Suddenly a loudspeaker BLARES out something in German. Rick
text: and Ilsa look at each other, then hurry to the window.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: My German's a little rusty.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: It's the Gestapo. They say they
dialog: expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
dialog: They are telling us how to act when
text: they come marching in.
text: She smiles faintly.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: With the whole world crumbling, we
dialog: pick this time to fall in love.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yeah. It's pretty bad timing.
dialog: Where were you, say, ten years ago?
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Ten years ago? Let's see...
dialog: (pause as she thinks a bit)
dialog: ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my
dialog: teeth. Where were you?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Looking for a job.
text: Ilsa looks at him tenderly. Rick takes her in his arms, and
text: kisses her hungrily. While they are locked in an embrace
text: they hear the dull BOOM of cannons.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: (frightened)
dialog: Was that cannon fire, or is it my
dialog: heart pounding?
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (grimly )
dialog: Ah, that's the new German 77. And
dialog: judging by the sound, only about
text: thirty-five miles away.
text: Another BOOM from the cannons.
speaker_heading: RICK
text: And getting closer every minute.
dialog: Here. Drink up. We'll never finish
dialog: the other three.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: The Germans'1ll be here pretty soon
dialog: now, and they'll come looking for
dialog: you. And don't forget there's a
dialog: price on your head.
text: Ilsa reacts to this worriedly.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I left a note in my apartment.
dialog: They'11 know where to find me.
text: Ilsa looks at Rick.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Strange. I know so very little
dialog: about you.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I know very little about you, just
dialog: the fact that you had your teeth
dialog: straightened.
text: He chuckles.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: But be serious, darling. You are in
dialog: danger and you must leave Paris.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: No, no, no, no. We must leave.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: (seriously)
dialog: Yes, of course, we --
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: -- The train for Marseilles leaves
dialog: at five o'clock. I'll pick you up
dialog: at your hotel at four-thirty.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I
dialog: have things to do in the city before
dialog: I leave. I'll meet you at the
dialog: station, huh?
speaker_heading: RICK
text: All right. At a quarter to five.
dialog: (a thought strikes him)
dialog: Say, why don't we get married in
dialog: Marseilles?
text: Rick chuckles again.
dialog: Suddenly
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: (evasively)
text: That's too far ahead to plan.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yes, I guess it is a little too far
dialog: ahead. Well, let's see. What about
dialog: the engineer? Why can't he marry us
dialog: on the train?
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Oh, darling!
text: Ilsa turns away and starts to cry.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, why not? The captain ona
dialog: ship can. It doesn't seem fair
dialog: that... Hey, hey, what's wrong,
dialog: kid?
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: I love you so much, and I hate this
dialog: war so much. Oh, it's a crazy
dialog: world. Anything can happen. If you
dialog: shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if
dialog: something should keep us apart,
dialog: wherever they put you and wherever
dialog: I'll be, I want you to know...
text: She can't go on. She lifts her face to his. He kisses
text: her gently.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Kiss me. Kiss me as if it were the
dialog: last time.
text: He looks into her eyes, then he does kiss her as though
dialog: it were going to be the last time.
dialog: 58.

text: There is a hectic, fevered excitement, evident in the faces
text: of the people that pass by. This is the last train from Paris.
text: Rick appears in the crowd. He stops and puts his suitcase down
text: and glances at his watch.
text: A conductor calls out "All aboard, last train leaving in
dialog: three minutes."
text: Rain pours over his head and shoulders, but he doesn't seem to
text: notice. He nervously checks his watch again.
text: Suddenly Sam appears.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Where is she? Have you seen her?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
text: She checked out of the hotel. But
dialog: this note came just after you left.
text: Sam pulls an envelope from his pocket. Rick grabs it, opens
text: it, and stares down at the letter.
speaker_heading: INSERT LETTER
dialog: Richard,
dialog: I cannot go with you or ever see you
dialog: again. You must not ask why. Just
dialog: believe that I love you. Go, my
dialog: darling, and God bless you.
dialog: Ilsa
text: Raindrops pour down the letter, smudging the writing.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: A whistle BLOwS.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (frantically)
dialog: That's the last call, Mr. Richard,
dialog: 59.
dialog: do you hear me? Come on, Mr.
dialog: Richard. Let's get out of here.
dialog: Come on, Mr. Richard, come on.
text: Sam pulls a stunned, reluctant Rick to the train. The train
text: starts to move just as he boards.
text: From the steps he looks off into the distance, then crumbles
text: the letter and tosses it away as the steam from the engine
text: clouds over him.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
text: Close-up of a glass on the table in the cafe. Rick's hand
text: reaches for it and knocks it over. We now see Rick's face
text: and he's very drunk.
text: Sam walks over to the table to pick up the glass and a
text: fallen chair.
text: Just then the door opens and it's Ilsa. Rick stares at
text: the doorway. Ilsa lingers a moment, then comes over to
dialog: the table.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Rick, I have to talk to you.
text: Her manner is a little uncertain, a little tentative, but
text: with a quiet determination beneath it.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Oh. I saved my first drink to have
dialog: with you. Here.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Especially tonight.
text: She sits down in the chair before the empty glass. Her eyes
text: are searching his face, but there is no expression on it
text: except a cold and impassive one.
text: Rick reaches for the bottle, and pours himself another drink.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Why did you have to come to Casablanca?
dialog: There are other places.
dialog: He takes
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: I wouldn't have come if I had known
dialog: that you were here. Believe me,
dialog: Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: It's funny about your voice, how it
text: hasn't changed. I can still hear
dialog: it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you
dialog: any place. We'll get on a train
dialog: together and never stop."
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can
dialog: understand how you feel.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Huh! You understand how I feel.
dialog: How long was it we had, honey?
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: I didn't count the days.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, I did. Every one of them.
dialog: Mostly I remember the last one. A
text: wow finish. A guy standing ona
text: station platform in the rain with a
text: comical look on his face, because
text: his insides had been kicked out.
text: a drink.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Can I tell you a story, Rick?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Has it got a wow finish?
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: I don't know the finish yet.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one
dialog: will come to you as you go along.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: It's about a girl who had just come
dialog: to Paris from her home in Oslo. At
dialog: the house of some friends she met a
dialog: man about whom she'd heard her whole
dialog: life, a very great and courageous
dialog: man. He opened up for her a whole
dialog: 61.
dialog: beautiful world full of knowledge
dialog: and thoughts and ideals. Everything
dialog: she knew or ever became was because
text: of him. And she looked up to him
dialog: and worshipped him with a feeling
dialog: she supposed was love.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a
dialog: story once. As a matter of fact,
dialog: I've heard a lot of stories in my
dialog: time. They went along with the
text: sound of a tinny piano playing in
dialog: the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I
dialog: met a man once when I was a kid,"
dialog: it'd always begin. Huh. I guess
dialog: neither one of our stories was very
dialog: funny. Tell me, who was it you left
dialog: me for? Was it Laszlo, or were
dialog: there others in between? Or aren't
dialog: you the kind that tells?
text: Ilsa gets up and leaves.
text: Rick's head slumps over the table.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RENAULT'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: A sign on the door reads: Captain Renault, Prefect de Police.
text: Strasser sits while Renault attends to some paperwork.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: I strongly suspect that Ugarte left
dialog: the letters of transit with Mr.
dialog: Blaine. I would suggest you search
text: the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: If Rick has the letters, he's much
dialog: too smart to let you find them
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: You give him credit for too much
dialog: cleverness. My impression was that
text: he's just another blundering
dialog: American.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: But we mustn't underestimate
dialog: American blundering. I was with
dialog: 62.
dialog: them when they "blundered" into
dialog: Berlin in 1918.
text: Strasser looks at him.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: As to Laszlo, we want him watched
dialog: twenty-four hours a day.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: (reassuringly)
dialog: It may interest you to know that at
text: this very moment he is on his way
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PREFECTURE LOBBY - MORNING

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RENAULT'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: Laszlo and Ilsa enter Renault's office.
text: Renault bows to them both.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: I am delighted to see you both. Did
dialog: you have a good night's rest?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: I slept very well.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: That's strange. Nobody is supposed
dialog: to sleep well in Casablanca.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: May we proceed with the business?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Thank you.
text: They take their seats.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: (now as cold as Laszlo)
dialog: Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will
dialog: not mince words. You are an
dialog: escaped prisoner of the Reich.
dialog: So far you have been fortunate
dialog: enough in eluding us. You have
dialog: reached Casablanca. It is my
dialog: duty to see that you stay in
dialog: Casablanca.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Whether or not you succeed is,
dialog: of course, problematical.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Not at all. Captain Renault's
dialog: signature is necessary on every
dialog: exit visa.
dialog: (turns to Renault)
dialog: Captain, would you think it is
dialog: possible that Herr Laszlo will
dialog: receive a visa?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: I am afraid not. My regrets,
dialog: Monsieur.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Well, perhaps I shall like it in
dialog: Casablanca.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: And Mademoiselle?
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: You needn't be concerned about me.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Is that all you wish to tell us?
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Don't be in such a hurry. You have
dialog: all the time in the world. You may
dialog: be in Casablanca indefinitely...
dialog: or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow,
dialog: on one condition.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: 64.
dialog: And that is?
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: You know the leaders of the
dialog: underground movement in Paris, in
dialog: Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam,
dialog: in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Even in Berlin.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Yes, even in Berlin. If you will
dialog: furnish me with their names and
dialog: their exact whereabouts, you will
dialog: have your visa in the morning.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: And the honor of having served the
dialog: Third Reich.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: I was in a German concentration camp
dialog: for a year. That's honor enough for
dialog: a lifetime.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: You will give us the names?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: If I didn't give them to you ina
dialog: concentration camp where you had
dialog: more "persuasive methods" at your
dialog: disposal, I certainly won't give
dialog: them to you now.
text: The passionate conviction in his voice now reveals the
dialog: crusader.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: And what if you track down these men
dialog: and kill them? What if you murdered
dialog: all of us? From every corner of
dialog: Europe, hundreds, thousands, would
dialog: rise to take our places. Even Nazis
dialog: can't kill that fast.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation
dialog: for eloquence which I can now
dialog: understand. But in one respect you
dialog: are mistaken. You said the enemies
dialog: of the Reich could all be replaced,
dialog: but there is one exception. No one
dialog: 65.
dialog: could take your place in the event
dialog: anything unfortunate should occur to
dialog: you while you were trying to escape.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: You won't dare to interfere with me
dialog: here. This is still unoccupied
dialog: France. Any violation of neutrality
dialog: would reflect on Captain Renault.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Monsieur, insofar as it is in my
dialog: power --
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: -- Thank you.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: By the way, Monsieur, last night
dialog: you evinced an interest in Signor
dialog: Ugarte.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: I believe you have a message for him?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Nothing important, but may I speak
dialog: to him now?
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: You would find the conversation a
dialog: trifle one-sided. Signor Ugarte
text: is dead.
text: Close-ups of Ilsa, then Laszlo, reveal their disappointment.
text: Strasser observes their reaction.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Oh.
text: Renault holds a report.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: I am making out the report now. We
dialog: haven't quite decided whether he
dialog: committed suicide or died trying to
dialog: escape.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: 66.
dialog: Are you quite finished with us?
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: For the time being.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Good day.
text: Renault rings a buzzer and the door is opened for them.
text: As Ilsa and Laszlo leave, an OFFICER comes in.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Undoubtedly their next step will be
dialog: to the black market.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Excuse me, Captain. Another visa
dialog: problem has come up.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Show her in.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Renault looks at himself in the mirror and straightens
dialog: his tie.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BLACK MARKET - DAY
text: The black market is a cluttered Arab street of bazaars,
text: shops and stalls. All kinds and races of people mill about
dialog: the merchandise which native dealers have on outdoor
dialog: display.
text: Both men and women are dressed in tropical clothes. The
text: canopies over the stalls give them some protection from the
text: scorching sun.
text: On the surface the atmosphere is merely languid, but
text: underneath lies the sinister workings of illicit trade.
text: A FRENCHMAN and a NATIVE huddle together and talk in low
dialog: tones.
speaker_heading: NATIVE
dialog: I'm sorry, Monsieur, we would have
dialog: to handle the police. This is a job
dialog: for Signor Ferrari.
speaker_heading: FRENCHMAN
dialog: 67.
dialog: Ferrari?
speaker_heading: NATIVE
dialog: It can be most helpful to know
dialog: Signor Ferrari. He pretty near
dialog: has a monopoly on the black market
dialog: here. You will find him over there
text: at the Blue Parrot.
speaker_heading: FRENCHMAN
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE BLUE PARROT - DAY
text: Outside the cafe, a blue parrot sits on a perch.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE BLUE PARROT - DAY
text: The cafe is much less pretentious than Rick's, but well
dialog: populated.
text: Rick enters and walks through the cafe toward Ferrari's
text: office just as Ferrari emerges with Jan and Annina, who look
text: very disappointed.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: There, don't be too downhearted.
dialog: Perhaps you can come to terms with
dialog: Captain Renault.
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: Thank you very much, Signor.
text: Jan leads Annina away.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Hello, Ferrari.
text: Signor Ferrari turns around. He's pleased to see Rick.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: Ah, good morning, Rick.
text: They shake hands.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I see the bus is in. I'll take my
dialog: shipment with me.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: He hails
dialog: 68.
dialog: No hurry. I'll have it sent over.
dialog: Have a drink with me.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I never drink in the morning. And
dialog: every time you send my shipment
dialog: over, it's always just a little bit
dialog: short.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: Carrying charges, my boy, carrying
dialog: charges. Here, sit down. There's
dialog: something I want to talk over with
dialog: you, anyhow.
text: a waiter.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: The bourbon.
text: (to Rick, sighing deeply)
dialog: The news about Ugarte upset me very
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You're a fat hypocrite. You don't
dialog: feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I
dialog: do.
text: He eyes Rick closely.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: Of course not. What upsets me is
text: the fact that Ugarte is dead and no
dialog: one knows where those letters of
dialog: transit are.
speaker_heading: RICK
text: Practically no one.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: If I could lay my hands on those
dialog: letters, I could make a fortune.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: So could I. And I'm a poor
dialog: businessman.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: I have a proposition for whoever has
dialog: those letters. I will handle the
dialog: entire transaction, get rid of the
dialog: letters, take all the risk, for a
dialog: small percentage.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: And the carrying charges?
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: Naturally there will be a few
dialog: incidental expenses. That is the
dialog: proposition I have for whoever has
dialog: those letters.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (dryly) .
dialog: I'll tell him when he comes in.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: Rick, I'll put my cards on the
dialog: table. I think you know where those
dialog: letters are.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, you're in good company. Renault
dialog: and Strasser probably think so, too.
text: Rick looks out of the window and sees Ilsa at the linen
text: bazaar, then Laszlo walking toward the cafe.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: That's why I came over here to give
dialog: them a chance to ransack my place.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into
dialog: your confidence. You need a
dialog: partner.
text: Rick isn't listening to him. He looks through the open
text: window in the direction of the linen bazaar.
text: Rick gets up.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Excuse me, I'll be getting back.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE BLUE PARROT - DAY

text: He stops and addresses Rick politely.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: RICK

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BLACK MARKET - DAY
text: At the linen stall, Ilsa examines a tablecloth which an Arab
text: vendor is endeavoring to sell. He holds a sign which reads
dialog: "700 francs."
speaker_heading: ARAB
dialog: You will not find a treasure like
dialog: this in all Morocco, Mademoiselle.
dialog: Only seven hundred francs.
text: Rick walks up behind Ilsa.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You're being cheated.
text: She looks briefly at Rick, then turns away. Her manner is
text: politely formal.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: It doesn't matter, thank you.
speaker_heading: ARAB
dialog: Ah, the lady is a friend of Rick's?
dialog: For friends of Rick we have a small
dialog: discount. Did I say seven hundred
dialog: francs? You can have it for two
dialog: hundred.
text: Reaching under the counter, he takes out a sign reading "200
text: francs", and replaces the other sign with it.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I'm sorry I was in no condition to
dialog: receive you when you called on me
dialog: last night.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: It doesn't matter.
speaker_heading: ARAB
dialog: Ah, for special friends of Rick's we
dialog: have a special discount. One
dialog: hundred francs.
text: He replaces the second sign with a third which reads "100
dialog: francs."
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Your story had me a little confused.
dialog: Or maybe it was the bourbon.
speaker_heading: ARAB
dialog: I have some tablecloths, some
dialog: napkins --
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: -- Thank you. I'm really not
dialog: interested.
speaker_heading: ARAB
dialog: Please, one minute. Wait!
text: The Arab hurriedly exits.
text: Ilsa pretends to examine the goods on the counter.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Why did you come back? To tell me
dialog: why you ran out on me at the railway
dialog: station?
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, you can tell me now. I'm
text: reasonably sober.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: I don't think I will, Rick.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Why not? After all, I got stuck
dialog: with a railway ticket. I think I'm
dialog: entitled to know.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Last night I saw what has happened
dialog: to you. The Rick I knew in Paris,
dialog: I could tell him. He'd understand.
dialog: But the one who looked at me with
dialog: such hatred... well, I'll be leaving
dialog: Casablanca soon and we'll never see
dialog: each other again. We knew very little
dialog: about each other when we were in love
dialog: in Paris. If we leave it that way,
dialog: maybe we'll remember those days and
dialog: not Casablanca, not last night.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: 72.
dialog: Did you run out on me because you
dialog: couldn't take it? Because you knew
dialog: what it would be like, hiding from
text: the police, running away all the
dialog: time?
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: You can believe that if you want to.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, I'm not running away any more.
dialog: I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's
dialog: true, but... walk up a flight. I'll
dialog: be expecting you.
text: Ilsa turns her head away.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: All the same, someday you'll lie to
dialog: Laszlo. You'll be there.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: No, Rick. No, you see, Victor
dialog: Laszlo is my husband... and was,
dialog: even when I knew you in Paris.
text: She walks away into the cafe as Rick stares after her in
text: stunned disbelief.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE BLUE PARROT - DAY

speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo
dialog: that, unfortunately, I am not able
dialog: to help him.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: You see, my dear, the word has gone
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: (to Ilsa)
dialog: As leader of all illegal activities
dialog: in Casablanca, I am an influential
dialog: and respected man. It would not be
dialog: worth my life to do anything for
dialog: Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are
dialog: 73.
dialog: a different matter.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Signor Ferrari thinks it might just
dialog: be possible to get an exit visa for
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: You mean for me to go on alone?
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: And only alone.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: I will stay here and keep on trying.
dialog: I'm sure in a little while --
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: -- We might as well be frank, Monsieur.
dialog: It will take a miracle to get you out
dialog: of Casablanca. And the Germans have
dialog: outlawed miracles.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: We are only interested in two visas,
dialog: Signor.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: No, Victor, no.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: You two will want to discuss this.
dialog: Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.
text: Ferrari gets to his feet and walks away.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here.
dialog: You must get to America. And
dialog: believe me, somehow I will get out
dialog: and join you.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: But, Victor, if the situation were
dialog: different, if I had to stay and
dialog: there were only a visa for one,
dialog: would you take it?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: (not very convincingly)
dialog: 74.
dialog: Yes, I would.
text: Ilsa smiles faintly. She doesn't believe it for evena
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Yes, I see. When I had trouble
dialog: getting out of Lille, why didn't you
dialog: leave me there? And when I was sick
dialog: in Marseilles and held you up for
dialog: two weeks and you were in danger
dialog: every minute of the time, why didn't
dialog: you leave me then?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: I meant to, but something always
dialog: held me up. I love you very much,
dialog: Ilsa.
text: She smiles again.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Your secret will be safe with me.
dialog: Ferrari is waiting for our answer.
text: At the bar Ferrari talks to a waiter.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: Not more than fifty francs though.
text: Ilsa and Laszlo walk up to him.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For
dialog: the present we'll go on looking for
dialog: two exit visas. Thank you very
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: Well, good luck. But be careful.
text: (a flick of his eyes
dialog: in the direction
dialog: of the bazaar)
dialog: You know you're being shadowed?
text: Laszlo glances in the direction of the bazaar.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
text: Of course. It becomes an instinct.
text: Ferrari looks shrewdly at Ilsa.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: I observe that you in one respect are
dialog: 75.
dialog: a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am
dialog: moved to make one more suggestion,
dialog: why, I do not know, because it cannot
dialog: possibly profit me, but, have you heard
dialog: about Signor Ugarte and the letters of
dialog: transit?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Yes, something.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: Those letters were not found on
dialog: Ugarte when they arrested him.
text: There's a moments pause as this sinks in.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Do you know where they are?
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will
dialog: venture to guess that Ugarte left
dialog: those letters with Monsieur Rick.
text: Ilsa's face darkens. Laszlo quietly observes.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Rick?
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: He is a difficult customer, that
dialog: Rick. One never knows what he'll do
dialog: or why. But it is worth a chance.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Thank you very much. Good day.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Goodbye, thank you for your coffee,
dialog: Signor. I shall miss that when we
dialog: leave Casablanca.
text: Ferrari bows.
speaker_heading: FERRARI

dialog: to make sure nothing is missing.
text: Sam and Corina play a number, accompanied by the orchestra.
dialog: Strasser
dialog: 77.
text: and his crowd enter the cafe and pass Rick's table.
text: Carl brings Rick a bottle and glass.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Monsieur Rick, you are getting to be
dialog: your best customer.
text: Carl leaves.
text: As Rick lights a cigarette, Renault shows up.
text: He pours
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with
dialog: you. Now you're beginning to live
text: like a Frenchman.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: That was some going-over your men
dialog: gave my place this afternoon. We
dialog: just barely got cleaned up in time
dialog: to open.
text: a drink for Renault.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't
dialog: find the letters here. But I told
dialog: my men to be especially destructive.
dialog: You know how that impresses Germans?
dialog: (taking a sip)
dialog: Rick, have you got these letters of
dialog: transit?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free
dialog: French?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Serves me right for asking a direct
text: question. The subject is closed.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, it looks like you're a little
dialog: late.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Huh?
text: Rick gazes at Yvonne and a GERMAN OFFICER approaching the bar.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Who knows? In her own way she may
text: constitute an entire second front.
dialog: I think it's time for me to flatter
dialog: Major Strasser a little. I'll see
dialog: you later, Rick.
text: Renault gets up and strolls away.
text: At the bar, Yvonne and the German officer place their
dialog: orders.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Sacha!
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: French seventy-fives.
text: Yvonne is somewhat drunk already.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Put up a whole row of them, Sacha...
dialog: starting here and ending here.
text: She indicates with her hand where she wants them.
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: We will begin with two.
text: A FRENCH OFFICER at the bar makes a remark to Yvonne.
speaker_heading: FRENCH OFFICER
dialog: (in French)
dialog: Say, you, you are not French to go
dialog: with a German like this!
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: (in French)
dialog: What are you butting in for?
speaker_heading: FRENCH OFFICER
dialog: (in French)
dialog: I am butting in --
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: (breaking in, in French)
dialog: -- It's none of your business!
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: (in French)
dialog: No, no, no, no! One minute!
dialog: (in English)
dialog: What did you say? Would you kindly
dialog: 79.
dialog: repeat it?
speaker_heading: FRENCH OFFICER
dialog: What I said is none of your business!
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: I will make it my business!
text: They begin to fight.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: (in French)
dialog: Stop! I beg of you! I beg of you,
dialog: stop!
text: There are exclamations from people nearby. German officers
text: at a nearby table rise, ready to join in. Rick walks up and
text: separates the two men.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (to the German)
dialog: I don't like disturbances in my
dialog: place. Either lay off politics or
dialog: get out.
speaker_heading: FRENCH OFFICER
dialog: (in French)
dialog: Dirty Boche. Someday we'll have our
dialog: revenge!
text: Renault, Strasser and the other officers sit down again.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: You see, Captain, the situation is
dialog: not as much under control as you
dialog: believe.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: My dear Major, we are trying to
dialog: cooperate with your government, but
dialog: we cannot regulate the feelings of
dialog: our people.
text: Strasser eyes him closely.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Captain Renault, are you entirely
dialog: certain which side you're on?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: I have no conviction, if that's what
dialog: you mean. I blow with the wind, and
dialog: the prevailing wind happens to be
dialog: from Vichy.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: And if it should change?
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Surely the Reich doesn't admit that
dialog: possibility?
text: Renault lights a cigarette and puffs away.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: We are concerned about more than
dialog: Casablanca. We know that every
dialog: French province in Africa is honey-
text: combed with traitors waiting for
dialog: their chance, waiting, perhaps,
dialog: for a leader.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: (casually)
dialog: A leader, like Laszlo?
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Uh, huh. I have been thinking.
dialog: It is too dangerous if we let him
dialog: go. It may be too dangerous if we
dialog: let him stay.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: (thoughtfully)
dialog: I see what you mean.
text: Carl, bottle in hand, approaches the table of a middle-aged
text: German couple, the LEUCHTAGS.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (in German)
dialog: I brought you the finest brandy.
dialog: Only the employees drink it here.
text: He pours a drink for each of them.
speaker_heading: MR. LEUCHTAG
dialog: Thank you, Carl.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (as he pours)
dialog: For Mrs. Leuchtag.
scene_heading: MRS. LEUCHTAG
dialog: Thank you, Carl.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: For Mr. Leuchtag.
speaker_heading: MR. LEUCHTAG
dialog: Carl, sit down. Have a brandy
dialog: with us.
scene_heading: MRS. LEUCHTAG
dialog: (beaming with happiness)
dialog: To celebrate our leaving for America
dialog: tomorrow.
text: Carl sits down.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Thank you very much. I thought
dialog: you would ask me, so I brought
text: the good brandy and a third glass.
text: He produces a glass from a back pocket.
scene_heading: MRS. LEUCHTAG
dialog: At last the day has came.
speaker_heading: MR. LEUCHTAG
dialog: Frau Leuchtag and I are speaking
text: nothing but English now.
scene_heading: MRS. LEUCHTAG
dialog: So we should feel at home ven ve
dialog: get to America.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: A very nice idea.
speaker_heading: MR. LEUCHTAG
dialog: (raising his glass)
dialog: To America.
text: Mrs. Leuchtag and Carl repeat "To America." They clink
text: glasses and drink.
speaker_heading: MR. LEUCHTAG
dialog: Liebchen, uh, sweetness heart,
dialog: what watch?
text: She glances at her wristwatch.
scene_heading: MRS. LEUCHTAG
dialog: Ten watch.
speaker_heading: MR. LEUCHTAG
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Such much?
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Er, you will get along beautifully
dialog: in America, huh.
text: Annina meets Renault in the hallway as she leaves the
dialog: gambling room,
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: How's lady luck treating you?
dialog: Aw, too bad. You'll find him
dialog: over there.
text: Annina sees Rick and goes to his table.
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: Monsieur Rick?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: Could I speak to you for just a
dialog: moment, please?
text: Rick looks at her.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: How did you get in here? You're
dialog: under age.
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: I came with Captain Renault.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (cynically)
dialog: I should have known.
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: My husband is with me, too.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: He is? Well, Captain Renault's
text: getting broadminded. Sit down.
dialog: Will you have a drink?
text: Annina shakes her head.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: No, of course not. Do you mind
dialog: if I do?
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: No.
dialog: 83.
text: Rick pours himself a drink
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is
dialog: Captain Renault?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Oh, he's just like any other man,
dialog: only more so.
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is
dialog: his word --
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: -- Now, just a minute. Who told you
dialog: to ask me that?
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: He did. Captain Renault did.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I thought so. Where's your husband?
speaker_heading: ANNINA
text: At the roulette table, trying to win
dialog: enough for our exit visa. Well of
dialog: course, he's losing.
text: Rick looks at her closely.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: How long have you been married?
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria.
dialog: Oh, things are very bad there,
dialog: Monsieur. A devil has the people
dialog: by the throat. So, Jan and I, we,
dialog: we do not want our children to grow
dialog: up in such a country.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (wearily)
dialog: So you decided to go to America.
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: Yes, but we have not much money,
dialog: and travelling is so expensive and
dialog: difficult. It was much more than
dialog: we thought to get here. And then
text: Captain Renault sees us and he is
dialog: so kind. He wants to help us.
dialog: There is
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yes, I'll bet.
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: He tells me he can give us an exit
dialog: visa, but we have no money.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Does he know that?
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: Oh, yes.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: And he is still willing to give you
dialog: a visa?
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: Yes, Monsieur.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: And you want to know --
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: -- Will he keep his word?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: He always has.
text: a silence. Annina is very disturbed.
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: Oh, Monsieur, you are a man. If
dialog: someone loved you very much, so that
dialog: your happiness was the only thing
dialog: that she wanted in the whole world,
dialog: but she did a bad thing to make
dialog: certain of it, could you forgive
dialog: her?
text: Rick stares off into space.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Nobody ever loved me that much.
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: And he never knew, and the girl kept
dialog: this bad thing locked in her heart?
dialog: That would be all right, wouldn't
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (harshly)
dialog: 85.
dialog: You want my advice?
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: Oh, yes, please.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Go back to Bulgaria.
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: Oh, but if you knew what it means to
dialog: us to leave Europe, to get to
dialog: America! Oh, but if Jan should find
dialog: out! He is such a boy. In many
dialog: ways I am so much older than he is.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca
dialog: has problems. Yours may work out.
dialog: You'll excuse me.
text: Rick abruptly rises.
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: (tonelessly)
dialog: Thank you, Monsieur.
text: He quickly goes off, leaving Annina alone at the table.
text: She remains seated, too demoralized to move.
text: While Rick checks the reservation list, Ilsa and Laszlo enter
dialog: the cafe.
text: In the background we hear Sam playing, ironically enough,
dialog: "It Had to Be You."
text: Rick greets Ilsa and Laszlo.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Good evening.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Good evening. You see, here we
dialog: are again.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I take that as a great compliment to
dialog: Sam.
dialog: (to Ilsa)
dialog: I suppose he means to you Paris of,
dialog: well, happier days.
text: Laszlo looks around.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: 86.
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: He does. Could we have a table
dialog: close to him?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
text: And as far away from Major Strasser
dialog: as possible.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, the geography may be a little
dialog: difficult to arrange.
text: Rick snaps his fingers for the headwaiter.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Paul! Table thirty!
speaker_heading: HEADWAITER
dialog: (to Ilsa and Laszlo)
dialog: Yes, sir. Right this way, if you
dialog: please.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (to Ilsa)
dialog: I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes
dialog: By." I believe that's your favorite
dialog: tune.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Thank you.
text: Rick walks over to Sam and whispers something to him. Sam
text: stops what he is playing and begins "As Time Goes By."
text: He shakes his head as Rick leaves.
text: A waiter appears at Ilsa and Laszlo's table.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Two cognacs, please.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - GAMBLING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Jan sits at the roulette table. He has only three chips
text: left and seems bewildered.
text: As Rick comes up the croupier speaks to Jan.
speaker_heading: CROUPIER
dialog: Do you wish to place another bet, sir?
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: No, no, I guess not.
dialog: 87.
text: Rick stands behind Jan.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (to Jan)
dialog: Have you tried twenty-two tonight?
dialog: I said, twenty-two.
text: Jan looks at Rick, then at the chips in his hand.
text: He paues, then puts the chips on twenty-two.
text: Rick and the croupier exchange looks. The croupier
text: understands what Rick wants him to do. He spins the wheel.
text: Carl follows the proceedings, fascinated.
text: The wheel stops spinning.
speaker_heading: CROUPIER
dialog: (in French)
text: Twenty-two, black, twenty-two.
text: A winner. Renault, at a nearby table, takes notice of what
text: is happening.
text: The croupier pushes a pile of chips onto twenty-two and Jan
text: reaches for it.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (not even looking at Jan)
dialog: Leave it there.
text: Jan hesitates, then withdraws his hands.
text: Carl continues to watch.
text: The wheel spins. Nobody speaks while it spins. It stops.
speaker_heading: CROUPIER
text: Twenty-two, black.
text: Another winner. The croupier shoves a pile of chips toward
dialog: Jan.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (to Jan)
dialog: Cash it in and don't come back.
text: Jan rises to go to the cashier.
text: A CUSTOMER complains to Carl.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: 88.
dialog: Say, are you sure this place is honest?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (fervently)
dialog: Honest! As honest as the day is long!
text: Meanwhile, Rick has walked over to the croupier.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: How we doing tonight?
speaker_heading: CROUPIER
dialog: Well, a couple of thousand less than
dialog: I thought there would be.
text: Rick smiles slightly and goes toward the door.
text: Annina runs up to him and hugs him.
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: Monsieur Rick, I --
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: -- He's just a lucky guy.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (solicitously)
dialog: Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup
dialog: of coffee?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: No thanks, Carl.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Monsieur Rick!
text: Renault, seeing that Jan has won, gets up from his table to
text: follow Rick. Jan and Annina stop him on the way.
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: Captain Renault, may I --
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: -- Oh, not here, please. Come to
dialog: my office in the morning. We'll
dialog: do everything business-like.
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: We'll be there at six.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: I'll be there at ten. I am very
dialog: happy for both of you. Still, it's
dialog: very strange that you won.
dialog: 89.
text: He looks over and sees Rick.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Well, maybe not so strange. I'll
dialog: see you in the morning.
speaker_heading: ANNINA
dialog: Thank you so much, Captain Renault.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
text: At the bar, Carl whispers in Sacha's ear. Sacha says "No!"
text: and runs to Rick.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.
text: He kisses Rick on both cheeks.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Go away, you crazy Russian!
text: Carl pours a brandy for Rick.
text: Pretending not to do so, Rick glances in Ilsa's direction.
text: Renault comes up to him.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: As I suspected, you're a rank
dialog: sentimentalist.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yeah? Why?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: (chidingly)
dialog: Why do you interfere with my little
dialog: romances?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Put it down as a gesture to love.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: (good-naturedly)
dialog: Well, I forgive you this time.
dialog: But I'll be in tomorrow night
text: with a breathtaking blonde, and
dialog: it will make me very happy if
dialog: she loses. Uh huh!
text: He smiles and walks away. Laszlo comes up to Rick.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could
dialog: talk to you?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Go ahead.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Well, isn't there some other place?
dialog: It's rather confidential, what I
dialog: have to say.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: My office.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Right.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Rick and Laszlo sit and discuss Laszlo's dilemma.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: You must know it's very important I
dialog: get out of Casablanca. It's my
dialog: privilege to be one of the leaders
dialog: of a great movement. You know what
dialog: I have been doing. You know what it
dialog: means to the work, to the lives of
dialog: thousands and thousands of people
dialog: that I be free to reach America and
dialog: continue my work.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I'm not interested in politics. The
dialog: problems of the world are not in my
dialog: department. I'm a saloon keeper.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: My friends in the underground tell
dialog: me that you have quite a record.
dialog: You ran guns to Ethiopia. You
dialog: fought against the fascists in
dialog: Spain.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: What of it?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Isn't it strange that you always
dialog: 91.
dialog: happened to be fighting on the side
dialog: of the underdog?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yes. I found that a very expensive
dialog: hobby, too. But then I never was
text: much of a businessman.
text: Rick gets up, as does Laszlo.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Are you enough of a businessman to
dialog: appreciate an offer of a hundred
dialog: thousand francs?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: My friend, you could make it a
dialog: million francs, or three, my
dialog: answer would still be the same.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: There must be some reason why you
dialog: won't let me have them.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: There is. I suggest that you ask
dialog: your wife.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I said, ask your wife.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: My wife?
text: Laszlo looks at him, puzzled.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yes.
text: Rick and Laszlo hear MALE VOICES singing downstairs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 92.
text: A group of German officers stand around the piano singing
dialog: the "Wacht am Rhein."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - BALCONY - NIGHT
text: Rick stands at the balcony outside his office and watches
text: the Germans below.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
text: At the bar, Renault watches with raised eyebrow.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - BALCONY - NIGHT
text: Laszlo's lips are very tight as he listens to the song.
text: He starts down the step.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
text: Laszlo passes the table where Ilsa sits and goes straight
text: to the orchestra.
text: Yvonne, sitting at a table with her German officer, stares
text: down into her drink.
text: Laszlo speaks to the orchestra.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Play the Marseillaise! Play it!
text: Members of the orchestra glance toward the steps, toward Rick,
text: who nods to them.
text: Laszlo and Corina sing as they start to play. Strasser
text: conducts the German singing in an attempt to drown out the
dialog: competition.
text: People in the cafe begin to sing the "Marseillaise."
text: After a while, Strasser and his officers give up and sit
text: down. The "Marseillaise" continues, however.
text: Yvonne jumps up and sings with tears in her eyes.
text: Ilsa, overcome with emotion, looks proudly at Laszlo, who
text: sings with passion.
dialog: 93.
text: Finally the whole cafe stands, singing, their faces
text: aglow. The song finishes on a high, triumphant note.
text: Yvonne's face is exalted. She deliberately faces the alcove
text: where the Germans are watching. She SHOUTS at the top of
dialog: her lungs.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Vive La France! Vive la democracie!
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Vive La France! Vive la democracie!
text: People clap and cheer.
text: Strasser is very angry. He strides across the floor toward
text: Renault who is standing at the bar.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: You see what I mean? If Laszlo's
dialog: presence in a cafe can inspire this
dialog: unfortunate demonstration, what more
dialog: will his presence in Casablanca
dialog: bring on? I advise that this place
dialog: be shut up at once.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: (innocently)
dialog: But everybody's having such a good
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Yes, much too good a time. The
dialog: place is to be closed.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: But I have no excuse to close it.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: (snapping)
dialog: Find one.
text: Several French officers surround Laszlo, offering him a drink.
text: Renault thinks a moment, then blows a loud BLAST on his
text: whistle. The room grows quiet, all eyes turn toward
dialog: Renault.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: Everybody is to leave here
dialog: immediately! This cafe is
dialog: closed until further notice!
text: An angry murmur starts among the crowd.
text: begin to leave.
dialog: Clear the room at once!
text: Rick comes quickly up to Renault.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: How can you close me up? On what
dialog: grounds?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: I am shocked, shocked to find that
dialog: gambling is going on in here!
text: This display of nerve leaves Rick at a loss.
text: comes out of the gambling room and up to Renault. He hands
text: him a roll of bills.
speaker_heading: CROUPIER
dialog: Your winnings, sir.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Oh. Thank you very much.
text: He turns to the crowd again.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Everybody out at once!
text: As the cafe empties, Strasser approaches Ilsa.
text: is abrupt but cordial.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Mademoiselle, after this disturbance
dialog: it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in
dialog: Casablanca.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: This morning you implied it was not
dialog: safe for him to leave Casablanca.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: That is also true, except for one
dialog: destination, to return to occupied
dialog: France.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Occupied France?
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: 94.
dialog: People get up and
dialog: The croupier
dialog: His manner
dialog: 95.
dialog: (with intensity)
dialog: What value is that? You may recall
dialog: what German guarantees have been
dialog: worth in the past.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: There are only two other alternatives
dialog: for him.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: What are they?
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: It is possible the French authorities
dialog: will find a reason to put him in the
dialog: concentration camp here.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: And the other alternative?
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you
dialog: have already observed that in
dialog: Casablanca, human life is cheap.
dialog: Good night, Mademoiselle.
text: She looks at him, understanding what he means.
text: He bows and exits as Laszlo arrives at the table.
text: They start out of the cafe.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: What happened with Rick?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: We'll discuss it later.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Ilsa and Laszlo walk to their room.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Laszlo switches on the light as they enter. While Ilsa
text: takes off some jewelry he walks to the window and peers
text: out into the darkeness. Below and across the street, a
text: man stands under an arch. Laszlo watches him, then draws
text: down the shade.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Our faithful friend is still there.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Victor, please, don't go to the
dialog: underground meeting tonight.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: (soberly)
dialog: I must. Besides, it isn't often that
text: a man has a chance to display heroics
text: before his wife.
text: He crosses to a table, takes a cigarette from a box, and
text: strikes a match.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Don't joke. After Major Strasser's
dialog: warning tonight, I am frightened.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: To tell you the truth, I am frightened
dialog: too. Shall I remain here in our hotel
dialog: room hiding, or shall I carry on the
dialog: best I can?
text: He lights the cigarette.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on.
dialog: Victor, why don't you tell me about
dialog: Rick? What did you find out?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
text: Apparently he has the letters.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: But no intention of selling them.
dialog: One would think if sentiment
dialog: wouldn't persuade him, money would.
text: Ilsa is now noticeably uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Did he give any reason?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: He suggested I ask you.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Ask me?
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I
dialog: don't know why he said that.
text: Laszlo turns off the light. Ilsa walks over to the couch and
text: sits down.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Well, our friend outside will think
dialog: we've retired by now. I'll be going
text: in a few minutes.
text: He sits down on the couch next to her. A silence falls
text: between them. It grows strained. Finally...
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Ilsa, I --
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: -- Yes?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: When I was in the concentration camp,
dialog: were you lonely in Paris?
text: Ilsa still cannot look at him.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Yes, Victor, I was.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: (sympathetically)
dialog: I know how it is to be lonely.
dialog: (very quietly)
dialog: Is there anything you wish to tell me?
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: (speaking low)
dialog: No, Victor, there isn't.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: I love you very much, my dear.
text: Ilsa finally turns to look at Laszlo.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever
dialog: I do, will you believe that I, that --
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: -- You don't even have to say it.
dialog: I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
dialog: 98.
text: He bends down and kisses her cheek.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Goodnight.
text: She watches him go.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Victor!
text: She gets up and follows him to the door. He opens it. In
text: the slit of light from the hall we see Ilsa's face, now
text: strained and worried. She hesitates for a moment, then...
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Be careful.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Of course, I'll be careful.
text: He kisses her on the cheek and goes out the door. She stands
text: there for a few seconds, then crosses to look out of the
dialog: window.
text: The figure in the archway is gone. She sees Victor walking
text: down the street and closes the blind again. Ilsa gets a
text: cloak from the bedroom, and leaves the hotel room.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
text: Rick and Carl sit by the bar and look over ledgers. Carl
text: is busy figuring. He looks up at Rick.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Well, you are in pretty good shape,
dialog: Herr Rick.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: How long can I afford to stay closed?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has
dialog: worked before. In the meantime,
dialog: everybody stays on salary.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha
dialog: will be happy to hear it. I owe
dialog: him money.
dialog: 99.
text: Carl laughs.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Now you finish locking up, will you,
dialog: Carl?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I will. Then I am going to the
dialog: meeting of the --
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: -- Don't tell me where you're going.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I won't.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Goodnight.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
text: Rick walks up the stairs to his apartment.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Rick opens the door and goes inside the dark room. Light
text: from the hall reveals a figure by the window. He lights a
text: small lamp. Ilsa faces him, her face white but determined.
text: Rick pauses for a moment in astonishment.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: How did you get in?
speaker_heading: ILSA
text: The stairs from the street.
text: Ilsa comes over to meet him.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I told you this morning you'd come
text: around, but this is a little ahead
dialog: of schedule. Well, won't you sit
dialog: down?
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Richard, I had to see you.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You use "Richard" again? We're back
dialog: He walks
dialog: 100.
dialog: in Paris.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Your unexpected visit isn't connected
dialog: by any chance with the letters of
dialog: transit? It seems that as long as I
dialog: have those letters I'll never be lonely.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: You can ask any price you want, but
dialog: you must give me those letters.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I went through all that with your
dialog: husband. It's no deal.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: I know how you feel about me, but
dialog: I'm asking you to put your feelings
dialog: aside for something more important.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Do I have to hear again what a great
dialog: man your husband is? What an
dialog: important cause he's fighting for?
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: It was your cause, too. In your own
dialog: way, you were fighting for the same
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I'm not fighting for anything
dialog: anymore, except myself. I'm the
dialog: only cause I'm interested in.
text: over to the window and Ilsa follows.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Richard, Richard, we loved each
dialog: other once. If those days meant
dialog: anything at all to you --
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (interrupting, harshly)
dialog: -- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I
dialog: were you. It's poor salesmanship.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Please. Please listen to me. If
dialog: you knew what really happened, if
dialog: 101.
dialog: you only knew the truth --
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (cutting in)
dialog: -- I wouldn't believe you, no matter
dialog: what you told me. You'd say anything
dialog: now to get what you want.
text: Rick walks over to a table and opens a cigarette box, but
dialog: finds it
text: empty.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: You want to feel sorry for yourself,
dialog: don't you? With so much at stake,
dialog: all you can think of is your own
dialog: feelings. One woman has hurt you,
dialog: and you take revenge on the rest of
dialog: the world. You're a, you're a coward,
text: and a weakling.
text: There are tears in her eyes now.
dialog: He turns
dialog: He stops
text: her hand.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm
dialog: sorry, but, but you, you are our
dialog: last hope. If you don't help us,
dialog: Victor Laszlo will die in
dialog: Casablanca.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: What of it? I'm going to die in
dialog: Casablanca. It's a good spot for
dialog: it.
text: away to light a cigarette, then back to Ilsa.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Now if you --
text: short as he sees Ilsa holding a small revolver in
text: It's pointed directly at him.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: -- All right. I tried to reason
dialog: with you. I tried everything. Now
dialog: I want those letters. Get them for
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I don't have to. I've got them
dialog: right here.
speaker_heading: ILSA
text: Put them on the table.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: For the last time, put them on the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: If Laszlo and the cause mean so much
dialog: to you, you won't stop at anything.
dialog: All right, I'll make it easier for
dialog: you.
text: He moves closer to her.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Go ahead and shoot. You'll be doing
dialog: me a favor.
text: Her hand drops down, and there are tears in her eyes again.
text: She turns and walks away from him.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Richard, I tried to stay away. I
dialog: thought I would never see you again,
dialog: that you were out of my life.
text: Rick follows her and takes her in his arms. He presses her
text: tight to him.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: The day you left, if you knew what
dialog: I went through! If you knew how
dialog: much I loved you, how much I still
dialog: love you!
text: Rick kisses her passionately. She is lost in his embrace.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - APARTMENT - LATER
text: From his window, Rick watches the revolving beacon light at
dialog: the airport.
text: Ilsa sits on the couch. On a table before her rests a bottle
text: of champagne along with two half-filled glasses.
text: Rick walks over to her.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: 103.
dialog: And then?
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: It wasn't long after we were married
dialog: that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.
dialog: They needed him in Prague, but there
text: the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just
text: a two-line item in the paper: "Victor
dialog: Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concen-
dialog: tration camp." I was frantic. For
dialog: months I tried to get word. Then it
text: came. He was dead, shot trying to
dialog: escape. I was lonely. I had nothing.
dialog: Not even hope. Then I met you.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Why weren't you honest with me? Why
dialog: did you keep your marriage a secret?
text: Rick sits down with Ilsa.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard.
dialog: Victor wanted it that way. Not
dialog: even our closest friends knew about
dialog: our marriage. That was his way of
dialog: protecting me. I knew so much about
dialog: his work, and if the Gestapo found
dialog: out I was his wife it would be
dialog: dangerous for me and for those
dialog: working with me.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: When did you first find out he was
dialog: alive?
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Just before you and I were to leave
text: Paris together. A friend came and
dialog: told me that Victor was alive. They
text: were hiding him in a freight car on
dialog: the outskirts of Paris. He was sick,
dialog: he needed me. I wanted to tell you,
dialog: but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew
dialog: you wouldn't have left Paris, and the
dialog: Gestapo would have caught you. Sol...
dialog: well, well, you know the rest.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Huh. But it's still a story without
dialog: an ending. What about now?
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Now? I don't know. I know that
dialog: 104.
dialog: I'll never have the strength to
dialog: leave you again.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: And Laszlo?
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Oh, you'll help him now, Richard,
dialog: won't you? You'll see that he gets
dialog: out? Then he'll have his work, all
dialog: that he's been living for.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: All except one. He won't have you.
text: Ilsa puts her head on Rick's shoulder.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: I can't fight it anymore. I ran
dialog: away from you once. I can't do
dialog: it again. Oh, I don't know what's
dialog: right any longer. You'll have to
dialog: think for both of us, for all of us.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: All right, I will. Here's looking
dialog: at you, kid.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: I wish I didn't love you so much.
text: She snuggles closer to Rick.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RICK'S CAFE - NIGHT
text: Laszlo and Carl make their way through the darkness toward
text: a side entance of Rick's. They run inside the entryway.
text: The headlights of a speeding police car sweep toward them.
text: They flatten themselves against a wall to avoid detection.
text: The lights move past them.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I think we lost them.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Yes. I'm afraid they caught some
dialog: of the others.
speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Come inside. I will help you. Come

speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Thank you.
text: Carl goes behind the bar.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I will give you some water.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT./EXT. RICK'S CAFE - APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Rick and Ilsa hear voices below. Rick crosses to the door.
text: He opens it just enough to see below, and turns off the light.
text: Ilsa stands just in back of him. She makes a move as if
text: to go out to the balcony but Rick's pushes her back. She
text: withdraws behind the door.
text: Rick walks out to the balcony railing.
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - BALCONY/MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
text: Rick sees Carl attending to Laszlo, who appears to be injured.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Carl, what happened?
text: Both Carl and Laszlo look up.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (excitedly)
dialog: The police break up our meeting.
dialog: Herr Rick! We escaped in the
dialog: last moment.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Come up here a minute.
text: Carl looks up wonderingly, then starts toward the stairway.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yes, I come.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I want you to turn out the light in
text: the rear entrance. It might attract
dialog: the police.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: But Sacha always puts out that
dialog: light --
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: -- Tonight he forgot.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yes, I come, I will do it.
text: Carl climbs the stairs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Carl enters Rick's apartment and sees Ilsa. He looks at
text: Rick and says nothing.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (in a low voice)
dialog: I want you to take Miss Lund home.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
text: Rick comes down the stairs. Laszlo wraps one of the small
text: bar towels around his cut wrist. Rick looks questioningly at
text: the injured hand.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: It's nothing. Just a little cut.
dialog: We had to get through a window.
text: Rick walks to the bar, picks up a bottle, and pours a drink.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, this might come in handy.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Had a close one, eh?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Yes, rather.
text: Laszlo takes a drink.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Don't you sometimes wonder if it's
dialog: worth all this? I mean what you're
dialog: fighting for?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: We might as well question why we
dialog: breathe. If we stop breathing,
dialog: we'll die. If we stop fighting
dialog: our enemies, the world will die.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: What of it? Then it'll be out of
dialog: it's misery.
text: Rick reaches in his jacket for his cigarette case, opens it,
text: and takes out a cigarette.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: You know how you sound, Monsieur
text: Blaine? Like a man who's trying to
dialog: convince himself of something he
dialog: doesn't believe in his heart. Each
dialog: of us has a destiny, for good or for
dialog: evil.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yes, I get the point.
text: Rick lights his cigarette.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: I wonder if you do. I wonder if you
dialog: know that you're trying to escape
dialog: from yourself and that you'll never
dialog: succeed.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You seem to know all about my destiny.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: I know a good deal more about you
dialog: than you suspect. I know, for
dialog: instance, that you are in love with
dialog: a woman. It is perhaps strange that
dialog: we both should be in love with the
dialog: He looks
dialog: Suddenly
dialog: 108.
dialog: same woman. The first evening I
dialog: came here in this cafe, I knew there
dialog: was something between you and Ilsa.
dialog: Since no one is to blame, I, I
dialog: demand no explanation. I ask only
dialog: one thing. You won't give me the
dialog: letters of transit. All right. But
dialog: I want my wife to be safe. I ask
dialog: you as a favor to use the letters
dialog: to take her away from Casablanca.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You love her that much?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Apparently you think of me only as
dialog: the leader of a cause. Well, I am
dialog: also a human being.
text: away for a moment.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Yes, I love her that much.
text: there is a CRASH at the door of the cafe, followed
text: by the forced entry of several gendarmes. A French officer
dialog: walks in
text: and addresses Laszlo.
speaker_heading: FRENCH OFFICER
dialog: Mr. Laszlo?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: FRENCH OFFICER
dialog: You will come with us. We have a
dialog: warrant for your arrest.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: On what charge?
speaker_heading: FRENCH OFFICER
dialog: Captain Renault will discuss that
dialog: with you later.
speaker_heading: RICK
text: It seems that destiny has taken a
dialog: hand.
text: Laszlo looks for a moment at Rick, then in dignified silence
text: crosses to the officer. Together they walk toward the door.
text: Rick's eyes follow them, but his expression reveals nothing
dialog: of his feelings.
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RENAULT'S OFFICE - MORNING
dialog: Renault
dialog: fingers
dialog: Renault
dialog: and the
text: sits at his desk and smokes while Rick nervously
text: his hat. They're interrupted by an orderly.
text: hands some forms to the orderly, who then exits,
text: conversation continues.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: But you haven't any actual proof,
dialog: and you know it. This isn't Germany
dialog: or occupied France. All you can do
dialog: is fine him a few thousand francs
dialog: and give him thirty days. You might
dialog: as well let him go now.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too
text: interested in what happens to Laszlo.
dialog: If by any chance you were to help him
dialog: escape --
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: -- What makes you think I'd stick
dialog: my neck out for Laszlo?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Because one, you've bet ten thousand
dialog: francs he'd escape. Two, you have
dialog: the letters of transit, now don't
dialog: bother to deny it. And, well, you
dialog: might do it simply because you don't
dialog: like Strasser's looks. As a matter
dialog: of fact, I don't like him either.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, they're all excellent reasons.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Don't count too much on my friendship,
dialog: Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless.
dialog: Besides, I might lose ten thousand
dialog: francs.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You're not very subtle, but you are
dialog: effective. I, I get the point. Yes,
dialog: I have the letters, but I intend using
dialog: them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca
text: on tonight's plane, the last plane.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: 110.
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: And I'm taking a friend with me.
dialog: One you'll appreciate.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: What friend?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Ilsa Lund.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: That ought to put your mind to rest
dialog: about my helping Laszlo escape. The
dialog: last man I want to see in America.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: You didn't come here to tell me
dialog: this. You have the letters of
dialog: transit. You can fill in your
dialog: name and hers and leave any time
dialog: you please. Why are you interested
dialog: in what happens to Laszlo?
text: Renault gets out of his chair and crosses to the front of
text: his desk.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I'm not. But I am interested in
dialog: what happens to Ilsa and me. We
dialog: have a legal right to go, that's
dialog: true. But people have been held
dialog: in Casablanca in spite of their
dialog: legal rights.
text: Renault retrieves a fresh cigarette from a box on his desk.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: What makes you think we want to hold
dialog: you?
text: Renault chain-lights his new cigarette with the old one.
speaker_heading: RICK
text: Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably
dialog: knows things that Strasser would
dialog: like to know. Louis, I'll make a
dialog: deal with you. Instead of this
dialog: petty charge you have against him,
dialog: you can get something really big,
dialog: something that would chuck him in a
dialog: concentration camp for years. That
dialog: would be quite a feather in your
dialog: cap, wouldn't it?
dialog: 141.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: It certainly would. Germany...
dialog: Vichy would be very grateful.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Then release him. You be at
dialog: my place a half hour before
text: the plane leaves.
text: Renault sits back down in his chair.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I'll arrange to have Laszlo come
dialog: there to pick up the letters of
dialog: transit, and that'll give you the
dialog: criminal grounds on which to make
dialog: the arrest. You get him, and we
dialog: get away. To the Germans that last
dialog: will be just a minor annoyance.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: There's still something about this
dialog: business I don't quite understand.
dialog: Miss Lund, she's very beautiful,
dialog: yes, but you were never interested
dialog: in any woman.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, she isn't just any woman.
text: Rick stares at the floor, then looks back up at Renault.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: I see. How do I know you'll keep
dialog: your end of the bargain?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I'll make the arrangements right now
text: with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Ricky, I'm going to miss you.
dialog: Apparently you're the only one
dialog: in Casablanca who has even less
dialog: scruples than I.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Oh, thanks.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Go ahead, Ricky.
dialog: 112.
text: Renault presses a button on his desk, triggering a BUZZER.
text: The door to Renault's office opens. Rick rises to go.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: And by the way, call off your watchdogs
dialog: when you let him go. I don't want them
dialog: around this afternoon. I'm taking no
dialog: chances, Louis, not even with you.

dialog: our handshake good enough?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: It's certainly not good enough. But
dialog: since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to

text: Ferrari pours a cup for Rick, who takes a sip.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go
dialog: to America! You're a lucky man.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's
dialog: always been that he gets twenty-five
dialog: percent of the profits. That still
dialog: goes.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets
dialog: ten percent. But he's worth twenty-
dialog: five.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they
dialog: stay with the place, or I don't sell.
speaker_heading: FERRARI
dialog: Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't
dialog: be Rick's without them.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, so long.
text: Rick gets up, followed by Ferrari. They shake hands to seal

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Don't forget, you owe Rick's a
dialog: hundred cartons of American

speaker_heading: RICK

dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
text: Rick opens the door. Ilsa rushes in. Her intensity reveals
text: the strain she is under. Rick grabs her by both arms and
text: pulls her close.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving
dialog: 115.
dialog: with him. Haven't you told him?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: No, not yet.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: But it's all right, isn't it? You
dialog: were able to arrange everything?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Everything is quite all right.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Oh, Rick!
text: She looks at him with a vaguely questioning look.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: We'll tell him at the airport. The
dialog: less time to think, the easier for
dialog: all of us. Please trust me.
text: Ilsa pauses and looks at Rick, unsure for a moment.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Yes, I will.
text: Laszlo comes in and closes the door behind himself.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to
dialog: thank you.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Oh, save it. We've still lots of
dialog: things to do.
text: They all walk towards the bar. Laszlo deposits his hat ona
text: a nearby table.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Renault opens the office door and peers down at the
dialog: proceedings.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Keep it. You'll need it in America.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: But we made a deal.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (cutting him short)
dialog: Oh, never mind about that. You
dialog: won't have any trouble in Lisbon,
dialog: will you?
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: No. It's all arranged.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Good. I've got the letters right
text: here, all made out in blank.
text: He takes out the letters.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: All you have to do is fill in the
dialog: signatures.
text: He hands them to Laszlo, who takes them gratefully.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Victor Laszlo!
text: All three hear footsteps and turn to see Renault walking
text: towards them from the bottom of the stairs.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Victor Laszlo, you are under arrest...
text: (as he walks toward them)
dialog: on a charge of accessory to the
dialog: murder of the couriers from whom
dialog: these letters were stolen.
text: Ilsa and Laszlo are both caught completely off guard. They
text: turn towards Rick, bewildered. Horror is in Ilsa's eyes.
text: Renault takes the letters.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Oh, you are surprised about my
dialog: friend Ricky?
text: Obviously the situation delights Renault. He smiles
text: as he turns toward Rick.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: The explanation is quite simple.
dialog: 117.
text: Love, it seems, has triumphed over
dialog: virtue. Thank --
text: Suddenly the smile fades. In Rick's hand is a gun, which
text: he levels at Renault.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: -- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going
dialog: to be arrested. Not for a while
dialog: yet.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Have you taken leave of your senses?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I have. Sit down over there.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Put that gun down.
text: Renault then walks toward Rick. Rick puts out his arm
dialog: to stop him.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Louis, I wouldn't like to shoot you,
dialog: but I will, if you take one more
dialog: step.
text: Renault halts for a moment and studies Rick.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Under the circumstances, I will sit
dialog: down.
text: He walks to a table and sits.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: Keep your hands on the table.
text: He takes out a cigarette case.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: I suppose you know what you're doing,
dialog: but I wonder if you realize what this
dialog: means?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I do. We've got plenty of time to
dialog: discuss that later.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Call off your watch-dogs you said.
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Just the same, you call the airport
dialog: and let me hear you tell them. And
dialog: remember, this gun's pointed right
dialog: at your heart.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: That is my least vulnerable spot.
text: As Renault picks up the phone and dials, Rick takes back
dialog: the letters.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello, is this the airport? This is
dialog: Captain Renault speaking. There'll
dialog: be two letters of transit for the
dialog: Lisbon plane. There's to be no
dialog: trouble about them. Good.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: Strasser is on the phone.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Hello? Hello?
text: He hangs up the receiver and presses a BUZZER on his desk.
text: An officer quickly enters.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: (to officer)
dialog: My car, quickly!
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: (saluting)
dialog: Zu Befehl, Herr Major.
text: The officer exits and Strasser resumes on the telephone.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: This is Major Strasser. Have a
dialog: squad of police meet me at the
dialog: airport at once. At once! Do
dialog: you hear?
text: He hangs up the receiver and, grabbing for his cap,
text: hurriedly exits.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT./EXT. AIRPORT HANGAR - NIGHT
text: A uniformed ORDERLY uses a telephone near the hangar door.
text: On the airfield a transport plane is being readied.
speaker_heading: ORDERLY
dialog: Hello. Hello, radio tower? Lisbon
text: plane taking off in ten minutes.
dialog: East runway. Visibility: one and
text: one half miles. Light ground fog.
text: Depth of fog: approximately 500.
dialog: Ceiling: unlimited. Thank you.
text: He hangs up and moves to a car that has just pulled up
text: outside the hangar.
text: Renault gets out while the orderly stands at attention.
text: He's closely followed by Rick, right hand in the pocket
text: of his trench coat, covering Renault with a gun.
text: Laszlo and Ilsa emerge from the rear of the car.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (indicating the orderly)
dialog: Louis, have your man go with Mr.
text: Laszlo and take care of his luggage.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: (bowing ironically)
dialog: Certainly Rick, anything you say.
dialog: (to orderly)
dialog: Find Mr. Laszlo's luggage and put it
text: it on the plane.
speaker_heading: ORDERLY
dialog: Yes, sir. This way please.
text: The orderly escorts Laszlo off in the direction of the plane.
text: Rick takes the letters of transit out of his pocket and
text: hands them to Renault, who turns and walks toward the hangar.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: If you don't mind, you fill in the
dialog: names. That will make it even more
dialog: official.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: You think of everything, don't you?
dialog: 120.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor
dialog: Laszlo.
text: Renault stops dead in his tracks, and turns around. Both
text: Ilsa and Renault look at Rick with astonishment.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: But why my name, Richard?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Because you're getting on that plane.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: (confused)
dialog: I don't understand. What about you?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I'm staying here with him 'til the
text: plane gets safely away.
text: Rick's intention suddenly dawns on Ilsa.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: No, Richard, no. What has happened
dialog: to you? Last night we said --
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: -- Last night we said a great many
dialog: things. You said I was to do the
dialog: thinking for both of us. Well, I've
dialog: done a lot of it since then and it
dialog: all adds up to one thing. You're
dialog: getting on that plane with Victor
dialog: where you belong.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: (protesting)
dialog: But Richard, no, I, I --
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: -- You've got to listen to me. Do
dialog: you have any idea what you'd have to
dialog: look forward to if you stayed here?
dialog: Nine chances out of ten we'd both
text: wind up in a concentration camp.
dialog: Isn't that true, Louis?
text: Renault countersigns the papers.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: I'm afraid Major Strasser would
dialog: 121.
dialog: insist.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: You're saying this only to make me go.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I'm saying it because it's true.
dialog: Inside of us we both know you
dialog: belong with Victor. You're part
dialog: of his work, the thing that keeps
dialog: him going. If that plane leaves
dialog: the ground and you're not with
dialog: him, you'll regret it.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
dialog: but soon, and for the rest of your
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: But what about us?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: We'll always have Paris. We didn't
dialog: have, we'd lost it, until you came
dialog: to Casablanca. We got it back last
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: And I said I would never leave you.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: And you never will. But I've got
dialog: a job to do, too. Where I'm going
dialog: you can't follow. what I've got to
dialog: do you can't be any part of. Ilsa,
dialog: I'm no good at being noble, but it
dialog: doesn't take much to see that the
dialog: problems of three little people
dialog: don't amount to a hill of beans in
dialog: this crazy world. Someday you'll
dialog: understand that. Now, now...
text: Ilsa's eyes well up with tears. Rick puts his hand to her
text: chin and raises her face to meet his own.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Here's looking at you, kid.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 122.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
text: Major Strasser drives at break-neck speed towards the airport.
text: He HONKS his horn furiously.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT./EXT. AIRPORT HANGAR - NIGHT
text: Laszlo returns. Rick walks into the hangar and Renault
text: hands him the letters. He walks back out to Laszlo.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Everything in order?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: All except one thing. There's
dialog: something you should know before
dialog: you leave.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: (sensing what is coming)
dialog: Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to
dialog: explain anything.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I'm going to anyway, because it may
dialog: make a difference to you later on.
dialog: You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: But you didn't know she was at my
dialog: place last night when you were.
dialog: She came there for the letters of
dialog: transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: (facing Laszlo)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (forcefully)
dialog: She tried everything to get them,
dialog: and nothing worked. She did her
dialog: best to convince me that she was
dialog: still in love with me, but that was
dialog: all over long ago. For your sake,
dialog: she pretended it wasn't, and I let
dialog: her pretend.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: 123.
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Here it is.
text: Rick hands the letters to Laszlo.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Thanks. I appreciate it.
text: Laszlo extends his hand to Rick, who grasps it firmly.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: And welcome back to the fight. This
dialog: time I know our side will win.
text: On the airfield the airplane engine TURNS OVER and the
text: propellers start turning. They all turn to see the plane
text: readying for take-off.
text: Ilsa looks at Rick and he returns her stare with a blank
text: expression. He then glances at Laszlo, as does Ilsa.
text: Then Laszlo breaks the silence.
speaker_heading: LASZLO
dialog: Are you ready Ilsa?
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Yes, I'm ready.
dialog: (to Rick)
dialog: Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You better hurry, or you'll miss
dialog: that plane.
text: Rick watches as Ilsa and Laszlo walk very deliberately
text: towards the plane.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Well I was right. You area
dialog: sentimentalist.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Stay where you are. I don't know
dialog: what you're talking about.
text: Rick puts a cigarette in his mouth.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: What you just did for Laszlo, and
dialog: that fairy tale that you invented to
dialog: send Ilsa away with him. I knowa
dialog: 124.
dialog: little about women, my friend. She
dialog: went, but she knew you were lying.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: I suppose you know this isn't going
dialog: to be pleasant for either of us,
dialog: especially for you. I'll have to
dialog: arrest you of course.
speaker_heading: RICK
text: As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
text: The door to the plane is closed by an attendant and it
text: slowly taxies down the field.
text: Suddenly a speeding car comes to a stop outside the hangar.
text: Strasser alights from the car and runs toward Renault.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: What is the meaning of that phone
dialog: call?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
text: Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
text: Renault nods toward the field. Strasser turns to see the
text: plane taxiing towards the runway.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Why do you stand here? Why don't
dialog: you stop him?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Ask Monsieur Rick.
text: Strasser looks briefly at Rick, then makes a step towards
text: the telephone just inside the hangar door.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Get away from that phone.
text: Strasser stops in his tracks, looks at Rick, and sees that
text: he is armed.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: (steely)
dialog: I would advise you not to interfere.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I was willing to shoot Captain
dialog: Renault, and I'm willing to shoot
dialog: 125.
dialog: you.
text: Strasser watches the plane in agony. His eyes dart towards
text: the telephone. He runs toward it and desperately grabs the
dialog: receiver.
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Put that phone down!
speaker_heading: STRASSER
dialog: Get me the Radio Tower!
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Put it down!
text: Strasser, one hand holding the receiver, pulls out a pistol
text: with the other hand, and SHOOTS quickly at Rick. The bullet
text: misses its mark.
text: Rick now SHOOTS at Strasser, who crumples to the ground.
text: At the sound of an approaching car both men turn. A police
text: car SPEEDS in and comes to a stop near Renault. Four
text: gendarmes hurriedly jump out.
text: In the distance the plane turns onto the runway.
text: The gendarmes run to Renault. The first one hurriedly
text: salutes him.
speaker_heading: GENDARME
dialog: Mon Capitaine!
speaker_heading: RENAULT
text: Major Strasser's been shot.
text: Renault pauses and looks at Rick. Rick returns Renault's
text: gaze with expressionless eyes.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Round up the usual suspects.
speaker_heading: GENDARME
dialog: Oui, mon Capitaine.
text: The gendarmes take Strasser's body away and then drive off.
text: Renault walks inside the hangar, picks up a bottle of Vichy
text: water, and opens it.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: 126.
dialog: Well, Rick, you're not only a
dialog: sentimentalist, but you've become
dialog: a patriot.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Maybe, but it seemed like a good time
dialog: to start.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: I think perhaps you're right.
text: As he pours the water into a glass, Renault sees the Vichy
text: label and quickly DROPS the bottle into a trash basket which
text: he then KICKS over.
text: He walks over and stands beside Rick. They both watch the
text: plane take off, maintaining their gaze until it disappears
text: into the clouds.
text: Rick and Louis slowly walk away from the hangar toward the
dialog: runway.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: It might be a good idea for you
dialog: to disappear from Casablanca for
dialog: a while. There's a Free French
text: garrison over at Brazzaville.
dialog: I could be induced to arrange a
dialog: passage.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: My letter of transit? I could use
dialog: a trip. But it doesn't make any
dialog: difference about our bet. You
dialog: still owe me ten thousand francs.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: And that ten thousand francs should
dialog: pay our expenses.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Our expenses?
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Louis, I think this is the beginning
text: of a beautiful friendship.
text: The two walk off together into the night.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: THE END
dialog:
