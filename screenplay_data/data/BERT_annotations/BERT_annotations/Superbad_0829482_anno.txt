scene_heading: INT. SETH'S CAR - MORNING
text: Seth, seventeen, a bit heavyset, in the midst of a sad

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I was doing research last night, for next

speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Which one's Bang Bus?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: The one where they bang the chicks on the

dialog: access, live Web Cam feed. The works.
dialog: It'll be like I'm on the bus, banging
dialog: them myself.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: That stuff's bullshit, they're all faking

speaker_heading: EVAN'S MOM
dialog: Thanks for taking him, Seth.

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Don't touch that!
speaker_heading: EVAN'S MOM
dialog: You two are so funny. I can't imagine
dialog: what you'll do without each other next

dialog: State.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Yeah, you know. I got some other places.

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Fuck it. I'm a senior about to graduate.
dialog: They should be suckin' my balls. It's the
dialog: least they can do for stealing three
dialog: years of my life.
text: They walk past DIMITRI (18, big Native American guy) as they
text: enter the store. Dimitri aggressively bumps his shoulder into
dialog: Seth.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: What the hell's wrong with Dimitri?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Oh, yeah dude, I forgot to tell you. I
dialog: knocked the fuckin' shit out of him in

speaker_heading: EVAN

speaker_heading: EVAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at those nipples.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: They're like baby toes.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: It's not fair. I have to hide every
dialog: erection I get.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Sometimes I get boners so big I can't
dialog: hide them. And then I get nervous and my
text: heart starts pounding, and it all just,
dialog: like, feeds my boner. It just becomes
dialog: this...thing...that's attached to me. And
dialog: it won't go away.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Just imagine if girls weren't weirded out
dialog: by our boners and they actually wanted to
dialog: see `em, like this shit.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You know it's been, like, a year and a
dialog: half since I've seen an actual human
dialog: female nipple. Besides my mom's. I saw it
dialog: last month, and it was sick.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Holy shit. Liat was two years ago? I
dialog: guess so. She was insanely hot, though.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Exactly. Too hot. That's what sucks.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: How can that possibly suck? I'd be
dialog: fuckin' psyched if I'd gotten with a girl
dialog: that hot. You got, like, two dozen
dialog: handjobs!
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: And three quarters of a blowjob, But that
dialog: was fuckin' it. It was the peak of my ass-
dialog: gettin' career, and it happened way, way,

speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: You're like Orson Welles.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: 5 CONTINUED: (2) 5
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Exactly! If I'd built up to it, I'd
dialog: probably at least be having steady sex
text: with a mediocre-looking girl at this
dialog: point. I honestly now see why Orson
text: Welles ate his fat ass to death.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: You'll have sex in college. Everyone
dialog: does. And if not, you'll have the Bang
dialog: Bus.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: But the key is to be good at sex by the
dialog: time you're in college. You don't want
dialog: girls to think you suck dick at fucking.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: I still think you've got a chance with
dialog: Jules. She got mad hot over last summer,
dialog: and clearly hasn't realized it, `cause
dialog: she still flirts with you.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Are you joking, man? Let's see here...she
dialog: dated Dan Remick, Matt Muir, Josh Corber
dialog: and what's-his-face. All of those were
dialog: cool guys. She's been hot way longer than
dialog: you think. Why would she end her high
dialog: school career with me?
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Well, Helen got with Ariel Shafir.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Yeah, and he was a complete fucking
dialog: loser. You're a step up from that. Which
dialog: is why you should stop being a pussy and
dialog: do her! You could nailthe shit out of
dialog: her for, like, two months before you
dialog: leave. That bitch looks like a good
dialog: fucker.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Hey! I'm sick of you talking about her
dialog: like that, man!
text: Evan starts to walk out. Seth follows.
speaker_heading: SETH

speaker_heading: EVAN

speaker_heading: SETH

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah.
text: Terry spits on Seth's shirt.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: And you're not coming. Tell your fucking
dialog: faggot friend he can't come either.
text: Seth wipes the spit off. He looks at Terry and seems as
text: though he's about to say something, but is interrupted when
text: Terry starts hocking up more spit. Seth runs away as Terry
text: and his friends laugh. He catches up to Evan and they head
text: back to school.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Wow. You really bitched out on that one.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I bitched out? You bitched out! You were
