scene_heading: INT. CAPT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT

text: it among the other trash before him.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I guess if I had to choose I'd say...

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: She's pretty cute.
speaker_heading: BILL

dialog: cute ain't hot.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yeah, no shit.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: As far a hot... goes I gotta go
dialog: with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was
dialog: pretty hot.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult
dialog: to get some of that... and the best
dialog: part is she didn't try to kill the
dialog: President or nothing, so that baggage
dialog: ain't hanging around.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I thought she tried to murder a
dialog: witness for the prosecution.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I'll let it slide, she was only
dialog: seventeen.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't
dialog: no carry-on shit, that's some heavy
dialog: duty Samsonite shit.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always

speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at
dialog: that old stripper lady's place.
dialog: Watching her dance around with those

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I know, that was some crazy shit. I

scene_heading: INT. SPAULDING'S - MUSEUM - NIGHT

scene_heading: CAPT. SPAULDING
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, you are about
text: to enter a world of darkness. A world
dialog: where life and death are meaningless
dialog: and pain is God.
dialog: (pointing with a cane)
dialog: To your left you see the infamous
dialog: Albert Fish.
text: A lifeless wax figure POPS forward with a loud metal CLANG.
text: Mary jumps back with fright.
scene_heading: CAPT. SPAULDING
dialog: Sadist, masochist, child killer and
dialog: most of all importantly cannibal.
dialog: Born in 1870, Mr. Fish enjoyed burning
text: himself with hot pokers, spankings
text: with nail-studded paddles and
text: embedding needles in his groin. On
dialog: the right, notice the X-ray...
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - X-RAY
scene_heading: CAPT. SPAULDING

text: Behind the figure of Gein hangs an inverted corpse of a slain

text: Mary recoils in disgust.
scene_heading: CAPT. SPAULDING
dialog: Murderer, cannibal and momma's little

dialog: bodies of women, especially their
dialog: sexual organs. He was quite a handy
text: little dandy, fashioning lamp shades,

dialog: and most famously a.k.a. Dr. Satan.
text: Another wax figure, of a bloody corpse, JUMPS up.
scene_heading: CAPT. SPAULDING

dialog: master surgeon. Mr. Quale an intern
dialog: at Willows State Mental Hospital,
dialog: nicknamed Weeping Willows for its
dialog: neverending cries of pain, took great
dialog: pleasure in control. Through primitive
dialog: brain surgery. Mr. Quale believed he
dialog: could create a race of superhumans
dialog: from the mentally ill, or so the
text: story goes. His terrifying experiments
dialog: continued until 1952.
text: Jerry stares fascinated.
scene_heading: CAPT. SPAULDING
dialog: At which time he was discovered and
dialog: turned over to authorities for
dialog: observation. Unfortunately, Mr. Quale
dialog: was abducted from his cell by members
dialog: of the victims' families. Vigilante
dialog: justice prevailed and Dr. Satan was
text: taken out and hanged. The next day
text: his body was found to be missing.
text: Some say he survived, rescued by his
dialog: loyal slaves, others say they hung
dialog: the wrong man... To this day no sign

dialog: Oh, yeah.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yeah, in this book there's a chapter
dialog: called Self Made Freaks about how
dialog: people would mutilate themselves in

dialog: mostly talks about tattooed people

dialog: suspected of having her arms removed
dialog: on purpose to become an arm-less

speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: These dates perfectly correspond

speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: OK, everyone, put on your masks. We
dialog: can't very well eat with our everyday
text: faces exposed.
text: Mother puts on her mask, Tiny and Grampa follow. Jerry, Bill

text: A voice from the shadows interrupts.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: I know all about what you want to
dialog: know about.
text: A PALE FIGURE creeps forward like NOSFERATU from a dark corner
text: of the room. This is OTIS.
text: He stands six foot, but is deathly slim. His skin is
text: translucent, glowing in the dark. Long thin white hair covers
text: his head. His eyes are grey. He is an ALBINO.
text: He is holding a GLASS JAR containing a SMALL FETUS. On closer
text: inspection we see there are two small bodies joined to one
text: head. The label reads WOLF.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (happy surprise)
dialog: Otis! I can't believe you decided to
dialog: come down and join us... and you
dialog: brought little Wolf. This really is
dialog: a special night... all my babies
dialog: together.
text: Otis sets the disturbing jar of Wolf on the table. He leans
text: forward onto the jar, resting his chin.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Now, I don't know where you heard

speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: GRAMPA
dialog: (mouth full of food)
dialog: What are you, Jimmy Olsen cub reporter
dialog: for the Daily Asshole?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Grampa... watch the language.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: I ain't sure that you really need to
dialog: know. It's better you go home still
dialog: dreaming about your kitty cats and
dialog: puppy dogs.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I really want to know.
speaker_heading: GRAMPA
dialog: Hey, the kid wants to know. Enlighten

scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - BARN - NIGHT
text: Billy, Jerry, Mary and Denise stand waiting in front of an

dialog: the occasion.
speaker_heading: MOTHER

text: pumpkin.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - BARN - NIGHT
text: We follow Mother inside.
text: Thousands of red Christmas lights hang down, strung through

speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Please be seated.
text: Mother motions toward four empty seats in the front row.
speaker_heading: JERRY

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (to Bill)
dialog: Check this out.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Well, ya can't complain I never take

text: The sound of a warped crackling record fills the room. Lounge
dialog: music.
text: A small spotlight hits the quilted curtain covering the stage.
text: Mother Firefly stands behind the controls.
text: She is smiling proudly.
text: The curtain clumsily parts TO REVEAL:
text: A stage set pieced together from amusement park wreckage.
text: A giant painted plywood devil looms over the stage, surrounded
text: by dancing skeletons and demon girls.
text: A microphone stands center stage.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (quietly)
text: I can't believe what I'm seeing.
speaker_heading: JERRY

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: GRAMPA
dialog: So, I tell 'im... Hal, here's the
dialog: secret. Go home tonight, crawl into
dialog: bed, get under the covers and eat
dialog: your wife's pussy... I mean jam your

text: Jerry starts to giggle.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: What are you laughing at?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I don't know, I think he's funny.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: This isn't funny, it's twisted.
speaker_heading: GRAMPA
text: So, Hal goes home, jumps in, starts
text: chomping and licking away at her
text: pussy, she's screaming and howling...
text: totally passes out from the
dialog: experience.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Dear God, let this end.
speaker_heading: GRAMPA
dialog: Now, Hal... He's feeling pretty good,
text: so he goes into the bathroom for a
dialog: quick shave...
dialog: (pauses)
text: ...suddenly he lets out a horrible
dialog: scream. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
text: The recorded crowd chuckles.
speaker_heading: GRAMPA
text: Sitting there on the toilet is Hal's
dialog: wife Gloria... and she says, "Quiet
dialog: down, you'll wake Grandma!"
text: The recorded crowd screams with laughter, as does Jerry.
text: Bill, Denise and Mary look at him like he's crazy.
speaker_heading: GRAMPA

dialog: (looking at his watch)
dialog: Man, it's already ten thirty.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'm with Denise, can't we just walk
dialog: to someplace, this is getting fucking
dialog: stupid.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Negative. Shit, we are so deep in
dialog: the sticks we could walk for hours
dialog: and find zero.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yeah, I'd say at this point all we
dialog: can do is just wait it out. There's
dialog: nothing else.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: I suppose. I mean they're obviously
dialog: all bonkers, but I guess they're
dialog: harmless.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I fucking hope so.
text: The stage lights come up. The recorded applause and music
dialog: begin.
text: Baby enters the stage. She is dressed in a home-made showgirl
text: outfit. She begins to dance clumsily to the music. She appears
text: to be somewhat intoxicated.
text: The vocals come on and Baby begins to lipsync to the song.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: You gotta be kidding me. This chick
dialog: is wasted.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Shhhhhh.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: How much is a person supposed to
dialog: stand?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (motioning for Mary
dialog: to keep her voice
dialog: down)
dialog: Quiet.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I
dialog: disturbing your viewing pleasure?
text: Baby makes her way down from stage on to floor level. She
text: gyrates and seductively TEASES one of the dummy audience
dialog: members.
text: Baby moves over to Jerry. Stroking her hand down his face.
text: Denise tries to look amused. Jerry smiles uncomfortably.
text: Baby strolls past Denise and stops in front of Mary.
text: Baby pauses and pinches Mary's cheek and winks. Mary is
speaker_heading: FURIOUS.
text: Baby moves over to Bill. Mary watches like a mother hawk.
text: Baby sings and dances with all of her attention focused on
dialog: Bill.
text: Baby puts her arms around Bill's neck and sits on his lap.
text: Mary BOLTS FORWARD and SHOVES Baby off of Bill.
text: Baby crashes onto the floor.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Take that, you fucking slut!
dialog: (Mary spits at Baby)
dialog: Fucking redneck whore!
speaker_heading: BABY
dialog: You shouldn't a done that.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Why? You gonna do something about
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: BABY
dialog: (standing up)
dialog: Yeah, I'll do something.
text: Baby takes out a straight razor from behind her back.
speaker_heading: BABY
dialog: I'll cut your fucking tits off and
dialog: shove 'em down your throat.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Baby! Stop!
text: Mrs. Firefly runs down from her position behind the spotlight

speaker_heading: BABY

dialog: car.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Lock the fucking doors.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
text: Bill begins to pull the car down the long dirt driveway
text: towards the road. The heavy rain makes visibility difficult.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (straining to see
dialog: through the darkness)
text: Almost there.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Jesus, you think she was really gonna
dialog: cut you?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (leaning her forehead
dialog: on the window)
dialog: Of course she was gonna cut me, she's
dialog: a fucking nut...
text: (closes her eyes and
dialog: takes a breath)
dialog: I knew she was crazy from the second
dialog: we picked her up.
text: SLAM! Suddenly, Baby pounds her fist against Mary's window.
text: Mary jumps back in terror.
speaker_heading: BABY
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: You're in Hell, bitch! You're gonna
dialog: die like a dog!
text: Baby disappears into the darkness.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Go! Go! Go! Get us out of here!
text: Bill pulls the car up to the front gate. It is chained shut
text: with a huge padlock.
text: LIGHTNING CRASHES, illuminating the crucified scarecrows.
text: FLASH CLOSE-UP CUTS - of grinning jack-o-lantern faces peer
text: down from above.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
text: Bill opens the car door, starts to get out.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (hysterical)
dialog: What are you doing!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I gotta open the gate.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Drive through it!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: It won't work.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Holy fuck, hurry up.
text: Jerry, Mary and Denise watch through the windshield as Bill
text: struggles to unlatch the thick iron gates.
text: SUDDENLY, one of the SCARECROWS JUMPS down from his cross
text: and SMASHES Bill over the head with a HEAVY CLUB. Bill drops
text: to his knees.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Bill! Help him!
text: Jerry throws open his door to get out. He's SHOVED BACK into
text: the car by another, larger scarecrow outside his door. This
text: scarecrow begins smashing the car's windows with a METAL
speaker_heading: PIPE.
text: Bill lays motionless, face down in the mud. His attacker
text: turns his attention on the car. He also begins smashing the
text: car's windows.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR - NIGHT
text: From a distance we see Jerry pulled from the car and beaten.
text: The girls are helplessly trapped inside the destroyed vehicle.
text: The scarecrows continue to pound on the car.
text: As we fade out, the sound of a BARKING DOG can be heard.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - MAGIC
text: From a long shot, we see the farmhouse in the early morning
text: sunrise. All is still.
text: The sound of an engine starting breaks the early morning
text: silence. Rufus's tow truck is seen pulling away from behind
text: the house. The BEATEN REMAINS of Bill's car are towed behind
dialog: it.
scene_heading: EXT. WILLIS HOUSE - SUNRISE
text: Darkness, except for the face of an alarm clock. The time is
text: 7:00 AM. TICK, TICK, TICK... BUZZZZZZ. The alarm goes off.
text: A hand reaches over and turns off the alarm. We hear a deep
text: groan. A light turns on.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIS'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING
text: Don Willis wakes up, having fallen asleep in his easy chair.
text: He sits up and wipes the sleep from his eyes. He runs a hand
text: across his head, smoothing out his thinning grey hair.
text: He picks up a phone next to his bed, dials a number, waits.
speaker_heading: MR. WILLIS
dialog: Hi. Lieutenant Broekman please...
dialog: Donald Willis.
dialog: He holds.
speaker_heading: MR. WILLIS
dialog: Hey, Phil...

text: B+W memories of Denise at the beach, RUDY the dog. High school
text: graduations and Donald Willis in uniform with the other
text: members of 56 Precinct. Donald is a FORMER POLICE OFFICER.
speaker_heading: MR. WILLIS
dialog: I'm a little worried about Denise.

text: road, out by Ruggsville at some joint
dialog: called Spaulding's or something like
dialog: that, said she'd be here about
dialog: eleven... but she never showed up.
dialog: Paces.
speaker_heading: MR. WILLIS
dialog: Yeah, if you could run a check on up

dialog: really appreciate it...

dialog: like to worry... thanks... bye.
text: Hangs up the phone.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - OTIS'S ROOM - DAY
text: Mary opens her eyes, squinting into the light. Sunlight peers
text: through filth on the windows, fractured by the tattered
text: remains of rotted curtains. Peeling yellowed newspaper serves
text: as wallpaper surrounding the window.
text: Mary's eyes move across the walls to a painting of a BIG
text: EYED KITTEN. She stares at it and smiles. A look of horror
text: begins to appear on her face. She begins to scream
text: uncontrollably.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: (off screen)
dialog: Shut your fucking mouth!
text: She is hysterical.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: I said shut your mouth!
text: ZOOM BACK to see Mary wearing a dunce cap, tied to a chair,
text: facing a corner in the farmhouse's attic. This is Otis's art
dialog: studio.
text: Otis, standing before a large canvas, sets down his paint
text: brush and calmly walks over to Mary.
text: He spins her chair around, clamps her mouth shut with his
text: hand and leans his nose against hers.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: (slow and sinister)
dialog: Listen, you Malibu Barbie middle
dialog: class piece of shit. I'm trying to
dialog: work, you got me, work... you ever
dialog: work?
text: Mary's eyes scream with terror, she nods yes.
speaker_heading: OTIS

dialog: about white socks with Mickey Mouse
text: on one side and Donald Duck on the
dialog: other... shit, you ain't reading no

text: Otis raises his paint covered hand.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: This is blood and guts, Suzy Q. Our
dialog: bodies come and go, but this blood
dialog: is forever...
dialog: (pulls a small book
dialog: from his breast pocket)
dialog: ...let me read you something, listen
dialog: and learn... you listening?
text: Otis pulls back his hand, ready to backhand her across the
text: face with the book. She nods again. He lowers the book.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: (gesturing dramatically)
text: And the angels, all pallid and wan,
dialog: Uprising, unveiling, affirm That the

speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Now, I'm gonna remove my hand... you
dialog: make a sound and I swear I'll slit
dialog: you open and make you eat your own
dialog: fucking intestines... you get me?
text: She nods again. He slowly removes his hand from her mouth.
text: Mary tries to remain calm, but starts to hyperventilate.
text: Tears roll down her face.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Why? Why are you doing this?
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Doing what? Messy up your day? Well,
dialog: fuck lady there are some bigger issues

speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's
dialog: been great help to me... a real
dialog: blessing... I couldn't have asked
dialog: for a better specimen. I mean you
dialog: don't know what a dry spell I've
dialog: had, total block...
dialog: (slaps his forehead)
dialog: ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
text: Mary looks confused, but relieved.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Let's go see.
text: Otis grabs the back of the chair and drags her across the
text: room towards a curtained off area.
text: Whoosh! He pulls her through the curtains. From behind the
text: curtain we hear Mary SCREAMING and Otis LAUGHING.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (behind curtain)
dialog: Bill? No, no, no! What have you done?
dialog: Bill!
scene_heading: INT. CURTAIN ROOM - OTIS'S ROOM - DAY
text: Ugliness. Decay. Pain. Carefully arranged on a model's

text: Bill's face is frozen in a death scream.
speaker_heading: OTIS

speaker_heading: MARY

dialog: This can't be real, this can't be
dialog: real, this can't be real.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Oh, it's real... as real as I want
dialog: it to be, mamma...

speaker_heading: MARY

dialog: (twitches and shakes)
dialog: ...but if you'll notice...
dialog: (points to a blank
dialog: spot in the painting)
dialog: right here, needs a little something,
dialog: heh?
text: Otis slowly puts down the canvas, turns and picks up a huge
dialog: hunting knife.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: (squirming)
dialog: ...no, stop... please, please.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: You, my dear worm feeder, are about

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: NAISH
dialog: Right.
text: They walk to the door.
scene_heading: INT. SPAULDING'S - DAY
text: The door swings open. Wydell enters slowly, putting on his
text: best cowboy attitude. Naish follows suit.
text: Wydell, hands on his belt, struts up to the counter.
text: No one is around.
text: A rusted bell sits on the counter, taped to it is a
text: handwritten note, "ring for service". Wydell rings it once,
text: waits, no response. Rings it again, waits, no response.
speaker_heading: NAISH
dialog: (looking around the
dialog: room)
dialog: Get a load of all this crap... this
dialog: is one sick place.
text: Wydell begins ringing the bell non-stop.
text: Spaulding shouts from the backroom.
scene_heading: CAPT. SPAULDING
dialog: Whoever's a jerking off on that bell
dialog: better be gone when I get out there...
dialog: 'cause I'm gonna rip your nuts off.
text: Spaulding enters from behind the curtain, angry. He sees the

speaker_heading: WYDELL
dialog: Anyway, there's not much else out

speaker_heading: MR. WILLIS
dialog: What about the body you found?
speaker_heading: WYDELL
dialog: (slightly surprised)

dialog: ...where's Otis?
speaker_heading: BABY
dialog: Oh, he's coming, he got something
dialog: real special this year.
text: Rufus jumps down, begins to spin the bound captives around
dialog: and around.
speaker_heading: RUFUS JR.
dialog: Otis, Otis, Otis, Otis!
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Quiet, quiet, you know he won't come
dialog: down with all this hoop-dee-doo
text: bouncing off the walls. Now, calm
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: GRAMPA
dialog: I shot an elephant in my pajamas
dialog: this morning... how he got in my
dialog: pajamas I'll never know.
speaker_heading: BABY
dialog: Grampa, shhhhhhhh.
speaker_heading: GRAMPA
dialog: Then we tried to remove the tusks,
dialog: but they were embedded in so firmly
dialog: that we couldn't budge 'em.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (gesturing at Grampa)
dialog: Let him finish.
speaker_heading: GRAMPA
dialog: Of course, in Alabama the Tuscaloosa,
text: but that's entirely irrelephant.
text: The room goes silent. All eyes are focused on the stairs.
text: A robed figure, Otis, appears at the top of the stairs, he
text: begins to descend.
text: Rufus waits at the bottom of the stairs. As Otis reaches the
text: last step Rufus hands him the megaphone.
text: Denise, Mary and Jerry struggle to watch as they in turn
text: rotate past the scene unfolding.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: (through the megaphone)
dialog: I'm the one who brings the Christmas
dialog: candy... now tell me
dialog: (pauses and raises
dialog: his arms)
dialog: ...Who's your Daddy?
text: Otis walks closer to the rotating captives.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: I'm the one who brings the devil's
dialog: brandy...
dialog: (waits)
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Who's your Daddy!
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Yes! I'm the one who beats you when
dialog: you're bad...
speaker_heading: BABY
dialog: Who's your Daddy!
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Who's your Daddy!
text: Otis stops the spinning of his prisoners and stands directly
dialog: before Denise.
text: He drops his robe, underneath he is wearing a SUIT OF SKIN
text: sewn together from pieces of Denise's father.
text: Denise stares in horror, tears stream down her cheeks, barely
text: able to comprehend the madness around her.
text: Otis moves in close and licks her across the face.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: I'm the one who loves you when you're
dialog: fucking dead!
dialog: Everyone chants "Who's your Daddy?"
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: (imitating Willis)
dialog: Now, I say my little darlings...
dialog: (rotates the chain to
dialog: Mary)
dialog: maybe prancing around where you don't
dialog: belong ain't such a winner of an
dialog: idea...
dialog: (slaps Mary across
dialog: the face)
text: Slowly turns the chain to face Jerry.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: And you, the great rusher of fools,
dialog: what were you after...
dialog: (slaps Jerry)
dialog: Huh, speak to me...
dialog: (slaps him again)
dialog: Oh, that's right, Dr. Satan...
dialog: everybody got to know about Dr. Satan,
dialog: Jesus Christ, let the old dog rest
dialog: for fuck sake, he's already got one
text: foot in the grave and the other's
text: tap dancing around the edge...
dialog: (gets nose to nose
dialog: with Jerry)
dialog: ...well, I can see the disappointment
dialog: on your sad little puppy face... so
dialog: I'm gonna do you a favor, a big, big
dialog: favor. You owe me, boy. I'm gonna
dialog: let you meet the old bastard.
speaker_heading: GRAMPA
dialog: That's a horse's ass alright, I told
dialog: you.
text: Jerry's eyes widen in fear.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Baby, roll that old love machine
dialog: over here, so this boy can meet his
dialog: hero.
text: Baby rolls Grampa over to Jerry.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: (lifts his skin mask)
dialog: You see it's all true, the boogieman
dialog: is real and you found him...
dialog: (Jerry stares in shock)
dialog: ...why so sad? Isn't this what you
dialog: begged for? There he is, the living
dialog: legend himself, ta da Dr. Satan.
dialog: Now, don't get shy on me... ask your
dialog: hero some questions, don't blow this
dialog: last in a lifetime opportunity.
speaker_heading: GRAMPA
dialog: Zarkoff, I will conquer the sea, the
dialog: air, the earth... the universe.
text: Mother moves in close to Jerry.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Look at the way he lights up... Grampa
dialog: just loves meeting his fans.
text: Otis grabs Jerry's cheeks and makes his face move like a
text: ventriloquist dummy, provides Jerry's voice.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Aw gee whiz, I'm so excited... I
dialog: really think you're the coolest...
dialog: you're tops on the playground, cooler
dialog: than the Fonzie.
text: Baby grabs Mary and does the same ventriloquist routine.
speaker_heading: BABY
dialog: Oh, oh pick me, pick me... I have a
dialog: question.
text: Baby rotates Mary around to where Gramps is seated.
speaker_heading: BABY
dialog: (squeezing Mary's
dialog: face, hard)
dialog: I was wondering Mr. Satan sir, do
dialog: you like to kiss on the first date
dialog: or is that considered slutty?
speaker_heading: GRAMPA
dialog: What the fuck are you saying? Who
dialog: the hell is talking to me?
text: Tiny, growing restless, begins banging on his metal drum.
text: KLANG - KLANG - KLANG. Rufus joins in, clapping his hands.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Come on, my babies are getting
dialog: restless.
speaker_heading: RUFUS JR.
text: Dump in the pit, dump in the pit,
text: dump in the pit.
text: Mother, Baby, Grampa join in chanting with Rufus.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Alright, alright. Cut 'em down, it's
dialog: time they get what they came here
dialog: for.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
text: The rain pounds down. A heavy fog hovers over the dense growth
text: of the field. In the distance, silhouetted by moonlight, a
text: gruesome caravan slowly moves through the night.
text: Otis, lantern in hand, leads the way. Followed by Baby and
text: Mother together under a large black umbrella. Next Rufus
text: holds the leash connected to Jerry, Denise and Mary.
text: Bringing up the rear, Tiny, shotgun focused on the prisoners,
text: and Grampa. Grampa is strapped to Tiny's back like a child.
text: He waves a flashlight back and forth like a search beam.
text: The group comes to a halt at a huge wooden structure.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: (handing Baby the
dialog: lantern)
dialog: Hold this. Point it over here.
text: Baby directs the light at Otis. We see that he is trying to
text: unlock a huge padlock attached to an iron door embedded in
text: the base of the wooden structure.
text: Otis unlocks the door and swings it open. He reaches down
text: into the blackness and pulls up an iron hook and wench,
text: attached to the hook is a chain.
text: Otis parts a section of the overgrown grass next to the pit
text: to reveal a rusty metal crank. He begins to turn the crank.
text: Slowly, from out of the pit, rises a coffin hanging from the
text: end of the chain.
text: Otis pulls the coffin over and lays it flat on the ground.
text: He flips open the lid.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Hey happy-boy, step your ass up here.
text: Rufus cuts loose Jerry, but holds him steady by the neck.
speaker_heading: BABY
dialog: Take his gag out, it's more fun with
text: the screaming.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Yeah, I like the screaming too...
dialog: it's so much more exciting.
text: Rufus cuts loose the gag.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Please don't kill us, please don't
dialog: kill us.
speaker_heading: BABY
dialog: (imitating Jerry)
dialog: Please don't kill us, please don't
dialog: kill us.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Bitch, shut your mouth and get your
dialog: shit in the box.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Let us go, please... let the girls
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: BABY
dialog: (imitating Jerry)
dialog: Let us go, please... let the girls
dialog: go.
text: Otis pulls out a gun and points it at Jerry.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Get in... now!
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Wait, I want to say good-bye.
text: Mother grabs Jerry by the collar and gives him a big kiss.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Bye sweety, we could of been great
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Please, let us go, we won't tell
dialog: anybody.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Aw, honey you know I can't do that.
speaker_heading: BABY
dialog: We won't tell anybody.
text: Otis cocks the pistol. Jerry starts to slowly move towards
dialog: the coffin.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Christ, ain't this fucking a hoot...
dialog: alright mamma, I ain't got all fucking
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Please, please this is insane. You
dialog: can't do this.
text: Rufus pushes Jerry into the coffin.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: It is and I can... next.
text: Denise starts kicking and fighting with Rufus. Rufus tries
text: to hold her steady, when suddenly Mary breaks free and starts
dialog: to run.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: (laughs and raises
dialog: his pistol)
dialog: Where's she think she's a gonna get
dialog: to? She's gonna run all the way home.
speaker_heading: BABY
dialog: No! Let me get her...
dialog: (turns to Mother)
dialog: ...Ma, Otis is having all the fun...
dialog: can I get her?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: That's true, Otis... not that we're
dialog: having a bad time, but...
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: (rolls his eyes)
dialog: Well, go get her.
text: Baby jumps with excitement and runs off across the field
dialog: after Mary.
text: Mary trips and falls over a small gravestone. She gets up
text: and stumbles back into a wooden cross. She tears the gag
text: from her mouth and gasps for air.
speaker_heading: BABY (O.S.)
dialog: There once was a woman who lived
text: with her daughter in a cabbage garden.
text: Mary turns toward the voice but sees nothing but wooden
text: crosses. She is in a homemade cemetery.
speaker_heading: BABY (O.S.)
dialog: ...along came a rabbit and ate up
dialog: all the cabbages. The woman said...
text: Mary turns 360 degrees, but finds nothing.
speaker_heading: BABY (O.S.)
dialog: ..."Go into the garden and drive out
dialog: the rabbit"...
text: THUD! Mary is hit from behind, she falls forward. Baby JUMPS
text: on top of her and sits on her back. Baby is holding a large
dialog: hunting knife.
speaker_heading: BABY
dialog: "Shoo! Shoo!" said the maiden...
text: Mary screams in pain, as Baby PLUNGES the knife into her.
text: Baby STABS Mary again and again and again. Mary lets out a
text: long gurgling scream, then goes silent.
speaker_heading: BABY
dialog: ..."Come maiden," said the rabbit...
dialog: (leans down)
dialog: ...sit on my tail and go with me to
dialog: my rabbit hutch.
text: Baby, covered in blood, licks the knife clean.
scene_heading: EXT. PIT - NIGHT
text: Otis shoves Denise into the coffin with Jerry and locks the
text: lid shut. Through a CROSS-SHAPED OPENING in the coffin we
text: see them crushed together.
text: Rufus LOWERS the coffin into the pit. Once the coffin is
text: inside Otis slams the door shut.
text: Otis opens a small window in the door and lowers in a lantern
text: and a small tape recorder playing music.
scene_heading: INT. PIT - NIGHT
text: Enter Hell. The dim light of the lantern shines off the slimy
text: wet filth of the rotted wood walls. The stench of death and
text: decay hangs heavy in the thin air.
text: Denise and Jerry, cold and shivering, hang half submerged in
text: thick maggot infested sludge. Bits of animal and human
text: skeletons float in the muck, broken bones lay in piles along
dialog: the walls.
scene_heading: INT. COFFIN - NIGHT
text: Through the dim light, we see the tightly packed forms of
dialog: Jerry and Denise.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: (hysterical)
dialog: We've got get out of here, we got
dialog: get out of here.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Think, think. Try to open the lid,
text: try to kick a hole in the wood.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: (crying)
dialog: I can't... I can't move my arms. I
dialog: hurt so much.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I know, but we can make it out of
dialog: here. We can do it.
text: Boom! A LOUD THUMP is heard against the side of the coffin.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: That was good babe, just keep doing
dialog: that.
scene_heading: BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: That's not me. I didn't... I'm not
dialog: doing that.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Someone is out there...
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: ...help, we're in here!
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Help, help us.
text: Suddenly, an arm breaks through the side of the coffin.
text: Another smashes through the top of the lid. The coffin begins
text: to violently shake. Denise screams.
text: Another reaches through, grabbing her feet. SMASH! The coffin
text: is ripped apart and Jerry is pulled away from the destruction.
text: He lets out a quick scream before disappearing into the
dialog: darkness.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVINGROOM - NIGHT
text: The spastic light of TV static strobes across the sleeping
text: face of Grampa. Beside him, Mother sleeps peacefully.
scene_heading: EXT. BARN - NIGHT
text: The rain has stopped. Tiny opens the doors to the barn.
text: He goes inside. He exits a few moments later, dragging a
text: huge wooden stake. He sets the stake down carefully and closes
text: the barn doors. He then picks up the stake and drags it away.
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT
text: Behind the farmhouse is a camouflage jungle, an intricate
text: system of ropes and netting is strung together to hide the
text: many automobiles beneath.
text: Rufus moves through the jungle. He stops and begins to remove
text: the netting from a car, it is Wydell's police cruiser. He
text: climbs inside the car, puts on Wydell's policeman's hat and
text: starts the engine. He drives off.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT
text: Rufus is driving like a maniac through the open farmland. He
text: turns on the overhead flashing lights.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELDS - NIGHT
text: The police cruiser twists and turns in the barren fields.
scene_heading: INT. PIT - NIGHT
text: Denise stands knee deep in the sludge. Broken bits of the
text: coffin's remains are scattered around her.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Jerry please answer me.
text: A soft moaning sound is heard coming from the other end of
dialog: the pit.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Jerry...
dialog: (moving slowly forward)
dialog: ...is that you?
text: Denise cautiously makes her way to the bend at the end of
text: the tunnel. As she approaches, the moaning sound gets louder.
text: She turns the corner to see:
text: TWO PALE FIGURES in filthy hospital gowns hunched over a
text: shadowy object. Denise gasps. They turn towards Denise,
text: revealing the partially devoured dead body of Jerry.
text: The two bone-white ghouls are dripping with Jerry's blood,
text: they stare at Denise, then return to their prey.
text: Denise screams in horror and runs, turning down another twist
text: in the underground maze. She turns the corner and runs
text: straight into SEVERAL SLOW MOVING GHOULS. The ghouls are of
text: the same deathly white complexion, hair-less with flaked,
text: cracking skin. Their yellow eyes shine in the darkness.
text: They reach for her, but she breaks free and continues to run
text: into the endless stretch of tunnels before her.
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
text: Primitive wooden crosses form a circle around a burnt piece
text: of land, approximately twenty feet in diameter.
text: Laying flat in the center is the large stake, Mary's body is
text: draped across it. Tiny is securing her to the stake with
dialog: rope.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT
text: Through the windshield, we see Baby jumping and dancing in
text: the fields with several large dogs. She is firing a gun as
dialog: she dances.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
text: Baby sees the car and raises her gun. She aims it at the car
text: driver. She waits, as the car gets closer she sees the face
text: of Rufus behind the wheel. She lowers the gun and begins to
dialog: laugh.
text: The car stops and Baby climbs into the passenger's seat. The
text: car drives off.
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
text: Tiny lifts the stake with Mary firmly strapped in place. He
text: implants it into the ground. Her body hangs like a doll.
text: Tiny opens a gasoline can and begins splashing gas onto the
dialog: stake.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
text: Otis, face painted like a SKULL and wearing a priest's robe,
text: walks solemnly through the tall grass.
scene_heading: INT. PIT - NIGHT
text: Denise, waist high in sludge, wanders lost through the endless
text: tunnels of the pit. In the distance she hears high pitched
text: animal sounds.
text: A GHOUL rises up from the sludge behind Denise. It stands
text: silent. It reaches out a BONEY HAND with long curled
text: fingernails and grabs her hair. Denise screams and tries to
text: pull away. The ghoul grabs her with his other hand and pulls
text: her closer, CLAWING at her face.
text: Denise fights her way free, but loses her footing and falls
text: backwards, slipping under the sludge. She quickly resurfaces
text: and starts to run.
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
text: Otis stands in front of the bound Mary, holding a pumpkin.
text: Otis places the pumpkin over Mary's head.

scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT
text: Baby motions to Rufus to steer the car towards the fire.
scene_heading: INT. PIT - NIGHT
text: A beaten Denise struggles down a long tunnel. She gets to
text: the end to find that it is a dead-end. Behind her, FIVE GHOULS
text: move silently towards her, blocking her only exit.
text: The ghouls slosh through the muck, moving in closer. Denise
text: frantically looks for an escape, nailed into the wall next
text: to her are planks of wood forming a ladder.
text: The ghouls are only a few yards away. Denise climbs up the
text: ladder. They move in, clawing at her legs and feet, trying
text: to pull her down. Denise digs at the wood and mud ceiling
text: above her, trying to break free.
text: Denise is bleeding severely from the chunks of flesh being
text: torn from her legs. She digs wildly at the ceiling, suddenly
text: a board falls free and mud rains down to reveal:
text: STARS, the sky above shines through the hole. Denise smashes
text: her fists at the rotted wood planks, pulling free another
dialog: piece.
text: With all her might Denise grabs hold and pulls herself up
text: through the opening.
scene_heading: EXT. PIT - NIGHT
text: Denise fights her way through the earth and pulls her body
text: up into the night air. The cool air rushes to her lungs. She
text: crawls free of the hole, gasping for air.
text: She is safe. Suddenly... SMASH! A ghoul has broken through
text: the surface. He grabs Denise by the leg and begins to pull
text: her back into the hole.
text: Denise screams and begins kicking violently at the ghoul.
text: She breaks and crawls from the ghoul's reach.
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
text: Rufus and Baby have pulled the police cruiser up by the stake.
text: Rufus and Baby stand on the hood.

scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

text: The flaming object burns in the distance behind her.
text: Denise stumbles toward the road on two badly injured legs.
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

text: the police car. Otis stands transfixed by the flames before
dialog: him.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
text: Denise makes her way out onto the road. No cars are in sight.
text: In the distance headlights break through the darkness. Denise
text: stands in the middle of the road.
text: The TRUCK comes into view, it is a small cube truck.
text: Denise stands in the headlights, waving her arms for it to
text: stop. The truck comes to a halt.
text: She runs toward the passenger's side door and climbs in.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK - NIGHT
text: Behind the wheel of the truck is Captain Spaulding.
text: Denise is shaking from shock.

dialog: (tries to open the
dialog: truck door)
dialog: ...I gotta get out, I gotta get out!
text: Boom! The metal door leading to the back of the truck slides

text: of the truck.
text: SLAM! The metal door shuts.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
text: The truck quietly turns onto the dirt road leading up to the
text: farmhouse. The jack-o'-lanterns still burn in the windows,
