scene_heading: INT. UNEMPLOYMENT BUREAU - DAY
text: ON A WOODEN SIGN HANGING FROM THE CEILING. IT READS:
dialog: Metropolis Unemployment Bureau
text: PAN DOWN TO A ROW OF "TELLERS' CAGES" with long lines of PEOPLE waiting to
text: collect their unemployment checks. A sign above the first window says "A - F",
dialog: the second window is designated "G - L" and so on.
text: CLOSE ON THE SECOND WINDOW -- Waiting his turn at the head of the line is a
text: BLACK MAN in his early 30's. He kills time by trying to make a beat-up old
text: wooden yo-yo perform the basic up-and-down maneuver, but he's not very good at
text: it. He looks as if he's down on his luck: shiny pants, slightly frayed collar,
dialog: an old windbreaker. One of life's chronic losers, he is one of those individuals
dialog: who continue to believe in themselves despite overwhelming evidence to the
dialog: contrary. This is GUS GORMAN.
text: Behind the teller's wicket is a middle-aged female CLERK with the requisite
text: officious manner and heart of stone common to her profession. As the MAN ahead
text: of GUS finishes his turn and walks away, she barks out:
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Name?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (as he tries to
dialog: untangle his
dialog: yo-yo string)
dialog: Gus Gorman.
text: She pulls his folder from her file, opens it, scowling.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Ah yes, August Gorman. Have
dialog: you looked for work this week,
dialog: Mr. Gorman?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (this is a familiar
dialog: routine to him)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: What kind?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Kitchen. . . Technician
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Dishwasher? Any luck?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Nope, but --
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Mr. Gorman, according to our
dialog: records you have been unemployed
dialog: for 36 weeks.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Thirty-five.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Not counting this week.
dialog: (looking at his folder)
dialog: You secured employment last June
dialog: as a messenger and were discharged
dialog: after one day for. . .
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: They said I lost it on the subway, but
dialog: it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket
dialog: took it!
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: A television set?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Well, it was one of them little bitty
dialog: two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: The only other employment you
dialog: found was in a fast-food joint--
dialog: (consulting dossier)
dialog: -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well!
dialog: That's some kind of record. Talk about
dialog: fast!
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (protesting)
dialog: Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect
dialog: you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold
dialog: the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions!
dialog: Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody
dialog: found no meat inside that glop yet.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is
dialog: generous to a fault, but. . .
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I know, I'm the fault.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment,
dialog: thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of
dialog: hard-working citizens. Do you know what
dialog: you are?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: You are, I was about to say, no longer
dialog: eligible.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: What about this week's check?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (dismissing him summarily
dialog: Next!
text: The MAN behind him steps up to the counter as a frustrated, miserable GUS walks
text: away. FOLLOW GUS. Muttering to himself about the injustice of it all, he starts
text: for the exit, feeling in his pocket for his cigarettes. he takes out a crumpled
text: pack, pries the paper open and fishes out his last smoke. . . a bent, shabby-
text: looking cigarette. He puts the sorry object in his lips and searched his pockets
dialog: for a match. No luck.
text: NEW ANGLE -- He walks over to a MAN waiting on one of the lines, smoking a
dialog: cigar.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hey brother, got a match?
text: The MAN hands him a matchbook. GUS takes it and is about to open it and light
text: his cigarette, when the printing on the matchbook catches his eye. He looks
text: closely at it.
text: INSERT - TIGHT POV: One of those matchbook advertisements for a home-study
text: course. There is a little line drawing of a smiling, successful man, and the
dialog: sell line:
scene_heading: "EARN BIG MONEY.
scene_heading: BECOME A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER"
text: HOLD ON THIS TIGHT C.U. OF THE MATCHBOOK AND FREEZE FRAME.
text: Music:		The stirring Superman theme begins.
text: THE TITLES OF THE MOVIE APPEARS SUPERIMPOSED OVER THESE IMAGES.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. METROPOLIS STREETS - DAY
dialog: (NOTE: The following sequence, which occurs during, under, and with CREDITS is
text: designed as an elaborate, spectacular series of events based on the Rube-
dialog: Goldberg principle, i.e., a serial development of cause-and-effect, escalating
text: in scope and size. The "gimmick" that further marks this sequence is as follows:
text: At the moment when each new development of "effect" is just about to manifest
text: itself, the FRAME FREEZES and the next CREDIT (actors, composer, writers,
text: director, etc.) appears. Then the FRAME UNFREEZES, the inevitable action takes
dialog: place, leading to the next event in the chain of cause-and-effect until that
text: perfect next moment comes when again there is a FREEZE FRAME, a CREDIT, and so
dialog: on.
dialog: In the following, we have refrained from indicating exactly where each FREEZE
dialog: FRAME and CREDIT should be, as that is more precisely discovered in the editing
dialog: process. Thus:)
text: ESTABLISHING SHOT -- The busy streets of Metropolis on a typical weekday
text: morning. Hustle and bustle, PEDESTRIANS and vehicles. It's nine-o'clock and
text: people are on their way to work. As theme music continues, the sequence begins.
text: 1.	Coming out the front door of a building is an absolute knockout of a GIRL:
text: voluptuous, sexy, young, and healthy. Her every step casues a series of mind-
text: boggling ripples. She is seemingly oblivious to the effect she has on passers-
dialog: by. About 25 years old, this is somebody we will be seeing much more of later.
speaker_heading: LORELEI AMBROSIA.
text: 2.	As she walks AWAY FROM CAMERA, her rear end reminding us of the proverbial
text: puppies fighting in a sack, a GUY walking down the street from the opposite
text: direction turns to ogle at her and therefore doesn't look where he's going. He
text: bumps into a table-top tray of TOY WIND-UP PENGUINS being sold by a VENDOR. The
text: PENGUINS, about 20 of them, go waddling off in different directions up and down
dialog: the street.
text: 3.	A split-second later, a MAN IN A CAP, also walking in the opposite
text: direction, comes abreast of LORELEI, turns to look at her, doesn't see that
text: right in front of him (he's near the curb) is a street-sign post. He slams into
dialog: it face first.
text: 4. Clutching his smashed nose, he recoils backwards with a great lurch, banging
dialog: full-
text: force into a GIRL ON ROLLER SKATES.
text: 5.	Knocked off balance, wobbling erratically, she swerves and srashes into a
text: hot dog wagon on the corner of the street. Standing there, buying a morning
text: snack, is the DAILY PLANET photographer and cub reporter JIMMY OLSEN, on his way
text: to the office. The HOT DOG VENDOR has put a frank on a bun and os about to
text: squirt the mustard on it when the ROLLER SKATER crashes into the hot dog wagon.
text: The mustard squirts on Jimmy's face instead and the wagon goes rolling away with
dialog: considerable momentum.
text: 6.	On the corner of the next street are three telephone booths, side by side.
text: In each booth is a CALLER. The LAST CALLER, A WOMAN, holds onto a leash, which
text: dangles outside her phone booth. On the end of this leash is a LITTLE DOG,
text: waiting patiently outside while his mistress talks on the phoneinside. The hot
text: dog wagon, picking up speed, hits the first phone booth with considerable
dialog: impact.
text: 7. Causing a domino effect: the first booth tips over, with the GUY still inside
text: it. and hits the second booth, tipping it and its OCCUPANT over, and that in
text: turn knocks over the third booth, causing the LADY inside to lose her grip on
text: the leash. Immediately the LITTLE DOG, startled by the crash, goes charging off
text: down the street, trailing his leash.
text: 8. Further down the street is a BLIND MAN holding the handle of the harness
text: attached to his SEEING-EYE DOG stands in a doorway. As the LITTLE DOG comes
text: running by, the SEEING-EYE DOG gets excited and pulls free of his MASTER,
text: chasing the other DOG. Startled, the BLIND MAN staggers out into the street,
dialog: feeling for his DOG, just as:
text: 9. A AWHITE-LINE ROAD PAINTER workman is coming down the avenue, holding the
text: handle of his motorized line-painting machine, which he is guiding precisely
text: down the center of the street, painting, AS WE SEE a straight white line. He is
text: distracted by the CHARGING DOGS and lets go of his machine momentarily. A moment
text: later, the BLIND MAN staggers out into the road, reaches out and grasps what
text: feels exactly like the handle of his Seeing-eye Dog harness. It ain't. It's the
text: line-painting machine.
text: 10. Which now continues down the road guided by a BLIND MAN, and the white line
text: being painted curves, zig-zags, and bends so that any motorist trying to follow
dialog: it would go berserk.
text: 11. In the meantime, strolling down a side-street, with the characteristically
text: springing step, affable smile for the world, neat suit, hat, and glasses comes
text: none other than CLARK KENT. He suddenly jumps back as the LITTLE DOG comes
text: whizzing by and instinctively reaches down with super-speed to grab the leash.
text: This he does, but if the leash stops, the DOG doesn't. Instead the leash pulls
text: free of the collar, leaving a bemused CLARK standing there holding an empty
dialog: leash.
text: 12. The DOGS whiz by the MAN IN THE CAP (fellow who keeps banging into things
text: and getting hurt). As he leaps back to avoid them, he falls into an open
dialog: manhole.
text: 13. In the middle of the street, the white-line maker "guided" by the BLIND MAN,
text: is heading for the area of the street where the open manhole is. The BLIND MAN
text: loses control of the white-line painter and is about to step into the open hole,
dialog: when:
text: 14. The now-capless bald head of the MAN IN THE CAP emerges from the manhole,
text: just in time for the BLIND MAN to step right on it (like	a man crossing a
text: pond by stepping on the stones). The BLIND MAN, busy whistling for his missing
text: dog, never noticed how near to disaster he came, but the bald head of the poor
text: MAN IN THE CAP is now imprinted with a black sole marl.
text: 15. The white-line roller, with nobody steering it, crashes into a little
text: barrier that has been set up on the other side of the open manhole. Customary
text: smudge pots mark the barrier. The white-line roller hits a smudge pot.
text: 16. The smudge pot goes rolling across the gutter, stops. From another direction
text: comes one of those TOY PENGUINS. It hits the smudge pot and is immediately set
text: on fire by the flame.
text: 17. The now flaming PENQUIN continues walking across the street, towards a
text: newspaper stand. Stacked on the curb beside it are a bundle of as-yet-unopened
text: newspapers. The burning toy comes to a stop against the stack, which begins to
dialog: smoulder.
text: 18. Further down the street is a bank. And just at this moment, running out of
text: the bank, a gun in one hand, a sack of stolen money in the other, comes a BANK
text: ROBBER. A BANK GUARD races from the bank and gives chase. The BANK ROBBER
dialog: doesn't see:
text: 19. A MAN removing a ladder (the kind which hooks onto clamps from the side of a
text: van truck). As the MAN and ladder turn, the ladder hook grabs the ROBBER'S
text: hands. The MAN WITH THE LADDER, never realizing what he has done, swings round
text: 180 degrees with the ladder and the money bag is pulled off the ladder by:
text: 20. The wires of a scaffold where some BUILDING REPAIRMEN stand, just about to
text: go up the side of a building. A second after the sack is deposited on the
text: platform, the scaffold starts to rise.
text: 21. The BANK GUARD fires at the ROBBER, but his shot misses and hits the
text: windshield of a passing car. The windshield shatters and the DRIVER crashes into
text: a fire hydrant on the curb.
text: 22. Water gushes out of the hydrant, filling up the interior of the car like a
text: goldfish bowl, the DRIVER trapped inside.
text: 23. Across the street, the flaming newspapers have set the entire kiosk on fire.
text: 24. Hearing the screams and shouts, CLARK KENT looks down the street and sees
text: what's happening. Quickly, he looks around for a place to metamorphose sees
dialog: none.
text: 25. HE dashes down the street, pausing for a regretful look at the three phone
text: booths on their sides (no way for him there). He spots an open storefront with
text: one of those Photomat Booths inside, enters it, behind the curtain. We hear a
text: coin drop in the slot; the OCCUPIED sign goes on; the lights flash. A moment
text: later, bursting out of the booth. . . SUPERMAN!
text: 26. He's just about to take off, when he does an "Oops!" as he remembers: the
text: four photos drop into the receptacle. AS he turns to go back and get them, a KID
text: wanders by and SUPERMAN grabs them out of his hand. ON THE PHOTOS: They show the
text: change. PHOTO 1" Clark. 2. Clark with glasses off, shirt unbuttoned. 3. Further
text: along. 4. SUPERMAN. Quickly he tears off the fourth picture and hands it to the
text: astonished KID.
text: 27. SUPERMAN lands on top of the car . . . now totally filled with water.
text: Quickly, he rips open the sun roof, reaches inside and hauls the soggy DRIVER
text: out. Then, jumping to the ground, he lifts the car off the hydrant, sets it
text: down, then jams the broken hydrant back into the sidewalk, thereby stopping the
text: gushing water.
text: 28. Across the street, the kiosk is engulfed in flames. SUPERMAN lifts the car,
text: flies across the street with it and turns it upside down over the fire. The
text: water gushes out and douses the flames.
text: 29. JIMMY OLSEN, watching from the sidewalk, sheers:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Way to go, Superman!
text: 30. Up high on the outside of the building, the WORKERS on the scaffold turn to
dialog: look
text: down at what's happening on the street. ONE OF THEM kicks the sack of money over
text: the side as he turns to look.
text: 31. In the playground of the park on the next street, a YOUNG MOTHER (or a
text: NANNY) lifts a little TODDLER from a baby carriage and sets him on one of end of
text: a see-saw. Now she starts to walk around it to the other end so that she can
text: give the little fellow a gentle see-saw ride. But before she gets there, the
text: falling money bag lands full force on the (up) end of the see-saw.
text: 32. Which causes the other end to fly upwards, catapulting the TODDLER straight
text: up in the air. The YOUNG MOTHER screams.
text: 33. The BABY lands in the topmost branches of a tree and howls.
text: 34. SUPERMAN sees the problem, flies down and rescues the TODDLER. He hands him
text: to the YOUNG MOTHER and flies off.
text: 35. THE TWO PAINTERS are on a scaffold, about two stories up on the side of a
text: building. One of them turns abruptly as he spots SUPERMAN flying by:
speaker_heading: FIRST PAINTER
speaker_heading: (to CO-WORKER)
dialog: Mike, looks who's here!
text: And as he turns, he inadvertently licks over one can of paint on its side,
dialog: Paint slowly
text: starts to drip out and over the side.
text: 36. QUICK PAN DOWN TO STREET LEVEL BELOW WHERE WE LOOK through
text: the window of a posh Art Gallery. Inside, a DIGNIFIED GENTLEMAN is paying a
text: large sum of money to the OWNER as his purchase, a large oil painting in gilt
text: frame, is being moved toward the door by the GALLERY WORKERS.
text: 37. The DIGNIFIED GENTLEMAN exits the gallery first. As he steps out, the first
text: drops of paint from the tipped-over paint can above starts to fall. He
text: automatically opens his umbrella at the first sign of falling moisture.
text: 38. After a pause, there seems to be no more precipitation. He closes up his
text: umbrella. A second later, the entire can of paint falls on his head.
text: 39. He reels backwards from the blow and crashes into a penny gumball machine on
text: the sidewalk (outside an adjacent candy store).
text: 40. The gumball machine crashes to the ground, the glass globe breaks and a
text: hundred little gumballs roll onto the sidewalk.
text: 41. Way down the street, the BANK ROBBER is fleeing from the pursuing BANK
text: GUARD, constantly looking over his shoulder to see if he's gaining on him.
text: 42. On the other side of the art gallery, PATRONS in a sidewalk café are being
text: entertained by one of those STREET PERFORMERS seen everywhere lately . . . a
text: second-rate Marcel Marceau, i.e. a white-faced, black leotard-garbed MIME. The
text: MIME is doing the classic routine of a man climbing a hill against a strong
text: wind. He doesn't see the gumballs rolling toward him until it is too late.
text: Desperately trying to maintain his routine, his feet start going out of control,
text: faster and faster. he loses balance completely and falls ungracefully on his
dialog: ass.
text: 43. The BANK ROBBER dashes down the street, COPS giving chase, and trips on the
text: fallen MIME. The sudden halting of his rapid forward motion sends him falling
dialog: straight forward just as:
text: 44. The oil painting is being carried out of the gallery to a nearby car. The
text: BAN KROBBER goes head-first right through the painting.
text: 45. On the other side of the painting, a TEENAGER dribbling a basketball is
text: knocked down by the ROBBER. The basketball bounces and goes flying through the
dialog: air.
text: 46. It lands in the cooker of a Hot Fog Wagon, which has finally come to a stop
text: against the side of a building. The heat causes the basketball to swell . . .
dialog: and swell . . .
text: 47. CLARK KENT, in civvies again, comes out of a doorway.
text: 48. ON THE BASKETBALL which swells to the bursting point and explodes. Pieces of
text: rubber and strings of hot-dogs go flying into the air.
text: 49. On street level, LORELEI AMBROSIA comes jiggling down the street, still
text: having no idea of the events she set in motion.
text: 50. Ahead of her, halfway down the block, a panel truck, its doors open, is
text: parked in front of a bakery. A DELIVERY MAN emerges from the bakery, carrying a
text: tray of custard pies.
text: 51. The bakery's DELIVERY MAN doesn't see the hot dogs rolling on the sidewalk.
text: He steps on them, trips. This causes:
text: 52. A custard pie to fly up into the air, heading right for the unsuspecting
text: kisser of LORELEI, who is walking the other way.
text: 53. CLARK spots what is about to happen and, with a very deft move, slides in
text: front of the momentarily startled girl and, in the same motion, reaches one hand
text: up and catches the pie neatly just when it was inches away from her face. Still
text: in one smooth motion, CLARK whisks it away and out of sight like a very clever
text: waiter, as LORELEI, who never noticed, continues on.
text: 54. What CLARK doesn't notice, though, is the bruised battered MAN IN THE CAP
text: who turns the corner exactly at this second and walks smack-on right into the
text: custard pie in CLARK'' outstretched hand.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Oh! Sorry about that.
text: 55. As the MAN IN THE CAP stands there wiping pie off his face, CLARK steps to
dialog: the
text: curb and waits for the light to change so he can cross.
text: 56. NEW ANGLE -- A big truck comes down the street. There's a large puddle on
text: the gutter, the residue of an early morning rain. The curbside tires run through
text: the water, causing it to splash CLARK. AS the big splash hits him, this is THE
scene_heading: FINAL FREEZE FRAME and the FINAL (DIRECTOR'S) CREDIT.
text: ON CLARK -- He looks down in mild dismay. His pant legs are soaking wet.
text: Quickly, he turns and walks into the park entrance. FOLLOW HIM as he sits down
text: on an unoccupied bench. Trying not to call attention to himself, he opens his
text: newspaper, pretends to read it. It is today's DAILY PLANET.
text: CLOSER ON CLARK -- He looks around to make sure nobody is noticing him. Nobody
text: is. Satisfied, he raises his glasses and looks down at his wet pants.
text: EFFECTS: The red rays of Heat Vision emanate from his eyes, aims at his pants
text: as he extends his legs on the park bench. In a second, the pants are magically
text: dries and re-pleated.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Neatness counts.
text: Satisfied, he continues to walk to work.
text: As CLARK walks OUT OF FRAME, PAN UP to the second floor of a small building, the
text: kind where there's a store on the ground floor and a few offices above it. PAN
text: STOPS on the window, on which is lettered:
scene_heading: ARCHIBALD DATA PROCESSING SCHOOL
scene_heading: INT. DATA PROCESSING SCHOOL ROOM - DAY
text: A bunch of students are clustered around INSTRUCTORS, who sits at the keyboard
text: of a small computer, demonstrating.
speaker_heading: FIRST STUDENT
dialog: But what if you want to program two
dialog: bilateral coordinates at the same time?
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR
dialog: You can't. It's impossible.
speaker_heading: FIRST STUDENT
dialog: Computer technology is quite advanced,
dialog: young man, but it can't do that.
text: A voice from the assembled students is heard:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (hesitantly)
dialog: Uh. . .
text: The GROUP parts to reveal GUS GORMAN. HE mumbles and reaches over to the
text: keyboard. H punches some buttons while the INSTRUCTOR looks on with a
text: patronizing smile. Suddenly the INSTUCTOR'S expression changes to one of
dialog: astonishment.
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR
dialog: Good Lord! How did you do that?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: Just did it, that's all.
scene_heading: EXT. DAIILY PLANET - DAY
text: ESTABLISHING SHOT of the office building.
scene_heading: INT. PERRY WHITE'S OFFICE - DAY
text: INSERT -- On a 8 x 10 photograph laying on a desktop. It shows a handsome MAN
text: in his mid-40's, wearing black tie, standing up at a formal dais table, holding
text: a plaque. A captain of industry who has taken pains to present himself as a
dialog: "regular guy," this is ROSS WEBSTER.
text: As CAMERA studies this photo, we hear the voice of PERRY WHITE asking:
speaker_heading: PERRY (o.s.)
dialog: Who's this?
speaker_heading: JIMMY (o.s.)
dialog: That's him, Ross Webster. This was just
dialog: after they presented him with the award
dialog: for Humanitarian of the Year.
speaker_heading: LOIS (o.s.)
dialog: Good-looking.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (o.s.)
dialog: That's because I gave him f.2 at a 50th.
text: FULL SHOT -- Three PEOPLE are in PERRY'S office, looking at photographs spread
text: out on a table. Shirtsleeves rolled up, tie knot loosened -- that's PERRY WHITE.
text: Surrounded by a great many shiny, chic shopping bags and looking particularly
text: fetching and cheerful today is LOIS LANE. Displaying the photos is JIMMY OLSEN.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Olsen, there's one thing I don't
dialog: understand. The point of the story
dialog: Lois wrote is how the Ross Webster
dialog: got this great honor. You bring me one
dialog: photograph of him and fifteen pictures
dialog: of this person!
text: As he says this, he points to a bunch of other photos on the desk:
text: ON THE PHOTOS -- They are various shots of the same GIRL whose wiggle caused
text: all the chaos on the streets before: LORELEI AMBROSIA. She is seated at the
text: banquet dais in a low cut gown. As we SEE these, PERRY'S speech continues:
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Who is she?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's
dialog: Webster's Girl Friday.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: Oh, I think Saturday, too.
text: NEW ANGLE -- As PERRY takes another photo from the pile and studies it.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Who's the other woman?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: That's his sister. Vera Webster.
speaker_heading: PERRY
text: The picture looks blurry.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: The picture's fine. That's the way
text: she looks in real life.
text: INSERT: ON THE PHOTO -- Showing a no-nonsense, severe-looking woman in
text: her late 40's. This is Ross' older, spinster sister: Vera Webster.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (o.s.)
dialog: She's vice-president of Webco
dialog: Industries.
speaker_heading: ON THEM
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: You're amazing, Olsen. A boring
dialog: banquet and you bring back 3,000
text: boring pictures. Then Superman puts
dialog: out a fire on Third Avenue this morning
dialog: and you stand there and watch the whole
dialog: thing and you don't take one picture!!
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I didn't have my camera with me.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: (exasperated)
text: A photographer eats with his camera,
text: A Photographer sleeps with his camera --
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: Glad I'm a writer.
text: At which point, the door opens and a grumpy, middle-aged WOMAN enters, pushing a
text: bizarre object on wheels before her. The WOMAN is MISS HENDERSON from
text: Circulation Department. The thing she pushes is one of those revolving drum
text: Bingo machines with a hand crank on the side that turns a cog, which makes the
text: hundreds of little white plastic balls churn about until one of them falls into
text: the chute. Attached to it is a big promotional sign, which reads:
dialog: "JINGO! Daily Planet Big
dialog: Prize Bingo, by JINGO!!"
text: From this ANGLE we can SEE that in the adjacent office, behind the glass, is a
text: bulletin board with JINGO written over it and a MAN waiting in there.
speaker_heading: MISS HENDERSON
dialog: Mr. White, please, it's time for you
dialog: to draw this month's winning JINGO
dialog: number.
speaker_heading: (to LOIS)
dialog: The prize is an all-expenses trip to
dialog: South America.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: Why can't the idiot in Circulation who
dialog: dreamed up this imbecile contest in the
dialog: first place ---
speaker_heading: MISS HENDERSON
dialog: Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your
dialog: integrity is unquestioned.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: I have a question.
text: Suddenly coming through the door is CLARK KENT, almost tripping over the
text: shopping bags around LOIS.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got
dialog: mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White,
dialog: I don't mean to interrupt but ---
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put
dialog: out a newspaper here.
text: And he starts cranking the Bingo machine.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: It'll never replace the printing press,
dialog: boss.
speaker_heading: MISS HENDERSON
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: What's the number, Mr. White?
text: CLOSER ANGLE -- PERRY pries apart the plastic ball; it splits into two half-
text: spheres. Inside is a folded piece of paper. He removes it, unfolds it, reads it.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: (unenthusiastically)
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: MISS HENDERSON
dialog: (calling out in piercing
dialog: tones to the next office)
dialog: 53!
text: SEEN THROUGH THE GLASS DIVIDER" THE MAN in the next room tacks the number 53 up
dialog: on the board.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Okay? Goodbye.
speaker_heading: MISS HENDERSON
dialog: You've got to pick three more numbers.
text: Furiously, PERRY starts to crank the machine again.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Mr. White, please, I promised those people
dialog: I'd get back to them by this morning. What
dialog: do you think?
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Look, I don't know, Kent. . .
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (pitching hard)
dialog: Personally, I think it could be a terrific
dialog: story!
text: C.U. LOIS -- Accusingly, as if she were being robbed of an assignment.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: What terrific story?
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Kent's been invited to his high-school
dialog: class reunion.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: Whoopee.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (fired up)
dialog: It's practically an American ritual,
dialog: Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the
dialog: people I went to high school with are still
dialog: in high school.
speaker_heading: MISS HENDERSON
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: Could we have the next number already?
text: PERRY stops cranking, another ball falls out, and he opens it.
speaker_heading: MISS HENDERSON
dialog: (hollering out)
dialog: 33!
text: The GUY in the next room puts up 33.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (won't be stopped)
dialog: Anyway, the reunion's just the hook
dialog: for the story. What it's really about is
dialog: how the typical small town's changed
dialog: in the last fifteen years. how do you
dialog: like this a title: Can You Go Home
dialog: Again ?
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: Say!
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (not picking up
dialog: the put-on)
dialog: Take me, for instance. Going back to
dialog: middle America after having become
dialog: a Metropolis sophisticate --
text: C.U. LOIS -- She looks at CLARK fondly, but she can't quite buy that self-
dialog: description.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (brightly)
dialog: I'm really excited about this. I even --
text: He opens his briefcase, pulls out a neatly folded maroon wool pullover.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: -- I was looking through my closet last
dialog: and, sure enough, O found my old
dialog: high school sweater.
text: FULL ON HIM as he unfolds it and holds it proudly in front of his chest. In the
text: middle of it, right where the Superman monogram is located, is a big white block
dialog: letter "S".
text: ON PERRY, LOIS AND JIMMY looking at him.
text: ON CLARK -- He points to the "S".
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (explaining)
dialog: Smallville.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
speaker_heading: MISS HENDERSON
dialog: (whiney, nudging)
dialog: Mr. White!
text: Scowling like mad, PERRY cranks the handle again.
speaker_heading: PERRY
text: I'm getting a cramp in my elbow
dialog: from this.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (helpfully as ever)
dialog: Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
text: With characteristic over-enthusiasm, CLARK starts to crank the handle too
dialog: rapidly.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (eagerly)
dialog: So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and
dialog: make my travel arrangements?
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: Exactly what I was about to ask
dialog: about me.
text: Suddenly, the handle breaks off the drum due to CLARK'S over-exertion. He stands
text: there with egg on his face and crank in hand.
speaker_heading: MISS HENDERSON
dialog: Do you know what that machine cost?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Uh. . . sorry --
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: All right, Kent. I just hope you know what
dialog: you're doing. If you really think Smallville
dialog: is your big chance, go for it.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What about me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: What about you?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: A story like this cries out for great human
dialog: interest pictures.
dialog: (envisioning them)
dialog: The big dance! The Homecoming Game!
text: Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that
dialog: one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use
text: black and white.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Okay, Kent, call your people and tell
text: them the Prodigal Son is coming home.
text: FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but
dialog: we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
speaker_heading: PERRY (o.s.)
dialog: I just hope you realize, it's not easy
dialog: losing my top reporter --
text: Beaming at the unexpected compliment, CLARK turns back just as:
speaker_heading: FULL SHOT
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: -- but you deserve the vacation, Lois.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Oh. You're going away.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: (kidding, with a grin)
dialog: Yeah, well, some of us get to go to
dialog: Smallville. And some of us just have
dialog: to settle for . . .
text: She reaches into one of the shopping bags and pulls out the world's teeniest,
dialog: tiniest bikini.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: . . . Bermuda.
text: CLARK'S eyes widen at the image that comes to his mind.
speaker_heading: MISS HENDERSON
dialog: (impatient)
dialog: Mr. White, the next number, please?
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
speaker_heading: MISS HENDERSON
dialog: (demonstrating, she tumbles
dialog: the drum over by hand)
dialog: By hand. Like the pioneers did.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Couldn't we just get a computer to
dialog: do this?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. COMPUTER ROOM - WEBCO - DAY
scene_heading: CAMERA DOLLIES THROUGH TWO GLASS DOORS (POV A ROLLING CART ENTERING THE ROOM).
text: WE SEE THE WORDS STENCILED ON THE DOOR:
scene_heading: WEBCO INDUSTRIES - DATA PROCESSING CENTER
text: The room we ENTER is one of those enormous computer centers. Along the walls are
text: the massive data consoles, their tape decks alternately rolling and stopping.
text: Other machines extrude massive print-outs. In the center of the room are desks,
text: one after another, with small table-top computer consoles, the sort that are
text: operated from a keyboard. VARIOUS WORKERS are seen doing their jobs, including
text: the ones operating the keyboard computers. They move rapidly around in a curious
text: and unique fashion: each WORKER sits on a chair that has ball bearing wheels and
text: they propel themselves from terminal to terminal by skittering around without
text: leaving their chairs. To facilitate this action, they all wear white tennis
dialog: shoes, which grips the floor for maximum purchase. The impression we get is one
text: of robot-like humans zipping around from machine to machine.
text: WIDE SHOT, REVERSE -- Revealing that the rolling cart which took us into the
text: room is pushed by an EMPLOYEE who stops at each desk and hands each person an
dialog: envelope . . . it's payday and they're getting their paychecks. As we DOLLY BACK
text: we SEE in F.G. two desks, side by side, with a keyboard console with video
text: display on each. One of them is manned by our friend with the matchbook: GUS
text: GORMAN. Across the aisle is his fellow-worker, FRED.
text: The MAN handing out the checks stops at GUS' desk, gives him his.
text: GUS takes the envelope, opens it, as FRED gets the same and the cart continues
dialog: on.
text: CLOSE ON GUS -- He looks in astonished dismay at his check.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Sonofagun! Look at this here!
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: First paycheck?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225
dialog: bucks a week! You know what this sucker
dialog: says?? $143.80!
dialog: (reading it, angry)
dialog: Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: That's so you're still getting some money
dialog: when you hit 65.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (gets up, starts to walk)
dialog: I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80!
dialog: I want it now, man, while I'm still young
dialog: and cool.
scene_heading: INT. EMPLOYEES' CAFETERIA - DAY
text: GUS and FRED enter the cafeteria, continuing their conversation. TRACK WITH
text: THEM, as they walk down to the coffee machine. GUS mutters and works hi yo-yo
dialog: with no success.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Actually, it's probably more like $143.80
dialog: and one-half cent.
dialog: (GUS gives him a
dialog: puzzled look)
dialog: There's always fractions over in a big
dialog: corporation, but they round it down to
dialog: the lowest whole number.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: What'm I gonna do with half a cent?
dialog: Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?
dialog: (pause; he starts to
dialog: think about it)
dialog: Everybody loses them fractions?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose
dialog: what you never got.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Who gets it, the company?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: No, not really. They can't be bothered
dialog: collecting half a cent from your paycheck
dialog: anymore than you could.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: So where is all them half-centses?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: They're just . . . floating around out
dialog: there. The computer knows where.
dialog: C.U. GUS -- lost in thought
text: NEW ANGLE -- By now they've reached the coffee urn. FRED pulls the lever and
text: fills two cups, reaches for the bowl of sugar cubes.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: How many sugars?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: One.
text: (pause. As FRED drops
dialog: one in the cup)
dialog: And a half.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. WEBCO COMPUTER ROOM - TWILIGHT
text: WIDE SHOT -- The end of the day. Employees putting on their coats, changing from
text: the white sneakers into normal street shoes, leaving, saying good-night, etc.
text: ON GUS -- Seated at his keyboard, a faintly manic gleam in his eyes. HE stares
text: at the video display screen, his fingers brushing the keys.
text: NEW ANGLE -- FRED puts on his jacket, gets ready to leave.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to
dialog: finish up here.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: (archly)
dialog: Workin' overtime? What are you
dialog: doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (almost to himself)
dialog: Yeah. A raise . .
text: FRED shakes his head, turns, and leaves.
text: LONG SHOT -- the data processing center is empty of PEOPLE now. Just the
text: computers and GUS.
text: MED. CLOS ON GUS -- he takes his paycheck out of the envelope again and looks
text: closely at it.
text: INSERT -- ON THE UPPER RIGHT CORNER OF THE CHECK is a short sequence of numbers
dialog: and letters.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (repeating them aloud)
dialog: 368zzx4.
text: TIGHT ANGLE -- he punches those numbers and letters on his keyboard.
text: ON THE VIDEO DISPLAY -- the numbers and letters appear on the screen. Then, a
dialog: moment later:
speaker_heading: HELLO.
scene_heading: WEBCO PAYROLL DIVISION.
scene_heading: GIVE COMMAND COORDINATES.
text: ON GUS -- a broad grin.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (a man who sees the future
dialog: opening before him)
dialog: Yeah !
text: He begins to punch coordinates into the keyboard.
text: In a QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS, WE SEE VARIOUS COMPUTERS OF DIFFERENT TYPES, IN
text: DIFFERENT LOCATION as they begin to flash, and/or light up and/or turn their
dialog: memory bank tapes and/or beep and/or do other 'computer stuff'. The effect is to
text: clearly indicate that what GUS is doing is having a result, that his computer is
dialog: activating other.
scene_heading: EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: MED. LONG SHOT -- A Greyhound bus is travelling down a two-lane highway, which
text: runs alongside a woodsy, rural area.
scene_heading: INT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT
text: A lot of the PASSENGERS are sleeping. A few read by the little individual
text: overhead lights. Perhaps a couple cuddling in the back seat. Seated side by side
text: toward the rear of the bus are CLARK and JIMMY. CLARK is half-dozing and trying
text: to seem interested in what is obviously an interminable story that JIMMY is
dialog: telling him.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: But my Uncle Al, on my father's side,
dialog: he won't eat her stuffing, he says it
dialog: should be cooked on the outside of the
text: turkey and she puts the stuffing inside
dialog: the turkey. So my mother told my
dialog: Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's
dialog: half-sister, I told you that, right?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Mmmmm . . .
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: The thing is though, my cousin Arnold,
dialog: Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad
dialog: when Uncle Al insulted his mother's
dialog: stuffing, so now the problem is --
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (suddenly alert,
dialog: looking forward)
dialog: What's that?
text: POV: LOOKING FORWARD DOWN THE AILSE -- The bus has stopped. Out the windshield
text: we SEE a red glow on the horizon that lights up the sky.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT -- CLARK AND JIMMY
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: At one o'clock in the morning?
text: CLOSER ON THE WINDSHIELD -- We now SEE police cars with dome lights blocking the
text: road, barrier set up.
scene_heading: EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: A few minutes later. The BUS DRIVER has gotten out to talk to the POLICEMAN
text: blocking the road. CLARK, JIMMY, and some OTHER PASSENGERS have come out of the
dialog: bus also to find out what's happening.
text: Throughout the following, CUT TO VARIOUS ANGLES showing other traffic being
dialog: halted
text: and one lane cleared for emergency vehicles to pass through: ambulances, fire
dialog: trucks, National Guard truck, etc.
speaker_heading: STATE POLICEMAN
dialog: It's your choice. Turn back or pull over
text: to the side of the road till it's over.
speaker_heading: BUS DRIVER
dialog: How long'll that take?
speaker_heading: STATE POLICEMAN
dialog: You never know with forest fires. And
dialog: this one is spreading like . . .
dialog: (he has no choice but
dialog: to finish the sentence
dialog: he started)
dialog: . . . wildfire. We got 10,000 acres of
text: timber going up like matchsticks and
dialog: a south wind.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: What's the south wind got to do with it?
speaker_heading: STATE POLICEMAN
dialog: Iroquois Trail Power Plant is just eight
text: miles south of the fire.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: The nuclear power station?
text: JIMMY turns and runs back onto the bus.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - NIGHT
text: JIMMY grabs his camera from the overhead rack, dashes out again.
scene_heading: EXT. BUS - NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: How did it start?
speaker_heading: STATE POLICEMAN
dialog: Nine times out of ten it's some careless
dialog: camper.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Are there campers trapped in there?
speaker_heading: STATE POLICEMAN
dialog: We're doing our best to get 'em out.
text: JIMMY comes out of the bus, pulls CLARK aside.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Keep talking to that state trooper so he
dialog: doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You know what Mr. White said. A
text: photographer always goes after a story.
text: He starts to sneak off into the nearby forest.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Jimmy, it's dangerous!
text: On JIMMY -- The swashbuckling bravado of a 19 year-old:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Danger? That goes with the territory,
dialog: Mr. Kent.
text: And he ducks into the woods.
text: C.U. CLARK -- making a decision.
text: NEW ANGLE -- As more cars have been stooped, a DRIVER, in F.G. gets out of his
text: car to walk forward toward the barrier to see what's going on. CLARK looks
text: around to make sure nobody is noticing him. Then, quickly, he opens the right-
text: hand side back door of the empty car and enters. A split-second later he emerges
text: from the left-hand side as . . . SUPERMAN! He takes off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST FIRE - NIGHT
text: OVERHEAD SHOTS (STOCK FOOTAGE): A terrific forest fire is raging. Miles and
text: miles of burning trees, rushing winds.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
scene_heading: VARIOUS SHOTS (STOCK FOOTAGE) INSIDE THE FIRES ITSELF ON GROUND LEVEL.
text: 1. Flaming trees, timber crashing.
text: 2. Animals running in panic.
text: 3. Sheets of flame sweeping through woods.
text: Followed by VARIOUS QUICK SHOTS of brave and hard-working FIREFIGHTERS right in
dialog: the thick of it, doing what they can:
text: 1. Spading up the ground with shovels and hoes,
text: trying to create firebreaks.
text: 2. Chain-saws at work bringing down trees to
dialog: to clear area.
text: 3. A portable pump with hose attached drawing
text: water from a small pond or creek in the area.
text: Throughout all this, we have the impression of a blazing inferno of terrific
text: proportions with sheets of flame and sounds of fire and falling trees and
dialog: whipping winds.
scene_heading: EXT. STAGING AREA, FOREST FIRE - NIGHT
text: ESTABLISHING SHOT -- The command post of the firefighting operation. Ambulances
text: with MEDICS ready; fire trucks; hot soup and coffee wagons; EXHAUSTED
text: FIREFIGHTERS getting a break, taking oxygen, drinking coffee, etc; FRESH TROOPS
dialog: putting on their gear.
text: CLOSER-- THE FIRE CHIEF, clad in woodsy rainment, but with a badge denoting his
text: status, stands conferring with his AIDE. He looks haggard, hot, worried. He
text: holds a walkie-talkie. Suddenly, SUPERMAN lands in the area.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: Chief, how can I help?
speaker_heading: FIRE CHIEF
dialog: (calling to assistant)
dialog: Get this man a helmet and a ---
dialog: (suddenly realizes
dialog: who it is)
dialog: Oh! It's you!
dialog: (calling to assistant)
dialog: No helmet!
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: What's the story?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIRE CHIEF
dialog: This is a fierce one, Superman. We've
dialog: got a hundred and twenty men on the
dialog: northeast border building firebreaks. I've
dialog: got volunteers coming in from as far away
dialog: as Ohio. They're doing all they can, but --
text: CAMERA PANS TO SEE EXHAUSTED FIREFIGHTERS, faces covered with soot, sitting on
text: the ground and breathing deeply from oxygen masks, trying to get themselves
dialog: together, as speech continues:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIRE CHIEF (o.s.)
dialog: they're only human.
text: PAN CONINUES TO A NEARBY AREA WHERE WE SEE, coming toward the soup kitchen, a
text: bedraggled and besmirched BOY SCOUT TROOP 9about EIGHT BOYS AND A SCOUT MASTER)
text: who were obviously evacuated from the forest. They are all turning and giving
text: dirty looks to someone who walks a few paces behind them: a LONE BOY SCOUT,
text: looking very forlorn and guilty, holding two fire making sticks and a bow. This
text: is obviously the twerp who started the forest fire in the first place.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN IN THE WOODS - NIGHT
text: In the middle of the forest, a log cabin sits in a clearing. Beside it is one of
text: those butane gas tanks. The fire envelops it.
text: NEW ANGLE -- The butane tank explodes. The cabin explodes. Flames devour it in
dialog: seconds.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST FIRE - NIGHT
text: Leaping out from the tops of the trees, whizzing on the high winds, sparks and
text: fire balls sail through the air.
text: ON AN UNSCHORCHED PART OF THE FOREST -- Fire balls land in a clear area. In
text: VARIOUS ANGLES, WE SEE new fires start up.
text: NEW ANGLE -- as FIREFIGHTERS race into this area and begin flailing away at the
text: fresh brushfires with shovels and picks, trying to extinguish these new fires
dialog: before they really get going.
scene_heading: EXT. WATCH-TOWER, FOREST - NIGHT
text: LONG SHOT -- A wooden tower used for fire-spotting in the middle of the forest.
text: From this distance, we can barely make out that somebody is up there in the
text: tower, standing on the ledge.
text: CLOSER ON THE TOWER -- It's JIMMY OLSEN, who has secured himself a marvelous
text: vantage point for taking photos of the fire.
text: WIDE ANGLE ON THE TOWER--what he doesn't realize is that the flames are creeping
text: up behind the tower and will soon envelop it.
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - NIGHT
text: VARIOUS SHOTS OF FIREFIGHTERS building firebreaks. It is a slow and laborious
text: process. Some MEN chop down trees to clear the break line. Others turn the fresh
text: earth with spades. Others haul the fallen timber out of the way. They work
text: feverishly, but it's hard work and slow going.
text: NEW ANGLE -- SUPERMAN lands in their midst. They're so exhausted they can
text: barely muster up the customary surprise.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: (all business)
dialog: Stand back, guys. Where do you
dialog: want this firebreak?
speaker_heading: CREW LEADER
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: From there to there.
text: FAVORING SUPERMAN as he quickly selects a stout, tall tree. As the MEN watch in
text: astonishment, SUPERMAN grabs the base of the tree and with --
text: EFFECTS: SUPER-STRENGTH (and a bit of super-strain) he pulls the tree out of the
dialog: ground, roots and all.
text: Quickly he hauls it to a clear area and ties a length of cable around it,
text: creating an instant harness for himself.
text: NEW ANGLE -- He throws the cable over his shoulders, hooks his arm in it, and
dialog: begins to race at:
text: EFFECTS: SUPER-SPEED straight through the heavily wooded area. The tree, pulled
text: behind him like a horizontal plow, knocks down all the trees in its path. They
text: fall to either side like so many pick-up sticks.
text: LONG SHOT -- The FIREFIGHTERS stand at the point of his departure and see the
text: instant firebreak being created before their eyes.
text: LONG WIDE ANGLE DOWN (ARIAL SHOT) -- We SEE the firebreak forming, the tall
text: trees crashing down to the ground on either side of the blue speedball that is
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN.
text: ON THE FORMAN OF THE FIREBREAK CREW, who speaks into his walkie-talkie to the
dialog: central command post:
speaker_heading: FORMAN
dialog: Chief, this is the North Boundary Crew.
dialog: We've got a firebreak that should contain
dialog: it on our end.
scene_heading: EXT. COMMAND POST, FOREST - NIGHT
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: (to walkie-talkie)
dialog: It's not going to be that easy on the
text: south side. The winds are blowing
text: fireballs right over the breaks.
scene_heading: EXT. IROQUOIS TRAIL NUCLEAR POWER STATION (TOWERS) - NIGHT
text: ESTABLISHING SHOT -- An icon of our times: the three concrete silos we associate
text: with nuclear energy stations, c.f. Three Mile Island. In the distance, we SEE
text: the glow of the fire.
text: ON THE GATE surrounding the tower closest to the forest. A number of SCIENTISTS,
text: SECURITY MEN, etc. are standing there watching the approaching fire through
text: binoculars. Behind them, we SEE the largest of the towers looming.
text: A very worried PLANT SUPERVISOR puts downs his binoculars and turns to the
text: SECURITY CHIEF standing beside him.
speaker_heading: PLANT SUPERVISOR
dialog: Man, if that fire gets much closer, we're
dialog: going to have ourselves some big trouble.
speaker_heading: SECURITY CHIEF
dialog: The nuclear reactor?
speaker_heading: PLANT SUPERVISOR
dialog: (grimly)
dialog: You figure it out. That --
dialog: (points at tower)
dialog: is a cooling tower, right? The
text: nuclear core inside it is stabilized
dialog: by the temperature. If the fire gets
dialog: here, it'll stop being a cooling
text: tower, and turn into a furnace.
scene_heading: C.U. SECURITY CHIEF
speaker_heading: SECURITY CHIEF
dialog: Oh, my God! You mean a melt-down!
speaker_heading: PLANT SUPERVISOR
dialog: Get the civil defense people on the phone.
dialog: We may have to evacuate the whole damn
dialog: state!
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST, A-FRAME COTTAGE - NIGHT
text: An A-frame summer cottage has been constructed in a clearing in the woods. ANGLE
text: FAVORS the big glass façade of it, one enormous picture window with wood trim.
text: The window reflects the fire coming closer to the house.
text: CLOSER ON THE GLASS as is begins to heat up and distort the image of the
text: encroaching flames. Suddenly, the window buckles and blows out with a terrific
dialog: crash.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST ROAD - NIGHT
scene_heading: MED. LONG SHOT -- HEADING TOWARD CAMERA, a camper trailer (recreational vehicle)
text: is speeding down a dirt road, trying to get to safety. But its back end has
text: already caught on fire.
text: ON THE CAB -- A TERRIFIED DRIVER, HIS WIFE, AND THEIR KID in there.
text: NEW ANGLE -- Finally, as the flames begin to consume more of the vehicle, the
text: DRIVER brakes to a halt. HE and his family run like hell away just before the
text: trailer explodes in a ball of fire.
scene_heading: EXT. COMMAND POST, FOREST - NIGHT
text: The CHIEF looks incredulous at something he's just heard over his walkie-talkie.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: What??!
dialog: (to walkie-talkie)
dialog: How did he get there?
dialog: (to AIDE beside him)
text: Some lunatic is up in the watch-
text: tower taking pictures.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AIDE
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: So that tower's right in the
dialog: middle of pure hell right now!
scene_heading: EXT. WATCHTOWER, FOREST - NIGHT
text: MED. CLOSE ON THE TOP OF THE TOWER -- JIMMY is taking photos, so intent and
text: excited that he doesn't realize what danger he's in.
text: LONG SHOT -- The flames attack the struts of the tower. They start to collapse.
text: The entire tower buckles and topples forward like a man with two (suddenly)
dialog: broken legs.
text: TIGHTER ANGLE -- As it falls. JIMMY is hurled out of the tower onto the ground.
text: ON JIMMY-- He lays there, moaning in pain, clutching his leg (which is broken).
text: Surrounded by fire. Things look very bad for him.
text: ANGLE UP -- Suddenly, SUPERMAN appears walking through a wall of flame. He is
text: unhurt by the fire. He makes his way to the fallen JIMY, lifts him up and flies
text: out of the fire.
scene_heading: EXT. COMMAND POST, AMBULANCES - NIGHT
text: The area of the command post where the ambulances are waiting. DOCTORS, NURSES,
text: MEDICS, etc. stand by.
text: SUPERMAN lands with JIMMY in his arms and gently lays him on one of the
text: stretchers just by the ambulance.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: Easy, Jimmy.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (in pain)
dialog: It's my leg.
text: SUPERMAN looks at Jimmy's leg. We see an X-ray shot of the broken bone.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: (to the MEDIC)
dialog: It's a clean break right across the
dialog: fibula.
text: CUT TO COMMAND POST as a breathless FIREFIGHTER runs up to report to his CHIEF.
speaker_heading: FIREFIGHTER
dialog: The water supply is practically gone!
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: (worried)
dialog: We've got to get water!
speaker_heading: FIREFIGHTER
dialog: How? Lake Comooga is five miles
dialog: from here. We haven't got a five
dialog: mile hose.
text: C.U. SUPERMAN -- as he hears about the problem.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: Where is this lake?
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: (points)
dialog: That way.
text: SUPERMAN immediately flies off in that direction.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE SHORE - NIGHT
text: MED. WIDE SHOT -- SUPERMAN lands at the edge of a lake about 200 yards long and
text: wide. He surveys the expanse of water before him. Then:
text: SPECIAL EFFECTS: He blows a steady gust of ice-breath across the surface of the
text: lake. In moments, the entire surface freezes solid.
text: NEW ANGLE -- He bends down and grasps the edge of the ice cover in his hands.
text: It's about five-inches thick. Slowly, he begins to pull and lift at the same
dialog: time.
text: WIDE SHOT -- The entire platter of ice, the size of the lake, is lifted off the
text: top. Holding it before him, SUPERMAN flies into the sky.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - NIGHT
text: An amazing sight: SUPERMAN FLYING toward the glowing red sky where the forest
text: fire rages, holding the enormous ice platter before him.
text: He arrives over the center of the forest fire. He flings the frozen lake over
text: the fire. As the ice starts to fall, the heat from below melts it and turns in
text: into a tremendous torrent of water.
text: VARIOUS ANGLES -- The melted lake water puts out the major part of the fire.
text: ON THE GROUND, REACTIONS from the FIREFIGHTERS, etc. Total joy and amazement.
scene_heading: EXT. IROQUOIS TRAIL NUCLEAR POWER TOWER - NIGHT
text: The flames have spread to the base of the tower now, licking at the sides. CREWS
text: of WORKERS, SCIENTISTS et al have been hastily organized into firefighting
text: units. They are hosing down the sides of the main tower, trying to cool it.
text: Steam erupts as the water hits the hot concrete.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: It's not going to work! It's too hot
dialog: now!
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - NIGHT
text: SUPERMAN flies at top speed toward the Iroquois Trail towers in B.G.
text: INTERCUT SHOTS of SUPERMAN closer to the familiar silos and FIREFIGHTERS on the
text: ground, trying to hose down the silo and put out the encroaching flames all
dialog: around it.
text: LONG SHOT -- SUPERMAN flies directly into the largest concrete silo.
scene_heading: INT. INNER CHAMBER, NUCLEAR REACTOR - NIGHT
text: Sound: a strident alarm going continuously, a sound of panic.
text: ON A GAUGE -- A needle has zipped into the Red for Danger area and is wobbling
text: wildly at the end of the scale.
text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL a harried SCIENTIST in white coat.
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: It's going right off the end of
dialog: the scale, Dr. Harris!
text: FULL SHOT -- The outer chamber of the reactor. SCIENTISTS at their stations,
text: manning dials. Behind three thick glass shields we SEE into the inner chamber
text: where no man can go. Mechanical robot-arms are controlled from the outer
dialog: chamber.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: Start the emergency cooling
dialog: procedure.
text: CLOSER ON THE WINDOW showing the inner chamber -- all stainless steel and white
text: tile. In the center, on a kind of platform, the nuclear core glows red hot,
text: emanating pulsations of radiation. A fearful thing. It appears to be two
text: cylinders, each about a foot long, and as it approaches destabilization, the two
text: cylinders (one above the other) are moving closer and closer to each other. It
dialog: is clear that if they join it will be irrevocable. Melt-down will occur.
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: It isn't helping! We're about two
dialog: minutes from melt-down!
text: Suddenly, SUPERMAN lands inside the chamber.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: Superman!
dialog: (talking though intercom)
dialog: Be careful! There's enough radiation
dialog: in that core to light up the whole
dialog: country for a year!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: Don't worry. I'll just stabilize it.
text: CLOSER -- SUPERMAN grasps the red-hot cylinders. A fleeting expression on his
dialog: face lets us know the even he finds this pretty hot stuff. Slowly, with great
text: caution and great power, he pulls the two cylinders apart further and further,
text: back into their housing.
text: ON THE GAGE -- The needle drops back to NORMAL.
text: Sound: the alarm that has been ringing suddenly quits.
text: REACTIONS -- Incredible relief from the SCIENTISTS. Mopping their brows, etc.
text: SUPERMAN smile to the scientists and flies up and out of the silo.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: (in wonderment)
dialog: It isn't very scientific, gentlemen,
dialog: but I tell you that man is a miracle.
scene_heading: EXT. SMALLVILLE HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT
text: C.U. (PROFILE) of a very little OLD LADY: ancient, now-retired teacher MINNIE
text: BANISTER, peering at the shirt and tie on a chest, which is exactly at her eye
text: level. As she cranes her neck upwards to address the head on top of this body
dialog: and says:
speaker_heading: MINNIE BANNISTER
dialog: You really have grown, Clark.
text: WE PAN UP WITH HER GAZE to REVEAL CLARK KENT smiling gently down at her.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: You're looking well, Miss
dialog: Bannister.
text: WIDER -- The gym is decorated: crepe paper, balloons, posters, colored lights,
text: and blow-ups of the old black and white graduation photos of the alumni,
text: including one of the series, studios, bespectacled young CLARK KENT, mixed with
dialog: standard yearbook shots of the great moments of the class of '65 (big games,
dialog: Senior Prom, production of 'Our Town,' etc.).
text: Surrounded by COUPLES dancing tot he strains of Golden Oldies from their high
text: school era, CLARK continues to make polite chat with MINNIE BANNISTER until,
text: suddenly, he focuses on something across the room.
text: CLARK'S POV: Across the room, a YOUNG WOMAN about his age has just entered the
text: gym, carrying a stack of records in one arm and a stack of paper plates in the
text: other. Red-haired and very pretty in an all-American way, LANA LANG seems like
text: the kind of girl who would instantly be surrounded by friends and admirers.
text: Oddly, she's not. In fact, she is the only woman here without a mate or even a
text: date. As if to platy down her aloneness, she instantly gets busy, quickly
text: checking the refreshments and adjusting a loose decoration. But then, as she
text: picks up her plates and records again and turns to CAMERA she sees, through the
text: spaces between dancing COUPLES, something that makes her stop. And smile.
text: C.U. LANA -- Her eyes sparkling with delight as she mimes the word to him:
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Clark?
text: C.U. CLARK -- A warm smile for her as he too mouths her name:
speaker_heading: CLARK
speaker_heading: LANA?
text: As we are SEEING all this interplay, we are at the same time hearing:
speaker_heading: MINNIE BANNISTER (o.s.)
dialog: I can't complain. Oh, I take the
dialog: stairs a bit slower these days, and
dialog: of course I get theses spells, but
dialog: I can't complain...
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Will you excuse me, Miss Bannister?
dialog: There's someone I really have to say
dialog: hello to.
text: NEW ANGLE -- FULL SHOT as they make their way to each other.
dialog: CLOSER -- There's a lot of unspoken past history between CLARK and LANA. Indeed,
dialog: he had a serious crush on her during all his young years and she knew it even if
dialog: she didn't acknowledge it then. Now, fifteen years later, they are very glad to
dialog: see each other	 again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Lana Lang. How great to see you.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Clark.
text: She suddenly leans forward and kisses him on the cheek.
dialog: (A NOTE ON LANA LANG: Lana is one of these people, who, both by nature and by
text: exigencies of her situation, seems to be carrying on three conversations at once
dialog: and often doing two or three different tasks at once. Although such people seem
text: perfectly clear in their own minds about the direction their thoughts are going
text: in, it's often confusing and disconcerting to others. As Lana is often keeping
text: three conversation balls in the air simultaneously, Clark is hardput to keep up
text: with her, getting lost in the conversation, thinking she means one thing, when
text: in fact she's gone on to another subject. The effect is comical for us, a bit
text: unsettling for him, and should finally be genuinely charming and adorable in his
text: eyes. In the dialogue as written, Lana's separate thoughts are indicated by
text: breaks and indications, but in performance they should run right into each other
dialog: non-stop).
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: You look wonderful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: You always did.
dialog: (indicating plates
dialog: and dishes)
dialog: Can I give you a hand with that?
text: They start walking toward the buffet table. TRACK WITH THEM.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: No, I can mange, This is the first
dialog: time you've been back since your
dialog: mom passed away, isn't it?
dialog: (as he nods)
dialog: I can't believe it.
text: TRACK WITH THEM.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: No, I can mange, This is the first
dialog: time you've been back since your
dialog: mom passed away, isn't it?
dialog: (as he nods)
dialog: I can't believe it. You came all the
dialog: way from Metropolis just for this
dialog: dinky little reunion?
dialog: They stop.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: You shouldn't say that, you're the
dialog: chairman --
dialog: (uncertainly)
dialog: ...uh, chairperson...
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (struck by the thought)
dialog: And here I am, just standing
dialog: here. That's terrible. Thank you.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (confused)
dialog: You're welcome...??
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: For reminding me, I mean. Can
dialog: you follow me?
text: She changes direction, starts to walk toward the music area where a D.J. has a
text: record player set up.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: I'm trying to.
text: He follows her. As they reach the TEENAGE D.J.:
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: I just have to give these to
dialog: the --
text: Smiling at CLARK, she doesn't realize she setting the paper plates, not records,
text: down by the D.J.'s set-up. The D.J. is about to protest, but LANA has already
text: turned away and walks briskly to the nearby buffet table again.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: I heard you and Donald split
dialog: up.
text: LANA seems not to hear him as she sets the stack of records down on the buffet
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Did you eat yet?
text: She grabs a record off the top of the stack, scoops up a ladleful of potato
text: salad, sees suddenly that she's just about to dump it on a record.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: That's not right.
dialog: (to Clark)
dialog: Yes, you're right about me
dialog: and Donald but -- hold it a
dialog: sec, okay?
text: She hands the full scoop of potato salad to CLARK, picks up the stack of records
text: and takes them over to the D.J. HOLD ON CLARK, holding a scoop of potato salad,
text: feeling foolish. At this precise moment, TWO of the more successful-looking
text: ALUMNI drift by with their WIVES.
speaker_heading: FIRST MAN
dialog: Hey, Kent.
speaker_heading: SECOND MAN
dialog: How ya' doin'?
text: CLARK is about to shake hands. At the last moment he has to transfer the scoop
text: of potato salad awkwardly to his left hand. The COUPLES drift off, smiling,
text: CLARK watching them as the FIRST MAN murmurs to the SECOND MAN:
speaker_heading: FIRST MAN
dialog: Some guys never change...
text: VERTICAL PAN UP TO a blown-up black and white high school photo of serious,
text: somewhat awkward-looking teenage CLARK KENT. CAMERA PANS ACROSS WALL OF
text: DECORATIONS, COMING TO A STOP ON A BIG PHOTO BLOW-UP of a handsome young blonde
text: football player. It is captioned Brad Wilson -- All State 1964. In the picture
text: he holds the ball, arm cocked back to pass for a touchdown. He looks like a
text: young, blonde Greek god. As we SEE this, we hear, off screen:
speaker_heading: BRAD (o.s.)
dialog: (noticeably drunken
dialog: voice)
dialog: The game against Mid-City,
dialog: that's the one I'll never forget.
dialog: Fourth quarter, score was tied,
dialog: and we're backed up on our
dialog: own 25-yard line. The Coach
dialog: sends in a play -- Right Flanker
dialog: Option. But I knew I could throw
dialog: a long one. See, I knew that their
dialog: cornerback was hurtin' and...
text: In the middle of the above, PAN DOWN FROM PHOTO to reveal the MAN who is
text: bragging about his past exploits. Quite a shocking change from the photo. Hair
text: thinning, surly, and possessing the bloated looks of a thirtyish ex-athlete
text: going to pot, this is BRAD WILSON. He's talking to TWO CLASSMATES. Suddenly, he
text: stops and his face lights up as LANA passes nearby. FOLLOW HIM as he hurries,
text: just a little unsteadily, to her side. As:
text: Music: D.J. puts on a record of "Earth Angel." We hear the tune but not the
dialog: lyric.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Here I am, honey, and I'm all
dialog: yours.
dialog: (with boozy, over-
dialog: bearing "gallantry")
dialog: Remember when you were Queen of
dialog: the Prom? All the guys had to wait in
dialog: line to get a dance.
dialog: (they have reached the
dialog: buffet table where
dialog: Clark waits)
dialog: But now there's only one name on
dialog: your dance card, sweet thing, and
dialog: it's --
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (recognizing him)
dialog: Brad Wilson.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Hiya, Kent, long time no see.
dialog: Not that you ever could.
speaker_heading: (points to CLARK'S
dialog: glasses)
dialog: "See" I mean,
dialog: (he cracks up at
dialog: his dumb joke)
dialog: Hahaha!
text: BRAD grabs LANA'S arm. She pulls away, simultaneously slipping her other arm
speaker_heading: through CLARK'S.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: I can't
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Clark already asked me.
speaker_heading: (to CLARK)
dialog: Didn't you?
dialog: (to BRAD, improvising)
dialog: He used to love this song.
speaker_heading: (to CLARK)
dialog: Didn't you?
dialog: (to BRAD)
dialog: So he just said --
dialog: (to CLARK, a bit
dialog: desperately)
dialog: "Would you dance with me?"
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
text: As they glide away onto he dance floor, LANA close to CLARK, BRAD scowls,
text: jealous and pissed-off.
text: WATCH THEM dance for a few moments. There's chemistry there, just beginning to
dialog: assert itself.
scene_heading: INT. CHECK MACHINE
text: UNDER A SIGN THAT SAYS "WEBCO, PAYROLL DEPT." a big check printing machine,

speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You got another one there for me?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: What??
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I put in a voucher for expenses.
dialog: Thought it might have come
dialog: through.
text: The MAN looks and is surprised to find, indeed, another envelope with GUS'S
dialog: name.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Oh yeah. Here you go.
text: CLOSE ON GUS -- He holds the envelope in his hand, trying not to show his
text: excitement. But you can practically hear his heart pounding. Now, almost afraid
text: to look, he slowly edges the check out of its envelope. He closes both eyes. Now
text: he opens one eye and peeks.
text: INSERT -- On the "Expenses" check emerging from the envelope.
dialog: First we SEE the name: AUGUST GORMAN. And then...the amount: $85,789.80!
speaker_heading: GUS (o.s.)

scene_heading: TIGHT C.U. CLARK -- Looking LEFT
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (voice echoing slightly)
dialog: Are you kidding? There must be
dialog: a lot of guys who'd like to be in
dialog: my place.
text: EXTREME LONG SHOT -- CLARK and LANA are no longer dancing. The party's over and
text: they are standing on top of the two tall ladders at opposite ends of the now
text: deserted gym. A space at least as large as a basketball court is between them,
text: explaining the hollow rings in their voices. They talk in conversational tones,
text: but louder than normally. They are engaged in taking down the decorations after
text: the reunion; the party's over. Crepe paper, banners. photos, etc. are coming
text: down and being stacked or discarded. The full bright gym lights are on now; no
text: ambiance any more. Between them is the platform that served as the bandstand
text: earlier; the electric piano and some of the loudspeakers are still there. The
dialog: feeling is one of 'after the ball.'
dialog: (Note: throughout the following, LANA uses her various tools...claw hammer,
dialog: staple extractor, etc....with marked skill and dexterity).
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (wryly)
dialog: You'd be surprised how many offers
dialog: I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't
dialog: stick around for this.
dialog: (as she tries to
dialog: untack a long crepe
dialog: paper streamer)
dialog: It really isn't easy.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (thinking she means
dialog: the task at hand)
dialog: The streamers? They're no
dialog: problem, you just pull on
dialog: them and --
text: He does so on a streamer near his ladder. It cascades to the floor in a great
dialog: colorful heap.
speaker_heading: FAVORING LANA
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Not the streamers. Everything.
dialog: Not that I'm complaining. It's
dialog: just that -- I don't know why
dialog: but I feel like I can talk to you.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (some distance away)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (louder)
dialog: I feel like I can talk to you!
text: FAVORING CLARK -- who looks pleased
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Well, I always wished you
dialog: would. Back when you were --
dialog: (he hesitates)
text: ON LANA -- as she reaches up and takes down a big, captioned photo of a teenaged
text: LANA and a YOUNG MAN (DONALD) dressed as King and Queen of the Senior Prom.
text: DONALD is grinning proudly at the camera while LANA gazes adoringly at him.
speaker_heading: LANA
speaker_heading: (finishing CLARK'S
dialog: sentence)
dialog: Queen of the Prom?
text: With that she drops the picture from the top of the ladder. It falls with a thud
text: to the gym floor.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: And three years after the
dialog: Royal Wedding, the King
dialog: abdicated.
dialog: (climbing down the
dialog: ladder now, suddenly
speaker_heading: looking away from CLARK)
dialog: Isn't that terrible?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (compassionately, as he
text: too, climbs down his
dialog: ladder)
dialog: It sure is.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (but she meant something
dialog: else, as she points to
dialog: buffet table:)
dialog: There must be a gallon of potato
dialog: salad left over.
text: She walks over to the bowl, peers into it, finally turns back to CLARK who has
dialog: joined her there.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: You know what's the problem?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (tentatively)
dialog: Too much mayonnaise?
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Mayonnaise? Donald loved
dialog: mayonnaise. Why would you
dialog: think that was the problem.?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (very confused)
dialog: I didn't --
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: No, the problem is --
dialog: (heatedly)
dialog: Why do I stay in Smallville?
dialog: Believe me, I've asked myself
dialog: the same question. Do you know
dialog: how lucky you are to live in
dialog: Metropolis?
dialog: (eyes shining)
dialog: The Big Apricot.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: But Lana, you could --
speaker_heading: ON LANA
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (wistfully)
dialog: That's easy to say. But how?
dialog: And what about Ricky?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (completely at sea)
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Ricky. My little boy. At least
dialog: here we've got a house. and I've
dialog: got a job. Okay, I'm only a
dialog: secretary, oaky, but it pays the
dialog: bills. Except for last winter
dialog: when the fuel bills kept going
dialog: up and up and up.
text: (extendes her hand, eyes
dialog: her bare ring finger)
dialog: I even had to pawn my diamond
dialog: ring then.
text: ON CLARK -- Distressed for her.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Gee...
speaker_heading: LANA (o.s.)
dialog: (resignedly)
dialog: I guess there's nothing I can
dialog: do about that.
text: TWO SHOT -- But CLARK realizes that now she's talking about something else, as
text: she points upward.
text: ANGLE UP -- There at the top of the gym roof, a cluster of balloons stick to the
dialog: ceiling.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (a little shrug)
dialog: Well, we can't fly up there and
dialog: get them.
text: QUICK C. U. CLARK -- A fleeting, private smile.
text: NEW ANGLE -- As CLARK starts to gather up the fallen streamers from the floor.
text: LANA glances over at him.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (tentatively)
dialog: You...um...you never got married?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Oh...I came close once.
text: As LANA starts to stack stuff in the corner of the gym, CLARK idly turns to the
text: piano, strikes a chord. Then:
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (singing quietly,
dialog: his favorite oldie)
dialog: "Earth Angel, Earth Angel,
dialog: Please be mine...
text: ON LANA -- She stops and turns, looks at him fondly, smiling.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: That song. I remember one day
dialog: I came into the music room and
dialog: you were fooling around at the
dialog: piano. And I thought -- what am
dialog: I going to do with all this potato
dialog: salad?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (confused)
dialog: You thought that?
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (going back to
dialog: square one)
dialog: I thought "Clark Kent has a
dialog: really nice voice." You didn't
dialog: even know I was there.
text: ON CLARK -- He stops singing, almost blushing.
text: ON LANA -- She hasn't noticed. She is standing looking at a photo that has not
text: yet been taken down from the wall -- that smiling and serious young face of
scene_heading: CLARK KENT.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: You know, years later you can
dialog: look at someone and think, well,
dialog: I guess that's the one, that's the
dialog: one that got away.
dialog: C.U. CLARK -- That really got to him.
scene_heading: INT. ROSS WEBSTER'S OFFICE - DAY
text: ON ROSS WEBSTER in a spectacularly lush office, filled with amazing gadgets and
text: décor. This is our first meeting with the man himself and we quickly see his
text: style is that calculatedly gruff "democratic" jolly camaraderie reminiscent of
dialog: Nelson Rockefeller. in other words, this is a guy who insists on having his
dialog: servants call him by his first name, but that doesn't mean he would ever invite
text: one to sit at his table. At this moment in time, the Humanitarian of the Year is
text: clearly upset about something.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Give it to me again, fella. Just
dialog: run it by me one more time.
text: REVERSE, WIDE ANGLE -- Standing on the other side of the massive desk is an
text: elderly man in a dark business suit who looks extremely ill-at-ease. This is the
scene_heading: Chief Accountant of Webco. MR. SIMPSON.
speaker_heading: SIMPSON
dialog: (extremely nervous)
dialog: 85,000 dollars.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Missing????
speaker_heading: SIMPSON
dialog: Embezzled, Mr. Webster.
dialog: (he can barely say it)
text: Stolen from the firm.
text: From off-screen, a strident voice that could curdle milk rings out; it is the
text: voice of VERA WEBSTER, the sister.
speaker_heading: VERA (o.s.)
dialog: By whom?
text: BOTH MEN turn sharply in the direction of the voice. PAN TO a door that connects
text: to an anteroom. Dressed in a suit that somehow reminds us of Joseph Stalin,
text: VERA, in a foul mood, enters.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: That's what I want to know!
dialog: By whom? Whom????
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Get a hold of yourself, Vera.
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Nobody else ever will.
speaker_heading: SIMPSON
dialog: I don't know who. Whom. I can't
dialog: trace it.
dialog: (years of bitterness
dialog: coming out)
dialog: In the old days it was simple. We
dialog: kept books, we had ledgers, we
dialog: could see what was going in and
dialog: what was paid out. If somebody
dialog: wanted to rob you, he'd come in
dialog: with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: Now they get theses blasted
dialog: computers to do their dirty work!
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: My friend, you are yesterday.
dialog: Whoever pulled this caper is
dialog: tomorrow.
text: Suddenly, the door flies open and LORELEI bursts in, all a-twitter.
speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: Ross, honey, it's time for your
dialog: massage...
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: (furious)
dialog: Bubba, does this woman have
dialog: the right to burst in without
dialog: knocking...!
text: VERA is seething with animosity: LORELEI looks at her with undisguised loathing.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (ill-at-ease)
dialog: Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you
dialog: know my Staff Dietician?
speaker_heading: SIMPSON
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: VERA
speaker_heading: (to LORELEI)
dialog: If you don't mind, we are trying
dialog: to hold a meeting here!
speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: Why don't you hold your breath,
dialog: instead? Maybe you'll turn blue.
dialog: On you that'd be an improvement.
text: Steely-eyed, VERA advances on her with controlled fury.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Pay attention, people: I am
text: about to take a human life.
text: ROSS quickly intervenes, upset at this turn of events. he keeps the TOW WOMAN
dialog: apart and:
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (big, fake smile
speaker_heading: to SIMPSON)
dialog: Old pal, would you just step
dialog: outside for a sec?
dialog: 
text: SIMPSON departs; the TWO WOMEN explode in anger, simultaneously:
speaker_heading: VERA					LORELEI
dialog: Bubba, I will not let			 Ross, tell her to stop
dialog: this woman insult me...			 picking on me or I'll...
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (commandingly, in
dialog: stentorian tones)
dialog: Mouths ...closed! Ears...open!
dialog: (cowed, scared, the
dialog: WOMEN shut up)
dialog: Now the last thing any of us
dialog: wants is for me to be upset. Right?
dialog: Right! and it upsets me very much
dialog: when my favorite sister an my
dialog: favorite Aerobic Instructor don't
dialog: get along.
dialog: (Continued)
speaker_heading: ROSS (cont.)
text: (sternly, shaking his
dialog: finger at them)
dialog: Now I don't want to ever see
dialog: this sort of thing again or...
dialog: well,...
dialog: (threateningly)
dialog: I can't have anyone with me
dialog: who isn't with me.
dialog: (reluctant murmurs of
dialog: assent from the WOMEN)
dialog: Now...kiss and make up.
text: Surely, LORELEI pursers her lips.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: I don't kiss.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (remembering)
dialog: Oh, right. Well then, just shake
dialog: hands.
text: The TWO ENEMIES shake hands.
text: INSERT -- The hands grip and squeeze each other, knuckles turning white.
text: TWO SHOT -- In spite of the struggle and pain, VERA and LORELEI smile teeth-
text: baring smiles for ROSS'S benefit.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (pleased to see they're
dialog: cooperating)
dialog: That's my best gals.
dialog: (calls out)
dialog: Come back in, my boy.
text: A split-second later the sweating, elderly SIMPSON is back in the room.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Well, chum? What now? Kiss the
dialog: 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's
dialog: salary while he thinks up new ways
dialog: to shake the money tree?
speaker_heading: SIMPSON
dialog: (helpfully)
dialog: He's bound to slip up sooner
dialog: or later.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SIMPSON
dialog: Uh...I don't know...that's what
dialog: they always say in the movies.
text: ROSS paces, building up steam. A slow burn heating up.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Unless the man's a complete idiot,
dialog: he won't slip up at all. He'll just go
dialog: on quietly taking the bread from
dialog: our mouths. unless he's a total
dialog: ignoramus, he'll keep a low profile
dialog: and won't do a thing to call attention
dialog: to himself.
dialog: (voice rising)
dialog: Unless he is an utter moron...
dialog: Suddenly:
text: Sound: A loud sports car motor revs up outside the window. It sounds like the
dialog: last lap at Sebring.
text: FULL SHOT -- ROSS, VERA, LORELEI, and SIMPSON, startled at the sudden noise, go
text: to the window to look out and see what it is.
text: POV: OUT THE WINDOW -- The company parking lot. Zooming down one of the lanes,
text: then executing a hairpin turn, burning rubber and pulling into a parking space
dialog: is an incredible bright red Ferrari...the flashiest of sports car you could
text: imagine;. Behind the wheel still dressed in his shabby, schleppy clothes, is GUS
speaker_heading: GORMAN.
scene_heading: EXT. SMALLVILLE BOWLING ALEY - DAY
text: A neon sign proclaims "SMALLVILLE LANES" and a lettered sign announces "Family
dialog: Rates."
scene_heading: INT. BOWLING ALLEY - DAY
text: FULL SHOT -- A six-lane bowling alley. BOWLERS playing. On the far side, in
dialog: B.G., a bar.
text: CLOSER ON ONE LANE -- A bunch of KIDS are choosing up teams, three to a side.
text: There seems to be some argument going on between the TWO TEAM CAPTAINS about ONE
text: BOY who stands a bit apart, looking forlorn and uncomfortable. He' smaller than
text: the others, like the runt in a litter, and there's a certain timorousness about
text: him. He has his mother's red hair: this is LANA'S son, RICKY.
text: One of the team CAPTAINS is looking annoyed as he points at RICKY.
speaker_heading: FIRST BOY
dialog: (to his OPPONENT)
dialog: That means we gotta take Ricky.
speaker_heading: SECOND BOY
dialog: Too bad, you lost the toss.
speaker_heading: FIRST BOY
dialog: If we gotta have Ricky on our
dialog: side, then we get a two strike
dialog: handicap.
text: REVERSE, WIDE: Seated around the scoreboard table are a number of parents, as
text: well as LANA and CLARK.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (distressed)
dialog: I just can't stand this.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (trying to be positive)
dialog: Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me
dialog: Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer
dialog: myself.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: It isn't only that he's small for
dialog: his age. how would you like
dialog: to be the only kid in town
dialog: without a father?
dialog: (as she looks in
dialog: another direction)
text: Look at him, he's stewed to the
text: gills in the middle of the afternoon.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (still looking at
speaker_heading: RICKY)
dialog: But all he had was chocolate milk.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: I mean him.
text: She points, and CAMERA FOLLOWS HER GESTURE TO REVEAL BRAD, tipsy, making his way
text: toward them from the bar, a bottle of beer in his hand.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Hiya, sweet thing.
speaker_heading: (indicating RICKY)
dialog: Little guy's getting' hassled,
dialog: huh?
dialog: (to CLARK, curtly)
dialog: Kent, you still here?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: I seem to be.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: (to LANA)
dialog: All the kid needs is a couple
dialog: of pointers from the ol' champ
dialog: here.
dialog: (he means himself)
dialog: Kent, I bet you didn't know I
dialog: won the all-country bowling
dialog: trophy two years in a row.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: A natural athlete can play any
dialog: sport. Any sport.
text: And with that, he turns and heads right for RICKY.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT -- CLARK and LANA
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Oh, no. This'll only make it
dialog: worse.
text: NEW ANGLE -- RICKY, first to bowl, lifts a ball from the rack. The ball is
text: really too heavy for him to handle well, but he gamely takes his position at the
text: line and, a bit clumsily, bowls a wobbly ball.
text: ON THE BALL -- it pretty much runs out of steam by the time it gets to the pins,
text: but manages to knock down a few.
text: ON RICKY -- looking disappointed.
speaker_heading: FIRST BOY
dialog: See? What'd I tell ya?
text: As RICKY goes to get the ball coming back on the rack for his second go, BRAD
text: lurches over to him, putting on a big helpful show for LANA'S benefit.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Hey, sport, you're holdin' it all
dialog: wrong. Lemme show you --
text: He leans to RICKY as he talks; RICKY recoils from the gust of whiskey breath. As
text: BRAD tries to wrest the ball from the embarrassed boy --
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Let ol' Uncle Brad show you
dialog: how it's done.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (sternly)
dialog: Say, Brad. I think he'll be
dialog: better off doing it his way.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: (amazed at the
dialog: effrontery)
dialog: For a guy who was lucky to be
dialog: water-boy on the high school
dialog: team, you sure got a big mouth,
dialog: Kent.
text: CLARK moves closer to him to speak in confidence: MOVE IN TO VERY TIGHT TWO
speaker_heading: SHOT.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (sotto voice)
dialog: I just think Ricky would rather not
dialog: get a bowling lesson in front of the
dialog: other kids.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: The kid needs a man to show him --
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: The kid will do fine on his own.
speaker_heading: (to RICKY)
dialog: Give it your best shot, Ricky!
text: As RICKY walks to his position behind the line:
text: ON CLARK -- who seemingly "accidentally" trips over the chalk container,
text: knocking it over. The hunk of chalk breaks and chalk dust rises in the air where
text: CLARK tries to pick it up.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: (derisively)
dialog: Clark Klutz. Same as ever.
text: ON RICKY -- holding the heavy ball, he advances to the line.
text: C.U. LANA -- eyes averted.
text: C.U. CLARK -- chalk dust on his face, his nose starts to twitch like a man about
text: to sneeze.
text: ON RICKY -- he bowls the ball, rather weekly.
text: C.U. CLARK -- who points his face at the line and lets out a Super-Sneeze.
text: EFFECTS: The Super-Sneeze causes the ball to whiz down the alley at Super-Speed.
text: It hits the pins with such impact that they break into a hundred pieces like so
text: many china cups.
text: C.U. RICKY -- astonished. And then joyfully delighted.
text: C.U. BRAD -- his jaw drops.
speaker_heading: LANA
speaker_heading: (to CLARK)
dialog: Gezundheit!
scene_heading: INT. WEBCO DATA PROCESSING CENTER - DAY
text: GUS seated at his computer, at work. His neighbor FRED comes walking down the
text: aisle, looking serious.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Gus?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Say what?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: The boss wants to see you.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Say who?
text: Feet churning rapidly, GUS propels his rolling chair toward the exit.
scene_heading: EXT. LOBBY, GLASS ELEVATOR - DAY
text: LONG SHOT -- the glass elevator begins its ascent tot he highest level of
text: management, the office of ROSS WEBSTER himself. Inside, little GUS GORMAN
text: shakes and quakes in full view of everybody in the lobby and at each level.
scene_heading: INT. GLASS ELEVATOR - DAY
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (abject terror)
dialog: Oh my God! The Boss! Ross
dialog: the Boss! The Ross!
text: At which point the elevator reaches another level. Seeing a MAN staring right at
text: him, GUS manages a sickly smile, which vanishes the instant he rises out of the
speaker_heading: MAN'S sight.
scene_heading: INT. OUTER OFFICE OF ROSS WEBSTER - DAY
text: GUS steps out of the elevator, nervously working his yo-yo (an upgraded model
text: now that he's come into some money; this is a plastic one) and stands, almost
text: trembling before the desk of a snooty SECRETARY. A gold plaque on her desk
dialog: reads:
speaker_heading: ROSS WEBSTER
scene_heading: CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Mr. Gorman?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (talking fast, in
dialog: pure fear)
dialog: No! He died last week. I
dialog: just look something like
dialog: him. People always make
dialog: this mistake.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Mr. Webster is waiting to see you.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: He alone? Or is there, like uh...
dialog: men in uniform...or, uh...plain
dialog: clothes.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Please go in, Mr. Gorman.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (imitating his idea
dialog: of a white executive-
dialog: type)
dialog: Say, dear, where's the wash
dialog: room located? I'd like to
dialog: freshen up a bit before...
text: ROSS'S voice barks out over the intercom on her desk:
speaker_heading: ROSS (o.s.)
dialog: (intercom)
dialog: Is he here yet, Miss Collins?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: (pushing intercom
dialog: button)
dialog: Yes sir, I'm sending him in.
text: Fingering hi yo-yo like it was a rosary, GUS enters.
scene_heading: INT. ROSS WEBSTER'S OFFICE - DAY
text: FULL SHOT -- a wall of bookcases, massively out-sized chess set and various
text: gadgets. Seated behind a massive desk, ROSS looks up.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Mr. August Gorman?
text: ON GUS -- instantly abject, pleading pitifully.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Please, Mr. Webster, you're a
dialog: great humanitarian. Ain't you
dialog: heard what it's like in them
dialog: jails? You send an innocent
text: boy in and he gets thrown in
dialog: with killers and robbers and
dialog: rapers and raper killer and
dialog: robber rapers and...
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Mr. Gorman, just answer me
dialog: one question...
text: GUS braces himself for the worst.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: You've been a naughty boy
dialog: haven't you?
dialog: (congenial laugh)
dialog: C'mon now, admit it, you
dialog: were kinda naughty.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (a but surprises
dialog: at his tone)
dialog: Uh...yeah. I didn't think of
dialog: it that way exactly, but...
text: ROSS rises, walks up to the bookshelf and pushes the spine of one volume.
text: Suddenly the entire section of shelving revolves, revealing a complete wet bar
text: on the other side. As he does this business, he keeps speaking:
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Say, fella, I understand. I
dialog: can -- what do the kids say
dialog: these days -- "dig where
dialog: you're comin' from."
dialog: (a chuckle)
dialog: You want to be rich, right?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Uh...
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Now me, I was born rich. I've
dialog: never worn the same pair of
dialog: socks twice.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
text: ROSS has by now poured himself a drink and one for GUS.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: I believe they're laundered
dialog: and sent to some charitable
dialog: institution. I don't know what
dialog: the heck they do with 'em.
dialog: Maybe they use them for dust
dialog: rags, or pen wipers...
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Or socks.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Yes! That never occurred to
dialog: me.
dialog: (hands him his drink)
dialog: Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.
dialog: (GUS downs it chug-
dialog: a-lug)
dialog: Gus, my friend, you're a genius.
dialog: Okay, a naughty genius, but hell,
dialog: nobody's perfect.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: 'Cause I know about getting' them
dialog: half-centses?
text: ROSS begins to stride about the office as he pontificates, turning away from
text: GUS, speaking "to the world." As he does, GUS, feeling more at ease, walks to
dialog: the bar.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Because computers run the
dialog: world today, pal. And the fella
dialog: who can fool the computers will
dialog: run the world himself!
text: GUS leans against the bar. It instantly revolves, taking him with it, and
text: becomes a wall of bookcase again. GUS is now trapped behind it somewhere inside
text: the wall. ROSS, who hasn't noticed since his back is to the bar, just keeps on
text: talking as if GUS were still there.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: I've been searching for a long
dialog: time for somebody who can
dialog: make these machines do things
dialog: they're not supposed to do. Do
dialog: you catch my drift, brother?
text: From inside the wall, GUS calls for help; his voice is so muffles, that ROSS
text: just takes it for a grunt of assent.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: I knew you would. And best of
dialog: all, you seem to be able to do it
dialog: in such a way that the deed goes
text: undetected.
text: At last the bookcase spins around and a shaken GUS steps back in the room, just
text: as ROSS turns. He never noticed his absence.
text: By the time GUS has regained his balance, ROSS is already on his way out of the
text: room so that GUS has to rush to catch up with him. As ROSS heads for an
dialog: adjoining room:
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial
dialog: complex, is a family-owned cartel.
dialog: A little magnesium here, a little zinc
dialog: there. Some railroads here, some
dialog: farm machinery there. You follow?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (a little out of
dialog: breath)
dialog: I'm tryin' to.
text: ROSS stops in the doorway.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (intensely)
dialog: Gus, do you know what I want now?
dialog: I want coffee!
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (instantly turning
dialog: to get it)
dialog: Black or regular?
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: I don't think you understand.
scene_heading: INT. ROOFTOP ATRIUM - DAY
text: ROSS and GUSS step into an enormous rooftop botanical garden, about as big as a
text: football field, filled with a great profusion of trees, plants, flowers, and
dialog: bushes.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (wide-eyed wonder)
dialog: Man, what is this?
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Plants. Plants always make
text: an office cozier.
text: ROSS waves at a GARDNER pruning some bushes.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Hiya, fella, how's it goin'?
dialog: (to GUS)
dialog: Helluva nice guy, been with me
dialog: for years.
text: As they stroll, ROSS stops to admire a shrub, or inspect a flower bed, but keeps
text: right on talking.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Under different company names. I
dialog: control the price of coffee beans
dialog: in Brazil. The price in Venezuela.
dialog: Java, South Korea, North Korea,
dialog: the Aleutian Islands, Guam,
dialog: Bolivia, and the Republic of
dialog: Gabon!
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Decaffeinated too?
text: As they continue walking, ROSS throws an avuncular, democratic arm around GUS'S
dialog: shoulders.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: But y'see, chum, the problem
dialog: I got is that one country just
dialog: won't play ball with me.
dialog: (as if GUS could
dialog: empathize)
dialog: You know how that can just
dialog: bug a guy, don't you?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Which country?
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (his expression
dialog: darkens)
dialog: Columbia.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Columbia.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Columbia's got two major
dialog: exports and one of them's
dialog: coffee.
dialog: (Continued)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSS (cont.)
dialog: (put-upon)
dialog: Oh, I tried to reason with
dialog: them. Believe me, I tried!
dialog: But this one miserable piss-
dialog: ant little country has the gall
dialog: to think they can dictate the
dialog: economy of an open market!
dialog: ("reasonably")
dialog: Gus, dear Gus, don't you see
dialog: what I mean? We have to teach
dialog: them a lesson.
dialog: (icy)
dialog: Wipe 'em out!!!
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (startled)
dialog: Wipe 'em out?
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Destroy the entire Colombian
dialog: coffee crop down to the last bean.
text: He stops by a shrub, looks down at the soil around it. He frowns, then calls out
speaker_heading: to the GARDNER.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Yo! Over here.
text: The GARDNER runs over to him.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (suddenly terse, curt)
dialog: What's this I see? Fallen leaves
dialog: not picked up? Organic litter?
speaker_heading: GARDNER
dialog: Sorry, sir, I was going to do it
dialog: late--
text: Without a word, ROSS slaps the MAN sharply across the face. Then, his friendly
text: grin appearing again, he puts his arm around GUS and they continue walking as if
text: nothing unusual has happened (though, a nervous GUS keeps looking back at the
speaker_heading: GARDNER).
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: So, fella? You see the problem?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (tentatively)
dialog: But Mr. Webster...you're doin'
dialog: okay with Brazil and them other
dialog: places. What's wrong with just
dialog: one little old country doin' their
dialog: own thing?
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: A very wise man once said...I
dialog: think it was Attila the Hun...
dialog: "It's not enough that I succeed.
dialog: Everyone else must fail."
dialog: (he snaps a rose
dialog: in half; GUS jumps)
dialog: And you are going to do it for me.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (scared)
dialog: Me? How?
text: Their tour of the atrium has brought them back to where they started from, the
text: connecting door tot he office. The voice of VERA, o.s., announces her presence
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: VERA (o.s.)
dialog: The weather!
scene_heading: INT. ROSS'S OFFICE - DAY
text: As ROSS and GUS come back into the office, GUS catches his first glimpse of
text: VERA, looking forbidding.
text: ON GUS -- he instantly shrinks back from this creature.
speaker_heading: GUS
speaker_heading: (to ROSS)
dialog: Hey listen, I didn't know your
dialog: mama was comin' by...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: (furious)
dialog: Sister! I'm his sister!
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (to GUS)
dialog: Gus, tell me, have you ever heard
dialog: of Vulcan?
speaker_heading: GUS
speaker_heading: (to VERA)
dialog: That what they call you?
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: (through her teeth)
dialog: Vulcan is the weather satellite						our
dialog: government put up in orbit
dialog: to monitor the weather.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (eagerly)
dialog: But if somebody re-programmed
dialog: it, it could do much more.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: It could make weather!
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Storms! Floods!
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Blizzards! Heat waves!
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: How do you do that?
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Like everything else in the 20th
dialog: century, Gus. You push buttons.
scene_heading: INT. DAILY PLANET - DAY
text: INSERT: a finger is pushing a button. It's JIMMY OLSEN taking a picture as he
dialog: says:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Smile!
text: FULL SHOT -- The subjects of JIMMY'S photo are smiling so hard their cheeks
text: might burst. They are MR. and MRS. MAURY STOKIS, the winners of the JINGO
text: contest. Clad in resort outfits, they are standing beneath a poster emblazoned
dialog: "JINGO WINNERS!"
speaker_heading: MR. STOKIS
dialog: I can't believe it! It's the first
dialog: time I ever won anything!
speaker_heading: MRS. STOKIS
dialog: (kittenish)
dialog: You won my hand, Maury.
speaker_heading: MR. STOKIS
dialog: Yeah, sure, but this is the first
dialog: time I ever won anything valuable!
text: NEW ANGLE -- revealing JIMMY, who has his leg in a cast. He hobbles about his
text: equipment, clearly not thrilled with his assignment. Standing nearby are MISS
text: HENDERSON, looking delighted, and PERRY WHITE. looking like he'd give anything
dialog: to escape.
speaker_heading: MISS HENDERSON
dialog: Let's get one with the sombreros,
dialog: Olsen.
text: She pops the outsized sombreros on the heads of the happy couple. They instantly
text: strike a Latin pose and grin steadily at the camera.
speaker_heading: MISS HENDERSON
dialog: (an inspiration)
dialog: Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing
dialog: them their plane tickets.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: (miserable)
dialog: Why do I have to do this?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (miserable)
dialog: Why do I have to do this?
speaker_heading: PERRY

scene_heading: INT. ROSS WEBSTER'S OFFICE - DAY
text: GUS, ROSS, and VERA as we left them.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Computers talk to other computers,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Somehow your twisted little mind
dialog: should be able to figure out how to
text: tap into the main computer at the
dialog: Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (immediately)
dialog: Through the telephone line
dialog: terminal, that ain't nothin'.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: What she call you?
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Bubba.
dialog: (GUS ties not
dialog: to snicker)
dialog: When she was three years old
dialog: she couldn't pronounce the word
dialog: 'brother' and it came out 'Bubba.'
dialog: (grimly)
dialog: It was the last cute thing she ever
dialog: did.
text: Without knocking, as usual, LORELEI bursts into the office.
speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: Did I hear somebody say "cute
dialog: thing?"
text: GUS is stupefied at the sight of her.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: She's not his mama either.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic
dialog: Nutritionist.
speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: You're cute too.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I'm cool. I ain't cute. it ain't
dialog: cool to be cute.
text: GUS sits down by the oversized chess set. Unthinkingly, he reaches out and moves
text: one of the black pieces. immediately three of the white pieces begin to shift
text: squares automatically realigning themselves in a new defense by some electronic
text: gadgetry. Startled, GUS backs away.
text: NEW ANGLE -- As ROSS stares at GUS'S reaction, behind him LORELEI has happily
text: plunked herself in his chair behind the desk. The right hand top drawer is open
text: and she reaches in to take a Kleenex when VERA, seeing her opportunity , comes
text: by swiftly and slams the drawer closed with her knee, smashing LORELEI'S
text: fingers. The later lets out a shriek and pulls her hand, waving her fingers
text: wildly. ROSS turns to see what's the matter.
speaker_heading: VERA
text: She's drying her nails.
text: LORELEI smile through her pain, keeps shaking her hand in the air.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Always making yourself
dialog: beautiful for me, aren't you?
dialog: (turns back to GUS)
dialog: So, Gus, can you make Vulcan
dialog: do what I want it to? You didn't
dialog: answer me, pal.
dialog: (as GUS hesitates)
dialog: Did you hear about that prison
dialog: riot last week? It seems they
dialog: were complaining about rats
dialog: in the cells...
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: First question got to be
dialog: "Where."
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Not "What." Don't need a genius
dialog: to figure out "what." Need a
dialog: genius to figure out "where."
dialog: (A bit boastfully
speaker_heading: to VERA)
dialog: He says I'm a genius, your don --
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!
dialog: (as she calms down)
dialog: See, if y'all don't want them to
dialog: trace it back, you got to punch
dialog: this in from someplace nobody'd
dialog: ever think off. Some little rinky-
dialog: dink operation with a little mickey-
text: mouse computer.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: It's got to be someplace you can
dialog: sneak into.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Someplace where nobody knows him
dialog: so they can't connect him with us.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve
dialog: subsidiaries and every one of them is
dialog: tied to our central computer system.
dialog: How about...hmmmm, someplace
dialog: small...
scene_heading: EXT. CORNER GROCERY STORE, SMALLVILLE - DAY

text: WIDE SHOT -- The main shopping area of Smallville. In B.G. LANA is just coming

text: CLOSER ON THE CAR -- as CLARK sees LANA struggling with the door to the store

speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: I'll give your mom a hand.
text: NEW ANGLE -- he flings open the car door and it slams hard against the knee of a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (abashed)
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry.
text: As the MAN limps off, muttering, we realize it's GUS GORMAN, wearing his same

text: GUS, as he walks across some railroad tracks that run through the center of
text: town, looking around at his surroundings.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (bitching, aloud)
dialog: Welcome to nowhere, U.S.A.
text: In B.G. LANA and CLARK get in the car and drive off. HOLD ON GUS. FOLLOW HIM as
text: he sets off down Main Street, passing a Sears type store, glancing up at the
text: window display. A mannequin-like giant Ken doll in a green and white polyester
text: leisure suit is grinning down at him. GUS shudders from the bottom of his soul.
text: HOLD CAMAERA STAIONARY as SEEN FROM BEHIND, shoulders bowed, he trudges down

scene_heading: EXT. COUNTY CLEAING - DAY
text: EXTREME LONG SHOT -- In a clearing on the edge of acres of waving wheat, CLARK

text: plastic containers of homemade goodies as CLARK sprinkles salt on a celery
dialog: stalk.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (happily)
dialog: Gee, I haven't done this in
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Some people don't think it's
dialog: healthy.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (earnestly nodding)
dialog: Well, it's true you have to be
dialog: careful things don't spoil,
dialog: especially with mayonnaise
dialog: or cream.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Clark, I think you worry too
dialog: much about mayonnaise.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Me??
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: I'm talking about salt.
dialog: (as he hesitates
dialog: uncertainly)
dialog: Oh, go ahead, pour it on,
dialog: relax. That's what picnics
dialog: are for.
text: NEW ANGLE -- including RICKY, who is pulling a ball out of his pocket while
text: BUSTER waits, wagging his tail, beside him.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Don't they have picnics in
dialog: Metropolis, Mr. Kent?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Well...
dialog: (looking around at
dialog: the open fields, clean
dialog: air, blue sky)
dialog: Not quite like this.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Mom and I do this all the time.
text: And he goes racing off with BUSTER, OUT OF FRAME.
speaker_heading: LANA
speaker_heading: (to CLARK)
dialog: It's nice for Ricky.
text: CLARK settles in next to her, beginning to open plastic containers.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (enjoying the
dialog: proximity)
dialog: And even nicer when there's
dialog: a man around, Which isn't all
dialog: that often.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (re the plastic
dialog: containers)
dialog: There's a lot of choices here.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: No, all the good ones are
dialog: married. That's why Brad
dialog: thinks he's God's gift to
dialog: women. This woman anyway.
dialog: He's single. He won't take no
dialog: for an answer, but he's the only
dialog: one who's asking. And he knows it.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (trying to straighten
dialog: out the conversation)
dialog: I meant all the choices here. All
dialog: this --
dialog: (lifting lids)
dialog: -- cole slaw, guacamole --
dialog: (more and more
dialog: impressed as he
dialog: opens for containers)
dialog: This is some picnic!
text: CAMERA PANS AWAY FROM CLARK, LOSING HIM FROM THE SHOT, AND MOVES TO LANA JUST AS
text: RICKY RUNS TO HER. LANA is still beaming from CLARK'S praise, as:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Hey mom, how about me?
text: LANA finds -- in the middle of this feast -- a lone, wax paper wrapped sandwich
text: and hands it to RICKY with a mock sigh. As he takes off again:
text: TWO SHOT -- LANA turns back to CLARK. Holding a fork and a plastic container, he
text: has just sampled something he's not quite sure about.
speaker_heading: LANA
text: Peanut butter and jelly.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: No, thanks.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: No, I mean Ricky. He's not
dialog: interested in any of this stuff.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Pate? What pate?
dialog: (leaning over -- very
dialog: close to him now --
dialog: to peer into the
dialog: container)
dialog: I didn't make any --
dialog: (horrified pause;
dialog: then)
dialog: Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's
dialog: dog food.
text: CLARK looks at the container, looks at his fork, looks at LANA. The look on his
text: face is just too much for her. She starts to laugh. Then he starts to laugh.
text: They stop -- and then start again. She collapses against him, weak with
dialog: laughter.
text: And even when their mirth subsides, they don't move apart.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Gee, I haven't laughed like that
dialog: since -- since --
dialog: (she suddenly realizes)
dialog: I really can't remember when.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Me neither...
text: Their proximity suddenly makes them self-conscious. They move apart and try to
text: lighten the moment, a bit awkwardly:
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: So...how much longer do you
dialog: think you'll be in Smallville --
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (his dialogue overlaps
dialog: hers, starts a few
dialog: beats back)
dialog: You know, I was just thinking,
dialog: Lana --
dialog: (the following line
dialog: is in the clear)
dialog: -- someone like you could do
dialog: do really well in Metropolis --
text: They both stop, smile a bit shyly at each other.
text: Sound: nearby, the steady, grinding motor of a giant thresher in the wheat
dialog: fields.
text: EXT. WHEAT FIELDS: LONG SHOT of the enormous thresher cutting through the wheat,
text: its great blades and rollers turning.
text: ON THE PICNIC: over the noise, LANA and CLARK are continuing their tete-a-tete.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: I suppose I've got to face it --
dialog: I'm not going to find what I
dialog: want in Smallville anymore, but --
dialog: 
text: Sound: the thresher gets closer and louder.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: I can never get a way from it.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (following her thought
dialog: about Smallville;
dialog: nodding understandingly)
dialog: Old ties are hard to cut.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: No. I mean, yes they are, but I
dialog: was talking about that.
text: (she cocks her head towards
dialog: the insistent sound)
dialog: Wheat King. Bet your bottom
dialog: dollar that's a Wheat King
dialog: thresher.
dialog: (continued)
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (thoughtfully)
dialog: That's the biggest change in
dialog: Smallville, you know. They've
dialog: taken over this town. Everybody
dialog: who isn't actually working for
dialog: Wheat King -- like I do -- is out
dialog: there --
dialog: (gesturing towards
dialog: the fields)
text: on a Wheat King thresher.
dialog: (back to their
dialog: conversation; she
text: looks up at him eagerly)
dialog: Do you think I could do it? Do you?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (dubiously)
dialog: Ride a thresher? Well, I don't
dialog: know. Girls are trying just about
dialog: everything now but --
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: No, what you said before, Could I
dialog: make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed
dialog: about it, sure, but I never really
dialog: thought about it.
dialog: (uncertainly)
dialog: What would I do when I got there?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Call me.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (quietly thrilled)
dialog: Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean,
dialog: I'd want to, but I wouldn't want
dialog: to...be a nuisance to you.
text: ON RICKY -- about twenty feet away, having his own good time, tussling happily
text: with his PUPPY in the tall grass.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT -- CLARK and LANA
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Hey, you could never be a nuisance.
text: She touches his knee gently. She moves toward him, closer.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Clark, may I tell you something?
text: (as he waits, she looks
dialog: away for a moment)
dialog: My oil pan is leaking.
text: He reacts with considerable confusion; it wasn't what he expected.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: See?
dialog: (she points under
dialog: the car)
text: POV: A small puddle under the CHEVY is getting larger, dark drops falling slowly
dialog: but steadily into it as:
speaker_heading: LANA (o.s.)
dialog: See? There's something dripping.
text: NEW ANGLE -- As LANA gets up, in B.G. we SEE BUSTER the dog run off into the
dialog: wheat.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Hey, Buster! Darn it... come
dialog: back, willya?
text: But the DOG runs on and RICKY starts to chase him into the fields. HOLS ON LANA
speaker_heading: and CLARK.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: The dog's always doing that.
dialog: (wryly, pointing to
dialog: the leaky Chevy)
dialog: And the car's always doing that.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Can I help?
text: LANA opens the trunk, takes out a tool kit.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: No thanks. With all the trouble
dialog: this thing gives me, I started
text: studying up on auto repair.
text: She slides under the car and begins tapping the undercarriage with a wrench,
dialog: listening carefully.
dialog: 
text: ON CLARK -- watching her, smiling.
text: Sound: the thresher grinds a way, coming and going, closer now and louder than
text: LANA'S tapping.
text: But CLARK suddenly hears something else. He sits up, frowns, cocks his head
text: towards the wheat fields.
text: EFFECTS: Shimmery light waves coming from his ear denote Super-Hearing in
dialog: action.
text: What he (and we) now HEARS: the plaintive insistent whining of BUSTER out in the
text: fields. Troubled, he turns in that direction, scanning the area.
text: POV: SPECIAL EFFECTS: X-Ray Vision sees through the thick golden wheat,
text: searching till it finds the PUPPY sitting, whimpering, beside RICKY, who lays
text: unconscious, completely hidden among rows of tall grain. ZOOM CLOSER TO RICKY --
text: chasing BUSTER, he has tripped and fallen, hitting his head on a jagged stone
text: jutting out of the earth beside him. There is a cut on the side of his head and
text: he doesn't move.
text: Sound: suddenly the grinding, thrashing noise of the giant threshing machine
dialog: seems very close.
text: AERIAL SHOT: LOOKING DOWN, we SEE the big thresher heading for the plot of land
text: where little RICKY lays unseen.
scene_heading: EXT. WHEAT FIELD - DAY
text: LOW ANGLE -- RICKY in F.G., the big thresher coming fast towards him from B.G.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY CLEARING - DAY
text: CLARK glances over at LANA, but she, of course, has heard nothing unusual from
text: underneath the car and goes on tinkering.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Think I'll see if I can help
dialog: Ricky.
text: He gets up and moves casually but very quickly towards the picket fence. Sure
text: that LANA is safely out of sight doing her work, he darts behind the fence.
text: EFFECTS: As he runs behind the fence, CLARK KENT turns into SUPERMAN. The effect
text: of the picket railings is like a strobe or time-lapse, i.e., as he passes behind
text: each rail more and more of the SUPERMAN FIGURE begins to emerge from the CLARK
text: FIGURE. By the time he has reached the end of the fence...it's SUPERMAN! He
text: zooms into the sky.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - DAY
text: ON SUPERMAN, looking down.
text: HIS POV: the big thresher is getting closer, closer to the unconscious CHILD.
text: FULL SHOT -- SUPERMAN swoops down.
scene_heading: IN VARIOUS QUICK CUTS:
text: 1. LOW ANGLE -- the thresher comes closer.
text: The noise is deafening.
text: 2. ON THE FRONT OF THE THRESHER -- we can
text: clearly see how formidable the rolling blades are.
text: They would chew the CHILD up in seconds.
text: 3. Accelerating, SUPERMAN dives down, lands
text: in front of the thresher and...
text: 4. Reaches out with both hands and just grabs the
text: churning blades, stopping it abruptly.
text: 5. ON THE THRESHER DRIVER in his cab, startled
text: to find himself coming to a sudden, jolting stop.
text: 6. SUPERMAN scoops up the unconscious RICKY in
text: his arms, flies up into the air with him.
text: 7. RICKY comes to in mid-air, opens his eyes and
dialog: is surprised to say the least.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Superman???
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: That's what they call me.
text: 8. The thresher DRIVER, in his cab, mops his brow
text: at the near miss.
text: 9. SUPERMAN and RICKY coming towards the
text: parked car.
text: ON THE CAR -- LANA still underneath.
speaker_heading: RICKY (o.s.)
dialog: Mom! Mom!
text: LANA slides out from under, and is astonished at what she sees...SUPERMAN
text: landing with her SON in his arms.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (dumbfounded)
dialog: Ricky? Where...what...
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: (indicates the cut)
dialog: I'd wash that out with some
dialog: iodine...
speaker_heading: (RICKY winces)
dialog: Okay, Mercurochrome.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (trying to recover
dialog: the power of speech)
dialog: Thank ...you.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: Anytime.
text: RICKY gazes at him in wonder.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is
dialog: Ricky.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: We've already met.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: And this is...
dialog: (she looks around
speaker_heading: for CLARK)
dialog: ...Clark.
speaker_heading: (to SUPERMAN)
dialog: My friend is around here
dialog: somewhere, I'll just look for...
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: (kindly)
dialog: I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.
speaker_heading: (to RICKY)
dialog: See you around, pal.
text: With a smile and a wave, SUPERMAN takes off. Whoosh. And he's gone from sight.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: (still in a spell)
dialog: We were flying!! Mom! In the sky!
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (trying to make
dialog: sense of all this)
dialog: What were you doing anyway?
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: I was looking for...
dialog: (remembering, suddenly
dialog: looks around, calling)
dialog: Buster! Buster!
text: Sound: Distant sound of yelping dog.
text: ON THE WHEAT FIELD -- backing out, ass-first and on his hands and knees, from an
text: open-ended length of big irrigation pipe comes a disheveled CLARK KENT, holding
text: the PUPPY in his arms. He stands up with difficulty and raises the DOG high in
dialog: the air for them to see in B.G.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (calling)
dialog: I found him!
text: NEW ANGLE -- as LANA and RICKY run to CLARK
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (looking incredulous)
dialog: What!
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: He really was!
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Well, aren't you excited?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Lana, I'm from Metropolis.
dialog: I see Superman every day.
scene_heading: EXT. WHEAT KING INDUSTRIAL PARK, MAIN OFFICES - NIGHT
text: WIDE, ESTABLISHING SHOT of one of those typical, sprawling industrial parks
text: located on the outskirts of communities all across America. The billboard in
text: front shows a picture of a FARMER on a tractor and says:
text: "WHEAT KING FARM MACHINERY
dialog: A WEBCO COMPANY."
text: CLOSER -- A remarkable sight: standing at the front door, ringing insistently on
text: a button marked "Night Bell" is a totally transformed GUS GORMAN. He now is
text: attired in the very green-and-white polyester suit that caused him to recoil at
text: first sight. His look and persona are that of a typical midwestern
text: salesman...fast-talking, hard-selling, and square. He carries a very large
dialog: suitcase.
scene_heading: INT. WHEAT KING BUILDING - NIGHT
text: After a moment, we SEE BRAD, in nightwatchman outfit, stumbling down the
text: corridor, already tipsy. He walks through a microphone gizmo embedded about
text: halfway down the glass door.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Yeah? What do you want?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Buddy, are we in trouble.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: (has no idea what in
dialog: hell he's talking about)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (talking very fast,
dialog: giving the befuddled
dialog: BRAD no chance to
dialog: interrupt)
dialog: First the supplier couldn't find
dialog: the invoice. Then the order came
dialog: up short. Then I missed the four
dialog: o'clock plane from Cleveland and
dialog: had to rent a car, and then I got a
dialog: darn flat tire on the highway! Can
dialog: you beat it? Boy, your boss must've
dialog: been furious when I didn't show up
dialog: by the end of the day today, huh?
text: ON BRAD -- in his befogged mind, he senses that something is wrong, but he has
dialog: no idea what in hell it means.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: What are you talkin' about?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Good lord, fella! I'm talking about
dialog: your boss.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Mr. Roebush?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (seemingly frantic
dialog: with worry)
dialog: Roebush! That's the guy! Buddy, he's
dialog: gonna nail our behinds to the wall!
dialog: this is Special Order! He said he had
dialog: to have it before...
dialog: (a sudden realization)
dialog: Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Tuesday.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up
dialog: in his office tonight before all those
dialog: big shots come here tomorrow for
dialog: the meeting!!
text: ON BRAD -- shaking his head, trying to clear it.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Get all what set up?
text: ON GUS -- with a wild smile and a glint in his eye like Robert Helpmann holding
text: out The Red Shoes, he snaps open the lid of the valise. Four shelves,
text: "accordioned" in tiers, spring forward: they contain bottles of every known
text: liquor, whiskey, and spirit	in the world, plus various bartending implements
text: (shakers, stirrers, etc). As GUS grins like the terrible tempter:
text: ON BRAD -- the expression on his face is a wonder to behold. The simple
text: anticipatory greedy delight of a child on Christmas morning. A second later the
text: glass doors slide open with an electronic whoosh.
scene_heading: INT. WHEAT KING PLANT MANAGER'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Some time later. DUS and BRAD are seated at the boss's desk. An incredible array
text: of liquor bottles in evidence, and all open, their contents sampled. A similar
text: line-up of different size glasses, all used and empty. GUS in the style of a
text: slick bartender. Both GUYS are blotto, BRAD a little more so. GUS pours the new
text: concoction into a glass. BRAD samples it.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: S'not bad, s'very good, but...
dialog: y'know what's wrong with this...
dialog: Singapore...thing?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Sling. Singapore Sling. What's
dialog: wrong?
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Not enough vodka in it.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: There's no vodka in it.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Aha! What'd I tell ya!
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: What? What did you tell me?
text: BRAD considers this a while, then holds out his glass.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Put vodka in it.
text: GUS does so, liberally. BRAD takes a big swig.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: S'better. Taste it.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (sips)
dialog: Got vodka in it now. Gotta
dialog: give it a new name. Hey, listen,
dialog: you thought it up, we'll name it
dialog: after you. What's your name?
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Brad.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (considers it)
dialog: Brad is not a good name for a
dialog: cocktail.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: (an idea occurs)
dialog: Hey! Y'know what they used to
dialog: call me in high school?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Brad?
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: No, no, on the football field.
dialog: They called me...
dialog: (drawing himself up
dialog: with boozy pride)
dialog: ...The Smallville Flash.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hey, man, that's a great name
dialog: for a cocktail!
text: They clink glasses in celebration.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Here's to the Smallville Flash!
text: BRAD chug-a-lugs his drink, draining the glass. GUS watches him in drunken
dialog: amazement.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Man, you don't never pass out,
dialog: do ya?
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Nope.
dialog: (he closes his eyes)
dialog: Never.
dialog: (and he passes out)
text: NEW ANGLE -- GUS prods him, sees he's out cold. Now the problem is trying to get
text: on with his business in the highly inebriated state he's in.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Awright. Keys.
text: He goes over to BRAD, removes the key ring from his belt, starts going through
dialog: all the keys.
text: INSERT: Each key is marked with a tag for its location. There are two plastic
dialog: keys marked Computer - A and Computer - B.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (mumbling, puzzled)
dialog: Two keys? Lessee about that...
text: He starts out of the room, takes one look back...BRAD totally comatose now, has
text: slumped down in his chair, half on the floor.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Huh. The Smallville Flash.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR. WHEAT KING OFFICES - NIGHT
text: GUS makes his way, very drunkenly, down the corridors, weaving as he walks.
text: FOLLOW HIM as he turns a corner, where an unexpected mirror causes him to jump
text: back in horror, like W.C. Fields doing a take. It's the suit with him in it that
dialog: makes him shiver and say:
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Man, that is terrifyingly ugly...
text: He enters a room above which is a sign: COMPUTER and beneath it another sign:
speaker_heading: SNACKS.
scene_heading: INT. WHEAT KING VENDING MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT
text: A row of coin-operated vending machines. GUS is just drunk enough to carefully
dialog: check each one out to make sure.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (addressing the
dialog: coffee machine)
dialog: You ain't the computer, man.
dialog: (goes to candy
dialog: machine, examines it)
dialog: You ain't neither.
dialog: (the soft drink
dialog: dispenser)
dialog: Not even close.
text: he continues along the wall with the careful gait of a man trying to remain
text: upright, he stops before a doorway and opens it. A broom and a mop fall out.
text: ANGLE IN -- it's a miniscule, five foot high broom closet, filled with cleaning
dialog: utensils, buckets, etc.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (as the broom
dialog: falls out)
dialog: S'cuse me.
text: He puts the stuff back, shuts the door, opens one remaining door. Inside a small
text: room is the office of Xerox copier, an office supplies cabinet, and a small
text: computer console. It's just as he asked for: A little rinky-dink computer
dialog: operation.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: There's that sucker!
text: He enters.
scene_heading: INT. WHEAT KING COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT
text: GUS sits down in front of the keyboard, shakes his head trying to sober up,
text: looks down, remembers the key.
text: INSERT: he laboriously inserts one of the plastic keys in its slot.
text: ON GUS -- he starts to touch keyboard buttons. Nothing happens.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hey, c'mon, man!
dialog: (tries again,
dialog: no success)
text: Now a sign on the wall above the console catches his eye. He looks up at it.
text: GUD POV: The vision, impaired by booze, is blurry at first. Then double-vision.
text: Then it comes into focus.
text: TWO KEYS REQUIRED TO OPERATE.
scene_heading: KEY - A IN STATION #1
scene_heading: KEY - B IN STATION #2
text: BOTH KEYS MUST BE INSERTED
speaker_heading: AT THE SAME TIME
text: Muttering his displeasure, GUS stands up, wobbly, and looks for Station # 2. he
text: finds it on the other end of the console. As he starts to try and insert the
dialog: second key, he remembers:
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: "At the same time." Oh.
text: He holds one key, poised to enter its slot, and reaches around, stretching
text: himself out, spreading his legs, trying to insert the second key in its slot.
dialog: But the distance is too great for one man to do it.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Damn! Now what'll I do?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WHEAT KING PLANT MANAGER'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: ON BRAD -- as we left him, passed out cold.
text: GUS ENTERS FRAME, shakes BRAD, trying to rouse him.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hey, brother! Hey, Flash!
dialog: (shakes harder, but
dialog: it's useless)
dialog: Shee...
text: Grasping BRAD beneath his arm pits, GUS starts to drag the massive bulk out of
dialog: the office.
scene_heading: INT. WHEAT KING COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT
text: GUS hauls BRAD into the computer room, shoves him in the general area of Station
text: #2, then, with considerable trial and effort, attempts to put the second key in
text: his hand and clench his fingers around it. The general idea is this...
text: GUS must maneuver it so that both keys are inserted simultaneously. in order to
text: do this, he must position BRAD...a passed-out BRAD...so that he falls forward at
text: the proper angle to insert one of the keys as GUS inserts his. His first two
text: tries meet with total failure; BRAD slumps to the floor and/or collapses
text: backwards. Finally, GUS comes up with his own tipsy solution: to keep BRAD erect
text: and correctly positioned, he uses hi yo-yo, ties one end on BRAD, goes back to
text: STATION #1, holding his end of the string, then gently pulls BRAD forward at
text: just the right angles so that his key and GUS'S key enter the computer together.
text: As they do, the display screen lights up and spells out:
speaker_heading: HELLO
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Now you wanna be friends, huh?
text: He starts to type a program on the console. As he does:
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: C'mon now, Gus, sober up.
text: C.U. KEYBOARD -- as his fingers touch buttons.
scene_heading: INT. VARIOUS COMPUTERS
text: A SERIES OF SHOTS of different computers in different places turning and
text: flashing and beeping, etc. Again, the intent is clear: GUS'S computer is
text: contacting other computers.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - DAY
text: Some anonymous office. A computer is evidence. A bell rings. A video display
text: screen lights up.
scene_heading: "NEW INFORMATION: INCOMING"
text: CAMERA ON REAR OF MACHINE: showing the wiring leading out. PAN ALONG CABLE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. CURB OUTSIDE BANK - NIGHT
text: FULL SHOT -- we are on a city street corner by an Instant Cash Machine on the
text: side of a bank.
text: A GUY, ordinary, dressed in jeans and a faded sweatshirt, walks up to the
text: machine and takes a plastic bank card from his wallet.
text: CLOSER ON HIM AND THE MACHINE -- he inserts it in the proper slot. The digital
text: display flashes the usual instructions:
scene_heading: 1. ENTER SECRET CODE
dialog: (the GUY pushes his code)
dialog: 
scene_heading: 2. SELECT MODE: DEPSOIT, WITHDRAWAL
text: SAVINGS, CHECKING.
dialog: (the GUY pushes the
dialog: "Withdrawal" button)
dialog: 
dialog: 3. AMOUNTS: $30, $50, $70, $100.
text: The GUY pushes the $50 button and stands and waits.
dialog: SOUND: the thunk that lets you know money has dropped into the cash drawer.
text: ANGLE DOWN -- he opens the cash drawer. The packet of $50 in small bills is
text: there. But as the GUY starts to reach for it: thunk. Another fifty bucks. Thunk.
text: Another. And another and another and another and another...
text: C.U. the GUY -- his eyes widen in astonishment.
text: TIGHT ANGLE -- the money keeps dropping into the drawer.
text: PAN UP-- the GUY stifles a yelp of joy, not wanting to call attention to
text: himself. He stuffs money in every available packet as fast as he can, as the
text: cash keeps dropping into the drawer. he smiles nonchalantly at passers by as he
text: keeps filling up.
scene_heading: INT. WHEAT KING COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT
text: GUS shakes his head, no, and pushes another key.
text: ON THE VIDEO DISPLAY -- it reads. "CLEAR, NEW PROGRAM."

dialog: wife's kisser.
scene_heading: EXT. LANA'S HOUSE - DAY
text: CLARK KENT, holding a little bouquet, stands on the porch of a typical
text: Midwestern house. LANA, in her apron, has come out to welcome him. They are
text: looking at an old-fashioned porch swing.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Gee, I always loved porch swings.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Me too. That's why I put this
dialog: one up.
text: She sits in it toward the middle. he comes over and...slightly shy...sits more
text: towards one side. The swing instantly tilts toward that side. LANA uphill, CLARK
dialog: downhill.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Maybe it's be better if you moved
dialog: over here a little...
text: CLARK slides over until the swing levels off. He is very close to LANA. She
text: smiles up at him. And just at that moment:
text: NEW ANGLE -- the door opens and RICKY sticks his head out. CLARK and LANA move
text: imperceptibly apart.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Hey, you wanna see my room,
dialog: Mr. Kent?
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (a little smile)
dialog: He decorated it himself.
dialog: (now she means
dialog: the swing)
dialog: Should have used chains instead
dialog: of rope.
text: CLARK, lost again, shakes his head.
scene_heading: INT. RICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: ON CLARK -- For a brief moment, a bit taken aback by what he sees.
text: WHAT HE SEES: A perfectly ordinary kid's bedroom, which is not surprisingly,
text: hung with large posters of SUPERMAN that seem to be looking right back at CLARK.
text: C.U. CLARK -- the fleeting smile on his face seems to mean, "life is sure funny
dialog: sometimes."
speaker_heading: TWO SHOT
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Do you really know Superman?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (lightly)
dialog: We get together sometimes.
text: RICKY nods. he sits on the edge of his bed, just looking thoughtfully at CLARK.
dialog: Finally:
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (ready for anything)
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Could you get me Superman's

scene_heading: EXT. WHEAT KING INDUSTRIAL PARK - NIGHT
dialog: LONG SHOT -- All is quiet.
scene_heading: INT. WHEAT KING VENDING MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT
text: Nobody is here. PAN to broom closet door. It slowly opens. GUS emerges after
text: spending the entire day wedged in the tiny, narrow space. He's bent in what
text: looks like a permanent 45-degree angle. He's miserable, unshaven, uncomfortable
dialog: and...most of all...hungover. One of the all-time hangovers. Moaning and
text: groaning, he steps out, tries to straighten up and fails. Then he sort of
dialog: manages.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (clutching his head)
dialog: Oh, God, this is worse'n being drunk.
text: A broom falls. The noise makes him wince.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Worse'n being dead.
text: Looks at himself in mirror of vending machine, shudders, sticks out his tongue,
text: examines it with horror.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Black coffee. That's what I
dialog: need.
dialog: (gets coins from
dialog: pocket)
dialog: Gotta have it. Gotta...
text: He puts coins in the Hot Coffee machine. Click. Buzz.
text: ON THE MACHINE -- attached to the side are a stack of removable plastic cup
text: holders. But GUS doesn't realize he has to take one and hold it in the inset to
text: catch the cup that will drop. The cup that drops is a pointed cone type. Quickly
text: GUS grabs it to steady it; an instant later scalding hot coffee fills the cup.
text: ON GUS -- yanking his hand out, holding the burning paper cup, in great pain. He
text: can't hold onto it, puts it down on the machine's top, and it spills coffee on
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (angry)
dialog: I know that be Colombian coffee!
dialog: I just know it!
dialog: (menacingly)
dialog: Gonna fix your wagon, man.
text: He goes to the computer room.
scene_heading: INT. WHEAT KING COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT
text: He partially inserts both plastic card keys in their slots. Then as he pushes
text: one in by hand, he karate kicks the other in. He sits down at the keyboard,
text: shakes his head and starts to punch a program on the console. As he does:
scene_heading: ON VIDEO DISPLAY:		"HELLO"
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Ah, shut up.
text: He pushes some keys.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Gonna get this thing right
dialog: if it kills me.
scene_heading: INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS
text: More computers flashing and turning and working.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET. INTERSECTION - DAY
text: ON A LOT OF PEDESTRIANS standing on the corner of a busy city intersection,
text: looking at the traffic light.
text: ON THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL -- one of those types that has a little figure of a
text: standing man that lights up red for DON'T WALK and a figure of a walking man
text: that lights up green for WALK. The green man lights up.
text: ON THE PEOPLE -- they start to cross the street. On the intersecting corner, a
text: similar CROWD of PEOPLE waits for the light to change so they can cross.
speaker_heading: SUDDENLY:
text: ON THE LIGHT -- the green light man goes off and the red light man comes on.
text: ON THE STREET -- caught in the middle of the street, the walking PEOPLE obey the
text: signal and stop. The CROWD on the other corner, obeying their sign, start to
dialog: walk.
text: VARIOUS ANGLES -- halfway across, the light changes again. The first GROUP tries
text: to continue walking, but bumps into the second GROUP, now standing in their way.
text: ON THE SIGNAL -- completely out of control now, thanks to computer malfunction,
text: it goes from little green Walk Man to little Red Stop Man with no discernable
dialog: logic.
text: ON THE STREET -- it's like a ballet of confusion, as the hapless PEDESTRIANS
dialog: bang into each other.
text: ON THE LIGHT -- as the signals keep switching back and forth:
text: EFFECTS: ANIMATION -- the little Red Man loses his temper and reaches down and
text: socks the Little Green Man. The Little Green Man hits him back.
dialog: Chaos and confusion.
scene_heading: INT. WHAT KING COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT
text: A very frustrated GUS seated at his little computer, trying it one more time.
speaker_heading: GUS

speaker_heading: X3
text: The machine makes a little noise, then the word appears:
text: INPOERATIVE.
speaker_heading: GUS

dialog: Oh, no...
dialog: He tries again:
speaker_heading: XYR8US
dialog: (after a moment)
speaker_heading: X4
text: A long pause. the machine makes a slightly different noise. And then, on the

speaker_heading: CONFIRMED.
text: ON GUS -- triumphant at last.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I am a genius.
scene_heading: ON VISDEO DISPLAY SCREEN
scene_heading: "REQUEST COORDINATES"

speaker_heading: GUS

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DEEP SPACE

speaker_heading: FAR AWAY.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY

speaker_heading: LOCATION: COLUMBIA
speaker_heading: SOUTH AMERICA.
scene_heading: INT. WHEAT KING COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Awright. Now...
text: He pushes some more buttons.
scene_heading: EXT. BORDER PATROL STATIONS. COLUMBIA - DAY
text: FULL SHOT -- a little border patrol shack. The sign above it, in Spanish, says
text: "YOU ARE NOW ENTERING COLUMBIA. PASSPORT CONTROL."
text: Inside, we can SEE ONE GUARD at his desk. Outside, dozing in a chair tilted
text: against the side of the shack, is a SECOND UNIFORMED GUARD. IN B.G. we SEE the
text: approaching tornado on the horizon.
text: CLOSE ON THE SECOND GUARD -- snoring away peacefully. Suddenly -- a drop of
text: water hits his nose. Then another. Then a sprinkle begins to fall. He comes
text: awake, startled. Looks up in surprise.
text: POV: LOOKING UP -- storm clouds everywhere. Suddenly a bolt of lightening.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: (leaping from
dialog: his chair)
dialog: Caramba!
text: He runs into the shack. A moment later, torrential rain starts to fall.

dialog: breaking.
text: The furrows beneath them filling with water.
text: 3. Trees nearby uprooted, falling across the fields.
scene_heading: 4. EXT. FARM, COLUMBIA - DAY
text: A primitive irrigation system: a DONKEY tethered to a pole walks in a constant
text: circle, causing a wooden paddle wheel to turn, scooping up water from a well and
text: lifting it above ground to the fields where it cascades down the rows of plowed
text: fields between rows of coffee plants. (PROCESS SHOWN IN QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS).
text: As the storm rises, the DONKEY panics, breaks free of the rope, and runs for
text: cover as the rain starts.
scene_heading: 5. EXT. LITTLE FARM HOUSE - DAY
text: A small mud-hut farm house on the edge of a coffee plantation. A PEASANT FAMILY
text: clusters in the doorway, fearfully watching the incredible destruction outside.
text: CLOSER ON THEM -- the FATHER hugs his CHILD to his side. Behind them, inside the
text: one-room hut we SEE the MOTHER kneeling and praying at a simple shrine with a
text: little statue of the Virgin. The flame from the votary candles flickers and is
text: blown out by the wind.
scene_heading: 6. EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE, CLOMBIA - DAY
text: The sky is darkened here, but the rains have not yet reached the village. IN

text: café on the other side.
scene_heading: 7. INT. CAFÉ, VILLAGE SQUARE, COLUMBIA - DAY
text: The OWNER and TWO WAITERS are busy decorating a wedding cake. IN B.G. we SEE the

text: REVERSE: In a back pew, taking pictures with an Instamatic and thrilled to be
text: there watching an authentic South American wedding, are MR. AND MRS. MAURY
text: STOKIS, the JINGO winners enjoying their trip. She dabs a sentimental tear; he
text: snaps photos. Suddenly:
text: Sound: Thunder cracks. Fierce wind.
text: They look up fearfully from the ceremony as:
text: A stained glass window breaks and smashes to the floor.
text: MIDWAY DURING THE ABOVE SEQUENCES, WE BEGIN TO hear on sound track the voice of
text: a TELEVISION NEWS COMMENTATOR.
speaker_heading: T.V. COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
text: Meteorologists are baffled by the
dialog: tornado and torrential rain storms
dialog: that struck the South American
dialog: country of Colombia this afternoon,
dialog: threatening to destroy this nation's
dialog: entire coffee crop for the next five
dialog: years. The loss of the major export
dialog: would devastate that already strife-
text: torn region's economy. Meanwhile,
text: the tornado continues to pound with
text: devastating force. Gale force winds up
dialog: to an incredible 200 mph lash the
dialog: countryside, while 12 inches of

dialog: in just one day.
text: At this point, we CONTINUE TO SEE IMAGES OF THE DESTRUCTION, BUT NOW THEY ARE

scene_heading: 9. EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE, COLOMBIA - DAY
text: The rain and wind hit the square full force.
text: The church bell begins tolling out of control. blown by the wind. ANGLE UP ON

text: T.V. SCREEN: BEGIN TO PULL BACK REEALING THIS ON T.V. SCREEN as we SEE the T.V.
text: NEWS COMMENTATOR seated at his desk, looking at CAMERA:
scene_heading: T.V. NEWS COMMENTATOR
dialog: Flood warnings have given way to

dialog: spokesman for the Department of
dialog: Meteorology at Cal Tech here said

dialog: awesome display of natural forces
dialog: unleashed since Noah's Ark." He
dialog: added that the storm's pattern seems
dialog: to defy all known laws of weather
dialog: systems to...
text: Right around here, we begin to hear maniacal laughter off-screen. CAMERA HAS
text: PULLED BACK TO REVEAL the T. V. screen, but it is not yet clear WHERE WE ARE.
text: The man laughing is ROSS WEBSTER and we hear him say:
speaker_heading: ROSS (o.s.)
dialog: Turn it off, turn it off! If I
dialog: laugh any harder, I'll split
dialog: my sides.
scene_heading: REVERSE. WE ARE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. PENTHOUSE. ROOFTOP "SKI RESORT" - DAY
text: (AT THIS POINT WE CAN'T TELL EXACTLY WHERE WEARE) ON ROSS, in snazzy ski togs,

text: the bottom of the slope, reclining on a deck chair, wearing skin-tight ski-suit,
text: holding a reflector to her face, to enhance her tan, is LORELEI. As ROSS comes
text: to a stop, he sends a great spray of 'snow' all over LORELEI. She shrieks
dialog: playfully.
speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: Ooooooh, I'll get you for that,
dialog: you big silly!
text: ON VERA -- wincing with distaste at this baby-talk baloney, she sits nearby on a
text: chair reading a book entitled: "A BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO COMPUTERS."
text: NEW ANGLE, LONG AND WIDE -- As VERA gets up to switch off the portable T.V. set
dialog: at the bottom of the slope, we get our first real look at this extraordinary
text: setting. A private "ski resort" has been constructed on the terrace of the
text: Webster penthouse. While we SEE the skyline of Metropolis in B. G. and the
text: CITIZENS OF METROPOLIS in summer clothing on the streets below, what ROSS has
text: installed up here is a total winter environment. At the foot of the slope is the
text: little Swiss chalet "set" for apres-ski; we glimpse a fireplace, a bar, etc. in
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: (quivering voice)
dialog: Bubba, do you realize what we're onto?
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (happily)
dialog: Do I? Every time a drunk tries

dialog: Webster coffee!
text: C.U. VERA -- eyes burning with a great idea.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: (dramatically)
dialog: Why stop at coffee!
dialog: (seeing the vision)
dialog: A cup of coffee gets the world
dialog: off to work in the morning,
dialog: but what keeps the world working?
speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: Diet soda?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Energy! And when they say "Energy"
dialog: what do they mean? Nuclear? too
dialog: dangerous. Solar?? Too underdeveloped.

speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: We already have a super-tanker.
speaker_heading: VERA

speaker_heading: ROSS

dialog: I could have it all! Holy cats!
dialog: All the oil! All the tankers! All

dialog: will be out to lunch! No heat, no
dialog: gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
text: At which point GUS enters, flipping a fancier yo-yo (the walnut executive
text: model), looking very nervous and disturbed about something.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hey, boss.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Just the man I wanted to see!
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Turn on the T.V.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSS

scene_heading: T.V. NEWS COMMENTATOR
dialog: ...and in an all-out effort, Superman
dialog: has been simply awesome. Awesome in

dialog: One man -- a super man, to be sure --

text: (FIRST IMAGES OF SUPERMAN AT WORK APPEAR ON T.V. SCREEN, THEN GO TO NORMAL FILM

scene_heading: A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS:
text: 1. Battling through turbulence, with tremendous bolts of lightening around him,
text: SUPERMAN flies through the Colombian sky.
scene_heading: 2. EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE, COLOMBIA - DAY
text: The little church, buffeted by the storm, is starting to collapse. The mud-
text: stucco facade cracks, begins to sag and crumble.
text: Just as the façade starts to go, MR. AND MRS. MAURY STOKIS come barreling out of
text: the church, hell-for-leather. He turns and tries to take one last snapshot of
dialog: the spectacle.
speaker_heading: MRS. STOKIS
dialog: Maury! Forget the pictures!
text: The wall falls on top of them and they're lost from sight.
text: Moments later, the WEDDING PARTY, running for their lives, comes pouring out of
text: the church. Buffeted by the gale-force winds, soaked to the skin, they try to
text: cross the square to the relative safety of the café across the way.
text: ANGLE UP -- a tremendous gust of wind looses the bell from its moorings in the
text: steeple. The tremendous iron bell goes flying across the square, heading right
text: for the fleeing BRIDE and GROOM.
text: SUPERMAN zooms in and just in time catches the bell in his arms before it gets
dialog: to the people.
text: EFFECTS: The vibrations of the bell cause SUPERMAN to vibrate at a rapid rate.
text: Accompanied by...sound: incessant clanging of the bell.
scene_heading: 3. EXT. COFFEE PLANTATION, FILEDS - DAY
text: LONG SHOT -- the fields flooding with water in the furrowed rows between the

text: EFFECTS: Rays of Heat-Vision dart from his eyes and sweep across the field. The
text: result is astonishing: he has dried up all the water.
text: 4. ON THE WATER WHEEL -- SUPERMAN grabs the strut that was attached to the
text: donkey and begins running at Super-Speed in the opposite (counter-clockwise)
dialog: direction.
text: IN A SERIES OF SHOTS, WE SEE THE EFFECT REVERSED: The water in the affected

speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: No! No! No!
text: In his fury he pounds the arms of his folding chair so hard that it folds up
text: with him in it.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (thrashing around,
dialog: enraged)
dialog: It was perfect! It was the
dialog: perfect plan! It was foolproof.
text: As she beats LORELEI in a footrace to see which one will reach ROD+SS first to
text: help him out of his folding chair, PAN TO GUS. Looking miserable and out-of-it,
text: he is talking to himself (nobody else is paying attention to him) as he wanders
text: over to a pair of skis with boots attached laying nearby.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (aloud, but to
dialog: himself)
dialog: Just a matter of time 'til they
dialog: start blamin' me. that's always
dialog: what happens.
text: He slips his feet into the ski boots, curious to try them. FOLLOW HIM as he
text: starts to walk clumsily up the slope, trying to master his balance in this odd
dialog: footwear.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Ain't my fault, I done what I was
dialog: supposed to do.
dialog: (climbing up
dialog: awkwardly)
dialog: Everybody blames it on me when
dialog: they start lookin' to get it off
dialog: themselves. Some kid in the
text: classroom blows a spit-ball,
dialog: who gets sent to the principle's
dialog: office? Gus Gorman.
text: He continues up the slope, feet splayed wide apart, slipping and sliding, he is
text: petulant, self-pitying.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder,
dialog: he ruined it.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Don't cry, Bubba.
text: ROSS stomps off into the snow, feeling sorry for himself.
text: FAVORING LORELEI --annoyed at VERA'S ass-kissing, she stands up holding a
text: steaming mug of mulled wine that has been sitting on the table beside her. She
text: dips the cheese-cloth bag of spices...like an outsized tea-bag...that has been
text: seeping in the cup, then takes it out. Carrying it by its string (it is dripping
text: boiling hot wine and waves of steam are rising from it), she stoops beside VERA
text: and seems about to drop the hot bag in VERA'S wastebasket. Instead, she drops it
text: on the unsuspecting VERA'S outstretched hand.
text: Which brings VERA leaping and screaming to her feet, her burned hand flying into
dialog: the air.
speaker_heading: VERA
speaker_heading: AIEEEE!
text: ROSS spins around, to see VERA in this agitated position.
speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: (quickly)
text: Vera's practicing her karate.
text: Trying to put a good front on it, VERA has no choice but to continue with a
text: series of cries and arm chops. But she uses the last two to give LORELEI a
text: genuine karate blow in the gut. LORELEI doubles over. VERA, pretending it is
text: just the usual bowing ritual at the end of a karate exhibition, also bows.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Nice try, Butch, but it wouldn't
dialog: be effective against Superman.
dialog: (railing)
dialog: You'll see! Now that he's pulled
dialog: this stunt, he'll stick his nose in
dialog: my oil scheme and ruin that one,
dialog: too! I've got to get rid of him!
dialog: I've got to!
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: How? Shoot him? You know about
dialog: him and bullets. Not to mention

speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: (contemptuously)
dialog: How would you know?
speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: (off minded)
dialog: Hey, I know a lot of things!
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: So I understand from the
dialog: graffiti I've seen.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Wait a minute! She's right!
dialog: Kryptonite. I remember reading
dialog: about it in an interview with him.
dialog: (crestfallen)
dialog: Nuts...
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: I just remembered the rest. There
dialog: isn't any more. The only chunk
dialog: that ever landed on Earth disappeared
dialog: a couple of years ago. It was in this
dialog: story in the Daily Planet.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Where did it come from?
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: The planet Superman came from.
dialog: Krypton.
text: ON GUS -- at the top of the slope.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up.
dialog: That's how come they shipped the
dialog: dude to Earth when he was a baby.
dialog: (pause, as they all
dialog: look oddly at GUS)
dialog: well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Wait a second. Astronomers know
dialog: where the planet used to be, right?
dialog: And you know what happens when
dialog: a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces
text: floating in space.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: So all we've got to do is pick up the
dialog: garbage.
dialog: (warming to it)
dialog: We just have to find our where in
dialog: Heaven Krypton used to be. Then
dialog: good old Gus here contacts the

speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Just hold on a minute. I have been
dialog: doin' some thinkin'
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: God, that's what I keep you for.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: That's what I been thinkin' about.
dialog: How you been keepin' me.
dialog: (pause: nervously
dialog: but bravely)
dialog: I ain't getting' nothing outta this
dialog: gig.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's
dialog: greed.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (outraged)
dialog: Greed!
dialog: (extremely agitated)
dialog: Let me tell you something---
text: In his burst of anger, he loses his equilibrium and suddenly starts to plummet
text: down the ski slope.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WEBSTER PENTHOUSE, BUILDING - DAY
text: LONG SHOT -- GUS goes zooming down the slope at great speed. With no poles and
text: no knowledge of how to stop, he keeps going right off the roof, sailing out into
text: the air. At the end of his trajectory, gravity takes over. He falls straight
text: down )CAMERA PANS DOWN TO WATCH) ten stories and lands on an awning above the
text: doorway of the apartment building. This, in turn, functions as a min-slope, and
text: he skis right off it and lands in the middle of the street.
text: ON HE STREET: Cars brake to a halt; PEDESTRIANS are startled to see a man on
text: skis suddenly landing in their midst. GUS, once he's realized he's all right,
text: tries to carry it off as if he knew what he was doing all along. He saunters off
dialog: down the road with a forced display of cool, if you can call a guy on skis
text: clomping down a city street "sauntering."
text: AS WE WATCH GUS clomp away, ROSS'S DIALOGUE CONTINUES AS A VOICE-OVER as we SEE:
scene_heading: EXT. DEEP SPACE
text: As he described it, chunks of glowing green Kryptonite drifting in space.
scene_heading: INT. WEBCO DATA PROCESSING CENTER - DAY
text: As we SEE GUS back at his old, original spot, muttering to himself as he rolls
text: up his sleeve and begins to play the computer like a wurlitzer, ROSS'S voice-
dialog: over continues:
speaker_heading: ROSS (v.o.)
dialog: Once Gus contacts the Vulcan
text: satellite, he orders it to search
dialog: through outer space around
dialog: where Krypton went bye-bye.
text: During the above speech, GUS'S coordinates appear ON THE COMPUTER DISPLAY
speaker_heading: SCREEN:
dialog: 
text: LOCATE AND SEARCH X GALAXY AT 3500 LIGHT YEARS.
text: A beat. Then, as he punches more buttons, another message appears ON COMPUTER
text: DISPLAY SCREEN below the first:
text: ANALYZE COMPONENT ELEMENTS OF KRYPTONITE PARTICLES.
text: Another beat. THE DISPLAY SCREEN GOES BLANK. GUS waits, and then an answer
text: appears ON THE DISPLAY SCREEN:
text: INSTRUCTIONS RECEIVED . . .
scene_heading: EFFECTS: BLIPS ON DISPLAY SCREEN:
text: message continues ON DISPLAY SCREEN.
text: SCANNING . . .
text: The satellite shoots a beam out and up. FOLLOW THE BEAM through the deep blue,
text: still faintly sunlit atmosphere and up into the eternal night of deep space.
scene_heading: EXT. DEEP SPACE - NIGHT
text: The searching satellite beam discovers glowing green particles of Kryptonite
text: drifting in this very distant darkness. As it plays over them like a flashlight:
scene_heading: ROSS"S VOICE-OVER DIALOGUE CONTINUES:
speaker_heading: ROSS (v.o.)
dialog: Then the laser probe simply
text: locks onto a floating chunk of
dialog: Kryptonite, the computer
dialog: analyzes the components and
text: the boys in the lab duplicate
dialog: the stuff down here.
scene_heading: INT. WEBCO DATA PROCESSING CENTER - DAY
text: As we hear various humming, clicking, and whirring noises:
text: ON THE BLANK COMPUTER DISPLAY SCREEN ... it begins to show a message:
scene_heading: KRYPTONITE ... AN INTENSE HEAT FUSION OF:
text: Below it quickly prints the composition, element by element:
scene_heading: PLUTONIUM . . . 15.08%
dialog: TANTALUM . . . 18.0	%
dialog: XENON . . . 27.71%
scene_heading: PROMETHIUM . . 24.02%
text: C.U. GUS -- watching gleefully.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
text: ON COMPUTER DISPLAY SCREEN -- the computer has added to the list:
dialog: DIALUM . . . 10.62%
dialog: MERCURY . . . 4.08%
text: Sound: the whirring and clicking stop.
text: GUS smiles broadly as he reaches to tear off the printout sheet. He's done it!
dialog: But suddenly:
text: Sound: the whirring and clicking begin again.
text: The printout sheet emerges a little further as an addition to the list appears
scene_heading: ON THE COMPUTER DISPLAY SCREEN:
dialog: UNKNOWN . . . 0.57%
text: He ponders a moment. looks down. Sees something.
text: INSERT: A pack of his cigarettes on the table beside him. It's one of the low-
dialog: tar brands and we SEE the listing on the package: NICOTINE 8%, TAR 5%.
text: CLOSE ON GUS -- He takes an electronic eraser (a pencil-like gadget, attached
text: by wires to the machine) and carefully rubs it across the line on the video
text: display screen just where the word "UNKNOWN" appears. then he types in a new
dialog: word:
dialog: TAR . . . 0.57%
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: He ain't gonna smoke this stuff,
dialog: so what the hell...
text: He carefully tears the printout sheet. WIDEN SHOT as he leaves the DATA
text: PROCESSING CENTER and heads down the corridor. FOLLOW HIM UNTIL:
scene_heading: INT. WEBCO, MAIN OFFICES. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: GUS stops at a door marked:
scene_heading: WEBCO -- RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
text: After a beat, the door is opened very slightly by a WHITE-COATED SCIENTIST.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (giving him a bright
dialog: smile and the altered
dialog: printout sheet)
dialog: The Boss says he wants this to go.
scene_heading: INT. DAILY PLANET, CITY ROOM - DAY
text: Looking absolutely furious, MR. STOKIS is making his way with considerable
text: difficulty past the desks of REPORTERS, heading for PERRY'S office. The
text: considerable difficulty is due to the fact that (a) he has one leg in a plaster
text: cast that goes up to his hip, (b) he walks with a crutch to help him, (c) he has
text: one arm in a sling and (d) with his other arm he is propelling before him a
text: wheelchair containing MRS. STOKIS, who has both legs in a plaster cast as well
text: as a neck brace. Following them, trying to stop them, is a desperate MISS
speaker_heading: HENDERSON.
speaker_heading: MR. STOKIS
dialog: Where is he? He'll pay for this!
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Get your wallet out, Mr. Editor!
speaker_heading: MISS HENDERSON
dialog: (trying to stop him)
dialog: Please, Mr. Stokis, it isn't Mr.
dialog: White's fault if ---
speaker_heading: MR. STOKIS
dialog: Don't touch me!
text: AS THEY CONTINUE OUT OF FRAME TOWARD PERRY WHITE'S OFFICE IN B.G. HOLD ON CLARK
text: -- who looks up momentarily from his typewriter then goes back to work intently
dialog: on his reunion story.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (trying a line
dialog: out loud)
dialog: "Old relationships suddenly seem
dialog: the same as ever."
dialog: (a little smile
dialog: as he writes)
dialog: "The prettiest girl in the school
dialog: is still the prettiest girl..."
text: Sound: The phone rings. CLARK grabs it.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello?
dialog: (happily)
dialog: Lana! Hey, I was just thinking
dialog: about--
dialog: (his smile turns to
dialog: a worried frown)
dialog: What's wrong? ...what about Ricky?
scene_heading: INT. LANA'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: ON LANA -- upset, talking on the phone.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Well, that autograph you got him
dialog: from Superman -- he got really
dialog: carried away after that and told
dialog: the other kids that Superman's
dialog: his pal. And he said Superman's
dialog: even coming to visit him for his
dialog: birthday next Wednesday.
dialog: (catching a breath)
dialog: Okay, it was wrong. But when
dialog: Wednesday comes...and Superman
dialog: doesn't...
scene_heading: INT. RICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: A very forlorn and ashamed RICKY stands in his doorway, listening.
scene_heading: INT. DAILY PLANET, CLARK KENT'S DESK - DAY
speaker_heading: ON CLARK
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (into the phone
dialog: earnestly)
dialog: No, well in this case I think
dialog: I can speak for him.
dialog: (hastily)
dialog: I mean, I'm pretty close to him,
dialog: you know.
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: Superman will be there on
dialog: Wednesday.
scene_heading: INT. LANA'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (into the phone,
dialog: her voice trembling
dialog: with happiness)
dialog: Well, he's going to get the best
dialog: home-cooked meal he's had in...
dialog: in a long time. You tell Superman
dialog: we think he's wonderful.
scene_heading: INT. RICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: RICKY'S face lights up with joy and relief as he understands.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (softly, into the phone)
dialog: But Clark...you're the best.
scene_heading: INT. DAILY PLANET, CLARK KENT'S DESK - DAY
text: ON CLARK -- hanging up slowly. No one ever said that to him before.
text: Behind him, and for some time now, a considerable commotion has been going on in
text: PERRY'S office. CAMERA NOW ZOOMS PAST CLARK TO SEE PERRY and MR. STOKIS in a
text: screaming match, while a distraught MISS HENDERSON wrings her hands and an
text: immobile MRS. STOKIS just sits in her wheelchair.
speaker_heading: MR. STOKIS
dialog: Bad luck??!! I'll give you
dialog: bad luck!!! I'm suing you!
dialog: I'm suing your paper! I'm
dialog: suing her---
dialog: (points to MISS HENDERSON)
dialog: And I'll take it to the Supreme
dialog: Court if I have to!!
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: It wasn't our fault. It was an
dialog: act of God!
speaker_heading: MR. STOKIS
dialog: In a church????!!
scene_heading: INT. WEBCO INDUSTRIES MAIN OFFICES. SMALL EMPTY OFFICE - DAY
text: ON GUS-- waiting in a little room practicing his yo-yo. By now he's finally
dialog: mastered up-and-down and is into (badly) some tricks like "walking the dog." He
text: makes a few tries and almost jumps when a finger taps his shoulder sharply from
dialog: behind.
text: WIDEN TO TWO SHOT -- the white-clad SCIENTIST to whom GUS gave the formula is
text: holding a laboratory tray with a glowing green chunk of Kryptonite on it. He
text: sets the tray on the desk in front of GUS.
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: (very superior)
dialog: Here you are. I can't imagine
dialog: what you want with it, but you've
dialog: got it.
text: He leaves. GUS eyes the Kryptonite warily, finally forces himself to reach for
text: it, and picks it up so gingerly that he almost drops it. Which redoubles his
text: terror...until he suddenly realizes.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hey, what'm I scared of?
dialog: I'm an Earthling.
scene_heading: EXT. SMALLVILLE MAIN STREET. WOODED PLATFORM - DAY
text: C.U. RICKY -- dressed in his Sunday best and bursting with pride.
text: PULL BACK TO THREE SHOT -- RICKY couldn't be happier, with his MOTHER on one
text: side and SUPERMAN on the other. They are all seated on rather narrow, rickety
text: folding chairs, smiling out at US.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: (to LANA, vaguely
dialog: embarrassed)
dialog: You know, I really wasn't
dialog: expecting all this.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Well...I guess they did get
text: a little carried away.
text: CONTINUE PULLBACK TO WIDE SHOT TO REVEAL how Smallville gets "carried away." A
text: wooden platform, the type they put up for 4th of July speeches and ceremonies,
text: has been erected in the middle of Main Street. Seated there, in addition to
text: SUPERMAN, LANA, and RICKY, are LOCAL DIGNITARIES looking pleased as punch.
text: The MAYOR is clearing his throat at a microphone. A table has been set up beside
text: him and on it are some gifts for SUPERMAN. A banner, stretched across MAIN
text: STREET, reads "SMALLVILLE WELCOMES SUPERMAN." Crowded around the platform are
text: TOWNSPEOPLE, young and old. A few yards away the HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING BAND,
text: brass buttons gleaming, awaits their cue.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Superman, we all know you're not
dialog: looking for honors and awards.
dialog: But when we heard that you were
dialog: coming to see your pal Ricky...
text: C.U. RICKY -- grinning so wide it almost splits his cheeks.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: ...we realized this was our chance
dialog: to say thank you. First, for putting
dialog: out a forest fire that could have
dialog: ruined miles of timberland. Second,
dialog: for averting a terrible tragedy at the
dialog: Iroquois Trail Nuclear power Plant.
dialog: And not least, for saving little Ricky.
dialog: So, since you already have won the
dialog: key to our hearts, Superman, may I
dialog: present you with...
dialog: (picks up a presentation
text: box from table, opens
dialog: it, takes out a big gold-
dialog: plated key)
dialog: ...the key to the city.
text: SUPERMAN rises, gratefully accepts it, holds it for the crowd to see, then puts
text: it down on the table. Applause.
text: PEOPLE with Instamatics and Polaroids snapping away.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Not to be outdone by the
dialog: office of the Mayor, the
dialog: Ladies' Auxiliary would
dialog: like you to have...
text: (he hands him a spiral-
dialog: bound thin volume)
dialog: ...The Smallville Cookbook.
text: SUPERMAN takes it, graciously declines the offer of the microphone, and smiles
text: at a gaggle of LADIES in the front row.
text: ON THE LADIES -- smiling back, thrilled, like senior groupies.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: Thank you, ladies. I'm sure this
dialog: will come in handy.
text: Suddenly, a burst of music comes blasting out nearby and coming closer: stirring
text: military martial air like "The Caissons Go Rolling Along," blaring through loud-
dialog: speakers.
text: All heads turn, startled to see:
text: ANGLE DOWN THE MAIN STREET -- Coming toward the reviewing stand is a khaki-
text: colored car (or jeep), the words U.S. ARMY stenciled on the door. One of those
text: loudspeakers of the type used by cars traveling around town advertising
text: elections or concerts is mounted on the roof and is the source of the march
text: music. As the car gets CLOSER TO F. G. WE SEE that the driver, in WAC uniform is
text: VERA. Seated in the back seat, wearing the uniform of a 5-Star General with all
dialog: the accouterments we associate with General Patton (white "dress" helmet, ascot
text: foulard, jodhpurs, swagger stick in hand) is GUS.
text: NEW ANGLE -- the car comes to a screeching halt by the reviewing stand.
text: Considerable curiosity from the crowd as VERA, in crisp no-nonsense manner,
text: steps out and commands:
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Ten-hut!
text: The CROWD, conditioned by years of watching war movies, instantly and
text: unquestioningly, rises to attention.
text: Upright in posture, authoritative in manner, slapping his swagger stick against
text: his side, GUS surveys the crowd with an air of critical skepticism, then mounts
dialog: the platform.
text: ON SUPERMAN -- A bit curious himself at all this. Beside him the MAYOR is
text: standing stiffly at attention as if his spine would snap.
text: GROUP SHOT -- Total silence. GUS strides across the platform as if surveying his
text: troops, scowls a bit. Then does what he thinks is a gesture of authority and
text: command: he slaps the side of his leg with his swagger stick. He does it too
text: hard, though, and it hurts. A fleeting look of pain, which he tries to conceal.
text: Then, to the podium:
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (using a Patton-like
dialog: voice and delivery)
dialog: Listen up! I've come here direct
dialog: from the Pentagon so you better
dialog: believe there's a damn good reason!
dialog: I'm here to tell you that God has
dialog: given us the greatest goddamn gift
dialog: in the world: nuclear power! But
dialog: if we don't protect it, it's our ass!
dialog: And democracy's ass! And the
dialog: free world's ass!
text: The OLD LADIES look a bit shocked; the MEN in the crowd nod with patriotic
dialog: fervor.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You people want to be able to
dialog: go to church on Sunday and sit
dialog: in the Super Bowl, don't you?
text: (he pounds his swagger
dialog: stick on the podium
dialog: for emphasis; it breaks)
dialog: But what about the peacetime uses
dialog: of nuclear power? You all want some
dialog: Ay-rabs in white robes tellin' you
dialog: you got to pay through the nose for
dialog: their Cadillac limousines so you can
dialog: get enough juice to light up your
dialog: Christmas tree??! Not to mention
dialog: the nice clean air so the great
dialog: American bald eagle can fly
dialog: without coughin' himself to death!
text: ON SUPERMAN -- listening, thinking about it.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Now last week half this great
dialog: nation almost bit the bullet, nuclear-
dialog: power-wise. Wasn't anything the
dialog: military	 could do about it -- we
dialog: were busy protecting our borders
dialog: at the time it happened. So I say,
dialog: thank the good lord above for
dialog: Superman!
text: Applause. SUPERMAN looks humble, a bit chagrined.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Just when it looked like curtains--
dialog: and I don't mean just the Iron
dialog: Curtain, I mean all the curtains! --
dialog: Along came this great American!
speaker_heading: (points to SUPERMAN)
dialog: Superman, you saved our bacon.
dialog: We want to show our gratitude.
text: GUS snaps his fingers imperiously at VERA, who stands below the platform.
text: ON VERA -- snarling at having to play this subservient role, she mounts the
text: platform, carrying a wooden presentation box about a foot high. She hands it to
dialog: GUS.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I want to present you with this
dialog: token of appreciation for what
dialog: did to stop the disaster at Iroquois
dialog: Trail. It's your government's way
dialog: of saying, "Hey buddy, you done
dialog: real good."
text: He opens it. There, glowing and gleaming against the velvet background, is a
text: small statue in the shape of the nuclear plant cooling tower we saw earlier. We
text: recognize its green glow immediately as the Kryptonite we saw before.
text: ON SUPERMAN -- as he lifts it out and holds it aloft, we hear the CROWD oohing
text: and aahing. but as he takes the statue out and studies it:
text: EFFECTS: INSERT--the gleam suddenly dies. in his hand, the statue goes dull and
text: then darkens to a sinister, poisonous greenish-black.
text: ON SUPERMAN -- A little uncertain but otherwise unchanged. he eyes the ugly,
dialog: burnt-out shape and summons all his good will to say:
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: Thanks. General. It's...swell.
text: TIGHT C.U. GUS -- his eyes flicker and blink in momentary panic as he realizes
text: SUPERMAN isn't dropping dead.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (quickly, losing his
dialog: cool, sounding less
dialog: Patton-like now)
dialog: Well...uh...I ain't got no time
dialog: to stick around for the corn-on-
dialog: the-cob and square dancing or
dialog: whatever it is you people do. We
dialog: got to get back to the base for...
dialog: uh...well, I can't tell you what
dialog: for, it's top secret.
text: Quickly he descends, VERA behind him, and looking a bit shook up, gets in the
text: car. VERA, just before she gets behind the wheel, turns to the CROWD.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: At ease! Siddown!
text: The car drives away. The CROWD clusters around SUPERMAN.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET IN SMALLVILLE - TWILIGHT
text: ON GUS -- walking disconsolately on a deserted street in Smallville, muttering
text: to himself, kicking at a tin can.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: "Unknown," how was I supposed
dialog: to know what 'unknown' is...
text: Ahead of him, on the corner is a pay phone. He enters it, sighs heavily with the
text: burden on his mind, drops in a bunch of coins and dials.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hello, Boss? ...You know how
dialog: people's always tryin' to copy
dialog: that secret recipe for that fried
dialog: chicken they sell in them buckets,
dialog: but nobody can figure out the
dialog: secret ingredient?
scene_heading: INT. ROSS WEBSTER'S OFFICE - TWILIGHT
text: C.U. ROSS -- on the phone as his desk. He is livid, furious.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: He didn't die???? I ask you to
dialog: kill Superman and you're telling
dialog: me you couldn't even do that one
dialog: simple thing??!!!
scene_heading: EXT. LANA'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT
text: The car parked in the drive, lights on in the house.
scene_heading: INT. LANA'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - TWILIGHT
text: SUPERMAN is relaxing after an early supper, sitting on the sofa and leafing
text: through a photo album. PAN TO SEE LANA as she tiptoes out of RICKY'S room.
speaker_heading: LANA
text: He was asleep before his head
dialog: hit the pillow.
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Well, this was only the biggest
dialog: day of his life. I really don't
dialog: know how to thank you.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: You just did, with that great
dialog: dinner.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (almost blushing)
dialog: Oh well, I do like to cook.
dialog: You'll take some coffee,
dialog: won't you?
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Decaffeinated, of course.
text: And she disappears into the kitchen.
text: Sound: A telephone rings in the kitchen. We hear LANA murmuring faintly,
dialog: occasionally, as:
text: ON SUPERMAN -- he sits up, frowning. He presses his eyes and shakes his head as
dialog: if to clear it, as if he suddenly had a headache or got dizzy. But these moves
text: don't seem to help much. He just sinks back into the sofa, looking as if he
dialog: really isn't feeling like himself.
text: LANA hurries back in, very upset.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (almost in on breath)
dialog: Superman, I'm sorry. I really hate
dialog: to cut this evening short, but... my
dialog: friend Betty just called! There's
dialog: been an accident on the old River
text: Bridge. A tank truck filled with acid
text: turned over! It's leaking acid and
dialog: they're afraid the bridge is collapsing!
dialog: (as if she were imposing)
dialog: I am sorry. I hate to make you rush off!
text: But SUPERMAN doesn't move. He just sits there, eyeing her very deliberately.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: There's no rush.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: But the bridge...
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: Hey, Don't I always get there in
dialog: time?
text: (as LANA nods uncertainly
text: he smiles and pats the sofa)
dialog: Come on, relax.
text: TIGHTER TWO SHOT -- as she sits down beside him, he casually moves closer and
text: smoothly slips an arm behind her, almost touching her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: It's hard to believe...
dialog: a great looking girl like
dialog: you all alone like this.
text: As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered,
dialog: then...finally...just realistic:
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Listen, are you sure you shouldn't
dialog: do something about the bridge?
speaker_heading: ON SUPERMAN
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: (vaguely)
dialog: The bridge...?
text: (suddenly, as if coming
dialog: out of a trance)
dialog: I'd better get going!
text: And he rushes out. HOLD ON LANA, looking after him, still troubled.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER BRIDGE, SMALLVILLE - TWILIGHT
text: Just as LANA said, a big tank truck has turned over on its side. DANGER--ACID is
text: painted on the tank, which has indeed sprung a considerable leak from a crack in
text: the side. Acid is trickling out with accompanying hissing steam and bubbling
text: corrosion effects. AN EMERGENCY CREW is doing its best, trying to spray water
text: from a hose to keep the acid from eating away the pilings. BUT:
text: CLOSER -- the acid drips onto the support system of the bridge and is eating the
text: old metal away right before our eyes.
text: LONGER -- the bridge starts to sway dangerously and the pilings begin to buckle.
text: POLICE CARS, FIRETRUCKS there. Ropes have been attached to the bridge structure,
text: and GUYS are holding fast on shore.
text: ON THE GUYS -- many of them hold wet cloths over their faces to protect them
text: from the terrible acid fumes. Smoke curls back in their faces as they valiantly
dialog: try to stem the inevitable.
speaker_heading: FIRST GUY
dialog: It won't hold! It's going!
speaker_heading: A SHERIFF
dialog: (into a bullhorn)
dialog: Clear the area! Clear the area!
text: Sound: A deep rumbling as the bridge starts to go.
speaker_heading: EMERGENCY CREW CHIEF
dialog: Get down!
text: ON THE BRIDGE -- it sways precipitously, then the pilings crack and crumble and
text: the bridge collapses, taking the tanker with it.
text: ON THE WATCHERS -- aghast at the destruction.
text: PAN UP TO THE SKY -- flying over the horizon, coming toward the area, is
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN.
text: NEW ANGLE -- he lands on the river bank. although we can't as yet quite be
text: certain, especially in this half-light, it seems that the colors of his costume
text: have darkened almost imperceptibly, the blue just a shade deeper, the red a bit
text: darker, His hair seems a little out of place, but then, that might be from the
dialog: wind...
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: (as he lands)
dialog: What...
dialog: (looks at where the
dialog: bridge used to be)
dialog: What can I do to help?
text: ON THE EMERGENCY CEW AND POLICE -- they look at him, disappointed and, frankly,
dialog: a bit surprised.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Not much of anything now.
speaker_heading: EMERGENCY CREW CHIEF
dialog: If only you'd got here a few
dialog: minutes ago.
text: ON SUPERMAN -- he looks away from their eyes. He seems troubled, puzzled. How
dialog: could this have happened?
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - PISA, ITALY - DAY
text: ON THE CORRUGATED AWNING OF A SOUVENIR STAND as two hands roll it up. As the
text: interior is revealed, we SEE the contents of the shelves: rows and rows of cheap
text: plastic souvenir Leaning Towers of Pisa, all leaning identically; rows and rows
text: of picture postcards with the same identical view. PULL BACK and WIDEN to
text: reveal an ITALIAN SHOPKEEPER admiring his stock as he gets ready for the day's
text: tourists. CONTINUE TO WIDEN: NOW WE SEE in the distant B.G. is the real Leaning
text: Tower of Pisa, tilted at the same familiar angle as all those plastic replicas.
text: As the MAN hums happily, ZOOM PAST HIM to the real tower, THEN CONTINUE TO ZOOM
text: PAST THE TOWER TO AN APPROACHING BLUE DOT IN THE SKY.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY ABOVE PISA - DAY
text: SUPERMAN is coming this way, and now there can be no mistaking it: his outfit is
text: changing color, becoming a little darker in its hues. And there's a slightly
text: different cast to his features, maybe a bit drawn, as if he'd had a hard night.
text: But he doesn't really look that different...except for a funny glint in his eye.
text: EFFECTS: A quick flash, almost subliminal (a few FRAMES at most) of the honest,
text: clean-cut face of CLARK KENT appears behind SUPERMAN'S altered features, then
dialog: disappears.
text: As he looks down, a slow, mischievous smile starts to form on his face.
text: HIS POV: The Leaning Tower of Pisa ahead.
text: ON SUPERMAN, FLYING -- he chuckles to himself as the idea comes to him. Then he
text: abruptly changes course and starts a rapid descent.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE, WIDE, FULL SHOT -- Approaching the top of the Leaning Tower, SUPERMAN
text: extends his arms and, bracing himself in midair, starts to push the Tower
text: upright. He continues, quietly chuckling as he does so.
scene_heading: EXT. SOUVENIR STAND, PISA - DAY
text: As in the OPENIG SHOT: the shelves of the stand RIGHT, the OWNER standing there
text: dusting them, the real Leaning Tower in B.G. But now, as he stops dusting to
dialog: make an automatic look at the source of his success, a remarkable thing is

speaker_heading: MONTAGE: NEWSPAPERS
text: The classic MONTAGE of spinning newspapers that comes to a stop so that we can

text: Then a JAPANESE one, showing the Leaning (straightened) Tower of Pisa. And so

text: Then, spinning out of limbo, the cover of TIME MAGAZINE. It shows a portrait of

text: ROSS and LORELEI are using the gym equipment in the office and are appropriately
text: attired; he in a sweat suit, she in mind-boggling spandex leotard. He's running
text: in place on a treadmill with a pedometer attached; she's leaning forward at a
text: sharp angle, pulling on ropes attached to counter-weights behind her that are
text: stacked on a Nautilus machine. VERA sits at the desk in her usual Ninotchka

speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: "At a special session of the

dialog: 
text: VERA "casually" extends her foot and kicks the toggle bolt that holds the

text: ropes, she pulls, falls forward flat on her face. ROSS turns to see what
text: happened. instantly, VERA begins counting:
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Time for you push-ups. 1 and
dialog: 2 and 3 and 4 and 1 and 2 and ...
text: LORELEI, smiling gamely, immediately starts doing push-ups.
speaker_heading: ROSS

text: TWO SHOT, FULL LENGTH -- without even thinking about it, GUS automatically
text: starts running in place beside him, as they talk, to "keep up with him" and be
dialog: polite.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Don't you see? Okay, so you
dialog: didn't kill him. Nobody's
dialog: perfect. But that stuff we ran
dialog: up in the lab wasn't a complete

dialog: (explaining)
dialog: Right after Gus gave it to him,

dialog: the opening ceremonies.
text: ON THE TOWER AT THE FAR END OF THE STADIUM, with the long pyramid of steps

dialog: often-seen ceremony.
text: IN LONG SHOT -- A RUNNER, the MAN picked to light the Olympic Flame, which will
text: burn throughout the Games and which signals the opening, runs up the long flight
text: of steps carrying in his had the Olympic Torch that has been passed from runner
dialog: to runner on it's journey toward this ultimate moment. As we WATCH this ceremony
text: reaching its stirring conclusion, we hear the voice of an announcer on T.V. or
dialog: radio:
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (v.o.)
dialog: And now, the supreme moment as the
dialog: last runner...the one given the great
dialog: honor of lighting the Olympic
text: Flame...runs the last leg of a marathon

text: As the RUNNER ascends to the top step and raises the torch high to light the
dialog: giant dish where the Flame will burn:
text: REVERSE: ZOOM TO SUPERMAN -- standing on the floodlight tower on the opposite
text: side of the stadium, on top of the wall. His costume is definitely darker now,
text: the blue becoming Prussian blue, the red deepening to a maroon. His hair is
text: uncombed, and his features look darker, tougher, as if he hadn't shaved for a
text: few days. With a look of pure malevolence, he:
text: EFFECTS: blows a gust of Super-Breath.
text: ON THE RUNNER -- the breath blows out the Olympic Flame.
text: Sound: a gasp from the CROWD.
text: And the RUNNER, terribly confused and upset, has to turn and run down the great

speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: (aloud, puzzled)
dialog: How can he say that pure

text: Suddenly, as she hears the door opening, she hides her book behind a Movie

speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: Hi, honey, am I in your way?
speaker_heading: ROSS

text: CAMERA ON A WALL-SIZED MAP OF THE WORLD, showing all the oceans of the world.

speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Every oil tanker and super-

speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: They ain't got captains?
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Yes, but they don't really

speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: You will command the tankers to

speaker_heading: GUS

speaker_heading: ROSS

speaker_heading: (to VERA)

speaker_heading: GUS
text: Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe

speaker_heading: ROSS

speaker_heading: ROSS

speaker_heading: GUS

speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't
dialog: want anything except to keep on
dialog: being a machine. You've got to
dialog: make sure it can figure out how
dialog: to beat any opponent.
speaker_heading: ON GUS
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Man, all it got to do is find
dialog: their weak spot.
dialog: (he starts drawing out
speaker_heading: a plan on ROSS'S
dialog: desk blotter)
dialog: You bet on the machine in any

dialog: your bet.

scene_heading: INT. CAVE - DAY
text: The WORKMEN in coveralls are assembling what is beginning to look like something
dialog: out of Fritz Lang's Metropolis: fantastic, incredible, and it hasn't even been

scene_heading: INT. SMALLVILLE BAR - AFTERNOON
text: A slightly drunk and very pushy BRAD is using the pay phone.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Doing what?
scene_heading: INT. LANA'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I'll think of something.
dialog: Look, I've got to go. Ricky
dialog: needs me.
text: (she hangs up and
text: leans over RICKY,
dialog: pointing to a math
dialog: problem on his page)
dialog: The first part of the problem
dialog: is okay, honey, but here I
dialog: think--
text: Sound: The phone rings again.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (picking up the
dialog: phone but still
speaker_heading: talking to RICKY)
dialog: -- you've got the wrong number.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: No, not you. I wish you'd get
dialog: the wrong number.
dialog: (almost pleading)
dialog: Brad, please stop calling me.
dialog: I've told you--
speaker_heading: (to RICKY)
dialog: --four times forty and then
dialog: divide five. Give it another.
scene_heading: INT. SMALLVILLE BAR - AFTERNOON
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: (getting really surly)
dialog: I'm getting a little tired of
dialog: trying, Lana. Why don't you
dialog: wise up? Now that Cluck Kent's
dialog: flown the coop, you'd better start
dialog: appreciating ole faithful Brad. What
dialog: else've you got in Smallville?
scene_heading: INT. LANA'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON
text: ON LANA - Disgusted, she hangs up, but then just stands there brooding on that
dialog: bleak truth.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: What else have I got in
dialog: Smallville?
text: She picks up the phone again, dials and waits.
scene_heading: INT. DAILY PLANET, CLARK KENT'S DESK - AFTERNOON

scene_heading: INT. LANA'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

dialog: Smallville Airport? What

dialog: Metropolis tomorrow?
scene_heading: EXT. STREET CORNER, METROPOLIS - DAY
text: ON A CROWD gathered on a street corner in Metropolis. They are bunched together,
text: muttering and distressed. looking at something across the street. We hear
text: comments along the line of "This I can't believe."
text: WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT IS: A neighborhood bar across the street. Inside is
text: SUPERMAN. Drinking. Drinking whiskey.
scene_heading: INT. BAR - DAY
text: He sits hunched over at the bar, glowering. His costume is now completely black:
text: his once manly, open face has become truly sinister. THE BARTENDER and the few
dialog: CUSTOMERS give him a wide berth. This is not a guy you want to mess with.
text: We get a look at TWO OF THE DENZIENS of the bar: a pair of really mean, ornery
text: customers. One has an eye-patch and a scar, the other a shaved head and a
text: mustache. And even these two keep their distance from SUPERMAN.
text: He upends a bowl of peanuts on the bar. Then, with malicious pleasure, he begins
text: flipping them, one at a time, at the rows of glasses stacked up on the shelf
text: behind the bar. Ping: Crash! Ping! Crash! In the style of a Cagney punk spraying
text: the4 bar with machine-gun bullets, he just wrecks the joint, since the peanuts,
text: flipped with Super-Strength, have the projectile force of bullets. Then, bored
text: with the target practice, he shoots a beam of Heat-Vision at the mirror itself.
text: EFFECTS: the glass melts.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET CORNER, METROPOLIS - DAY
text: NEW ANGLE: LOOKING DWON AT THE STREET - A taxi comes down the street, but can't
text: move past the intersection because of the gathering crowd.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI - DAY
text: DRIVER in front seat; LANA and RICKY in back.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: I can't get though, lady.
dialog: Something's going on here.
text: ON RICKY -- curious.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: I wanna see what's happening.
text: Before LANA can stop him, he opens his door and goes out to join the CROWD. LANA
text: has no choice but to follow him.
text: ON TH EPART OF THE CROWD where RICKY and LANA stand.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: It's a disgrace, that's what it is.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I'll tell you one thing, boy,
dialog: nobody'll ever trust that creep
text: again. He's washed up.
text: ON RICKY -- stunned as he SEES what they see.
text: POV: The door to the bar swings open and the surly, ornery, snarling SUPERMAN
text: comes out into the street.
text: ON THE CROWD -- instinctively pulling back.
text: NEW ANGLE -- a nearby building is notable for its peculiar façade: a series of
text: porthole-like windows rising in vertical columns. SUPERMAN looks at it, then
text: very deliberately stomps his foot hard on the ground.
text: ON THE BUILDING -- the first five floors of portholes light up, like a column
text: light ascending. The image recalls one of those carnival Test-Your-Strength
text: machines. And so is for SUPERMAN, who now stomps much harder. And this time the
text: column of lights shoots all the way up to the top floor of the building.
text: SUPERMAN smiles sneeringly, proud of his prowess.
text: C.U. RICKY -- tears in his eyes. PULL BACK AND WIDEN as he pushes his way to the
text: front of the crowd.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Superman!
text: LANA struggles through, trying to get to him.
text: ON SUPERMAN -- his eyes flick toward the sound of his name.
speaker_heading: ON RICKY
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Superman, it's me, Ricky!
dialog: Ricky from Smallville!
text: A MAN next to RICKY tries to pull him back to safety.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Be careful, kid!
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: (wrought-up,
dialog: voice breaking)
dialog: Superman, tell them you won't
dialog: hurt anybody!
text: ON SUPERMAN -- starting to walk away, but something in RICKY'S plea halts him
text: momentarily. He turns, looks at the BOY. For a second, there seems to be a
text: flicker of understanding in his eyes. Then he scowls and continues to lope off
text: down the street.
text: ON THE CROWD -- LANA manages to get to RICKY'S side. She is protective, fearful.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (this is very hard
dialog: for her to say)
dialog: Ricky, he's changed.
text: C.U. RICKY -- tears in his eyes, defiantly refusing to let his idol be
dialog: castigated.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: No!
dialog: (desperately thinking
dialog: of excuses)
dialog: Maybe...maybe he's just sick!
dialog: Sometimes when I'm sick I get
dialog: real cranky and mean, Mom, you
dialog: even told me that.
text: ON SUPERMAN in F.G. as he walks away; the CROWD in B.G.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Superman, please get better!
text: Again, that odd hesitation in SUPERMAN'S basically snarling attitude. Then,
text: wolf-like, he keeps going.
text: ON LANA and RICKY.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (her heart is breaking
dialog: for her son's lost
dialog: illusions)
dialog: He's not listening to you, Ricky.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Yes he is! He can hear me! He's
dialog: got Super-Hearing.
text: C.U. SUPERMAN -- now at least two blocks away. RICKY'S voice rings across the
dialog: empty space:
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: You can hear me, can't you,
dialog: Superman? I know you're
dialog: going to be all right! You're
dialog: just in a slump! You'll be great
dialog: again. You can do it, Superman!
text: Trying to shake it off, the evil SUPERMAN suddenly lurches into the sky and
text: flies off. ANGLE UP TO SEE HIM GO.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - TWILIGHT
text: ON THE EVIL SUPERMAN as he flies.
text: Soundtrack: Echoing in SUPERMAN'S mind, the voice of RICKY is heard, pleading
dialog: again and again.
speaker_heading: RICKY'S VOICE
dialog: (Electronically enhanced
dialog: to a sound overpowering)
dialog: You're 	just in a slump! You'll be
dialog: great again. Great again! Please
dialog: get better! Please get better!
dialog: Superman! Get better!
text: The voice torments SUPERMAN. He winces, as if beset by stabbing migraine
text: headaches, as the voice grows louder and denser, one sentence (electronically)
text: overlapping the next so that it begins to sound like a whole chorus of Rickies.
text: It becomes sheer torture, as if his dormant conscience was punishing him. He
text: can't fight off the pain. Finally, he drops from the sky to:
scene_heading: EXT. AUTOMOBILE GRAVEYARD - TWILIGHT
text: At first we cannot tell where we are. The EVIL SUPERMAN, black garbed, lands on
text: his knees in a landscape that looks like the end of the world: dark piles of
text: twisted metal, debris, small fires burning here and there. It could be hell. But
text: it is, in fact, an automobile graveyard.
text: ON HIM CLOSE -- as he struggles to his feet, the stabbing pains in his head
text: tormenting him, the distorted and all-pervading sound of RICKY'S pleas continue
text: to ring out in his brain. As this reaches a crescendo, an extraordinary thing
dialog: begins to happen:
text: EFFECTS: emerging from the body of the EVIL SUPERMAN comes the form of CLARK
text: KENT. The CLARK persona wrests itself apart from the EVIL SUPERMAN until there
text: are now two separate identities made manifest ON THE SCREEN -- the good part of
text: him and the bad part have split. It is the ultimate expression of the schizoid
text: aspects of this dual SUPERMAN/CLARK character, now locked in mortal combat.
text: EVIL SUPERMAN gets to his feet, looks with undisguised venom at CLARK. WIDE
text: ANGLE LETS US NOW SEE where we are: the heaps of twisted metal are car body
text: parts, stacked up in mounds, row upon row of mashed and flattened auto wrecks.
text: Elsewhere we WILL SEE piles of old tires, piles of bumpers and fenders. And in
text: addition, the tools and machines of this trade: great cranes with giant magnets
text: that lift the cars on high, vats of acid that strip them, hydraulic pressing
text: machines that squash and flatten them into metal pancakes, formidable-looking
text: metal shredders that rip steel apart into strips.
text: The workers who operate the various machines WILL BE SEEN at odd moments during
text: the following, reacting with fear and then running for safety.
text: Not all of theses can be SEEN as yet, however, as the surly, gaunt SUPERMAN
text: looks balefully at the forthright, fists-clenched figure of CLARK KENT.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Give up. Give in.
speaker_heading: (EVIL) SUPERMAN
dialog: Like hell I will.
text: And with that, he hauls off and socks CLARK in the jaw with such tremendous
text: force that it sends him hurtling backwards into a pile of axles. They clatter
text: and crash to the ground with an enormous clanging of noise.
text: ON SUPERMAN -- rubbing his knuckles, That hurt, and we realize that CLARK KENT
text: is just as strong as SUPERMAN.
text: ON CRANE OPERATOR -- startled reaction. Quick departure.
text: ON THE PILES OF AXLES -- CLARK nowhere to be seen. Then, from an unseen vantage
text: point, his voice booms out:
speaker_heading: CLARK (o.s.)
dialog: I can give as good as I get.
dialog: Are you willing to risk it?
text: ON SUPERMAN, whirling around, trying to locate him.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: (defiantly)
dialog: Try me!
text: From out of the pile of rubble, CLARK comes charging directly at SUPERMAN, head
text: down like a bull. He butts him full force in the gut, sending SUPERMAN tumbling
text: backwards. ANOTHER WORKER runs off.
text: NEW ANGLE -- behind the falling SUPERMAN is a great vat marked:
speaker_heading: DANGER ---ACID
text: with a skull and crossbones stenciled on it.
text: Unable to halt this backward momentum, SUPERMAN falls into the vat of acid.
text: ANGLE IN -- he disappears in the smoking, steaming bubbles, submerged in the
dialog: acid bath. An ordinary mortal would be all bones in seconds, but -- suddenly the
text: EVIL SUPERMAN comes flying out of the vat.
text: ON HIM AS HE LANDS NEARBY -- a terrifying sight: smoke is issuing from all parts
text: of him, curling off his body. He looks positively demonic. In a flurry, he turns
text: on CLARK, and hands cupped with acid, he:
text: EFFECTS: blows a stream of burning acid directly at him.
text: ON CLARK -- the acid ignites his clothing as it lands on him.
text: EFFECTS: his jacket burns off, leaving him in shirtsleeves.
text: ON SUPERMAN -- sneering.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: Man, I never did like you.
dialog: You always got on my nerves.
text: He grabs a bumper and swings it like a baseball bat, hitting CLARK in side,
text: knocking him down.
text: ON CLARK -- hurt, shaken, but managing to get to his feet.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Come to think of it, you
dialog: always got under my skin.
text: And with that, he leaps on the EVIL SUPERMAN, knocking him to the ground.
text: CLOSER ON THEM as they roll and grapple across the debris-strewn earth. Behind
text: them, looms a pit, which neither can see as yet.
text: IN THE PIT -- we SEE the flattened shapes of what once were auto wrecks, smashed
text: into rectangular metal pancakes by hydraulic press, which looms above the pit.
text: ON THE TWO OF THEM WRESTLING -- with a mighty heave, SUPERMAN sends CLARK
text: crashing into the open pit.
text: ON CLARK -- he lands on top of the flattened cars and lays there, stunned.
text: ON SUPERMAN -- he quickly activates the hydraulic control.
text: NEW ANGLE -- the great iron press begins to descend on the still unmoving form
text: of CLARK KENT.
text: CLOSER -- it comes down and begins to squash CLARK flat. It presses harder and
text: harder. We hear SUPERMAN'S terrible, evil laughter.
text: ON SUPERMAN -- convinced that he has vanquished his foe, he starts to walk away.
text: ON CLARK, IN THE PIT -- with superhuman strength, he grips the edges of the
text: hydraulic press and slowly, slowly, pushes it up and off his body. A difficult
text: feat even for him. Quickly now, he slithers out from under it.
text: ON CLARK -- scrambling out of the pit, racing toward a stack of tires.
text: ON SUPERMAN -- about fifty feet away, striding off, thinking he's won.
dialog: Suddenly...
text: EFFECTS: tires come flying through the air and ring SUPERMAN like horseshoes
text: landing on a stake. He's startled, to say the least, as first one tire spins
text: around like a big hula hoop, then a second, then a third. For a moment he is
text: immobilized.
text: ON CLARK -- coming at him.
text: ON SUPERMAN -- he bursts his rubber bonds like a Hercules bursting his chains,
dialog: by expanding his arms.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: (snarling)
dialog: Man, you're finished!
text: He looks up.
text: POV: ABOVE CLARK IS A CRANE and hanging from it, directly above his head, is one
text: of those enormous flat-bottomed magnets they use to lift up the automobile
text: wrecks and move them.
text: EFFECTS: the EVIL SUPERMAN sends rays of red-hot Heat-Vision shooting from his
text: eyes, aimed at the links of chain, which hold the magnet. The chain glows,
text: melts, and then the magnet drops with full force on CLARK -- smashing him right
text: through the ground.
text: NEW ANGLE -- all is still for a moment. Then, shooting up from underground in
text: another area, comes CLARK KENT. He lifts a battered car fender from the ground,
text: raises it high above his head and hurls it at SUPERMAN.
text: The object hits him head-on and sends him crashing backwards. Flying through the
text: air, smashing into an enormous mountain of piled-up body parts. The last WORKMAN
dialog: runs for his life.
text: ON CLARK -- stepping into a clearing.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Come on out and fight like
dialog: a man!
text: Suddenly, a hail of wheel rims comes flying at him, hurled with tremendous
text: force, like deadly Frisbees.
text: ON SUPERMAN -- some distance away, flinging the wheel rims.
text: ON CLARK, CLOSE one wheel rim sizzles through the air and strikes him in the
text: side of the head, hitting his temple with such impact that it knocks him to the
text: ground unconscious.
text: WIDE ANGLE -- SUPERMAN, triumphant, strides over to the fallen body of CLARK,
text: lifts him in his arms. FOLLOW HIM as he takes the unconscious CLARK to:
text: THE METAL SHREDDER -- the frightening machine has teeth like a crocodile and its
text: steel rollers and innards seem menacing even when still. An old wreck is on the
text: conveyer belt, ready in place to be fed into the shredder.
text: SUPERMAN drops CLARK to the ground and flips on the switch.
text: ON THE MACHINE -- we SEE it work now. The conveyer belt starts up, and the car
text: is fed into the jaws of the machine.
text: Sound: A terrible, ear-piercing screeching and grinding of metal as the car is
text: chewed by the shredder.
text: We SEE what happens: smoke rises, and pieces of shrapnel go flying and from out
text: the extruding end, what was moments before recognizable as a battered auto,
text: comes out as long, jagged strips of metal.
text: NEW ANGLE -- contemptuously, SUPERMAN kicks the unconscious CLARK KENT onto the
dialog: conveyer belt.
text: CLOSER -- as CLARK'S body moves along the conveyer belt and is fed into the
text: teeth and jaws of the metal shredder.
text: EFFECTS: it begins its terrible work. But -- suddenly, the teeth start to snap
text: off and fly in all directions. The metal casing snaps and cracks. Sparks,
text: terrific sparks everywhere. Smoke rising as if the motor were burning itself
text: out. The machine, with an awful noise, self-destructs.
text: And CLARK KENT emerges with fury in his eyes.
text: Without a word, he leaps onto SUPERMAN, pinning him to the ground, his hands
text: around his neck. For a moment, SUPERMAN seems to be fighting him off, almost
text: rolling him over, but then CLARK gets a better grip on him.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (intense, as he
dialog: chokes him)
dialog: Give up! Give up! Give up!
text: The EVIL SUPERMAN clutches at CLARK'S hands, trying to pull loose. And then...
text: EFFECTS: An amazing sight. Slowly, the figure of EVIL SUPERMAN begins to grow
text: less 'real,' fading in density, beginning to become opaque, then translucent.
text: Then the amorphous figure begins to be drawn and absorbed into the CLARK KENT
text: figure until at last there is no EVIL SUPERMAN beneath CLARK'S hands, but a
text: strong, victorious CLARK who now stands up. NOW he walks TOWARD CAMERA as he
text: opens his shirt buttons. We SEE the true "S" underneath, in noble red and gold.
speaker_heading: IT FILLS FRAME.
text: ANGLE UP -- once again strong and handsome and good, SUPERMAN flies off.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - DAY
text: AERIAL SHOT, WIDE ANGLE -- the enormous oil spill, stretching almost a mile
text: long, floats on the sea, heading for the East Coast.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
text: The long lines of cars are longer than ever. ON THE FRONT OF THE LINE the
text: STATION ATTENDANT puts up a new sign: OUT OF GAS. STATION CLOSED.
scene_heading: EXT. OIL FIELDS - DAY
text: The deserted oil fields: the pumps still.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - DAY
dialog: Music: The stirring theme.
text: SUPERMAN flies to the rescue, soaring above the Atlantic Ocean. Now he looks
text: down, sees the oil spill.
text: EFFECTS: IN VARIOUS HOTS, SUPERMAN descends to where he hovers above the waves.
text: Before him the enormous lake of oil undulate in the choppy sea. He takes a deep
text: breath and begins to blow Super-Breath.
text: FURTHER AWAY -- the super-tanker with the gaping hole in the side.
text: ON THE DECK -- A SEAMAN looks up astonished.
speaker_heading: SEAMAN
dialog: My God! Look!
text: His MATES look where he points.
text: POV: LONG SHOT -- the oil slick is heading back toward the ship, sipping through
text: the ocean rapidly. Behind it, in far B.G. SUPERMAN is continuing to blow a
text: steady gust of Super-Breath.
text: EFFECTS: ON THE TANKER HULL -- as the oil is forced, against the current, to
text: flow right back into the hull from which it escaped.
text: NEW ANGLE -- the last of the oil spill is blown back in. Immediately:
text: EFFECTS: ON SUPERMAN -- sending powerful beams of Heat-Vision from his eyes, he
text: aims them at the gaping metal hull.
text: ON THE HULL -- the Heat-Vision welds the hole together, repairing the ship. We
text: hear cheers of the CREW off-screen.
scene_heading: INT. CAPTAIN'S BRIDGE - DAY
text: The CAPTAIN watches, amazed, as the now-recovered MAN OF STEEL lands just
text: outside his bridge.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: Captain, I'd like to apologize
dialog: for what I did before. I... I
dialog: really wasn't myself.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: That's all right, lad. All's well
dialog: that ends well, as they say.
text: C.U. SUPERMAN -- jaw set, eyes narrow.
text: And with that, he takes off.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - DAY
text: WIDE ANGLE SHOWS SUPERMAN flying above the ocean, heading inland.
text: CLOSER ON HIM -- suddenly, he spots something down below. A look of great
text: concern on his face.
text: FULL SHOT -- he banks and starts straight down toward the sea.
text: ON THE SEA -- On a little island (just a tiny outcropping) stands a SEABIRD, its
text: feathers coated with oil, unable to fly. SUPERMAN swoops down.
text: ON THE LITTLE ISLAND -- SUPERMAN lands there and lifts the bird in his hand.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Here you go, little fella.
text: He softly blows the oil off the bird's feathers.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: C'mon, you take the head start.
text: He tosses the bird up into the air.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - DAY
text: The bird flies. SUPERMAN catches up and flies alongside for a while. Then he
text: veers off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
text: (tipping his hand
dialog: in a little wave)
dialog: See you around the sky, pal.
dialog: Keep 'em flying.
text: He continues on his way.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY ABOVE METROPOLIS - DAY
text: FULL SHOT: WIDE -- SUPERMAN flies over the skyscrapers of Metropolis.
scene_heading: EXT. WEBSTER PENTHOUSE, TERRACE - DAY
text: SUPERMAN lands on the terrace of the Webster penthouse. He opens the door and
dialog: enters.
scene_heading: INT. WEBSTER PENTHOUSE - DAY
text: INSERT: Just inside the doorway, right past the threshold is a little slab of
text: plastic with a button sticking up. SUPERMAN unknowingly steps on the button.
text: EFFECTS: the button activates:
text: 1. A big banner, which suddenly drops and
text: unfurls from the ceiling, festooned with
text: red, white, and blue bunting. Lettered
text: on the banner are the words:
speaker_heading: "HI SUPERMAN"
text: As the banner drops:
text: Music: Patriotic march theme plays.
text: Startled, SUPERMAN sees the greeting. A second later, he whirls around as:
text: 2. The voice of ROSS WEBSTER booms out from
text: a loud-speaker in the manner of a telephone
dialog: answering machine:
speaker_heading: VOICE OF ROSS
dialog: Miss Lorelei Ambrosia isn't at home
dialog: right now. If you'd care to leave a
dialog: message, don't wait for the beep.
dialog: Why not deliver it to her in person?
text: Suddenly, with a click, a video tape starts to appear on a T.V. screen. it
text: shows VERA, very formally seated at a desk, in one of her dark suits, addressing
text: the viewer in her no-nonsense way.
text: 3. The T.V. screen lights up, VERA appears.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: (on T.V.)
dialog: Here is where you can find her,
dialog: as well as the rest of us.
text: A panoramic view of the Grand Canyon appears on the T.V. screen. As voice of
text: VERA continues over, as a secue.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT GRAND CANYON - DAY
text: ESTABLISHING SHOT: the same view, now real, of one of nature's seven wonders. As
text: we hear VERA'S voice-over.
speaker_heading: VERA (v.o)
dialog: Do drop in.
text: AERIAL SHOT: ZOOM DOWN TO a startling sight. Atop one of the rocky cliffs in the
text: middle of the giant gorge are FIVE TINY FIGURES. 2 MEN: 2 WOMEN, and a DONKEY.
text: NEW ANGLE -- Behind them, above the canyon, we SEE pylons and power lines; a
dialog: major electrical power source is here.
text: GROUP SHOT: GUS is holding the donkey on a lead. ROSS, VERA, and LORELEI are
text: adjusting curious devices attached by back-pack harnesses to their persons:
text: individual hot-air balloons. ROSS and VERA have already blown theirs up and are
text: adjusting the ballast. LORELEI is inflating hers, which, in contrast to the
text: others' utilitarian gray, is a shocking pink balloon that matches her jump suit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: This is fun!
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Fun? The fun's just starting, hon.
dialog: Wait till Superman finds us, then
dialog: you'll see fun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (confused)
dialog: You want to mess with Superman?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: Let's go. I want to be ready for
dialog: him when he falls into our trap.
dialog: (to GUS, irritably)
dialog: I don't see why you can't balloon
dialog: down like the rest of us.
text: ON GUS -- he looks at the gizmos, then looks over the ledge.
text: HIS POV: a sheer drop to the bottom of the canyon.
text: ON GUS -- shaking his head emphatically.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Uh-huh. No way, man. Not me.
dialog: (he climbs on
dialog: his donkey)
dialog: I just don't believe a man can
dialog: fly.
text: The DONKEY starts walking down the winding	 path that will eventually take
text: him down to the bottom of the canyon.
text: ROSS, VERA, and LORELEI activate their little hot-air gadgets and launch
text: themselves off the edge of the cliff.
text: FULL SHOT, LONG: like invading paratroopers, the THREE of them waft down into
text: the canyon, as GUS, SEEN TO FAR LEFT OF FRAME, rides his agile donkey down a
dialog: footpath.
scene_heading: EXT. BASE OF GRAND CANYON
text: The Three land on the floor of the canyon and extricate themselves from the
text: balloon rigs.
text: ANGLE UP -- GUS and his DONKEY are getting there, albeit a bit slower.
text: WIDE SHOT: the three of them walk towards the mouth of a large cave.
scene_heading: INT. CAVE
text: In sudden contrast to the bright sunlight outside, it is very dark in here.
speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: I can't see anything.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Turn on the light.
speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: Where's the light switch?
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Where do you usually find a
dialog: light switch?
text: ON LRELEI -- she feels along the cave wall right by the entrance, and, sure
text: enough, finds a light switch. She flicks it on.
text: REVERSE, WIDE ANGLE: the ultimate computer: four stories high with ladders
text: leading up to different ledges and perches and cat-walks and walk-in alcoves set
text: in the impressive, amazing façade. it looks like a leger vision of industrial
text: technology giantism combined with futuristic hardware right out of science-
dialog: fiction.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LORELEI (o.s.)
dialog: Wow, what a jukebox.
text: REVERSE --they look at it in awe.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: I told you, didn't I? The
dialog: Ultimate Computer! It does
dialog: everything any computer can
dialog: do and a thousand things that
dialog: none of them do!
text: VERA starts toward the machine, officiously gesturing to the others:
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Come on, let's give it a
dialog: dry run.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: (snidely)
dialog: Who needs Gus?
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: He's the only one who can
dialog: operate this --
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Like fish he is.
dialog: (sneering pride)
dialog: I know enough about computers
dialog: to put a PHD to shame.
dialog: (as they react
dialog: in surprise)
dialog: Come now, brother dear, you
dialog: didn't think I was going to let
dialog: that little man run the show,
dialog: did you? Gus Gorman telling
dialog: us what to do -- I'd sooner
dialog: kiss a pig!
text: FAVORING VERA -- she crosses a wedge-shaped grid that extends out and over a
text: moat-like area of circuitry beneath alternating wedges of clear glass and dense
text: grid. She reaches the base of a ladder that runs up the center of the computer
text: and starts to climb.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Come on, will you?
dialog: (as the others
dialog: follow her up)
dialog: We've got to get ready before
dialog: he gets here.
speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: Gus?
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Superman. The boy you left
dialog: behind.
text: ON VERA -- she peers down as she climbs up. looking into the central generator
dialog: section below.
text: POV: Laying on the ground by the generator is an old cardboard coffee cup, a
text: half-filled bottle of flat root-beer soda, a half-eaten Hostess Twinkie package,
text: a screw-driver and some tools.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: (with a moue
dialog: of distaste)
dialog: Honestly, you'd think these
dialog: workmen would learn to tidy
text: up when they finish.
text: WIDE SHOT- The ascend to the central console on a deck midway up the front of
text: the machine. There is a terrace filled with controls; it looks like the board of
text: an elaborate light show up there.
text: NEW ANGLE-- In the Central Control where VERA stands, it looks like something at
text: NASA: hundreds of buttons, lighted dials, video display screens, gauges, God-
text: knows-what. She sits in a chair located in the center that swivels to provide
text: access to all the main controls.
text: ON VERA -- she throws some switches, pushes some buttons.
text: Sound: a low humming begins.
speaker_heading: VERA
speaker_heading: (to ROSS)
dialog: Bubba, engage those levers on
dialog: your right to activate the Alpha
dialog: Circuits and lock the modular
dialog: grid.
text: ROSS eventually starts to follow her orders.
text: WIDE SHOT: Suddenly, the left side of the four-story structure lights up in many
text: wonderful ways: blinking lights, crackling electrodes, digital dials, and other
dialog: illuminations.
speaker_heading: VERA
speaker_heading: (to LORELEI)
dialog: You! Activate circuits 29
dialog: through W7 and start Full
dialog: Power Coordinates on
dialog: Exterior Defensive Systems:
speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: (not cowed by
speaker_heading: VERA'S jargon)
dialog: In other words, push this
dialog: red button.
dialog: She does so.
text: WIDE FULL SHOT: with a loud "clung!" the right side of the Ultimate Computer
text: lights up in equally impressive ways. The thing is starting to look like the
text: spaceship in Close Encounters.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY ABOVE GRAND CANYON - DAY
text: SUPERMAN is coming from the sky, scanning the area below, searching for them. He
text: approaches the gorge.
text: NEW ANGLE, UP -- SUPERMAN flies into the grand Canyon.
text: A red light starts to flash.
text: Sound: a piercing electronic alarm goes off.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: He's here!
speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: (delighted)
dialog: Oh, Superman!
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's
dialog: after our skin!
speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: He can have mine. Anytime.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (impatient, like a
dialog: greedy child)
dialog: C'mon, sis, let the games begin!
scene_heading: EXT. CANYON - DAY
text: SUPERMAN flies into the canyon, hovers a moment, then starts to zoom toward the
dialog: cave area.
scene_heading: INT. CAVE, ULTIMATE COMPUTER
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: All right, Bubba, enjoy yourself.
text: She guides her brother to a covered panel, flips it open. This reveals a large
text: video screen and some controls. There is something familiar about this
dialog: particular rig...
text: VERA goes back to the center console and pushes buttons and controls marked
scene_heading: "EXTERIOR DEFENSE."
text: ON THE CONTROLS -- A panel board lights up: "MISSILE READY."
scene_heading: EXT. CANYON FLOOR - DAY
text: From underneath the canyon floor, sliding panels buried underneath the sandy
text: terrain slide back, revealing small rockets on launching pads beneath.
text: NEW ANGLE -- from inside the missile it, we SEE the missile launcher slowly
dialog: rising.
scene_heading: INT. CAVE, ULTIMATE COMPUTER
text: ON ROSS AT VIDEO SCREEN: he switches it on. The screen lights up. Ranged along
text: the bottom are little computerized images of the rockets; coming down from the
text: top of the screen is a little stick figure of a MAN with a cape. We suddenly
dialog: realize what's familiar about this: it is the ultimate version an Atari "Space
text: Invaders" video game. Except this time. it's being played for real.
scene_heading: EXT. CANYON FLOOR - DAY
text: The missile launchers, controlled by ROSS from within, rises out of the ground
text: and spin around, searching for their target.
text: ON SUPERMAN -- flying down the canyon toward the missiles.
scene_heading: INT. CAVE, ULTIMATE COMPUTER
text: ROSS works the controls and fires rockets. On the video, just like in an
text: electronic game arcade, we SEE the rockets heading up, aimed at the flying man.
dialog: And:
speaker_heading: FAST CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CANYON - DAY
text: Where the real life version is taking place, controlled by ROSS. Rockets fire up
text: from the floor of the canyon, heading for SUPERMAN.
text: NEW ANGLE -- SUPERMAN has to dive and dart away.
speaker_heading: FAST CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CAVE, ULTIMATE COMPUTER
text: ROSS, totally manic, is having himself a wonderful time, playing his lethal
text: Atari like an arcade champ. Grunts, groans, body english, etc.
scene_heading: EXT. CANYON - DAY
text: GUS, coming down the trail, looks at the spectacle taking place, fearful:
speaker_heading: GUS
text: The rockets' red glare,
dialog: the bombs burstin' in
dialog: air -- what in hell is
dialog: goin' on?
scene_heading: CROSS CUT BETWEEN:
text: 1. ATARI SCREEN: Showing a barrage of
text: missiles aimed at the flying figure.
scene_heading: 2. EXT. CANYON: SUPERMAN beset by
text: the missiles. He knocks some out of the
dialog: way, dodges others.
text: 3. ROSS working the controls.
scene_heading: EXT. CANYON - DAY
text: SUPERMAN is hit by the final salvo of missiles and is THROWN OUT OF FRAME,
text: tumbling over and over.
text: NEW ANGLE -- he is headed for a column of rock. he crashes into it.
scene_heading: INT. CAVE, ULTIMATE COMPUTER
text: ON THE VIDEO SCREEN -- The Atari-type game screen shows it all, including the
text: "hit" and a High Score of 13,000 lights up.
text: ON ROSS -- gleeful, crazed:
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: A hit! Got him! This will
dialog: give him something to
dialog: think about!
text: C.U. VERA -- smiling fondly at her little brother enjoying himself.
scene_heading: INT. CAVE - DAY
text: GUS has reached the entrance, He gets off his DONKEY and enters. looking
text: fearfully around him.
text: C.U. GUS - a bit awed as he sees what he has wrought.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (a moment of
dialog: quiet pride)
dialog: Awright. I got me my
dialog: electric train, mama. I
dialog: finally got --
dialog: (suddenly upset
dialog: at what he sees)
dialog: Hey, what y'all doin' up
dialog: there?!
speaker_heading: REVERSE:
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Join the party, genius!
dialog: Come on up!
scene_heading: EXT. CANYON - DAY
text: SUPERMAN, a bit dazed but basically unhurt, pulls himself up off the ruble of
text: the stone column and flies downward.
scene_heading: INT. CAVE, ULTIMATE COMPUTER
text: GUS is coming up to the terrace where the central console is located.
text: REVERSE: WIDE -- SUPERMAN has landed and enters the cave. He stands framed in
dialog: the doorway.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: (in stentorian tones)
dialog: All right, Webster. Pack it in.
text: ON LORELEI -- waving from her perch.
speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: Hi, honey.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: I don't know you, lady.
speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: But the other night...
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: That wasn't me. That guy's gone.
speaker_heading: (to ROSS)
dialog: And you're next Webster.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: Don't you threaten my Bubba!
text: INSERT: She presses a button.
text: WIDE (SPECIAL EFFECTS): A tremendous ZAP of electrical energy, all blue and
text: white, shoots out of the computer and zaps SUPERMAN with such a jolt that it
text: knocks him to the ground.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Welcome to the wonderful
dialog: world of computers, Superman.
text: ON SUPERMAN -- shakes his head, gets to his feet.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Well, Superman? How do you
dialog: like Supermachine?
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: Typical of your kind, Webster.
dialog: Instead of using it to help others,
dialog: all the four of you want is to
dialog: help yourselves.
dialog: ON GUS -- who doesn't like the designation.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Four of us? What's he mean
dialog: four of us?
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Hey, man!
speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: (to GUS)
dialog: That's only his last name. He
dialog: likes to be called Super-man.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hey, I ain't with them!
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: You could've fooled me,
dialog: mister.
text: With that he starts to move menacingly toward the machine.
text: ON VERA -- she pushes another control button.
text: WIDE ANGLE -- suddenly, SUPERMAN walks into an invisible shield. There's nothing
dialog: there we can SEE, but...
text: Sound: it makes a big thunk as he bangs into it.
text: C.U. SUPERMAN -- his features flattened by an invisible wall exactly as they
dialog: would if he smashed into plate-glass.
text: NEW ANGLE -- he runs back a few steps, puts his head down and charges like a
text: bull at the invisible force-field.
text: EFFECTS: A split-second after SUPERMAN hits the invisible shield, its substance
text: wraps around him and encases him in a transparent bubble. Weird colored gasses
text: churn inside the bubble; the impression is one of being trapped inside a hot,
text: volatile enclosure with no air.
text: The bubble rises in the air and spins crazily around the vast interior. Inside,
text: SUPERMAN tries to fight his way out: punching, pushing, kicking.
text: CLOSER ON HIM -- He's sweating in there, making a tremendous effort. Then,
text: unable to break it with brute force, he narrows his eyes, then opens them wide
dialog: and:
text: EFFECTS: Beams of Heat-Vision blaze from his eyes. Such is their power that they
text: break the molecular structure of the prison and it crashes open. SUPERMAN breaks
dialog: loose.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (hysterical)
dialog: He's coming! He's going to
dialog: hurt me!
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Don't bet on it!
text: NEW ANGLE -- she slams a button (one larger and separate from the others) with
dialog: full force.
text: EFFECTS: From the center of the machine, a large ball-like shape suddenly
text: emanates a bright green ray we recognize immediately as being the color of
text: Kryptonite. It hits SUPERMAN full force, a spot-light of death.
text: HE cries out in pain and drops to the ground, writhing in agony, dying before
dialog: our eyes.
text: C.U. GUS -- frightened, horrified:
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: No! You'll kill him! That's
dialog: Kryptonite!
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: (insane, wild)
dialog: Yes! This time we got it right!
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (triumphant, raving)
dialog: It's your genius, pal! You
dialog: built a machine that can
dialog: find anybody's weak spot,
dialog: just like you said.
text: C.U. GUS -- sick with the realization of what he's done.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Congratulations, chum! you're
dialog: going to go down in history
dialog: as the man who killed Superman!
text: ON GUS -- He can't take it anymore. As SUPERMAN writhes in pain, GUS makes a
text: quick decision. Running behind VERA, he looks down through the transparent floor
dialog: at what is beneath:
scene_heading: POV: ZOOM INTO GENEORATOR
text: ON GUS -- he whips his yo-yo out of his pocket, pulls the string all the way
text: out, throws it over one of the guy wires that anchor the machine to the floor.
text: He jumps off the terrace, holding onto both ends (yo-yo and string) and slides
text: down to the ground, a la Topkapi.
text: NEW ANGLE -- GUS charges into the generator area and grabs the wire connecting
text: the computer to its energy source: the generator.
text: CLOSER -- one little screw coupling connects them. GUS grabs the screw-driver
dialog: nearby and:
text: INSERT: simply unscrews one little screw.
text: ON THE MACHINE, WIDE ANGLE -- suddenly all the energy and power and electronic
dialog: jazz just...stop. It just shuts off.
text: ON SUPERMAN -- the green Kryptonite ray shits off as well. he is saved from
text: death, but weakened, on his knees.
text: ON THE TERRACE CONSOLE -- ROSS, enraged, looks down and sees what GUS has done.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: No! Give me that! Give
dialog: it to me!
text: He charges down the interior staircase, after GUS.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Give it to me----
text: ON GUS -- he holds the little screw in his hand. As ROSS lunges for it, GUS pops
text: it into his own mouth and tries to swallow it. But it gets caught in his own
text: throat. He tries harder, his eyes straining with the effort, clearing his
text: throat, gulping hard. Still it won't go down.
text: ROSS, in wild furry, grabs GUS, trying to pry his mouth open and retrieve it.
text: The grapple. GUS shoves ROSS away and suddenly sees before him the open bottle
text: of flat root beer soda. He grabs it, and with a mighty heave of his Adam's
text: Apple, washes away the screw.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (howling)
dialog: Nooooooo!
text: He starts to strangle GUS, trying to get the screw back. Then he switches to a
text: violent attempt to perform the Heimlich Maneuver. GUS yanks free, spins around,
text: hauls off and belts ROSS in the jaw. Pow! ROSS falls to the floor, out cold.
text: LONG SHOT: for a moment all is still. SUPERMAN is slowly rising to his knees.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: (to GUS)
dialog: Thanks for --
dialog: When suddenly:
text: EFFESCTS: With an unearthly roar, the machine itself comes to life again. An
text: even more terrifying life. It glows much hotter and brighter, crackling and
text: pulsing with tremendous energy. LORELEI screams in terror.
speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: Make it stop!
text: ON VERA -- astonished, pushing buttons, trying to control it.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: I can't! It's out of control!
speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: But how? Where's it getting the
dialog: power from ???!
text: VERA looks straight up. VERTICAL PAN (FAST) UP TO THE TOP OF THE COMPUTER.
text: EFFECTS: The machine is sending crackling lightening-like energy probes through
text: the ceiling of the cave.
dialog: C.U. GUS -- awed
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: It's feeding itself. It wants
dialog: to live.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF GRAND CANYON - DAY
text: WIDE SHOT: An incredible sight: the crackling red-hot energy probes leap from
text: the ground beneath, dart up into the air, and literally hook on to the power
text: lines and pylons. The machine is feeding itself right from the source. The very
text: power lines themselves glow red-hot from the tremendous zapping of energy taking
dialog: place.
text: LONG SHOT: We SEE the energy probes racing along the power lines toward the
text: horizon, toward the rest of the nation.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY/SPACE
text: LOOKING DOWN at EARTHS'S GLOBE as power blackouts begin to hit North America.
scene_heading: EXT. BIG CITY - NIGHT
text: LOOKING DOWN FROM GREAT DISTANCE as power blackout hits, lights start to go out.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING THEATER
text: An operation is in progress.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (quiet, careful)
dialog: All right, nurse, we're going into
dialog: the brain now. Be ready with every--
text: Suddenly, the lights in the operating room flicker and go out.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: (in darkness)
dialog: Oh, God---
scene_heading: INT. CAVE. ULTIMATE COMPUTER
text: The machine glows with an unearthly energy. Suddenly, the ray of deadly green
text: Kryptonite goes on again, hitting SUPERMAN with full force.
text: ON SUPERMAN -- already weakened from the first bout, he falls to the floor, in
dialog: terrible pain.
text: ON GUS--from inside the generator area he sees what's happening. He grabs a
text: fire-safety axe from its hook and races toward the globe-like part of the
text: machine that sends the Kryptonite ray out.
text: NEW ANGLE -- GUS hacks away at the mechanism. His expression is intense,
text: tortured. This is Dr. Frankenstein killing the monster he created, the inventor
text: forced to destroy his own invention. With tremendous effort, he chops and slams
text: and smashes the offending part of the computer, finally destroying it. Hunks of
text: metal drop to the floor. The green ray shuts off.
text: SUPERMAN struggles to his feet. He looks awful.
text: GUS, exhausted, stands there by the source of destruction. He's done it. He
text: drops the axe. Suddenly:
text: Sound: A horrible, screeching, electronic noise as:
text: EFFECTS: The machine, furious, lifts GUS into the air on a beam of energy and
text: hurls him full force against the wall of the cave. He crashes into it with
text: terrific impact and falls to the ground behind a pile of rock and rubble. From
text: the incredible force of the blow, it seems certain that the machine has killed
dialog: him.
text: A terrible moment of silence. Then SUPERMAN, looking like he's in total despair,
text: turns and slinks out of the cave, clutching his left arm.
speaker_heading: LORELEI
dialog: No! Don't leave us alone in
dialog: here! Superman --
dialog: (but he's gone)
text: The machine glows and shakes, its energy probes zapping through the rock ceiling
dialog: above.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: I don't know about you, girly,
dialog: but I'm getting out of here!
text: But LORELEI is first on the stairs, as she runs like hell off the machine
text: itself. VERA is right behind her. LORELEI gets to the bottom, dashes across the
text: "moat" via one of the wedge-shaped grids.
text: ON ROSS -- coming-to in the interior, by the generator. he picks himself up and
text: runs after LORELEI.
text: A moment later, VERA, coming from the greatest distance, starts to race across
dialog: the moat.
dialog: 
text: EFFECTS: VERA is literally "sucked" back into the machine, dragged across the
text: "moat" and pulled into the computer's entrails. As she screams in protest, the
text: intense force slams her into a section of the circuitry.
text: ON VERA: A monstrous transformation begins to take place. VERA becomes part of
text: the machine. No longer human. Circuitry appears beneath her skin. Her face pulls
text: and distorts into grotesque non-human cubistic form. Charges of electricity and
text: power pass into her body, light it up. The effect is very frightening to behold.
text: Unearthly sounds come from her throat.
text: NEW ANGLE -- As LORELEI tries to run from the cave, "VERA'S" linked arm extend
text: and a silvery sphere of "magneticism" shoots out like a cannon ball aimed at
text: her. Suddenly LORELEI is yanked upwards, stuck fast to the wall of the cave,
text: screaming, kicking, unable to free herself.
text: C.U. VERA -- This is no longer a human face. A hideous arm-like probe extends
text: from her forehead and shoots out a hot yellow beam.
text: NEW ANGLE -- the yellow beam hits ROSS, stopping him in his tracks in front of
text: the machine, torturing him.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Sis! No, it's Bubba--
text: (he squirms in
dialog: pain)
dialog: 
text: ON THE TOP OF THE COMPUTER -- The energy probes continue to shoot right through
text: the ceiling of the cave.
scene_heading: EXT. CANYON. TOP LEDGE (PYLONS) - DAY
text: The probes continue to feed on the electrical power supply.
scene_heading: EXT. METROPOLIS - NIGHT
text: Lights start going off in Metropolis skyscrapers.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRACK - NIGHT
text: A subway train is moving down the tunnel TOWARD CAMERA. As it comes CLOSE, we
text: SEE LANA and RICKY inside. Suddenly the black-out hits. Lights go out. Train
dialog: stops.
text: Sound: screaming, panic of the PASSENGERS.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: (terrified)
dialog: Mommy! Mommy!
scene_heading: EXT. IRIQUOIS TRAIL NUCLEAR POWER STATION - NIGHT
dialog: LONG SHOT: of the three silos we SAW earlier in the forest fire. Coming from B.
text: G. at great speed is a blue blur zooming through the sky: SUPERMAN.
scene_heading: INT. NUCLEAR CHAMBER
text: The SCIENTISTS in great consternation. ONE looks at an electronic grid map of
text: the U,S.A., showing the blackouts coming closer.
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: What the hell is causing it?!
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: Search me. All I know is it
dialog: looks like a complete electronic
dialog: grid-lock. And if it gets to us--
speaker_heading: DR. HARRIS
dialog: (grim faced)
dialog: Which one is the panic button?
scene_heading: INT. CAVE. ULTIMATE COMPUTER - DAY
text: LOOKING TOWARD THE ENTRANCE: As SUPERMAN, looking a bit bedraggled, returns and
text: enters. He holds his left arm behind his back, under his cape, as if favoring a
dialog: hurt elbow.
text: REVERSE: WIDE ANGLE SHOWS US WHAT HE, TOO, SEES: The machine glowing brighter
text: and brighter; VERA, totally transformed into a robot-like creature, ruthlessly
text: training the painful yellow ray on ROSS, who is immobilized and tormented;
text: LORELEI still pinned to the wall up high by the magnetic sphere.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Help me...help me....
text: Immediately, SUPERMAN runs into the area just in front of ROSS so as to fully
text: absorb the yellow beam and block it off.
text: REVERSE FROM BEHIND THEM: A shaken ROSS, relieved at last, crawls away into the
text: shadows of the cavern.
text: WIDE ANGLE -- This yellow beam has no effect on SUPERMAN. But just as VERA
text: terminates it, two enormous arms of the machine, like giant pinball flippers,
text: begin to slide across the cave floor, about to close in and pin SUPERMAN.
text: These two transformer arms trap him and raises him slightly off the ground,
text: pulling him forward in a direct line toward the moat, until:
text: CLOSER -- He is deposited on the very transparent wedge where VERA stood when
dialog: she was sucked into the machine. And now, to our horror, the same thing happens
text: to him. Although he seems to be trying to resist the incredible "pull," SUPERMAN
text: is drawn across the moat and into the very bowels of the giant computer. He is
text: pulled, as if by a giant suctioning force, past VERA and down into the center of
text: the apparatus, where the generator is.
text: For a terrible moment, all seems lost. Then, he is SEEN deep in there, as he
text: reveals what he had hidden in his left hand, behind his cape.
text: CLOSER -- It's a silver canister, about two feet long, cylindrical in shape. He
text: unscrews the lid.
text: EFFECTS: Immediately an incredible red glow bursts from the canister, so strong
text: we almost need to shield our eyes. WE RECOGNIZE IT, FROM ITS COLOR AND
text: INTENSITY, IMMEDIATELY" It is the nuclear core he stabilized at Iroquois Trail
dialog: Power Plant.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: You're Hungry for energy?
dialog: Taste this.
text: He drops the nuclear core in the center of the machine.
text: LONG SHOT: The giant computer begins to glow even more brightly than before.
text: Red-hot, then white hot, then it begins to crackle and rumble and smoke. The
text: machine is overdosing.
text: EFFECTS: IN SPECTACULAR SERIES OF SHOTS, the machine self-destructs. Explosions.
text: Burn-outs. Short circuits. Flare-ups. Entire chunks of metal hurled into the
text: air. Tremendous noise. It's like watching the end of the world as we WATCH the
text: machine commit suicide.
text: IN THE MIDST OF THIS, INTERCUT SHOT OF LORELEI, released from her magnetic trap,
text: sliding down the cave wall and landing unceremoniously (and unconsciously) on
dialog: the ground.
text: At last there is a gigantic explosion within the computer. It totally
text: disintegrates, bursting apart from its own gluttony, wreaking havoc and total
text: destruction within the cave.
text: A long moment as the dust settles. No sign of life. Piles of rubble and broken
text: rock everywhere. It looks like a bombed-out battlefield. And then...
text: ON A MOUND OF EARTH AND DEBRIS -- The hand of a white man struggles up and out
text: from beneath the pile of rock.
text: PAN SLIGHTLY LEFT: From an adjacent mound of rubble, the hand of a black man is
text: seen pushing out from beneath the earth.
text: And SUPERMAN and GUS clasp hands and pull each other out from beneath the
dialog: mounds.
text: They struggle up and out, clutching their hands together: alive, triumphant, and
dialog: partners at last.
scene_heading: EXT. OIL FIELDS - DAY
text: ON THE FOREMAN. Looking in quiet despair at his non-working acres of derricks.
text: Shrugging, he turns and starts walking away when:
text: Sound: the thunk of a motor starting, a pump beginning to work.
text: He spins around in wonder and sees the pump nearest him suddenly coming to life
dialog: again.
text: Seconds later, another one starts up. Then another. Then five more.
scene_heading: EXT. PIPELINE, DESERT OR TUNDRA - DAY
text: Oil starts gushing out the formerly dry valve-faucet. The delighted WORKER
text: rushes to turn it off.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - DAY
text: AERIAL SHOT. The tankers begin to move away from each other in different
dialog: directions.
scene_heading: EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY
text: A car pulls up to the gas pumps. STATION ATTENDANT comes over to the car.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Regular or premium?
speaker_heading: MAN IN CAR
dialog: What the hell, she hasn't had a
dialog: drink in so long, let's give her
text: a tankful of the good stuff.
text: The ATTENDANT starts to pump gas in the car.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - DAY
text: SUPERMAN flying with GUS clinging to his outstretched arms, his legs wrapped
text: around his waist. Sort of like the stork flying his bundle. GUS is absolutely
text: terrified. He opens one eye, looks down, quickly shuts it.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: How you doing down there?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Don't make me talk, please.
dialog: I got enough problems just
dialog: hangin' on.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: (a little laugh)
dialog: Hey, you're perfectly safe.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I ain't about to argue with you.
dialog: (as they fly)
dialog: What's gonna happen to them
dialog: three? Ross the boss and those
dialog: ladies?
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: That's up to the judge, Gus.
dialog: It's not your problem anymore.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: Watch out for them air pockets!
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: No, we're just going down.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (terrified)
dialog: We gonna crash?
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: I never crash, Gus. That'd be
dialog: embarrassing.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (eyes shut)
dialog: We back in Metropolis?
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: No...I just have a little stop
dialog: to make.
text: ANGLE DOWN: Beneath them is a coal mine in West Virginia or similar place.
scene_heading: EXT. COAL MINE - DAY
text: A big mound of coal sits on the ground near a shack and a mine entrance. A FEW
text: MINERS look up in amazement as SUPERMAN and GUS land.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Whatcha wanna stop here for?
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Not that I ain't glad to be on the
dialog: ground, y'understand.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: Just a second.
text: He walks over to the miners, and picks up a lump of coal.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: Can you guys spare this one?
speaker_heading: A MINER
dialog: (having trouble finding
dialog: his voice)
dialog: ...Sure, Superman.
dialog: (incredulously)
dialog: It is Superman, isn't it?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (lording it over
dialog: them)
dialog: Hey, man, who'dya think it
dialog: was, your mama?
text: ON SUPERMAN -- he turns away, his back to them all.
text: EFFECTS: CLOSER ON HIS HANDS as he squeezes the lump of coal. The incredible
dialog: pressure of super-strength does what it takes nature centuries to do: before our
text: eyes the lump of coal turns into a Liz Taylor-size diamond, glinting in the
dialog: light.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Too showy.
text: EFFECTS: He squeezes it further down to a normal-size diamond.
text: Holding it in his fist, he turns back to them.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (to GUS)
dialog: Let's go
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I was afraid you'd say that.
speaker_heading: (to MINERS)
dialog: Hey, is there a bus station
dialog: around here?
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: (with a laugh)
dialog: Suit yourself, Gus.
speaker_heading: (to the MINERS)
dialog: Say, does your boss use a
dialog: computer in this operation?
speaker_heading: FIRST MINER
dialog: Yeah, a small one. Why?
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: You tell him he can do a lot worse
dialog: than giving Gus Gorman here a
dialog: job. Tell him I guarantee it.
text: He smiles farewell and takes off.
text: HOLD ON GUS -- watching him fly away.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Take it easy, man.
text: He turns to the awe0struck MINERS.
speaker_heading: FIRST MINER
dialog: You flew with him?
text: In a gesture of bravado, Gus unsnaps the buttons on his shirt front, as if to
text: reveal a Super-Gus outfit. But, of course, there's just an old T-shirt there. So
text: he quickly adopts a big-shot tone:
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: So, You fellas ain't never
dialog: seen the super dude before,
dialog: huh? Him and me, we go way
dialog: back. I mean way back. We
dialog: generally help each other out,
dialog: y'see, like just yesterday was
dialog: in this cave, see...
text: And he starts to spin his yarn to the wide-eyed AUDIENCE:
scene_heading: INT/EXT FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: ON SUPERMAN -- smiling affably.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: Hi. I reserved a table for two.
text: REVERSE: A VERY ELEGANT MAITRE D' is at the restaurant desk of a very toney
text: French restaurant, all red velvet and fake Matisse paintings. He is regarding
text: SUPERMAN with great disdain.
speaker_heading: MAITRE D'
dialog: I'm sorry, but we won't be able
dialog: to seat you.
speaker_heading: TWO SHOT
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: (the smile fading)
dialog: I know I'm a little early but --
speaker_heading: MAITRE D'
dialog: We won't be able to seat you
dialog: later either.
dialog: (pointedly)
dialog: Gentlemen are required to
dialog: wear jacket and tie.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: (nonplussed)
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: I'd better try to catch her before
dialog: she leaves.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR, METROPOLIS HOTEL - NIGHT
dialog: This is that clean, nicely furnished, moderately-priced family hotel we all wish
dialog: really existed.
text: ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS -- as they open and CLARK emerges, straightening his tie.
text: FOLLOW HIM as he hurries down the corridor, past the Room Service trolley beside
text: the door of room 311. He knocks on the door. A very spiffily dressed LANA opens
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Clark! What a nice surprise!
dialog: Come on in.
scene_heading: INT. METROPOLIS HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: RICKY is sitting at a little table/desk, enjoying the Room Service supper that
text: was brought up on that trolley outside.
text: The room is small, a bit cramped, what with a folding cot that has been moved in
text: for RICKY, plus a chair, table, LANA'S bed, etc.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Hi. Mister Kent.
dialog: (as CLARK smiles
dialog: back, RICKY can't
dialog: help bragging:)
dialog: Guess who Mom's having dinner
dialog: with tonight? Superman!
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (apologetically,
speaker_heading: to LANA)
dialog: Actually, that's why I stopped
dialog: by. He's realy sorry, he wanted
dialog: to make it, but then he...ran into
dialog: a problem.
text: LANA looks a little disappointed, but less so than RICKY.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (nodding understandingly)
dialog: I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: But if you wouldn't mind
dialog: settling for me --
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (brightening)
dialog: Anyday...
scene_heading: TWO-SHOT -- CLARK and LANA
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: He asked me to give you
dialog: something. You know, he
dialog: and I, we talk all the time.
dialog: And when he heard about
dialog: you having to pawn your
dialog: diamond ring, he thought
dialog: that was terrible.
dialog: (awkwardly)
dialog: So when he found this sort
dialog: of, um, lying around -- well,
dialog: he thought you might like to
dialog: have it.
text: He takes from his breast pocket a little ring set with the diamond SUPERMAN
text: squeezed out of coal. He lays it in her hand.
text: MED. C.U. LANA -- She just stares at it as if she can't believe this is
text: happening. When she looks up at CLARK, her eyes are very large and a little
dialog: moist.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: I...I...
text: But she is too moved for wards. Finally, she can only throw her arms around
text: CLARK and hig him with all her might and all her heart. Which he doesn't mind a
dialog: bit.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR, METROPOLIS HOTEL - NIGHT
text: ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS -- as they open. This time it is BRAD who steps -- or
text: stumbles -- out, holding forth his new best friends, the TWO SINISTER TYPES (one
dialog: with scar and eyepatch, one with shved head and mustache) we SAW earlier in the
speaker_heading: bar with (EVIL) SUPERMAN.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Wait till you see her.
dialog: (waxing poetic)
text: Hair like a sunset, eyes like
dialog: stars, and built like a --
scene_heading: GUY WITH EYEPATCH
dialog: (overlapping, scornfully)
dialog: A chick like that, what's she want
dialog: with you?
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: She's my girl. I came all the way
dialog: from Smallville just to bring her
dialog: back.
dialog: (with great assurance)
dialog: She's crazy about me -- she just
dialog: don't know it yet.
text: They lurch down the corridor, peering at room numbers.
scene_heading: INT. METROPOLIS HOTEL ROM - NIGHT
text: Slipping the ring on her finger, LANA studies its gleam in the lamplight and
text: glows with pleasure herself.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: (his own perspective)
dialog: Wow, a ring form Superman!
dialog: Lemme see, Mom!
text: He jumps up, knocking a dish of hard candies off the table. They scatter on the
text: carpet. RICKY looks dismayed, but CLARK is, as always, ready to help.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Here, I'll get those.
text: He kneels to pick up the candies.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (still in the throes
dialog: of emotion)
dialog: I really don't know what to say.
dialog: (as CLARK smiles up
dialog: at her, she almost
dialog: blushes)
dialog: Thank you. I mean, thank him--
text: WIDE ANGLE -- It is at just this moment that BRAD and his boozing buddies burst
text: in to see "his girl" sporting a diamond ring on her outstretched hand and
text: looking soulfully down at CLARK KENT, who is down on one knee, gazing up at
dialog: her. To BRAD it all means one thing:
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Wha----you sonofa----
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Brad!
text: BRAD charges into the room like a bull, his two BUDDIES (brawlers by nature)
text: right behind him. (NOTE: CLARK'S dilema in this fight is that he must retain the
dialog: CLARK KENT identity, i.e. not only can he not use super-powers, he can't even
dialog: hit anybody since it would be lethal. Therefore, his strategy is to look clumsy
text: and awkward, while actually manipulating the defeat of the three bullies. What
dialog: follows is very quick:)
text: BRAD, drunk, takes a swing at CLARK and misses; his momentum sends him falling
text: forward over the room's chair.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: whoops----
text: The BALD GUY throws a tale lamp at CLARK, who ducks in time. As LANA and RICKY
text: try to get out of the way, the BALD GUY charges CLARK before CLARK can get to an
text: upright position. Thus CLARK comes up just in time to "accidentally" butt his
text: attacker in the gut. The BALD GUY sails right into the open closet, smashing his
text: skull against the inside wall. Out cold, he slides to the floor. Quickly, LANA
text: runs over and shuts the closet door on him, as if to say, "That's that."
text: The GUY WITH THE EYPATCH is enraged:
text: CLARK puts his hands up, as if backing away:
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Take it easy now, c'mon, be
dialog: reasonable.
text: INSERT: CLARK kicks the fallen lamp at the GUY'S feet.
text: THE GUY WITH THE EYEPATCH steps on th lamp, trips, falls forward full force on
text: the folding cot, which promptly folds itself up, both sides, squashing and
text: imprisoning him inside the mattress. in effect, the GUY is filling in a sandwich
text: completely immobilized.
text: ON BRAD: Who picks himself up, glares drunkenly at CLARK, practicaly pawing the
dialog: grounf as he speaks:
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Kent, I hate you. I always hated
dialog: you. And you know why, Kent?
dialog: Because you're nice. Nice guys
dialog: finish----
text: And before he can utter the word "last," he's overcome with rage. He puts down
text: his head, roars like an animal, and charges at CLARK like a bull at a toreador.
text: CLARK goes to pick up the glass candy dish, shich is in BRAD'S hand. BRAD
text: catapaults over him and goes right out the open door, lands splat on top of the
text: Room Service trolley in the hallway.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR, METROPOLIS HOTEL - NIGHT
text: Causing the trolley, with BRAD spread-eagled on top of it, to head right for the
text: elevator. Just as we think it's going to crash, the elevator doors open and
text: BRAD, trolley and all, roll right into the elevator where a DIGNIFIED COUPLE
dialog: stand.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR
text: The WOMAN looks down with distaste at the drunken and battered BRAD laying on
text: top of the food on the serving tray.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: No wonder they sent it back.
text: Her husband nods.
scene_heading: INT. DAILY PLANET, PERRY WHITE'S OFFICE - DAY
text: PERRY is at his desk. LOIS is sitting facing him, looking trim and tan and
text: terrific. CLARK is beside her.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Lois, I've got to hand it to you.
dialog: You're amazing. Who else could
dialog: manage to turn a three-week
dialog: tropical vacation into a front page
dialog: story that's going to blow the lid
dialog: off government corruption in the
dialog: Caribbean?
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: I just knew I was onto something
dialog: when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (repressing a tiny,
dialog: fond smile)
dialog: You're the best, Lois.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: I'd better be. Suddenly I've got
dialog: competition to keep up with.
speaker_heading: (as CLARK looks
dialog: confused)
dialog: Your high school reunion article.
dialog: I though it was terrific. And
dialog: fascinating.
dialog: (shyly curious)
dialog: Especially about the girl back
dialog: home.
dialog: (expansively)
dialog: I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll
dialog: take you to lunch and you can
dialog: tell me all about it.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've
dialog: already got a lunch date. With
dialog: Mr. White's new secretary.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: (intrigued)
dialog: Oh?
text: NEW ANGLE -- The office door opens and LANA LANG, looking very perky, sticks her
dialog: head in.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (softly, as she puts
dialog: some papers on
speaker_heading: PERRY'S desk)
dialog: Hi. Clark.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Lois, met Lana Lang. Smallville's
dialog: latest gift to Metropolis.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: (more intrigued, taking
dialog: a closer look at her now)
dialog: Oh??
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Glad to meet you, Miss Lane.
dialog: I like your writing a lot.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (shaking the hand, LANA
dialog: has offered, LOIS can't
text: help noticing the ring on
dialog: her other hand; lightly)
dialog: I like your sparkler a lot.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: (confiding, happily)
dialog: Me too. I couldn't believe it
dialog: when Clark gave it to me.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: (she can't believe
dialog: it either)
dialog: Clark gave you -- ???
text: She can't finish the sentence. But she doesn't get a chance to, anyway.
text: From off-screen, the not-so dulcet tones of MISS HENDERSON:
speaker_heading: MISS HENDERSON
dialog: Mr. White, look what I've got for
dialog: you.
text: ON MISS HENDERSON -- pushing before her a new bingo machine -- the electronic
text: kind that has jets of air pushing the plastic balls inside a dome like popcorn
text: maker. The JINGO sign is attached.
speaker_heading: MISS HENDERSON
dialog: (terribly thrilled)
dialog: It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's
dialog: state-of-the art.
dialog: (to all)
dialog: People, I am in love with this
dialog: machine.
dialog: (she pushes it in
speaker_heading: front of PERRY)
dialog: Go ahead, Mr. White.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: (already miserable)
dialog: Where's the handle?
speaker_heading: MISS HENDERSON
dialog: (giggling)
dialog: There is no handle! You just push
dialog: a button.
text: She shows him the button. He punches it. The machine activates. The plastic
text: balls begin to jump and leap inside the dome. then it starts going faster.
text: Faster. Smoke starts to curl from the machine.
text: Sound: An awful grinding noise.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: What's that terrible smell?
text: ON THE MACHINE -- it self-destructs, firing JINGO balls all over the office,
text: exploding its plastic dome.
text: FULL SHOT -- as ALL stand there, stunned.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (backing out of
dialog: the room)
dialog: Uh...excuse me, folks...
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Kent!
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've
dialog: got an errand to run.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY ABOVE PISA - DAY
text: ON SUPERMAN as he flies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: (shamefaced, to himself)
dialog: Gosh, what an awful thing to have
dialog: done.
text: He starts to descend.
text: WIDE SHOT: He arrives at the top of the tower, starts to push it back down again
dialog: so that it will lean once more.
scene_heading: EXT. SOUVENIR STAND, PISA - DUSK
text: Where our MAN once again admires his stock of vertical Tower models, looks to
text: the real thing, looks back and then does a double-take worthy of Billy Gilbert
text: in his prime: for the Tower is now the LEANING TOWER again and all his wares are
dialog: useless.
text: Hysterical, he smashes shelves tot he ground, makes violent obscene gestures at
text: the caped HERO above, weeping and screaming.
speaker_heading: SHOPKEEPER
dialog: Cretino! Stronzo!
dialog: (and other expletives deleted)
scene_heading: EXT. SKY/SPACE
text: All problems attended to, he flies majestically across the magical place where
text: light blue sky deepens into the dark black of outer space. As HE FLIES TO
text: CAMERA, he shrugs as if to say, "Well, you can't win 'em all, folks." Then
text: there's the comforting, familiar, warm smile and the little salute that lets us
dialog: know the world is safe in the hands of the one, the only...SUPERMAN!
speaker_heading: THE END
