speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: A rim of swirling light appears, circling helplessly into a
text: gigantic BLACK HOLE. It spirals inward...
text: A phone RINGS.
scene_heading: INT. RUN-DOWN CHAPEL - NIGHT
text: Dim, high-ceilinged. Gutted of half its pews. Broken
text: stained glass windows. Vandalized statues of saints.
text: Iconoclastic clutter lies beneath rusted, wrought iron stands
text: of votive candles.
text: At the chapel's front: a decapitated Jesus hangs from a
text: charred wooden cross above where an altar once stood.
text: The altar space: converted to a computer work station. Piles
text: of carelessly stashed discs and printouts abound.
text: Sacristy doorways lead to kitchen and bathroom. An unmade
text: brass bed sits off to one side.
text: In an alcove off to the other side, a SHRINE. Candles burn
text: in a votive stand. Framed pictures hang above it, their
text: faces turned to the wall.
text: A tormented FIGURE sits at the computer...
text: Meet: QOHEN LETH, 40s, gaunt, pale and completely hairless.
text: His hands clench and unclench above his keyboard as he stares
text: mesmerized at the swirling image of a BLACK HOLE SCREENSAVER.
text: His rotary phone RINGS.
text: Qohen blinks out of his trance, a look of panic on his face,
text: and reaches for the phone... too late.
text: The phone stops ringing before he can answer it.
text: Qohen MOANS softly and turns back to his computer. He taps a
text: key and the screensaver disappears, replaced by a scrolling
text: flurry of esoteric symbols.
text: He types frenetically, eyes focused intensely.
text: The phone RINGS. Qohen snatches the receiver.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Hello? Hello?
dialog: No answer.
text: Qohen SIGHS, slowly hangs up the receiver, and returns his
text: attention to the computer screen. He begins typing again...
text: His wind-up clock RINGS. Its hands read 5:09.
text: Qohen jumps. He slaps the alarm off, rubs his eyes as if
text: he's just awakened. Standing and stretching, he raises his
text: eyes to the disfigured crucifix before him.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - LATER
text: Qohen stands in his small galley kitchen, waiting for the
text: microwave to finish, an open container of generic "INSTANT
text: OATMEAL" on the counter in front of him.
text: An open cupboard above reveals various food products, all
text: bland, all tasteless, all generically packaged in white with
text: block black lettering.
text: Qohen methodically sets the counter with plate, napkin,
text: spoon... and, after retrieving the spoon from its drawer,
text: notices a steak knife.
text: He picks it up, studies its edge, then... gently traces a
text: forearm vein, like an architect drawing a blueprint.
text: The knife draws blood.
text: Qohen stares at it.
text: The microwave BEEPS.
text: The wall phone RINGS.
text: Qohen looks confused for a moment. Then, frantic and
text: hopeful, he lunges for the phone.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Hello?
text: He listens, face turning bland.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: No... We're sorry... We're afraid you
dialog: have the wrong number.
text: Qohen hangs up, takes his steaming bowl of oatmeal from the
text: microwave. He stands at the counter, spoon in hand, staring
text: at the bowl with slight distaste: just another job to do.
text: He absently brings his wrist to his mouth, tastes the blood.
text: His face sours.
text: He grabs his napkin and wipes his tongue clean.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - LATER
text: Qohen stares at himself in the mirror as he brushes his
text: teeth. He spits, takes a deep breath.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - LATER
text: Clad in black, sleeves and collar buttoned, Qohen pops a disc
text: out of his computer and slips it into his shirt pocket.
scene_heading: SHRINE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Qohen lights a candle. He stares at one of the picture
text: frames, then carefully turns it to reveal its hidden photo.
scene_heading: INSERT - PHOTO
text: Standing on the front porch of a suburban home, Qohen's WIFE
text: holds their baby SON in her arms, both smiling at the camera.
text: She holds the baby's hand up in a pudgy-fingered wave.
text: Standing behind the two, YOUNG QOHEN beams with pride.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Qohen gazes at the photo, then bows his head, fighting his
text: emotion. He turns the picture's face to the wall again.
text: He walks down the long aisle to the chapel door, opens it.
scene_heading: INT. DILAPIDATED VESTIBULE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Qohen approaches a great oak door. He hesitates as he
text: touches the doorknob, bracing himself, then opens it...
text: -..to a blast of light and STREET NOISES.
scene_heading: EXT. INNER-CITY STREET - MORNING
text: Qohen exits. Colorful graffiti mars words etched in stone
text: above the door: "THE BROTHERHOOD OF THE INEFFABLE NAME".
text: He hurries past caged storefronts, eyes downcast.
text: Near his bus stop, Qohen sees a GIRL, 10, sitting on the curb
text: beside a toppled bicycle. She holds a skinned knee, CRYING.
text: Qohen hesitates, looks around. No one else is there to help.
text: He approaches the Girl cautiously.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We hate to impose ourselves, but... may
dialog: we assist you in any way?
text: The Girl covers her face with her hands, still CRYING.
text: Qohen stares at her helplessly, then moves to her bike.
text: A bent fender scrapes the front wheel when he tests it. He
text: tries to pry the fender back into shape.
text: The Girl drops her hands from her face.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Leave my bike alone! Leave it alone!
text: A SIREN sounds close by, and a helmeted MOTORCYCLE COP skids
text: up to the curb, engine ROARING. He turns off the siren,
text: dismounts, slowly approaches Qohen and the girl.
speaker_heading: MOTORCYCLE COP
dialog: Please step back from the child, sir.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We were simply attempting to --
speaker_heading: MOTORCYCLE COP
text: Put down the bike and step back.
text: Qohen gently lays down the bicycle.
text: His bus passes, and he hastens to his stop.
text: The bus door opens. Qohen looks at the Motorcycle Cop
text: comforting the crying Girl. His face tightens.
scene_heading: INT. CITY BUS - MOMENTS LATER
text: Qohen sits alone in the rear seat. The bus jumps and
text: jostles. Qohen shuts his eyes, hands folded as if in prayer.
text: TRAFFIC NOISES BLARE in a crescendo of anxiety.
scene_heading: INT. QOHEN'S WORK CUBICLE - AFTERNOON
text: Neat and orderly. No sign of personal belongings.
text: One poster adorns the wall: a man's torso in a sharply-
text: tailored taupe suit. Bold letters proclaim: "MANAGEMENT".
text: Smaller script reads: "Everything's Under Control."
text: A video camera (labeled MANCAM) records Qohen's every move.
text: Except Qohen doesn't move. He simply sits staring at his
text: computer monitor, trancelike.
text: The image on the monitor shows Qohen from behind, staring at
text: an image of himself on his monitor staring at an image of
dialog: himself... ad infinitum.
text: His phone RINGS.
text: Qohen slowly comes back to reality as the phone continues
text: RINGING. Finally, he picks up the receiver.
text: A female COMPUTERIZED VOICE speaks.
speaker_heading: COMPUTERIZED VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Hello -- Qohen Leth -- Corporate Health
dialog: Maintenance has approved review of your
dialog: disability request for today at 14:40.
dialog: Please be prompt.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We are nothing if not prompt.
text: Qohen hangs up, glances at his watch. He touches his
text: keyboard: the image of himself shrinks to the screen's upper
text: corner, replaced by a column of flashing signs, cryptic
text: symbols, formulae and numerals.
text: Qohen frowns and with some effort begins typing.
text: MR. JOBY, 20s, appears in the cubicle's doorway, scratching
text: an elusive itch inside his ill-fitting suit coat. He is a
text: soft, manic-looking man with shaggy hair and beard.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: How's it hanging, Quinn?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: (without looking up)
dialog: It's Qohen, Mr. Joby, and, as we've told
dialog: you before, it isn't hanging at all well.
dialog: We're dying.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Again? Better see the medics about that.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We have an appointment this afternoon.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Not this afternoon, Quinn.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: You approved it.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Cancel it. You got that Transfinite
dialog: Quantum Paradox Project due today.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We attached it to you yesterday.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Good work. But you still have that
dialog: Whatchacallit Project due next week.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: The Neural Synaptic Intervention
text: Project. Also finished.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Tautologics Division is running the
dialog: standard redundancies.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Whoa! You did all that this morning?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We did it all at home last night. As
dialog: we've told you repeatedly, we find our
dialog: work environment... distressing. The
dialog: people, the lighting, the noise, the
dialog: interruptions, the... the people...
dialog: (taking a deep breath)
dialog: Considering our at-home output, we can't
dialog: begin to imagine why you insist on our
dialog: coming here each day.
text: Joby removes his suit coat and reaches over his shoulder to
text: pursue a particularly shy itch.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: That's a Management decision, Quinn.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
scene_heading: Qohen. Q--no U--O-H-E-N.
speaker_heading: JOBY
text: Out of my hands.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Perhaps we should talk to Management.
text: Joby stifles a guffaw, then casually drapes his suit
text: over the ManCam.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: (voice lowered)
dialog: Nobody talks to Management, Quinn. No
dialog: way, no how, nuh-uh, nyetskis. Take my
dialog: advice. Knock off the bitching and
dialog: moaning. It's not all that bad here.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: It's worse than you can imagine,
dialog: Mr. Joby, but we could suffer the wear
dialog: and tear on our nerves if only we weren't
dialog: afraid of missing our call.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Your call...
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Yes, our call. We've mentioned it a
dialog: number of times.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: .»-. Ain't ringing a bell.
dialog: coat
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We're expecting a certain phone call, a
dialog: call we've been waiting for all our
dialog: lives, a call that will give our lives
dialog: purpose and meaning, and each minute we
dialog: spend here, we fear we may be missing it.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Oh. Right. That call. Um... How about
dialog: letting your machine take it? Or get
dialog: call forwarding. I guess I could bend
dialog: the rules on personal calls in your case.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We have to be home to receive it.
text: Joby shakes his head, stumped. He moves behind Qohen and
text: massages his shoulders.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: I feel for you, Quinn, but there's
dialog: nothing I can do.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: (stiffening)
dialog: We prefer not to be touched.
text: Joby stops, steps back.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: We've been extremely patient, Mr. Joby,
dialog: but we're afraid we must now issue an
dialog: ultimatum. Either you let us work at
dialog: home, or we will be forced to resign.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: You can't quit, Quinn! You're the best
dialog: cruncher I got!
text: Qohen turns back to his computer and resumes typing.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: If our meeting with Health Maintenance is
dialog: successful, the issue will be settled.
dialog: If not, you leave us no choice.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: You're killing me! Be reasonable!
text: Qohen ignores him.
text: Joby grabs his coat and turns to leave, frustrated.
speaker_heading: JOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll see what I can do, Quinn.
scene_heading: INT. HEALTH MAINTENANCE BOARD - DAY
text: Three doctors sit at one end of a long table, grayish light
text: from an overcast day sifting through the window behind them.
text: At the head sits DOCTOR #1, a prim woman in a drab business
text: suit. She polishes her bifocals with a tissue.
text: To her right sits DOCTOR #2, a middle-aged man in hospital
text: scrubs that reveal a NicoDerm patch on his upper arm. He
text: chews a wad of Nicorette gum while perusing Qohen's file.
text: DOCTOR #3 slouches to Doctor #1's left. A handsome young man
text: in a white lab coat, stethoscope draped around his neck, he
text: gazes out the window with the soulful look of a bored poet.
text: Qohen sits stone-faced at the far end of the table.
text: Doctor #1 puts on her glasses to appraise him.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #1
dialog: And this is...?
text: Doctor #2 nervously clicks his pen, chomping on his gum.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #2
dialog: Qohen Leth, Ontological Research
dialog: Division, requesting Disability Leave.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Or reassignment to work at home.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #1
dialog: That's a Management decision, Mr. Leth.
dialog: We only deal with health issues here.
dialog: What seems to be the problem?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We're dying.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #3
dialog: Who's "we"?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Us. Ourselves.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #3
dialog: But there's only the one of you.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: So it would appear.
text: Doctor #3 SNIFFS, returns to gazing out the window.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #2
dialog: (consulting file)
dialog: Subject's had five physicals in the last
dialog: year. He's healthy as a horse.
text: Doctor #1 takes the file from him, scanning it.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #1
dialog: What makes you think you're dying?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We can feel it. Deep inside us...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #2
dialog: Heart's strong as an ox.
text: (a frustrated puff on pen)
dialog: BP and cholesterol I could only dream of.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
text: Our hair has fallen out.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #3
dialog: Idiopathic.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #2
dialog: Perfectly harmless. The tests don't lie.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
text: Then the tests are merely mistaken.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #1
dialog: According to your file, you're the most
dialog: productive number cruncher in your --
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Entity cruncher. Our data is much more
dialog: complex than mere numbers.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #1
dialog: Dying people are rarely so productive.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Nevertheless, we're dying.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #2
dialog: No you're not.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Yes we are.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #2
dialog: No you're not!
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Yes we are.
dialog: 10.
text: Doctor #2 grabs the Nicorette pack, savagely rips loose a
text: piece of gum and shoves it in his mouth.
text: Doctor #3, supremely bored now, uses his stethoscope to
text: listen to his own heartbeat.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Perhaps we should get another opinion.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #3
dialog: Oh, let me do this one! Please?
text: Doctor #1 nods. Doctor #3 sits up, clears his throat.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #3 (CONT'D)
dialog: From the moment we're born, we all begin
dialog: to die. Sooner or later, beggar or king,
dialog: death comes to all.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #1
dialog: That will do, Doctor.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #3
dialog: But it's true.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #2
dialog: Where'd you get your degree?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #1
dialog: Disability request denied. It's back to
dialog: work for you, Mr. Leth.
text: Qohen rises to leave, defeated. Doctor #1 takes off her
text: glasses, studying him.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #1 (CONT'D)
dialog: This board must also recommend that you
dialog: seek psychiatric evaluation.
text: Doctor #2 waves a CD-ROM.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #2
dialog: I saw this coming a mile away.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We've seen psychiatrists in the past.
dialog: It's proven to be a waste of our time.
dialog: We must stay home to wait for our call.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #2
dialog: You'll have time for this one.
text: He slides the CD-ROM down the table. Qohen picks it up. The
scene_heading: cover reads: DR. SHRINK-ROM: INTERACTIVE PSYCHIATRIST.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #2 (CONT'D)
text: She makes house calls.
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: INT. QOHEN'S WORK CUBICLE - LATER
text: Joby stands in Qohen's doorway, arms folded.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Didn't figure the medics would help, but
dialog: Joby's here. I can get Management to see
dialog: you. He'll be at my party tonight.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Party?
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: (sheepishly)
dialog: Guess you missed your invitation. Whole
dialog: office is coming, including Management
dialog: himself. Just show up. I'll take care
dialog: of the rest.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We're afraid we can't.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: What, gotta stay home and shampoo?
text: Joby playfully musses Qohen's hairless head but, seeing his
text: frigid expression, quickly stops.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We fear parties... We especially fear
dialog: living rooms at parties... We never know
dialog: quite... where to stand.
text: Joby stares, then suddenly LAUGHS, slapping him on the back.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: You kill me, Quinn. See you tonight.
text: Joby leaves. Qohen takes a deep breath to calm himself.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: It's Qohen.
scene_heading: INT. JOBY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Qohen uncomfortably plods his way through a room crowded with
text: CO-WORKERS. He is lost amid the LAUGHTER AND CONVERSATION.
text: He passes a couple of CO-WORKERS who eye him derisively.
speaker_heading: CO-WORKER #1
dialog: Who's the geeky goth?
speaker_heading: CO-WORKER #2
text: Cube zombie. Some kind of Einstein.
dialog: 12.
text: Qohen bumps into BAINSLEY, 20s, wearing a loudly-patterned
text: dress her buxom figure seems to be bursting out of.
text: Qohen steps to his right just as Bainsley steps to her left.
text: She steps to her left just as Qohen shifts to his right.
text: Bainsley GIGGLES, still blocking his way.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: I love the look. Fifty-first century
text: human, the final evolutionary product.
text: Maximum brain, minimalist body.
text: Qohen stares at her, then clumsily makes his way past her.
text: Qohen finds Joby, obviously tipsy, laughing with a crowd.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Party boy! You made it!
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Is Management here?
text: The group looks at Qohen strangely. Joby LAUGHS
text: uncomfortably, takes Qohen's arm, and moves him away.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: You wanna start a rumor riot?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Where is Management?
speaker_heading: JOBY
text: Probably on his way. Soon as I spot him,
dialog: I'll let you know. Meantime...
text: Joby slaps Qohen on the back. Qohen flinches.
speaker_heading: JOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: Lighten up, have a little fun for a
dialog: change. Mingle, Quinn, mingle!
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: It's Qohen.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Of course it is.
text: Joby gives Qohen a push on his way.
text: As Qohen looks for a place to retreat from the party crush,
text: NOISES FADE. He enters a quiet corner of the room.
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: DIMLY-LIT CORNER
text: Two wing-back chairs flank a table with a reading lamp.
text: In the furthest chair sits MANAGEMENT, dressed in the same
text: taupe suit featured in the poster in Qohen's office, a suit
text: that, chameleon-like, matches the color of the chair. He
text: blends in so well that, at first, Qohen doesn't even see him.
text: But when he does, Qohen stops, takes a step back.
text: Management holds a book at eye level. With his other hand,
text: he balances a teacup and saucer on his knee. Apparently
text: engrossed in his reading, Management lifts the teacup, takes
text: a delicate sip, and returns the cup carefully to its saucer.
text: Qohen quietly turns to leave.
speaker_heading: MANAGEMENT
dialog: I take it you're not happy, Mr. Leth.
text: Qohen hesitates, startled.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Do we... know you?
text: Still not looking at Qohen, Management turns a page.
speaker_heading: MANAGEMENT
dialog: I know you, Mr. Leth. Sit.
text: Qohen grimaces in the direction of the party, then nervously
text: perches on the edge of the empty chair.
text: Management sips from his teacup, eyes riveted on the page.
speaker_heading: MANAGEMENT (CONT'D)
dialog: What seems to be the problem?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We... We simply want to go home.
text: Qohen notices Management's bland disinterest.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: We could easily double our output there.
text: Management turns another page.
text: Qohen drums his fingers on his knees.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Our chief concern is that we might miss
dialog: our call... You see, we have been waiting
dialog: for a certain call all our lives now...
dialog: 14.
text: Management stops reading, slowly looks up from his book.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: .+-and although the nature and origin of
dialog: our call remain quintessentially a
dialog: mystery to us, we can't help but hope it
dialog: will provide us with a purpose we've long
dialog: lived without.
text: Management studies Qohen for a moment, then blinks and
text: returns his attention to his book.
speaker_heading: MANAGEMENT
dialog: You're quite insane, Mr. Leth.
text: Qohen stands, cowed by Management's bland disinterest.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We're sorry to have disturbed you.
text: He turns and flees to the...
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: Bainsley hovers over a tray of hors d'oeuvres, stuffing her
text: face. She spies Qohen making for the door.
text: Suddenly a drunken Joby snags Qohen.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Quinn, you chrome-domed bastard! Where
dialog: are you going? Have a drink! Eat!
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We saw him.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Management.
text: People nearby overhear and turn to stare quizzically. Joby
text: makes a show of LAUGHING skeptically.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Better watch the cocktails, Quinn!
text: (pulling him aside, whispering)
dialog: Are you crazy? Management parties
dialog: incognito!
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: This isn't working, Mr. Joby.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: No shit! You're blowing his cover!
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We're afraid we must go now.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Wait. I'll get you a meeting with him.
text: Joby steers Qohen to the buffet table.
speaker_heading: JOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: You're not leaving without eating, Quinn!
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: It's Qohen. We've apparently had our
dialog: meeting. And our diet dictates against
dialog: all foods with perceptible flavor.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Eat. That's an order.
text: Qohen surveys the food tray grimly. He SIGHS, selects an
text: olive, and tucks it into his mouth, frowning.
speaker_heading: JOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: Plenty of eats!
text: Joby slaps Qohen on the back.
text: Qohen GULPS, lodging the olive deep in his throat.
speaker_heading: JOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Plenty more! Plenty for everybody!
text: Joby moves off, drunkenly glad-handing other guests.
text: Qohen stumbles away, struggling for breath.
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
text: Away from the crowd, Qohen falls against the wall, panic-
text: stricken. He pounds his chest, trying to free the olive.
text: He lurches to an open doorway.
speaker_heading: STUDY
text: As if by magic, Management sits behind a mahogany desk
text: reading his book and sipping his tea. His eyes move from the
text: book to Qohen with an expression of mild amusement.
speaker_heading: MANAGEMENT
dialog: What is the meaning of life, Mr. Leth?
text: Qohen clutches his throat, eyes bulging.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: MANAGEMENT (CONT'D)
text: So close to its end, and still no answer.
text: Management closes his book.
speaker_heading: MANAGEMENT (CONT'D)
dialog: I have a special project for you that
dialog: might prove to be mutually beneficial.
text: The room blurs.
speaker_heading: MANAGEMENT (CONT'D)
dialog: But there's not much time, Mr. Leth. Not
dialog: much time at all...
text: Qohen's knees buckle...
text: And then he is suddenly lifted off his feet from behind and
dialog: dragged back into the...
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
text: Bainsley performs the Heimlich maneuver on Qohen. She loses
text: her balance, stumbles down the narrow corridor with him. She
text: hangs on fiercely, heaving him off his feet again and again.
text: The olive SHOOTS from his mouth, ricochets off the wall and
text: rolls to a stop by the baseboard. Instantly a scruffy rodent
text: appears, grabs the olive and disappears back into the wall.
text: Bainsley releases her hold. Qohen gasps for breath.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: I thought I smelled trouble.
text: The neckline of Bainsley's dress is tugged low. She blithely
text: plumps her breasts while rearranging her clothing.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Everybody hates to make a scene, but the
dialog: worst thing you can do is go off by
dialog: yourself. Embarrassment's the number one
dialog: cause of choking deaths.
text: Qohen stares into her eyes, speechless. He suddenly beelines
text: for the bathroom. Closes the door. Locks it.
speaker_heading: BATHROOM
text: Qohen splashes water on his face. He stares at himself in
text: the mirror. He reaches to touch his reflection... then
text: staggers backward with a look of pain.
text: He sits on the toilet seat, face buried in his hands.
text: A loud KNOCK at the door. Qohen jumps to his feet, startled.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (V.O.)
dialog: Still alive in there?
text: Qohen quickly dries his face and opens the door. Bainsley
text: squeezes past him, hands him her wine glass.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold this.
text: She heads for the toilet, hiking her dress to the top of her
text: thighs. Qohen stares. Bainsley smiles...
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Care to join me?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Excuse us?
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: (winking)
dialog: Close the door... I won't be long.
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
text: Qohen closes the door and stands uncomfortably, wine in hand.
text: He sniffs it distastefully, then eases to the study.
speaker_heading: STUDY

speaker_heading: HALLWAY
text: Qohen stands obediently outside the bathroom door.
text: The toilet FLUSHES. The faucet RUNS.
text: The door opens. Bainsley exits, smoothing her dress. She
text: flashes Qohen a sexy smile, takes the wine glass from him.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: So I saved your life. No big deal?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Forgive our ambivalence. Thank you.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: You owe me. I'm Bainsley.
text: She takes his hand in hers, looks him up and down.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: And you are...?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Qohen. Q--no U--
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: You work with these people?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
text: In a manner of speaking.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: What do you do?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We crunch entities.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: You got a mouse in your pocket?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Excuse us?
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Who's "we"?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Us. Ourselves.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Catchy.
text: She tugs at her dress as if uncomfortable with its fit.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: You're staring at me. You think my dress
dialog: is incredibly ugly.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We -- we really should be going --
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: It's my daddy's fault. He used to buy me
dialog: these incredibly ugly clothes to keep the
dialog: boys away. Didn't work. Only made me
dialog: want to get naked, and that's no way to
dialog: keep the boys away. So I never developed
dialog: a fashion sense. Are you on drugs?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Have you tried them?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We have tried many pharmaceuticals, both
dialog: therapeutic and recreational, but we've
dialog: discovered none with sufficient potency
dialog: to treat our essential condition.
dialog: She leans
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: I hear you. You should try natural
dialog: herbs. I'm happy with the herbs. Way
dialog: happy. They should put St. John's Wort
text: in the drinking water, like fluoride...
text: close and rests an elbow on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: ...Are you here alone?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We are generally everywhere alone.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: The "we" thing: royal or plural?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Generic.
text: She trails her fingernails over the skin of his scalp.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Love it. You're the enigmatic workaholic
dialog: technogeek. I'm the mysterious party-
dialog: girl. My place or yours?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We'd only disappoint you.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Best line I've heard all night.
text: Her lips move close to his. Qohen pulls back, flustered.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We can't imagine your interest in us.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: I saved your life. That's a turn-on.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We really must be leaving.
text: Bainsley touches a finger to his lips.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Seriously. We could have some fun.
text: She caresses his chest, pulls a felt-tip pen from his pocket,
text: and scrawls her name and number on the palm of his hand.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Call me.
text: Qohen stares at his hand.
dialog: 20.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Qohen scrubs his hand in scalding water. He looks at himself
text: in the mirror. Steam obscures his reflection.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DAY
text: Gulls SCREECH. The surf CRASHES and ROARS.
text: Young Qohen is buried in the sand up to his neck.
text: His Wife tamps the sand down, LAUGHING, while his Son
text: decorates the mound with seashells. Qohen struggles gamely
text: to free himself, grinning with red-faced delight.
text: Then his face goes slack, and he stares straight out at his
text: inevitable future with a mixture of fear and revulsion...
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - SHRINE - NIGHT
text: Qohen studies the photo. He traces Young Qohen's smile with
text: his finger, then turns the picture's face to the wall.
scene_heading: INT. CUBICLE HALLWAY - DAY
text: Joby leads Qohen past a maze of cubicles. Sounds of TYPING,
text: CONVERSATION, phones RINGING. Qohen hastens to keep up.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Be careful what you wish for, Quinn.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: What's this all about?
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: You're going home. Management assigned
dialog: you to the Zero Theorem Project. He's
dialog: been hand-picking talent to crunch it
dialog: since before I was hired. So far, no
dialog: luck. The Clones are at your place right
dialog: now setting up your hardware.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Clones?
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Research and Development techies.
dialog: They already changed the locks. Not to
dialog: worry. You'll get a key.
text: They reach a door labelled "MANCOM". Joby unlocks it.
speaker_heading: JOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I got my money on you, Quinn. Some big,
dialog: bad entities to crunch, but I'm sure
dialog: you'll be proving the theorem in no time.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: What exactly will we be proving?
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Don't ask. It's all very hush-hush...
text: Joby opens the door, releasing a cold fog.
scene_heading: INT. MANCOM MAINFRAME - CONTINUOUS
text: A cavernous room filled with blinking banks of HUMMING,
text: ceiling-high computers. Qohen can see his breath.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: .+. But just between you and me... You
dialog: solve Zip-T, I bet Management helps you
dialog: get you that call of yours.
text: Qohen stops -- surprised, hopeful.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: He can do that? But how?
text: Joby tugs Qohen's sleeve, pulls him forward.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Management works in mysterious ways,
dialog: Quinn.
text: As they walk down an aisle, a faint CLICKING grows louder.
speaker_heading: JOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is ManCom, biggest neural net
dialog: computer in the world. Learns just like
text: a human, trial and error, but a hell of a
dialog: lot faster. Already the smartest thing
dialog: on the planet... and still learning!
text: They turn a corner.
text: BOB, 15 -- frail, anemic, baggy-eyed -- sits at the control
text: console rapidly CLICKING a mouse. He's bundled in heavy
text: jacket, hooded sweatshirt, scarf and fingerless gloves.
text: A row of monitors flash dizzying images, a fast-changing
text: encyclopedic array of charts, pictures, and geometric code.
speaker_heading: JOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Working hard, Bob?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (without looking up)
dialog: Hardly working, Bob. Still teaching this
dialog: stupid motherfucker... Excuse my French.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Don't mind me. I'm just getting Quinn
dialog: here started on Zip-T.
text: Bob pulls off his hood to reveal a ratty pony tail. He gives
text: Qohen a sideways glance.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I give him two weeks.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: To complete the project?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (rolling eyes)
dialog: Till you crash and burn, Bob.
text: Joby pulls Qohen past Bob, turning another corner.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: That was Bob.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: But he called you Bob. He called us Bob.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Bob calls everybody Bob. Says it's a
dialog: waste of brain cells remembering names.
speaker_heading: QOHEN ;
dialog: Isn't he rather young to be working here?
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Kid could program before he could walk.
text: They reach a row of file cabinets. Joby opens a drawer,
text: pulls out a stack of CD-ROMs, piles them into Qohen's hands.
speaker_heading: JOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Crunch this stuff for starters. Upload
dialog: ASAP. ManCom will send you new downloads
dialog: every day. Miss a deadline, you're off
dialog: the project. How's that for pressure?
text: Joby gives him more disks. Overwhelmed, Qohen struggles to
text: keep from dropping them. Joby reaches into the drawer again.
speaker_heading: JOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't worry, Quinn. You got what you
dialog: wanted. Everything's under control.
text: Joby holds up the last disk, stares through its hole.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: JOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: You ever get the feeling the whole
dialog: universe is a big fat cosmic joke... and
dialog: maybe you're the punch line...? You ever
dialog: get that feeling, Quinn?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: It's Qohen.
text: Joby tucks the final disk into Qohen's shirt pocket.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Uh-huh... That's what I figured.

text: 6. Monitor showing file upload in progress.
text: 7. Qohen at his BATHROOM mirror rubbing baggy eyes.

text: 11. A framed photo of Qohen's Wife and Son walking hand in

text: life, and Wife and Son look out, startled and saddened.
text: 12. Qohen stares at the photo, eyes moistening. He turns
text: and walks out of the alcove to his computer, raising his eyes
text: to the crucifix. Mounted where Jesus' head should be, a

dialog: 24.
text: Qohen's monitor: DR. SHRINK-ROM, 50s, an interactive CD-ROM
text: therapist. Warm and caring, she sits in a great leather
text: chair, notebook in hand, pen poised.
scene_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM
dialog: You seem tense, Qohen. Perhaps you'd
dialog: like to start over. Let's return to the
dialog: subject of your fears.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We fear...
dialog: (deep breath)
dialog: Nothing.
scene_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We're afraid we can't.
scene_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM
dialog: Of course you can. Let's explore this
dialog: contradiction. You say you fear nothing,
dialog: but in previous sessions...
text: A notebook window pops up next to Dr. Shrink-ROM, showing the
text: bulleted list she reads from.
speaker_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM (CONT'D)
dialog: ...you've reported fear of death, fear of
dialog: life, fear of open spaces, fear of closed
dialog: spaces, fear of people, fear of missing a
dialog: certain phone call, fear of --
text: Qohen moves his cursor to close the notebook window.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We fear many things, but ultimately we
dialog: fear nothing more than anything.
scene_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM
dialog: Noted. Please go on.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: In what manner, Doctor?
scene_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM
dialog: Are you trying to be difficult?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Not at all... It seems we're capable of
dialog: being difficult without trying.
scene_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM
dialog: Perhaps you'd like to start over. We've
dialog: spoken of your fears. Would you care to
dialog: discuss your joys?
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: At present, we can think of very little
dialog: that brings us joy.
scene_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Your wife and son were a source of joy.
dialog: Weren't they, Qohen?
text: Qohen's eyes cloud.
speaker_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM (CONT'D)
dialog: Why don't you ever talk about them?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: What good is joy when it doesn't last?
dialog: We haven't felt joy in years.
scene_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM
dialog: Tell me what you're feeling, Qohen.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We feel... nothing.
scene_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM
dialog: You're a tough nut to crack, Qohen... and
dialog: of course I don't mean "nut" in the
dialog: pejorative sense... Perhaps you'd like
dialog: to start over. Let's return to --
text: The phone RINGS, interrupting. Qohen looks at it with a
text: mixture of hope and despair. He picks it up.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: COMPUTERIZED VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Hello... Qohen Leth... Your next
dialog: installment of data is due for upload in
dialog: one hour. If the target timetable is

text: Qohen presses 2, interrupting the voice.
speaker_heading: COMPUTERIZED VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Please enter estimated number of minutes

speaker_heading: COMPUTERIZED VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: A moment, please... ManCom will allow 70
dialog: minutes. Goodbye... Qohen Leth.
speaker_heading: QOHEN .
dialog: That's not enough time!
dialog: 26.
text: The line has gone dead. Qohen hangs up.
scene_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM
dialog: Perhaps you should get back to work.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: What difference does it make? We'll
text: never finish. ManCom sends new downloads
dialog: before we've finished with the old ones.
dialog: We've never worked with data like this.
dialog: It refuses to stay crunched!
scene_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM
dialog: Deep breaths, Qohen, deep breaths...
text: Qohen stares up at the crucifix. ManCam's red light shines.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: All we want is our call...
scene_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM
dialog: Yes... Your call... Let's continue our
dialog: discussion next session. I find your
dialog: feelings fascinating and look forward --
text: Qohen clicks on exit, and Dr. Shrink-ROM vanishes.
text: He types a command, and a menu bar reads: ZERO THEOREM
text: PROJECT. A stream of signs and symbols scroll.
text: With a pained expression he goes to work.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - NIGHT
text: Qohen at his computer, feverishly typing. A STORM rages
text: outside, and his driven eyes are lit by LIGHTNING FLASHES.
text: He stops typing, freezing the scrolling signs and symbols.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: This can't be right...
text: Qohen types a command, and the entities begin scrolling in
text: reverse. He slows the stream of symbols, stops.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Nothing adds up...
text: He resumes his typing, the symbols scrolling faster and
text: faster as he works himself into a frenzied pace.
text: Suddenly, LIGHTNING FLASHES and the PHONE RINGS.
text: With a cry of pain, Qohen snatches up the receiver.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello! Hello!
speaker_heading: COMPUTERIZED VOICE (V.O.)
text: Qohen Leth... Data is overdue for upload.
dialog: Please enter estimated number of minutes
dialog: needed for target overrun.
text: Qohen savagely punches numbers.
speaker_heading: COMPUTERIZED VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: That time frame is not authorized...
dialog: Please enter estimated number...
text: Qohen drops the phone. The message repeats itself. Symbols
text: scroll in a dizzying blur.
text: Qohen stares at the monitor in despair...
text: Then his eyes narrow in anger...
text: He opens a file drawer, rummages through it wildly, and pulls
text: out a ball-peen hammer. He looks at it, eyes full of doubt.
text: He hesitates a moment, then -- decided -- lifts it high.
text: Dr. Shrink-ROM suddenly pops up on the monitor.
scene_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM
text: Deep breaths, Qohen. Perhaps a mild
dialog: sedative is in order. I can arrange --
text: Qohen SMASHES the monitor, shorting out Dr. Shrink-ROM.
text: The storm looses a LIGHTNING BOLT.
text: Qohen turns the hammer to the phone. SMASH!
text: Qohen looks around wildly. His gaze moves to the shrine and
text: lingers a moment. He lifts his eyes to the crucifix ManCam.
text: He raises the hammer. A look of despair crosses his face.
text: All is quiet... except the distant RUMBLE of thunder and the
text: soft PATTER of rain on the roof. The storm has passed.
text: Qohen lets the hammer drop to the floor.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - DAY
text: Qohen lies on his bed, his expression blank.
text: The intercom BUZZES repeatedly. Qohen slowly rises, walks to
text: the door, and presses the intercom.
speaker_heading: ves? QOHEN
dialog: es?
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Phoneman. Management says you got a
dialog: problem. Let me in, buddy.
text: Qohen buzzes the street door open.
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER
text: QOHEN opens his door to a white jump-suited Joby, who wheels
text: in a hefty duffel bag and throws an arm around Qohen.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Quinn! Long time no hug!
text: Qohen goes rigid, awkwardly backs away.
speaker_heading: JOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Still dying, I see.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Field work. I love it. Gets me out of
text: the office and into a snappy uniform.
text: Qohen follows Joby to the work station. CHUCKLING, Joby
text: genuflects before the crucifix. He rises, looks around.
speaker_heading: JOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: You could use a woman's touch, Quinn.
text: Qohen closes his eyes, jaw clenched.
speaker_heading: JOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: ManCom can't reach you. What's up?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: At present, we are having difficulty
dialog: maintaining our upload schedule. Our
text: entities are acting strangely...
text: Joby pokes at the broken monitor, eyebrows raised.
speaker_heading: JOBY
text: Personnel meltdown. Seen plenty of it.
dialog: Me, I'd yank you and go to the bullpen.
text: Joby glances at the shattered phone, then picks up the ball-
text: peen hammer from the floor, shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: But Management's giving you another
dialog: chance. Don't ask me why.
text: Qohen takes the hammer from him, puts it in a file drawer.
dialog: 29.
text: Joby shrugs, pulls a new phone from his duffel bag.
speaker_heading: JOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: It's all about connections, Quinn. Wires
text: and wireless weaving a world wide web.
dialog: Can't do anything if you're disconnected.
text: He plugs in the phone, then pulls a new monitor from his
text: duffel bag. He wipes imaginary sweat from his brow.
speaker_heading: JOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoa. Manual labor makes me parched.
dialog: Got a spare beer for a working man?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We have tap water.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Yum.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - LATER
text: Joby guzzles a tepid glass of water, BURPS.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: I've missed you, Quinn. A supervisor
dialog: doesn't make many friends, you know.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: You consider us a friend?
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Sure do.
dialog: (conspiratorially)
dialog: So tell me, what's the real problem?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: The Zero Theorem is unprovable. We're
dialog: dying. We haven't received our call.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: You don't trust Management.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Nothing adds up.
speaker_heading: JOBY
text: Or maybe everything adds up to nothing.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: What do you mean?
text: Joby slaps Qohen on the back, making him jump.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Poor bastard. All stressed out... I
dialog: know someone in the decompression
dialog: business who might be able to help.
dialog: Might even help you get that call of
dialog: yours... Who knows? Let me see what I
dialog: can do, Quinn.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
scene_heading: It's Qohen. Q--no U--O-H --
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: No need to spell it out. Joby's here.
scene_heading: THE BLACK HOLE
text: Light swirls violently around the inky blackness.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - DOOR - DAY
text: Qohen presses the intercom.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Troubleshooter. Buzz me in, babe.
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 30.
dialog: The
dialog: head.
text: Qohen opens the door, revealing BAINSLEY. Dressed all in
text: white with plunging neckline and short skirt, she looks like
text: a nurse outfitted by Frederick's of Hollywood.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Surprise.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: «+. You... You're... Bainsley...?
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: You never called. I waited forever!
speaker_heading: QOHEN
text: She steps in, inspecting Qohen closely.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: You look awful, poor thing. Joby's
dialog: right. You need me.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Mr. Joby sent you...?
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Joby doesn't send me anywhere.
dialog: (pausing, looking around)
dialog: We're just neighbors.
text: She walks up the aisle in wonder. Qohen follows.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't believe you live in a church.
dialog: How otherworldly. I feel so... holy!
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: It's a chapel, actually.
text: Bainsley turns to him, grasping his arm.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: (singing off-key)
dialog: Go-ing to the chap-el of loooove...
text: She marches him up the aisle, clutching his arm.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: We prefer not to be touched.
text: Bainsley makes no move to turn him loose.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: The rent must be outrageous.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Actually, we own the building. We bought
dialog: it from an insurance company. There'd
dialog: been extensive... fire damage...
text: Qohen glances toward the shrine, troubled.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: The previous occupants were an order of
dialog: gnostic monks who'd sworn vows of
dialog: poverty, chastity, and silence...
dialog: Apparently... No one broke his vow to
text: yell, "Fire".
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Holy frying friars!
text: They reach the work station, but Bainsley pulls Qohen to the
text: bed. She places a hand on his chest and pushes him backward.
dialog: 32.
text: Qohen plops on the mattress. Smiling coyly, Bainsley leans
text: over him, fingernails grazing his bald head.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: You have the most intriguing bone
dialog: structure, so polished, so pure...
text: Qohen opens his mouth to speak, but Bainsley puts a finger to
text: his lips. She spins around and strides to the computer.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Mighty big hard drive you got here...
text: She sits in front of the computer, begins typing.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Mr. Joby seemed to think you might help
dialog: us get our call.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Yeah, he mentioned the call thing...
dialog: (without looking)
dialog: You're staring at me.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We're terribly sorry.
text: Bainsley squints at the screen, typing rapidly.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: This is the goopiest software I've ever
dialog: seen. But your hardware's dreamy. I can
dialog: definitely work with your hardware.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Our problem is not with our computer.
text: Bainsley suddenly SQUEALS, swiveling away from the computer.
text: She sucks on her middle finger, teary-eyed.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: I just broke a nail on your big, fat,
dialog: stupid keyboard!
text: Qohen jumps up and goes to her.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We'll get our first aid kit.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: (pouting)
dialog: Could you please just kiss it?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Excuse us?
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Whenever I hurt myself, my daddy would
dialog: kiss it and make it all better.
text: Qohen stands wringing his hands.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We fail to see how --
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Please...?
text: Qohen hesitates, then bends to place a hasty kiss on the tip
text: of her outstretched finger.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: You call that a kiss?
text: Bainsley takes his hand, slowly sucks his middle finger into
text: her mouth. Her lips slide down and up, lingering on the
text: fingertip in a soft kiss. Her eyes dance with mischief.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: There... all better...?
text: Puzzled, paralyzed, pitiful, Qohen stares into her eyes.
text: Dr. Shrink-ROM pops onto the computer.
scene_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM
dialog: I realize I'm not authorized to present
dialog: an opinion, but I couldn't help noticing
dialog: this woman's attempt to project issues of
dialog: paternal abandonment onto you. Given the
dialog: age difference between the two of you, as
dialog: your psychiatrist, I must warn you --
text: Bainsley grabs the mouse, clicks on exit. Dr. Shrink-ROM
text: vanishes.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Nosy bitch. My daddy didn't abandon me.
dialog: He died.
text: Qohen opens his mouth as if to speak...
text: Bainsley touches his cheek.
text: Qohen stares into her eyes a moment... then draws away,
text: breaking the spell. He turns his back to her.
text: Bainsley rises, wanders toward the shrine, gazing about.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I can help you, Qohen... but you're going
dialog: to be a challenge...
dialog: 34.
text: She reaches for one of the pictures, goes to flip it forward.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Who's your interior decorator?
text: Qohen snaps to attention, rushes toward her.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Don't! Don't touch those!
text: Qohen pulls her away. The picture falls face-down on the
text: floor, glass CRACKING. Qohen quickly picks it up, carefully
text: re-hangs it, face to the wall. He breathes heavily.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: I prefer not to be manhandled.
text: Regaining control, Qohen turns to her.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We didn't mean to hurt you.
text: Bainsley rubs her arm.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: In case you got the wrong idea, I should
dialog: tell you I don't do sexual intercourse
dialog: any more. I don't care if a guy wraps
text: himself up like a latex mummy, nothing's
dialog: going inside me. Way too dangerous.
text: She shrugs it off, smiling slowly.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm into bioteletantric interfacing now.
dialog: It's smart and safe and -- oh my God! --
dialog: it feels so super-tingly!
text: She spins away on a spiked heel, short dress flaring.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Got anything to eat around here? I'm
dialog: starving my butt off.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - LATER
text: Bainsley perches prettily on the counter, feet dangling,
text: devouring a microwaved meal. Qohen leans against the sink,
text: watching her. She licks her fingers, mouth full.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: How can you stand this stuff?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We've grown accustomed to it.
text: She stops chewing, swallows.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: You're staring at me again.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: (looking away)
dialog: Forgive us.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: You're forgiven already.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: In our experience, forgiveness doesn't
dialog: come so easily.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: What kind of guilt trip are you on?
text: Qohen doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Here you are, locked up all alone...
dialog: waiting... for what? A phone call?
dialog: What's that all about?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We prefer not to speak of it. Our past
dialog: is... painful...
text: Bainsley hops down from the counter.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Who's isn't?
text: She touches his arm. Qohen flinches. She strokes his tense
text: neck, Qohen visibly uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm here to help, Qohen. Trust me.
dialog: Confession's good for the soul.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Assuming we have a soul...
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Everybody has a soul.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: That remains to be proven.
text: Bainsley draws away, studying him.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: So I saved your life for nothing...?
text: Qohen wilts with guilt.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, Qohen. How can I help if you
dialog: won't tell me anything?
text: Qohen meets her eyes then looks away. He takes a deep
dialog: breath.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We... we can't tell you.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Why not?
text: Qohen looks away, embarrassed.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: You're staring at us...
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER
text: Bainsley pokes through cupboards and drawers, trying her best
dialog: not to look at Qohen.
text: Qohen stands in the middle of the kitchen, eyes closed, hands
text: clasped nervously. His voice is low, on the edge of
dialog: breaking.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We suffered... a great loss... and we
dialog: struggled for a long time to understand
dialog: the reason for it... the reason we were
dialog: chosen, if chosen we were, to go on
dialog: living with this misfortune... We came
dialog: to this place... It seemed to suit us...
dialog: We stopped eating. We dulled our pain
dialog: with drink and drugs. We lost all
dialog: hope... We came to this place to die...
text: Qohen's face glows with a tortured fervor.
text: Bainsley glances at him. Her eyes fill with tears.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: One night a storm struck. We lost power.
text: We lit candles. And in the flickering
dialog: shadows, we decided to end our lives. We
dialog: ingested every drug we could find...
text: Bainsley stands at the sink, turning the water on and off.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Then the phone rang... We answered... A
dialog: voice said, "Qohen Leth," and suddenly we
dialog: felt a flash of light... We felt... a
dialog: current of pure energy connecting us to
dialog: something... something greater...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: We suddenly knew clearly that we only had
dialog: to answer, say "Yes," and the voice would
dialog: reveal the purpose behind our loss...
dialog: would give us a reason to go on...
text: Bainsley turns from the sink.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: .--And then...?
text: Qohen opens his eyes. His gaze is bland, lifeless.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
text: We awoke in a hospital emergency room.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: And you've been waiting for a callback
dialog: ever since?
text: Qohen nods.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: What kind of drugs did you take?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: You think we're insane.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: It could've been somebody selling time
dialog: shares... I mean... Life goes on, Qohen.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: So it would appear. The question is...
dialog: to what end...? And we doubt you can
dialog: help us in providing an answer.
text: Bainsley goes to him. She worries the buttons on his shirt,
text: head lowered. She raises her eyes.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: I can try... Let me try.
text: Gently, Qohen pulls her hands from his shirt.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We told you. We prefer not to be
dialog: touched.
text: Bainsley bites her lip.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: I can get around that...
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - LATER
text: Lying scattered about the work station: open boxes, computer
text: parts, accessories and cables.
dialog: 38.
text: Bainsley models a VIRTUAL REALITY SUIT, a tight, translucent,
text: shimmering red sheath that covers her from head to toe.
text: She pirouettes seductively, showing all her curves. Sequin-
text: like transistors sparkle all over. A braid of wires hangs
text: from her hood down her back, ending in a computer jack.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: This thing is years ahead of the
dialog: competition. It works on all the nerve
dialog: endings, of course, plus it's synched
text: directly to the brain's synapses.
text: She pulls off the hood, shaking her hair free.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you think? Joby said it's based
dialog: on one of your projects.
text: Qohen sits stiffly on his bed, staring doubtfully.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We never imagined our projects actually
dialog: had any purpose.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Don't put it on your resume yet. Top
dialog: secret. I'm the cyberspace test pilot.
text: She pulls an identical and incredibly tiny-looking suit from
text: a box, drapes it across Qohen's lap.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: For you.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We're supposed to wear this?
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: One size fits all.
text: She strokes his head.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I can help you, Qohen. Trust me.
text: She turns, suddenly efficient, and marches for the door.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I bookmarked my website for you. Just
dialog: put on the suit, plug in, and click on me
dialog: at midnight.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: You're going out dressed like that?
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
text: They can look but they can't touch.
dialog: (blowing him a kiss)
dialog: Oh! I can't wait! Don't be late!
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Qohen stands before the mirror, wearing the virtual reality
text: suit. He tugs uncomfortably at the crotch.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: (muttering)
dialog: One size does not fit all.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - LATER
text: Suited up, with braid of wires connected to his computer,
text: Qohen sits before his monitor. Bainsley's website features a
text: picture of lingerie-clad Bainsley and the words "ENTER ME!"
text: Qohen moves his cursor to "ENTER".
text: DR. SHRINK-ROM pops up on the screen, her face troubled.
scene_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM
dialog: Don't, Qohen.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Don't what?
scene_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM
dialog: Don't use this girl.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We have no intentions of --
scene_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: You've built a wall around yourself. Is
dialog: she prepared for what she'll find inside?
text: Qohen slowly removes his hood.
speaker_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM (CONT'D)
dialog: She's an emotionally damaged girl. You
dialog: are emotionally bereft. Listen, Qohen...
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: This interruption is unacceptable. We
dialog: insist you run a scan on your program.
text: Dr. Shrink-ROM frowns, nods slowly. Her movements run in
text: reverse for a moment -- RESET -- then snap back to normal.
scene_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM
dialog: So sorry. The glitch is fixed. Don't
dialog: mind me. Carry on, Qohen.
dialog: 40.
text: Dr. Shrink-ROM disappears.
text: Qohen stares, perplexed. Bainsley's sexy image awaits.
text: Qohen hesitates, then pulls down the hood, clicks on "ENTER".
scene_heading: EXT. TROPICAL ISLAND - BEACH - SUNSET
text: Swaying palm trees reach for a deep blue sky above.
text: Wearing swimming trunks, Qohen lies on a blanket spread over
text: the sand. He gazes skyward, puts a hand to his head to
dialog: discover... a full head of hair!
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Like it?
text: Bainsley kneels beside him, wearing a skimpy bikini.
text: They lie on a beach, ocean before them, lush jungle behind
text: them. The sun sets, the horizon awash with color.
text: Bainsley pulls food from a picnic basket -- stone crab,
text: chilled asparagus spears, a loaf of bread -- arranging it on
text: the blanket. Champagne chills in a bucket beside her.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I made it just for you -- the hair.
dialog: Something special for a special guy.
text: Qohen runs his hands through his hair, eyes distant.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We're not sure it's quite... us.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Don't be silly.
text: Bainsley hands the bottle of champagne to Qohen.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Actually, we don't drink any longer.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: You can do anything you want here. You
dialog: can drink and never get drunk. You can
dialog: eat and never get full.
text: She picks up a crab claw, produces a ball-peen hammer...
text: Qohen flinches as she SMASHES the claw open.
text: She pulls a huge chunk of crab from the shell, takes a
text: savage, giggling bite, brings the morsel to Qohen's mouth.
text: Qohen recoils, but Bainsley insists, pressing it to his lips.
dialog: 4l.
text: He takes a tentative nibble and, despite himself... shivers
text: with pleasure. He grabs the rest and fills his mouth.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Good?
text: Qohen looks at her, swallows, regains his reserve.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Where is this place?
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: All in your mind... from my mind. My
dialog: father used to clip pictures from travel
text: magazines and put them on the fridge.
dialog: When he saved up, we were going to take a
dialog: vacation to some exotic tropical island.
text: A fleeting look of sadness crosses Bainsley's face, but she
text: GIGGLES suddenly, and it is gone.
text: She takes Qohen's hand, kisses his fingertips.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you feel this, Qohen?
text: Qohen melts for a moment, then freezes up.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: It's not real.
text: Bainsley sits back.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: It's better than real. You're in your
dialog: computer. I'm in mine. We're connected
dialog: by memory chips and fiber optics. We're
dialog: safe here, Qohen. This is my place.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: But what about our call?
text: Bainsley puts a finger to his lips.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: You worry too much.
text: She takes an asparagus spear, nibbles its tip, eyes dancing.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Trust me, Qohen.
text: Qohen looks at her in wonder.
text: She grabs the champagne and thrusts it in his hands.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's get this party started!
text: Qohen holds the bottle awkwardly. Bainsley guides his hands,
text: kisses him lightly on the lips.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Pop your cork, boyfriend.
text: Qohen looks into her eyes, then, struggling, POPS the cork.
text: Foam bubbles out of the bottle.
text: Bainsley lunges over him to lap at it. She grabs the bottle
text: and pours into his upturned mouth.
text: Bainsley LAUGHING and Qohen SPUTTERING, they roll and wrestle
text: in the sand, champagne pouring all over them...
scene_heading: MONTAGE - JUNGLE, BEACH
text: 1. Qohen and Bainsley walk a jungle path. Bainsley plucks a
text: flower, puts it behind Qohen's ear. He touches her hand.
text: 2. Bainsley climbs a tree, beckoning Qohen to follow. He
text: shakes his head. She showers him with handfuls of leaves,
text: then gives a TARZAN YELL and swings down on a vine, colliding
text: with Qohen and knocking them both tumbling, LAUGHING.
text: 3. Qohen and Bainsley sit at the shore, watching the sunset.
text: Bainsley stands, stretches, wades into the surf. She turns,
text: motions for Qohen to join her. He shakes his head. She
text: folds her arms sternly. He shakes his head again. She
text: splashes him. Qohen stands dripping, then, WHOOPING, dives
text: in, surfacing before her and locking her in an embrace.
scene_heading: END MONTAGE -- STAY IN SCENE
text: They gaze into each other's eyes. She kisses him. He kisses
text: her back. Bainsley takes a breath.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Whoa. Who knew?
text: Qohen holds her, eyes troubled.
text: Bainsley kisses him again, the passion building.
text: Self-consciously, Qohen breaks away, wades out of the water.
text: Bainsley follows him with her eyes, SIGHING.
scene_heading: EXT. TROPICAL ISLAND - BEACH - LATER
text: Qohen and Bainsley, wrapped in a blanket before a campfire.
text: She bites into a tropical fruit. He stares out to sea.
dialog: 43.
text: The sun is still setting into the ocean.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Shouldn't the sun have set by now?
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: I like to keep it this way.
text: Bainsley puts the fruit to Qohen's lips. He takes a bite,
text: chews slowly. Tears well up in his eyes.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We don't deserve this.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Don't deny yourself, Qohen.
text: She grabs his arm excitedly.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey! Want to have some fun? Take us
dialog: someplace else. A place all your own.
dialog: Just imagine it. The virtual program
dialog: will do the rest.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We're not at all certain --
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Oh, you. You're never certain. Come on,
dialog: take a chance. I'm giving you the
dialog: controls, Qohen. Relax, close your eyes.
text: Reluctantly, Qohen reclines, closing his eyes.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Now take us someplace special. Picture
dialog: it in your mind.
text: Qohen's face tenses with effort.
text: Bainsley leans over him, strokes his forehead.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Easy, Qohen. Don't strain your brain...
dialog: Just imagine...
text: Qohen grits his teeth, his expression turning tortured.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: SPACE
text: Bald, naked, and curled tightly in the fetal position, Qohen
text: floats amid a backdrop of brilliant stars. His eyes open
text: wide, staring, as he fights the dread inside him.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Wow! What an imagination!
text: Bainsley, also naked, slowly orbits around Qohen, revelling
dialog: in the freedom of zero gravity.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: And what a dirty mind! Where's my
dialog: bikini, Mr. Leth?
text: Oblivious, Qohen continues to stare past her.
text: Bainsley floats closer, facing him.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong?
text: She reaches for him, draws his rigid body close, then turns
text: her head to follow his gaze.
scene_heading: THE BLACK HOLE
text: A maelstrom of blazing interstellar dust and matter spirals
text: into its black depths, carrying Bainsley and Qohen with it.
text: Bainsley freaks. She hugs Qohen tight, and now they are
text: tumbling end over end.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus, Qohen, stop it! Make it stop!
text: With great effort, Qohen tears his gaze from the spinning,
text: fiery black hole and shuts his eyes tight.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN FLAMES - FLASHBACK
text: Qohen's eyes snap open to a room engulfed by flames.
text: Qohen COUGHS, GASPS, smoke so thick he can barely see.
text: From far away, his Wife's plaintive voice...
speaker_heading: WIFE (0.S.)
dialog: Qohen! Qohen!
dialog: -.. then his Son's...
speaker_heading: SON (0.S.)
dialog: Daddy!
dialog: 45.
text: Burning beams fall all around him.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (V.O.)
dialog: Qohen! Qohen!
text: Qohen stumbles through the smoke and fire, crashes through a
dialog: window...
speaker_heading: WIFE (0.S.)
dialog: Qohen!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - DAY
text: Qohen lands with a whiplash effect, seated before his
text: computer. Trembling, he slowly removes his hood.
text: COMPUTER MONITOR: Error messages flash. Symbols speed to a
text: HUMMING blur. Suddenly -- POP -- the screen goes black
text: Qohen stares at his reflection in the screen, his face in
text: shell-shocked torment. He slowly reaches for the screen.
text: As his finger nears, a static spark CRACKLES. He jerks his
text: hand back, his face turning blank as a zombie's.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - THE DISFIGURED CRUCIFIX - LATER
text: Qohen lies in bed, staring up at the crucifix.
text: Intercom BUZZES. Qohen continues staring.
text: Intercom BUZZES. Qohen blinks. Intercom BUZZES and BUZZES.
text: Qohen rises, makes his way to the door, presses the button.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: BOB (V.O.)
dialog: Bob. Buzz me in.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Bob who?
speaker_heading: BOB (V.O.)
text: Bob who has to take a wicked pee. Buzz
dialog: me in, Scotty.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Our name isn't Scotty.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: BOB (V.O.)
dialog: I know that, Bob.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Our name isn't Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB (V.O.)
dialog: Like I give a shit. Come on, I'm doing
text: the tinkle dance out here.
text: Qohen frowns.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We're afraid our home is not a rest stop.
text: There's a convenience store a block east.
text: Qohen turns away from the intercom, returning to his bed.
speaker_heading: BOB (V.O.)
dialog: They look at you funny unless you buy
dialog: something. Buzz me in, Bob, I'm starting
dialog: to dribble!
text: The intercom BUZZES several more times then falls silent.
text: The sound of RUNNING FOOTSTEPS from the vestibule. Qohen
text: rises from bed just as the deadbolt turns and the door opens.
text: Two acne-scarred young men, SLIM CLONE and CHUBS CLONE, stand
text: in the doorway, dressed in white short-sleeved shirts with
text: bulging pocket protectors, sloppy ties, thick glasses. High-
text: belted trousers show white socks in black wingtips. Hair
text: slicked to the side, frazzled strands sticking up in back.
text: One is fat and the other skinny, but they could be twins.
text: They enter, flank the doorway, look around suspiciously.
text: Suddenly Bob races in. He's dressed in sneakers, untucked T-
text: shirt and long, baggy shorts with huge cargo pockets.
text: Headphones hang around his neck.
text: He rushes up the aisle toward Qohen, face twisted in agony.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Where's your bathroom?!
text: Qohen stands gaping.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Bathroom-bathroom-bathroom!
text: Bob charges through the door to the kitchen. He WHIMPERS.
text: He reappears in the doorway, face desperate.
text: Qohen slowly points the direction.
text: Bob races into the bathroom: the HISS of piss on porcelain.
dialog: 47.
text: Qohen looks at the Clones, bewildered. They walk down the
text: aisle side by side toward him.
text: Bob exits the bathroom, wiping his brow dramatically.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Think I did some renal damage, holding it
dialog: that long. Slim got stuck in traffic.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Chubs drove, Bob.
speaker_heading: CHUBS
dialog: Fast as I could.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Can't tell you Clones apart anyway.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: What... What are you doing here?
text: Bob ignores him, sits at the computer station.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (melodramatically)
dialog: Black screen of death!
text: He raises his hands, fingers spread, and carefully places
text: them on the console, as if performing a Vulcan Mind Meld.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We asked you a perfectly simple --
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Shhh! How'm I supposed to do my job when
dialog: you keep talking?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: What job? What's going on?
text: Bob returns his attention to the screen.
text: Slim approaches Qohen with a clipboard and pen.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Sign here.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Receipt of delivery.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: What delivery?
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: CHUBS
dialog: Management's son. Assigned to help you.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Sign here.
text: Overwhelmed, Qohen signs.
speaker_heading: CHUBS
dialog: We'll pick him up in exactly four hours.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Don't lose him.
text: They turn in unison and walk down the aisle and out the door.
text: Bob rises from his seat at the work station.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I wouldn't mess with the Clones, Bob.
text: They look harmless, but they're the
dialog: toughest geeks in Research and
dialog: Development. They'd just as soon
dialog: vaporize you as look at you.
text: He unpacks computer components from his deep pockets.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: But you're a pretty scary looking guy
dialog: yourself. Promise you won't hurt me.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Of course we won't hurt you.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Not even my feelings, Bob. Promise.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Will you please stop calling us Bob?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What do you want me to call you?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Mr. Leth would suffice.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Mr. Leth... Leth... Nah, too wormy.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
scene_heading: Qohen, then. Q--no U--O-H-E-N.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You gotta buy another vowel, Q.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Q?
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Q'll do. Q is you. Happy now?
text: Qohen's irritation simmers.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: How can you possibly help us?
text: Bob pulls tools from his pocket and opens up a hard drive.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: By getting you off your ass and back to
dialog: work. No more messages from Darth
text: Vader's phone doll.
text: (mimicking COMPUTERIZED VOICE)
dialog: "If the target timetable is attainable,
dialog: yank your crank. If not, kiss my ass."
dialog: No more candy-ass upload schedule.
text: Bob pulls out a fried circuit board, replaces it.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll be your worst nightmare four hours a
dialog: day, seven days a week, for the next four
dialog: weeks. That's all he can spare me. You
dialog: solve Zip-T by then or you're fired.
dialog: Them's the terms from Daddy Dearest.
dialog: He's tired of fucking around.
text: Qohen's face hardens.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: And if we don't agree to those terms?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Then I don't get you your call.
text: Qohen's mouth drops open.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: You? You can get us our call?
text: Bob looks away.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: How the hell do I know? It's my first
dialog: day on the job. All I know is...
text: Bob fires up the computer. A hodgepodge of symbols flash and
text: fizzle, along with ERROR messages.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
text: «+. no Zippidy-T, no ring-a-ding-dingy.
text: Bob types rapidly, the screen changing, re-configuring
text: Suddenly his own image appears on the screen, as recorded by

dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Gotta disable this thing. How can you
dialog: work with the old man gawking at you?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We have nothing to hide.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Right. Keep telling yourself that, Q.
text: Bob types a series of commands. He stops, finger poised
text: above the "Enter" key. He grins up at ManCam, waving. His
text: image waves back on the monitor.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Bob's on the job, Dad...
text: He hits "Enter" and his image disappears. ManCam blinks out.
text: Bob begins typing and clicking at superhuman speed.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Now I gotta clean up your mess... Pop

scene_heading: He COUGHS, SNIFFLES, SNEEZES.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Are you coming down with something?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Usually.
text: Bob wipes his nose on his sleeve, WHEEZING.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: That's it for today. I got your systems
dialog: working, but I still gotta retrieve all
dialog: the Zip-T shit from ManCom. It's gonna
dialog: take a couple days at least.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We're used to waiting.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, I'm not. Where are those bastards?
text: Bob SNEEZES again. He pulls an asthma inhaler from
text: pocket, takes a quick blast.
text: The deadbolt clicks, the door opens, and the Clones
text: Bob whirls, eyes fiery, and strides down the aisle.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: You're late!
text: Chubs and Slim check their watches.
speaker_heading: CHUBS
dialog: Um. Bob. We're right on time.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No excuses. Don't let it happen again.
dialog: (to Qohen)
dialog: I'll be back. You better be here too.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Where else would we possibly be?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: And by the way. You gotta lose the "we"

speaker_heading: QOHEN

scene_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM
dialog: Don't be such a wuss, Q.

speaker_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM (CONT'D)

dialog: But we won't help you get your call,
dialog: We will not help you, not at all,
dialog: Until you first shed verbal truss,
dialog: First-person plural, Qs-R-Us...

speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We -- can't seem to help ourselves.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Jeez, it's like an audience with the

dialog: this way?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Ever since...
text: Qohen hesitates, glances toward the shrine.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: That's pitiful. You gotta give it up, Q.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: (suddenly stern)
dialog: How did you tamper with Dr. Shrink-ROM?
text: Bob grins, still typing.

speaker_heading: BOB

dialog: Cash or charge?

speaker_heading: PIZZA GIRL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: PIZZA GIRL (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you staring at?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Uh... nothing.
text: She flips her cap brim forward, adjusts her mussed pony tail

speaker_heading: PIZZA GIRL
dialog: (coyly)
dialog: Wrong answer.
text: She leaves. Qohen closes the door and turns to Bob, who

speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Are you all right?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (snapping out of it)
dialog: Whoa! I got this hormonal paradigm shift

speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Puberty's hell... Was she looking at me
dialog: funny?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We've grown accustomed to people looking
dialog: at us funny.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah, but you're funny looking.
text: Bob opens the pizza box, grabs a slice, takes a huge bite,

text: wolfish bite while typing one-handed.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: (mouth full)
dialog: How long till Geek and Geekier come for

speaker_heading: QOHEN
text: Not long.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Damn.

text: Bob nods toward the pizza box.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Help yourself to the rest.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We're afraid our diet precludes pizza.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Put it in the fridge, then.
text: Bob attacks the keyboard with both hands.
text: Qohen retrieves the pizza box, carries it toward the kitchen.
text: He absently licks a bit of sauce from his finger and halts,
text: eyes closed. A look of fleeting pleasure crosses his face.
text: He opens his eyes, frowns, making sure Bob hasn't noticed.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - NIGHT
text: Qohen lies in bed, tossing and turning, unable to sleep.
dialog: He
dialog: As

text: something off camera, LAUGHING.
dialog: 55.
text: The picture comes to life, and she turns to face Qohen, her
text: LAUGHTER DYING. She looks at him with pity.
text: Qohen replaces the picture, face to the wall.
text: He trudges to his work station, sits at the computer.
text: Qohen touches the mouse: the menu appears. He sees
text: Bainsley's icon, hesitates, then clicks.
text: A live video of Bainsley fills the screen. Barely dressed in
text: white lingerie, she stretches seductively on a bed with red
text: satin sheets, eyes closed. She MOANS passionately into a
text: headset microphone, her hands caressing her corseted breasts.
text: Raunchy CHATROOM MESSAGES scroll below her image.
text: Qohen's head spins.
text: Bainsley smiles wickedly, her eyes slowly opening. She licks
text: her lips with a sultry smile, then sits up, smile freezing.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (V.0.)
dialog: (softly, into microphone)
dialog: Qohen?
text: Shocked, Qohen exits the site. He stares at his screen.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - DAY
text: Qohen lies on his bed, looking at his signature on the
text: receipt from the Clones.
text: Bob sits at the computer, typing furiously and softly
text: WHEEZING. His eyes are baggy with fatigue.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We never thought of Management as a
dialog: family man.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah, well, I'm it. Heir to his dark
dialog: throne. Like I want it. He gave me this
dialog: rap about my mom dying in childbirth, but
dialog: I know she just ran off. I'm out of here
dialog: too, soon as I finish my Ph.D.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Aren't you rather young for a doctorate?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It's just Quantum Systems Analysis. Old

dialog: Typical control freak.
text: Bob hits a key, and signs and symbols swiftly scroll.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: OK, Q. You're ready to go.
text: He stands, loses his balance, steadies himself against the
text: desk, breathing heavily.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Are you all right?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Fucking allergies.
text: Bob takes a hit from his inhaler, sucks it in deep.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: What exactly are you allergic to?
text: Bob pockets the inhaler, speaks through clenched teeth.
speaker_heading: BOB
text: Bald old farts laying in bed instead of
dialog: getting to work. Up and fucking at ‘em.

text: peers over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: These babies are shivering for your
dialog: special touch, Q. Just like that yummy

text: Qohen stops, mortified.
speaker_heading: QOHEN

speaker_heading: BOB

dialog: You kidding? Your life's an open beeping

dialog: what's she like in the virtual flesh?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: That's none of your business.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You're no fun. You sound like my dad.
text: Qohen grudgingly types. The scrolling slows, stops. He
text: hesitates. Types. The scrolling speeds up.
text: Qohen stares at the screen, hands frozen above the keyboard.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: What's the prob, Bob?
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Our name is Qohen. Q--No U-- 0 --
speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: QOHEN

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: There! Don't let him get away!

speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Gotcha, you little bastard.
text: Bob scrolls and types at lightning speed as Qohen stands back
text: in awe. The symbols re-configure in tidy rows.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: There. See? Easy. Now you do it.
text: Bob stands, and Qohen hesitantly takes his place. He stares
text: helplessly at the screen, fingers poised above the keyboard.
text: Qohen's shoulders slump in despair.
text: Bob leans over him, coaxing. He touches Qohen's shoulder.
text: Qohen stiffens.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We prefer not to be touched.
text: Bob draws his hand away, his eyes going hard.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: How'm I supposed to work with this? You
dialog: got your head stuck so far up your ass
dialog: you can't see shit. Do you even know
dialog: what Zip-T's all about?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: No. Do you?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: The old man says it's none of my biz.
dialog: But if I was working on it long as you,

speaker_heading: QOHEN

speaker_heading: CHUBS

text: Bob ignores Chubs, still staring at Qohen.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You really are a burnout, ain't you...
dialog: Get a clue, Q.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Time to go, Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Time to kiss my ass, Chubs.
speaker_heading: CHUBS
dialog: I'm Chubs.

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: If I ever take over, you guys are fired.
text: Slim and Chubs shoot each other worried glances.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Like I'll remember who the fuck you are.

scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - NIGHT
text: Qohen sits at his computer, scrolling through page after page
text: of neat and orderly signs and symbols, his lips unconsciously
text: forming soundless words as he strives to comprehend.
text: The Intercom BUZZES. Qohen raises his eyes to the crucifix.
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER
text: Qohen opens the door, and Bainsley is in his arms. Her

text: Qohen pulls it closed. She GIGGLES.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: You're drunk.
text: Bainsley rubs up against him.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Mostly.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: You clicked on me.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We -- we visited your web site in error.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Sure you did... You want me.
text: She wraps her arms around his neck, kisses him.
text: Qohen resists at first but then closes his eyes and, despite
text: himself, begins to kiss her back.
text: And now Bainsley breaks away, hot and flustered.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Easy, killer. Let a girl catch her
dialog: breath!
text: Qohen turns away, struggling to contain himself.
text: Bainsley pulls a VR suit from her coat pocket, shakes it out.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Go put yours on. I'1l hook us both up to
dialog: your computer. Oh! I can hardly wait!
text: Qohen stares at the suit, aghast.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We will never wear that suit again.
dialog: We... We can't ever go back there.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Bad trip last time. I know. This time
dialog: will be different. Trust me.
text: Bainsley wraps the VR suit around Qohen's neck, pulls him
dialog: close for a kiss...
dialog: 60.
text: But Qohen resists. He takes the suit from his neck, stuffs
text: it in her coat pocket, then firmly pulls her to the door.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: You're playing hard to get... You think
dialog: that turns me on... And it does... a

dialog: raised to his...
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on... Let's have some fun...
text: Qohen holds her by the shoulders at arm's length.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We don't have fun. We aren't any fun.
dialog: We have work to do. And we can't imagine
dialog: why you'd ever be interested in us.
text: Bainsley's eyes blaze.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: I'm starting to wonder myself. I just
dialog: didn't want to be alone tonight.
text: She turns to go.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe you really don't have a soul...
dialog: But I'm ready to find out when you are...
text: She leaves, closing the door behind her.
text: Qohen stares at the closed door... then, shoulders slumping,
text: he slowly returns to his computer.
text: He stares at the screen, rubs bleary eyes, tilts his head as
text: if listening. His eyes light on the crucifix and slowly
text: widen as a thought occurs to him.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Impossible.
text: He sits up straight, scrolls through the columns of signs and
text: symbols faster and faster, eyes sharp and swiftly moving.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - DAY

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm tapping into your network. Figure I

speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: So what's the agenda today, Q? Sit

dialog: another pizza? I'm for pizza, myself.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We -- we think we may have discovered the
dialog: purpose of the Zero Theorem.
text: Bob pauses.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You're shitting me.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Language...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (smiling, pleased)
dialog: Give it up, Q-dog.
text: Qohen rubs his forehead, stares up at the crucifix.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: As far as we've been able to ascertain,
dialog: the Zero Theorem employs a densely
text: compacted language that seeks to codify
dialog: all known phenomena in the universe.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Try it in English, Q.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: The Zero Theorem seeks to explain the
dialog: purpose of existence.
text: Bob's eyes widen.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You are fuh-reaking shitting me. Holy
dialog: crap. Holy crap! That is just too cool!
text: Bob turns back to the computer, types frantically.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We nail this bad boy, we're talking
dialog: groupie chicks from arts and sciences!
dialog: I'm laid for life!
text: Qohen remains silent, glumly staring. Bob looks at him.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What's the matter? Let's roll, Q!
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: The project is impossible.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No way to know without trying.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: But if we try and fail, then you and your
dialog: father won't help us to receive our call.
text: Bob whirls around, suddenly impatient.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Quit leaning all over me, huh?. You
dialog: smell like you died. Go for a walk or
dialog: something, air yourself out.
text: Qohen takes a step back.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We prefer not to go out.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Then take a shower. Give your dome a
dialog: turtle wax. Do anything besides stand
dialog: around giving me the eye. You're
dialog: creeping me out. Let me finish up here.
text: Bob reaches for his inhaler.
text: Hurt, Qohen backs away.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - LATER
text: Qohen scrubs himself viciously with a washcloth. He stops,
text: leans against the tile, closes his eyes. The spray hits him
text: in the face, water trickling down his cheeks like tears.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - SHRINE - LATER
text: Qohen quietly exits the bathroom and stops.
text: Bob stands in front of the shrine, looking at the photos, all
text: of which are facing forward.
text: Qohen's breath catches. His eyes burn. But then he breathes
text: deeply. He goes to the shrine, stands quietly next to Bob.
text: Bob looks at Qohen. Their eyes lock.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What happened to them?
dialog: 63.
text: Qohen stares at the photos: his Wife, his Son, his former
text: self in various family poses, various degrees of happiness.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
text: There was a fire.
text: He gazes up to the chapel's charred beams, jaw set stoically.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: And we can never understand the reason...
dialog: until we receive our call.
text: Bob tears up. He touches Qohen's arm, drops his hand.
text: Qohen turns a picture's face to the wall again, then another.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: We prefer that these not be touched. The
dialog: memories are... painful.
text: Bob turns away from Qohen, overwhelmed with emotion.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Oh, Jesus, Q. I feel so bad.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: It's all right. You didn't know.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No. I feel bad for lying to you.
text: Qohen stops what he's doing.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: What are you talking about?
text: Bob walks back toward the work station, Qohen following.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Your call. Nobody can get it for you.
dialog: Not my dad. Not me. Not anybody.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: But you said... Mr. Joby told us...
text: Qohen is unable to finish.

speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)

scene_heading: DR. SHRINK-ROM

speaker_heading: QOHEN

speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Bainsley?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Your call girl was paid by the hour.
text: Qohen looks dizzy. He covers his face with both hands.
text: Bob eases him into his chair.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll never ever lie to you ever again.
dialog: That's a promise, Q.
text: Qohen slowly lowers his hands from his face.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Our call is real. We've been waiting.
dialog: It will provide our lives with purpose
dialog: and meaning... a reason to go on...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Wake up, Q.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: (desperately)
dialog: Perhaps not by phone... Perhaps that was
dialog: our delusion... But somehow, some way...
speaker_heading: BOB
text: There is no call, Q. There's only Zip-T.
dialog: And you and me have less than three weeks
dialog: to solve it now.
text: Qohen's eyes harden.
dialog: 64.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Why in the world should we bother?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Because it's your job...
text: Qohen stares at him.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: For the advancement of science...
text: Qohen slowly shakes his head.
text: Bob ducks his head, peeks up with pleading eyes.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Do it for me, Q...? Please...?
text: Qohen is taken aback.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Why do you care so much about the Zero
dialog: Theorem?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: The truth?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: That's what you promised us.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: The old man told me if I helped you prove
dialog: Zip-T, he'd buy me a car.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: That's it? That's your reason?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, duh... Chicks dig the wheels, Q...
dialog: And soon as I get me some, I'm burning
dialog: road. I'ma million light years from

dialog: a kid out. Pretty fucking please?
text: Qohen looks into Bob's pleading eyes, softening.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Unseemly...
text: Excited, Bob gives Qohen's shoulders a quick squeeze.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You and me, Q. Your big ass computer and

speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: On one condition.
speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: QOHEN

dialog: a hard day's calculus, and he's like:
dialog: (lowering voice)
dialog: "Son, you'll never fulfill your destiny
dialog: that way." I'm like, "Jeez, Pop, how
dialog: about next commercial?" He gave up on me
dialog: before I even learned to ride a bike.
text: Qohen nods, hesitates.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Our problem is... it's pointless.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What is?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: The Zero Theorem. Follow the math.
dialog: Don't you see? The point is to prove
dialog: that there is no point. All of existence
dialog: is a cosmic accident. It started from
dialog: nothing and will end in nothing.
text: Bob moves about the work station, idly picking up objects.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I guess that's not good.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: It would make our lives meaningless.
text: Bob nods, distracted. He shrugs.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: So let's prove Zip-T's wrong.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Then your father won't give you a car.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Fuck him. I gotta prove something, Q.
dialog: Let's do it.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I don't know. Use your imagination.
text: Qohen stares at the monitor, thinking.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Energy begets matter... Matter begets
dialog: energy... According to the theorem,
dialog: everything must be accounted for... In
dialog: order to disprove it, we must find
dialog: something that can't be counted,
dialog: something outside the equation.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Such as...?
text: Qohen closes his eyes, then suddenly opens them, realizing.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Our soul.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Is that all?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: It may be all we've been waiting for...
dialog: but we can't imagine how to prove its
dialog: existence...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Whoa. Talk about a gnarly existential
dialog: brain-burner...
text: Bob idly opens the box that holds the VR suit, pulls it out.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
text: +. and my brain's half-toasted as is.
text: Bob holds the VR suit up to his chest.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Some fun in the sun could help. Think
dialog: that Bainsley chick would give me a
dialog: freebie?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Unseemly.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'd sure like to get inside her program.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We're afraid you'd find it empty.
text: Bob stops, lost in thought. Suddenly he stuffs the suit in
text: his pocket, grabs his laptop, and heads for the door.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Major breakthrough! I gotta get with
text: ManCom and figure out the details.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: What about the Clones?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: They can fuck each other up their asses.
dialog: I ain't waiting for them. I ain't
text: waiting for nothing. I'm grabbing a cab.
text: Bob slams the door behind him, leaving Qohen bewildered.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Language...
speaker_heading: LATER
text: The Clones flank the doorway, Qohen standing before them.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You let him go?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: How were we to stop him?
speaker_heading: CHUBS
text: Duct tape works.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Management won't be happy about this.
speaker_heading: CHUBS
dialog: I wouldn't want to be in your shoes.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You're in deep trouble.
text: Qohen's jaw clenches. He smiles coldly.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Bob left a message for you.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - SHRINE - NIGHT
text: Qohen stares at the pictures, all face forward.
dialog: 70.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - LATER
text: Qohen sits at his computer looking longingly at Bainsley's
text: icon. He clicks on it: "Access Denied!" Qohen slowly runs a
text: hand over his bald head. He clears the lump from his throat.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - MUCH LATER
text: The Black Hole SCREENSAVER swirls before him.
scene_heading: INT. QOHEN'S CHAPEL - MORNING
text: A box drops in front of Qohen. He opens his eyes. Bob
text: stands beside him, baggy-eyed, short of breath, but grinning.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Problem solved.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Where have you been?
speaker_heading: BOB
text: Lurking and working. Conferring,
text: consorting, and hobnobbing with ManCom on
dialog: the sly. Turned in my Ph.D. Dissertation
dialog: while I was at it. Committee chair about
text: had a stroke just reading the abstract.
dialog: He'll flunk my ass for sure.
text: Bob looks around the chapel.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Clones were here, right?
text: Qohen nods.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: They'll be back. The old man put out an
dialog: APB out on me. Every Clone in R&D's on
dialog: the hunt. No time to waste, Q.
text: Bob opens the box and pulls out the VR suit, which now sports
text: even more wires and transistors and a crudely sewn big gold
text: "Q" on its chest. He hands it to Qohen, pushes him out of
text: his chair, takes his place, and begins typing rapidly.
text: Qohen eyes the suit in his hands with dismay.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: More virtual reality.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Nope. I rewired it. This baby's a real
dialog: live inner-space soul-search suit. All I
dialog: gotta do is rig an interface with ManCom.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Energy, Q-dude! Everything inside you
dialog: releases energy -- from cell division to
dialog: a synapse firing. This suit'll pick up
dialog: the data and relay it to ManCom. If you
dialog: have a soul, this'll find it... And
dialog: ManCom'11l connect you to it.
text: Bob SNEEZES, wipes his nose on his sleeve.
text: Qohen stares at him.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't look at me like that, Q. It sounds
dialog: crazy, but I got it all figured out.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We're afraid you've been studying too
dialog: much philosophy and not enough physics.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You sound like my dissertation director.
dialog: There's plenty of room for philosophy
text: between subatomic particles.
text: Bob hits a few more keys. A DIALOGUE BOX pops up: "MANCOM
text: READY FOR INPUT".
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: No time to waste. Suit up, Super-Q.
text: Qohen picks up the suit.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We're afraid we can't wear this.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Sure you can. I even had it dry-cleaned.
text: Qohen shakes his head.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: You gotta. When you're connected, you'll
dialog: know everything ManCom knows.
text: Qohen delicately traces the "Q" on the suit with a fingertip.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Is it dangerous?
text: Bob meets his gaze.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Jesus, Q.... ManCom's the biggest,
dialog: baddest neural net computer ever made...
dialog: Your brain could come out like a carrot
dialog: in a blender for all I know...
text: He looks away helplessly.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Truth is, it scares the fuck out of me.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Unseemly...
text: The Intercom BUZZES.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you order a pizza?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Fucking Clones.
text: Bob drags a pew down the aisle to block the door, WHEEZING.
text: Qohen catches up, stops him.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: No. They have a key.
text: Qohen touches the intercom button.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes...?
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER
text: Qohen opens the door to reveal BAINSLEY. Wearing jeans and a
text: T-shirt, hair in a pony tail, she looks young and vulnerable.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Can I... come in?
text: Qohen steps back.
text: Bainsley enters. Spotting Bob, she raises puzzled eyes.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Bainsley -- Bob. Bob -- Bainsley.
dialog: Bob is Management's son...
dialog: (to Bainsley, darkly)
dialog: You know Management... don't you?
text: Bob stares at Bainsley. He takes a blast from his inhaler.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: I'm so sorry, Qohen... Joby told me I
dialog: could have the VR suit if I played along.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Then we suppose you have what you wanted.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: It's not like that... Not anymore...
dialog: Now I just want... you.
text: Bob makes a GAGGING sound, then SNEEZES. He recovers.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No way, babe. You're like major league,
dialog: and he's like, I mean... look at him.
text: Bainsley steps to Bob, touches his cheek, smiling sadly.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: Please don't laugh at me.
text: Smitten by her touch, Bob stares at her in wonder...
text: .«.-. and Qohen stares at her in disbelief.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm going away, Qohen. Come with me...
dialog: to a special place... an island... a
dialog: real one... just for you and me.
text: Qohen raises his eyes to the chapel's charred rafters. A
text: pair of pigeons nest atop a crossbeam, softly COOING.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: You and me -- we connected...
text: Qohen looks deep into her eyes.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: We can be together for real...
text: Qohen breaks away, looks at Bob as if for an answer. Bob's
text: face is a study in torn emotions.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Qohen...?
text: Qohen gazes toward the shrine, all the pictures there. He
text: hesitates, then hugs Bainsley close, whispers in her ear.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We're afraid... we can't...
text: Bainsley's eyes brim with tears. She kisses him softly.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: BAINSLEY
dialog: (desperately)
dialog: Oh, run away with me, Qohen. Please?
text: Qohen kisses her, eyes shut tight...
text: .+. Then his eyes snap open...
text: ++. and he backs away from her, mastering his emotions.
text: Bainsley searches his stoic face. A SOB escapes her.
text: She turns away and walks out.
text: Qohen closes the door.
text: Emotionless, he turns to Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Damn, Q... You got any heart at all?
text: Qohen doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Um... Want to suit up?
text: Qohen closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Need a break?
text: Qohen opens his eyes, looks around the chapel.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
text: We feel like a rat in a rat trap.
text: Bob follows Qohen's gaze. He SNEEZES.
speaker_heading: BOB
text: I been ready to gnaw my foot off since I
dialog: got here. Let's get out of this tomb.
scene_heading: INT. VESTIBULE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Qohen stares uncertainly at the great oak door to the street.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We haven't gone out in a long time...
text: Bob takes his arm.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER
text: The sun is bright. Qohen squints, takes a misstep, staggers.
dialog: 75.
text: Bob supports him. He pulls surfer sunglasses and baseball
text: cap from his pocket, puts them on Qohen, the cap backwards.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You don't need skin cancer.
text: They head down the street.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Can we go back now?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: There's a park just up the street. Let's
dialog: air you out. You're way overdue.
text: Qohen hugs himself, looking frail, feeble.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Should we have gone with her?
text: Bob gives him a pitying look.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What do I know? I'm just a kid.
text: Bob hooks his CD player on Qohen's belt, puts the headphones
text: on Qohen's ears. He pushes "play".
text: Qohen's eyes widen.
text: They continue walking. A trio of OLD LADIES pushing shopping
text: carts veers around them as they pass in the other direction.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - LATER
text: PEOPLE jogging, rollerblading, picnicking, feeding pigeons.
text: A pair of sisters -- LACY, 18, and BONNIE, 15 -- try to
text: launch a kite. It lifts, spins, nosedives. They LAUGH.
text: Qohen and Bob sit under a big oak tree, backs against its
text: trunk. Bob looks at Qohen, looks away, hesitates.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What's it like getting old, Q?
text: Qohen gazes into the branches, eyes clouding, voice robotic.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: You will question the worth of your life.
dialog: Nothing will satisfy you. You will be
dialog: alone. You will feel empty as a gourd...
text: Qohen snaps out of it, sees Bob's consternation.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Excuse our nihilism.
text: Bob shrugs, watches Lacy and Bonnie. The kite crashes to the
text: ground again. Lacy and Bonnie MOAN at the failure, GIGGLING.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: A little tail would make that thing more
dialog: aerodynamically active. And speaking of
dialog: a little tail, that girl is hot!
text: Bonnie tries again to get the kite airborne. She shoots Bob
text: a fleeting look, smiling shyly.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: (wistfully)
dialog: I don't know any girls my age...
dialog: (snapping out of it)
dialog: Think I should get a tongue stud?
text: The question draws Qohen out of his despair.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: For what purpose?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Chicks, dude. Chicks dig the metal.
text: Qohen stares into the distance, trying to take the question
text: seriously, searching for the proper response.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: In our experience, the female is
text: attracted to the male in direct inverse
dialog: proportion to the male's misguided
text: efforts to attract her attention.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Fuckin' huh?
text: Qohen smiles.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Chicks dig the real you.
text: Bob reaches over, squeezes Qohen's shoulder.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I bet you were a good dad, Q.
text: Qohen attempts to speak, but his emotion overcomes him.
text: Bob pats his arm and looks away, embarrassed. He spies a HOT
text: DOG VENDOR and jumps to his feet, losing his balance.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoa. I need food. Do us a coupla dogs,
dialog: Q? Coupla wieners for a coupla weenies?
text: Eyes misting, Qohen watches Lacy and Bonnie playing.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: May we have relish on ours?
text: Bob grins, trots off towards the hot dog vendor.
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER
text: Qohen sits deep in thought, gazing into the oak's branches.
text: The LAUGHTER of Lacy and Bonnie echoes. He looks at them.
text: They can't get the kite airborne, but they're having fun.
text: Qohen wrestles with a sudden impulse.
text: Bonnie holds the kite while Lacy, at the other end of 50 feet
text: of string, prepares to run with it.
text: Qohen stands, takes off his sunglasses, takes a deep breath,
text: and tries on a smile. It fits nicely. He approaches Bonnie.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Beautiful day for kite flying, isn't it?
text: Bonnie looks at him the way one might look at a quadriplegic
text: in a wheelchair. She smiles uncertainly.
speaker_heading: BONNIE
text: Except there's not enough wind.
text: Lacy eyes Qohen suspiciously, drops the string and moves
text: toward them.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We'll fix that.
text: Qohen produces a clean handkerchief from his pocket, shakes
text: it out with a flourish, then bends down and ties it to the
text: tail of the kite.
text: Bob returns with one-and-a-half hotdogs, the missing half in
text: his mouth. He stops and stares at Qohen fixing the kite for
text: the grateful girls, then quickly swallows, shoves the other
text: half of his hotdog in his mouth.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Qohen sits beneath the oak tree, eyes closed, savoring the
text: final bite of his hotdog.
text: He opens his eyes with satisfaction, watches Bob and Bonnie
text: holding onto the string of the airborne kite.
dialog: 78.
text: Lacy strolls down by the pond, leaving them alone. She looks
text: up, waves to Qohen, smiling. He waves back.
text: Bob pulls the string: the kite dips, barely missing the
text: ground, soars skyward. He and Bonnie LAUGH with delight.
text: Qohen's eyes brim with joy, then slowly darken.
text: Bob spots Qohen looking at him. He hands Bonnie the string,
text: whispers in her ear. She smiles and squeezes his hand.
text: Bob ambles to Qohen, plops down next to him, beaming.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Q-dog. How you doing, bud?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Well. You?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Whoa... You know?
text: Qohen smiles, puts a hand softly on Bob's arm.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: We know.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Look... About that soul-search thing...
text: Bob looks off at Bonnie. The kite is losing altitude. She
text: scrambles backwards to keep it in the air.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't have to do it. I will.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: But... Why?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Just to show the bastard.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: No. You're much too young. We're not at
dialog: all certain --
text: Suddenly, Bob pokes his finger sharply into Qohen's forehead.
text: Qohen winces.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Wake the fuck up, Q! You think you're
dialog: the only one who wants a call?
text: Qohen sits dazed.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Sorry. I never thought...
text: Bob stares at him.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: I said I'm sorry. I --
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Q... Dude... You just turned singular.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: (confused)
dialog: I did?
dialog: (hearing himself, smiling)
dialog: I suppose I did.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Jeez. I shoulda slapped you upside the
dialog: head the day we met.
text: Bob looks at Bonnie again. The kite has crashed, and she's
text: untangling herself from a swirl of string. He sighs.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: I guess we better get back to work...
text: Bob stands. Qohen rises too, puts a hand on his arm,
text: stopping him.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: No. Not yet. There's... there's someone
dialog: I have to see first.
text: Bob stares at him, uncomprehending, then breaks into a grin.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You're going after Bainsley.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: If you don't mind me leaving you here.
text: Bob looks over at Bonnie, smiles.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Meet you back at the tomb later.
text: Qohen hesitates. Bob playfully rubs Qohen's bald head.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Go get her, Q. I can wait.
dialog: 80.
scene_heading: INT. CAB - MOMENTS LATER
text: Qohen gets into a cab, slams the door.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Where to?
text: Qohen views him from behind: short-sleeved white shirt, tie
text: sticking out of collar, unruly hair slicked to the side. In
text: the rearview mirror: a flash of thick glasses.
text: Qohen catches his breath. The driver looks like a Clone.
speaker_heading: DRIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Nowhere to go...?
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER
text: Qohen runs from the cab, dodging traffic to the other side of
text: the street. He races down the sidewalk, heart pounding.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - LATER
text: Qohen sits in the rear of a nearly-empty bus, gazing out the
text: window as they travel through an upscale suburb.
text: He closes his eyes and rests his head against the glass.
text: When he opens his eyes, he spots a rider up front: short-
text: sleeved shirt and tie, thick glasses.
text: He looks around: acne-scarred faces, slicked hair, too-short
text: trousers, white socks in scuffed wingtips.
text: He ducks down: this can't be real.
text: The bus WHEEZES to a stop.
text: A line of Clone-like men board through the front door.
text: Panicking, Qohen jumps up and pushes through the rear door.
scene_heading: EXT. UPSCALE STREET - MOMENTS LATER
text: Qohen runs, lungs aching, GASPING. Everywhere he looks...
text: .+. Clones: driving their cars, walking their dogs, watering
text: their begonias. Clones and more Clones, fat, skinny, short,
text: tall, but all strangely identical in demeanor and dress...
text: all stopping what they're doing to stare at Qohen.
text: He veers off the street, cuts through...
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: BACKYARDS
text: ... dodging trees and flower beds, koi ponds and patio
text: furniture... running, running, running in desperation.
text: He vaults a fence, catches his foot, sprawls on the ground.
text: He lifts his face to the sky with a strangled SOB. Then his
text: eyes harden. He gets to his feet, sets off running again.
scene_heading: EXT. JOBY'S HOUSE - LATER
text: Out of breath and dishevelled, Qohen pounds on the door.
text: Joby opens it, all jovial.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Well if it isn't my old pal Quinn! Come
dialog: in! Have a beer! Have some tap water!
text: Joby stops, deep in thought.
speaker_heading: JOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait a minute... You're supposed to be
dialog: baby-sitting your little buddy Bob. You
dialog: didn't leave him all alone, did you?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Where is Bainsley?
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Management won't like that. No... It'll
dialog: be a regular Clone convention around your
dialog: place, poor kid... I bet your phone's
text: ringing off the hook even as we speak.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Bainsley. Where does she live?
text: Joby squints in thought, taps his lip.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: Bainsley... Nope, ain't ringing a bell.
text: Qohen grabs Joby by the shirt-front.
text: Joby snaps to attention, eyes narrowing.
speaker_heading: JOBY (CONT'D)
text: She packed up and took off. Chasing the
dialog: wind. She's the least of your worries.
speaker_heading: _ QOHEN
dialog: You're lying. You're Management's tool.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: You poor bastard. We're all tools. Get
dialog: used to it, Quinn.
text: Qohen slowly releases him.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: (helplessly, by rote)
dialog: My name is Qohen... QQ...
text: His voice dies out.
speaker_heading: JOBY
dialog: I know. I know who you are... Do you?
text: Joby steps back, looks at Qohen with pity, shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Go home, Q...
text: The door closes. Qohen stares at it, wracked with
text: indecision, then suddenly takes off running down the street.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - NIGHT
text: Exhausted, Qohen lets himself in, looks around fearfully.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Bob...?
text: The room is dark, gloomy, lit only by the sputtering candles
text: at the shrine and the ghostly glow of his computer.
text: Holding pews for support, Qohen drags himself to the shrine.
text: He falls to his knees, buries his face in his hands.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Bob!
text: After a while, he rises, wiping his face. He staggers to his
text: bed and collapses with a GROAN, exhausted and disheartened.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, Bob...
text: A RUSTLING from under the bed. Qohen jumps to his feet.
speaker_heading: BOB (0.S.)
dialog: (voice weak, gasping)
text: Dust bunny... biosphere... down here.
text: Bob crawls out from under the bed, shivering and COUGHING.
text: Qohen beams with joy, wraps Bob in a bear hug.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Clones came by twice. They'll be back.
text: Bob SNEEZES, WHEEZES, teeth chattering. Qohen releases him,
text: smooths Bob's sweaty hair from his forehead.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: You're burning up.
text: Bob pushes Qohen's hand away, pulls out his inhaler.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Just a fucking fever, Q. Don't wig out.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: You need medical attention.
text: Suddenly dizzy, Bob sits on the bed.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Nah... Just get me some aspirin and run
dialog: me a cool bath... And bar the door...
dialog: No way I wanna see another Clone...
scene_heading: BATHROOM - LATER
text: Bob lies in the tub in his boxers. Qohen kneels beside him.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: She gave me her number. Her name's
dialog: Bonnie. She's the hottest chick ever.
text: Her sister's name is Lacy. Too old for
dialog: me... You interested, Q?
text: Qohen soothes Bob's forehead with a washcloth, silent.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: So how'd you score with Bainsley?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
text: She's gone.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Wish she was here giving me a bath.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: So do I... But I seem to have lost her.
text: Bob COUGHS at length, closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Nobody's ever really lost Q-dog... We'll
dialog: find her... Soon as we nail Zip-T... get
dialog: your fucking call... excuse my...
text: Bob drifts off mid-sentence. His ragged breathing softens.
dialog: 84.
text: Qohen smooths back his hair, presses a cheek to his forehead,
text: lingers there, then lifts him from the tub. He drapes a
text: towel over him, steps back, struggling under Bob's weight...
text: Qohen slips and falls against the mirror, keeping his hold on
text: Bob. Righting himself, Qohen glances to the broken mirror...
text: Amid the shattered glass, a red light shines.
scene_heading: CHAPEL - MOMENTS LATER
text: Qohen tucks Bob into bed. Hand on Bob's brow, he checks his
text: temperature. He draws back his hand, still worried.
scene_heading: BATHROOM —- MOMENTS LATER
text: Qohen raises the ball-peen hammer and SMASHES the ManCam.
text: Its red light blinks out.
speaker_heading: CHAPEL - LATER
text: Qohen drags a pew down the aisle, stacks it against two
text: others blocking the door.
scene_heading: CHAPEL - MORNING
text: The door's deadlock CLICKS open.
text: Qohen awakens with a start, sitting in a chair next to the
text: bed where Bob still sleeps, softly SNORING. He removes his
text: hand from Bob's head, listening, disoriented.
text: The door shudders, moves. Pews GROAN as they move.
text: Qohen springs up, Bob still sleeping, and rushes to the door.
text: A THUD from outside moves the blockade. The door opens a
text: crack. Qohen throws himself against it with all his might.
text: The THUD and GRUNT of shoulder on door, pushing Qohen back.
text: The door opens a foot. Qohen looks around in a panic.
text: Bob sits up in bed, bleary-eyed with fever.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Q...?
text: Qohen sprints to the shrine, picks up the candle stand in
text: both hands, and runs back down the aisle. Candles fly,
text: landing in piles of computer printouts, igniting them.
text: With a STRANGLED SCREAM, Qohen hurls the stand at the door.
text: Wrought iron wedges. The door THUDS and THUMPS, stuck.
dialog: 85.
text: But when Qohen turns around to check on Bob, he sees:
speaker_heading: FIRE.
text: It's a small paper fire, but in Qohen's eyes it turns to:
scene_heading: FLASHBACK - BURNING HOUSE
text: Qohen fights through smoke and flames, CRASHES through a
text: window, rolls on the ground, smoldering, SOBBING.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Qohen throws himself on the pile of burning printouts, eyes
text: clenched tight, mouth open in a soundless scream. He rolls
text: over and over, burning himself, but putting out the fire.
text: Bob gets out of bed, wobbling with fever. He COUGHS,
text: WHEEZES, then collapses on the bed, unconscious.
text: Qohen rushes to him.
text: The door bursts open, pews and wrought iron SCREECHING
text: against the floor. Slim and Chubs push through, breathless.
text: Qohen cradles Bob in his arms. The Clones walk up the aisle.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Take him to a hospital.
text: Chubs reaches for Bob. Qohen hugs him closer for a moment,
text: then carefully places him in Chubs' arms. Bob's breathing is
text: ragged. Qohen smooths the hair from his eyes...
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Please. Hurry.
text: The Clones turn to go. Slim glances at Qohen's work station.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Your time's up. We'll be back for the
dialog: hardware tomorrow. Don't touch anything.
text: They head out the door with Bob. Qohen stares after them.
speaker_heading: CHAPEL - LATER
text: Qohen kneels before the wrecked shrine, a single burning
text: candle in his cupped hands.
text: He stares through the flickering flame at the photos.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Qohen sits at his computer, dressed in the soul-search suit.
dialog: 86.
scene_heading: MONITOR: "MANCOM READY FOR INPUT".
text: Qohen traces the "Q" on his chest, then pulls on the hood.
text: He hits the "enter" key.
text: A low-pitched HUM as the program powers up.
text: Monitor fills with STATIC. White noise HISSES.
text: Qohen sits rigid, waiting.
text: Five long seconds pass...
text: HISSING stops. HUM winds down. Monitor blinks. The BLACK
text: HOLE SCREENSAVER appears.
dialog: Silence.
text: Qohen raises his face to the crucifix in despair...
text: He touches the braid of wires at the back of his hood,
text: adjusting them, and suddenly:
text: A FLASH OF LIGHT
scene_heading: SPACE - MANCOM MAINFRAME - CONTINUOUS
text: Qohen spins weightless through labyrinthine corridors. There
text: is no up or down. Only a dizzying expanse of computer banks
text: stretching as far as the eye can see.
text: Qohen weaves his way through a BUZZ of circuitry.
text: As he approaches a computer bank, its lights FLASH, and...
scene_heading: MANCOM PORTAL - CONTINUOUS
text: .»+.- Qohen is spinning headfirst through a SPARKING rainbow-
text: lit tunnel of circuits. Qohen is inside ManCom.
text: His braid of wires flies behind him, shooting FLAMES.
text: Electrical currents arc from every passing circuit board to
text: the trailing wires, creating a comet's tail of voltage.
text: Qohen clutches his head in pain, turning sharp angles amid
text: explosions of color, accelerating at every turn, a bolt of
text: SCREAMING lightning.
text: Up ahead, spinning toward him, the end of the tunnel: Space.
text: And spinning in the center of Space: The Black Hole.
text: Qohen closes his eyes in terror...
dialog: 87.
scene_heading: SPACE — MANCOM CONTROL - CONTINUOUS
text: Qohen opens his eyes to find himself motionless, standing on
text: solid flooring, ManCom's computer banks behind him, the
text: control console in front of him opening onto starry space...
text: and beyond that... the Black Hole looms.
text: A dark Figure hunches over the control console.
text: Qohen removes his hood, catches his breath. He steps closer.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Bob...?
text: The Figure swivels to face Qohen. It is Management, dressed
text: in his taupe suit, the Black Hole rotating behind him.
speaker_heading: MANAGEMENT
dialog: I'm afraid you won't find my son here,
text: Mr. Leth. He's been hospitalized.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Is he... Will he be all right?
text: Management stands, turns to face the Black Hole, his voice
text: low and hoarse, as if speaking to himself.
speaker_heading: MANAGEMENT
dialog: If I believed in miracles, I'd be praying
dialog: for one now. My son... is not well.
dialog: He's never been well. I've tried to
dialog: protect him, but he's always chafed at my
dialog: touch... Eventually, a father must let
dialog: go. Surely you know that, Mr. Leth.
text: He turns to face Qohen, smiling sadly.
text: Qohen looks around.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Where, precisely, am I?
speaker_heading: MANAGEMENT
dialog: This is your mind, Mr. Leth. This is
dialog: your mind in ManCom.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Then are you real or just in my mind?
speaker_heading: MANAGEMENT
dialog: Is there really a difference? You're
dialog: part of the Neural Net now. All of your
dialog: knowledge, all of your being has been
text: incorporated into ManCom.
text: Qohen stares in despair.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: What is the answer?
speaker_heading: MANAGEMENT
dialog: That depends upon the question.
text: Qohen's jaw clenches.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: What am I living for?
speaker_heading: MANAGEMENT
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Good question, Mr. Leth, but posed to the
dialog: wrong person. You've apparently mistaken
dialog: me for an entity of considerably higher
dialog: power. I am not the source of your call.
dialog: I am neither God nor Devil. I am simply
text: a man who seeks the truth.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: And what is the truth?
speaker_heading: MANAGEMENT
dialog: You're looking it dead in the eye.
text: He sweeps his hand toward the Black Hole behind him.
speaker_heading: MANAGEMENT (CONT'D)
text: Chaos encapsulated. This is all there is
text: in the end, as it was in the beginning.
text: Qohen stares at the Black hole in dismay.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Then you've proven the Zero Theorem.
text: Management sits on the edge of the control panel, frowning.
speaker_heading: MANAGEMENT
dialog: Not quite. ManCom is still, as you put
text: it, "crunching" the data. But it's only
dialog: a matter of time.
text: Qohen struggles to control his anger.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Why would you ever want to prove that all
dialog: is for nothing?
text: Management adjusts his tie with finicky precision.
speaker_heading: MANAGEMENT
dialog: The saddest aspect of mankind's belief in
dialog: a purpose beyond this life is that it
dialog: makes this life meaningless -- a way
text: station on the road to eternity.
dialog: 
dialog: 89.
text: The black hole swirls behind Management, a yawning maw of
text: emptiness framing his head like a dark halo.
speaker_heading: MANAGEMENT (CONT'D)
dialog: You've persisted in believing that a call
dialog: could give your life meaning. You've
text: waited and waited for that call to come.
dialog: And as a result, you've led a meaningless
dialog: life. We give our own lives meaning...
dialog: even if we can't understand the reason...
dialog: Every rose has its thorns, Mr. Leth.
text: Management approaches Qohen, puts a hand on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: MANAGEMENT (CONT'D)
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: I'm sorry, Mr. Leth. We're not really
dialog: all that different, you and I... But
dialog: ultimately you must find your own way.
text: Qohen stares at Management's hand...
text: «+. and suddenly Management disappears.
text: Qohen slumps for a moment, staring at the Black Hole...
text: Then, eyes burning, he seats himself at the control panel.
text: He locates a keyboard, begins typing desperately.
dialog: Nothing.
text: Frustrated, Qohen leaps to his feet, rips the keyboard from
text: the panel, and hurls it at a nearby computer bank.
text: The keyboard shatters without doing any damage, but suddenly
text: the computer bank lights up like a flashing pinball machine.
text: Qohen stares at the light-show in wonder...
text: Frantically, he begins demolishing the control panel, hurling
text: pieces at the computer banks... He heaves up the desk-top...
text: +. and something falls CLANGING to the floor.
text: It is a ball-peen hammer. Qohen stoops to pick it up.
text: He holds it in his,hand, flexing its weight, smiling coldly.
text: And then he goes berserk, throwing himself against bank after
text: bank of computers, wildly swinging, SMASHING, swinging,
text: grinning like a demon on fire...
text: He rampages down the corridor of computer banks, hammering.
text: And while each machine remains undamaged, all flash wild
text: lights after he hits them, a frenzied flashing and WHIRRING
text: that seems to match Qohen's unbridled anger.
dialog: 90.
text: He finally falls to his knees, weary, and raises his eyes...
text: All the way down the endless corridor, ManCom's computer
text: banks are powering up.
text: He turns and, still on his knees, gazes at the Black Hole.
text: It seems to loom closer, larger.
text: Qohen's eyes light up like fire as the realization hits him.
text: Qohen gets to his feet. He pulls up his hood, places a hand
text: on the "Q" on his chest, pats it for reassurance, raises his
dialog: hammer high...
text: «+. then takes off at a sprint up the corridor.
text: Computer banks flash, spark, explode in his wake...
text: He vaults the control panel in a single bound and is suddenly
text: soaring through...
speaker_heading: SPACE
text: Arms outstretched, hammer leading the way, a comet's tail of
text: fire and light trailing him, Qohen flies straight toward...
scene_heading: THE BLACK HOLE
text: It spins closer and closer, an open mouth of darkness, as
text: Qohen streaks toward...
speaker_heading: IMPACT
scene_heading: EXPLOSION OF COLORS
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TROPICAL ISLAND - BEACH - SUNSET
text: A brilliant sun is setting, half-submerged in the ocean.
text: Qohen stands on the beach, mesmerized by the sunset.
text: He drops his hammer, comes back to himself, turns around...
dialog: The island is just the way he and Bainsley left it so long
text: ago. Their footsteps dot the sand. The campfire burns low.
text: He walks to the campfire, picks up the rumpled blanket, hugs
text: it to his chest, remembering.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Bainsley...
text: He drops the blanket, stands staring at the sunset.
dialog: 91.
text: He lowers his eyes, closes them, and when he opens them...
text: .»+. He sees his Wife and Son sitting nearby on the beach.
text: His wife helps his son build a sand castle.
text: Slowly, they both turn to look at Qohen. His Son waves
text: goodbye to him, his face joyful. His Wife raises a hand in
text: farewell, smiling and nodding slowly, as if offering him
text: absolution, as if releasing him to live his life.
text: Qohen smiles back, his eyes filling with tears.
text: He turns to face the nearly-set sun again. The horizon is a
text: riot of crimson reflecting off the sea.
text: He raises his outstretched arms, hands seeming to cradle the
text: sun. Slowly, he lets his hands descend.
text: The sun begins to set. Qohen lowers his hands to his sides,
text: and the last of the sun dips into the ocean.
text: Qohen turns around. Stars twinkle in the darkening sky above
text: the jungle. He stares up at them.
text: FADE TO WHITE.
text: A phone softly RINGS and RINGS...
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - DAY
text: Qohen sits at his work station, fully suited and still
text: plugged in, though the computer is dead.
text: The phone RINGS and RINGS.
text: He slowly pulls down his hood, stares at the RINGING phone.
text: He reaches for it, then stops.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: No... No more...
text: He rubs his eyes. His fingers trail down his cheeks. With a
text: look of surprise, he feels the top of his head.
text: His face and head show the trace of stubble.
text: The phone stops RINGING.
text: Qohen unplugs his braid of wires from the computer and
text: stands, weak and dizzy.
dialog: 92.
text: He makes his way to the Shrine, gazes at the pictures there.
text: He touches the one with the broken glass, a sad smile curving
text: his trembling lips, then wipes the tears from his eyes.
text: He smashes the frame, slips the photo under the torso of his
text: suit, next to his heart.
text: He takes a candle back to his work station. He touches the
text: flame to a pile of computer printouts, starting a small fire.
text: He watches as the fire grows.
text: The phone RINGS.
text: Distracted, irritated, Qohen snatches it up.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I'm afraid you have the wrong number.
speaker_heading: BOB (V.O.)
dialog: Jesus, Q! I been calling for the last
dialog: hour! Where the fuck you been?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: (joyfully)
dialog: Bob?! Where are you?
speaker_heading: BOB (V.O.)
dialog: On the way. I just left the hospital.
text: He watches the flames grow. He eases back from the fire,
text: trailing the phone cord behind him.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: You're... you're all right then?
speaker_heading: BOB (V.O.)
dialog: Miraculous recovery the docs refused to
dialog: believe. I had to wait till everybody
text: took a smoke break to escape.
text: Qohen backs further away from the fire.
speaker_heading: BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen, Q, don't put on that VR suit!
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Um... I'm wearing it right now.
speaker_heading: BOB (V.O.)
dialog: Well don't plug in! I heard from one of
text: the Clones ManCom had a meltdown last
text: night. Fucking thing's babbling like a
dialog: baby on acid. Not a safe trip at all.
text: Qohen smiles.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: I'll keep that in mind.
speaker_heading: BOB (V.O.)
dialog: Good. Go outside and wait for me. I'll
dialog: be there in a minute.
text: The line CLICKS dead.
text: The fire is raging now, the computer in flames, spewing
text: noxious smoke. Qohen backs away as far as the taut phone
text: line will allow, then punches 9-1-1 on the handset.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yes, I'd like to report a fire...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER
text: Qohen stands on the sidewalk, face aimed at the sunny sky.
text: PASSERSBY stare at his costume, but Qohen doesn't notice.
text: He turns to look at his chapel. Smoke billows out the
text: windows. He walks to the curb...
text: .--and suddenly spots Management, flanked by Chubs and Slim,
text: standing in a shop doorway across the street.
text: A sports car comes screeching to a halt in front of Qohen.
text: The tinted window rolls down, and Bob pokes his head out.
dialog: Get in! 1 stole this from the old man.
dialog: Every Clone in town'll be after me.
text: Qohen circles the car to the passenger side.
text: Hand on the door, he hesitates.
text: Across the way, the Clones move forward, eyes menacing.
text: But Management stops them with a motion of his hand.
text: He nods to Qohen, puts a finger to his lips, and, smiling
text: sadly, takes one last look at Bob.
text: Then he turns and goes into the shop, the Clones following.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: (frantic)
dialog: Come on, Q!
text: Qohen gets in the car.
dialog: 94,
scene_heading: INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Qohen puts on his seatbelt.
text: A fire engine's siren WAILS in the distance, getting closer.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: The bastard has the heat after me.
text: Bob hits the gas and peels out, steering wildly.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Please don't refer to your father as a
dialog: bastard. It's... unseemly.
dialog: (hesitantly)
dialog: Are you old enough to drive?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Who cares? We're on the lam, Q!
text: Bob comes to a jerky stop at a red light. He rests his
text: forehead on the steering wheel.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus, Q, I can't believe what I've gone
dialog: through lately. I'm totally wiped.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: Perhaps you and I should take a vacation.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Where to?
speaker_heading: QOHEN
text: I'm picturing an exotic tropical island.
text: Bob looks at him skeptically.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You really think we can find her?
text: Qohen gazes out the window into the distance.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: You know how many tropical islands there
dialog: are in the world?
text: Qohen turns to Bob, smiling.
speaker_heading: QOHEN
dialog: As it happens, I know the exact number.
dialog: You're not the only genius in this car.
text: Bob looks at Qohen and slowly breaks into a huge grin.
text: The light turns green.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What the fuck are we waiting for?
text: Bob floors it, the tires squeal, and Qohen's eyes widen.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: The car careens down the street, barely missing a fire engine
text: going in the other direction.
text: Qohen's wailing voice rises above the SIRENS.
speaker_heading: QOHEN (V.O.)
dialog: Un-fucking-seemly.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
dialog:
