scene_heading: 1 EXT: MIDTOWN MANHATTAN STREETS - DAY
text: Behind the opening credits, we watch a montage of RUPERT
text: PUPKIN making his daily rounds as a messenger delivering
text: manila envelopes and packages to various New York offices,
text: always courteous and polite in his demeanor, PUPKIN is an
text: attractive-looking young man just past thirty and dressed
text: in a stylish blue suit, broad tie and wide-collared shirt.
text: His shoes are neatly polished, his hair carefully groomed.
text: As the montage continues, we see that he has finished his
text: deliveries and is walking rapidly towards his destination.
text: It turns out to be a television theater north of Times
text: Square whose marquee announces THE JERRY LANGFORD SHOW.
text: It is dusk and the show is about to break. There is a
text: very small crowd already positioned at the stage door --
text: a few young girls, a few curious passers-by who have
text: stopped to see who will emerge. Three professional
text: autograph hunters are clustered together:
text: MAE, a lady in her sixties, wears a red velvet dress, a
text: lace hat and much too much rouge.
text: SIDNEY is in his mid-twenties, tall, badly-complexioned,
text: slicked hair but otherwise neatly dressed. He carries
text: a brown lunch bag.
text: CELESTE is an enormously fat woman in her mid-thirties.
text: She wears a large cape to conceal her obesity.
text: A middle-aged MAN, dressed in a corduroy suit, emerges
text: from the backstage door which is guarded by a large,
text: white-haired POLICEMAN. The non-professionals in the
text: crowd just peer at the MAN but MAE immediately steps in
text: front of him with her autograph book raised.
speaker_heading: MAE
speaker_heading: (to the MAN)
dialog: Are you somebody?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: No, honey, I'm just a working stiff.
text: The MAN keep walking and MAE returns to her cohorts
text: just as PUPKIN arrives.
speaker_heading: MAE
dialog: Hi, Rupert.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: (coolly)
dialog: Hello, Rupert.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Who did you get?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (distractedly)
dialog: Nobody.
text: PUPKIN carefully places himself near the door, a step or
text: two away from the other professionals.
speaker_heading: MAE
speaker_heading: (to SIDNEY)
dialog: I got Mr. Raf Vallone outside 21.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: (to SIDNEY about PUPKIN)
dialog: He'd never tell you anyway, Sidney.
speaker_heading: MAE
dialog: Then I got him again at the
text: Pierre at four o'clock.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Be a dear, Mae. I don't happen
dialog: to have Mr. Vallone.
speaker_heading: MAE
dialog: You know what I want for him.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: But I have only six Barbra's left.
dialog: You know how difficult she is to
dialog: work with.
speaker_heading: MAE
dialog: I don't have her even once.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: (to MAE)
dialog: Maybe Rupert would help you.
text: PUPKIN shoots a hostile glance back at CELESTE.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Would you do that, Rupert? You don't
dialog: feel about Barbra the way I do.
speaker_heading: MAE
dialog: I'll give you Mr. Burt Reynolds too.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
speaker_heading: (needling RUPERT)
dialog: Look, Sidney, Rupert doesn't do
dialog: that sort of thing.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: How about it, Rupert? I'll give
dialog: you whoever you want.
text: SIDNEY starts pulling little white cards out of his paper
text: bag and reading them off.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Rodney Dangerfield ... Richard
dialog: Harris ... Liza Minelli ... and
dialog: she's not so easy to work with
dialog: either ... Louise Lasser!
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: You're wasting your time.
text: PUPKIN has been trying to remain apart from the other
text: three. Finally he turns to SIDNEY.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Look, Sidney. I'm just not
dialog: interested. This isn't my
dialog: whole life, you know.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: What's that supposed to mean --
dialog: that it's my whole life, or
dialog: Sidney's or Mae's?
speaker_heading: MAE
dialog: It is so my whole life.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Shut up, Mae. What about your
dialog: mother? Isn't she part of
dialog: your life?
speaker_heading: MAE
dialog: It's her whole life too.
text: The show breaks. The doors swing open and people pour out.
text: The crowd around the backstage door swells.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: (to the crowd)
dialog: If you want Jerry's autograph, give
dialog: me your piece of paper and I'll
dialog: send it backstage.
text: A number of people in the crowd hand in pieces of paper.
text: PUPKIN is standing next to a young couple, about college
text: age. The YOUNG GIRL has just sent in her paper.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (to the GIRL)
dialog: What are you going to do with
dialog: Jerry's autograph?
speaker_heading: YOUNG GIRL
dialog: I don't know. Maybe I'll sell it.
speaker_heading: BOYFRIEND
dialog: I'll tell you what she's going to
dialog: do with it. She's going to pin
text: it on her bulletin board and
dialog: have an orgasm.
text: The YOUNG GIRL laughs unself-consciously.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: LANGFORD's limousine waits directly in front of the stage
text: door. MAE has engaged the CHAUFFEUR who stands at the
text: door of the car in conversation.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: (wearily)
dialog: No, Mae.
speaker_heading: MAE
dialog: I don't mean now.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: No, Mae.
speaker_heading: MAE
dialog: I'll get right out.
text: The CHAUFFEUR, smiling, shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A plain-looking GIRL in a black raincoat and black, floppy
text: hat stands on the street side of the limousine,
text: carefully watching MAE and the CHAUFFEUR talk.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: MAE
dialog: But I've never been in one.
text: We hear a cry as a celebrity emerges from the backstage
text: door. MAE turns and goes back towards the door.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The POLICEMAN is handing out the autographs. Suddenly
text: LANGFORD emerges, flanked by three PAGES, husky young men
text: in their early twenties dressed in theater uniforms.
text: There is screaming and some yelling of LANGFORD's name.
text: LANGFORD pays no attention. Smiling nervously, he makes
text: his way towards the limousine. The CHAUFFEUR stands at
text: the rear of the car, holding the door. LANGFORD enters
text: the car and then suddenly springs back. The GIRL in the
text: black raincoat and black hat has hidden herself in the
text: back seat of the limousine. The three PAGES, who have
text: already turned and headed back toward the theater, hear
dialog: the commotion and swing around. The GIRL, who we shall
text: come to know as MARSHA, hides herself in the far end of
text: the limo, so two of the PAGES go around to the far side
text: of the car and start pulling her out while the third PAGE
text: moves into the limo from the street side. She fights
text: like a wildcat, but the PAGES slowly manage to drag her
text: out. During the struggle, LANGFORD stands amid the crowd,
text: a bit shaken. PUPKIN stands next to him, staring at him.
text: When finally catches LANGFORD's eye, PUPKIN smiles
dialog: pleasantly.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (to LANGFORD who
dialog: barely listens)
dialog: How the hell did that girl get in
dialog: there? Jesus, they certainly
dialog: don't give you very good protection,
dialog: do they?
text: LANGFORD says nothing, glancing nervously at PUPKIN.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Look at you here. Who the hell
dialog: is watching you? Any one of
dialog: these freaks could just walk
dialog: right up to you and do whatever
dialog: he wants.
text: A couple YOUNG GIRLS are pressing against LANGFORD.
speaker_heading: FIRST GIRL
dialog: Oh, Jerry. How can we get to
dialog: talk to you?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Just a minute. This is crazy.
text: PUPKIN straightens up for action.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (yelling at the crowd)
dialog: Okay! Stand back!
text: PUPKIN wades through the crowd towards the limousine,
text: pushing SIDNEY and MAE among others out of the way.
text: LANGFORD follows in the path PUPKIN is clearing.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Didn't you hear me?!? Come on,
dialog: people, have a heart.
text: The PAGES have succeeded in pulling the GIRL out of the
text: far door of the limo just as PUPKIN and LANGFORD arrive
text: at the near door. The CHAUFFEUR has been blocked by the
text: crowd from opening the door so PUPKIN opens it.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Stand back! (To LANGFORD) Go ahead,
dialog: Jerry.
text: LANGFORD slips in quickly. He looks up at PUPKIN who is
text: holding the door, smiling pleasantly.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Thanks. Thanks very much.
text: PUPKIN stares at LANGFORD for a moment and then slides
text: into the limo next to him, closing the door behind him.
scene_heading: 2 INT: LIMO - NIGHT
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I hate to bother you like this, Jerry,
dialog: but could I speak to you for a minute.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: I'd like to but ...
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I know you're a busy man. I promise not
dialog: to take very long, really. But I need
dialog: your advice.
text: PUPKIN looks down at his hand which has been badly
dialog: scratched.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You don't have a handkerchief, do you?
dialog: Jesus, these people will kill you for a
text: cufflink.
text: LANGFORD hands him a monogrammed handkerchief, then checks
dialog: his watch.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Thanks. If you have to be somewhere, I
dialog: don't mind talking as we drive. You can
dialog: drop me off anywhere.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Sorry, but I've got a strict rule never to ...
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I put myself on the line for you, Jerry.
text: Reluctantly, LANGFORD signals with his head to his
text: CHAUFFEUR to start moving. As the car moves through New
text: York traffic, PUPKIN and LANGFORD talk.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Thanks, Jerry. I'm grateful for this chance
dialog: to talk to you ... I hope I'm not boring you.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: I'll let you know.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Really? Fine. I'm Rupert Pupkin, Jerry.
dialog: I know that the name itself doesn't mean
dialog: very much to you but it means an awful lot
dialog: to me, believe me. Maybe you've seen me
dialog: outside your show and wondered who I am.
dialog: Well, right now, I'm in communications but,
dialog: by nature, I'm a stand-up comedian. I know
dialog: what you're thinking -- 'oh no. Not another
dialog: one.' And I wouldn't take up even one minute
dialog: of your time if I wasn't absolutely convinced
dialog: of my talent. I'm really good, Jerry,
dialog: believe me, I'm dynamite. Now you're probably
dialog: wondering if I'm so good why haven't you
dialog: caught my act somewhere, right?
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Well ...
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Well, up to now, I've been biding my time,
dialog: developing my act slowly and carefully so
dialog: that when my big break finally comes, I'm
dialog: ready -- like you were that night Paar got
dialog: sick and you sat in for him. I was there
dialog: that night, in the theater. That was the
dialog: most important night of my life, until
dialog: tonight, of course.
text: PUPKIN fishes a cigarette case out of his jacket pocket,
text: flips it open and offers one to LANGFORD.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: No thanks. I don't smoke.
text: PUPKIN returns the pack to his pocket.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Me neither. I just carry them as a
dialog: courtesy. How about a cough drop?
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: (smiling indulgently)
dialog: No thanks. I don't cough.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I try not to but sometimes, you know
dialog: ... Am I making any sense?
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Well, that night you did Paar, I walked
text: out of the theater like I was in a dream.
dialog: All of a sudden, I knew what I wanted.
dialog: I started catching your guest appearances
dialog: on Sullivan and taping them and, when you
dialog: got your own show, it got to be a kind of
dialog: regular thing. I studied how you built
dialog: to your one-liners, nice and relaxed like
dialog: you were chatting, and how you delivered
dialog: the jokes without leaning too much on
dialog: them, without saying "here's the punchline,
dialog: folks." And I watched the way you played
dialog: off dead audiences, how you let those long
dialog: silences build until people couldn't
dialog: stand it and then the way you got them
dialog: off the hook with that slow smile. You
dialog: were my college of comedy, Jerry, like
dialog: a kind of teacher, a friend. I know it
dialog: sounds crazy, but when you watch someone
dialog: every night ... But that's all in the
dialog: past. What I'm trying to say is this.
dialog: I'm ready now. I've finished the course.
dialog: And I'm thinking as we sit here talking
dialog: "Is this it? Is this that one big break?"
dialog: Is it, Jerry?
text: There is a long pause.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Jerry?
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Look ... er ... what was the name?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I'm Rupert, Jerry.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Look, Rupert. I know what you're saying.
dialog: But things don't work that way. You can't
dialog: just walk onto a network show without any
dialog: experience. You've got to start at the
dialog: bottom ...
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: But that's where I am!
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: You've got to work your way up, learn your
dialog: trade in front of live audiences, start
text: playing the little clubs.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: But that can take years, Jerry! Look at
dialog: me. I'm already 31 years old! People my
dialog: age are way ahead of me. I've got some
dialog: catching up to do and I need your help.
dialog: What do you say, Jerry? All I'm asking
dialog: you to do is listen to my act. That's all.
dialog: Is that asking too much?
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: I get calls from agents every day.
dialog: All they want ...
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I tried getting an agent. I did, Jerry.
dialog: But you know how it is. You can't get an
dialog: agent unless you're working and you can't
dialog: get work unless you've got an agent ...
dialog: or unless you know somebody. And the
dialog: only person I know is you, Jerry.
text: There is a long pause.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Look, why don't you call my office.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Could I?!? Oh, I knew you'd say that,
dialog: Jerry. You don't know how many times I've
dialog: had this conversation in my head. And this
dialog: is the way it always turns out. That's why
dialog: I had to sort of invite myself into the car
dialog: tonight. I know it's kind of presumptuous
dialog: and I really appreciate the time you've
dialog: given me. But breaks like this don't just
dialog: happen. You have to make your own breaks.
text: The limousine starts slowing down as it pulls up before
text: U.N. Plaza. It stops. LANGFORD gets out. PUPKIN follows.
scene_heading: 3 EXT: U.N. PLAZA APARTMENTS - NIGHT
text: LANGFORD turn to PUPKIN, looking to get rid of him as
text: cleanly and gracefully as possible. LANGFORD extends
text: his hand. PUPKIN goes to shake it but his hand is wrapped
text: in the handkerchief. He extends his left hand. LANGFORD
text: shakes it awkwardly.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Nice meeting you, Rupert. I hope it all
dialog: works out for you.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Thanks, Jerry. I don't know how to repay
dialog: you. I'm a little short on cash this
dialog: evening, but, if you don't mind some good,
dialog: hearty food, I'd be honored to take you
dialog: to dinner.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Thanks, but some people are waiting for me.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Oh, I understand. Well, then, maybe I could
dialog: repay you with a joke.
text: LANGFORD is starting to walk into the building.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Wait a minute. How's this? The first night
dialog: you do your show from the coast, you open
dialog: this way. "Good evening, ladies and
dialog: gentlemen, it's great to be back here in
dialog: Southern California where you can wake up
dialog: in the morning and listen to the birds
dialog: coughing ... "
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: (nodding but unsmiling)
dialog: Not bad. Maybe.
text: PUPKIN calls after LANGFORD who heads for the entrance
text: to his building.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Consider it a gift. Hey, Jerry!
dialog: How about lunch? My treat!
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: (turning back before
dialog: he enters the building)
dialog: Call my office.
text: PUPKIN waves with his bandaged hand, notices LANGFORD's
text: handkerchief and unwraps it.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (to the handkerchief)
dialog: Thanks, Jerry.
text: The CAMERA MOVES IN for a CLOSE-UP of PUPKIN in a kind of daze.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: 4 INT: SARDI'S RESTAURANT - DAY
text: PUPKIN and LANGFORD stand at the edge of the foyer, waiting
text: for the Maitre d' to seat them. VINCENT, the owner, spots
text: them and hurries over.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I'm sorry, Mr. Langford. (To PUPKIN,
dialog: angrily) How did you get in?
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: That's alright, Vincent. Mr. Pupkin's a
dialog: friend of mine.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: Oh, I see.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: That's alright. Now if you'd be good enough
dialog: to find us a nice table.
text: PUPKIN pushes a five dollar bill into VINCENT's hand.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Certainly. This way, please.
text: VINCENT leads PUPKIN and LANGFORD to the "bullpen," a
text: select spot in a corner of the restaurant.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Here you are. Enjoy your lunch, gentlemen.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Is Eddie here today, Vincent?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I'll send him over.
text: A WAITER arrives and hands them the menu.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Our specialty today is Rizzofino Dolce Acqua
dialog: a la Marinara con Spezi. Very good.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Sounds like a new opera.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Fine. What comes with it?
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Me.
text: The three laugh.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Fine. For two.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Very good.
text: The WAITER leaves.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You look tired, Jerry.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: It shows, does it? It's all these problems
dialog: with the show. That and the custody suit.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I was sorry to read about that, Jerry.
dialog: Charlene never should have gotten the
dialog: kids. If there's anything I can do.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: I appreciate it, Rube. Just talking about
dialog: it a little with you helps.
text: Eddie arrives. He is a small, slightly-bald man with
text: greying hair and a goatee. He wears a foulard under an
text: open-necked shirt. He carries a long sketch pad. He
text: immediately sets up a small easel and starts sketching.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Hasn't Eddie already done you?
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Never mind. You were saying ...
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Well, I've been giving a lot of thought
dialog: to your situation, Jerry, ever since I
dialog: saw you starting to lose ground in the
dialog: ratings. And I think I know what the
dialog: problem is. Too many of the same faces.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Sure, people are getting tired of these
dialog: people who live off game shows and talk
dialog: shows and can't really do anything. They've
dialog: seen 'em and heard 'em till they can't
dialog: stand it anymore.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: You know, maybe you're right, Rube.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I'm sure I am. When a show runs out of
text: surprises, it loses its audience.
text: A YOUNG GIRL stands before PUPKIN and LANGFORD. She hands
text: PUPKIN her autograph book.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: What's your name, dear?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Dolores.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (writing)
dialog: To Dolores, who sensed greatness.
dialog: Rupert Pupkin.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (reading it)
dialog: Thanks, Mr. Pupkin.
text: The GIRL leaves.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You see what I mean? What you need on the
dialog: show is some unknown quantity, some brilliant
dialog: talent making his television debut. Imagine
dialog: the suspense. Who is this young guy? How
dialog: will he do with the eyes of all America on
dialog: him? Something like that has got to help.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: And that's where you come in.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Why not? Believe me, Jerry, I'd give you
dialog: the credit you deserve and I'll stick with
dialog: you. Anytime you need me, I'll be there,
text: doing a few minutes at Guild scale.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: I'd be grateful, Rube. I really would.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: All finished, Mr. Langford.
text: EDDIE turns the caricature so PUPKIN and LANGFORD can see
text: it. It's a picture of the two of them, facing each other
text: and smiling.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Oh, Jerry, you sneaky ...
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Looks good, Eddie.
text: The WAITER arrives with a bottle of champagne.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: WAITER
text: Compliments of Mr. Sardi.
text: EDDIE hangs the picture of LANGFORD and PUPKIN on the wall
text: behind them among the hundreds of other caricatures --
text: from Bankhead to Sid Caesar to Bette Davis. The CAMERA
text: PANS over these. We hear the champagne pop.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN'S VOICE
dialog: How does your afternoon look?
speaker_heading: LANGFORD'S VOICE
dialog: What have you got in mind?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN'S VOICE
dialog: Well, we've still got time to catch
text: the Cubs and the Mets out at Shea.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD'S VOICE
dialog: Why not? But first, a toast. To you,
dialog: Rube and your success.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN'S VOICE
dialog: Thanks, Jerry.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: 5 EXT: U.N. PLAZA - NIGHT
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Thanks, Jerry.
text: PUPKIN takes LANGFORD's handkerchief and folds it
text: reverentially, tucking it carefully into his breast pocket.
text: He claps his hands together a few times for joy and
text: dashes into the street to hail a cab.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 6 INT: LANGFORD'S APARTMENT
text: LANGFORD enters his apartment. It is tasteful, modern,
text: spacious and empty. A floodlight shines on a single
text: setting at the end of a long dinner table. He walks over
text: to a large aquarium and sprinkles some food for the fish.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: (to the fish)
dialog: Say hello to Jerry.
text: On a shelf above the aquarium stand three pictures, one of
text: two boys, roughly eight and eleven, flanked by a shot of
text: each boy alone. LANGFORD walks to the end of the table
text: where a covered dish and a New York Post await him. He
text: lifts the covered dish which reveals a large, cold salmon.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: (to the fish)
dialog: Say hello to Jerry.
text: LANGFORD begins poking at the fish with his fork. The
text: phone rings. He answers it.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE
dialog: It's Marsha, Jerry. Did you get my note?
dialog: I left it on the back seat. Did you get it?
dialog: I dropped it there before they pulled me
dialog: out. Those guys hurt me, Jerry. (pause)
dialog: Jerry?
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: (icily)
dialog: Who gave you this number?
speaker_heading: MARSHA'S VOICE
dialog: Don't be angry with me, Jerry. I didn't
dialog: know what else to do; I've been trying
dialog: you every five minutes, I miss you,
dialog: baby ... Jerry?
text: LANGFORD hangs up the phone and then takes it off the receiver.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Say goodbye to Jerry.
text: He shakes his head wearily, returns to his dinner and turns
text: to the inside pages of the New York Post.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 7 EXT: LEXINGTON AVENUE IN THE SIXTIES - NIGHT
text: A cab pulls up in front of an all-night florist shop.
text: PUPKIN dashes out of the cab and into the florist's.
text: The cab waits.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 8 EXT: LEXINGTON AVENUE IN THE SIXTIES - NIGHT
text: PUPKIN dashes out of the florist's clutching a single red
text: rose. He hops back into the cab which starts moving.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 9 EXT: A STREET OFF BROADWAY - NIGHT
text: The cab pulls up in front of Gil's Steaks and Chops, a
dialog: restaurant of little distinction that has a few checkered
text: tableclothed tables in the rear and a long bar at the
text: front. PUPKIN stares through the window of the bar at
text: RITA, the bargirl, an attractive, somewhat shopworn blonde
text: in her late twenties. PUPKIN enters.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 10 INT: BAR-RESTAURANT
text: PUPKIN goes to the near end of the sparsely-populated bar.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Miss!
text: RITA comes over. PUPKIN smiles knowingly.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: A beer please, Miss. Something imported.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Heineken's alright?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Fine.
text: RITA serves him a Heineken's. She stares at him, searching
text: his face.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: How have you been, Rita?
text: She stares again.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You're not Rupert Pupkin!
text: PUPKIN smiles broadly.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: How the hell did you find me?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Sally Gardner, I met her after a matinee.
dialog: Aren't you glad to see me?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Sure, sure. How is old Sally?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: The same, I guess. You know, two kids,
dialog: a nice husband, living in Clifton.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It figures.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: A lot of the kids in our class have
dialog: moved back.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I just thought I'd say hello. Here,
dialog: I brought you a little something.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (recognizing his style)
dialog: Oh, yeah, Mr. Romance.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Don't forget to put in an aspirin.
dialog: It lasts longer.
text: RITA fills a glass of water and puts in the rose.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Nothing's gonna keep it alive in this place.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: How have you been, dear, sweet Rita?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I don't have an aspirin.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Maybe a Rolaids would work.
text: PUPKIN pulls out a pack of Rolaids and hands one to RITA
text: who smiles vaguely and drops it into the glass.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Well, what are you up to these days,
dialog: Rupert?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Didn't you know you'd see me again?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You still going to the movies?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You're looking as beautiful as ever.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Oh, yeah. I was a real knockout.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I thought so.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Well, here I am. Local cheerleader
dialog: makes good.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I voted for you for Most Beautiful.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I didn't have the nerve to tell you then,
dialog: but I guess it's alright now.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Well, nothing terrible's gonna happen,
dialog: if that's what you mean.
text: There is an awkward pause. PUPKIN stares admiringly at
speaker_heading: RITA.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Well, how are things with you, Rupert?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Great! Everything's starting to break.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Is that right?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Yeah. As a matter of fact, that's why
dialog: I'm here. I've known about this place
dialog: for a long time. I just didn't want
dialog: to make my move until I had something
dialog: to offer you. Everything's a question
dialog: of timing.
text: RITA stares at PUPKIN as he rattles on.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: What's the matter?
text: RITA shakes her head in disbelief and chuckles.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Jesus Christ, Rupert Pupkin!
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: The two of us are often confused. He's
dialog: the one with the famous father.
text: PUPKIN waits for a laugh. RITA just keeps shaking her
text: head. PUPKIN looks around.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (critically)
dialog: You like this place?
text: RITA shrugs.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Why, you got something better?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: What are you doing tonight?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Tonight?
text: RITA starts laughing.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (smiling reluctantly)
dialog: What's so funny?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (still laughing)
dialog: You call me up all junior and senior year.
dialog: Night after night after night, right? And
dialog: every time I'm wondering 'when is this guy
dialog: going to stop talking and ask me out?'
dialog: Well, now I know the answer. August
text: twelfth, nineteen seventy-six. It only
dialog: took you ten, eleven years to work up to it.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: If I had asked you out? Would you
dialog: have gone?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Oh, no.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Why not?
text: RITA starts laughing again.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Because I thought you were a jerk!
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You see! I was right! But that guy isn't
text: me anymore. I look at my picture in the
dialog: yearbook and I don't even recognize myself.
dialog: I'm not the same guy, Rita.
text: A bull-necked MAN in his early forties enters. He waves
text: a brief hello to RITA as he walks by. RITA smiles and
text: the MAN takes a seat at the far end of the bar.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Rita!
speaker_heading: RITA
speaker_heading: (to PUPKIN)
dialog: Excuse me a minute, honey.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I'm not honey! I'm Rupert.
text: RITA goes to the far end of the bar and serves the MAN a
text: beer. They chat briefly as PUPKIN watches uneasily.
text: Finally PUPKIN downs his beer and raises his glass.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Miss! Miss!
text: The MAN gets RITA's attention for PUPKIN. RITA returns
text: to PUPKIN and serves him another beer.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I'm in the mood to celebrate tonight.
dialog: Why don't we go to this nice restaurant
dialog: I know, talk over and times, get to
dialog: know each other all over again.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: And then?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Well, tomorrow night I thought we'd
dialog: go out again, talk some more, get to
dialog: know each other even better.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: How much what?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: How much do we have to get to know
dialog: each other?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (emphatically)
dialog: How much do we have to get to know each
dialog: other before we start talking about
dialog: that job?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I'm not talking about any job.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Then what's this big offer you were
dialog: talking about?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You'll see. Right now I'm asking you
dialog: for a date. How about it?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I'm sorry, Rupert. But I'm busy.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Busy?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Yeah. Busy.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: But this is the biggest night of my life.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I've already got a date.
text: The MAN at the end of the bar raises his glass.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Rita!
text: RITA goes to the far end of the bar. She pours him another
text: beer and settles against the bar, resuming her chat with
text: him. PUPKIN looks for a moment and downs his beer. He
text: raises his glass.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Miss! Miss!
text: RITA returns to him.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Is that your date?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: None of your business.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: What do you want to go out with him for?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: He's a good friend of mine.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Tell him you're busy.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What's so important about tonight?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Everything! You don't understand.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: No. I don't. It's been really nice
dialog: seeing you, Rupert. Thanks for dropping
dialog: in. But I've got some work to do.
text: RITA leaves PUPKIN and returns to the far end of the bar
text: where she once again resumes talking with the MAN. PUPKIN
text: sits for a moment, gets up slowly and heads for the john.
scene_heading: 11 INT: THE JOHN - NIGHT
text: He enters the john and goes to the farthest of the three
text: urinals. A moment later, the MAN enters. He goes to the
text: nearest of the three urinals. The two men stare at the
text: wall before them but the obvious tension between them
text: renders them both incapable of relieving themselves.
text: PUPKIN glances over at the MAN's face, then immediately
text: turns back to the wall as the MAN turns to look at him.
text: The MAN glances quickly at PUPKIN and then returns to
text: staring at the wall. PUPKIN sneaks a furtive glance at
text: the MAN's penis. The MAN sneaks a furtive glance at
text: PUPKIN's penis.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 12 INT: THE BAR - NIGHT
text: PUPKIN emerges from the john, followed a moment later by
text: the MAN. They resume their seats at each end of the bar.
text: A third MAN has come in and is seated midway between PUPKIN
speaker_heading: and the MAN.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Miss!
text: RITA walks over reluctantly.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Listen to me for a second.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I have work to do, Rupert.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Just listen. I'm at the start of
dialog: something really big. I don't want
dialog: to talk about it here but it's going
dialog: to happen soon and it's going to be
dialog: great -- for both of us.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: No kidding?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: So see that guy some other night.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Rita!
text: RITA turns to go.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: But I haven't finished!
text: RITA returns to the MAN and pours him another beer. PUPKIN
text: sits for a few moments, then downs his beer quickly. Again,
text: he raises his glass.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Miss! Miss!
text: The MAN leans over the bar and tells RITA something. She
text: opens a bottle of beer and hands it to the MAN who slides
text: it down the bar towards PUPKIN. As the beer reaches the
text: middle of the bar, the THIRD MAN seated midway between
text: PUPKIN and the MAN raises his beer glass to take a sip just
text: as the sliding beer bottle passes under his hand. The
text: bottle stops right in front of PUPKIN who takes it and
text: slides it back with equal force. At this moment, the THIRD
text: MAN in the middle has finished his sip and has just placed
text: the THIRD MAN's glass on the counter. The beer bottle
text: collides with the THIRD MAN's glass, creating a mess. RITA
text: glares at PUPKIN as does the THIRD MAN. PUPKIN shrugs an
text: apology and RITA cleans up the mess.
speaker_heading: RITA
speaker_heading: (to the THIRD MAN)
dialog: I'll get you another one.
text: As RITA cleans up the mess and pours a fresh beer, the MAN
text: walks down the bar towards PUPKIN. He leans over him and
text: puts a supposedly friendly paw on his shoulder. PUPKIN
text: glances distastefully at the MAN's hand on him.
speaker_heading: MAN
speaker_heading: (to PUPKIN)
dialog: Look, friend. I'm trying to have a
dialog: nice civilized conversation with the
dialog: young lady. Be a good little lad,
dialog: huh, and give us a break.
text: PUPKIN looks up at the MAN who pats him on the back in a
text: gesture of fraudulent friendship and menace. PUPKIN burps.
text: With an effort, the MAN controls his temper and returns to
text: his seat at the end of the bar. PUPKIN instantly raises
text: his glass.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Miss! Miss!
text: The MAN advances towards PUPKIN with another bottle of
text: beer. PUPKIN watches passively as the MAN pours half the
text: bottle into PUPKIN's breast pocket and slams the half-empty
text: bottle on the counter. The MAN walks down to the end of
text: the counter where a smiling RITA is waiting.
text: PUPKIN again gulps his beer down. RITA and the MAN stare
text: at PUPKIN expecting him to raise his glass and call for
text: another beer. PUPKIN just sits there. After a few
text: moments, RITA and the MAN resume their conversation, but
text: they keep glancing over at PUPKIN, expecting him to
text: interrupt them with a call for beer at any moment. PUPKIN
text: continues to sit there. Just as RITA and the MAN have
text: settled back into their conversation, PUPKIN falls like a
text: stone from the barstool onto the floor. He lies
text: motionless. RITA and the MAN look at PUPKIN for a moment
text: while the handful of other patrons glance at him and return
text: to their drinks. RITA leaves the bar and goes to the rear
text: of the restaurant, disappearing into the kitchen. As she
text: does, the MAN walks over to where PUPKIN is lying inert
text: and prods him cruelly with his foot.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: C'mon, schmuck, wake up so I can
dialog: kick your ass outta here.
text: The MAN turns to the kitchen to see if RITA is returning.
text: As he does, PUPKIN carefully opens one eye, grabs a free
text: chair from a nearby cocktail table, rises and bangs the MAN
text: smartly over the head. The MAN falls, out cold. PUPKIN
text: straightens up quickly as the other patrons look on with
text: interest. PUPKIN brushes off his suit, which is blue, just
text: like the MAN's, and stands above the MAN just as the MAN
text: stood above him, his back to kitchen. RITA emerges from
text: the kitchen with the owner, MR. NICHOLS and a large black
speaker_heading: COOK.
speaker_heading: RITA
speaker_heading: (to NICHOLS)
dialog: He was making trouble one minute
text: and the next he was on the floor.
text: RITA automatically reaches out as she talks for what she
text: thinks is the MAN's arm. Instead, PUPKIN turns around
text: smiling, leaving her too startled to speak. NICHOLS and
text: the COOK lift the MAN to his feet.
speaker_heading: COOK
dialog: Okay, buddy, here we go.
text: NICHOLS and the COOK lead the MAN, who is still groggy, out
text: of the bar as RITA continues to stare at PUPKIN with a
text: mixture of curiosity and amusement.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Okay, Tarzan. Where do we eat tonight?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 13 INT: CHINESE RESTAURANT ON UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT
text: We are in the kitchen watching two dishes being chopped,
text: shredded and boiled in deep fat. The activity is frantic.
text: WE FOLLOW the two dishes as a WAITER carries them from the
text: kitchen to a booth where PUPKIN and RITA are talking. It
text: is a painfully plain restaurant, shaped in a rectangle,
text: with booths lining either side and a row of little tables
text: in between. At the back is the kitchen and two phone
text: booths, facing each other. An old Chinese WOMAN mans the
text: cash register by the door. The WAITER sets the dishes down
text: before RITA and PUPKIN and clears an enormous plate of
text: spare rib bones from RITA's place. RITA hands the WAITER
text: her empty cocktail glass. RITA and PUPKIN are facing one
dialog: another.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Another one, Chan.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (to WAITER)
dialog: Chopsticks, please.
text: The WAITER nods and leaves.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: So all this time you've been thinking
dialog: about me, huh?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: That's right, Rita.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What kinds of things were you thinking?
text: PUPKIN drops his eyes shyly. RITA starts laughing.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Oh, ho! Those kinds of things! Shame
dialog: on you, Rupert.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Rita, I assure you there was ...
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person!
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Come on, Rita. People will hear.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (in a whisper)
dialog: Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person. Oh,
dialog: come on, Rupert. Relax. Have a little fun.
text: WAITER arrives with RITA's drink and chopsticks and a beer
speaker_heading: for PUPKIN.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: This is a very important evening to me,
dialog: Rita.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Did you know your nose wiggled when
dialog: you talked?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: It does?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Yeah. Just the tip. Like a rabbit.
dialog: (pause) Hey, are we gonna eat or
dialog: what? I'm starving.
text: PUPKIN serves RITA.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It always looks like they put worms
dialog: in this stuff.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Just taste.
dialog: RITA tastes.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Well, I guess it won't kill me.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: This is supposed to be the finest
dialog: Cantonese cuisine in the city.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Yeah? Then what happened to the
dialog: tablecloths?
text: PUPKIN drops his eyes.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Oh, don't worry about it. This is
dialog: fine. (She takes a long drink) I'm
dialog: having a good time. So you've been
dialog: devoted to me, huh?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I used to see you at the Garden
dialog: every year.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Oh, the Follies. That was the right
dialog: name for 'em. How did you know which
dialog: one was me? We all looked like chickens.
dialog: What I mean is, we all looked like the
dialog: same chicken. I thought it was gonna be
dialog: Rita Keane in the Ice Follies and I
text: wind up looking like Henny Penny.
text: RITA chuckles to herself.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You just didn't get the breaks.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Breaks, bullshit! My parents didn't
dialog: have the money for the right coach.
dialog: But what difference does it make?
text: She starts laughing to herself.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I remember once we were down in
dialog: Atlanta and the ice machine broke
dialog: down. We did three hours of slush.
text: Everyone was falling on their faces
text: and hopping up with their arms open
dialog: for a bow like the whole thing was
dialog: planned. And the people ate it up.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I liked the show.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Yeah? The Follies? You really must
dialog: have been carrying the torch. What
dialog: did you think when I got married?
dialog: You knew I got married?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I knew it wouldn't last.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You think I should have married you,
dialog: instead, huh?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Peter Drysdale! Really, Rita!
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: If he'd only been hit by a train.
dialog: He was worth a helluva lot more dead
dialog: than alive, I can tell you that.
text: RITA raises her glass to the WAITER who is standing nearby,
text: talking with another WAITER. As she does, a nice-looking
text: young MAN sitting in the middle aisle raises his glass of
text: beer to her and drinks it, as a kind of toast. RITA
text: smiles briefly and her eyes return to PUPKIN. The YOUNG
text: MAN is seated behind PUPKIN, facing RITA. The WAITER comes
text: over and collects the glass. Throughout the rest of the
text: scene, a subtle flirtation continues between RITA and the
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Are you seeing anyone?
text: RITA starts for a moment, thinking PUPKIN has caught her
text: looking at the YOUNG MAN.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I want to know about the competition,
dialog: that's all.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Well, tomorrow night, I've got a date
dialog: with Joe Namath -- you know Joe. And
dialog: Thursday --- let's see --
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I'm serious, Rita.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (imitating him)
dialog: I'm serious, Rita. (In her own voice)
dialog: Sure I see people. I'm not a nun, Rupert.
dialog: I see a lot of people.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Anyone special?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: You mean am I "going steady"? Rupert,
dialog: I'm thirty-one years old!
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: What about that guy tonight?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Him?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Why him?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What am I supposed to do, huh? Sit
dialog: home watching TV? He's just some guy.
dialog: He's got his own aluminum siding
text: business. He comes into the city
dialog: sometimes, that's all.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You don't go out with him for his
dialog: money?!?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Oh, horrors! Look, Rupert, what do
dialog: you think they pay me in that dump?
dialog: Ninety-five bucks. And you don't get
dialog: the world's greatest tippers in there
dialog: either. Somebody has to take care of
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: That's what I want to talk to you
dialog: about, Rita.
text: The WAITER arrives with RITA's drink.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Who's your favorite movie star?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You are, Rupert. Especially your nose.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Just tell me.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Is this some kind of game? Are you
dialog: going to tell me something about my
dialog: character?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You'll see. Give me his name.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I can't think of anybody.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You've got to have one, Rita. Everybody
dialog: does.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Okay. Okay. Let's see. (pause)
dialog: Marilyn Monroe.
text: PUPKIN slowly pulls out a leather-bound book from his
text: inside jacket pocket.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Oh, Rupert! Are we going to exchange
dialog: phone numbers!?
text: PUPKIN expertly flips to a middle page in the book and,
text: keeping the book open, his finger pointing under a name,
text: he turns the book to RITA.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: That's her name.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Her name! She signed this herself,
dialog: especially for me.
text: RITA starts flipping through the book, curious about the
text: other names. She isn't paying any attention to what PUPKIN
dialog: is saying.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: She wasn't a great actress but she had
dialog: a real gift for comedy. She died
dialog: tragically, you know, alone, like so
dialog: many of the world's most beautiful
dialog: women. I'm going to see that doesn't
dialog: happen to you, Rita.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Who's this one?
text: PUPKIN checks the book.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Burt Reynolds.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Oh yeah, the guy with no clothes.
dialog: Who's this?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Mel Brooks.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: And this?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Carol Burnett.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: No kidding. How about this?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Glenda Jackson.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Never heard of her.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (pointing to other names)
dialog: And that's Woody Allen and there's
dialog: Ernie Kovacs -- he's dead -- and that
dialog: one's Lauren Bacall.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You don't really know any of these
dialog: people?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Take a look at this.
text: PUPKIN flips to one of the back pages and shows a name to
speaker_heading: RITA.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (squinting)
dialog: I can't make it out.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Try.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: This is really weird handwriting!
text: Exasperated, PUPKIN follows the name in question with his
dialog: index finger.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Rooooper ....
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (guessing)
dialog: Redford!
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: That's Robert Redford.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It is?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: No! It's ... it's Rupert Pupkin
text: PUPKIN tears out the page and hands it to her shyly. RITA
text: just stares at it and back at PUPKIN.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Don't lose it. It's going to be worth
dialog: something in a couple of weeks.
text: RITA start laughing.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: That's what I've been trying to tell
dialog: you. Things are really breaking for
dialog: me. I'm ticketed for stardom.
text: RITA laughs harder, despite efforts to be serious.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Only a couple of hours ago, I was
dialog: talking to Jerry Langford, the Jerry
dialog: Langford. Stop it, Rita!
text: RITA pulls herself together for a moment.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: We were talking about my doing my act
dialog: on his show.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (suppressing a smile)
dialog: Your act?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Get that guy you knew from Clifton out
dialog: of your head right now. You're looking
dialog: at Rupert Pupkin, Rita. Rupert Pupkin,
dialog: the new King of Comedy.
text: RITA starts laughing hysterically, in spite of herself.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (getting a grip on herself)
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Why not me, Rita? A guy can always
dialog: get what he wants if he's willing to
dialog: pay the price. All it takes is a
dialog: little talent and sacrifice and the
dialog: right break. If you've got a friend
dialog: in the right place, that's all it
dialog: takes. And that's exactly what I
dialog: have going for me right now. After
dialog: all, crazier things have happened.
text: RITA listens silently for a moment, then begins to giggle.
text: As PUPKIN resumes speaking, we CUT between RITA and the
text: YOUNG MAN. Their flirtation picks up steam. The YOUNG MAN
text: raises his eyebrows as if to ask, "Are you interested in
text: me?" She smiles. All the while, PUPKIN rattles on.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You just don't realize what a shot on
dialog: the Langford Show can mean. That's
dialog: coast to coast, national TV, a bigger
dialog: audience than the greatest comedians
dialog: used to play to in a lifetime. A shot
dialog: like that means a free ticket on the
dialog: comedy circuit -- Flip Wilson one week,
dialog: Cosby the next, then Sonny and Cher or
dialog: Carol Burnett. And you've always got
dialog: those other talk shows to fall back on
dialog: -- Carson, Griffin. And all that leads
dialog: straight in one direction, Rita --
dialog: Hollywood! That's when we really start
dialog: living. How does this sound to you --
text: a beach house in Malibu, right on the
dialog: ocean. You'll get a beautiful tan,
dialog: believe me. And we'd keep a suite at
dialog: the Sherry. That's the only place to
dialog: stay when you're big. We could get
text: something on a top floor and look down
dialog: on all our old friends in Clifton and
dialog: just laugh. How does that sound to you?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It sounds wonderful, Rupert, and I
dialog: really hope you get what you want.
dialog: But it's getting late and I'm a working
dialog: girl. You know what I mean?
text: The telephone at the back of the restaurant starts ringing.
text: A WAITER in the background moves slowly to answer it.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You going to spend the rest of your
dialog: life in that place? Is that what you
dialog: really want, talking about nothing with
dialog: nothings? I thought you wanted something
dialog: a little better than that and that's what
dialog: I'm offering. Every King needs a Queen,
dialog: Rita. I want you to be mine. What do
dialog: you say?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You really want to help me out? You
text: see this. (She points to her lower
dialog: back molar) A hundred seventy-five
dialog: bucks. If you could spare fifty, say,
dialog: until next Monday, that would keep
dialog: three people really happy -- me, my
dialog: landlord and my dentist.
text: During RITA's speech, the WAITER has been working his way
text: from the phone booth towards the front of the restaurant.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Telephone for you, Miss.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (looking puzzled)
dialog: Me? Nobody knows I'm here. You didn't
dialog: tell anybody, did you?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: What the hell's going on?
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS RITA, who walks to the back of the
text: restaurant and picks up the dangling receiver in one of
text: the two facing booths, the other of which is occupied.
scene_heading: 14 INT: THE PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Hello?

speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Who do you think it is? I've been
dialog: staring at you all evening.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Where are you?
text: The YOUNG MAN taps forcefully with his index finger on the

text: around and finds herself staring at the YOUNG MAN. She
dialog: smiles.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 15 INT: THE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: PUPKIN at the table looking over the check. He gets out a

dialog: high spirits.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (with repressed gaiety)
dialog: You know who that was -- the bar. I
dialog: have to go back to work.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: How did they know you were here?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (gathering her things)
dialog: I guess I must have told them. They
dialog: need someone right away.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (accusingly)
dialog: You don't even care, do you?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Oh, no. I do. Really!
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: It's not the bar, Rita. Don't tell
dialog: me it's the bar.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Don't be angry. It has nothing to
dialog: do with you. I had a nice dinner,
dialog: really. It was great seeing you
dialog: again.
text: PUPKIN stare at her icily.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Come on. Let's see a smile.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Why don't we finish the evening up
dialog: at the bar together? End the evening
dialog: where it began?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: After what happened there?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Well, I could at least drop you off!
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (hurriedly making up her face)
dialog: That's okay. Really. I can manage.
dialog: Why don't you just go to a movie or
dialog: something? Don't let me spoil your
dialog: evening.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: But that wouldn't be right.
text: RITA gets up and stands before PUPKIN.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: Look, Rupert. It's been a lot of fun,
dialog: really. I'll see you sometime, huh?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: But Rita!
text: RITA starts moving towards the door.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Come on, Rupert. I'm in a hurry.
text: RITA marches out with PUPKIN trailing behind. He throws

scene_heading: 16 EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN as he streaks out the door and jumps
text: into the adjacent doorway, immediately peering down the
text: street. He spies the YOUNG MAN and RITA walking about
text: three quarters of a block down and follows them, keeping
text: out of sight. They turn occasionally to see if he's
text: around, then stop turning. They go around the corner and
text: disappear into a large apartment building. PUPKIN rushes
text: after them, positioning himself across from the building.
text: He searches the windows for some clue as to where they
text: have gone. Finally a set of lights go on on the fourth
text: floor and a MAN's shadow is seen closing two sets of
text: blinds.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 17 INT: THE APARTMENT BUILDING FOYER - NIGHT
text: PUPKIN enters the building and finds himself in a small
text: entranceway. The door to the lobby is locked. Next to
text: the door, on the wall, are listed the tenants, their
text: apartment numbers and a button next to each name. There is
text: an intercom speaker. There are eight apartments listed on
text: the fourth floor, running from 4A to 4H. PUPKIN looks them
text: over, takes a deep breath and pushes 4A.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 18 INT: YOUNG MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: It is an extremely well-furnished studio apartment with all
dialog: the requirements of a contemporary bachelor pad -- an
text: imitation bearskin rug, nice bookshelves including an
text: elaborate stereo system, recessed lighting, including a
text: soft spotlight on the Queen-sized bed with its pseudo-satin
text: cover. The YOUNG MAN and RITA stand in the middle of the
text: room. RITA looks about uneasily. No intercom buzzer sounds.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Welcome to the pleasure dome.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You don't kid around, do you?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I do alright. What's your libation?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Your potion. Your drink.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Bourbon and soda. Make it light.
text: The YOUNG MAN goes to his chic little bar and starts fixing
text: RITA a strong bourbon and soda. He also fixes himself a
text: strong scotch and water. As he works, they talk.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: You from the South?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: That's what Southern people drink.
text: Lots of bourbon.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What do people from Jersey drink?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: I make it a point to study things
dialog: like that. It's important to know
dialog: people's backgrounds, their tastes,
dialog: their culture. It gives you a little
dialog: head start.
text: The YOUNG MAN turns from the bar and hands RITA her drink.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: I'm Chet. Whom do I have the
dialog: pleasure of serving?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I'm Mary.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN

speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE

speaker_heading: PUPKIN

speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE

speaker_heading: PUPKIN

speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Leisure is America's fastest growing
dialog: industry. Did you know that? Think
dialog: about it. Short work weeks, more
dialog: vacation. People need something to
dialog: do with all that time and that's where
dialog: I come in. Leisure Villages, Inc.
dialog: We buy land an hour or so outside
dialog: your metropolitan centers. We set
dialog: up the bungalows, dig some lakes, lay
dialog: out a golf course, you know, fix the
dialog: whole place up so it's usable. Then
dialog: young, personable guys like me show
dialog: the people around. It the guy seems
dialog: tight, we point out the investment
dialog: factor. If he's a swinger, well,

dialog: he's a sports nut, we talk up skiing

speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: What's your work, Mary?

speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Did you know that you have remarkable

speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Yeah? You know what? I feel like

speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Now?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Sure. Why not? It's only twenty of

text: The YOUNG MAN takes her hands and looks deep into her eyes.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Why don't we make our own movie?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: No. I don't think so.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Don't be so uptight. Give it a chance.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I want to go to the movies, that's all.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: We can go to the movies later.
text: RITA pulls her hands away.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Let's stop playing games, okay.
dialog: I'm not a kid.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: You have something against pleasure?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I'm just not interested in being

speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Shall I freshen up your drink?

speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Look, if you've got sexual problems
dialog: let's talk about them. It helps

speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: There's nothing wrong with me.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Then it's me?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I don't even know you.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Then find out. Sex is a great way

speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: I'm sure this could lead to something
dialog: beautiful.
text: The YOUNG MAN kisses RITA roughly.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Passive resistance, huh?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Let's just write this thing off as

speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: What's wrong with me?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Nothing. I just want to go home.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN

speaker_heading: RITA

speaker_heading: RITA

speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Afterwards, you'll thank me.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 31 INT: THE ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT

speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (in desperation)
dialog: What do you want?

speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Don't be angry with me. I was worried

speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Just go home and leave me alone.

speaker_heading: PUPKIN

speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I'm so bad. I'm such a dummy.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN

dialog: feet.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER'S VOICE
dialog: Stuff it, big spender!
text: PUPKIN pays no attention. He walks RITA to her front
dialog: stoop.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Well, I guess you're entitled to come
dialog: up for coffee.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: That's okay, Rita. You're tired and

speaker_heading: RITA

speaker_heading: PUPKIN

dialog: chance.
text: RITA just shakes her head sadly.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Look, what if I arranged it so you
dialog: could meet Jerry? You'd have to
dialog: believe me if you heard it from him.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: There's no ...
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I'll arrange that, Rita. We'll all
dialog: go out to dinner some night or maybe
dialog: out to his place, on a weekend. You'll
dialog: see. The trouble with you is you've
dialog: got no faith. Now go to bed and get a
dialog: good rest and I'll see you in a couple
dialog: of days.

speaker_heading: PUPKIN

text: it looks to PUPKIN in the booth -- that cavalcade of
text: hustlers, whores, housewives, kids, weirdos and working
text: people; and SHOTS of various people waiting to use the
text: phone -- their impatience, anger, disgust. Each time one
text: of them arrives, PUPKIN pretends to thumb through the phone
text: book and dial a number. WE WATCH him chatting with
text: animation until the waiting party leaves. Then WE SEE him
text: push the coin return to retrieve his dime. Finally, PUPKIN

dialog: Take note of that, you ladies.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: As a matter of fact, yesterday I went

speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: I see. (Into the phone) He says Mr.

speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Sure. Sure. But that's not necessary,

speaker_heading: PUPKIN

speaker_heading: CATHY LONG

speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Look. Did Jerry say anything about
dialog: me last night?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I'm really in a hurry, Marsha ...
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Was he angry? ... In the car last night,
dialog: I saw you. Did he talk about me?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I thought that was you. That was
dialog: some stunt.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: We didn't talk about you.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: You know Jerry?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Yeah.
text: MARSHA thrusts an envelope into PUPKIN's hands.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Give him this for me.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Why don't you ...
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Because I can't! Please. I need
dialog: your help. You'll be my friend forever.
dialog: Come on. I'll buy you something.
dialog: What do you want?
text: She takes a great messy bunch of bills out of her raincoat
text: pockets and jams them into PUPKIN's hands.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I don't want this.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Take it. I can get all I want.
text: PUPKIN shrugs and pockets the money.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Okay. I'll try.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: (turning cold)
dialog: Don't try. Do it. Remember. We
dialog: just made a deal.
text: PUPKIN stares at the envelope.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: And don't open it. It's private.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Okay. Okay.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: How soon can you get it to him?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I don't know. Couple a days.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: (menacingly)
dialog: You'd better.
text: MARSHA turns and walks in the direction from which they
text: came. CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN who walks on for a block or
text: so, then opens the envelope. It contains a set of
text: apartment keys, a scrap of hand-knitted woolen cloth and a
dialog: note in lipstick that reads: "I've made you a sweater,
dialog: honey. Come try it on. I miss you. Love, M. 74 East
dialog: 83rd Street, Apartment 2B!" He takes out the money
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: gave him. There are wads of tens, twenties and fifties
text: with a sprinkling of fives and ones.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 44 EXT: A TIMES SQUARE HOTEL - DAY
text: The hotel is just one step up from a flophouse. WE SEE
text: PUPKIN enter.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 45 INT: PUPKIN'S ROOM - DAY
text: PUPKIN enters. WE SEE that it is a small room, furnished
text: by the hotel in the plainest way. Nicely-done home-made
text: collages of show business figures decorate the drab green
text: walls. The room is neat and clean. PUPKIN goes directly
text: to a plain table which holds two tape recorders -- one a
text: small cassette the other a large table tape recorder. He
text: picks up the microphone of the larger one and speaks into
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Testing. Testing. Testing.
text: In the following montage, we hear in the background the
dialog: replay of his "testing, testing testing" and various
text: other noises -- a bit of his voice taped, a burst of
text: laughter, the squeal of a tape recorder sent fast-forward,
text: a sudden burst of applause, a scrap of theme music. At the
text: same time, the CAMERA PANS about the room. We look
text: at the collages which include all the obvious show business
text: figures, with a heavy emphasis on comedians from Chaplin
text: and Keaton to Sid Caesar and Woody Allen. The collages
dialog: also include such varied figures as Jimmy Carter, Julia
dialog: Childs, Tom Seaver, David Brinkley, Muhammad Ali, Clifford
text: Irving, Walter Cronkite and Mark Spitz. There is a special
text: Kennedy section -- John F. and Bobby framed in black,
text: Jackie in mourning and a picture of Teddy. There is also a
text: trio of assassins -- Sirhan, Oswald and James Earl Ray.
text: There is also a talk show collage with a photo of Langford
text: in the center like a sun surrounded by Snyder, Walters,
text: Carson and Griffin. One bookshelf holds a veritable
dialog: library of comedy -- joke books, biographies of comedians,
text: treasuries of American humor. Another shelf holds scores
text: of tapes in their own little boxes, each one neatly marked,
scene_heading: i.e., "LANGFORD MONOLOGUES: 7/5/72 to 9/9/72." "MISC.
scene_heading: MONOLOGUES 6/13/68 to 8/1/69."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: PUPKIN sitting before the tape recorder lost in thought.
text: Finally, he starts the larger recorder and lifts the mike.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: First, Miss Long. Thanks very much
dialog: for your help at the office and for
dialog: passing this along to Jerry. I
dialog: appreciate it more than you know.
text: PUPKIN stops the tape recorder and thinks again for a few
text: beats. He then starts the large recorder.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Now, Jerry. Before I begin, I just
dialog: want to thank you for listening to
dialog: this material and for the opportunity
dialog: that you've given me. You know, lots
dialog: of people think that guys like you,
dialog: you know, people who have made it,
dialog: lose their feeling for struggling
dialog: young talent such as myself. But
dialog: now I know from experience that those
dialog: people are just cynics, embittered
dialog: by their own failure. I know, Jerry,
dialog: that you're as human as the rest of us,
dialog: if not more so. (pause) Oh well, I
dialog: guess there's no point going on about
dialog: it. You know how I feel. So let's get
text: on with the show. The best of Rupert
dialog: Pupkin! I've sketched out this little
dialog: introduction in order to save you a
dialog: little time. So close your eyes and
dialog: imagine it's exactly six o'clock.
dialog: You're standing in the wings and we
dialog: hear Rick Ross and the Orchestra strike
dialog: up your theme song.
text: PUPKIN pushes a button on the cassette and we hear the
text: theme song of the Jerry Langford Show, followed by the
text: voice of BERT CANTER, the announcer.
speaker_heading: BERT CANTER'S VOICE
dialog: And now, direct from New York, it's
dialog: the Jerry Langford Show! Tonight,
dialog: with Jerry's special guest ...
text: PUPKIN deftly shuts off the cassette and substitutes his
text: own voice for that of CANTER's. The large tape recorder
text: keeps rolling.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: ... the comedy find of the year making
dialog: his television debut, Rupert Pupkin, the
dialog: King of Comedy!
text: PUPKIN rapidly races the cassette tape forward, then pushes
text: down the "play" button. We hear a burst of thundering
text: applause. PUPKIN lets the applause run for a while and
text: then shuts it off. The large recorder keeps rolling.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Now you come on, Jerry, and do your
text: monologue. Then, when the time comes,
dialog: this is how I see you introducing me.
dialog: You'll say something like this.
dialog: "Ladies and Gentlemen we're going to
dialog: do something a little bit different
dialog: tonight. It isn't often that you can
dialog: call someone a sure thing in the
dialog: entertainment business. After all,
dialog: the verdict is always in your hands.
dialog: But I think after you've met my next
dialog: guest, that you'll agree with me that
dialog: he's destined for greatness. So,
dialog: now, will you please give your warmest
dialog: welcome to the newest King of Comedy,
dialog: Rupert Pupkin!!!"
text: PUPKIN pushes the cassette and we hear another enormous
text: burst of applause. PUPKIN lets it run, listening intently.
text: He stands up and faces a wall of his room, still holding
text: the microphone. WE SEE that the wall is covered by a huge
text: blow-up of an audience laughing and applauding.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 45 INT: THE LANGFORD TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT
text: WE SEE a real audience laughing and applauding.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: PUPKIN strides triumphantly onto the stage, nodding to
text: acknowledge the applause. He stops center stage as the
text: television cameras maneuver about him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A SHOT of the "APPLAUSE" sign flashing, then stopping.
text: Still, the applause goes on.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: PUPKIN raises his hands to quiet the audience. After a few
text: moments the applause dies down, except for a pair of hands
text: in the center of the orchestra. PUPKIN peers out to see
text: who is still applauding.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: RITA, in the middle of the audience, applauds
text: enthusiastically.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: PUPKIN on stage. PUPKIN gives RITA a special smile and
dialog: nod.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Will somebody tell that lovely lady
text: that the applause sign is off.
text: The audience laughs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 46 INT: PUPKIN'S ROOM - DAY
text: PUPKIN stands facing the "audience" still holding the mike.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: That's a possible introduction, Jerry.
dialog: Now let's move on to my act.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 47 INT: THE RECEPTION AREA OF THE LANGFORD SHOW - DAY
text: PUPKIN is pacing. He is wearing another suit, this one a
text: broad-lapelled-grey. He is freshly shaved, is hair neatly
text: combed, his shoes carrying a bright shine. He clutches a
text: small flat box, neatly wrapped with the words 'FOR JERRY
text: LANGFORD" written clearly across the top in large print.
text: CATHY LONG emerges from one of the back corridors into the
dialog: reception area.
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (suddenly a bit shy)
dialog: I didn't want to take any chances
dialog: with this ... uh ... Miss Long, so I
dialog: ... uh ... thought I'd just bring it
dialog: here myself.
text: He hands CATHY LONG the package as though it contained
dialog: nitroglycerine.
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: We talked about this this morning,
dialog: did we, Mr. ... ?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Pupkin. Rupert Pupkin.
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: Oh, yes. It's been some day. (pause)
dialog: Well, I certainly appreciate your
dialog: bringing this over, Mr. Pupkin, and
dialog: we'll listen to it as soon as possible.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Fine. Er ... you don't have any idea
dialog: how soon that might be?
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: Well, you can try checking with us
dialog: tomorrow. We might know something
dialog: by then. Otherwise, it'll have to
dialog: be Monday.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: What if I just sort of waited around
dialog: here today, just in case? I'll stay
text: out of the way.
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: You'd just be wasting your time,
dialog: Mr. Pupkin. We won't know anything
text: until tomorrow at the earliest.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Oh, I wouldn't consider it a waste of
dialog: time at all. I'd be glad to do it.
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: Look, why don't you try us tomorrow.
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Tomorrow? ... Right. I'll do that.
dialog: Thanks a lot, Miss Long. And thank
dialog: Jerry.
text: CATHY LONG smiles at PUPKIN and goes, leaving PUPKIN
text: staring at a picture of LANGFORD on the wall. WE FIX on
text: LANGFORD a moment and PULL BACK to see LANGFORD in what
dialog: PUPKIN would imagine his office to be.
scene_heading: 48 INT: AN OFFICE - DAY
text: A large, corner office furnished in royal red, with high
text: ceilings and a huge desk. Potted palms and hydrangeas rest
text: on a marble floor. LANGFORD is moving about restlessly,
text: clutching PUPKIN's tape in one hand and waving it about.
text: PUPKIN is seated on a comfortable couch.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Dynamite! This is dynamite!
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (shyly)
dialog: You think so, Jerry?
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Look, I've been at this for fifteen
dialog: years, Rupert, and I haven't come up
dialog: with anything like this -- not me,
dialog: not any of my writers.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (smiling with obvious
dialog: pleasure)
dialog: Well, I'm glad you like it, Jerry.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Tell me something, Rube. (pause)
dialog: How do you do it? I'm not asking
dialog: to use the material myself. I just
dialog: want to know how you (LANGFORD waves
text: his arms in a gesture of frustration)
dialog: how you do it.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Well, I don't know if I can explain
dialog: it, really.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Come on. Try, Rube.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Well, it just sort of comes. I think
dialog: about my life, see, mainly about the
dialog: worst parts, all the awful things, and
text: I just try to see them in a funny light.
dialog: That's all.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: (eagerly)
dialog: Is that what you do? The worst parts,
dialog: and then you look at them in a funny
dialog: light? Is that what you do?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: More or less. It's hard to describe
dialog: how its happens.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: But that's just it, Rube. It doesn't
dialog: happen for me. Why do you think the
dialog: show is in so much trouble? By the
dialog: time I've done my monologue, everyone
dialog: has switched to Carson. Maybe if you
dialog: did a little writing ... ?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Sure, Jerry, I'd do anything I could
dialog: to help out.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: You would? Great. Why don't you
dialog: come out to my place this weekend
dialog: and we'll hash it out. I'm having
dialog: a few of my friends but we should be
dialog: able to get a little work in.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Would you mind if I brought someone?
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: A girl, Rube?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: A very special girl, Jerry.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: I'd love to meet her.
scene_heading: 49 THE HIGH-RISE OFFICE BUILDING ON UPPER BROADWAY - DAY
text: PUPKIN emerges, lost in thought. Suddenly he notices
text: MARSHA waiting nearby. She doesn't see PUPKIN. He sneaks
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 50 EXT: U.N. PLAZA - DAY
text: It is a bright morning. LANGFORD, attempting to camouflage
text: himself by wearing a cap over his eyes and his trench coat
text: collar turned up, his eyes hidden behind dark glasses,
text: walks out of the building. A DOORMAN is standing by the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: Cab, Jerry?
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: That's alright, thanks.
text: WE FOLLOW LANGFORD as he walks. Some people don't notice.
text: Others stare but leave him alone, a few commenting to their
text: companions and pointing at him. A CAB DRIVER pulls
dialog: alongside.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Hey, Jerry. My brother can sing
text: and juggle at the same time. How
dialog: about puttin' him on your show?
text: LANGFORD keeps walking.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: How about it, Jerry?
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Sorry, I'm off duty.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 51 EXT. A MANHATTAN STREET - DAY
text: LANGFORD stands at the corner, next to a middle-aged
speaker_heading: COUPLE.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You're Jerry!!
text: LANGFORD pulls his cap a little more tightly around his
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You know something. (She giggles)
dialog: I undress in front of you every night
dialog: and Larry here doesn't mind at all.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I can't get anything started with her
dialog: until you're off the air. Your show
dialog: is ruining my sex life, Jerry.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Well then, you'll just have to put
dialog: on a better show than I do.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: 52 EXT: BROADWAY, A FEW BLOCKS SOUTH OF LANGFORD'S OFFICES -
speaker_heading: DAY
text: WE WATCH LANGFORD continue to walk, feeling what it is to
dialog: be a celebrity out in public. After a few beats, we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 53 EXT: BROADWAY - DAY
text: WE SEE MARSHA trailing LANGFORD. LANGFORD notices her and
text: starts walking quickly. MARSHA walks quickly. LANGFORD
text: starts jogging. MARSHA starts jogging. Finally, LANGFORD
text: breaks into a sprint. MARSHA runs after him. LANGFORD
text: disappears into his office building. MARSHA arrives
text: several seconds later.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Jerry! God damnit!
text: Just as MARSHA turns around, PUPKIN, unaware of her, walks
text: cheerfully into the building.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 54 INT: RECEPTION AREA OF JERRY LANGFORD SHOW OFFICES - DAY
text: PUPKIN enters. The same middle-aged, plump RECEPTIONIST
text: is seated behind the desk.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Yes, sir? (recognizing him) Oh, hi.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Hi. How are you?
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Not bad.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I'd like to see Jerry, please.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: You are ... ?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Mr. Pupkin.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Just a minute.
text: The RECEPTIONIST dials a number.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Mr. Pupkin is here ... That's right
dialog: ... (to PUPKIN) She'll be with you
dialog: in a minute.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Miss Long.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: But I wanted to see Jerry.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Mr. Langford's not in. Miss Long
dialog: will take care of you.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Alright.
text: PUPKIN paces for a few beats. He smiles at the
text: RECEPTIONIST. A beat later, CATHY LONG comes out,
text: carrying the tape in its box.
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: Mr. Pupkin?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: How are you today?
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: Fine, Mr. Pupkin. Thank you for
dialog: your tape. We listened to it with
dialog: great interest. And, frankly, Mr. Pupkin,
dialog: we saw a lot of good things in what
dialog: you're doing. We feel you have good
dialog: potential. Very good potential.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: That's why I'll be honest with you,
dialog: Mr. Pupkin ...
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: We just don't think you're ready yet.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (baffled)
dialog: Not ready?
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: Well, we just don't feel right now
dialog: that you're right for Jerry.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (rapidly, half-listening)
dialog: Right for Jerry. Sure.
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: Some of the material ... some of the
dialog: one-liners, for instance ...
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: ... were not very strong.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You didn't care for some of the jokes,
dialog: is that it?
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: That"s right.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Good. Good. I can take care of
dialog: that right way. Thanks. Just tell
dialog: me the ones you think should go.
dialog: That would be a big help. (to the
dialog: RECEPTIONIST) This is great. (to
scene_heading: CATHY LONG) Which ones?
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: Well, it's not just that, Mr. Pupkin.
dialog: You see, Jerry likes to panel his
dialog: guests, you know, chat with them
dialog: afterwards.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Sure. Sure.
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: And frankly, we just don't feel you've
dialog: got very much to talk about right now.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: But I've got my whole life to talk
dialog: about!
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: Which is interesting to you, I'm sure
dialog: and to your wife ... and to a few
dialog: friends. But we feel that you should
dialog: keep developing your act. Test it in
dialog: some live situations. There are a
dialog: number of clubs in the city you can
dialog: try. And after a reasonable period,
dialog: get in touch with us again and we'll
dialog: be glad to send someone down to check
dialog: out your progress.
text: PUPKIN stares at her for a few moments as the tension grows.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: May I ask you a question, Miss Long?
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Are you speaking for Jerry?
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: Let's put it this way, Mr. Pupkin.
dialog: Mr. Langford has complete faith in
dialog: our judgment.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I'm sorry to have to say this, Miss
dialog: Long, and I certainly don't want you
dialog: to take it personally, but I have to
dialog: tell you that I don't ... I don't
dialog: have faith in your judgment.
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: Well, I'm sorry you feel that way,
dialog: Mr. Pupkin. But I'm afraid there's
dialog: nothing that can be done about that.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: No ... No ... I'm afraid I'll have
dialog: to disagree with you again.
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: (with strained politeness)
dialog: That's your privilege, Mr. Pupkin.
dialog: Now, if you'll excuse me, please, I
dialog: have some things to do. I'm sorry
dialog: the news isn't better.
text: CATHY LONG turns to go.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Miss Long?
text: CATHY LONG turns back.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: When are you expecting Jerry in?
speaker_heading: CATHY LONG
dialog: He won't be in until very late this
dialog: afternoon.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: That's fine. Thank you.
text: CATHY LONG stares at PUPKIN for a moment, glances at the
text: RECEPTIONIST and then goes. PUPKIN takes a seat in the
text: reception area. He smiles once more at the RECEPTIONIST.
text: The RECEPTIONIST drops her eyes. A few beats go by. CATHY
text: LONG passes by the entranceway and glances at PUPKIN.
text: PUPKIN continues sitting there.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Is there anyone else you would
dialog: like to see?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: That's alright. I'm happy just
dialog: waiting.
text: A few beats pass in silence.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Well, would you mind waiting outside,
dialog: please, Mr. Pupkin? This is a reception
text: area, not a waiting room.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I understand.
text: PUPKIN remains seated. A few more moments pass. Several
text: OFFICE PERSONNEL pass by the entranceway and glance at
text: PUPKIN. After a few more beats, a large, plainly-dressed
text: MAN in his mid-fifties emerges from the back offices. He
text: goes over to PUPKIN, who stands.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: Mr. Pupkin? I'm Raymond Wirtz, in
dialog: charge of security for the Langford
dialog: organization.
text: WIRTZ puts his arm on PUPKIN's shoulder and, as the
text: following dialogue unfolds leads him out the door, down
text: the corridor and into the elevator.
speaker_heading: WIRTZ
dialog: Now I think you understand that we
dialog: have certain rules here that are
dialog: essential to the smooth functioning
dialog: of our operation.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Sure. Sure.
speaker_heading: WIRTZ
dialog: And that without these rules, we really
dialog: wouldn't be able to function at our
dialog: best. You follow my point?
text: PUPKIN nods.
speaker_heading: WIRTZ
dialog: Now one of these rules is that only
dialog: authorized personnel and those having
dialog: official business with our organization
dialog: are permitted on our premises. And
dialog: that's why I'm asking you, Mr. Pupkin,
dialog: to cooperate with us.
text: They have reached the elevator and WIRTZ has pushed the
dialog: button.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You want me to leave the building.
speaker_heading: WIRTZ
dialog: That's right. It's nothing personal,
dialog: Mr. Pupkin. Just doing my job.
text: The elevator arrives. WIRTZ signals with his head that
text: PUPKIN should enter. PUPKIN gets in.
speaker_heading: WIRTZ
dialog: Have a pleasant day.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 55 EXT: STREET OUTSIDE THE LANGFORD BUILDING - DAY
text: PUPKIN comes out and takes up a position outside the door,
text: preparing to wait for LANGFORD. MARSHA sees him and comes
text: over to him.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Well, did you give it to him?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (out of a daze)
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Did you get my letter to him?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
text: He's not in there.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Look, if you don't want to give it
dialog: him, okay. I'll get somebody
dialog: else. But don't try to con me.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I told you I'd try and I will. I'm
dialog: going to wait for him right here.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Give me the envelope, huh?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Sure, but ...
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: I saw him go in myself!
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Jerry!
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: But they said he wasn't in.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Just give me the envelope.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: When did he go in?
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Ten minutes ago! That's when.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Look, I saw him my ...
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: And he hasn't come out?
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: I've been standing right here. Now
dialog: how about it?
text: PUPKIN turns and goes back into the building. MARSHA yells
dialog: after him.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: I'm staying right here!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 56 INT: RECEPTION AREA OF THE JERRY LANGFORD OFFICES
text: PUPKIN enters briskly and goes up to the RECEPTIONIST.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (with authority)
dialog: Tell Jerry Langford I'm here, please.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: I'm sorry, sir. Mr. Langford's not in.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I happen to know he is. So would you
dialog: please tell him I'm here.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: I'm sorry. He's not in.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You're putting your job on the line,
dialog: lady.
text: The RECEPTIONIST starts making a call inside. PUPKIN
text: glances at her and walks right in to the inner corridors.
text: He starts peering into the open doors of the offices that
text: line the corridor. The whole place is like a gigantic
text: maze. OFFICE PERSONNEL pass by him, taking no notice of

text: lost. A few beat later, he spots WIRTZ leading a pair of
text: SECURITY GUARDS. PUPKIN keeps peering into offices quickly
text: as he flees. The GUARDS and WIRTZ finally catch up to
text: PUPKIN at the steno pool and, after a brief chase around
text: the pool, they catch PUPKIN and subdue him. They start
text: dragging him out past the eyes of the OFFICE PERSONNEL.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (calling as he is dragged)
dialog: Jerry! Jerry! (to WIRTZ) You're
dialog: going the have a hell of a lot of
dialog: explaining to do! (calling) Jerry!
speaker_heading: WIRTZ
dialog: You had your warning, Mr. Krupkin.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Jerry! Help me. Jerry!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: into the street.
speaker_heading: WIRTZ
dialog: If we see your face again, Mr. Pupkin,
dialog: we'll call the police.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Start looking for a new job!
text: MARSHA comes straight up to PUPKIN who is brushing himself
text: off. His eyes are glazed and distant.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Does he have it?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (abstractedly)
dialog: Don't worry. I'll get it to him.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Yeah? When?
text: There is a pause.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: This weekend. He asked me to go out
text: there, to his house.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 58 THE BAR-RESTAURANT WHERE RITA WORKS - DAY
text: PUPKIN enters the bar-restaurant. Through the window WE
text: SEE him talking to RITA. He is voluble, animated. She
text: looks skeptical, with a wry smile on her face. Finally WE
text: WATCH him extract an answer from her. She shrugs, smiles
text: and says yes. He comes walking out the door, his hounded
text: expression softened by a smile.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 59 INT: THE FITTING AREA OF A MEN'S STORE - DAY

scene_heading: 61 INT: CARTIER'S JEWELERS - DAY
text: WE WATCH PUPKIN perusing the beautiful diamond, sapphire,

text: and hands a surprised SALESLADY the money in cash.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 62 INT: SUBURBAN TRAIN - DAY
text: PUPKIN and RITA are seated side by side. Since it is
text: Saturday morning, the train is sparsely populated. A
text: CONDUCTOR has just finished taking PUPKIN's tickets. RITA
text: is edgy. PUPKIN is strangely calm and a little remote.
text: He is wearing his new suit.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What are we going to do?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (patiently)
dialog: Look, I told you, I've got some work
dialog: to discuss with him. That's all.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: But what about me?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You're with me.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: That's fine, but while you two are
dialog: talking, what am I going to do?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You can chat with the other guests.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I'm sure they'll be thrilled hearing
dialog: about the wonderful world of draft beer.
dialog: (pause) Let's tell 'em I'm a model,
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: If they ask what I do, let's just say
dialog: I model. You don't mind pretending
dialog: just a little, do you?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: If it make you feel better.
text: There is a pause.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: This is a gas! Too bad nobody'll
dialog: believe it. (pause) After you guys
dialog: are done working, what happens? Are
dialog: we going out someplace, or what?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I'm sure Jerry has something arranged.
text: There is another pause.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What do these people do for fun?
dialog: Do they party or do freaky things
dialog: or just get drunk or ... I mean,
dialog: What do they do?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I guess they just sit around and talk
dialog: and enjoy each other's company, like
dialog: anybody else.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Talk?!? What can you talk about
dialog: for three or four hours?!
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: What do you mean? They've got plenty
dialog: to talk about. They do things. All
dialog: kinds of interesting things happen
text: to them and then they talk about them.
dialog: What do you think Jerry's show is all
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Yeah, a cocktail party with no drinks.
dialog: That's what all those shows are. At
dialog: least they help you get to sleep.
text: There is a pause.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (glumly)
dialog: Boy, this is going to be some great
dialog: weekend. I thought we were gonna
dialog: have some fun.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Just take it easy, Rita. Everything's
dialog: going to be fine.
text: WE MOVE IN for a CLOSE-UP of PUPKIN who is fading out.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: 63 EXT: A NEO-CLASSICAL MANSION
text: It is a large white house with colonial columns set in the
text: middle of a palatial estate whose rolling lawns are
text: punctuated with fine old trees. We circle around to the
text: back where LANGFORD, a handful of his FRIENDS (which can be
text: familiar television celebrities) and PUPKIN and RITA are
text: just finishing a lavish lunch on the patio. A pair of
text: SERVANTS are clearing the table and serving the coffee and
text: desert as the scene unfolds. As we arrive, we hear a loud
text: burst of laughter. PUPKIN is regaling the COMPANY with
dialog: stories.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Oh, you have no idea how bad it's
dialog: gotten in New York. Now the muggers
dialog: are so efficient that, each time
dialog: they jump you, they take your name
dialog: and address and put you on a mailing
dialog: list. (the COMPANY chuckles) And
dialog: once you're on the list, you're in
dialog: real trouble, like this friend of
dialog: mine who was mugged thirty-two times
text: on his way home from work. (a little
speaker_heading: laughter from the COMPANY)
text: A SERVANT places the desert, a little, elegant tart, in
text: front of PUPKIN and RITA.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
speaker_heading: (to SERVANT)
dialog: Thanks.
text: The SERVANT smiles. As PUPKIN continues his story, he
text: glances occasionally at RITA who has begun to nibble at her
text: tart. PUPKIN also glances conspiratorially at LANGFORD
text: who smiles back.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: So what my friend does is get himself
dialog: a dog, one of those huge German
text: Shepherds. One night, he's walking
text: the dog in Central Park when he hears
text: this voice behind him. (in a German
dialog: accent) Okay, Harry, drop your
dialog: vallet and keep your hantz over your
dialog: head or I bite your little fanny off.
text: The COMPANY breaks up.
speaker_heading: ONE GUEST
speaker_heading: (to LANGFORD)
dialog: Looks like you've found yourself a
dialog: winner, Jerry.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: (looking at PUPKIN)
dialog: He's the one who found himself
dialog: a winner.
text: RITA looks up, smiles and blushes. The rest of the COMPANY
text: smiles benignly and grows attentive as RITA returns to
text: eating her tart. Suddenly she bites down on something
text: hard. She fishes it out of her mouth and looks at it. The
text: COMPANY giggles. It is the ring PUPKIN purchased at
text: Cartier's. The COMPANY applauds lightly and laughs.
text: LANGFORD lifts his wine glass.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: To Rita and Rupert -- a short engagement
text: and a long, happy marriage.
text: The COMPANY drinks with murmurs of "Hear! Hear!" RITA
text: and PUPKIN beam. RITA looks lovingly at PUPKIN.
speaker_heading: A SECOND GUEST
speaker_heading: (the PUPKIN)
dialog: Have you set a date?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
text: (looking pointedly at LANGFORD)
dialog: Oh, yes.
speaker_heading: A THIRD GUEST
dialog: I hope we're all invited.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Everyone's invited.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 64 INT: THE LANGFORD TELEVISION STUDIO
text: The theater is packed. World Series bunting hangs from the
text: balcony and the front of the stage. We hear RICK ROSS and
text: the ORCHESTRA strike up Mendelssohn's Wedding March. Down
text: one aisle walks RITA, accompanied by the MAN whom PUPKIN
text: hit over the head at the bar. Down the other aisle marches
text: PUPKIN, accompanied by LANGFORD. The AUDIENCE cheers
text: wildly. The two COUPLES walk to the stage where a white-
text: haired OFFICIAL awaits them. BERT CANTER stands at his
text: side. PUPKIN and RITA disengage from their ESCORTS and
text: stand before the OFFICIAL. The music stops and the
text: AUDIENCE grows quiet.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: We are met here in these extraordinary
dialog: circumstances to join this man and this
dialog: woman in holy wedlock. But, before we
dialog: begin, let me voice a personal word
dialog: of thanks to you, Rupert and to you,
dialog: Rita, for choosing me to perform this
dialog: prestigious ceremony. Because we are
dialog: on prime time, I am going to discard
dialog: my customary remarks in favor of a
dialog: few personal reflections. When I was
dialog: principal at Clifton High and these
dialog: two were students, I had very little
dialog: faith that Rupert here would amount
dialog: to very much. But like his teachers
dialog: and his fellow students, I underestimated
dialog: this fine young man. Some say that
dialog: this misjudgment is directly tied to my
dialog: recent dismissal as head of the Clifton
dialog: School System. But let me take this
dialog: opportunity to set the record straight.
dialog: Knowing that Rupert and Rita here were
dialog: most certainly destined for a great
dialog: career and a lifetime of happiness,
dialog: I voluntarily stepped down. I would
dialog: only here add my own wishes to those
dialog: of millions of viewers for their
dialog: continued health, wealth and
dialog: boundless success.
text: The OFFICIAL looks quickly past RITA and PUPKIN.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: We'll be back to marry them in a minute,
dialog: right after this word.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: 65 INT: THE TRAIN - DAY

speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR'S VOICE

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 66 INT: A SUBURBAN TAXI - DAY
text: RITA is peering out the window. PUPKIN is still lost in
dialog: thought.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Look at that one. How'd you like to
dialog: live in that?!?! Or that one! What
dialog: do you figure these run?
text: The taxi stops in front of a walled lot behind which is
text: visible a handsome English stucco home.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
speaker_heading: (to DRIVER)
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: This is it.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It's gorgeous!
text: PUPKIN is genuinely puzzled.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
speaker_heading: (to DRIVER)
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Look, friend, I wouldn't want to
dialog: tell you how many times I made this
dialog: trip. (pause) That'll be three
dialog: seventy-five.
text: PUPKIN, still puzzled, hands him a five dollar bill.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (abstractedly)
dialog: Keep it.
text: The DRIVER gets out and puts PUPKIN and RITA's bags,
text: which he had stacked on the front seat, onto the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Thanks. If you need a ride back,
dialog: just ask the guy for Wayne. That's me.

text: RITA walk up the drive.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 67 EXT: LANGFORD'S HOUSE - DAY
text: PUPKIN and RITA stand before the front door. PUPKIN rings,

dialog: behind.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 68 INT: LANGFORD'S HOUSE - DAY
text: PUPKIN hands the HOUSEBOY the two suitcases as he talks.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You must be Jonno. I'm Rupert Pupkin
dialog: and this is Rita Keane. Mr. Langford's
dialog: expecting us.
text: Jonno nods politely but uncertainly.
speaker_heading: JONNO
dialog: (uncertain)
dialog: Mr. Langford asked you to come?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: That's right. Would you mind
dialog: taking those up? Jerry and I have
dialog: some work that may oblige me to
dialog: stay overnight.
speaker_heading: JONNO
dialog: But Mr. Langford's not here.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Out playing golf, right?
speaker_heading: JONNO
dialog: (still puzzled and unsure)
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Maybe he'll finally break a hundred.
speaker_heading: JONNO
dialog: Maybe it's better if you came back ...
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: That's alright. We don't mind waiting.
text: PUPKIN walks from the foyer into the living-room, leaving
text: JONNO staring after him holding the bags. RITA walks into
text: the living room after PUPKIN.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (worried)
text: The table's only set for one.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: That's from breakfast. Relax, will
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 69 INT: LANGFORD'S KITCHEN - DAY

dialog: Let me talk to Jerry Langford please
dialog: ... I know he is ... It's important.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 70 INT: LANGFORD'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: It is a handsomely furnished room, done in old American
text: antiques and other tasteful pieces. There is a grand piano
text: heavy with pictures in one corner and wall-to-wall
text: bookshelves that are mostly full and mixed with a balance
text: of classics and modern popular reading. The whole room
text: marks LANGFORD as a man of discernment. The shelves also
text: house a fine stereo and a small, discreet bar. RITA and
text: PUPKIN walk in like strangers in paradise, awed by the
text: obvious elegance and expense the room reflects.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (as though he owned it)
dialog: How do you like it?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (admiringly)
dialog: I could live here.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (smiling proudly)
dialog: It's the only way to live.
text: RITA stands in the center of the room, ill at ease, while
text: PUPKIN strolls about comfortably, picking up an ashtray
text: here, a cigarette case there, inspecting the artifacts for
text: inscriptions, clues, hints about LANGFORD's character and
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: How come he isn't here?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You heard the guy. He's out playing
dialog: golf.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Didn't you tell him when we'd get here?
text: PUPKIN continues to move about the room, fielding RITA's
text: suspicious inquiries effortlessly.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: We didn't have time to iron out the
dialog: details. Now just relax. We're
dialog: the first guests, that's all.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: That Jonno character hadn't even
dialog: heard of us!
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (a little irritated)
dialog: It probably slipped Jerry's mind.
dialog: He has better things to think about
text: than what he tells his houseboy.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It's just not time way I expected it,
dialog: that's all.
text: There is a pause. PUPKIN continues his investigation. He
text: has moved to the grand piano in the rear of the room.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What do we do now?
text: PUPKIN is looking at a picture of an American Gothic couple
text: standing in front of a wood-frame house. As he comments on
text: the pictures, the CAMERA PANS over them. They form a kind
text: of slide-show of LANGFORD's life.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
text: These are Jerry's parents. His father
dialog: runs the Post office in Wolverine --
dialog: that's in North Dakota.
text: PUPKIN then fixes on a picture of an eleven-year-old boy
text: standing next to a puppet stage with a puppet (obviously
text: held by the boy) staring at its master.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: This one was in Newsweek. He started
dialog: giving these puppet shows when he was
text: still in grade school.
text: WE SEE a picture of a very young LANGFORD seated before a
text: microphone with some celebrity.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: And this is from his quiz show in
dialog: St. Louis. Can you believe it?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Sure I can.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: That was the name of the show.
text: WE MOVE to a picture of LANGFORD smiling at JACK PAAR.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: And here's when he wrote for Jack
dialog: Paar. He made a hundred and fifty
dialog: a week and look at him now.
text: Another picture of LANGFORD with a group of women sitting
text: in a studio.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: And this is his morning show.
text: A picture of LANGFORD standing in a park with his two boys,
dialog: eleven and eight.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: And his kids. He's divorced.
text: RITA, who has been only half-listening, has picked up a
text: small, beautifully enameled cigarette box.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Look at this. I love these kind of
dialog: things. Look at the work. I've got
dialog: this thing about boxes.
text: RITA puts it down reluctantly, picks it up, then puts it
dialog: down again.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 71 INT: THE KITCHEN - DAY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 72 INT: THE LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: RITA has just finished fixing herself a drink. She takes a
text: large sip and starts pacing around. PUPKIN is seated.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: How much longer are we gonna have
dialog: to wait?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I don't know. Until he gets back.
speaker_heading: RITA.
dialog: Do we have to just sit here?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: He should be back pretty soon.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Doesn't he have any music or anything?
dialog: Let's get a little life into this place.
dialog: It's like a funeral parlor.
text: She walks over to the stereo and opens the cupboard beneath
text: it, revealing rows and rows of records.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: This is more like it.
text: She pulls out a record.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Come on, Rita.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Come on, yourself.
text: She puts the record on. Frank Sinatra starts singing "They
text: Can't Take That Away From Me." She takes a big sip of her
text: drink, puts it down and comes over to PUPKIN.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: How about a little spin, handsome?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (pulling back)
dialog: Here?
text: RITA snuggles into PUPKIN and starts dancing him around.
text: He resists feebly.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Come on, Rupert. I came up here for
dialog: a good time.
text: PUPKIN gives in and starts dancing with her in the style of
text: the 1950's, elbow out, arm up, box step. After a few
text: moments, PUPKIN closes his eyes. He has reached a moment
text: of perfect bliss, his dream girl in is arms. They dance
text: silently as we hear Sinatra singing.
speaker_heading: SINATRA'S VOICE
dialog: The way you wore your hat,
dialog: The way we danced till three,
dialog: The memory of all that --
dialog: Oh no, they can't take that away from me,
dialog: No ... they can't take that away ...
dialog: from ... me.
text: The orchestra plays.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You never could dance, could you?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: How would you know?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Oh I danced with you a couple of
dialog: times -- at the Sigma U party.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You were there with Tommy Winston.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You didn't ask me.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: That's the one time I did ask you
dialog: and you went with him anyway.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Well, I couldn't go with you!
speaker_heading: PUPKIN

speaker_heading: RITA

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 74 INT: THE LIVING ROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Well, it's all ended happily and
dialog: that's what counts.

speaker_heading: RITA

speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I'm sure it's all very nice.
speaker_heading: RITA

dialog: Well, there's only one way to find out.

dialog: step.
speaker_heading: RITA

speaker_heading: PUPKIN

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 75 INT: UPSTAIRS - DAY

speaker_heading: PUPKIN

speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Come on, Rita. This isn't funny.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 76 INT: A BEDROOM - DAY
text: It is clearly LANGFORD's bedroom with a few clothes strewn

speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: What are you doing, Rita?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I love it! All those millions of
dialog: women out there dying to change

speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Come on. We shouldn't be here.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Relax, will you. Let me have a

scene_heading: 77 INT: A LAVISH BATHROOM - DAY
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Look at this. It's nicer than my

speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (urgently)
dialog: Let's go, Rita.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Boy, I really need some sun.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Rita, this is Jerry's ...
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Lay off, will you, Rupert.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: But we have no right ...
text: RITA picks up a can of shave cream and squirts a large
text: dollop in PUPKIN's face. WE COME IN for a CLOSE UP of
text: PUPKIN's face, buried under shaving cream.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: That wasn't funny, Rita.
text: RITA hands him a towel.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Here.
text: She looks around.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Now for something that smells nice.
text: She swings open the cabinet with a flourish. The door
text: swings open violently and the mirror shatters against
text: something as pills and bottles tumble into the sink.
text: PUPKIN and RITA stand there, staring at each other. RITA
text: begins to laugh, but her laugh is cut short by the slam of
text: the downstairs door.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 78 INT: THE FOYER
text: LANGFORD has entered, drawn and businesslike. JONNO and
text: the COOK have moved out to greet him.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Where are they?
speaker_heading: JONNO
dialog: I was going to call the police but
dialog: then I thought to myself 'what if
dialog: they are Mr. Langford's friends?'
text: We hear some whispers and scuffling at the top of the
text: stairs. LANGFORD, JONNO and the COOK look up. PUPKIN
text: comes bounding down the stairs jauntily with RITA following
text: cautiously behind. PUPKIN has large traces of shaving
text: cream behind his ears and on his neck.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Hi, Jerry. We were just freshening up.
text: PUPKIN stops at the base of the stairs, turns around, and
text: waves RITA down.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
speaker_heading: (to RITA)
dialog: Come on, Rita. No need to be shy.
text: PUPKIN smiles conspiratorially at LANGFORD. RITA comes
text: slowly down.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Jerry, I'd like you to meet Rita
dialog: Keane. Rita, say hello to Jerry!
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (tentatively)
dialog: Pleased to meet you.
text: LANGFORD nods imperceptibly, his face tense, his eyes
text: alert. RITA, reading her frigid reception, looks to
text: PUPKIN who walks blithely past LANGFORD into the living
text: room, toward the bar.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: What's your pleasure?
text: PUPKIN glances at the small mess he has left on the bar and
text: turns back to LANGFORD who has moved into the living room
text: with JONNO and the COOK a few steps behind. PUPKIN flashes
text: LANGFORD an apologetic smile.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
speaker_heading: (to LANGFORD)
dialog: We've already taken the liberty, so
text: to speak. Rita was a little nervous.
dialog: It isn't every day she meets someone
dialog: like you.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: What's going on here?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
text: We've been sitting around, waiting.
dialog: That's all. How was your golf game?
speaker_heading: JONNO
dialog: I told them you weren't here.
speaker_heading: COOK
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: He did, Jerry. He was very helpful.
dialog: We had to take an early train. There

dialog: (pause) I brought the material.
dialog: It's upstairs, in my bags. (pause)
dialog: Where is everybody?
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: The other guests! (in a confidential
dialog: tone) We're getting a little hungry,
dialog: to tell you the truth.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: (as though confirming
dialog: what PUPKIN said)
dialog: You are.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (backing off)
dialog: But we don't mind waiting, do we,
dialog: Rita?
text: RITA says nothing. She has sensed something terribly
text: wrong and is slowly backing away from PUPKIN.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: You know, I could have you arrested,
dialog: both of you.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (seizing the idea)
dialog: You know you could! And there'd be
dialog: absolutely no way we could prove we
dialog: belonged here. I never thought of that.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Well, you should have before you ...
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (still fixed on the idea)
dialog: Maybe we could work up a routine
dialog: about that, about a guy who throws
dialog: all his friends in jail. Let's talk
dialog: about that.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: Let's not.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Sure, Jerry. Whatever you ...
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Look, if you've got something for
dialog: me to sign, let's have it and get
dialog: it over with so I can get back ...
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: That wouldn't be right, Jerry.
dialog: Not in your own house!
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: (summoning his last
dialog: bit of patience)
dialog: I have a lot of work to get to.
dialog: (to JONNO) How did they get here?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: We took a taxi, Jerry ... But don't
dialog: worry about us. You go ahead and
dialog: do your work and we'll just take a
text: stroll around until lunch is ready.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: You're a little thick, aren't you?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (smiling as though complimented)
dialog: Well, maybe a ...
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What's he's saying, Rupert, is that he
dialog: wants us out.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Don't listen to her, Jerry. She
dialog: doesn't understand anything about us.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Don't get me into this.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
speaker_heading: (to JONNO)
dialog: Call the station.
text: JONNO goes back into the foyer, followed by the COOK.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: There'll be a cab here in a few
dialog: minutes. Now if you'll just wait
dialog: at the gate ...
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Look, Jerry, if I've said anything
dialog: out of line, let's chalk it up to
dialog: inexperience, okay? I'll just go
dialog: upstairs and get my tape and we can
dialog: start working. It shouldn't take
dialog: long and then you'll have the rest of
dialog: the afternoon to yourself.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: I've told you just as clearly as I
dialog: can. I want you out of here and I
dialog: want you out now. Scram, beat it,
dialog: vamoose, out! Is that plain enough!
text: RITA deftly pockets the enamel box.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: But what about my material? When
dialog: are we going to go over it?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Come on, Rupert, the man wants us
dialog: to go.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Tell her she's wrong, Jerry!
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Look, Mr. Langford. I didn't know
dialog: anything about all this. I hardly
dialog: know this guy. I haven't seen him
dialog: in years.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Rita!
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: So if there's anything I can do, any
dialog: way I can make this up to you.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: She's nothing, Jerry. She's just
text: some girl who works in a bar.
dialog: Don't let her spoil things.
text: LANGFORD starts herding RITA and PUPKIN towards the door.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Come on. Let's go.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: All I'm asking is fifteen minutes.
dialog: That's all. Just long enough to
dialog: listen to my act. Is that asking
dialog: too much -- fifteen minutes of your
dialog: day against my whole life?
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: I'll call the police if I have to.
text: LANGFORD realizes he is being hard. He stops for a moment.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: I have my own life, that's all.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: But what about me, Jerry? What about
dialog: my life? I made plans -- based on
dialog: what you said. You can't just turn
dialog: your back on me.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: I'm not telling you again.
text: There is a long pause as the truth finally sinks in. PUPKIN
text: just stares at LANGFORD with disbelief that turns to anger.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: So this is the way it works when
dialog: you're big, huh? You just play with
dialog: people. Is that part of the kick,
dialog: Jerry? (pause) I can see I was all
dialog: wrong about you. All wrong.
text: RITA starts tugging at PUPKIN.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Come on, Rupert.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
speaker_heading: (to RITA)
dialog: Shut up! (to LANGFORD) You weren't
dialog: my friend at all, were you? You were
dialog: just playing some kind of game with me.
dialog: Well, that's not going to stop me,
dialog: Jerry. I'm just going to work a
dialog: little bit harder, that's all, use a
dialog: little bit more enterprise. And not
dialog: count on anybody. That's where I
dialog: made my mistake. I can see that now.
text: PUPKIN picks up the pair of small suitcases.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
speaker_heading: (glaring at LANGFORD)
dialog: Come on, Rita. We're wasting our time.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 79 EXT. LANGFORD'S FRONT DOOR - DAY
text: PUPKIN strides out with RITA following. She casts LANGFORD
text: an apologetic glance as she goes. The door slams behind
text: them. They walk down the path silently for a few moments
text: as the CAMERA PULLS UP, following them in an OVERHEAD SHOT.
text: We hear them start talking as they make their way towards
dialog: the gate.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (baffled and angry)
dialog: What did you think was going to
dialog: happen? You think he'd just ... ?
dialog: What's the matter with you? (pause)
dialog: You can't just walk into a guy's
dialog: house! And what about me? What
dialog: did you ...

speaker_heading: MARSHA

speaker_heading: PUPKIN

speaker_heading: MARSHA

speaker_heading: PUPKIN

speaker_heading: MARSHA

speaker_heading: MARSHA
text: It looks real.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: That's the whole point. (gesturing

speaker_heading: MARSHA

speaker_heading: PUPKIN

speaker_heading: MARSHA

speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Is that him?!?
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Sure I'm sure. That looks too much
dialog: like him.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MARSHA
text: When it's him it doesn't look like him.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Keep watching.
text: PUPKIN closes his eyes and rests for a moment.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: That's him.
text: PUPKIN's eyes snap open. WE SEE LANGFORD, concealed in his

speaker_heading: MARSHA

speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Wait a second and follow him.

text: side by side with LANGFORD.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Just keep walking or I'll kill
dialog: you right here.
text: LANGFORD looks at PUPKIN in terror. He falters a bit, out
dialog: of fear.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I said keep walking. This is a gun
dialog: in my pocket and I've got nothing
dialog: to lose.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: (who keeps walking)
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Just keep walking and don't talk
dialog: to anybody. I'll tell you what
dialog: to do.
text: A MAN coming the other way stops and stares at LANGFORD
text: out of curiosity. PUPKIN and LANGFORD keep walking. They
text: get to where the Mercedes is waiting. PUPKIN jabs LANGFORD
text: in the ribs with the gun.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Get in!
speaker_heading: LANGFORD

speaker_heading: PUPKIN

dialog: for a woman of fifty. MARSHA has imprinted her own stamp
dialog: on the apartment in two ways: First, the place is abso-
text: lutely chaotic. Secondly, there are a number of blow-up
text: pictures on the wall. A picture of LANGFORD sits on the
text: bureau. There is a big brass bed with an ornate brass
text: frame at the foot. LANGFORD stares at MARSHA and PUPKIN.
text: PUPKIN closes the blinds and turns on the lights. MARSHA
text: trains the gun on LANGFORD. PUPKIN finishes his work and
text: takes the gun back.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I didn't like being so rough out
dialog: there, Jerry. But I wanted you to
dialog: know that I meant business. I didn't
dialog: want anything happening to you over
text: some misunderstanding.
text: LANGFORD just stares at him, frozen with fear.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Now I know you're wondering what
dialog: this is all about. Actually you've
dialog: got nothing to worry about. You
dialog: just do what I tell you and by, say,
dialog: midnight, you'll be safe and out of
dialog: here. Of course if you try anything
dialog: clever, I'll kill you -- or Marsha
dialog: will. She knows how to use this too.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: You realize what you're saying.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Come on, Jerry. This isn't a spur
dialog: of the moment thing. Give me a little
dialog: credit, will you.
text: PUPKIN looks over to a small phone table with a chair next
text: to it. He motions to it with his head.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
speaker_heading: (to LANGFORD)
dialog: Sit down.

speaker_heading: PUPKIN

text: and the others are looking up at her.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: He says it's urgent.
speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 92 INT: MARSHA'S APARTMENT -- DAY

dialog: Okay, I'm listening.

scene_heading: 98 INT: MARSHA'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: LANGFORD is seated on a chair whose back is pressed right
text: up against the high, ornate brass bedstead at the foot of
text: the bed. MARSHA trains the gun on LANGFORD now. PUPKIN
text: is unpacking a suitcase. He takes out a handsome blue suit,
text: ruffled shirt, a bow tie, black shoes, underwear, socks,
text: shaving equipment, soap, a hairbrush, a clothesbrush, a
text: small shoe shine kit, aftershave lotion, deodorant and a
text: dozen or so rolls of inch-and-a-half wide adhesive tape.
text: He removes this stuff from a suitcase that is barely big
dialog: enough to hold it -- so the mere packing of all this para-
text: phernalia into such a small space represents something of an
text: achievement. As he takes the stuff out, he talks to
text: LANGFORD, his back turned to him.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: This wasn't an easy decision for
dialog: me, Jerry, believe me. For one
dialog: thing, I knew it meant we could never
dialog: be friends again and that hurt me.
dialog: It's hard to lose a friend, even one
dialog: who has let you down. You always
dialog: hope you can patch things up. You
dialog: know, a guy like me doesn't make
dialog: friends that easily.
text: PUPKIN pauses a moment, then turns to LANGFORD, his voice
text: filled with emotion.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Why didn't you just listen to the
dialog: tape when I asked you? Then I
dialog: wouldn't have to be doing all this.
dialog: Was it really too much to expect --
dialog: a few minutes of your time to listen
dialog: to something I'd worked on my whole
dialog: life?
text: LANGFORD's eyes shift rapidly. He is obviously calculating
dialog: how to deal with PUPKIN.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: (with disarming charm)
dialog: Hey, if that's what's bothering you,
dialog: let's go over to my office and listen
dialog: to that tape right now.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Are you crazy, Jerry? Do you know
dialog: what would happen to me?
text: MARSHA listens to this exchange a bit nervously. Gesturing
text: to her gun, she says:
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Am I going to have to hold this
dialog: thing all day?
text: PUPKIN sees she has lowered it practically to her side.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
speaker_heading: (to MARSHA)
dialog: Just keep it on him. (to LANGFORD)
dialog: You know, Jerry. Friendship is a two-
dialog: way street. All that time I was
dialog: worrying about you and your ratings
dialog: and everything, you couldn't have
dialog: cared less about me.
text: LANGFORD thinks rapidly for a beat or two.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: You're right. You know that? I
dialog: was thoughtless. It's just that
dialog: when you're doing a big show, it's
dialog: hard to tell who your friends really
dialog: are. I was wrong. I apologize.
dialog: Why don't we just shake hands and
dialog: forget the whole thing?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (suspiciously)
dialog: That's easy to say, Jerry.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: But I mean it. I'll tell them that
dialog: the whole thing was a joke and then
dialog: we can go to my office and listen to
dialog: that tape. Come on. What do you say?
text: LANGFORD rises with his hand extended toward PUPKIN.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: (to LANGFORD, sharply)
dialog: Sit down!
text: LANGFORD looks to PUPKIN.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: I said sit!
text: LANGFORD reluctantly sits down.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
speaker_heading: (to MARSHA)
dialog: What's the matter? You heard
dialog: what he said.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
text: All of a sudden, with a gun on him,
dialog: he wants to make up and be friends.
dialog: And, once he's out the door, what
dialog: happens then?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: What happens then, Jerry?
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: You get to his office and they
dialog: jump you, that's what happens, Rupert.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: She's right, Jerry.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Not if I tell them not to. This is
dialog: Jerry, Rupert, I give you my word.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
speaker_heading: (to MARSHA)
dialog: He gives me his word.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Yeah? And what else? Come on,
dialog: Rupert, I'm sick of waiting.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: And what else, Jerry?
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Come on, Rupert. My word's good
dialog: enough, isn't it.
text: PUPKIN stares at LANGFORD for a few beats. Then he shakes
text: his head sadly and says in a very quiet, discouraged voice.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: No, Jerry. It's not. (to MARSHA)
dialog: Keep the gun up!
text: PUPKIN comes over to LANGFORD with a few rolls of adhesive
text: tape in his hand.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I'm sorry to do it this way, Jerry,
dialog: but I'm no good at knots. Just put
dialog: your arms up and out, okay?
text: LANGFORD spreads his arms back against the brass bedstead.
text: As PUPKIN goes to tape them, LANGFORD tries to grab him,
text: but, with sudden, demonic force, PUPKIN pins him against
text: the bedstead. They are practically nose to nose.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Oh, no, Jerry. None of that. Now
dialog: hold still.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: AN EXECUTIVE
dialog: Radical?
speaker_heading: PATTEN
dialog: They're willing to sacrifice their

text: figure that this is a desperate outfit.
dialog: I don't know who they are anymore than
dialog: you do. But I do know I've got to

speaker_heading: PATTEN
dialog: Who am I addressing, please?
speaker_heading: CROCKETT

speaker_heading: PATTEN

dialog: can't allow this to reach the public.
text: When the kidnappers call in, of course
dialog: you're going to be cooperative.
dialog: Promise them anything they want.
dialog: After all, this King character is

speaker_heading: PATTEN
dialog: Sure. Let him go on if you have

dialog: you? (pause) All I'm saying is this:
dialog: don't put him on the air.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: That's fine, Inspector, but let's say
dialog: he finishes his bit and you've worked
dialog: him over ...
speaker_heading: PATTEN
dialog: Questioned him, Mr. Thomas.
text: There is light laughter.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Okay, questioned him and he still
dialog: won't talk. We get to eleven thirty
dialog: and what do we do? Do we air him or
dialog: what?
text: There is a heavy pause.
speaker_heading: PATTEN
dialog: I would say no.

speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Good. Tell me if you're not.
dialog: I guess you're wondering why I do

speaker_heading: CROCKETT
dialog: We'll stretch the other guests. But

speaker_heading: FIRST EXECUTIVE
dialog: And from a news point of view, we've

speaker_heading: CROCKETT
dialog: Exactly, Lou. (pause) I mean, who

speaker_heading: A SECOND EXECUTIVE
dialog: But nobody's going to know he's a

speaker_heading: CROCKETT
dialog: Then they'll read about it in the papers
dialog: tomorrow and, believe me, tomorrow night,

speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: SECOND EXECUTIVE

speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
dialog: Thank you. Thank you very much. I
dialog: have some sad news for you. Earlier

dialog: squad so there'll be no sensational
dialog: Randall monologue this evening.

speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: No embarrassing displays of emotion,

dialog: different if you ask me. We're going
dialog: to give you a glimpse into the future.
dialog: It isn't often that you can call
dialog: someone a sure thing in the entertainment
dialog: business. After all, the verdict is
dialog: always in your hands. But I think
dialog: tonight, after you've met my first
dialog: guest, you'll agree with me that he's
dialog: destined for greatness -- in one way
dialog: or another. So will you please give
dialog: your warmest greeting to the newest
dialog: King of Comedy, Rupert Pupkin!!!!

dialog: is more confident, comfortable and self-assured than we
dialog: have ever seen him.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Good evening, ladies and gentleman.
dialog: Let me introduce myself. My name is
dialog: Rupert Pupkin. I was born in Clifton,
dialog: New Jersey, which was not, at that
dialog: time, a federal offense. (laughter)
dialog: Is there anyone here from Clifton?
dialog: (silence) Good. We can all relax.
dialog: Now, I'd like to begin by saying that
dialog: my parents were too poor to afford me
dialog: a childhood but the fact is nobody is
dialog: allowed to be really poor in Clifton.
dialog: Once you fall below eleven thousand
dialog: you're exiled to Passaic. My parents
dialog: did, in fact, put down the first two
dialog: payments on my childhood. Then they
dialog: tried to return me to the hospital
dialog: as defective. But, like everyone else
dialog: I grew up in large part thanks to my
dialog: mother. If she was only here today
dialog: I'd say, "Hey, mom. What are you
dialog: doing here? You've been dead for
dialog: nine years?" (laughter) You should
dialog: have seen my mother. She was wonderful
dialog: -- blonde, beautiful, intelligent,
dialog: alcoholic. (laughter) We used to
dialog: drink milk together after school.
text: Mine was homogenized. Hers was loaded.
dialog: (laughter) Once she was picked up for
text: speeding. They clocked her doing fifty
dialog: -- in our garage. (laughter) When
dialog: they tested her they found that her
dialog: alcohol was two per cent blood. They
dialog: took away her license and she died
dialog: shortly afterwards. We used to joke
dialog: together Mom and me, until the tears
dialog: would stream down her face and she'd
dialog: throw up. (laughter) And who would
dialog: clean it up? Not Dad. He was too
text: busy down at O'Grady's throwing up on
dialog: his own. In fact, until I was sixteen,
dialog: I thought throwing up was a sign of
dialog: maturity. While the other kids were
dialog: off in the woods sneaking cigarettes, I
dialog: was hiding behind the house with my
dialog: fingers down my throat. (laughter)
dialog: I never got anywhere until one day,
dialog: my father caught me. Just as he was
text: giving me a final kick in the stomach,
dialog: for luck, I managed to heave all
text: over his new shoes. "That's it,"
dialog: I thought. "I've made it. I'm
dialog: finally a man!" (laughter) As it
dialog: turned out, that was the only time my
dialog: father ever paid any real attention
dialog: to me. He was usually too busy out
dialog: in the park playing ball with my
dialog: sister, Rose. And, today thanks to
dialog: those many hours of practice, my
text: sister Rose has grown into a fine man.
dialog: (laughter) Me, I wasn't especially
dialog: interested in athletics. The only
dialog: exercise I ever got was when the
dialog: other kids picked on me. They used
dialog: to beat me up once a week, usually
text: Tuesday. After a while, the school
dialog: worked it into the curriculum. And,
dialog: if you knocked me out, you got extra
dialog: credit. (laughter) Except there was
dialog: this one kid who was afraid of me. I
dialog: kept telling him, "Hit me! Hit me!
dialog: What's the matter with you? Don't you
dialog: want graduate?" As for me, I was
dialog: the only kid in the history of the
dialog: school to graduate in traction. The
dialog: school nurse tucked my diploma into
dialog: my sling. But my only real interest,
dialog: right from the beginning, was show
dialog: business. Even as a young man, I
text: began at the very top, collecting
dialog: autographs. (laughter)

dialog: evening. Well, he's tied up --
dialog: and I'm the one who tied him.
dialog: (laughter) You think I'm joking,
dialog: but that's the only way I could break
dialog: into show business -- by hijacking
dialog: Jerry Langford. (laughter) I'm
dialog: not kidding. Right now, Jerry
text: Langford is strapped to a bedstead
dialog: somewhere in the middle of this city.
dialog: (laughter) Go ahead. Laugh. But
dialog: the fact is ... I'm here. Tomorrow
dialog: you'll know I wasn't kidding and
dialog: you'll think I was crazy. But I
dialog: figured it this way: better to be
dialog: King for a Night than Schmuck for
dialog: a Lifetime!!! (laughter) Good
dialog: night ladies and gentlemen. God

text: desk. GIARDELLO is at his side. The clock on the wall
dialog: reads 10:20.
speaker_heading: PATTEN
dialog: Okay, Pupkin. We'll start all over
dialog: again. Where is Langford? You know,
dialog: we're going to find him sooner or later.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I'm trying to tell you, Inspector.
dialog: You let me walk out of here, right?
dialog: And as soon as I'm seen my act on
dialog: the show -- as soon as I'm sure they've
dialog: really put it on -- I'll tell you where
dialog: Jerry is and you'll get him back safe
dialog: and sound.
speaker_heading: PATTEN
dialog: Fine, Pupkin. Then why don't you watch
dialog: the show here with us? That way we're
dialog: all happy. (to GIARDELLO) What channel?
speaker_heading: GIARDELLO
dialog: Seven.
speaker_heading: PATTEN
dialog: We get that one in fine. So what do
dialog: you say, Pupkin?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Look, I'll say it again. You let
dialog: me go now.
text: PATTEN motions to the PLAINCLOTHESMEN wearily with his
text: head. They drag PUPKIN off. PATTEN looks up at the clock.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 139 INT: MARSHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: MARSHA is frantically attempting to unwrap LANGFORD. With
text: each pull of the tape, LANGFORD yelps. There is a small
text: tangle of unwrapped tape collecting around LANGFORD's feet
text: and sticking to MARSHA's clothes.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Watch my hair!
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: I'm sorry, baby.
text: We hear the sound of tape ripping.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Ow!
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 140 INT: PATTEN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: PUPKIN is hustled before PATTEN again.
scene_heading: A PLAINCLOTHESMAN
dialog: Still nothing.
text: PUPKIN glances at the clock. It is 11:05.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I've got to get out of here.
speaker_heading: PATTEN
dialog: You're not going anywhere, Pupkin.
dialog: Now, where is he?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I'm telling you, Inspector, if I don't
dialog: see that show where I want to see it,
dialog: Jerry Langford is dead. My people
dialog: have instructions to execute him
dialog: unless they hear from me by midnight.
text: PATTEN glances apprehensively at GIARDELLO.
speaker_heading: PATTEN
dialog: Just where is it you want to watch
dialog: this show?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 141 INT: MARSHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: LANGFORD is half unwrapped now. The place is covered with
text: yard after yard of tape. MARSHA is working frantically to
text: finish unwrapping LANGFORD who is helping now that his arms
dialog: are free.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Ow! God damnit! Not so fast!
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: (working frantically)
dialog: We haven't all night, baby.
text: MARSHA rips the tape off LANGFORD.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: OW!!!!
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Oh, I love you, baby. I love you
dialog: so much.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 142 EXT: BROADWAY - NIGHT
text: A limo drives down Broadway, followed by an unmarked car.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 143 INT: THE LIMO - NIGHT
text: PATTEN and GIARDELLO sit up front, with the DRIVER. PUPKIN
text: sits in the back between two PLAINCLOTHESMEN. The limo
text: pulls up in front of the bar-restaurant where RITA works.
text: PATTEN turns around in the front seat to address PUPKIN.
speaker_heading: PATTEN
dialog: Here we, are, Pupkin. I don't know
dialog: what this is all about, but as soon
dialog: as you've seen yourself, you're going
dialog: to talk to us or I promise you,
dialog: you'll never see daylight again.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I'll need a couple of minutes, Inspector.
speaker_heading: PATTEN
dialog: What?!?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: After it's over, I want a couple of
dialog: minutes. And I'll need ten dollars.
dialog: Does anyone of you gentlemen have my
dialog: wallet?
speaker_heading: PATTEN
dialog: Don't push me, Pupkin.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
text: A condemned man's last request,
dialog: Inspector.
speaker_heading: PATTEN
dialog: Well, I'll tell you right away, the
dialog: answer is no, Pupkin.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: It's not much of a ransom, Inspector ...
speaker_heading: PATTEN
dialog: (losing his temper)
dialog: Look, I'm drawing the line, that's
dialog: all! No ten dollars and that's it.
dialog: (emphatically) No -- ten -- dollars!!!!
dialog: You understand?!?
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (in mollifying tones)
dialog: Sure. Sure, Inspector. No ten dollars ...
speaker_heading: PATTEN
dialog: (appeased)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: ... and no Jerry Langford.
text: There is a pause as PATTEN stifles himself.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Come on, it's getting late, Inspector.
speaker_heading: PATTEN
dialog: (exploding to one of his MEN)
dialog: Go ahead. Give him his goddamned ten
dialog: dollars! Give him twenty! I don't
dialog: care. Just get him out of here!
text: One of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN in the back opens the door and
text: PUPKIN and the other PLAINCLOTHESMAN get out. The unmarked
text: car has pulled up behind the limo and other PLAINCLOTHESMEN
text: stand next to it. PUPKIN and the two PLAINCLOTHESMEN start
text: walking the ten yards or so to the bar-restaurant.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 144 INT: THE BAR-RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: PUPKIN marches in flanked by the PLAINCLOTHESMEN. The
text: clock over the bar reads 11:30. RITA looks up from talking
text: with a CUSTOMER and sees PUPKIN. She says nothing. She
text: just looks at him. There are five CUSTOMERS at the bar. A
text: working class COUPLE in their late fifties are half-stewed,
text: the man telling the woman that her friend, Maud, isn't
dialog: really her friend because she wants $150 for a used
text: refrigerator. A few seats down, two MEN in their mid-
text: forties, in wind-breakers are locked in an intense but
text: inaudible conversation. And, close to the television set
text: which hangs over the far end of the bar sits a MOUSY MAN
text: with glasses, who looks like an accountant. He is sipping
text: a beer, his eyes fixed on the set where the CBS late movie
text: is just showing its logo. PUPKIN marches up to the bar.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (urgently to RITA)
dialog: Turn on Langford. Seven.
speaker_heading: MOUSY MAN
dialog: Hey! I'm watching this.
text: RITA keeps staring at PUPKIN.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Just turn it. Come on.
speaker_heading: MOUSY MAN
dialog: I was here first, mister. You can't
dialog: just walk in like this. It isn't
dialog: fair.
text: RITA glances at the MAN. PUPKIN can't wait. He vaults
text: onto the bar and turns the set to the Langford Show, just
text: as, on screen, he walks from the wings onto the stage to
text: the applause of the studio audience. Perched atop the bar,
text: standing next to the image of himself, PUPKIN looks down at
text: RITA, a smile of pride and triumph on his face.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 145 MONTAGE -- NIGHT
text: PUPKIN walking onto television screens in various homes
text: across America -- in a chic New York living room, in a
text: suburban bedroom, in the parlor of an Indiana farmhouse,
text: in a kitchen where a COUPLE is in the middle of a raging
text: domestic quarrel, in an otherwise dark bedroom where a
text: COUPLE is in the throes of lovemaking, in a bar, a station
text: house, in a television store window display.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 146 INT: MARSHA'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
text: MARSHA has just removed her dress and stands in her bra and
text: panties as LANGFORD unwraps the last tape from about his
text: ankles. The room is swimming in tape, like an enormous
text: boa constrictor gone mad. MARSHA moves towards LANGFORD,
text: her arms open.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Oh, baby. Baby.
text: LANGFORD frees his ankles of tape just in time to side-step
text: MARSHA and moves quickly to the dining room table where he
text: grabs the gun. He trains it on her.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Stop!
text: MARSHA moves toward him. He pulls the trigger, releasing
text: a plastic pellet that hits MARSHA in the stomach, stinging her.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Ow!
text: LANGFORD glances down in horror at the gun which he now
text: realizes is a toy and looks up in horror to see MARSHA,
text: bigger than life, bearing down on him.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Don't be afraid of Marsha, baby.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 147 INT: BAR-RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: The CUSTOMERS are watching the conclusion of Pupkin's
text: monologue, along with the PLAINCLOTHESMEN and PUPKIN. WE
text: COME IN a split second after a joke. The CUSTOMERS laugh,
text: with the exception of the MOUSY MAN who is waiting, in bad
text: humor, for Pupkin's act to finish. The PLAINCLOTHESMEN
text: laugh reluctantly. PUPKIN, no longer standing on the bar,
text: but back down with the others, watches with fascination.
text: RITA watches grimly, occasionally glancing at PUPKIN.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN on TV
dialog: But I figured it this way: better to
dialog: be King for a Night than Schmuck for
dialog: a Lifetime. (audience and CUSTOMERS
dialog: laugh) Good night, ladies and
dialog: gentlemen, and God bless you.
text: The television audience applauds and the CUSTOMERS applaud
text: and cheer in good humor except for the MOUSY MAN. The
text: HALF-STEWED MAN leans across his WOMAN to yell at PUPKIN
text: as the two FRIENDS in windbreakers congratulate PUPKIN at
text: the same time. There is a brief moment of carnival
dialog: excitement.
scene_heading: HALF-STEWED MAN FIRST FRIEND
dialog: Hey, that's pretty good. (to PUPKIN)
dialog: Schmuck for a Lifetime! How do you think up all
dialog: (to the WOMAN) You know that stuff?
dialog: who he's talkin' about?
dialog: Your brother!
speaker_heading: SECOND FRIEND
scene_heading: HALF-STEWED WOMAN It's a trick, that's
dialog: What about your all. Larry can do it
dialog: brother? as good as him.
scene_heading: HALF-STEWED MAN MOUSY MAN
dialog: What about him? Is it over now?
scene_heading: HALF-STEWED WOMAN FIRST FRIEND
dialog: He's another one. He's funnier than Larry.
dialog: Larry just makes a lot
text: HALF-STEWED MAN of faces.
dialog: (getting a little angry)
dialog: I told you to shut up about MOUSY MAN
dialog: my brother. (to PUPKIN) Well, if nobody
dialog: She doesn't know nuthin'. minds ...
text: PUPKIN takes all this praise and excitement with a shy
text: smile of satisfaction, glancing at RITA from time to time
text: for her reaction. She merely stares at PUPKIN with a sad
text: expression on her face.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Come on, Rita. Don't spoil the party.
dialog: (to the CUSTOMERS) Drinks all around
dialog: on me.
scene_heading: HALF-STEWED MAN
text: (in a loud voice, to HALF-
speaker_heading: STEWED WOMAN)
dialog: What about the hundred and fifty?
dialog: We never saw a penny outta your
dialog: brother.
scene_heading: HALF-STEWED WOMAN
dialog: That's because my brother is a family
dialog: man, not like Phil.
text: The argument between the HALF-STEWED MAN and his WOMAN
text: continues at the end of the bar. The two FRIENDS have
text: resumed their intense conversation.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (to the two FRIENDS)
dialog: What'll you have?
speaker_heading: FIRST FRIEND
dialog: I'm okay. Thanks, pal.
speaker_heading: SECOND FRIEND
dialog: Me, too.
text: The MOUSY MAN has climbed up on the bar and has turned the
text: TV back to the late movie. He sits enthralled by a scene
dialog: of violence courtesy of Tony Curtis as the Boston
text: Strangler. PUPKIN looks down the bar at the STEWED COUPLE
text: to offer them drinks, but they are lost in an argument
text: over the relative merits of their brothers. PUPKIN turns
text: to the PLAINCLOTHESMEN.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: I don't suppose you're allowed anything.
dialog: (to RITA) I guess nobody's in a
dialog: celebrating mood. How about you?
dialog: You want something?
scene_heading: FIRST PLAINCLOTHESMAN
dialog: It's getting time, Pupkin.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
text: In a second.
speaker_heading: RITA
text: (in a sad, serious voice
speaker_heading: to PUPKIN)
dialog: That was true, wasn't it? ... about
dialog: the kidnapping.
text: PUPKIN nods and shrugs.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: Now you can say you knew me. That's
dialog: something, anyway.
scene_heading: FIRST PLAINCLOTHESMAN
dialog: Come on, Pupkin.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (to RITA, in a quiet,
dialog: tender voice)
dialog: I guess I've got go. Take care of
dialog: yourself, will you. And when you're
dialog: bored -- you know, when you're brushing
dialog: your teeth or something, give me a
dialog: thought, okay?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Okay.
text: The PLAINCLOTHESMEN lead PUPKIN out of the bar. The two
text: FRIENDS are still buried in their intense, private
text: conversation. The PLAINCLOTHESMEN and PUPKIN walk past
text: the HALF-STEWED COUPLE.
scene_heading: HALF-STEWED WOMAN
dialog: It's okay to talk about my sister,
dialog: but we can't say nuthin' about Phil,
dialog: is that it?
scene_heading: HALF-STEWED MAN
speaker_heading: (to PUPKIN)
dialog: She's just had one too many.
text: The PLAINCLOTHESMEN lead PUPKIN onto the street.
scene_heading: 148 EXT: THE BAR - NIGHT
text: As they walk the few steps to the car, the FIRST
text: PLAINCLOTHESMAN turns to PUPKIN.
scene_heading: FIRST PLAINCLOTHESMAN
dialog: I just don't get it, Pupkin. You're
dialog: gonna spend eight years in the can --
dialog: "minimum" -- and for what?
scene_heading: SECOND PLAINCLOTHESMAN
dialog: Yeah, Pupkin. You threw it all away.
speaker_heading: PUPKIN
dialog: (vaguely)
dialog: We'll see.
text: WE CLOSE IN on PUPKIN, smiling.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: 149 INT: THE JERRY LANGFORD SHOW STUDIO - NIGHT
text: The STAGE MANAGER is counting down. At zero, he points to
text: RICK ROSS who launches the orchestra into the Langford Show
text: theme song. BERT CANTER, standing stage right, speaks into
dialog: the mike.
speaker_heading: CANTER
dialog: And now! Direct from New York!
dialog: The Jerry Langford Show, starring
text: Jerry's special guest, out on bail,
dialog: Rupert Pupkin, the kidnapping King
dialog: of Comedy!!!!
text: The AUDIENCE applauds mightily and the FINAL CREDITS roll.
text: As they roll, the music to the Langford Show continues and
text: WE WATCH a MONTAGE that shows PUPKIN progressively taping
text: LANGFORD to the back of a brass bedstead on stage as the
text: two of them talk and laugh. By the end of the MONTAGE,
text: LANGFORD is once again mummified and PUPKIN, having
text: finished, bows and smiles. WE CLOSE on a FREEZE-FRAME
text: CLOSE UP of PUPKIN in ecstasy.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
