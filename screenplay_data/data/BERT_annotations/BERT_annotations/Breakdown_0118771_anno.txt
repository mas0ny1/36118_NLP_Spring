scene_heading: EXT. BOMBARDED NEIGHBORHOOD (WAR-TORN COUNTRY) - DAY
text: On the backslope of a mound of rubble, a three-man TV
text: crew (field producer, reporter, and cameraman, all
text: wearing flak jackets) waits while the cameraman, JEFFREY
text: TAYLOR, works to repair his malfunctioning minicam.
text: Throughout this sequence, ROD, the reporter, types on a
text: laptop computer, oblivious to what is happening around
dialog: him.
text: HOWARD, the field producer, lies on his stomach, peering
text: cautiously over the crest of the rubble through
text: binoculars.
text: Beyond him we see an empty street. It is lined with
text: buildings blasted by shells: a sawtooth wall in the
text: f.g., a ruined high-rise at the end of the street,
text: billboards in an unrecognizable foreign language.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: How about it, Jeff?
text: Jeff finishes his repair job, snaps the minicam closed.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Done.
text: Jeff slips the knife back in his pocket, scrambles over
text: the loose bricks and stones to a position next to Howard.
scene_heading: EXT. SAWTOOTH WALL - DAY
text: A frightened woman lurks nervously in the shelter of the
text: wall. She is young, in her early twenties, with shining
text: dark hair down to her shoulders. She's carrying an
dialog: armload of books.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE - DAY
text: Jeff focuses the minicam.
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: MINICAM POV
text: FRAMED in the viewfinder we see the frightened woman.
speaker_heading: HOWARD (O.S.)
dialog: Nice legs.
text: Jeff ignores Howard, PANS the minicam DOWN the street.
text: In the viewfinder we see the flash of sun on metal.
scene_heading: EXT. RUINED HIGH-RISE - DAY
text: A row of blasted windows. In one of the windows, a
text: sniper crouches. Sunlight glitters on his rifle barrel.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (matter-of-fact)
dialog: Sniper.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: High-rise. Top floor. Window in
dialog: the middle.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (looking through
dialog: his binoculars)
dialog: Stay on him. Stay on him. Now go
dialog: back to the woman. Now!
text: Jeff swings the minicam and --
scene_heading: EXT. SAWTOOTH WALL - MINICAM POV
text: -- the image blurs, then holds steady on the frightened
text: woman. Nervously, she peeks around the corner.
speaker_heading: HOWARD (O.S.)
text: Back to the sniper.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Stay tight on the sniper.
dialog: Jesus -- look at him! He's about
dialog: fourteen! Don't lose this!
text: Jeff kneels on the ridge, minicam on his shoulder.
dialog: 3.
scene_heading: EXT. RUINED HIGH-RISE - POV THROUGH VIEWFINDER
text: Jeff's minicam ZOOMS IN ON the sniper. The sniper sees
text: the woman peeking and gets his rifle in firing position.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: He sees her.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Stay on her. If she runs, widen
dialog: and try to get her and sniper in
text: the same frame.
text: Jeff turns his head away from the camera and stares at
dialog: Howard.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I said he sees her.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I heard you. Stay on her.
text: Jeff looks to Rod for support but he's busy typing,
text: oblivious.
text: Jeff hesitates, then lifts the minicam to his eye again.
scene_heading: EXT. RUINED HIGH-RISE
text: The sniper, taking aim.
scene_heading: EXT. SAWTOOTH WALL
text: The frightened woman decides to make a dash for it. She
text: takes off her high-heeled shoes, inhales deeply,
text: gathering herself to run.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE
text: Jeff watches through his viewfinder:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: No... no...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: The frightened woman bolts, sprinting barefoot across the
text: cobblestones, skirt lifted, slender legs flashing.
dialog: 4.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE
text: Jeff jumps to his feet, waves the minicam, shouting:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Sniper! Sniper! Sni--
speaker_heading: STREET
text: The woman looks up in Jeff's direction, confused,
dialog: breaking stride --
text: We hear a burst of automatic gunfire --
scene_heading: RUINED HIGH-RISE
text: In the window, the winking muzzle-flash of the sniper's
dialog: AK-47.
speaker_heading: STREET
text: The woman's body jolts from the impact of the bullets.
text: The books go flying from her hand. She spins to the
text: pavement, her hair billowing.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: just stands there, a shattered expression. The camera
text: hangs at his side. He stares at the dead woman as a pool
text: of dark blood expands around her body.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LOGAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (BOSTON) - RUNWAY -
speaker_heading: NIGHT
text: A 747 touches down on the tarmac.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL - NIGHT
text: A late-model Jeep Cherokee is parked at the arrival curb.
text: AMY TAYLOR, Jeff's wife, peers out from behind the wheel,
text: scanning the crowd.
speaker_heading: HER POV
text: Jeff, carrying a single bag slung over his shoulder,
text: emerges from the terminal.
dialog: 5.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Amy gets out of the car, grinning. Jeff sees her and
text: hurries over. He drops his bag and they fall into each
text: other's arms, kissing hungrily. These are two people
text: passionately in love with each other.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: God, I missed you.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Let's get out of here. Where's
dialog: your equipment? Don't tell me you
dialog: checked it?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (holds up his bag)
dialog: This is it.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No camera?
text: Jeff shakes his head no.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No nothing?
text: Again Jeff shakes his head. Amy arches an eyebrow.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Ah ha.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JEFF AND AMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: A modest apartment in the Back Bay neighborhood. Not
text: much furniture, but lots of books and CD's. On the
text: walls, blow-ups of arty photographs -- Amy in modeling
text: poses, plus many black-and-white scenery stills.
text: Jeff's bag is unopened on the floor. We see two nearly
text: full wine glasses on a table. The CAMERA TRACKS DOWN a
text: hallway TO the open bedroom door.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: More framed photographs.
text: Amy lies in bed, curled up against a pillow. The sheets
text: are tangled in post-coital disarray, the only sign of
text: disorder in this neatly arranged room.
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: CLOSER
text: Amy stirs, reaching her hand out toward the other side of
text: the bed, which is empty. She opens her eyes, surprised
text: to find herself alone.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Jeff?
dialog: No reply.
text: Something catches her attention from across the room.
text: She rises, pulls a loose robe around herself and pads
text: over to a closed door. She knocks softly.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Can I come in?
speaker_heading: JEFF (O.S.)
dialog: Sure.
scene_heading: INT. DARKROOM - NIGHT
text: A walk-in closet has been converted into a small
text: photographic darkroom. Moist 8 X 10 prints hang from a
text: clothesline, bathed in a warm red glow. The images are
text: moody black and white landscapes.
text: Jeff stands over the developer, timing a print. Amy
text: enters through a thick black curtain behind him. He
text: doesn't look up.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Couldn't sleep?
text: Jeff shakes his head. Amy looks over his shoulder at a
text: landscape photograph in the developing tray.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I remember when you took that. We
dialog: had fun on that trip, didn't we?
text: Jeff nods. Amy looks at him. After a beat:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You want to talk about it?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: There's nothing to talk about.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: C'mon, Jeff.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I told you. I quit. Walked out.
dialog: end of story.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: That's it?
text: Jeff nods.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Whatever happened back there
dialog: wasn't your responsibility. You
dialog: can't keep beating yourself up
text: over it.
text: He says nothing.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What do you think? You could have
dialog: stopped that girl from getting
dialog: killed?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You don't understand...
text: He stops, lifts his eyes.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It was different this time.
text: He breaks off and pushes through the curtain. She
text: watches him go.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - KITCHEN AREA - NIGHT
text: Jeff pours himself a glass of milk. Amy enters, stands
text: on the other side of the counter. Jeff doesn't meet her
text: eyes. After a beat:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I talked to Reynolds.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: He thinks I could still get the
dialog: job at the San Diego station.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh, Jeff, you didn't...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Think of it. Low pressure, a
dialog: steady paycheck. So I shoot city
dialog: council meetings -- how bad could
dialog: it be?
text: She looks at him, concerned.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Is that what you really want -- or
dialog: are you just running away?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Who's running? It's good money,
dialog: full benefits. I'm tired of
dialog: freelance. We could finally put
text: some money in the bank.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You know I'll never stand in your
dialog: way. But you've worked so hard.
dialog: Are you sure you want to throw it
dialog: away?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Throw what away? Don't you get
dialog: it? I don't do anything. I sit,
dialog: I watch, I film -- I let it
dialog: happen.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You're supposed to let it happen.
dialog: It's your job.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: No, Amy. It's my excuse.
text: She looks at him, not understanding. He hesitates.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: That girl... it's like I was
dialog: paralyzed. I wanted to do
dialog: something, but I didn't. I just
text: stood there and watched her get
dialog: killed.
text: He looks at her, emotional.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Please, babe, I need this. Say
dialog: yes and we'll take as long as you
dialog: want -- drive cross-country and
dialog: make a vacation out of it. What
dialog: do you say?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Amy looks at him, considering. We hear a faint RUSH OF
text: WIND. Then it gets LOUDER... LOUDER... and --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CREDIT MONTAGE - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - LOW ANGLE -
scene_heading: DAY AND NIGHT
text: The metallic grill of the Cherokee explodes INTO FRAME as
text: the car whooshes over us, hurtling down the Massachusetts
dialog: Turnpike.
text: In a SERIES OF SHOTS, with CREDITS OVER, we see landmarks
dialog: form the cross-country trip: a Pennsylvania Dutch
text: farmhouse, a smoke-spewing factory in Ohio, the
dialog: Mississippi River, Kansas wheat fields, Loveland Pass and
dialog: the Continental Divide.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN DESERT - DAY
text: The middle of nowhere. Sand, weeds and sagebrush. A
text: two-lane highway stretches to the horizon like a ribbon
dialog: of asphalt.
text: The Cherokee cruises along the road. Its Massachusetts
text: plates seem out of place in this stark landscape.
text: There are no other vehicles.
text: MOVING CLOSER, we see that Jeff is driving. Amy is sound
text: asleep in the reclined passenger seat.
text: In back, luggage, moving boxes, camera cases.
scene_heading: INT. JEEP CHEROKEE - DAY
text: The AIR CONDITIONING WHISPERS. On the console are two
text: empty Styrofoam McDonald's coffee cups and a state-of-
dialog: the-art Nikon Camera.
text: Jeff stretches in the driver's seat. He forces his eyes
text: open, fighting sleep. He reaches for the coffee cup...
text: it's empty. He glances into the back of the Jeep. There
text: is a thermos of coffee on the back seat.
text: Keeping one hand on the wheel, he reaches for the thermos
text: and fumbles it to the floor. He strains to reach it. He
dialog: doesn't notice...
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - 200 YARDS AHEAD
text: A slow-moving Dodge Ram pickup truck is approaching the
text: highway along a small road that cuts across the desert
dialog: floor.
text: The pickup, equipped with oversized tires, roll bar, and
text: a CB whip antenna, bounces over the uneven terrain and
text: turns onto the highway, stopping just before entering
dialog: Jeff's lane.
scene_heading: INT. CHEROKEE - DAY
text: Jeff glances up just in time to see the Ram lurch into
text: the road in front of him. Jeff drops the thermos and
dialog: spins the wheel!
text: Amy's eyes fly open --
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: The Cherokee goes into a wild looping skid. The Ram
text: jerks to a halt as the Cherokee whips past, averting a
text: collision by inches.
scene_heading: INT. CHEROKEE - DAY
text: Jeff expels a breath. Amy turns to see the pickup
text: stopped in the road. She looks at him, concerned.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Jesus, Jeff...
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Sorry. I took my eyes off the
dialog: road.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (seeing thermos
dialog: on floor)
dialog: Maybe it's time we took a break,
dialog: you know?
text: Jeff nods, looks in the rearview mirror.
speaker_heading: HIS POV - PICKUP
text: halted in the middle of the road. Inside, dimly-visible
text: through tinted windows, are two figures in cowboy hats.
text: The driver leans out the window and gives Jeff the
dialog: finger.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: BACK TO JEFF
text: angry at himself. He looks over at Amy.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I'll pull over next chance we get.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Sorry...
text: He glances in the rearview again, still a bit shaken.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
text: A small desert gas station/mini-mart just off the
text: highway. A sign over the building: "Last Gas For 30
text: Miles." The Cherokee is parked at the pumps, hood
dialog: raised.
text: Jeff comes out of the mini-mart, carrying a plastic quart
text: of oil. He unscrews the cap and starts to fill the
text: crankcase, careful not to spill on the new engine. In
text: the b.g., Amy is visible inside the store, browsing a
dialog: magazine rack.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENIENCE MART - SAME TIME
text: Amy thumbs through a cheap tourist guide, The Desert
text: Southwest. A TRUCK DRIVER stands nearby, perusing the
text: magazines. He glances in Amy's direction, notices what
text: she's reading.
speaker_heading: TRUCKER
dialog: On vacation?
text: Amy looks up at him. He's 50ish, plain-looking,
text: friendly, wearing a "U.S.A." logo baseball cap.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Sort of. We're moving, actually.
speaker_heading: TRUCKER
dialog: Whereabouts?
text: Amy hesitates. She's not used to talking with strangers,
text: but the guy seems harmless enough.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: California. We thought we'd take
dialog: the scenic route.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: TRUCKER
dialog: Huh. In that case, you oughta try
dialog: the Pass Road, 'bout thirty miles
dialog: west. Real pretty, makes a loop
text: through the hills, then hooks back
text: up with the highway.
text: Amy smiles politely, moves toward the cash register.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Thanks. I'll mention it to my
dialog: husband.
text: The Trucker tips his cap.
speaker_heading: TRUCKER
dialog: Okay, then. Good luck. Enjoy the
dialog: rest of your trip.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
text: As Jeff continues pouring the oil, he doesn't notice the
text: mud-streaked Dodge Ram pickup pulling up to the pumps
text: behind him. The driver, EARL, climbs out. The other man
text: remains in the cab with the smoked windows rolled up.
text: Earl is a beefy man about Jeff's age. He wears a sweat-
text: stained Western hat, cowboy boots and a T-shirt with the
text: sleeves cut out to display his tattooed biceps. He
text: saunters over to the Cherokee, stands there a beat,
text: looking over Jeff's shoulder.
text: Jeff senses something behind him, turns. His eyes widen
text: as he sees Earl, recognizes the pickup as the one he
text: nearly hit a few minutes before. Earl stares at him,
text: unsmiling.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: (flatly)
dialog: Nice car.
text: Jeff is in an awkward position. He's got a half-full
text: upside-down bottle of oil in his hands. If he lifts it
text: now, he'll spill on the engine. He turns his gaze back
text: to the engine, decides to keep pouring.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Thanks.
text: Earl steps around to the open passenger window, peers in.
text: Jeff watches him, wary.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Air, C.D., leather -- I guess you
text: sprung for the whole nine yards.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Then again, out here, what you
dialog: really need's a C.B. radio.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Is that right?
text: The oil bottle empties out. Relieved, Jeff pulls it away
text: and screws back on the crankcase cap. He shuts the hood
text: with a thunk and moves around to the side of the car to
text: remove the gas nozzle from the tank. Earl blocks his
dialog: path.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: 'Course, if you use a C.B., you
dialog: gotta have a handle.
text: Jeff says nothing. This is not a friendly conversation.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: How about Shit-for-Brains?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You damn near killed us back
dialog: there, boy.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Look, I'm sorry, I didn't see you.
dialog: You pulled out in front of me.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: The hell I did. I saw what
dialog: happened.
text: Looking past Earl, Jeff sees Amy come out of the mini-
text: mart with a bag of groceries. He speaks carefully,
text: anxious to avoid a confrontation.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: How about if we just forget it,
dialog: okay? I'm sorry it happened. I
dialog: don't want any trouble.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: (snorting)
dialog: Yeah. I bet you don't.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Earl glares at Jeff before turning away. He passes Amy,
text: gives her a broad smile.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Howdy, ma'am. Caught this fellow
dialog: tryin' to steal your Cherokee.
text: Amy takes in the situation. She nods politely. Earl
text: continues into the mini-mart. She approaches Jeff,
dialog: puzzled.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What was that about?
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: Nothing. Guy in the truck.
dialog: Thinks I tried to hit him.
text: Jeff glances apprehensively at the man in the pickup, who
text: has not moved during the scene. He looks back at the
dialog: mini-mart.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: C'mon, let's go.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You want me to drive?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Later. Just get in.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Is something wrong?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: No, let's just go.
text: Jeff climbs in behind the wheel. Amy glances at him and
text: gets in the car. Jeff keys the IGNITION and pulls away.
scene_heading: INT. CHEROKEE - DRIVING - DAY
text: As Jeff steers back onto the highway, he glances in the
text: rear-view mirror, sees --
speaker_heading: MIRROR POV
text: Earl coming out of the mini-mart, staring after the
text: disappearing Jeep.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Jeff shifts in his seat, relieved to be getting away from
text: there. Amy watches the speedometer as it climbs to 75,
dialog: then 80, then 85.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: This isn't the Grand Prix, you
dialog: know.
text: Jeff releases his foot from the accelerator. The needle
text: sinks back down to 65.
text: She gives him a long contemplative look.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What's bothering you?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I told you. Nothing.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: The guy was an asshole.
text: Keeping an eye on the rear-view mirror, Jeff nods toward
text: the grocery bag, trying to change the subject.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What'd you get?
text: Amy pulls out an assortment of candy bars and junk food.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Junk food fiesta. Sno Balls, Yoo
dialog: Hoo, Moon pies... can you believe
dialog: they still make this stuff?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You kidding. It's probably
dialog: gourmet cuisine around here.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - AERIAL - DAY
text: Far below us, the Cherokee traces the empty highway.
text: There are no buildings, no houses, no other vehicles.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHEROKEE - DRIVING - FEW MINUTES LATER
text: Jeff drives in silence. Amy stares out the window,
text: bored. Looking for a distraction, she picks up a
text: cellophane package of doughnuts and peruses the label.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (trying to brighten
dialog: the mood)
dialog: This is crazy. Look at this.
dialog: Says if you win this mail-in
dialog: contest, you can choose either
dialog: ninety thousand dollars or ninety
dialog: thousand doughnuts.
text: She gives him a playful glance.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What would you do with ninety
dialog: thousand doughnuts?
text: Jeff shrugs, disinterested.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I dunno... Sell 'em for thirty
dialog: cents each and pay off this car.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Very funny.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Alright, what about ninety
dialog: thousand dollars? What would you
dialog: do with that?
text: Jeff stares out the window. He's not into this.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I don't know. Look, Amy, I'm
dialog: not --
text: Suddenly his eyes drop to the console between them --
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Sonofabitch!! My camera! He
dialog: stole my camera!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (startled)
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: The redneck at the gas station!
dialog: He lifted it right under my nose!
dialog: My brand new Nikon.
dialog: (pounds wheel
dialog: in frustration)
dialog: Goddammit.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Should we go back?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What's the use. He's probably
text: halfway to Bumblefuck now, the
dialog: bastard.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Look, maybe if we call the cops --
text: Jeff is about to reply when suddenly the car bucks.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What the hell?
text: The car gives another jolt.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What'd you do?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Nothing. I --
text: A warning light flashes on the instrument panel. The
text: brakes and steering lose power. The engine quits cold.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Hang on -- I can't steer!
text: The CAR bucks and SCREECHES. After a few HICCUPS, it
text: jerks to a halt, just beyond a crest in the road.
text: For a moment, they sit there dazed, staring ahead at the
text: empty road. Then Amy notices an object on the floor --
text: the Nikon. She picks it up.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: Found your camera.
text: He rolls his eyes. He yanks the hood release and gets
dialog: out.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: Steam pours from under the hood of the Cherokee. Amy
text: gets out and looks around at the scorched wasteland.
text: Jeff goes to the front of the car, gropes under the hood
text: for the release latch. He yanks his hand away, burned by
text: the hot metal.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Ow!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I'm fine.
text: Amy moves to Jeff to examine the burn. She reaches out.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: I said I'm fine, okay?
text: Jeff lifts the hood, examines the engine. He tugs on a
text: cable, checks the battery connection and radiator.
text: He goes to the passenger's side and takes a hand-held
text: cellular phone from the glove box. He dials zero and
text: hits "send." The PHONE BEEPS.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Out of range?
text: Jeff grunts, tosses the phone on the seat. It bounces
text: and lands on the floor. Amy watches as he returns to the
text: engine and begins unscrewing the radiator cap.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What's going on, Jeff?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What's it look like? I'm trying
dialog: to fix the car.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Not the car.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What's going on with you?
text: Jeff busies himself with the engine, not answering.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It's been a month since you got
dialog: back. You can't keep shutting me
dialog: out like this.
text: Jeff says nothing.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Jeff, I'm talking to you.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (flaring)
dialog: Look, I really don't want to go
dialog: into this right now. I'm changing
dialog: jobs, our finances are fucked, and

scene_heading: JEFF'S POV - DODGE RAM PICKUP

speaker_heading: BACK TO JEFF
text: watching the Ram speed away.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Asshole...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (looking down
dialog: the road)
dialog: Jeff --
text: A quarter-mile away, the pickup is slowing. It pulls a
text: U-turn and stops, facing the Cherokee. It just sits
text: there, ENGINE IDLING.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What the hell?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What's he doing?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I don't know.
text: Jeff watches the pickup, frowning. Then, from the
text: opposite direction, they hear a LOW RUMBLE. They turn
dialog: and stare at --
dialog: 20.
scene_heading: MASSIVE TRACTOR-TRAILER
text: coming over a crest in the road.
text: It's a huge eighteen-wheeler. A white 1988 Peterbilt.
text: It grinds into low gear and slows, BRAKES CREAKING.
text: The TRUCK comes to a halt with a HISS of compressed air.
speaker_heading: DOWN HIGHWAY
text: the PICKUP STARTS UP again. It pulls another U-turn and
text: drives away, melting into the desert.
speaker_heading: AMY
text: breathes a sigh of relief.
text: The driver dismounts from the cab, leaving the ENGINE
text: IDLING. We recognize him as the Trucker in the mini-
text: mart. He removes his cap, revealing a shock of
text: prematurely white hair. He is well-shaven, his clothes
text: immaculate. His name is Red.
speaker_heading: RED (TRUCKER)
dialog: You folks all right?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Yeah. Our car broke down.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: I figured that much. You want a
dialog: hand pushing it off the road?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Thanks, I'd appreciate it. Amy,
dialog: you want to steer?
text: Amy gets behind the wheel and puts the shift in neutral.
text: Jeff and Red push the car to the shoulder. As they push,
text: Jeff glances at the CB antenna on Red's cab.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Think you could radio a tow truck
dialog: for us?
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: I sure would if I could, mister,
dialog: but my C.B. blew a fuse this
dialog: morning. I'm waiting till I hit
text: the truck stop on I-40 to get it
dialog: fixed.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: How far is that?
speaker_heading: RED
text: About 60 miles.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Oh.
text: Red walks around to the front of the car and peers down
text: at the exposed engine.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: I'd offer to take a look, but it's
dialog: hard to say with these new
dialog: engines. Used to be, you could
dialog: give 'em a kick and a holler and
dialog: they'd start right up. Now it's
dialog: all computers and chips.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: It's a new car.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: That could be the problem. You
dialog: been running it pretty fast?
text: Amy gives Jeff a reprimanding look. It's subtle, but Red
dialog: notices.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Tell you what. If you want a
dialog: ride, there's a little diner up
dialog: the road. Belle's. They got a
dialog: pay phone. You could call a tow
dialog: truck from there.
text: Jeff considers this, glances back to where the Dodge Ram
dialog: was last seen.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Nice of you to offer. But we've
dialog: got a lot of stuff in the car. I
dialog: think we're better off waiting for
text: a cop to come along.
text: Amy rolls her eyes. Red sees the look, trying not to
text: smile. He glances up at a small plane flying overhead.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: (casually)
dialog: Suit yourself. Not many cops on
dialog: this road, that's why the truckers
dialog: use it. Maybe you'll get lucky.
dialog: (tipping his cap)
dialog: Good luck.
text: He turns and heads back toward his truck. Amy looks at
text: Jeff. She waits till the trucker is out of earshot.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Are you nuts?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We don't know this guy.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: He's offering to help. It could
dialog: be hours before anyone else comes
dialog: along. It's 100 degrees. You
dialog: really want to be stuck out here?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Amy, I've got my equipment in the
dialog: car. All our stuff. What if
dialog: those guys come back and we're not
dialog: here?
dialog: (turns away,
dialog: quietly to
dialog: himself)
dialog: Jesus... don't be stupid...
text: Amy hears this. She's had enough. Flares.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Stupid is sitting out here waiting
dialog: for a cop when we already have a
dialog: ride.
text: In the b.g., the TRUCK is THROTTLING UP. Then, mad and
dialog: careless:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Stupid was letting you talk me
dialog: into leaving Boston.
text: She turns away. The truck starts to pull out. She bites
text: her lip, thinking, then steps into the road and flags the
text: truck down. Red brakes.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Excuse me? Do you think you could
dialog: drop me at that diner?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Sure thing. How about you,
dialog: mister? I could take you both
dialog: just as easy.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: That's okay. My husband wants to
dialog: stay with the car. I'll just get
dialog: my purse.
text: She goes to the passenger side of the Jeep for her purse.
text: Jeff follows, lowering his voice.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What do you think you're doing?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm going to the diner. I'm going
dialog: to call a tow truck. Then I'm
dialog: going to order an iced tea and
dialog: wait. Good-bye, Jeff.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (firm)
dialog: You're not riding with that guy.
dialog: End of story.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You wanted to be alone. Well...
dialog: you're alone. Why don't you take
dialog: the time to get your head
dialog: together?
text: She walks to the truck. Jeff stands there. She climbs
text: into the cab. Red moves some papers out of the way.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Watch your step, ma'am.
text: She pulls the door shut. The TRUCK THROTTLES UP and
text: pulls away. Jeff watches the truck dwindle in the
text: distance, flashers blinking. After a beat, the flashers
dialog: cease.
scene_heading: SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROADSIDE - TWENTY MINUTES LATER
text: Beneath a blazing sun, Jeff paces restlessly in front of
text: the Cherokee, checking his watch, wiping beads of sweat
text: from his face. He looks down the highway.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Nothing in sight. Extremely bored, he wanders over to
text: the raised hood and studies the engine again.
text: After a few moments, something catches his eye. Curious,
text: he kneels down and peers under the chassis. He frowns.
scene_heading: JEFF'S POV - LOOSE WIRE
text: dangling under the engine.
speaker_heading: BACK TO JEFF
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Oh for Christ's sake...
text: He pulls his Swiss Army knife from his pocket and slides
text: under the car. Working with the screwdriver blade of the
text: knife, he reconnects the plug to its socket. In the
text: process, his hands and shirt become stained with grease.
text: Jeff slides out from under the car, brushes himself off
text: and gets behind the wheel. He tosses the Swiss Army
text: knife on the center console and keys the ignition. The
text: ENGINE ROARS to life.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT ROAD - MINUTES LATER
text: The Cherokee speeds down the empty highway.
scene_heading: INT. CHEROKEE - SAME TIME
text: Jeff drives, a determined expression.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY
text: The Jeep blows past.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BELLE'S DINER - DAY
text: A weather-beaten structure with a gravel parking lot. A
text: peeling sign on the roof: "Belle's: Beer &amp; Food."
text: There is a phone booth outside.
text: The Cherokee pulls in and parks. Jeff CHIRPS the ALARM,
text: heads for the entrance.
dialog: 25.
scene_heading: INT. BELLE'S - DAY
text: Dark and dingy. Formica tables, a bar. Chunky customers
text: in K-Mart clothes sit at the bar, nursing beers and
text: watching a football game on a big MUTED TV.
text: Jeff enters and all conversation stops. The other
text: patrons turn and stare. After a moment, they return to
dialog: their beers.
text: Jeff glances around. No sign of Amy. No sign of Red.
text: A bored-looking BARTENDER stands behind the counter,
text: preparing a sandwich. Behind him, a blackboard menu.
text: Jeff approaches.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Excuse me.
text: The Bartender looks up, a cutting knife in his hand.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I was supposed to meet my wife
dialog: here.
text: The Bartender shrugs, gives him a look: Yeah, so?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Dark hair, slender, about five-
text: five. Wearing a pale blue
text: Benetton shirt.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: A pale blue what?
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: Benetton shirt.
text: The Bartender plops the sandwich on a plate, tears off an
dialog: order slip.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Hank! Your order's ready.
dialog: (to Jeff)
dialog: I been busy. They come and go.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It would've been within the last
text: half hour. She might've been with
dialog: a trucker?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
text: A trucker.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: Guy with a baseball cap. Driving
text: an eighteen wheeler.
text: The Bartender thinks a moment, shakes his head.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Don't ring a bell.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You sure?
text: The Bartender leans over the counter, calls out:
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Hey! Man here's looking for his
text: wife, dark hair, button-on shirt,
dialog: travelin' with a guy in a baseball
dialog: cap. Anybody see 'em?
text: Jeff looks up and down the counter. Blank faces, a few
text: disinterested shrugs, a few headshakes no.
text: A disheveled female barfly, FLO, grins up at him.
speaker_heading: FLO
dialog: Looks like she got away from ya,
dialog: cowboy.
text: A few of the regulars chuckle at this. Jeff ignores
text: them, turns back to the Bartender.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Could she have left a message with
dialog: another one of your employees?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Don't see how. I'm the only one
dialog: who works here.
text: Jeff scratches his head. This doesn't make any sense.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I don't understand. Is there
dialog: another Belle's Diner?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: (chuckles)
text: No siree. Definitely not.
text: Jeff clenches his jaw, takes another look around. An
text: elderly couple sit at a rear table, watching him. They
text: whisper to each other.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Shit.
text: He turns and goes outside...
scene_heading: EXT. BELLE'S - DAY
text: Jeff squints in the bright sunlight.
dialog: Maybe he got this place confused with a different diner.
text: He peers up at the sign. It says "Belle's," all right.
text: He walks to the phone booth, looks inside. The phone
text: book is missing.
text: He picks up the receiver, listens for the dial tone...
text: Phone works okay. He hangs up.
text: He stands there for a moment, scanning the horizon in all
text: directions. There is nothing else out here, nowhere else
dialog: she could have gone.
text: Jeff marches back into the diner...
scene_heading: INT. DINER - DAY
text: Jeff goes to the Bartender.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Excuse me, how far is the next
dialog: town?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
text: About twenty miles.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Look, if my wife comes in -- her
dialog: name is Amy -- tell her I was
dialog: here. Tell her to stay put till I
dialog: get back, not to move. Would you
dialog: do that, please?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: (shrugs, bored)
dialog: Okay.
text: Jeff regards the Bartender skeptically. He takes one
text: last look around, then heads out.
dialog: 28.
scene_heading: EXT. BELLE'S - DAY
text: Jeff marches briskly to his car and opens the door,
text: forgetting to deactivate the alarm. The SIREN WAILS.
text: Jeff fumbles for the remote and shuts if OFF.
scene_heading: HIGH ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER
text: The Cherokee pulls out of the parking lot, kicking up
dialog: gravel.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHEROKEE - DAY
text: The stereo is off, the windows rolled up. Jeff drives,
text: his jaw set tightly.
text: The speedometer reads 88 mph.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - MINUTES LATER
text: The Cherokee crests a rise...
scene_heading: INT. CHEROKEE - DAY
text: ... and then across the desert plain, traveling on
text: another road, he sees it...
speaker_heading: PETERBILT
text: The 18-wheeler that picked up Amy. Cruising leisurely.
text: Jeff presses the accelerator...
scene_heading: EXT. FORK IN ROAD - DAY
text: The Cherokee turns sharply onto the other road.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - AERIAL VIEW - DAY
text: The Cherokee speeds down the road, gaining on the
text: Peterbilt. It comes up behind.
dialog: 29.
scene_heading: INT. CHEROKEE - DAY
text: Jeff HONKS his HORN, flashes his lights.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: C'mon, you fat-ass. Pull over.
text: Either the driver doesn't notice, or he's ignoring Jeff,
text: but the truck does not slow down.
text: Jeff shifts into the oncoming lane and pulls alongside
text: the cab. He HONKS again and waves, gesturing for the
text: truck to pull over. But the Peterbilt maintains its
dialog: speed.
text: Jeff cranes his neck to get a glimpse of the driver...
speaker_heading: POV SHOT
text: It's Red, alright. But he's wearing a different cap.
dialog: FROM this ANGLE, we can't see into the passenger side of
dialog: the cab.
text: Red peers down at Jeff, puzzled. Jeff shouts at him,
dialog: waves:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Pull over! Pull over!
text: Red suddenly notices something ahead in the road, BLARES
speaker_heading: his HORN.
text: Jeff looks up, sees --
text: An RV camper approaching in the oncoming lane!
speaker_heading: HIGHWAY
text: Jeff swerves onto the far shoulder as the RV whooshes
text: past in the opposite direction, HORN BLARING.
speaker_heading: CHEROKEE
text: Jeff is rattled, catching his breath. He swings back
text: onto the road.
speaker_heading: HIGHWAY
text: Jeff slips in ahead of the Peterbilt, then starts weaving
text: and braking, forcing the truck to slow.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Both vehicles pull to the side of the road and stop.
text: Jeff leaps out of the Cherokee and runs over as Red
text: climbs down from the empty cab.
text: (NOTE: Throughout this scene, various cars and trucks
dialog: pass in either direction.)
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Jesus, pal, what the hell you
dialog: doing?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I was signaling you to stop.
dialog: Didn't you see me?
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: No.
text: Jeff reacts. How thick can this guy be?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Where's my wife?
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: My wife. Where is she?
text: Red gives him a puzzled look.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: How should I know where your wife
dialog: is?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I checked at the diner. No one
dialog: saw her there.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Mister, I don't know what you're
dialog: talking about.
dialog: Jeff stares -- is this guy nuts?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You gave her a ride. You were
dialog: supposed to drop her at Belle's
dialog: diner.
text: Red searches his memory, trying to be as helpful as
text: possible. He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Nope. Sorry.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: How can you not remember? It was
dialog: just half an hour ago, for
dialog: chrissakes!
text: Red gives him a peculiar look.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Mister, I never seen you before in
dialog: my life.
text: Suddenly, there is a loud SQUAWK from inside the cab --
text: the CB RADIO.
speaker_heading: CB VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Breaker, breaker -- Iron Man, you
dialog: copy?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (reacts)
dialog: Your radio works --
dialog: (locks eyes with Red)
dialog: What the hell are you doing -- ?
text: Jeff freaks out, circling the truck, calling loudly:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Amy? Amy?! You in there?
text: Red shrinks back, unnerved.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Look, mister, I don't know what
dialog: you want, but --
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I want my fucking wife, is what I
dialog: want! What have you done to her?!
text: Red's eyes dart to something in the distance. Jeff
dialog: catches this, turns...
speaker_heading: SHERIFF'S PATROL CAR
text: Cruising toward them.
text: Jeff runs into the middle of the road and waves
text: frantically. The patrol car switches on its flash bar
text: and speeds up, pulling to a stop behind the Peterbilt.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: SHERIFF BOYD, 50ish, climbs out, sizing up the situation.
text: Jeff runs over.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Officer, I need your help!
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: What's your problem?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I don't know, this guy has my
dialog: wife!
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: Calm down, sir. Tell me what's
text: going on.
text: Jeff catches his breath.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I don't know what the hell's going
dialog: on. Last time I saw her she was
dialog: with this guy in his truck. Now
dialog: he's saying he's never seen her!
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Officer, he's crazy -- I don't
dialog: know what he's talking about.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Don't lie, you son of a bitch!
text: The Sheriff unsnaps the safety strap on his holster...
dialog: just a precaution.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: All right -- everybody just calm
dialog: down.
dialog: (to Jeff)
dialog: Sir, you want to tell me what
dialog: happened?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Our car broke down. This guy
dialog: stopped to help us, said he'd
dialog: drive my wife to a pay phone. But
dialog: she never showed up.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: (turning to Red)
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: I don't know, officer. I'm
dialog: driving along, suddenly this fella
text: runs me off the road and starts
dialog: hollering about his wife. I
dialog: swear, I never seen the guy
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: And you didn't give his wife a
dialog: ride?
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: He's lying!
text: The Sheriff takes a long look at both of them, unsure
text: what to think. He turns back to Red.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: Sir, all right with you if I
dialog: search your truck?
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Hell yes, officer. Go right
dialog: ahead. Name's Red, by the way.
dialog: Red Barr.
dialog: (pulls out his
dialog: wallet)
dialog: My permits are all current. You
dialog: can check 'em out.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: That won't be necessary yet. Just
text: stand back behind the line. Both
dialog: of you.
text: As Red closes his wallet, several credit cards fall to
text: the ground. He bends to scoop them up. Jeff eyes this
dialog: suspiciously.
text: The Sheriff climbs up into the truck.
scene_heading: INT. PETERBILT CAB - DAY
text: The Sheriff pokes his head inside, looks around.
dialog: Pretty much what you'd expect in a long-haul big rig:
text: a CB radio, a plastic Jesus, a map of the U.S. taped to
text: the ceiling with hundreds of magic marker X's showing
text: where the truck has been.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The Sheriff looks into the sleeping area behind. A
text: blanket is folded over a foam mattress. A stained pillow
text: rests on top.
scene_heading: EXT. PETERBILT - DAY
text: Jeff and Red keep a careful eye on each other as the
text: Sheriff climbs down from the cab, wiping his hands.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: (to both of them)
dialog: All right, let's see your license
dialog: and registration.
text: Jeff and Red fish into their wallets and hand over
text: I.D.'s. The Sheriff examines them, comparing faces to
text: pictures and writing down names.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: What are you hauling today, Mr.
dialog: Barr?
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Nothing, empty load. I'm heading
dialog: to Fresno for a pick up -- ball
dialog: bearings or something.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: (eyeing him)
dialog: Long way to go empty.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Tell me about it. Too much
dialog: competition nowadays. One horse
dialog: guys like me gotta drive halfway
dialog: 'cross the country just to get a
dialog: payin' job.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (to Sheriff,
dialog: impatient)
dialog: Are we gonna keep looking or what?
text: The Sheriff hands back the I.D.'s.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: Yes, we are.
dialog: (to Red)
dialog: Sir, I'm gonna have to see
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: No problem. I understand.
dialog: 35.
scene_heading: EXT. REAR OF PETERBILT - DAY
text: Jeff and the Sheriff observe as Red unlatches two heavy
text: padlocks. Grunting, he raises the slatted METAL DOOR.
text: It retracts along the ceiling with a noisy RATTLE.
speaker_heading: INSIDE
text: The cavernous interior is mostly empty, except for a few
text: randomly strewn cardboard boxes, too small to contain a
dialog: person.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: (re: boxes)
dialog: Those yours?
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Yeah. Personal stuff. Clothes
dialog: and whatnot. You want to take a
dialog: look?
text: The Sheriff considers it, shakes his head.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: No. I think we're pretty much
dialog: done here. You're free to go.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (reacts)
dialog: Whoa, whoa -- wait a sec. That's
dialog: it? You're not going to question
dialog: him anymore?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: Sir, I searched the truck.
dialog: There's no evidence of suspicious
text: activity, no sign of struggle.
text: Red has been looking on. He chimes in, trying to be
dialog: helpful:
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Look, I don't mean to butt in, but
dialog: maybe you got my truck confused
dialog: with someone else's.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (lunges)
dialog: Go to hell, you sonofabitch --

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: Hey! Hey! You want to get
dialog: arrested? Now the man has a
dialog: point. This is a plain-looking,
dialog: John Doe truck. Maybe you did get
dialog: them mixed up.
text: Jeff stares at the Sheriff a beat, then bolts suddenly
text: for the front of the truck. He yanks open the door and
text: leaps up into the cab.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: Hey!
text: The Sheriff jogs after him. Red walks to the cab,
text: unconcerned.
scene_heading: INT. PETERBILT CAB - DAY
text: Jeff searches the cab for signs of Amy. He tosses aside
text: a jacket, rifles papers on the floor. There is nothing.
scene_heading: EXT. CAB - DAY
text: Sheriff Boyd looks up sternly as Jeff continues searching
text: the cab. Red watches calmly.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: Mr. Taylor, either you come down
dialog: from there or I'm going to have to
dialog: arrest you.
text: Jeff gives up reluctantly. He looks lame and desperate
text: and he knows it. He steps down from the cab, gritting
text: his teeth.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It was him. It was this truck.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: Uh-huh, I can see that. Did you
dialog: get a license plate?
text: Jeff stares at him, knows where this is going.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: What about the information on the
dialog: door panel. You recall any of
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I wasn't paying attention.
text: The Sheriff studies him a beat, nods.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: Mr. Taylor, did you by any chance
dialog: have a beef with your wife today?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What does that have to do with
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: Well, for starters, maybe she left
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I don't believe this...
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: I've seen it a hundred times.
dialog: Lovers, married couples, gay guys.
dialog: You put two people in a car long
dialog: enough, they'll go at it. Hell,
dialog: I've even seen men dump their
text: women on the side of the road, and
dialog: vice versa.
text: Jeff stares at the cop. Emphatic:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: My wife did not leave me.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: (cuts in)
dialog: Officer, I'm sorry, I'd like to
dialog: stay and help, but I really got to
dialog: make it to Fresno...
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: I understand. Go ahead, sir. I
dialog: appreciate your cooperation.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: This is insane. You're just going
dialog: to let him go?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: I've got his information. If we
dialog: need to find him later, we'll know
dialog: where to look.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Much obliged.
dialog: (to Jeff)
dialog: Good luck findin' your wife,
dialog: mister. No hard feelings.
text: Red climbs into the cab. Jeff watches helplessly,
text: resigned to the fact there's nothing more he can do. The

speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: Sir, I believe you that your wife
dialog: is missing. Maybe you got
dialog: confused about what truck she got
dialog: into, maybe you had a fight -- you
dialog: don't have to tell me. The point
dialog: is I'm trying to help.
text: He hands Jeff a card with an address printed on it.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: The town of Brackett's 31 miles
dialog: that way. My deputy's name is Len
dialog: Carver. He's a good man. He'll
dialog: help you fill out the necessary
dialog: forms if you want to report your
dialog: wife missing.
text: Jeff clenches his jaw as the words sink in. The Sheriff
text: softens, his tone sympathetic.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: If you want my opinion, your wife
dialog: is probably around here. Lost or
dialog: plenty pissed off and giving you a
dialog: scare. Either way, she'll turn
dialog: up.
text: As Jeff stares at the Sheriff, the police RADIO SQUAWKS.
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER (V.O.)
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Sheriff, this is dispatch. Mrs.
text: Gilbert's locked out of her
dialog: trailer again. Can you respond?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: 10-4, dispatch. Tell her I'm on
dialog: my way.
text: He racks the mike.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I want your name and badge number.
text: The Sheriff looks up at Jeff, sighs.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
text: Sheriff Arthur Boyd. 226-93.
dialog: This really isn't necessary --
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Don't tell me what's necessary,
dialog: goddamnit. I'm noting the exact
dialog: time of this conversation. 10:52
dialog: A.M.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: (exhaling)
dialog: Suit yourself, Mr. Taylor.
text: The Sheriff shifts into gear and drives away. Jeff is
text: left standing on the side of the road, desert in all
dialog: directions.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
text: A wall is covered with missing persons' notices.
text: Photographs of men, women and children stare back at us.
text: Names and dates are printed across the bottom of the
dialog: notices.
text: PULL BACK to reveal Jeff staring at the gallery of faces.
text: It's a creepy feeling. Several yards away, DEPUTY LEN
text: CARVER, a young puffy-faced lawman, sits at a desk
text: filling out a form. Jeff looks shaken.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY CARVER
dialog: Is this a recent picture?
text: Jeff glances over. Deputy Carver is holding up a wallet-
text: sized photograph of Amy.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: Two months old.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY CARVER
dialog: She still wear her hair like that?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The Deputy resumes filling out the form. He clicks his
text: tongue sympathetically.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY CARVER
dialog: We'll certainly do our best, Mr.
dialog: Taylor. There's over a hundred
dialog: thousand people go missing in this
dialog: country every year. Runaways,
dialog: deadbeat dads, dropouts, folks
dialog: hiding from the I.R.S. -- all
text: vanishing without a trace.
text: Jeff stares at the faces.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY CARVER
dialog: Now I'm not saying she's one of
dialog: them. I sure hope not. But
dialog: unless there's a ransom demand or
dialog: evidence of forced abduction,
dialog: believe me, the F.B.I. won't even
dialog: look at your case till it's been
dialog: 24 hours.
text: Deputy Carver finishes the paperwork and staples the
text: photograph to the form. He looks up at Jeff.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY CARVER
dialog: Nevertheless, we'll sure keep our
dialog: eyes peeled. How's that sound?
text: Jeff clenches his jaw.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF OF BELLE'S DINER - DAY
text: From this high vantage point, we see Jeff's car

scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
text: The Cherokee pulls up to the side of the building. Jeff
text: gets out and walks inside.
scene_heading: INT. BELLE'S DINER - DAY
text: Jeff enters, looks around. It's the same scene as
text: before: same Bartender, a slightly different cast of
dialog: characters.
text: No sign of Amy.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Jeff advances to the Bartender, who stands at a sink
text: rinsing beer mugs.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Did she come in?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
text: (looks up, uninterested)
text: Didn't see her.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You didn't see her, or she didn't
dialog: come in?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Buddy, I told you the last time.
dialog: I'm busy. Maybe she came in,
dialog: maybe she didn't. All I know is,
dialog: I didn't see her.
text: Jeff looks around, not particularly trusting the
text: Bartender's skills of observation. He grinds his jaw.
text: The other customers at the bar have been watching all
text: this. One of them, an older grizzled BARFLY, looks up at
dialog: Jeff.
speaker_heading: BARFLY
dialog: (confidentially)
dialog: None of my business, mister. But
dialog: if I was you I'd take a look in
text: the ladies room.
text: The Barfly gives Jeff a wink and turns back to his beer.
text: Snickers from some of his bar mates, who avert their eyes
text: when Jeff glances at them. Jeff knows this is almost
text: certainly a put-on, but he can't take a chance.
text: While the Barflies watch, poker-faced, Jeff walks to the
text: door of the ladies room, hesitates, then knocks. His
text: knock is answered by a wordless sound, HALF-GROAN, HALF-
speaker_heading: GASP.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Amy?
text: Silence. Jeff tries the door. It's locked. He rattles
text: it. Another GROAN. Jeff puts his shoulder against the
text: door, heaves inward. The door swings open, revealing --
dialog: 42.
scene_heading: INSIDE BATHROOM
text: Flo, bent over the toilet, vomiting. She whirls around,
text: a strand of spittle dangling from her lip.
speaker_heading: FLO
dialog: Hey -- what the hell you doing?!
text: Jeff backs away, yanks the door shut. The barflies
text: chuckle among themselves.
text: Jeff strides angrily for the exit. He stops at the door,
text: takes one last look around. No one seems to be paying
text: him much attention. He turns to leave...
text: ... but something stops him. He can't put his finger on
dialog: it. There's something wrong here...
text: He stares at the other customers. Why do they avoid eye
dialog: contact? Are they hiding something?
text: He scrutinizes more closely...
text: There is the gruff trucker, sitting at a nearby table
text: shoveling food in his mouth. He's been averting his gaze
dialog: ever since Jeff walked in.
text: And then there's the traveling salesman. Overweight,
text: sweaty. Popping vitamins along with his coffee.
text: Or what about the shirtless biker, reading a comic book
text: at the bar? Probably an ex-con.
text: While Jeff is running these suspicions through his mind,
text: a trucker approaches the counter to place an order. The
text: Bartender jots it down on a pad, then tears off the
text: carbon slip. He places one copy above the grill and
text: another in a pile by the cash register.
text: Jeff stares, an idea forming...
text: He approaches the bar.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I want to see your order slips.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You write down the names. I want
dialog: to see them.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: What are you, nuts? I don't have
dialog: to show you jack shit.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Jeff leans in his face.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: If my wife came in here, then her
dialog: name's in that pile.
text: The Bartender stiffens, stares him straight in the eye:
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: You calling me a liar?
text: A tense beat.
text: Possessed by a sudden impulse, Jeff makes a grab for the
text: receipts. Before he can reach them, the Bartender's hand
text: clamps onto his.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Mister, I've had just about enough
dialog: of you.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Let me see the fucking slips.
text: In one swift motion, Jeff overpowers the man and extracts
text: the receipts. He starts going through them, fast,
text: looking at names. TULLY, MARK, FLO, ANDY and...
text: Jeff raises his eyes to face the unpleasant end of a
dialog: Smith &amp; Wesson revolver.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Now, mister, you're going to have
dialog: to leave.
text: Jeff takes a step back. Everyone in the diner is
text: staring. He stumbles backwards, heads for the exit.
scene_heading: EXT. BELLE'S DINER - DAY
text: Jeff exits, breathing hard, and runs to the phone booth.
speaker_heading: PHONE BOOTH
text: is occupied by a YOUNG MAN with an awkward oversized
text: frame, ill-fitting clothes. Jeff raps on the glass
dialog: anxiously.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Please, I need the phone -- I have
dialog: to call the police!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The Man looks up, dull and glassy-eyed. His sluggish

speaker_heading: SLUGGISH MAN
dialog: (drawls)
dialog: My name's Billy. You the feller
dialog: lookin' for his wife?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: How'd you know? Did you see her?
text: The Sluggish Man hesitates. There's something holding
text: him back. Jeff senses this.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Please, if you know something,
dialog: anything, tell me.
speaker_heading: BILLY (SLUGGISH MAN)
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I seen her... maybe.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What? When?
text: Billy is about to answer. In b.g., the Bartender sticks
text: his head out of the diner. Billy backs away, spooked.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Oh man. Never shoulda opened my
dialog: damn mouth. Now I'm gonna git it.
text: Billy breaks into a loping run through the parking lot.
text: Jeff hurries after him and catches up, cornering Billy
text: between two cars, trying to calm him.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: No one's going to hurt you, Billy.
dialog: Just tell me what you saw.
text: Billy glances around nervously, swallowing.
speaker_heading: BILLY
text: She came in on a truck. A big
dialog: white one.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Then she... she got in another

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Another truck? With who?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Dunno. Some men. Bad men. They

text: Jeff reels, struggles to stay focused.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Do you know where they went?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Uh-huh. Route seven. Up by the
dialog: river.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Where by the river?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Dunno. They don't tell me that
dialog: kind of stuff.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Who doesn't? The bartender? The
dialog: men in the truck?
text: Billy's expression darkens. He starts backing away.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I ain't talking to you no more.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Billy, I need you to come to the
dialog: police. If you tell them what you
dialog: saw, they'll be able to help me.
text: Billy laughs.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Man, you're the dummy.
text: Jeff looks at him, confused.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Don't you git it? The police is
dialog: the ones in on it!

scene_heading: INT. CHEROKEE - DAY
text: Jeff drives flat-out, his face grim. The speedometer
text: reads 100 mph.
text: Keeping his eye on the road, he thumbs through the pages
text: of a pocket address book. He picks up the handheld
text: cellular phone and dials.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: C'mon... work, goddammit...
text: The "NO SERVICE" INDICATOR BEEPS.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Fuck.
scene_heading: EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY
text: The highway intersects Route 7. The Cherokee slows just

text: It flies past a sign: "Route 7 - North."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROUTE 7 - DAY
text: The road ascends into the rocky hills above the desert
text: plain. The route is narrow and windy, forcing Jeff to
dialog: reduce his speed.
scene_heading: INT. CHEROKEE - DAY
text: Jeff drives, desperately searching for any sign of a
text: truck. There are no other vehicles on the road.
text: He keeps pressing the "REDIAL" button. The "NO SERVICE"
text: INDICATOR BEEPS over and over.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY
text: The road curves through a tunnel, then climbs higher,
text: past sharp cliffs and drop-offs. Jeff follows the signs
dialog: for "Route 7."
scene_heading: INT. CHEROKEE - DAY
text: Something catches Jeff's eye on the cell phone. For the
text: first time, the "SERVICE" indicator blinks green. Jeff
text: immediately grabs the phone again and presses "REDIAL."
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: There is a burst of STATIC, then we hear a SCRATCHY

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Hello, Steve? It's Jeff Taylor...
dialog: Listen, I -- don't put me on hold!
dialog: I need a favor... I've gotta talk
dialog: to that friend of yours at the
dialog: F.B.I... No, it's about Amy, she's

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Fuck!
text: Jeff holds the phone tight to his ear.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Yes, I'm still here. No -- don't
dialog: call back -- Steve?! Steve?!
text: The SIGNAL CUTS OFF. Jeff slams the phone against the

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Goddammit!
text: He punches redial, gets the "NO SERVICE" BEEPING, then
text: glances up, sees a --
scene_heading: CHAINLINK FENCE
text: covered with high-visibility markers stretched across the
text: road. The sign: "ROAD CLOSED."
speaker_heading: BACK TO JEFF

text: short of the fence. Jeff stares at it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Shit!
text: He grinds his teeth. Beyond the padlocked gate, the
text: highway continues as an unpaved dirt road.
text: He deliberates, then throws the Cherokee in reverse and
text: does a three-point turn so he's facing back in the
text: opposite direction.
text: He looks up, sees --
scene_heading: DODGE RAM PICKUP TRUCK
text: has been hiding in the bushes off the road. It lurches
text: forward and stops in the middle of the road, blocking
text: Jeff's escape. Jeff's eyes widen in fear as he
text: recognizes the vehicle and its driver: Earl.
text: Earl gets out of the cab with a hunting rifle. He raises
text: it to his shoulder.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Out of the car! Put your hands
dialog: where I can see 'em!
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: swears, panicking.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: I said get out, dammit! Now!
text: Jeff stares into the rifle, deliberating. His hand moves
text: to the gearshift.
text: He jerks it into reverse and floors the gas!
speaker_heading: CHEROKEE
text: peels out in reverse, snaking wildly side to side, aiming
dialog: for the chainlink fence.
text: It BURSTS the FENCE! Poles and chain mesh go flying!
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: cranks the wheel and brakes hard. The rear end of the
text: Cherokee swings wide to the edge of the road.
text: He throws the shift into drive and punches the throttle.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: EARL
text: jumps in the Ram and takes off in pursuit.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: GUNS the ENGINE. The Cherokee bounces wildly on the
text: rutted, storm-damaged road. He yanks the four-wheel-
dialog: drive lever.
speaker_heading: DIRT ROAD
text: The huge pickup streaks after the Cherokee, its 7.5-LITER
text: V10 ROARING, oversized tires devouring the terrain.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: GUNS the ENGINE on the washboard road surface, the
text: vibration nearly shaking the suspension apart while --
speaker_heading: RAM
text: keeps pace in the dust from its wake. Inside the cab,
text: Earl can be seen speaking on a CB transmitter.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: throws the Cherokee into a sharp turn in the road. As
text: the car rounds the bend, he looks up, reacting, as --
scene_heading: IDLED BULLDOZER
text: blocks the road at a construction site. More unattended
text: earthmoving equipment fills the road beyond.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: brakes wildly. To his right, a cliff goes straight up;
text: on the left, a guardrail protects a steep ravine.
text: He cuts the wheel left, CRASHES through the GUARDRAIL and
text: plunges into the ravine!
speaker_heading: CHEROKEE
text: bounces wildly as it hurtles down the slope, CRASHING
text: through sagebrush and manzanita.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: clings to the wheel, tossed about violently, as suitcases
text: and packing boxes go everywhere.
text: The Cherokee hits a bump on the steep slope and CRASHES
text: through the upper branches of a willow grove.
text: As the leaves part, we see... a river.
speaker_heading: CHEROKEE
text: lands on the passenger side with a SPLASH and comes to
text: rest half-submerged in the RUSHING WATER.
speaker_heading: EARL
text: jerks the Ram to a halt, leaps out and runs to the edge
text: of the road to look down on the Cherokee in the river.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Sonofabitch...
text: He grabs the rifle and begins making his way down the
dialog: slope.
scene_heading: INSIDE CHEROKEE
text: The world is sideways. Water rushes into the car. Jeff
text: is strapped into the driver's seat by the seatbelt. The
text: AIRBAG DEFLATES with a HISS.
text: Jeff grimaces in pain. He looks around, blinking. The
dialog: river is flowing right through the Cherokee!
text: Luggage, styrofoam hamburger clamshells and empty Coke
text: cans bob on the surface of the water.
text: Jeff fumbles with the seatbelt release. The belt comes
text: free and he drops suddenly into the water on the
text: passenger side.
text: He gets to his feet, reaches overhead to unlatch the
text: driver's side door and pushes it open.
text: He hoists himself through the door.
speaker_heading: RIVERBANK
text: Earl sees Jeff emerging from the half-submerged Cherokee,
dialog: levels the RIFLE and FIRES!
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: ducks back inside the Cherokee, freaking.
text: The passenger side is on the river-bottom and if he tries
text: to get out through the driver's side, he's a sitting
dialog: duck!
text: Jeff swears and looks around, seeing a metal camera case
text: underwater in the back seat.
text: He grabs the case and swings it at the windshield. The
text: first three blows bounce off harmlessly.
text: Then the WINDSHIELD SHATTERS with a CRASH!
text: He takes a deep breath, submerges and swims underwater
text: through the broken windshield.
speaker_heading: ON BANK
text: Earl stiffens as he sees movement in the water. Several
text: items of debris from the car are floating on the current.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Fuck!
text: He begins moving downstream along the bank, eyeing the
dialog: river.
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
text: Jeff breaststrokes for all he's worth. Sand swirls in
text: the swift current. He pushes away from a boulder in his
dialog: path.
text: He swims until his lungs are bursting, then surfaces for
dialog: air.
speaker_heading: ON BANK
text: Earl sees Jeff break the surface. He aims the RIFLE and
text: FIRES! A BULLET SMACKS the WATER near Jeff's head.
text: Then Jeff is under again.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Goddammit...
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
text: Jeff struggles to stay in control. The current is
text: turning swifter. His shoulder glances painfully off a
dialog: boulder.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: ON BANK
text: Earl works his way through the brush at the river's edge.
text: His foot lands between two rocks. He pulls it out,
text: swearing.
speaker_heading: BEHIND ROCK
text: Jeff surfaces and gulps in air, staying out of sight of
text: Earl on the bank. Then he is down again.
speaker_heading: ON BANK
text: Earl works his way along the shore. Up ahead, the river
text: runs over rapids before passing around a bend.
text: Earl hears an ENGINE and turns. A huge moving van has
text: arrived on the dirt road overlooking the ravine.
text: He shouts to the DRIVER, pointing downriver.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: He's getting away!
text: The Driver shouts something inaudible. Earl runs along
text: the bank, ducking under low-hanging branches.
speaker_heading: IN RAPIDS
text: Jeff is carried over the rocks by the fast-moving
text: current. He slams into a boulder, letting out a cry and
text: swallowing a mouthful of water.
text: A downed tree hangs over the river. Jeff grabs
text: desperately and takes hold of a branch. He's got it!
text: Hanging on to the branch, he notices a familiar object
text: floating past in the water: the "90,000 Donuts" pack.
text: Jeff tries to haul himself from the river. The BRANCH
text: bends under his weight. Then it comes free with a CRACK!
text: Jeff is carried downstream on the rushing water.
speaker_heading: ON BANK
text: Earl works his way along the shore. The unseen Driver of
text: the van shouts to him from upriver.
speaker_heading: DRIVER OF VAN (O.S.)
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: He's in the water! I just saw
dialog: him!
speaker_heading: BELOW RAPIDS
text: The river has turned slow again.
text: Jeff fights to his feet in the shallows and staggers to
text: the bank. He drops to his knees, retching.
text: Clutching his ribs, he raises his head and looks upriver.
text: For the moment, there is no sign of Earl. But he could
dialog: appear anytime.
text: Jeff gets to his feet, wincing. He looks up at the rocky
text: canyon wall bordering the river. It's steep but
dialog: scalable.
text: He begins climbing.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROCK OUTCROPPING - MINUTES LATER
text: Jeff has climbed to higher ground. He lies flat on his
text: belly and peers THROUGH a gap in the rocks at the river
text: valley below.
speaker_heading: JEFF'S POV - RIVER
text: The men have given up their pursuit.
text: The moving van, a jumbo three-axle GMC, has turned around
text: and backed up to the edge of the ravine.
text: A stocky man, AL (whom we recognize as Earl's passenger
text: at the minimart), operates a gas-powered winch in the
text: cargo door of the van.
text: A cable runs from the winch down to the Cherokee in the
dialog: river.
text: Standing knee-deep in the current, Earl signals to Al
text: while the winch slowly tugs the Cherokee onto its wheels,
text: then backwards out of the river.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: BACK TO JEFF
text: watching in amazement. He can hear only snatches of
dialog: their conversation.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: ... can't believe you let him get
dialog: away...
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: You try chasing... through this
dialog: shit...
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: Fuck... this is what happens when
dialog: you get one without the other...
text: Jeff can't believe it. The Cherokee is being pulled
text: backwards up the slope toward the road.
text: He belly-crawls back from the outcropping, gets to his
text: feet and climbs higher.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER PART OF CLIFF - LATER
text: Jeff has moved to higher ground. He crouches behind a
text: stand of manzanita and looks down at the activity below.
speaker_heading: JEFF'S POV - ROAD
text: The Cherokee is now back on the road.
text: Operating the winch with precision efficiency, Earl and
text: Al drag the Cherokee up a ramp into the rear of the
text: moving van.
text: Once the vehicle is aboard, they stow the ramp and close
text: the van doors.
speaker_heading: BACK TO JEFF
text: watching in amazement, straining to hear what Earl and Al
text: are saying. Behind Jeff, a PEBBLE SKITTERS on the rock.
text: He turns, reacts.
text: It's Billy -- the halfwit from the diner! Wielding a
text: shotgun like a club, he swings the butt at Jeff's skull!
text: Jeff drops to the ground, unconscious.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. CAR TRUNK - DAY
text: There is a CREAK as the TRUNK opens. Jeff lies inside,
text: dazed and disoriented, blinking into the sun. His eyes
text: won't focus. Earl and Billy stand over the trunk in
text: silhouette. He can hear their voices:
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: He coming around?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Should be... I clocked him pretty
dialog: good...
text: A gun barrel jabs Jeff in the ribs.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Rise and shine, dad.
text: Jeff blinks. A face slowly comes INTO FOCUS. Is it
dialog: really Billy? The halfwit from the diner? Only he isn't
dialog: a halfwit anymore.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: C'mon, shake a leg.
text: Jeff looks at Billy. Nothing makes sense anymore. But
dialog: one thing is clear: Billy's mental retardation was all
dialog: an act.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (weak)
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Give us some answers and you might
dialog: find out. According to her,
dialog: you've got a pretty good pile of

dialog: Is that true?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: There's some... yeah...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Uh-huh... well, 'some' doesn't cut

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JEFF

dialog: (turning)
dialog: What do you think, Earl?
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: We been fucked with, is what I

speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (emphatic)
dialog: Ninety thousand dollars.
text: A faint smile plays on Billy's lips. He slams the trunk.
scene_heading: INT. CAR TRUNK - DAY

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The car shifts into gear and sets off across the desert.
text: Jeff grunts as the car bounces on the uneven terrain.
text: He braces against the confines of the trunk. The ENGINE
text: NOISE is deafening. The car hits a depression and
text: jounces wildly. Jeff is thrown about violently.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MESA OVERLOOK - DAY
text: There is a CREAK and the TRUNK opens. Jeff squints into
text: the sun. Earl and Billy stand over the trunk.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Get out. Don't try anything
dialog: stupid.
text: Jeff gets out, grimacing. His clothes are stained with
text: grease and tire grime. He sets his feet unsteadily on
text: the ground, looks around. We see that he has been
text: confined in the trunk of a Pontiac Firebird.
text: The Firebird and Dodge Ram are parked on a bluff. Red
text: stands on the highest point, peering through binoculars
text: at the desert below. He glances at Jeff.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: You're a tough man to get a hold
dialog: of, Jeffrey.
text: Jeff stares, a mix of emotions -- anger, fear, confusion.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (barely able to
dialog: control himself)
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: It's not me we're talking about.
dialog: Question is what you want.
text: Jeff looks at him with loathing.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: See, I've got something you might
dialog: want to buy. Can't show you the
dialog: merchandise right now, but I can
dialog: describe it for you. About five-
text: five, hundred and fifteen pounds.
dialog: I'd say three, maybe four of that

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: JEFF

text: into his kidney. Jeff gasps in pain.
text: Red nods impassively.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Bring him up here.
text: Earl and Billy hoist Jeff to his feet and propel him up
text: the mound closer to Red.
text: From here, Jeff can see a small desert town spread out
text: below, as well as the highway leading through it. Red
dialog: gestures.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Welcome to Brackett, Jeff. If
dialog: ever there was a two-bit shithole
dialog: in the middle of nowhere, this is
text: it. One gas station, a half-dozen
text: stores and a V.F.W. hall.
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: See that building?
text: Jeff follows his gaze.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: That's the bank. Brackett
dialog: Commerce Bank. You with me?
text: Jeff nods tightly.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Then here's the drill. You're
dialog: gonna walk in there and tell the
dialog: manager you want an express wire
dialog: in the amount of $90,000 from your
dialog: account in Boston. Got your
dialog: wallet?
text: Jeff nods.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: You ask for the money in cash.
dialog: Small bills.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: RED (CONT'D)
dialog: Today's payday at the copper mine,
dialog: so don't take any horsecock about
dialog: how they haven't got it. If the
dialog: manager gives you a hard time,
dialog: that's your problem. It's your
dialog: wife who's counting on you.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: How do I know she's still alive?
text: Billy slugs him in the gut again. Jeff doubles over.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: RED
text: She's tucked away someplace safe.
dialog: You get her back as soon as we get
dialog: the money. Simple as that.
text: Jeff compresses his lips.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Now a smart guy like you, you're
dialog: already thinking about calling the
dialog: cops, right?
text: Jeff says nothing. Red raises a hand-held CB to his

speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Like I said, Jeff, if you want to

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Problem is, you can see this town
dialog: for miles around. So ask
dialog: yourself: How's the law gonna get
dialog: here? They gonna fly in? Drive
dialog: in? Either way, we'll see 'em.
dialog: So let me be very clear: if we see
dialog: one unmarked car, one plane, one
dialog: human being who even smells like a
dialog: cop -- this deal is dead.
text: He tosses Jeff the binoculars.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Now take a look at the building

text: Jeff hesitates, then raises the binoculars.
scene_heading: THROUGH BINOCULARS
text: The IMAGE SHIFTS, then STEADIES and FOCUSES ON a small
text: building with a police cruiser out front and a barely
text: legible sign: "BRACKETT SHERIFF." It's the police
dialog: station where Jeff filed the missing persons' form
dialog: earlier.
speaker_heading: RED (O.S.)
dialog: There's exactly two cops in this
text: town. One of them's inside
dialog: pulling ass duty; the other's on
dialog: patrol in the foothills. Now a
dialog: minute ago one of my men called in
dialog: a non-injury accident on the I-40
dialog: connector.
text: Deputy Carver comes out of the building gulping down a
text: sandwich. He gets in the cruiser and pulls away, lights
text: flashing.
speaker_heading: RED (O.S.)
dialog: It'll take that good ol' boy 20
dialog: minutes to get to the connector,
dialog: another 10 to see there's no
dialog: accident, and another 20 or so to
dialog: tool his way back. 50 minutes all
dialog: in.
text: The cruiser pulls away down the highway.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: lowers the binoculars and looks at Red.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: That's your deadline. If for any
dialog: reason one of those cops pulls
dialog: into town before I'm looking at a
dialog: bag of money, your wife is dead,
dialog: you're shit out of luck and we're
dialog: gone for good.
text: He smiles at Jeff.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: See, that's why there's no risk to
dialog: us in this thing. You do the
text: legwork. We sit back, we watch,
dialog: we listen to our scanners, we
dialog: monitor you every step of the way.
dialog: If at any moment we don't like
dialog: something, we split. Period.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Helluva lot safer than sticking up
dialog: 7-11s, wouldn't you say?
text: They lock eyes. Red tosses Jeff a Windbreaker.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Put this on. You can't go into
dialog: the bank like that.
text: Jeff puts on the jacket. It covers his filthy shirt.
text: Red checks his watch.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: How about it, Jeff? Time to get

text: ON Jeff's expression...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BOTTOM OF MESA - DAY
text: Jeff stumbles and nearly falls as he descends the loose

text: jogging, then running.
dialog: 62.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY

text: Jeff eyes it warily. Is it one of theirs? The truck
text: pulls around a corner.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - DAY
text: Jeff pushes through the main doors. It's a typical small
text: town operation. A guard stands near the entrance.
text: Several customers wait in line for the woman teller.
text: Jeff looks at the slow-moving line and swears softly. He
text: doesn't have time to wait. He glances around, sees an

text: nameplate on the desk identifying him as Roger Calhoun.
text: Jeff approaches.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I need to see the manager. I need

speaker_heading: CALHOUN

speaker_heading: CALHOUN
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (turning; preoccupied)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CALHOUN
dialog: I said you can have a seat if you

speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: CALHOUN
dialog: Are you all right?
speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: CALHOUN
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: JEFF

dialog: My credit card. I've got a $6,000
dialog: limit. Can you advance me the
dialog: whole $6,000?
text: Calhoun looks mystified.
speaker_heading: CALHOUN
dialog: No, I can't. For non-customers

dialog: you sure you're all right?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Yes, I'm fine. Just... transfer
dialog: the money, okay?
text: Calhoun raises an eyebrow and begins filling out the
text: transfer form. Jeff eyes him, decides he has to risk it.
text: He leans toward the desk.
speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: CALHOUN

speaker_heading: COWBOY

dialog: about a car loan.
speaker_heading: CALHOUN
dialog: (indicating

text: looking for anything that could be used as a weapon. He
text: tosses aside detergents and air fresheners.
text: He picks up the toilet plunger, pulls the wooden rod from
text: the rubber base. He swings it into his palm a few times,
text: testing it as a club. It's too bulky. He won't be able
dialog: to conceal it.
text: He checks his watch. Time is running out. He takes one
text: last look around the bathroom, then exits.
dialog: 65.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - DAY
text: Jeff comes out of the rest room. The manager is behind
text: the teller's counter. The cowboy is gone. In his place
text: sits a middle-aged blue collar worker. He looks at Jeff.
text: Jeff takes a seat, glances at Calhoun's empty desk.
text: There is a letter opener on the desk, several paper bands
dialog: for wrapping currency.
text: Positioning his body so no one can see, Jeff takes the
text: letter opener and slips it into his sleeve. He scoops up
text: a handful of currency wrappers.
text: Jeff goes to the teller's window, scribbles something on

dialog: either.
text: He stands there. What's he supposed to do now? He

speaker_heading: RINGS.

speaker_heading: EARL

speaker_heading: EARL

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I know where she is! My wife!
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: (ignoring him)

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You don't understand! She's been

speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: I understand plenty. Now get down

scene_heading: INT. PICKUP - DAY
text: Earl struggles for breath. The duct tape is still tight
text: around his neck. He strains against the tape binding his
text: limbs.
text: He glances in the side view mirror to see the Sheriff
text: ordering Jeff down on the ground.
text: By wriggling and contorting his wrists, Earl is able to
text: tear one hand free. Then he pulls away the rest of the
text: duct tape from his knees.
text: The tape is still wrapped tightly around his neck,
text: pinning him to the backrest. Earl claws at the tape, but
text: it won't come free. Finally, with both hands, he reaches
text: behind his head and yanks the read rest from the seat.
text: He reaches into his boot for something...
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: Jeff is spread-eagled on the ground. Sheriff Boyd calls
text: out to Earl in the cab. He keeps his gun leveled.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: You there -- in the pickup! You
dialog: all right? Can you get out?
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Yeah! Just don't shoot me,
dialog: officer! He's crazy, I tell you!
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD

speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD
dialog: (glances down
dialog: at Jeff)
dialog: Shut up.
dialog: (to Earl)
dialog: C'mon out, sir. It's safe --
text: Earl sets one foot on the road. The headrest dangles
text: against his back, still taped to his neck. Suddenly Earl
text: whirls, holding a .22 snub-nose REVOLVER and FIRES!
text: The sheriff stumbles away, blood spurting from his
text: shoulder, the gun flying from his hand.
text: Jeff looks up in horror as the sheriff falls.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Earl comes around the pickup after Jeff, raising the gun
text: to fire. Jeff scrambles to his feet and dives down the

text: Earl runs to the edge of the embankment. Down below,
text: Jeff is reaching for the automatic pistol the sheriff
dialog: ordered him to drop.
dialog: He finds it... too late...
text: Earl is aiming at point-blank range from the top of the
text: embankment. He is already squeezing the trigger when...
text: BLAM! Earl's chest erupts outward as a bullet passes
text: through his body from behind!
text: Earl staggers and flops down the embankment. He comes to
text: rest near Jeff, blood gurgling from a massive chest
dialog: wound.
text: Jeff climbs the embankment. The sheriff is lying on the
text: road, critically injured, gun lying nearby and still

speaker_heading: SHERIFF BOYD

dialog: Suspect...
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER (V.O.)
dialog: Help is on the way, Sheriff. Just
dialog: hang on. I have units and an

text: Jeff bends over the Sheriff and examines his wound with a
text: grimace. He is verging on unconsciousness. Jeff
text: deliberates, torn. There is nothing he can do here.
text: Making up his mind, Jeff runs to the pickup. The hand-
text: held cellular phone has spilled into the road. He scoops
text: it up, jumps behind the wheel and LAYS RUBBER.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BLUFF - DAY
text: Jeff stands on a ridge overlooking a Texaco truck stop.
text: Behind him, the Dodge Ram pickup lies hidden in a growth
text: of scrub oak and tumbleweeds.
text: Jeff looks overwhelmed by what he sees spread out below.
dialog: 77.
scene_heading: JEFF'S POV - TEXACO TRUCK STOP
text: It's a giant truck stop. There are hundreds of big rigs
text: parked in rows like silvery sardines.
text: A sign towers over the main building: "DIESEL $.99 GAL."
speaker_heading: BACK TO JEFF
text: He looks shaken. How will he ever find Red here? It
dialog: seems impossible.
text: He descends the bluff to the truck stop.
scene_heading: EXT. TRUCK STOP - DAY
text: Jeff skids on his heels down the loose hillside and
text: reaches the edge of the parking lot. There are trucks
text: everywhere. Diesel MOTORS RUMBLE. Exhaust fills the
dialog: air.
text: He reaches the end of a row of big rigs, starts searching
text: the grounds for the markings of Red's 18-wheeler.
text: It's nowhere in sight.
text: A high-pitched FEMININE SQUEAL from an adjacent truck's
text: sleeping compartment startles Jeff.
speaker_heading: TRUCKER (O.S.)
dialog: (muffled)
dialog: C'mon, baby, give it up!
text: The woman GIGGLES, O.S. Jeff ignores it, scanning the
text: truck stop. He stiffens.
text: A police car is arriving at the truck stop.
text: Staying out of sight, Jeff passes quickly to the rear of
text: a tractor trailer.
scene_heading: EXT. TRUCK WASH - DAY
text: Jeff peers out from behind a parked mini-van as trucks
text: emerge wet and dripping from an immense truck wash.
text: Across the way, trucks are filling up on diesel at the
text: gas islands. Jeff's eyes narrow. Is that Red's
dialog: Peterbilt among them?
text: He quickens his pace, then falls back, slumping. The
text: rig's black driver is getting in the cab. Jeff glances
text: to the side, frowns.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: An older vacationing couple is eyeing Jeff warily.
text: Jeff looks down, cops to it instantly. His clothes are
text: ripped, caked with blood. He ducks between two parked
text: cars, using a side-view mirror as he hastily wipes blood
text: off his face. He checks to be sure no one is watching.
text: Something catches his eye.
scene_heading: EXT. BLUFF - JEFF'S POV
text: A highway patrol car with flashing lights is parked near
text: the place where Jeff ditched the pickup. Beside it, a
text: state trooper surveys the truck stop with binoculars.
scene_heading: EXT. TRUCK WASH - DAY
text: Jeff's jaw tightens. He glances toward the road, sees
text: two more highway patrol cars cruising the perimeter of
text: the truck stop.
text: Swearing, Jeff turns on his heels and walks away in the
text: opposite direction, shielding his face.
scene_heading: EXT. TRUCK STOP PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Jeff emerges from between two vehicles, glancing over his
text: shoulder nervously. He keeps his head down, moving fast.
text: He scans the truck stop in all directions. The patrol
text: car is still parked on the ridge, the patrolman peering
text: through binoculars.
text: Jeff quickens his pace alongside the truck stop building,
text: passing a row of pay phones. He looks up, stops dead.
text: Red is talking on a pay phone six feet away.
text: Jeff stares. Red is facing away, unaware of his
text: presence. Jeff darts into an adjacent pay phone.
text: He shields his face with the receiver and listens.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: I don't know, dammit, he was

speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Look, I'm getting out of here.
dialog: Stay off the airwaves. Bring the
dialog: girl and meet me at the barn...
dialog: You got that?
text: He hangs up. Jeff presses the phone against his face and
text: turns away.
text: When he looks up, Red is walking toward his Peterbilt
text: truck, parked in a row of big rigs. Jeff starts to
text: follow, then freezes.
text: Several cops are fanning out on foot, questioning
text: everyone they encounter.
text: Jeff sees Red getting into his truck. The ENGINE KICKS
text: OVER. The BRAKES HISS and the truck begins pulling out.
text: Jeff whips around. The older vacationing couple are
text: talking to a cop fifty yards away. The husband points
text: toward the pay phones.
text: Jeff makes a sudden decision, doubles back behind a
text: rolling farm truck.
speaker_heading: COP
text: thanks the couple, calls out something to his fellow
dialog: officers.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: runs alongside the farm truck, using it as a shield. He
text: overtakes the truck, cuts across its path. The farmer
text: BLARES his HORN.
text: Jeff glances left. Red's tractor trailer is traveling
text: across the crowded parking area, slowly gaining speed.
text: Jeff sprints in front of a moving car.
text: The driver jerks to a halt and HONKS, catching the
text: attention of a nearby cop. Jeff quickly turns away,
dialog: avoiding being seen.
text: Red's 18-wheeler turns toward the access road. Jeff
text: looks around, panicked. More cops are spreading out on
dialog: foot. They'll notice him any second.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Jeff crouches low and scurries underneath a slow-moving

text: under the rear wheel assembly.
text: Jeff rolls out of the path of the giant wheels, gets to
text: his feet on the other side and finds himself...
dialog: ... in the path of another huge truck!
text: A cop is standing only 20 feet away! Jeff goes
text: underneath another trailer, crawling between the moving
text: wheels. He springs to his feet.
text: Red's Peterbilt is pulling away!
text: Jeff runs for all he's worth. His arms and legs pump
text: furiously. He runs abreast of the truck...
dialog: ... and seizes the spare tire mount!
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSTATE - UNDER TRUCK - DAY
text: Jeff hangs on for dear life. His legs drag over the
text: asphalt. He lets out a cry of pain.
text: The truck is joining the highway, accelerating.
text: Grimacing, Jeff swings his legs over the universal joint
text: as the roadway races past below. The huge TIRES are a
text: HOWLING blur.
text: Suddenly his grip falters on the grease. His back
text: scrapes the rushing asphalt. Jeff gasps, makes a grab
text: and holds firm.
text: As he hangs on, a station wagon overtakes the Peterbilt
text: in the passing lane. A three-year-old boy sits in the
text: rear compartment, staring out at Jeff, a puzzled
text: expression on his face.
text: Jeff stares back. It's an odd moment between the two.
text: The station wagon continues forward and EXITS FRAME.
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY
text: The PETERBILT THUNDERS over a patch of highway that is

dialog: 81.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDER TRUCK - DAY
text: The tires kick up a hail storm of loose gravel and dirt,
text: pelting Jeff all over his body.
text: He realizes he can't stay where he is. Grunting with
text: effort, he works his way hand over hand along the
text: underside rigging toward the cab.
text: He seizes the trailer hitch and hoists himself up.
scene_heading: EXT. BETWEEN CAB AND TRAILER - DAY
text: Standing on the coupler, Jeff clutches his ribs and
text: catches his breath. He's in pain. The road whips by
text: below his feet.
text: The truck hits an uneven stretch of road and bounces
text: violently. Jeff grabs the coiled brake line for support.
text: The truck is doing 70 mph, exhaust racketing.
text: Jeff pulls the cell phone from his pocket and dials 911.
text: He holds it tightly to his ear, shouting above the wind.
speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RED'S PETERBILT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Deke, c'mon over here, I got

speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: HALLWAY
text: toward the voices. VIDEO GAME sound effects emanate from

speaker_heading: DEKE (O.S.)
dialog: Stick 'em up.

text: from the hallway. The rifle looks enormous in his hands.
text: The boy's lip quivers.
text: The room is silent. No one moves. Jeff keeps the pistol
text: aimed at Red. He swallows, speaks slowly:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You don't want to do that, kid.

speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Hello? Hello? Anybody home?

scene_heading: INT. TRAILER - DAWN

speaker_heading: JEFF AND AMY

scene_heading: INT. RED'S PETERBILT - DAY

scene_heading: INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

speaker_heading: YARD

speaker_heading: FIREBIRD

speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: CADILLAC DEVILLE

speaker_heading: CRUNCH!
speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: HIGHWAY
text: The Ford is sandwiched between the Cadillac and Firebird

dialog: rear.
speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Jeff!
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It's glass! Use the rifle!
text: Amy raises the rifle, thrusts the barrel awkwardly out

speaker_heading: BILLY
text: grins as the SHOT WHISTLES past harmlessly. He reloads

speaker_heading: HIGHWAY
text: The BLAST hits the Ford's side-mounted toolbox. The door

dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: BILLY
text: veers away, swearing, as hammers and chisels and power
text: tools hit the asphalt and bounce up into his path.

speaker_heading: WINDSHIELD!
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Sonofabitch!
text: Billy swears and jerks the wheel, steering away. He

dialog: The PISTOL FIRES!

text: the shoulder.
speaker_heading: HIGHWAY
text: The Firebird hits a mound of earth, flies through the air
text: and lands with a CRASH!
scene_heading: IN PETERBILT
text: Red sees the crash, scowling. He presses the gas and

speaker_heading: IN FORD

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Look out!

scene_heading: ON PETERBILT
text: a STRAY BULLET SLICES the hydraulic brake line running to

scene_heading: IN PETERBILT

speaker_heading: RED

speaker_heading: IN FORD

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Hang on!

scene_heading: IN PETERBILT
text: Red struggles to stay in control. Every time he applies

text: Red has no choice. He has to pump the brakes and risk

dialog: altogether.
dialog: He hits the brakes!
speaker_heading: HIGHWAY
text: The huge TRUCK SCREECHES on the asphalt, tires smoking,

speaker_heading: IN CADILLAC
text: Flanking the Peterbilt, Al glances to the side and sees

text: Al SLAMS on the BRAKES, screaming!
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: HIGHWAY

speaker_heading: PETERBILT

dialog: sideways.
text: Up ahead, a concrete bridge spans a deep gorge.
speaker_heading: HIGHWAY
text: The Peterbilt and Ford fly onto the bridge. The big
text: truck glances off a railing. The vehicles suddenly come

text: The PETERBILT creams it from behind and caroms away,
text: SKIDDING the length of the bridge before SMACKING the
dialog: opposite railing!
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: INSIDE ROAD
text: Jeff grimaces. In front of them, the concrete railing

text: Jeff looks at Amy. She looks wildly adrenalated, eyes
dialog: wide.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You all right?
text: Amy looks back at him. She expels a long breath and

text: and looks over the Ford's roof at the Peterbilt.
scene_heading: JEFF'S POV - PETERBILT
text: It's facing them, 50 yards away on the bridge. The

speaker_heading: BACK TO JEFF

speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: AMY (O.S.)

scene_heading: JEFF'S POV - PETERBILT

speaker_heading: BACK TO JEFF

speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Push, goddammit!

text: Red's eyes burn as he presses the accelerator and forces
text: the pickup farther through the broken railing.
speaker_heading: FORD
text: lurches through the widening gap in the railing.
text: Concrete sails into the canyon. The front tires hang
text: over the void.
speaker_heading: IN FORD
text: Jeff strains against the dashboard. It won't give. He
text: whips around, swearing, and leaps from the Ford.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (panicked)
dialog: Jeff?
speaker_heading: ON BRIDGE
text: Jeff runs to the Peterbilt and jumps on the driver's side
text: running board, grasping the door handle.
text: Red heaves the door open suddenly. It strikes Jeff's
text: head with a crack! He falls backward to the ground.
scene_heading: IN PETERBILT
text: Red presses the gas, yelling over the ENGINE ROAR. The
text: railing is giving way. He sees Jeff struggling to his
dialog: feet.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: You think you can come into my
dialog: life and fuck with me? Nobody
dialog: fucks with me!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He looks down. Jeff is no longer visible. Red frowns.
text: Suddenly the passenger side door flies open and Jeff
text: surges into the cab, landing on Red, clawing at his eyes!
text: They grapple in the cab. Red swings an elbow into Jeff's
text: face -- crack. Jeff drives a fist to his jaw!
text: The steering wheel drifts counter-clockwise as the truck
text: inches forward, ramming the Ford closer to the precipice.
text: Red gets his hands around Jeff's neck as the steering
text: wheel continues to move counter-clockwise...
speaker_heading: ON BRIDGE
text: The truck is no longer hitting the Ford squarely.
text: Instead, the Peterbilt's right front tire is riding up
text: and over the cargo bed, crushing the left side of the
text: Ford under its massive weight.
scene_heading: IN PETERBILT
text: Red has both hands around Jeff's windpipe. He glances up
text: for a second, reacts, but it's too late.
speaker_heading: ON BRIDGE
text: The Peterbilt is surging up the driver's side of the
dialog: Ford, using the pickup like a ramp!
speaker_heading: IN FORD
text: Amy screams as the left side of the cab is flattened
dialog: under the Peterbilt's weight!
speaker_heading: ON BRIDGE
text: For an instant, the Peterbilt's front tires seem to hang
text: in the air... then the truck is falling!
scene_heading: IN PETERBILT
text: Red and Jeff are thrown forward in the cab, still
text: flailing at each other, as the truck plunges nose-first
text: into the gorge.
text: Then it jerks to a halt in mid-air!
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: ON BRIDGE
text: The left rear set of wheels on the trailer is snagged on
text: the thick rebar reinforcement in the crumbled concrete
dialog: railing.
text: The Peterbilt is dangling nose-down from the bridge!
scene_heading: IN PETERBILT
text: Jeff slams into the windshield. Red lands on top of him.
text: Loose objects from the cab rain against the windshield.
text: They grapple. Red grabs Jeff's arm and twists sharply,
text: forcing it at an impossible angle. Their faces are
dialog: inches apart.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: You think you can fuck with me?!
text: He headbutts Jeff viciously -- crack! Blood erupts from
text: Jeff's nose and mouth. Red is about to deliver another
dialog: blow when...
text: ... the windshield falls away! The loose items in the
text: cab plummet 300 feet to the canyon floor below.
text: Jeff drops through the windshield opening. He clings to
text: the center support column. His legs dangle over the
dialog: hood.
text: Red slips through the opening, his hand locking on the
text: steering wheel at the last instant.
text: The windshield sails away into the gorge.
speaker_heading: ON BRIDGE
text: The iron REBAR GROANS. It's beginning to give way under
text: the weight of the truck. The truck slips slightly.
scene_heading: ON PETERBILT
text: Jeff feels the truck shifting. He grabs the windshield
text: wiper blade with his free hand. The blade snaps away.
text: Red is clinging to the steering wheel. He flails at Jeff
text: with his feet, swearing. Jeff is barely out of reach.
text: Jeff looks to the side. There is a grabhandle on the
text: corner of the cab. He reaches with his free hand and
text: seizes the handle.
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: ON BRIDGE
text: The REBAR GROANS. The truck is wedged against the Ford.
text: As the truck slips, it forces the Ford closer to the
dialog: edge.
scene_heading: ON PETERBILT
text: Jeff clings to the handle. He reaches for the passenger
text: side door handle, working his way up toward the bridge.
speaker_heading: REBAR
dialog: gives away once more and --
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: scales the cab, finding more handholds. He climbs past
text: the passenger door.
text: Behind him, Red is working his way higher in the same
text: manner. He grabs Jeff's foot, trying to pull him off the
dialog: cab.
text: Jeff kicks free and climbs past the sleeping compartment.
text: Red grabs the door handle. Jeff boots the door release
dialog: button.
text: The passenger door flies open!
text: Red falls away as the door opens. He's clinging to the
text: open passenger door, suspended over the gorge.
speaker_heading: IN FORD
text: Amy breathes in sharply, feeling the Ford move closer to
text: the edge. She struggles to free her legs from the
text: dashboard.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh God... Jeff...
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: climbs higher. The Peterbilt slips again. Below, Red
text: loses his grip and almost falls.
text: Jeff hauls himself onto the bridge with a final gasp of
text: exertion. He runs to the passenger side of the Ford.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The Ford teeters precariously. Any move could send it
text: over the edge. Jeff can only extend his hand to Amy over
dialog: the void.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: C'mon, Amy, it's all you now...
dialog: you can do it...
text: With a huge effort, Amy frees herself from the dashboard
text: and reaches for Jeff's outstretched hand just as --
speaker_heading: PETERBILT
dialog: comes free from the rebar!
speaker_heading: AMY
text: takes hold of Jeff's hand.
speaker_heading: PETERBILT
text: plummets into the canyon!
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: screams!
speaker_heading: PETERBILT
text: seems to fall forever... before landing with a huge
speaker_heading: EXPLOSION!
speaker_heading: ON BRIDGE
text: Jeff and Amy fall backward on the road. Down below,
text: secondary EXPLOSIONS rock the canyon. Jeff takes Amy in
text: his arms.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Don't let me go, Jeff...
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I won't, baby... I won't ever let
dialog: you go...
text: He looks into her eyes. Their lips meet in a kiss and
dialog: we --
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 116.
scene_heading: EXT. RED'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Police cars and official vehicles are parked outside the
text: house. RADIOS CHATTER. Yellow crime tape holds back
text: onlookers and news reporters.
text: Cops and evidence technicians work the scene. A
text: criminalist photographs stolen property as it's carried
text: out of the barn.
text: A plainclothes FBI AGENT closes a cellphone and walks
text: over to where Jeff and Amy are sitting at a picnic table.
text: They are battered and bandaged.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: How's the sheriff?
speaker_heading: FBI AGENT
text: Out of surgery. It looks like
dialog: he's gonna make it. As for the
dialog: wife and kid, she's not talking,
text: he's being turned over to
dialog: Protective Services.
text: Jeff nods soberly.
speaker_heading: FBI AGENT
dialog: We've got I.D. on the dead
dialog: suspects. Turns out they were all
dialog: licensed truckers. One of 'em had
dialog: a rap for check kiting. Otherwise
dialog: they could've been model citizens.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What about the leader?
speaker_heading: FBI AGENT
dialog: Same thing. His real name's
dialog: Warren Claney. Three speeding
dialog: tickets in five years -- apart
dialog: from that, he's clean as a
dialog: whistle.
text: Amy watches as cops stack windshields outside the barn.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (dazed)
dialog: How could they do it? How could
dialog: they treat it like a... business?
speaker_heading: FBI AGENT
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: I don't know. I've been doing
dialog: this 15 years, I've never seen
dialog: anything like it.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: FBI AGENT (CONT'D)
dialog: It was simple, efficient and
dialog: organized. They stayed on the
dialog: move, spread it over a dozen
dialog: states. As long as no witnesses
dialog: survived, it's an untraceable
dialog: crime.
dialog: (looking at them)
dialog: You were just a couple of the
dialog: lucky ones.
text: Up ahead, a television news helicopter is landing on the
text: road. A cameraman, reporter and producer hurry over.
text: Jeff watches the news crew, a bemused expression. It
dialog: seems like a million years ago...
text: The FBI Agent shakes his head, disdainful.
speaker_heading: FBI
dialog: (re: media)
dialog: C'mon -- let's get you folks out
dialog: of here before things really get
dialog: hairy.
text: He escorts them to a waiting sedan. As they climb in,
text: Jeff looks back over his shoulder, surveying the scene
dialog: one last time.
text: He gets in and the car pulls away just as the frenzied
text: news crew arrives, mikes and cameras at the ready,
text: running alongside the departing sedan, shouting
dialog: questions.
text: Through the rear window, we see Jeff putting his arm
text: around Amy, pulling her close as we hear:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Promise me one thing...
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Name it.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Next time... we fly.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - AERIAL - DAY
text: Over this last line, the sedan drives away, and we CLIMB
text: HIGHER and HIGHER AWAY FROM the bristling crime scene
text: until the ranch house is just one in a town of modest
text: houses and the pink desert floor spreads out endlessly in
dialog: every direction.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: THE END
