dialog: Screenplay
dialog: by
dialog: Lucinda Coxon
dialog: Based on the novel by
dialog: David Ebershoff
speaker_heading: THE DANISH GIRL
scene_heading: EXT. KATTEGAT SEA, JUTLAND, DENMARK, 1920'S, DAY
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: A rectangle of ferociously stormy sea viewed from battered
text: cliffs. Silver waves are whipped by a wind that flies at us,
text: stinging, relentless. Somewhere, unseen in the barren
text: landscape, something is at its mercy - we hear the RUSTLE and
dialog: PUNCH of the weather going at it...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. WOMAN'S EYE
text: The same scene reflected across the surface of a woman’s
text: brown eye, intense with emotion, curiosity. Gradually, the
text: WEATHER SOUNDS are overtaken by VOICES coming up. At first
text: the SOCIAL CHATTER is PERIPHERAL, then the VOICES grow more
text: STRIDENT, OPPRESSIVE. The eye blinks.
scene_heading: INT. GALLERY, COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, EVENING
text: A painting of the same sea, captured with remarkable accuracy
text: of feeling. A HUBBUB OF GABBLING VOICES. Too many people in
text: a low-ceilinged room. One voice dominates now -
speaker_heading: OLDER WOMAN (0.S.)
dialog: Don't you wish you could paint like
dialog: that?
text: We pull out to see GERDA WEGENER’S brown eyes shift from deep *
text: scrutiny of the painting to polite social focus as she takes
text: in an excited OLDER WOMAN.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I’m sorry...?
speaker_heading: OLDER WOMAN
dialog: I said, don't you wish you could
dialog: paint like your husband? Really - you must
dialog: be so proud...
text: The woman smiles and heads into the crowd, leaving Gerda to
text: consider... Gerda’s gaze travels across the well-dressed
text: gathering. Far off in a corner, there’s an inner circle
text: where her handsome husband EINAR WEGENER is being showered
text: with praise. A portly goateed man dominates the scene -
text: RASMUSSEN, Einar’s dealer.
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: They're all Veijle, where he grew
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26/11/15
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Gerda begins walking toward them through the throng...
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN (cont'd)
dialog: And I don't say my client is
dialog: the best landscape artist in
dialog: Denmark... but, he is in the top
dialog: one!
text: Einar cringes as the crowd laughs, delighted. An exotic-
text: looking woman with mischief playing on her full lips
text: approaches Gerda. This is ULLA FONSMARCK. They're friends.
speaker_heading: ULLA
dialog: (a stage whisper)
dialog: It's going very well.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Oh yes. He’1l be impossible.
text: The women LAUGH. As Gerda looks up, Einar looks across,
text: smiles, trapped in his corner. Gerda nods back, reassuring,
text: conspiratorial. Then Einar’s pulled back into the select
text: circle and Rasmussen emits a ridiculous barking LAUGH.
scene_heading: EXT. COPENHAGEN STREET, NIGHT
text: Gerda and Einar, arm in arm, LAUGHING. Gerda wears a
text: distinctively embroidered fine wool wrap. Their FOOTSTEPS
text: ring down the empty street. A patina of crystallised brine
text: coats doorways, windows, scintillating in the moonlight.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: And Rasmussen...
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Oh, come on. Be kind.
dialog: At least he agreed to see your work.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Only because he was drunk!
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: You were loving it!
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I was not.
text: She mimics Rasmussen, his ludicrous excitement:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: “I don’t say my client is the best
dialog: landscape artist in Denmark...”
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26/11/15
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: “But...”
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: “He is in the top one!”
text: They LAUGH hard. Someone calls from an upstairs window:
scene_heading: MAN AT WINDOW
dialog: Hey - people are sleeping!
text: The window SLAMS. Gerda and Einar struggle to quieten down,
text: head for the dancing harbour lights - partners in crime.
scene_heading: EXT. HARBOUR, NEXT MORNING
scene_heading: - MAIN TITLES BEGIN -
text: Fishermen selling straight off the boats to early-rising
text: customers. Prices are loudly negotiated as the silver catch
text: still writhes and flaps. A city coming to life.
scene_heading: INT. THE WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, MORNING
text: Gerda carries in a breakfast tray. Einar sleeps. She observes
text: his face: long eyelashes, cheeks hollow in repose, delicate
text: lips. A little dog, HVAPPE, trots beside her. She puts down
text: the tray and throws back the bedcover. Einar blinks in the
text: light, surprised. He stretches, takes in the silhouetted
text: outline of his wife: tall, purposeful Gerda.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Do you know what time it is?
text: He smiles, sweetly suggestive of pleasure to come...
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Time you came back to bed?
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: No - I’m ready to start work.
speaker_heading: EINAR
text: Draw down the blinds.
text: She holds back, teases a little.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I told you, I...
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Gerda...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26/11/15
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She takes him in, smiling up at her. Shakes her head.
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: Your face... You think I can’t resist
dialog: you...
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Do you want to resist me?
text: She approaches the edge of the bed, smiling herself now.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: No. But I’d like you to ask nicely
dialog: so I don’t feel such a pushover...
text: Einar reaches towards her.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Gerda Wegener - my life, my wife...
text: He pulls her into bed... A skittish piano comes up as they
text: laugh, begin to make love. Continues over:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE COPENHAGEN OPERA HOUSE
text: Einar crosses the road, heads for the Opera House.
scene_heading: INT. OPERA HOUSE, STAGE DOOR
text: Einar greets the doorman, THORBJORN.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Thorbjorn.
speaker_heading: STAGE DOORMAN
dialog: Mr Wegener.
scene_heading: INT. OPERA HOUSE, COSTUME SHOP, ONE MONTH LATER, DAY
text: Einar walks between racks of clothes that hang in two tiers
text: so the ruffled and feathered hems of jewel-coloured gowns
text: brush his cheeks. An explicit sensual pleasure, which Einar
text: is conscious of but feels no need to investigate. He pauses.
text: The ARIA ceases, he hears women CHATTING, sometimes DROPPING
text: THEIR VOICES, emitting DIRTY LAUGHS, which make him smile and
text: wonder. A stolen intimacy. Einar spies on Ulla, below -
speaker_heading: ULLA (0.S.)
dialog: Tighter!
text: Ulla is being pulled into a corset by a DRESSER. Einar leans
text: forward for a better view... She spots him - is delighted,
text: breaks free for a moment.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26/11/15
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ULLA (cont'd)
dialog: Einar Wegener!
text: The DRESSER hands Ulla a robe to cover up, but:
speaker_heading: ULLA (cont'd)
dialog: Oh don’t worry about him - he’s only ever
dialog: had eyes for one woman.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: My guilty secret’s out.
text: He smiles at her, indulgent. She calls up to him -
speaker_heading: ULLA
dialog: So - when are you two going to breed me a
dialog: godchild?
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: You’re an atheist.
speaker_heading: ULLA
text: I’1l reconsider.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: We're trying.
speaker_heading: ULLA
dialog: Try harder. I’ve been waiting an eternity.
dialog: Have you tried drinking raw eggs?
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ULLA
dialog: Do it. For my sake.
text: Einar shakes his head. She’s impossible and he adores her.
speaker_heading: ULLA (cont'd)
dialog: Anyway what are you doing in today? I
dialog: thought you finished last week?
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I wanted to check on the scrim for the
text: storm scene. And give Gerda some space.
speaker_heading: ULLA
dialog: Ah - she’s got a shy one.
text: Einar nods, smiles. Ulla prepares to resume her fitting.
speaker_heading: ULLA (cont'd)
dialog: You know I’m next?
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: So I heard.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26/11/15
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ULLA
dialog: I won’t be shy.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I should imagine not.
speaker_heading: ULLA
dialog: Good God, she’ll need all her colours for
dialog: me!
text: They LAUGH and Ulla signals to the dresser to pull at the
text: corset once more, smiles in delighted anticipation of the
dialog: discomfort to come.
scene_heading: INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, DAY
text: MR FONNESBECH in a chair on a slightly raised dais. He is
text: formally dressed, somewhat stiff. The room is oppressively
text: still. Gerda looks up from her canvas, goes to adjust
text: Fonnesbech’s arm. He is clearly affected by being touched,
text: embarrassed. She returns to the canvas. After an
text: uncomfortable couple of moments:
speaker_heading: FONNESBECH
dialog: I wanted to say... I appreciate our being
dialog: alone today. I hope your husband doesn’t
dialog: mind.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Not at all. I could see his being here
dialog: made you uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: FONNESBECH
dialog: It wasn’t personal.
text: Gerda smiles. Shakes her head - he shouldn’t worry:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: It’s not uncommon.
speaker_heading: FONNESBECH
dialog: Ah.
text: Fonnesbech’s relieved. Though he’s left with questions.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: It’s hard for a man to be looked at by a
dialog: woman. Women are used to it, of course,
dialog: but for a man...
text: Mr Fonnesbech begins to look wildly vulnerable.
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: To... submit to a woman’s gaze. It’s
dialog: unsettling...
text: Fonnesbech nods, relieved - that’s exactly it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26/11/15
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: Although I believe there’s some pleasure to
dialog: be had from it, once you...
text: She smiles mischievously.
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: «yield.
text: Fonnesbech swallows, cheeks pinking. Suddenly:
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: sit!
text: Fonnesbech flinches. The dog settles. Fonnesbech exhales.
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: Good girl.
text: Gerda returns to work, eyes glinting at what she’s revealed
text: in her sitter: finally getting somewhere.
scene_heading: EXT. WIDOW HOUSE, MONTHS LATER
text: A CHINESE LAUNDRESS with a large wheeled cart makes her way
text: along the street, RINGING a pair of little BELLS as she goes.
scene_heading: INT. WIDOW HOUSE, MORNING
text: Einar quickly but carefully folds Gerda’s chemise and puts it
text: in a bag of laundry, hurries to open the door...
scene_heading: INT/EXT. WIDOW HOUSE, EARLY MORNING, A MONTH LATER
text: Einar hands the bag to the laundress as she passes.
scene_heading: INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, MORNING
text: Gerda at the mirror, putting on her lipstick. Einar comes
text: in, reacts, seeing her dressed up. She’s self-conscious.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Well?
text: Einar can’t help smiling at her implied self-criticism.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Perfect. Almost.
text: He approaches, uses his thumb to gently blend away a smudge
text: of lipstick from her bottom lip. He nods. Perfect now.
speaker_heading: EINAR (cont'd)
dialog: Good luck...
dialog: 26/11/15
scene_heading: EXT. BUSY COPENHAGEN STREET, DAY
text: Gerda carries her heavy portfolio, optimistic, brisk.
scene_heading: INT. ART DEALER'S OFFICE, DAY
text: Rasmussen's face - a look of slight distaste. A sea of
text: Gerda’s work, on the desk, the floor - competent but
text: uninspiring naturalistic depictions of society figures.
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: All portraits...
text: Gerda hesitates a beat, the fact being so self-evident.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Is that bad?
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: Not per se, but... this kind of work is not
dialog: really my...
text: He winces a little. He has to end this:
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN (cont'd)
dialog: Gerda... I don’t think it would benefit
dialog: either of us to show these.
text: A vein begins to throb in Gerda’s neck.
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN (cont'd)
dialog: It’s not a judgement on your abilities - I
dialog: agree with Einar: you could be a first
dialog: class painter if you found the right
dialog: subject matter.
text: It’s the first time Gerda’s heard this. Her eyes shine,
text: stung, betrayed.
scene_heading: INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, DAY
text: Einar works, hears the door. Gerda brings in the portfolio,
text: sets it down, starts taking off her coat. Einar’s tentative:
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: How was it?
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Fine.
text: He waits for more, but nothing comes.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I finally mixed the right colour for the
dialog: snow.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26/11/15
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Gerda glances at the canvas, hostile.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Another view of Vejle. I don’t know how
dialog: you can paint the same thing over and over.
text: Einar misses a beat.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I suppose I just haven’t finished with it
dialog: yet.
text: Gerda heads towards the door.
speaker_heading: EINAR (cont'd)
dialog: Gerda..?
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Could you please not speak to Rasmussen
dialog: about me again... My work is my business.
dialog: Stay out of it.
text: But she disappears into the bedroom, the door slamming
text: emphatically behind her. Einar’s left bewildered.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM, DAY
text: Gerda’s already regretting the exchange with Einar. She
text: unfastens her dress, pulls it off. There’s a bloodstain in
text: her underwear. Damn! She breathes.
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO, DAY
text: Einar working as Gerda reappears. She’s composed now,
text: refocused, approaches her easel, organises her paints. Einar
text: steals a look at her, but says nothing. Works on.
dialog: Eventually:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I have my period.
speaker_heading: EINAR (0.S.)
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Are you?
text: She turns to find him approaching.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Of course I am... You know I am.
text: A moment of quiet intimacy between them. Gerda shies away,
dialog: returns to present concerns... her work...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26/11/15
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Could you help me with something?
text: Einar’s relieved to be able to help.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Anything.
speaker_heading: GERDA
text: Ulla has an extra rehearsal. She cancelled
dialog: again. Would you try on her stockings and
dialog: shoes?
text: Einar’s discomfort erupts in a laugh. Is she serious?
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: I'm just so behind. I don’t know how I’11
dialog: be finished in time for her opening...
text: But he cuts her off:
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I'll do it. It’s fine.
text: Gerda sets a shoebox and the stocking on the sitter’s chair,
text: goes into the kitchen. Einar moves the box and stockings,
text: sits in the chair on the dais. The dog leaps up -
speaker_heading: EINAR (cont'd)
dialog: No... no, not now Hvappe...
text: He pushes Hvappe down, tests the mesh of the stockings between his
text: fingers. He rolls up his trousers.
speaker_heading: EINAR (cont'd)
dialog: He almost snagged this...
text: Gerda marvels at his delicacy. Scolds the dog:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Hvappe...
text: Gerda mixes paints. Einar battles with the stockings.
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: That’s backwards...
text: He fiddles with the second stocking now, a light sweat dewing
text: his forehead by the time he’s rolled both to the knee. He
text: opens a shoebox: - the yellow pair from the shop window.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I saw these in the window of
dialog: Fonnesbech’s...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Smart aren’t they?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26/11/15
dialog: ll.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I don’t think they'll fit...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Well just do what you can.
text: He takes them out... Something catches in Einar’s throat as
text: he pushes his toes into the shoe. Gerda’s eyes are narrow as
text: she starts work. Einar looks down at his feet, partly
text: contained in the yellow suede, the disjuncture between the
text: body above and below the knee... he breathes... can’t keep
text: his hands steady. Then:
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: No. I need the dress.
text: They both look over to where Ulla’s dress hangs. It is white,
text: weighted with beads at the hem and cuff. Beautiful.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Gerda, I’m not putting it on.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I haven’t asked you to.
text: She get sit... lays it across him.
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: Would you just relax...? The sooner I
dialog: start, the sooner I finish.
text: Einar yields reluctantly, as Gerda runs her fingers gently
text: down his face. Satisfied, Gerda returns to work.
text: Einar’s breathing feels slightly laboured now. The dress
text: weighs heavily. His head moves slightly, feeling it brush at
text: his neck. His fingers curl involuntarily around the beaded
text: cuff. The SOUNDSCAPE becomes heightened: the creak of
text: Gerda’s easel, the jangling of her bracelets, the sound of
text: the harbour, the wind in the ships’ riggings. These combine,
dialog: fill his head... until:
speaker_heading: ULLA (0.S.)
dialog: Well hello, there!
text: Einar starts... Ulla’s in the doorway, delighted, with a huge
text: bunch of lilies. She starts to LAUGH, and because it’s Ulla,
text: Gerda LAUGHS also. The dog YAPS, excited, confused. Einar’s
text: disoriented. Gerda sees this, stops laughing, but...
speaker_heading: ULLA (cont'd)
dialog: Oh, don’t worry my darling...
text: She hands the flowers to him, kisses him:
speaker_heading: ULLA (cont'd)
dialog: We're going to call you Lili...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26/11/15
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Einar manages to laugh now as the dog runs BARKING in
text: circles, Ulla’s delight banishing the day’s frustrations.
scene_heading: EXT. HARBOUR, NIGHT
text: There are lights on in the Widow House.
scene_heading: INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, NIGHT
text: Gerda closes the book she’s been reading, looks up to see
text: Einar, working, engrossed. An almost trance-like state. She
text: watches him a while, then approaches, rests her head against
text: his back. He’s comfortable with this, but works on.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Such concentration. Sometimes when you're
dialog: working, I think you’re going to slip
text: through the surface of the painting and
text: vanish.
text: He smiles a little.
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: Sink into the bog. Like your friend’s kite
dialog: when you were a boy.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Hans. It was Hans’ kite I crashed.
text: Einar enjoys the memory for a moment.
speaker_heading: EINAR (cont'd)
dialog: Poor Hans. He was so proud of it...
dialog: I couldn’t believe he even let me
dialog: have a turn...
speaker_heading: GERDA
text: He’s probably still sitting on a
text: rock, sobbing his heart out.
text: Einar sets down his brush, turns toward her, away from his
text: work, smiles.
speaker_heading: EINAR
text: He’s a dealer in Paris, peddling
dialog: Old Masters to rich Americans.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Oh. So we don’t need to worry
dialog: about Hans.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: No we don’t.
text: He takes her in.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I didn’t mean to disturb you.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: That's okay. I’ve finished.
text: He kisses her.
speaker_heading: EINAR (cont'd)
dialog: And don’t worry, I won’t disappear into the
dialog: bog.
text: He widens his eyes, surprised at his own realisation:
speaker_heading: EINAR (cont'd)
dialog: The bog is in me, silly.
text: She pushes him off, LAUGHING.
scene_heading: INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Einar’s in bed. Gerda pulls off her dress, looks round to
text: see him watching her as she lays her stockings over the chair
text: beside her dressing table.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Can’t a man watch his wife get undressed?
text: She goes to take off her lace-edged slip, self-conscious now.
speaker_heading: EINAR (cont'd)
dialog: That slip is new...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: You're very observant.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Leave it on...
text: She hesitates, but Einar pulls back the sheet... Gerda keeps
text: the slip on, climbs in beside him. He strokes her body
dialog: through the silk...
speaker_heading: EINAR (cont'd)
dialog: It’s very pretty...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I might let you borrow it.
text: Einar shrugs, rising flirtatiously to the challenge.
speaker_heading: EINAR

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Oh really...? Is there something you’d like
dialog: to tell me?
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Why...? Is there something you'd like to
dialog: know...?
text: His fingers trace, quivering, over her...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: No... I’m your wife. I know everything.
text: Einar thrills, pulls her on top of him, a fresh passion,
dialog: fresh risk about their union.
scene_heading: INT. COSTUME SHOP, LATER THAT NIGHT
text: A champagne cork POPS. Ulla’s triumphant first night. She’s
text: on magnificent form, working the room. Gerda’s portrait hangs
text: in pride of place. Gerda and Einar chat with a group that
text: includes their friends NIELS and ELSA. Ulla swoops in,
text: WHISPERS something in Gerda’s ear. Gerda’s eyes register
text: delight as she looks across at two young men on the other
text: side of the room.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Both of them...?
speaker_heading: ULLA
dialog: And at the same time!
text: Einar laughs. Gerda shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ULLA (cont'd)
dialog: Married people are so delightfully easy to
dialog: shock.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: We just pretend to be shocked because it
dialog: encourages you.
speaker_heading: ULLA
dialog: I know. That’s why you’re the only
dialog: couple in my party for the Artists
dialog: Ball...
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Out of the question.
speaker_heading: ULLA

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: EINAR

speaker_heading: ULLA
dialog: Gerda without an escort? It would be a

speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Gerda loves a scandal.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: You've had too much champagne.
text: Niels and Elsa hear this, tune in...
speaker_heading: EINAR
text: Look at the way she dresses, flaunting her
text: ankles. An invitation to corruption.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I don’t think anyone is likely to be
dialog: corrupted by seeing my ankles.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I was.
text: The group laughs delighted by Einar’s buoyant mood.
speaker_heading: EINAR (CONT'D) (cont’d)
dialog: The first time we met, I was leaving the
text: Academy, and she was on the steps,
dialog: flaunting said ankles... And she
dialog: propositioned me!
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Is that true?!
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: It was a dare. But when I said hello to
dialog: him, he actually blushed! He was so shy! So
dialog: I asked him out.
speaker_heading: ULLA
dialog: And you said yes -
text: Einar scrutinises Gerda.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: She made me. She seemed so sure.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I was sure. I still am.
speaker_heading: NIELS
dialog: Oh please - enough!

speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: No - what was it about him?

speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I don’t know...
text: She remembers, drawing Einar into the recollection.
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: But we went for coffee, and after, I kissed
dialog: him... and it was the strangest thing... it
dialog: was like kissing myself.
text: A look between Einar and Gerda, a connection crackling.
speaker_heading: ULLA
dialog: Well these two won’t be staying much
dialog: longer...
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Unmarried people are so delightfully easy
dialog: to shock.
text: She and Einar smile, make their way towards the door.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM, NIGHT
text: Einar comes in, Gerda’s already in bed. He starts to
text: undress, turns out the light.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Turn it back on.
text: He looks at her. She shrugs, smiles - it’s her turn, after
text: all... He turns it back on, a little awkward now, undressing
text: in front of her. She sees this, toughs it out, watching him
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: Were you really corrupted by my ankles?
text: Einar wears just his shirt now, begins to unbutton.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: You were shameless.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I still am.
text: Einar peels off his shirt. Underneath, he wears Gerda’s lace-

scene_heading: INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, MORNING
text: Einar asleep, a SCRATCHING sound in the background. We see
text: quick charcoal strokes on paper, Gerda wrapped in Einar’s
text: dressing gown, at the side of the bed. She’s fascinated,
text: suddenly able to see the femininity of his features, plays
text: with it, creating a revised Einar... His eyes open...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Did I wake you?
text: He raises his eyebrows, entertained. What does she think?
text: She smiles, carries on working.
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: Sorry... I couldn’t sleep.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Wondering about things.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: What things?
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Wondering if we made a baby last night.
text: Einar smiles, surprised.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: What d’you think?
text: Gerda shrugs, keeps sketching.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Wondering when you got so pretty.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Oh, I was always pretty, you just never

text: Gerda LAUGHS, keeps working.
scene_heading: INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, A WEEK LATER

speaker_heading: EINAR

dialog: conscious...
speaker_heading: EINAR (cont'd)
dialog: These are good.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Do you think?
text: He nods, absolutely serious. Gerda absorbs this, gratified.
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: Well thank you. Thank you.
text: Gerda goes out to hang up her coat, calls -
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: I had coffee with Ulla.
dialog: about the Artists’ Ball.
dialog: She asked
text: Einar draws breath to protest, but:
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: Don’t worry - I told her no.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: You should go, you enjoy it.
speaker_heading: GERDA

speaker_heading: EINAR

speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: And that’s why you hate them.

speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: Why not give them something different, go
dialog: as someone else?
text: She tilts her head. A look between them... this is a
text: departure... Einar hesitates a moment...
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Did you have someone in particular in mind?
text: A mischievous smile spreads across Gerda’s face... she starts
text: to laugh, Einar begins to understand... laughs along...
speaker_heading: EINAR (cont'd)
dialog: No - that’s outrageous!
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: You'd be very convincing... You might even
dialog: enjoy it...
text: Einar marvels at her... she’s only half-joking.
scene_heading: INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, EVENING
text: Gerda sweeps a layer of foundation over Einar’s face. When
text: she’s done, he opens his eyes. Gerda’s taken aback.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: You'll have to shave closer.
text: Einar takes in his blanked-out face in the shaving mirror.
text: Gerda goes to apply eyeliner...
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: Close your eyes... This is hard on someone
dialog: else...
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Here...

speaker_heading: EINAR (cont'd)
dialog: How’s that?
text: She marvels at his reflection. It’s bizarrely compelling.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Better than I ever manage.

speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Come on, Hvap!
text: Hvappe jumps onto his lap. Gerda sketches quickly, absorbed,
text: excited. She rearranges him, ‘feminising’ his poses.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Knee over... head up.. Look at
dialog: those hands... relax...
text: We see Einar at a series of angles... but his movements are
text: more and more parodically feminine for Gerda’s entertainment.
text: The more he acts it, the more fun it is, until finally Gerda
text: scolds, still laughing:
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: No, don’t make her a slut!
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: It’s your fault, you excite her.
text: Gerda gets close to pin him still. His face closes on hers.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Why, Miss Lili, you are forward...
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: You have no idea...
text: He falls on her, laughing, passionate... Gerda responds, but
text: grabs a cloth and wipes his made-up face as he kisses her.
scene_heading: MONTAGE BEGINS -—
scene_heading: INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM
text: We see Gerda’s work around the room, now, depicting ‘Lili’s’
text: progress. Einar, at the mirror, plucks his eyebrows to better

scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE WIDOW HOUSE

scene_heading: EXT. HARBOUR, FISH STALL, DAY

scene_heading: INT. OPERA HOUSE, STAGE DOOR

speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Morning, Thorbjorn... 43
speaker_heading: STAGE DOORMAN
dialog: Good morning.
scene_heading: INT. OPERA HOUSE, COSTUME SHOP, DAY
text: Gerda and Einar try on wigs, surreptitious, excited, adjust
text: one another’s choices. Then, a long line of almost identical
text: shoes, beginning in tiny sizes but gradually getting bigger.
text: Einar grabs the last - biggest - pair. When he looks up,
text: Gerda’s showing him a dress...
scene_heading: INT. OPERA HOUSE, STAGE DOOR, DAY
text: Einar and Gerda head out past the stage doorman, very pleased
text: with themselves. Gerda is several sizes fatter and taller -
text: she wears a wig with a hat on top. Hands stuffed into coat
text: pockets hide bulky shoes. Thorbjorn looks up briefly from
text: his newspaper. Then as the door closes behind Einar and
dialog: Gerda, he looks up again - ?
scene_heading: - MONTAGE ENDS -—
scene_heading: INT. WIDOW HOUSE, EVENING
text: The Lili sketches depict a gamut of moods, face and posture
text: already becoming iconic. Einar in the slip and the new

speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I wondered where you were, it’s getting
dialog: late.
text: Gerda comes in...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: We have plenty of time. I bought these...

text: Gerda’s a little taken aback at his enthusiasm.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET NEAR CANAL, NEAR ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS, NIGHT
text: Dancing light and sound - up ahead, we see a glamorous,
dialog: eclectic gathering: the fun-loving, the arrogant, the
text: eccentric, the bourgeois - all rubbing shoulders on their
dialog: way to the Royal Academy.
text: Two pairs of women’s feet in step: Gerda and Einar, approach
text: the melee. Then Gerda realises Einar has slowed, dropped
text: back behind her. She turns to see him transformed in a
text: chiffon dress with a linen sailor’s collar and cuffs...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: What is it...?
text: Einar’s eyes shine animated. He cuts an ungainly figure, but
text: the impression is more confusing than jarring.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Am I pretty enough?
text: Gerda’s surprised by the sincerity of the question.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Of course you are...
text: He takes Gerda’s hand and she pulls closer.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I’ll never be as pretty as you.
text: Gerda studies the features, the fire behind the eyes. An
dialog: intensity she had not been expecting... something new... A
text: charged moment... Gerda’s genuinely moved... but then
text: Einar/Lili laughs, breaks away... leaving Gerda with a beat
text: of emotion that doesn’t belong anywhere.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS, STAIRCASE, NIGHT
text: Gerda and ‘Lili’ mingle with the crowd. A VOICE rings out:
speaker_heading: ULLA
dialog: My darling!
text: A flicker of fear in Lili... until Gerda interposes herself:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Ulla, let me introduce...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Ulla’'s eyes snag for a moment as they search the familiar

speaker_heading: ULLA
dialog: It’s Lili...!
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: That's right. Einar’s cousin from
dialog: Vejle...
speaker_heading: ULLA
dialog: My dear, you're exquisite...
text: She LAUGHS, thrilled, exchanges a look with Gerda. Lili’s
text: eyelashes flutter, a picture of shyness as Ulla summons the
text: rest of her party - revelling in their shared secret...
speaker_heading: ULLA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: In - let’s go in...
text: Gerda and Lili - holding hands - join the crush:
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: You won’t leave me, will you...?
text: Gerda looks down at Einar/Lili’s grip on her hand.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: (sincerely)
dialog: No. No, never.
text: She squeezes the hand and they press forward together.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS, GREAT HALL, NIGHT
text: A spectacular event. An orchestra plays and people dance.
text: Ulla’s party drink and laugh. Gerda and Lili hang back a
text: little, observing. There’s a circle of men in tuxedos nearby.
text: One glances across at Lili. Lili looks away, blushing.
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
text: People are looking.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Well you're a pretty girl, you'll
dialog: have to get used to that.
text: But she sees Lili’s really uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: GERDA (CONT'D) (cont’d)
dialog: It’s fine. You're just feeling
text: self-conscious.
speaker_heading: ELSA (0.S.)

speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: Go and talk to her...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: No, I‘’1l stay with you...
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: Go. I’ll be fine. Go before she
dialog: comes over here...
text: Gerda reluctantly crosses the room and greets Elsa warmly.
text: But by the time she glances back, Lili has gone.
text: Lili sits at the edge of the dancefloor on a bench carved
text: with mermaids, a nerve fluttering in her cheek. We see a
text: young man, HENRIK SANDAHL, study her closely - closely enough
text: to see she is not everything she appears, but this only seems
text: to intrigue him. He sits beside her. Lili self-consciously
text: takes a notebook from her bag, begins to jot things down.
text: Henrik leans in, his raven hair in Lili’s peripheral vision,
text: leans forward until Lili’s refusal to engage becomes comical.
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: Are you a reporter?
text: Lili looks up.
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: (flatly)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: A poetess...?
text: Lili packs up the notebook and hurries away... Finds a
text: corridor, leading off the hall - quieter, darker...
text: Lili feels her way along the wall, relieved to be in the
text: cooler air, away from the party. As her eyes adjust to the
text: darkness, she sees a couple kissing in an alcove. A flash of
text: the woman’s white thigh, as the man pushes up her dress.
text: Lili turns away, discomfited, walks straight back into
dialog: Henrik.
speaker_heading: HENRIK (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: Do you know the story of this oak
dialog: tree?
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: Mm...?
text: Henrik indicates a tree outside, behind Lili...

speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: Why would they say that...?

speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: Henrik Sandahl. At your disposal.
text: A moment’s hesitation, then:
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: Lili...
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: Are you here with someone, Lili?
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: Yes - my cousin’s wife.
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: Who’s your cousin?
text: Lili hesitates, turns back:
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: Einar Wegener. He’s a painter.
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: Rather a good one. Better than
dialog: most people think.
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: Is that right?
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: Most people our age at any rate.
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: Well....
text: She makes to leave again, but:
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: Don’t go back in. It’s cooler
dialog: here. Besides, I’m a romantic.
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: Oh really...
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: I prefer the shadows and...

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HENRIK (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: I don’t mean to presume, but I’ve
dialog: been watching you.
text: A tremor of panic runs through Lili...
speaker_heading: HENRIK (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: I think you might be the same.
text: Henrik holds out his hand. Lili looks at it, a sense of
text: connection she can’t understand, previously unimaginable...
text: Then, trembling, Lili reaches out and rests her delicate,
text: manicured hand in Henrik’s... and suddenly her nerves are
text: completely steady. Henrik leads Lili along the corridor,
dialog: away from the hall...
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS, GREAT HALL, NIGHT
text: Noisier and smokier now, too much aquavit drunk, the guests a
text: little out of focus. Gerda scans the dishevelled crowds,
text: concerned - no sign of Lili. Suddenly, Ulla’s at her side.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Have you seen Einar? I can’t find
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ULLA
dialog: Of course you can’t, he isn’t here!
text: Ulla and Gerda laugh... Ulla raises her glass... more fun!
text: But Gerda excuses herself, and continues looking...
scene_heading: EXT. ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS, LIFE-DRAWING ROOM, NIGHT
text: Lili and Henrik sit on a bench in the lee of a sculpted
text: classical nude. Lili’s cheeks burn. Henrik is clearly
text: fascinated. The slight sense of playacting between them only
text: heightens their excitement.
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: You're different from other girls.
text: Lili scoffs gently.
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: That’s not a very original line.
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: It’s true. You’re old fashioned.

speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: Provincial. I’m new to the city.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: No, it’s more than that. I feel
dialog: I'd need to ask permission before I
dialog: kissed you.
text: A bolt of something goes through Lili. Her eyes sink, drawn
text: and repulsed, to Henrik’s lips. She can hardly breathe...
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: I probably ought to find Gerda.
text: She heads back toward the corridor... Henrik grabs her hand.
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: Why don’t you tell her I’11l walk
dialog: you home...?
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: She wouldn’t like that...
text: He advances, his body pressing against her, commanding,
text: holding her fixed in the doorway...
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: Lili...
text: Lili pulls away, flustered, aroused...
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: Einar might be waiting up... he
dialog: wouldn’t like this...
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: Wouldn’t he...?
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: Lili...

speaker_heading: HENRIK (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: Lili... Lili.
text: Three times a charm... We see something shift in Lili...
text: Henrik senses it... He kisses her. When he releases her she
text: gasps, and he kisses her again, finds his passion returned
text: this time... When she finally catches her breath she can’t
dialog: look at him...
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: You didn’t ask permission...
speaker_heading: HENRIK

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Standing in the corridor, by the oak, Gerda watches, stunned,

text: Lili looks down, confused and then panicked. Blood pours
text: from her nose, down the front of her dress... she’s appalled.
speaker_heading: HENRIK (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: What’s happened..? Let me...
text: Henrik tries to find a handkerchief... Then sees Gerda
text: approaching... He pulls away from Lili...
speaker_heading: HENRIK (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: I’m sorry I don’t know what...
text: Lili holds out her arms to Gerda. Henrik steps back... Gerda
text: reaches Lili, quickly takes her weight... Gerda wraps her
text: scarf around ‘Lili’, who now looks like Einar in grotesque
text: drag, smeared with make-up and blood.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Quickly, lean on me...
text: Henrik watches, and onlookers stare as Gerda supports Einar
text: out of the ball... They stumble, clinging together, ashamed.
scene_heading: INT. WIDOW HOUSE, NEXT MORNING
text: Einar paints. In a smart male suit. He is stiffly composed.
text: Gerda comes into the studio, in her nightclothes. Finds
text: Einar deeply immersed. No trace of the night’s upset.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: How are you...?
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: You were late home last night, I
dialog: thought I’d let you sleep. How was
dialog: it? Did Lili have fun?
text: Gerda’s stunned. Goes to the kitchen, upset.
text: In the kitchen, Lili’s bloodied clothes are soaking in a
text: bucket. Gerda struggles with the sight. Begins to make
dialog: coffee, then...
text: Gerda returns to the studio, watches Einar, anger building.
text: He allows it a while, then turns, braced to face her:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I think it would be better if Lili
dialog: didn’t come here again.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Fine. I understand.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: GERDA (CONT'D) (cont’d)
dialog: Exactly what happened between you
dialog: and Sandahl last night?
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Nothing.
text: Gerda HUFFS, disbelieving. Einar repeats himself, angrily:
speaker_heading: EINAR (CONT'D) (cont’d)
dialog: It was nothing.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Did he know it was you?
text: Einar blushes, shies away.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: It wasn’t as simple as that. It’s
dialog: hard to explain...
text: Gerda loses control, shouts at him:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I watched him kiss you, Einar, so
dialog: could you please make an effort?!
text: Einar’s shocked, ashamed. He takes stock, then quietly:
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: He may have known who I was. But I
dialog: wasn’t always... me. There was a
dialog: moment when I was... just Lili.
dialog: And I think he could see that. Do
dialog: you see?
text: Gerda struggles to comprehend this shift in the landscape.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: But Lili doesn’t exist. We made
dialog: her up.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I know...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: We were playing a game!
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I know we were... but then it

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: This is absurd. We need to stop.
dialog: Make it stop Einar.
dialog: With genuine anxiety:
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I’m going to try...
text: She goes, still distressed, leaving Einar alone.
scene_heading: EXT. WIDOW HOUSE, EARLY MORNING, TWO WEEKS LATER
text: The Chinese Laundress RINGS her tiny BELLS along the street.
scene_heading: INT. WIDOW HOUSE, MORNING
text: The Lili portraits are gone. Einar regards a canvas. Failing
text: to paint. In the kitchen, Gerda chops vegetables, throws
text: them in a pan. She hovers in the doorway to the studio.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Another headache?
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: It’s nothing...
text: She goes back into the kitchen again...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Can I get you something?
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I’m fine.
text: Gerda returns to chopping.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Maybe you should see a doctor.
text: Einar grows agitated.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Gerda... I’m fine.
text: Gerda looks round to see Einar now in his coat. He quickly
text: collects a small suitcase, goes out, leaving Gerda to fret.
scene_heading: EXT. OPERA HOUSE, DAY
text: No lights on, no signs of life.
dialog: 26/11/15
dialog: 31.
scene_heading: INT. OPERA HOUSE, STAGE DOOR, DAY
text: Einar passes through, nods amiably to the familiar doorman.
scene_heading: INT. COSTUME SHOP, DAY
text: Einar turns on the lights, quickly pulls off his coat. He
text: leans forward, bracing against the bench, looks in the
text: mirror. There’s a desperation about him. But now he sees:
text: the front of his shirt gapes - reveals a cleavage, formed by
text: his rounded shoulders. Einar is compelled... nervously
text: unbuttons his shirt to the waist and leans forward again.
text: The effect is startling. He traces the shape of his
text: ‘breasts’ with trembling hands.
text: With a new urgency, he quickly strips off shirt, trousers,
text: terrified that someone might catch him, yet driven to press
text: on. He pulls off his underwear, returns to the mirror, pushes
text: his cock back between his legs, squeezing his thighs tight
text: until he has an approximation of a vagina. He rounds his
text: shoulders, takes in the arresting transformation, breathless
text: with excitement, terror. A sense of impending inevitable
dialog: transgression.
text: He opens his case. A carefully folded silk package unfurls
text: into a dress, brushes against his skin.
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO, DAY
text: Gerda sits in the chair looking out of the window, face set
text: against terror, her sketchbook closed in her lap, brooding,
text: pressure building. She opens the sketchbook: Lili...
scene_heading: INT CAFE ON CANAL, DAY
text: Einar/Lili arrives inside a cafe, pushes back a headscarf. We
text: see Henrik waiting at a table. He quickly stands when he
text: spots Lili - who is consumed with shyness, real fear.
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: I didn’t think you'd come.
text: Lili settles in her seat.
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: No. Nor did I.
scene_heading: INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, LATER
text: Gerda begins to sketch, almost afraid to begin. But her
text: energy gathers and there is soon anger and desire in the work
text: as she conjures a Lili with dark erotic potential, a frenzied
dialog: relationship with the subject developing...
dialog: 26/11/15
dialog: 32.
scene_heading: INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, EVENING
text: Gerda lies on the chaise, exhausted. Hears the door, doesn’t
text: move. Einar appears, in his overcoat. After a moment:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I thought you might not come back.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: That’s absurd...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Is it?
dialog: Einar can hardly bear the question... feels terrible, wraps
text: his arms around her. Then sees, at an angle, in the half-
text: light, the new Lili picture. A nude with female hips and
text: breasts. A slash of red mouth. A cigarette.
scene_heading: INT. ART DEALER'S OFFICE, A MONTH LATER, DAY
text: A door opens and Gerda sits up - a THIN YOUNG MAN appears.
scene_heading: THIN YOUNG MAN
dialog: He won’t be much longer.
text: Gerda sits back, too pessimistic to feel nervous.
scene_heading: INT. ART DEALER'S OFFICE, HALF AN HOUR LATER
text: Rasmussen studies a series of Gerda’s portraits, his mouth
text: puckered with poorly disguised distaste. Gerda steels
dialog: herself to withstand the humiliation.
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: I just... I don’t know...
text: And then he sees the Lili nude. He’s suddenly intrigued...
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN (cont'd)
dialog: The model...?
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Einar’s cousin.
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: Yes, the resemblance is...
text: Rasmussen’s mind races.
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN (cont'd)
dialog: Are there others...?
speaker_heading: GERDA
text: A series back at the studio.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26/11/15
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Rasmussen licks his lips, excited but uncertain...
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: These are different... For these, I don’t
dialog: know... there may be a market.
text: Gerda has to confirm what she’s heard:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: You're taking them.
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: Well, yes...
text: He’s surprised as she is.
scene_heading: EXT. HENRIK'S HOUSE, DAY
text: Lili hurries past the endless orange facades of a long row of
text: terraced houses, Gerda’s embroidered wrap flying in the wind
text: behind her. Knocks at a door, breathless...
scene_heading: INT. HENRIK'S HOUSE, DAY
text: Henrik welcomes Lili at the open door...
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: Come in...
text: He closes the door against the world. Lili takes in the
text: space. She’s delighted by it -
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: I don’t have long... Gerda’s seeing
dialog: Rasmussen.
text: Henrik gestures for Lili to sit. She settles on the couch.
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: I don’t like all these lies.
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: She's very protective.
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: Why don’t you just tell her about
dialog: us?
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: I couldn’t do that...
text: Lili seems a little panicked...
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: Sorry - I don’t want to upset you.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26/11/15
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He sits beside her, settles her...
speaker_heading: HENRIK (cont'd)
dialog: Come here...
text: Lili lets herself be drawn closer to him... He strokes her
text: face. Lili smiles, adoring. Henrik kisses her and she
text: responds eagerly. His hand works its way down her body,
text: between her legs. Lili squirms, uncomfortable. He
text: persists... Lili bears it as long as she can, then gently:
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: No... Henrik...
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: No...
text: Still in the moment of passion...
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: Einar...
text: Lili recoils, stunned... astonished...
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: What...?
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: (sweetly)
dialog: Come on... it’s alright...
text: But Lili pushes him away, upset, bewildered...
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: I’m sorry, I don’t understand...
text: Henrik’s frustrated.
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: Einar... please...
text: Lili panics, grabs her things to leave, horribly exposed...
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: I don’t know what you mean... I don’t know
dialog: what you want...
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: I want you!
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: No...

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HENRIK
dialog: Yes... wait... Wait! Lili... Lili, come
dialog: back...
text: But Lili bolts, away and out through the front door, leaving
text: Henrik powerless, bereft.
scene_heading: EXT. HENRIK’S HOUSE, DAY
text: Lili rushes away, disorientated, along the row of garish
text: facades, their orange now seeming grotesque...
scene_heading: INT. WIDOW HOUSE, DAY
text: Gerda struggles in with her portfolio. Heads for the kitchen,
text: preoccupied by her experience with Rasmussen, is taken aback
text: to see Lili at the table, Gerda’s embroidered wrap pulled
text: tight about her. Then Lili looks round - her face swollen and
text: streaked with tears.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: Are you alright...?
text: Lili reaches out her hand and Gerda takes it...
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: No...
text: She holds Gerda at arms length. Takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI (cont'd)
dialog: I've been seeing Henrik Sandahl.
text: Gerda reels, speechless as Lili clatters out, stumbling to
text: the bedroom. Closes the bedroom door.
scene_heading: INT. WIDOW HOUSE, KITCHEN, 20 MINUTES LATER
text: Gerda sits - waiting. Finally, Einar comes back, in male
text: clothing. Looks devastated.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I thought perhaps you knew.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: (barely audible)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: You always seemed to know everything.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Not this.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He nods. Gerda’s desperate confusion surfaces:
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: So... are you in love with Sandahl?
dialog: Einar’s appalled:
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: No - I love you, Gerda, only you. But
dialog: Lili...
text: Angry tears well in Gerda’s eyes.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Why can’t you just be honest about this!
dialog: But Einar’s angry too...
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I'm trying! Gerda... please... I
dialog: need you to believe me. You of all
dialog: people to understand.
text: Gerda shakes her head, unable to take this in... He looks at
text: her, desperate imploring... Gerda struggles:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Okay, I need you to tell me... when Henrik
dialog: and ‘Lili’ are together, they what...? They
dialog: kiss - we know that...
text: Einar nods, awkward. Gerda steels herself:
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: Has it gone beyond that?
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: No... No, Lili’s never gone further than
dialog: that with aman. She... she wouldn’t...
text: Gerda hears the implication... a bodyblow for her:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: There have been other men?
text: Einar sits on the bed, bites down on something difficult:
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: There was another, but it was a long time
dialog: ago.
text: A chill runs through Gerda... Einar gathers his courage.
speaker_heading: EINAR (cont'd)
dialog: That boy Hans... back in Vejle.
text: Gerda rubs her brow... everything’s happening too fast...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26/11/15
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: EINAR (cont'd)
text: Lili fell for him. And he kissed her. Just
dialog: once.
text: Einar darkens at the memory:
speaker_heading: EINAR (cont'd)
dialog: But my father came in and he caught them...
dialog: He knocked Hans down - he was so angry...
text: Einar shakes his head... Gerda absorbs this. She looks up -
text: Einar looks pale, dark circles under his eyes.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I don’t know what to say.
text: He breathes suddenly, against pain...
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: What...?
text: His eyes close, sweat forming on his brow.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I’m so sorry...
text: He doubles over, clutching his stomach... moans horribly...
speaker_heading: EINAR (cont'd)
dialog: I’m so sorry... I’m not feeling
dialog: well.
text: He tries to get up from the table, struggles...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Einar... what is this? What’s happening...
text: She rushes to catch him as his legs give out under him...
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: Einar... Einar...?
scene_heading: INT. RADIUM INSTITUTE, DAY
text: DR HEXLER closes the door firmly on Gerda, leaving her to
text: fret in the waiting room. She settles for a long wait.
scene_heading: INT. RADIUM INSTITUTE, HEXLER’S CONSULTING ROOM, DAY
text: Hexler sits behind a desk. He’s brisk but kind.
speaker_heading: HEXLER
dialog: So, you saw Dr Andersen after a

speaker_heading: HEXLER (cont'd)
dialog: How long have you been married?
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Six years.
text: Hexler takes notes as Einar continues stripping.
speaker_heading: HEXLER
dialog: Children?
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HEXLER
dialog: Is there regular copulation?
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Yes. Perhaps less now than...
speaker_heading: HEXLER
dialog: Than before you started to dress as a
dialog: woman?
text: Einar’s shocked to hear this out loud.
speaker_heading: HEXLER (cont'd)
dialog: Mr Wegener I’m a specialist. You
dialog: may be embarrassed - I am not.
speaker_heading: HEXLER (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: So. Tell me about Lili. Where
dialog: does she come from?
dialog: Einar considers...
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Inside me.
dialog: Hexler seeks to inject a rational note...
speaker_heading: HEXLER
dialog: You know the most likely
dialog: explanation for all this is a
dialog: chemical imbalance?
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Really...?
speaker_heading: HEXLER
text: Onto the bed.
text: Einar climbs onto a raised doctor's couch.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26/11/15
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HEXLER (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: That would explain the pain, the
dialog: confused state of masculinity and
dialog: the infertility. Let’s hope it is
dialog: that, because that we can cure.
text: He switches on the bright examination lamp, places his palm
text: against Einar’s lower abdomen.
scene_heading: INT. RADIUM INSTITUTE, X-RAY ROOM, DAY
text: Einar is strapped to a hospital trolley by a couple of
text: nurses. Hexler watches through a window onto the room.
text: Einar grasps Gerda’s hand, anxious, bewildered:
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I don’t need to do this... There’s
dialog: nothing wrong with me..
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Einar, that’s not true.
text: The nurses nod to Gerda to leave.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: This can’t be right...
dialog: The nurses wait...
speaker_heading: HEXLER
dialog: (over tannoy)
dialog: Radiation is a miracle, Mr Wegener:
text: it destroys the bad and saves the
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: He says it will be over very
dialog: quickly...
text: The nurses lead Gerda out... Einar takes in the alien
text: machinery of the room. She watches helplessly through a
text: tinted window as the X-ray machine begins to WHIRR. Hexler
text: speaks into a funnel:
speaker_heading: HEXLER (CONT'D)
dialog: Lie still, Mr Wegener...
text: The JUDDERING of the machine fills Einar’s head... an
text: overwhelming assault on the senses... He closes his eyes,
text: vanishes into himself.
scene_heading: INT. RADIUM INSTITUTE, RECOVERY ROOM, NEXT DAY
text: Einar drowses.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: HEXLER (0.S.)
dialog: Mr Wegener...?

speaker_heading: HEXLER (cont'd)
dialog: How are you feeling this morning?
text: Einar considers the question for a moment, then —
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: You’ve hurt Lili...
text: Hexler reads the distress in Einar’s features. Einar closes
text: his eyes again against the thought.
scene_heading: INT. RADIUM INSTITUTE, CORRIDOR, DAY
text: Hexler speaks to Gerda with new gravity.
speaker_heading: HEXLER
dialog: I'm afraid your husband’s aberrant thinking
dialog: persists. Do you keep a lock on your
dialog: wardrobe?
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Of course not.
text: Hexler is nervous, but his tone is threatening.
speaker_heading: HEXLER
dialog: Mrs Wegener, you haven’t been encouraging
dialog: this delusion? You do understand that your
dialog: husband's insane?
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: No, that’s not true...
text: Hexler turns, walks away. Gerda’s furious...
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: We trusted you, we came to you for help...
text: But Hexler keeps walking without a backward glance.
scene_heading: EXT. HARBOUR, MORNING, TWO WEEKS LATER
text: The early sun glances off the windows of the Widow House.
scene_heading: INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, MORNING
text: The dog looks up from the bed. Runs over to greet Gerda who
text: has just come in from the studio. We see now the dog is

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GERDA

scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE RASMUSSEN’S GALLERY, DAY
text: Gerda hurries past the window. Inside we can make out a blur
text: of Lili portraits on show.
scene_heading: INT. ART DEALER'S OFFICE, COPENHAGEN, DAY
text: Gerda in Rasmussen's office. He’s unusually excited.
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: Gerda! Where have you been?
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Away. Why, what’s wrong?
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: I sold the Lili portraits!
text: Gerda is astonished...
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN (cont'd)
dialog: I have enough interest to mount a full
dialog: show.
text: Gerda’s amazed.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Well that’s wonderful...
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: And there’s more - I had a call from the
dialog: Etienne Dufour Gallery - they would like to
dialog: represent you in Paris.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: In Paris...?
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: You should go and see them.

speaker_heading: GERDA

dialog: fickle.
text: Rasmussen tuts, disapproving.
text: INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STAIRS LEADING UP, DAY
text: Gerda, in a hurry, stops to collect the mail from the foot of
text: the stairs. There’s an art magazine, a personal letter,
text: then, underneath an envelope from The Radium Institute...
text: Hexler’s name on the back. Gerda freezes, then quickly opens
dialog: it, reads: “no choice... treated for perversion...". She
text: struggles for a moment, panic rising, then folds the letter,
text: stuffs it in her jacket. A dark decision resolves itself in
dialog: Gerda’s face...
scene_heading: INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, DAY
text: Einar’s asleep. Gerda packs, driven - sees Einar sit up.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Gerda gathers her courage.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I've been asked to exhibit in Paris...
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: That’s wonderful...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Yes. We have to go. Rasmussen said it
dialog: would make all the difference...
dialog: Einar’s incredulous...
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I’m not sure I can do that...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: You can. I’11 take care of you...
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: But surely there’s no rush...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: (furious)
dialog: Can’t you just do this one thing for me?
text: But by the time her outburst is over, she’s shaking...
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Gerda, what’s happening?

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I had a letter from Hexler...
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: He wants to lock me up.
text: Gerda holds his hands, utterly determined:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: But he won't. Everything will work out for
dialog: us. Really - I know it. You just have to
dialog: trust me...
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I do...
dialog: Gerda steels herself:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: So. Is there anything to take care of
dialog: before we go? Anyone you need to tell?
text: Einar considers a moment, then:
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: No.
text: Gerda nods, relieved. She kisses his cheek, resumes packing.
text: Einar concentrates on keeping breathing.
scene_heading: EXT. PARIS BY NIGHT
text: A dazzling archetypal view of the Seine and its light-studded
text: bridges, the Cathedral of Notre Dame a bold silhouette in the
text: background. VOICES come up, an EXCITED SOCIAL SOUND.
scene_heading: INT. ETIENNE DUFOUR GALLERY, NIGHT, 6 MONTHS LATER
text: An emphatically chic Parisian crowd admires a triumphant
dialog: series of Lili portraits - a couple that we saw at
text: Rasmussen's, and then several nudes, Lili imagined as an
text: anatomically correct woman. A small group gathers round
text: Gerda, their new star, and a still pale Einar.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Einar’s a painter too...
speaker_heading: MAN IN GROUP
dialog: Oh? Do you exhibit in Paris?
speaker_heading: EINAR

speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: No, she stayed behind in Denmark.
scene_heading: ENTHUSIASTIC AMERICAN WOMAN
dialog: Oh, I was so hoping to meet her.
text: Einar looks down, away, affected... Gerda’s swept off by the
text: gallery owner, leaving Einar in the company of the paintings
text: of his own banished self.
scene_heading: INT. PARIS APARTMENT, BEDROOM, NIGHT
text: Gerda and Einar in bed, close, tenderness on both sides.
text: Gerda gently kisses Einar, then begins to work her way down
text: his torso. He closes his eyes, wills himself to let this
text: happen... Gerda begins to fellate him... He struggles with
text: his breathing, intensely challenged
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Gerda... please... I can’t.
text: She continues... He’s overwhelmed with panic, pushes her off.
speaker_heading: EINAR (cont'd)
dialog: No...
text: The attempt at intimacy is over, failed. Einar’s full of
text: guilt, distress. Gerda’s hurt, lost. Neither moves -
text: emotional paralysis.
scene_heading: INT. PARIS APARTMENT, STUDIO, - NEXT DAY
text: Gerda works on a self-portrait. Einar appears. Gerda
text: hurries, to greet him, summons a playful mood, born of
dialog: desperation.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Will you sit for me? Just as you
dialog: are. We haven’t done that since
dialog: art school. You enjoyed it then...
text: He smiles. She strokes his face, encouraged.
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
text: The teacher suddenly at the mercy of the
dialog: student. You found it exciting.

speaker_heading: EINAR

speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I miss you. I miss you working beside me.
text: Einar hesitates, then admits:
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I can’t remember the landscape any more. I
dialog: can’t remember Vejle.
text: Gerda struggles to adjust to this, then:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Well you could help me with this
dialog: background. What does it need...?
text: Einar looks at the painting, can hardly pull it into focus...
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
text: An kettlehole lake? A farmhouse, far off?
text: He gently stops her -
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Gerda...
text: He’s not going to do it. Turns away, goes out.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. PARIS APARTMENT
text: Gerda watches from the window: Einar in the street below, on
text: through the crowds until he’s out of sight.
scene_heading: EXT. RUE DE NUIT, DAY
text: Different part of town, different atmosphere. Prostitutes on
text: the corner CLUCK indulgent as Einar passes. He looks self-
text: consciously about, enters a dingy house as another man comes
text: out. They barely acknowledge one another.
scene_heading: INT. 22 RUE DE NUIT, 1ST FLOOR LANDING, DAY
text: A hatch in a door slides open, and MADAME CARTON’s eyes flash

scene_heading: INT. 22 RUE DE NUIT, ROOM NO. 3, DAY
text: The tiny room contains a chair and a bin. We hear GROANS from
text: an adjoining room. There are two small windows with black
text: shades drawn. Einar settles, slowly lifts one of the shades.
text: Behind smudged glass, a worn-out girl in a corset and
text: stockings grinds against a chair, sullen. Beyond her, we see

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: another dark window, another man with his nose pressed
dialog: against it.

text: breathes, an almost orgasmic GASPING breath of relief.
scene_heading: INT. HANS OFFICE, QUAI D’ORSAY, PARIS, A WEEK LATER, DAY
text: HANS AXGIL on the telephone. An impressively upholstered man,
text: quixotic, appealing. The emphatically masculine room - dark
text: wood infused with Hans’ cigar smoke - overlooks a
text: breathtaking view of the Seine. A sense of space, freedom.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Hey, he’s playing with us! He knows the
dialog: price...
text: Hans laughs, shakes his head. A quiet KNOCK and a secretary
text: pulls a face around the door. Hans waves her away, impatient.
speaker_heading: HANS (cont'd)
dialog: Look, I have to go. I have some Danish girl
dialog: waiting to see me. But tell him we’ll find

scene_heading: INT. HANS AXGIL’S OFFICE, RECEPTION, DAY

speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Well, I don’t know why Rasmussen
dialog: gave you my number, but I’m happy

speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I asked him, I wanted to meet you,

speaker_heading: GERDA

text: But his amazement shifts as it comes back to him...
speaker_heading: HANS (cont'd)
dialog: Oh no! You’re right... We were fooling

speaker_heading: HANS (cont'd)
dialog: We were just little boys, you know,

speaker_heading: HANS (cont'd)
dialog: God - Einar. Hey - why didn’t he come
dialog: today?
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: He doesn’t know I’m here. I don’t think

speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: We don’t really know people here. And
dialog: Einar’s... he’s lost his way. He’s not
dialog: working. He needs someone to represent
dialog: him - someone who knows, him. He needs a

speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Einar...?
text: She finds him stretching a fresh canvas. He scarcely pauses.
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: I’ve a new dealer coming over later. I'd
dialog: like you to meet him.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I don’t want a new dealer. It doesn’t make
dialog: sense for me. I’m hardly working anyway.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: That might change.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I don’t think so. I’m happy helping you.
text: She goes to contradict, but he cuts her off:
speaker_heading: EINAR (cont'd)
dialog: No dealer. Thank you.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: It’s Hans Axgil.
text: Einar stops, astonished.
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: Dinner at La Dauphine at eight, then back
dialog: here to see the paintings.
text: Gerda’s out of the door, leaving Einar alone with the news.
scene_heading: INT. LA DAUPHINE RESTAURANT, NIGHT
text: An intimate place by the Pont Neuf. An empty chair at the
text: table. Gerda and Hans wait. Hans smokes.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: You know, Einar’s still stricken
dialog: with guilt about crashing your
text: kite.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: It was handmade, and I've had it
dialog: since I was four! I’m glad you
dialog: reminded me. I'’1l tease him about
dialog: that.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: No - it’s too cruel.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: If he ever gets here. Perhaps he
dialog: doesn’t want to see me?
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: No - no, it’s not that. We should order
dialog: without him.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Does he abandon you often?
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Of course not!
text: Hans is surprised at her strength of reaction.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: I was joking.
text: A waiter stands over them, amplifying the moment.
scene_heading: EXT. MARAIS STREET, NIGHT
text: Hans’ car rolls down the street.
scene_heading: INT. PARIS APARTMENT, NIGHT
text: Gerda takes out keys to open the apartment door...
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: I can come back another time, if you think
dialog: Einar would prefer it...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Really. He’s expecting you... and it will
dialog: do him good...
text: But they’re both a little apprehensive as they enter.
speaker_heading: GERDA (0.S.) (cont'd)
dialog: Einar...?
text: Gerda noses into the living room, Hans following. He spots a
text: painting - his face brightens -
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: I know this... the fjord at
dialog: Vejle... not far from our houses!
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Yes, Einar painted it just before we
dialog: left...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26/11/15
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She goes ahead of Hans, sees: Lili on the chaise, in
text: imitation of a pose in a painting on the wall behind her...
text: dangerously charged, her cheek flushed, eyes shining. A tray
text: with crystal glasses.
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: Lili...
text: Gerda reorientates herself in the proceedings, turns to Hans
text: who stands struggling to make sense of the scene before him:
speaker_heading: GERDA (CONT'D) (cont’d)
dialog: Hans, may I introduce Lili Wegener -
text: Einar’s cousin from home.
text: Now Lili’s up, her hand held out. Hans takes it...
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: You can’t imagine how happy I am.
text: He holds on to her hand, instinctively kind...
speaker_heading: LILI (cont'd)
dialog: We met before in Vejle, but you probably
dialog: don’t remember...
dialog: Hans is utterly wrongfooted...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Can I take your coat Hans?
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Of course...
text: He comes to, allows Gerda to relieve him of it. She takes it
text: away. Lili continues, frighteningly animated...
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: A digestif, Hans? It’s so chilly all of a
dialog: sudden. I feel the cold these days. I
dialog: don’t know why...
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Thank you.
text: Hans sits, but his eyes wander to the portraits that are now
text: ranged around the room. A kaleidoscope of Lili.
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: I’m so sorry Einar couldn’t be here. He
dialog: told me: in Vejle you were his great
dialog: friend. Both always plotting to getting
dialog: away!
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: That’s true...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26/11/15
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: Such a tedious place! He said you’d sit
text: and look out together, beyond the fjord..
dialog: to the sea... to the future.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Oh, we had big dreams...
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: And you were the only one who let him paint
dialog: in peace, who told him it was alright to be
dialog: a painter.
text: Gerda returns to the room. Hans searches Lili’s face for the
text: remains of his old friend Einar.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: He... used to sketch my portrait. Take a
dialog: stone and draw me on the rocks at the side
dialog: of the road.
text: Gerda turns to Hans:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I didn’t know that.
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: Oh yes.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Would you like to see more of Einar’s
dialog: work...?
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: Do we have any?
text: Gerda’s surprised, unsettled by the question.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Yes, of course, Lili...
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: Oh, but couldn’t we see it another time? I
dialog: so want to hear more from Hans... Hans,
dialog: are you married?
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: Why not?
text: Gerda flinches, but:
speaker_heading: LILI (cont'd)
dialog: He doesn’t mind, do you...?
text: Gerda looks helpless. Hans takes over:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26/11/15
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: I've... been on my own a long time now.
dialog: I’m too set in my ways.
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: I think marriage is the single thing we
dialog: should all hope for in life.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Really?
text: Lili looks utterly buoyant...
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: It creates someone else, more than just the
dialog: two of you. It would be terrible never to
dialog: know that...
text: Her expression crumbles... Hans looks to Gerda...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Lili...
dialog: Lili’s dissolving...
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: Excuse me.
text: She hurries out towards the bedroom, clearly in distress.
text: Hans struggles to comprehend the situation...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: You... you ought to go...
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: No - let me help...
text: She turns, holds Hans’ hands... the intimacy, intensity of
dialog: connection surprises him:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Please - please - I’m sorry...
text: He resigns himself to leaving... as he reaches the door:
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Goodnight Lili...
speaker_heading: LILI (0.S.)
dialog: Goodnight...
text: Hans lets himself out.
text: In the bedroom, Gerda, still shocked, looks at Lili -
text: bewildered, afraid, head hanging.
speaker_heading: LILI (cont'd)
dialog: I don’t think he noticed anything, do you?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26/11/15

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I don’t know...
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: No, I think I got out just in time.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Sleep now. We’1ll talk more tomorrow.
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: Can I borrow a nightdress?
text: Gerda’s shocked.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: No... we’ve never done that. Lili’s never
dialog: spent the night...
dialog: Einar confesses:
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: It doesn’t matter what I wear. When I
dialog: dream, they’re Lili’s dreams...
text: Gerda struggles to accommodate this, very reluctant... but
text: she gives in, nods. What else can she do?
scene_heading: INT. PARIS APARTMENT, BEDROOM, LATER
text: Gerda in bed. Lili’s sleeping head on the pillow next to
text: her, where Einar’s once was. Gerda turns out the light.
scene_heading: INT. PARIS APARTMENT, BEDROOM, DAY
text: Gerda arrives to find Lili in a bright dress with matching
text: scarf. Shopping bags everywhere. Slight tension in the air.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: A new dress...
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: And this. Do you like it?
text: She hands Gerda a bright scarf...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Yes. It’s perfect for you...
text: Gerda hands it back.
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: We're actually a little short of money at
dialog: the moment.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: I know, but now I’m back, I can sit

dialog: worked well before, Gerda, didn’t
dialog: it...?
text: Lili and Gerda take each other in, on a new footing...
scene_heading: INT. PARIS APARTMENT, STUDIO, DAY - MONTAGE
text: Gerda paints Lili who has found a new stillness. A more
text: serious spirit beneath the translucent skin. A sense of her
text: growing into herself.
text: We see on the wall now a number of double portraits, telling
text: the story of a developing negotiation - Gerda and Lili
text: depicted together, with a sense of close friendship or a
text: wistful attempt at coupledom.
text: Now Gerda paints with Lili advising... The two
text: collaborating, a sense of shared vision.
text: And throughout, we see Lili fully imagined as a woman, and an
text: increasingly idealised one - unrealistically lovely...
scene_heading: INT. ETIENNE DUFOUR GALLERY, RAINY NIGHT, ONE MONTH LATER
text: Another show of ‘Lili’ paintings. A lot of the paintings of
text: the two as a couple, but Gerda is here alone. She feels it.
text: She works the room, determined, then sees Hans, across the
text: crowd. Misses a beat. They make their way toward one
text: another. An awkward social kiss. Gerda’s unusually brittle.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: It’s a good crowd.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: She's a popular girl. Thank you for
dialog: coming.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Thank you for asking me. I thought you'd
dialog: forgotten all about me.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: We've been busy.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Is Einar here?
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Einar hates this kind of thing.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: That’s a shame. For you, I mean.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I don’t mind.
text: Hans wonders about this... lets it go.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Is he well...?
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: He’s excited. We have an old friend coming
dialog: to town: Ulla Fonsmarck, the dancer. Do
dialog: you know her?
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: I don’t think so. Could I take you to
dialog: dinner? To celebrate? Someone ought to.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: No. Thank you.
text: Hans absorbs this, regroups.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Gerda, have I offended you?
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Gerda...
text: He rests his hand on her arm, pressing for some honesty...
text: Gerda’s cornered, the heat of the room, the nearness of Hans.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I am still Einar’s wife.
text: She brushes past him, into the crowd. A MAN’S VOICE calls:
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Hans!
text: Hans’ social mask slips quickly back into place.
text: Later: CLOSE ANGLE on Gerda, watching as a flirtatious woman
text: WHISPERS something in Hans’ ear. His eyes widen, he LAUGHS.
text: Gerda looks away. Quickly sets down her drink and moves
text: through the crowd toward the door...
text: A GALLERY EMPLOYEE frets as Gerda pulls on her coat.
scene_heading: GALLERY EMPLOYEE
dialog: At least take an umbrella...
speaker_heading: GERDA

scene_heading: INT. PARIS APARTMENT, KITCHEN, NIGHT
text: Gerda lets herself in, breathless. Lili’s just arranging a
text: supper table, is surprised to see Gerda home so early...
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: Gerda...? Oh - you’re wet through.
text: Gerda seems angry. Lili tries to stay buoyant...
speaker_heading: LILI (cont'd)
dialog: Did it go well...? Tell me - how
dialog: was it?
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: You'd know if you’d been there.
text: Lili falters, then points to the table... set with flowers...
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: I’ve made us a supper...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: You should have come.
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: A little sort of celebration...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: This is not how it goes! We do
dialog: these things together!
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: That's you and Einar.
text: Gerda’s pent-up frustration begins to boil over...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Stop playing that stupid, stupid

speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: Don’t you say this is a game!
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: You should have been there!
speaker_heading: LILI

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Not everything’s about you!

speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: I need to see Einar.
text: Lili flinches, shakes her head, touches Gerda, tender.
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: Let me help...
text: Gerda cuts her off sharply, desperation building:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I need my husband. Just get him!
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: I can't...
text: Lili’s eyes cloud. Gerda moderates, already losing hope...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I want to talk to my husband. I want to
dialog: hold my husband. I need him. Can you get
dialog: him? Can you at least try?
text: Lili’s pained by the request. Her eyes plead, but Gerda’s
text: desperate, won’t give up. Finally Lili shakes her head,
text: desperately sorry. Gerda turns on her heel. The front door
text: BANGS as she heads off into the night, leaving Lili alone and
text: deeply sad.
scene_heading: EXT. JARDINS DE LUXEMBOURG
text: Gerda sits in the dark, watching the rain on the pond.
scene_heading: EXT. HANS AXGIL’S APARTMENT, NIGHT

speaker_heading: HANS

speaker_heading: HANS (cont'd)

speaker_heading: HANS

scene_heading: INT. PARIS APARTMENT, BEDROOM, NIGHT
text: Lili transitioning to Einar. It happens awkwardly, and when
text: Einar looks in the mirror, he’s baffled by his reflection.
scene_heading: I/E. HANS’ CAR/RAINY STREETS, NIGHT
text: Hans drives an exhausted Gerda, pulls up outside their
dialog: building.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Will you be alright?
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I'm always alright.
text: He reaches for her hand. Gerda stiffens.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: For God’s sake. Take some kindness where
dialog: you can.
text: He keeps hold of her hand. Gerda feels the warmth of him.
text: Her eyes fill.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Einar always comes back in the end. He
dialog: always has...
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Maybe this time... he just can’t.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: Gerda shakes her head, gently rejecting Hans.
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: I’ve never not finished a painting, I don’t

dialog: 26/11/15
dialog: 60.
scene_heading: INT. PARIS APARTMENT, BEDROOM, NIGHT
text: Gerda appears in the doorway. Sees Einar sitting in the
text: chair by the bed. She’s struck by how vulnerable he looks.
text: He looks up, and with genuine regret:
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI
dialog: I don’t think I can give you what you
dialog: want...
text: He looks away, ashamed. It’s unbearable. Gerda approaches
text: him. He looks like Lili dressed as Einar.
speaker_heading: EINAR/LILI (cont'd)
dialog: I don’t know how long we can go on like
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: No.
text: She pushes in beside him. Einar/Lili lies in Gerda’s lap.

scene_heading: EXT. OPERA GARNIER, PARIS, TWO WEEKS LATER, NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. OPERA GARNIER, STAGE, NEXT DAY
text: Einar watches a group of dancers rehearse on stage. Sitting
text: in the stalls, Gerda and Ulla are talking, as Ulla unbinds
text: her feet. We see callouses over the knuckles of her toes,
text: toenails broken and sore. She’s used to this.
speaker_heading: ULLA
dialog: He needs to see someone.
text: Gerda checks Einar’s well out of earshot.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: You know what happened with Hexler.
speaker_heading: ULLA
dialog: But he’s so thin, Gerda...? There’s
dialog: something wrong with him.
text: Gerda looks across at Einar.
speaker_heading: GERDA

text: Gerda’s surprised.
speaker_heading: ULLA (cont'd)
dialog: He’s often in Paris.
text: Before Gerda can reply, Ulla is writing a name on a card -
speaker_heading: ULLA (cont'd)
dialog: Just talk to him? It couldn’t hurt, could
dialog: it?
text: - “Prof. Kurt Warnekros”. She gives the card to Gerda. Gerda
text: looks up at Einar. Finds him looking back, plainly exhausted.
scene_heading: INT. PARIS APARTMENT, MORNING
text: Gerda has made coffee. Einar comes in, dressed and with some

speaker_heading: GERDA

speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)

speaker_heading: EINAR

speaker_heading: GERDA

dialog: Scientific Study of Sexual Immorality...
scene_heading: EXT. PARK, LATER
text: Einar makes his way through the park. He looks bizarre in

text: of rough-looking younger men. One HISSES under his breath:
speaker_heading: YOUNGER MAN
dialog: Lesbian...
text: Einar looks round, amazed, almost amused at the mistake...
text: when the men recognise that Einar is - in fact - a man, they
text: LAUGH, shocked. Einar keeps walking, conscious of the men
text: shadowing him, making silly obscene noises and comments.
text: Einar presses on, anger and anxiety building as the men
text: pursue. Now the men pull level with him, jostle, one moving
text: ahead and rubbing his crotch.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER MAN (cont'd)
dialog: You speak English? Are you a boy...
speaker_heading: YOUNGER MAN 2
dialog: Or a girl...?
text: The first Young Man leers and LAUGHS and then we suddenly see

speaker_heading: HANS

speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Well I was different.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: It didn’t take much to be different in

speaker_heading: HANS

speaker_heading: EINAR

speaker_heading: EINAR

speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Did a doctor say that?
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I’m sorry, I know we agreed no more... but
dialog: look at me.
text: She does - carefully, seeing Lili, just below the surface.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: You’re not insane.
text: Einar’s grateful. Gerda fights emotion...
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: Did I do this to you?
dialog: Einar doesn’t understand...
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: What...?
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Sometimes I think if it hadn’t been for the
dialog: paintings...
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Oh no... no, no. You helped bring Lili to
dialog: life, but she was always... she was
dialog: waiting...
speaker_heading: GERDA

speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I don’t know what to do. The doctors can’t

speaker_heading: WARNEKROS
dialog: So what do you think would explain what

speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Professor Warnekros... the fact is... I

speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: And I believe it too.
text: Einar looks to Gerda, grateful to hear her say this out loud.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: You probably think I’m insane. That we
dialog: both are...
text: Warnekros smiles. He lights a cigarette, taking his time.
speaker_heading: WARNEKROS
dialog: Well, there are people who think that I’m
dialog: insane. But I think you’re probably right.
text: Einar’s amazed. Warnekros breathes, begins:
speaker_heading: WARNEKROS (cont'd)
dialog: I’ve met another man like you.
text: Einar grasps Gerda’s hand, filled with hope...
speaker_heading: WARNEKROS (cont'd)
dialog: I pursued his case - against the
dialog: wishes of my colleagues, of course.
text: Warnekros considers a moment, then:
speaker_heading: WARNEKROS (cont'd)
dialog: I told him I could operate. To make
text: him fully a woman.
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: Is that really possible?
text: Einar and Gerda struggle to take in the idea.

speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: I wouldn’t do that.
text: Warnekros manages a grim laugh. Sounds a warning -—
speaker_heading: WARNEKROS
dialog: Perhaps he was the smart one. The surgery
dialog: has never been attempted before.
text: Gerda tries to get a grip on things:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Professor Warnekros, what is this
dialog: surgery...?
speaker_heading: WARNEKROS
dialog: Two operations... The first to
dialog: remove the male parts entirely.
dialog: The second - once you were strong
dialog: again - to construct a vagina.
text: Gerda looks to Einar - Einar’s rapt.
speaker_heading: WARNEKROS (cont'd)
text: An irreversible change, and a high
dialog: risk of failure, of infection,

speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: It’s too dangerous...
speaker_heading: EINAR
dialog: It’s my only hope.

speaker_heading: WARNEKROS

speaker_heading: GERDA

speaker_heading: EINAR

speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Here, take this...

text: The air fills with steam and NOISE. Gerda raises her hand to

text: fights tears as he moves off... Gerda runs alongside a

speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I’ll do that. I’m here now. Don’t worry,

speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: You’re not strong enough...
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: Professor Warnekros thinks I am...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Warnekros...? He hasn’t seen you.
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: I’ve made up my mind.
text: Gerda shakes her head, disbelief...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: It could kill you.
speaker_heading: LILI (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m going on Friday. Will you come
dialog: with me?
text: Gerda’s mind races to absorb the announcement...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I won’t help you to hurt yourself.
text: Lili bites down on it:
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: Gerda, will you come...?
scene_heading: INT. WARNEKROS’S CLINIC, LILI’S ROOM, RAINY NIGHT
dialog: 82.
text: Lili’s sitting up in bed, Gerda’s bright scarf around her
text: shoulders. Warnekros holds Lili’s wrist, checks the pulse.
speaker_heading: WARNEKROS
dialog: This will be harder than the last
dialog: operation? You understand that.
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: Yes I do.
text: A note of warning.
speaker_heading: WARNEKROS
text: It’s complex surgery.
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: And I‘1l sleep all the way through

speaker_heading: WARNEKROS
dialog: Yes you will, but...
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: You’1l be there when I wake up.
dialog: Lili half-jokes:
speaker_heading: LILI (cont'd)
dialog: I want a husband who looks just
dialog: like you!
dialog: Then, more thoughtful:
speaker_heading: LILI (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: And maybe a child. Like a real
dialog: woman.
text: Warnekros nods, kindly, but...
speaker_heading: WARNEKROS
text: One step at a time.
text: He gets up.
speaker_heading: WARNEKROS (cont'd)
dialog: Get some rest, now. Goodnight.
text: He smiles, goes to the door. Gerda’s waiting outside. They
text: cross in the doorway, polite but not warm.
text: Lili smiles, seeing Gerda. Gerda sits on the bed.
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: You're still angry with me.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I’m not angry with you, I’m worried
dialog: about you.
text: Gerda lays her head in Lili’s lap, tired with anxiety. Lili
text: strokes her hair. We feel the depth of love between them.
speaker_heading: LILI (CONT'D)
dialog: You heard my wish Gerda. When no
dialog: one else could hear me, you did.
text: Gerda’s eyes begin to fill. She collects herself.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Come. We both need our rest. I
dialog: can sleep in the chair, there...
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: Off to your little hotel.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I don’t mind...

text: But Lili insists.
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: Are there chocolates on the pillow?
speaker_heading: GERDA
text: Cigarette burns.
text: Lili laughs, kisses Gerda’s cheek.
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: Take this... There’s a chill in the
dialog: air.
text: Lili goes to hand over Gerda’s scarf, but:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: You keep it. For now.
text: Lili smiles, a little mischievous. But then a look between
text: them. Gerda’s afraid.
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: I’m going to be fine.
text: Gerda nods, determined to believe it.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: Sleep well.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Goodnight.
text: Lili is determinedly bright. Gerda takes her coat and bag.
text: The door closes behind her. A couple of moments pass and
text: then Lili begins to dissolve, releasing tears of overwhelming
dialog: fear and anticipation...
scene_heading: INT. DRESDEN HOTEL, RECEPTION, NIGHT
text: The CONCIERGE approaches, solicitous.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Room 9.
text: The concierge turns to get Gerda’s key. The sound of a
text: cocktail piano in an adjacent room serves to reinforce her
text: isolation. But then she sees reflected in the mirror - a
dialog: familiar face -
speaker_heading: GERDA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: Hans...?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26/11/15

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Gerda turns, barely holding herself together... he catches
text: her in a heavy, passionate embrace. A huge sense of relief,
dialog: reunion, trust.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: It’s alright.
text: Gerda nods, greatly comforted by his presence.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Everything will be alright.
text: Gerda hangs on to Hans, desperately wanting it to be true.
scene_heading: INT. WARNEKROS’S CLINIC, LILI’S ROOM, DAWN
text: A nurse helps a quietly determined Lili into a surgical gown.
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING THEATRE
text: Warnerkros, scrubbed in, serious, ready to begin.
speaker_heading: WARNEKROS
dialog: Good luck, everybody.
text: Lili anaesthetised. We stay on her face, hear voices, the
text: clank of instruments. Rain beginning... the sound of it
text: increasingly intense as the wind comes up too...
scene_heading: INT. WARNEKROS’S CLINIC, RECEPTION, NEXT MORNING
text: Morning light streams in, harsh, unforgiving. Hans holds the
text: door for Gerda. She’s barely inside when the Receptionist
text: jumps urgently to her feet.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Professor Warnekros would like a
dialog: word...
text: Gerda’s faces register anxiety. Hans gestures - he’s backing
text: off. He’ll wait. Gerda hurries away.
scene_heading: INT. WARNEKROS’S CLINIC, DRESDEN, MORNING
text: Warnekros and Gerda walk purposefully along the corridor -
speaker_heading: WARNEKROS
dialog: She lost a lot of blood. Now we’re
text: struggling to keep the fever down.
dialog: There’s a chance it will burn
dialog: itself out, but...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: They arrive at the doorway to Lili’s room. Warnekros shows *
text: Gerda in. Lili sleeps fitfully, slick with sweat. *
text: Warnekros’s clearly worried. Gerda’s astonished at how ill

speaker_heading: WARNEKROS (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: (deeply regretful)
dialog: I’m sorry... I have to be honest.
dialog: The prognosis is not...
text: He can’t finish, but Gerda barely hears him anyway...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Go away... thank you. Leave us *
dialog: alone.

scene_heading: INT. WARNEKROS’S CLINIC, DRESDEN, GARDEN, NIGHT
text: Heavy spots of rain begin to splash down. Most of the
text: hospital in darkness. A light glowing in one room.
scene_heading: INT. WARNEKROS’S CLINIC, DRESDEN, LILI’S ROOM, NIGHT
text: Gerda in the chair at Lili’s bedside, mopping her brow. The
text: rainstorm beating outside. A nurse enters with a jug of
text: water. Gerda nods, grateful.
scene_heading: INT. WARNEKROS’S CLINIC, DRESDEN, CORRIDOR, DAWN
text: A cleaner works her mop and bucket down the corridor. Hans
text: sleeps in a chair up ahead.
scene_heading: INT. WARNEKROS’S CLINIC, DRESDEN, LILI’S ROOM
text: Lili sleeping, calmer now. Her face translucent in the
text: morning light. Gerda sleeps in the chair beside her. Gerda
text: wakes, disoriented for a moment, then looks at Lili, sleeping
text: peacefully, clearly cooler now... Gerda feels her brow - no
text: heat there any more... Gerda’s relief is palpable. She
text: smooths Lili’s fringe, then gets up, opens the curtains -
text: wide - the sun just starting to show in the rain-washed sky.
text: She turns back to see Lili’s eyes open.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Lili...?

speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: I’m here... just lie still... It’s
dialog: alright...
text: Lili smiles through her medicated haze. She sees Hans hurry
dialog: in... thrilled to see her awake...
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Oh, Lili. How are you?
text: Her voice is faint, cracked. She takes in Hans and Gerda:
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: I am... entirely myself.
text: Hans laughs gently.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: I‘1l tell Warnekros she’s awake.
text: Hans goes. Gerda sits back beside Lili, fixes her hair.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: You know you had us worried...
text: Lili’s frail, otherworldly, but her eyes burn bright. She
text: looks to the window.
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: Can I go outside, Gerda? Into the
dialog: garden?
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: I think you should rest...
text: But Lili takes Gerda’s hand, a great sense of calm in her.
text: She looks at Gerda. Gerda still there, always there.
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: Please...
scene_heading: EXT. CLINIC GARDENS
text: Gerda wheels Lili out in a wheelchair, Hans holding the door
text: open for her to pass. A glance between him and Gerda, then
text: he leaves the women alone.
text: Gerda is settles herself in a chair beside Lili, rests her
text: hand on Lili’s arm. The birch trees in Spring leaf. A light
text: breeze makes them quiver. Lili’s breathing is shallow. We
dialog: feel the depth of love between the women, and the
dialog: precariousness of their situation.
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: You mustn’t worry about me any
dialog: more, Gerda.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: It’s an old habit. I’m slow to
dialog: change.
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: How have I ever deserved such love?
text: Gerda struggles to remain composed.
speaker_heading: LILI (cont'd)
dialog: I’m sorry you were frightened.
dialog: There’s nothing to be afraid of any
dialog: more.
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LILI
dialog: You know, last night, I had the
dialog: most beautiful dream... I dreamed I
dialog: was a baby in my mother’s arms...
dialog: and she looked down at me... and
dialog: called me Lili...
text: Gerda is amazed, deeply moved...
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: Lili...
text: Lili’s features arrange themselves into an expression of
text: perfect joy as she sinks back into something which Gerda
text: gradually sees is deeper than sleep...
speaker_heading: GERDA (cont'd)
dialog: Lili...
text: Gerda clutches the hand... No response... Smooths the
dialog: brow... still nothing...
speaker_heading: GERDA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: Lili...?
text: Gerda presses Lili’s hand against her cheek, overwhelmed with
text: grief. Lili looks blissfully happy. The dawn light grows
dialog: stronger in the garden...
scene_heading: INT/EXT. JUTLAND, DAWN, TWO WEEKS LATER
text: Hans’ car rolls into the bleak landscape. Hans and Gerda
text: inside. Gerda looks out - at a landscape she knows with
text: absolute intimacy, although she’s never been here before.
text: It’s all here... the imagery from Einar’s paintings, singing
text: with life... A wild stretch of rocky green under soft
text: northern light, a row of beautiful black-limbed trees, bent
text: over, but not broken, by the wind...
dialog: 26/11/15
dialog: 89.
scene_heading: EXT. CLIFFS OVERLOOKING KATTEGAT SEA, JUTLAND, MORNING
text: Hans tails Gerda. She battles the incredible gusts of salt
text: air, the bright scarf flying like a flag at her throat. She
text: pushes on, closer to the cliff edge... Finally she reaches
text: an amazing vantage point, is stunned by the view: a rectangle
text: of ferociously stormy sea, silver waves whipped by a wind
text: that stings, relentless. We hear the RUSTLE and PUNCH of the
text: weather going at her. Hans joins her. They stand there
text: looking out until they can hardly breathe any more.
text: Hans takes her armto steady her, but as she turns toward him
text: the wind rips up under the bright scarf, snatches it into the
text: air. Gerda GASPS - a moment of loss - but then, something
text: else... As Hans hurries to try and catch it -
speaker_heading: GERDA
dialog: No - leave it..! Leave it..
text: She pulls him back, watches it dance, tears of joy in her
dialog: eyes...
speaker_heading: GERDA (CONT’D)
dialog: Let it fly...
text: The scarf swoops up and dives down, curls and rolls, as free
text: as child... a girl at play. Gerda clutches her coat at her
text: breast, almost delirious at the beauty of it. Hans watches
text: with her - the absurdly joyous spectacle of it, a stunning
text: farewell. And as the scarf dances out from the cliff, out to
dialog: sea... into eternity...
