text: Then -- working fast -- he unscrews the end of the master
text: key. A specially-designed BUMPER KEY slides out.
text: Banning slips the mechanical-only key into the keyway.
text: Presses a button on the key which causes it to VIBRATE for a
dialog: few seconds.
text: EXTREME CLOSE-UP: Inside the lock, the mechanical motor in
text: the cylinder turns, lifting the locking element within --
text: bypassing the electronic portion of the lock and thwarting
text: audit logs -- and the lock RELEASES.
text: The access door OPENS -- and Banning’s eyes ZOOM to the LED
text: indicator light.
text: It remains dark. He exhales.
scene_heading: INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Banning drops into a sub-basement corridor. Cautiously moves
text: down the hallway.
text: He turns the corner and
speaker_heading: A VIDEO CAMERA
text: swings his way in a whir of servos.
text: Banning shrinks back. Moves quickly in the opposite
dialog: direction.
scene_heading: INT. PEOC - CONTINUOUS
text: Kang crosses to Secretary of Defense McMillan. She looks up,
text: eyes afraid.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: KANG
dialog: (without preamble)
dialog: Give me your Cerberus code.
text: McMillan blinks. Asher and Hoenig exchange a stunned look.
dialog: How the hell does Kang know about Cerberus?
speaker_heading: MCMILLAN
dialog: I -- I have no such code --
text: Kang opens the stainless steel briefcase. Inside the foam-
text: lined case is a large-gauge HYPODERMIC NEEDLE and several
scene_heading: GLASS VIALS.
text: McMillan’s face turns white.
speaker_heading: KANG
dialog: Think harder, Madame Secretary.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Banning turns the corner, peers down the next corridor.
text: It’s the scene of a MASSACRE. Dead Secret Service agents lie
dialog: everywhere.
text: Up ahead, the sound of distant VOICES.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS
text: Black-clad commandos surround the two SUVs crashed into the
text: main entrance hall. Cho barks orders in Korean.
text: Banning warily peers around the corner.
text: In the entrance hall, large MILITARY-STYLE CRATES are off-
text: loaded from the rear of the SUVs.
text: POV BANNING: He can’t quite make out what they are.
text: Cho issues more orders in Korean. The only word
text: distinguishable to Banning is one -- “Cerberus”.
text: Cho’s men load the crates into the freight elevator. The
text: elevator doors close, and the lift begins to rise.
text: Silently, Banning retreats.
dialog: 43.
scene_heading: INT. PEOC - CONTINUOUS
text: Kang pulls the hypodermic from its case.
text: Lim seizes McMillan from behind, holding her fast. The other
text: commandos level their MP-5s, cowing any would-be heroes.
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: What are you doing?!
text: Kang holds up one of the small vials.
speaker_heading: KANG
dialog: Fuante Shi. One of the world’s
dialog: most deadly orders of strychnine --
text: He fills the syringe with the vial’s contents.
speaker_heading: KANG (cont’d)
dialog: -- no known antidote --
text: McMillan struggles, but Lim tightens her iron grip. Kang
text: turns with the needle.
speaker_heading: KANG (cont’d)
dialog: One more chance. Your Cerberus
dialog: code.
text: McMillan glances desperately at Asher.
speaker_heading: KANG (cont’d)
dialog: He can’t help you.
text: Asher and McMillan exchange a look. McMillan turns back to
text: Kang, face firm with resolve.
speaker_heading: KANG (cont’d) There’s a
dialog: saying in Korea -- “Listening 100
dialog: times is not as good as seeing it
dialog: once.”
text: Kang INJECTS her straight in the carotid.
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: No!!!
text: McMillan JERKS VIOLENTLY in her chair. Her eyes ROLL WILDLY,
text: body THRASHING. The hostages react, horrified.
text: Finally, she goes still.
dialog: 44,
text: Not looking up, Kang methodically replaces the syringe in its
text: case as he calmly speaks.
speaker_heading: KANG
dialog: Do you cry when your Predators scorch
dialog: villages? When your “smart bombs”
dialog: kill innocents from 60 miles away?
text: Kang pushes a button on the control console. The door to the
text: PEOC LIVING QUARTERS -- adjacent to the main room -- slides
text: OPEN. We catch a glimpse inside -- a half-dozen cots,
text: kitchenette, supplies.
text: Foreign Minister Lee lies dead on the first cot.
text: Kang’s men drag McMillan’s body into the room -- and the door
speaker_heading: CLOSES.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Banning moves down the silent corridor. More dead bodies
dialog: down here.
text: He kneels beside a fallen agent, turns him over --
speaker_heading: IT’S ROMA
text: Banning blinks, recognition dawning.
text: He pulls the SHURIKEN from Roma’s forehead. Studies the
text: exotic weapon briefly, then pockets it.
text: Banning quickly searches Roma’s body. Already stripped of
dialog: all weapons and communications gear.
text: Gently, he closes Roma’s staring eyes.
text: Distant FOOTSTEPS. Banning spins, head cocked.
dialog: Someone’s coming.
text: Quickly, he ducks into the near doorway. As around the
dialog: corner --
scene_heading: A TWO-MAN PATROL
text: strides down the corridor. The commandos march forward,
text: footfalls echoing.
text: The larger commando suddenly stops, turning.
dialog: 45.
text: He bends over Roma’s body, fingers probing the open gash on
text: the man’s forehead...
text: The shuriken is gone.
text: The commandos both turn. Stare at the doorway through which
text: Banning just disappeared.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE BOWLING ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
text: The commandos burst inside. Flick on the lights.
text: Two gleaming polished lanes, Presidential SEAL painted on the
text: far wall. Silent pins standing like sentinels.
text: The killers scan the empty room, guns leveled, when
text: A BOWLING BALL
text: pops from the automatic ball return.
text: The ball ROLLS slowly around the return carousel. Comes to
text: rest against the rubber bumper with a thump.
text: The commandos approach warily when
speaker_heading: BANNING
text: leaps from the transom above. Swinging a 12-pounder like a
text: sledgehammer -- he CRUSHES one commando’s skull.
text: The second commando swings his weapon up. In a blur, Banning
text: KNOCKS the gun away. He and the commando go down --
text: viciously GRAPPLING across the floor -- a furious FLURRY OF
text: BLOWS. Banning drives his elbow up -- like a knife -- into
text: the COMMANDO’S THROAT. The commando falters, stunned.
text: Banning SPINS the commando against the ball rack -- grabs him
text: by the neck -- SLAMS his head into the stacked balls. Again
text: and again, body flooded with adrenaline and fear.
text: The commando’s body slides to the floor, dead.
text: Banning falls back, sucking air in great whooping gasps.
text: He methodically searches the bodies. Grabs an MP-5 and
text: wireless headset, clicks the unit on. Nothing but silence.
text: Banning looks up, mind racing.
dialog: 46.
scene_heading: INT. CRISIS ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Malik steps beside Trumbull. Inserts a USB device into the
text: computer console.
text: A DIGITAL HEAD SHOT of Kang is projected onto the wallscreen.
text: Bio-data scrolls below.
speaker_heading: MALIK
dialog: Yeonsak Kang. South Korean
dialog: national, born in the North,
dialog: birthdate unknown. Escaped across

speaker_heading: MALIK (cont'd)
dialog: Kang has served for the past six
dialog: years in Seoul’s diplomatic
dialog: protection corps, following two
dialog: tours in South Korea’s elite Black
dialog: Tiger counter-terror unit.
speaker_heading: TRUMBULL
dialog: So he knows what he’s doing --
text: Jacobs looks up.
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: And clearly will stop at nothing to
dialog: get it.
scene_heading: INT. OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: The Oval Office stands silent and empty.
text: The door slowly swings open and
speaker_heading: BANNING
text: slips inside.
text: He crosses to the presidential desk, rests his MP-5 on the
text: blotter. A bank of PHONES sit mutely. Banning grabs the
text: receivers, one after another.
text: No dial tones. All dead.
dialog: 47.
text: He scans the desktop. Scattered papers, a Montblanc pen,
dialog: ivory-handled letter opener --
scene_heading: THE PRESIDENT’S BLACKBERRY
text: Banning grabs it. Punches 9-1-1.
text: All lines are JAMMED. He can’t get through.
text: Banning scowls, looks up.
text: And his eyes go wide, as he’s utterly shocked to see
speaker_heading: CONNOR
text: standing silently in the Oval Office doorway.
speaker_heading: CONNOR
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: What are you doing here?
text: Banning opens his mouth to speak when
speaker_heading: A COMMANDO
text: steps through the side door.
text: Connor spins and runs.
text: Banning’s eyes jerk to his weapon. He’1ll never make it. The
text: commando raises his gun barrel and
speaker_heading: BANNING
text: grabs the letter opener. Flings it across the room.
text: The blade spears the commando in the jugular. He falls, hand
text: clutching his throat.
text: Banning grabs the MP-5. Races after Connor.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Connor sprints down the hall. Banning gives chase. The boy
text: disappears through an inner office doorway.
text: Banning rushes up. Grabs the doorknob. Locked.
text: He KICKS the door down.
dialog: 48.
scene_heading: INT. INNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Banning bursts inside, eyes searching the small room. Desk,
text: bookshelves, low filing cabinets.
dialog: Connor is... gone.
text: But that’s impossible. Banning stares, confused.
text: He pulls out Asher’s BlackBerry. Scrolls down the listings.
dialog: Finds the one he wants...
dialog: National Military Command Center.
text: He dials. Lines still jammed. Dials again...
scene_heading: INT. CRISIS ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Trumbull presides over the somber room.
speaker_heading: TRUMBULL
dialog: What if this Kang is just some out-
dialog: of-control rogue?
speaker_heading: GALDARRES
dialog: And if he’s not? He’s providing a
dialog: hostile regime with the window of
dialog: opportunity they’ve been seeking
dialog: for the past sixty years --
text: His eyes flicker around the table.
speaker_heading: GALDARRES (cont’d) What
dialog: will become of America’s
dialog: credibility as a superpower, if we
dialog: allow our ally to be overrun?
text: Jacobs counters, angry.
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: How will we be seen in the eyes of
dialog: the world -- if we let our
dialog: President be killed in his own
dialog: goddamn house?!
text: Jacobs’ AIDE rushes up, whispers urgently in her ear.
dialog: 49,
speaker_heading: JACOBS (cont’d)
dialog: (spins, to Trumbull)
dialog: We have contact from inside the
dialog: White House -- trace confirms it’s

text: Feedback whine from the overhead speakers.
speaker_heading: TRUMBULL (cont’d)

speaker_heading: BANNING
dialog: Yeah --
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: This is Director Jacobs --
speaker_heading: BANNING
dialog: Where’s POTUS?
speaker_heading: JACOBS
text: As of 1020 hours, the Fox Den.
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: The President and National Security
dialog: team are being held by a North
dialog: Korean named Kang. They’ve already
dialog: killed Foreign Minister --
text: Trumbull snaps off the intercom.
speaker_heading: TRUMBULL
dialog: What’re you doing?
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: He’s a Special Agent --
speaker_heading: TRUMBULL
dialog: Who should’ve been shitcanned two
dialog: years ago --
text: Jacobs and Trumbull lock eyes.
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: He got in -- didn’t he?

speaker_heading: KANG (0.S.)

scene_heading: INT. INNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: BANNING
dialog: What do they want?
speaker_heading: INTERCUTTING
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: The Seventh Fleet pulled -- by 2200
dialog: hours.
speaker_heading: BANNING (realizing
dialog: what that
dialog: means)
dialog: You can’t do that --
speaker_heading: TRUMBULL
dialog: Spare us the geopolitical advice,
dialog: Agent --
speaker_heading: BANNING
dialog: (cuts him off)
dialog: What’s Cerberus?
text: This stops Trumbull cold. The others share a look.
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: What -- how did you -- ?
speaker_heading: TRUMBULL
dialog: -- that’s classified --
speaker_heading: BANNING
dialog: Kang knows.
text: Their faces darken. Beat. Trumbull reluctantly nods to
dialog: Jacobs.
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: It’s a fail-safe protocol. Alpha
dialog: Top Secret. But it has no
dialog: offensive capability...
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: BANNING
dialog: What kind of fail-safe?
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: Against inadvertent nuclear launch.
dialog: The three Cerberus codes, when
dialog: activated, control the self-
dialog: destruct mechanisms within our
dialog: ICBMs.
speaker_heading: GALDARRES
dialog: (realization dawning)
dialog: With those codes -- Kang could
dialog: destroy every long-range nuke we
text: fire. With the Seventh Fleet
dialog: pulled, South Korea would be
text: defenseless.
speaker_heading: MALIK
dialog: And so would we.
text: Their faces are tense.
speaker_heading: BANNING
dialog: So change the codes --
speaker_heading: GALDARRES
dialog: No --
speaker_heading: BANNING
dialog: What do you mean, no --
speaker_heading: MALIK
dialog: He means we can’t.
dialog: (beat)
text: Cerberus is a self-contained
dialog: total-isolation system. It’s
dialog: unidirectional -- data only goes
dialog: out, not in. The only way to
dialog: change the codes is to physically
dialog: do so on the computer itself.
speaker_heading: BANNING
dialog: Where’s the computer?
speaker_heading: MALIK
dialog: The PEOC.
text: The enormity of the situation strikes home for them all.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: BANNING
dialog: The three codes -- who has them?
scene_heading: INT. PEOC - CONTINUOUS
text: Kang approaches Admiral Hoenig with his hypodermic needle.
text: Loads in a fresh vial.
speaker_heading: KANG
dialog: Admiral. Your Cerberus code.
speaker_heading: HOENIG
dialog: You don’t know what you’re doing --
speaker_heading: KANG
dialog: Don’t I?
text: Kang looms over Hoenig, eyes black as anthracite.
speaker_heading: KANG (cont’d)
dialog: I’m providing my nation with the

dialog: destiny.
text: Hoenig’s glance flickers to the syringe.
speaker_heading: HOENIG
dialog: You’re not a patriot.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You’re a psychopath --
speaker_heading: KANG
dialog: I believe Seneca said it best --
dialog: “There is no genius without a touch
dialog: of madness.”
text: Kang places the point of the needle against Hoenig’s carotid.
speaker_heading: KANG (cont’d)
dialog: Your code, Admiral.
text: Kang’s finger tenses on the plunger. A beat of incredible
dialog: tension.
speaker_heading: HOENIG
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: E-M-six... zero-eight... two-five.
text: Kang lowers the syringe.
dialog: 54.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - WHITE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: INT. INNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: And if you’re wrong?
text: Malik steps forward.
speaker_heading: MALIK
dialog: We have no choice.

text: All eyes turn to Trumbull. Beat.
speaker_heading: TRUMBULL

text: Banning and old George share a look. Warriors across time.
text: A barrage of machine gun slugs OBLITERATES the painting.
dialog: Time to move.
text: Banning dives behind a Louis XIV couch. A hail of bullets

text: Banning hugs the floor -- bullets WHINING -- crawls quickly
text: toward the East Room when
speaker_heading: A COMMANDO
text: steps into the doorway.
text: Banning rolls as the commando fires, slugs STITCHING across

speaker_heading: BANNING (cont’ d)

speaker_heading: SANDMAN

speaker_heading: BANNING
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: SANDMAN

text: The titanium door slowly SWINGS OPEN.
dialog: 87.
text: SWIRLING HAZE from smoke grenades drifts in. We can’t see a
dialog: thing.
text: Kang’s men train their weapons on the bunker entrance. Ready

text: Seconds pass, seeming like hours.
dialog: When suddenly
speaker_heading: A LASER BEAM
text: bounces through the smoky haze.
speaker_heading: SANDMAN (0.S.)
dialog: (neutral, robotic)
dialog: Lower your weapons -—

speaker_heading: SANDMAN
dialog: Come with me, sir -- I’m getting
dialog: you out of here --
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: Not without the others.
text: Sandman’s eyes imperceptibly flicker -- instantly taking in

speaker_heading: SANDMAN
dialog: Those aren’t my orders.

speaker_heading: BANNING
dialog: (to Sandman)
dialog: Take your weapon off the President.
text: Sandman doesn’t move. Laser dot steady on Asher. He knows
text: Kang needs Asher alive -- needs Asher’s code.
dialog: Would Sandman actually kill his own President in order to
dialog: protect Cerberus?
text: Kang and Sandman LOCK EYES. Both frozen like statues,
text: neither moving a muscle.
text: CLOSE ON SANDMAN: Face a stony mask, ice-blue eyes staring
dialog: back at Kang, when...
dialog: 89.
dialog: ...the slightest twitch.
speaker_heading: BANNING (cont’ d)
dialog: No!
text: Kang FIRES, hitting Sandman -- Banning SIMULTANEOUSLY KNOCKS
text: SANDMAN’S BARREL UPWARD as the XM8 unloads on FULL AUTO --
text: bullets BLASTING the wall just above Asher’s head --
text: Pak and the other commandos OPEN FIRE. The whole room ERUPTS
text: IN GUNFIRE, hostages DIVING FOR COVER.
text: Banning spins, FIRING -- CUTS ONE OF THE COMMANDOS IN HALF.
text: Sandman is caught in the CROSSFIRE, BODY JERKING FROM THE
text: HITS. He sprays on FULL AUTOMATIC -- taking out half the
text: commandos in the room -- refusing to go down --
text: Asher PROTECTIVELY SHIELDS Connor with his body. Banning is
text: CUT OFF from them. He LUNGES for the President -- but Pak
text: DRIVES HIM BACK with a WITHERING burst of fire.
text: Sandman’s RIDDLED BODY falls to the ground, dead.
text: The RELENTLESS GUNFIRE explodes around Banning. No choice.
text: He rolls -- FIRING -- DIVES through the bunker door, BULLETS

text: ducks back.
dialog: 90.

scene_heading: INT. PEOC - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: MCMILLAN
dialog: Mr. President -- I’m sorry --
text: Asher gapes, dumbstruck.
speaker_heading: KANG
dialog: I lied -- there is an antidote --
dialog: if administered in time --

text: Foreign Minister Lee lies lifeless on the first cot. Vice

speaker_heading: MCMILLAN (horrified,
dialog: helpless)
dialog: -- I thought -- Nate was killed

speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE

text: Cerberus has been deactivated.
text: Banning’s eyes flick to the open stairwell in the floor.
text: Without hesitation, he races across the bunker. Vaults down
dialog: the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. S.L.E.D. CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Kang initializes the launch sequence. Turns to Asher and
text: draws his tanto (tactical Special Forces knife). Asher’s
text: eyes go wide. The blade FLASHES DOWN --
text: -- and CUTS Asher’s zipcuffs. Kang presses the President’s
text: palm to the translucent ID SQUARE on the car’s control panel.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE
dialog: Welcome, Mr. President.
text: The SLED’s engines ROAR TO LIFE.
text: Banning races across the launch platform. Sprints after the
dialog: escape car and
speaker_heading: LEAPS
text: onto the rear of the SLED. Just as the escape car ROCKETS
text: down the track.
text: The SLED accelerates shockingly fast. SLAMS down the rails.
scene_heading: INT. CRISIS ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Trumbull scoops up the flashing hotline phone.
speaker_heading: TRUMBULL
text: NORAD confirms. Cerberus has been
dialog: shut down.
dialog: Everyone can breathe again.
scene_heading: INT. S.L.E.D. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
text: The escape car SCREAMS forward, tracks a blur.
text: Somehow, Banning holds on.
dialog: 107.
text: He ducks his head into the slipstream. And sees --
scene_heading: THE TRACK JUST ENDS
text: Up ahead, nothing but a wall of SOLID EARTH.
text: The car SLAMS FORWARD at 80 MPH. Banning ducks down, sucking
text: air in short, rapid breaths.
scene_heading: INT. S.L.E.D. CAR (MOVING FAST) - CONTINUOUS
text: Through the windscreen, the earthen wall rushes up. No time
dialog: to stop.
text: Asher glares at Kang. Kang stares back, face impassive.
text: He’s daring him.
text: The black wall LOOMS like death itself. Asher glances one
dialog: last time at Connor and then --
speaker_heading: REACHES OUT
text: AND PRESSES his palm to the control panel ID square.
text: The earthen wall EXPLODES.
scene_heading: EXT. TIDAL BASIN - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS
text: Explosive bolts DETONATE, whole wall DISINTEGRATING into
dialog: nothingness.
text: The SLED rockets through the swirling debris, into the depths
text: of the Tidal Basin. An AVALANCHE OF WATER engulfs Banning.
text: The SLED zips underwater like a streaking torpedo.
text: A homing beacon suddenly begins to DRONE. The SLED slowly
text: rises, Banning holding on.
text: The escape car continues to ascend. Banning’s face contorts.
dialog: Been down too long. Need air.
text: His torso writhes, burning lungs screaming...
text: Banning lets go. He floats away, body disappearing into the
text: murky depths.
dialog: 108.
text: The SLED keeps rising.
scene_heading: INT. SEWER SUBSTATION - CONTINUOUS
text: The escape car surfaces, docking at an underground sewer
dialog: substation.
text: The main hatch OPENS.
text: Kang prods Asher and Connor from the car with his gun. Onto
text: the docking platform.
text: Without warning -- Kang spins -- PISTOL WHIPS Asher across
text: the face. The President drops to his knees.
speaker_heading: CONNOR
dialog: Dad!
text: Kang looms over Asher.
speaker_heading: KANG
dialog: Goodbye, Mr. President --
text: Without ceremony, Kang points the pistol in Asher’s face when
speaker_heading: BANNING
text: SUDDENLY DIVES from the shadows -- TACKLING KANG to the
text: ground. The pistol spins from Kang’s hand, across the steel
dialog: platform.
text: Kang spins away. The two men face each other, circling.
text: Kang draws his tanto.
text: Cat-quick -- Kang leaps forward -- razor-sharp blade flashing.
text: A Ninjutsu master. The blade SLICES Banning’s arm.
text: Asher grabs the FLARE GUN from the SLED. Aims at the two
text: spinning, circling forms. No clear shot.
speaker_heading: BANNING
dialog: (yells to Asher)
dialog: Run!
text: Asher hesitates.
speaker_heading: BANNING (cont'd)
dialog: -- take Connor -- go!
text: Asher grabs Connor’s hand. They race for the ladder.
dialog: 109.
text: Kang LUNGES -- and Banning grabs his knife hand. They SMASH
text: into the wall -- furiously grappling. Kang DRIVES a fist
text: into Banning’s kidney. Banning grunts, nearly fainting.
text: Kang leaps back. Connects with a SPIN KICK to Banning’s
text: head. Banning FALLS. Kang LEAPS onto Banning, straddling
text: him. Banning BLOCKS Kang’s fatal knife thrust -- but the
text: blade bears down -- directly over Banning’s heart --
text: The two lock in a DEATH EMBRACE, but Kang has the advantage.
text: He BEARS DOWN harder. Banning struggles beneath him.
text: Slowly -- inexorably -- the blade ARCS DOWN. The tip PIERCES
text: Banning’s skin, drawing blood...
text: When from the wall above, a telltale HISS.
text: With the last of his strength, Banning pushes Kang’s face up.
text: Directly in line with the recessed venting pipe --
text: A SCALDING JET OF STEAM
text: EXPLODES from the wall.
text: The force of the BLAST blows Kang off Banning. The tanto
text: goes spinning into the water. Kang staggers back, grimacing
text: with rage and pain. He scrambles for his pistol across the
dialog: platform.
text: Banning LEAPS up, races for the substation ladder.
text: Kang GRABS the pistol, whirls. FIRES wildly after Banning.
text: Banning climbs the ladder, bullets WHINING.
scene_heading: EXT. TIDAL BASIN - CONTINUOUS
text: An isolated, cordoned area on the banks of the Tidal Basin.
text: Yellow caution tape flutters.
text: Asher and Connor climb from the access manhole.
text: Banning scrambles from the manhole after them. Runs to the
text: President and Connor, prods them forward.
speaker_heading: BANNING
dialog: Come on!
text: Connor looks back. And SCREAMS.
dialog: 110.
text: Banning whirls and
speaker_heading: KANG
text: climbs from the manhole. He shambles forward, eyes burning.
text: Like some demonic specter from Hell.
text: Kang turns, and we see...
text: THE LEFT SIDE OF HIS FACE
text: is blistered BLACK. Ear, skin, hair, all gone.
text: Asher raises the flare gun. Kang levels his own pistol at
dialog: Connor.
speaker_heading: KANG
dialog: (to Asher)
dialog: Don’t be stupid --
text: Asher lowers the flare. Drops it in the grass.
text: Banning’s eyes glance to the weapon.
dialog: He just might make it.
text: Banning stops himself. Looks from Asher to Kang.
text: Kang crosses the recently-erected fireworks platform, moving
dialog: in for the kill.
speaker_heading: KANG (cont’d)
dialog: Annyong-hi kaseyo, Mr. President --
text: Kang levels his weapon at Asher.
speaker_heading: BANNING
dialog: No!
text: Kang pulls the trigger. Banning dives in front of Asher --
text: TAKING THE BULLET
text: Saving the President’s life.
text: And giving Asher one crucial second.
text: To grab the flare gun from the grass.
text: Asher swings the weapon up, aiming wildly...
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: HE FIRES
text: The flare misses.
text: The projectile falls short, SIZZLING at Kang’s feet. Kang
text: looks up.
text: And with that horrific ghastly face... he smiles. A look of
dialog: pure evil.
text: Kang raises his weapon to kill the President.
text: When somewhere, in the dark recesses of his diabolical brain,
text: something suddenly clicks.
text: Kang’s eyes flicker for the briefest second --
scene_heading: THE FLARE EXPLODES
text: The whole fireworks platform upon which Kang stands literally
text: ERUPTS. Detonating in a GIGANTIC FIREBALL.
text: Kang just isn’t there anymore.
text: The soaring fireworks rocket skyward, BOOMING. Vaporizing
text: Kang into a million pieces.
text: Asher helps Banning to his feet. Checks his wound.
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: You okay?
text: Banning nods, wincing.
text: The two share a long look. A whirlwind of emotions pass
dialog: between them.
speaker_heading: ASHER (cont’d)
dialog: Thank you --
text: Asher pulls his son close, grateful.
text: Banning’s eyes fill with sweet redemption.
speaker_heading: VOICES (O.S.)
dialog: Over here!
text: Army Rangers converge on Banning and the President from
text: across the Mall.
dialog: 112.
scene_heading: INT. CRISIS ROOM - SHORTLY LATER
text: On the wallscreen, LIVE MEDIA COVERAGE of the continuing
text: Korean crisis. Banner headlines read: “WAR APPEARS IMMINENT”.
text: VIDEO FOOTAGE: Massed TANKS AND ARTILLERY prepare to roll
text: across the border. MOTORIZED INFANTRY itching to attack.
text: The gathered all stare at the wallscreen, faces filled with
dialog: apprehension, when...
speaker_heading: ASHER
text: suddenly bursts into the room, flanked by Banning and Connor.
text: Everyone leaps to their feet, astounded.
dialog: The President is alive!
speaker_heading: TRUMBULL
dialog: Mr. President, thank God!
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: Get Pyongyang on the line -- now.
text: Everyone waits, expectant. The wallscreen flickers.
text: The NORTH KOREAN PREMIER appears on the screen.
text: Asher straightens. And for the first time since this whole
text: nightmare began, he resumes his role as President and
dialog: Commander-in-Chief.
speaker_heading: ASHER (cont'd)
dialog: Mr. Premier, this is President
dialog: Benjamin Asher. I hereby demand
dialog: the immediate withdrawal of all
dialog: combat divisions deployed along the
dialog: DMZ in their current posture of
dialog: imminent aggression --
text: The Premier stares back, face unreadable.
speaker_heading: ASHER (cont'd)
dialog: If you do not accede to this
dialog: request, you leave me no choice, in
dialog: accordance with America’s mutual
dialog: defense pact with the Republic of
dialog: Korea, to act against you at once
dialog: with the full might and fury of the
dialog: United States arsenal --
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: PREMIER
dialog: Mr. President. I assure you our
dialog: military forces are merely engaged
dialog: in war game exercise. This is our
dialog: sovereign right --
text: Asher’s voice hardens.
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: And this is my final request, Mr.
dialog: Premier. I want your word you will
dialog: stand down.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do I have it?
speaker_heading: PREMIER
dialog: The Democratic Peoples Republic of
dialog: Korea is a peaceable nation, Mr.
dialog: President.
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: (firm)
dialog: Do I have your word?
text: A long, excruciating beat.
speaker_heading: PREMIER
dialog: You have it.
text: The Premier’s face disappears from the screen.
text: The entire Crisis Room EXPLODES in cheers and applause.
text: Asher’s gaze flicks across the room -- and finds Malik. The
text: two men share a LONG, PROFOUND LOOK. Malik blinks first,
text: looks away.
text: Jacobs slowly approaches Asher.
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: Mr. President --
text: She struggles for the words.
speaker_heading: JACOBS (cont’d)
dialog: On behalf of the Secret Service...
dialog: I want you to know, sir..
dialog: (faltering)
dialog: I’m sorry.
dialog: 114.
text: Jacobs looks down. Nothing more to say.
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: No need to apologize, Director.
text: Asher glances at Banning.
speaker_heading: ASHER (cont’d)
dialog: You had your best man on it.
scene_heading: EXT. WHITE HOUSE - SAME
text: Dramatically backlit by searchlights, Army Rangers hoist the
text: American flag over the White House once again.
text: The Stars and Stripes ripple in the breeze.

scene_heading: EXT. WHITE HOUSE SOUTH LAWN - DAY

dialog: South Lawn.
scene_heading: SUPER THE LEGEND: SEVERAL WEEKS LATER
text: President Asher addresses the nation from his podium.
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: America has withstood many tests in
dialog: her time. None more trying than
dialog: this most recent adversity. But
dialog: together as a nation -- and through
text: the unflagging efforts of a
dialog: courageous few -- America has once
dialog: again proven that if we stand
dialog: together -- that if we stand as
dialog: one -- we shall always prevail.
text: The gathered all rise in THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE. Connor beams
text: proudly up at his father.
text: Then he turns. And if the boy can beam even more proudly, he
dialog: does.
dialog: 115.
text: For standing behind them, in the unmistakable shades and
text: coiled earpiece of the United States Secret Service
dialog: Presidential Protection detail, is...
text: MIKE BANNING.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
