text: A vast sea of stars severas as a backdrop for the Main Title, following by a rollup, whcih crawls into infinity.
dialog: There is unrest in the Galactic Senate
dialog: Several hundred solar systems under
dialog: the leadership of the rebel leader, Count
dialog: Dooku, have decalred their intentions to
dialog: secede from the Republic.
dialog: This separatist movement has made it
dialog: difficult for the limited number of
dialog: Jedi Kights to maintain peace and
dialog: order in the galaxy.
dialog: Senator Amidala, the former Queen of
dialog: Naboo, is returning to Coruscant
dialog: to vote on the critical issue
dialog: of creating an army to assist the
dialog: overwhelmed Jedi.
text: PAN UP to reveal the amber city planet of Coruscant. A yellow Naboo Fighter flies OVER CAMERA toward the planet, followed by a large Royal Cruiser and two more Fighters.
dialog: EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - DAWN
text: The ships skim across the surface of the city landscape. The sun glints off the chrome hulls of the sleek Naboo spacecraft as they navigate between the buildings of the capital planet.
dialog: EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN
text: Two Naboo Fighters land on one leaf of a three-leaf-clover landing platform. The Royal Starship lands on the central lead, and the third Fighter lands on the remaining plaform.
text: A small GROUP OF DIGNITARIES waits to welcome the Senator. One of the members of the group os a well dressed JAR JAR BINKS, a member of the Galactic Representative Commission, and DORME, Senator Amidala's handmaiden.
text: One of the FIGHTER PILOTS jumps from the wing of his ship and removes his helmet. He is CAPTAIN TYPHO, SENATOR AMIDALA'S Security Officer. He moves over to a WOMAN PILOT.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN TYPHO
dialog: We made it. I guess I was wrong,
dialog: there was no danger at all.
text: The ramp ;pwers. TWO NABOO GUARDS appear. SENATOR AMIDALA, ONE HANDMAIDEN (VERSE) and FOUR TROOPERS descend the ramp. AMIDALA is more beautiful now than she was ten years earlier when, as Queen, she was freeing her people from the yoke of the Trade Federation.
text: The DIGNITARIES start to move forward. SENATOR AMIDALA reaches the foot of the ramp, when suddenly there is a blinding FLASH and a huge EXPLOSION. The DIGNITARIES and PILOTS are hurled to the ground as the starship is destroyed.
text: Klaxons blare, alarms sound! CAPTAIN TYPHO and the TWO ESCORT PILOTS get up and run to where SENATOR AMIDALA lies dying. Beyond, ARTOO DETOO drops down from the Naboo Fighter and rolls toward the wreckage. The FEMALE ESCORT PILOT kneels by SENATOR AMIDALA and takes off her helmet, revealing SENATOR PADME AMIDALA.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Cordé...
text: She gathers up her decoy double in her arms. Cordé's eyes are open. She looks up at her.
dialog: CORDÉ
dialog: ... I'm sorry, m'lady... I'm... not sure I...
dialog: CORDÉ dies. PADMÉ hugs her.
speaker_heading: AMIDALA
dialog: No!... No!... No!...
text: PADMÉ lowers CORDÉ to the ground. She gets up and looks around at the devastation. There are tears in her eyes.
speaker_heading: AMIDALA
dialog: I should not have come back.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN TYPHO
dialog: M'Lady, you are still in danger.
dialog: Amidala says nothing.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN TYPHO
dialog: This vote is very important. You did
dialog: your duty and Cordé did hers. Now
dialog: come. (she doesn't respond) M'Lady,
dialog: please!
text: She turns. They walk away. ARTOO lets out a small whimper and rolls off after them.
dialog: EXT. SENATE BUILDING - DAY
text: The massive Senate Building glistens in the afternoon sun. Small patches of fog have still to burn off.
dialog: INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY
text: The vast rotunda is buzzing with chatter. MAS AMEDDA, the Supreme Chancellor's majordomo, tries to quiet things down as PALPATINE confers with an AIDE, UV GIZEN, riding a small one man floating scooter.
speaker_heading: MAS AMEDDA
dialog: Order! We shall have order! The motion
dialog: for the Republic to commission an army
dialog: takes precedent, and that is what we
dialog: will vote on at this time.
text: Everything quiets down. The AIDE disperses, and SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE steps to the podium.
dialog: PALPATINE
dialog: ...My esteemed colleagues, excuse
dialog: me... I have just received some
dialog: tragic and disturbing news. Senator
dialog: Amidala of the Naboo system... Has
dialog: been assassinated!
dialog: There is a shock silence in the vast arena.
dialog: PALPATINE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: This grievous blow is especially
dialog: personal to me. Before I became
dialog: Chancellor, I served Amidala when
dialog: she was Queen. She was a great
dialog: leader who fought for justice, not
dialog: only in this honourable assembly,
dialog: but also on her home planet. She
dialog: was so loved she could have been
dialog: elected queen for life. She
dialog: believed in public service, and
dialog: she fervently believed in
dialog: democracy. Her death is a great
dialog: loss to us all. We will all mourn
dialog: her as a relentless champion of
dialog: freedom... and as a dear friend.
text: There is a moment of silence. ASK AAK, the SENATOR of MALASTARE, moves his pod into the centre of the arena.
speaker_heading: SENATOR ASK AAK
dialog: How many more Senators will die
dialog: before this civil strife ends! We
dialog: must confront these rebels now,
dialog: and they need an army to do it.
dialog: A second pod moves into the centre of the area with DARSANA, the
dialog: AMBASSADOR OF GLEE ANSELM.
speaker_heading: AMBASSADOR DARSANA
dialog: Why weren't the Jedi able to stop
dialog: this assassination? We are no
dialog: longer safe, under their protection.
dialog: Senator ORN FREE TAA swings forward in his pod.
speaker_heading: ORN FREE TAA
dialog: The Republic needs more security
dialog: now! Before it comes to war.
dialog: PALPATINE
dialog: Must I remind the Senator from
dialog: Malastare that negotiations are
dialog: continuing with the separatists.
dialog: Peace is our objective here... not
dialog: war.
text: The SENATORS yell pro and con. MAS AMEDDA tries to calm things down. SENATOR PADME AMIDALA, with CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, and DORME, manoeuvre her pod into the centre of the vast arena.
speaker_heading: AMIDALA
dialog: My noble colleagues, I concur with
dialog: the Supreme Chancellor. At all
dialog: costs, we do not want war!
dialog: The Senate goes quiet, then there is an outburst of cheering and
dialog: applause.
dialog: PALPATINE
dialog: It is with great surprise and
dialog: joy the chair recognises the
dialog: Senator from Naboo, Padmé Amidala.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Less than an hour ago, an
dialog: assassination attempt was made
dialog: against my life. One of my
dialog: bodyguards and six others were
dialog: ruthlessly and senselessly
dialog: murdered. I was the target but,
dialog: more importantly, I believe this
dialog: security measure before you, was
dialog: the target. I have led the
dialog: opposition to build an army... but
dialog: there is someone in this body who
dialog: will stop at nothing to assure it's
dialog: passage...
dialog: Many of the SENATORS boo and yell at SENATOR AMIDALA.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I warn you, if you vote to create
dialog: this army, war will follow. I
dialog: have experienced the misery of war
dialog: first-hand; I do not wish to do it
dialog: again.
dialog: There is sporadic yelling for and against her statements.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Wake up, Senators... you must wake
dialog: up! If you offer the separatists
dialog: violence, they can only show us
dialog: violence in return! Many will
dialog: lose their lives. All will lose
dialog: their freedom. This decision
dialog: could very well destroy the very
dialog: foundation of our great Republic.
dialog: I pray you do not let fear push
dialog: you into a disastrous decision.
dialog: Vote down this security measure,
dialog: which is nothing less than a
dialog: declaration of war! Does anyone
dialog: here want that? I cannot believe
dialog: they do.
text: There is an undercurrent of booing... and groaning. SENATOR ORN FREE TAA moves his pod next to AMIDALA.
speaker_heading: ORN FREE TAA
dialog: My motion to defer the vote must
dialog: be dealt with first. That is the
dialog: rule of law.
text: AMIDALA looks angry and frustrated. PALPATINE gives her a sympathetic look.
dialog: PALPATINE
dialog: Due to the lateness of the hour
dialog: and the seriousness of this
dialog: motion, we will take up these
dialog: matters tomorrow. Until then, the
dialog: Senate stands adjourned.
dialog: EXT. EXECUTIVE QUARTERS BUILDING - DAY
dialog: The giant towers of the Republic Executive Building seem to reach the heavens. Traffic clogs the smoggy sky.
dialog: INT. CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE - DAY
text: CHANCELLOR PALPATINE sits behind his desk with TWO RED-CLAD ROYAL GUARDS on either side of the door. YODA, PLOT KOON, KI-AD-MUNDI, and MACE WINDU sit acress from him.
dialog: PALPATINE
dialog: I don't know how much longer I can
dialog: hold off the vote, my friends.
dialog: More and more star systems are
dialog: joining the separatists.
dialog: MACE WINDU
dialog: If they do break away -
dialog: PALPATINE
dialog: No! I will not let that happen!
dialog: MACE WINDU
dialog: But if they do, you must realise
dialog: there aren't enough Jedi to
dialog: protect the Republic. We are
dialog: keepers of the peace, not soldiers.
dialog: PALPATINE
dialog: Master Yoda, do you think it will
dialog: really come to war?
dialog: YODA closes his eyes.
dialog: YODA
dialog: Worse than war, I fear... Much
dialog: worse.
dialog: PALPATINE
dialog: What?
dialog: MACE WINDU
dialog: What do you sense, Master?
dialog: YODA
dialog: Impossible to see ... The Dark Side
dialog: clouds everything. But this I am
dialog: sure of -
dialog: (opens his eyes)
dialog: Do their duty the Jedi will.
text: A muted BUZZER SOUNDS. A hologram of an AIDE, DAR WAC, appears on the Chancellor's desk.
speaker_heading: DAR WAC
dialog: The loyalist committee has arrived,
dialog: my Lord.
dialog: PALPATINE
dialog: Send them in.
text: They all stand as SENATOR AMIDALA, CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, MAS AMEDDA, DORME, and SENATORS BAIL ORGANA, HOROX RYYDER and ORN FREE TAA enter the office. YODA and MACE WINDU move to greet the SENATOR, YODA taps AMIDALA with his cane.
dialog: YODA
dialog: With you the force is strong...
dialog: young Senator. To see you alive
dialog: brings warm feeling to my heart.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you
dialog: have any idea who was behind
dialog: the attack?
dialog: MACE WINDU
dialog: Our intelligence points to
dialog: disgruntled spice miners, on
dialog: the moons of Naboo.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: I don't wish to disagree but I
dialog: think that Count Dooku was behind
dialog: it.
dialog: There is a stir of surprise.
dialog: MACE WINDU
dialog: You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku
dialog: was once a Jedi. He wouldn't
dialog: assassinate anyone, it is not in
dialog: his character.
speaker_heading: KI-ADI-MUNDI
dialog: He is a political idealist, not
dialog: a murderer.
dialog: YODA
dialog: In dark times nothing is what it
dialog: appears to be, but the fact remains
dialog: Senator, in grave danger you are.
text: PALPATINE gets up, walks to the window, and looks out at the vast city.
dialog: PALPATINE
dialog: Count Dooku has always avoided
dialog: any kind of conflict. It appears
dialog: he has no desire to start a war.
dialog: Why would he kill you? To what end?
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: I don't know, but everything in my
dialog: being tells me he was behind it...
dialog: After gazing out of the window for several moments Palpatine turns to
dialog: Mace.
dialog: PALPATINE
dialog: Master Jedi, may I suggest that
dialog: the Senator be placed under the
dialog: protection of your graces.
dialog: BAIL ORGANA
dialog: Do you think that is a wise use
dialog: of manpower during these stressful
dialog: times?
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Chancellor, if I may comment, I
dialog: do not believe the...
dialog: PALPATINE
dialog: ..."situation is that serious."
dialog: No, but I do, Senator.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Chancellor, please! I don't want
dialog: any more guards!
dialog: PALPATINE
dialog: I realise all too well that
dialog: additional security might be
dialog: disruptive for you, but perhaps
dialog: someone you are familiar with... an
dialog: old friend like... Master Kenobi...
dialog: PALPATINE nods to MACE WINDU, who nods back.
dialog: MACE WINDU
dialog: That's possible. He has just
dialog: returned from a Border dispute on
dialog: Ansion.
dialog: PALPATINE
dialog: You must remember him, M'Lady...
dialog: he watched over you during the
dialog: blockade conflict.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: This is not necessary, Chancellor.
dialog: PALPATINE
dialog: Do it for me, M'Lady, please. I
dialog: will rest easier. We had a big
dialog: scare today. The thought of
dialog: losing you is unbearable.
dialog: AMIDALA sighs as the JEDI get up to leave.
dialog: MACE WINDU
dialog: I will have Obi-Wan report to you
dialog: immediately, M'Lady.
dialog: YODA leans into her ear.
dialog: YODA
dialog: Too little about yourself you
dialog: worry, Senator, and too much about
dialog: politics. Be mindful of your
dialog: danger, Padmé. Accept our help.
text: As the JEDI leave the office, PALPATINE continues to pace behind his desk.
dialog: PALPATINE
dialog: I will not like this Republiv, that
dialog: has stood for over a thousand
dialog: years, be split in two

dialog: JAR JAR
dialog: Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilen
dialog: to see'en yousa. Wahoooooo!

speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: It's Good to see you, too, Jar Jar.
dialog: JAR JAR
dialog: Oops! Wheresa mesa manners?
dialog: Excuse me, Master Obi-Wan. I
dialog: completely forgot myself for
dialog: a moment there. I have had to learn
dialog: Diplodiaclect... speak it like a

dialog: JAR JAR notices OBI-WAN'S APPRENTICE.

dialog: JAR JAR
dialog: Lookie... lookie... Oops!... Oh,
dialog: dear, I'm afraid I've forgotten
dialog: myself again.
text: PADME and TYPHO rise as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stop before the SENATOR. OBI-WAN steps forward. ANAKIN stares at PADME. She glances at him.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: It's a great pleasure to see you again,
dialog: M'Lady.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: It has been far too long Master
dialog: Kenobi. I'm so glad our paths
dialog: have crossed again... but I must
dialog: warn you that I think your
dialog: presence here is unnecessary.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: I'm sure the Jedi Council have
dialog: their reasons.
dialog: She moves in front of ANAKIN
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Annie??
dialog: (stares)
dialog: My goodness you've grown.
dialog: They look at each other for a long moment.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: (trying to be smooth)
dialog: So have you... grown more
dialog: beautiful, I mean... and much
dialog: shorter... for a Senator, I mean.
text: OBI-WAN looks disapprovingly at his apprentice. PADME laughs and shakes her head.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Oh Annie, you'll always be that
dialog: little boy I knew on Tatooine.
text: This embarrasses ANAKIN, and he looks down. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO smile.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Our presence will be invisible,
dialog: M'Lady.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN TYPHO
dialog: I am very grateful you are here,
dialog: Master Kenobi. The situation is
dialog: more dangerous than the Senator
dialog: will admit.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: I don't need more security, I need
dialog: answers. I want to know who is
dialog: trying to kill me.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (frowning)
dialog: We're here to protect you
dialog: Senator, not to start an
dialog: investigation.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: We will find out who is trying to
dialog: kill you Padmé, I promise you.
text: He's done it again. He bites his lip in frustration and shame. OBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a dirty look.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: We are not going to exceed our
dialog: mandate, my young Padawan learner.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I meant in the interest of
dialog: protecting her, Master, of course.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: We are not going through this
dialog: exercise again, Anakin. You will
dialog: pay attention to my lead.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: What??!!
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Why else do you think we were
dialog: assigned to her, if not to find
dialog: the killer? Protection is a job
dialog: for local security... not Jedi.
dialog: It's overkill, Master.
dialog: Investigation is implied in our
dialog: mandate.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: We will do as the Council has
dialog: instructed, and you will learn
dialog: your place, young one.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Perhaps with merely your presence,
dialog: the mysteries surrounding this
dialog: threat will be revealed. Now if
dialog: you will excuse me I will retire.
dialog: Everyone gives AMIDALA a slight bow as she and DORME leave the room.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN TYPHO
dialog: Well, I know I feel a lot better
dialog: having you here.
dialog: I'll have an officer on every
dialog: floor and I'll be at the command

text: ANAKIN is standing in the living room. He is in a meditative state. It is quiet. We hear DISTANT FOOTSTEPS in the corridor outside the apartment. Suddenly ANAKIN'S eyes pop open. His eyes dart around the room. He reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back in his belt.
dialog: The door to the apartment slides open, and OBI-WAN enters.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Captain Typho has more than enough

speaker_heading: ANAKIN

speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: She covered that camera. I don't

speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: What is she thinking?
speaker_heading: ANAKIN

speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: It's not an intruder I'm worried
dialog: about. There are many other ways
dialog: to kill a Senator.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I know, but we also want to catch
dialog: this assassin. Don't we, Master?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: You're using her as bait??
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: It was her idea... No harm will
dialog: come to her. I can sense

speaker_heading: OBI-WAN

Then a large arm cuts a small hole in the glass. A FAINT SOUND is heard as the small section of glass is removed from the window.
text: ARTOO wakes up, and his lights go on. The PROBE DROID freezes. ARTOO looks around, makes a PLAINTIVE LITTLE SOUND, then shuts down again. The PROBE DROID attaches a little tube to the window. TWO DEADLY LOOKING CENTIPEDE-LIKE KOUHUNS exit the tube, crawl through the blinds and head toward the sleeping PADME.

speaker_heading: OBI-WAN

dialog: trusted.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: She's not like the others in the
dialog: Senate, Master.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: It's been my experience that
dialog: Senators are only focused on
dialog: pleasing those who fund their
dialog: campaigns... and they are more
dialog: than willing to forget the
dialog: niceties of democracy to get those
dialog: funds.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Not another lecture, Master. Not
dialog: on the economics of politics....
dialog: It's too early in the morning... and
dialog: besides, you're generalising. The

speaker_heading: OBI-WAN

text: The PROBE DROID sends several protective electrical shocks across its surface, causing OBI-WAN to almost lose his grip. As they dart in and out of the speeder traffic, OBI-WAN disconnects a wire on the back of the DROID. Its power shuts off! OBI-WAN and the DROID drop like rocks. OBI-WAN realises the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. The DROID'S systems light up again and it takes off.

text: The DROID bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takesthe JEDI wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as OBI-WAN is forced to lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the DROID. The DROID heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy bounty hunter called ZAM WESELL, sees the DROID approach with OBI-WAN hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the JEDI. EXPLOSIONS burst all around OBI-WAN.

text: FINALLY, the DROID suffers a direct hit and blows up. OBI-WAN falls fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit. The JEDI struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver, ANAKIN.

dialog: That was wacky! I almost lost you
dialog: in the traffic.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: What took you so long?
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't
dialog: find a speeder I really liked,
dialog: with an open cockpit... and with
dialog: the right speed capabilities...
dialog: and then you know I had to get a
dialog: really gonzo color...
text: They zoom upward in hot pursuit of ZAM asshe fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: If you'd spend as much time
dialog: working on your saber skills as
dialog: you do on your wit, young Padawan,
dialog: you would rival Master Yoda as a
dialog: swordsman.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I thought I already did.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Only in your mind, my very young
dialog: apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!
text: As this conversation is going on, ANAKIN deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and miraculously through a construction site. ZAM WESELL continues firing at them.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Sorry, I forgot you don't like
dialog: flying, Master.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: I don't mind flying... but
dialog: what you're doing is suicide!
dialog: They barely miss a commuter train
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Master, you know I've been flying
dialog: since before I could walk. I'm very
dialog: good at this.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Just slow down!
text: ZAM WESSEL and the JEDI race through a line of cross-traffic made up of giant trucks. The speeders bank sideways as they slide around right-angle turns between buildings. ZAM races into a tram tunnel.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Wait! Don't go in there!
text: ANAKIN zooms into the tunnel after ZAM. They see a tram coming at them. They brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the charging commuter transport.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You know I don't like it when you
dialog: do that!
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Sorry, Master. Don't worry, this
dialog: guy's gonna kill himself any
dialog: minute now!
text: ZAM WESSEL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: What are you doing? He's gonna
dialog: blast me!
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Right - this isn't working.
text: ANAKIN slides underneath Zam's speeder. They race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: That was too close!
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Clear that!
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: What??
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Clear the flag! We're losing
dialog: power! Hurry!
text: OBI-WAN leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches forward with a surge of power.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Whooooaaa! Don't do that! I
dialog: don't like it when you do that!
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: So sorry, Master.
dialog: They chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: It's dangerous near those power
dialog: couplings! Slow down! Don't go
dialog: through there!
dialog: Huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Yiiii, what are you doing?
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Sorry, Master!
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: Oh, that was good...
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: That was crazy!!!
text: ZAM slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point-blank as ANAKIN approaches.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Ahh, damn.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Stop!!
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: No, we can make it.
text: ANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER'S speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: I'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm
dialog: crazy.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: But it worked... we made it.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: It didn't work... we've stalled!
dialog: And you almost got us killed!
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I think we're still alive.
dialog: ANAKIN works to get the speeder started. It quickly races to life.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (very angrily)
dialog: It was stupid!
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: (sheepishly)
dialog: I could have made it...
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (furious)
dialog: But you didn't!!! And now we've
dialog: lost him.
text: Suddenly, there is an ambush. Laser bolts fire everywhere. EXPLOSIONS surround them. They look up to see ZAM WESSEL take off.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: No we didnt...
text: Out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM. They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the right
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Where are you going?! He went
dialog: down there, the other way.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: This is a shortcut... I think.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: What do you mean, You think?
dialog: What kind of shortcut?! He went
dialog: completely the other way! Youve
dialog: lost him!
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Master, if we keep this chase
dialog: going, that creeps gonna end up
dialog: deep fried. Personally, Id very
dialog: much like to find out who in the
dialog: hell he is and who hes working
dialog: for...
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Oh, so thats why were going in
dialog: the wrong direction.
text: ANAKIN turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Well, you lost him.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Im deeply sorry, Master.
dialog: ANAKIN looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to
dialog: start counting to himself as he watches something below approach.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Excuse me for a moment.
text: ANAKIN jumps out of the speeder. OBI-WAN looks down and sees Zams speeder about five stories below them cruising past. ANAKIN miraculously lands on top of the Bounty Hunters speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. ZAM looks up and realises what has happened.
text: ZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. ANAKIN works his way back to the speeders cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN flies forward to the left front fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a BLAST near ANAKIN'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM cant reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.
text: OBI-WAN has jumped into the drivers seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, ANAKIN is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passengers seat.
text: ANAKIN sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls the gun out of ZAMS hand. She grabs the Jedis hand, and they struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles to pull the speeder out of its nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunters speeder.
text: Just as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, ZAM pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. ANAKIN goes flying into the street.
dialog: EXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET - NIGHT
text: ZAM exits the crashed speeder and runs. ANAKIN picks himself up off the pavement and runs down the very crowded street.
text: It's the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected on the filthy puddles. It's pretty crowded with various ALIEN LOW-LIFES, PANHANDLING DROIDS, and the occasional group of UPPERCLASS SLUMMERS.
text: ANAKIN barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing ZAM. He loses the Bounty Hunter in the crowd, them sees him again. The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd.
dialog: Ahead, ZAM turns in through a door and disappears.
text: A nightclub sighs is flashing over the door. ANAKIN is just about to follow ZAM when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters. PEOPLE start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the street beside him. OBI-WAN gets out and walks over, holding out ANAKIN'S lightsaber.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Anakin!
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: She went into that club, Master.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Patience.
dialog: OBI-WAN hands ANAKIN the lightsaber.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Here. Next time try not to lose it.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Sorry, Master.
dialog: ANAKIN reaches for the lightsaber, but OBI-WAN holds it back.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: A Jedi's saber is his most
dialog: precious possession.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Yes, Master.
dialog: He reaches for the lightsaber, OBI-WAN pulls it back.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: He must keep it with him at all
dialog: times.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I know, Master.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: This weapon is your life!
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I've heard this lesson before...
dialog: OBI-WAN finally holds out the lightsaber and ANAKIN grabs it.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: But, you haven't learned anything,
dialog: Anakin.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I try, Master.
dialog: INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
dialog: OBI-WAN and ANAKIN enter the nightclub bar, and everyone stares at them
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Why do I think you are going to be
dialog: the death of me?!
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Don't say that Master... You're
dialog: the closest thing I have to a
dialog: father... I love you. I don't want
dialog: to cause you pain.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Then why don't you listen to me?!
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I will. I'll do better, I promise.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Do you see him him?
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I think he's a she...
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Then be extra careful...
dialog: (nods to a room)
dialog: Check it out.
dialog: OBI-WAN goes away.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Where are you going, Master?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: To get a drink.
text: OBI-WAN heads for the bar. ANAKIN blinks in surprise, then moves into the room, where ALIEN FACES look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. OBI-WAN arrives at the bar. He signals the BARMAN.
text: CLOSE - Somewhere in the room a HAND moves to a pistol in its holster and unsnaps the safety catch. At the bar, a glass is placed in from of OBI-WAN. A drink is poured. He lifts the glass.
speaker_heading: ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO
dialog: Wanna buy some death sticks?
dialog: OBI-WAN looks at him. He moves his fingers slightly.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: You don't want to sell me death-
dialog: sticks.
dialog: ELAN
dialog: I don't want to sell you death-
dialog: sticks.
dialog: OBI-WAN moves his fingers.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: You want to go home and rethink
dialog: your life.
dialog: ELAN
dialog: I want to go home and rethink my
dialog: life.
dialog: He leaves. OBI-WAN lifts the drink and tosses it back.
text: CLOSE. The gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight. The BOUNTY HUNTER starts to move toward the bar.
text: ANAKIN checks out ALIEN FACES. OBI-WAN signals for another drink. The gun moves toward his unsuspecting back.
text: The drink is poured. OBI-WAN reaches for it. The gun is raised to aim directly at his back, and suddenly OBI-WAN turns fast. His lightsaber flashes. There is a shrill SCREAM and ZAM'S ARM hits the floor. The gun drops from its twitching fingers. Blood spreads.
text: The room is silent. ALIENS rise menacingly from their seats, and ANAKIN is suddenly at OBI-WAN's side, his lightsaber glowing.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Easy... Official business. Go
dialog: back to your drinks.
text: Slowly, the ALIENS sit. Conversation resumes. Onstage, THE PERFORMERS pick up their routine. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lift ZAM and carry her out.
dialog: EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
text: OBI-WAN and ANAKIN carry ZAM into the alley and lower her to the ground. OBI-WAN attends to her wounded shoulder. She stares up hatefully at ANAKIN. She winces in pain, then nods.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Do you know who it was you were
dialog: trying to kill?
speaker_heading: ZAM WESSEL
dialog: The Senator from Naboo.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Who hired you?
dialog: ZAM glares at OBI-WAN.
speaker_heading: ZAM WESSEL
dialog: It was just a job.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Tell us!
speaker_heading: ZAM WESSEL
dialog: That Senator's gonna die soon
dialog: anyway, and the next one won't
dialog: make the same mistake I did...
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: This wound's going to need
dialog: treatment.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Who hired you? Tell us... tell us
dialog: now!
dialog: ZAM glares hatefully.
dialog: ZAM
dialog: It was a Bounty Hunter called...
text: There is a sudden FTZZZ sound. ZAM twitches. She blinks in surprise and dies.
text: There is a WEOOSH from above. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up yo see an ARMOURED ROCKET-MAN taking off from a roof high above. OBI-WAN looks down at ZAM. He touches her neck and pulls out a small, wicked-looking dart.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Toxic Dart...
scene_heading: INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - DAY
dialog: ANAKIN and JAR JAR stand near the door of the anteroom to PADME'S
dialog: bedroom. PADME and DORME move about packing luggage.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Representative Binks. I know I can
dialog: count on you.
dialog: JAR JAR
dialog: Yousa betchen mesa bottums.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: What?!
dialog: JAR JAR
dialog: (coughs, recovers)
dialog: Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean,
dialog: I am honoured to accept this heavy
dialog: burden. I take on this
dialog: responsibility with deep humility
dialog: tinged with an overwhelming pride.
dialog: (pompously)
dialog: It is not every day that I am
dialog: called upon to...
text: PADME kisses him on the cheek and gives him a hug. JAR JAR turns red.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: You're a good friend, Jar Jar. I
dialog: don't wish to hold you up. I'm
dialog: sure you have a great deal to do.
dialog: JAR JAR
dialog: Of course, M'lady.
text: JAR JAR bows and goes out. As he passes ANAKIN, he flashes a dazzling smile... PADME is in a very bad mood.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: I do not like this idea of hiding.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Don't worry. Now that the Council
dialog: has ordered an investigation, it
dialog: won't take Master Obi-Wan long to
dialog: find that bounty hunter.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: I haven't worked for a year to
dialog: defeat the "Military Creation Act"
dialog: not to be here when its fate is
dialog: decided.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Sometimes we have to let go of our
dialog: pride and do what is requested of
dialog: us.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Pride?!? Annie, you're young, and
dialog: you don't have a very firm grip on
dialog: politics. I suggest you reserve
dialog: your opinions for some other time.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Sorry, M'lady. I was only trying
dialog: to...
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Annie! No!
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Please don't call me that.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Annie...
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: I've always called you that... it
dialog: is your name, isn't it?
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: It's Anakin. When you say Annie
dialog: it's like I'm still a little
dialog: boy... and I'm not.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: I'm sorry, Anakin. It's impossible
dialog: to deny you've...
dialog: (looks him over)
dialog: ...that you've grown up.
dialog: PADME smiles at ANAKIN. He becomes a little shy.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Master Obi-Wan manages not to see
dialog: it...
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Mentors have a way of seeing more
dialog: of our faults than we would like.
dialog: It's the only way we grow.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is
dialog: a great mentor. As wise as Master
dialog: Yoda and as powerful as Master
dialog: Windu. I am truly thankful to be
dialog: his apprentice. Only... although
dialog: I'm a Padawan learner, in some
dialog: ways... a lot of ways... I'm ahead
dialog: of him. I'm ready for the trials.
dialog: I know I am! He knows it too. He
dialog: believes I'm too unpredictable...
dialog: Other Jedi my age have gone
dialog: through the trials and made it...
dialog: I know I started my training
dialog: late... but he won't let me move
dialog: on.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: That must be frustrating.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: It's worse... he's overly
dialog: critical. He never listens! He
dialog: just doesn't understand! It's not
dialog: fair!
dialog: PADME cannot surpress a laugh. She shakes her head.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: I'm sorry... You sounded exactly
dialog: like that little boy I once knew,
dialog: when he didn't get his way.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I'm not whining! I'm not.
dialog: PADME just smiles at him. DORME laughs in the background.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: I didn't say it to hurt you.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I know...
dialog: There is a brief silence. PADME comes over to ANAKIN.
dialog: PADME
dialog: Anakin...
dialog: They look into each other's eyes for the first time.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Don't try to grow up too fast.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I am grown up. You said it
dialog: yourself.
dialog: ANAKIN looks deep into PADME'S eyes.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Please don't look at me like that.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Why not?
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Because I can see what you're
dialog: thinking.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Ahh... so, you have Jedi powers
dialog: too?
dialog: DORME is watching with concern.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: It makes me feel uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Sorry, M'lady.
dialog: ANAKIN backs away as PADME turns and goes back to her packing.
scene_heading: EXT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY
text: A small bus speeds toward the massive freighter docks of Coruscant's Industrial area. The spaceport is bustling with activity. Transports of various sizes moves supplies and passengers as giant floating cranes lift cargo out of starships. The bus stops before a huge intergalactic freighter starship. It parks in the shadows of an overhang.
scene_heading: INT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY
text: ANAKIN and PADME, dressed in Outland peasant outfits, get up and head for the door where CAPTAIN TYPHO, DORME and OBI-WAN are waiting to hand them their luggage. DORME is dressed to look like Senator Amidala.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN TYPHO
dialog: Be safe, m'lady.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Thank you, Captain. Take good

dialog: They laugh, and PADME embraces her faithful handmaiden. DORME start to weep.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: You'll be fine.
dialog: DORME
dialog: It's not me, M'Lady. I worry
dialog: about you. What if they realise
dialog: I'm not you?
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: (looks to Anakin)
dialog: Then my Jedi protector will have
dialog: to prove how grown up he is.
text: DORME and PADME smile. ANAKIN frowns as OBI-WAN pulls him aside.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Anakin, you stay put on Naboo.
dialog: Do not attract any attention. Do
dialog: absolutely nothing without

speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Yes, Master.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (to Padme)
dialog: I will get to the bottom of this
dialog: plot quickly, M'Lady. You'll be

speaker_heading: ANAKIN

speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: May the Force be with you, Master.
dialog: They head off toward the giant Starfreighter.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Suddenly, I'm afraid...
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I'm kinda scared too. This is my
dialog: first assignment on my own.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: There's nothing to worry about...
dialog: we have Artoo with us.
dialog: The two laugh.
dialog: OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO watch ANAKIN and PADME disappear into the
dialog: vastness of the spaceport with ARTOO trundling along behind them.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: I hope he doesn't try anything
dialog: foolish.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN TYPHO
dialog: I'd be more concerned about her

text: The freighter slowly takes off from the huge docks area of Coruscant. It soon moves into the crowded skies.
scene_heading: INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - LATE DAY
text: From high above, light streams down from the lofty ceilings. OBI-WAN crosses the floor of the great hallway, heaading for the Analysis Rooms.
scene_heading: INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ANALYSIS CUBICLES - LATE DAY
text: OBI-WAN walks past several glass cubicles where work is going on. He comes to an empty one and sits down in front of a console. A PK-4 ANALYSIS DROID comes to life. A tray slides out of the console.
dialog: PK-4
dialog: Place the subject for analysis on
dialog: the sensot tray, please.
text: OBI-WAN puts the dart onto the traym which retracts into the console. The DROID activates the system, and a screen lights up in from of OBI-WAN.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: It's a toxic dart. I need to know
dialog: where it came from and who made it.
dialog: PK-4
dialog: One moment, please.
text: Diagrams and .... appear on the screem, scrolling past at great speed. OBI-WAN watches as the screen goes blank. They tray slides out.
dialog: PK-4
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: As you can see on your screen,
dialog: subject weapon does not exist in
dialog: any known culture. Markings

speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Excuse me? Could you try again
dialog: please?
dialog: PK-4
dialog: Master Jedi, our records are very
dialog: thorough. they cover eight
dialog: percent of the galaxy. If I can't
dialog: tell you where it came from,
dialog: nobody can.
dialog: OBI-WAN picks up the dart and looks at it, then looks to the DROID.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Thanks for your assistance! You
dialog: may not be able to figure this

dialog: INT. STARFREIGHTER, STORAGE HOLD - DAY
text: The great, gloomy hold is crowded with EMIGRANTS and their belongings. To one side ARTOO is coming to the head of a food line, where SERVERS are ladling out bowls of mush. ARTOO holds two bowls.
dialog: SERVER
dialog: Keep moving! Keep moving!
text: ARTOO slips tube into a tub of mush and sucks up a large quantity. With one of his little claw-arms, he grabs several chunks of something that looks like brown bread. A SERVER sees him.
speaker_heading: FOOD SERVER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hey! No Droids!
text: ARTOO takes one last big suck and heads away from the food line. The SERVER shouts after him angrily. The little droid moves past groups of eating or sleeping EMIGRANTS and comes to where ANAKIN is sound asleep. The young Jedi seems to be having a nightmare. He is very restless.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: No, no, Mom, no...
text: He is sweating. PADME leans over to wipe some of the sweat from his forehead. He wakes up with a start, then realises where he is. PADME simply looks at him. He stares back, somewhat confused. ARTOO fills up two bowls with mush.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What?
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: You seemed to be having a
dialog: nightmare.
text: ANAKIN looks at PADME a little more closely, trying to see if he has revealed any of his secrets. She hands him a bowl of mush and bread.
dialog: PADMÉ

dialog: Are you hungry?
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: We went into lightspeed a while
dialog: ago.

speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I look forward to seeing Naboo
dialog: again. I've thought about it every
dialog: day since I left. It's by far the
dialog: most beautiful place I've ever
dialog: seen...
dialog: PADME is a little unnerved by his intense stare.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: You were just a little boy then.
dialog: It may not be as you remember it;
dialog: time changes your perception.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I think time has given me much
dialog: more mature feelings to enhance my
dialog: perception.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: It must be difficult having sworn
dialog: your life to the Jedi... not being
dialog: able to visit the places you
dialog: like... or do the things you
dialog: like...
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Or be with the people I love.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Are you allowed to love? I
dialog: thought that was forbidden for a
dialog: Jedi.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Attachment is forbidden.
dialog: Possession is forbidden.
dialog: Compassion, which I would define
dialog: as unconditional love, is central
dialog: to a Jedi's life, so you might say
dialog: we're encouraged to love.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: You have changed so much
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: You haven't changed a bit. You're
dialog: exactly the way I remember you in
dialog: my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has
dialog: changed much either.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: It hasn't...
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I can't wait to breathe the sweet
dialog: breeze that comes off the rolling
dialog: hills. Whenever I try to
dialog: visualise the Force, those hills
dialog: are what I see.
dialog: ANAKIN looks at PADME when he says this.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I love Naboo.
dialog: There is an awkward moment.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: (changing the subject)
dialog: Were you dreaming about you
dialog: mother earlier, weren't you?
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Yes... I left Tatooine so long
dialog: ago, my memory of her is fading.
dialog: I don't want to lose it. Recently
dialog: I've been seeing her in my
dialog: dreams... vivid dreams... scary
dialog: dreams. I worry about her.
dialog: PADME gives ANAKIN a sympathetic look.
dialog: EXT. CORUSCANT, DOWNTOWN, BACK STREET - MORNING
text: OBI-WAN walks down the street. It is a pretty tough part of town. Old buildings, warehouses, beat up speeders and transporter rigs occasional "shiny freighters" hissing through.
text: OBI-WAN comes to a kind of alien diner. On the steamed-up windowa it says "DEX'S DINER" in alien lettering. He goes inside.
dialog: INT. CORUSCANT, DEX'S DINER - MORNING
text: A young waitress, HERMIONE BAGWA, is wiping off a booth tabletop. There is a counter with stools and a line of booths along the wall by the window. A number of CUSTOMERS are eating - TOUGH-LOOKING WORKERS, FREIGHTER DRIVERS etc. HERMIONE looks up as OBI-WAN comes in.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Can I help ya?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: I'm looking for Dexter.
dialog: HERMIONE'S eyes narrow.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE BAGWA
dialog: Waddya want him for?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: He's not in trouble. It's
dialog: personal.
text: HERMIONE stares at OBI-WAN. There is a brief pause. Then she goes to the open serving hatch behind the counter.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE BAGWA
dialog: Someone to see ya, honey
dialog: (lowering her voice)
dialog: A Jedi, by the looks of him.
text: Steam billows out from the kitchen hatch behind the counter as a huge head pokes through.
dialog: DEXTER JETTSTER
dialog: Obi-Wan!
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Hey, Dex.
dialog: DEXTER JETTSTER
dialog: Take a seat! Be right with ya!
dialog: OBI-WAN sits in a booth.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE BAGWA
dialog: You want a cup of ardees?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Thank you.
text: HERMIONE moves off as the door to the counter opens and DEXTER JETTSTER appears. He is big - bald and sweaty, old and alien. Not someone to tangle with. He arrives, beaming hugely.
dialog: DEXTER JETTSTER
dialog: Hey, ol' buddy!
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Hey, Dex.
text: DEXTER eases himself into the seat opposite OBI-WAN. He can just make it. HERMIONE sets two mugs of steaming ardees in from of them.
dialog: DEXTER JETTSTER
dialog: So, my friend. What can I do for
dialog: ya?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: You can tell me what this is.
text: OBI-WAN places the dart on the table between them. DEX'S eyes widen. He puts down his mug.
dialog: DEXTER JETTSTER
dialog: Well, whattaya know...
dialog: DEXTER picks up the dart delicately between his puffy fingers and peers at it.
dialog: DEXTER JETTSTER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I ain't seen one of these since I
dialog: was prospecting on Subterrel
dialog: beyond the Outer Rim!
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Do you know where it came from?
dialog: DEXTER grins. He puts the dart down between them.
dialog: DEXTER JETTSTER
dialog: This baby belongs to them cloners.
dialog: What you got here is a Kamino
dialog: Kyberdart.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Kamino Kyberdart... I wonder why
dialog: it didn't show up in any analysis
dialog: archive.
dialog: DEXTER JETTSTER
dialog: It's these funny little cuts on
dialog: the side give it away...
dialog: Those analysis droids you've got
dialog: over there only focus on symbols,
dialog: you know. I should think you Jedi
dialog: would have more respect for the
dialog: difference between knowledge and
dialog: wisdom.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Well, Dex, if droids could think, we
dialog: wouldn't be here, would we?
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Kamino... doesn't sound familiar.
dialog: Is it part of the Republic?
dialog: DEXTER JETTSTER
dialog: No, it's beyond the Outer Rim.
dialog: I'd say about twelve parsecs
dialog: outside the Rishi Maze, toward the
dialog: south. It should be easy to find,
dialog: even for those droids in your
dialog: archive to find. Those Kaminoans
dialog: keep to themselves. They're
dialog: cloners. Damned good ones, too.
dialog: OBI-WAN then picks up the dart, holding it midway between them.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Cloners? Are they friendly?
dialog: DEXTER JETTSTER
dialog: It depends.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: On what, Dex?
dialog: Dexter grins.
dialog: DEXTER JETTSTER
dialog: On how good your manners are...
dialog: and how big your pocketbook is...
dialog: EXT. NABOO SPACEPORT - DAY
dialog: The Starfreighter lands in the giant port city of Theed.
text: PADME, ANAKIN and ARTOO are among the EMIGRANTS streaming from the Starfreighter and into the vast docking area. They exit onto the main plaza.
scene_heading: EXT. NABOO PALACE, GRAND COURTYARD (NABOO) - AFTERNOON
text: The speeder bus pulls up and stops. PADME, ANAKIN, and ARTOO get out. The great courtyard stretches out before them, and they see the rose-colored dome of the palace on the far side. ARTOO WHISTLES. They pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard. ARTOO trundles behind them.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: If I grew up here, I don't think
dialog: I'd ever leave.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I doubt that.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: No, really. When I started my
dialog: training, I was very homesick and
dialog: very lonely. This city and my Mom
dialog: were the only pleasant things I
dialog: had to think about... The problem
dialog: was, the more I thought about my
dialog: Mom, the worse I felt. But I
dialog: would feel better if I thought
dialog: about the palace - the way it
dialog: shimmers in the sunlight - the way
dialog: the air always smells of flowers...
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: ...and the soft sound of the
dialog: distant waterfalls. The first
dialog: time I saw the Capital, I was very
dialog: young... I'd never seen a
dialog: waterfall before. I though they
dialog: were so beautiful... I never
dialog: dreamed one day I'd live in the
dialog: palace.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Well, tell me, did you dream of
dialog: power and politics when you were
dialog: a little girl?
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: No! That was the last thing I
dialog: thought of. My dream was to help
dialog: in the "Refugee Relief Movement."
dialog: I never thought of running for
dialog: elected office. But the more
dialog: history I studied, the more I
dialog: realised how much good politicians
dialog: could do. So when I was eight, I
dialog: joined the "Apprentice
dialog: Legislators", then later on became
dialog: a Senatorial advisor, with such a
dialog: passion that, before I knew it, I
dialog: was elected Queen. Partly because
dialog: I scored so high on my education
dialog: certificate, but for the most part
dialog: it was my conviction that reform
dialog: was possible. I wasn't the
dialog: youngest Queen ever elected, but
dialog: now that I think back on it, I'm
dialog: not sure I was old enough. I'm not
dialog: sure I was ready.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: The people you served thought you
dialog: did a good job. I heard they
dialog: tried to amend the Constitution so
dialog: you could stay in office.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Popular rule is not democracy,
dialog: Annie. It gives the people what
dialog: they want, not what they need.
dialog: And, truthfully, I was relieved
dialog: when my two terms were up. So
dialog: were my parents. They worried
dialog: About me during the blockade and
dialog: couldn't wait for it all to be
dialog: over. Actually, I was hoping to
dialog: have a family by now... My
dialog: sisters have the most amazing,
dialog: wonderful kids... but when the
dialog: Queen asked me to serve as
dialog: Senator, I couldn't refuse her.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I agree! I think the Republic
dialog: needs you... I'm glad you chose
dialog: to serve. I feel things are going
dialog: to happen in our generation that
dialog: will change the galaxy in profound
dialog: ways.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: I think so too.
dialog: ANAKIN and PADME walk toward the palace. ARTOO continues to follow.
scene_heading: INT. NABOO PALACE, THRONE ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: QUEN JAMILLIA is seated on the throne, flanked by SIO BIBBLE and a COUPLE OF ADVISORS. FOUR HANDMAIDENS stand close by, and GUARDS are at the doors.
speaker_heading: QUEEN JAMILLIA
dialog: We've been worried about you.
dialog: (takes her hand)
dialog: I'm so glad you're safe, Padmé.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Thank you, Your Highness. I only
dialog: Wish I could have served you
dialog: better by staying on Coruscant for
dialog: the vote.
speaker_heading: SIO BIBBLE
dialog: Given the circumstances, Senator,
dialog: you know it was the only decision
dialog: Her Highness could have made.
speaker_heading: QUEEN JAMILLIA
dialog: How many systems have joined Count
dialog: Dooku and the separatists?
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: About two hundred. And more are
dialog: leaving the Republic every day.
dialog: If the Senate votes to create an
dialog: army, I'm sure it's going to push
dialog: us into a civil war.
speaker_heading: SIO BIBBLE
dialog: It's unthinkable! There hasn't
dialog: been a full-scale war since the
dialog: formation of the Republic!
speaker_heading: QUEEN JAMILLIA
dialog: Do you see any way, through
dialog: negotiations, to bring the
dialog: separatists back into the Republic?
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Not if they feel threatened. The
dialog: separatists don't have an army,
dialog: but if they are provoked, they
dialog: will move to defend themselves.
dialog: I'm sure of that. And with no time
dialog: or money to build an army, my
dialog: guess is they will turn to the
dialog: Commerce Guilds or the Trade
dialog: Federation for help.
speaker_heading: QUEEN JAMILLIA
dialog: The armies of commerce! Why has
dialog: Nothing been done in the Senate
dialog: to restrain them?
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: I'm afraid that, despite the
dialog: Chancellor's best efforts, there
dialog: are still many bureaucrats,
dialog: judges, and even Senators on the
dialog: payrolls of the Guilds.
speaker_heading: SIO BIBBLE
dialog: It's outrageous! After all of
dialog: those hearings, and the four trials in
dialog: the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is
dialog: still the Viceroy of the Trade
dialog: Federation. Do those money
dialog: mongers control everything?
speaker_heading: QUEEN JAMILLIA
dialog: Remember, Counsellor, the courts
dialog: were able to reduce the
dialog: Federation's armies. That's a
dialog: move in the right
dialog: direction.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: There are rumours, Your Highness,
dialog: that the Federation Army was not
dialog: reduced as they were ordered.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: The Jedi have not been allowed to
dialog: investigate. It would be to be too
dialog: dangerous for the economy, we were
dialog: told.
speaker_heading: QUEEN JAMILLIA
dialog: We must keep our faith in the
dialog: Republic. The day we stop
dialog: believing democracy can work is
dialog: the day we lose it.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Let's pray that day never comes.
speaker_heading: QUEEN JAMILLIA
dialog: In the meantime, we must consider
dialog: your own safety.
text: SIO BIBBLE signals. All the other ADVISORS and ATTENDANTS bow and leave the room.
speaker_heading: SIO BIBBLE
dialog: (to Anakin)
dialog: What is your suggestion, Master
dialog: Jedi?
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor.
dialog: He's still a Padawan learner. I
dialog: was thinking...
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: (nettled)
dialog: Hey, hold on a minute!
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Excuse me! I was thinking I would
dialog: stay in the Lake Country. There
dialog: are some places up there that are
dialog: very isolated.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Excuse me?! I am in charge of
dialog: security here, M'Lady.
dialog: SIO BIBBLE and QUEEN JAMILLIA exchange a look. Something is going on here.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Annie, my life is at risk, and
dialog: this is my home. I know it very
dialog: well... that is why we're here.
dialog: I think it would be wise for you
dialog: to take advantage of my knowledge
dialog: in this instance.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: (takes a deep breath)
dialog: Sorry, M'Lady.
speaker_heading: SIO BIBBLE
dialog: (to Anakin, amused)
dialog: She is right. The Lake Country is
dialog: the most remote part of Naboo.
dialog: Not many people and a clear view
dialog: of the surrounding terrain.
speaker_heading: QUEEN JAMILLIA
dialog: Perfect. It's settled then.
text: ANAKIN glares at PADME. Then QUEEN JAMILLIA gets up, and they all start to leave.
speaker_heading: QUEEN JAMILLIA
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Padmé, I had an audience with your
dialog: father yesterday. I told him what
dialog: was happening. He hopes you will
dialog: visit your mother before you
dialog: leave... your family's very
dialog: worried about you.
dialog: PADME looks worred. They ALL exit down the main staircase.
speaker_heading: EXT. JEDI TEMPLE - DAY
text: The main entrance at the base of the huge temple is bustling with activity. All sorts of JEDI are coming and going.
scene_heading: INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ARCHIVES LIBRARY - DAY
text: A bronze bust of Count Dooku, stands among a line of other busts of Jedi in the Archive Room. OBI-WAN stands in front it, studying the striking features of the chiselled face.
text: On the walls, lighted computer panels seem to stretch into infinity. Farther along the room in the background, FIVE JEDI are seated at tables, studying archival material.
text: After OBI-WAN studies the bust for a few moments before MADAME JOCASTA NU, the Jedi Archivist is standing next to him. She is an elderly, frail-looking human Jedi. Tough as old boots and smart as a whip.
speaker_heading: JOCASTA NU
dialog: Did you call for assistance?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (distracted in thought)
dialog: Yes... yes, I did...
speaker_heading: JOCASTA NU
dialog: He has a powerful face, doesn't
dialog: he? He was one of the most
dialog: brilliant Jedi I have had the
dialog: privilege of knowing.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: I never understood why he quit.
dialog: Only twenty Jedi have ever left
dialog: the Order.
speaker_heading: JOCASTA NU
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: The Lost Twenty... and Count Dooku
dialog: was the most recent and the most
dialog: painful. No one likes to talk
dialog: about it. His leaving was a great
dialog: loss to the Order.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: JOCASTA NU
dialog: Well, one might say, he was always
dialog: a bit out of step with the
dialog: decisions of the Council... much
dialog: like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: JOCASTA NU
dialog: Oh, yes. They were alike in many
dialog: ways. Very individual thinkers...
dialog: idealists...
dialog: JOCASTA NU stares at the bust
speaker_heading: JOCASTA NU
dialog: (continuing
dialog: He was always striving to become
dialog: a more powerful Jedi. He wanted
dialog: to be the best. With a lightsaber,
dialog: in the old style of fencing, he
dialog: had no match. His knowledge of
dialog: the Force was... unique. In the
dialog: end, I think he left because he
dialog: lost faith in the Republic. He
dialog: believed that politics were
dialog: corrupt, and he felt the Jedi
dialog: betrayed themselves by serving the
dialog: politicians. He always had very
dialog: high expectations of government.
dialog: He disappeared for nine or ten
dialog: years, then he just showed up
dialog: recently as the head of the
dialog: separatist movement.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Interesting... I'm still not sure
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: JOCASTA NU
dialog: Well, I'm sure you didn't call me
dialog: over here for a history lesson.
dialog: Are you having a problem, Master
dialog: Kenobi?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Yes, I'm trying to find a planet
dialog: system called Kamino. It doesn't
dialog: seem to show upon any of the
dialog: archive charts.
speaker_heading: JOCASTA NU
dialog: Kamino? It's not a system I'M
dialog: familiar with... Let me see...
dialog: JOCASTA NU leans over OBI-WAN'S shoulder, looking at the screen.
speaker_heading: JOCASTA NU
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Are you sure you have the right
dialog: co-ordinates?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: According to my information, it
dialog: should be in this quadrant
dialog: somewhere... just south of the
dialog: Rishi Maze.
dialog: JOCASTA NU taps the keyboard and frowns.
speaker_heading: JOCASTA NU
dialog: No co-ordinates? It sounds like the
dialog: kind of directions you'd get from
dialog: a street tout... some old miner or
dialog: Furbog trader.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: All three actually.
speaker_heading: JOCASTA NU
dialog: Are you sure it exists?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: JOCASTA NU
dialog: Let me do a gravitational scan.
dialog: OBI-WAN and JOCASTA NU studt the star map hologram.
speaker_heading: JOCASTA NU
dialog: There are some inconsistencies
dialog: here. Maybe the planet you're
dialog: looking for was destroyed.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Wouldn't that be on record?
speaker_heading: JOCASTA NU
dialog: It ought to be. Unless it was very
dialog: recent.
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: I hate to say it, but it looks
dialog: like the system you're searching
dialog: for doesn't exist.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: That's impossible... perhaps the
dialog: archives are incomplete.
speaker_heading: JOCASTA NU
dialog: The archives are comprehensive and
dialog: totally secure, my young Jedi.
dialog: One thing you may be absolutely
dialog: sure of - if an item does not
dialog: appear in our records, it does not
dialog: exist!
dialog: OBI-WAN stares at her, then looks back at the map.

dialog: PADME
dialog: It's not, Mom, I promise.

dialog: My first day as an Apprentice
dialog: Legislator. Notice the difference?

scene_heading: INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: OBI-WAN walks through the main hallway to the training area.
scene_heading: INT. JEDI TEMPLE, TRAINING VERANDA - DAY
text: OBI-WAN comes out onto the veranda and stops, watching TWENTY or so FOUR-YEAR-OLDS doing training exercises, supervised by YODA. They wear helmets over their eyes and try to strike little TRAINING DROIDS with their miniature lightsabers. The DROIDS dance in front of them.
dialog: YODA
dialog: Don't think... feel... be as one
dialog: with the Force. Help you, it will.
dialog: (he sees Obi-Wan)
dialog: Younglings - enough! A visitor we
dialog: have. Welcome him.
dialog: The CHILDREN take off their helmets and turn off their lightsabers.
dialog: YODA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the
dialog: mighty Bear Clan.
dialog: CHILDREN
dialog: Welcome, Master Obi-Wan!
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: I am sorry to disturb you, Master.
dialog: YODA
dialog: What help to you, can I be?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Im looking for a planet described
dialog: to me by an old friend. I trust
dialog: him. But the system doesnt show
dialog: up on the archive maps.
dialog: YODA
dialog: An interesting puzzle. Gather
dialog: round the map reader, younglings.
dialog: Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet.
dialog: Find it, we will try...
text: The map reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the top. The CCHILDREN gather around it. OBI-WAN takes out a little glass ball and places it into the bowl. The window shades close darkening the room and the reader lights up, projecting the star map hologram into the room. The CHILDREN laugh. Some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars. OBI-WAN walks into the display.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: This is where it ought to be...
dialog: but it isnt. Gravity is pulling
dialog: all the stars in this area inward
dialog: to this spot. There should be a
dialog: star here... but there isnt.
dialog: YODA
dialog: Most interesting. Gravitys
dialog: silhouette remains, but the star
dialog: and all its planets have
dialog: disappeared. How can this be?
text: There is a brief pause. Then a CHILD puts its hand up. YODA nods.
speaker_heading: JEDI CHILD JACK
dialog: Because someone erased it from the
dialog: archive memory.
dialog: CHILDREN
dialog: Thats right! Yes! Thats what
dialog: happened! Someone erased it!
speaker_heading: JEDI CHILD MAY
dialog: If the planet blew up, the gravity
dialog: would go away.
dialog: OBI-WAN stares; YODA chuckles.
dialog: YODA
dialog: Truly wonderful, the mind of a
dialog: child is. Uncluttered. To the
dialog: centre of the pull of gravity go,
dialog: and find your planet you will.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: But Master Yoda who could have
dialog: erased information from the
dialog: archives? Thats impossible,
dialog: isnt it?
dialog: YODA
dialog: (frowning)
dialog: Much harder to answer, that
dialog: question is.
scene_heading: EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, WATER SPEEDER, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON
text: A water speeder driven by PADDY ACCU, the retreat caretaker, skims across the lake away from the island landing platform where a chrome Naboo Starship rests. ANAKIN and PADME are sitting in the speeder as it skims away to where a lodge rises on a beautiful island in the middle of the lake.
scene_heading: EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN TERRACEM LATE AFTERNOON
text: ANAKIN and PADME walk up the stairs from where the water speeder is parked onto a terrace overlooking a lovely garden. Behind them, PADDY ACCU supervises two serving girls, NANDI and TECKLA, as they carry the bags into the Lodge.
text: ANAKIN and PADME stop at the balustrade. PADME looks out across the garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising beyond. ANAKIN looks at her silently.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: When I was in Level Three, we used
dialog: to come here for school retreat.
dialog: See that island? We used to swim
dialog: there every day. I love the water.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I do too. I guess it comes from
dialog: growing up on a desert planet.
dialog: PADME becomes aware that ANAKIN is looking at her.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: ...We used to lie on the sand and
dialog: let the sun dry us... and try to
dialog: guess the names of the birds
dialog: singing.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I dont like sand. Its coarse
dialog: and rough and irritating, and it
dialog: gets everywhere. Not like here.
dialog: Here everythings soft... and
dialog: smooth...
text: He touches her arm. PADME has become receptive to the way he looks at her but is nervous.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: There was a very old man who lived
dialog: on the island. He used to make
dialog: glass out of sand - and vases and
dialog: necklaces out of the glass. They
dialog: were magical.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: (looks into her eyes)
dialog: Everything here is magical.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: You could look into the glass and
dialog: see the water. The way it ripples
dialog: and moves. It looked so real...
dialog: but it wasnt.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Sometimes, when you believe
dialog: something to be real, it becomes
dialog: real. Real enough, anyway...
dialog: They look into each other's eyes. He touches her chin.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: I used to think if you looked too
dialog: deeply into glass, you would
dialog: lose yourself.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I think it's true...
text: ANAKIN kisses PADME. She doesn't resist. She comes to her senses and pulls away.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: I shouldn't have done that.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I'm sorry. When I'm around you,
dialog: my mind is no longer my own.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: It's the situation... the stress...
dialog: He looks at her.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: ...the view.
scene_heading: EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: Obi-Wan's Starfighter is ready for takeoff. OBI-WAN and MACE WINDU stand beside it.
dialog: MACE WINDU
dialog: Be wary, this disturbance in the
dialog: Force is growing stronger.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: I am concerned for my Padawan. He
dialog: is not ready to be on his own.
dialog: YODA
dialog: The Council is confident in this decision,
dialog: Obi-Wan.
dialog: MACE
dialog: He has exceptional skills. The
dialog: Council is confident in its
dialog: decision, Obi-Wan. If the
dialog: prophecy is true, he weill be the
dialog: one to bring balance to the Force.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: But he still has much to learn.
dialog: And his abilities have made him...
dialog: well... arrogant. I realise now
dialog: what you and Master Yoda knew from
dialog: the beginning... the boy was too
dialog: old to start the training and...
dialog: OBI-WAN hesitates.
dialog: MACE WINDU
dialog: There's something else?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Master, he should not have been
dialog: given this assignment. I'm afraid
dialog: Anakin won't be able to protect
dialog: the Senator.
dialog: MACE WINDU
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: He has a... an emotional
dialog: connection with her. It's been
dialog: there since he was boy. Now
dialog: he's confused... distracted.
dialog: MACE-WINDU
dialog: Obi-Wan, you must have faith that
dialog: he will take the right path.
dialog: OBI-WAN climbs into the cockpit of the Starfighter.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Has Master Yoda gained any insight
dialog: into whether or not this war will
dialog: come about?
dialog: MACE WINDU
dialog: Probing the Dark Side is a
dialog: dangerous process. He could be in
dialog: seclusion for days... May the
dialog: force be with you.
scene_heading: INT. JEDI TEMPLE, YODA'S QUARTERS - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: YODA sits with his eyes closed, meditating. Silence.
dialog: EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LOUNGE, LATE AFTERNOON
text: The setting sun touches the mountain peaks. The lake glows in the rose-tinted light. Floatinf lamps glean softly like jewels at the lodge.
scene_heading: INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
text: NANDI place dessert in front of PADME. TECKLA does the same for ANAKIN. The dessert is some kind of fruit. PADME picks up her fork and goes to spear a piece, but it moves! She frowns and tries again -the fruit moves. She lokk up at ANAKIN. His eyes are on his plate.
dialog: PADME
dialog: You did that?
dialog: ANAKIN looks up - wide-eyed innocence.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: What?
text: PADME scowls at him. PADME jabs at the fruit - ANAKIN subtly moves his hand and it lifts up from the plate and hovers in front of her.
dialog: PADME
dialog: That! Now stop it!
dialog: PADME laughs. ANAKIN laughs. She reaches out for the fruit - it loops.
dialog: PADME
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Anakin!!
dialog: ANAKIN moves his fingers. The fruit flies into his hand.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I'm not really supposed to do
dialog: that... for fun, I mean. If
dialog: Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be
dialog: very grumpy.
text: ANAKIN is pleased. He cuts the fruint into several pieces and sends one back to PADME. She bites it out of the air and laughs.
scene_heading: INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, FIREPLACE ALCOVE - TWILIGHT
text: A fire blazes in the open hearth. PADME is sitting in front of it, gazing at the flames.
text: She looks up as ANAKIN arrives. She makes room for him. Brief pause.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: May I tell you something?
dialog: PADME
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Then how can I tell you?
dialog: PADME
dialog: Maybe you should use your Jedi
dialog: intuition.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: It doesn't work around you. My
dialog: mind is always a muddle... I can
dialog: only think of you.
dialog: PADME
dialog: Anakin, don't...
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: From the moment I met you, all
dialog: those years ago, a day hasn't gone
dialog: by when I haven't thought of you.
dialog: And now that I'm close to you again,
dialog: I'm in agony. The closer I get to
dialog: you, the worse it gets. The
dialog: thought of not being with you
dialog: mskes my stomach turn over - my
dialog: mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I
dialog: can't breathe. I'm haunted by the
dialog: kiss you should never have given
dialog: me. My heart is beating, hoping
dialog: that kiss will not become a scar.
dialog: You are in my very soul,
dialog: tormenting me. What can I do? I
dialog: will do anything you ask...
dialog: Silence. The logs flame in the hearth.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: If you are suffering as much as I
dialog: am, tell me.
dialog: PADME
dialog: ...I can't. We can't. It's just
dialog: not possible.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Anything's possible. Padme,
dialog: please listen...
dialog: PADME
dialog: You listen. We live in a real
dialog: world. Come back to it. You're
dialog: studying to become a Jedi Knight.
dialog: I'm a Senator. If you follow your
dialog: thoughts through to conclusion,
dialog: they will take us to a place we
dialog: cannot go... regardless of the way
dialog: we feel about each other.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Then you do feel something!
dialog: There's an extraordinary
dialog: connection between us. You can't
dialog: deny that.
dialog: PADME
dialog: Annie, it doesn't make any
dialog: difference. Jedi aren't allowed
dialog: to marry. You swore an oath,
dialog: remember? You'd be expelled from
dialog: the Order. I will not let you
dialog: give up your responsibilities...
dialog: your future, for me.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I was destined to be a Jedi. I
dialog: don't think I could be anything
dialog: else. But you are asking me to be
dialog: rational. That is something I
dialog: know I cannot do. I wish I could
dialog: wish my feelings away... but I
dialog: can't.
dialog: PADME
dialog: I am not going to give into this.
dialog: I'm not going to throw my life
dialog: away. I have more important things
dialog: to do than fall in love.
text: There is silence as they stare at the fire. ANAKIN is thinking.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: It wouldn't have to be that way...
dialog: we could keep it a secret.
dialog: PADME
dialog: Then we'd be living a lie - one we
dialog: couldn't keep even if we wanted
dialog: to. Mt sister saw it. So did my
dialog: mother. I couldn't do that.
dialog: Could you, Anakin? Could you live
dialog: like that?
dialog: Silence for a moment.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: ...No, you're right. It would
dialog: destroy us.
dialog: EXT. SPACE
text: It's just like the star map hologram, plus the storm-shrouded planet of Kamino, which is exactly where it ought to be. Obi-Wan's Starship flies OVER CAMERA and heads down toward the planet.
scene_heading: EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
text: Heavy rans and hard-driving winds lash the platform as Obi-Wan's Starship approaches. The huge, ultra-modern city of Tipoca rests on great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever-present waves that cover the surface of this watery world.
text: The Starfighter lands. OBI-WAN gets out and makes his way through the bowling wind toward a tower on the far side of the platform. A door slides open. A shaft of brilliant light pierces the swirling rain. OBI-WAN passes through it and goes inside.
dialog: INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR ENTRANCE
dialog: A Brilliant white light. OBI-WAN pushes the soaking hood from his face.
speaker_heading: TAUN WE
dialog: Welcome to Tipoca City, Master
dialog: Jedi.
text: OBI-WAN wipes the rain from his face and blinks in surprise at a tall, pasty-white alien named TAUN WE. He has large, almond shaped eyes.
speaker_heading: TAUN WE
dialog: Everything is ready. The Prime
dialog: Minister expects you.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (warily)
dialog: I'm expected?
speaker_heading: TAUN WE
dialog: Of course! He is anxious to see
dialog: you. After all these years, we
dialog: were beginning to think you
dialog: weren't coming. Now please, this
dialog: way!
dialog: OBI-WAN masks his surprise as they move away along the corridor.
dialog: Obi-Wan follows Taun We cautiously.
scene_heading: INT. TIPOCA CITY, PRIME MINISTER OFFICE - DAY
text: The door slides open. OBI-WAN and TAUN WE enter and cross to where LAMA SU rises, smiling, from behind his desk, which, like all the furniture on Kamino, seems made out of pure light.
speaker_heading: TAUN WE
dialog: May I present Lama Su, Prime
dialog: Minister of Kamino... and this is
dialog: Master Jedi...
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Obi-Wan Kenobi.
speaker_heading: LAMA SU
dialog: Please...
text: LAMA SU indicates a chair. OBI-WAN sits. TAUN WE hovers. The room is bathed in brilliant white light. The whole place is ultra high-tech.
speaker_heading: LAMA SU
dialog: I trust you are going to enjoy
dialog: your stay. We are most happy you
dialog: have arrived at the best part of
dialog: the season.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: You make me feel most welcome.
speaker_heading: LAMA SU
dialog: And now to business. You will be
dialog: delighted to hear we are on
dialog: schedule. Two hundred thousand
dialog: units are ready, with another
dialog: million well on the way.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (improvising)
dialog: That is... good news.
speaker_heading: LAMA SU
dialog: Please tell your Master Sido-Dyas
dialog: that we have every confidence his
dialog: order will be met on time and in
dialog: full. He is well, I hope?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: I'm sorry Master - ?
speaker_heading: LAMA SU
dialog: Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. He's still
dialog: a leading member of the Jedi
dialog: Council, is he not?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Oh, yes. Sido-Dyas.
speaker_heading: LAMA SU
dialog: (rising)
dialog: You must be anxious to inspect the
dialog: units for yourself.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: That's why I'm here.
scene_heading: EXT. NABOO, MOUNTAIN MEADOW - LATER AFTERNOON
text: PADME and ANAKIN are in the middle of an idyllic hilly meadow, its lush grasses sprinkled with flowers. At a distance, a herd of SHAAKS graze contentedly.
text: Beyond is the shimmering expanse of the lake. Several other lakes stretch to the horizon. The warm air is full of little floating puffballs. They sit on the grass, in a playful, coy mood, talking. PADME is picking flowers.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Sure you do... you just don't want
dialog: to tell me.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Are you going to use one of your
dialog: Jedi mind tricks on me?
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: They only work on the weak-minded.
dialog: You are anything but weak-minded.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: All right... his name was Palo.
dialog: I was twelve. We were both in the
dialog: Legislative Youth Program. He was
dialog: a few years older then I... very
dialog: cute... dark curly hair... dreamy
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: All right, I get the picture...
dialog: whatever happened to him?
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: I went on to become a Queen. He
dialog: went on to become an artist.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Maybe he was the smart one.
dialog: PADME
dialog: You really don't like politicians,
dialog: do you?
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I like two or three, but I'm not
dialog: really sure about one of them.
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I don't think the system works.
dialog: PADME
dialog: How would you have it work?
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: We need a system where the
dialog: politicians sit down and discuss
dialog: the problems, agree what's in the
dialog: best interests of all the people,
dialog: and then do it.
dialog: PADME
dialog: That is exactly what we do. The
dialog: trouble is that people don't
dialog: wlways agree. In fact, they
dialog: hardly ever do.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Then they should be made to.
dialog: PADME
dialog: By whom? Who's going to make them?
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I don't know. Someone.
dialog: PADME
dialog: You?
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Of course not me.
dialog: PADME
dialog: But someone.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Someone wise.
dialog: PADME
dialog: That sounds an awful lot like a
dialog: dictatorship to me.
dialog: A mischievious little grin creeps across his face.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Well, if it works...
text: PADME stares at ANAKIN. He looks back at her, straight-faced, and can't hold a smile.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: You're making fun of me.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: On no, I'd be much too frightened
dialog: to tease a Senator.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: You're so bad!
text: PADME picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him. He catches it. PADME throws two more pieces of fruit, and ANAKIN catches them.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: You're always so serious. Always
dialog: carrying the weight of the
dialog: universe on your shoulders.
text: ANAKIN then starts to juggle the fruit. PADME laughs and throws more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They both laugh.
text: ANAKIN stands in front of a SHAAK, yelling at it and waving his arms. PADME starts laughing as ANAKIN runs in circles, chased by the SHAAK.
text: The SHAAK crosses in front of PADME. ANAKIN is riding it, facing the SHAAK'S tail. The SHAAK bucks, and ANAKIN falls off. PADME laughs even harder. ANAKIN lies still. PADME jumps uip and runs to where ANAKIN is face down in the grass. She turns him over. He is pulling a stupid face at her. She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. He catches her arm. She struggles. They roll over in the grass. Suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them. They let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away.
text: ANAKIN stands up and holds out his hand to her. She take it. He pulls her up. And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more. PADME scrambles up onto the SHAAK behind ANAKIN. She puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. ABAJUB digs his heels in. The SHAAK starts forward, and they ride away.
scene_heading: EXT. TIPOCA CITY, PARADE GROUND (RAINSTORM) - DAY
text: OBI-WAN, LAMA SU and TAUN WE come out onto a balcony. Below is a huge parade ground. The rain and wind are brutal. THOUSANDS OF STORMTROOPERS, faces covered by helmets, are marching and drilling in formations of several hundred.

dialog: OBI-WAN nods slowly.
scene_heading: INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, COMMINSSARY - DAY
text: LAMA SU conducts OBI-WAN through a large eating area. TAUN WE follows as they walk by HUNDREDS OF CLONES who look exactly alike, all about twenty years old, dressed in black. They are seated at tables, eating.
speaker_heading: LAMA SU
dialog: We modified their genetic
dialog: structure to make them less
dialog: independent than the original
dialog: host. As a result they are
dialog: totally obedient, taking any order
dialog: without question.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAM
dialog: Who was the original host?
speaker_heading: LAMA SU
dialog: A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.
dialog: We felt a Jedi would be the
dialog: perfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand-
dialog: picked Jango Fett himself.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Where is this bounty hunter now?
speaker_heading: LAMA SU
dialog: Oh, we keep him here. After a few
dialog: hundred thousand clones, the
dialog: genetic pattern starts to fade, so
dialog: we take a fresh supply. He lives
dialog: here, but he's free to come and go
dialog: as he pleases.
scene_heading: INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, BARRACKS - DAY
text: The tour continues through a long corridor folled with narrow, transparent tubes into which CLONES are climbing. Once in the tube, the CLONE goes to sleep.
speaker_heading: LAMA SU
dialog: Apart from his pay, which is
dialog: considerable, Fett demanded only
dialog: one thing - an unaltered clone for
dialog: himself. Curious isn't it?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Unaltered?
speaker_heading: LAMA SU
dialog: Pure genetic replication. No
dialog: tampering with the structure to
dialog: make it more docile... and no
dialog: growth acceleration...
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: I would like to meet this Jango
dialog: Fett.
speaker_heading: TAUN WE

dialog: it, for you.
dialog: TAUN WE bows, and leaves.
scene_heading: INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, CLASSROOM - DAY
text: The tour continues through a classroom filled with IDENTICAL YOUNG BOY CLONES.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: You mentioned growth
dialog: acceleration...
speaker_heading: LAMA SU
dialog: Oh yes, it's essential.
dialog: Otherwise, a mature clone would
dialog: take a lifetime to grow. Now, we
dialog: can do it in half the time. Those
dialog: items you saw on the parade ground
dialog: were started ten years ago, when
dialog: Sido-dyas first placed the order,
dialog: and they're already mature...
dialog: OBI-WAN looks at the BOY CLONES.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: And these?
speaker_heading: LAMA SU
dialog: About five years ago.
scene_heading: INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, HATCHERY - DAY
text: They enter a space filled with great racks of glass spheres, which are filled with fluid in which EMBRYOS are suspended.
speaker_heading: LAMA SU
dialog: They're immensely superior to

dialog: thought and action.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Very impressive.
speaker_heading: LAMA SU
dialog: I'd hoped you would be pleased.
dialog: OBI-WAN gazes at the nearest embryos.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: Tell me, prime minister, when my
dialog: Master Sido-dyas first contacted
dialog: you, did he say the order was
dialog: for... himself... or?
speaker_heading: LAMA SU
dialog: Himself? Of course not. This
dialog: army is for the Republic?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (astonished)
dialog: The Repubic?
speaker_heading: LAMA SU
dialog: We are also very much agasint this

speaker_heading: TAUN WE

speaker_heading: ANAKIN

speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I saw my mother. I saw her as

dialog: suffering, Padme. She is in
dialog: pain...They're killing her!
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: I know I'm disobeying my mandate
dialog: to protect you, Senator. I know I
dialog: will be punished and possibly
dialog: thrown out of the Jedi Order, but
dialog: I must go. I have to help her!
dialog: I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a
dialog: choice.
dialog: PADME
dialog: Annie, I told you I wouldn't let
dialog: you give up your future for me.
dialog: I'll go with you. That way you
dialog: can continue to protect me, and
dialog: you won't be disobeying your

speaker_heading: ANAKIN

text: As they wait, OBI-WAN notes the door lock entry mechanism. Then the door opens, and a ten-year-old boy, BOBA FETT, looks at them. He is identical to the boys in the classroom.
speaker_heading: TAUN WE
dialog: Boba, is your father here?
dialog: There is a brief pause, then BOBA FETT nods.
speaker_heading: TAUN WE

speaker_heading: BOBA FETT
dialog: Dad! Taun We's here!
text: JANGO FETT comes in from the bedroom. He wears a jumpsuit. He is unshaven and mean looking, his face pitted with scars of old wounds. There are a couple of weird tattoos on his muscular forearms. He eyes OBI-WAN with suspicion.
speaker_heading: TAUN WE
dialog: Welcome back, Jango. Was your
dialog: trip productive?
speaker_heading: JANGO FETT
dialog: Fairly.
dialog: OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT size each other up. BOBA FETT studies both of them.
speaker_heading: TAUN WE
dialog: This is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan
dialog: Kenobi. He's come to check on our
dialog: progress.
speaker_heading: JANGO FETT
dialog: That right?
dialog: JANGO FETT'S eyes fix OBI-WAN coldly.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Your clones are very impressive.
dialog: You must be very proud.
speaker_heading: JANGO FETT
dialog: I'm just a simple man, trying to
dialog: make my way in the universe,
dialog: Master Jedi.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Aren't we all?
text: OBI-WAN eyes the half-open bedroom door, through which a couple of pieces of body armour can be seen on the floor. JANGO FETT registers OBI-WAN'S look. He moves in front of him, blocking the view.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Ever made your way as far into the
dialog: interior as Coruscant?
dialog: JANGO
dialog: Once or twice.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Recently?
dialog: JANGO
dialog: (eyes Obi-Wan carefully)
dialog: Possibly...
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Then you must know Master Sido-

dialog: JANGO
dialog: Boba, close the door.

dialog: JANGO
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Master who?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Sido-Dyas. Isnt he the Jedi who
dialog: hired you for this job?
dialog: JANGO
dialog: Never heard of him. I was
dialog: recuited by a man called Darth
dialog: Tyranus on one of the moons of
dialog: Bogden.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: No? I thought...
speaker_heading: TAUN WE
dialog: Sido-Dyas told us to expect him.
dialog: And he showed up just when your
dialog: Jedi Master said he would. We
dialog: have kept the Jedis involvement
dialog: a secret until your arrival, just
dialog: as your Master requested.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Curious...
dialog: JANGO
dialog: Do you like your army?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: It seems to me it's your army -
dialog: being that they are all clones of
dialog: you.
dialog: JANGO
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: They'll do their job well, I'll
dialog: guarantee that.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN

dialog: JANGO
dialog: Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

dialog: EXT. TATOOINE, MOS ESPA STREETS AND WATTO'S SHIP - DAY
text: The Naboo Starship lands in a large parking lot of Spaceships on the outskirts of Mos Espa. ANAKIN and PADME ride a rickshaw through the streets. ANAKIN stares at sights he hasn't seen for years. Finally, they come to Wattos' shop, and the rickshaw stops.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: (to the droid driver)
dialog: Wait, please.
text: ANAKIN and PADME get down. Sitting on a stool in front of the shop is WATTO. He is using a small electronic screwdriver on a fiddly DROID. THREE PIT DROIDS are chattering away and are trying to help him, but they seem only to make him madder.
dialog: WATTO
dialog: (yelling, in Huttese)
dialog: No, not that one - that one!
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: (arriving)
dialog: Excuse me, Watto.
dialog: WATTO
dialog: (in Huttese)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: (in Huttese)
dialog: I said excuse me.
dialog: WATTO turns to the chattering PIT DROIDS.
dialog: WATTO
dialog: (in Huttese)
dialog: Shut down.
dialog: The PIT DROIDS snap into their storage position.
dialog: WATTO
dialog: (continuing, in Huttese)
dialog: What? I don't know you... What can
dialog: I do for you? You look like a
dialog: Jedi. Whatever it is... I didn't
dialog: do it.
dialog: WATTO drops the screwdriver and curses loudly in Huttese
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Let me help you with that.
text: ANAKIN takes the fiddly piece of equipment and starts to play with it. WATTO blinks in surprise.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.
text: WATTO looks at him suspiciously. He stares at PADME, then back to ANAKIN.
dialog: WATTO
dialog: Annie?? Little Annie?? Naaaah!!
text: Suddenly, the fiddly piece of equipment in Anakin's hands WHIRS into life. WATTO blinks at it.
dialog: WATTO
dialog: (continuing; in English)
dialog: You are Annie! It is you! You
dialog: little womp rat.
dialog: WATTO gives ANAKIN a big hug.

speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Sold her...
dialog: WATTO
dialog: Years ago. Sorry, Anne, but you
dialog: know, business is business.
dialog: Sold her to a moisture farmer
dialog: named Lars. Least I think it was
dialog: Lars. Believe it or not, I heard

dialog: ya beat that?
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Do you know where they are?
dialog: WATTO
dialog: Long way from here... someplace
dialog: over on the other side of Mos
dialog: Eisley, I think...
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I'd like to know.
dialog: ANAKIN'S grim look means business; WATTO gets the hint quickly.

scene_heading: EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
text: OBI-WAN comes out from the tower into the driving ran. The door closes behind him. He pulls his robe around him and stands braced against the gale.
text: Below, a huge wave crashes against the stilts. Spray flies high and whips across the platform where OBI-WAN is standing. He walks over to his Starfighter, looks to see if anyone is watching, then turns and goes back to the door. It slides open.
speaker_heading: INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
text: OBI-WAN enters cautiously from outside. Ahead, the corridor is deserted. He moves down it.
scene_heading: INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY
text: OBI-WAN walks in to find the room in complete disorder. The bedroom door is wide open - clear signs of hurried departure. All of the Fetts' personal belongings are gone.
text: OBI-WAN goes to an ultra-thin computer screen. He punches up AN ONSCREEN PICTURE of JANGO FETT and BOBA FETT unhitching the lines securing their ship to the landing platform. JANGO FETT is wearing his armour and rocket pack. BOBA FETT climbs aboard the small Fighter.
scene_heading: EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
text: JANGO FETT picks up a case and swings it up to BOBA FETT, who stows it inside the ship. JANGO FETT picks up another case and is about to swing it, when:
speaker_heading: BOBA FETT
dialog: Dad!!
text: JANGO FETT turns to see OBI-WAN charging out of the tower toward him. As he runs, OBI-WAN draws his lightsaber from his belt. It flashes on.
text: JANGO FETT draws his gun and fires at the charging JEDI. OBI-WAN deflects the blast and swings at JANGO FETT.
text: The bounty hunter rockets up and over OBI-WAN, landing behind him. He fires a thin wire from his wrist pack, trying to entangle the Jedi.
text: JANGO FETT fire several Kamino Kyber Darts from his elbow launcher. OBI-WAN deflects them back at JANGO FETT, but they strike harmlessly against the bounty hunter's armour.
text: IN THE COCKPIT of Jango Fett's ship, BOBA FETT grabs the controls of a laser gun and swings it to aim at OBI-WAN.
text: OUTSIDE, in the driving rain, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT circle each other, sizing each other up - feinting.
text: IN THE COCKPIT, each time BOBA FETT is ready to fire, JANGO FETT blocks his view of OBI-WAN.
text: OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN makes a sudden attack, swinging at JANGO FETT, who deflects the blows. One slices off a piece of the bounty hunter's shoulder plate. JANGO FETT rockets into the air and hovers above OBI-WAN. The Jedi spins as:
dialog: IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT fires.
text: OUTSIDE, the laser shell streaks past OBI-WAN to strike the edge of the tower. JANGO FETT fires down at OBI-WAN. The Jedi deflects the shots back, but JANGO FETT evades them. Then he swoops down, swinging around OBI-WAN. As he shoots past, he kicks the lightsaber out of the Jedi's hand.
text: The lightsaber skids across the wet surface of the landing platform. OBI-WAN dives after it. JANGO FETT zooms in front of him and grabs the lightsaber. OBI-WAN punches it out of his hand.
dialog: IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT watches as:
text: OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT grapple and fight, punching, kicking, grabbing hold, and throwing each other around. OBI-WAN grabs JANGO FETT tightly, and JANGO FETT rockets up into the air and kicks OBI-WAN loose. OBI-WAN crashes to the deck and slides toward the edge. He grapples desperately for a handhold on the slick surface.
text: JANGO FETT rockets down to kick at him. OBI-WAN hauls himself up. JANGO FETT zooms to the far side of the platform.
text: OBI-WAN uses Jedi powers to pull part of the structure loose. It hits JANGO FETT, who loses his balance, teetering on the edge. OBI-WAN charges acress, dives, and grabs hold of JANGO FETT just as he falls over the edge.
text: Locked together, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT plummet down toward the raging ocean. At the last moment, JANGO FETT fires a cable out of his backpack that shoots upward and locks onto a metal strut on the underside of the platform. OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT swing and CRASH onto one of the stilts.
text: OBI-WAN is knocked clear and drops onto a SMALL SERVICE PLATFORM just above the waves. He hauls himself to his feet. JANGO FETT hovers in mid-air opposite him, as a HUGE WAVE crashes over OBI-WAN. When it subsides, the Jedi has disappeared.
text: JANGO FETT rockets up to the landing platform, where he drops down beside his ship. He clambers inside the cockpit and settles into the pilot's seat. He punches buttons. The engines ROAR.
text: OUTSIDE, Jango Fett's ship lifts off from the platform and heads up into the lowering sky. It disappears. Lightning flashes. Rain lashes the tower and streams across the surface of the platform, to where:
text: A HAND suddenlt clutches at the very edge of the platform. A moment later, ANOTHER HAND grabs hold.
scene_heading: EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD - LATE DAY

speaker_heading: ANAKIN

scene_heading: INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, DINING AREA - LATE DAY
dialog: CLIEGG, OWEN, PADME and ANAKIN sit around the table, BERU brings the drinks from the kitchen.
dialog: CLIEGG
dialog: Your mother had gone out early,
dialog: like she always did, to pick
dialog: mushrooms that grow on the
dialog: vaporatos. From the tracks, she
dialog: was about halfway when they
dialog: took her. Those Tuskens walk like
dialog: men, but they're vicious, mindless
dialog: monsters. Thirty of us went out
dialog: after her. Four of us came back.
dialog: Three more are still out there
dialog: looking. I'd be with them,
dialog: only... I just couldn't ride any
dialog: more... until I heal.
dialog: CLIEGG grimaces, easing his throbbing leg.
dialog: CLIEGG
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: This isn't the way I wanted to
dialog: meet you, son. This isn't how
dialog: your mother and I planned it. I
dialog: don't want to give up on her, but

dialog: little hope she's lasted this long.
dialog: Silence. Then ANAKIN stands up.
dialog: OWEN
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: To find my mother.
dialog: PADME
dialog: No, Annie!
dialog: CLIEGG

text: The ship goes into a power-climb. A GREAT SPACE DDOGFIGHT ensues between OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT.
dialog: EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS
text: The ships flip, roll, and turn at incredible speed, didging, weaving and firing. They tumble from near misses. Hits fly off Obi-Wan's fighter as one of Jango's missiles gets through.
text: Finally, it seems as if OBI-WAN is getting the upper hand. JANGO FETT breaks off the fight and dives sharply. He maneuvers deftly between two huge asteroids.
dialog: In JANGO FETT'S COCKPIT, BOBA FETT flinches as asteroids pass very close by.
speaker_heading: BOBA FETT
dialog: Dad! Watch out!
speaker_heading: JANGO FETT
dialog: Stay calm, son. We'll be fine.
dialog: That Jedi won't be able to follow

text: IN OBI-WAN'S COCKPIT, his skill is pushed to the limit as he throws the ship from side to side, avoiding great rocks. Then a huge asteroid tumbles across his path. There seem no way he can avoid it. OBI-WAN fires a couple of aerial torpedoes. They streak toward the asteroid.
text: IN JANGO'S COCKPIT, they see the huge explosion as Obi-Wan's ship appears to smash into the asteroid.
speaker_heading: BOBA FETT

dialog: PADME
dialog: I'm not leaving, Threepio. I just

dialog: C-3PO
dialog: That's something I cannot relate

dialog: Oh, I'm not unhappy... and my

dialog: it's just... being like this...
dialog: well, it's embarrassing.
dialog: PADME
dialog: Being like what?
dialog: C-3PO
dialog: Naked. If you pardon the
dialog: expression. You see, when Master
dialog: Annie made me, he never quite
dialog: found the time to give me any
dialog: outer covering. It's so
dialog: humiliating. How would you like it
dialog: if you had to go around with all
dialog: your circuits showing?
dialog: PADME
dialog: I guess I wouldn't like it at all.
dialog: C-3PO
dialog: Of course you wouldn't. Nobody
dialog: would. It's simply not protocol.
dialog: PADME looks thoughtfully at a pile of spare parts and bits of metal and tools.
dialog: PADME
dialog: Maybe we can do something about it.
dialog: C-3PO
dialog: I don't think so. Only Master
dialog: Annie...
dialog: PADME
dialog: Why not? They seem to have a box
dialog: of old coverings here.
dialog: C-3PO
dialog: Oh? How observant of you, Miss
dialog: Padme. Of course, I'm just not
dialog: mechanically minded... if you see
dialog: what I mean.
dialog: PADME picks up a piece of metal and holds it against him.
dialog: PADME
dialog: Let's see, if we put this...

dialog: Geonosis is a red rock planet, featureless apart from buttes and mesas, and occasional tall stalagmites that stand out dramatically on the arid plains.

dialog: EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT
text: OBI-WAN climbs a steep, narrow trail. Suddenly, a CRY is heard close by. OBI-WAN stumbles slightly. His foot slips on the edge, sending a stream of peblles skittering into the darkness.

text: He sets off again and works his way around a narrow corner, to confront a crouching MASSIFF (a dog-sized lizard) with slavering fangs! The beast leaps at him, and OBI-WAN ignites his lightsaber as the MASSIFF knocks him on his back. Its jaws open wide. OBI-WAN stabs the creature, throws it off of him, and jumps up.

They are sitting a short distance from the door. ANAKIN wriggles around the black. He takes out his lightsaber and cuts into the base of the wall.
dialog: INT. TUSKEN RAIDER HUTT - NIGHT
text: The lightsaber completes the hole in the wall. ANAKIN wriggles in. He pulls himself to his feet. There are candles everywhere.
text: A shaft of moonlight from a hole in the roof pierces the gloom of the hut. By its light, ANAKIN sees SHMI, hanging from a wooden frame in the middle of the hut.
text: He cuts her free, takes her into his arms, and lowers her gently to the ground. Her eyes are closed. Her face is bloodied. She has been
dialog: terribly beaten. Anakin cradles her tenderly.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Mom... Mom... Mom...
dialog: SHMI'S eyelids flutter - and barely open. They are caked with blood.
dialog: SHMI
dialog: Annie...? Is it you?
dialog: SHMI'S eyes focus slowly. ANAKIN gives a little choking gasp.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Im here, Mom. Youre safe. Hang
dialog: on. Im going to get you out of
dialog: here...
dialog: SHMI
dialog: Im so glad... to see you,
dialog: Annie... Now... I am complete...
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Just stay with me, Mom. Im going
dialog: to make you well again.
dialog: Everythings going to be fine.
dialog: SHMI
dialog: You look so handsome. My son...
dialog: my grown-up son. Im so proud of
dialog: you, Annie... so proud... I missed
dialog: you so much... I love...
text: SHMI dies. ANAKIN draws her to his breast. There is silence for a moment. ANAKIN lifts his head, listening for a moment, then he sits on the floor of the Tusken hut, cradling his dead mother in his arms.
dialog: EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT
text: OBI-WAN arrives at the head of the trail. Far below, a flat plain stretches into the distance. He stop, peering into the darkness, where strange shapes loom indistinctly.
text: OBI-WAN takes a pair of electronic binoculars from his belt and puts them to his eyes. He sees a cluster of great towers like fantastic stalagmites rise from the plain below.
text: SLOW PAN with the binoculars, and suddenly a line of Battle Starships come into view. OBI-WAN touches the viewfinder. Between fifty and a hundred Federation Starships in near rows. Some are on platforms that are carrying the Starships diwn to an underground facility. Other platforms are rising to the surface. They carry THOUSANDS of BATTLE DROIDS that step off and file into the waiting ships. A fully loaded Starship takes off. OBI-WAN swings the binoculars upward, to see more Federation Starships.
scene_heading: EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS - DAWN
text: The pale light grows. Thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold, clear air. Somewhere an dog BARKS. An OLD WOMAN comes out of one of the huts. She carries a pail. She swirls it and tosses the dirty water onto the ground.
text: As she goes back inside the hut, a TUSKEN CHILD runs past, dragging a stick in the sand. The CHILD runs through the line of huts, turns a corner, and stops suddenly, staring at the bodies of the TWO TUSKEN GUARDS. Between them, ANAKIN stands outside the hut door. His face is a grim mask. The CHILD stares, then there is a FLASH OF LIGHT as Anakins lightsaber switches on.
dialog: EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT

text: A hologram of OBI-WAN flickers in front of a group, made up of Jedi (YODA, MACE WINDU, and KI-ADI-MUNDI) and Senators (BAIL ORGANA, ASK AAK, LUMINARA, and JAR JAR). PALPATINE and MAS AMEDDA are in the middle of the group, watching with growing concern.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: ...Starships from the Trade
dialog: Federation and the Commerce Guilds
dialog: are taking deliveries of battle
dialog: droids from the foundries on
dialog: Geonosis.
dialog: BAIL ORGANA
dialog: That's outrageous! The treaty
dialog: forbids the Trade Federation from
dialog: building up an army. What are
dialog: they doing?!
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: The droid foundry seems to be
dialog: working at full capacity. I am
dialog: going to go down and investigate.
dialog: I will bring Jango Fett back home
dialog: for interrogation.
dialog: PALPATINE
dialog: Those Geonosian foundries are part
dialog: of the Techno Union. We will call
dialog: in their representatives and ask
dialog: them a few very pointed questions.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: One more thing. Jango mentioned
dialog: he was recruited by someone named
dialog: Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that
dialog: might be?
dialog: YODA
dialog: With the forename Darth, a Sith he
dialog: must be.
dialog: MACE WINDU
dialog: Our missing apprentice. They are
dialog: playing their hand at last.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Do you believe he could be the
dialog: mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the
dialog: deal for the clone army?
dialog: YODA
dialog: Perhaps too many pieces are missing
dialog: from this puzzle, there are.
dialog: MACE WINDU
dialog: Be careful, Obi-Wan. This
dialog: investigation is becoming less
dialog: than routine. Do you need help?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Let me see if I can figure out
dialog: what's going on first.
text: The hologram of OBI-WAN fades off. PALPATINE stares at the spot where the hologram was in disbelief.
dialog: BAIL ORGANA
dialog: The Commerce Guilds are preparing
dialog: for war... there can be no doubt
dialog: of that.
dialog: PALPATINE
dialog: Count Dooku must have made a
dialog: treaty with them.
dialog: MACE WINDU
dialog: We must stop them soon before
dialog: they're fully ready.
speaker_heading: SENATOR ASK AAK
dialog: The debate is over, we need
dialog: that clone army now!
dialog: BAIL ORGANA
dialog: Unfortunately, the debate is not
dialog: over. The Senate will never be
dialog: able to approve the use of that
dialog: army before the separatists
dialog: attack.
dialog: Mas Amedda, who had been silent up until now suddenly speaks up.
speaker_heading: MAS AMEDDA
dialog: This is a crisis! If the Senate
dialog: votes the Chancellor emergency
dialog: powers, he could approve the use
dialog: of the army in a minute.
dialog: PALPATINE
dialog: Please, please, I don't wish to
dialog: have emergency powers. That's too
dialog: extreme a solution. It's akin to
dialog: a dictatorship. We must rely on
dialog: the Jedi. Master Yoda, how many
dialog: are available to go to Geonosis?
dialog: MACE WINDU and YODA look at one another.
dialog: YODA
dialog: Two Hundred,... less or more.
dialog: BAIL ORGANA
dialog: With all due respect for the Jedi
dialog: Order, two hundred will be no
dialog: match for hundreds of thousands of
dialog: battle droids.
dialog: MACE WINDU
dialog: Patience. We should wait for Obi-
dialog: Wan to report back. We don't know
dialog: that Count Dooku has made a treaty
dialog: with the Corporate Alliance, it's
dialog: speculation.
speaker_heading: SENATOR ASK AAK
dialog: But we must prepare for the worst.
dialog: I'm going to propose a motion
dialog: granting emergency powers to the
dialog: Chancellor at the next session. We
dialog: must not wait!
dialog: PALPATINE
dialog: Out of the question, Senator! You
dialog: and I are too closely aligned.
dialog: The issue will become partisan and
dialog: debates will begin. The proposal
dialog: must come from a neutral source.
speaker_heading: MAS AMEDDA
dialog: If only Senator Amidala were here.
dialog: JAR JAR steps forward from the back of the group.
dialog: JAR JAR
dialog: Supreme Chancellor... my august
dialog: colleagues, I would be proud to
dialog: propose the motion in question.
dialog: This is a grave situation, and I'm
dialog: sure Senator Amidala, and the
dialog: Queen of Naboo would agree.
speaker_heading: SENATOR ASK AAK
dialog: Thank you, Representative Binks.
dialog: Silence. Then PALPATINE sighs deeply.

dialog: If called upon, I will serve. But

speaker_heading: COUNT DOOKU
dialog: I'm delighted to meet you at

dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi-
dialog: Wan Kenobi. I am formally
dialog: requesting you turn him over to
dialog: me, now.
dialog: DOOKU
dialog: He has been convicted of
dialog: espionage, Senator, and will be
dialog: executed. In just a few hours, I
dialog: believe.
dialog: COUNT DOOKU smiles.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: He is an officer of the Republic.
dialog: You can't do that.
dialog: DOOKU
dialog: We don't recognise the Republic
dialog: here, Senator. But if Naboo were
dialog: to join our Alliance, I could
dialog: easily hear your plea for clemency.
dialog: ANAKIN grabs his lightsaber but doesn't turn it on.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: And if I don't join your
dialog: rebellion, I assume this Jedi with
dialog: me will also die?
dialog: DOOKU
dialog: I don't wish to make you to join
dialog: our cause against your will,
dialog: Senator, but you are a rational,
dialog: honest representative of your
dialog: people and I assume you want to do
dialog: what's in their best interest.
dialog: Aren't you fed up with the
dialog: corruption, the bureaucrats, the
dialog: hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren't
dialog: you? Be honest, Senator.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: The ideals are still alive, Count,
dialog: even if the institution is failing.
dialog: DOOKU
dialog: You believe in the same ideals we
dialog: believe in! The same ideals we
dialog: are striving to make prominent.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: If what you say is true, you
dialog: should stay in the Republic and
dialog: help Chancellor Palpatine put
dialog: things right.
dialog: DOOKU
dialog: The Chancellor means well, M'Lady
dialog: but he is incompetent. He has
dialog: promised to cut the bureaucracy,
dialog: but the bureaucrats are stronger
dialog: than ever, no? Senator, the
dialog: Republic cannot be fixed. It is
dialog: time to start over. The
dialog: democratic process in the Republic
dialog: is a sham, a shell game played
dialog: on the voters. It will not be long
dialog: before the cult of greed, called
dialog: the Republic, will lose even the
dialog: pretext of democracy and freedom.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: I cannot believe that. I will not
dialog: forsake all I have honoured and
dialog: worked for and betray the
dialog: Republic. I know of your treaties
dialog: with the Trade Federation, the
dialog: Commerce Guilds, and the others,
dialog: Count. What is happening here is
dialog: not government that has been
dialog: bought out by business... it's
dialog: business becoming government!
dialog: DOOKU
dialog: Are you willing to betray your Jedi
dialog: friends? Without your co-operation
dialog: I can do nothing to stop their
dialog: execution.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: What is to happen to me? Am I to be
dialog: executed also?
dialog: DOOKU
dialog: I wouldn't think of such an
dialog: offence. But, there are
dialog: individuals who have a strong
dialog: interest in your demise, M'lady.
dialog: It has nothing to do with
dialog: politics, I'm afraid. It's purely
dialog: personal, and they have already
dialog: paid great sums to have you
dialog: assassinated. I'm sure they will
dialog: push hard to have you included in
dialog: the executions. I'm sorry but if
dialog: you are not going to co-operate, I

dialog: Geonosians for justice. I've done
dialog: all I can for you.

speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: PADMÉ

speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: You love me?! I thought we
dialog: decided not to fall in love. That
dialog: we would be forced to live a lie.
dialog: That it would destroy our lives...
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: I think our lives are about to be
dialog: destroyed anyway. My love for you
dialog: is a puzzle, Annie, for which I
dialog: have no answers. I can't control
dialog: it... and now I don't care. I
dialog: truly, deeply love you, and before
dialog: we die I want you to know.
dialog: PADME leans toward ANAKIN. By straining hard, it is just possible for
dialog: their lips to meet. They kiss.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I have no desire to be cured of
dialog: this love either. Long or short,

text: From different gates around the arena, THREE MONSTERS are driven in. One is a REEK (bull-like), one is a NEXU (lion-like), and one is an ACKLAY (a kind of dino-lobster). They are driven in by PICADORS carrying long spears and riding ORRAYS. The PICADORS poke the MONSTERS toward the center, then retire to the perimeter.
text: The MONSTERS toss their heads, looking around, ROARING or SCREECHING. Then they catch sight of the THREE CAPTIVES and start moving toward them.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Take the one the left. I'll
dialog: take the one on the right.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: What about Padme?
text: PADME has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to the top of the post. Within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: It looks like she's already on top
dialog: of things.
text: The REEK charges ANAKIN. He jumps up, and the beast hits the post hard. ANAKIN lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain around its horn. The REEK backs off, shaking its head angrily, which tears the chain from the post
text: OBI-WAN ducks around the post as the ACKLAY charges. It knocks the post flat, sending OBI-WAN sprawling. The ACKLAY crunches the post between its claws, freeing the chain. OBI-WAN leaps up and runs towards ONE of the PICADORS. The ACKLAY taks off after him.
text: The NEXU arrives at PADME'S post and rears on its hind legs. One top, PADME struggles to tear the chain free. The NEXU ROARS, displaying wicked, dripping fangs.
dialog: In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY beams and rubs his hands.
text: In the arena, OBI-WAN runs at the PICADOR. The ORRAY rears up. OBI-WAN grabs the PICADOR'S long spear and pole vaults over him. The chasing ACKLAY smashes into the ORRAY. It goes down. The PICADOR tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the ACKLAY and crunched.
text: ANAKIN's REEK starts to buck. It charges around the arena with ANAKIN hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the REEK's mouth. Its jaws clamp hard on the chain. ANAKIN yanks hard on the chain, turning the REEK, beginning to ride it.
text: The NEXU's claws dig deep into the post. The cat-like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at PADME. She turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw marks across her back. She hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. Then, PADME jumps off the post into the air. She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand.
dialog: In the archducal box:
speaker_heading: NUTE GUNRAY
dialog: Foul!! She can't do that... shoot
dialog: her or something!
text: In the arena, OBI-WAN runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and throws the spear at the ACKLAY, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a terrible SCREECH and turns on him. The NEXU springs up and makes to leap up at PADME again. She finally manages to work the chain loose. ANAKIN comes charging up on the REEK.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: You okay?
dialog: PADME
dialog: (nods, gasping)
dialog: Sure! Well, sort of.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Jump!!!
text: The NEXU springs. PADME leaps from the top of the post to land on the REEK in front of ANAKIN. He hauls her upright. The REEK charges away, around the arena. The NEXU bounds after it. The REEK passes the wounded ACKLAY. The NEXU smells the blood and turns aside to attack the ACKLAY. The TWO MONSTERS fight. The crowd GROANS and BOOS.
dialog: In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY turns angrily to COUNT DOOKU.
speaker_heading: NUTE GUNRAY
dialog: This isn't how it's supposed to
dialog: be! Jango, finish her off.
dialog: COUNT DOOKU motions for the bounty hunter to ptay put. BOBA FETT is enjoying the spectacle.
speaker_heading: COUNT DOOKU
dialog: (smiling enigmatically)
dialog: Patiece, Viceroy... she will die.
dialog: Maybe this is the way it's
dialog: supposed to end.
text: OBI-WAN runs and jumps on the back of the REEK behind ANAKIN. Across the arena, the NEXU, having chewed up the ACKLAY, starts to advance toward them.

dialog: EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
text: In the archducal box, amid the uproar, COUNT DOOKU feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns to see MACE WINDU standing behind him. COUNT DOOKU masks his surprise elegantly as he surveys the arena and sees JEDI KNIGHTS standing at every entrance and exit.
speaker_heading: COUNT DOOKU
dialog: Master Windu, how pleasant of you
dialog: to join us. You're just in time
dialog: for the moment of truth. I would
dialog: think these two new boys of yours
dialog: could use a little more training.
dialog: MACE WINDU
dialog: Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku.
dialog: This party's over.
text: MACE WINDU signals, and at stategic places around the arena there are sudden flashes of light as about ONE HUNDRED JEDI switch on their lightsabers. The crowd is suddenly silent. COUNT DOOKU'S lips curl in slight amusement.
speaker_heading: COUNT DOOKU
dialog: (to Mace Windu)
dialog: Brave, but stupid, my old Jedi
dialog: friend. You're impossibly
dialog: outnumbered.
dialog: MACE WINDU
dialog: I don't think so. One Jedi has to
dialog: be worth a hundred Geonosians.
dialog: COUNT DOOKU looks around the great theater. His smile grows.
speaker_heading: COUNT DOOKU
dialog: It wasn't the Geonosians I was
dialog: thinking about. How well do you
dialog: think one Jedi will hold up
dialog: against a thousand battle droids?
text: COUNT DOOKU signals. THOUSANDS OF DROIDS start to pour into all parts of the arena.
text: MACE WINDU draws his lightsaber, JANGO FETT draws his guns and fires at MACE WINDU, who deflects the shots. JANGO FETT and MACE WINDU jump into the arena, where they fight. BOBA FETT wacthes his Dad and the Jedi Master fight. The battle beginss. GEONOSIANS fly away everywhere. DROIDS fire at JEDI, who deflect the bolts and cult down the DROIDS. The GEONOSIAN TROOPS fire ray guns that are more difficult for the JEDI to deflect.
text: The REEK and the NEXU are spooked by the battle. The REEK bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena, trampling DROIDS and JEDI that have moved into its path. PADME picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight. SEVERAL JEDI run to the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to OBI-WAN and ANAKIN.
text: Among the crowd, JEDI cut down swaths of GEONOSIANS and DROIDS. On the sand, JEDI fight, attacking DROIDS. OBI0WAN and ANAKIN swing their lightsabers, cutting DROIDS in half. PADME blasts away at DROIDS and GEONOSIANS.
dialog: INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP
dialog: ARTOO whistles.
dialog: C-3PO
dialog: I don't hear anything.
dialog: (Artoo beeps)
dialog: You're scaring me! Stop imagining
dialog: things!
dialog: EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
text: Among the tiers, JEDI are slowly being driven back. They have killed heaps of GEONOSIANS and have kncoked out piles of DROIDS, but sheer numbers are telling. Individual JEDI are being cut down or blasted/ The rest are retreating into the arena.
text: ANAKIN and PADME are back-to-back, fighting DROIDS and flying GEONOSIANS. MACE WINDU fights fiercely with JANGO FETT. Finally, the bounty hunter falls. His helmet goes flying, bouncing down the steps, tumbling and rolling, kicked here and there by random feet. The bounty hunter's body falls to the ground.
text: MACE WINDU runs to the center of the arena and fights back-to-back with OBI-WAN, as they swipe and mangle DROIDS.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Someone's got to - shut down -
dialog: these droids.
dialog: MACE WINDU
dialog: Don't worry! It's being - taken

dialog: EXT. GEONOSIS, FEDERATION STARSHIP - DAY
text: KI-ADI-MUNDI leads a raiding party of about TWENTY JEDI through the lines of parked Battle Starships. They cut a swath through masses of DROIDS until they arrive at the Command Starship. Some JEDI fall. The rest cut their way up the ramps and into the Command Ship.
scene_heading: INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CORRIDORS - DAY
text: KI-ADI-MUNDI and teh surviving JEDI fight their way through the corridors of the Command Ship, deflecting laser bolts, slicing DROIDS.
scene_heading: INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CONTROL BRIDGE - DAY
text: THEY burst onto the bridge and chop down the COMMAND DROIDS. The NEIMOIDIANS flee in all directions. KE-ADI-MUNDI leans over the control panel. He locates the illuminated master switch and punches down on it. It goes dark. Instantly, all the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena FREEZE!
text: There is a moment of stunned silence, then the JEDI CHEER. One the bridge, PLO KOON claps KI-ADI-MUNDI on the back.
speaker_heading: PLO KOON
dialog: We've done it! Now we have a
dialog: chance!
text: Suddenly, there is a harsh BEEPING SOUND. All the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena start fighting again! KI-ADI-MUNDI stares in disbelief and dismay.
speaker_heading: KI-ADI-MUNDI
dialog: The system's off but they're still
dialog: active. That's a new feature. They
dialog: are independent of the control
dialog: system.
dialog: EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
text: MACE WINDU, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, PADME and an exhausted group of about TWENTY JEDI stand in the center of the arena surrounded by a ring of BATTLE DROIDS. The bloodied sand around them is strewn with the bodies of DEAD GEONOSIANS, SHATTERED DROIDS and JEDI.
text: At the foot of some steps, BOBA FETT finds his father's battered helmet. He picks it up.
text: KI-ADI-MUNDI and the SURVIVORS from the raiding party are herded into the arena by SUPERDROIDS. From the encircling tiers above, THOUSANDS OF BATTLE DROIDS level their weapons menacingly.
text: In the archducal box, COUNT DOOKU lifts his hand. The DROIDS lower their weapons. The COUNT calls out to the JEDI.
speaker_heading: COUNT DOOKU
dialog: Master Windu!
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: COUNT DOOKU
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You have fought gallantly. Worthy
dialog: of recognition in the history
dialog: archives of the Jedi Order. Now
dialog: it is finished.
dialog: (pauses briefly)
dialog: Surrender - and your lives will be
dialog: spared.
dialog: MACE WINDU
dialog: We will not be hostages for you to
dialog: barter with Dooku.
speaker_heading: COUNT DOOKU
dialog: Then, I'm sorry, old friend. You
dialog: will have to be destroyed.
text: The DROIDS raise their weapons. ANAKIN and PADME clasps hands tightly. COUNT DOOKU raises his hand to give the order to fire. PADME looks up suddenlt and whispers to ANAKIN.
dialog: PADME
dialog: Look!
text: Above, six Gunships are descending fast through the open area in the arena ceiling. They land in a cluster around the handful of JEDI. CLONE TROOPERS spill out and start firing at the DROIDS. There is a hellstorm of laserfire that bounces off the laser shields created by the Gunships. YODA appears at the door of one of the Gunships.
dialog: YODA
dialog: Come on - hurry! Hurry!
text: The SURVIVING JEDI dash to the Gunships and scramble in. MACE WINDU hangs on tight as the Gunship, firing all its weapons, rises out of the arena up and over the topmost rim.
scene_heading: EXT. GEONOSIS, TERRAIN OUTSIDE EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
text: The massed lines of parked Federation Starships and the DROIDS surrounding the arena, are themselves surrounded by thousands of Republic Starships, disgorging TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPERS. Beyond, more Republic Starships are landing and spewing out troops.
dialog: INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE - DAY
dialog: MACE WINDU stares at the incredible sight.
dialog: YODA
dialog: More battalions to the left.
dialog: Encircle them we must, then
dialog: divide.
text: The CLONE TROOPERS open fire with artillery. EXPLOSIONS wreck the parked Battle Starships. CLONE TROOPERS advance, firing at the massed DROIDS. FIGHTER DROIDS fly overhead, exchanging fire with the Gunships and JEDI fighters.
dialog: INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAY
dialog: THREEPIO and ARTOO see flashes outside of the ship, exploding everywhere.
dialog: C-3PO
dialog: I'm sure I heard something, this
dialog: time. Didn't you? It's probably
dialog: just a celebration
dialog: ARTOO lets out an EXHAUSTED BLEEP.
dialog: EXT. BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE - DAY
text: Gunship #2 skims the battlefield, firing down, deflecting answering fire from the droids.
dialog: INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO - DAY
text: OBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PADME are at the open sides of the Gunship. CLONES fire down at the DROIDS below.
text: The Gunship slows, circling over a droid gun-emplacement. It blasts it, but suddenly the Gunship is rocked by a near miss. It lurches violently.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Hold on! Look over there...
text: Through the other side of the Gunship, they see a Geonosian Speeder racing past. In the open cockpit is the unmistakable figure of COUNT DOOKU.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: It's Dooku, go after him!
text: The PILOT starts to comply, but... there is a HUGE BLASTS, the ship lurches on its side, and PADME tumbles out.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Padme!!!
dialog: ANAKIN stares down in horror as PADME hits thr ground below.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: (continuing; to pilot)
dialog: Put the ship down! Down!
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: No! Forget her. We have to go
dialog: after Dooku.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: No we're not!! Land this ship!
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Don't let your personal feelings
dialog: get in the way. We've got a job to
dialog: do.
dialog: Below, PADME hauls herself to her feet and waves for them to go after DOOKU.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I don't care!.. Go back.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Anakin! She's all right! Look.
dialog: ANAKIN stares out to see PADME rescued by CLONE TROOPERS.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Follow that speeder!
text: On the ground, PADME looks up at Gunship #2 as it speeds away after Count Dooku. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN follow the speeder to a Geonosian tower. The speeder decsends rapidly; the Gunship follows.
text: Count Dooku's speeder parks outside the tower; the Gunship parks next to it. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN leap down and run inside the tower.
dialog: INT. GEONOSIS, SECRET HANGER TOWER - LATE DAY
text: COUNT DOOKU throws switches on a control panel. His Interstellar Sail Ship is guarded by a SQUAD OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The doors of the exit-port slide open.
speaker_heading: DROID CAPTAIN
dialog: Your Excellency!
text: COUNT DOOKU turns as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN run in through the hanger doors. They draw their lightsabers. The DROIDS raise their weapons.
speaker_heading: COUNT DOOKU
dialog: That won't be necessary, Captain.
dialog: Stand down. And leave them to me.
text: The DROIDS lower their weapons and back off to the walls. COUNT DOOKU looks at OBI-WAN and ANAKIN with slight amusement.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (to Anakin)
dialog: We move in together - you slowly
dialog: on the...
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I'm taking him now!
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Anakin, no!
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: You'll pay for all the Jedi you've
dialog: killed today, Dooku.
text: ANAKIN charges across the open space at COUNT DOOKU, who smiles faintly, watching him come. ANAKIN raises his lightsaber. At the last moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm, and ANAKIN is lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU moves toward OBI-WAN
speaker_heading: COUNT DOOKU
dialog: Kenobi, isn't it? As you can see,
dialog: my Jedi powers are far beyond
dialog: yours. Now, back down.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: I don't think so.
dialog: OBI-WAN lifts his lightsaber. COUNT DOOKU smiles.
speaker_heading: COUNT DOOKU
dialog: Ah, but if I must.
dialog: COUNT DOOKU draws his lightsaber. He and OBI-WAN start to circle each other.
speaker_heading: COUNT DOOKU
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I have spent the last ten years
dialog: learning to use the power of the
dialog: Dark Side. It gives me infinitely
dialog: greater power.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: You will have to prove it.
text: OBI-WAN comes in fast, swinging at COUNT DOOKU'S head. DOOKU parries the cut easily. As they fight, it quickly becomes clear that DOOKU is the complete swordsman - elegant, graceful, classical - a master of the old style.
speaker_heading: COUNT DOOKU
dialog: Grand Master Kenobi, you
dialog: disappoint me. Yoda holds you in
dialog: such high esteem.
dialog: COUNT DOOKU parried another cut.
speaker_heading: COUNT DOOKU
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Surely you can do better...?
dialog: (parries)
dialog: No, I'm surprised. Has Jedi
dialog: swordsmanship degenerated so
dialog: quickly, or are you trying to make
dialog: fun of me?
dialog: (cuts)
dialog: Which is it?
text: COUNT DOOKU thrusts. OBI-WAN steps back quickly, panting for breath.
speaker_heading: COUNT DOOKU
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me
dialog: out of my misery.
text: OBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back. Then Dooku's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBI-WAN to retreat.
text: COUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes.
text: OBI-WAN is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh. He stumbles back against the wall, trips, and falls. His lightsaber goes skittering across the floor.
text: COUNT DOOKU raises his lightsaber. OBI-WAN looks up helplessly. Dooku's lightsaber flashes down and CLASHES against - Anakin's lightsaber! COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN stare eyeball to eyeball.
speaker_heading: COUNT DOOKU
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: That's brave of you, boy - but
dialog: foolish. I would have thought
dialog: you'd have learnt your lesson.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: I'm a slow learner.
text: And ANAKIN charges at COUNT DOOKU. The force of his attack catches the Count slightly off balance. Anakin's lightsaber flashes. COUNT DOOKU draws back, putting a hand to his arm. He takes the hand away and looks at the smear of blood whee Anakin has nicked him.
speaker_heading: COUNT DOOKU
dialog: You have unusual powers, young
dialog: Padawan. But not enought to save
dialog: you this time.
speaker_heading: ANAKIN
dialog: Don't bet on it!
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: Anakin!
text: OBI-WAN uses the Force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to ANAKIN. With TWO LIGHTSABERS, ANAKIN attacks. COUNT DOOKU parries and ripostes. It is no contest. ANAKIN is driven back against the wall. He loses one lightsaber. Finally COUNT DOOKU, in one flashing move, sends Anakin's arm, cut at the elbow, flying still gripping his lightsaber. ANAKIN drops to the ground in agony. COUNT DOOKU draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace.
text: Suddenly, the great doors slide open. The DROIDS turn fast, raising their weapons. Through the thick smoke, emerges the heroic figure of YODA. He stops on the smoke-filled threashold, FOUR DROIDS lined up on either side of him, guns pointed.
text: Before the DROIDS can get off a shot, YODA raises his hand, and the DROIDS are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in heaps of smoking metal.
text: Silence. COUNT DOOKU steps away from ANAKIN to face the Jedi Grand Master. His lightsaber whirls in a formal salute.
speaker_heading: COUNT DOOKU
dialog: Master Yoda. At last we shall
dialog: know who is the most powerful.
dialog: YODA draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane. He salutes formally.
dialog: YODA
dialog: Count Dooku. No interest in
dialog: contests, do I have.
text: COUNT DOOKU charges across the space at YODA. He rains down blows upon the tiny figure. YODA doesn't budge an inch. For the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that Dooku aims. Nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. His energy drains. His strokes become feebler, slower.
text: YODA attacks! He flies forward. COUNT DOOKU is forced to retreat. Wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda's speed and swordplay. His lightsaber his a humming blur of light.
text: Count Dooku's lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. He staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel. YODA jumps onto DOOKU'S shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber into the top of the Count's head.
dialog: YODA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: The end for you, Count, this is.
speaker_heading: COUNT DOOKU
dialog: ...Not yet...
text: COUNT DOOKU raises his arms and knocks YODA off his shoulders and then, with all his might, he uses the Force to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger. It comes crashing down on OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. But in the blink of and eye, YODA is under the crane, holding it up, using the Force. YODA closes his eyes and concentrates.
text: ANAKIN is unconscious, and OBI0WAN tries toget out from under the crane. The fallen crane trembles and starts to life. Behind it, the sound of the Sail Ship's engines are heard starting up.
text: YODA concentrates harder. Slowly, the crane rises. The SOUND OF THE ENGINES increases. YODA exerts every scrap of his powers. The crane lifts clear of ANAKIN and is thrown to the ground. DOOKU'S Sail Ship takes off. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN struggle to the exhausted YODA, but it's too late. The Sail Ship rises into the air and flies away. PADMÉ and a CLONE CAPTAIN with about TEN TROOPERS appear in the doorway.
dialog: PADMÉ
dialog: Anakin!
text: PADMÉ runs too him and throws her arms around him. ANAKIN is barely able to stand up. The CLONE CAPTAIN marches up to YODA, stops, and salutes smartly.
speaker_heading: CLONE CAPTAIN
dialog: Resistance is at an end, General.
dialog: What are your orders ?
dialog: YODA looks at him and sighs.
dialog: EXT. CORUSCANT, OLD TOWN - DAWN
text: COUNT DOOKU'S Interstellar Sail Ship glides through a deserted, burned-out part of Coruscant. COUNT DOOKU manoeuvres the ship into one of the empty buildings and lands.
scene_heading: INT. CORUSCANT, SECRET LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN
text: The ramp lowers. COUNT DOOKU emerges and walks to where the hooded figure of DARTH SIDIOUS stands waiting. COUNT DOOKU bows.
speaker_heading: COUNT DOOKU

dialog: Where is your apprentice?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: On his way back to Naboo. He is

text: They are standing, looking out through the tall windows at the great plaza below. YODA sits in his chair.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I must admit without the clones,
dialog: it would not have been a victory.
dialog: YODA
dialog: Victory? Victory, you say?
text: OBI-WAN turns and looks at the sad little Jedi sitting in the Council Chamber. Apart from KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON, who is wounded, the Chamber is empty.
dialog: YODA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Not victory, a defeat, it was...
dialog: Master Obi-Wan. Begun, the Clone
dialog: War has!
scene_heading: EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN - LATE DAY

text: TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS are drawn up in a strict formation or move forwards in near files to climb the ramps of the Military Assault Ships.
text: On the balcony, PALPATINE'S expression is deeply sad. Everyone watches comberly as, in the square, loaded Assault Ships take off. Other land immediately in their place. The sky above is thick with transports. CLONE TROOPS march and board the Ships.
dialog: The Great Clone War has begun...
dialog: FADE OUT:
