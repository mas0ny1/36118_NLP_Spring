scene_heading: HEAD CREDIT SEQUENCE MYSTERIOUS SEWING ROOM - NIGHT,
dialog: 
text: A HAUNTING LULLABY plays against a black, star-pricked
text: sky when something appears in the distance. A BUTTON-EYED
text: DOLL floats towards CAMERA, through the open window of a
text: small sewing room where it lands in a pair of WAITING
text: HANDS, hands that are made of SEWING NEEDLES.
dialog: 
text: The doll - which resembles a YOUNG BLACK GIRL in old-
text: fashioned clothes, hair fixed with ribbons and braids -
text: is placed on a sewing table. An elaborate sewing kit is
text: opened, and, in flickering green light, the NEEDLE-HANDS
text: go to work. The doll's old clothes are cut away; button-
text: eyes torn off; hair pulled out. The doll's stuffing is
text: removed and then the empty cloth body is pulled inside
text: out, turning from NUT BROWN to PALE PINK.
dialog: 
text: Sawdust is poured in the NEW DOLL's mouth; facial
text: features added; blue yarn hair punched in; and then a
text: fresh pair of shiny black button eyes is selected from a
text: button drawer.
dialog: 
text: The transformed doll, in a LITTLE YELLOW RAINCOAT, its
text: new button eyes affixed, is released out the window and
text: BACK INTO THE NIGHT.

scene_heading: EXT PINK PALACE, ASHLAND OREGON - DAY
dialog: 
text: WIDE ANGLE on a rambling old Queen Anne-style house with
text: tacked-on outside stairs. It's late winter, the sky a
text: damp, grey sponge. A SIGN in the foreground reads "Pink
dialog: Palace, Apartment for Rent".
dialog:

dialog: 
text: A BEEPING SOUND begins and he pauses. A tired MOVING VAN
text: backs into frame and up the muddy driveway. A VW BEETLE -
text: suitcases roped to its top - recklessly passes the truck
text: and disappears around the side of the house. Bobinsky
text: shakes his fist angrily after the car and shouts:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Mer-sa-vich!
dialog: 
text: He marches away indignantly. One of the MOVERS, unseen in
text: the truck, speaks to his companion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOVER 2 (O.C.)
dialog: We're here. Time to muscle up.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON moving truck's REAR DOORS as they're wrenched
text: open by two men - MOVER 1, tall and bear-shaped, and
text: MOVER 2, built like a brick top - to reveal a lot of
text: BOXES and BEAT-UP FURNITURE.
dialog: 
text: They haul out the LOADING RAMP towards CAMERA.
dialog: 
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE, EXTERIOR STAIRS to BASEMENT FLAT. APRIL SPINK,

speaker_heading: MOVER 2 (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (EFFORTS)
dialog: Got it? Almost there, just a few more.
dialog: Come on, now, LIFT.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON FRONT PORCH. The job finished, Mover 2 heads
text: down the front steps while Mover 1 waits for a signature
text: from the unseen-but-for-his-hands new tenant. Papers
text: signed, a tip of a single, grubby dollar bill is placed
text: in the outstretched hand of the disappointed mover, and
text: the door is shut.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT HOUSE, REAR VIEW - SAME
dialog: 
text: ANGLE from BACK YARD. Hiding behind shrubs, WE SHARE the
text: POV of a MYSTERIOUS SPY. With a CLICK, a close-up lens is
text: rotated into place to better see the movers quietly pack
text: into the truck and drive away. A MANGY BLACK CAT walks
text: right in front of the lens and looks at us with concern.
text: OFF-SCREEN, a door bangs open. WE FOLLOW the cat as it
text: races up a tree and out a branch towards the BACK PORCH
dialog: to investigate.
dialog: 
text: CORALINE JONES, 11, steps onto the porch in a YELLOW
text: RAINCOAT with a shoulder bag. WE - SPY'S POV - CLICK to a

dialog: 
text: NEW ANGLE, non-spy reverse, on Coraline as she glances
text: furtively over her shoulder, then hops down the steps and
text: moves diagonally away from the house.
dialog: 
text: NEW Angle, SPY POV. We watch Coraline head towards the
text: WOODY SHRUB we've hidden ourselves in. We DUCK DOWN.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE on Coraline, non-spy, shrub by garden gate. She
text: reaches into the shrub and breaks off a FORKED BRANCH.
text: She removes the stick's red leaves, aims it like a
text: DOWSING ROD and heads into the garden.
dialog: 
text: CAM PUSH IN to shrub as the SPY RISES UP, wearing a three-
text: eyed SKELETON MASK on his head and SKELETON GLOVES on his

scene_heading: AFISH POND IN GARDEN - SAME
dialog: 
text: Coraline explores the drained, crumbling pond. She finds
text: an old TURTLE SHELL in the muck and holds it up. After
text: rapping on it to make sure it's empty, she puts the shell
text: into her shoulder bag.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON CAROLINE, SPY POV. WE PUSH ASIDE dead vines from
text: the railing of the GARDEN BRIDGE for a better look.
text: Coraline aims her forked stick once more then follows it
text: up from the pond and out the BACK GATE. A gust of WIND
text: blows DEAD LEAVES into a swirling eddy WE TRACK high up
text: into the air.

scene_heading: ROCKY PATH HIGH ABOVE HOUSE - LITTLE LATER
dialog: 
text: SPY POV on sky, now dark with GATHERING STORM. Hidden
text: behind a NATURAL WALL OF STONES, WE TILT DOWN to view
text: Coraline crossing frame on a STEEP HILLSIDE path. She
text: steps on an old RAILROAD TIE, and her foot SINKS into the
text: rotted wood, stopping her.
dialog: 
text: WE LEAN OUT for a better view, and DISLODGE some stones
text: that roll down past her. WE DUCK as she jerks her head
dialog: our way.
dialog: 
text: NEW ANGLE, non-spy. Unnerved, Coraline calls out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Hello?... Who's there?
dialog: 
text: She throws a rock over the wall of stones, HITS THE
text: UNSEEN SPY, causing a CRY OF PAIN. ANIMAL? HUMAN? Freaked

dialog: 
text: NEW ANGLE, SPY POV. We rise up to watch and the black cat
text: hops onto the stone wall.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OVERGROWN ORCHARD - CONT.
dialog: 
text: Coraline races down past an OLD TRACTOR and into an
text: ORCHARD. WIND begins to blow.
dialog: 
text: NEW ANGLE as we move beside Coraline through the old
text: apple trees, where she nearly trips on the tongue of a
dialog: harvest cart.
dialog: 
text: DOWN ANGLE ON on Coraline as she BACKS INTO a circle of
text: TOADSTOOLS in front of a STUMP. BREATHING HARD, she looks
text: out for her pursuer.
dialog: 
text: NEW ANGLE. The black cat shoots past Coraline in the tall
text: grass. She can't see him but she knows something is
text: there. Already behind her now, the cat LEAPS onto the
text: stump with a loud, warning MEROWWW!
dialog: 
text: STARTLED, Coraline YELLS and whips around. She's both
text: angry and relieved when she sees it's just some cat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: You scared me to death, you mangy thing!
dialog: 
text: Cat GLARES at her with BLUE OPAL EYES, makes a low growl
text: as she stands. She exhales.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm just looking for an old well. Know
dialog: it?
dialog: 
text: Cat BLINKS EYES slowly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE(CONT'D)
dialog: Not talking, huh?
dialog: 
text: The wind picks up. She grasps the forks of her stick,
text: closes her eyes, and, tracing a figure eight above her,
speaker_heading: SAYS:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Magic dowser, magic dowser: show... me...
dialog: the well!
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON CORALINE FROM HIGH BLUFF. The SPY moves into
text: frame, astride some kind of MOTOR-BIKE. He presses a
text: button on the handlebars and BLASTS a loud AIR HORN.
text: STARTLED, Coraline SPINS around.
dialog: 
text: UP ANGLE ON SPY. As LIGHTNING FLASHES and THUNDER ROLLS,
text: Coraline sees him for the first time. With his turret-
text: lensed SKULL MASK and SKELETON GLOVES and black FIREMAN'S
text: COAT flapping in the wind, he looks like a PSYCHO KILLER!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: (freaked out)
speaker_heading: AHHHHH!
dialog: 
text: He REVS his motor, pops a wheelie, then SWOOPS DOWN the
text: bluff towards her. She HOLLERS IN FEAR, then tries to
text: WHACK HIM with her forked stick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: GET AWAY FROM ME--
dialog: 
text: He SNATCHES it from her as he passes, KNOCKING HER to the
text: ground. He SIDE-SKIDS his bike, hops off and JUMPS UP
text: onto the stump. Looking TEN FEET TALL from the ground,
text: THUNDER AND LIGHTNING at a peak, the Spy turns his THREE-
text: EYED TURRET LENS and studies her like a predatory alien.
dialog: 
text: And then, the thunder and lightning just FADE OUT and
text: this psycho-killer, three-eyed spy pulls off his mask and
text: Coraline GASPS -- he's just a short kid in a costume.
dialog: 
text: Shoulders hunched, neck bent, the Spy - real name WYBIE
text: LOVAT - aged 12 - examines Coraline's forked stick, aims
dialog: it around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE
speaker_heading: (OBLIVIOUS)
dialog: Hoo! Let me guess, you're from Texas or
text: Utah; someplace dried out and barren,
dialog: right? I heard about water-witching
dialog: before but it doesn't make sense; I mean,
dialog: it's just an ordinary branch.
dialog: 
text: Coraline, SNATCHES it from his GLOVED HANDS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
speaker_heading: (ENRAGED)
dialog: IT'S A DOWSING ROD!
dialog: 
text: Coraline smacks Wybie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: Ow!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: And I DON'T LIKE BEING STALKED, not by
scene_heading: PSYCHO-NERDS OR THEIR CATS!
dialog: 
text: He crouches, nervous, to scratch the cat behind his ears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: He's not really my cat; he's kinda feral
dialog: ­ you know, wild? Of course, I do feed
dialog: him every night and sometimes he'll come
dialog: in my window `n bring me little dead
dialog: things.
dialog: 
text: The cat PURRS like a diesel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
speaker_heading: (TOUGH)
dialog: Look, I'm from Pontiac.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: MICHIGAN? And if I'm a "water witch",
speaker_heading: THEN--
dialog: (points stick, stomps foot)
dialog: --where's the secret WELL?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: You stomp too hard and you'll fall in it!
dialog: 
text: Coraline reacts, hops out of the springy circle. The boy
text: scrapes at the ground, revealing a CIRCULAR COVERING
text: made of WOODEN PLANKS. He wedges a fallen branch under
text: one side, and, using a rock for the fulcrum, pries up the
dialog: covering.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE (CONT'D)
dialog: See? Supposed to be so deep if you fell
dialog: to the bottom and looked up, you'd see a
text: sky full of stars in the middle of the
dialog: day.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
speaker_heading: (SOFTENS)
dialog: Huh.
dialog: 
text: Her frown RELAXES and the black cat tilts his head,
text: noticing her change in tone. He steps off the branch, and
text: the well cover thumps in place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: Surprised she let you move in...
dialog: 
text: Jerks his head toward the pink house in distance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... my Gramma. She owns the "Pink Palace"
dialog: (indicates house in distance)
dialog: Won't rent to people with kids.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: (suddenly worried)
dialog: Uh... I'm not supposed to talk about it.
dialog: 
text: Changing the subject, he lifts a gloved hand to shake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm Wybie, Wybie Lovat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
speaker_heading: (SKEPTICAL)
dialog: Wybie?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: Short for Wyborne. Not my idea, of
dialog: course. What'd you get saddled with?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: I wasn't saddled with anything. It's
dialog: Coraline.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: Caroline what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Coraline. Coraline Jones.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: (confused, not hearing it)
dialog: Hmmm... It's not real scientific, but I
dialog: heard an ordinary name, like Caroline --
dialog: 
text: Her face goes as DARK as the rain clouds above.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE (CONT'D)
dialog: -- can lead people to have ordinary
dialog: expectations about a person--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)
dialog: (calling from afar)
dialog: Wyborne!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: I think I heard someone calling you,
dialog: Wyborne.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: What? I didn't hear anything--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Oh, I definitely heard someone, Why-were-
dialog: you-born.
dialog: 
text: A distant dinner bell clangs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)
dialog: Wyborne!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: (under his breath, nervous)
dialog: Grandma!
dialog: 
text: He holds up his hands in surrender, nodding with eyes
text: closed, forcing some laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Heh. Well, great to meet a Michigan
dialog: water witch.
dialog: 
text: He picks up his bike, wheels it around, then holds up his
text: gloved hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE (CONT'D)
dialog: But I'd wear gloves next time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
speaker_heading: (SKEPTICAL)
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
text: He points to her dowsing rod, nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE (CONT'D)
dialog: `Cause that dowsing rod of yours? Uh,
dialog: it's poison oak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Ehh!!
dialog: 
text: Coraline drops the stick as he zooms away and wipes her
text: hands on her clothes.
dialog: 
text: The cat merows at her, shaking his head with a pitying
text: look, then trots away after Wybie. She STICKS OUT HER
text: TONGUE at him.
dialog: 
text: She looks down at the COVERING to the well. Coraline
text: finds a PEBBLE and drops it through A SMALL KNOT-HOLE.
text: Ear at the knot-hole, she counts until there's a watery
text: "plop" far below. FAT RAINDROPS start to fall around her.

scene_heading: ROTATE DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING
dialog: 
text: It's POURING out. Coraline looks out a window at the DEAD-
text: LOOKING GARDEN, and places PACKETS OF SEEDS - pumpkins,
text: squash, snap dragons, bleeding hearts - on the sill.
text: She's developed a REDDISH RASH - poison oak - on one
dialog: hand.
dialog: 
text: The main floor kitchen, like most things in the Pink
text: Palace, is barely maintained, and looks worn and faded.
text: Coraline's MOTHER, MEL JONES, 40, bangs away at her
text: laptop on the table, MOVING BOXES stacked nearby. She's
text: plain-looking and tired and wears a NECK-BRACE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: I almost fell down a well yesterday, Mom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEL
dialog: (not listening)
dialog: Uh huh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: I would have died.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEL
dialog: (continues typing)
dialog: That's nice.
dialog: 
text: Coraline scratches the rash on her hand, changes subject.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Hmmm. So can I go out? I think it's
dialog: perfect weather for gardening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEL
dialog: No, Coraline. Rain makes mud. Mud makes a
dialog: mess.
dialog: 
text: Coraline turns to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: But Mom, I want stuff growing when my
dialog: friends come to visit. Isn't that why we
dialog: moved here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEL
dialog: Something like that. But then we had the
dialog: accident.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Wasn't my fault you hit that truck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEL
dialog: I never said it was.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
speaker_heading: (MUTTERS)
dialog: I can't believe it -- you and Dad get
dialog: paid to write about plants and you hate
dialog: dirt.
dialog: 
text: Mel stops typing, loses her patience.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEL
dialog: Coraline, I don't have time for you right
dialog: now. And you still have unpacking to do.
text: Lots of unpacking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: That sounds exciting.
dialog: 
text: Mel remembers something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: Mel (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh - some kid left this on the front
dialog: porch.
dialog: 
text: Coraline walks over and is handed a NEWSPAPER-WRAPPED
text: PACKAGE. Attached note reads:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE (V.O.)
dialog: Hey Jonesy, look what I found in Gramma's
dialog: trunk. Look familiar? Wybie.

speaker_heading: CORALINE

dialog:

scene_heading: INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: CORALINE

scene_heading: INT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - SAME

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE

scene_heading: INT. HALL - SAME

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

dialog: 
text: Coraline grabs the door's edge and pulls it open. Instead

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
text: She looks around, notices the painting over the

dialog: 
text: From across the hall, warm light comes from the kitchen

speaker_heading: MR. BOBINSKY
dialog: They are saying: do not go through leetle

dialog: 
text: Coraline is startled.

speaker_heading: CORALINE

text: waits. Nothing. She glances down at the doormat - it
dialog: reads "No whistling in the house."
dialog: 
text: She peers through the door glass. A YAPPING DOG suddenly
text: LEAPS UP inside, startling her, and a moment after, MISS
text: SPINK ­ wearing some sort of house robe ­ opens the door
text: and three SCOTTIE DOGS ­ HAMISH, JOCK, AND ANGUS ­ shoot

speaker_heading: MISS SPINK
dialog: It's the new neighbor, Miriam - Caroline?

dialog: 
text: Coraline reaches for a pink and green one. But the taffy

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
dialog: No, not all of it, not all of it. That's
dialog: right, now hand it over.
dialog: 
text: Coraline passes her the cup. Spink puts a saucer on top

speaker_heading: MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh... Caroline, Caroline, Caroline; you

speaker_heading: MISS SPINK
speaker_heading: (OMINOUS)
dialog: I see a very peculiar hand...

speaker_heading: MISS FORCIBLE
text: I see a giraffe.

speaker_heading: MISS SPINK

speaker_heading: MISS SPINK
dialog: Never wear green in your dressing room.

speaker_heading: MISS FORCIBLE
dialog: Acquire a very tall step ladder.

dialog: 
text: Behind her, a PERISCOPE RISES from the WAIST-DEEP FOG.
text: Coraline just catches it in her peripheral view.
dialog: 
text: She frowns but doesn't let on she's aware of it. She
text: walks ahead nonchalantly, the periscope following her,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: Owwwwwwww!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
text: Great, the village stalker.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: Ow. I - I wasn't stalking you. We're

dialog: 
text: Wybie takes some SALAD TONGS from a tool belt, snaps
dialog: them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: What d'ya mean, "we?"
dialog: 
text: There's a soft meowing from under his coat. He opens it
text: up and the BLACK CAT EMERGES and climbs onto his
dialog: shoulders.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ha! Your cat's not wild, he's a wuss-
dialog: puss!
dialog:

dialog: What? He hates to get his feet wet. Geez.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
speaker_heading: (MOCKING)
dialog: Wuss-puss...
dialog: 
text: Tired of her company, the cat jumps off Wybie, onto a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: So... that doll. Did you make it look
dialog: like me?
dialog: 
text: Wybie, scanning under the ground fog for slugs, sticks
text: his head up for a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: Oh no; I found it that way. It's older

speaker_heading: CORALINE

speaker_heading: CORALINE

dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
text: He looks from the slug to himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: I meant my parents; they don't listen to
dialog: me either.
dialog: 
text: Wybie nods, not listening again, takes his camera --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: Uh huh... You mind?
dialog: 
text: -- hands it to her. She acts put-out, but frames a shot.
text: He signals he's ready and she fires off one auto-flash
text: shot after another as he strikes silly poses making SOUND
text: EFFECTS: horrified of the slug one moment; ready to eat
text: it the next; pretending it's something from his nose in
text: another. She can't help but GIGGLE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Ew!
dialog: 
text: Finished, Wybie tosses the slug back into the fog, and
text: takes the camera back. He lowers his head, thoughtful,

speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: That's nonsense. He can't talk.
dialog:

speaker_heading: CORALINE

dialog: 
scene_heading: OTHER MISS SPINK
dialog: Beware of old oysters, too large in the

dialog: UP.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: I'm... I'm going to bed! RIGHT NOW!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER MOTHER
speaker_heading: (WOUNDED)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: I'm really, really tired. Yeah...
dialog: (fakes huge yawn)
dialog: I just need to sleep on things.
dialog: 
text: Other Mother stands, masking disappointment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER MOTHER
dialog: Well of course you do, darling... I'll be
dialog: happy to tuck you in.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: (palms out, forced smile)
dialog: Oh, no thanks, uh, you-you've done so
dialog: much already--
dialog: 
text: She turns to leave and finds the Other Mother BLOCKING

dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER MOTHER
dialog: You're welcome. And I ­
dialog: (smiles to Other Father)
dialog: we aren't worried at all, darling.
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)
dialog: Soon you'll see things our way.
dialog: 
text: She lets go. She and the Other Father herd Coraline
text: across the hallway to the stairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OTHER HALLWAY, STAIRS, UPPER HALL - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Coraline carefully climbs the stairs, the Other Parents
text: watching. When they can no longer see her, she RACES up
text: the last steps and DASHES to her Other Bedroom.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CORALINE'S OTHER BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
dialog: 
text: Coraline shuts the door and is quickly surrounded by
text: fluttering DRAGONFLIES.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAGIC DRAGONFLY
dialog: What's wrong, Coraline? Don't you want to
dialog: play?
dialog: 
text: She jumps up and CATCHES the paper creatures, opens the
text: TOY CHEST and tosses them in.
dialog: 
text: The PLUSH BLUE SQUID greets her from the shelf, followed
text: by the TOY TANK GIRAFFE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOY SQUID
dialog: Yeah, I wanna hugga your face!
dialog: 
scene_heading: TOY TANK GIRAFFE
dialog: Get a grip, soldier.

speaker_heading: PHOTO FRIEND 1

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHOTO FRIEND 2
dialog: You wanna stay, don'tcha?
dialog: 
text: Coraline grabs them as well, drops them in the chest, and
text: SHUTS the lid. She barricades the door with a DRESSER and
text: CHAIRS and then the TOY CHEST.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: I'm going home tonight, robots - and I
dialog: won't be back.
dialog: 
text: She sits on the bed, pulls off the blue boots then CLIMBS
text: UNDER THE COVERS, pulling them over her head and holding
text: tight. She HUGS herself to stop shaking, knowing she must
text: fall asleep in this bed to wake up in her real bed at
text: home. She closes her eyes and tells herself:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep, go
dialog: to sleep!
dialog: 
text: She tosses one way, then another. WE HEAR her voice
speaker_heading: CONTINUE:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Go to sleep, go to sleep...
dialog: 
text: There are strange, backwards sounds, then the eerie
text: voices of Other Mother and Other Father.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER MOTHER (V.O.)
dialog: There's just one tiny little thing we
dialog: have to do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER FATHER (V.O.)
dialog: So sharp you won't feel a thing...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER MOTHER (V.O.)
dialog: Soon you'll see things our way...
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATCH PULLBACK
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OTHER BEDROOM - LATER
dialog: 
text: We see Coraline's room, BRIGHTLY LIT LIKE MORNING IN THE
scene_heading: REAL WORLD.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON Coraline's face beneath the covers, as she's
text: WOKEN by the light. With a hopeful look, she calls out,
text: pulls back the covers:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Mom!... Dad!..
dialog: 
text: Her smile turns to shock -- there's a BRIGHT, FULL MOON
text: in her window and it's STILL NIGHTTIME IN THE OTHER
text: WORLD.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh God, I'm still here?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OTHER STAIRS, LOWER HALLWAY - SAME
dialog: 
text: Coraline races downstairs to the Other Living Room where
dialog: the little door home must be! But the living room is
text: LOCKED TIGHT. She pulls at the handles, plants a foot and
text: tries with all her might! It's no use. She stops,
text: panting, then hears a piano note being hit over and over.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OTHER FATHER'S STUDY - SAME
dialog: 
text: Coraline opens the door and finds the Other Father
text: sitting at the piano, his back to her, hitting the note.
text: She speaks in her bravest voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Hey you! Where's the Other Mother? I
dialog: want to go home.
dialog: 
text: The Other Father turns around. He looks ill; his hair
text: messed and his glasses askew. He speaks, his voice slowed-
dialog: down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER FATHER
dialog: All will be swell, soon as Mother's
dialog: refreshed. Her strength is our strength.
dialog: 
text: The WHITE-GLOVED HANDS POP OUT from the piano. One COVERS
text: HIS MOUTH, the other WAGS A FINGER in his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Mustn't talk when Mother's not here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: If you won't even talk to me, I'm gonna
dialog: find the Other Wybie. He'll help me.
dialog: 
text: She turns to go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER FATHER
dialog: No point; he pulled a long face...
dialog: 
text: He PULLS DOWN the corners of his mouth impossibly far.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
dialog: ...and Mother didn't like it.
dialog: 
text: The PIANO HANDS pop out again, aggressively SHUT HIS
text: MOUTH and SPIN HIM away from Coraline. Frightened, she
text: runs to the door that leads outside, and pulls it open.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OTHER HOUSE - NIGHT, FULL MOON
dialog: 
text: She runs out the back porch, towards the Other Garden.
dialog: 
scene_heading: OTHER STEEP HILLSIDE TRAIL
dialog: 
text: She crosses the trail, the Other House in the distance.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ENTRANCE TO OTHER ORCHARD
dialog: 
text: She runs down the path.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER ORCHARD
dialog: 
text: Coraline runs past trees that are LUSH WITH GREEN LEAVES
text: AND RIPE RED FRUIT.
dialog: 
text: She's panting hard, and has to slow to a fast walk. The
text: further she goes, the LESS TREE-LIKE the fruit trees
dialog: become.
dialog: 
text: She hears the CAT MEROWWW. Surprised, she looks down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: And what do you think you're doing?
dialog: 
text: The cat trots along by her feet. She blinks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Well, I'm gettin' outta here. That's what
dialog: I'M doing.
dialog: 
text: The sky starts to BRIGHTEN and the apple trees become
scene_heading: WIRE-THIN SHAPES OF TREES.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Huh? Something's wrong. Shouldn't the
dialog: old well be here?
dialog: 
text: The remnants of the trees and the sky and the ground give
text: way to a PALE, EMPTY NOTHINGNESS. No ground or shadows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: Nothing out here ... it's the empty part
dialog: of this world. She only made what she
dialog: knew would impress you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: But why? Why does she want me?
dialog: 
text: They walk over the horizon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT (cont'd)
dialog: She wants something to love, I think.
dialog: Something that isn't her... Or maybe
dialog: she'd just love something to eat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Eat? That's ridiculous, mothers don't eat
dialog: daughters!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: I don't know. How do you taste?
dialog: 
scene_heading: OTHER HOUSE REAPPEARS
dialog: 
text: A SHAPE RISES in front of them in the whiteness and
text: becomes the beautiful OTHER HOUSE. Coraline and the cat
text: slow, then the front yard and topiary, the sky, hills,
text: white gravel drive and the poplar trees behind them FILL
dialog: IN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Huh? But how can you walk away from
dialog: something and still come back to it?
dialog: 
text: The cat curls its tail into a question mark, and tips its
text: head to one side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: Walk around the world.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Small world.
dialog: 
text: Coraline shivers. The cat suddenly TENSES, focuses on a
dialog: shrub.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: Hang on--
dialog: 
text: He bounds towards the shrub and chases out a CUTE
text: KANGAROO MOUSE in uniform with a TINY TRUMPET. Before
text: Coraline can blink, he's PINNED IT DOWN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Stop, he's one of the circus mice!
dialog: 
text: With a SWIFT BLOW of its paw, the cat KNOCKS the mouse
text: into the air, and catches it in his mouth. He gives a
text: QUICK, KILLING BITE - CORALINE GASPS - and the mouse
text: TRANSFORMS into a BIG DEAD RAT. Coraline is stunned. He
text: drops the rat on the ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: I don't like rats at the best of times,
dialog: but this one was sounding an alarm.
dialog: 
text: The cat picks the rat up and heads off. Slack-jawed,
text: Coraline speaks with admiration.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Gooooood kitty.
dialog: 
text: Coraline looks to the house with a determined look.
dialog: 
text: On the porch, she takes out a HEAVY CANE from the
text: UMBRELLA STAND and hits it into her hand.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE, OTHER HALLWAY - SAME
dialog: 
text: Coraline, standing in front of the living room doors,
text: TESTS the cane in her hands, and peers down the hall for
text: danger. It's dead quiet -- no piano, no sounds of
dialog: anything.
dialog: 
text: She JAMS the cane through the doors' handles, and PULLS
text: with all her might. One HANDLE AND LOCK BREAK and the
text: door swings open into the pitch black living room. The
text: hall light casts a narrow path directly to the Other
text: Little Door on the far wall, cracked open. She steps into
dialog: the room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: A huge ARMOIRE BUG suddenly crab-steps in her path,
text: blocking the little door, and all around her things start
text: to glow. The room has been TRANSFORMED into an amazing
text: BUG MUSEUM, with all sorts of glowing, living specimens
text: in the place of the old furniture and furnishings. The
text: radiators are now big caterpillars, the Nordic Track a
dialog: serving bug.
dialog: 
text: The Other Mother speaks out, startling Coraline.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
dialog: They say even the proudest --
dialog: 
text: The sofa, now a LARGE BUG, turns in place to reveal her
text: sitting on it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
dialog: --spirit can be broken ... with love.
dialog: 
text: She's all smiles, button eyes shining, one hand held out
text: in a behold my handiwork gesture.
dialog: 
text: A BUG CHAIR scoops up Coraline and brings her to the
dialog: Other Mother.
dialog: 
text: The Other Mother takes a candy dish from the servant bug.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Of course, chocolate never hurts. Like
dialog: one?
dialog: 
text: She extends a CANDY DISH filled LIVING CHOCOLATE BEETLES.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
dialog: They're Cocoa Beetles from Zanzibar.
dialog: 
text: Coraline is disgusted. The Other Mother takes back the
text: dish and BITES OFF THE HEAD OF ONE. It's the first thing
text: she's eaten in the film.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: I want to be with my real mom and dad. I
dialog: want you to let me go.
dialog: 
text: The Other Mother FROWNS, swallows. She speaks with a
text: FRIGHTENING STEELINESS in her voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER MOTHER
dialog: Is that any way to talk to your mother?
dialog: 
text: Coraline is mad, and feeling mad makes her brave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: You aren't my mother.
dialog: 
text: The Other Mother STRAIGHTENS. Her button eyes, now DEAD,
text: stare into Coraline's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER MOTHER
dialog: Apologize at once, Coraline!
dialog: 
text: Coraline stares right back, not blinking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER MOTHER
speaker_heading: (TENSELY)
dialog: I'll give you to the count of three.
dialog: One...
dialog: 
text: Then she stands up, GROWING TALLER.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
dialog: ...two...
dialog: 
text: She grows TALLER STILL and SCARIER like a super model on
dialog: steroids.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TALL OTHER MOTHER
dialog: ...THREE!
dialog: 
text: This TALL OTHER MOTHER GRABS Coraline by her NOSE and
text: DRAGS her to the hallway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Ow, what are you doing!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OTHER HOUSE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: She PULLS Coraline down the hallway to the mirror at the
text: end. Coraline flails at the Tall Other Mother with her
dialog: fists.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Ow, that hurts!
dialog: 
text: Tall Other Mother SHOVES Coraline RIGHT THROUGH THE
text: MIRROR as if it was water!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CLOSET-PRISON BEHIND THE MIRROR - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Coraline HITS the ground hard. The Tall Other Mother,
text: head thrust through the mirror, stares down at her
dialog: angrily.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TALL OTHER MOTHER
dialog: You may come out when you've learned to
dialog: be a loving daughter!
dialog: 
text: She PULLS HER HEAD OUT and leaves Coraline in DARKNESS.
dialog: 
text: Coraline pounds on the mirror-door, kicks it with her
text: blue boots. A SOB wells up in her throat.
dialog: 
text: And then we hear a SOFT GHOSTLY MOAN.
dialog: 
text: She turns. She can just make out a sagging iron bed. When
text: the voice speaks, there is a faint glow from beneath its
text: stained cover.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
speaker_heading: (FRIGHTENED)
dialog: Who's there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALL GIRL GHOST (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: Hush! And shush! For the Beldam might be
dialog: listening!
dialog: 
text: Coraline steps towards the bed, the faint glow from under
text: the covers in sync with the words she hears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: You ... you mean the Other Mother? ...
dialog: 
text: She gently pulls back the sheets.
dialog: 
text: The DIMLY GLOWING GHOSTS of THREE CHILDREN, BUTTON EYES,
text: SIT UP: a SWEET GIRL GHOST, Coraline's size; a TALL GIRL
text: GHOST, emotional; a young BOY GHOST, very sad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Who are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY GHOST
speaker_heading: (WISTFUL)
dialog: Don't remember our names... But I `member
dialog: my true mommy...
dialog: 
text: The boy, dressed like Huck Finn, CONJURES up ghost
dialog: flowers.
dialog: 
text: The strange-looking flowers wither and fade. He's so sad
text: that Coraline takes his cold hand and squeezes it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Why are you all here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALL GHOSTS
dialog: The Beldam!
dialog: 
text: The ghosts move about in a dance macabre, like ghostly
dialog: fish in water.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SWEET GIRL GHOST
dialog: She spied on our lives,
text: through the little doll's eyes,
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY GHOST
dialog: And saw that we weren't happy.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TALL GIRL GHOST
dialog: So she lured us away,
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALL GIRL GHOST (CONT'D)
dialog: with treasures and treats,
dialog: 
scene_heading: SWEET GIRL GHOST
dialog: and games to play!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY GHOST
dialog: Gave all that we asked -
dialog: 
scene_heading: SWEET GIRL GHOST
dialog: yet we still wanted more -
dialog: 
scene_heading: TALL GIRL GHOST
dialog: So we let her sew the buttons.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY GHOST
dialog: She said that she loved us,
dialog: 
scene_heading: TALL GIRL GHOST
dialog: But she locked us here
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALL GHOSTS
dialog: And ate up our lives.
dialog: 
text: The ghosts fall back into their bed and sink down.
text: Coraline is stunned. She thinks a little and then speaks,
text: trying to steady her voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Well, she can't keep me in the dark
dialog: forever; not if she wants to win my life.
dialog: Beating her is my only chance.
dialog: 
text: A beat. Then the Sweet Girl asks in her sing-song way:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SWEET GIRL GHOST
dialog: Perhaps, if you do win your escape, you
dialog: could find our eyes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Has she taken those, too?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SWEET GIRL GHOST
dialog: Yes, miss. And hidden them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY GHOST
dialog: Find our eyes, mistress, and our souls
dialog: will be freed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: I ... I'll try.
dialog: 
text: The ghosts PULSE with hope. Coraline sits down against
text: the mirror door, bounces her head against it. She's not
dialog: hopeless.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, HANDS REACH THROUGH THE MIRROR and PULL HER
dialog: OUT!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OTHER HALLWAY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: C.U. of Coraline's FACE, eyes wild, as she TEARS at the
text: hands that hold her. She GRABS one and, FLIPS her MASKED

text: the OTHER WYBIE, his mouth stitched into a PAINFUL, EAR
text: TO EAR SMILE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
speaker_heading: (PANTING)
dialog: WYBIE?..
dialog: 
text: Coraline sits him up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Did she do this to you?
dialog: 
text: She unstitches his painfully-huge grin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: I hope that feels bet--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER WYBIE
dialog: Shhh.
dialog: 
text: He stops her with a finger to her lips, and points to the

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM ­ CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: It's dark, the bug furniture asleep. They run to the big

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
dialog: Coraline? Is that you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Let's go!
dialog: 
text: She opens the little door. A COLD WIND blows from the

text: SHOES, COATS, AND HATS of other kids who tried to escape.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
dialog: Coraline...
dialog: 
text: The tunnel MOVES at the sound of her voice. Coraline
text: takes Other Wybie's arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Come on. She'll hurt you again!
dialog: 
text: He shakes his head no, then pulls off his glove to reveal
text: a HAND MADE OF SAWDUST. He blows his fingers away.
dialog: 
text: HIGH HEELS CLICK from the stairs; she's ALMOST THERE!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
dialog: Coraline? How dare you disobey your

scene_heading: INT. PASSAGEWAY ­ CONTINUOUS

dialog: 
text: Strands of web brush her face, stick to her hair; she

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. REAL LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS TIME, BUT DAY HERE

dialog: Huhhhhhh... So, uh, I really need to get

dialog: 
text: Coraline snaps at him.

speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: You and Gramma been talking?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: The doll's her spy! It's how she watches

speaker_heading: WYBIE

speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: NO! - the Other Mother! She's got this

speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: Yeah... Uh, I think I heard someone

speaker_heading: CORALINE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: The cat... I-I'll just tell Gramma that
dialog: you couldn't find the doll-- OW!
dialog: 
text: A blue boot - thrown by Coraline - HITS his arm. He turns

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: You're not LISTENING TO ME!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE

speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: You creep!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: (calling over his shoulder)
dialog: Crazy!!
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Crazy?... You're the jerk-wad that gave

scene_heading: INT. JONES' CAR - SAME

speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: How is hundred-year-old candy going to
speaker_heading: HELP--
dialog: 
text: Miss Spink suddenly RAISES her KNITTING NEEDLES as if to

dialog: 
text: She pulls a LARGE, THREE-SIDED CANDY WITH A HOLE IT from

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISS SPINK
dialog: There you go, sweety.

speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: What's it for?

speaker_heading: MISS SPINK

dialog: 
text: She pulls down the bed covers and builds COPIES of her

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Hello. How did you get in?
dialog: 
text: The cat yawns, his eyes flash.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOWER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: She follows him, wrapped in her blanket, to the MIRROR at

text: They cling together, blue with cold, as snow falls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: MOM! DAD!!
dialog: 
text: They look up and, with a desperate look, Mel BREATHES on
text: the inside mirror-glass to fog it. She writes H E L P U
text: S. ­ her fingertip squeaking on the glass like a SMALL,
text: SAD BIRD. Frost RISES UP, hiding the letters and then her
text: parents. The image fades.
dialog: 
text: Coraline STRIKES AT THE MIRROR as hard as she can. GLASS

speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: How did this happen?

scene_heading: INT. PARENT'S BEDROOM - SAME

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: They're not coming back, are they ­ Mom

text: The ODD PIECE OF CANDY, the triangle green one with the

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS

dialog: 
text: The candle casts huge, flickering shadows along the wall.

speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: You know, you're walking right into her

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE

speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CORALINE

speaker_heading: MOTHER

dialog: Why would you run away from me?
dialog: 
text: Coraline sees her mother's hand GROW as it wraps around

speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: They weren't bored of me. You stole

text: behind Coraline.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TALL OTHER MOTHER
dialog: Now, don't be difficult, Coraline. Have a
dialog: seat, won't you?
dialog: 
text: Other Father, GURGLING happily, herds Coraline onto the

dialog: 
text: The Tall Other Mother, standing by the little door, turns
text: to it and CLAPS her hands.
dialog: 
text: A moment later, a HUGE RAT skitters out of the tunnel -
text: FILLED AGAIN with spider webs and children's things -
text: carrying the KEY from the real world door.
dialog: 
text: The Tall Other Mother takes the key, locks the door, and -
text: while the armoire bug assumes guard position - she

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
speaker_heading: (OFFHAND)
dialog: Why don't you have your own key?

speaker_heading: OTHER FATHER
dialog: Squish squash, pumpkin sauce...

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE

dialog: Mom, Dad, where'd she hide you?
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Tall Other Mother, humming happily, prepares a mushroom
text: omelet and bacon. Fragrant cinnamon buns bake in the
dialog: oven.
dialog: 
text: At the table's center, Coraline sees the box with her
text: BUTTON EYES with needle and thread. A bead of sweat rolls
text: down her forehead. As casually as she can, she asks:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: (anxious, trying to be cool)
dialog: Why don't we play ... a game? I know you

scene_heading: TALL OTHER MOTHER
speaker_heading: (DISMISSIVE)

speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: If I lose, I'll stay here with you

dialog: 
scene_heading: TALL OTHER MOTHER
dialog: Hmmm... And if you somehow win this game?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Then you let me go. You let everyone go ­

dialog: 
scene_heading: TALL OTHER MOTHER
dialog: Deal.
dialog: 
text: She holds out her hand. Coraline doesn't reach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Not till you give me a clue.
dialog: 
text: Tall Other Mother snorts, her smile sours. She slowly
text: circles Coraline, and speaks as if talking to a very
dialog: stupid child.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TALL OTHER MOTHER
dialog: Oh, right... In each of three wonders
dialog: I've made just for you, a ghost's eye is
text: lost in plain sight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: And for my parents?
dialog: 
text: Tall Other Mother - standing behind her in front of the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: Fine. Don't tell me...
dialog: 
text: Extending her hand, Coraline starts to turn back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: ...it's a deal--
dialog: 
text: But the Tall Other Mother HAS DISAPPEARED and the tapping
text: now is the FAUCET DRIPPING in the sink.
dialog: 
text: Coraline EXHALES, walks to the sink, stares at the
text: dripping faucet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: What does she mean "wonders?"
dialog: 
text: Out the kitchen window, the FANTASTIC GARDEN LIGHTS UP,
text: answering her question. She FURROWS HER BROWS, thinks
dialog: this was too easy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hmmm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OTHER GARDEN - SAME
dialog: 
text: Coraline walks through the gates. The bright magic of the

dialog: 
text: She passes the PITCHER PLANTS, and the one with the frog
text: suddenly SWALLOWS the animal.
dialog: 
text: She goes up the steps past the BLEEDING HEARTS, which now
text: LEAK STICKY RED JUICE that runs down the wall.
dialog: 
text: At the top, a few SNAPDRAGONS, feeble now, SNAP at her.
text: She KICKS them down. Behind her, a brick tree ring OPENS
text: like a monster's MOUTH and five HUGE, PALE SNAPDRAGONS
text: sneak towards her. They ATTACK, knock her to the ground,
text: spilling her bag.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: No!!
dialog: 
text: They GRAB CORALINE at her ankles, knees, hips, waist, and
text: shoulder, and start to ROLL HER UP TOWARDS THE STONE
speaker_heading: MOUTH.
dialog: 
text: Coraline is just able to GRAB her GARDEN SHEARS. She CUTS
text: OFF one mutant snapdragon's head, then another, until she
text: is free. The HEADLESS STEMS retreat into the rock mouth.
dialog: 
text: Coraline, winded, goes to gather her spilled things when
text: a trio of HUMMINGBIRDS/WASP HYBRIDS SWOOP IN. They don't
text: attack her; instead they poke their long beaks into the
text: TRIANGLE CANDY WITH THE HOLE and LIFT OFF.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop!!
dialog: 
text: Coraline chases them, but they're getting away. As she
text: crosses the little bridge, she takes off her cap and
text: FLINGS IT LIKE A FRISBEE at them. SCORE! They fall to the
text: ground, near the eyebrow shrubs, sawdust spilling out.
text: She picks up the triangle candy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Why steal this?
dialog: 
text: With a look of what does she have to lose, she holds it
text: up to her eye and GASPS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Wow...
dialog: 
text: EVERYTHING IS BLURRY GREY like a pencil drawing, all
text: color gone. She scans the garden, turning slowly. As she
text: turns back to where she started, she sees something,
text: right in front of her: a BURNING RED EMBER -- A GHOST'S
speaker_heading: EYE!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: That must be it.
dialog: 
text: She lowers the stone from her eye, to see that the
text: ghost's eye is the FADED STICK SHIFT KNOB from the
text: preying mantis tractor, which STANDS RIGHT IN FRONT OF
text: HER with the Other Father, a SQUAT PUMPKIN MAN, at its
text: controls, his own hands IMPRISONED IN THE MECHANICAL
speaker_heading: PIANO HANDS.
dialog: 
text: HEADLIGHTS GLARE and the tractor ROARS TO LIFE. The
text: mechanical hands FORCE Other Father to SHIFT GEARS, and
text: the tractor LURCHES at Coraline, its arms SLASHING. She
text: yells, backs away. Other Father calls in a garbled voice:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER FATHER
dialog: Sorrry, so sorrry, Motherrr making meeee.
dialog: 
text: Coraline backs onto the little bridge that spans the
text: fountains as the tractor moves in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't waaaanno hurrrrrt you.
dialog: 
text: The Other Father tries to steer the tractor away, but the
text: mechanical hands are stronger. It moves onto the bridge -
text: STUPIDLY SMASHING THROUGH THE PLANKS in front of it.
text: Halfway over, it lurches, then STARTS TO FALL THROUGH THE
text: HOLE IT HAS CREATED. The tractor hangs precariously for a
dialog: moment.
dialog: 
text: Other Father KICKS away one mechanical hand, and with ONE
text: HAND FREE, manages to PULL OFF THE SHIFT KNOB.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Taaaake it!!!!!
dialog: 
text: Coraline DIVES FORWARD and just GETS THE KNOB before the
text: tractor and Other Father fall away and SINK UNDER THE
speaker_heading: WATER.
dialog: 
text: Rippling out from Coraline like a gray wave, the entire
text: GARDEN BECOMES ASHEN AND DEAD.
dialog: 
text: Coraline CATCHES HER BREATH, shaken. The ghost eye/gear
dialog: knob GLOWS RED, no magic candy necessary.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY GHOST
dialog: Bless you, miss, you found me! But
text: there's two eyes still lost.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Don't worry, I'm getting the hang of it!
dialog: 
text: Coraline looks past the greyed garden towards the Other
text: House. A LUNAR ECLIPSE has begun, the full moon a pale
text: acid green.
dialog: 
text: Coraline looks concerned, then resolved, and then she
text: heads towards the house. A haunting version of Spink and

dialog: 
text: REVERSE ON Coraline. She carefully descends towards CAM.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT DOWNSTAIRS THEATRE - SAME
dialog: 
text: WE SEE her flickering shadow and then Coraline appears
text: behind the entry curtains. She steps close, pulls the
text: curtain open. Song stops.
dialog: 
text: POV ON THEATER, quiet and dark save for light coming
text: through entry curtains. She spots usher's FLASHLIGHT on
dialog: the ground.
dialog: 
text: ON CORALINE - she picks it up, clicks it on, and STEPS
text: FORWARD. She sweeps the light beam around, apprehensive,
text: then HEARS SOMETHING overhead. She aims flashlight up and
text: startles a NEST OF BAT-DOGS - half Scotties/half bats.
text: One bares his teeth and GROWLS. She clicks off the light
text: and shivers.
dialog: 
text: On stage, one spotlight and footlights FADE UP on a huge,
text: wrapped SALTWATER TAFFY. It hangs from ropes and
text: sandbags.
dialog: 
text: She cautiously climbs up onto the stage. A HUMAN-SIZED
text: TAFFY THING - striped pale pink and green - can just be
text: seen through the wrapper. She holds her TRIANGLE CANDY-
text: WITH-HOLE to her eye. There is a BLUE-WHITE GLOW coming
text: from inside the wrapper.
dialog: 
text: Coraline PUNCHES A HOLE through the paper, steels
text: herself, then reaches inside. She touches something
text: sticky and cold and inhuman. Clenching her teeth, she
text: grabs hold and pulls out two clasped-together COLD, TAFFY
text: HANDS - Young Spink and Forcible's.
dialog: 
text: Her heart thumps. She PRIES the TAFFY HANDS open like
text: scallop shells until a large PEARL-on-a-ring is revealed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
speaker_heading: (REALIZING)
dialog: The pearl!
dialog: 
text: The hands suddenly GRAB HER! She SCREAMS. Young Spink and
text: Forcible, twisted together into one taffy monster, THRUST
text: THEIR HEADS FROM THE BAG!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAFFY MONSTER
dialog: Thief!! Give it back!
dialog: 
text: Coraline PULLS AWAY, STRETCHING the candy arm out across
text: the stage! The taffy monster THRUSTS OUT another paired
text: arm, and starts DRAGGING ITSELF TOWARDS CORALINE, ropes
text: swaying on pulleys.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAFFY MONSTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (in unison)
dialog: You thief! Thief! Thief! Thief! Give it
dialog: back! Thief! Give it back! Give it back!
dialog: Thief! Stop thief! Thief! Stop!
dialog: 
text: Coraline, desperate, gets an idea. She clicks on her
text: flashlight and aims it at the BAT-DOGS. They GROWL with
dialog: annoyance, OPEN their wings.
dialog: 
text: The taffy monster is GETTING CLOSER! Coraline hurls the
text: flashlight at the bat-dogs and HITS THEM. Angered, they
text: TAKE WING TO ATTACK HER - just like she planned!
dialog: 
text: Bat-dogs are closing on the left, the taffy monster on
text: the right! She waits to the very last second, and then
text: DIVES OUT OF THE WAY!
dialog: 
text: BAT-DOGS AND TAFFY MONSTER COLLIDE! Coraline's hand is
text: released by the taffy hands, leaving her the PEARL. The
text: bat-dogs and taffy monster - stuck together and still-as-
text: stone - turn to dead, grey ash, as does the stage and
dialog: theater.
dialog: 
text: The PEARL in Coraline's hand PULSES BLUE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALL GIRL GHOST (V.O.)

dialog: 
text: Other Mr. B's Russian flag, TORN in places, waves in the

text: what is clearly the SHADOW OF A HUGE, DARK, BUTTON.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON CORALINE as she climbs the last flight of stairs
text: to Bobinsky's. She stops with a SHUDDER at the top. The

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Oh, Wybie...

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OTHER MR. B'S ATTIC FLAT - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Coraline steps into the apartment and carefully shuts the

text: in patches through holes in the roof. The corners and
text: edges of the room are very dark.
dialog: 
text: OTHER BOBINSKY suddenly CRAWLS by the door behind her.
text: Coraline whips around, on guard. He LOOMS UP past the
text: cannons on her right, leaning towards her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
dialog: Hello, ga-LOO-boo-shka.
dialog: 
text: There are too many joints in his arms and legs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: I'm Coraline.
dialog: 
text: His tall, crooked hat is pulled so low, and his collar so

dialog: 
text: He throws out his arm towards her and the CIRCUS BALL
text: from the mouse circus rolls from his sleeve to his hand.

scene_heading: OTHER MR. BOBINSKY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Uh-huh.
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: OTHER MR. BOBINSKY

scene_heading: OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
dialog: (last breath)
dialog: Not even that anymore.
dialog: 
text: Coraline pulls off his hat. Instead of his head, a HUGE

text: at her then DIVES DOWN the coat collar.
dialog: 
text: RATS leap from COAT SLEEVES and PANT LEGS, Coraline pulls
text: back, HORRIFIED, as the clothes collapse, scanning around
dialog: for the circus ball.
dialog: 
text: There's a rat bark behind her and she turns. The HUGE RAT
text: - balanced on a wheel of cheese, circus ball in paws -
text: TAUNTS HER, then RUNS THE CHEESE OUT THE DOOR! She GIVES
speaker_heading: CHASE.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OTHER MR. B'S FLAT - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The OTHER RATS RACE behind the twin rows of cannons - the

dialog: door!
dialog: 
text: Coraline CHARGES. The cannons, manned by rats, FIRE

text: ribs; she weaves and STUMBLES, the shots landing like
dialog: punches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Ahhh! No!!
dialog: 
text: A PET DOOR - perfectly shaped for the rat on the wheel -
text: appears in the front door as the rat approaches.
dialog: 
text: Coraline looks up to see the PET DOOR OPEN and the CHEESE-
text: WHEEL RAT HEADING THROUGH IT TO THE OUTSIDE.
dialog: 
text: Coraline takes her triangle candy stone and THROWS IT as

dialog:

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Noooo!
dialog: 
text: The whole rig, with Coraline on top, ROTATES as it
text: collapses, THROWING CORALINE toward the front of the
text: house when it HITS THE GROUND. She BLACKS OUT a moment.
dialog: 
text: WHEEZING for breath, Coraline pushes up on hands and
text: knees and SCANS past the topiaries and poplars and white
text: gravel driveway, looking for the cheese-wheel rat and
dialog: circus ball. No cheese-wheel rat, no circus ball ghost
dialog: eye.
dialog: 
text: Coraline, lit by a NARROWING BAND of pale green light,
text: turns to look at the moon. It's nearly covered now by the
text: DARK BUTTON SHADOW.
dialog: 
text: Her HAND stings from a scrape. BLOOD trickles from her
text: knee. She feels nothing but COLD LOSS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (DEVASTATED)
dialog: Oh God, I've lost the game; I've lost
dialog: everything.
dialog: 
text: She sobs, hugs knees and face to chest. The band of light
text: that illuminates her is narrowing to near-gone.
dialog: 
text: In the foreground, the HEAD of the cheese-wheel rat -
text: CIRCUS BALL IN ITS TEETH - DROPS ON THE GROUND. Sawdust
text: leaks from its neck. Band of light STOPS NARROWING, the
dialog: eclipse paused.
dialog: 
text: There's a familiar MEROWWW and Coraline looks up.
dialog: 
text: Across from her on the front yard, sits the BLACK CAT,
text: licking his paws, rat's head and circus ball at his feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: I think I mentioned that I don't like
dialog: rats at the best of times.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: I think you might have said something
dialog: like that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: It looked like you needed this one,
dialog: however.
dialog: 
text: He bats the circus ball and it rolls to Coraline.
dialog: 
text: She picks it up , sticks it in her bag. Around her, the
text: YARD, HOUSE, TREES, SHRUBS AND DRIVEWAY TURN ASHEN GRAY.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
text: Looks towards house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm heading inside. I still have to find
dialog: my parents.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON MOON. The stalled eclipse STARTS AGAIN, and in
text: one beat, the last sliver of green moon is FULLY BLACKED
text: OUT. The EDGES of the button shadow start to FLAKE AWAY.
dialog: 
text: ON CORALINE WITH CAT. A strange insect thrumming has
text: begun. What appear to be grey paint chips or bits of
text: paper are falling. Confused, she looks up to see:.
dialog: 
text: The huge button shadow is EATEN TO NOTHING and then the
text: SKY around it IS EATEN AS WELL, revealing dirty white
text: light. The destruction TRAVELS from sky to the distant
text: hills, the sound of a million, invisible locusts growing
dialog: louder.
dialog: 
text: UP ANGLE ON CAT AND CORALINE. The cat hisses. Deeply
text: alarmed, they look from one direction to another.
dialog: 
text: POV out front yard. The destruction TRAVELS up the
text: driveway, PULLS APART the poplars, and then UNRAVELS the
text: topiary elephant and bird.
dialog: 
text: DOWN ANGLE ON Coraline and cat, his TAIL TWITCHING. WE
text: PULL BACK to find they are at the center of a RAPIDLY
text: SHRINKING ISLAND!
dialog: 
text: NEW ANGLE on Coraline and cat as ground beneath their
text: feet STARTS CRACKING, white light coming through. Cat
text: makes a fearful sound, afraid for the first time in the
dialog: movie!
dialog: 
text: Coraline holds out her arms to the trembling animal, her
dialog: guardian angel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, quickly!
dialog: 
text: The cat LEAPS and she catches him, then CARRIES HIM up
text: the DISINTEGRATING porch steps to the front door. She
text: gets through just in time, and SLAMS it shut!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OTHER HOUSE HALLWAY - SAME
dialog: 
text: It's dark and stable in here, with just some creaks and
text: intermittent vibrations. A poisonous green light spills
text: from the other living room.
dialog: 
text: Coraline goes there, carrying the cat over her shoulder,
text: past wallpaper that PEELS UP as she passes, to the room
text: where she last heard the sound of her mother's finger on
dialog: glass.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM - SAME
dialog: 
scene_heading: A poisonous GREEN FIRE - LIKE SLEEPY SEA SNAKES - BURNS
text: in the fireplace. The bug furniture looks grey now, their
text: lights flickering as if short-circuited; legs and wings
text: twitching uncontrollably.
dialog: 
text: Coraline scans the walls, the ceiling, looking for a sign
dialog: of her parents.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON CORALINE in foreground. She senses the Other
text: Mother behind her, a creature who is no sort of Mother at
text: all but a witch, a Beldam. She turns.
dialog: 
text: The Beldam is hunched on the sofa - her face hidden.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BELDAM
dialog: So, you're back....
dialog: 
text: Her voice sounds dry and tired. She turns her face
text: towards Coraline. It is a WHITE DEATH MASK, cracked and
text: peeling - her true face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BELDAM (CONT'D)
dialog: And you brought vermin with you.
dialog: 
text: Coraline shudders and steps back. The cat makes a fearful
text: sound and digs his claws into her shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: No, I ... I brought a friend.
dialog: 
text: The Beldam rises up 12 FEET TALL. She is WITHERED to the
text: bone; with plate-like shoulders and hips; her bustle now
text: an arachnid's tail section. Her true form.
dialog: 
text: She reaches her long, sharp FINGERS MADE OF NEEDLES to
text: Coraline's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BELDAM
speaker_heading: (FLATLY)
dialog: You know I love you.
dialog: 
text: Coraline works hard to not show how freaked out she is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: You, you have a very funny way of showing
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: The Beldam smiles, turns away, then back, her hand
dialog: outstretched.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BELDAM
dialog: So? Where are they - the ghost eyes?
dialog: 
text: Coraline pulls out the three spheres from her bag and
text: starts to hand them over. But she catches herself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Hold on.
dialog: 
text: And pulls back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: We aren't finished yet, are we?
dialog: 
text: The Beldam looks daggers, then smiles sweetly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BELDAM
dialog: No, I suppose not. After all, you still
dialog: need to find your old parents, don't you?
dialog: Too bad you won't have this.
dialog: 
text: She produces the TRIANGLE CANDY that Coraline lost and
text: FLINGS it into the green fire. The Beldam laughs while
text: the MAGIC BURNS out of the candy with sparks and pops.
dialog: 
text: ON CORALINE. The third ghost eye PULSES WITH AMBER LIGHT
text: in her hand. Coraline turns away, so the witch won't see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWEET GIRL GHOST (O.S.)
dialog: Be clever, miss; even if you win she'll
dialog: never let you go!
dialog: 
text: Coraline looks towards the locked little door behind the
dialog: armoire bug and understands: she's got to get the Beldam
text: to unlock it! She furrows her brow as an idea comes to
text: her then nods.
dialog: 
text: She turns to the witch and in the most confident tone she
dialog: can muster, says:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: I already know where you've hidden them.
dialog: 
text: The Beldam turns from the fire, both concerned and
text: sceptical.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BELDAM
dialog: Well... produce them.
dialog: 
text: Coraline points to the little door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: They're behind that door.
dialog: 
text: The Beldam leans close, knowing Coraline is wrong, and
text: speaks very quietly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BELDAM
dialog: Oh, they are, are they?
dialog: 
text: A smile creeps onto her terrible face. And she STARTS
text: TOWARDS THE LITTLE DOOR, moving in an odd, laboring way,
text: as if she had four legs instead of two. She signals the
text: armoire bug to stand aside, her back to Coraline.
dialog: 
text: Coraline hears the soft chirp of her mother's finger on
text: wet glass! Looks around, desperate - where is it coming
dialog: from?!
dialog: 
text: The cat's ears twitch and focus, and then he SEES
text: SOMETHING on the mantel!. He whispers to Coraline --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: There!
dialog: 
text: -- and JUMPS to land beside the DETROIT ZOO SNOW-GLOBE -
scene_heading: OPAQUE WITH FROST.
dialog: 
text: C.U. ON SNOW-GLOBE. With a SOFT-CHIRP, a section of glass
text: is WIPED CLEAR from inside by a TINY FOREARM - and we see
text: the tiny, cold figures that are CORALINE'S TRAPPED
text: PARENTS! Coraline's heart races. She purposely stays back
dialog: from them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: Mom. Dad!
dialog: 
text: ON BELDAM, by little door. Oblivious to Coraline's
text: discovery, she COUGHS up the KEY into her hand. She turns
text: to Coraline, expectantly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Go on. Open it. They'll be there, all
dialog: right.
dialog: 
text: The Beldam stoops to push the key into the lock, turns
text: it, leaves the key in place.
dialog: 
text: She grins at Coraline and speaks in a low, sing-song
dialog: voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BELDAM
dialog: You're wrong, Coraline!
dialog: 
text: She opens the little door, revealing the empty, spider-
dialog: web tunnel.
dialog: 
text: ON CORALINE, who glances from the open door to the cat -
text: obscured on the mantel - and back to the Beldam. She's
dialog: thinking very hard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BELDAM (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (PITYING)
dialog: They aren't there.
dialog: 
text: She opens her hands: one holds box with Coraline's BLACK
text: BUTTON EYES, the other a THREADED NEEDLE. Triumphant, the
text: Beldam softly gloats:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BELDAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Now you're going to stay here forever.
dialog: 
text: Coraline strikes a warrior's pose, and, summons all the
dialog: fury she can.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: No ... I'm ...
dialog: 
text: She GRABS THE CAT off the mantel and RAISES HIM OVER HER
speaker_heading: HEAD.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: NOT!
dialog: 
text: And she HURLS THE CAT at the Beldam. The YOWLING ANIMAL -
text: face shocked with surprise - SAILS through the air and
text: lands RIGHT ON THE ASTONISHED WITCH'S HEAD.
dialog: 
text: FREAKED-OUT, the cat DIGS in his CLAWS AND BITES the
text: shrieking Beldam, who STAGGERS to one side of the little
dialog: door.
dialog: 
text: Coraline GRABS the SNOW GLOBE with her parents inside,
text: stows it in her bag, and moves out to approach the door
text: from the other side.
dialog: 
text: The Beldam FLAILS WILDLY at the cat. The cat HOWLS LIKE A
text: BANSHEE, RAISES HIS CLAWS, and - quick as you can - TWO
text: SHINY BLACK BUTTONS HIT THE FLOOR - THE BELDAM'S EYES!
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON CAT as he's thrown on armoire bug.
dialog: 
text: ON BELDAM, hands covering her face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BELDAM
speaker_heading: NOOOOOOOOO!
dialog: 
text: Her hands pull away to show EMPTY, FLAT SOCKETS and TORN
speaker_heading: THREAD!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BELDAM (CONT'D)
dialog: You horrible cheating girl!
dialog: 
text: She furiously STOMPS the floor which FLIES UP in a spiral
text: of floorboards that drive Coraline to the room's center.
text: A huge WEB TRAP LIES BENEATH THE FLOOR!
dialog: 
text: The web trap STRETCHES DOWN into a FIFTY FOOT DEEP PIT.
text: There is nothing beyond but PALE NOTHINGNESS.
dialog: 
text: The cat scrambles along the tops of falling furniture
text: straight to the little door and disappears into the
dialog: tunnel.
dialog: 
text: Coraline falls the very bottom of the web.
dialog: 
text: Fifty feet above, the Beldam LAUGHS MANIACALLY and LEAPS
text: DOWN like a huge, flying spider!
dialog: 
text: Coraline manages to pull herself to the outside of the
text: trap JUST AS THE BELDAM LANDS.
dialog: 
text: The witch - furious her prey has escaped - spins around,
text: grasping blindly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BELDAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Noo!! Where are you? You selfish brat!!
dialog: 
text: Coraline, nearing the top, looks up and spots the LITTLE
text: DOOR, still in the corner wall of the Other Living Room.
text: She goes to climb back inside the web, when her bag GETS
text: CAUGHT on a barb. She pulls and pulls until it breaks
text: free, sending a STRONG VIBRATION DOWN THE SPIRALING WEB
text: TO THE VERY SENSITIVE HAND OF THE BELDAM.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BELDAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Hahahaha...
dialog: 
text: The Beldam smiles - she knows where her prey is now!
dialog: 
text: Coraline makes it to the little door, but the BELDAM IS
text: COMING UP BEHIND HER VERY FAST!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BELDAM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: YOU ... DARE ...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Coraline SCRAMBLES through the door, KEY IN HAND, and
text: grabs the door's handle. Before she can shut it, the
text: BELDAM'S HEAD THRUSTS INSIDE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BELDAM
dialog: ... DISOBEY YOUR MOTHER??!!
dialog: 
text: Coraline KICKS HER IN THE FACE, knocking her back. The
text: cat takes off down the tunnel.
dialog: 
text: Coraline nearly shuts the door, when NEEDLE FINGERS GRAB
text: HOLD THROUGH THE CRACK. The door STARTS TO PULL OPEN!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
text: PLEASE...SHUT!!
dialog: 
text: The ghost children's FLUTTERY, DISMEMBERED HANDS FLY OUT
text: FROM HER BAG and GRAB HOLD OF CORALINE'S HANDS that grip
text: the door's handle. And her STRENGTH IS QUADRUPLED.
dialog: 
text: The door STARTS TO SHUT. The Beldam SNATCHES DESPERATELY
text: at Coraline, reaching through the closing gap with one
text: thin claw. There's a final moment of resistance - the
text: Beldam's wire-thin wrist caught in the door - and then
text: SNAP! The DOOR SHUTS, and the Beldam's hand drops to the
dialog: ground!
dialog: 
text: She SCREECHES like a metal rake on pavement!
dialog: 
text: Coraline just manages to lock the door in the dark when
text: it is POUNDED from the other side, green light coming
text: through cracks! She takes off down the tunnel, stooped
text: down, as fast as she can.
dialog: 
text: The pounding grows more insistent, green light flashing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BELDAM (O.S.)
dialog: DON'T LEAVE ME! DON'T LEAVE ME!!! I'LL
dialog: DIE WITHOUT YOU!!!!
dialog: 
text: And then the tunnel behind coraline STARTS TO GROW
text: SHORTER, like a collapsing accordion and the pounding far
text: door with the blind, one-handed Beldam on the other side
text: STARTS TO CATCH UP TO HER!
dialog:

text: Coraline FLINGS HERSELF through the doorway, SHUTS AND
text: LOCKS THE DOOR and BRACES HERSELF AGAINST IT. A split-
text: second later, the OTHER WORLD DOOR CATCHES UP WITH A
text: CRASH! Coraline is THROWN BACK. But the real-world door
dialog: and lock, hold. It's over...
dialog: 
text: Coraline lies on her back, as beat-up and tired as she's
text: ever been, GULPING in breaths of air till her heart slows
text: a little. The room is brightly lit by sunlight, the first
text: since she moved here, and the sky out the windows is blue
text: with white clouds.
dialog: 
text: She smiles, remembering, and turns to her bag with the
text: ghost eyes and snow globe with her parents inside.
dialog: 
text: She opens it up, and searches, shoving aside ghost eyes
dialog: and garden shears. But the snow globe is GONE!
dialog: 
text: She gets on all fours, starts searching the floor. Her
text: hand hits a small PUDDLE by the fireplace, with tiny
text: bits of BLUE SNOW. A drip plops down, then another. She
text: looks up to the mantel and spots the MISSING SNOW GLOBE.
text: She stands up and finds that it's BROKEN OPEN, and
text: neither her parents or the fountain bears are inside.
dialog: 
text: As the last of the snowy liquid drains from the globe,
text: Coraline's face clouds with confusion and fear: What does
dialog: this mean and where are her parents? Then her WONDERFULLY
text: REAL MOTHER calls to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEL (O.S.)
dialog: Coraline? We're home!
dialog: 
text: Her TRUE PARENTS enter the room from the hallway, a
text: dusting of snow on their shoulders and hair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Mom! Dad! I missed you so much!
dialog: 
text: Coraline runs to her parents and throws her arms around
dialog: them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEL
dialog: Missed us?
dialog: 
scene_heading: C.U. ON CORALINE. Huh?
dialog: 
text: Mel notices the broken snow globe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh no, you broke my favorite snow globe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: I didn't break it. It must've broke when
dialog: you escaped.
dialog: 
text: Mom spots her bloody knee.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEL
dialog: And cut your knee.
dialog: 
text: Charlie crouches low, clutching his briefcase.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Coraline, I asked you to count all the
dialog: windows, not put your knee through them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
speaker_heading: BUT-
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEL
dialog: Well, get yourself cleaned up,
speaker_heading: (WARMS)
dialog: we're going out tonight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We gotta lot to celebrate!
dialog: 
text: Coraline, confused, takes a stab.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: You're talking about... your garden
dialog: catalog?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEL
dialog: Of course! What else?
dialog: 
text: Her parents turn to leave the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: But look at the snow on your clothes...?
dialog: 
text: But the snow melts without a trace.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEL
speaker_heading: (CONFUSED)
dialog: What's gotten into you, Coraline?
dialog: 
text: Her parents walk off. Coraline shrugs her shoulders and
text: looks back to the broken snow globe on the mantel. She
text: cocks her head, deeply puzzled, then leaves the room.

scene_heading: EXT HOUSE - NIGHT, SKY CLEAR

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT FULL MOON RISING
dialog: 
text: Coraline sits in bed -- pajamas washed and PATCHED,
text: wounds-dressed, hair shining. The KEY hangs from a string
text: around her neck. A gibbous moon shines in the clear night
dialog: sky.
dialog: 
text: Charlie wrestles with a blue stuffed-toy squid like it's
text: an alien face-hugger then, FEIGNING DEATH, falls on the
text: bed. Coraline LAUGHS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: So, gonna order the tulips?
dialog: 
text: He opens one eye, pretends he's never heard about this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: For the garden party!!
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I have no idea what you're talking about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Dad!
dialog: 
text: She turns to Mom, arranging things on a shelf.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: So, Mom. Invitations? Don't forget the
dialog: invitations.
dialog: 
text: Her mother nods, points up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEL
dialog: Even Bobinsky?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Mr. B's not drunk, Mom, he's
dialog: just...eccentric.
dialog: 
text: Charlie LAUGHS. He bends down to kiss her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Good night, Coraline.
dialog: 
text: As he steps away, Mel slips a slim box under the covers
text: next to her daughter. She gives Coraline a "told you so"
text: look, and she and Charlie leave the room.
dialog: 
text: Coraline sits up excitedly and opens the box - it's the
text: GREEN AND ORANGE GLOVES she'd wanted! She pulls one on to
text: admire when the BLACK CAT appears outside her window
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Oh, hello again.
dialog: 
text: She walks over to the window, opens it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: You still mad?
dialog: 
text: His expression says yes, he's still mad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm really sorry I threw you at her - the
dialog: Other Mother? ­ it was all I could think
dialog: of.
dialog: 
text: The cat's angry expression softens. He rests his head on
text: her hand, licking her fingers and purrs.
dialog: 
text: Coraline exhales with relief then picks him up and
text: carries him over to her bed.
dialog: 
text: She grabs her collecting bag and takes out the large
text: PEARL, the CIRCUS BALL, and the GREY STICKSHIFT KNOB. She
text: holds them out to the cat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: I think it's time, don't you? To set them
dialog: free?
dialog: 
text: The cat nods. She puts the ghost eyes under her pillow
text: and gently lays down, the cat lying beside her. The two
text: of them close their eyes, and in no time at all, they
text: doze off to sleep. WE SLOWLY TILT UP.

scene_heading: EXT. DREAMSCAPE - MAGIC TIME
dialog:

dialog: 
text: CAM TILT DOWN ON Coraline, studying sky, her back to us.
text: From behind CAM, CHIMES sound and GOLD LIGHT begins to
text: shine on her. She turns toward us, shielding her eyes.
dialog: 
text: Coraline's eyes adjust to the brightness to see the THREE
text: GHOST CHILDREN, now transformed into GOLDEN ANGELS; EYES
text: RESTORED, small fluttering WINGS ON THEIR BACKS.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SWEET GIRL GHOST
dialog: It's a fine, fine thing you did for us,
dialog: miss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Well, I'm glad it's finally over!
dialog: 
text: A SHADOW crosses the faces of the three children. They

scene_heading: TALL GIRL GHOST
dialog: You're in terrible danger, girl!
dialog: 
text: Coraline is stunned and gestures for an explanation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: But how? I locked the door!?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SWEET GIRL GHOST
dialog: It's the key, miss, there's only one and
dialog: the Beldam will find it.
dialog: 
text: The KEY ON THE STRING around Coraline's neck floats out
text: in front of Coraline. She grabs it.
dialog: 
text: The three ghost children all embrace Coraline tenderly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY GHOST
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: Tain't all bad, miss. Thou art alive ...
dialog: thou art still ... living...
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog:

text: above her to find covers thrown off and the CAT awake by
dialog: her side.
dialog: 
text: Coraline lifts up her pillow and GASPS - the GHOST EYES
text: ARE IN PIECES like hatched bird eggs. She takes out the
text: key on its string and explains to the cat, her voice
speaker_heading: PANICKED:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: I -- I've gotta hide this somewhere, s-
dialog: somewhere she can never ...
dialog: 
text: The cat doesn't like the sound of this. Coraline grabs
text: her blanket and heads to her door. But the cat leaps down
text: and blocks her way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Outta my way!
dialog: 
text: She sidesteps the cat and leaves her room. The cat glares
dialog: after her
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE STAIRWAY, LOWER HALL, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Coraline trots down the stairs and purposefully heads
text: down the hall. She passes the LIVING ROOM and exits
text: frame. CAMERA stays on living room, where, on the LITTLE
text: DOOR in the corner wall, SHADOWS and LIGHT start to MOVE.
dialog: WE ROCKET IN AND--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The baseboard is PUSHED ASIDE. Through the narrow gap at
text: the door's bottom, the DISMEMBERED HAND OF THE BELDAM
text: CRAWLS OUT. It scrambles out of frame in the direction of
dialog: Coraline!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT ROCKY PATH HIGH ABOVE HOUSE - SAME
dialog: 
text: Coraline moves briskly, the house below, GRIPPING THE KEY
text: that's tied round her neck. DARK, ROPEY CLOUDS reach like
text: fingers across the gibbous moon. Coraline sings her
text: father's nonsense song, her voice hardly trembling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Oh.... my twitchy witchy girl,
dialog: I think you are so nice ...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ORCHARD - SAME
dialog: 
text: She moves down past the old fruit trees, now covered with
text: BRIGHT SPRING BLOSSOMS that fall gently like snow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: ... I give you bowls of porridge
dialog: And I give you bowls of ice cream.
dialog: 
text: LOW ANGLE ON Coraline, moving away. The BELDAM'S HAND
text: drops into frame and CREEP-CRAWLS after her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE (CONT'D)
dialog: I give you lots of kisses,
dialog: And I give you lots of hugs ...

scene_heading: EXT. WELL - SAME
dialog: 
text: Coraline jams the SAME DEAD BRANCH Wybie used under the
text: well's cover, lining it up over the SAME FULCRUM ROCK.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: ... But I never give you sandwiches
text: With grease and worms and mung beans.
dialog: 
text: Circling around behind the BIG STUMP, the HAND SCAMPERS
text: behind one rock to a bush to a tree, coming closer.
dialog: 
text: Coraline manages to lever the well's cover off to one
text: side, leaving the WHOLE WELL OPEN. Huffing and sweating,
text: she wipes her brow, then takes the key string that's
text: around her neck.
dialog: 
text: The hand, SEEING what is about to happen, RACES TOWARDS
speaker_heading: HER!
dialog: 
text: Coraline lifts string and key, not quite over her head.
dialog: 
text: The hand JUMPS onto the big stump and SPRINGS through the
text: air to GRAB THE KEY and PULL CORALINE TO THE GROUND!
dialog: 
text: Coraline makes a CHOKED SCREAM, her fingers caught
text: between the key string and her neck!
dialog: 
text: The HAND wants to DRAG HER BACK TO THE HOUSE and the
text: LITTLE LOCKED DOOR THAT IS BREATHING WITH ANTICIPATION!
dialog: 
text: A BLINDING HEADLIGHT hits HAND and CORALINE; an AIR HORN
text: SOUNDS; and WYBIE LOVAT - hollering a BATTLE CRY all his
text: own - comes SPEEDING DOWN THE BLUFF on his whining
dialog: electric bike!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: YAHHHHH!!!!
dialog: 
text: Wybie GUNS the throttle, and, leaning out, GRABS the
dialog: confused HAND with his slug tongs!
dialog: 
text: He CIRCLES AROUND and HEADS TOWARDS THE WELL, readying to
text: throw the hand in. But the HAND GETS FREE, and GRABS his
text: handlebars.
dialog: 
text: OUT OF CONTROL, Wybie's bike HITS A ROCK, and WYBIE AND
text: HAND ARE THROWN RIGHT DOWN THE WELL. HOLLERING, he just
text: manages to hang on with one hand! The Beldam's hand,
text: caught on Wybie's coattail, SCRAMBLES UP his body and
text: face and onto the well's edge where it STABS AT HIS
text: FINGERS to make him fall!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (STRUGGLING)
dialog: Get off!!
dialog: 
text: Coraline, choking, rises to her feet. She grabs her
text: BLANKET and - in the still-blazing headlight of the
text: crashed bike - she RUNS UP and THROWS IT OVER THE HAND.
text: It fights like crazy as Coraline wrestles to control it.
text: The hand STABS THROUGH THE BLANKET and SHAKES IT OFF. It
text: crouches to attack her!
dialog: 
text: And then WYBIE IS BACK, pumped with adrenaline, a BIG
text: ROCK raised over his head! He HURLS IT DOWN ON THE
text: LEAPING HAND! And it BREAKS into TWENTY LIFELESS NEEDLES.
dialog: 
text: Wybie struggles to catch his breath. Coraline - breathing
text: hard - removes the key and string from around her sore
text: neck. She pulls up the corners of her blanket - with the
text: needles on it - around the rock, and ties it all together
text: with the string. The key is left attached.
dialog: 
text: The two friends carry the heavy package to the well and
text: DROP IT DOWN THE HOLE. By the light of a stray moonbeam,
text: they watch and listen until it makes a muffled splash in
text: the dark water at the bottom. They slide the well cover
dialog: in place.
dialog: 
text: Still catching his breath, Wybie stands, holding his
text: injured hand, its glove ripped by the Beldam's claw. He
text: looks over at Coraline as the scene brightens a little
text: with moonlight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I-I'm really sorry I didn't believe you
dialog: about all this ... evil stuff, Coraline.
dialog: 
text: Coraline, shoulders rising as she catches her breath,
text: stands and smiles: he called her by real name for the
dialog: first time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: Why did you change your mind?
dialog: 
text: He walks over, and takes out an old B&amp;W photo from his
dialog: jacket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: W-well, Gramma showed me this picture,
dialog: after I called you crazy?
dialog: 
text: He hands it to her.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON PHOTO: two light-skinned black girls - dressed
text: in old-fashioned clothing - stand in front of the Pink
text: Palace, before it was divided into apartments. One looks
text: just like the sweet ghost girl, and holds the DOLL WITH
text: BUTTON EYES, which looks just like her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WYBIE (O.C.) (CONT'D)
dialog: It's her and her sister, before she
dialog: disappeared.
dialog:

speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: We...we can??
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORALINE
dialog: You know, I'm glad you decided to stalk

speaker_heading: WYBIE
dialog: Wasn't my idea.

text: showing signs of having helped plant about TWO HUNDRED
speaker_heading: RED TULIPS.
dialog:
