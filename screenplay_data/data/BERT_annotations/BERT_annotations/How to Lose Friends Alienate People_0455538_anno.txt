scene_heading: 1 TV SCREEN - BLACK AND WHITE MOVIE 1
dialog: ...British, fifties, a melodrama. We're looking at an
text: ACTRESS - glamorous, young - but very much in the back
text: ground of the scene - a secretary typing at her desk.
speaker_heading: REVERSE
text: A YOUNG BOY sits watching the film, his clothes and the
dialog: room around him telling us this is England in the 1960s. He

scene_heading: SLOW-MOTION
text: We are CLOSE on an extremely handsome YOUNG MAN staring

speaker_heading: SIDNEY (V.O.)
dialog: My name's Sidney Young. I'm a
dialog: journalist...a hack. (Beat) Yeah,
dialog: that...that isn't me.
text: We PAN right and down to our hero - SIDNEY YOUNG -
text: thirties, an odd-ball with a knack for getting people to
dialog: dislike him.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: This is me at the Golden Globe
dialog: Awards in L.A. this year. That's
dialog: my Armani tuxedo. That's a Rolex
dialog: Sea-Dweller 4000 watch I'm
dialog: wearing.
text: Still in SLOW-MOTION we TRACK BACK and see that Sidney is
text: at a table with several other people, all staring raptly
text: past us to the stage which is out of shot.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Those people all around me -
dialog: they're all famous. They're my
dialog: friends.
text: Beside him sits a beautiful young woman - SOPHIE MAES
dialog: (20's).
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: That's the actress Sophie Maes.
dialog: This morning she told me she
dialog: would let me have sex with her if
dialog: she won the Best Actress Award.
text: Still in SLOW MOTION, Sophie suddenly covers her face with
text: her hands and begins to stand.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: She just won the Best Actress
dialog: Award.
text: Sophie walks out of the shot. Still sporting the fixed
text: smile, Sidney claps in SLO-MO along with everyone else in
text: the room. We TRACK away from Sidney past tables of
text: CELEBRITIES towards an EXIT.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: My life didn't used to be like
dialog: this.
text: We PUSH THROUGH the EXIT DOORS and find ourselves
text: impossibly looking at...

scene_heading: 3 EXT. LONDON - LEICESTER SQUARE - LATE AFTERNOON 3
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4 SLOW MOTION TRACKING SHOT 4
text: ...a crowd of FANS held back from us by a red rope, craning
text: their necks to see us more clearly, waving, cheering,
text: shouting, cameras flashing... Rain lashes down.
text: A CAPTION reads: "Sidney's Life, One Year Ago. Bafta
dialog: Awards. London."
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (V.O.)
dialog: Looky-Loos. That's what They call
dialog: you when you stand out in the
dialog: rain all night just to catch a
text: glimpse of Them going by.
text: REVERSE - CELEBRITIES walk down the red carpet, pausing to
text: wave at the fans.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I used to pretend it was
dialog: different for me because I was
dialog: getting paid by a magazine or
dialog: newspaper, whatever. But that's,
dialog: you know...I just loved watching
dialog: Them. I'd stand outside looking
dialog: in through the window and think
dialog: what it would be like to somehow
dialog: get inside. But there was only
dialog: one way to get past the thin red
dialog: line that separates the
dialog: celebrities from the civilians.
dialog: You had to be famous.
dialog: 3.

scene_heading: 4A EXT. SECURITY POINT - LATE AFTERNOON 4A
text: Sidney stands talking to a young PR WOMAN at the security
text: gate. He has a small, ugly PIG on a leash.
speaker_heading: PR WOMAN
dialog: Babe?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Babe Three. Yeah.
text: She looks doubtfully at the pig.
speaker_heading: PR WOMAN
dialog: Babe was a cute little piglet.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Harry Potter used to be a cute
dialog: little piglet too. What do you
dialog: want? Tempus Fugits...
speaker_heading: PR WOMAN
dialog: He hasn't got any ID.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: How many pigs are coming tonight?
dialog: Look, I was told to bring him,
dialog: hand him over to the producer,
dialog: Bob Milton, inside. You want me
dialog: to leave him here with you,
dialog: that's fine...
speaker_heading: PR WOMAN
dialog: No, you can't leave him with me.
dialog: I've got...Hold on, I'll...
text: She looks around, helplessly. She begins to unhook the red
text: rope. Sidney tries to hide his excitement.
speaker_heading: PR WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: If you're positive that you're
dialog: supposed to...
text: An OLDER PR WOMAN stalks over.
speaker_heading: OLDER PR WOMAN
speaker_heading: (ICILY)
dialog: Well, well, Sidney Young.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (RUMBLED)
dialog: Well, well...clipboard Nazi-type
dialog: woman.
text: She turns to the SECURITY standing beside them.
speaker_heading: OLDER PR WOMAN
text: The pig doesn't get in.
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She starts to walk away.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: What about me?
speaker_heading: OLDER PR WOMAN
dialog: I was talking about you.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 5 MOMENTS LATER 5
text: Sidney and the Pig are being "escorted" away from the red
dialog: carpet by the Security.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (V.O.)
dialog: The Looky-Loos dream is that one
dialog: day they will somehow get to
dialog: mingle with the stars. But the
dialog: Industry can't allow any
dialog: mingling. Stars have to be kept
dialog: away from civilians, have to be
dialog: quarantined, so they don't become
dialog: normal. Like us.
text: They pass a ravishing HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS walking the other
text: way. She looks curiously at the pig as she passes. Sidney
text: stares after her, longingly.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 6 INT. SANDERSON HOTEL - EVENING 6
text: TRACKING through the doors and into the lobby of the
dialog: exclusive hotel.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (V.O.)
dialog: But after the awards come the
dialog: parties - the Miramax Party, the
dialog: London Records Party and, best of
dialog: all - the Sharps Magazine Party,
dialog: so exclusive that there are no
dialog: pass-alongs, no plus-ones, no
dialog: press.
text: We find Sidney checking in at the desk.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Receptionist,
speaker_heading: HORRIFIED)
dialog: How much? I only want to stay for
dialog: one night!

scene_heading: 7 INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER 7
text: Sidney stands in the rising elevator, suit bag in his hand,
text: holdall at his feet.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (V.O.)
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: This is where the movie stars can
text: finally relax, secure in the
dialog: knowledge they are among their
dialog: own kind.
text: We see the PIG'S SNOUT poking out of the zip of the
dialog: holdall.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 8 INT. HOTEL ROOM - EVENING 8
text: Sidney turns from the mirror to face us. He is wearing a
text: WAITER'S UNIFORM of white shirt, waistcoat, and bow tie. He
text: is also wearing a WIG and FALSE MOUSTACHE.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (V.O.)
dialog: And that is when I strike.
text: He picks up a tray of canapés from the bed and looks down
text: to where the Pig watches him from the floor.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I want you in bed by ten. And no
dialog: porn.
text: He tosses the pig one of the canapés.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 9 INT. HOTEL - EVENING 9
text: Sidney, tray in hand, peers around the corner to the
text: entrance to the hotel's roofed COURTYARD. The Older PR
text: Woman we saw earlier stands at the door, a formidable
text: presence. As we watch she greets an approaching CELEBRITY
text: gushingly. Seizing his chance Sidney darts towards the door
text: and, tray held aloft to cover his face, slips through into
text: the courtyard beyond.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 10 INT. HOTEL COURTYARD - SHARPS MAGAZINE PARTY - MOMENTS 10
speaker_heading: LATER
text: ...as Sidney emerges from the washrooms, now dressed only
text: in the white shirt and black trousers. He scoops up a
text: passing glass of champagne, checks his moustache and
text: surveys the courtyard - a room full of glamour: tanned
text: skin, diamonds, beautiful dresses, beautiful suits,
text: champagne. He stands surveying the crowd of A-list
text: celebrities in front of him, dazed.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: You can do this. You belong here.
dialog: You're a star. You're a big,
dialog: bright shining star...
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 11 INT. HOTEL ROOM - EVENING 11
text: The room is trashed - furniture over-turned, mini-bar open
text: and broken bottles all over the floor. A weird squealing
text: which could almost be human is coming from the bathroom.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT MANAGER (O.S.)
dialog: Hello? Sir?
text: The squealing stops.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT MANAGER (CONT'D)
dialog: Is everything alright?
text: The door opens and the Assistant Manager walks in and
text: stands staring around him in horror. Behind him the pig
text: emerges from the bathroom and slips out of the open door,
text: across the corridor and straight into the open lift...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12 INT. SHARPS PARTY - EVENING 12
text: Sidney is talking to a very famous and very drunk Hollywood
dialog: ACTRESS.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: No, when I'm in L.A. I stay at
dialog: the Sunset Marquis, when I'm here
dialog: I always stay at the Sanderson.
dialog: It's, you know, I don't feel at
dialog: home these days unless I'm in a
dialog: hotel.
scene_heading: HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS
dialog: So what do you do?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Oh, I'm a writer. Movie writer.
scene_heading: HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS
dialog: Oh great.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Yeah. Got one in pre-production
dialog: now. You know it's really weird
dialog: running into you like this
dialog: because just the other day I was
dialog: telling the producer I thought
dialog: you'd be perfect for the lead.
text: She starts to laugh.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: No, seriously, you would,
dialog: because, you know, you have this
dialog: mixture of intelligence and
dialog: beauty and fragility that we're
dialog: looking for and, uh...
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: What's the film?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Tits of Fury.
text: She laughs.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: I'm joking, I'm just...It's a bio-
dialog: pic. About Greta Garbo. That's
dialog: why I thought of you. You have
dialog: those amazing cheek-bones
dialog: and...are they real? Have you had
dialog: plastic surgery?
scene_heading: HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS
dialog: No. Have you?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Me? No, hardly anything. A penis
dialog: reduction as a child, that's
dialog: pretty much...
text: She laughs again, snorting into her drink. Sidney can't
dialog: believe this - she likes him!
dialog: 
scene_heading: 13 INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - EVENING 13
text: The lift doors glide open and the Pig trots out and around
text: the corner. The PR Woman is still at the door to the
text: courtyard, berating one of her staff. The Pig sails past
text: them both, unnoticed, and disappears into the party.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 14 INT. SHARPES PARTY - EVENING 14
text: A YOUNG MAN sits drinking at a table. He slips a little bag
text: of Ecstasy from his pocket and takes one.
scene_heading: UNDER THE TABLE
text: As the Young Man pushes the bag back into his pocket. The
text: Pig sits at his feet watching as the little bag slips back
text: out and DROPS to the floor. The Pig sniffs at the bag...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 15 SIDNEY AND HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS 15
text: ...still talking. The place is crammed now, and hot. Sidney
text: wipes sweat from his forehead.
scene_heading: HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS
dialog: Oh god, I'm drunk.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Are you?
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS
dialog: I'm so drunk. I haven't eaten
dialog: and...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: You feel okay? Because my room's
dialog: just upstairs if you want to lie
dialog: down or, or loosen any, you know,
dialog: morals or...
scene_heading: HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: What is your name again?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Clark. Clark Baxter.
text: He takes a sip of his champagne and his moustache comes
text: loose and hangs limply from his face.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: How'd you do?
text: The Actress stares at him in surprise but Sidney doesn't
text: notice - he is staring past her to where there is something
text: of a COMMOTION amongst the guests. The PR Woman is hurrying
text: across the room, hissing into her ear-piece. Somebody
text: screams. Then to Sidney's horror a group of guests scatter
text: in panic and the cause of the commotion is revealed: the
text: Pig charges into view, heading straight for him.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (MUTTERING)
dialog: Oh, shit...
text: The Pig suddenly skids to a halt and stares at Sidney with
text: hot eyes. The PR Woman follows the Pig's gaze and spots
dialog: Sidney.
speaker_heading: OLDER PR WOMAN
speaker_heading: (INTO HEADSET)
dialog: Sarah, get security! Code Red.
dialog: Sidney Young got in!
scene_heading: HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS
speaker_heading: (FEARFULLY)
dialog: Who's Sidney Young?
text: Before Sidney can answer the Pig charges.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Oh, shit!
text: Sidney turns and legs it.
scene_heading: ACROSS THE ROOM
text: We are looking OVER THE SHOULDER of a tall grey-haired MAN
text: who stands in the shadows watching Sidney run past. This is
text: CLAYTON HARDING, his face hidden for the time being.
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
text: He lights a cigarette with a thoughtful air and watches
text: Sidney's flight, rolling the BOOK OF MATCHES between his
dialog: fingers.
scene_heading: BACK WITH SIDNEY
text: ...as the Pig catches up with him and lunges at his ankles.
text: Sidney screams, trips and flies through the air, wig
text: spinning free, hurtling straight towards a table of
text: startled celebrities. We FREEZE FRAME.
scene_heading: SUPERED TITLE - "How To Lose Friends &amp; Alienate People."
text: We hear the opening of David Bowie's Star.

scene_heading: 16 INT. HOTEL CORRIDORS - LATER 16

speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:

scene_heading: 16A EXT. LONDON FLAT - DAY 16A
text: A seedy flat in Shepherds bush.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 17 INT. SIDNEY'S FLAT - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON 17
text: Sidney lies in bed reading a newspaper in his underwear. A
text: phone is RINGING in the next room.
text: Sidney begins to cut out a photograph from one of the
text: papers - Sidney struggling with an irate Clint Eastwood and
text: some Security Men. The phone continues to ring.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (CALLING)
dialog: Will you get that? (Beat) Will
dialog: you get the phone?
text: Sighing he gets up and scratching himself, stumbles through
dialog: to...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 18 LIVING ROOM 18
text: ...which we see is, bizarrely, an OFFICE - full of an odd
text: assortment of JOURNALISTS, desks, antiquated computers and
text: an old fax machine. The walls are lined with past covers
text: from Sidney's magazine - The Post-Modern Review. One bears
text: a photograph of Victoria Beckham with the title "Posh
dialog: Spice? Like Fuck She Is."
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A JOURNALIST is talking on the phone by the door. The other
text: phone is still ringing.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: Look, we don't hate celebrities
dialog: at the Post-Modern Review, okay?
dialog: We just don't think they should
dialog: be taking themselves so
dialog: seriously. For us a celebrity is
text: a text to be deconstructed. Apart
dialog: from Costner obviously.
text: Sidney edges past him to where a LARGE WOMAN and a
text: histrionic THIN MAN are in the middle of a argument,
text: encouraged by the other members of staff.
speaker_heading: THIN MAN
speaker_heading: (SHRILL)
dialog: I wouldn't do this the honour of
dialog: calling it a review. It's a
dialog: puerile, personal attack in, in
dialog: alcoholic prose, in which
dialog: incidentally you manage to
dialog: misquote both Derrida and
dialog: Lyotard. I am a...
speaker_heading: LARGE WOMAN
speaker_heading: (CALMLY)
dialog: Girl.
speaker_heading: THIN MAN
dialog: ...an internationally respected
dialog: academic and...
speaker_heading: LARGE WOMAN
dialog: Prick.
speaker_heading: THIN MAN
dialog: ...author of a very well received
dialog: book on the history of culture
dialog: and a...
speaker_heading: LARGE WOMAN
dialog: Fuckwit.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (threading his way past)
dialog: Couldn't one of you answer the
dialog: phone?
text: As the argument continues behind him he reaches the phone
text: with a bored YOUNG MAN sitting by it.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Will you answer that? What do I
dialog: pay you for?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: You don't pay me.
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Just get the phone!
text: The Young Man answers the phone.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Post-Modern Review.
speaker_heading: THIN MAN
dialog: Sidney, if she doesn't apologise
dialog: I'm quitting.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (to the Large Woman)
dialog: George can't leave. You'll have
dialog: to apologise.
speaker_heading: LARGE WOMAN
dialog: Why can't George leave?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
text: He owns the fax machine.
text: Sidney notices the Young Man is staring at him with a
text: scared expression.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: It's Sharps Magazine.
text: Sidney stops smiling.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: We're finished.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: We're not finished.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: They sue, we're finished.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Shut up. (To the others) Will you
dialog: be quiet!
text: They ignore him and continue bickering. Sidney picks up the

speaker_heading: MAN (O.S.)

text: SHOOTING FROM BEHIND Clayton Harding's swivel chair - all

scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING
dialog: I saw you at my party, just
dialog: before you ruined it with your
dialog: little pig stunt.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (OVER PHONE)
dialog: You liked that?
scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING
dialog: Sure.
text: On his desk we see a few copies the Post-Modern Review -
text: glimpses of stars on the covers - Catherine Zeta-Jones,
text: Orlando Bloom... Clayton's hand sifts one copy from the
text: others and holds it up - the cover depicts CLAYTON HIMSELF -
text: patrician handsome, stern, photo-shopped so that he appears
text: to be NAKED. A headline reads "Clayton Harding - The

speaker_heading: SIDNEY

dialog: That's a water sir.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Well that's...that's not right,

text: A young woman has been sitting on the other side of Sidney.
text: This is ALISON OLSEN (20s) smart, attractive, dressed in an

text: She looks up and notices Sidney.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: I'm sorry, my boyfriend's sitting

text: Sidney gets up and examines the stool.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Is he? He's fucking small isn't

speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: That's his White Russian. He'll

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (TO BARMAN)

speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm the Cultural Editor.

speaker_heading: ALISON

speaker_heading: SIDNEY

speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Morgan Freeman?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
text: No, in the headlock.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: You had this laminated?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Oh just give it...
text: He snatches the photograph back, catching Alison's glass in

speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Shit!
dialog: 18.
dialog:

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: It's okay. It's okay. I've got

speaker_heading: ALISON

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Sorry.

speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: WOMAN

scene_heading: 30 INT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 30

text: they stand gasping for breath.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I'm gonna powder my nose. Why
dialog: don't you put on something a
dialog: little more romantic?
text: She staggers off down the hall. Sidney, giddy with
text: excitement, searches through some LPs and puts one on his
text: old turntable. It's Ace of Spades by Motorhead. He staggers
text: around, playing air-guitar for a moment.
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
text: The music is suddenly switched off. He turns to find Mrs

text: at him.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Mrs Lebowski...
speaker_heading: MRS KOWALSKI
dialog: Kowalski. You know what time it

dialog: open...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (trying to seem sober)
dialog: Was it? Fuck. I mean, shit.
dialog: Sorry. I just...met an old friend
dialog: and brought them back...
text: The Woman staggers back into the room, her back to us. She
text: is NAKED. She is also surprisingly muscular.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: ...for a little...
text: He notices the woman. His gaze drops to below the waist.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)

scene_heading: 31 INT. BEDROOM - MORNING 31

scene_heading: 32 BATHROOM 32

dialog: first day.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: You can do this! You can do this!

dialog: 
scene_heading: 33 LIVING ROOM 33
text: Sidney walks into the room, still humming the theme tune,
text: shadow boxing. He opens the blinds and turns to the couch.
text: The "Woman" wakes up from where she has been sleeping on
text: the couch and gazes blearily at Sidney.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Quick coffee Bob and then you've
dialog: got to go.

scene_heading: 34 EXT. TIMES SQUARE - MORNING 34

text: caption "Young, Dumb and Full of Cum."The T-shirt is riding
text: up a little over his belly.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (V.O.)

dialog: 
scene_heading: 35 INT. HEYWOOD BUILDING - ENTRANCE SECURITY - MORNING 35
text: As the song continues Sidney, still swaggering, is escorted

text: impressive cavern of chrome and glass.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (V.O.)
dialog: This is my building.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 36 INT. LIFT - MOMENTS LATER 36
text: Sidney leans nonchalantly against the wall of the lift
text: examining the Chic Assistant and two stunningly beautiful
text: MODELS who are in conversation. Sidney manages to catch the
text: attention of one of the models and flashes what he believes
text: is a rakish smile. In return he receives an icy glare.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (V.O.)
dialog: These are my models.

scene_heading: 37 INT. SHARPS MAGAZINE - CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 37

speaker_heading: SIDNEY (V.O.)
dialog: ...is my Boss.
scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING
dialog: What the fuck are you wearing?
text: The song grinds to an abrupt halt. Sidney loses a quantity
text: of swagger. He examines his T-shirt.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: You like it? I brought you one.
text: He takes a T-shirt from his satchel and hands it to
dialog: Harding.
scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING
dialog: Thanks.
text: Casually he flings the shirt out of the open window behind
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D)
dialog: Next time you come here dressed
dialog: like that, you follow the shirt.
dialog: You understand?
text: Sidney nods dumbly.
speaker_heading: CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D)
dialog: Sit down. How was the flight?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (SITTING)
dialog: Good. Thanks for the business
dialog: class tickets, Clay.
text: Harding regards him gravely.
scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING
dialog: That was a mistake. And don't
dialog: call me Clay.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Oh. Well, if it's any consolation
dialog: I got downgraded anyway.
scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING
speaker_heading: (GRAVELY)
dialog: That is some consolation.
text: Sidney notices that the copy of The Post-Modern Review is
text: on the desk - Clayton NAKED.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (NERVOUSLY)
dialog: Ha! That was just a little, uh...
dialog: as it happens I'm a big fan of

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Harding stares at Sidney.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, you've...you've actually
dialog: been a big influence on me and I
dialog: really think together we can
dialog: inject a bit of that Snipe spirit
dialog: into this magazine. Now I've got
dialog: a few ideas that I'd like to...
scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING
speaker_heading: (INTERRUPTING)
dialog: You think you've arrived, doncha?
dialog: Well I hate to break it to you,
dialog: but you're only in the first
dialog: room. It's not nothing, don't get
dialog: me wrong, but there are plenty of
dialog: people in this town who never
text: made it past the first room.
dialog: After a year or so, maybe longer,
dialog: you'll discover a secret doorway
text: at the back of the first room
dialog: that leads to the second.
dialog: Eventually, if you're lucky,
dialog: you'll discover another doorway
text: back of the second room that
text: leads to the third.
text: He gazes at Sidney through narrowed eyes.
speaker_heading: CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D)
text: There are seven rooms in all.
dialog: You're in the first, I'm in the
dialog: seventh, and doncha forget it
text: Sidney has been listening with a frown of concentration.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: So...if I make it to the Seventh
dialog: Room - will I become a true Jedi
dialog: Knight?
text: Harding exhales smoke and puts out his cigarette.
scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING
dialog: Which brings us to the subject of
dialog: your sense of humour. I had a
dialog: look through your "magazine"
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: What'd you think?
text: Clayton swivels in his chair and stares thoughtfully out
text: over the Manhattan skyline.
scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING
dialog: Oh, I thought it was...kinda
dialog: snarky. And bitter. And...
dialog: witless.
dialog: 24.
dialog:

speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX

speaker_heading: CLOTHES)
dialog: Well, Sidney. We've only just met

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
dialog: I know your Hi-jinx gave you a
dialog: certain notoriety back in Olde
dialog: England but things are going to
dialog: be a bit different here. Harding
dialog: wants me to be your Rabbi, show

dialog: what we do at I Spy?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: You photograph famous people when
dialog: they're drunk?
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
speaker_heading: (IGNORING HIM)
dialog: I Spy is the nation's window onto
dialog: High Society. The Looky-Loos read
dialog: us because...well, They Weren't
dialog: There. The Glitterati read us
dialog: because we tell them They Were
dialog: There. For this system to work we
dialog: have to know where There is.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: So...when we go out to clubs and
dialog: things...would that, would that

speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
dialog: This isn't a vacation. It's a

speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)
dialog: When we do go out you're going to

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Okay. What do you mean by
dialog: suitable?
text: Maddox gestures at Sidney's body.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
dialog: Something that covers all of this

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Is that Mussolini?
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX

dialog: No, Sidney, that's Richard

speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
speaker_heading: (ICILY)
dialog: That's his daughter, Elizabeth;

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (FLUSTERED)

speaker_heading: ALISON

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I'm not sure what I'm supposed to

speaker_heading: ALISON

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: It's fashion sensitive. If you're

text: Anna stares at this strange man with the burger, baffled.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: But I am wearing Prada.
text: The lift stops and she gets out. Alison gets in, sees

text: read. The lift begins to rise again.
text: Through it's glass doors we see the different floors
text: passing, different publications - each a hive of sober,

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (MOUTH FULL)
dialog: This isn't what I expected.
text: Alison recoils slightly.
speaker_heading: ALISON

dialog: Quips. Look at them. Not one of
text: them is drunk.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: It's called being a professional.
dialog: You should try it some time.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY

speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: By "you" do you mean "human?"

text: For a moment Alison is speechless with anger.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: You...you...arrogant...
text: The lift stops and a TALL WOMAN enters. She is expensively
text: dressed, wears Chanel dark glasses, an expression of
text: granite and an air of superhuman froideur.
text: Alison exchanges the slightest of nods with her and stares
text: tensely ahead. Only Sidney, busy chewing, is oblivious to
text: the plunge in temperature.
text: For a moment there is only the soft whir of the lift. Then
text: Sidney begins to choke on some burger. He wheezes for a
text: moment, gagging.
text: The Woman stiffens slightly but shows no other sign of
text: having noticed the revolting noises coming from behind her.
text: Alison closes her eyes.
text: Sidney gives a violent cough and a chunk of chewed burger
text: and coleslaw flies out of his mouth and lands on the back

text: the young Clayton Harding. He
text: looks at me and sees his glory
dialog: days.
speaker_heading: ALISON
speaker_heading: (SARCASTIC)
dialog: His glory days? Sharps has won
dialog: fourteen National Magazine awards
dialog: and increased its advertising
dialog: pages by more than 60 percent
dialog: since he took over. He's paid
dialog: millions of dollars a year. He
text: lives in a Bank Street townhouse,
dialog: and weekends in the Hamptons.
dialog: Clayton Harding is one of the
dialog: lynchpins of the media-industrial
dialog: complex.

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Yeah, but don't worry. I think I

scene_heading: 44 INT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - EVENING 44
text: The phone is ringing. Sidney walks in from the bedroom,
text: changing into his old brown suit. The answer machine kicks
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (O.S.)
dialog: (over answer machine)
dialog: You've reached Sidney Young. I'm
dialog: sorry but my answering machine is
dialog: out of order, so the voice you
dialog: are hearing is actually me.
text: The machine BEEPS. Sidney smirks at his joke and is
text: reaching for the phone when we hear the caller - an older
text: man, an upper-class English accent.
speaker_heading: OLDER MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: (over answer machine)
dialog: Sidney? Are you there?
text: Sidney stops in his tracks, something complicated and
text: fearful crossing his face.
speaker_heading: OLDER MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Sidney? Are you there?
text: Sidney tiptoes back out of the room.
speaker_heading: OLDER MAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)

text: out the window, entranced by the bright lights as they pass
dialog: by...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 46 EXT. HOTEL - FUND-RAISER PARTY - NIGHT 46
text: The rooftop swimming pool of a hotel. Flowers everywhere,
text: including in the pool. Guests mill around drinking. We find
text: Sidney working his way through the throng to where Alison
dialog: stands.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (MOUTH FULL)
dialog: There's a couple of hundred
dialog: grands worth of food here and I
dialog: swear I'm the only person eating
dialog: it. You want some?
text: Alison recoils. Sidney does a little nerdy dance to the
text: music as he eats.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: This place is amazing. It's wall
dialog: to wall totty.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Wall to wall what?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Totty. Babes. Sexually attractive
dialog: women.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Do you mind?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: What?
text: Maddox joins them. A man passes, nods respectfully at
dialog: Maddox.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at that. All night people
dialog: have been treating us like we're
dialog: royalty. In London, the
dialog: journalist's motto is "Everybody
dialog: hates us and we don't care."
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
dialog: Well, now you're one of the High
dialog: Priests of what's Hot and what's
dialog: Not. So what were you two talking
dialog: about?
dialog: 34.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALISON

dialog: abundance of "Totty" here.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
speaker_heading: (ENJOYING THIS)
dialog: Uh-oh. I don't think Miss Olsen
dialog: approves of you, Sidney.
text: Sidney watches some beautiful women pass, dripping
dialog: diamonds.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I shouldn't be here. I get thrown
dialog: out of places like this.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
dialog: This? This is a McDonald's. I
dialog: hate disease parties. (Off
dialog: Sidney's puzzled look) Fund-
dialog: raisers.
text: Someone's CELL PHONE RINGS. All of the guests automatically
dialog: check their cells.
text: An OLDER ATTRACTIVE WOMAN walks over - she's a little
dialog: drunk.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Lawrence Maddox? Oh my
dialog: goodness... Long time.
text: Maddox examines her coolly.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
dialog: Rachel. How are you?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Well, I'm just wonderful.
dialog: Wonderful. How are you?
text: Lawrence smiles and looks around him without answering.
text: Rachel tries again.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Funny I should run into you. I've
dialog: just done this great little film
dialog: called Five Boroughs and it's you
dialog: know, low-budget, first-time
dialog: director but very, uh, moving
dialog: and... Hey, maybe you could do a
dialog: little...?
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A handsome YOUNG MAN passes by. Maddox instantly turns away
dialog: from Rachel.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
speaker_heading: (SMOOTHLY)
dialog: Angelo, good to see you.
text: Rachel hovers for a moment, embarrassed by her abrupt
text: dismissal then slips away. Sidney watches her go, feeling
dialog: for her.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (TO MADDOX)
dialog: You know that was Rachel Petkoff?
dialog: She's a fantastic actress. Hasn't
dialog: done anything for years, but, in
dialog: her day...
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
speaker_heading: (COOLLY)
dialog: I'm sure.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Seriously, I've heard about that
dialog: film. I think she's going to make
dialog: a come back. We should get there
dialog: first, do a profile or something
dialog: before everyone else...
text: Maddox isn't listening. Instead he greets a fat, angry-
text: looking VERY YOUNG MAN. This is VINCENT LEPAK, wearing his
dialog: customary SHADES.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
speaker_heading: (FAWNING)
dialog: Vincent! Great to see you.
dialog: Children, I'd like to introduce
dialog: you to Vincent Lepak, enfant
dialog: terrible and in, my opinion, the
dialog: most exciting new director in
dialog: American cinema.
text: Vincent nods, frowning, looks around.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I think this is the worst

dialog: whole life.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
dialog: It's a rat fuck, isn't it?
text: Sidney walks away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 47 ANGLE ON RACHEL 47

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Excuse me? Aren't you Rachel
dialog: Petkoff?
text: Rachel turns to look at him.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is sort of embarrassing
dialog: but...
text: He holds out a napkin.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Could I have your autograph?
text: Rachel, suspecting she is the target of ridicule, looks
text: around to see if there's an audience.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm a big fan.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
speaker_heading: (HARD)
dialog: Is that so?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Absolutely. I must have seen
dialog: everything you've been in. Those
dialog: episodes of The Love Boat and the
dialog: Bionic Woman? The Song Birds, In
dialog: The Night...I've even seen your
dialog: first ever TV appearance. The
dialog: Twilight Zone - House of Mirrors.
dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
speaker_heading: (THROWN)
dialog: Right...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: My all time favorite? A Day Too
dialog: Long. (He means it) You were
dialog: really great in that.
text: Rachel stares at him. She hides her emotion with a bright
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: What's your name, honey?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Sidney Young.
text: She takes the napkin and pen, her face glowing.

scene_heading: 48 ANGLE ON VINCENT 48
dialog: ...holding court to Maddox, Alison and some of the
text: Glitterati. Sidney joins them, eating more food.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You look around and it's all
dialog: shit. No-one is making movies
dialog: that are fucking worthwhile.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
dialog: I'd have to disagree with you,
dialog: Vincent.
text: Vincent looks at him, displeased.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)
dialog: You're making movies that are
dialog: worthwhile.
text: Vincent accepts this with a curt nod.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: This is what I'm saying. You have
dialog: to inspire yourself. I am my role-
dialog: model. I want to be me...
text: He stares angrily around, handing his empty glass to his
text: waiting assistant who immediately replaces it with a full
text: one from a passing tray. Sidney watches him with dislike.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (SUDDENLY)
dialog: Greatest film ever made?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: What's the greatest film ever
dialog: made? (To Alison) Go on. Have a
dialog: guess.
speaker_heading: ALISON
speaker_heading: (IRRITATED)
dialog: Well, that's...I don't think
dialog: there is one single film that...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Have a guess.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
speaker_heading: (SNEERING)
dialog: Yeah, have a guess - what is the
dialog: greatest film ever made?
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALISON
speaker_heading: (EMBARRASSED)
dialog: I don't, uh...well personally I
dialog: love La Dolce Vita but...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Incorrect. Con Air.
speaker_heading: ALISON
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Uhuh, Con Air. It's got
dialog: everything. Malkovich for your
dialog: acting chops, Nicky Cage for
dialog: action, Buscemi for comedy, John
dialog: Cusack for the Gays. It's a
dialog: smorgasbord.
text: The group study him, trying to work out if this is irony or
text: idiocy. Maddox is staring daggers at him. An extremely
text: thin, fashionably dressed woman smiles at Sidney.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I don't think we've been
dialog: introduced?
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
dialog: Mister Young, this is Eleanor
dialog: Johnson, Queen of New York.
dialog: Eleanor this is Sidney Young.
dialog: He's from England and he's our
dialog: very own Idiot Savant. Without
dialog: the Savant.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR JOHNSON
dialog: Well, it's always nice to have
dialog: fresh blood at these things. (To
dialog: Maddox) Which reminds me, I'm
dialog: here with Sophie Maes, I want you
dialog: to meet her. New film, The
text: Suffragette coming out, the buzz
dialog: is A-mazing. The release is tied
dialog: in with the roll-out of the
dialog: Reebok campaign, and now Louis
dialog: Vuitton's on the line. This train
text: is leaving the station Lawrence.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (TO ELEANOR)
dialog: So, you're a publicist?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR JOHNSON
dialog: I don't really like that word,
dialog: Sidney.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: What should I call you?
dialog: 39.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELEANOR JOHNSON
dialog: You can call me Eleanor.
text: She stares past him, across the pool.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR JOHNSON (CONT'D)
text: There she is.
text: They turn to see a young woman standing across the pool
dialog: from them. This is SOPHIE MAES - a natural beauty,
text: statuesque, no make-up, hair simply pulled back.
text: Sophie tries to walk around the pool to join them but finds
text: she can't work her way through the crowd. She turns to her
text: right but finds her way similarly blocked.
text: She hesitates for a moment and then with a shrug climbs
text: down into the pool, the water up to her chest, and begins
text: to walk through the floating flowers towards them.
text: Sidney stares at her, TRANSFIXED. Alison notices this with
text: some contempt.
text: Gradually everyone notices Sophie and stops to look.
text: Having reached the other side, Sophie ascends the pool
text: steps, laughing, her dress clinging to her: Venus rising
text: from the waves. The Photographers appear, snapping merrily
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
speaker_heading: (MURMURING)
dialog: Oh, this one will go far.

scene_heading: 49 INT. HOTEL - LATER 49
text: Sophie, still in her wet dress, Eleanor and Sophie's

speaker_heading: ELEANOR JOHNSON
dialog: (on cell phone)
dialog: Where's the car? What's it doing
dialog: at the back? Forget what I said.
dialog: I want the car at the front. Now.
text: Sidney finds himself walking alongside Sophie and Maddox,
text: trying not to stare at Sophie's breasts.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE MAES
dialog: ...I just think it's terrible the
dialog: way we're still exploiting
dialog: animals. That's why, you know,
dialog: I won't wear fur or leather, I
dialog: won't wear make-up, I'm
dialog: vegetarian.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I'm with you...
dialog: 40.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Sophie turns to him with a vague smile.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I won't eat anything with, you
dialog: know, eyebrows.
text: He snickers nervously.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Or if it can chuckle. I won't eat
text: animals that can chuckle.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I'm sorry, I can't understand
dialog: your accent?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (EMBARRASSED)
dialog: Nothing, just, uh...So you're an
dialog: actress? Have I seen you in
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE MAES
dialog: I don't know. Have you?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: No. (Trying again) So you haven't
dialog: won any Oscars yet?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE MAES
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Because I would certainly vote
dialog: for you for best supporting
dialog: dress! Huh, huh, huh....
speaker_heading: SOPHIE MAES
speaker_heading: (STRUGGLING TO
speaker_heading: UNDERSTAND HIM)
dialog: I haven't been nominated for
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: No, I'm just...I'm saying you
dialog: look...
text: They have reached the front entrance of the hotel. Eleanor
text: steps between them.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR JOHNSON
speaker_heading: (TO SOPHIE)
dialog: Are you ready dear?
text: The front doors glide open to reveal a LEGION OF PAPARAZZI
text: waiting outside. As Sophie steps outside there is a sudden
text: roar of photographers shouting and the night sky blazes
text: white as HUNDREDS OF CAMERAS FLASH SIMULTANEOUSLY.
dialog: 41.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: REVERSE - the group framed in the entrance-way - blinded
text: by the glare, squinting. Only Sophie has her eyes open,
text: smiling, looking like a star.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 50 EXT. OUTSIDE HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER 50
text: The Paparazzi are still crowding around the group as they
text: make their way to the waiting car.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
speaker_heading: (TO ALISON)
dialog: We're going on to the Circle
dialog: Club. I'll see you tomorrow.
speaker_heading: ALISON
speaker_heading: (TIGHT)
dialog: Okay. Good night.
text: Maddox slips his jacket around Sophie's shoulders.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Aren't you cold?
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
dialog: I'm from Canada, land of ice and
dialog: snow.
text: They get into the car. Sidney tries to follow them.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Budge up.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I'm coming to the club.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
dialog: Sorry, you're not on the list.
text: A small CHIHUAHUA - CUBA - on Sophie's lap snarls at
dialog: Sidney.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)
dialog: See? Even Cuba says so.
text: Maddox closes the door and the car glides away, Sophie
text: kissing the dog on the nose. The Paparazzi hurry back to
text: the entrance as another celebrity emerges, leaving Alison
text: and Sidney staring after the car.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (FUMING)
dialog: That's... that turns my stomach.
dialog: Pawing her like that. He's old
dialog: enough to be her father.
dialog: 42.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALISON
speaker_heading: (IRRITATED)
dialog: No he isn't.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Yes he is. I started producing
dialog: sperm when I was thirteen, so you
dialog: know, technically...
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: For your information he wasn't
text: pawing her! He was just doing his
dialog: job! In case you haven't noticed
dialog: Sharps has to have a star on the
dialog: cover every month. And most of
dialog: those stars are clients of
dialog: Eleanor's. So do not piss her
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: She's a flak. Hacks don't take
dialog: orders from flaks. And I don't
dialog: think you can call that "doing
dialog: his job." The man had no blood
text: left in his upper body...
speaker_heading: ALISON
speaker_heading: (SNAPPING)
dialog: Will you...? Oh, and next time
dialog: you want to do the hilariously
dialog: ironic I love Con Air skit would
dialog: you mind...?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I wasn't being ironic...
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: ...would you mind not involving
dialog: me, especially in the presence of
dialog: Vincent Lepak who happens to be
dialog: very important.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Yeah, I could tell by the way he
dialog: was allowed to stay up past his
dialog: bed time.
text: The car disappears into the distance. They watch it go.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you think she'd go out with
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Sophie Maes. You think she'll go
dialog: out with me?
dialog: 43.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: No. Girls like Sophie don't date
dialog: journalists. As far as she's
dialog: concerned, you're the help.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: What do you know? A lot of these
text: starlets are lonely. They spend
dialog: their time looking for a man.
text: Alison starts to walk away.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: This is New York, Sidney. Women
dialog: only date men who are
dialog: successful...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY

speaker_heading: ALISON

dialog: ...and tall.

scene_heading: 51 INT. SHARPS MAGAZINE - I SPY AREA - MORNING 51
text: Sidney sits in front of his computer reading the on-line
text: New York Post Page Six. A story on the previous night is
text: accompanied by a large picture of Sophie in her clinging
text: dress. Above the picture is the title Venus Envy. Sidney
text: stares at the picture, entranced.
text: Alison sits at her desk, watching him with contempt. Maddox
text: appears beside them.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Have you seen this? She's

dialog: (reading the card)
dialog: "Thanks for a great night." What
dialog: a sweet kid. Oh, Sidney, about
dialog: last night - word of advice.
dialog: Don't talk to the celebrities,

scene_heading: 52 INT. SHARPS MAGAZINE - CORRIDOR - MORNING 52
text: Sidney walks down the corridor. He slows, his expression
text: changing suddenly.
scene_heading: SIDNEY'S P.O.V - Elizabeth Maddox is walking down the
text: corridor towards us, face set.
text: Sidney keeps on walking, staring to one side of Elizabeth.
text: As they draw level, the heel of one of Elizabeth's shoes
text: snaps off and she lurches sideways, colliding with the wall
text: before sprawling onto the floor in front of Sidney.
text: Sidney hesitates. He notices Alison watching with baited
text: breath from the other end of the corridor. For a moment
text: nobody moves then Sidney steps over Elizabeth's prone form
text: without a word and keeps on walking.
text: Alison gives a sigh of relief, nods in approval and walks
dialog: on.

scene_heading: 53 INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY 53

dialog: Good work Lawrence. Okay, well,
dialog: if that's it for...
text: He starts to get up.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: So, I was thinking, Clay...
text: Clayton, pauses, frowning. Sidney turns to the room,
text: cocksure.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Paris Hilton. I do a profile on
dialog: her as if she's this complete
dialog: recluse, this hermit...(laughing)
dialog: I try and track her down and, you
dialog: know, "Who is the elusive Paris
dialog: Hilton and why is she so
dialog: publicity shy?"
text: He laughs for a moment. No one joins in.
dialog: 45.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING
dialog: That's first room stuff, Sidney.
dialog: And call me Clay one more time
dialog: and see what happens.
text: Harding stalks out of the room. Blushing, Sidney stares

dialog: 
scene_heading: 54 INT. BREAK AREA - AFTERNOON 54
text: Alison sits with her notebook and pen. Behind her some of

speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: No, I'd love these but I'm so fat
dialog: I couldn't...

speaker_heading: INGRID

speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Oh god, that's so sweet.
speaker_heading: INGRID
speaker_heading: (TO ALISON)
text: By the way, post-shoot clear out.

dialog: try?
dialog: 46.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: (another tight smile)
dialog: No, thanks.
text: She looks up as Sidney sits heavily beside her, stares at
text: her with puppy-dog eyes. Alison tries to ignore him for a
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: ALISON (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't mean to be rude Sidney
dialog: but...what the fuck do you want?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Listen, you know how things work
dialog: around here. How am I going to
dialog: get something in the magazine?
text: Alison stares at him.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: I thought all this "fluff" was
dialog: beneath you?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: It is but...things have changed.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: What's changed?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Look, I know people think I'm a
dialog: bit of an idiot and maybe I
dialog: haven't started off too well
dialog: here, but I want...I want...
text: He seems so awkward that Alison begins to soften a little.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: ...I want to have sex with Sophie

text: Alison's expression turns to disgust.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: You're loathsome, you know that?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (OBLIVIOUS)
dialog: I know he's got a head start on
dialog: me but I'm going to win her back.
dialog: Once I get my hooks into a girl,

speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Like ring-worm.

text: decorated with the heads of various CELEBRITIES.
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
text: It's a Shag Tree. It illustrates
dialog: all of the sexual pairings of
dialog: Hollywood's top stars and how
dialog: they interconnect...
text: From under the door slides a piece of paper on which is

dialog: 
scene_heading: 59 EXT. OUTSIDE CIRCLE CLUB - EVENING 59
text: Sidney approaches the Doorman , takes a ten dollar bill
text: from his pocket and hands it to the Doorman. The Doorman

speaker_heading: NATHAN LANE
dialog: Nathan Lane. Nice to meet you.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Great to meet you Nathan. I'm a
dialog: big fan. I love that rat thing
dialog: you played in The Lion King.
speaker_heading: NATHAN LANE
speaker_heading: (PLEASANTLY)
dialog: Actually he's a meer cat.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (absently, checking his
speaker_heading: NOTES)
dialog: Uhuh... Now, I've been doing some
dialog: research and I think you're
dialog: probably quite a private man. Am
dialog: I right?
speaker_heading: NATHAN LANE
dialog: Well...
dialog: 49.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Which is fine, but today, I think
dialog: it would be great to get behind
dialog: the mask.
speaker_heading: NATHAN LANE
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Uh, I don't think there really is
dialog: a mask as such, and I don't wanna
dialog: be a pain, but what I really
dialog: wanna talk about is the new play,
dialog: keep it about the work, you know?
dialog: Is that okay?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Absolutely. Of course. So, first
dialog: question - are you Jewish?
text: Nathan stares at Sidney.
speaker_heading: NATHAN LANE
dialog: I don't see what the relevance of
dialog: that is.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Okay. Next question. The rat
dialog: thing - that's gotta be Disney's
dialog: first gay animal, right? So, I
dialog: was wondering - are you a
dialog: homosexual?
text: Beat. Nathan looks like he might hit Sidney.

scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING

scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING

dialog: 50.
dialog:

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I was just trying to...probe.
scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING
dialog: You wanna probe become a
dialog: proctologist, okay? You can't ask

scene_heading: 63 INT. I SPY AREA - DAY 63
text: Sidney is on the phone. He has been idly applying magic
text: tape to his face, contorting it into a grotesque grimace.
text: The headline of a magazine open in front of him reads:
dialog: "Everyone Loves A Lord: Why British Titles Drive New York
dialog: Women Crazy."
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I'd like to apply for an American

speaker_heading: SIDNEY (O.S.)(CONT'D)

dialog: Oh, fuck...!
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX

speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
speaker_heading: (SMILING SMOOTHLY)
dialog: Well, I'm one of the Friends Of

dialog: 51.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He laughs, Sophie smiles, not getting it. Alison seems
text: immersed in some paper-work.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)
dialog: So how's it feel to be a star?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: No, don't! It's so embarrassing!
dialog: That picture's everywhere now.
dialog: And I had no idea the dress was
dialog: so see-through! And people are
dialog: talking like it was some kind of
dialog: stunt.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR JOHNSON
speaker_heading: (SMOOTHLY)
dialog: Such a cynical age. Hello
dialog: Sidney.
text: Embarrassed, Sidney gets up from under his desk.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Hello! Didn't, didn't know you

speaker_heading: ELEANOR JOHNSON
dialog: Lawrence is taking us to lunch at
dialog: Cipriani.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (JEALOUS)
dialog: Oh great. That's great.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE MAES
dialog: Lawrence? Could I leave Cuba
dialog: here? He doesn't like Italian

speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
dialog: Of course you can. He can stay in

text: Sidney stares at him.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (EMBARRASSED)

speaker_heading: ELEANOR JOHNSON
speaker_heading: (SMILING)

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Uhuh.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR JOHNSON
text: He has a new movie coming out

text: Alison, at the photocopier nearby, listens.
text: Sidney smiles, filled with hope.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: A story? Absolutely. That
dialog: would...I'd love to...
speaker_heading: ELEANOR JOHNSON
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)
dialog: Well, great. Maybe we could get

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Okay. (Beat) What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR JOHNSON
dialog: Well, I'd need to know how we're

dialog: the story, so on.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You want copy approval?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR JOHNSON
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: Any stories written about my
dialog: clients need to be in their best
dialog: interest, that's all. If things
dialog: work out with Vincent we could
dialog: maybe talk about a follow up
dialog: story on Sophie? What do you
dialog: think?
text: Alison listens, her face registering her distaste.
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Sidney looks over at Sophie, struggling with himself.
dialog: Finally...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (RELUCTANTLY)
dialog: I'm sorry, Eleanor, I don't...I
dialog: don't work that way.
text: Alison stares with surprise at Sidney. He just went up in
dialog: her estimation.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR JOHNSON
speaker_heading: (AMUSED)
dialog: Sidney dear, think of it like
dialog: this: you write about one of my
dialog: clients, you are borrowing some
dialog: of their "star-light" to help
dialog: sell your magazine. All I'm
dialog: saying is quid pro quo.
text: Sidney is unable to hold back a snicker.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Their star-light?

scene_heading: 66 INT. MADDOX'S OFFICE - LATER 66
text: Sidney cracks open the door and peers inside. Cuba sits in
text: the middle of the floor, staring at him. He emits a low
dialog: growl.
text: Sidney slides into the room.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Hello Cuba. I'm Uncle Sidney,
dialog: come to see how you are. You
dialog: wanna play? You wanna little
dialog: play?
text: He takes a RUBBER BALL out of his pocket and holds it up
dialog: for the dog to see.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Fetch!
text: He tosses the ball in the air. Cuba runs after it and
text: trots back, stumpy tail wagging, the ball in its teeth.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: That's it! That's it!
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He strokes the dog.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: We're gonna be best pals aren't
dialog: we? You're going to like me more
dialog: than that prick Maddox, aren't
dialog: you? Fetch!
text: He tosses the ball again which promptly bounces off the
text: wall straight out of the half open window.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: No!
text: Cuba is already running towards the window...
text: Sidney's yell slows and distorts as we move to SLOW
dialog: MOTION...
text: Sidney springs forward, leaping onto the desk and then in
text: one bound onto a FILING CABINET by the window, sending it
text: rocking slightly forward.
text: Cuba, bounding forward, jumps into the air...
text: Sidney just manages to slam the window SHUT as...
text: BACK IN NORMAL TIME...
text: Cuba bounces off the glass with a yelp and drops to the
dialog: floor.
text: Sidney heaves a sigh of relief.
text: Then a METAL SCULPTURE on the tilted filing cabinet slides
text: forward and drops with a TERMINAL THUD ON THE DOG BELOW.
dialog: Silence.
text: Sidney stares down to the floor.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)

scene_heading: 67 INT. CORRIDOR - LATER 67
text: Sidney stands at the lift holding a bulging bag.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (waiting for the lift)
dialog: C'mon...C'mon...
text: Alison walks past, sees him and does a double-take.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: (seeing her coming)
dialog: Shit, shit, shit...
dialog: 55.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: That's my bag.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I'm just...just borrowing it.
dialog: I'll bring it straight back.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What are you talking about? Give
dialog: it back.
text: She reaches out to take the bag. Sidney holds on
dialog: desperately.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Stop it! Give me the...
text: She tugs violently, pulling the bag open. A small PAW lolls
text: out. Alison freezes staring at it. Silence.
speaker_heading: ALISON (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)
dialog: Oh my God.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: It was an accident.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Oh my God.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I was just trying to make

dialog: Please don't tell her.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE MAES (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (CALLING)
dialog: Cuba? Cuba?
text: Startled, Sidney darts into Maddox's office.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 67A INT. MADDOX'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 67A
text: As footsteps and voices approach Sidney tugs wildly at
text: Maddox's window, trying to open it. Alison follows him in.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: What are you doing? You can't...!
text: He jerks the window open and empties Cuba out of it,
text: slamming it shut just as Sophie, Eleanor and Lawrence walk
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
dialog: Alison, have you seen Cuba?
dialog: 56.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALISON
speaker_heading: (BEWILDERED)
dialog: W-What?
text: She darts a glance over to where Sidney stands with his
text: back to the window, gazing at her pleadingly. From behind
text: him comes a faint creaking sound.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR JOHNSON
speaker_heading: (SNAPPING)
dialog: Sophie's dog! Have you seen him?
text: Sidney hangs his head, awaiting the coup de grace.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Uh...no. No idea.
text: Sidney stares at her in amazement.
text: Behind him Cuba's body appears at the window, rising into
text: view on a WINDOW WASHING PLATFORM. A Window Washer, stands
text: at the other end of the cradle, bobbing his head to the
text: music in his headphones.
text: Alison stares at the dog in horror while the others talk,
text: oblivious.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
dialog: Don't worry, he couldn't have got
dialog: very far.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE MAES
speaker_heading: (WAILING)

scene_heading: 68 INT. CLAYTON HARDING'S OFFICE - DAY 68
text: Clayton stands at the window. He is DRUNK. There is a knock
text: at the door and Sidney walks in.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (NERVOUSLY)
dialog: Clayton? Have you got a minute?
text: Clayton lights a cigarette, stares out of the window.
text: Sidney comes in.
scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING
dialog: Did they find that rat yet?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: No...Not yet. I think maybe he
dialog: got out the building?
text: Sidney hovers.
dialog: 57.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Congratulations on the Man of the
dialog: Year thing. How was the lunch?
scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING
dialog: I don't know. Thousand dollars a
dialog: plate, all I could taste was ass.
dialog: I'm kissing their ass, they're
dialog: kissing my ass. (Beat) I get this
dialog: dream sometimes. Someone's set
dialog: fire to the building - Heywoods -
dialog: Sharps magazine - the whole
text: thing, it's going up in flames.
dialog: My analyst thinks it's an anxiety
dialog: dream. I never tell him how happy

text: Sidney isn't sure what to say. Finally...
speaker_heading: CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you want?
text: Sidney takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I want to do a story on Vincent
text: Lepak. Not a puff-piece.
text: Something funny, but with teeth.
dialog: The kind of thing Snipe would
dialog: have done. Everyone's treating
dialog: him like he's a genius and he's
dialog: an idiot.
text: Clayton notices the CLOSET-DOOR beside him and opens it. He
text: stares at the rows of blue shirts hanging in there. He
text: takes an armful out and examines them.
scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING
dialog: Look at these things. How'd I get
text: a closet full of blue fucking
dialog: shirts?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Um...I don't know.
scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING
dialog: I don't know either. This is an

dialog: I even got a fucking closet?
text: He drops the shirts.
speaker_heading: CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D)
dialog: Do it.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY

dialog: Do it?
dialog: 58.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING
dialog: Fuck it. Yeah. Do it. He's an

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Thanks Clayton!
scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING
dialog: You're my little Hit Man.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (BEAMING)

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (HAPPILY)

speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: I'm Sophie Maes' assistant. I'm

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (looking past her)

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (SNORTING DERISIVELY)

speaker_heading: ASSISTANT

speaker_heading: SIDNEY

speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: Yes, but...they were dead.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: All of them?
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT

scene_heading: 70 INT. BAR - EVENING 70
text: Alison sits at the bar, staring at her notebook, a pen held

dialog: 60.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: My God, you're like a serial

speaker_heading: ALISON
speaker_heading: (QUICKLY)
dialog: I don't want to know.

dialog: uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Okay. (Beat) Well, I just...I
dialog: just wanted to say...about not
dialog: telling them...I really
dialog: appreciated it. It was good of
dialog: you and, and...you know...not

speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: It's okay.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Why didn't you?
text: Alison sighs.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: You don't need my help to screw
dialog: up here, Sidney. I mean, the only
dialog: things you make are mistakes and
text: stains.
text: The BARMAN arrives, stares at the bowl of fish
text: disapprovingly.
speaker_heading: BARMAN
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (following his gaze)
dialog: Just a couple of straws please.
text: Stony-faced, the Barman walks off. Despite herself, Alison
text: smiles. Sidney smiles back. He notices Alison's NOTEBOOK on
dialog: the bar.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I ask you something? How come
dialog: you've always got the notebook?
dialog: Is it a diary or something? Am I
dialog: in it?
dialog: 61.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: It's...it's a novel I'm working
dialog: on, alright?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Go ahead. I know. I'm a walking
dialog: cliché.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: No - a novel, that's...that's
dialog: pretty impressive. You're writing
dialog: it by hand?
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Yeah, it...I don't know. It keeps
dialog: it separate from the magazine
dialog: work. Makes it seem special.
text: He stares at her.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: You're full of surprises, Sister.
text: Suddenly he notices the White Russian beside them.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: So...you waiting for your
dialog: boyfriend?
speaker_heading: ALISON
speaker_heading: (UNCOMFORTABLE)
dialog: Uh, yeah, so...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: What's he do, the mystery guy? Is
dialog: he a hack too?
speaker_heading: ALISON
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Actually he's a poet.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Really? What's he look like?
speaker_heading: ALISON
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Just most poets you see aren't
dialog: really good-looking, are they?
dialog: Spend their time stuck in a room,
dialog: end up looking like Golem. Is
dialog: he...?
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: He's very handsome, thank you.
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (GLOOMILY)
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: You know what I don't understand?
dialog: You're desperate to get a story
dialog: in the magazine - so why wouldn't
dialog: you play ball with Eleanor, write
dialog: the puff-piece?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I resent being bribed to gush
text: sycophantically about a star,
dialog: okay? I choose to gush
text: sycophantically.
text: Alison stares at Sidney trying to figure him out.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: It's okay anyway. Clayton's given
dialog: me a story. I'm on my way.
speaker_heading: ALISON
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: Well, that's good.
text: Sidney smiles back at her. They look at each other...it's

text: Sidney looks back to Alison but she has turned away,

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (EMBARRASSED)
dialog: Okay, well...better get
dialog: going.(Leaving) You take my
dialog: advice, you'll get yourself a

scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
dialog: Yeah. Rachel Petkoff, fabulous
dialog: sixties actress, one of my all
dialog: time favourites. Just made a
dialog: wonderful movie called Five
dialog: Boroughs. I think she's poised
dialog: for a come-back and I think we
dialog: should get there first, do a
dialog: profile.
text: Sidney stares at him in disbelief. He looks over to Alison
text: who avoids his gaze.
scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING
dialog: Sounds good. Let's do it. Okay
dialog: that's it people.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Uh...Clayton?
scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Did you read my story on Vincent
dialog: Lepak?
text: Clayton frowns down at some papers, feigning distraction.
scene_heading: CLAYTON HARDING
dialog: What? Oh, yeah. That's...that's
dialog: not going to work.
text: Sidney can't believe it. Clayton gets up to leave.
speaker_heading: CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, and for those who haven't
dialog: heard, Alison is going to be
dialog: running the I Spy section from
dialog: now on as Lawrence here has just
dialog: gone up in the world. He is

speaker_heading: SIDNEY

speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)
dialog: By the way, there've been
dialog: complaints about you skulking

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (LIVID)
dialog: What? You spend half your life

speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
dialog: When I do it it's called

speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX
dialog: I know that wasn't Greg's way of

speaker_heading: LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Uh, Lawrence? This lady's been

speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: (HORRIFIED)

scene_heading: REVERSE - GIRLS' P.O.V

dialog: Clayton's not going to print

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Can I please...?
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: (holding it out of
scene_heading: SIDNEY'S REACH)

scene_heading: 85 EXT. HOUSE - LATER 85

speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)

dialog: write the novel. C- Win a
dialog: Pulitzer. E...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: D.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: D - I don't know what D was. Then
dialog: I took the internship at Sharps
dialog: and I met Maddox and he was...he
dialog: was so...and before I know it I'm
dialog: writing, you know, Ten Tips for
dialog: the fucking Metrosexual and
dialog: pretending this is what I wanted
dialog: but this ISN'T what I wanted! And
dialog: that's...that's why I hated
dialog: you...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I didn't know you hated me.
speaker_heading: ALISON
speaker_heading: (OBLIVIOUS)
dialog: ...because you were right about
dialog: me. I'm a ghoul, writing fluff!
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: You're not a Ghoul. You're a
dialog: Zombie.
text: Alison leans her head against the window.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: But he isn't the person you think
dialog: he is, okay? Maddox. That's just
text: a front. He thinks he's let
dialog: himself down by giving up the
dialog: poetry and he's unhappy. And the
dialog: marriage is a sham, I mean... I
dialog: just...I couldn't end it. I just
dialog: couldn't and...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (can't take anymore)
dialog: Look, I don't need to hear this.
speaker_heading: ALISON

speaker_heading: ALISON (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: You don't smoke.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Oh yeah.
text: She looks at her reflection in the window.
speaker_heading: ALISON (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you think I have low self-
dialog: esteem? Am I afraid of a real
dialog: relationship? Do I think an
dialog: affair is all I deserve? I mean,
dialog: okay, he's handsome and
dialog: successful and he's great in
dialog: bed...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (IRRITATED)
dialog: Could you just be quiet?
text: He realises she has started to cry.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: When I told him I couldn't see
dialog: him any more...I don't know if he
dialog: cared. I love him and, and I
dialog: don't know if he cares!
text: Sidney watches, moved.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (RELUCTANTLY)
dialog: Well, I'm...I'm sure he does.
dialog: He's probably just not very good

speaker_heading: ALISON
speaker_heading: (SOBBING)
dialog: I'm so fucking sophisticated! I
dialog: mean there's not even a little
dialog: bit of Port Huron left, right?
dialog: I've got the haircut and the job
dialog: and I've got the parties and I've
dialog: even, I've even got the affair

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALISON

scene_heading: RICHARD YOUNG
speaker_heading: (MILDLY)

text: Alison dances back into the room.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Sooo, Sidney's dad. Good to meet

speaker_heading: MRS KOWALSKI
speaker_heading: (SHOCKED)

scene_heading: RICHARD YOUNG
speaker_heading: (KINDLY)
dialog: No thank you.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Okay. Where are my cigarettes?
dialog: (feeling in the pocket of the

text: She produces the wrap of coke that the elderly man had
dialog: given Sidney.
speaker_heading: ALISON (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, hey, is that....?
text: She stops herself. Everyone stares at the wrap.
scene_heading: RICHARD YOUNG
dialog: I think it is probably cocaine.
text: Sidney closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: It wasn't actually for me. I was
dialog: going to give it to this young

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALISON
speaker_heading: (OBLIVIOUS)

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (DYING)
dialog: I think you should lie down
dialog: Alison.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: He's doing just great at the
dialog: magazine.
text: Alison ruffles Sidney's hair clumsily.
speaker_heading: ALISON (CONT'D)
dialog: First we all thought he was kinda
dialog: creepy because he was always
text: hanging around the water-cooler,
dialog: hitting on women...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Really Alison, I think...
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: But I think that was pretty much
dialog: an act. So, Mister Sidney,
dialog: whatcha doing here?
scene_heading: RICHARD YOUNG
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: Please, call me Richard. I've
dialog: written a little book so I'm
dialog: doing a few talks.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: A book! Hey - I'm writing a book.
dialog: What's yours about? Don't tell me
dialog: - it's a thriller, right?
scene_heading: RICHARD YOUNG
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: No, nothing so interesting I'm
dialog: afraid. I'm a philosopher.
speaker_heading: ALISON
speaker_heading: (SURPRISED)
dialog: Philosophy? Really? Have you
dialog: written any...
text: Alison stops dancing, stares at him, something occurring to
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: ALISON (CONT'D)

dialog: You...you didn't say...

scene_heading: RICHARD YOUNG
speaker_heading: (TO SIDNEY)
dialog: I'd love to hear what you think

dialog: read it.
text: Alison snorts with laughter.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: What would Sidney know about
dialog: philosophy?
scene_heading: RICHARD YOUNG
dialog: Well, he does have a Masters in
dialog: the subject.
text: Alison stares at Sidney. She breaks into a snorting laugh
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: You're shitting me! Sidney?
dialog: He...he likes Con Air!
text: She stops laughing, hit by a sudden wave of nausea.
speaker_heading: ALISON (CONT'D)
dialog: I...I don't feel very well.
text: Mrs Kowalski stands up.
speaker_heading: MRS KOWALSKI
dialog: Come on. It is time you went to

speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Okay. Better go before I find out

dialog: Sidney.

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: You should have said you were

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: RICHARD YOUNG
speaker_heading: (WRYLY)
dialog: That would have required you
dialog: answering one of my calls.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I've been pretty busy.
scene_heading: RICHARD YOUNG
dialog: Which reminds me, I was talking
dialog: to a publisher friend of mine the
dialog: other day. He mentioned that they
dialog: were planning a series of
dialog: introductory texts on
dialog: philosophers. I wondered if you
dialog: would be interested?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (ANNOYED)
dialog: I have a job, dad.
scene_heading: RICHARD YOUNG
dialog: Of course, of course. I picked up
dialog: a copy of your magazine at the
dialog: airport.
text: Sidney stiffens a little.
speaker_heading: RICHARD YOUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: Most enjoyable. (Beat) I
dialog: particularly liked the young
dialog: Hollywood actress who said she'd
dialog: like to start her theatre career
dialog: "somewhere small, like London or
dialog: England."
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (IRRITATED)
dialog: Why've you always got to do this?
dialog: It's...it's...
scene_heading: RICHARD YOUNG
dialog: It was just a joke Sidney...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Actually it's not. Because you're
dialog: saying that what I do for a
dialog: living is worthless and...
scene_heading: RICHARD YOUNG
dialog: I don't think it's worthless. I
dialog: just think, in your heart, you
dialog: know you could do more with your
dialog: life than...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (ANGRY)
dialog: More? Sharps is one of the most
dialog: respected magazines in the world.
dialog: There's a million hacks who would
dialog: kill to be where I am now.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know who I interviewed
dialog: recently? Nathan Lane.
scene_heading: RICHARD YOUNG
dialog: I don't know who...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I KNOW you don't know who that
dialog: is! You don't know who anyone is!
dialog: You thought Brad Pitt was a cave
dialog: in Yorkshire! But most people do
dialog: know who they are, okay? And most
dialog: people wouldn't think that a
dialog: journalist who gets to mix with
dialog: stars like that was a, a
dialog: disappointment!
scene_heading: RICHARD YOUNG
speaker_heading: (PAINED)
dialog: I don't think you're a
dialog: disappointment Sidney. I've never
dialog: thought that.
text: Silence. Richard stands and picks up his coat.
speaker_heading: RICHARD YOUNG (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (SADLY)
dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)

text: The young lady next door...
dialog: Alison? She wouldn't have

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: What? No. We're just friends.
scene_heading: RICHARD YOUNG
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: I saw the way you looked at her.
text: Sidney considers this, knowing it's true.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: She doesn't feel that way about
dialog: me. New York women don't date

scene_heading: RICHARD YOUNG
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: I suppose not. But Alison is from
dialog: Port Huron, isn't she?
text: Sidney stares at him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 99 BEDROOM - LATER 99
text: Sidney peers into the room to check Alison is okay. She

dialog: together and get going...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Why? No, you're all right.
dialog: It's...it's nice to have the

speaker_heading: ALISON
speaker_heading: (REMEMBERING)
dialog: Oh God...your father. And that
dialog: woman.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Mrs Kowalski? Don't worry about
dialog: it. The last woman she caught me
dialog: with had a penis, so you
dialog: know...you're a big step up.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 89.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She notices a black and white photograph of a glamorous

text: at the beginning of the film.
speaker_heading: ALISON (CONT'D)
dialog: Who's that?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: That's my mother.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: No way!
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Yeah, I don't take after her...
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Was she a model?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Actress.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Wow. Movies?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Some. British, small parts...
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Is she...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: No, she died when I was young.
text: Without thinking he fiddles with the ring on his finger.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Must have been pretty cool having
dialog: your mom in the movies.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Yeah, I suppose. I used to see
text: her on the TV every now and then
dialog: when I was growing up. Sort of
dialog: weird.
text: He carries the plates over to her.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Here we go! English fry-up.
dialog: Perfect hangover cure.
text: Sidney puts a plate of bacon, eggs and sausages in front of

text: from the room.
dialog: 90.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 101 LIVING ROOM - LATER 101
text: Sidney is tidying. He upsets Alison's bag from the couch
text: and its contents spill onto the floor - the NOTEBOOK is
dialog: amongst them.
text: Sidney stares at it, hesitates and then, unable to resist,
text: opens it up and starts to read. Alison walks into the room.
text: Sidney looks up guiltily.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Sorry, I was just...uh...(He
dialog: can't think of an excuse)
dialog: ...rooting through your private
dialog: possessions...
text: Alison sits on the couch, feeling too ill to be annoyed.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I like the opening.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: You do?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I do. Can I read the rest of it?
dialog: Believe it or not, I'm a pretty
dialog: good editor.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: I don't know. I don't even know
dialog: if I'm going to bother finishing
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY

speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Is that from Troy again?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Schiller.
text: She puts her things back in her bag.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: I'll jump in the shower and then
dialog: I really will get out of your
dialog: hair.
text: Sidney watches, not wanting her to go.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Oh, I forgot...I got you a
dialog: present.
dialog: 91.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He hands her a bag. Surprised she opens it and takes out a
text: RECORD. It's the Nino Rota sound-track to La Dolce Vita.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I was just walking past this
dialog: music shop on the corner and I
dialog: saw it. I thought it might cheer
dialog: you up.
text: Alison is deeply touched.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: That's...I don't know what to
dialog: say. (Beat) I haven't got a
text: turntable.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Oh. (Beat) Well, you can always
dialog: come here to listen to it.
text: Sidney takes the record and puts it on the turntable in the
text: corner of the room. He selects the finale music - it's
text: funny and sad, glamorous and romantic... They listen to it
text: for a moment. Sidney starts to dance a little. He cha-cha's
text: over to her and holds out his hand.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Are you kidding? I could throw up
dialog: on you again.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: C'mon...
text: Alison reluctantly gets up. They dance ironically. Alison
text: laughs a little.
text: Gradually they get more into it, enjoying the music - a man
text: in shorts and a woman in pyjamas, cha-cha-chaing, a summer
text: breeze wafting in the through the open windows behind
dialog: him...

speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Oh don't be crazy! Alice? Is Anna
dialog: fat?
speaker_heading: ALISON
speaker_heading: (BRIGHT)
dialog: Not at all. Why, she's so thin I

speaker_heading: ANNA
speaker_heading: (AUTOMATICALLY)
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: ALISON

speaker_heading: ELEANOR JOHNSON
