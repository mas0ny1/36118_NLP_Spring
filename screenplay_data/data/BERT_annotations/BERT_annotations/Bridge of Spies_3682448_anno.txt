scene_heading: TITLE OVER BLACK: 1957.
dialog: The height of the Cold War. The United States and the Soviet
dialog: Union fear each other’s nuclear capabilities - and

scene_heading: INSPIRED BY TRUE EVENTS
scene_heading: CLOSE ON AN ELDERLY MAN
text: Reflected in a grimy mirror. The mirror is propped up on a
text: chair next to an open window looking out from the fourth
text: floor onto a Brooklyn skyline.
text: Pull back to show the man sitting in a shabby
text: workshop/studio. He looks from the mirror down at a canvas
text: in front of him as he daubs paint onto a self-portrait.
text: The telephone rings.
text: The old man rests his brush on the easel and walks to a table
text: cluttered with papers and shortwave radios. He picks up the
text: phone and listens but doesn’t say anything.
speaker_heading: FULTON STREET
text: The old man, Rudolf Abel, emerges from the building, walks
text: along the street.
scene_heading: TITLE: BROOKLYN
text: An Agent follows Abel.
scene_heading: SUBWAY TRAIN INTERIOR
text: The Agent watches Abel as the train stops at Broad Street.
text: The Agent, now joined by a second Agent, follows him at a
text: distance. Abel dabs at his nose with a handkerchief. The
text: agents lose him in the crush of commuters. They emerge from
text: the station and consult two other Agents. No sign of Abel.
text: First Agent heads back down the stair, smashing BANG right
text: into Abel, who’s coming up the stairs.
text: Abel looks up, surprised. Then mildly:
speaker_heading: ABEL
dialog: Excuse me.
text: The agent equally surprised watches as Abel makes his way
text: around him.

text: overlooking the East River, painting.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: (to Driver)
dialog: Go ahead and park around the corner.
scene_heading: AT THE RIVERSIDE
text: Abel sets down his palette.
text: Close on his hand, adjusting his easel, then feeling under
text: the bench. His hand closes on something held by a magnet to
text: the bench’s steel frame below the wood seat-slats: it is a
dialog: nickel.
text: Back to Abel sitting. Picks up his palette...
speaker_heading: MANHATTAN STREET
text: A seedy part of town. Abel walks toward a building, the
scene_heading: HOTEL LATHAM.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE ROOM
text: As Abel lets himself in. A very modest room. He sets down
text: his portable easel and case. Sets his work-in-progress
text: canvass on a standing easel, drapes his jacket over a chair,
text: hangs his hat on the easel. He turns on a table fan.
text: He fishes the nickel from his pocket, retrieves a razor from
text: the bathroom and uses it to carefully to open it. It is
dialog: hollow.
text: Inside is a piece of paper, folded accordion-style into a
text: small square.
text: Abel unfolds it. Holds it up to a magnifier lamp. Written
text: on the paper, a sequence of numerals.
scene_heading: STREET OUTSIDE HOTEL
text: Two government cars skid to a stop and the Agents pour out.
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
text: The Agents run down the corridor.
scene_heading: 12.17.14 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 3.
speaker_heading: ABEL’S ROOM
text: Its door is being busted in.
text: The Agents swarm in. They have guns. They come up short.
text: The small room is empty. The easel with a work in progress
text: upon it stands before the window, which stands open, gentle
text: wind playing at the sheers.
text: Outside, a fire escape. The man seems to have left.
text: An Agent inspects a closed door. The bathroom -- Rudolf
text: Abel steps out, in his briefs. Standing in the doorway,
text: cigarette in mouth, we see him as a frail, vulnerable old
dialog: man.
text: He freezes, not scared, just surprised. He looks at the men.
text: They look at him.
text: At last he speaks, with colorless, quasi-British accent.
speaker_heading: ABEL
dialog: Visitors.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: ABEL (CONT'D)
dialog: ..-Would you mind if I fetch my
dialog: teeth?
text: Two of the agents, Blasco and Gamber, look at each other,
text: confused. Abel gestures back towards the bathroom.
speaker_heading: BLASCO
dialog: Colonel, would you turn around
dialog: please.
text: Blasco turns Abel around, checks to make sure he’s not armed.
speaker_heading: BLASCO (CONT'D)
text: Sit down. On the bed.
text: Blasco and Gamber walk him to the bed. He sits.
speaker_heading: ABEL
dialog: (gesturing toward
dialog: bathroom)
text: The teeth are on the sink...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: 12.17.14 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 4.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GAMBER
dialog: Look at me! We are agents from the
dialog: federal government.
text: Abel scans the Agents who surround him.
speaker_heading: GAMBER (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at me! I’m talking to you. We
dialog: have received information concerning
dialog: your involvement in espionage. You
dialog: can either cooperate with us right
dialog: now or you’ll be under arrest. Do
dialog: you understand, Colonel?
text: Blasco heads into the bathroom.
speaker_heading: ABEL
dialog: Not really. Why do you keep calling
dialog: me “Colonel”?
text: Blasco returns and with care hands him his teeth. Abel puts
dialog: them in.
speaker_heading: BLASCO
dialog: You need to get dressed.
speaker_heading: GAMBER
dialog: We have to search your apartment.
text: Abel points at the art materials on the table.
speaker_heading: ABEL
dialog: Would you mind if I cleaned my
dialog: palette? The paints will get ruined
dialog: otherwise. Just behind you there.
dialog: I have a cloth, myself...
text: Abel stands. Blasco hands him his palette.
speaker_heading: ABEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: BLASCO
dialog: (to the other men)
dialog: Start searching, please.
speaker_heading: ABEL
dialog: Would you put this out in the

scene_heading: 12.17.14 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 5.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: While an Agent does this and the other Agents begin the
text: search, Abel, holding the palette, grabs a small scrap of
text: paper -- the one from the nickel bearing a series of
dialog: numerals.
text: As the agents explore the room, Abel uses the paper to wipe
text: the palette clean.
speaker_heading: ABEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t want this to get spoiled.
text: The wet paint obliterates the code. As the agents continue
dialog: to toss the room...

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO
scene_heading: INT. THE HARVARD CLUB
text: Two middle-aged men sit in club chairs facing each other.

speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Don't say “my guy.” He’s not “my
dialog: guy.”
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: Yes he’s your guy. Who’re we
dialog: talking about?
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: We're talking about a guy who is
dialog: insured by my client. So don’t make
dialog: him “my guy.”
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: Okay, fine, my point is he -- the
dialog: guy insured by your client -- he
dialog: doesn’t deny any of these things
dialog: happened --
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: “These things?”
speaker_heading: BATES

speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Well -- I’m sorry -- it’s not clear
dialog: to me. Five things? Explain it to
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: BATES
text: It’s self-evident.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Okay, then tell me what happened,
dialog: tell me the story in a way that
dialog: makes sense. For five things.
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: Fine. Absolutely. Your guy --
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Not my guy. Insured by my client.
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: The guy insured by your client -- is
dialog: driving down State Highway 19 when
text: he loses control of his car, hits my
dialog: five guys. The five guys who hired
dialog: me to represent them because you’re
dialog: not honoring your claim.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: You mean my client is not honoring
dialog: the claim. The insurance company.
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: Mr. Donovan: we’re all clear on
dialog: who’s who here.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Except, my client honors every
dialog: claim. They do, Mr. Bates, every
dialog: single legitimate claim. Up to the
dialog: limit of their liability, which is
dialog: $100,000 per accident in the case of
dialog: this man’s policy. And this is one
dialog: claim, according to your
dialog: description. “He hit my five guys.”
dialog: The guy insured by my client had one
dialog: accident, one one one, losing
text: control of the car and hitting five
dialog: motorcyclists.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: 12.17.14 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 7.

speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: From their point of view, five
dialog: things happened.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Look Bob -- may I? Bob?
dialog: (gestures to self)
dialog: Jim. If I go bowling and I throw a
dialog: strike, one thing happened. Ten
dialog: things didn’t happen.
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: Jim. My clients are not bowling
dialog: pins. As much your guy might have
dialog: treated them so --
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Lemme finish. If your house is
dialog: insured to $100,000 and a tornado
text: carries it away, it carried away one
dialog: house. It didn’t pick up every
dialog: stick of furniture and destroy it in
dialog: a separate incident. If that’s what
dialog: you're saying, well, then there is
dialog: never any limit to our liability and
dialog: that is the end of the insurance
dialog: business. And then, Bob, nobody is
dialog: safe.
scene_heading: RECEPTION: WATTERS, COWAN AND DONOVAN

speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Great, good, thanks. How’s Annie?

text: Slap! -- he drops a thick document onto the coffee table.
dialog: Silence.
text: Donovan looks at it but doesn’t reach for it. He is
text: absorbing the news.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Well.
dialog: More silence.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN (CONT'D)
dialog: ...I’m not sure I should pick that
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: WATTERS
dialog: The accused doesn’t know any
dialog: lawyers. The Federal Court tossed
dialog: it into our lap. The Bar Committee
dialog: took a vote. You were the unanimous
dialog: choice.
speaker_heading: GOODNOUGH
dialog: It was important to us -- it’s
dialog: important to our country, Jim --
dialog: that this man is seen as getting a
dialog: fair shake. American justice will
dialog: be on trial.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Well, of course, when you put it
dialog: that way, it’s an honor to be asked.
dialog: But -- Lynn -- I’m an insurance
dialog: lawyer, I haven't done criminal work

dialog: situation. The man is publicly
text: reviled.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: And I will be too.
speaker_heading: GOODNOUGH
dialog: Yes, in more ignorant quarters. But
dialog: that’s exactly why this has to be
dialog: done -- and capably done. It can’t
dialog: look like our justice system tosses
text: people on the ash heap.
dialog: Thinking beat.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Suppose I did...what’s the evidence
dialog: look like?
speaker_heading: GOODNOUGH
dialog: Pretty overwhelming.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Great. Great. Everyone will hate me,

dialog: Watters) What do you think, Tom?
dialog: The firm’1l suffer, I have work
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: WATTERS
dialog: I think it’s a patriotic duty, this
dialog: is an important mission. I told
dialog: Lynn the firm can’t say no, and

speaker_heading: ROGER

speaker_heading: DONOVAN

speaker_heading: DULLES (CONT'D)

dialog: Donovan's
speaker_heading: SCHISCHKIN
dialog: If we release Powers it is only to

dialog: months later we would release
dialog: Powers, there’s an idea.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: No, that won’t work for us at all,
dialog: you see we need this to be an
dialog: exchange. You can call it what you
dialog: want, but an exchange it must be. We
dialog: can have Abel within forty-eight

speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: But you’re saying, if Powers has
dialog: given up everything he knows, then
dialog: Moscow would trade? Why wouldn’t
dialog: they? As for Abel, if he dies in an

dialog: operative who gets caught might
dialog: think twice about keeping his mouth
dialog: shut...(and now he tries something
dialog: new) and, you never know, Abel might
dialog: want to see the sky again and start

speaker_heading: SCHISCHKIN
dialog: How can we know this. We little

speaker_heading: DONOVAN
