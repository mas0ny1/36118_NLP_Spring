speaker_heading: FOREWORD
dialog: Dear patrons of the Silent Drama ...
dialog: In this present era of discovery and invention
text: Spiritualism and other psychic phenomena are scoffed
dialog: at by the masses in general. Therefore, we ask you
dialog: to bear with us while we unfold for your entertain-
dialog: ment, the story of the "Opera Ghost" which really
dialog: did exist according to the memoirs of the late M.
dialog: Faure, Chief of the Paris Secret Police, whose
dialog: weird tale of a criminal investigation which lead
text: him to an opaque veil that cloaked the supernatural
dialog: now lies in the archives of the National Academy
dialog: of Music in the French Capitol.

text: CLOSE SHOT on a volume which rests on a rich
text: velvet table scarf-- on the book is the title in
scene_heading: French --MEMOIRES OF M. FAURE, CHIEF OF THE PARIS
text: SECRET POLICE. As the French letters dissolve into
dialog: English and we play long enough to identify, a
text: hand enters scene and opens volume to the preface.
scene_heading: 2. CLOSE VIEW of the first page of the Preface which
dialog: reads:
dialog: To whom it may concern:-
dialog: Before unfolding my hair-raising experience in
dialog: making an investigation of the murderous crimes at-
dialog: tributed to the "Opera Ghost" it will be necessary
dialog: for me to relate a few interesting facts concerning
dialog: the Paris Opera house, where the Ghost existed.
dialog: The Paris Opera house was conceived by Louis
dialog: Napoleon III, after an unsuccessful attempt to
text: duplicate the world power of his illustrious uncle,
dialog: the great Napoleon, as a sop to his suffering and
dialog: war-ridden subjects.
text: (a hand turns the page over revealing a picture of
dialog: Louis Napoleon III, as the military emperor)
dialog: It was designed and executed by that
dialog: celebrated architect, Jean Louis Charles Garnier, who
dialog: later built the Forum of Trajan and the Temple of
dialog: Vesta in Rome--and the Casino at Monte Carlo.
text: (A hand turns the page over revealing a picture of
dialog: Jean Louis Charles Garnier)
dialog: No European capital possesses an opera house
dialog: so comprehensive in plan and execution, nor can
text: boast an edifice so vast and splendid.
text: (A hand turns the page over revealing a picture of
dialog: the Paris Opera house to show its magnitude and
dialog: decorative design.)
dialog: Its construction began in 1851, and was es-
dialog: timated to cost thirty-five million francs, and it
dialog: required twelve years for completion. It contains
dialog: 583 dressing rooms, 2551 doors and 7893 keys; 14
dialog: furnaces and 450 grates; 16 miles of gas pipe, 9
text: reservoirs and two tanks holding 22,222 gallons of
dialog: water.
text: (A hand turns the page over and we read further)
dialog: During the revolution of 1870, the con-
dialog: struction was halted for a time, when Napoleon III
dialog: lost his throne and the present Republic of France
dialog: was declared.
dialog: It was during those dark days of bloodshed
dialog: that the building was used as a military head-
text: quarters. Its vast cellars turned into dungeons
dialog: for prisoners, and secret passages and torture
text: chambers installed to satisfy the blood lust of a
text: crazed populace.
text: (A hand turns the page over revealing the first
dialog: page of M. Faure's memoirs.)
dialog: Many were the skeptics who scoffed at the
dialog: idea of the "Opera Ghost" but the few upon whose
dialog: word I could rely believed in its existence;
dialog: vowing that the opera house bore a curse, dating
dialog: back to the time when the Second Commune carried on
text: a wholesale massacre of the Nobility in the dark

scene_heading: EXT. PARIS OPERA HOUSE.
text: It is night and under the gas lights we see the

scene_heading: INT GRAND STAIRCASE #1. . . AMBER
text: This is a cross shot of the staircase, something of
text: the view shows in the first illustration in the book.
text: The scene presents a gorgeous picture. Circulating
text: on the stairway are the elite, the wealthy, the aris-
dialog: tocratic, the military, the fashionable of Paris.
dialog: The carriage and general manner of the people is very
text: light and informal. Some wear opera hats tilted at
text: an angle, and others not. The men, women, officers
text: and attendants of the opera are dressed for the
dialog: period of approximately 1890. The women are
text: beautifully gowned as the Paris Grand Opera is the
dialog: show place of the fashionable world. The number of
dialog: people will be governed by what is required to
dialog: 10.
dialog: comfortably fill the big set. Crowds will also be
text: seen moving in the four galleries, while others will
text: circulate upon the staircases which lead downward at

text: gaiety and laughter.

text: and the entrance below the Portierre. The
text: aisles are crowded, not only with those seeking
text: their seats, but also with groups. All are laughing
text: and talking. The atmosphere is free and informal.
text: Many are standing or lounging against the seats,
text: gossiping with acquaintances a few seats distant.
text: The chandelier is a blaze of light. The musicians
dialog: (71 including the director) are filling in and

scene_heading: SIMON'S BROTHER, JOSEPH.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP OF JOSEPH
text: This is a character study of an opposite type to

text: and straightens up, wincing at his cramped back
text: and making agonized faces.
scene_heading: SEMI C.V. JOSEPH BUQUET.
text: As Simon enters scene and affectionately rubs his

text: FOR YOUR ACHING BACK, TAKE A SNEAK."

scene_heading: INTIMATE SHOT OF FLORINE AND SOME BALLET GIRLS. AMBER.
dialog: Florine, through his long association with the Opera
dialog: has never lost his appreciation of beautiful limbs.
text: He cannot keep his mind on his business. The girls,
text: of course, all know Florine. The girls tickle and

scene_heading: INT. FIRST CELLAR. . FAINT GREEN.
text: Florine enters from beyond the arched doorway in
text: the rear. He starts up the step toward the
text: dressing room corridor. The six ballet girls,
text: holding each other by the arms and huddled together,
text: enter to the landing in the stairs. They pretend
text: great fright. They cluster around Florine and
text: bowl him down the stairs again. They are not going
dialog: to be left alone.
scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT. . FAINT GREEN
text: The ballet girls run in to the landing upon the
text: stairs. They call to Florine and he meets them at
text: the foot of the stairs.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP AT FOOT OF STAIRS. . FAINT GREEN
text: The girls want him to lead them to Joseph Buquet.
text: He is proud of their confidence and he beams.
text: The girls surround him and each takes hold of his
text: arm or his belt and the group moves through the
text: arch and exits to the right.
scene_heading: INT. CELLAR SHOT. .#4. . FAINT GREEN
text: This is the set in which there is a headless statue.
text: In this scene, however, the light is not on the
text: headless statue and it can hardly be seen. Joseph
text: Buguet is at work under a shaded gas jet, sewing up
text: the cheek of John the Baptist. Florine and the ballet
text: girls enter. The girls huddle around Buquet as
dialog: if they found protection in his presence. They begin
text: to question the glassy eyed man, he looks around
text: apprehensively as if all the shadows might be
text: inhabited. As Buquet talks he switches the head
text: around, sometimes holding it by the hair. This
text: head has practical eyes that open and close. Buquet
dialog: tells them:
dialog: "HIS EYES ARE SO DEEP THAT YOU
text: CAN HARDLY SEE THE PUPILS.
text: JUST TWO BLACK HOLES IN A DEAD
scene_heading: MAN'S SKULL."
speaker_heading: BACK:
text: The girls show horror and fascination. A pained
text: expression comes over Florine's face. Buquet con-
dialog: tinues:
text: "HIS SKIN IS A NASTY YELLOW AND
text: STRETCHED ACROSS HIS BONES LIKE
scene_heading: A DRUMHEAD. HIS NOSE. . THERE
dialog: IS NO NOSE!"
speaker_heading: BACK:
text: The girls are held spell bound. Florine shivers
text: and tells Buguet with apprehensiveness:
text: "YOU KNOW THE GHOST DOESN'T
text: LIKE BEING TALKED ABOUT."
speaker_heading: BACK:
text: Buguet looks into Florine's face with his big
text: hollow eyes as if he had not heard him. Then he
dialog: tells the girls:
dialog: "I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE I SAW HIM
text: BETWEEN THE SCENE OF A FARM HOUSE
text: AND THE "KING OF LAHORE" SET."
speaker_heading: BACK:
text: This is too much for Florine. He decides not to go
text: with them and begins to walk away, but the girls
dialog: grab him. They are not going to be left alone
text: with Buquet after what he has said. Buquet leads
text: them down a flight of stairs; after he has care-
text: fully laid the head aside. Florine keeps his eye
text: on the head until he is out.
scene_heading: CELLAR SET #5. . FAINT GREEN
text: This is the "King of Lahore" set. On the left is
text: a suggestion of a farm house scene, the elaborate
text: piece of "King of Lahore" scenery, then a circular
text: staircase, and on the right, a scene rack which is
text: moved by a hand switch. In front of the "King of
text: Lahore" scenery is a concealed trap in the floor
text: and back of the set is a dark opening.
text: Joseph Buquet leads the girls and Florine down the
text: circular staircase to a position before the "Lahore"
dialog: set.
scene_heading: INT. CLOSE UP OF GROUP. .FAINT GREEN.
text: Buguet points his skinny finger at the dark
text: column of the "Lahore" set and begins to explain
text: that it was in that shadow that he saw the Ghost.
text: The girls are looking into the shadow, fascinated,
text: as if the Ghost might appear there again. But
text: Florine is looking at the dark opening in the wall
text: behind the set. His eyes are fixed upon something
text: and he stands stiff and paralyzed.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP FLORINE. .FAINT GREEN
text: He stares with a fixed expression of frozen horror.
text: CLOSE UP THE DARK OPENING IN WALL. . FAINT GREEN
text: There is a motion in the dark opening - something
text: undefined, but plainly a motion of a dark shadow
text: shape - the gas light goes down and then up.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP FLORINE. . FAINT GREEN
text: Florine gives one terrific scream, as if his heart
dialog: would break with terror.
scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT. . FAINT GREEN
dialog: The girls almost die of fright, genuine fright this
text: time. There is a frightened clamor on the part of
text: the girls and Florine to be the first to reach the
text: circular staircase. Buquet stands quietly looking
text: at them with his hollow, glassy eyes. The girls
text: reach the stairs and run up the circular stairs
text: laughing at each other and screaming. Florine
text: tears up the staircase to the first landing when
text: his momentum carries him out of the opening and
text: upon the floor at his starting point. He tears
text: up the stairs again.
scene_heading: CELLAR #4. . FAINT GREEN.
text: This set is now seen in another lighting so that
text: the big headless statue with outstretched arms
text: stands in bold relief. The girls fleeing in
text: terror, followed by Florine, run up the stairs into
text: the picture and almost into the arms of the headless
text: statue. They break away from the statue and
text: run out the right. Florine takes a short cut,
text: running out the right, back of the pile of prop-
dialog: erties.
scene_heading: CELLAR #3. . FAINT GREEN
text: This is the Sigfried dragon's head. The girls
text: run in from the left, get their reaction of fright
text: from the dragon and run off to the right. Florine
text: runs in and stops to get his breath. He knows all
dialog: about the ordinary props down here and is not
text: afraid. Door in dragon's mouth opens and in-
text: definite shadowy figure is seen in back. He gives
text: one sickly look of terror and runs out to the right.
scene_heading: CELLAR #2. . FAINT GREEN.
text: This is the dummy set. The girls run in and shrink
text: from the dummies which are hanging in insane
text: postures, one up-side down, another with a broken
text: back. One of the girls gets tangled up in the
text: ropes which hold the dummies and they begin to
text: jerk up and down and their arms flap. The other
text: girl rescues the one in the ropes and they run out.
scene_heading: CELLAR BRIDGE SET. . FAINT GREEN
text: At the right of this set is a trap-door elevator.
text: Florine runs in, jumps on the elevator and pulls a
text: lever. This makes the elevator shoot upward.
scene_heading: EXT. ON BACK STAGE. .AMBER
text: This shot is back of the scene. Simon is peeping
text: through the scenery and talking to a stage hand.
text: A couple of feet from him a trap falls open and
text: Florine shoots up into the air about four feet,
text: lights on his feet, nonchalantly tries to appear
text: that he is doing his regular work, picks up a
text: prop and walks off. Simon looks after him with
text: suspicious exasperation.
scene_heading: INT. LA SORELLI'S DRESSING ROOM. . AMBER
dialog: This is a conventional dressing room, such as
dialog: would be furnished to a star, or to La Sorelli, who
text: is the head of the ballet. She is also the
text: friend of the younger dancers. The scene is one
dialog: of languor, a little of what people expect of Parisian
text: naughtiness. A beautifully formed, languorous
text: creature is reclining upon a couch and is being
text: entertained by two or three smartly dressed young
text: Parisians. La Sorelli is before the mirror with
text: an admirer and her maid. The admirer playfully
text: takes the place of the maid and is allowed to
text: fasten the top button in the back of her dress.
text: Their playful pastimes are interrupted by a violent
text: knocking at the door.
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM CORRIDOR. .AMBER.
text: This is a close up of the other side of La
text: Sorelli's door. Twelve little hands are pounding
text: upon it.
scene_heading: INT. LA SORELLI'S DRESSING ROOM . . AMBER
text: The maid opens the door and the six ballet girls
text: burst in. One of them closes and locks the door.
text: They all cluster around La Sorelli and cry out
dialog: together:
dialog: "WE SAW THE GHOST!
dialog: THE OPERA GHOST!"
speaker_heading: BACK:
dialog: La Sorelli is superstitious concerning the ghost
text: and she shudders. She of all in the room takes it
text: seriously. The dandies laugh at the idea, as if
dialog: it were some new trick the girls were playing.
text: The girls all continue talking at once to La Sorelli
text: who tries to conceal her growing fright by laughing.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP FIRST BALLET GIRL. . AMBER
text: With wide eyes, but pretending, she exclaims:
text: "HE APPEARED BEFORE US. . OUT
text: OF NOTHING. . A SKELETON IN
text: A DRESS SUIT AND THEN HE WAS
dialog: GONE!"
scene_heading: CLOSE UP SECOND BALLET GIRL. . AMBER
text: With assumed terror, she whispers, touching her
dialog: nose:
dialog: "HE HAD NO NOSE. . NO EYES. .
text: JUST TWO BLACK HOLES IN A
dialog: DEAD MAN'S SKULL."
scene_heading: MED. SHOT IN LA SORELLI'S DRESSING ROOM . . AMBER.
text: La Sorelli is still trying to conceal her terror,
text: but cannot repress shivering - the dandies are
text: laughing - the girls terrified. Suddenly La Sorelli
text: starts and listens - all see her attitude and
dialog: listen:
scene_heading: MED. SHOT IN DRESSING ROOM CORRIDOR.
text: A strange shadow moves along the wall.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT IN DRESSING ROOM . . AMBER.
text: FLASH of everyone listening tensely.
scene_heading: C.V. LATCH INSIDE DRESSING ROOM DOOR
text: It is lifted and dropped three times.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT IN DRESSING ROOM . .AMBER.
text: Everyone staring in horror toward door - the ballet
text: girls cling to La Sorelli in terror.
scene_heading: SEMI C.V. LA SORELLI
text: The girls cling to her in terror - then with a
text: courage born of fear, she produces a dagger and
text: throwing off the detaining hands, moves toward the
text: door -- the girls gasp as they watch after her.
scene_heading: SEMI C.V. INSIDE DRESSING ROOM DOOR.
text: As La Sorelli enters scene and moves close to
text: door with dagger ready but trembling body. She
dialog: screams:
dialog: "WHO'S THERE!"
speaker_heading: BACK:
text: She listens a few seconds, then turning the lock
text: jerks open the door.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT IN CORRIDOR OUTSIDE LA SORELLI'S DRESSING
speaker_heading: ROOM.
text: As La Sorelli opens door and looks out - the
text: corridor is empty. She appears startled - then re-
text: covering her poise, she steps back in and closes
text: the door.
text: MED. SHOT IN DRESSING ROOM.
text: As La Sorelli returns to the frightened ballet
dialog: girls - and dandies who seeing there is no danger,
text: again smile and laugh to show how brave they are -
text: La Sorelli tosses the dagger on her dresser top
text: and shrugging her shoulders indicates there is
dialog: nothing to worry about.
text: SHOOTING FROM THE STAGE. .AMBER.
text: This shot shows the vast audience from this angle,
text: settled in their seats for the performance, but in
text: the f.g. is the prompter's box. The prompter is
text: arranging his papers. He is a dapper, grouchy little
text: fellow. He bends down until he is almost out of
text: sight, the opening from the stage to the prompter's
text: box must be large enough to admit a person through it.
text: LONG SHOT FROM REAR OF AUDITORIUM TOWARD STAGE.
text: The curtain rises on the home of Faust the aged
text: German alchemist. We see the aged alchemist
text: working with his chemicals striving to find the
dialog: Elixir of Life.
text: BACK STAGE.
text: Florine is peeping through one of the stage en-
text: trances at the first scene of Faust. When a good
text: looking ballet girl passes him - he cranes his
text: neck to admire her -- then decides to follow her.
text: SHOOTING DOWN ON STAGE FROM ABOVE.
text: Florine following the ballet girl -- there is an open
text: trap in the floor which she steps over - he steps
text: into it and falls through.
scene_heading: CELLAR UNDER STAGE.
text: As Florine falls through trap above and lands on
text: the floor, where he winces with pain and curses
dialog: his luck.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT ON STAGE.
text: Scene where Mephistopheles is tempting Faust --
text: shows him a vision of Marguerite (Carlotta). The
text: vision fades and Faust weakens.
scene_heading: INT. LIGHT CONTROL ROOM. .AMBER
text: We have an illustration of the light control room
text: and machinery. This room is under the stage and
text: in it is a short flight of steps leading to the
text: platform upon which the prompter is standing. The
text: light control man is standing near his levers but
text: has evidently neglected to watch the time. The
text: prompter, who can be seen bending down from his
text: box, calls the man's attention to the time. The
text: control man looks at his watch which is hanging in
text: front of him and immediately begins to pull two
text: levers, each in an opposite direction. Aside from
dialog: the interesting nature of this shot it seems to
dialog: plant the scenery for future situation.
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM. .AMBER.
text: This is a long shot taken from high up in the back
text: of the auditorium, showing the chandelier and
text: stage. Gently the lights die out in the chan-
dialog: delier, and at the same time the footlights
text: come on, leaving the house in semi-darkness.
scene_heading: INTIMATE SHOT OF ORCHESTRA PIT. . AMBER.
text: The leader is holding his baton aloft. He strikes
text: the air with it and seventy bows strike the strings
text: in one sweeping motion.
dialog: 91.
text: CLOSE UP IN PHILIPPE'S BOX.
text: Raoul is paying but little attention to the

text: keeps looking about anxiously - then she turns
text: to Philippe with a look of disappointment and
dialog: says:
text: "WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE RAOUL WENT!"
speaker_heading: BACK:
text: Philippe frowns darkly and he replies:
text: "HE'S PROBABLY IN THE FOYER DE DANCE
text: LOOKING UP SOME OF HIS COMMON AC-
dialog: QUAINTANCES."
speaker_heading: BACK:
text: Marie is hurt and disappointed - they move on.
text: MED. SHOT ON SECOND LANDING OF GRAND STAIRCASE.
text: The eyes of all the promenaders suddenly focus
text: on the Persian who comes down a flight of stairs
text: to the landing where he stops and looks about

text: A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER WAS THE PERSIAN
text: A REGULAR PATRON OF THE OPERA AND
scene_heading: ALWAYS ALONE, WHOSE SOURCE OF INCOME
text: WAS AS MUCH OF AN ENIGMA AS THE MAN
speaker_heading: HIMSELF.
scene_heading: C.V. OF THE PERSIAN.
text: This is a character study of a strange type -
text: he wears a dress suit and carries an astrachan cap.
text: He has olive skin, appears greatly interested in
text: his surroundings but never smiles.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT ON SECOND LANDING - AS IN 91.
text: The Persian moves down the steps off scene and
text: the promenaders watch after him, then whisper
text: curiously about him.
scene_heading: INT. CORNER FOYER DE DANCE. . AMBER.
text: This is located in the rear of the stage.
text: The richness of this room is executed principally
text: upon glass. It is a place of reunion between the
dialog: ballet girls and their admirers. In special prom-
text: inence are the dancers' practicing bars. They hold
dialog: to those bars while standing upon their toes or
text: place one ankle upon the bar while they stand upon
dialog: one toe and while they are doing these things
text: they are talking to their admirers. This is a gen-
text: eral entrance scene of the ballet girls and thirty
text: or more young and old Parisian dandies, patrons of
text: the opera, who are allowed in the foyer de dance
text: during the intermissions. It is a picture of pink
text: tights, fluffy lace skirts and Parisian dandies.
text: There is a flirting air of lightness, merriment
text: and laughter about. Some are practicing their
text: steps, others are flirting. Capt. Raoul is notice-
text: able, carrying on a familiar conversation with
dialog: La Sorelli, the ballet queen.
scene_heading: SEMI C.V. LA SORELLI AND RAOUL
text: Raoul is kidding her along and it is noticeable
text: that she is fascinated by his personality. Several
dialog: of the dandies we saw previously in her dressing
text: room come up and seek to draw her attention but
text: she pays them no heed and they are greatly ex-
text: asperated.
scene_heading: BACK STAGE. . FULL SET.

scene_heading: SEMI C.V. OF SORELLI AND RAOUL.
text: Raoul suddenly looks at his watch - is startled -

text: delight - she nods her head in the affirmative -
text: he exits laughing, she waving after him.
speaker_heading: BACK STAGE. (AT SIDE)
text: As Raoul enters still laughing to himself, he
text: chances to look at a big mirror and stops aghast
text: as he sees:
scene_heading: C.V. RAOUL BY BIG MIRROR.
text: In the mirror's reflection can be seen Christine

scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM CORRIDOR.

text: he looks up and down.
speaker_heading: C.V. OF RAOUL
text: His face falls in disappointment - his shoulders

scene_heading: INT. PHILIPPE'S BOX.
text: As Raoul returns - Philippe and the Comtess glower
text: at him and Marie playfully scolds him - Raoul is
text: too filled with emotion to pay her any attention.
text: She is amazed at his sudden indifference.
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM. . AMBER.
text: This is the Long Shot. It is a short scene of the
text: falling of the curtain upon the grand ballet. The
text: auditorium is flooded with light and a flutter of
text: relaxation runs over the audience.
text: CLOSE UP IN PHILIPPE'S BOX.
text: Raoul will not look at Marie - he keeps looking
text: at Philippe becoming more angry every minute - then

scene_heading: ANTE ROOM OF PHILIPPE'S BOX
text: As Raoul and Philippe come out of box and into f.g. -

speaker_heading: BACK:
text: Raoul's eyes light up with a dangerous light -

text: to cool down, then follows.
scene_heading: SEMI C. V. OF PHILIPPE'S BOX
text: As Philippe seats himself and Raoul does likewise -

text: Florine is discovered at the hand winch on the

scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT. . FAINT GREEN.
text: As Florine turns the winch two scene frames move
text: upward and one downward. The movement of these
text: discovers the shadow upon the center wall of
text: aman, hanging, gently swinging. As the frames
dialog: move both ways, all or any part of the hanging man may
text: be shown. Florine does not see either the hanging
dialog: man or the shadow at first, so intent is he upon
text: the black opening. He now turns and through the
text: framework in front of him he is confronted by the
text: hanging man. The audience cannot see this, only
text: the shadow. Florine is paralyzed with fear and his
text: knees knock together. He backs away from the ap-
text: parition and turns to escape up the stairs. But he
text: is now confronted with the shadow. He is in utmost
text: distress. He is surrounded with hanging men. After an
text: instant of confusion, Florine runs the gauntlet

scene_heading: INT. CELLAR #4 (HEADLESS STATUE). . FAINT GREEN
text: Discovered a variety of cellar hands, a fireman, a

dialog: what he has seen.

text: on the stallion. We plant the stallion fastened to
text: a ring bolt in the stone wall by a strap and is
text: parallel with the wall. The blacksmith is holding
text: up the hoof of the great white stallion to measure
text: a shoe, then he moves over to the forge and with
text: his back to the horse pumps the bellows and sings
text: to himself -- then a strange thing happens, a section
text: of the wall and floor upon which the white stallion
text: stands suddenly turns as if upon an axle and the white
text: stallion vanishes leaving apparently the same
text: wall floor and ring bolt - the smithy lifts the red
text: hot shoe from the forge and prepares to hammer it.
text: He casually looks around toward the place where the
text: horse was, gasps and drops the hammer. Then thinking
text: perhaps one of the stablemen played a joke, he calls

scene_heading: INT. CELLAR #5. ("ROI DE LAHORE" SET). FAINT GREEN
text: The group from above are seen coming down the
text: circular staircase. The shadow of a hanging man
text: is no longer there. There is something in the f.g.
text: so placed and lighted that the audience cannot
text: discern what it is. The party of men enter from
text: the staircase and look around in a hushed way.
text: Florine looks for the shadow - then he looks for
text: the body. Both are gone. His mind seems to be
text: helpless to grasp the situation. By one second all
text: eyes center upon the object in the f.g., ina

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. MME. VALERIUS
text: Mme. Valerius is just in the act of opening the
text: door and M. Lavelle enters with a cheery smile.
scene_heading: SEMI C.V. NEAR DOOR.
text: As Mme. Valerius greets Lavelle. The latter
text: produces Raoul's letter and hands it to the
text: woman. As he starts to explain about it,
text: Mme. Valerius places her finger to her lips
text: quickly to caution him. Then shaking her head
text: in the negative with a warning expression that
text: Christine must not know, she quickly hides the
text: letter in her bodice.
scene_heading: INT. CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM.
text: Christine has heard voices and curious, she arises
text: and exits.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT IN LIVING ROOM.
text: Mme. Valerius and Lavelle hear Christine coming.
text: The woman again registers a look of warning. Then
text: Christine enters. She greets Lavelle who is very
text: nervous and uncomfortable and anxious to get away.
text: Her wistful look is suddenly illuminated by a
text: hopeful smile. She presses her hands together and
speaker_heading: INSERT LETTER
dialog: says:
text: "YOU BROUGHT ME SOME MAIL."
text: BACK: He is confused and tongue-tied: he looks
text: toward Mme. Valerius whose eyes show warning.
text: He recovers his poise, a bit, and shakes his head
text: in the negative, Christine's face falls and she
text: swallows hard. Lavelle takes the chance to get
text: away. He places his hand on the door latch and says:
text: "I CAME TO TELL YOU, THE OPERA HOUSE
text: WILL RE-OPEN A WEEK FROM TODAY."
text: BACK: Christine nods but her mind is far away.
text: Lavelle bows, then exits.
scene_heading: SEMI C.V. CHRISTINE & GRANDMOTHER.
text: Two tears roll down Christine's cheeks. The other
text: swallows hard. She just cannot be cruel. She
text: pulls the letter from her bodice and pushes it
text: up with Raoul's letter. As Christine sees it, her
text: face is transfigured with joy. She seizes it
text: eagerly. Then is swept into her grandmother's
text: arms. When the other releases her, Christine
text: hungrily tears open the envelope and reads:
scene_heading: MY DARLING CHRISTINE:
text: WOULD YOU BREAK THE HEART OF ONE WHO

text: HIM THE MEMORY OF YOUR SWEET PERFUME?
text: CAN YOU FORBID HIM THE WONDER OF YOUR

dialog: PLEASE SEE ME!
scene_heading: YOUR IMMEDIATE SLAVE
speaker_heading: RAOUL. .
text: BACK: Christine looks up from the letter, all
text: thrilled with the wonder of it. She is wild with
text: joy. She cries out her joy, then runs from the scene.
scene_heading: INT. CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM
text: As she runs in simply overcome with joy and prepares
speaker_heading: INSERT OF LETTER
text: to answer Raoul's letter.
text: CLOSE UP OF CHRISTINE AT DESK.
text: As she starts to write the letter.
scene_heading: LAP DISSOLVE INTO
dialog: DEAREST RAOUL: I feel that I must

dialog: Christine.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
text: AT PERROS, BY THE SEA
speaker_heading: FADE IN.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN AT PERROS. QUICK FADE IN.
text: The location is a quaint little garden in Brittany.
text: In the b.g. looking over a low garden wall is the
text: ocean. Upon the left is a little Inn. The Inn of
text: the Setting Sun. On the right there is a little
text: arbor. Christine is discovered, occupied with
text: thoughts of long ago. Christine's dress is so
dialog: conceived that it will lend to the spiritual quality
text: of her character. She is sad and passive and looks
text: a frail little figure.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP CHRISTINE.
text: Her spirituality and the mystery surrounding her are
text: brought out. She sees someone approaching and is
text: enveloped in a complexity of emotions. She loves
text: Raoul and her eyes twinkle. She fears the meeting
text: and her heart aches, yet she yearns for it and she
text: runs toward the wall.
text: A LONGER SHOT.
text: With glad anticipation - Christine runs to the
text: low wall. Raoul runs in and jumps over the wall
text: and starts panting before her.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP RAOUL AND CHRISTINE.
text: Eagerly he devours her with his eyes and is about to
text: take her into his arms. It is plain to be seen
text: that she is his for the taking. However, he is
text: suddenly choked by an onrush of jealousy and his
text: arms drop to his side. He speaks to her
text: impetuously:
text: "WHY DIDN'T YOU WISH TO RECOGNIZE
text: ME IN YOUR DRESSING ROOM?... WHY
dialog: WERE YOU SO ANXIOUS FOR ME TO GO?"
text: BACK: The bright eagerness dies out of her eyes.
text: She stands staring at Raoul without replying.
text: She cannot answer because there is too much to
dialog: explain. 'You don't answer' he indicates
text: unhappily. Then with an outburst of jealousy
text: and suspicion, he exclaims:
dialog: "I'LL ANSWER FOR YOU! ..IT WAS
text: BECAUSE THERE WAS ANOTHER WITH YOU...
dialog: A MAN FROM WHOM YOU MUST HIDE OUR
dialog: ROMANCE!"
text: BACK: Christine's eyes dilate wider in
text: horror and amazement.
scene_heading: C.V. OF RAOUL.
text: As he raves on with jealous suspicion:
dialog: 
dialog: "DON'T FEIGN SURPRISE! ...I HEARD
text: HIS VOICE! I HEARD YOU SAY 'TONIGHT
dialog: I SING ONLY FOR YOU ...I GAVE YOU MY
speaker_heading: SOUL'".
scene_heading: CLOSE UP RAOUL & CHRISTINE.
text: At these words from Raoul, a deathly pallor spreads
text: over Christine's face...she almost faints. Raoul
text: becomes conscious of his odious behavior and seeks
text: to apologize. Then suddenly her eyes moisten and
text: two great tears roll down her cheeks. Raoul tries
text: to take her in his arms, but she escapes and flees
text: in great disorder. Raoul calls after her, then
text: angry at himself...turns and gazes, gloomily out
text: over the sea.
scene_heading: ANOTHER SECTION OF THE LITTLE GARDEN.
text: As Christine flees into scene from behind camera.
text: Then she steps and turns around revealing that she
text: is sorry she ran away. She makes up her mind
text: to explain everything to him...exits back behind
dialog: camera.
scene_heading: SEMI C.V. AT GARDEN WALL
text: Raoul is gazing despondently out to sea when Christine
text: slips up behind him. She is smiling again. She
text: touches his shoulder. He turns with a start, then
text: smiles and captures her hands. He starts to pull
dialog: her to him, when she says:
text: "I WANT TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO YOU"
text: BACK: Raoul is at once interested. He releases
text: her hands and permits her to tell him of the past.
text: She leads him off scene.
text: A LONGER SHOT.
text: Christine leads Raoul to the little arbor on the
text: right. Both sit down upon the moss covered bench.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP RAOUL AND CHRISTINE.
text: He is sorry for the pain he has caused her. He
text: begs her forgiveness and tries to take her into
text: his arms. She repulses him gently. The moment is
text: too serious for this. The tears trickle down her
text: cheek as she begins to speak:
text: "YOU REMEMBER THAT WHEN WE WERE
text: CHILDREN, MY FATHER TOLD US OF THE
text: ANGEL OF MUSIC...HOW WHEN HE VISITED
text: PEOPLE, THOSE PEOPLE HAD GENIUS?"
text: BACK: Raoul nods in the affirmative and listens.
scene_heading: C.V. OF CHRISTINE
text: She continues in an exalted manner:
text: "RAOUL, MY FATHER PROMISED TO SEND
text: ME THE ANGEL OF MUSIC FROM HEAVEN
dialog: AND HE HAS!"
text: SEMI CLOSE UP OF CHRISTINE & RAOUL.
text: Raoul is startled and looks at her stupidly, then
text: incredulously - then suspiciously. Christine does
text: not observe the reaction in him. She continues
dialog: more lightly than before.
dialog: "IT WAS HIS VOICE YOU HEARD. HE
text: VISITS ME NIGHTLY IN MY DRESSING
text: ROOM TO GIVE ME MUSIC LESSONS."
text: BACK: Raoul bursts out laughing - a mad laugh -
text: and to Christine, a rude, insulting laugh. She
text: draws away from him with a hostile air. He tells
dialog: her with intensity:
text: "CHRISTINE SOMEBODY IS MAKING A
dialog: GAME OF YOU."
text: BACK: She cries out at him and her eyes flash.
text: She is deeply hurt. She thinks that he does not
text: believe she is an honest girl. Then she leaps to
text: her feet and runs away. Raoul pursues.
scene_heading: LONGER SHOT OF GARDEN.
text: As Raoul pursues Christine to the Inn door where
text: he grabs and detains her.
scene_heading: SEMI C.V. OUTSIDE INN DOOR.
text: As Raoul tries to placate Christine. He releases
text: his hold on her arm, whereupon she gives him an
text: angry look and without replying, enters the
text: Inn door and slams it in his face. Raoul is
text: chagrined and disappointed. He curses the luck
text: then moves away sadly.
text: sees FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: FADE IN
text: EXT IN GARDEN AT PERROS. BLUE SLOW FADE IN.
text: It is night of the same day. The play of light
text: and shadow makes a beautiful but depressing scene.
text: There is a stage background. At first, the heaven
text: is filled with stars. Then as the full moon
text: begins to rise over the horizon, the stars begin
text: to fade and long shadows creep out into the garden.
text: Raoul is sitting in the little alcove just where
text: he was left. He is downcast and gloomy. His
text: attention suddenly becomes centered. The door
text: opens - The door to the Inn and he arises. Slowly
text: the door opens and Christine enters, dressed all in
text: white. Her eyes are fixed and look into space. She
text: moves like one walking in her sleep. Raoul
text: who is in foreground, watches Christine exit with
text: growing suspicion. Then he follows her with
dialog: caution.
scene_heading: EXT. IN GRAVEYARD AT PERROS. BLUE
text: This is a country graveyard beside a little church
dialog: in Brittany and it must be so conceived that it
dialog: will seem reasonable to appear it joins the
text: garden. Skeletons and skulls by the hundreds are
text: heaped against the wall of the church. The full
text: moon throws its light upon the scene. Christine
text: enters like a sleeping walker and picks her way
text: amongst the graves. Raoul enters a short distance
text: behind and follows her at a distance. Christine
text: finally stops before a grave with a moss covered
text: headstone and kneels.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP CHRISTINE. BLUE
text: In this shot a part of the inscription upon the
dialog: headstone may be read:
speaker_heading: HENRIK DAAE
dialog: and under this 182... (and the last
dialog: numeral obliterated and entire death data
dialog: obliterated.)
text: Christine makes the sign of the cross and begins
dialog: to pray.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP RAOUL. BLUE.
text: He is watching her intently. He feels a tender
text: pang of sympathy for this lone girl praying at
text: her father's grave. Suddenly Raoul raises his
text: head in an attitude of listening. He is puzzled.
text: He can't locate the source of the sound.
text: BEHIND THE WALL OF THE SACRISTY.
text: Discovered the Phantom wearing his mask and
dialog: 246.

text: CLOSE UP OF CHRISTINE AT GRAVE.
text: She slowly raises her head. Her face is trans-
text: formed and transfigured with awe and ecstasy
text: as she listens.
scene_heading: BEHIND WALL OF SACRISTY. (FLASH)
text: The Phantom playing the violin.
scene_heading: SEMI C.V. OF RAOUL.
text: He is startled and dismayed for he hears the
text: same strange melody that he had heard outside
text: Christine's dressing room door. Then as he
text: listens, his passion arises - in a jealous frenzy.
scene_heading: BEHIND WALL OF SACRISTY (FLASH)
text: The Phantom stops playing and peers over the
text: wall of the sacristy.
scene_heading: SHOT OF CHRISTINE AND RAOUL BLUE.
text: Christine's face is radiant. She turns and winds
text: her way out of the graveyard and she is in the same
text: mood that she entered. Raoul's eyes follow Christine
text: for a second. Then again he begins to search for
text: the source of the music with his eyes. He
text: thinks he hears a noise in the direction of the bone
dialog: heap and he takes two or three steps in this
dialog: direction.
scene_heading: ANOTHER SHOT. BLUE.
text: This is shooting upon Raoul's back with the bone-

scene_heading: C.V. BEHIND SACRISTY WALL.

dialog: 254.
text: his feet. Then two more tumble toward him in
dialog: the same fashion
scene_heading: CLOSE UP RAOUL. BLUE.
text: He is puzzled and in a measure horrified. A
text: half dozen skulls roll in and increase the pile
text: at his feet. He takes a step backward as if
text: they were obnoxious to him. Then with a start
text: he glances offscene at his right.
text: MED SHOT OF GRAVEYARD.
text: As a strange shadow moves rapidly thru the

scene_heading: c.V. RAOUL.

scene_heading: SEMI C.V. IN RAOUL'S BOX.

scene_heading: SEMI C.V. IN RAOUL'S BOX

scene_heading: MED CLOSE UP RAOUL & PERSIAN AMBER.
text: The two men stop and look at each other, just for
text: an instant, one look, but in that look the Persian
text: expresses a friendly compassion for Raoul. The
text: Persian then passes on toward the stage; Raoul
text: looks after him. It strikes Raoul with sudden
dialog: force that perhaps this Persian is Christine's
text: Angel of Music. Raoul shows his suspicions and
text: again turns toward Christine's dressing room.
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM CORRIDOR...AMBER.
text: Raoul raps at Christine's door. As there is no

text: and he exits...into the dressing room.
scene_heading: INT. CHRISTINE'S DRESSING ROOM AMBER
text: Raoul enters and finds a gas light burning but

scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM AMBER
text: This is a very long shot. The curtains at the

text: Daae appears alone, a diminutive little figure
text: upon which thousands of eyes are focused. The

scene_heading: DRESSING ROOM CORRIDOR.
text: As Christine comes happily down the corridor,
text: her arms laden with flowers and accompanied
text: by a group of admiring ballet girls who shower
text: her with praise.
scene_heading: INT. CHRISTINE'S DRESSING ROOM.
text: Raoul looks about in a panic. Then he decides
text: he will hide. He conceals himself in her closet
text: just in time, for the door opens and Christine
text: enters. She waves good-bye to the ballet girls
text: and closing the door, crosses quietly to her
text: mirror, where she hugs the flowers happily.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP AT CLOSET DOOR. AMBER.
text: Raoul is looking at her from the closet. He takes
text: a step forward to go to her, then sees a change in
text: her which causes him to pause.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP CHRISTINE...AMBER
text: A strangeness has come over Christine. She
text: raises her head in an attitude of listening. Her
text: eyes seem to be fixed upon space.
text: PASSAGE WAY BACK OF MIRROR.
text: As the masked Phantom plays his violin.
text: CLOSE SHOT IN CLOSET.
text: Raoul is suspicious yet puzzled. He feels that he
text: is about to witness the proof of her perfidy.
text: He watches intently.
text: CLOSE UP OF CHRISTINE BEFORE MIRROR.
text: She stretches out her arms toward the mirror and
text: with an exalted look, says:
text: "I AM HERE, ANGEL OF MUSIC."
text: BACK: The glass begins to quiver. A dozen images
text: of Christine are seen, all quivering. Christine
text: herself is terrified. She gropes blindly at
text: a long white drape hanging beside the mirror.
text: The terrified Christine disappears through the mirror
text: and is gone with the mirror hanging and the
text: torn drape with her.
scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT AMBER
text: Raoul runs into the room from the closet. He
text: pounds at the glass with his fists. He tries to
text: move it. He strikes at the walls wildly. Then,
text: worn out, empty-brained, he takes up a chair and
text: with all his strength, hurls it at the mirror.
text: The chair is shattered and the mirror uninjured.
text: Then exhausted, he sinks down upon the couch and
text: buries his face in his hands.
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGEWAY. BACK OF MIRROR (FAINT GREEN)
text: Christine finds herself in a gloomy passage
text: lighted by a single ray of light which comes
text: from some unseen source. Christine clutches the
text: drapes - bewildered and terrified - but she does
text: not cry out. She looks ahead of her in the
text: direction of the improvised runway, but she does
text: not look directly downward. Then she turns to
text: the mysterious door thru which she has just
text: entered. Near her from below a long arm is
text: extended into the scene. The fingers of the hand
text: are held close together, stiff and straight. The
text: hand itself is not made up for a skeleton's hand,
text: but merely to suggest one slightly. Then, without
text: a step, the figure of Erick moves upward into
text: scene, without motion on his part as if he were
text: being lifted upon an elevator. Erick wears
text: a black mask covering his eyes and nose. The
text: eyes seem to be two black holes. The part of
text: the face that is visible, the chin and the
text: mouth, is hideous. There is practically no
text: hair on the head. He is dressed all in black,
dialog: his own peculiar fashion of evening
text: clothes. The whole is covered by a long black
dialog: cloak.
text: Erick extends his hand and grasps Christine by
text: the wrist. She stands motionless, burned to
text: stone, but does not turn her eyes upon him yet.
text: A STONE COLD HAND THAT
text: SMELLED OF DEATH!
text: BACK: Christine screams in sudden hysterical
text: terror and looks up into his face. She screams
text: and begins to fight him hysterically. This
text: scene is played very rapidly.
scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT. FAINT GREEN
text: This shot shows an improvised runway with the
text: exit in the left f.g. In the b.g. can be seen
text: the machinery of the mirror, the two counter-
text: pieces, etc. One of Erick's feet is still
text: resting upon one of the counterpieces to explain
dialog: how he came to be elevated into the picture.
text: He rode up upon the moving counterpiece.
text: Christine is fighting him hysterically. He takes
text: her bodily in his arms. The drape is partially
text: folded about her.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP ERICK & CHRISTINE. FAINT GREEN
text: As Christine struggles and screams, Erick's
text: skeleton hand closes over her mouth. When her
text: horrified eyes catch sight of Erick's face
text: close to hers, she partially swoons but does not
text: entirely lose consciousness. (This screaming is
text: employed to key the scene down so that it can
text: again be keyed up when Christine enters Erick's
dialog: abode.) There must be this transition here,
dialog: because if Christine continues to oppose
dialog: Erick, she would not sit willingly upon the
text: white stallion nor row quietly in his arms in
dialog: the boat.
scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT. FAINT GREEN.
text: Christine in his arms, Erick sweeps over the
text: improvised runway with her and exits to the left.
text: The long drape is floating after them.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE IN CELLAR. FAINT GREEN.
text: Erick swoops in on the bridge from the right,
text: carrying Christine, the drape floating behind
text: them. Christine is pliable in his arms,
text: half in a swoon. Christine is reluctant. Erick exits
text: with her to the left. The scene changes by employ-
text: ing a traveling iris. As one picture irises out
dialog: of one corner,
text: the next simultaneously irises in another.
text: Thus there is not an instant of blank screen.
dialog: These irises should always travel in the
dialog: direction of the action. (It is suggested
text: that in each of these lapses, the fade-outs
text: be taken three ways, by lap dissolving, fading
text: and the moving iris.)
scene_heading: INT. CELLAR BLANK CORRIDOR. FAINT GREEN.
scene_heading: MOVING IRIS IN
text: Caesar, the great white stallion is tethered
text: here and beside him upon the floor is a lantern.
text: With a gliding motion, Erick, Christine in his
text: arms, moves to the horse. As he lifts her upon
text: the horse's back, Christine mildly resists, but
text: fixes herself upon the horse, and remains there.
text: Erick takes up the lantern and leads the horse
text: out, the long drape making a picture.
scene_heading: MOVING IRIS OUT

text: produced by the lantern Erick carries.
text: MOVING IRIS OUT.
scene_heading: CROSS SECTION SHOT OF THREE CELLARS. FAINT GREEN.
text: MOVING IRIS IN.
text: This shows diagonal runways leading from one

text: carrying Christine, is in the middle cellar
text: of the three. He leads the horse around the
text: turn and starts down the runway toward the
text: bottom cellar. MOVING IRIS OUT.
scene_heading: INT. ON LAKE #1 FAINT GREEN
text: This first shot is looking from the distance
text: over the still waters to the approach in the
text: b.g. Behind the boat and the landing place,
text: there is quite a deep view into the cellar
dialog: approach. This is for the end drama with the
text: mob. A boat, moored in front of this approach,
dialog: has a fantastic shape, say a Venetian line, and
text: is painted black.
text: Erick enters leading horse. This is all in b.g.
text: He places the light in the boat, takes Christine
text: in his arms and as he does so, the horse exits as
text: if by habit. Erick steps into the boat with
text: Christine and the drape. With his free hand, he
text: takes a long pole and gives the boat one shove. He
text: glides toward the camera into the darkness, the
text: drape floating upon the water in its wake.
scene_heading: LAKE SHOT NO.2 FAINT GREEN
text: This is the big lake shot. This shoots from the
text: light into the darkness. The boat glides in from
text: the darkness, the figure in it motionless. The
text: boat glides up to two or three stone steps before
text: a deep stone casemented door in the masonry on
text: the left. The boat comes to a stop before the
text: steps. Erick pulls a ring attached to a heavy
text: chain, hanging from a hole in the masonry. The
text: heavy door swings open and Erick and Christine
text: is lying in his arms as a flood of dazzling light
text: shows she is in his arms limply and without any
text: movement of resistance. She is like one in a dream or
text: stupor. Erick carries her from the boat through
text: the door.

text: 3- The door to Erick's bedroom.
text: 4- A short flight of steps leading up to a
text: screened opening leading to the torture chamber.
text: 5 - A Spanish chest which contains: the Cricket
dialog: and the Grasshopper.
text: 6 - A trap door on the floor opening upon steps
text: leading into the cellar.
text: 7 - The hidden opening to Erick's secret passage
text: and stairs by which Erick leaves the house by a
text: route other than by the lake.
text: 8 - A sounding device upon the wall.
text: This room is artistically arranged.
text: This suite of rooms is in the very foundation of
text: the opera house. Thousands of tons of masonry is
text: above and are being upheld by the arches and walls
dialog: of the room. There is nothing of fantasy in the
text: actual lines and construction of the suite. The
text: fantastic is applied by Erick's hand in the
text: lighting, furnishings and draperies.
text: Artistically arranged with many variations of
text: freshly cut flowers. Each of the furnishings
dialog: is old-fashioned, the idea being that it belonged
text: to Erick's mother. The couch is very light,
text: much higher than an ordinary couch.
text: Erick enters carrying Christine. He crosses the
text: room to the high couch and gently places her upon
text: it. He then returns to the door and closes it.
text: Christine's stupor is giving way to astonishment
text: and bewilderment. She begins to look at the
text: strange room when Erick returns to her. She still
text: is not sufficiently recovered from her stupor to
text: be startled and shocked by Erick's approach. He
text: observes her for an instant with folded arms in an
dialog: attitude of humility.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP ERICK & CHRISTINE AMBER
text: Slowly Erick sinks to his knees upon a footstool.
text: He is most abject and humble. He touches the
text: fold of her dress. He presses it to his breast
text: and then to his lips. Christine is watching him
text: as one hypnotized. Then she screams a sudden
text: and terrified scream. She springs from the couch.
scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT. AMBER
text: In the center of the room Christine hesitates,
text: then wildly runs out through the door leading
text: to Erick's bed chamber. Without haste and in
text: humility, he moves after her.
scene_heading: INT. ERICK'S BED CHAMBER. AMBER
text: The walls and the low ceiling are hung in black.
text: In the middle of the room there is a canopy from
text: which hangs curtains of red brocaded stuff. Under
text: this canopy there is an open coffin, an elaborate
text: affair lined with wuffed silk. It is fantastic
text: but must look like a coffin - the lid is open.
text: When Christine enters the coffin is not seen.
text: She enters and stands frozen to the spot. Her
text: wildness gives way to a dumb terror. The
text: camera pans revealing the coffin and the canopy,
text: but keeping Christine in the scene. Erick enters
text: to her side in a quiet humble way. Indicating
text: the coffin, he tells her in a matter-of-fact way:
text: "THIS IS WHERE I SLEEP."
text: BACK: She looks at him with quiet horror and
text: incredulity. She begins to get an idea. It begins
text: to force itself upon her. Erick continues:
text: "ONE HAS TO GET USED TO EVERYTHING
text: IN LIFE, NEVER TO ETERNITY."
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP CHRISTINE AND ERICK. AMBER
text: The shot cuts out the coffin. Christine's
text: terrified eyes are now fastened intently upon
text: Erick's face. The thought that has forced
text: itself upon her, is a revelation to her. She
text: cries at him with loathing:
dialog: "YOU ARE NOT THE ANGEL OF MUSIC....
dialog: YOU ARE THE OPERA GHOST!"
text: BACK: Erick ignores this. He indicates toward
dialog: the coffin, "This is not a pleasant sight for you.
dialog: You had better go into the next room."
text: Christine here begins a transition. From the
text: positive, assuming attitude, one of hopelessness
text: and fear begins to envelope her. She begins
text: to tremble and without removing her eyes from
text: his face, backs into the drawing room.
scene_heading: INT. ERICK'S DRAWING ROOM AMBER.
text: Christine enters from Erick's bed chamber to the
text: center of the room. She is now a pathetic,
text: helpless little figure, hopeless, without under-
text: standing of what is to happen to her and trembling
text: with fear. Erick enters from his bedchamber and
text: goes to her with a humble stoop of the shoulders.
text: He stands before her an instant in an abject attitude.
scene_heading: INT. ERIK'S DRAWING ROOM AMBER
text: Erick seems to fully understand her attitude. He
text: tells her humbly:
text: "CHRISTINE, YOU MUST KNOW THE TRUTH.
dialog: I'M NOT A GHOST...NOR AN ANGEL OF
dialog: MUSIC..."
text: BACK: She is wide-eyed and motionless and remains
text: this way throughout the scene. Erick continues
dialog: sadly:
text: "JUST A MAN OF FLESH AND BLOOD....
dialog: I AM ERICK!"
text: BACK: Christine is stunned by this knowledge
text: for she recognizes the voice. She says angrily
dialog: though frightened:
text: "IF YOU ARE HUMAN, REMOVE THAT MASK
dialog: SO THAT I MAY SEE YOUR FACE."
text: BACK: Erik recoils in alarm and takes a step
dialog: backward.
speaker_heading: c.V. ERIK.
text: His face and frame tremble with emotion as he answers
dialog: "YOU SHALL NEVER SEE ERIK'S FACE...
dialog: UNLESS YOU RESIGN YOURSELF TO THE
scene_heading: FATE OF NEVER AGAIN SEEING THE
scene_heading: LIGHT OF DAY"
text: INT ERIK'S DRAWING ROOM.
text: Christine is terrified...she becomes hysterical
text: and sinking to her knees, pleads with him to
text: release her - to take her home. Instead, Erik
text: gazes at her with folded arms and he says with
dialog: tragic sadness:
dialog: "I LOVE YOU CHRISTINE....I HAVE
dialog: BROUGHT YOU HERE A PRISONER..."
text: BACK: There is a movement of Christine's eyes,
dialog: something to indicate terrible suspense...He
text: continues the title, humbly:
dialog: "...FOR LOVE!"
text: BACK: Christine's hands go to her temples. She
text: totters an instant - then swoons. As she falls,
text: he catches her in his arms and allows her to
text: sink gently to the floor. He kneels beside her
text: and sways and moans and beats his chest and
text: groveling, he kisses the hem of her garment.
text: Slowly then Christine regains consciousness. She
text: is at first terrified; then as he sees the
text: tragic outpouring of a sublime love, she can only
text: feel pity for the strange creature who weeps and
text: beats his breast. When Erik sees she is
text: conscious, he seizes her hands and covers them
text: with burning kisses. Christine draws away and
dialog: says:
dialog: "I CAN ONLY DESPISE YOU, IF YOU
text: HOLD ME HERE AGAINST MY WILL."
speaker_heading: C.V. OF ERIK
text: As he realizes that there is truth in her
dialog: statement. The fear of losing her is as
text: great as his love. He grovels at her feet and
dialog: pleads:
text: "AT THE END OF FIVE DAYS, YOU SHALL
dialog: BE FREE....FEAR NOT. FOR HE WHO
text: WORSHIPS YOU I AS I DO, ALSO RESPECTS!"
scene_heading: INT. ERIK'S DRAWING ROOM.
text: Christine sinks back with a hopeless sigh and
text: offers no resistance, when he tenderly picks her
text: up in his arms.
text: A LOWER SHOT...AMBER.
text: Erik takes Christine in his arms and carries
text: her into her bedroom.
scene_heading: INT CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM. ..AMBER
text: The room is dimly lighted and all that is seen
text: is the dim outline of a bed and a door. This is
dialog: an extraordinary bed, a something dramatic, something
text: that does not exist. Erik enters with Christine
text: and places her gently upon the bed. He stands
text: for an instant in the doorway in silhouette and
text: looks at her, then exits and closes the door.
text: Christine arises to a sitting position.
scene_heading: C.V. OF CHRISTINE.
text: The reaction to her various emotions comes over

scene_heading: EXT REAR OF PARIS OPERA HOUSE

text: "THE POLICE ARE UNABLE TO FIND A CLUE
scene_heading: TO CHRISTINE DAAE'S WHEREABOUTS. YOUR
text: BROTHER DOES NOTHING BUT HAUNT THE OPERA

text: BACK: Philippe snorts angrily as he answers:
text: "I KNOW ALL THAT! BUT WHAT HAVE YOU
dialog: DONE ABOUT RAOUL?"
text: BACK: The attorney swallows hard as he explains with
text: a triumphant smile -- Philippe listens with growing
text: satisfaction, then springs up with a real sincere
text: human smile-- to offer his hand to Cartier and the
dialog: other takes it all swelled up with pride -- at that
dialog: instant both turn as--

dialog: sincerity what they think will be the best for Raoul.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: INT. ERICK'S MUSIC ROOM AMBER
text: Erick is sitting at the organ in half silhouette,
text: playing the organ. There must be something weird
text: and wild in the picture. Perhaps some of the objects
text: surrounding him can lend to the effect.
scene_heading: INT. CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM ....AMBER
text: Christine is calm, hypnotized by the powerful music
text: she is hearing. She is marveling at the genius of this
text: man and is touched by his music.
text: IT WAS THE STRANGEST MOST BEAUTIFUL
text: MUSIC SHE HAD EVER HEARD. IT WAS A

text: Upon the organ is a violin. Erick is seated upon an
text: elevated bench so that when Christine enters he will
text: be about as high as she is. Christine enters back
text: of Erick and stands spellbound in wonderment at the
text: music and at the man's genius. Erick senses her

scene_heading: C.V. OF ERICK'S FACE (MASKED) PRIZMA

scene_heading: SEMI C.V. IN CORNER
text: As Erick backs Christine against the wall and
text: towering over her, he screams:
text: "OH HOW I HATE RAOUL. BUT HE'LL NEVER
text: HAVE YOU CHRISTINE****NOT IN THIS LIFE!"
text: BACK: Erick moves closer to Christine as if he is
text: going to take her in his arms--she throws up her
text: hands to warn him off. This brings Christine to
text: herself. Somethings has been revealed and it sha-
text: dows the tone of the scene. Up to this moment Chris-
text: tine had been hypnotized by his music. The spell
text: of the music now dispelled and she begins to look
text: at the man with curiosity and increasing antagonism--
text: then as his horrid face comes closer and closer, she
text: suddenly seizes the mask and tears it from his face--
text: then repelled against the wall with a scream of terror
text: and revulsion. Facing Christine is a death's head
text: that is alive with four black holes for its eyes,
text: nose and mouth, a skin pallid and yellow--Erick utters
text: a terrible cry of grief, despair and rage, then towers
text: over her, hissing words and curses upon her.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP OF ERICK. AMBER
text: He wags the terrible thing that is the head upon

scene_heading: LONGER SHOT...AMBER
text: Christine shrinks from him and falls, upon her knees.
text: Erick follows her, towers over her and cries:
text: "FEAST YOUR EYES, GLUT YOUR SOUL ON MY

text: BACK: Christine lifts her arms and begs for mercy.

text: BACK: He seizes her by the hands and digs them into
text: his awful face. He tears his flesh with her hands
dialog: and cries:
text: "KNOW THAT I AM BUILT OF DEATH FROM
text: HEAD TO FOOT.. THAT IT IS A CORPSE
dialog: THAT LOVES AND ADORES YOU!"
text: BACK: Christine is so horrified and aghast that, though
text: she speaks, her words are sobs, heaving sobs. Erick
text: releases her and goes down at her with his terrible
text: contorted with a hideous grin, then he stops,
text: pulls backward laughing wildly. Her hair is lopsided
text: and streaming over her shoulder. Torn by uncontrolled
text: hysteria, tears, she raises to him appealing and makes
text: two steps forward, upon her knees, begging forgiveness
dialog: for the terrible thing she has done. He is towering
text: over her with folded arms, his face slowly loosing

text: piteously.
dialog: "NOW THAT YOU KNOW MY HIDEOUSNESS,
dialog: YOU WOULD NEVER COME BACK, IF I LET
dialog: YOU GO FREE --THEREFORE I CRY FOR YOU---

scene_heading: INT GRAND STAIRCASE NO 2. PRIZMA
text: The grand staircase and the galleries above it
text: present a gorgeous array of funny dress costumes,
text: silks and satins, all sorts of picturesque and
text: interesting creations. The staircase and galleries
text: are so filled up with people that it is almost a
text: jam--Although most of the people are costumed,
text: many are in evening dress and wear opera masks.
text: It is a scene of noise, laughter and color, gaiety
text: and emotion. On the left side of the staircase,
text: where it takes a left angle turn, Raoul is walking.
text: He is masked in evening dress and wears a black
text: costume. Christine is presumably on her way down
text: the left staircase. She is dressed in modest
text: evening dress and is masked.
scene_heading: INTIMATE SHOT OF ANOTHER GROUP...PRIZMA
text: An interesting noisy group.
text: MED CLOSE UP OF RAOUL PRIZMA
text: He is looking for anyone who might be Christine.
text: Christine, masked, enters from the staircase behind him
text: and touches him upon the arm. Her motions are hurried
text: and nervous. He turns upon her and she raises a warn-
text: ing finger to her lips. He understands and follows
text: her up the left staircase.
scene_heading: SHOOTING AGAINST LEFT STAIRCASE PRIZMA
text: Raoul hurries through the crowd following Christine
text: and they exit. The moment they are out of the picture
text: all of the people begin to look in the direction of
text: the right staircase. All gaiety and motion slowly
text: dies down. People crane their necks forward in a
text: hushed way.
scene_heading: INT. GRAND STAIRCASE NO 1 PRIZMA
text: This is a crop shot at the right staircase. The hush
text: has extended to all the people in the scene. All
text: motion has died out except at the entrance to the
text: right of the staircase. There is a stir, a shrinking
text: away of the people, there. The Red Death creeps into
text: the picture from the corridor. It is a man dressed in
text: all scarlet, with a huge hat and feathers, on the top
text: of a wonderful death's head. From his shoulder hangs
text: an immense red velvet cloak, which trails along the
text: floor like a King's train. It is plainly to be seen
text: that the death's head the man is wearing is a mask.
text: In all the Phantom's scenes here, he is in sweeping

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT CROUP ON STAIRCASE PRIZMA
text: Men and women shudder and shrink in disgust & horror.
scene_heading: INT. GRAND STAIRCASE PRIZMA
text: MED. CLOSE UP CENTER DOOR LEADING TO LANDING
text: The noise and the gaiety is at its height. A number of
text: masked ballet girls are in evidence. Florine enters
text: from the center door. He is costumed as a swash-
dialog: buckling pirate, the terror of the spanish Main. We
text: see he wears a broadsword and all the other finery.
text: His mask has the habit of falling off. Sometimes
text: it is on his chin like a beard and at other times on
text: his forehead. He enters swaggering and his broad
text: sword gets mixed up in his legs thereby attracting
dialog: attention.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP OF FLORINE...PRIZMA
text: As he untangles his broadsword his masked face
text: falls off and he quietly fastens it on again.

text: Florine has not been quick enough with his mask how-
dialog: ever. The ballet girls have recognized him. They all
text: are friends of his and like teasing and playing around
text: with him. Two of them take him, each by the arm and
text: lightly kid with him for an instant, then leads him
text: out to the left. All the while Florine is swashing
text: buckling, taking joy in enacting the role of a cut
dialog: throat.

scene_heading: MED C.V. RED DEATH AND FLORINE
text: As Florine reaches out to touch the Red Death,
text: a skeleton hand shoots out of a crimson sleeve, vio-
text: lently seizes the rash one's wrist and he, feeling
text: furious gasps, cries out in pain and terror and is
text: flung onto the crowd.
scene_heading: MED C.V. IN CROWD
text: As Florine lands on the floor- he picks himself up---
dialog: his dignity has suffered, he will have revenge---
text: he draws his sword and taking off his mask challenges
text: him to come out and fight like a man. He fights the
text: air with his sword...at that instant a man costumed
text: as a jester steps up and taps Florine's shoulder.
text: As Florine turns, the jester takes off his mask re-
text: vealing the funeral face of the Persian, who in a
text: hushed voice of horror indicates "Do you know what
text: this is?" Florine is very sober. He answers "No
text: Sir." The hushed voice tells him:
text: "THAT WAS THE OPERA GHOST!"
text: BACK: Florine stands perfectly still and his eyes
text: widen. Florine gives a low moan and swoons. All is
text: excitement - some run out. The girls fan him with
dialog: their skirts, smelling salts are produced and they
text: try to revive him. Someone enters with a glass of
dialog: water.
text: MED CLOSE UP OF GROUP AND FLORINE AMBER
text: The glass of water is dashed in his face. Florine
text: opens his eyes and shakes his head to shake off the
text: water. He looks around the room. Florine gets to
text: his feet, looks quickly and tears out of the picture
text: down the stairs.
scene_heading: INT GRAND STAIRCASE #1 PRIZMA
text: This is the same shot of the staircase. The crowd
text: is gayer and noisier than before. There is a commotion
text: at the upper left hand entrance to the staircase.
text: An aisle is made and Florine runs in fleeing for his
text: life. When he reaches the turn on the platform, he
text: gets his legs tangled up with his broadsword and he
text: falls, but quickly regains his feet and dashes down
text: the stairs. It is suggested that this scene be not
text: under speed. About 12.
scene_heading: SHOOTING INTO GALLERY ...PRIZMA
text: This is the first opening on the left of the second
text: gallery. There in the gallery all are looking down
text: at the ghost. Raoul, following Christine, passes
text: through from left to right. Christine looks down
text: and sees the ghost, then she clutches at Raoul to
text: keep him from looking down on the staircase. They
text: pass out to the right.
text: SHOOTING INTO GALLERY PRIZMA
text: This is the second opening of the second gallery.
text: The onlookers are motionless looking down over the
text: rail. Raoul and Christine enter from the Left.
text: Raoul's curiosity overcomes Christine's apprehension
text: although she is pulling at his sleeve. Raoul leans over
text: the rail and looks down. Christine is terrified that
text: the Phantom will recognize Raoul with her.
scene_heading: SHOOTING AGAINST THE GRAND STAIR CASE PRIZMA
text: The Red Death has almost reached the foot of the

text: MED CLOSE UP OF RAOUL AND CHRISTINE PRIZMA
text: They are at the rail in the center opening in

text: is fear and excitement. She clutches him by the sleeve
text: and half drags him through the door in the rear which
text: reveals a stairway going upward.
scene_heading: GRAND STAIRCASE #2 PRIZMA
text: The Red Death is looking upward. We now see him
text: creep up the grand staircase, much more rapidly than
text: he came down, the crowd parting before him, making
text: an aisle. When he reaches the landing he turns to
dialog: the left.
scene_heading: SHOOTING REVERSE DOWN UPON GRAND STAIRCASE PRIZMA
text: This shows all eyes looking toward the left staircase.
text: There is a beginning of fluttering relief and relax-
text: ation. Then the crowd begins to mix and the gaiety
text: is resumed.
scene_heading: INT FIRST CORRIDOR AMBER
text: This is an overhead corridor. A flight of stairs in
text: the f£.g. leads from below. In the b.g. is a single
text: staircase leading upward. The entrance to the stair
text: case is a high area, almost into the top of the ceiling
text: so that the camera while taking in the people looks a
text: long distance up the stairs. If a person were coming
dialog: down these stairs, their lower extremities would be
text: seen some time before the full figure. In the f.g.
text: there is a door covered with a portierre. Immediately
text: beyond this portierre is a full sized mirror. There
text: is a door and number of other exits. Raoul and
text: Christine enter from below. She has Raoul by the arm
text: and almost drags him along. Raoul is extrapolating
dialog: with her excitedly - He wants to know what all the
text: mad rushing about is for.
text: Christine has the manner of a hunted person. Hardly

scene_heading: INT ROI DE LAHORE SET. FAINT GREEN
text: Two shadows are seen on the wall where the shadow of
text: Joseph Buquet's figure was seen. It is Raoul and the
text: Persian approaching from the right, holding up their
text: hands. They enter and Raoul follows the Persian to a
text: little cupboard fastened to the wall. The cupboard
text: contains an emergency outfit consisting of a dark
text: lantern, a hatchet, an ax, a saw and a coil of rope.
text: The cupboard door is removed by the Persian who takes
text: the lantern and lights it.
text: MED CLOSE UP OF RAOUL AND THE PERSIAN FAINT GREEN.
text: The mystery is now upon Raoul as it was upon
dialog: Christine. He would like to help but he senses his
text: total helplessness. Raoul drops his hand. The Persian
text: turns on him and tells him in a startled way:
dialog: "YOUR HAND UP! IT IS
text: A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH!"
dialog: Handschiegel
scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT...FAINT GREEN
text: Raoul is puzzled and senses his dependency. He
text: raises his hand. The Persian moves quickly
text: followed by Raoul to a pin rail in the left b.g.
dialog: With some effort the Persian twists one of these
text: large pins. As he does a trap opens in the floor
text: in the identical spot where the body of Joseph
text: Buguet was found. The Persian and Raoul go to the
text: open trap and the Persian flashes on the lantern
text: and indicates for Raoul to hold him by the wrists
text: and drop him - Raoul holds the Persian by the wrists
dialog: and drops him - (This scene will be more effective
dialog: if played in semi-darkness)
text: INT CORRIDOR LOOKING AT BLANK WALL FAINT GREEN
dialog: (This blank wall can be doubled for another location)
text: This source of light here is the Persian's lantern.
text: Couple of counter poise weights are hanging from above.
text: The Persian falls into the scene and lights on
text: his feet. Raoul drops in after him. The Persian pulls
text: the counter-poise weight.
scene_heading: INT ROI DE LAHORE SET FAINT GREEN.
text: This is a flash of the trap closing.
text: INT CORRIDOR LOOKING AT BLANK WALL FAINT GREEN
text: Raoul and Persian exit - guided by the rays from

scene_heading: INT CHRISTINE'S DRESSING ROOM
text: Philippe has smashed the trick mirror revealing
text: the secret passageway behind it - gripping a gun
text: in each hand and with a triumphant smile he steps
text: into the passageway and exits from sight.
scene_heading: INT CELLAR SHOOTING AGAINST BLANK WALL #2 FAINT GREEN
text: Raoul and the Persian enter - They look off and stop
text: -both transfixed with terror - They flatten themselves
text: against the wall as the Persian makes his lantern
text: dark. A fiery face - not more than three feet from
text: the ground approaches, a red handkerchief -
dialog: Process - is around the neck giving the impression
text: that it is a decapitated head. When the terrible
text: face reaches a point opposite Raoul and the Persian
text: it cries out at them:
dialog: "DON'T MOVE...WHATEVER YOU DO...
dialog: I'M THE RAT CATCHER. LET ME PASS
dialog: WITH MY RATS."
text: BACK: The face exits. The light upon the face is
text: caused by a dark lantern which the rat catcher holds
text: turned upon himself. The Persian turns on his lantern
text: and he and Raoul exit, looking back with terrified
text: eyes, their right hands up in the air.
scene_heading: MED CLOSE UP ERICK (FULL FIGURE) AND CHRISTINE
text: Erick stands upon the steps back of the couch - folds
text: his arms - towers over her and addresses her:
dialog: "YOU MUST NOW MAKE YOUR CHOICE!
text: ...THE WEDDING MASS OR THE REQUIEM
dialog: MASS?"
text: BACK: Christine breaks into tears, repeating, "No!
text: No! No!" Her tears touch Erick. He cannot stand them.
text: Erick leaves the steps and goes to the other side of
text: side of the couch.
scene_heading: ANOTHER MEDIUM CLOSE UP ERICK AND CHRISTINE. AMBER
text: Erick kneels and appeals to her:
dialog: "DON'T CRY...IT GIVES ME PAIN!
text: BACK: This causes Christine to cry all the more-
text: bitterly - then he tells her in a pathetic reasoning
dialog: way:
text: "I WANT TO HAVE A WIFE LIKE EVERYBODY
text: ELSE AND TAKE HER OUT ON SUNDAYS."
text: BACK: Christine cowers away from him like a broken
text: spirited animal as far away as the couch will allow.
text: His mood changes again - he rises in a rage - He is
text: infuriated at himself and his position.
scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT...AMBER:
text: He beats his chest and cries at her:
text: "I AM SICK AND TIRED OP LIVING
text: LIKE A MOUNTEBANK IN A HOUSE
text: WITH A FALSE BOTTOM."
text: BACK: Erick continues to violently bemoan his
text: fate and threaten Christine.
scene_heading: INT LAST CELLAR FAINT GREEN
text: This is a low massive chamber. It is almost at the
text: bottom of the opera foundations, leading from it is
text: a long narrow corridor, wide enough only for two
text: men to walk abreast. This first shot does not reveal
text: the narrow corridor. Raoul and the Persian enter.
text: The Persian stops and listens. Raoul tiredly lets
text: down his right hand. In a startled way, the Persian
text: grabs Raoul's wrist and raises his right arm for
text: him, with a certain horror in his look.
text: "KEEP YOUR HANDS UP! THIS IS THE ONLY
text: WAY TO THROW OFF THE STRANGLER'S LASSO."
text: BACK: Raoul is henceforth careful to keep his hand
text: raised. They exit. The Persian with increased caution.
scene_heading: ANOTHER SHOT...REVEALING NARROW CORRIDOR FAINT GREEN
text: Raoul and Persian enter - The Persian again stops
text: and listens - Then he whispers to Raoul.
text: "WE ARE NEAR HIS HOUSE NOW."
text: BACK: The Persian cautions Raoul to move quietly.
text: They reach a point just inside the corridor.
dialog: Without any anticipation a trap gives under their
text: feet and they shoot downwards out of the picture.
text: The picture is held on an instant and the trap closed.
scene_heading: INT TORTURE CHAMBER. ...FAINT GREEN
text: The source of light is the Persian's lantern.
text: In relation to Erick's living room this chamber is
text: to the left. It is a six-cornered room, the sides
text: of which are covered with mirrors from top to
text: bottom. The chamber is very high and the ceiling
text: never seen. In one corner is an iron tree with
text: an iron branch. Upon the branch is hanging a
text: strangler's lasso. The multiple reflections of the
text: tree gives the effect of a forest, in the mirrors.
text: Out of reach of anyone is the torture chamber and
text: out of the picture in the right top wall is an
text: aperture opening into Erick's living room, an opening
text: through which a person in the living room can see into
text: the torture chamber. Ben Carre is working out the
dialog: details of this chamber.
text: There is no effect of a reflected forest until
text: Erick turns on the overhead lights. The dark lantern
dialog: would not cause those multiple reflections. The
text: Persian gets to his feet, turns lantern to
text: mirrors and feels them. Then examines iron tree and
text: lasso - turns to Raoul, recovering from fall and says:
text: "WE HAVE DROPPED INTO ONE OF THE
text: TORTURE CHAMBERS OF THE OLD COMMUNE.
text: IF ERICK DISCOVERS US, MAY GOD HAVE
dialog: MERCY ON OUR SOULS!"
text: BACK: Raoul's reaction is horror. Suddenly both men
text: are startled and look up and to the right. They
text: hear Erick's voice. Raoul is thrown into great
text: terror and opens his mouth to cry out but the Persian
text: grabs Raoul and puts his hand over Raoul's mouth.
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S LIVING ROOM...AMBER C.V. CHRISTINE
text: standing upon second step of stair at back of couch
text: leading to the screen which connects with torture
text: chamber. This screen is concealed by a drape. It is
text: of heavy material closely woven from wire and
text: locked with a fancy weird sort of padlock. Erick is
text: standing below Christine, Erick is making love to
text: her, in his way, and Christine is flattened against
text: the wall crying hysterically.
text: Erick is not touching her but close to and below
dialog: her he tells her:
text: "YOU SHALL BE THE HAPPIEST OF
text: WOMEN WE WILL SING BY OURSELVES
text: UNTIL WE SWOON WITH DELIGHT."
dialog: 
text: BACK: Christine shrinks from him, shrinks away
text: from the idea, then she runs down the steps.
scene_heading: ANOTHER SHOT AMBER
text: Christine runs to a position before the center
text: pillar and sobbing, hides her face against the pillar.
text: Erick goes to her dejectedly and appeals to her.
dialog: "ALL THAT I HAVE WANTED WAS TO
text: BE LOVED FOR MYSELF."
scene_heading: CLOSE UP CHRISTINE ... AMBER

scene_heading: CLOSE UP RAOUL AND THE PERSIAN
text: Raoul is in agony and struggles with the Persian
text: who tries to get it over to him that it will mean his
dialog: death if their presence becomes known. The Persian
text: now begins to feel the walls for the hidden spring
dialog: that will release them.
scene_heading: INT. ERICK'S LIVING ROOM ...AMBER...MED. CLOSE UP
scene_heading: OF ERICK AND CHRISTINE
text: Christine looks up terribly startled at a resounding
text: clang. Erick too is startled into a dramatic tension.
scene_heading: CLOSE OF QUEER SOUNDING DEVICE...AMBER
text: This is a weird, oriental, beautifully tooled
dialog: affair. There are three bars such as are used in
text: chimes. An arm about 18 inches long systematically
text: strikes the chimes - all three at once. This
text: sounding device is placed in a prominent place in
text: the room and continues striking regularly through
text: the next number of scenes. This is for the dramatic
text: affect of its stopping at the proper moment.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP CHRISTINE AND ERICK. AMBER
text: Erick, realizes that opposition is now at hand and
text: a satanic smile overspreads his horrible face,
text: mockingly he tells Christine:
text: "SOMEBODY IS RINGING! WE
dialog: HAVE CALLERS!"
text: BACK: Christine's first reaction is one of relief.
text: Help is at hand. Then almost instantly she is
text: thrown into anguish. Her lips form the name "Raoul"
text: Erick studies her for an instant and then moves out.
dialog: swiftly.
scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT...AMBER
text: The arm is rhythmically falling upon the chime.
text: Erick moves to a beautiful throw hanging over the
text: back of a chair, sweeps it off. Swiftly he begins
text: to bind Christine to the center pillar.
scene_heading: MED CLOSE UP ERICK AND CHRISTINE...AMBER
text: She offers no resistance. The throw passes around
text: Christine's waist and is tied on the side of the pillar
text: opposite Christine. Erick tells her hurriedly:
dialog: "FORGIVE ME...THIS IS TO SAVE YOU
dialog: FROM HARMING YOURSELF."
scene_heading: A LONG SHOT. AMBER
text: The chimes are sounding. Erick now sweeps from the
text: room, leaving by the door which leads to the lake.
text: He closes the door.
text: LAKE SET LOOKING FROM ERICK'S ROOM FAINT GREEN
text: The boat is discovered here. Erick enters from
text: his drawing room. From a rack he takes up a metal
text: tube, the shape of a reed, about four feet long
text: and less than half an inch in diameter. Erick
text: puts one end of this tube in his mouth and swiftly
text: walks down into the water. As he walks he goes down
text: and down until his head disappears and only the
text: ripple caused by the end of the gliding reed is
text: seen. This ripple moves away with remarkable swiftness.
scene_heading: THE FIRST LAKE SET...FAINT GREEN
text: Philippe is standing at the boat landing. He has
text: found the way to the lake. He holds his lantern up
text: and peers out into the darkness. Philippe is stand-
dialog: ing upon the board which has a connection with the
text: chimes.
scene_heading: INT TORTURE CHAMBER...FAINT GREEN
text: Raoul and the Persian are listening to make sure
text: that Erick has gone, then, before the Persian can
dialog: stop him, Raoul cries out "Christine! Christine!
dialog: It is I, Raoul!"
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S LIVING ROOM...AMBER
text: CLOSE UP CHRISTINE LASHED TO THE CENTER PILLAR
text: Christine hears Raoul's agonized cry, answers it
text: and gives away to fear for Raoul.
scene_heading: INT TORTURE CHAMBER...FAINT GREEN.
text: Raoul is crying out - wild inarticulate things
text: to Christine - The Persian grasps him by the
text: wrist and sternly indicates for him to keep
text: quiet. The Persian addresses himself toward
text: the overhead window:
text: "WE ARE IN THE TORTURE CHAMBER.
text: THE DOOR IS IN THE WALL FROM WHICH
scene_heading: OUR VOICES COME."
scene_heading: INT RICK'S LIVING ROOM...AMBER
text: A shot of Christine taking in the drape at the
text: head of the little stairs behind the couch.
text: Christine hears this title and fires her gaze
text: upon the drape. She cries out that she is bound
text: and begins to struggle with her bonds.
scene_heading: INT THE FIRST LAKE SET...FAINT GREEN
text: This is medium closeup of Philippe at the boat landing.
text: Philippe is kneeling, holding up the lantern, peering
text: into the darkness. He shouts Raoul's name. Unseen by
text: Philippe and directly in front of him there is a dis-
text: turbance in the water. The reed-like tube glides in
text: making a V-shaped line of ripples. Then Erick's
text: long arm shoots out of the water and grasps Philippe's
text: wrist of the hand that holds the lantern, and the
text: scene is plunged into darkness.
scene_heading: INT. ERICK'S LIVING ROOM...MED CU CHRISTINE
text: She has worked around to the rear of the pillar within
text: reach of the knot. She unloosens the knot
text: sufficiently to allow her to slip under the throw
text: which has held her prisoner.
speaker_heading: LONGER SHOT AMBER
text: Christine flies across the room and runs up the few
text: steps to the door to the torture chamber.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP CHRISTINE BEFORE DOOR...AMBER
text: Christine parts the drapes and tries to look
text: through the heavy mesh, but evidently can see
text: nothing. She shakes the door and registers that it
text: is locked. She cries out in distress to the men in
text: the torture chamber that the door is locked.
scene_heading: INT. TORTURE CHAMBER FAINT GREEN
text: The Persian is listening to Christine intently.
text: At the same time he is forcing Raoul to be quiet.
dialog: The Persian tells Christine:
text: "THE KEYS ARE IN A CHAMOIS BAG HANGING
scene_heading: NEAR THE ENTRANCE DOOR."
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S LIVING ROOM AMBER
text: This is a shot taking in the entrance door.
text: Christine is before the door to the torture chamber,
text: and the sounding device rhythmically beating. Christine
text: runs down the steps and approaches the entrance door,
dialog: looking for the chamois bag. This bag is not in plain
text: view, so that she cannot locate it at a glance.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP SOUNDING DEVICE. AMBER
text: It continues to strike twice and stops.
text: A LONGER SHOT AMBER.
text: Christine is looking at the sounding device.
text: With dread anticipation she senses that Erick
text: is returning. She flies back to the center
text: pillar and slips under the throw. She is now
text: apparently in the position that Erick left her.
text: From this moment Christine begins to act a
text: double role. She is now matching her wits against
dialog: Erick's...Above all things she must keep Raoul's
text: presence in the torture chamber from Erick.
text: The entrance door opens and Erick enters
text: dripping wet. He closes the door goes to
text: Christine and tells her sardonically:
dialog: Christine's
text: "MY DEAR. IT IS RAINING CATS
text: AND DOGS OUTSIDE."
scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT AMBER
text: Christine is looking at the sounding device
text: with dread anticipation - it is still. Her fear
text: is just as apparent as her pretense. She does not
text: fail to notice his wet clothes and the mystery
text: behind his absence. Erick now drops his sardonic
text: mood which caused the last title. As he releases her
dialog: he tells her:
text: "COME I WILL PLAY YOU OUR WEDDING MASS.
dialog: YOU CAN TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, IT IS MAG*
scene_heading: NIFICENT."
text: BACK: From this point, Erick seems to forget
text: presence, so absorbed is he in his new purpose. Erick
text: turns away from her toward the organ and Christine
text: registers her involved complexity, fear that Erick
text: may discover her intention, eagerness to possess the
text: chamois bag.
text: A LONGER SHOT AMBER.
text: Erick sits down at the organ and begins to play
text: seeming almost wholly to have forgotten Christine.
text: She works her way toward the entrance door and
text: when Erick does glance her way, she pauses and
text: pretends that she is listening.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP CHRISTINE AT ENTRANCE DOOR AMBER
text: Christine discovers the chamois bag partly concealed
text: behind a drape, up in a little recess. She is at
text: a high tension, she gives Erick a frightened look,
text: then snatches the little bag from its hiding place.
text: Instantly she looks back at Erick in terror.
speaker_heading: A LONG SHOT AMBER
text: Erick has stopped playing and is looking at Christine
text: in an attitude of alarm. He rises and swiftly strides
text: to her. In an hysterical way she tries to conceal the
dialog: bag.
scene_heading: MED CLOSE UP CHRISTINE & ERICK
text: He cries at her in anger:
text: "WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH MY BAG? DON'T
text: YOU KNOW THAT IS THE BAG OF LIFE AND
dialog: DEATH!"
text: BACK: Erick forces the bag away from her and she
text: gives a cry of dismay.
scene_heading: INT TORTURE CHAMBER FAINT GREEN
text: Raoul and the Persian are listening at a great tension.
text: Raoul gives an unexpected cry of rage - This startles
text: the Persian, who indicates with certain horror,
dialog: "He has heard you!"
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S LIVING ROOM AMBER
scene_heading: MED CLOSE UP ERICK AND CHRISTINE
text: Erick is listening. He has heard Raoul's cry of rage.
text: He now understands why Christine wanted the keys.
dialog: He also knows that only for Raoul would Christine
text: do as she has. From this moment Erick becomes cruel
text: and Christine combats him on the verge of hysterics.
text: He asks her in a quiet but very dangerous manner:
dialog: "DID YOU HEAR, CHRISTINE?
text: BACK: "No" she cries "no, I heard nothing."
text: Erick tells her quietly but pointedly:
dialog: "YOU ARE LYING."
speaker_heading: A LONGER SHOT
text: Erick moves swiftly up the few steps to the screened
dialog: opening.
scene_heading: MED CLOSE UP ERICK AMBER
text: He brushes aside the drapery and discloses the window.
text: But he does not so much as look thru it. The screen
text: is set back somewhat and there is an open space between
text: the screen and the wall of the room. Erick puts his
text: hand out of sight in this opening and turns something.
scene_heading: INT TORTURE CHAMBER FAINT GREEN
text: From semi-darkness the chamber is flooded with
text: a brilliant, dazzling light from overhead.
text: Under the overhead light the single iron tree
text: is multiplied into thousands of trees, into a
text: forest. Raoul's reaction is astonishment, be-
text: wilderment, the Persian's horror - for he knows
text: what this means. The torture has begun. The
text: sudden flood of brilliant light causes them to blink.
text: Then Raoul tries to hide his eyes from the brilliant,
text: blinding light. The Persian now realizes the necessity
dialog: of searching for the secret spring which he knows
text: to be in the floor. Excitedly he begins to feel over
text: the floor with the tips of his fingers, to feel the
text: joints in the glass. Raoul watches him in excited
text: bewilderment. This is a short scene.
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S ROOM AMBER
text: Erick is now coming down the steps leading to the
text: screened opening. Christine senses that Erick
text: has put into effect some of his cruel mechanisms.
text: She is becoming frantic in her attempt to carry
text: on her acting. Her composure is palpably nervous
text: and forced. Erick pantomimes for her to go up
text: and look thru the screen. She moves mechanically
text: up the steps. Her attitude is entirely false to him.
text: In a mechanical way she parts the drapes concealing
text: the opening. A strong light is apparent back of
dialog: screen.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP CHRISTINE AMBER
text: She peers through the screen. There is just the
text: slightest fleeting tremor about her eyes. She
text: turns to him with poorly affected surprise and
dialog: tells him:
text: "WHY...THERE IS NO ONE THERE!"
scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT AMBER
text: Christine comes down the steps, trying to affect
text: an air of being nonchalant. Erick steps up to her
text: and takes her by the wrist, asking her:
text: "NOT EVEN THE LITTLE CHAP YOU
text: WERE GOING TO RUN AWAY WITH?"
text: MED CLOSE UP ERICK AND CHRISTINE AMBER.
text: He holds her with his hollow eye. The terrible
text: realization comes over her that Erick knows that
text: Raoul is in the torture Chamber. In a helpless
text: automatic way, knows that he knows she is lying.
text: She repeats "No! No! Nobody is there!"
scene_heading: INT. TORTURE CHAMBER AMBER
text: The heat in the chamber has now become intense.
text: Both men are perspiring profusely. Excitement
text: approaching panic is overtaking the Persian
text: as he continues his search for the secret spring.
text: They are mopping their faces with their handker-
text: chiefs. Raoul tears off his collar and flings it
text: from him. He wants air. He begins to beat at
text: the mirrors with his fists and the Persian shows
text: his apprehension for Raoul. He tries to quiet
dialog: Raoul.
scene_heading: INT GRAND STAIRCASE #2 AMBER
text: The audience with hats and wraps is leaving the
text: theatre. The grand staircase is filled and the
text: general tone is one of lightness and gaiety.
scene_heading: EXT IN PARIS STREET BLUE
text: (In this scene begins the gathering of the mob, it
dialog: must not have the appearance of an open revolt against
dialog: constituted authority. It is rather the quiet myster-
text: ious gathering of about five hundred men, under the
text: very eyes of the police. Until they begin rushing
dialog: wild in the opera, they must do everything to con-
dialog: ceal their designs from the police. Mob psychology
dialog: is only suggested here and allowed to grow to
dialog: dramatic proportions later.)
text: This is a general view of the street. The streets
text: are wet. It has just stopped raining. The streets
text: glisten from the lights reflected on the pavement.
text: Only about half the mob is shown here. The men are
text: gathering in small groups, not more than ten in a
text: group. The groups are so placed as to be near exits
text: for a sudden disappearance effect. A nervous buzz
text: of suppressed excitement prevails. The center of
text: the scene is a dark doorway around which the largest
text: group is gathered. Beside the door is a flight of
text: steps leading down into a dark cellar. Standing
text: beside this door is Simon with Florine. Mysterious
text: packages (torches) the contents of which are not shown
text: to the audience, are passed out of the doorway and
text: instantly secreted under the coats of the receivers.
text: The mysterious packages are being distributed among
text: the other groups, and in each case are instantly
text: secreted.
scene_heading: MED CLOSE UP CENTER GROUP BLUE
text: A fanatical fire shines from Simon's eyes, as he
dialog: directs the distribution of the mysterious packages
text: The packages are passed out of the doorway. Florine's
text: attention is concentrated upon a deaf man. He is

scene_heading: ANOTHER SHOT BLUE
text: This is shooting down the street upon the mob.
text: In the £.g. is a cross-road. One of the mob is
text: picketed on the corner to keep an eye out for
text: the police. A gendarme approaches upon the cross
dialog: street. He will not be in a position to catch
text: sight of the mob until he reaches the corner.
text: The picket spots him.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP FLASH OF PICKET BLUE
text: He puts two fingers in his mouth and whistles
text: a warning signal.
scene_heading: MED CLOSE UP CENTRAL GROUP BLUE
text: Simon and the others, except Florine, who is
text: yelling at the deaf man, get the signal.
text: SHOOTING DOWN STREET TOWARD CROSS ROAD BLUE
text: The mob melts and disappears - vanishes. The
text: door through which the packages were being passed
text: closes. This leaves Florine alone yelling at the
text: deaf man. The deaf man sees and he too disappears.
text: Florine looks around and finds himself all alone.
text: He runs down into the cellar just as the gendarme
text: rounds the corner and takes a diagonal course
text: across the street. Florine fairly bounces, flies
text: out of the cellar. The idea is that he has been
text: confronted by something terrible in the
text: cellars - just as rapidly as he comes out. The
text: gendarme, however, does not see him and exits. The
text: door opens, Simon enters and the mob reappears, just
text: as rapidly as it faded away. Florine enters
text: from the cellar, sort of creeping up backwards
text: looking into the dark hole with fright. Simon gives
text: an order to move. He conceals a package and gives it
text: to Florine. Florine's package sticks up about a
text: foot back of his head in plain sight. The mob moves.
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S DRAWING ROOM AMBER
dialog: Christine is in the position now that one false
dialog: step will cause Raoul's death. If Erick makes love
dialog: to her she cannot tell him flatly "No"
dialog: Therefore she continues her acting, depending upon
text: evasions. At the same time she is in trembling
dialog: and fear for Raoul. What is being done to him?
text: Erick is frenzied and insistent. Christine is hard
text: pressed. He follows her into a corner and is telling
text: her with frenzied pain:
text: "I WILL KILL EVERYBODY AND MYSELF
dialog: IF YOU DO NOT CONSENT TO BECOME
dialog: MY WIFE."
scene_heading: MED CLOSE UP CHRISTINE AND ERICK AMBER
dialog: Christine pleads with him, "Don't talk like
text: that." Then she runs her hand across her

text: "IT'S VERY HOT IN HERE."
text: BACK: Erick laughs wildly - he knows why it is so
dialog: very hot.
scene_heading: INT TORTURE CHAMBER AMBER
text: The two men are undergoing terrible torture.
text: They are almost burning up. Their coats are off
text: and their shirts have been torn open at the neck.
text: They are drenched with perspiration. Raoul is be-
text: coming delirious. The Persian himself almost crazy
text: and is mechanically searching for the secret
dialog: spring. If the forest from the reflected iron
dialog: trap is seen here, it is just as it was when first
text: seen. A terrible hallucination begins to overtake
text: Raoul and with startling eyes he begins to crawl
text: away from the section of mirrors into which he is
dialog: looking.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP RAOUL AMBER
text: With an expression of utmost fear and terror he
text: shrinks away - he cringes away from the terrifying
text: product of his delirium.
text: SHOOTING INTO MIRRORS’ RED.
dialog: The reflected forest has assumed the aspect of
text: a real tropical forest. A forest fire is raging
text: and is being blown by a strong wind which is
dialog: driving the animals of the forest about it, lions
dialog: and tigers and any other animals that are available.
scene_heading: CLOSE LION...RED
text: It leaps up to the immediate f.g. and roars, as if

scene_heading: CLOSE UP RAOUL AMBER
text: He gives a cry of terror and of fear, as if his

scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT AMBER
text: The Persian is startled at this cry and his eye
text: follows the direction of Raoul's eyes. But the
text: forest is just as it was before, a reflection of the
text: single iron tree.
scene_heading: INT. ERICK'S LIVING ROOM AMBER
text: Christine is frantic. She is listening to Raoul's
text: agonized cries. She is beside herself. She moans
text: and clutches at his cloak, crying, "What are you

scene_heading: INT TORTURE CHAMBER AMBER
text: The Persian is fighting to keep away the delirium.

text: His face lights up wildly - there is hope - "Water?
dialog: Water! Water!"
text: SHOOTING INTO SECTION OF MIRROR AMBER.
text: The scene is changed to a beautiful cool water fall
text: in a shady forest. The water falls into a shady pool
text: then runs between grassy banks to the very floor of
text: the torture chamber. Raoul crawls into the picture.
text: He bends over thirstily and just before he reaches
text: the Water, within six inches of the water, he is
text: stopped by the glass. He puts his hand to his throat
text: and begins to choke.
scene_heading: EXT. REAR OF OPERA BLUE
text: (The pavement and sidewalk are still glistening
dialog: wet - for effect)
text: This is at the stage entrance. The action here is
text: rapid and an atmosphere of silence prevails. Simon
text: cautions everyone to be quiet and not to talk. The
text: traveling barouche is the only vehicle in evidence.
text: The mob has finished gathering here, now five hund-
text: dred strong. They are still in groups, still con-
text: cealing the mysterious packages under their coats.
scene_heading: MED CLOSE GROUP AROUND STAGE DOOR’ BLUE
text: Simon, at a high pitch of excitement, is ringing
text: the night bell. Florine is standing nearby with the
text: cealed packages sticking up under the back of his coat
text: It is evident that all in the picture are concealing
text: something. The door is opened from the inside by a
text: night watchman carrying a lantern. He is startled by
text: the crowd before him, startled by their mysterious
text: menacing faces. Simon gives the word and although the
text: night watchman tries to close the door, the mob sweeps
text: past him carrying him along with them.
scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT BLUE
text: The mob swarming into the stage door - a general
dialog: movement.
scene_heading: INT ON BACKSTAGE AMBER
text: The curtain is up upon an empty stage. A few dim
text: work lights are burning. About thirty men run in
text: and all begin lighting torches, which throw a spec-
text: tral glow over the stage. The torches light almost
text: all together with a big flare.
scene_heading: INT FIRST CELLAR AMBER
text: The mob, led by Simon - Florine in evidence - all
text: carrying lighted torches - pour down the stairs from
text: the dressing room corridor. Some men run away from
text: the camera through the arches, others into the left
text: hall exit.
dialog: Everything that can be used as a weapon, fireman's
text: axes, clubs, etc., is picked up and carried along.
text: Simon and Florine are temporarily left in this set.
text: Simon is the general, giving excited directions,
text: and Florine, too, is frightened and officious.
scene_heading: INT AUDITORIUM AMBER
text: This is a long shot shooting toward the stage.
text: In the distance the stage is filled with men
text: with torches, all moving - some in this direction,
text: some in that. A glow is thrown over the empty seats.
text: Suddenly six or eight torches and the arms that are
text: holding them sweep into the f.g.
scene_heading: INT GRAND STAIRCASE #4 AMBER
text: The staircase is illuminated and empty, save for about
text: four scrub women who are washing it down, the mob
text: who - some of them have lights, torches, others not,
text: flood in first from below and then from above. They
text: circulate, excitedly and aimlessly. In the melee the
text: scrub water is turned over and runs down the staircase.
scene_heading: INT GRAND STAIRCASE #2 AMBER
text: This shows the mob in the balconies - as well as on
dialog: the staircase.
scene_heading: INT BOX FIVE AMBER
text: This is a safety scene. Four or five of the mob are
text: discovered exploring the box with torches. Others
text: are in the ante-room. One man lifts a rug - another
text: begins to tap the big pillar with a small iron bar.
text: He suddenly cries out that it is hollow. He taps it
text: and all listen to the hollow sound. One man with a
text: fireman's ax ruthlessly pries at a square ornament
text: on the pillar. The ornament gives way - revealing
text: a passageway down thru the pillar. They peer down.
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S LIVING ROOM AMBER
text: Erick is still in the midst of his terrible scene with
text: Christine. He is thundering at her. "Tell me that you
text: love me!" Christine is groggy - she has the intention
dialog: of telling Erick, "Take me!" but her emotions have
text: exhausted her. She is almost out of her mind. Her
text: eyes are wild and she sways groggily, staggers to the
text: couch and sinks down upon it. Erick bends over her
text: in an ecstasy. He bends within a short distance of
text: her white face and tells her: "You are as beautiful
text: as if you were dead!" Erick continues along the
dialog: same line.
scene_heading: INT TORTURE GARDEN AMBER
text: Raoul is lying upon the floor, panting, exhausted,
text: crazed. The Persian, who himself is beginning to
text: grow wild, is feeling aimlessly about the floor for
text: the hidden spring. His finger touches something
text: that gives, a nail head, which slightly protrudes
text: above the floor...which responds to his touch.
text: In his semi-delirium, he cries out in exultation.
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S LIVING ROOM AMBER
text: A shot including screened opening. Erick is bending
text: over Christine declaiming, bemoaning her beauty.
text: This scene is instantly broken when Erick hears the
text: Persian's cry of exultation. He is thrown out of his
text: wild ecstatic mood and moves swiftly up the steps,
text: draws back the drape and looks through the screened
dialog: opening.
scene_heading: INT TORTURE CHAMBER AMBER
text: The Persian is crying out in mad exultation that he
text: has found it. - But Raoul is too far gone to hear him.
text: The Persian takes the nail head between his fingers
text: and pulls it up about an inch. There is an instant
text: of suspense in which nothing transpires. Then a
text: section of the floor about three by five, falls about
text: two inches. -then slides away horizontally, and
text: reveals a wooden stair leading downward. The Persian
text: inhales the cool air from below, then drags Raoul to
text: the opening. Raoul drinks of the cool air as if water.
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S LIVING ROOM ERICK LOOKING THRU OPENING
text: He is not the least perturbed. He is amused.
scene_heading: INT CELLAR #2 AMBER
text: This is the dummy set. The mob, led by Simon, are
text: waving torches and exploring, pulling down dummies
text: and exploring dark recesses. This is sort of a pro-
text: perty room and members of the mob pick up spears,
text: bludgeons, and executioner's axes, which they brand-
text: ish. Mob psychology is beginning to manifest itself.
text: The men stab the dummies with their spears, while
text: Florine is active in giving directions. He is afraid
text: and like a child keeps near and clings to Simon. In
dialog: the scenes to follow he always manages to keep be-
text: tween two strong men with bludgeons and spears.
dialog: (These cellar scenes may be cut in at will, may be
dialog: used as flashes or in whole.)
scene_heading: INT CELLAR #3 AMBER
text: This is the dragon set. The mob sweeps in led by
dialog: Simon, and again all stage properties in the nature
dialog: of weapons are appropriated. It will be especially
dialog: good if there are lots of spears. In passing the
text: dragon Florine clings very closely to Simon. There
dialog: is a reason for not having Florine point out here
text: what he sees in the dragon's mouth.
scene_heading: INT CELLAR #4 AMBER
text: This is the headless statue set. The mob, led by
text: Simon sweeps in, appropriates any properties that
text: are valuable and pass out down the stairs leading to
text: the Roi de Lahore set. Florine is especially fearful
dialog: of going down these stairs.
scene_heading: INT CELLAR BRIDGE SET AMBER
dialog: room.
text: Another portion of the mob, in which Simon and Florine
text: are absent, passes over the bridge, while others
text: with torches, run over the bridge.
scene_heading: INT TORTURE CHAMBER AMBER
text: The cool air has revived Raoul and his senses have
text: returned to him. The Persian holds his dark lantern
text: in his hand and is urging Raoul to follow him down-
text: ward. They exit down the steps. The steps leading
text: downward go off in the direction of Erick's living
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S LIVING ROOM AMBER
text: CLOSE UP ERICK LOOKING THROUGH SCREEN
text: He laughs like a demon - lending to the suggestion
dialog: that what he has now prepared for them is worse than
dialog: the torture chamber.
scene_heading: INT BOTTOM CELLAR FAINT GREEN
text: The source of light is from the torture chamber.
text: The location of cellar is directly under Erick's
text: living room. A set of wooden steps lead up to
text: a trap opening in the floor of the living room.
text: This is a very low cellar and enough barrels of
text: all sizes are stacked about to give the appearance
text: of a big wine cellar. The ceiling of this cellar
text: is necessary for the action. The Persian, carrying
text: his dark lantern, and Raoul enter down the stairway
text: leading from the torture chamber. They are looking
text: back apprehensively because a grating of heavy
text: bars descends behind them, cutting off their retreat
dialog: to the torture chamber, and by no action of their
dialog: own, While they are most dying of thirst, they
text: still are mystified at the great number of barrels.
text: They run to the barrels and each kneels at the one
text: he has chosen. They kneel and begin to pull at
text: the bungs, long enough to take hold of and pull out.
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S LIVING ROOM AMBER
text: Erick is in the act of sweeping down the steps from
text: the screened opening. In a sardonic, demoniacal manner
text: he begins to sing:
text: "BARRELS! BARRELS! ANY BARRELS TO SELL?"
text: BACK: This singing revives Christine - she gathers her
text: scattered senses, and shrinks from Erick as if he
text: were crazy. He strides up and down the room singing
text: his strange song.
scene_heading: INT BOTTOM CELLAR FAINT GREEN
scene_heading: MED C.V. RAOUL & PERSIAN
text: This strange song coming directly from above their
text: heads diverts their attention for an instant. They
text: look upward with new dread then back to the bungs.
scene_heading: C.V. RAOUL KNEELING BEFORE BARREL FAINT GREEN
text: Raoul pulls the bung, cups his hands to catch the
text: precious water, but instead of a fluid running into
text: his hands, it is filled with something that looks
text: like black sand. Raoul looks at it stupidly as it
text: runs through his fingers.
scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT FAINT GREEN
text: The Persian pulls the bung stopper of his barrel
text: and the same black powder flows into his hand. He
text: looks at the material in horror, empties it out of
text: his hand and removes the lantern to a safe distance.
text: He then tells Raoul with dread:
dialog: "IT IS GUNPOWDER!"
text: BACK: Raoul is bewildered but the Persian flies into
dialog: action.
scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT FAINT GREEN
text: The Persian runs around the cellar experimenting
text: and examining it with his dark lantern. He is
text: followed by Raoul. They pause at the steps which
text: lead to Erick's voice above. They then go up the
text: steps as far as they can go and listen.
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S LIVING ROOM AMBER
text: Erick is striding down the room toward the camera
text: singing in his demoniacal manner, "Barrels, Barrels
dialog: Any Barrels to sell?" Christine has risen from the
text: couch and is crouching against the wall. She believes
text: Erick has turned maniac. Erick stops singing, turns
text: and takes a step toward her. There is a lightning
text: transition in his manner. Pointing at her, he hurls
dialog: the final threat:
text: "SHALL YOU BE ERICK'S BRIDE OR NOT?"
text: BACK: He strides over to her without waiting for her.
scene_heading: MED CLOSE UP ERICK AND CHRISTINE AMBER
text: Erick is becoming rapidly carried away by his own
text: weird madness. Still without waiting for a reply
text: from Christine he pantomimes something being blown
dialog: up and continues:
text: "IF NOT, EVERYBODY WILL BE DEAD AND BURIED
text: BENEATH THE RUINS OF THE PARIS GRAND
speaker_heading: OPERA."
scene_heading: INT BOTTOM CELLAR FAINT GREEN CLOSE UP RAOUL & PERSIAN
text: Their lantern is upon the highest step. The two
text: men are listening, their ears are close against the
text: trap. They turn horrified eyes to each other. They
dialog: understand that Erick will ignite the tons of
dialog: gunpowder.
speaker_heading: INT ERICK'S
text: Erick continues in his mad wild ecstasy. Without
text: waiting for Christine's reply - he grabs her by the
text: wrist and drags her across the room to a Spanish
text: chest on the left.
scene_heading: MED CLOSE UP ERICK AND CHRISTINE AMBER
text: From his chamois bag he takes a key and unlocks
text: the chest. He opens the chest revealing the
dialog: following contrivance:
text: Upon a piece of plate glass are two objects - a grass
text: hopper and a scorpion, both made of Japanese bronze.
text: From each of these objects a rod runs downward out
text: of sight. Coming up thru the glass is a liquid, watery
text: light effect. Coming up thru the glass is light.
text: Christine feels an unaccountable dread at the sight
text: of the little bronze objects. Erick tells her:
text: "IF YOU TURN THE SCORPION AROUND
dialog: IT WILL MEAN THAT YOU HAVE SAID 'YES'
text: THE GRASSHOPPER WILL MEAN 'NO'!"
dialog: effect
speaker_heading: LONGER SHOT AMBER
text: Erick turns and walks wildly and rapidly toward
text: the music room. Upon the steps leading to this
text: room, he turns upon Christine and in a demoniacal
dialog: manner tells her:
text: "BE CAREFUL OF THE GRASSHOPPER.
text: IT HOPS...AND IT HOPS JOLLY HIGH"
text: BACK: With this he swings into the music room, sits
text: down at the organ and begins to play wildly,
text: a skeleton gone mad. Christine stands in terror,
text: fascinated by the scorpion and the grasshopper.
scene_heading: INT CELLAR #5 AMBER
text: This is Roi de Lahore set. The mob is sweeping
text: down the circular staircase. Florine very much
text: frightened - is talking, telling where the body
text: of Buquet was hanging and where he saw the move-
text: ment in the dark opening - some of the mob runs
text: out toward the spot of the hanging while others
text: begin to break down the door in the dark opening.
text: Simon herds the men out toward the camera. These
text: cellar scenes are wild and rapid and are not held
dialog: up by individuals, closeups, business, so that the
text: will be the that of the menace sweeping downward like a
dialog: great wave.
scene_heading: CLOSE VIEW CHRISTINE BENDING OVER CABINET
text: She puts her hand toward one - then the other. Which
dialog: shall it be, the scorpion or the grasshopper? Which
text: of these will mean life and which death. She sways.
scene_heading: INT BOTTOM CELLAR FAINT GREEN RAOUL & PERSIAN
text: Raoul hears her calling him, senses her agony, pounds
text: at the trap and cries: “Christine! Christine!"
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S DRAWING ROOM AMBER
text: This is a long shot showing Erick playing madly upon
text: the organ and Christine struggling with herself.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP CHRISTINE AMBER.
dialog: in
text: Almost out of her head, Christine places her fingers
text: upon the scorpion.
scene_heading: INT BOTTOM CELLAR FAINT GREEN
scene_heading: CLOSE UP RAOUL AND THE PERSIAN UNDER TRAP
text: A new thought suddenly forces itself upon the
text: Persian and he cries upward with great force:
text: "DON'T TOUCH THE SCORPION!"
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S DRAWING ROOM AMBER C.V. CHRISTINE
text: As she jerks her hand away from the scorpion as if it
text: had stung her. Christine's indecision and agony
text: leave her. It is as if her mind suddenly cleared.
text: She becomes very calm. It is here that she makes her
text: her decision that she will become Erick's wife. She is
text: the spirit of a nun taking her final orders that will
dialog: forever remove her from society. With quiet delib-
text: ration she turns toward Erick.
speaker_heading: LONGER SHOT AMBER
text: Erick is playing wildly upon the organ. But this
text: is held only for a few feet. Erick senses the change
text: of atmosphere, stops playing, turns toward Christine
text: and rises. This places him at the top of the two steps
text: between the two rooms. Christine walks toward him,
text: quietly and with deliberation and pauses at the bot-
dialog: tom of the steps.
scene_heading: MED CLOSE UP ERICK AND CHRISTINE AMBER
text: Christine gazes up at him earnestly and the picture
text: is held for an instant. Erick realizes that the
text: final moment is at hand and there is a sense of
text: terror in his manner. She asks him in a trembling
dialog: voice:
dialog: "DO YOU SWEAR TO ME THAT THE
text: SCORPION IS THE ONE TO TURN?"
text: BACK: For the first time Erick shows fear. In a
text: hushed way he answers her:
dialog: "YES...IF YOU WISH TO BE MY BRIDE"
text: BACK: Quietly she turns from him.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP CHRISTINE AMBER
text: Without an instant's hesitation, but with
text: thorough consciousness of what she is doing
text: she turns the scorpion.
scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT AMBER
text: Erick walks toward her - a man crushed. Christine
text: in this instant has become his master. Christine
text: turns calmly to meet him.
scene_heading: INT BOTTOM CELLAR FAINT GREEN A FLASH CU RAOUL &
text: PERSIAN UPON THE STEPS UNDER THE TRAPS.
text: They are looking toward the cellar floor in fright.
scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT FAINT GREEN
text: A tremendous volume of water is rushing into the
dialog: cellar. To make this effective it must be arranged
dialog: so that this cellar can be completely filled in
text: twenty feet of film. As the water reaches the barrels
text: they float and spin around, but they float like filled
text: barrels not like empty ones.
scene_heading: INT ON LAKE #2 FAINT GREEN
text: This is the lake shot outside of the door to
text: Erick's drawing room. The water is receding.
dialog: This can be controlled by undercranking. The
dialog: water should recede rapidly.
scene_heading: INT BOTTOM CELLAR FAINT GREEN
text: Raoul and the Persian are hugging the trap.
text: The water is within two feet of the ceiling.
text: The barrels are floating around, the rats are
dialog: swimming for points of safety.
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S DRAWING ROOM CU ERICK & CHRISTINE
text: Erick is standing before her trembling from head to
text: feet. There is a resigned serenity about Christine.
text: She has sacrificed herself to save Raoul.
scene_heading: INT CELLAR CROSS SECTIONAL SHOT AMBER
text: The three levels are filled with the mob.
text: Torches are aflame. Hundreds of spears are in the
text: air, until the mob looks like an army of crusaders.
text: Many jump from one level to another. Others slide
text: down pipes. The general effect is of a multitude
text: pouring downward.
scene_heading: INT. ERICK'S DRAWING ROOM
text: Erick is discovered as he was left, cringing before
text: Christine, afraid. She lays a hand upon his shoulder
text: and reminds him of those whose cries for help
text: both can hear. Like a dog, Erick obeys her. He throws
text: back a rug, revealing a trap door. This he throws
text: open. Raoul and the Persian are discovered, half
text: drowned in the water which has risen to within a few
text: inches of the floor. The two men are so far gone that
text: they are in do condition to engage Erick in battle.
text: Erick, aided by Christine, drags both of the men out
text: of the water. The trap is left open.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP OF GROUP AMBER
text: Raoul is still alive and conscious. He is saved.
text: Christine is calm and very sad. Erick steps back
text: and tells the two men:
text: "I HAVE SAVED YOU TO PLEASE MY WIFE."
text: BACK: Raoul's eyes, dread and questioning, are upon
text: Christine. Very quietly and sadly, she indicates
text: "Yes, it is true." Slowly the arm of the sounding
text: device rises, unseen by those in the picture and
text: falls with a clang. All are checked at this un-
text: suspected interruption. The arm continues falling.
scene_heading: INT ON LAKE #1 AMBER
text: The water has receded almost two feet. The action
text: in these scenes is swift. Simon and Florine are
text: standing on the spot where Philippe was strangled.
text: Simon is beckoning the mob toward him. The first of
text: the mob is running down a runway thru a distant
text: arch. Spears and weapons are flourishing, torches
text: flaring. As the first of the mob reaches the boat
text: landing, the rest of the mob continues to bank up
dialog: the background.
text: A CLOSE SHOT OF FLORINE AMBER
text: The mob is behind him and no one is paying the least
text: attention to him. Simon is doing all of the talking.
text: Florine indicates "Follow me" Florine plants the
text: idea that he is going to jump into the water about
text: three feet deep. Florine jumps and lights stiff
text: legged in the water about six inches deep. (The
dialog: audience will think that he is going right out of
text: sight) Florine shows quick surprise "This is easy."
text: He beckons to the others, "Come in" - takes a step and
text: disappears, shoots straight out of sight. Without any
text: attempt to save himself. Still no one pays any
text: attention to his disappearance.
scene_heading: THE LONG SHOT AMBER
text: The first of the mob wades into the water. They
text: continue wading, shouting, waving their torches and
text: spears, until the entire set, water and back of boat
text: landing is filled. The mob is still pouring in from
text: the distant background. Florine comes up to the sur-
text: face blundering and spitting water. He swims out of
text: the little hole he has fallen into and follows the
dialog: others.
scene_heading: INT LAKE #2 AMBER
text: The mob is approaching. Hundreds of torches appear.
text: The mob does not move directly to Erick's door, but
text: does some exploring. Erick swiftly enters from the
text: door in the f.g., runs along the shelf, looks at the
text: mob and swiftly moves back into the drawing room.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP FLORINE AMBER
text: He is somewhat apart from the others who are wading
text: waist deep. Florine is swimming dog fashioned. A
text: peculiar expression comes over his face as he stops
text: swimming and feels under the water. Then he stands up.
text: The water is only to his knees.
scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT AMBER
text: A number or the mob catches sight of the door to
text: Erick's living room. News of the discovery travels
dialog: quickly and this is a general wild movement in
dialog: that direction.
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S DRAWING ROOM AMBER
text: Raoul and the Persian are still upon the floor,
text: but are rapidly regaining their strength. Christine
text: is in misery, half in tears, explaining to him that
text: someday he will understand. Erick swiftly enters
text: from Christine's bedroom carrying a cloak. Erick
text: throws the cloak over her shoulders. He indicates
text: for Christine to come. She does not wish to but
text: she is willing to live up to her promise. She allows
text: Erick to sweep her out of the room into his bedroom.
text: This is all very flat. Raoul is very weak but he will
text: fight for Christine. Raoul staggers to his feet.
scene_heading: INT ON LAKE #2 AMBER
text: The space around the door and the lake are filled
text: with the mob. They begin to pound upon the door
text: with their weapons.
scene_heading: INT. ERICK'S DRAWING ROOM
text: The Persian staggers to his feet and goes toward
text: the door of the lake. Raoul drags himself towards
text: Erick's bedroom. Both men are very worn and weak.
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S BED CHAMBER AMBER
text: The action here is swift. Erick jerks down one
text: of the black velvet drapes in the f.g. revealing
text: a door and a staircase leading upwards. The drape
text: that Erick jerks partly falls obliquely across
text: the coffin. The coffin is hidden from the entrance
text: view but not from the camera view. The moment the
text: door is opened, a draft comes down the stairs
text: corridor and causes all of the draperies in the
text: room to shimmer. Erick softly leads Christine up
text: these stairs closing the door after him. Raoul
text: drags himself in and reels towards the door.
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S LIVING ROOM AMBER
text: The Persian unlocks the door leading to the
text: lake. The mob led by Simon, floods in and fills
text: the room. The mob is wet. Florine is still in
text: evidence. The Persian indicates Erick's bed
text: chamber. He and Simon and others run toward the
dialog: chamber.
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S BEDCHAMBER AMBER
text: Raoul has opened the door leading to the stair
text: corridor, and all of the draperies are shimmering.
text: He is looking up the stairs. Simon, the Persian
text: and the others rush in. Simon excited sees the
text: coffin in only passing image. It is apparent
text: the direction Erick has fled. Simon gives the
text: Persian an order, Simon and about twenty others run up
text: the stairs, sweeping Raoul along with them.
text: The others all exit swiftly to the drawing room,
text: led by the Persian. When the last man has left the
text: room Florine enters. The coffin is not visible to
text: him, while it is to the audience. Florine is
text: a forlorn figure. He calls:
dialog: "SIMON! SIMON!"
text: BACK: The audience first sees what is happening.
text: There is a gust of wind from the corridor stairs.
text: It blows the drape which is lying obliquely over
text: the coffin in such a manner that it looks like a man's
text: head moving behind it. Florine now sees this.
text: But he is tired of being afraid. He picks up a club
text: which one of the mob left. He sneaks up to the
text: imaginary head, takes aim and gives it a terrible
text: whollop. The blow reveals the coffin and knocks
text: it over. It reels over twice and comes to rest face
text: up. Florine drops the club and tears out of the room.
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S DRAWING ROOM AMBER
text: The room is empty. Florine tears in, running,
text: looking back at the coffin room. He pauses on the
text: very edge of the open trap. He stands, his back to
text: the trap, looking toward the coffin room as if he
text: anticipated someone to come out and attack him.
text: Then he backs, steps over the missing trap, paying
text: no attention to it. He backs until his heels hits
text: the first step of the entrance door. Then he turns
text: and flies for his life.
scene_heading: INT ROI DE LAHORE SET...AMBER
text: This is played very swift and is made as short as
text: possible. Christine and Erick enter through the dark
text: opening, the door to which has now been battered down,
text: like two swiftly moving shadows. Erick sweeps her
text: along. They pass across the set and exit to the right.
text: The set is lighted by torches of the approaching
text: mob. The moment that Erick and Christine are out,
text: the mob enters from the left, Simon and Raoul in
text: evidence, and exit on the run up the circular stair
text: case. Another section of the mob continues to enter
text: thus making it impossible for Erick to return.
scene_heading: INT CROSS SECTIONAL SET...AMBER
text: This is showing the Persian's section of the mob
text: running upwards. Florine's is about ten feet behind
text: the rest - trying to catch up.
scene_heading: INT HEADLESS STATUE SET...AMBER
text: Erick and Christine come in from camera. Erick
text: takes a step toward stairs leading below. He
text: hears the mob coming up circular stairs. Sweeps
text: Christine to the right.
scene_heading: INT DRAGON SET AMBER
text: Erick sweeps in with Christine - comes to a sudden
dialog: stop looking to the right.
scene_heading: INT DUMMY SET AMBER
text: Erick affects a panic. He turns to retrace his
text: steps and again stops.
text: A section of the mob runs in from the right. They
text: spot Erick, and point, begin to run left.
scene_heading: INT HEADLESS SET . . . AMBER
text: Led by Simon, Raoul in evidence, the mob surges
text: up the circular staircase. Simon sees Erick out
text: right and raises a great cry. He and the others
text: run out to the right.
scene_heading: INT DRAGON SET . . .AMBER
text: An instant before the mob enters from right and left.
text: Erick sweeps Christine through the mouth of the
text: dragon and out of sight. The mob rushes in from both
text: directions. Simon yells some directions and runs
text: out the right with Raoul and some others. Those of
text: the mob remaining pull the dragon apart. (It is
text: built in two sections) revealing a closed, barred
text: door. They begin to batter down this door.
scene_heading: REAR OF OPERA HOUSE
text: The time is four o'clock. It is in the grey haze
text: before sunrise. In the following scenes such street
dialog: activities are shown must conform with the hour.
text: The coachman upon the traveling barouche is asleep
text: upon the driver's seat. Other than the coachman
text: the street is deserted. Erick enters from the
dialog: opera house, through hitherto non-conspicuous
text: little door that bears evidence of little use.
speaker_heading: 572
speaker_heading: 573
text: He is holding Christine by the arm. He gives a
text: swift glance around and swiftly moves with Christine
text: toward the barouche. At this moment the mob begins
text: pouring in from the stage in the entrance. As the
text: coach is the only object in the picture, it instantly
text: attracts their attention. They point.
text: CLOSE UP FLASH OF SIMON AND RAOUL
text: He points, wildly excited and shouts.
