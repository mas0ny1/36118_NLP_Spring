scene_heading: INT. BUICK LESABRE, MOVING — PHILADELPHIA — NIGHT (1995)
text: A Phillies baseball game broadcast is heard on the radio:
scene_heading: PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER
dialog: ...Here’s the 2-1 to Dykstra. Low and
dialog: away, ball 3. Dykstra’s one for two on
text: the night. He singled in the first and
dialog: grounded into a fielder’s choice...
text: JIMMY CONLON, early 30s, sits behind the wheel, a cigarette
text: dangling from his lips as he listens to the play-by-play. His
text: ruddy Irish face is roughened and broken, like that a
dialog: heavyweight boxer who never knew when to throw in the towel.
text: Up ahead, red lights glow as a CADILLAC DEVILLE brakes and
text: steers toward the curb. Jimmy follows, parking at a distance.
text: Two men step out of the Deville dressed in suits; SHAWN
text: MAGUIRE, 30s, and his consigliere, PAT MULLEN, 30s.
text: Shawn approaches. Jimmy rolls the window down and Shawn leans
text: in. He’s handsome, tough, savagely loyal. The type of leader
dialog: you'd follow anywhere. And Jimmy does.
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: We're gonna get the parents now. You
dialog: all set, ace?
text: Jimmy nods. Shawn smiles as sharp as a new penny, playfully
text: slaps Jimmy’s cheek, then goes.
text: Jimmy watches as Shawn and Pat approach a duplex and knock on
text: the front door. An ELDERLY COUPLE answers. Shawn shakes the
text: man’s hand and gentlemanly helps the woman down the steps.
text: The four enter the Cadillac and it cruises off.
text: Jimmy goes to work now. Shuts off the radio. Stubs out his
text: cigarette. Slides on leather gloves. Opens the glove
text: compartment and removes a STAINLESS STEEL SW1911 .45 ACP
text: PISTOL. Tucks it into his black leather coat and —
scene_heading: EXT. STREET — CONTINUOUS
text: Jimmy strides toward the home we saw the Elderly Couple exit.
text: Down the alley between homes. Into the BACKYARD now and...
text: ..-Abruptly, he’s INSIDE THE HOUSE, walking up the STAIRS
text: with the pistol in his hand. He can hear a SHOWER RUNNING and
text: starts down the hall in that direction and...
text: ...into a BEDROOM. A fusty, antiquated decor. Paintings of
text: Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, a crucifix on the wall. The
text: Phillies game plays on the television. The sound of the
text: shower gets LOUDER and LOUDER AND LOUDER as he moves into...
text: ...the BATHROOM. Thick with steam. Impossible to see. The
text: water so fucking loud now, like a WATERFALL CRASHING and —
text: Jimmy RIPS the shower curtain back. A gaunt, tattooed man,
text: BILLY COUGHLIN, 30, startles, covers himself:
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What the fuck!
text: And now he sees Jimmy and he knows Jimmy and he knows what
dialog: he’s come here for and he’s really fucking scared and:
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Jimmy, J-Jimmy please, no —
dialog: Jimmy RAISES the pistol:
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: But, Jimmy, I-I’ve been good — I've
dialog: been so good, Jimmy — I’ve —
text: BLAM! Jimmy FIRES! Right between the eyes. Billy COLLAPSES to
text: the floor of the tub like he doesn’t have bones. But
text: strangely he doesn’t die. Instead, he feels at the hole
text: between his eyes and the river of blood racing down his face
text: and he begins to LAUGH.
text: Jimmy raises the pistol again — BLAM! BLAM! — two bullets RIP
text: HOLES in Billy’s chest. He FLOPS AROUND like a fish out of
text: water, GASPING horribly for air...but it’s all a big joke.
text: Jimmy FIRES the pistol, over and over, but it only serves to
text: make Billy LAUGH LOUDER, MORE MANIACALLY, as if he’s being
text: tickled by the bullets and —
scene_heading: INT. THE ABBEY PUB — FISHTOWN, PHILADELPHIA — (PRESENT DAY)
text: Jimmy wakes with a start. Breathless and flush. He takes a
text: moment to let his nightmare ebb away and then sits up in the
text: booth and reaches for a box of Marlboros. Lights one and
text: sucks in a long, soothing drag. There, that’s better.
dialog: He’s in his late forties now and the years since he worked as
dialog: hitman for Shawn Maguire haven’t been kind to him. Scraggly,
text: four-day beard. Eyes stung with exhaustion and glassy from
dialog: too-much booze.
text: The place is decorated for the holidays and Burl Ives sings
text: ‘Holly Jolly Christmas’ on the jukebox. Rough and profane
text: IRISHMEN of all ages play pool, shoot the breeze at the bar,
text: toss darts. This is home base for Shawn’s crew.
speaker_heading: MAN’S VOICE (0.C.)
dialog: Hey Conlon.
text: Jimmy looks over at FRANK DORSEY, 30s, a bulky, arrogant
text: bruiser sitting on a stool among a group of ROUGHNECKS.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You were fartin’ in your sleep again,
dialog: yunno?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: How the fuck would I know that? I was
dialog: sleepin’.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You oughta try them geriatric diapers.
dialog: In case ya shit yourself.
text: Roughnecks SNICKER.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (mutters under his breath)
dialog: Go fuck your mothers.
text: Jimmy grabs a bottle of Bud. Two gulps in he realizes it’s
text: full of cigarette butts. He SPITS the beer out in a huge
text: spray, all over his sweatshirt.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuckin’ — motherfuckin’ shit...
text: Frank and Roughnecks LAUGH.
text: The rear door opens. Jimmy watches as COLIN MAGUIRE, 27,
text: brash and irresponsible, enters with two plainclothes
text: detectives; JASON SAYERS, 40s, white, boyishly handsome, and
text: TERRY NANCE, 40s, black, wiry.
text: The three duck into a back office.
scene_heading: REAR HALLWAY — MINUTES LATER
text: Jimmy waits outside the BACK OFFICE. Inside, Colin finishes
text: telling Sayers and Nance a joke:
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: — But how’s that gonna make my tits
dialog: any bigger? Boyfriend says, Beats me,
dialog: but it worked on your ass.
text: Sayers and Nance LAUGH. Colin reaches into a drawer and hands
text: both cops envelopes thick with cash.
speaker_heading: SAYERS NANCE
dialog: Thanks, Colin. ‘Preciate that, Colin.
speaker_heading: COLIN (CONT'D)
text: (glances at his watch)
dialog: Alright get outta here. Shit, shower,
dialog: shave time for me.
text: Sayers and Nance stand.
speaker_heading: SAYERS
dialog: Got a hot date? Gonna sniff a little
text: pussy under the mistletoe.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I wish. I’m introducin’ my father to a
dialog: new client tonight. Been tryin’ to put
dialog: this fuckin’ deal together for nine
text: months. Finally the old man agrees to
dialog: hear me out.
speaker_heading: SAYERS
dialog: Well he’s a busy man your father.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: (with disdain)
dialog: Yeah no shit. Merry Christmas, fellas.
text: Sayers and Nance exit the office, tossing a glare in Jimmy's
text: direction on their way out the back door.
text: Colin still hasn't noticed Jimmy. He sits behind the desk,
text: dumps a baggy of cocaine onto a mirror. Razorblades a line
text: and SNORTS a bump. He looks restless and edgy.
text: Jimmy KNOCKS. Startled, Colin looks up:
speaker_heading: COLIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus Christ! Can I get one fuckin’
dialog: moment to myself? Whaddayou want?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (stepping inside)
dialog: I talked to your dad this mornin’. The
dialog: furnace blew over at my place. Told me
dialog: to see you about a loan.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: A loan or a handout?
text: Colin shakes his head in disgust, pulls out a roll of cash.
speaker_heading: COLIN (CONT'D)
dialog: You're like a fuckin’ annuity, you
dialog: know that? Why my old man keeps you
dialog: around, I got no idea.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Maybe it’s got summin’ to do with us
dialog: bein’ friends goin’ on fifty years.
dialog: That type’a shit matters to some
dialog: people, yunno?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Anyone can put up with you that long
dialog: oughta be canonized.
dialog: (re: cash)
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Uh, ‘bout eight hundred.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I don’t know what the fuck ‘about
dialog: eight hundred’ means. Gimme a number.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Eight hundred.
text: Colin offers Jimmy the cash. When Jimmy reaches for it, Colin
text: pulls it back... reconsidering... a smirk curling...
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Actually I’m gonna make you earn this.
text: He points to a SANTA CLAUS COSTUME hanging on a closet door.
speaker_heading: COLIN (CONT'D)
dialog: McCauley’s fat ass cancelled on me.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No. Fuck that. I gotta get home.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: (pulls the cash away)
dialog: Fair enough. Get home and freeze your
dialog: dick off.
text: Off Jimmy, looking at the suit, then the cash...
scene_heading: INT. PHILADELPHIA INT’L AIRPORT — BAGGAGE CLAIM — AFTERNOON
text: Large wrapped gifts circle the carousel. Arriving COLLEGE
text: STUDENTS are welcomed home by their PARENTS. A GIRL excitedly
text: jumps into the arms of her BOYFRIEND.
text: And watching it all is MIKE CONLON, late 20s, good-looking,
text: athletic. He’s dressed in his chauffeur uniform and stands
text: among the other DRIVERS holding placards. It’s like any other
text: day... except today Mike’s placard reads: VICK, M.
text: TONY, 60s, a gruff colleague, stands beside him.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You gonna ask him about those three
dialog: interceptions last weekend?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah, Tone, cause that’s exactly what
dialog: he wants to talk about...
dialog: (a moment, then: )
dialog: I stopped at Target on my way over and
dialog: bought two footballs. I’m gonna see if
dialog: he’1l sign ‘em for my daughters.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Bad idea, kiddo. Repko got canned for
dialog: doin’ that, yunno? Asked Bette Midler
dialog: for a picture. She went batshit and
dialog: filed a report to Farina. Now he’s
text: pushin’ hot dogs outside the ballpark.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (torn)
dialog: Anybody else I wouldn't bother, it’s
dialog: just... they’re his biggest fans. You
dialog: should see ‘em on Sundays. Wake up
dialog: wearin’ his jersey and sit two inches
text: from the TV screen.
text: And here comes MICHAEL VICK off the escalator. Fine suit
text: under a long black overcoat. People take notice, point,
text: stare, snap Iphone pictures. He strides towards Mike.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Good evening, Mr. Vick. I can take
dialog: that for you.
text: Mike grabs Vick’s luggage and follows him toward the exit. He
text: glances back at Tony, who mouths: Don’t Do It.
scene_heading: INT. MIKE’S LIMOUSINE, MOVING — EARLY EVENING
text: SPORTS TALK on the RADIO. Mike drives, stealing glances at
text: Vick in the rearview who is busy texting on his Blackberry.
text: Mike’s eyes shift to the passenger seat where’s he placed the
text: two just-purchased footballs alongside a Sharpie pen.
text: A CALLER on the RADIO becomes prominent:
speaker_heading: CALLER (V.O.)
dialog: This is Andy from Roxborough. Michael
dialog: Vick is a bum! He’s a bum and —
text: Mike REACTS quickly and shuts the radio off. He glances
text: embarrassedly back at Vick who is looking at him.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Sorry about that... Lotta haters in
dialog: this town.
scene_heading: EXT. LUXURY HIGH-RISE — RITTENHOUSE — NIGHT
text: The limo arrives out front. Mike opens the door for Vick and
text: then removes his luggage. Vick hands him a generous tip.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Appreciate the ride, man.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Sure thing. Good luck this weekend.
text: Vick wheels the luggage toward the lobby entrance. Mike looks
text: at the footballs in the car... then at Vick walking away...
scene_heading: EXT. MAGUIRE HOME — FISHTOWN — ESTABLISHING — NIGHT
text: Like every other row home on the street. A bit nicer, but not
text: much. Through the windows, we see a HOLIDAY PARTY underway.
speaker_heading: MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: I’m told you’re the Prince of the
dialog: City, Mr. Maguire. That you have
dialog: friends in all the places one could
dialog: hope to have friends.
scene_heading: INT. MAGUIRE HOME — OFFICE — NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON: SHAWN MAGUIRE sitting behind a large mahogany desk.
dialog: He’s 50 years old now and he’s aged as well as any man could
text: hope to. We hear the sounds of the party outside the door.
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: You shouldn't believe everything you
dialog: hear. I’m a simple man. I grew up in
dialog: this house. My father sat behind this
text: desk. The guests just outside that
dialog: door I’ve known since I was a boy.
text: Across from Shawn sits STEVAN KUJOVIC, 30s, an impeccably
text: dressed Serbian. His bodyguard GORAN, 40, hangs by the door.
text: Never far from Shawn’s side, PAT MULLEN stands nearby.
speaker_heading: KUJOVIC
dialog: Either way, I'd like to make an
dialog: arrangement with you.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: What’s in it for us?
speaker_heading: KUJOVIC
dialog: Money, of course. A million up-front.
text: He sets a leather briefcase on the desk and opens it. Shawn
text: glances at the STACKS OF CASH inside.
speaker_heading: KUJOVIC (CONT’D)
dialog: After that you’1ll receive twenty
dialog: percent of all the product you allow
text: to pass safely through the port.
text: Kujovic reaches into his jacket and removes a small baggy of
dialog: cocaine.
speaker_heading: KUJOVIC (CONT’D)
dialog: (re: the cocaine)
dialog: My associates have a name for it.
dialog: Virgin. 99 percent pure. The very best
dialog: in the world.
text: Shawn mulls the cash a moment, seemingly impressed. Then:
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: The business has changed, Mr. Kujovic.
dialog: The mob’s dead. Last week the Feds
dialog: arrested two members of what’s left of
text: the Gambino Family. They were driving
dialog: sixteen year old girls to New Jersey
dialog: to have sex in short-stays while they
dialog: collected half the hourly fuck rate...
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: SHAWN (CONT'D)
dialog: Twenty years ago I made a living the
dialog: same way we all did. A few big scores
dialog: a year, but mostly I was a grinder.
dialog: You wanted to lay down on a few ball
dialog: games, you came to me. You wanted to
dialog: open a butcher shop and the bank said
dialog: fuck-you on the loan, you came to me.
dialog: Know what that butcher shop is today?
dialog: (pause for effect)
dialog: An Applebee's.
speaker_heading: KUJOVIC
dialog: Why are you telling me this?
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: Because there’s no money in that
dialog: business anymore. I’ve had to adapt.
dialog: Find other ways to make a living. But
dialog: I don’t deal in drugs. Know why?
speaker_heading: KUJOVIC
dialog: Enlighten me.
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: It’s a whore’s business. And the pimps
dialog: like you that bring that poison to the
dialog: streets are worse than those two
text: guineas peddling underage pussy at the
dialog: Econo Lodge... D’you understand me?
text: The two men stare at each other an anxious moment, then:
speaker_heading: KUJOVIC
dialog: I think this meeting is over.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Good observation.
text: Silently livid, Kujovic closes the briefcase and stands. He
text: and Goran move to exit. Before they can:
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: One more thing...
dialog: (Kujovic turns back)
dialog: Whoever told you I had friends in this
dialog: city was right. Make sure I never hear
dialog: your name again.
text: Kujovic dismisses the threat with a smirk, then goes.
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM — NIGHT
text: The Annual Maguire Family Holiday Party. The space is crowded
text: with FAMILY, FRIENDS, SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE GANG and their
text: YOUNG CHILDREN. GIFTS are scattered around a CHRISTMAS TREE.
text: We find COLIN standing by a makeshift bar. Beside him, is
text: KENAN BOYLE, 28, a born-bad roughneck friend tattooed toes-to-
text: neck. Colin tosses back a shot of vodka. Probably his tenth.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: (to Bartender)
dialog: Gimme anotha one, will ya.
speaker_heading: KENAN
dialog: (nudges Colin)
dialog: Here he comes now.
text: He’s referring to Kujovic who is making his way towards them.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: (to Bartender)
dialog: Make it three, huh.
text: (sees him lift a bottle)
dialog: Not that, fuckhead, the good shit.
text: Kujovic arrives. Colin excitedly offers him a shot of vodka.
speaker_heading: COLIN (CONT'D)
dialog: To a very Merry fuckin’ Christmas and
dialog: many more to come.
text: But Kujovic doesn’t accept the shot. He just stares at Colin.
speaker_heading: KUJOVIC
dialog: You have until tomorrow night to
dialog: return my down payment, Colin.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: (nonplussed)
dialog: ...What are you talkin’ about?
speaker_heading: KUJOVIC
dialog: I paid you to guarantee your father’s
dialog: support —
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Yeah, yeah and —
speaker_heading: KUJOVIC
dialog: And he just told me he’d rather deal
dialog: with a guinea pimp than me... Tomorrow
dialog: night. Or you know how this ends.
text: Colin sees it burning in Kujovic’s eyes: the threat very
text: real. Kujovic and Goran leave.
text: Off Colin, confused, angry...
scene_heading: INT. STUDY — NIGHT
text: Colin storms in and marches up to his father’s desk.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Kujovic just walked out. What’d you
dialog: say to him?
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: I heard him out like you asked me to,
dialog: and then I wished him safe travels.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Did you even fuckin’ listen to what he
dialog: had to say?
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Colin, that’s not our business —
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: (WHIPS to Pat, sharply)
dialog: You shut your mouth! I’m talkin’ to my
dialog: father.
text: Pat nods, backs off.
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: What’s the problem, Colin?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: The problem is all I ever hear outta
dialog: your mouth is when am I gonna pull my
dialog: weight. So now I bring in a piece of
dialog: business — a good piece of business —
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: And you're mad I just let it walk out
dialog: the door?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: If I listened to every good piece of
dialog: business you brought in, I’d be livin’
text: in the basement of Saint Anne’s
text: Church, stealing crumbs from the mice.
text: Pat stifles a laugh. Colin feels small.
speaker_heading: SHAWN (CONT’D)
dialog: (dismissive, patronizing)
dialog: Now go have another drink.
text: Abruptly, Colin grabs Shawn’s highball of scotch and FIRES it
text: against the wall behind his father’s head. It SHATTERS!
text: Shawn doesn’t so much as flinch.
text: Colin stares at his father a long moment. So much rage in
dialog: those eyes. Been building for years.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: When are you gonna take me seriously?
text: And with that Shawn realizes just how deep this goes. Colin
text: KICKS over a chair and storms off. As he passes Pat:
speaker_heading: COLIN (CONT'D)
dialog: And fuck you, too!
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM — NIGHT
text: It’s Santa Claus...or rather Jimmy dressed in the Santa Claus
text: suit, sitting alone in a barrel back chair. Asleep, SNORING,
text: glass of whiskey in his lap.
text: A KNOCK at the door. BRENDAN, 40, a broad-shouldered member
text: of the gang, peeks in.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Jimmy.
speaker_heading: (LOUDER now)
dialog: Jimmy
text: Jimmy shoots up:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What? Who’s there?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Come on. Get up, old man. The kids’re
dialog: waitin’ for ya downstairs.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Okay. Right...
text: Jimmy labors to his feet and pours himself another glass of
text: whiskey. He pulls down his long white beard and erases it in
text: a single gulp.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Let’s get this shit over with.
text: He leaves the room.
scene_heading: INT. MIKE’S ROW HOME — PORT RICHMOND — FRONT DOOR — NIGHT
text: Modest but cozy. A Christmas tree festooned with homespun
text: ornaments. Monogrammed stockings hang from the mantel.
text: Mike enters, stomps the snow off his shoes. Removes his knit
text: cap and gloves. His daughters, CATELYN, 6, and, LILY, 4, race
text: up to him, full of excitement.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: There they are...
speaker_heading: CATELYN
dialog: Did you get it, Dad?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Did you get it, Dad?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Get what?
text: Catelyn glowers, hands on hips: you know what. Mike SIGHS.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry, guys. I chickened out. I
dialog: had it all planned — I knew exactly
dialog: how I was gonna ask him and then...
text: But as Mike takes off his coat, we see the footballs stuffed
text: up the back of his shirt. The girls beam and quickly wrestle
dialog: them out. They’ve both been signed — to Catelyn and to Lily
text: — from Michael Vick. Elated, the girls race off:
speaker_heading: CATELYN (0.C.)
dialog: Mommy, look what Dad got me!
speaker_heading: LILY (0.C.)
dialog: Look what Dad got me, mom.
text: Mike smiles, follows them into the —
speaker_heading: KITCHEN
text: where his wife SARAH, late 20s, an understated beauty, eight
text: months pregnant now, sets dinner out on the kitchen table,
text: still dressed in her waitress uniform from an earlier shift.
speaker_heading: CATELYN
dialog: Wow. Are those special or what? Now
dialog: let’s sit down for dinner, ok?
text: The girls sit at the table. Mike wraps his arms around Sarah.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: How was your day?
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: The washing machine broke again. Tim
text: Borzell came over to look at it.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: And I saw one on sale at Sears for
dialog: $600 dollars.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (forces a smile)
dialog: I'll ask Vince if I can pick up some
dialog: extra shifts, alright?
text: They kiss, then join the girls at the table. Dinner — chicken
text: casserole, string beans, crescent rolls — is passed around.
speaker_heading: CATELYN
dialog: Guess what happened in school today?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Guess what happened in school today?
speaker_heading: CATELYN
dialog: Dad, tell Lily to stop copying me.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Lily, stop copying your sister.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Lily, stop copying your sister.
text: Mike looks at her. She smiles mischievously, adorably.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Oh now you’re gonna copy me?
speaker_heading: LILY MIKE
dialog: Oh now you’re gonna copy me? You know what that means —
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Tickle Monster!
text: He begins to TICKLE her. She laughs like crazy. Sarah smiles.
scene_heading: INT. MAGUIRE HOME — FAMILY ROOM — NIGHT
text: All the guests are congregated around the fireplace including
text: SHAWN, his beautiful wife, ROSE, 50s, and PAT. Jimmy, falling-
text: down drunk by now, sits in a leather chair as YOUNG CHILDREN
text: take turns sitting on his lap, disclosing their wish lists.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Alright, who’s up next?
text: An attractive YOUNG MOTHER sets her DAUGHTER on Jimmy's lap.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s your name, sweetie?
speaker_heading: DAUGHTER
dialog: Kirsten.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: D’you think Mommy wants to sit on
dialog: Santa’s other knee, Kirsten?
text: Muffled LAUGHS from the Guests. FRANK isn’t amused.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That's my wife, Jimmy.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (SCANS the crowd)
dialog: Who's that? Frank?
dialog: (to Young Mother)
dialog: Gimme a call if you wanna add a few
dialog: inches. I’m skinny but I’m long.
text: Frank starts like he’s about to have a go at Jimmy. A MALE
text: GUEST holds him back.
dialog: Rose whispers to Shawn:
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Whose idea was it to have Jimmy do
dialog: this?
text: Shawn keeps quiet, but his eyes move to COLIN in the hall..
text: he’s cornered a YOUNG WOMAN... she looks uncomfortable,
text: scared even... he tries to kiss her... she slips away...
text: Colin finishes his drink, mouths fuckin’ bitch... Their eyes
text: meet for a moment... father and son... Shawn turns away...
text: Jimmy takes another slug of whiskey.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Okay, Kirsten, let’s see what Santa
dialog: brought for you this year.
text: Jimmy stands and moves to the Christmas tree. He bends down
text: to pick up a gift, teeters, then pitches forward, catching
text: himself on the blazing hot fire screen. It BURNS his hand!
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
text: OWW! SHIT! GODDAMN FUCKIN’ — !
text: He FALLS to his knees, clutching his hand, muttering curses.
text: The children are scared, unsure what to do.
text: Shawn glances at Pat, and motions for him to get in there.
text: Pat moves to Jimmy. Brendan assists now as well and the two
text: manage to get him to his feet.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Come on, Jimmy, let’s take a break.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I’m fine, I'm fine —
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: You're not fine. You’re drunk is
dialog: whatcha are.
dialog: (to the kids)
dialog: Santa’ll be right back, guys.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BOY
dialog: What happened to him?
speaker_heading: PAT
text: One’a the reindeer got hurt.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM — NIGHT
text: ON SHAWN: watching from the doorway as Pat and Brendan take
text: the Santa suit off Jimmy, so drunk he can’t stand up on his
text: own. There’s a small sadness in Shawn’s eyes... it pains him
dialog: to see his oldest friend this way...
text: The suit is off and Pat hands it over to SKINNY YOUNG HOOD
text: who quickly puts it on. It’s far too big.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: SKINNY HOOD
dialog: This thing don’t fit me so good, Mr.
dialog: Maguire.
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: Just get your ass downstairs.
text: Skinny Hood nods, goes. Pat and Brendan shove Jimmy into the
text: shower now. He resists, drunk and mumbling...
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Getchyour fuckin’ hands off’a —
text: ..-but it’s futile. They shove him into the bath and turn on
text: the shower. The cold water takes his breath. He GASPS.

speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: Billy Coughlin was a pederast, Jimmy.
text: He would wait outside the ball fields
dialog: askin’ little boys if they wanted to

text: Harding and Flores sit across from Jimmy.
speaker_heading: HARDING (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: HARDING

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: You don’t like the suit?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: When’s the last time you got pussy?
speaker_heading: HARDING

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: How’d that work out?
speaker_heading: HARDING

dialog: Hand to God it never leaves this

speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Get outta the car.
speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: KENAN
dialog: The fuck do you think you’re goin’?

speaker_heading: BLAM!
speaker_heading: BLACK.
text: For an uncomfortably long time. Finally:

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Gimme a light, will ya.
text: Mike opens a drawer, hands him a lighter. Jimmy lights the

text: They spread out.
speaker_heading: CONCOURSE
text: Jimmy and Mike moving through a CRUSH OF PEDESTRIANS, feeling
text: the urgency and picking up the pace.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: stalks through that same concourse. SEES JIMMY UP AHEAD
text: stepping onto a DOWN ESCALATOR. He RUNS now, KNOCKING people
text: out of the way — holiday shopping bags hitting the floor as
text: he PUSHES HIS WAY ONTO THE ESCALATOR and —
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: turns back, SEES Frank nearing.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Shit!
text: Jimmy sights him now, too.
text: Mike TAKES OFF. Jimmy’s not quick enough. Frank GRABS a
text: fistful of Jimmy’s parka. A STRUGGLE ENSUES.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: steps off the escalator and turns back. SEES Jimmy in a
text: struggle, being pummeled by Frank.
text: He decides to leave him.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
text: deflecting blows — manages to FLEE FRANK'S GRASP. He STUMBLES
text: off the escalator and RUNS INTO the —
speaker_heading: BATHROOM
text: tries to lock the door when —
text: BA-WOOMP! the DOOR FLIES BACKWARD as FRANK comes barreling
text: in, KNOCKING Jimmy to the floor. Frank locks the door and
text: stares down at Jimmy, a shit-eating grin curling on his face:
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’ve been waitin’ a long time for
dialog: this, Conlon.
text: Frank KICKS Jimmy in the ribs. Jimmy MOANS, tries to CRAWL
text: AWAY. Frank DRAGS grabs his leg and PULLS him back, KICKING
text: him over and over. Jimmy WRITHES in pain.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m enjoying this even more than I
dialog: thought.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yunno your wife called me last night.
text: Another KICK to Jimmy’s ribs. Jimmy GRIMACES.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: (teeth-clenched in pain)
dialog: Goddamnit... you fuckin’...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What'd my wife say?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (catches his breath, then)
dialog: She wanted to take me up on my offer.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Is that right?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: And I gotta tell ya, Frank. I’ve never
text: seen a woman swallow twelve inches
dialog: like she did.
text: Frank SMILES, almost appreciates the moxie of the tough old
text: prick. He PICKS JIMMY UP by his brown parka and delivers a
text: PALE-HORSE PUNCH to Jimmy’s face. Jimmy WHEELS BACKWARDS into
text: the trash can, collapses to the floor. Tired, bloodied, done.
dialog: 47.
text: Frank REMOVES an HK P30 PISTOL from the waist of his jeans
text: and starts towards Jimmy as —
text: Jimmy inconspicuously SLIPS the belt off his trousers and as
text: Frank raises the pistol and —
text: WHAP! Jimmy WHIPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE with the belt buckle.
text: Frank DROPS the pistol, doubles over, holding his eye.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Fuck — you MOTHERFUCKER — !
text: Jimmy’s on his feet — WRAPS the belt around Frank’s neck like
text: a garrotte — PULLING IT SO FUCKING TIGHT and —
text: Frank FIGHTS HIM LIKE A BULL — wheeling backwards — then
text: forward — SLAMMING JIMMY INTO THE STALLS and AGAINST THE WALL
text: — HIS FACE AN INFERNO and —
text: Jimmy’s knuckles whiten — teeth clench tighter — mining every
text: ounce of strength left in his wearied bones...
text: Until... finally... Frank’s strength wanes... resistance
text: flags... he COLLAPSES over the sinks, and DIES...
text: Jimmy lets him down. Takes a moment to find his breath. Seems
text: on the verge of collapse and has to steady himself against
dialog: the wall...
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM — MINUTES LATER
text: As Jimmy joins the crowd of others waiting for the subway.
text: Keeps his head down, avoids eye contact.
text: A LIGHT appears in the tunnel. The SUBWAY nears.

speaker_heading: BRENDAN
text: moving through the throng. SEES Jimmy’s brown parka up ahead.
text: SLIPS a pistol out.
speaker_heading: THE SUBWAY
text: Brakes HISS as it arrives at the platform.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
text: grabs the brown parka and SPINS the man around. JABS the

speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Say goodbye, motherfucker —
text: ..-But it’s not Jimmy. Just a grizzled old BUM, happy as a
text: clam about his new winter coat.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: JIMMY

text: leaves the station and disappears into a tunnel.
text: He EXHALES, falls into a seat...
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSTATE 676, VINE STREET EXPRESSWAY — NIGHT
text: The scene of the accident. A circus. Flares, police tape,
text: traffic backed up for miles. HORNS from impatient drivers.
text: For HARDING it’s just another night on the job as he crouches

text: FLORES appears behind him.
speaker_heading: FLORES

speaker_heading: FLORES
dialog: (nods)
dialog: He called it in. Said his father just
text: shot and killed someone. The body they
dialog: found inside was Colin Maguire.
text: Harding, never surprised by what he hears anymore, takes a
text: moment with this one. He turns back to the cruiser, SEES
text: something inside and REACHES for it. He lifts the VACANT
text: HANDCUFFS into frame... thinking...
text: MOMENTS LATER — HARDING AND FLORES
text: heading back to their car when DETECTIVES SAYERS and NANCE
dialog: (the two plainclothes detectives we met inside Colin’s

speaker_heading: SAYERS

speaker_heading: SAYERS

scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY CAR, MOVING — NIGHT
text: A SMALL PUDDLE OF BLOOD.
text: Drips from Jimmy’s sweatshirt onto the floor. The sleeve is
text: soaked from the bullet wound.
text: PAN UP to Jimmy. Pallid and weak. Across the aisle, a BLACK
text: WOMAN stares warily at him. Not wanting to arouse suspicion,
text: Jimmy STANDS and trudges into ANOTHER CAR...
text: ..-and there, sitting alone at the opposite end, is MIKE.
text: Thousand-yard stare in his eyes, trying to comprehend how his
dialog: life fell apart in a matter of a few hours...
text: Jimmy walks that way and SITS across from him.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Looks like we're stuck together
dialog: tonight.
text: Mike looks at him, eyes burning with resentment.
text: A moment passes, then:
speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: JIMMY

dialog: Where are the girls?
speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: at this point)
dialog: Get outta the city?

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: KENAN
dialog: I’m really sorry, Mr. Maguire. He, he
dialog: was my best friend and —

speaker_heading: HARDING

speaker_heading: FARINA

speaker_heading: HARDING

dialog: How long’s Conlon worked for you?
speaker_heading: FARINA
dialog: Almost two years now.
speaker_heading: FLORES
dialog: Good worker?
speaker_heading: FARINA
dialog: Best employee I got. Never missed a
dialog: pick-up. Never got a complaint. Every
dialog: driver was like him I wouldn't have
text: stomach ulcers the size’a silver
dialog: dollars. Instead I got fifteen
dialog: shitheads and one saint.
text: He tosses back two horse pills and washes them down with a
dialog: glass of Alka-Seltzer.
text: Harding’s CELL PHONE VIBRATES. He stands, ducks out into the

speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: Harding.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (V.O.)

speaker_heading: HARDING

text: INTERCUT BETWEEN JIMMY AND HARDING
text: A beat. Harding, realizing it really is Jimmy. Then:
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: I hope you’re on a plane to the
dialog: Shangri-La, Conlon.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I tried. Flight was booked.
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: Then breathe in that fresh air cause
dialog: where you’re going you’1l be lucky if

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What was the number you had me at?
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: Sixteen.
speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: No shit. Only this time I got thirty

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What if I told you my son didn’t have

speaker_heading: HARDING

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What does?
speaker_heading: HARDING
text: Tables turned. Being the one hunted.
dialog: Even your pal Shawn Maguire wants you

text: A beat to let that sink in. Jimmy doesn’t object. Can’t.
speaker_heading: HARDING (CONT’D)
dialog: Turn yourself in. Make this easy.
text: Jimmy considers it for a moment, then:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You drink coffee, Harding?
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: Six cups a day for the last thirty

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Put in a little extra sugar. It’s

speaker_heading: CATELYN
dialog: Who’s that man, daddy?
text: Jimmy's about to respond, step forward to meet her. Then:
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Nobody, honey. Let’s get in the car

scene_heading: INT. OLDSMOBILE ACHIEVA, MOVING — NIGHT
text: Jimmy drives, smokes. Mike’s in the passenger seat, staring

dialog: (meaning Jimmy)
dialog: There are worse ways to make a buck, I
dialog: guess.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: But you like it? I mean, you’re happy?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: Since when do you give a shit if I’m
dialog: happy? This is for your own sake,
dialog: right? Peace of mind? I say I’m happy,
dialog: that life turned out alright, and you
dialog: don’t feel so shitty for walking out
dialog: on mom and me?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: That’s right. So are you?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Happy?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'd be happier if I was playing third
dialog: base for the Phillies, but something
dialog: tells me that aint gonna happen.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You don’t got the arm for third
dialog: anyway.
dialog: (off Mike's look)
dialog: I’m just sayin’. Second maybe. Third?
dialog: No shot. Ball’s’d be skipppin’ into
dialog: first.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: You really are a piece of work, you
dialog: know that?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I’m not tryin’ to bust balls, it’s

speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: (raises his middle finger)
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I use’ta watch your games.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: JIMMY

text: A beat. What Jimmy says next doesn’t come easily:
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: You were a good player, though. Good,

dialog: You didn’t tear your knee up, maybe
dialog: things coulda turned out different.

speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Get a tryout, make a minor league
dialog: club. Who knows? But that’s life,
dialog: yunno? It don’t offer any do-overs.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Believe me I know.
text: A few silent moments pass. Only the sound of 1060 NEWSRADIO.
text: The ANCHOR tells of plummeting temperatures. It’s suggested
text: the elderly stay inside.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: She would still ask for you, yunno?
dialog: That used to drive me crazy. I'd be in
text: the hospital room with her and all of

dialog: wish your father was here... And
dialog: later, when she got really sick, she’d
text: wake up in the middle of the night
dialog: calling your name.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Your mother and I were together a long
dialog: time. They weren't all bad years.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Didn't you ever think about comin’ by?
dialog: I mean, just to... say hello, see how
dialog: she was doin’... watch a stupid
dialog: goddamn tv show for all I care. That

dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I watched my father go that way. Took

dialog: weighed a hundred and ten pounds.
dialog: (shakes his head)

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Well good for you. You kept your

speaker_heading: JIMMY

text: family gathers and stories are told
dialog: about what a nice, simple, decent man
dialog: he was. Then they go home and go on
dialog: about their lives... The second man

text: Parties are thrown to celebrate his
text: life, others to rejoice in his death.
dialog: His enemies toast that they’1ll never

text: Jimmy and Mike exchange a look, then quickly move to join the

dialog: 77.
text: Suddenly SMOKE CREEPS into the stairwell. HYSTERIA RISES and

dialog: Oh thank you. Thank you...

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: MIKE (0.C.)

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY — NIGHT — ON HARDING

speaker_heading: SAYERS
dialog: Shit!
scene_heading: STAIRWELL — HARDING

text: EMPTY. He looks around. Nothing.
text: Just then, Sayers and Nance emerge from the opposite

scene_heading: EXT. WAREHOUSE — SIDE EXIT — JIMMY AND MIKE

dialog: Take Rowland... get away from all this

text: Jimmy slips off his shoe, rolls down his sock. His ankle blue-
text: black, badly swollen.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You alright?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: 81.
text: Jimmy leans back and attempts to catch his breath. His belly

scene_heading: INT. OLDSMOBILE ACHIEVA, MOVING — NIGHT

speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: You got a better idea?
text: And with that Jimmy steps out of the car.
text: WE FOLLOW HIM as he walks down the ramp, unraveling the
text: bandage on his burnt hand until it’s off. The ROAR OF AN
text: ENGINE is heard below and the dull notes of Vivaldi and he
text: lights a cigarette and the ENGINE is CLOSER and the Vivaldi
text: is LOUDER and Jimmy STOPS and faces the ramp just below where
text: he stands. He TIGHTENS HIS GRIP — AIMS THE PISTOL as —

text: Glasses cracked. Face a bloody mess. But still breathing...
text: Jimmy reaches in and grips him by his shirt.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at me, you sonofabitch.
text: Price does. Smiles crookedly through blood-coated teeth. And
text: then LAUGHS. Jimmy PRESSES the pistol against his temple.
text: Price LAUGHS HARDER, LOUDER, more maniacally and —
text: FLASH TO: BILLY COUGHLIN. IN THE SHOWER. FEELING AT THE HOLE
text: IN HIS HEAD. LOOKING UP AT JIMMY, LAUGHING MANIACALLY.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: tired of the demons — so fucking tired of them — fingers the

dialog: from sending Price into permanent dark when —
speaker_heading: MIKE (0.C.)
dialog: Dad!
text: Jimmy turns. It’s Mike, halfway down the ramp.
dialog: Dad. That word. Paralyzes him.

scene_heading: INT. THE ALLEY PUB — NIGHT
text: Empty. Eerily quiet.
text: The door opens and Jimmy steps inside, pistol in hand.
text: TIGHT ON: JIMMY’S EYES. Back in killer mode. Alert. Darting
dialog: to even the slightest movement or sound.
text: The Christmas lights BLINK. An ANIMATED SANTA on the bartop
text: clicks into motion, repeating a Ho-Ho-Ho refrain.
text: Fear registers on his face. Uncertainty. How long has it
dialog: been? Is he too fucking old? Then —
text: AN ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE SOUND — A DOOR KNOB TURNING and —
text: Jimmy CATCHES IT — WHIRLS to —
text: PAT — across the room — stepping out of the back hall. He
text: FIRES at Jimmy and makes a fatal mistake. He misses. Before
dialog: he has a second chance —
text: BLAM! BLAM! JIMMY PUTS TWO BULLETS INTO HIS STOMACH.
text: PAT FALLS ONTO A TABLE, THEN COLLAPSES TO THE FLOOR, DEAD.

text: As Shawn runs for his Cadillac, fumbling at his keys, drops

dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: JIMMY

dialog: but won’t take it.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Turn around!
text: Shawn pauses. Raises his arms.
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: I don’t have a gun.

speaker_heading: SHAWN (CONT’D)
dialog: Been a long night, hasn’t it?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: I don’t blame you, Jimmy. I would've

speaker_heading: SHAWN (CONT’D)
dialog: I wanna hear about Michael.
dialog: (moving closer)
dialog: God, it must be fifteen years since I
dialog: saw the boy.
text: Just as Shawn’s about to reach Jimmy, Jimmy RAISES HIS GUN —
text: BLAM! THE PISTOL’S REPORT ECHOES FOR MILES.
text: For a moment, Shawn doesn’t react. Slowly now, blood begins
text: to seep through his shirt. A crimson blotch. He crumples to
text: the cold pavement.
text: Jimmy nears, looks down at his friend whose breaths are short
text: and shallow. He STEPS on Shawn’s hand. The knife falls from
text: his grip. Jimmy reaches down and tosses it into the darkness.
text: He tucks the pistol away now and sits beside Shawn and pulls
text: him into his arms and holds him like a child.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I’m sorry, Shawn... I did it for my
dialog: son. I did it for Michael.
dialog: 94.
text: Shawn looks up at Jimmy. There’s no anger evident in his
text: eyes. Only regret. Something the two men know well.
text: Shawn tries to speak but the words don’t come. He reaches his
text: hand up and PATS Jimmy’s cheek. Forgiveness.
text: The wind picks up.
text: Jimmy takes off his flannel coat, lays it over Shawn’s body.
text: As Shawn fights for his final breaths, Jimmy stills him,
text: holds his hand.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s okay... it’s almost over now...
text: Shawn’s eyes narrow... then slowly close... the light goes
text: out of him and he crosses that line...
text: Jimmy doesn’t get up right away. He stays there for a very
text: long while, holding his friend in his arms, keeping him warm.

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: We'll see. I don’t got much of an arm,

speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m glad you got to meet them.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Me, too.
dialog: Mike goes.
text: Jimmy is alone. Physically and emotionally drained. He moves
text: to the sink and pours himself a glass of water. Drinks it in
text: a single gulp. Ahhhh... He runs his burnt hand under the cold
text: water and watches the water move through his calloused
text: fingers before finally shutting the faucet off.
text: He paces around when he notices the COLLAGE Sarah was making
dialog: for the new baby on the kitchen table. ‘US BEFORE YOU’. It’s
text: finished now. Every inch of canvas covered.
text: He looks at it curiously a moment. Sits at the table now and
text: peers down at the pictures. So many. A mosaic of moments fit
text: together to tell a family’s life.
speaker_heading: JIMMY’S POV
text: The pictures. Catelyn’s birth, Lily’s first bath; birthdays,

text: We stay on Jimmy for a very long while, fighting like hell to
dialog: hold it together...
dialog: Until...
dialog: 103.
text: ...-something strange happens. Looking at the photos again, he
dialog: realizes... his son isn’t him... that his sins are his own...
text: And a great relief washes over him.
text: His whole body slackens as if a great weight has been lifted.
text: He gathers himself and moves to the back door. Through a pane
text: of glass, he watches his family down by the lake. Walking
text: along the water’s edge. The girls pointing at the ducks.
text: BOOSH! THE GLASS DOOR PANEL SHATTERS!
text: SIX BULLETS RIP INTO HIS CHEST!
text: He REELS BACK — tries to steady himself against the kitchen
text: table — but his legs give out and he COLLAPSES to the floor.
text: Through the shattered panel, WE SEE PRICE OUTSIDE. A haunting
text: visage. The left side of his face covered with crimson-tinged
text: bandages. His glasses are cracked and askew. Like a figure
text: from a nightmare figure come horribly to life.
text: AT THE LAKE’S EDGE

speaker_heading: PRICE

text: Undaunted, he reaches over with his left hand and takes the
text: pistol and trudges forward as —
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: begins to SCURRY UP THE STEEP SLOPE when he notices Price.

speaker_heading: PRICE
text: raises his left arm, levels the pistol at Mike when —
speaker_heading: BLAM! BLAM!

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Dad!

speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: DAD, ANSWER ME!
speaker_heading: TIGHT ON JIMMY
text: Very near death. Slumped against the frame of the back door.

text: He shivers from the cold, starts a pot of coffee.
text: Moves to the kitchen table now. It’s littered with textbooks
