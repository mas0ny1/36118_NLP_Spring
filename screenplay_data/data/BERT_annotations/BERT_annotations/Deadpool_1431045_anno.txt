text: DEADPOOL, in full DRESS REDS and MASK, quietly FIDGETS in the

text: Deadpool adjusts the two KATANAS strapped to his back. Rolls
text: the WINDOWS up, down, up. Tries futilely to untwist the

text: a tourist booklet and tears out a HAUNTED SEGWAY TOUR coupon.
text: The CABBIE, young, thin, brown, glances back and forth from
text: the rear view to the road to the rear view.
speaker_heading: DEADPOOL
dialog: Kinda lonesome back here.
text: CUT TO: DEADPOOL, WEDGING himself through the opening

text: cooperate, catching on the Plexiglas, stalling him mid-torso.
speaker_heading: DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
dialog: Little help?
text: The cabbie grabs Deadpool's hand and pulls him through to the

dialog: Ah yes. Gita. She is quite lovely. She
dialog: was supposed to make me a very agreeable

speaker_heading: DOPINDER

text: Two heavyset MEN climb down and head toward the back of the

text: AJAX and ANGEL DUST stand just inside, boxes and gear piled

text: Wade's eyes are lit with fire. DOWN the tank COMES, again
text: and AGAIN. Ajax takes his own fire extinguisher to the CHIN.
text: Then catches a BLOW from the oxygen TANK to his TEMPLE.

speaker_heading: AJAX
dialog: Say it. `Francis.'

text: Deadpool snatches up a piece of rusted RAILING from the deck,
text: barely blocks Ajax's windmilling swings.
text: Finally, Ajax smashes the length of rusty metal from
text: Deadpool's hands with one axe, while the sharp CLAW END of
text: the other buries itself in Deadpool's FOREARM. Deadpool
text: hollers.
text: Deadpool's red suit has torn away, and the SKULL of his

speaker_heading: DEADPOOL (CONT'D)

dialog: (holds up an INCISOR)
dialog: I just knocked out your tooth.

text: Vanessa grabs the KATANA, jerks it free with another mighty
text: effort. Then slides down the containers toward AJAX. With a
text: fierce scream, she PLUNGES the blade into his KIDNEY. The
text: blade punches through the other side but Ajax feels no pain,

speaker_heading: ANGEL DUST
dialog: C'mere, ya little bitch.
text: NTW fights back valiantly, PUNCHING fast and hard with

text: around the neck, plants her into the ground...
text: ...and begins to CHOKE the life out of her. NTW flails,
dialog: cannot break Angel Dust's grip...

text: Deadpool scrambles and claws up the tilting floor and grabs
dialog: hold of Vanessa.
text: Deadpool looks around frantically...

text: Deadpool grabs the side as it slides past and throws VANESSA
text: inside and SHUTS the LID for protection...
text: They slam into the twisted metal railings at the bottom of
