text: New immigrant families stand in ticket lines next to body-
text: pierced teens. Dozens of languages fly through the air, none
dialog: of them English. This is the crossroads of the world for the
text: down and out, hard luck and New York on 5 dollars a day crowd.
text: Witness to it all is a grey~bearded BLACK HOMELESS VETERAN who
text: sits with his prosthetic leg parked beside him.
speaker_heading: VET
dialog: Dollar fo' a homeless vet. Help out

dialog: (as a student with a

text: He pauses for a moment, with a curious expression, as someone
text: else catches his eye ...
text: A BEAM OF HAZY SUNLIGHT shines down through one of the high
text: arched windows of the terminal building ...
text: onto a MAN. Or an apparition.
text: The VET squints, closely ...
text: as the FIGURE seems to emerge from the sunlight. Dark,
text: wraparound SUNGLASSES mark his placid face. He wears corduroy
text: pants, a faded denim shirt. And though he carries no luggage;
text: his cheap canvas shoes look like they've got some miles on
dialog: them.
dialog: We will come to know this "man" as PROT. For now, he just
text: stands there, taking everything in with the fascination of a
text: tourist, as the crowd bustles around him.
text: Suddenly - in front of the rest rooms ~
text: TWO YOUNG THUGS bump into a middle-aged RUSSIAN WOMAN. One

speaker_heading: CONTINUED
speaker_heading: 1 CONTINUED:
text: As she screams for help, they run off -

text: caution. Then, he turns to the woman.
text: She is on the ground, dazed and sobbing, while everyone steps
text: quickly around her.
text: Prot approaches her. The vet keeping a careful eye on him.
text: Prot stops, standing over the woman. She looks up at his dark
text: glasses, stocky shoulders, fearfully. But as he holds his
text: hand out, and offers a smile ... her fear is strangely allayed.
speaker_heading: PROT
dialog: Here, let me help you.
