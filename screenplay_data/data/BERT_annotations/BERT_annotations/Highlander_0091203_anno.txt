scene_heading: 1 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 1
text: Garish purple light spills out of side-street porno houses,
text: illuminating a silhouette, and little else, of a MAN leaning
text: against an alley wall.
text: He is waiting.
text: Another silhouetted FIGURE appears and approaches the first.
text: They size each other up as best they can.
speaker_heading: FIRST MAN
dialog: MacLeod.
text: The second nods.
text: The first without hesitation raises a sword, the intended
text: thrust interrupted by his own death as the second with a flash
text: of metal severs the agressor's head.
scene_heading: 2 INT. HUTCH - MORNING 2
text: A 15th century Scottish home.
text: A haggard WOMAN, her small CHILD clinging to a tattered apron,
text: stands hunched over a glowing hearth. Her veined hands drag
text: a wooden spoon around and around through a soot-covered pot
text: of grey soup.
text: From an adjoining room CONOR MACLEOD, a young man dressed up
text: in his best traditional Celtic tartan, enters.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: My, but are you the
dialog: picture.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: (surveying himself)
dialog: It's a bit tight.
text: His FATHER enters with a pail of milk.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Ah, Conor, how you look
text: a man.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Have you time for some-
dialog: thing to eat?
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: No, Mother. They'll be
dialog: here shortly.
text: Conor's father looks him over with pride.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Your grandfather wore
dialog: that in his service to
dialog: the King, and I to fight
dialog: for the Duke.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Must he go?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Aye. It is his duty. All
dialog: of ours.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
text: But Ian, he's still but a boy.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: He's a MacLeod.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: I'll be fine Mother.
scene_heading: 3 EXT. HUTCH - MORNING 3
text: Several HORSEMEN gallop up through the early morning fog to
text: the cottage door.
text: Conor's father steps out to meet them.
scene_heading: 4 EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING 4
text: A massive KNIGHT sits astride his horse, moorish dew cling-
text: ing to his helmet and breastplate. A CLANSMAN hikes up the
text: heather-carpeted slope to him.
speaker_heading: CLANSMAN
text: They march.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: Is the boy among them?
speaker_heading: CLANSMAN
dialog: Aye.
scene_heading: 5 EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 5
text: The second kneels to examine the headless body of the first.
text: With a CLACK a window, high on the alley wall, closes.
scene_heading: 6 EXT. HIGHLAND PLAIN - MORNING 6
text: The DUKE is leading a brigade of CLANSMEN out onto the plain.
text: Mounted VASSALS ride back and forth inspecting the line. The
text: low fog makes it impossible to see beyond a few yards. There
text: is an erie, smothering silence.
speaker_heading: VASSAL #1
dialog: Is a bad day for this.
speaker_heading: VASSAL #2
dialog: The Duke has been compro-
dialog: mised. He will have his due.
speaker_heading: VASSAL #1
dialog: By day's end he will have
dialog: our heads.
speaker_heading: VASSAL #2
dialog: We ride against the Suther-
dialog: lands. That is all that
dialog: matters.
speaker_heading: VASSAL #1
dialog: This makes no sense to me.
speaker_heading: CONOR
text: And a friend are marching through the moist heather.
speaker_heading: FRIEND
dialog: The fog is bad. We cannot
dialog: even see the sides of our
dialog: own ranks.
text: Conor's nervousness is showing.
speaker_heading: FRIEND
dialog: Is this your first?
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: Aye.
text: SHOUTING is heard on the plain.
speaker_heading: FRIEND
dialog: It's begun.
scene_heading: 7 EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING 7
text: The Knight, above the fog, hears the battle commence below.
text: He spurs his horse and starts down into the mist.
scene_heading: 8 EXT. PLAIN - MORNING 8
text: The two opposing clans are now one confused mass of tartan
text: and clashing swords. The air is charged with SHOUTS of ex-
text: citement, agony, and the SHRILL of bag pipes.
text: The fog has made each man's battle his own, each isolated with
dialog: his opponent.
speaker_heading: THE KNIGHT
text: Rides calmly through the fracas. He strikes and kills those
text: that assault him, but appears disinterested in battle.
text: He is looking.
speaker_heading: CONOR
text: Is standing above the twitching body of his friend.
text: Alone and confused, Conor has become seperated from the clan.
text: He stumbles through the fog, seeking help.
text: Suddenly he is alone with the Knight.
text: The face of iron locks its gaze onto the boy. His fear turned
text: to panic, Conor turns and flees.
text: The Knight, his resolve steeled in a raised sword, kicks his
text: horse into persuit.
text: Conor is easily overtaken and on his first pass the Knight
text: brings his blade down hard into Conor's shoulder, slicing
text: open most of the boy's back and knocking him face-first into
dialog: the heather.
text: As Conor watches his own blood spew forth, he rolls over in
text: time to see the Knight dismount and start for him.
speaker_heading: THE KNIGHT
text: Leans down next to Conor, his metal face nearly against the
text: boy's. His voice slithers out of the iron in almost a whisper.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: There can be but one.
speaker_heading: A CLANSMAN
text: Charges out of the fog and attacks the Knight, who cuts him
text: nearly in half. ANOTHER wanders in and meets the same fate.
text: The battle is shifting to where they are.
text: Not finished yet with Conor, the Knight is finding himself
text: forced into retreat from an ever increasing number of assail-
dialog: ants.
speaker_heading: A VASSAL
text: Sees his men being hacked apart trying to stop the now-mounted
dialog: Knight.
speaker_heading: VASSAL #1
dialog: Leave him!
text: The clansmen obey.
text: With the slap of an armored gauntlet against his steed, the
text: Knight disappears into the fog.
text: The Vassal surveys the carnage before him. His eyes fall a
text: moment on the moaning, gurgling Conor.
text: The Vassal turns and leaves the boy for dead.
scene_heading: 9 EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 9
text: A patrol car pauses at the mouth of the alley.
text: The figure considers his situation, then quickly shoves his
text: sword into a near-by drain. He straightens up and waits.
speaker_heading: AN OFFICER
text: Steps out of his unit and cautiously walks forward. His PARTNER
text: switches on the patrol car's side lamps, bathing the alley
text: in a harsh glare.
scene_heading: MAN IN ALLEY
text: For the first time we can see his face. RICHARD TAUPIN, clad
text: in a well-cut business suit, looks exactly like Conor.
text: The police officer, upon seeing the body, grabs instinctively
text: for his pistol. He yells to his partner now coming into the
dialog: alley.
speaker_heading: OFFICER #1
dialog: Kevin! Get is a backup.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: I was merely walking by
dialog: when-
speaker_heading: OFFICER #1
dialog: Don't move.
text: The officer has his pistol out and leveled.
text: His partner runs up, shotgun in hand.
speaker_heading: OFFICER #2
text: They're on their way.
text: His voice cuts short as the blood flows against his shoe.
speaker_heading: OFFICER #2
dialog: Christ.
scene_heading: 10 INT. HUTCH - NIGHT 10
text: Conor lies moaning on a cot. Makeshift bandages wrap his
text: body, stained and pasted by thick, dried blood.
text: The family surrounds their dying son.
text: A PRIEST is delivering the last rites.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: ...Libera Domine Animan

scene_heading: 11 EXT. HUTCH - NIGHT 11
text: A Vassal rides up to the hutch, dismounts, and approaches a
text: CLANSMAN standing in the open doorway.
speaker_heading: VASSAL #1
dialog: Has the boy died?
speaker_heading: CLANSMAN
text: He is having the last rites
dialog: now. It should be over by
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: VASSAL #1
dialog: Never seen anybody cut as
dialog: bad live so long. He should
dialog: have died on the field.
speaker_heading: CLANSMAN
dialog: Tonight or tomorrow, it's
dialog: all the same.
text: The Vassal peers inside at the priest administering the
dialog: sacraments.
speaker_heading: PRIEST

speaker_heading: VASSAL #1
dialog: This has been a dark day.
speaker_heading: PRIEST

scene_heading: 12 EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 12
text: There is a bustle of activity. Setting up barricades, uni-
text: formed OFFICERS are trying to keep NEW CREWS and curious
text: ONLOOKERS at a distance.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE LT. MORAN
text: Lean, fortyish, and comfortable with the gore in front of him,
text: is inspecting the corpse with a MEDICAL EXAMINER.
speaker_heading: EXAMINER
dialog: (studying body)
dialog: Real clean. No sawing
dialog: action at all. Whatever
dialog: it was did it in one
text: swipe.
dialog: (looks up at Moran)
dialog: Like the other one.
text: Moran gestures to a sword, wrapped in plastic, lying nearby.
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: What about that?
speaker_heading: EXAMINER
dialog: Hasn't any blood on it.
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: About the only thing
dialog: that doesn't.
speaker_heading: EXAMINER
dialog: I'll give it a closer
dialog: look when I get back.
scene_heading: BRENNA CARTWRIGHT
text: Pretty but not beautiful, thirtyish, she exudes a sort of
dialog: insolent intelligence.
text: An OFFICER sees her duck under a police barricade.
speaker_heading: OFFICER #3
dialog: Come on Brenna, you know
dialog: better than that.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: I'm invited.
text: She walks to where the medical examiner is organizing his
dialog: equipment.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: (greeting)
dialog: Mr. Levine...
text: The examiner turns and smiles.
speaker_heading: EXAMINER
dialog: Hope this isn't past your
dialog: bedtime.
text: Brenna looks to the now-sheeted corpse, blood flowing from
dialog: where the head should be.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Doesn't have a head,
dialog: does he?
speaker_heading: EXAMINER
text: This one came unassembled.
text: Lt. Moran is standing near.
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: (no warmth)
dialog: Just show her what she came
dialog: for, Tom.
speaker_heading: EXAMINER
text: (stands, taps Brenna's arm)
dialog: Come on, this is more
dialog: your line of work.
text: Brenna and the examiner walk the few yards from the corpse
text: to the sword.
speaker_heading: EXAMINER
dialog: How's your uncle? I hardly
dialog: ever see him anymore.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Fine.
text: The examiner stops and gestures to the weapon clothed in
text: forensic plastic.
speaker_heading: EXAMINER
dialog: There you go.
text: Brenna's expression changes to interest as she kneels down
text: beside it.
speaker_heading: EXAMINER
dialog: Didn't look like it came from
dialog: "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I
dialog: called you.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
text: (looks up in Moran's direction)
dialog: Didn't think it was my
dialog: buddy over there.
speaker_heading: EXAMINER
dialog: Figured you knew more about
dialog: swords than I did.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Claymore.
speaker_heading: EXAMINER
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Scottish claymore. Take
dialog: a French epee, add twenty
dialog: pounds of ballast so it
dialog: means business, and you've
text: got a claymore.
speaker_heading: EXAMINER
dialog: You're the expert.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
text: (runs hand along hilt, slightly
dialog: confused)
text: It's in good condition.
speaker_heading: RICHARD TAUPIN
text: Is being put in the rear of a patrol car. Brenna studies his
text: face in the half-gloom. There's something different about him.
text: A steadiness.
scene_heading: 13 INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM 13
text: Richard Taupin is seated at a graffitti scrawled table in a
text: room otherwise bare of furnishings. He seems unphased by his
dialog: surroundings.
text: The door opens and Moran enters with bag and notebook. He
text: picks up Taupin's wallet on the table top and checks the
dialog: driver's license.
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: This your present address?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: Mr.-
dialog: (looks at license)
dialog: Taupin, what were you
dialog: doing in that alley?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: I was walking by when I
dialog: heard a shout. Your men
dialog: came right after.
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: Did you know the victim?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: His name was Iman Fasil
dialog: if that jogs your memory.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: It doesn't.
speaker_heading: MORAN
text: He was carrying a Syrian
dialog: passport and had been in
dialog: the country less than a week.
text: Taupin's face is stoic and controlled.
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: Two days ago a Bulgarian
dialog: national was murdered the
dialog: same way. He'd also been
dialog: in the country less than a
dialog: week.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What is your citizenship?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: American.
text: Moran paces to a corner of the room.
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: Do you make a habit of
dialog: hanging out in that neigh-
dialog: borhood at night?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: What are you getting at?
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: Let's just say that in my
dialog: years with this department
dialog: I've seen more than one well
dialog: dressed business man look for
text: a hand job on 14th Street.
text: Moran places both hands on the table and leans across it.
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: What were _you_ looking for?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: That's none of your business.
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: You're wrong.
text: Moran reaches into a bag on the table and removes a large
text: broad sword; old, but in mint condition.
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: Do you know what this is?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: I presume it's a sword.
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: A claymore to be exact. You
dialog: wouldn't know anything about
dialog: it would you?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Your murder weapon?
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: It was covered with Mr.
text: Fasil's fingerprints, but
text: none of his blood.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
text: A mystery.
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: For the moment.
text: Moran turns the sword over in his hand then sets it down.
text: He rises and opens the door.
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: All right Mr. Taupin, we'll be in
dialog: touch.
text: Taupin passes through the doorway without comment.

scene_heading: 15 EXT. CONOR'S FAMILY HUTCH - DAY 15
text: A medieval sun beats down on an OLD TRAVELER making his way up
text: the MacLeod home. Conor's mother, scrubbing clothes in a
text: bucket, smiles in recognition.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
speaker_heading: TRAVELLER
dialog: I only just heard of Conor. I came
dialog: up from Catroch as soon as I could.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: You're a kind man to be sure.
speaker_heading: TRAVELLER
dialog: I thought it only proper to pay
dialog: me last respects to the family.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Steven, Conor didn't die.
speaker_heading: TRAVELLER
dialog: But I had heard his wounds were
dialog: mortal.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: They were Steven, they were. It's
dialog: been a miracle it has. He lasted
text: right through and healed. No one
dialog: in the village has ever seen anything
dialog: like it. Ever.
scene_heading: 16 EXT. MEADOW - DAY 16
text: Perched on a heather-carpeted rise above the village a young
text: woman, MARA, sits contemplating the intricaces of a daffodil.
text: Balancing on a shepard's staff, Conor limps over and puts
text: his lips to her ear.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: You're pretty today.
text: Mara is silent. Distant.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: I'm your future husband, remember?
speaker_heading: MARA
dialog: I have no future husband.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: I don't understand. Not a week
dialog: ago your father gave us his blessing.
text: This is difficult for her. Tears well in her eyes.
speaker_heading: MARA
dialog: My future husband died in battle
dialog: against the Sutherlands.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: What are you saying? I'm standing
dialog: here as real as you.
speaker_heading: MARA
dialog: You cannot be real, Conor. You had
text: the last rites. No man has been cut
dialog: half as bad and lived.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: But I did live.
speaker_heading: MARA
dialog: Live? In less than a week you're
text: prancing about the country like a
dialog: squirrel.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: So why the crazy talk? It's a
dialog: miracle it is. Saint Andrew has
text: smiled on me. On us.
speaker_heading: MARA
dialog: Some think not.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: MARA
dialog: There's rumor in the village.
dialog: Some call it magic.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: That's mad. Surely you don't
dialog: take their word?
speaker_heading: MARA
dialog: I don't know, Conor. It's not
dialog: natural. Maybe something has
dialog: touched you.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: You're sounding like that mad
dialog: woman, Widow Baggins.
speaker_heading: MARA
dialog: Me father has taken back my
dialog: hand.
text: He puts a hand to her cheek.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: Ah, Lassie...
text: She steps back.
speaker_heading: MARA
dialog: Please not be touching me, Conor.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: I'll not take that kind of talk
dialog: from you. From those others
dialog: below, maybe. But not from you.
speaker_heading: MARA
dialog: Leave me alone, Conor. Please.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: You're not talking sense, Mara!
text: Anger tumbles into exasperation.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: He steps for her. She moves away. Conor's face hardens with
dialog: resentment.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: If you send me away now, Mara,
dialog: I'll not come looking for you.
speaker_heading: MARA
dialog: (crying)
dialog: Do what you must.

speaker_heading: BRENNA

speaker_heading: TAUPIN

speaker_heading: BRENNA

speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: (impatient)
dialog: Miss Cartwright, what is it I can
dialog: do for you?
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: I'd like to ask you about the
dialog: claymore.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: It's not mine.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: It's quite rare you know, some-
dialog: thing so common in its time so
dialog: well looked after all these years.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Miss Cartwright, unless you have
dialog: come here to sell the sword,
dialog: there's very little I can help

dialog: me, I have a great deal of work

text: Brenna has taken a carving from the shelf.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Byzantine?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Basil the II.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
text: Charming guy, Basil. Once after

speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: -All but one out of a hundred, I

dialog: donkeys back home. Now if you will

text: A lonely, ancient room full of equal parts dust and oaken

text: stern portrait of some forgotten curator presides over propped
text: up feet, cold coffee, and half eaten sack lunches.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: I don't believe him.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: He's too cool. Too sharp. I

speaker_heading: RESEARCHER #1
dialog: Oh, has your penetrating research
dialog: on 9th Century Lithuanian dildos
dialog: suddenly made you an expert on the

speaker_heading: RESEARCHER #2
dialog: The cops bought it. They let him
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: What could they hold him for? I
dialog: think they're just waiting for
dialog: something concrete before they
dialog: haul him in for real. We should
dialog: look into it. He had to have
dialog: gotten that sword from somewhere.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: Hang on a sec, you did your little
dialog: favor for the boys downtown, I'm
dialog: sure your uncle and the rest are
dialog: perfectly capable of taking it
dialog: from here.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: I've seen nobleman swords that
dialog: weren't as well preserved. It's
dialog: just a hunk of peasant iron. Why
dialog: would he be carrying it around
dialog: in an alley?
speaker_heading: RESEARCHER #1
dialog: Here we go. Everytime there's a
dialog: murder in town we have to put up
dialog: with junior D.A.
speaker_heading: RESEARCHER #2
dialog: Must be genetic.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Someone should check him out.
dialog: Maybe a collection somewhere
dialog: got knocked over. He has one,
dialog: he might have two.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: You see that desk? _Your_ desk? You see
dialog: the crap piled up on it?
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Give it a rest Ned, huh?
speaker_heading: RESEARCHER #2
dialog: Might be interesting to see what

scene_heading: 24 INT. TAUPIN HOME 24
text: Like a spider Taupin pries open a window and slips silently

text: The home is dark and still.
text: Taupin creeps down the hallway and peers into the entryway.
text: There a MAN, dressed in a tuxedo jacket and nearly imperceptible
text: in the dim light, is crouched at the front door.
text: He is holding a sword.
text: Taupin removes a knife from his pocket and JUMPS the intruder.
text: The two STRUGGLE fiercely.
text: Taupin pins the intruder against the carpet and shoves his

speaker_heading: TAUPIN

text: Bulging eyes stare at him.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Where!
speaker_heading: INTRUDER
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: What name is he using?
text: Taupin presses the blade. A trickle of blood rolls down the
dialog: throat.
speaker_heading: INTRUDER
dialog: Smith. Carl Smith.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: How many came?
speaker_heading: INTRUDER
dialog: The last four.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: And the Bulgarian?
speaker_heading: INTRUDER
dialog: He got him.
dialog: (hoarse chuckle)
text: He always does. Eventually.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: He knows I'm here. How?
speaker_heading: INTRUDER
dialog: None of this would be happening
dialog: if you hadn't run...
text: The knife is pressed deeper.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: _Answer_ me.
speaker_heading: INTRUDER
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: We learned he'd found the immigration
dialog: notaries in Liverpool and traced them

speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: No thank you, I'm fine.
text: Kidell sips his own and looks over the binder page.
speaker_heading: KIDELL
dialog: He was unsual.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: KIDELL
dialog: Well, this is a small town, and
dialog: it was even smaller then. Most
dialog: all the babies I delivered were
dialog: from local families. Richard's
dialog: parents were just passing through
dialog: when his mother's time came. I

speaker_heading: BRENNA

speaker_heading: KIDELL

speaker_heading: BRENNA

speaker_heading: KIDELL

dialog: Suppose nobody does.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: I don't follow you.
speaker_heading: KIDELL
dialog: Poor little tyke didn't have a

speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: The boy _died_?
speaker_heading: KIDELL
dialog: Mother too. Sad case it was. The

speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Have you spoken to anyone else

speaker_heading: KIDELL
dialog: There was this one fella. Asked

text: Brenna puts on her best little-girl angelic smile, a smile her

speaker_heading: UNCLE JOE
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Forgers do it all the time. They
dialog: take the birth certificate of some-
dialog: one who died young and use it to
dialog: get legit I.D. Usually they carry
dialog: it long enough to pass some bad

speaker_heading: BRENNA

speaker_heading: UNCLE JOE
dialog: Call your mother. You never call her.
speaker_heading: OFFICER

speaker_heading: BRENNA
text: I can't figure out why he's doing it.
dialog: He's been Richard Taupin at least
dialog: since 1967. And the guys rich. You
dialog: should see the stuff he has in that shop.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
text: Maybe he's hiding from something.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Some guy named Smith was asking
dialog: about him in Church Hill. I passed
dialog: his name around with your buddies
dialog: downtown but they drew a blank. So
dialog: he isn't a cop. District anyway.
text: Dennis gets out of bed and begins putting on his uniform.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
text: Probably just some exec ducking
text: an ex-wife.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
text: Dr. Kidell had a picture in his

dialog: looked just like Richard. Even had

speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: How old is Richard?
speaker_heading: BRENNA
text: P.D. says 41, but he barely looks
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Find the father. That should clear
dialog: things up.
text: He buttons his shirt. Something occurs to him.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran
dialog: picked up the other night?
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: He'd want to know about all this.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Mr. Congeniality? Let him find his

speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: They found it.
text: The officer leads him down to the river where a headless BODY

speaker_heading: OFFICER
text: It was about fifty yards down-

text: A steeple-chase course lies shrouded in an Arlington fog.
text: Across the damp grass a lone horse, heaving clouds of warm

text: bringing horse and rider to a shuddering stop where Detective
text: Moran waits.
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: There's been another murder.
text: Taupin lifts his eyes to the suburban treeline.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: My condolences.
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: Where were you Tuesday night?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Home.
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: A neighbor saw your car leave.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: He's mistaken.
text: Taupin climbs down from his horse. Moran moves close.
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: Look, I don't know what the hell
dialog: you're up to, but I think I've got
dialog: a pretty good idea.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: MORAN
dialog: All I need is time.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: I've got all the time in the world.

scene_heading: INSERT COMPUTER SHEET
text: The police sheet has Taupin's name and motor vehicle record.
text: Below are listed four WILLIAM TAUPINS, their hometowns and
dialog: driving records. Richard Taupin's first driver permit was in

scene_heading: 36 EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY 36
text: Brenna steps out of her car at a small town cemetary.
text: Holding a slip of paper, she weaves her way through the shade
text: covered tombs of revolutionary heroes and their descendants.
text: On a small rise fresh dirt lies in careless piles around an

text: Richard Taupin stands at the mouth of the pit.
text: A coffin has been brutally pulled from the dirt and lies open

scene_heading: MICHAEL TAUPIN".
text: The casket is empty.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Someone beat you.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN

speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Grave robbers?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Probably.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: People like that rarely leave
dialog: business cards.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Does Carl Smith?
text: A flash of interest, quickly suppressed.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: I think you do. Better yet, I don't
dialog: think anything was stolen because
dialog: nothing was there in the first place.
dialog: And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is,
dialog: now knows that.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: You have an active imagination.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: I've been to Church Hill.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Miss Cartwright, you are
dialog: involving yourself in
dialog: matters that do not concern
dialog: you. I strongly suggest you

speaker_heading: BRENNA

speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: I have friends.

dialog: stop.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: What's wrong?
text: He holds up an open palm to silence her.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Your help may be unneccessary.
text: The air is still.
text: Taupin's face is expressionless. He listens intently. Sensing.
text: An unseen voice rides seemingly on the wind.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (o.s.)
dialog: Good afternoon, "Mr. Taupin".
text: Taupin whirls around to see a large man standing with broad
text: sword in hand. We have never seen the knight out of his armor
text: before, but this man certainly seems to fit the bill. Wearing
text: Levis and leather jacket in contrast to Taupin's expensive
text: business suit, he speaks with icy evenness from a face of stone.
text: Taupin, naked without his own sword, is trapped against a
text: marble wall.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: Long time.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Not so long.
text: The Knight is closing in on him, sword gripped in both hands.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: You've been here from the
dialog: start.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: My quarry grows clever with
text: age. And the others, incompetent.
text: The Knight throws Brenna a glance.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: Friend of yours?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Of sorts.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: I do hope she enjoys a good
dialog: show.
text: The Knight leans his whole body into a two-fisted swing,
text: clanging out a chunk of marble as Taupin ducks.
text: A second swipe also imbeds itself in stone.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: So now it ends.
text: A thrust cuts only air.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: Generation upon generation.
text: Tens of thousands of miles.
text: Taupin leaps behind a tree. The Knight cuts it nearly in half.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: You're the last, MacLeod.
dialog: Romirez, Lacroux, Neuvich,
dialog: those fools that followed
text: me, their heads all line my
dialog: shelf. All but yours.
text: Taupin drops to the ground in a shoulder roll to avoid a swipe.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: Can you feel it, MacLeod?
dialog: Can you _feel_ it!
text: Taupin grabs a tree branch and raps the Knight on the knee,
text: knocking him over.
text: The Knight quickly rights himself and cuts the branch from
dialog: Taupin.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: There can be but one.
text: He raises his blade.
text: An elderly WATCHMAN, shotgun cradled in his arms, stands in
text: the clearing.
speaker_heading: WATCHMAN
dialog: Hey! What's going on here?
text: The Knight pauses a split second then with decision launches
text: his sword spear-style firmly into the watchman's chest.
text: Taupin pushes past him to Brenna.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Run!
text: Brenna is frozen in shock.
text: Taupin shoves her roughly toward the gate.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Run!
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
speaker_heading: MACLEOD!
text: The Knight retrieves his sword from the watchman's body and

dialog: ing residential area.
scene_heading: 37 EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY 37

dialog: walk.

scene_heading: 38 INT. CHURCH 38
text: Brenna enters and collapses into a pew, her labored breathing
text: echoing off the high ceiling.
text: Taupin walks the length of an aisle to see that they are alone.
text: Satisfied, he leans against a banister and considers his sit-
dialog: uation.
text: Trying to recover her wind, Brenna has her eyes closed and
text: head against the back of the pew.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Jesus Christ.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: You'll be safe here. He won't

speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Tradition.
speaker_heading: BRENNA

dialog: in battle?
speaker_heading: CONOR

dialog: And but for a mark you are

speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: Aye.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: I should imagine that your

dialog: an explanation. And a solution.
dialog: Something isn't right.

speaker_heading: CONOR

dialog: I've got work stacking up. Get
dialog: in here right away.
text: Brenna stands and goes to the kitchen, returning with a glass
dialog: of wine.
dialog: Click.
dialog: Beep.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT'S VOICE
dialog: Brenna.
text: She freezes in her tracks.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT'S VOICE
dialog: My quarrel is not with you. Meet
dialog: me.
text: Brenna's eyes are glued on the machine.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT'S VOICE
dialog: We have much to talk of, you and
text: I. Answers for the young historian.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: O'Reily's. Tonight. I've grown to

scene_heading: SEVERAL LITTLE GIRLS

dialog: Happy birthday to you, happy birth-
dialog: day to you, happy birthday dear
dialog: Brenna, happy birthday to you.
text: Brenna is still upset from the last call.
speaker_heading: MOTHER'S VOICE
dialog: Hi Brenna, it's mom. Me and your neices
dialog: just wanted to call and wish you a
dialog: happy birthday. Crissy made a real cute

dialog: Hiss.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 45. INT. CONOR'S HOME - DAY 45
text: This HISS of Brenna's answering machine becomes the HISS of
text: cooking. Bandaged about the chest, Conor asleep on his
dialog: cot.
text: Suddenly he sits up. Sweating. He looks about the room in
text: confusion as Romirez enters with a plate of food.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: Three days you've laid there.
dialog: It's time you ate.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: (dazed)
dialog: This can't be.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: You are not dead, boy. Accept it.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: This is monstrous. I'll burn in
dialog: hell for all eternity.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: You'd have to die first.
dialog: (extends forkful of food)
dialog: Aqui.
text: Conor starts CRYING.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: What is to become of me? Am I to
dialog: wander the Earth forever like a
dialog: ghost?
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: You will live. Survive.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: Then they were right. I am evil.
dialog: This is God's punishment.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: You have done nothing wrong Conor
dialog: MacLeod.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: Oh my God. Oh my God I'm lost.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 46 EXT. CONOR'S VILLAGE - DAY 46
dialog: Two days later.
text: Nearly healed, Conor and Romirez stand near a quietly moving
dialog: stream.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: Why does he want to kill me?
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: You recall how I spoke of the push
dialog: you feel and how I make it less?
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: Aye.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: It is always less with my living.
dialog: Far or near. But if I were to die
dialog: the push would become stronger
dialog: than ever before. There is power
dialog: in this. And as long as you and I
dialog: live, The Knight can never have
dialog: it all.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: But we cannot be killed.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: There is an imperfection. For all
dialog: your healing, if your head ever
dialog: leaves your neck, you are dead.
dialog: You can survive anything but steel
dialog: against your threat. Then it is
text: over. The end.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: How can I stop such a man?
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: Hide. Run to the ends of the Earth
dialog: till you learn. You must learn to
dialog: defend yourself. In this I can help.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: We are brothers. And you are a
dialog: defense-

dialog: -of sorts.
scene_heading: 47 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA FARMHOUSE - DAY 47
text: An old man, MR. NORTH, leads Taupin up the drive of a rural
text: farmhouse somewhere in the hinterland of Pennsylvania.
speaker_heading: MR. NORTH
dialog: When your father died I saw to
dialog: it that the grounds were kept up.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: The money in the estate was
dialog: enough to cover your costs?
speaker_heading: MR. NORTH
dialog: Oh yes, more than enough.
scene_heading: 48 INT. FARMHOUSE 48
text: Furniture clad in white sheets. Dust everywhere.
speaker_heading: MR. NORTH
dialog: Most of the furniture was put
dialog: into protective storage. I'll
dialog: have some boys come up and clean
dialog: the place out for you.
text: Taupin drags a finger across a dusty window pane.
speaker_heading: MR. NORTH
dialog: (fascinated)
dialog: You're one of William's kids,
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: His only kid.
speaker_heading: MR. NORTH
dialog: Sure take after him. Never seen
text: a father and son look more alike.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: We were very close.
speaker_heading: MR. NORTH
dialog: The resemblance is amazing.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: When may I expect the cleaners?
speaker_heading: MR. NORTH
dialog: I'll send them right up.
scene_heading: 49 INT. "O'REILY'S" - NIGHT 49
text: Coupled strangers gyrate under colored lights and recorded music.
text: Brenna sits alone. Whatever nervousness she brought through the
text: door with her has been turned into a comfortable cynicism by
text: the three empty glasses in front of her.
speaker_heading: A MAN
text: With something less than perfect coordination, sits down beside
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: That stuff'll put you away if
dialog: you're not careful.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: There was a Count. Count Dusan. He
dialog: would invite the local peasants to
dialog: his chateau, fill them full of wine,
dialog: then slice their bellies so he
dialog: could reuse it.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: The symmetry of that somehow always
dialog: appealed to me.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You're very macabre.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: It's my birthday.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Happy birthday.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Thanks.
text: Brenna drains her glass and sets it down with a sigh.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Buy a birthday girl a drink?
scene_heading: 50 INT. PUB - NIGHT 50
text: A small neighborhood tavern. Regulars chat amicably with the
scene_heading: BARTENDER-OWNER.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
text: Sits alone at a corner table. A WAITRESS hovers over him.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
text: Lager and lime.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Taupin's lager is drained. Lost in thought, he drags a finger
text: around and around the lip of the mug.
text: He hand stops. It twitches. Shakes.
text: Taupin pulls his hand from the glass and watches it shake slightly
text: out of control. A warning.
text: He WHIRLS around suddenly to see LING KAHN, Asian, standing
text: over him.
speaker_heading: KAHN
dialog: MacLeod.
text: Taupin is anxious, poised for attack.
text: Kahn breaks into a broad smile.
speaker_heading: KAHN
dialog: Spare a chair?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Kahn?
speaker_heading: KAHN
dialog: Are you going to offer me a chair
dialog: or leave me standing here all night?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Sit.
text: Kahn takes his place across the table.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: (unsure)
dialog: How are you?
speaker_heading: KAHN
text: Head still secure to the neck.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: How did you find me?
speaker_heading: KAHN
dialog: How many places this side of the
dialog: Atlantic serve lager and lime?
text: Taupin looks to his own glass.
speaker_heading: KAHN
dialog: Old habits die hard.
dialog: (to waitress)
dialog: Waitress! A round of Nitzhic!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Peasant drool, I know. But it's the
dialog: closest thing they stock to my side
text: of the fence.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: KAHN
dialog: It is the gathering, my friend. The
dialog: settling of old scores.
text: Taupin tenses.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: And have you something to settle
dialog: with me?
speaker_heading: KAHN
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Not tonight. Tonight I have a drink
text: with an old friend.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: It's good to see you, Kahn.
text: The waitress sets down two glasses.
speaker_heading: KAHN
dialog: Come, toast with me the past.
dialog: (raises glass)
dialog: To old conquests, old loves, and to a
dialog: time when we cared about either.
text: Kahn drains his glass.
speaker_heading: KAHN
dialog: Waitress!
scene_heading: 51 EXT. THE WASHINGTON MALL - NIGHT 51
text: Kahn and Taupin sit drunkedly on the marble steps of a closed
dialog: government building.
speaker_heading: KAHN
dialog: I'll never forget the look on that
text: Papal commander's face when his
dialog: "heretic stronghold" turned out to
dialog: be a rock full of whores climbing
dialog: all over Neuvich.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
text: Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
speaker_heading: KAHN
text: But then rides up Pope Pius who
text: calmly brushes the dust from his
text: papal cross, climbs off his papal
text: horse, draws his papal sword and
dialog: asks just what the hell is going
dialog: on. And what did Neuvich, dear
dialog: dear drunken Neuvich do?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Offered the Pope one of his whores.
text: They LAUGH.
text: A JOGGER stops on the gravel and listens to the strange conversation.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
text: Had a great swing with his blade.
dialog: For a Pope.
speaker_heading: KAHN
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Good times then. A man could
dialog: stretch his legs without bring-
dialog: ing half the world down around
text: his ears. Not like now.
text: The jogger shakes his head and runs on.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: (serious)
dialog: He found us even there.
speaker_heading: KAHN
dialog: He always did.
scene_heading: 52 EXT. ZOO - NIGHT 52
text: A CLINKING of chain link as Taupin and Kahn climb a fence and
text: tumble into the Washington Zoo.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: I haven't drunk this much since-
speaker_heading: KAHN
dialog: -Since you last saw me.
text: Kahn chucks an empty wine bottle. An unspecified animal GROWLS
text: sleepily somewhere in the darkness.
speaker_heading: KAHN
dialog: Come on.
scene_heading: 53 EXT. DISPLAY AREA - NIGHT 53
text: Taupin and Kahn stumble through an open-air display of Asian
text: animals. Their VOICES seem to echo everywhere.
speaker_heading: KAHN
dialog: I love zoos. Ever since I was
text: a kid.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: You were never a kid.
text: Kahn leans on the wall of a water buffalo pen.
speaker_heading: KAHN
dialog: (points at one)
dialog: I knew his great-grandfather.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: You're insane.
speaker_heading: KAHN
dialog: No, seriously. We used to shoot pool
dialog: together in Rangoon.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: How do you do it, Kahn? How do you
dialog: live so full of life for so long?
speaker_heading: KAHN
dialog: Tasting and enjoying life is the
dialog: only thing of value we have. All
text: else is just marking time.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're marking time.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: I've had a few more concerns.
text: Kahn jams his hands into his overcoat and starts down the footpath.
speaker_heading: KAHN
dialog: The pressure only comes when you
dialog: let the taste slip into your mouth.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: You're wrong.
speaker_heading: KAHN
dialog: You don't run as hard, MacLeod.
dialog: You just don't run as hard anymore.
scene_heading: 54 INT. O'REILY'S - NIGHT 54
text: Late. The bar is nearly empty.
text: No sign of the Knight. Brenna looks at her watch, sighs, and
text: drops a bill onto the counter.
scene_heading: 55 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 55
text: Brenna has left the bar and is now walking down a dimly lit
dialog: street.
text: She hears something and turns.
text: -Nothing. A breeze rustles the trees above.
text: After only a few more paces she hears something again.
text: Brenna abruptly turns.
text: -Right into the face of THE KNIGHT.
text: Brenna SCREAMS. The Knight reaches into his leather carrying bag.
text: A GROUP OF NOISY TEENAGERS
text: Exit a facing townhouse. The Knight removes his hand from the
text: bag as they spill onto the sidewalk LAUGHING and YELLING.
text: Brenna moves close to the group as they walk to the corner.
text: The Knight follows at a measured distance.
text: At the corner the teenagers climb into a pickup and drive off.
text: Brenna bolts into the intersection. Weaving through SCREECHING
text: brakes, she disappears into a pair of lighted glass doors.
scene_heading: 56 INT. BUILDING 56
text: 40 well dressed PATRONS, numbered cards pinned to their lapels,
text: sit in velvetly plush surroundings. At the front of the room
text: stands a thin moustached art AUCTIONEER.
text: Brenna BUSTLES in from outside.
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: I apoligize for the lateness of the
dialog: hour, but I'm sure you will all agree
dialog: the quality of this year's collection
dialog: is well worth the time.
text: The Knight BURSTS in with his leather carrying bag. Brenna
text: slides along the draped back wall to avoid him.
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: (holding statuette)
dialog: For this fine example of medieval
dialog: religious art, let us open the bid
dialog: at 4,000 dollars.
text: The Knight closes in on Brenna casually, without hurry.
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: 10,500 once, 10,500 twice...
text: Brenna raises her arm to attract the attention of a SECURITY
text: GUARD..
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: (points at Brenna)
text: 11,000. A bid at 11,000.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: No, I-
text: The guard notices she has no lapel number and starts for her
dialog: very officially.
text: Being closed in on from both sides, Brenna suddenly runs across
text: the room to a fire exit, setting off an ALARM as she flies open
text: the door.
text: The Knight leaps after her, knocking over an OLD WOMAN in the
text: front row.
scene_heading: 57 EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT 57
text: Brenna runs the sidewalk and disappears into a Metro station.
scene_heading: 58 INT. METRO STATION 58
text: Brenna runs down the platform and jumps into a subway car
text: just as the doors shut.
speaker_heading: THE KNIGHT
text: is also now on the platform but can only watch Brenna through
text: a window as the train pulls away.
scene_heading: 59 EXT. TAUPIN'S TOWNHOUSE - DAY 59
text: Brenna KNOCKS at the front door. No answer.
text: She KNOCKS harder. The unlatched door pushes open.
scene_heading: 60 INT. TOWNHOUSE 60
text: Brenna stands in the doorway.
text: Before her is a disaster. Furniture has been smashed like
text: matchsticks. A desk drawer's contents lie strewn in piles on
text: the floor.
text: Brenna enters slowly.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Mr. Taupin? I have to talk to
dialog: you.
text: Nothing has been left unturned or unbroken.
text: Brenna kneels and sifts through a pile of crumpled papers.
text: She comes across an old black and white photograph. Badly
text: streaked and faded, it shows Taupin standing beside a farm-
text: house. Written in the corner is "Worstick, 1928".
text: Brenna slips the photo into her pocket. Standing, she turns
text: smack into Taupin.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Finished?
text: He looks past her to the destruction of his living room. It
text: doesn't seem to surprise him.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: He tried to kill me last night.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Dupont Circle.
text: Taupin sifts through the debris, selecting articles from it.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Who is he?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: At the moment? Carl Smith.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: And you?
text: He ignores the question.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: What will you do now?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: You needn't worry Miss Cartwright.
dialog: I've been at this a very long time.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: He called you "MacLeod".
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Not your concern.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: I left a man dead in
dialog: Felton. But you don't
dialog: really care, do you?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: That bothers you?
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: He was innocent.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: He's dead. Whatever I may
dialog: or may not feel means
dialog: exceedingly little to him
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: What about me?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: You?
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: I'm a witness to a murder. That
dialog: seems to put me pretty high
dialog: on your friend's chop list.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Have you gone to the
dialog: police?
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Why not? I'm sure they'd
dialog: love to hear your story.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: I'd rather hear yours.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You are being foolish.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin.
dialog: Only once in a lifetime do you
text: stare history in the face.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Go home.
text: He walks to the doorway.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Why does he want to kill you?
text: Taupin stops, his back to her.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: He sees me as a threat.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Are you?
text: Taupin walks out the door.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 61 EXT. GRASSY KNOLL - DAY 61
text: On a clear rise above the village Romirez and Conor spar with
text: swords covered in heavy cloth. Conor is having difficulty.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: Concentrate!
text: Conor thrusts. Romirez blocks.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: Harder. Concentrate harder.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: Me arm hurts.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: Again. Try again.
text: Conor strikes. Romirez easily blocks.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: Harder! You swing like an impotent
dialog: cow!
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: Go to hell.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: Oh, the boy has a mouth,
dialog: now if only he had an arm.
text: Ticked off, Conor leans himself into a two-fisted swing.
text: Romirez knocks it aside, but Conor recovers faster than he,
text: knocking Romirez flat on his back.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: Impotent cow.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: Muy Bien!
text: Conor drops the sword and wipes the sweat from his face.
text: Romirez pours wine from a leather bag into a goblet pulled
text: from his belt. He offers it to Conor.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: Here my boy, from vineyards
text: as sweet and smooth as a young
text: girl's thigh.
text: Conor accepts the cup. Romirez pulls himself to his feet.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: It will take less effort
dialog: as you learn.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: It's like to kill me first.
text: Romirez puts his arm around Conor and refills his cup.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: You have a gift. One you
dialog: must protect.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: And what is this great
dialog: gift that cannot be seen
dialog: or smelt?
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: The Fabric of life. The spark
dialog: that allows the passing of
dialog: existence from one generation
dialog: to another.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: (shakes head)
dialog: If that was meant to be an ex-
dialog: planation Mr. Romirez from Spain,
dialog: I'm afraid you've failed.
text: Romirez put his arm around Conor and leads him away.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: Come. Enough sword play for an
dialog: afternoon.
scene_heading: 62 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 62
text: A friendly horse race. Their reflections bouncing off a clear
text: glen, Conor and Romirez dodge moss-laiden ruts and leap fallen
text: tree trunks.
text: Beaming, Conor pushes through a last turn and stops to wait
text: for Romirez, several lengths behind.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: (as Romirez rides up)
dialog: You're no match for Scot, Mr.
dialog: Romirez. We're raised as riders.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
text: Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
text: Both their eyes turn to the beauty in view. Romirez pulls a
text: leaf from a tree and studies it closely.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: What is the fascinatioon? It is only
text: a leaf.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: All living things pay dues,
dialog: Conor. They must be respected
dialog: for that.
text: He pulls the leaf's points from the stalk, one by one.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: As they age they contribute to a
dialog: sum that is the kindling from which
dialog: all future life comes. To feel it,
dialog: to know it, is to be in touch with
dialog: the will of every living thing.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: I do not think I like the sound
dialog: of that.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: It does not feel nearly as frightening
dialog: as it sounds. But the consequences of
dialog: such feelings can be very frightening.
dialog: For it gives you great strength. The
dialog: strength of _knowledge_. The ability
dialog: to stand between the giving of what
dialog: has always been to what will always
dialog: be.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: I feel hardly nothing.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: You have not been fully trained.
dialog: But you will learn. And you will be
dialog: good, I can feel that. You have apt-
dialog: itude. This is why our friend is
dialog: so concerned.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: But why be so concerned about me?
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: This power is divided amongst you,
dialog: me, and others like cuts in a pie.
dialog: But the cuts are not equal. Some,
dialog: like you and he, have more. Much
dialog: more.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: And you?
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: I am a small player. But if by
dialog: helping you I can keep that monster
dialog: from being the last, then perhaps
dialog: my life has meant something.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: I am not ready for this.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: You must be. You have responsibilities.
dialog: You must learn the rules. You can never
dialog: attract attention to yourself, never
dialog: show the side that will draw others to
dialog: you. You will always know when you are
dialog: in the presence of another. Beware.
dialog: But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will
dialog: be your battle against time. In the
dialog: coming years you will see kingdoms rise
dialog: then rot like wheat. People will
text: become a transitory, pathetic lot. The
dialog: only constant you will know will be
dialog: the others and the tradition their
dialog: greed and quest represent. But life
dialog: without morality, without the ability
dialog: to truly taste the sweetness of wine
dialog: and love, is no life at all. That is
dialog: how the others exist. Nothing more
dialog: than walking corpses living only to
text: slaughter each other in an insane quest
dialog: to be the last. Keep your soul sewed
dialog: to the earth. Do not become one of them.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: You are young, inexperienced. You
dialog: do not know what time can do. How
dialog: it can sap all pity, all love.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: That is not me.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
text: With the proper tools, Conor, a
dialog: naive man can be much more dangerous
dialog: than an evil one.
speaker_heading: VILLAGER
dialog: Conor!
text: A VILLAGER approaches from across the pasture.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: Yes, Darin.
speaker_heading: VILLAGER
dialog: Hate to be bothering you like this,
dialog: but me mare threw a shoe.
text: Conor looks to Romirez.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: Go ahead, Senor.
dialog: (gestures to wine)
dialog: I have my friend to keep me company.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: I'll be back when I can.
text: Conor sets off across the pasture.
scene_heading: 64 INT. CONOR'S HOME 64
text: Romirez enters and flops onto a cot.
text: Settling down for a nap, he sets his sword beneath the bed
text: and closes his eyes to the distant sound of CHILDREN playing.
text: The room is still.
text: Romirez begins to drowse.
text: Suddenly his eyes leap open with full alertness.
text: His hand moves under the cot.
text: With an EXPLOSION the front door is lifted from its hinges
text: and splintered into fragments. Passing through a cloud of
text: sawdust enters the Knight. Without pause he topples a kitchen
text: shelf onto a supine Romirez.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: Romirez. What a surprise.
text: Romirez is struggling under the debris.
text: The Knight thrusts hard onto an exposed leg.
text: The limb is severed.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: Madonna!
text: The Knight begins casting aside the shelving.
text: With lightning speed Romirez pulls the sword from beneath the
text: bed and hammers it deep into the Knight's side.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: Bastard!
text: He crashes back against the wall.
text: Romirez tries to lift himself from the bed using his sword
text: as a crutch.
text: The Knight has regained a meager balance on his knees.
text: Blood pours from the slice in his stomach,
text: Romirez pushes himself across the bed, plants his sword into
text: the floor and hobbles a few paces before collapsing.
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: Oh, Santa Maria!
text: The Knight crawls across the bed and drops to his knees
text: beside Romirez.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: Why run?
speaker_heading: ROMIREZ
dialog: Demonio!
text: The Knight's trembling hands raise his shaking sword high.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: To hell with you.

scene_heading: 66 EXT. CONOR'S HOME - DAY 66

speaker_heading: LIBRARIAN

speaker_heading: LIBRARIAN

speaker_heading: BRENNA

speaker_heading: KNIGHT

speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM

speaker_heading: TAUPIN

scene_heading: 99 INT. TAUPIN'S FARMHOUSE 99

speaker_heading: BRENNA

speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: It will take some time for the

speaker_heading: TAUPIN

speaker_heading: BRENNA

text: Taupin stacks the documents into a folder.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN

speaker_heading: TAUPIN

speaker_heading: BRENNA

speaker_heading: TAUPIN

speaker_heading: KATHERINE

speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: All right.

speaker_heading: CONOR
text: A lion.
dialog: (growls)

speaker_heading: CONOR

speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Something pretty.
speaker_heading: CONOR

speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN

speaker_heading: CONOR

speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: You think you're so high and

speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: (moving closer)

speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: You'd like that, wouldn't you?
dialog: (to Katherine)
dialog: Ask him about his friends. The

dialog: Ask him about the blade he keeps

text: Conor grabs the youth's collar and pulls him close.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: (like ice)
dialog: Leave. While you still can.
text: The youth pushes away from the grasp.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: You don't frighten me.
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: I should.

speaker_heading: KATHERINE

speaker_heading: MR. NORTH
dialog: Mr. Taupin! Glad you could make it.
dialog: Best get some punch before it's

speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: His son. Richard.
speaker_heading: MR. NORTH

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Your father died some years ago.

speaker_heading: TAUPIN

speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Good evening, Mrs. Butler.

speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: What was all that about?
speaker_heading: MR. NORTH
dialog: Sorry Mr. Taupin. That's not meant
dialog: for you. Just some didn't take
dialog: much to your father.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: My father was never one for social
text: whirls.
speaker_heading: MR. TAUPIN
text: Kept to himself for sure. Then with
dialog: all that business in '31.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: What business?
speaker_heading: MR. NORTH
text: Family down the road from the
dialog: Taupin place was murdered. All
text: cut up they were. Horrible. Two
dialog: strangers were also found with
dialog: the bodies. No one ever accused
dialog: William, but with his reputation
text: as a loner and the rumors about
dialog: him and some of the wives in town,
dialog: folks just never forgot. Most
dialog: were relieved when they heard he'd
dialog: died. Sorry Mr. Taupin.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Nothing to be sorry about.
speaker_heading: MR. NORTH
dialog: Just your pappy scared some.

speaker_heading: PORTLY
dialog: All right, the kids have had their

speaker_heading: BRENNA

speaker_heading: TAUPIN

speaker_heading: BRENNA

speaker_heading: TAUPIN

speaker_heading: BRENNA

speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: No. Just the child of

speaker_heading: BRENNA

speaker_heading: BRENNA

speaker_heading: TAUPIN

speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: I hope I never get that old.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: You won't.
text: Brenna pulls away.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: I must be insane. Leaving work,

text: but a murderer just the same.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Why are you here?
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: I've been telling myself it's the
dialog: award winning journal article I'm

text: (looks at him squarely)
dialog: It's you.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: BRENNA

speaker_heading: TAUPIN

speaker_heading: BRENNA

speaker_heading: TAUPIN

scene_heading: 106 INT. HIDDEN ROOM 106

text: The room is massive, a cross between a museum and an old attic.
text: Suits of armor, Italian statuettes, Czech ironworks, Persian
text: fetishes and a thousand other oddities from a hundred eras
text: crowd the shelving and floor space.
text: The room has the look of ownership, as if civilization had

speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: My God.
text: The sight is overwhelming.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: I had this room built some

speaker_heading: BRENNA

speaker_heading: TAUPIN

speaker_heading: BRENNA

speaker_heading: TAUPIN

speaker_heading: TAUPIN

speaker_heading: BRENNA

speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: He is older than I.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: What could possibly be worth all
dialog: this murder and distruction.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Sometimes I think it's just for
dialog: something to do. A conquest to
dialog: be the last. Something to hold
text: onto while everything else around
dialog: you withers and blows away. Some-
dialog: thing to replace the love that can
dialog: never work.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: That's insane.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Perhaps. There is something more.
dialog: An inheritance.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Of bodies.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: I didn't kill the watchman.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: You killed those other two.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Not the same.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: What about that family in '31?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN

text: tameter while hacking up all

speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: There are differences.
speaker_heading: BRENNA

speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Leave her out of this.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: As you wish.

text: pulled back into battle position.
text: The two begin walking a circle, poised swords waiting for an
dialog: opening.
text: The Knight leaps first, his clash of steel RINGING off the high
dialog: walls.
text: Another ATTACK without result.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT

dialog: brows.

text: The Knight and Taupin are PANTING heavily.
text: The Knight goes low. Taupin blocks. The Knight comes overhead
text: quickly. Taupin misjudges and the blade slices deep into his
text: shoulder and chest. The impact knocks him flat on his back.
text: The Knight looks down on his wounded prey.

text: are coming up the steps.

dialog: No. Not now.

dialog: Get up.
text: Taupin looks at Brenna and the dead policemen. A resignation
text: sweeps over him.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: What's the point?
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: This isn't done. Get up.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: What's the point! You have me,
dialog: finish it!
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: I have waited forever for this.
dialog: You will not cheapen it, little
dialog: boy.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: (irony)
dialog: Tradition.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: It's all we have.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Go to hell.
text: The Knight looks to Brenna.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like
dialog: to play.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Leave her alone.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: Get up.
text: Taupin struggles to his feet. Blood pouring from his shirt, he
text: stands uneasily with his sword at ready.
text: The Knight swings. Taupin blocks.

text: ajar.
scene_heading: 132 INT. MEMORIAL - NIGHT 132
text: Taupin is badly outclassed.

text: him again to the floor.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: You bastard!
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: Be silent.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Leave him alone.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: You will be silent!!
text: The voice is THUNDERING.

text: The Knight smiles.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: I do hope you're enjoying this
dialog: as much as me.
speaker_heading: MORAN
text: Stands in the entryway. The Knight sees him.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: Get out.
text: Moran draws his pistol.
text: The Knight walks toward him,
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: This is nothing that concerns you.
text: Moran levels his gun.
text: The Knight raises his sword.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: You will leave!
text: Two EXPLOSIONS as Moran FIRES. The slugs slam into the Knight,
text: blowing him off his feet.
text: He lies still.
text: Moran looks to Brenna. To Taupin. Then he walks closer to the
dialog: Knight.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: (hoarse)
dialog: Don't.
text: Taupin curls in a spasm of pain.
text: Moran moves closer.
text: The Knight lies face down, blood oozing from exit wounds over
text: his heart. He isn't breathing.
text: Moran bends over slowly to see the Knight's face.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Stop. You don't understand.
text: The Knight suddenly rolls over and plants his sword into Moran's
text: chest. The pistol DISCHARGES against a far wall.
text: Taupin crawls for the Knight.

text: pouring from his mouth and nose, thrusts deeper then retracts
dialog: quickly.
text: Moran slides off the sword dead.
text: Taupin CUTS hard against the Knight's chest. The Knight GAGS
text: in surprise and crumples. Taupin CUTS again, then puts the
text: blade against the Knight's GURGLING throat.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: In mamus tuas Domine commendo
dialog: spiritum meum. Auditorium nostrum
dialog: in nomine Domine.
text: He raises the sword.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
text: Requiescant in pace.
text: And CUTS the Knight's head off.
text: Taupin drops his sword.
text: His breathing quickens.
text: A sensation sweeps over him.
text: Taupin drops to the floor WHIMPERING. He sucks in painful gulps
dialog: of air.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: My God.
text: Taupin bolts up and looks at her without seeing.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Conor.
text: Taupin is looking past her.
text: A blood-stained hand suddenly GRABS Brenna's shoulder. She
text: SCREAMS. The headless body of the Knight stands beside her.
text: THE KNIGHT'S HEAD
text: Lies on the floor.
text: The eyes open. The face pulls into a smile.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: And now you know.
text: The eyes roll up into the skull. The face slackens.
text: The hulking mass standing beside Brenna sways, the collapses
text: to the ground.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
text: Is CRYING. Not from wounds he no longer feels, but from something
dialog: else.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: I can't stand it. Oh God, I can't
dialog: stand it!
text: Brenna kneels beside him.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: The scream of your blood. The
text: shriek of trees. Stop it! Stop it!
dialog: Brenna SOBS.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: I'm the last. Oh Christ, I'm the
dialog: _last one_!
text: Taupin doubles over in pain. The pain of the whole world trying
text: to force itself into him.
text: Brenna tries to hold him. He pushes her savagely away.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Get out.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: I'll destroy you. I've destroyed
dialog: everything I've ever touched! Oh
dialog: God...
text: He doubles over in pain.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: Conor...
text: He grabs his sword and threatens her.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: _Get out_!
text: SOBBING, Brenna runs from the memorial. Taupin is alone.
text: Bleeding. Crying. In agony.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: FADE UP:
scene_heading: 133 INT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM 133
text: Brenna at work in the research area. She's silent. Distant.
text: Something is missing from her.
scene_heading: 134 EXT. GEORGETOWN STREET - DAY 134
text: Brenna stands in the street before Taupin's townhouse.
text: A boarded up window. A for-sale sign. Taupin is gone forever.
text: As if he never was.
scene_heading: 135 INT. BRENNA'S APARTMENT 135
text: A desk. A single light. A cup of coffee.
text: A typewriter.
text: Brenna tries to force thoughts to the surface. CLACK-CLACK.
text: It is at last her journal article. She types a line, then rips
text: it from the carriage and tears it to pieces.
dialog: The thoughts won't come.
scene_heading: 136 EXT. WASHINGTON MALL - DAY 136
text: Brenna sits on the expanse of grass throwing scraps to a group
dialog: of wild park cats.
text: A shadow covers her face. She looks up.
dialog: It is Taupin.
text: Something has changed him. His face is less cynical. More
text: vulnerable. More human.
text: He sits down on the grass beside her.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: What are we supposed to say?
text: The cat's eyes are all fixed in Taupin. They cautiously shrink
text: away, frightened.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: The emptyness. The years and years
text: of void. Nothingness. Bordered only
text: by the quest for ultimate nothingness.
dialog: Who would have guessed?
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: The inheritance.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Not power. Not control.
text: Taupin holds a blade of grass as if it was speaking to him.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Life. It is the gift and the under-
dialog: standing of life.
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: You have lived forever.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: Life is only life when it is bounded
dialog: by death. The inheritance is death.
dialog: The gift is the finality of life.
text: To be part of the fabric. The inside.
dialog: (turns to Brenna)
dialog: I love you Brenna.
text: Brenna's chin quivers.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: It will be horrible. The future. I
dialog: may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows.
dialog: I can promise you nothing. Nothing
dialog: but a moment. Maybe two. But a moment
dialog: of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
speaker_heading: BRENNA
dialog: (crying)
dialog: Yes.
text: He holds her. They hold each other.
speaker_heading: TAUPIN
dialog: It's taken me so long. So very
dialog: long.
text: A jogger runs by, unaware of any life but his own.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: _END_
