dialog: At least not for football!
text: Laughter.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Anyway, some people came to me and said
dialog: they wanted to throw a little send-off.
text: There is a sudden murmur in the audience. Iris stops.
text: Holland looks around. Two Highway Patrolmen can be seen in
text: the back of the gymnasium.
speaker_heading: TRIS
dialog: Looks like my watch is fast.
text: The murmur in the audience increases. A few words are
text: audible. "The Governor... “It's the Governor!" “Here!*

speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: Thank you, Mrs. Holland. My apologies to
dialog: everyone for my tardiness. And Principal
dialog: Wolters, I'd like you to know, yes, I
dialog: brought a note from my mother.
text: Wolters smiles, chagrined.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: I came here today to say thanks to Mr.
dialog: Glenn Holland. First things first. Mr.
dialog: Holland, I want you to know as soon as I
dialog: get back to my office, I'm going to start
text: pounding away at the Legislature to
dialog: restore state funding for all High School
dialog: music programs in this state.
text: for the applause to die down.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: Mr. Holland had a profound influence on
dialog: my life. On a lot of lives, I know. And
dialog: yet, I have the feeling that Mr. Holland
dialog: considers a great part of his life
dialog: misspent. Rumor has it he was always
dialog: working on this symphony of his, his
dialog: opus. Someday it would make him famous,
dialog: rich, probably both. But Mr. Holland
dialog: isn't rich. Or famous, at least not
dialog: outside our little town. And so perhaps
dialog: it: would be easy for Mr. Holland to think
dialog: himself a failure. And he would be
dialog: wrong. For LI think he has achieved a
dialog: success beyond riches and fame. Look
dialog: around you, Mr. Holland. There is not a
dialog: life in this room that you have not
dialog: touched. And each of us is a better
dialog: person because of you. This is your
dialog: symphony, Mr. Holland. These people are
dialog: the notes and melodies of your opus. And
dialog: this is the music of your life.
text: The audience rises and gives Holland a standing ovation. He
text: leeks out at the audience, each face a memory, a moment of
dialog: ‘on
text: Laughter.
dialog: She waits
dialog: on
dialog: his life.

speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: And now we would like to give you
dialog: something back. Mr. Holland, if you
dialog: would, take this bacon and begin the
dialog: first public performance of “The American
dialog: Opus“ by Glenn Holland.
text: She hands him the baton. Holland turns to the orchestra.
text: The instruments are poised and ready. He looks down at the
text: music stand. The sheet music is a copy of the original, in
text: his handwriting. “The American Opus" by Glenn Holland. He
text: turns, looks at Iris. She nods as if telling him it's cime
text: to begin. He turns back, raises the baton, taps it once on
text: the music stand and... the orchestra plays. The opening
text: strains of the music fill the gym. Holland's face glows and
text: his chest fills with pride. It is a symphony with elements
text: of jazz, rock, country, tin pan alley, and classical.
text: A woman enters at the back of the auditorium. Expensively
text: dressed. Beautiful. The people there stare at her in
text: surprise and recognition. They whisper among themselves.
dialog: Rowena.
text: Gertrude goes over to one of the boys playing the clarinec
text: and whispers in his ear. And she takes che clarinet, takes
text: the student's seat, and plays. Then, out of the audience,
text: one or two at a time, other adults approach the stage and -
text: one by one - they replace the students in the orchestra.
text: Holland looks at one of the men in the orchestra.
speaker_heading: HOLLAND
dialog: {softly)
text: Spit valve.
text: The man blushes and glances at the red haired women next to
dialog: hin.
text: Eventually the orchestra is composed completely of adults.
text: Tears stream openly down Holland's face as he leads them. The
text: various themes become clear - Cole's theme, the music for
text: Louis Russ, an ode to Coltrane, Rowena's theme. It's all
text: there and as it reaches it‘s climax, we FREEZE... on Glernn
