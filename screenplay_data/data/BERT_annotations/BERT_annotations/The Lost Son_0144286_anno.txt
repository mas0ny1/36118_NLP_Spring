dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DE MORAESí DRIVEWAY. LATE AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: The butler - stiff, sour, middle-aged - opens
dialog: the Triumph door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTLER
dialog: Mister Xavier Lombard?
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Lombard eyes him coldly, then, unfastening his seatbelt:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Thatís right.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTLER
dialog: Will you please come with me?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: That might depend on where
dialog: youíre going.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTLER
dialog: I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and
dialog: Mrs De Moraesí
dialog: majordomo. They are
dialog: expecting you.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: (a beat; he looks
dialog: him up and down)
dialog: De Moraes? I was
dialog: asked here by a Mrs
dialog: Spitz.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTLER
dialog: That would be Mrs De Moraes
dialog: mother, Sir.
dialog: Mr and Mrs Spitz are
dialog: here with their
dialog: daughter.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Lombard eyes him a while longer, pockets his Gitanes and steps out
dialog: the car under the butlerís
text: umbrella... The butler shuts the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DE MORAESí MANSION, HALLWAY. LATE AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Footsteps echoing... Grand white marble floor, broad staircase,
dialog: modern art...  Lombard peers
dialog: around, following close behind the
dialog: butler who heads for...
dialog: 
text: Huge double doors; The butler opens them, stands aside, announces:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTLER
dialog: Mister Lombard.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DE MORAESí DRAWING ROOM. LATE AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
dialog: Lombard steps in past the butler - who backs
dialog: out, closing the
dialog: doors - and stops... taking in...
speaker_heading: A BLACK
dialog: AND WHITE NIGHTMARE of modern Italian interior decorating:
dialog: lots of marble, chrome, glass, steel
dialog: and leather; more modern art.
speaker_heading: WE FIND...
dialog: An old couple,
text: THE SPITZES, sit side by side at a glass table,
text: strangely upright, she dark, intense, her hands
dialog: on a large
text: envelope, he morose and bespectacled, with a coffee mug and half-
dialog: 
text: eaten DOUGHNUT...  DEBORAH (stunning, in a crimson tweed suit, its
dialog: jacket low cut, baring
dialog: her cleavage and pearl necklace) stands
text: behind them, arms crossed, a cigarette between her fingers...
dialog: And,
text: deep in the room by a blazing fire, CARLOS (dark, handsome, Latin
dialog: 
dialog: manhood in all its carnal glory) and MR BANI (50s, very Italian)
dialog: sit in armchairs studying huge
speaker_heading: technical diagrams and EYEING
text: LOMBARD ABSENT-MINDEDLY. Mrs Spitz motions to the chair of twisted
text: metal opposite her, saying, in a strong, rasping GERMAN ACCENT:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: You are late, Mr Lombard.
dialog: I very much hope
dialog: you are better at
dialog: your job than at keeping
dialog: time. Anyway,
dialog: come and sit down.
dialog: 
text: Lombard peers at her; a flicker of irritation behind his eyes...
dialog: 
dialog: Then, wilfully:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Good afternoon, Mrs...?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.
dialog: 
dialog: (perfunctorily introducing the others)
dialog: 
dialog: My husband...
dialog: (Mr Spitz
dialog: nods at Lombard)
dialog: My daughter, Deborah,
dialog: whose house this is.
dialog: (Deborah
dialog: just looks back at him)
dialog: My son-in-law,
dialog: Carlos...
dialog: (he shows
dialog: a few white teeth)
dialog: The gentleman is
dialog: a business partner of
dialog: his.
dialog: 
dialog: (Mr Bani looks blankly at Lombard)
dialog: 
dialog: Now are you going to sit down or is it your intention
dialog: to remain
dialog: standing, Mr Lombard?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Come, come, give the man time
dialog: to probe,
dialog: Mummy. Donít you know private
dialog: detectives
dialog: like to appraise people?
dialog: (looking Lombard up and
dialog: down)
dialog: Arenít I right, Mr Lombard?
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: IN ON Lombard; a frown... He APPRAISES Deborah... rests his gaze
text: on her cleavage... SMILES...
dialog: glances towards... Carlos and Mr Bani
text: have begun to whisper IN ITALIAN over their diagrams (THEIR
speaker_heading: KEEN
text: WHISPERED CHAT WILL GO ON THROUGHOUT THE SCENE)... turns back to
dialog: 
text: Deborah, sends her a charming smile and starts for the table...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: The pleasure is mine, Mrs
dialog: De Moraes.
dialog: 
text: Deborah purses her lips, takes a drag of her cigarette and sneers
dialog: 
text: as...  Lombard sits, grimaces, twists to inspect his chairís
dialog: tortuous back, turns back to
dialog: the Spitzes and, now appreciating why
text: they sit so stiffly, grins, pushes his chair back, settles
dialog: on its
dialog: edge and reaches for his Gitanes...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: May I...(smoke)?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: (she waves a
dialog: hand: ĎIf you mustí)
dialog: May I ask if
dialog: you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
dialog: 
text: IN ON Lombard; a fed-up frown as he lights his cigarette...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: Lombard, this is not a Jewish
dialog: name, is it?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: (pocketing his
dialog: Gitanes, with a SMILE)
dialog: I hope itís
dialog: not too significant.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: What if it is?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Well, I would have to point
dialog: out that we
dialog: could have dealt with
dialog: that question when
dialog: you called this
dialog: morning, Mrs Spitz. I
dialog: wouldnít like
dialog: to think Iíd kept you
dialog: waiting for
dialog: nothing.
dialog: 
text: IN ON Mrs Spitz... Displeasure darkens her eyes... She appraises
dialog: 
dialog: him...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: Whatever, you come recommended.
dialog: We...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Recommended?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: Must I speak to you in French?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Didnít you say I came recommended?
dialog: 
dialog: (off her look: ĎYesí)
dialog: Thatís what
dialog: I thought. May I know by whom?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: You may not. And besides,
dialog: it is
dialog: irrelevant.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: (after a beat,
dialog: deciding to yield)
dialog: Okay. Recommended...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: Good. Now, as I trust you
dialog: may have
dialog: guessed, we are looking
dialog: for someone to
dialog: work for us. Someone
dialog: whose discretion can
dialog: be relied upon.
dialog: Someone who while in our
dialog: employ would
dialog: give us full commitment. Do
dialog: you think
dialog: you could be that person, Mr
dialog: Lombard?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: (he peers at her,
dialog: then at his
dialog: cigarette)
dialog: 
dialog: Look Mrs Spitz... I donít know to whom Iím
dialog: 
dialog: indebted for the recommendation but... Iím
dialog: 
dialog: not in the business of making oaths of
dialog: 
dialog: allegiance or giving myself character
dialog: 
dialog: references. What I do is listen to what
dialog: 
dialog: the people who care to call me have to say
dialog: 
dialog: and judge whether or not I can be of help.
dialog: 
dialog: I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: What I can appreciate is
dialog: insolence, Mr
dialog: Lombard!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Lombard scowls, turns to... Mr Spitz, eyes fixed on his cup, says
dialog: a few words in YIDDISH... his
dialog: hand squeezing his wifeís arm, a
dialog: gesture firm but appeasing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH (OS)
dialog: Would you like a doughnut,
dialog: Mr Lombard?
dialog: 
text: Lombard looks up... IN ON Deborah; a provocative smile, gleeful
dialog: 
dialog: contempt...
text: Lombard stands, leans across the table, stamps out his cigarette
dialog: 
dialog: in her ashtray.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Donít disturb the butler.
dialog: I remember the
dialog: way out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISTER SPITZ
dialog: (softly;
speaker_heading: MILD GERMAN ACCENT)
dialog: Sit down, please,
dialog: Mr Lombard. Sit down...
dialog: 
text: Lombard turns to Mr Spitz... uneasy eyes in a patchwork of deep
dialog: wrinkles...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISTER SPITZ
dialog: Please, forgive us. We
dialog: did not mean to
dialog: offend you. Itís
dialog: just that...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Let him go, Daddy. This
dialog: is pointless
dialog: anyway. Wonder boyís
dialog: soon enough going to
dialog: run out of cash
dialog: and stagger back to the
dialog: nest.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: Shut up, Deborah!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: UNEASY SILENCE.  Deborah sighs, sneers, stamps out her cigarette.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISTER SPITZ
dialog: We were hoping to ask
dialog: you to look for our
dialog: son, Mr Lombard.
dialog: He...
dialog: (off Lombardís look)
dialog: 
dialog: He has been missing for three weeks now.
dialog: 
dialog: We are worried he might be in trouble...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Oh, come on! If you must go
dialog: ahead with
dialog: this you might as well
dialog: get to the point.
dialog: (to
dialog: Lombard)
dialog: As for you, if youíre determined
dialog: to stay
dialog: and hear about my dear brotherís
dialog: riveting
dialog: personality, you might as
dialog: well sit down
dialog: again. Boredom is easier
dialog: handled that way.
dialog: And by the way,
dialog: before you ask, the boy
dialog: Leon is 31
dialog: years old.
dialog: 
text: SILENCE AGAIN.  Mrs Spitz glares at Deborah, who lights a new
dialog: 
text: cigarette...  Mr Spitz fixes his pained eyes on his clasped
dialog: hands...
dialog: 
dialog: Lombard decides to sit down, saying helpfully to the Spitzes:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: I take it your son is called
dialog: Leon?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: Leonard. What my daughter
dialog: is on about, Mr
dialog: Lombard, is that
dialog: Leonard is somewhat of a
dialog: Bohemian.
dialog: You might as well know that...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: For Bohemian read ex-university
dialog: drop-out
dialog: and ex-failed rock star
dialog: recently turned
dialog: Artist Photographer.
dialog: Oh yes, and a most
dialog: likely relapsing
dialog: ex-heroin addict.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: We do not know that for
dialog: certain, Deborah!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: I said Ďlikelyí, Mummy.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: (to Lombard,
dialog: irritated)
dialog: Leonard is a good boy,
dialog: but sadly he likes
dialog: bad company and
dialog: is susceptible... Two
dialog: years ago we
dialog: sent him to a... a
dialog: detoxification
dialog: clinic. It has had the
dialog: desired effect.
dialog: He has since been very
dialog: content living
dialog: in the apartment I bought
dialog: him here
dialog: in London and, until three weeks
dialog: 
dialog: ago, he called every fortnight to our home
dialog: 
dialog: in Scotland.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Money doesnít grow on trees...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: (to Lombard,
dialog: with irate defensiveness)
dialog: Leonard
dialog: is now devoting his time to
dialog: photography.
dialog: It is good for him. My
dialog: husband and
dialog: I have chosen to support him
dialog: in this.
dialog: He also works, though. In a
dialog: restaurant...
dialog: 
dialog: (quickly, preempting Deborah)
dialog: He washes
dialog: the dishes. Three evenings a
dialog: week
dialog: he washes the dishes.
dialog: 
text: TENSE SILENCE; Lombard surveys the opulent room, comes across...
dialog: 
text: A FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH: Carlos, triumphant in racing driverís
dialog: overalls, on a podium - Magnum of
dialog: Champagne in one hand, garland
dialog: around his neck...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: What do you think has happened
dialog: to your
dialog: son, Mrs Spitz?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: You wouldnít be here if
dialog: I knew, Mr
dialog: Lombard. What I do know
dialog: is that he has not
dialog: been at work for
dialog: three weeks. That
dialog: enquiries to the
dialog: police and London
dialog: hospitals have
dialog: borne no results. And that
dialog: a check
dialog: with his bank revealed he has not
dialog: 
dialog: used his account for four weeks now.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: Do what, Mr Lombard?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Check with your sonís bank.
dialog: Banks donít
dialog: usually give out information
dialog: about their
dialog: customers.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: I said earlier that my husband
dialog: and I are
dialog: supporting Leonard in his
dialog: photography, Mr
dialog: Lombard. By this
dialog: I mean that since his
dialog: return from
dialog: America I have been depositing
dialog: for
dialog: him a monthly allowance in an account
dialog: 
dialog: we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not
dialog: 
dialog: have to break the law to find out if he
dialog: 
dialog: used the account.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: I didnít mean to imply you
dialog: did, Mrs Spitz.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: Then you should not have
dialog: sought an
dialog: explanation.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: (after a beat,
dialog: grinning)
dialog: I presume you checked your
dialog: sonís
dialog: apartment...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: Yesterday. It all looked
dialog: normal.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Did you look for his passport,
dialog: driving
dialog: licence?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: Leonard does not hold a
dialog: driving licence.
dialog: As for his passport,
dialog: I do not know where
dialog: he keeps it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: So he could have decided to
dialog: go on a
dialog: trip...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: He could indeed, Mr Lombard.
dialog: But had he
dialog: done so I think he would
dialog: have let us know
dialog: about it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Then why arenít you asking
dialog: the police to
dialog: look for your son,
dialog: Mrs Spitz?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: At last! A pertinent question.
dialog: Come on,
dialog: Mummy: answer the detective.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISTER SPITZ
dialog: (looking
dialog: up sadly into Lombardís eyes)
dialog: Leonard
dialog: used to disappear like this before
dialog: 
dialog: his treatment, Mr Lombard. Whether he has
dialog: 
dialog: reverted to his former habit is something
dialog: 
dialog: we would rather not find out through the
dialog: 
dialog: police. Iím sure you can understand...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: (with a scolding
dialog: glance at her
dialog: husband)
dialog: )
dialog: I am categorical Leonard has had
dialog: no
dialog: interest in drugs since he came
dialog: back from
dialog: America.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: The Spitzes eye each other somberly...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Now you know why youíre here,
dialog: Mr Lombard.
dialog: (enjoying
dialog: herself now)
dialog: It might be difficult
dialog: for someone like you
dialog: to discern,
dialog: but we are people of a certain
dialog: standing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Appearances can be deceptive,
dialog: Mrs De
dialog: Moraes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: That depends what youíre looking
dialog: at.
dialog: 
text: IN ON Deborah; cold defiance in her eyes... IN ON Lombard; a cruel
dialog: 
text: flicker in his... He softens, smiles, asks, only slowly moving his
dialog: eyes away from hers...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: I take it your son is not
dialog: married, Mrs
dialog: Spitz?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: No. And before you ask,
dialog: no, heís not gay!
dialog: He has had girlfriends,
dialog: but nothing
dialog: serious...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Any friends?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: The proprietor of his workplace
dialog: is the
dialog: only friend of his we know
dialog: about.
dialog: (she slaps the
dialog: envelope on the table)
dialog: His address
dialog: is in this envelope with
dialog: Leonardís
dialog: address, keys and other things
dialog: you
dialog: might need.
dialog: (she glances
dialog: impatiently at her watch)
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Iím sure... As far as you
dialog: know, when and
dialog: where was your son
dialog: last seen?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: When... Iím told he came
dialog: here...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Three weeks ago. To borrow
dialog: money. I wasnít
dialog: here but he got to
dialog: my husband, sold him
dialog: some fancy story
dialog: about an exhibition of
dialog: his work and
dialog: needing money to get new
dialog: prints made.
dialog: Carlos handed over £1,000 to
dialog: get
dialog: rid of him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: And that is the last time
dialog: any...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Well, Leon does not need money
dialog: for prints,
dialog: Mr Lombard. Does his
dialog: own printing.
dialog: Wouldnít want anyone
dialog: to interfere with his
dialog: ĎArtí!
dialog: 
dialog: (after a beat, perversely)
dialog: Which,
dialog: as he subsequently vanished, raises
dialog: 
dialog: the question: what was the money for?
dialog: 
dialog: Perish the thought.
dialog: 
text: IN ON Mrs Spitz - this has hit home; she scowls at the envelope
dialog: 
text: under her fingers... slides it across the table towards Lombard...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: The £1,000 is on account.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: (he peers at the
dialog: envelope, then off
dialog: 
dialog: her look)
dialog: My rates...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: We are aware of your rates,
dialog: Mr Lombard. We
dialog: will pay you double
dialog: your rates plus
dialog: expenses. In return,
dialog: need I say it again,
dialog: we expect discretion
dialog: and undivided
dialog: attention.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: (a long beat;
dialog: then, grinning)
dialog: Why do you think your
dialog: son chose not to
dialog: come to you for
dialog: funds for his photography,
dialog: Mrs Spitz?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His
dialog: monthly
dialog: allowance is all he is to
dialog: expect from us.
dialog: He knows it and we
dialog: feel the amount is more
dialog: than adequate.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Lombard nods... thinks... reaches for the envelope and stands...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS SPITZ
dialog: My husband and I will be
dialog: leaving tomorrow
dialog: for a short stay
dialog: in Israel. Deborah will
dialog: be here if
dialog: you need anything before our
dialog: return.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Fine. One more thing, Mrs
dialog: and Mr Spitz;
dialog: may I ask what is or
dialog: was your occupation?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISTER SPITZ
dialog: We make and sell shoes
dialog: and leather
dialog: garments.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Lombard peers briefly at him, nods, then turns to Deborah:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH

dialog: £3,000 for his keep and left saying he was

dialog: He just said he had good reasons.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Good reasons?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RHIAN
dialog: Thatís what he said. I tried
dialog: to dissuade

dialog: take on another
dialog: child, that heíd
dialog: get into trouble... I
dialog: mean, people
dialog: who sell children... But he
dialog: wasnít
dialog: listening... I guess he finally

dialog: heís back on drugs, eh?
dialog: 
dialog: (off Lombardís smile: ĎIím afraid soí)
dialog: 
dialog: Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs.
dialog: 
dialog: Went through his self-destruct phase, you
dialog: 
dialog: know?  Things to come to terms with.
dialog: 
dialog: Demons to fight... Some peopleís minds are

dialog: A quarter of all the shoes sold

speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Iím afraid I donít understand.

dialog: Theyíre German Jews. Came here
dialog: before the
dialog: war. They both lost all
dialog: their families in
dialog: extermination camps,
dialog: but they themselves
dialog: never went near
dialog: one. The idea that his
dialog: family wealth
dialog: was started with money he
dialog: believes
dialog: should have gone to camp
dialog: survivors
dialog: has been haunting Leon. Itís not
dialog: 
dialog: guilt, more of a curse...
dialog:

dialog: And then thereís something
dialog: about his

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: NATHALIE
dialog: Can you afford a room in

speaker_heading: AGED MAN (suit) and a YOUNG

speaker_heading: NATHALIE
dialog: We are so alike, Xavier.
dialog: Still, sometimes

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD

speaker_heading: MOREAU (OS)
dialog: Their last suspected kill

dialog: probably do no more than

speaker_heading: LOMBARD

dialog:

speaker_heading: LOMBARD

speaker_heading: FRIEDMAN (OS)
dialog: Fifteen for a straight

speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: I wonít comment on the time
dialog: but youíll
dialog: understand if I donít
dialog: tell you to sit
dialog: down. Now, spare

dialog: will you, Mr Lombard.
dialog: 
dialog: (she sits down and lights a cigarette)
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Iím afraid I have bad news,
dialog: Mr De Moraes.
dialog: I have reason to believe
dialog: your brotherís in
dialog: trouble.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: For your information, Mr Lombard,
dialog: trouble
dialog: is possibly the one thing
dialog: Leon is capable
dialog: of getting into all
dialog: by himself. Though I
dialog: doubt he will
dialog: not ultimately fail even at
dialog: that.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: (smiles, sighs,
dialog: retaliates:)
dialog: I donít know. He seems
dialog: to delight in so

dialog: he might become
dialog: determined.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Oh-oh! Touchť, Mr Lombard!
dialog: But tell me,
dialog: what would you know
dialog: about sisterly love,
dialog: eh?
dialog: 
dialog: (a beat, with an icy glare)
dialog: No. Donít.
dialog: You might get confused speaking
dialog: of

dialog:

speaker_heading: LOMBARD

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Can it be that easy?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Can it be that you want your

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Anything is possible.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Lombard peers at her... chooses not to bother... He opens his

speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: I found this at your brotherís.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Itís a snuff movie. Prime

dialog: material. Iím told it
dialog: retails at around

dialog: 
dialog: (as Deborah frowns at the tape, rigid)
dialog: 
dialog: I see you donít require a definition.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: You... You found that at Leonís?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Thereís more. Your brother
dialog: also purchased
dialog: a young boy for £15,000.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Deborah looks back at him, confounded... LOST FOR WORDS for once.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: You seem surprised. Could
dialog: it be you donít
dialog: think that badly
dialog: of him after all?
dialog: (off
dialog: her silence)
dialog: You neednít worry. It
dialog: seems his motives
dialog: were pure. From
dialog: what I can make out he
dialog: bought the
dialog: boy to rescue him from further
dialog: abuse.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: What... What are you talking
dialog: about?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Your brother got mixed up
dialog: with child
dialog: procurers  and tried
dialog: to make this world a
dialog: better place,
dialog: Mrs De Moraes. And having
dialog: rescued
dialog: one little life he unwisely set
dialog: out
dialog: to repeat the exercise.
dialog: 
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: You donít mess around with
dialog: child
dialog: procurers. Right now my guess
dialog: is heís
dialog: either on the run, held captive,
dialog: or dead.
dialog: (off her horrified
dialog: frown)
dialog: I understand your misgivings,
dialog: Mrs De
dialog: Moraes. But Iíve seen the
dialog: boy and made
dialog: telephone contact with
dialog: the man Leon bought
dialog: him from. If
dialog: anyone knows what happened to
dialog: your
dialog: brother it will be that man. Which
dialog: 
dialog: leads me to why Iím here at such a late
dialog: 
dialog: hour. I need £20,000, in cash, by 11 this
dialog: 
dialog: morning.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Excuse me?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: I need the money to smooth

dialog: cash here or
dialog: do we need to meet in the

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Deborah stares at him, thinking hard... her amazement turns into

speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: I will of course do my best
dialog: to hang onto
dialog: it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Where is it?
dialog: 
dialog: (off his look: ĎWhat?í; shouting)
dialog: 
dialog: He. The boy you said my brother bought!
dialog:

speaker_heading: LOMBARD

speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Oh no. Youíll have to do better
dialog: than that,

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: (angry)
dialog: 
dialog: Look, Mrs De Moraes, however much of a let
dialog: 
dialog: down it might be, your brotherís not back
dialog: 
dialog: to his old weekend tricks! Impressionable
dialog: 
dialog: as he is, he probably grew tired of
dialog: 
dialog: healthy girls in grisly poses, tried
dialog: 
dialog: moving on to bigger things, came upon more
dialog: 
dialog: than heíd bargained for and somehow
dialog: 
dialog: fancied he could take on the real world.
dialog: 
dialog: Which he no doubt chanced upon on his way
dialog: 
dialog: to that thing now sitting on your table...
dialog: 
dialog: Have a look at it, Mrs De Moraes. I told
dialog: 
dialog: you I had bad news...
dialog: 
text: Deborah scowls... Lombard waits, giving her time to calm down
dialog: 
dialog: but... It seems too much for her...  She laughs nervously, looks
dialog: at the video, shakes her
dialog: head:
dialog:

speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Not Leon...
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: IN ON Lombard; a puzzled frown...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: How dare you...
dialog: 
dialog: (a beat, eyeing the tape again)
dialog: You
dialog: donít know this tape belongs to my
dialog: 
dialog: brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: The question now is whether

dialog: brother still owns anything,
dialog: Mrs De
dialog: Moraes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: (glaring at him)
dialog: 
dialog: No. The question now is how long itís

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Excuse me?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: (cutting in, getting
dialog: to her feet)
dialog: No. Youíre fired! Get

speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: The family hired you and

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: (long beat as

dialog: Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why

speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: See Mr Lombard to the door,

speaker_heading: MARTIN

speaker_heading: MARTIN

dialog: steps aside to let Lombard through:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIANT
dialog: Iíll lock behind you. Pick up
dialog: the intercom
dialog: when youíre finished
dialog: or if you need
dialog: anything, alright?

scene_heading: INT. ROOM 46, INNER CORRIDOR. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A narrow passage to a PADDED DOOR... Lombard waits as the outer
dialog: door is locked... turns to the
text: padded door, opens it... THE SOUND
text: OF A BUGS BUNNY CARTOON...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 46. AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: Lombard stands just inside the padded door, peering at...
dialog: 
text: In an armchair: BOY NUMBER 6 (T-shirt, short trousers, plimsolls)
text: looks back at Lombard, apprehensive
dialog: but docile...  ĎBugs Bunnyí is
text: on the TV in front of him.  Lombard raises his voice
dialog: above the TV:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Do you speak English?
dialog: 
dialog: (the boy frowns)
dialog: FranÁais?
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: No reaction.  Lombard sighs... scans the room... Padded walls,
dialog: mirrored ceiling, a huge
dialog: bed, small drinks bar, a hifi, video
dialog: player, fridge, shelves of porn videos and literature, a
dialog: dark
text: doorway... And the boy again, still gazing at him...  Lombard
dialog: 
text: smiles, shuts the padded door and crosses to...
dialog: 
dialog: The dark
text: doorway: he turns on the light; A WINDOWLESS BATHROOM.
dialog: 
dialog: He
text: walks to the fridge... stocked with food and drinks...
dialog: Opens a cupboard: S&amp;M paraphernalia,
dialog: sex aids, aphrodisiacs,
dialog: tranquillizers, a still camera, video camera, etc... all neatly
dialog: 
dialog: stacked.
dialog: 
text: He eyes the boy again... turns to the fridge, opens
dialog: it, reaches
text: for a chocolate bar... makes for the boy, squats and hands it to
dialog: 
text: him with a reassuring smile...  The boy warily reaches for it.  IN
dialog: ON Lombard as he
dialog: peers with a frown into...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BOYíS EYES: dilated
dialog: pupils - heís obviously been sedated.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: (pointing to the
dialog: bathroom)
dialog: You go in there. In there,
dialog: yes....
dialog: 
text: The boy frowns, stands... docilely walks into the bathroom and out
dialog: 
dialog: of sight...
text: Lombard peers after him, then straightens up and follows him...
dialog: 
text: THE BATHROOM: the boy stands by the bath eyeing Lombard in the
dialog: 
dialog: doorway.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: (pointing to a
dialog: stool)
dialog: Itís all right, huh. You sit
dialog: down. Sit.
dialog: (the boy timidly
dialog: sits down)
dialog: Good. You eat your chocolate.
dialog: Itís yours.
dialog: 
text: He points at the chocolate in the boys hand, makes eating
dialog: 
dialog: motions...  The boy doesnít seem to want to eat...  Lombard brings
dialog: his finger to his
dialog: lips...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: You stay here and be quiet,
dialog: okay. Shhh...
dialog: 
text: And he slowly and softly shuts the door.
dialog: 
text: Now Lombard switches the TV off, puts his briefcase on the bed,
dialog: picks up the intercom and, with
text: it wedged between his shoulder and
text: ear, pulls his handgun and a silencer from his pocket and
dialog: calmly
text: starts screwing one onto the other.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Thereís no toilet paper.
dialog: 
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Thereís no toilet paper.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: GIANT

dialog: edge of the bed... He puts his
dialog: hands to his face, takes them away -
dialog: theyíre red with blood from his nose.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIANT
dialog: Jesus...
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: LOMBARD

speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Whoís the money man?

speaker_heading: GIANT

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: If I were you Iíd stop acting

dialog: narrow down my thoughts

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: The man who sold the boy to

dialog: even a poor little
dialog: boy. But as yet,
dialog: youíve not found my

dialog: 
dialog: Your Mr Friedman could shed some light on
dialog: 
dialog: the matter, you say. Well, find him.

dialog: Didnít I hear you say he was in Los

dialog: Friedman
dialog: and his people donít just provide

dialog: 
dialog: Theyíre in the import-export business.
dialog: 
dialog: They run hotels here in London which they

speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: (after a beat,
dialog: uneasy, then
dialog: dismissive)
dialog: 
dialog: Huh! Really? Hotels?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: The hotels are useful capital
dialog: investments.
dialog: The kids liquid assets.
dialog: My guess is they
dialog: own hotels across

dialog: agencies specialising
dialog: in flights from the
dialog: third world to

speaker_heading: EMILY

speaker_heading: LOMBARD

scene_heading: ĎRESTRICTED AREA. DO NOT PASS BEYOND THIS POINTí...  Lombard

dialog:

speaker_heading: RAZOR WIRE that cuts through

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUSIC).

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN ON DAIS
dialog: ...And let me tell you,
dialog: in that short
dialog: period both profit
dialog: margins and demand for
dialog: our products
dialog: have increased far beyond our
dialog: best
dialog: forecast. By guaranteeing faster,
dialog: 
dialog: cheaper, more reliable delivery, weíve
dialog: 
dialog: begun to wipe out the competition. Wordís
dialog: 
dialog: getting round. The long term potential is
dialog: 
dialog: simply huge. In this country alone on any
dialog: 
dialog: one day in excess of 20,000 good folks are
dialog: 
dialog: waiting for a replacement organ... Just
dialog: 
dialog: multiply five percent of this by say
dialog: 
dialog: $10,000 per kidney, $40,000 per heart,
dialog: 
dialog: $100,000 per liver, and you might begin to
dialog: 
dialog: get the picture...
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN ON DAIS
dialog: ...Bringing third-world

dialog: (laughter from
dialog: his audience)
dialog: 
text: Lombard moves swiftly away, past the fleet of parked cars to...
dialog: 
text: THE SATELLITE DISH BUILDING. Through a lit window: computer
dialog: 
text: terminals... A MAN engrossed in a computer game (DOOM)... a
dialog: flickering TV (a HOLIDAY PROGRAMME)...
dialog: Through a dark window: more
text: computers... TELEPHONES and, through an open door, the man playing
dialog: in the next room...
dialog: Lombard moves on... creeps around the

dialog:

dialog: 
text: Lombard moves swiftly along the narrow alley between the building
dialog: and its fence, searching for
dialog: a window with open curtains...
text: A PANTING SOUND... A GROWL somewhere behind him...  He turns...
dialog: 
text: A TOOTHY DOBERMAN looks back at him, ready to pounce, growling...
dialog: IN ON Lombard; FEAR, thereís
dialog: no escape...  Eyeballing the
text: Doberman, he starts to slip off his jacket, softly hushing
dialog: the
dialog: dog... ĎChut, petit chien...í
text: He drops gently to his
text: knees, holding his jacket open in front of
text: him, eyes on the dog...  takes a deep breath,
dialog: jerks his jacket...
text: THE DOBERMAN LEAPS, going for the throat...  Lombard catches its
text: head in his jacket, falls to the ground holding the dog by the
dialog: 
text: neck... The dog thrashes, wrestles... Lombard cracks its skull
dialog: through his jacket with his gun
dialog: butt; once, twice, three times...
dialog: The Doberman WHINES... weakens...
dialog: 
text: A SHAFT OF LIGHT SPEARS FROM THE WINDOW ABOVE...  Lombard freezes,
dialog: looks up...  The
text: curtain above him is open... Through the bars,
text: the top half of A YOUNG WOMANís FACE looking out...
dialog: The Doberman
text: in Lombardís grip WHIMPERS, shudders violently...
dialog: 
text: IN ON the woman searching the darkness... She flicks the curtain
dialog: shut.
dialog: 
text: DARKNESS AGAIN.  Lombard turns to... The main gate: the guards
dialog: havenít moved...  The
dialog: dog: itís dead...
text: IN ON Lombardís hands peeling the jacket from the dogís head...
text: his jacket glistens with blood...  He yanks it out from under the
dialog: 
text: dog, sits up, puts it back on, turns to...  The main building: the
dialog: pregnant girls are still
dialog: dancing...
dialog: His eyes move to...
dialog: Away, against the perimeter
dialog: fence: a SMALL STONE BUILDING flanked
text: with STACKS OF OIL DRUMS; it seems to be the source of
dialog: the

dialog: 
dialog: thinking...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GENERATOR SHELTER, RANCH. NIGHT.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: IN ON the roaring GENERATOR lit by...  Lombard stands inside the

dialog: He dumps the dog...

scene_heading: EXT. THE SATELLITE DISH

dialog:

dialog: climbs through the window...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SATELLITE DISH BUILDING, RANCH. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: ...tiptoes to the phones, picks one up, squats
dialog: to keep the man

dialog: 
text: pulls the paper from his breast pocket... Itís soaked in blood.
text: He peels it open and, squinting
dialog: to decipher the numbers, dials...
text: HE TRAINS HIS GUN ON THE MAN NEXT DOOR... RINGING TONE... Then:

speaker_heading: LOMBARD

speaker_heading: EMILY (OS)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Route 395. Past Edwards Air
dialog: Force base and
dialog: about half a mile

speaker_heading: EMILY (OS)

dialog: Is that where he

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: I think so. And if it comes

dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: After 30 yards, he puts the

text: cigarette... focuses on... A dark SHED, to one side, half-way
dialog: to
dialog: the main building...
text: He takes a few steps towards the

speaker_heading: THROUGH THE

text: Lombard sprints towards the shed... The
dialog: cigarette hits the petrol -
text: WHOOSH...  Lombard reaches the shed...  A RIVER OF FIRE
dialog: rushes
text: towards the shelter...  Lombard throws himself to the ground
dialog: 
text: beyond the shed... ĎWHOOMPHí...  Flames engulf the shelter...
dialog: Lombard curls up, head in
dialog: his arms...
text: BOOM.... The shelter blows up in a deafening conflagration... The
dialog: 
dialog: MUSIC STOPS, all over the ranch the LIGHTS GO OFF...
text: Lombard looks up... A ball of fire roars
dialog: into the night sky...  WE
text: HEAR SCREAMS...  He turns to...
dialog: 
text: The main building: SEVERAL MEN, guns at the ready, gape at the
dialog: fire...
dialog: 
text: Now Lombard again buries his head in his arms...  BOOM...
dialog: WHOOMPH... as the petrol drums
dialog: outside the Generator shelter
text: blow...  The men outside the main building are thrown to the
text: ground... WINDOWS SHATTER...
dialog: Lombard hurriedly crawls to
dialog: the door of the...
dialog: 
text: INT. SHED. NIGHT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IN ON Lombard
text: as he crawls in; a grimace...  He stops, sniffs the
text: air, peers into the shed...  In
dialog: the fire-light coming through the
text: shattered window: a BATHTUB... BAGS OF LIME... GALLON
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONTAINERS...
text: He goes on in, kicks the door shut, stands, buries his nose in the
dialog: 
text: crook of his elbow and makes for the bathtub...  IN ON Lombard;
dialog: sickened eyes...
dialog: 
text: IN THE BATH: the floating remains of A BODY, gruesome, half-
dialog: dissolved, face up; could it be Friedman...
dialog: IN ON Lombard; he
dialog: scowls... ĎNom de...í
dialog: He turns to...
dialog: The gallon containers: ĎSULPHURIC ACIDí read the
dialog: labels...
dialog: 
text: He glances back at the body, crosses to the window, looks out,
dialog: breathing air...
dialog: 
text: Outside:  A strange sight.  A SILENT, 60 STRONG CROWD.  Men in
dialog: suits, naked waitresses,
dialog: pregnant girls, YOUNG MEN IN ARMY
dialog: fatigues and jeans, men and women in night-clothes, in servant
dialog: or
text: cook uniforms...  A mass of speechless faces all glowing in fire-

scene_heading: EXT. MAIN BUILDING, RANCH. NIGHT.

scene_heading: EXT. RANCH. NIGHT.
dialog: 
dialog: IN ON the Italian from the

dialog: MAN #1: Hey! Can the funny

dialog: Okay. What weíre gonna

dialog: out the cars to

dialog: and
dialog: Stan, take some men to patrol the

dialog: 
text: The crowd begins to ripple, small clusters form...
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: teeth:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: You make a sound and we both
dialog: die.
dialog: (the man turns; he
dialog: jabs him again)
dialog: Letís go.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The Italian dithers, glances at Lombardís bloody jacket, frowns...
dialog: then grins and shrugs,
dialog: obviously not giving Lombard much chance...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE ITALIAN
dialog: Sure. Where to, huh?
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Lombard jabs the Italian again, steers him towards...
dialog:

speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: And keep your head down.
dialog: 
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. STABLE BUILDING, RANCH. NIGHT.
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: LOMBARD

speaker_heading: THE ITALIAN

speaker_heading: THE ITALIAN
dialog: Let me give you a tip,

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (she stares, thrown

dialog: Things turned out to be

dialog: point in
dialog: delving into his sad life

speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Sorry?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: (signalling towards
dialog: the Harrods bag)
dialog: Whatís in the bag?
dialog: Underwear? To seduce
dialog: your husband?
dialog: Or is it for your own
dialog: recreation?
dialog: (off her mystified silence)
dialog: 
dialog: Tell me, how come such a handsome couple
dialog: 
dialog: sleep in seperate bedrooms? Is it because

text: He glances at... she holds the pen so tight her fingers
dialog: have gone

dialog: about.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: You know heíd have had him
dialog: killed, donít
dialog: you? Does a conscience
dialog: still burn
dialog: somewhere inside your
dialog: sore mind, Deborah?
dialog: Or is it just
dialog: cold expediency? Could the
dialog: boy perhaps
dialog: come in useful when and if the
dialog: day

speaker_heading: DEBORAH

speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: When did you learn about his

dialog: kids, huh? On your honeymoon?
dialog: Or was it
dialog: later, when bitterness
dialog: set in and you
dialog: turned against your
dialog: beloved but weak
dialog: little brother?
dialog: How did you find out? Did
dialog: he confess?

speaker_heading: LOMBARD

speaker_heading: DEBORAH

dialog: mistakes, Mr Lombard.
dialog: There is some merit
dialog: in it.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: I take it you learnt to live

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: How... When did you...
dialog:

speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: It must be tough being married
dialog: to Adonis
dialog: to end up sleeping alone
dialog: every night.
dialog: Sleep must be hard coming.
dialog: Whatís harder?
dialog: The thought of the
dialog: fine litter you two
dialog: could have bred
dialog: if? Or imagining what he
dialog: does with
dialog: his children?
dialog: 
text: IN ON Deborah; HATRED in her eyes. Her lip twitches, she opens her

text: SILENCE. They eyeball each other, Deborah filled with scorn,
text: Lombard with disgust... She takes a deep breath...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: What exactly did you come
dialog: here for, Mr
dialog: Lombard?
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: IN ON Lombard; a frown of disbelief... He shakes his head, pulls
dialog: the contact sheet from his pocket,
dialog: makes for her unfolding it,
text: flattens it on the table, turns it round, pushes it towards her:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: What were you satisfying?
speaker_heading: Morbid
dialog: curiosity? Was it gratifying?
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She stares at the contact sheet... Looks up, mystified.... He puts
dialog: his finger onto the shot with
dialog: the Aston Martin...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Look closely, Deborah! How
dialog: many Aston
dialog: Martin DB6 do you think
dialog: there are in
dialog: London, huh?
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: IN ON Deborah; DREAD IN HER EYES... She looks down again...
text: Lombard takes a couple of steps back
dialog: to watch her peer at the
dialog: shot, searching...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Tell me, did he kill his little
dialog: victims
dialog: too?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: No!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: SILENCE.  She looks towards him but not at him... Lombard snarls,
dialog: watching her realise she
dialog: has slipped...

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: What do you mean, ĎNoí, Mrs
dialog: De Moraes?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: My brother hung himself.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Does the name Pierre Dreyer
dialog: mean anything
dialog: to you? Heís a client
dialog: of mine and a friend
dialog: of your husband.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Leon hung himself.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Adonis thought your brotherís
dialog: bodyíd be
dialog: found reasonably quickly
dialog: when he hung it
dialog: in Epping Forest,
dialog: didnít he? Seemed like a
dialog: good idea.
dialog: An ex-junkie, obsessed with
dialog: death;
dialog: the perfect candidate for suicide.
dialog: 
dialog: He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers
dialog: 
dialog: are rare during your average blustery
dialog: 
dialog: English November. An Englishman might have
dialog: 
dialog: thought of that, but a Brazilian...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Leon hung himself...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Leonís not found, your parents
dialog: worry, talk
dialog: of hiring help to find
dialog: him, even mention
dialog: their manhunter
dialog: friends perhaps... and
dialog: Adonis panics,
dialog: takes control, brings me in
dialog: reckoning
dialog: a small- time detective is
dialog: unlikely
dialog: to dig up anything awkward, not
dialog: before
dialog: Leonís found anyhow. He must have
dialog: 
dialog: kicked himself when he learned Iíd
dialog: 
dialog: exceeded his expectations.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Leon hung himself...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Leon didnít hang himself,
dialog: Deborah. Your
dialog: husband killed him
dialog: and made his death look
dialog: like suicide.
dialog: How did he do it, eh?
dialog: Strangulation?
dialog: Drugs? No doubt an autopsy
dialog: will tell.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: IN ON Deborah; FEAR...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Maybe... If Leon didnít hang
dialog: himself,
dialog: maybe Friedman killed him.
dialog: Maybe Friedman
dialog: has your envelope....
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: IN ON Lombard; amazement... She canít help fighting.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: I doubt Friedman ever even
dialog: met Leon,
dialog: Deborah. Friedman dealt
dialog: with select
dialog: customers. As for my
dialog: envelope, had he know
dialog: where it was
dialog: he wouldnít have mistaken me
dialog: for
dialog: a hitman called Lamont when we met in
dialog: 
dialog: Los Angeles.

dialog: ...You-you spoke to him?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Not in the strict sense of
dialog: the word, no.
dialog: He was in too much
dialog: of a hurry to kill me
dialog: when we first
dialog: met and too wasted in acid
dialog: when I
dialog: caught up with him later.
dialog: 
text: SILENCE. Deborah sends him a long look... IN ON her; a flicker
dialog: of
text: relief... IN ON Lombard; he scowls, understanding...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Yes. Youíre safe. He swallowed
dialog: the bait
dialog: and paid for it by dying.
dialog: Was the hitman
dialog: story your idea or
dialog: Adonisís, huh?
dialog: (off Deborahís
dialog: silence)
dialog: What was the trouble? Friedman
dialog: might have
dialog: told me he didnít know
dialog: your brother? I
dialog: might have told him
dialog: who I worked for...?
dialog: 
text: SILENCE... Deborah stares at him, expressionless.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Your brother stumbled upon
dialog: Adonisís little
dialog: secret, didnít he?
dialog: And traded his silence
dialog: for a kid
dialog: and some cash. And Adonis fell
dialog: for
dialog: it, bought him his kid, sent him away,
dialog: 
dialog: and then killed him when he came back for
dialog: 
dialog: more.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: 
dialog: Leon didnít come here to borrow money for
dialog: 
dialog: prints. He came to extort a second kidís
dialog: 
dialog: life. Your flunkey let him in, so his
dialog: 
dialog: visit couldnít be concealed, hence the
dialog: 
dialog: exhibition story. There was no exhibition.
dialog: 
dialog: Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah?
dialog: 
dialog: ďLeon does his own prints. Wouldnít want
dialog: 
dialog: anyone to interfere with his ĎArtíĒ.
dialog: 
dialog: (off her silence)
dialog: I should have paid
dialog: more attention to your
dialog: words. Perhaps
dialog: itís the way you say
dialog: them...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: (turning to the
dialog: contact sheet)
dialog: If-if my car is there,
dialog: I could be the one
dialog: who... Why donít
dialog: you accuse me of killing
dialog: my brother?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Kids are not your thing, Deborah.
dialog: Youíd
dialog: have been ready for me when
dialog: I turned up
dialog: with ĎSleeping Beautyí.
dialog: Damn it! Then too
dialog: I should have paid
dialog: more attention. ďNot
dialog: Leon,Ē you said.
dialog: It struck me at the time,
dialog: but obviously
dialog: not hard enough. You didnít
dialog: say ĎMy
dialog: God!í, or whatever else well-bred
dialog: 
dialog: ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry
dialog: 
dialog: misbehaved. ďNot Leon.Ē Who then?
dialog: 
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: You sure were right about
dialog: one thing,
dialog: Deborah, the job was too
dialog: formidable for
dialog: me. I should have
dialog: thought a little more
dialog: before I left
dialog: for Los Angeles. But there I
dialog: was
dialog: focused so hard on Friedman Iíd
dialog: stopped
dialog: thinking. Nothing added up - Leon
dialog: 
dialog: soliciting money for prints while buying
dialog: 
dialog: kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the
dialog: 
dialog: world of child traffickers; duping
dialog: 
dialog: Friedman into selling him a little boy...
dialog: 
dialog: You sure were right. The job was too
dialog: 
dialog: formidable for me. But you knew that,
dialog: 
dialog: didnít you?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Leon could still have hung
dialog: himself.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Oh no. At long last Leon had
dialog: found a
dialog: mission. Heíd never have
dialog: killed himself
dialog: when glory beckoned.
dialog: Your husband killed
dialog: your brother.
dialog: And thanks to you, almost
dialog: got me
dialog: killed too.
dialog: 
text: SILENCE. Deborah stares at him... and... as if suddenly drained,
dialog: 
text: falls back in her chair... She lights a cigarette with a trembling
dialog: hand, takes a deep drag...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Poor Leon... How typical of
dialog: him to be in
dialog: the wrong place at the
dialog: wrong time...
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: 
dialog: When I called you in Los Angeles... I
dialog: 
dialog: wanted to warn you. Maybe I would have if
dialog: 
dialog: you hadnít left me waiting on the line. I
dialog: 
dialog: hung up...
dialog: 
text: IN ON Deborah; tears well up her eyes...  IN ON Lombard; a cold,
dialog: 
text: mean spark deep in his eyes... IN ON Deborah; she goes on looking
dialog: up at him, resolute...
dialog: 
text: Lombard pushes his hands deep into his pockets, turns, makes for
dialog: the window, and says, staring
dialog: into the darkness outside:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Donít cry. I might become
dialog: nasty...
dialog: 
text: Deborah eyes him through tearful eyes... then turns to the contact
dialog: 
dialog: sheet:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Youíre wrong about my being
dialog: there, though.
dialog: Carlos borrowed my
dialog: car that day, his had
dialog: broken down...
dialog: 
dialog: (a beat, she wipes away a tear)
dialog: Leon
dialog: saw it, like you, assumed I was
dialog: there,
dialog: thought heíd wait to ask for a
dialog: lift.
dialog: But Carlos turned up, with the tape
dialog: 
dialog: you found...
dialog: (she wipes
dialog: away another tear)
dialog: Leon got his lift,
dialog: and accidentally picked
dialog: up the tape
dialog: with his photo equipment when
dialog: he
dialog: got out. He watched it, confronted
dialog: 
dialog: Carlos, threatened to tell the police
dialog: 
dialog: about the hotel... I donít know how he
dialog: 
dialog: knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos
dialog: 
dialog: talked too much... My husband did not tell
dialog: 
dialog: me... You more or less guessed the rest...
dialog: 
dialog: (looks up, peers hard at Lombardís
dialog: 
dialog: back)
dialog: I didnít know any of this before
dialog: you left
dialog: for Los Angeles.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: (keeping his back
dialog: to her)
dialog: You donít say.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: That my brother, my husband
dialog: and your Mr
dialog: Friedman were linked,
dialog: that much I had
dialog: guessed. But that
dialog: my husband had killed
dialog: Leon? No.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: IN ON Lombard; he could kill her... but keeps his back to her...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Why did you send me after
dialog: Friedman? To
dialog: atone for your sins?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: I didnít know my husband and
dialog: Friedman knew
dialog: each other. I just...
dialog: 
dialog: (off his silent back)
dialog: Do you think
dialog: we spoke about it? Iíve known
dialog: for
dialog: five years. Heís known Iíve known for
dialog: 
dialog: five years... But not once have we spoken
dialog: 
dialog: about it. There are things one just
dialog: 
dialog: doesnít speak about...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: (turning
dialog: to her, sickened)
dialog: One just doesnít...
dialog: Tell me, what does one
dialog: speak about,
dialog: huh?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Think what you like. But donít
dialog: presume to
dialog: understand.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: I donít.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Good.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Is there anything to understand?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Why do I feel I neednít answer
dialog: that?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Rich. Young. Beautiful. You
dialog: must at least
dialog: get a kick out of what
dialog: he does to his
dialog: kids.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: You bastard...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Five years of it. Surely,
dialog: youíd have
dialog: divorced him if he disgusted
dialog: you?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: You splendid bastard...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Are there truly no extenuating
dialog: circumstances?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: ...Weíre turning in circles.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: And you still havenít told
dialog: me why you sent
dialog: me after Friedman.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Maybe I wanted to give my
dialog: husband a
dialog: fright.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: A fright?... Five years of
dialog: cowardice led
dialog: to your brother being
dialog: murdered and you
dialog: wanted to give his
dialog: murderer a fright?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: I didnít know who or what
dialog: had happened to
dialog: my brother yet, Mr
dialog: Lombard!
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: What was the idea? Husband
dialog: is filled with
dialog: fear when he learns
dialog: his child supplierís
dialog: being tailed?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Something like that.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Something like that?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Something like that.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: What happened? Adonis slapped
dialog: you about a
dialog: little and you reverted
dialog: to cowardice?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Here we go again.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Where is that?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Simplify and damn.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Donít you believe in simplicity?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Should I?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: We all have to like what we
dialog: become.
dialog: Cowards included. We achieve
dialog: this by
dialog: complicating things a little.
dialog: But itís
dialog: never that complicated really.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: You seem to know what youíre
dialog: talking
dialog: about.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Perhaps it came to me while
dialog: dying in a
dialog: Californian desert because
dialog: a woman set
dialog: upon giving her husband
dialog: a fright got
dialog: slapped about a little.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: My husband didnít need to
dialog: slap me about,
dialog: Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: To get me killed...?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: I didnít intend it that way...
dialog: It just
dialog: happened.
dialog: 
dialog: (off his look: ĎJust happened...?í)
dialog: 
dialog: He heard from Laurence that youíd been
dialog: 
dialog: back.  That weíd argued. He asked why and
dialog: 
dialog: it just happened; I told him everything...
dialog: 
dialog: I couldnít help it. Wanted to see him
dialog: 
dialog: scared. I had never seen him scared
dialog: 
dialog: before, you see...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Perhaps I did... Until fear
dialog: turned into
dialog: panic. Thatís when he
dialog: hit me, and told me
dialog: heíd killed my
dialog: brother... ďYou donít know
dialog: what youíve
dialog: done,Ē he said.  ďWeíre in
dialog: deep
dialog: trouble,Ē he said. ďWe,Ē he said.
dialog: 
dialog: ďWe.Ē
dialog: (a beat as she sneers)
dialog: 
dialog: Weíd both be killed if Friedman ever found
dialog: 
dialog: out you were working for us, he said. We
dialog: 
dialog: had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
dialog: 
dialog: IN ON Lombard; sickened... She sends him a proud,
dialog: contemptuous
dialog: glance...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Fear is contagious. I donít
dialog: know if you
dialog: can or want to understand,
dialog: but I didnít
dialog: want to die because
dialog: of what heíd done...
dialog: It was you or
dialog: us...
dialog: 
text: SILENCE.  They stare at each other... She finally says, somewhat
dialog: 
dialog: menacingly:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Well, now you know, what do
dialog: you propose we
dialog: do, eh, Mr Lombard?
dialog: 
dialog: (off Lombard look of incredulity)
dialog: 
dialog: My brother and Friedman are dead.
dialog: 
dialog: (nodding towards the contact sheet)
dialog: 
dialog: That proves nothing. Indeed, you have no
dialog: 
dialog: proof of anything. And even if you did,
dialog: 
dialog: you wouldnít really go to the police,
dialog: 
dialog: would you, Inspecteur Laurent Delfosse?
dialog: 
dialog: IN ON Lombard; his eyes darken...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: The real Xavier Lombard died
dialog: six years ago
dialog: in a car accident in
dialog: Southern France... As
dialog: you know we
dialog: have friends. We asked them to
dialog: do
dialog: some research, for just such a
dialog: contingency
dialog: as this.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: 
dialog: You could have been more imaginative in
dialog: 
dialog: your choice of a new profession.
dialog: 
dialog: Especially since you made the front page
dialog: 
dialog: for shooting dead a convict in a prison
dialog: 
dialog: waiting room.
dialog: 
text: She eyeballs him... Lombard scowls, then grins, a sickened grin.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: You know something? Iíve just
dialog: seen so much
dialog: ugliness I donít think
dialog: Iíd mind four walls
dialog: and dinner served
dialog: every night at a regular
dialog: time.
dialog: 
dialog: (he turns and makes for the phone)
dialog: 
dialog: Iíd hoped to have a private word with
dialog: 
dialog: Adonis, but if thatís the way you want it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: What are you doing? You canít.
dialog: I...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: (starting to dial)
dialog: 
dialog: Do you think the boy you saved might
dialog: 
dialog: identify your husband as his purchaser,
dialog: 
dialog: Deborah? And then, your brotherís not
dialog: 
dialog: buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy
dialog: 
dialog: will...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: He... He is dead!
dialog: 
dialog: (he goes on dialling; SHE STANDS...)
dialog: 
dialog: MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!
dialog: (Lombard
dialog: turns to her, sceptical)
dialog: Call my parents.
dialog: Theyíll tell you. Call
dialog: them!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Lombard hesitates, hangs up...  IN ON Deborah; she suddenly looks
dialog: gaunt and tired...
text: Tears once again well-up in her eyes...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: Do you think weíd let him
dialog: get away with
dialog: the murder of my brother?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: We? You and your parents killed
dialog: your
dialog: husband?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: No. Not us...
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She looks dazed for a moment, reaches for a new cigarette, lights
dialog: it with a trembling hand...
text: Lombard just peers at her, waiting...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: They found his body yesterday.
dialog: In the pool
dialog: at our house in Sao Paulo.
dialog: He drowned.
dialog: Drank too much, went
dialog: for a swim and
dialog: drowned.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: (with a frown
dialog: of disbelief)
dialog: Your flunkey said he
dialog: was expected back
dialog: tonight.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: The staff donít know yet...
dialog: 
dialog: (off his baffled look)

dialog: parents, told them
dialog: everything...
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: stand)
dialog: I just couldnít take any more...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Get to the point, will you...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: My parents flew back from
dialog: Israel... Told
dialog: him they would get
dialog: him killed unless he
dialog: flew back to
dialog: Brazil immediately and agreed
dialog: to
dialog: a divorce. He flew back to Brazil...
dialog: 
dialog: (she drags deeply on her cigarette)
dialog: 
dialog: And his drowning was arranged...
dialog: 
dialog: Lombard just goes on looking at her...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: He took away five years of
dialog: my life and my
dialog: brother. He was sick,
dialog: but perhaps it
dialog: wasnít his fault...
dialog: His parents bought
dialog: young girls for
dialog: him when he reached the
dialog: age. For
dialog: him to gain sexual experience.
dialog: When
dialog: he had finished or grew tired of
dialog: 
dialog: them, they were sold off to procurers and
dialog: 
dialog: replaced. Itís common practice in Brazil,
dialog: 
dialog: he said. The wealthy buy the children of
dialog: 
dialog: starving parents. He got a taste for it...
dialog: 
dialog: Lombard just watches her... no sympathy whatsoever
dialog: in his eyes...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: So you did talk about it,
dialog: huh?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: On... Once...
dialog: 
dialog: (off Lombardís look: ĎOnce, eh...í)
dialog: 
dialog: Once... What are we... you going to do?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: What do you suggest?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: I donít know. Everyoneís dead...

speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: (he nods, A LONG
dialog: BEAT, then:)
dialog: Your parents arranged
dialog: the visit to my
dialog: office?
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She nods... Lombard makes for the table, turns the contact sheet
dialog: over...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Tell them to meet me there
dialog: in the main
dialog: square at two tomorrow.
dialog: They better be
dialog: there. And no bad
dialog: things. Iíve taken
dialog: precautions against
dialog: bad things.
dialog: 
dialog: She peers at...

speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: What are you going to do?
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Lombard peers at her, icily... She just looks back, shaken, but
dialog: defiant...
dialog:

speaker_heading: LOMBARD
dialog: Why the hell couldnít you
dialog: divorce the man?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: (she dithers, sneers...)

dialog: You wouldnít understand.
dialog:

speaker_heading: DEBORAH
