scene_heading: 1. MAIN TITLES
text: A shaft of moonlight indicates that the period is night. In an open jewel case lined with black
text: velvet, a collection of women’s jewelry is displayed. Necklaces, bracelets, rings, wristwatches
text: represent an expensive assortment of emeralds, rubies, diamonds and sapphires. They are in
text: careless arrangement, as though the owner had just taken some of them off the night before
dialog: and had been too tired to put them away in a place of safety.
text: After the last title has gone off, a pair of black-gloved hands come into the picture—and with
text: soundless and expert dexterity, remove the jewelry from the case.
scene_heading: 2. EXT. ROOFTOP-(NIGHT)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: A large black cat is seen stealthily going up a steep tiled roof. For a moment, it disappears

scene_heading: 3. INT. HOTEL ROOM-~(DAY)-CLOSEUP
text: There is a sharp contrast in light. It is now broad day-light. The screen is completely filled
text: with a big head of a middle-aged woman. Her face is covered with cold cream and her grey
text: hair is tied up in a chiffon scarf. She has four gold teeth, which are easily seen in her wide-
text: open, screaming mouth. Still screaming, she looks down.
scene_heading: INSERT-THE EMPTY JEWEL CASE
scene_heading: 4. INT. HOTEL ROOM-(DAY)—CLOSEUP
text: Her head moves away from the CAMERA as we now begin to see her full, night-robed figure
text: running around the room in a helpless panic. She sees the open french windows leading to
text: a balcony. She dashes over and through the windows into the sunlight.
scene_heading: 5. EXT. HOTEL BALCONY-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: Her balcony is on the fifth floor of the hotel. She emerges and starts to scream out at the
text: world at large. Beyond her we see the whole curving sweep of the sea-front at Cannes. The
text: amount of traffic and people indicates that it is nearing midday. Some of the passersby turn
text: to stare up at her.

text: 6. INSERT.
text: It is night. A dresser drawer, pulled open silently, gives us a glimpse of another collection of

text: A full, comprehensive and beautiful shot of Monte Carlo.
scene_heading: 14. EXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS, NICE-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: There is a uniformed guard at the door. A car waits by the curb. The motor is running, the
text: doors are open on the side facing the buildings. Four men come out of the building, and
text: down the steps. All are in civilian clothes. They quickly enter the car. The doors slam shut
text: and the car moves off. THE CAMERA PANS IT UP the main thoroughfare.. It is soon lost
text: in the stream of traffic.
scene_heading: LAP DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 15. EXT. MOUNTAINS-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: A panoramic view of the mountains behind the French Riviera. A winding road coils from
text: the foreground into the distant mountains, where it disappears. The police car is laboring up
text: the incline. The CAMERA PANS OFF it and looks farther into the distance.
scene_heading: LAP DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 16. EXT. MOUNTAINS-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: Another view of the mountains beyond-the snow-capped peaks in the distance. Far away to
text: the left, a villa sits atop a small rise. It is about two or three miles away from us. At that
text: range, it looks small.
scene_heading: LAP. DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 17. EXT. VILLA-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: The villa, and its flower gardens, fills the screen.
scene_heading: LAP DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 18. EXT. VILLA (DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: The front door of the villa opens. A middle-aged, portly housekeeper emerges and shakes
text: out a dust cloth. She goes back into the villa.
scene_heading: 19. INT. ROBIE’S LIVING ROOM (DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: It is a large, attractive, masculine room. It is lined with books, and a few good oil paintings.
text: There are many flowers in the room. The housekeeper returns from the door and goes on
text: with her dusting. The CAMERA PANS AROUND the room and comes to rest at an
text: armchair. It CLOSES IN on a sleeping black cat. The cat is lying on a folded newspaper.
text: THE CAMERA CLOSES in on the cat and the newspaper.
scene_heading: 19A. INSERT
text: The newspaper, showing the name of it as “The Paris Herald Tribune”. It is open to the
text: leading paragraph in the Art Buchwald Column suggests that the famous, pre-war jewel thief
text: called The Cat—or, as he is known in France, Le Chat—has now become active again on the
text: Riviera. He had reformed after becoming a hero in the war, but apparently has decided not
text: to let well enough alone. The cat’s paw reaches out, stretches its claws, and tears down
text: through the center of the column.
scene_heading: 19B. INT. ROBE’S LIVING ROOM-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: The. CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN UP from the newspaper to the open window. We see
text: into the garden beyond, where John Robie is snipping dead blooms off his rose bushes.
scene_heading: 20. EXT. ROBIE’S GARDEN-(DAY)—MEDIUM SHOT
text: John Robie, age thirty-five, is dressed in casual country clothes. The CAMERA MOVES
text: SLOWLY IN, and as it reaches his head and shoulders, we hear the faint whine of the
text: approaching car. Robie’s head begins to turn suspiciously.
scene_heading: 21. INT. ROBIE’S LIVING ROOM-(DAY)—CLOSEUP
text: The cat in the armchair raises its head as though it senses something disturbing in the air.
scene_heading: 22. EXT. ROBIE’S GARDEN-(DAY)-SEMI CLOSE
text: Robie’s head turns and looks out toward the approaching road.
scene_heading: 23. EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: Robie’s garden is in the foreground, but far beyond we see the winding mountain road and
text: the automobile approaching. A light cloud of dust hangs behind it.
scene_heading: 2 . EXT. ROBIE’S GARDEN-(DAY) SEMI CLOSEUP
text: Robie studies the oncoming car for a moment, then turns back slowly to snip off another
text: bloom. He looks out once more, and turns and makes his way back to the villa, THE
text: CAMERA PANNING with him. We see him pass through the French windows, into the
dialog: living room.
scene_heading: 25. INT. ROME’S LIVING ROOM-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Robie crosses the living room and makes some comment to his housekeeper who is still
text: dusting around. We see him mount some stairs in the hallway beyond. He does not seem to
text: be in any particular hurry, yet his movements seem definite and purposeful.
scene_heading: 26. INT. LANDING-(DAY)—-MEDIUM SHOT
text: We see Robie pass through a door into his second-floor bedroom.
scene_heading: 27. INT. ROBIE’S BEDROOM-~(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Robie comes into the room, and strolls over toward the dormer window. THE CAMERA
text: MOVES FORWARD TO meet him, until his head and shoulders fill the screen. He looks out
text: of the window with studied caution, standing far enough back to avoid exposing himself.
scene_heading: 28. EXT. MOUNTAINS-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: Through the foreground window, we see the car approaching along the main highway. It
text: slows down, and then turns into Robie’s driveway.
scene_heading: 29. INT. ROBIE’S BEDROOM-~(DAY)-CLOSEUP
text: Robie’s eyes travel with the car along the driveway. He makes the slightest movement back-
dialog: ward.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY-(DAY)-SEMI LONG SHOT
text: The car circles around and faces the roadway again. It stops, the doors open and four men
text: get out, the driver remaining in the car. We see the leader issuing instructions to the men.
text: He is obviously directing them to surround the house. They move off to their various
text: stations. The leader and his assistant approach the front door, until they disappear under the
text: edge of the roof.
scene_heading: 31. INT. ROBIE’S BEDROOM-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Ina business-like way, Robie moves to a clothes closet, opens it, and produces a long canvas
text: case and a small yellow box.
text: From the case he takes a double-barrelled shotgun. From the yellow box he takes two shells,
text: and loads them into the gun. He snaps the gun shut, then releases the safety catch. THE
text: CAMERA PANS HIM to a nearby chintz-covered armchair, and he lays the loaded gun
text: across the arms. He now assumes a more nonchalant attitude, and strolls through the
text: bedroom door.
text: During all this, we have heard knocking on the door, the muffled voices of the men and the
text: replies of his housekeeper—all in French. As Robie reaches the bedroom door, we hear the
text: voice of his housekeeper calling up to him.
dialog: GERMAINE: Monsieur Robie!
scene_heading: 32. INT. LANDING-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: In the foreground at the top of the stairs, Robie is emerging from his room. We see
text: Germaine standing at the foot of the stairs. AS he descends, Germaine says:
dialog: GERMAINE: Deux messieurs vous demandent.
dialog: ROBIE: Mercie, Germaine.
text: She stands aside to let him pass, casting a very sour and critical glance at the two policemen.
text: As Robie turns into the living room, Germaine retires to her kitchen, giving another defiant
text: and unfriendly look at the police.
scene_heading: 33 INT. ROBIE’S LIVING ROOM-(DAY)-SEMLLONG SHOT
text: The two detectives stand in the foreground, their backs to the CAMERA. They are about five
text: feet apart. Beyond them, at the other end of the room, we see Robie enter. He advances into
text: the room a few steps, then stops and looks at them enquiringly. There is something about
text: his manner that seems strange. He waits for them to speak. The man on the right announces
dialog: his name.
dialog: LEPIC: Lepic.
dialog: The second man speaks:
speaker_heading: MERCIER: Mercier.
text: Robie looks at them, waiting.
dialog: LEPIC: Monsieur Robie, nous appartenons a la Sureté Nationale.

dialog: Pobligeance de nous accompagner a notre Bureau de Nice?
scene_heading: 34. INT. LIVING ROOM-CLOSEUP
text: During this, Robie has listened impassively, although by the expression in his eyes, we see
text: an alert brain at work.
scene_heading: 35. INT. ROBIE’S LIVING ROOM ~(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Robie crosses to the window and looks out.
scene_heading: 36. INT. ROBIE’S LIVING ROOM-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT The menst heads turn as they

scene_heading: 39. INT. ROBIE’S LIVING ROOM-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Robie turns and moves out of the room towards the stair,— case. As he goes up the stairs:
scene_heading: 40. INT. Robie’s LIVING ROOM (DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: ‘he two men exchange suspicious glances. Lepic gestures Mercier to stay where he is. Then
text: Lepic moves softly and quickly toward the staircase, THE CAMERA PANNING WITH
speaker_heading: HIM.
scene_heading: 41. INT. ROBIE’S HALLWAY (DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Lepic comes to the foot of the stairs just as the door above is closing. We hear a definite click
text: as the door is being locked. Lepic quickly turns and calls out:
dialog: LEPIC: Mercier!
text: He turns back and hurries up the stairs. Halfway up, Lepic, the stairway and the doorway
text: are rocked by the loud EXPLOSION of a gun going off. As Lepic reaches the top, and
text: Mercier dashes in the hallway, we hear the loud THUD of a falling body .
scene_heading: 42. EXT. FRONT PORCH (DAY)-SEMI LONG SHOT
text: The drivers jump out of the car, and rush for the front door.
scene_heading: 43. EXT. ROBIE’S GARDEN (DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: From the roof of the villa we see below us the posted detectives now converging on the
text: house. They run around and pile in through the front door, THE CAMERA PANNING with
dialog: them.
text: THE CAMERA PANS BACK to a small dormer window on the roof. The head of John
text: Robie appears. A pair of shoes are tied around his neck. Behind him, and in the house below,
text: we hear pounding, shouting and loud voices. His expression and manner are business-like.
text: He shows no panic.
scene_heading: 44. EXT. ROBIE’S ROOF (DAY)-SEMI LONG SHOT
text: He emerges from the window, and his stockinged feet, and makes his way along the roof
text: toward the end of the house. He moves with experienced ease over the tiles. Reaching the
text: end of the house, he starts to lower himself down a drain pipe.
scene_heading: 45. INT. HALLWAY-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Lepic and Mercier are at the top of the stairs, trying to force the door open, while the other

scene_heading: 47. INT. ROBIE’S BEDROOM-(DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP

text: in sudden alarm by what they see.
scene_heading: 48/. INT. ROBIE’S BEDROOM (DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP
scene_heading: FROM THEIR VIEWPOINT
text: An overturned wing armchair, with the double-barreled gun propped to point ominously at
dialog: them.
scene_heading: 49. INT. POKE’S BEDROOM (DAY)-SEMI LONG SHOT
text: Shooting over the armchair and gun. They advance cautiously into the room. At this moment
text: there is the SOUND of a car starting up, and driving away with a burst of speed. Without
text: bothering to go to the window, instinctively knowing what happened, they immediately turn
text: and rush back through the doorway. We hear the thunder of RUNNING FEET on the floor
text: below as the other detectives rush for the outside door.
scene_heading: 50. EXT. ROBIE’S DRIVEWAY (DAY)-SEMI LONG SHOT HELICOPTER
text: The police car in the driveway. Beyond it we see the front door of the house. The detectives
text: rush out, and look out toward the roadway where we hear the SOUND of the other car
text: driving away.
text: Lepic dashes out, and issues some swift orders. Then they hurry toward the automobile.
text: They pile in quickly, and the car starts off.
text: THE CAMERA PULLS BACK AND AWAY from the villa, as we see the car turn from the
text: driveway into the main, winding highway. THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK
text: until we get a great, wide, panoramic shot of the mountains, with the diminutive police car
text: racing down the twisting road.
text: Presently, the Robie’s yellow-colored convertible comes into view, and we can see the
text: distance between the two cars. We are possibly a mile away from them.
scene_heading: 51. EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD ~(DAY)-LONG SHOT-(HELICOPTER)
text: The CAMERA SKIMS the rooftops of a village, and it travels along with the two cars as they
dialog: tear their way through.
scene_heading: 52. EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD-(DAY)-LONG SHOT-(HELICOPTER)
text: Once more the cars are on the open highway. THE CAMERA MOVES ALONG with them,
text: and they approach a village which is of the medieval, walled-in, type. THE CAMERA, in
text: mid-air, loses them as they enter this village.
text: THE CAMERA TRAVERSES along the outer walls so that we only hear the SOUND of the
text: cars racing through the village. We reach the other end of the village and, to our surprise,
text: it is the police car which emerges first.
text: The car pulls up suddenly, and one or two of the policemen get out and look down the
text: highway, on which there is no car in sight. Abruptly, Robie’s car roars out of the village past
text: them. The police jump back into their car, and resume the pursuit.
scene_heading: 52A. EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: The police car comes alongside Robie’s car and forces it to a stop at the side of the road.
scene_heading: 52B. EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: The police pile out of their car, and move quickly to the side of Robie’s yellow convertible.
text: For the first time we see that Robie is not at the wheel, but that Germaine, his housekeeper,
text: is the driver. She expostulates vigorously for being driven over to the side of the road.

text: Robie, looking down at the bird—dead pan.

scene_heading: 75. EXT. INTERSECTION, MONTE-CARLO-(DAY) SEMI LONG SHOT
text: In the foreground is an ordinary patrol policeman. At the other side of the street we see the
text: bus pull up. One or two passengers alight, including Robie. He comes around the back of the
text: bus, and crosses the roadway toward the CAMERA.
text: Halfway across he spots the policeman. We see him stiffen a little, but he comes on cau-
text: tiously without changing his pace. As he nears the policeman, he raises a flat palm towards
text: his face, while he contorts his face into an exaggerated yawn. It is a simple and effective
text: momentary disguise. As he passes the policeman and move on out of the picture, the
text: policeman turns casually and follows him with his eyes. Then the policeman also begins to
text: yawn. His mouth opens wide and his eyes close, as he turns away.
scene_heading: 76. REVERSE ANGLE-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: We see Robie approaching some steps leading to a smart little restaurant situated on the dock
dialog: side of Monte Carlo.
scene_heading: 77. EXT. BERTANI’S RESTAURANT-(DAY)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: We see Robie descend the steps, and the garden section at the restaurant. It is mid-day, and
text: the customers are arriving for luncheon. The well-appointed tables indicate that this
text: restaurant has some special quality. There are plenty of waiters, and the clientele are of the
dialog: well-to-do and fashionable set.
text: ‘We see Robie approach the garden entrance to the restaurant.
scene_heading: 78. EXT. BERTANI’S RESTAURANT-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Robie enters behind a small group of people who are waiting for a table. The headwaiter
text: motions the group forward to a table, leaving Robie exposed at the entrance, alone. His
text: country clothes contrast sharply with the sophisticated atmosphere.
scene_heading: 79. EXT. BERTANI’S RESTAURANT-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Ata nearby table, the wine waiter is uncorking a bottle of champagne for a couple. He looks
text: up, as he turns the cork. A slightly startled look comes into his face as he sees Robie. At this
text: moment, the cork pops. He still stares at Robie.
speaker_heading: 80. INSERT
text: The foam from the champagne spills out of the neck of the bottle over the waiter’s hands.

text: Robie gives a faint smile and a slight admonishing shake of the head.
scene_heading: 82. EXT. BERTANI’S RESTAURANT-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: The waiter recovers, and turns to his customers to mutter an apology. A busboy hurries up
text: with a napkin to dry the bottle and the waiter’s hands.
scene_heading: 83. EXT. BERTANI’S RESTAURANT-(DAY)-CLOSEUP
text: Robie’s attention leaves the waiter, as he scans the restaurant, looking for someone. Suddenly
text: his eye catches sight of:
scene_heading: 84. EXT. BERTANI’S RESTAURANT-(DAY)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: Aman who is obviously the restaurant owner. His eye catches sight of something. He hurries
text: across to a table near the center of the garden at which is seated a small party, including a
dialog: man who might possibly be King Farouk.
text: A waiter is just about to hand the King a menu, when Bertani intercepts it, and with a nod
text: of his head orders the waiter to another duty. He then bends graciously toward’ he King,
dialog: inviting his order.
scene_heading: 85. EXT. BERTANI’S RESTAURANT-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Robie watches him for a fraction of a second, and then moves over toward him, THE
text: CAMERA PANNING. He hesitates by Farouk’s table long enough to cause Bertani to glance
text: up at him. Having caught Bertani’s eye, he moves on, and the CAMERA PANS HIM toward
text: the entrance to the restaurant proper.
scene_heading: 86. EXT. BERTANI’S RESTAURANT-(DAY)-CLOSEUP
text: A big head of Bertani as we hear the voice of Farouk giving his order in French. Bertani’s
text: eyes turn for a moment to follow Robie.
scene_heading: 87. INT. BERTANI’S RESTAURANT-(DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP
text: At the back of the restaurant, in a small enclosed counter, sits the cashier, Antoinette. She
text: is a plain girl, with a body more interesting than her face. A look of recognition, and slight
text: alarm, comes into her face, as we see her eyes follow Robie’s progress through the restaurant.
text: We do not see Robie, until he appears behind her, passing into the glass-enclosed office at
text: the back of her desk.
scene_heading: 88. INT. BERTANI’S OFFICE-(DAY)—-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Robie enters the office, closes the door. The office is perhaps twelve feet square, with
text: windows that look out to the kitchen, and toward the cashier’s stand which is outside the left
text: wall. There is an open doorway leading to the cashier’s stand. Beyond the cashier, the central
text: room of the restaurant can be seen, dark in the daytime, and beyond that the outside garden
text: restaurant, crowded and busy.
text: THE CAMERA PANS Robie over to one aide of the office, which consists of a large wood
text: and glass partition, beyond which we can see the kitchen.
scene_heading: 89. INT. BERTANI’S OFFICE-(DAY)—CLOSEUP
text: Robie looks out the glass partition toward the kitchen. His glance is an impersonal one, his
text: mind seemingly occupied with his immediate problem. Then something attracts his attention.
scene_heading: 90. INT. KITCHEN-(DAY)-MED. SHOT
text: One of the chefs is staring at him ina rather unfriendly manner. This Man immediately turns
text: and starts to move along the other chefs and kitchen Workers. Here and there he stops to
text: whisper something. As he speaks to each one, they give a half turn and look across toward
text: Robie. Then they turn back to resume their tasks.
scene_heading: 9 INT. KITCHEN-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Through the glass partition we see Robie watching this process with sober expression.
text: Suddenly, without warning, a fresh egg smashes against the glass right over his face. The
text: yellow goo appears to run down over him. He moves slowly away, and we see a grim smile
text: on his face.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN-(DAY) MEDIUM SHOT
text: From his viewpoint. No one paying any attention. The activities of the kitchen bustle on.
scene_heading: 93. INT. BERTANI’S OFFICE-(DAY).-MED. SHOT
text: Robie’s attention is attracted by the entrance of Bertani, a heavy-set, rather dapper man.
text: Beneath his carefully chosen wardrobe, and a certain professional air that is over-friendly and
text: slightly comic, his strength as a leader of men is still evident. His eyes quickly appraise
text: Robie’s rough attire. .
dialog: BERTANI: Left in a hurry eh?
dialog: ROBIE : They came for me an hour ago.
dialog: BERTANI: The police?
dialog: ROBIE: Five of therm.
dialog: BERTANI: Very flattering. Five.
text: He strolls-to a wall mirror, checks his tie and the hang of his coat. .
text: BERTANI: They sent only four to arrest Bluebeard.
dialog: ROBIE: And he was guilty.
dialog: BERTANI: (Friendly but pointed) And naturally, you are innocent.
dialog: ROBIE: (Firmly) I haven’t stolen a piece of jewelry in fifteen
dialog: years!
text: Bertani turns from the mirror, reacts with a smile.
dialog: BERTANI: Ah—honesty.
dialog: ROBIE: It has a good feeling.
text: Bertani casts a look toward his kitchen.
dialog: BERTANI: What do you-think of my kitchen? Works like a machine,
dialog: yes?
speaker_heading: ROBIE: (Impatient) Bertani—
text: Bertani turns and interrupts.
text: BERTANI: Just like our little band in the Resistance—cutting, slicing
dialog: —but not good meat, like this.
dialog: ROBIE: Have you ever gone hungry, Bertani?
dialog: BERTANI: (Chuckling) Me? Permit me to serve you now. Roti de
dialog: veau Marengo, pommes de terre nouvelles, et champignons
dialog: de Paris.
dialog: ROBIE: Your prices are too high. Now let’s get down to business.
text: Bertani strolls to his desk, looks over a menu.
dialog: BERTANI: The recent jewel robberies. Entre nous, what do, you
dialog: know about them?
dialog: ROBIE: Only what I read in the papers.
dialog: BERTANI: (Looks up) But yet you run from the flics?
dialog: ROBIE: The guilty have no monopoly on running. I needed time
dialog: —and distance.
dialog: BERTANI: (Thoughtfully) Coincidence can be terrible. These rob-
dialog: beries all bear your mark—but you claim to be innocent.
text: Robie’s face hardens a little.
dialog: ROBIE I do more than claim, Bertani—I insist.
dialog: BERTANI: Naturally —but let’s be frank. What do you need, Robie,
dialog: an alibi for the time of each robbery?
text: Robie looks at him a moment. The look is unfriendly.
dialog: ROBIE: Well, thank you, Bertani. You’ve been most unkind. If ’m
dialog: ever hungry, I’ll eat someplace else.
text: He starts for the door. Bertani quickly moves around the desk and intercepts him. He gives
text: Robie what passes for a warm smile.
text: BERTANI: I felt the good thing in here... (He taps his chest) but said
dialog: the bad thing.
text: At this moment we see Antoinette tapping-the window in the background. The headwaiter
text: is standing beyond her desk, waiting. Bertani turns and opens the door. Antoinette hands him
text: two or three chits to sign.

text: Beyond the egg-splattered glass partition, we see a couple of the kitchen workers looking
text: around toward the office. They are La Mule, the dishwasher, and one of the chefs. Their
text: appraisal of Robie is distinctly unfriendly.
scene_heading: 96. INT. BERTANI’S OFFICE-(DAY)—CLOSEUP
text: Robie gives them a challenging smile. Bertani’s voice breaks in, causing him to turn back.
text: The CAMERA PULLS BACK as Robie takes a step or two towards the returning Bellini.
dialog: BERTANI: What can I do for you, Robie?
dialog: ROBIE: All I want is someone to look after my villa—pay Ger-
dialog: maine and the gardener once a month, and get a good
dialog: price for my grapes.
text: Bertani’s gestures indicate that the request is so simple that. Robie should never have worried
dialog: about it.
dialog: BERTANI: Simple.
dialog: ROBIE: If there’s any money left—put it in the bank under
dialog: another name. Well, the flics might show up here any
dialog: minute—
dialog: BERTANI: (Interrupting, concerned) And now—you need clothes and
dialog: money? (Indicates his own suit)
dialog: ROBIE: I’m well supplied, thanks.
text: He moves a little toward the door, Bertani stops him.
dialog: BERTANI: Take my boat and go to the islands.
dialog: ROBIE: (Smiles) ’'m thinking of going home to America.
dialog: BERTANI: Oh, that’s a long way—and you believe you could live
dialog: without French cooking?
dialog: ROBIE: I'll have to struggle along on hamburgers and malts.
dialog: BERTANI: (Holds his stomach) No, it is better I hide you.
text: ROBIE: (Smiles, shakes his head) America. If my luck holds out.
dialog: BERTANI: And if not?
dialog: ROBIE: You (Nods toward kitchen) and the boys will have won
dialog: yourselves a villa—heavily mortgaged.
text: An expression of deep pain and concern comes over Bertani’s face. He goes to the window
text: facing the kitcheri, THE CAMERA PANNING with him, and CLOSING IN, until the screen
text: is filled with his head and the yellow goo of the egg on the glass partition. Bertani sees the
text: egg, and then quickly looks around it into the kitchen.
scene_heading: 97 INT. KITCHEN-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: From his viewpoint, we see the dishwasher, and two of the other kitchen helpers, who have
text: been staring at Robie, turn back to their jobs self-consciously.
scene_heading: 98. INT. BERTANI’S OFFICE-(DAY)— MEDIUM SHOT
text: As Bertani turns questioningly to Robie, Antoinette taps on the door. She opens it, and, then
text: says urgently, as she points out toward the restaurant:
dialog: 11
dialog: ANTOINETTE: Monsieur Bertani! Les clients attendent pour avoir des
dialog: tables!
dialog: BERTANI: Excuse me, Robie. Business calls—Happy sound.
text: Bertani turns and leaves the office. Robie turns, and THE CAMERA PANS him over to the
text: glass door that leads through the partition into the kitchen.
scene_heading: 99. INT. KITCHEN-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Robie stands in the doorway of the kitchen, the office behind him. His attitude clearly
text: indicates that he is not in the least intimidated by their hostility. His attention is drawn. to
text: one of the younger members of the kitchen staff.
scene_heading: 100. INT. KITCHEN-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: This kitchen helper is a boy about twenty. He is grinning across at Robie. He takes a saucer
text: and pours some milk into it.
scene_heading: 101. INT. KITCHEN-(DAY)-CLOSEUP
text: Robie looks at the boy without displaying any emotion. His eye is caught by something else.
text: He turns to see:
scene_heading: 102. INT. KITCHEN-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: The same wine waiter we met when Robie entered the restaurant through the garden. He is
text: coming up the cellar stairs carrying a couple of bottles of wine. He limps slightly. As he
text: approaches THE CAMERA, we hear Robie’s voice off:
dialog: ROBIE: Bonjour, Foussard.
text: Foussard gives a cold stare and passes the CAMERA.
scene_heading: 103. INT. KITCHEN-(DAY)-CLOSEUP
text: Robie’s eyes follow him briefly, and then stop as they see:
scene_heading: 104. INT. KITCHEN-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: A vegetable chef is in the act of twisting the tops of a bunch of carrots. As he stares at Robie,
text: his hands twist viciously and menacingly.
scene_heading: 105. INT. KITCHEN-(DAY)-CLOSEUP
text: Robie grins at this. We hear a voice from the other end of the kitchen.
dialog: LA MULE: Allez-vous en, Robie!
text: Robie turns his head in the direction of the voice.
scene_heading: 106. INT. KITCHEN-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: At the dishwashing sinks, full of soapy water, with steam rising from them, stands a hairy
text: mountain of a man. They call him La Mule. His look toward Robie is one of pure hatred.
scene_heading: 107. INT. KITCHEN-(DAY)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: We now get a view of the whole kitchen. At the sound of La Mule’s voice ordering Robie
text: out of the kitchen, the place falls quiet. Work is forgotten as the chefs and their helpers turn
text: to look at Robie. Foussard watches.
text: Robie stands his ground, keeping his eyes on the dishwasher. La Mule carefully wipes his
text: hands on his apron, and then picks up a plate. He smashes it in half against the sinks, and
text: advances on Robie with a jagged half of plate held threateningly in his right hand.
scene_heading: 108. INT. KITCHEN-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Robie doesn’t move. He guardedly watches La Mule.

scene_heading: 110. INT. KITCHEN-(DAY)-CLOSEUP

scene_heading: 111. INTO KITCHEN-(DAY)-CLOSEUP
text: Robie’s hand slides behind him, and picks up one of the two bottles of wine just deposited
text: there by Foussard, the wine waiter. The hands come forward, and fling the bottle out of the
dialog: picture.
scene_heading: 112. INT. KITCHEN-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: The bottle sails out toward the oncoming dishwasher. He is forced, by instinct, to drop the
text: broken half of the plate, and catch the bottle of wine in both hands.
scene_heading: 113. INT. KITCHEN-(DAY)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: The kitchen workers, despite their allegiance to the dishwasher, burst into sudden laughter
text: at seeing La Mule so neatly disarmed and his menacing attitude turned into confusion.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: This only serves to increase Li Mule’s rage. He grips the neck of the wine bottle and
text: advances farther toward Robie. Suddenly, the voice of Bertani sounds off:
dialog: BERTANI: La Mule! Pose cette bouteille et retourne a to vaisselle! En
dialog: vitesse, hein!
scene_heading: 115. INT. KITCHEN-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Robie has turned as Bertani beckons him back into the office. As Robie starts to go, he gives
text: one more glance at La Mule, and then as a parting shot, picks up a glass and tosses it out of
dialog: the picture.
scene_heading: 116. INT. BERTANI’S OFFICE-(DAY)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: Through the open door we see La Mule now catch the glass in his other hand. There are a
text: few more laughs from the kitchen hands. As Bertani closes the door we see the wine waiter,
text: Foussard, cross and snatch the bottle away from La Mule. We cannot hear what he says, but
text: he indicates that the wine is now so shaken up it’s not usable. As La Mule turns angrily away,
text: the rest of the kitchen hands resume their various tasks. Bertani closes the office door, then
dialog: mutters:
dialog: BERTANI: C’est l’heure du dejeuner, pas de la rigolade!
dialog: ROBIE: Even they think I’m operating again.
text: The CAMERA CLOSES IN on them.
dialog: BERTANI: Well—once they were all in prison with you—so the
dialog: police think...
dialog: ROBIE: Don’t tell me. “One bad apple spoils the barrel.”
dialog: BERTANI: (Nods) But since the Resistance, I have obliged all these
dialog: men to be honest. I have beat honesty into their skulls—I
dialog: did not want them to break their paroles and return to
dialog: prison.
dialog: ROBIE: Listen, if my parole is broken, they’II throw the key away.
dialog: BERTANI: Remember, Robie—some of them have families to think
dialog: of now.
dialog: 13
text: Robie looks out to the kitchen.
dialog: ROBIE: I wouldn’t put it past any one of them to be doing the
text: robberies themselves.
dialog: BERTANI: (Chuckles) Simple men—without education? No, Robie.
dialog: Maybe kill somebody in the dark, but steal jewels, no.
dialog: ROBIE: (Turns) And I wouldn’t put it past you.
text: Bertani bubbles with good humor as he checks himself in his wall mirror again.
dialog: BERTANI: I have restaurant, that’s enough. And I can’t even climb
text: stairs now without—(Demonstrates puffing)
text: He turns back. There is a look of concern on his face.
dialog: BERTANI: It’s time to go if the flics come.
text: Robie seems to be thinking to himself.
dialog: ROBIE: What I can’t understand is how this thief can imitate me
dialog: so perfectly. It has to be somebody who knew every detail
dialog: of my technique. (Looks up) Maybe somebody in the
dialog: police.
dialog: BERTANI: (Chuckles at the thought) Ah—voila!
dialog: ROBIE: He picks the perfect victims—only the right stones—he
text: goes up walls, over roofs, down through skylights—
text: dresses in black—leaves no clues, and disappears in the
dialog: night.
dialog: BERTANI: Just like John Robie, The Cat.
dialog: ROBIE: (Flashes) You don’t believe me any more than the rest!
dialog: BERTANI: (Appears distressed) Robie, you’re nervous as a c—
dialog: (Smiles) I nearly said “cat”.
text: ROBIE: I know. (He paces, thinking) The imitation is so faultless
dialog: I sometimes wake up thinking I did the jobs myself. (With
dialog: some bitterness) And | don’t like running, hiding and
text: leaving a trail of doubt in everybody’s mind.
dialog: BERTANI: I shall defend you when I can.
dialog: ROBIE: Bertani—the only true defenses a man has are his own
dialog: actions.
text: He moves restlessly.
dialog: BERTANI: (Sincerely) John, sometimes a fellow must run. (He looks
text: off nervously out toward the restaurant) Robie—the
dialog: police—any moment.
dialog: ROBIE: If somebody caught this—imitator, we'd all be off the
dialog: hook, wouldn’t we?
dialog: BERTANI: Surely.
dialog: ROBIE: Nobody believes me—and the police are chasing the
dialog: wrong man. Someone’s got to start chasing the right one.
dialog: BERTANI: You couldn’t do more than the police!
dialog: 14
dialog: ROBIE: The police always get to the scene of a job after it
dialog: happens. With this kind of a thief, that’s a waste of time.
dialog: BERTANI: How could you move around the Cote d’Azur?—They’re
dialog: all looking for you.
dialog: ROBIE: They were looking for me in Paris fifteen years ago and I
dialog: gave them a pretty good chase.
dialog: BERTANI: One day he’ll make a mistake.
dialog: ROBIE: (Shakes his head) I only made one mistake. If he knows so
dialog: much about me, he won’t repeat it. (Long pause, then;)
dialog: Bertani—there’s only one answer. I should have seen it
dialog: sooner. I’ve got to find this imitator myself—and find him
dialog: quick!
dialog: BERTANI: (Throws up his hands) You’re mad. How could you catch
dialog: this other Cat?
dialog: ROBIE: (Gets warmed up) There’s only one way. Anticipate his
text: moves. Get there ahead of him, and then find him with
text: his hand right in somebody’s jewel case.
text: Robie paces away, and then returns to Bertani who is watching his performance with
dialog: fascination.
dialog: BERTANI: (Shakes his head) Huh uh. If they catch you, nobody will
dialog: believe what you say.
dialog: ROBIE: Who believes me now?
dialog: BERTANI: (A thoughtful pause) Suppose they catch you—and the
dialog: robberies continue?
dialog: ROBIE: I'd be a free man in an hour.
dialog: BERTANI: You believe so?

scene_heading: 22. INT. BERTANI’S OFFICE-(DAY)—CLOSEUP
text: Robie stares at Bertani, a little puzzled. Bertani’s voice continues:
dialog: BERTANI: Think of this. If Iam your imitator, and you are caught
dialog: —what is it I do?
text: Robie has caught the implications.
speaker_heading: ROBIE: Hmmm.
scene_heading: 123. INT. BERTANI’S OFFICE-(DAY)—CLOSEUP
text: Bertani watches Robie’s face.
dialog: BERTANI: I stop stealing—and they never find me.
scene_heading: 121. INT. BERTANI’S OFFICE-(DAY) CLOSEUP
text: Robie is thoughtful for a moment. Then he says:
dialog: ROBIE: You have a rare skill for inspiring confidence.
text: Robie moves away, around the room, as THE CAMERA PULLS BACK and includes Bertani.
text: Bertani’s eyes follow him.
dialog: ROBIE: The biggest problem is time. I’ve got to hit this copy-cat
dialog: before he knows I’m after him.
dialog: 15
text: He paces, thinking.
dialog: ROBIE: To catch him in the act. I need better information than he
dialog: has. The kind it takes months. to dig out.
dialog: BERTANI: Like—who has jewelry that deserves to be stolen?
dialog: ROBIE: (Adds, quickly) Where they live, which room they keep
dialog: the stones in, and what time they usually go to sleep, how
dialog: much they drink, whether they have dogs, guns, servants,
dialog: insurance—
text: He runs out of words. He walks away, stops, turns back. During this, Bertani has seated
text: himself at his desk. He opens the drawer, and begins to rummage through it, a thoughtful
text: look on his face. He seems to find what he was looking for. He takes out a visiting card,
text: studies it. Robie comes forward quickly and leans over the desks THE CAMERA CLOSING
dialog: IN.
dialog: ROBIE: Come on, Bertani—what have you got?
dialog: BERTANI: You made me remember. Two days ago a man came into
dialog: my restaurant. (Smiles) I didn’t like him.
speaker_heading: ROBIE: Why?
dialog: BERTANI: He called me to his table; he asked me about crime and
dialog: criminals. Me! A respectable, honest, restaurateur!
dialog: ROBIE: (Smiles) See what it is when your past catches up with
dialog: you, Bertani?
dialog: BERTANI: Then he ask me insidious questions, I refuse to answer.

scene_heading: 128. INT. KITCHEN-(DAY)-SEMI LONG SHOT
text: Foussard, the wine steward, hastily enters the kitchen. He steps quickly from the chef to the

scene_heading: 129. INT. BERTANI’S OFFICE-(DAY)—-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Bertani turns from the doorway to the restaurant. He goes past Robie and opens the kitchen

text: Shooting up at Danielle’s face, which registers surprise. Moreover, she doesn’t move off the
text: ladder. She is a well-built French girl, of perhaps twenty-four years, with a frank and
text: attractive face. Her light summer dress, although not expensive, expresses a definite taste:
text: to show that she is not one of Bertani’s regular employees.
scene_heading: 132. INT. WINE CELLAR (DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: The two men approach her, and THE CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to include her in

dialog: upwards
dialog: FOUSSARD: Les flics viennent de s’amener (Nodding to Robie)...Ils

text: Danielle descends the ladder, THE CAMERA GOING DOWN with her.
dialog: FOUSSARD: Bertani veut que tu is conduises en canot jusqu’au Beach
dialog: Club.
text: She turns a blank face to Robie, who waits, genially. She looks back to her father, as if to say,
text: “Are you serious?” Foussard seems to take his annoyance with Robie out ,on his daughter.
dialog: FOUSSARD: Eh bien, qu’est-ce que tu attends? T’as compris ce que je
dialog: t’ai dit? Dépéche-toi!
text: Danielle shrugs lightly, then softens and smiles at her father. Then she hugs him affection-
text: ately around the shoulders with one arm. They exchange glances that show their fondness
text: for each other. Danielle looks at Robie briefly, then turns and moves for the back of the
text: cellar, glancing over her shoulder to say:
dialog: DANIELLE: Okay. Let’s go, Mister Cat.

dialog: ROBIE: Do me a favour, Danielle. Don’t call me a cat.
text: Without turning, or stopping, she answers him:
dialog: DANIELLE: I only do one favour a day.
text: She swings open a low door at the far end of the cellar. Strong daylight floods in. We get an
text: impression of the Mediterranean beyond. By now, Robie has reached Danielle. He takes her
text: by the shoulder, and turns her around.
dialog: ROBIE: Look—if you don’t want to do this...
text: She lowers her shoulder to get it out from under his hand. She looks at him innocently.
dialog: DANIELLE: Did I brush your fur the wrong way?
scene_heading: 133. INT. BERTANI’S OFFICE-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Through the glass partition we see Lepic, followed by an anxious Bertani, entering the
text: kitchen. He moves to the center of the kitchen, and then, one by one, calls several of the
text: kitchen help toward him. Slowly, their faces impassive, they gather around Lepic. He waits
text: a moment for someone to speak. No one does. Then, quickly, and angrily, he jabs a fore-

text: He meets the exasperated Lepic emerging from the restaurant proper, followed by a suave
text: Bertani. Mercier speaks to Lepic quickly, jerking his head in the direction of the Mediter-

scene_heading: 149. INT. SPEEDBOAT-(DAY)—CLOSEUP
dialog: Robie, unperturbed:
text: ROBIE: Good. What he comes by again—wave to him.
scene_heading: 150. INT. SPEEDBOAT-(DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP
text: She remains impudent.
dialog: DANIELLE: Suppose he’s not my type?
scene_heading: 154. EXT. SPEEDBOAT-(DAY) CLOSEUP
text: He’s a little irritated with her.

text: Robie tries to peer out into the sky, as he replies:
dialog: ROBIE: Don’t buy any new clothes with the money yet. What’s he
dialog: doing now?
scene_heading: 151. INT. SPEEDBOAT-(DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP
text: She looks up, turning her head to follow the plane, and with her eyes on it, she says:

text: She turns back to him with a smile.

text: Robie’s viewpoint, SHOOTING FROM the forward compartment of the boat. Danielle is
text: seated in the foreground at the wheel, and beyond her, the airplane is swooping down once
text: more. In response to Robie’s command, she prepares to wave at the airplane and the pilot.
text: But she adds something of her own-crossing her legs, and pulling her skirt up somewhat.
text: Then she waves gaily. The plane ROARS down behind her, passing over the boat at a very
dialog: low altitude.
scene_heading: 156. INT. SPEEDBOAT-CLOSEUP-(DAY)
text: His eyes watching the plane.
dialog: ROBIE: Not that pretty! We want to get rid of them!
scene_heading: 157. INT. SPEEDBOAT—-MEDIUM SHOT-(DAY)
text: Danielle, and Robie who puts his head cautiously out of the compartment doorway.
dialog: ROBIE: How much farther to the Beach Club?
dialog: DANIELLE: Oh... maybe fifteen minutes.
text: Robie disappears from the doorway, into the forward compartment. His VOICE is HEARD.
dialog: off.
dialog: ROBIE: (Louder) Uh huh. Now when you get there, pull close in
text: shore and move around with the other boats.
dialog: DANIELLE: And then?
dialog: ROBIE: Then I’m getting out. I'll leave my clothes with you.
scene_heading: 158. INT. SPEEDBOAT-CLOSE-UP-(DAY)
text: Danielle smiles with mild surprise.
dialog: DANIELLE: And I thought you hoped to be inconspicuous.
scene_heading: 159. INT. SPEEDBOAT-SEMI-CLOSEUP-(DAY)
text: Robie comes into the doorway, and holds out a pair of bathing trunks.
dialog: ROBIE: Nobody will ever recognize me n these. Where’s the plane
dialog: now?
scene_heading: 160. INT. SPEEDBOAT-SEMI-CLOSEUP-(DAY)
text: She glances up briefly. The SOUND of the plane motor is some distance away.
text: DANIELLE: It’s going higher over the coast.
scene_heading: 161. INT. SPEEDBOAT-SEMI-CLOSEUP-(DAY)
text: Robie, standing in the doorway, starts to unbutton his shirt.
dialog: ROBIE: After I get on the beach, wait until it’s safe—then bring
dialog: my clothes in.
text: He starts to turn away from the doorway, then thinks of something that makes him turn
text: back. He speaks with mock concern.
dialog: ROBIE: Oh. Uh... sorry about that reward.
scene_heading: 162. INT. SPEEDBOAT-SEMI-CLOSEUP-(DAY)
text: She smiles at him sweetly.

scene_heading: 165. EXT. BEACH-CLOSEUP-(DAY)
text: An alert Robie is scanning the sky.
scene_heading: 166. EXT. SKY-LONG SHOT-(DAY)
text: An airplane, too high in the sky to identify, has completed a circle and is moving away out
dialog: to sea.
scene_heading: 167. EXT. BEACH-MEDIUM SHOT-(DAY)
text: Robie allows his feet to touch the bottom, and he pushes himself into an upright position.
text: The water is quite shallow. He walks casually out of the water, up the beach, the CAMERA
text: PANNING him. As he moves away, and is lost among the other habitues and bathers of the
text: Beach Club, we get a full impression of the Club and its surroundings.
scene_heading: 168. EXT. BEACH-MEDIUM SHOT-(DAY)
text: Robie finds an open spot on the beach, and reclines on the sand. He stares at the sky once
text: more. Beyond him, perhaps twenty-five feet away, a girl is half-kneeling, half-sitting under
text: a beach umbrella. Her hair is covered by a bandana, and she wears dark glasses. The most
text: startling thing about her, next to her natural physique, is her simple but elegant bathing suit.
text: She is putting sun tan oil on her shoulders. Her movements are unhurried.
scene_heading: 169. EXT. BEACH-CLOSEUP-(DAY)
text: Robie’s eyes are not turned in her direction, but are looking the other way, as though
text: anticipating the arrival of someone. Presently, two bare male legs come into the picture.
text: Robie’s eyes look up.
scene_heading: 170. EXT. BEACH-MEDIUM SHOT-(DAY)
text: From his viewpoint, SHOOTING straight up from the beach, we see a young Frenchman in
text: his early twenties. In short bathing trunks, he displays a tanned and extremely muscular
text: body. As he looks down at Robie, he says quietly:
scene_heading: CLAUDE: M’sieu—téléphone.
scene_heading: 171. EXT. BEACH-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Claude turns away as Robie rises and follows, brushing the sand from himself.
scene_heading: 172. EXT. BEACH-(DAY)-CLOSE SHOT
text: The girl in the dark glasses pauses with her bottle of oil. Slowly her head turns as she follows
text: Robie’s progress up the beach. Although we cannot see her eyes, her interest in him seems
text: more than casual.
scene_heading: 173. EXT. BEACH OFFICE-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Robie picks up a phone from the open counter. He speaks guardedly into the receiver. We
text: cannot distinguish his few words. There is some activity around him. People are getting
dialog: towels, buying candy, cigarettes, cold drinks, etc.
scene_heading: 171. INT. BERTANI’S OFFICE-(DAY)—CLOSEUP
text: Bertani sits at his desk. We get an impression of the kitchen beyond. The egg has been
text: cleaned off the glass partition. He speaks cautiously into the phone.
dialog: BERTANI: The man with the information you want will wait for you
text: at the entrance of the flower market in Nice. He will find
dialog: 23
dialog: you. I told him you would be tossing a piece of money in
dialog: the air.
scene_heading: 175. EXT. BEACH OFFICE-~(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Robie listens to Bertani on the phone. THE CAMERA MOVES IN until the head and

scene_heading: 179. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: The crowded, colorful and busy flower market in Nice. Into the foreground, a hand appears
text: holding a coin. It begins flipping the coin casually into the air.
scene_heading: 180. EXT. FLOWER MARKET . (DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Robie is looking around nonchalantly for the man he is supposed to meet. The coin flips up
text: into the bottom of the picture occasionally.
scene_heading: 181. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: A little way from one of the entrances to the flower market is a public phone booth. A man
text: steps out of it. He is Mercier, Lepic’s assistant, and he watches Robie.
scene_heading: 182. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP
text: Robie is still flipping the coin, looking around anxiously for his contact.
scene_heading: 183. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Nearby, with his back to THE CAMERA, a man is bending over a flower display, examining
text: the blossoms. He is dressed in good taste, although a little formal for the Riviera in the
text: summer—a light business suit, homburg hat, bow tie. Still bending over the flowers, he turns
text: in the direction of Robie, and reveals an alert and friendly face. He sports a small mustache.
dialog: He speaks one word:
speaker_heading: HUGHSON: Tails?
scene_heading: 184. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Robie catches the coin in mid-air, and brings it down on the back of his other hand. Slowly
text: he lifts the palm of his hand off the coin. Then he looks across and nods to Hughson with
text: a grin.
scene_heading: 185. EXT. FLOWER MARKET (DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP

dialog: Interested?
dialog: The proposition is certainly intriguing—albeit a little
dialog: unorthodox.
dialog: Does that mean yes, or no?
dialog: My dear Mr. Robie—
dialog: Smith.
dialog: I beg your pardon. Ever been married?
dialog: No. And what does that have to do with “yes or no”?
dialog: It might help you understand my problem. I have two
dialog: wives. Felicity, God bless her—and the London Home
dialog: office. I must return worthy of both of them.
dialog: Isee. And they wouldn’t approve of your giving me a list

dialog: Officially, you come under the category of “extremely

scene_heading: 157. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
dialog: 25
text: At the distant entrance to the market, we see two bobbing heads of advancing men, threading
text: their way through the crowd.
scene_heading: 188. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP
text: The CAMERA IS STILL MOVING ALONG ahead of the pair. Hughson has followed
text: Robie’s glance. Robie increases the pace of the walk. Hughson, understanding, keeps
text: up with him. The speed of their conversation increases with the speed of their walk.
dialog: HUGHSON: How much of a list do you need?
dialog: ROBIE: Only the top half-dozen names.
speaker_heading: HUGHSON Anything else?
dialog: ROBIE: The addresses, habits—whatever you’ve got. Of course,
text: descriptions of the stones and settings.
text: Robie looks over his shoulder once more.
scene_heading: 189. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: There is no doubt now that two detectives are following Robie and Hughson and are getting
text: much nearer to them.
scene_heading: 190. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP
text: Hughson also glances over his shoulder. Instinctively, the two men move even faster.
dialog: HUGHSON: Suppose it falls into the wrong hands?
dialog: ROBIE: Maybe it already has. Unless you’ve been pulling the
dialog: thefts yourself.
dialog: HUGHSON: (Chuckles) Wouldn’t that be one on the Home Office.
text: Robie glances over his shoulder once more.
scene_heading: 191. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: Robie starts to dash away, as the two detectives come into the picture a few yards away.
text: Robie calls out to Hughson.
dialog: ROBIE: Where are you staying?
dialog: HUGHSON: The Carlton —Cannes.
text: The two detectives brush past Hughson, after Robie.
scene_heading: 192. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: An elevated view of a section of the market, with its masses of flowers. We see Robie
text: hurrying away from the two detectives. He pulls up short, as two new detectives come into
text: the picture from the opposite direction. For a moment, Robie seems cornered. Then quickly,
text: he makes for a side aisle.
scene_heading: 193. EXT. FLOWER MARKET -(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: From the ground level. Robie dashing down the side aisle, suddenly collides with a man
text: carrying a huge basket of freshly cut blooms. The basket is so big that we do not see the man
text: behind it.
scene_heading: 194. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: At the moment of impact, the flowers fly into the air, and shower the screen with a cascade
text: of color. The man is knocked flat, as the flowers clear the picture. Robie turns and sees his
dialog: pursuers.
scene_heading: 195. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
dialog: 26
text: From a high angle. Two of the detectives have run around the back while the other two are
text: approaching him from the main aisle. Robie can do only one thing. He turns, and clambers
text: into the middle of a flower stall, trying to find a path of escape. He doesn’t quite make it,
text: is grabbed by two of the men, and dragged back among the flowers. By now the merchants
text: and customers of the flower market are in an uproar.
scene_heading: 196. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: The two other detectives dive in, and now the screen is filled with a turmoil—legs, arms,
text: flowers and heads.
scene_heading: 197. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Atall, elderly French lady, dressed in black, with apron, etc., who seems to be the owner of
text: the stall, is busy beating the men with a large bunch of lilies. Fortunately, the noise of the
text: onlookers prevents us from hearing her French profanity.
scene_heading: 198. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)—CLOSEUP,
text: A grim, flower-covered Robie, fighting off the detectives. He is slowly being subdued.
scene_heading: 199. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: The old lady has dropped her bunch of lilies, and is calling for someone to come to her aid.
text: Four or five husky flower vendors seem to answer her. They dash forward, and begin to tear
text: at the struggling figures among the flowers. They appear to be trying to stop the fight.
scene_heading: 200, EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Suddenly Robie finds himself without attackers. He rises, and for a moment stands alone
text: amid the debris of the flowers, as the four detectives are being assaulted. Then, quickly
text: realizing his good fortune, he takes advantage of it and continues his escape.
text: He turns toward the crowd, looking for an opening. People move back in confusion and
text: fright. THE CAMERA PANS him through the crowd, and almost to freedom. His only
text: pursuer is the old lady of the flower stalls, shrieking at the top of her lungs. She grabs him
text: with both hands. Despite her size, she seems to have a bulldog grip.
scene_heading: 201. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: The flower vendors relax their attack on the police. The police get to their feet, and hurry
text: off in pursuit of Robie. As the police dash off, the leader of the flower vendors crosses to
text: Hughson. THE CAMERA PANNING HIM, and Hughson hands him some large franc notes.
scene_heading: 202. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Robie cannot seem to shake the old lady loose without actually knocking her down. Before
text: he can free himself, the police dash in and grab him. He is quickly pinioned.
scene_heading: 203. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Hughson, who had been smiling in satisfaction, looks up to see Robie’s capture. The smile
text: dies, and he turns in dismay to see:
scene_heading: 201. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: The leader of the flower vendors, handing out Hughson’s money for freeing Robie.
scene_heading: 205. EXT. FLOWER MARKET-(DAY)-CLOSE SHOT

scene_heading: 228. EXT. ROBIE’S VILLA-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: A tight TWO SHOT of Robie and Hughson, sitting on a low stone wall outside Robie’s villa.
text: The view beyond is interesting. There is an ice bucket between them, holding a bottle of
text: champagne. Each man holdsa glass, and Hughson’s is empty. Robie takes the dripping bottle
text: out of the bucket, and proceeds to pour the remains of the champagne into Hughson’s empty
text: glass. Hughson puts out a protesting hand.
dialog: HUGHSON: Please, my dear fellow. Not in the middle of the day.
text: Robie says nothing, completes the pouring. Hughson makes a gesture of gracious defeat. As
text: Robie replaces the bottle, we hear the SOUND of a woman’s voice off:
dialog: GERMAINE: Le déjeuner est servi.
scene_heading: 229. EXT. VILLA -(DAY)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: From their viewpoint, a smiling Germaine is waiting on the terrace.
scene_heading: 230. EXT. ROBIE’S VILLA-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Robie and Hughson rise, glasses in hand.
dialog: ROBIE: (Indicating drink) Bring it to the table with you.
text: Hughson, however, swallows the drink quickly. He smiles at Robie. Then he puts the glass
text: down and follows Robie. THE CAMERA PANS them up to the terrace.
scene_heading: 231, EXT. TERRACE-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Robie and Hughson enter the terrace and sit down for lunch. THE. CAMERA MOVES IN
text: on them. Germaine has laid a simple, but attractive, table. She has moved inside the house
dialog: to get the first course.
scene_heading: 232. EXT. TERRACE-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Hughson looks about him with considerable appreciation. Robie is busy uncorking a bottle
text: of red wine. As Hughson glances around, his eye catches sight of:
scene_heading: 233. EXT. TERRACE-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Robie’s cat, which we saw earlier, is sleeping in a nearby chair.
scene_heading: 234, EXT. TERRACE-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Hughson turns back to Robie. He gestures toward the sleeping cat.
dialog: HUGHSON : Under the present circumstances, do you think it pays to
dialog: advertise?
text: Robie looks at the cat fondly.
dialog: ROBIE: He hasn’t left the Villa in years.
text: Robie has pulled the cork from the wine bottle and is now pouring for both of them.
text: THE CAMERA PULLS BACK SLIGHTLY as Germaine arrives with the first course. She
text: places the cups of jellied consommé in front of them, during this, and leaves.
dialog: ROBIE: Like the place?
dialog: 28
dialog: HUGHSON: Immensely. It’s kind of a travel-folder heaven—where a
dialog: man dreams he’ll go when he retires.
text: The two men eat and drink wordlessly for a moment.
dialog: ROBIE: Now about that list of your clients who have jewelry
dialog: worth stealing.
scene_heading: 235. EXT. TERRACE-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Hughson in the act of sipping his wine, lowers his glass, and looks away with uncertainty.
text: He turns back with a warm smile.
dialog: HUGHSON: Why don’t we enjoy our lunch, first? There’s plenty of
dialog: time.
scene_heading: 236. EXT. TERRACE-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Robie assumes a philosophical expression.
dialog: ROBIE: I don’t want to seem impatient, Hughson—but in ten days
dialog: I do have to come up with something pretty convincing
dialog: for that examining magistrate. (Smiles) That’s a nice
dialog: custom they have in France—provisional liberty based on
dialog: insufficient evidence.
text: During this Germaine enters and takes away the soup cups.
scene_heading: 237. EXT. TERRACE-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: As Germaine moves away, Robie refills their wine glasses.
dialog: HUGHSON: Bertani said you were something of a celebrity in the
dialog: Underground Army.
text: THE CAMERA PULLS BACK as he rises from the table, and moves over to the edge of the
text: terrace, looking out over the view. As he crosses, he replies:
dialog: ROBIE: Yes, I was in the Resistance.
dialog: HUGHSON: (Almost boyish eagerness) Did you—uh—kill many
dialog: people?
dialog: ROBIE: (Without hesitation) Seventy-two.
text: Hughson, who is at this moment eating part of a roll, chews on it thoughtfully, and
text: uncomfortably. Robie turns.
dialog: ROBIE: I know what would have pleased you, Mr. Hughson.
text: Hughson stops chewing.
text: ROBIE: (With a smile) Not one of them was insured.
text: Hughson smiles back at Robie’s little joke.
scene_heading: 238. EXT. TERRACE-(DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP
text: As Hughson smiles at Robie, we see that he has quite a warm feeling for him despite his
dialog: questionable background.
dialog: HUGHSON: You’re a man of obvious good taste in everything.
dialog: (Indicating villa) How did you—well, why did you...
scene_heading: 239. EXT. TERRACE-(DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP
text: Robie takes a step or two towards him.
dialog: ROBIE: Take up stealing?

speaker_heading: HUGHSON: (Off) Yes.
dialog: ROBIE: To live better—to own things I couldn’t afford—to
dialog: acquire this good taste you now enjoy.
scene_heading: 240. EXT. TERRACE,—(DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP
text: Hughson is a little taken aback.
dialog: HUGHSON: You mean you were frankly dishonest?
scene_heading: 241. EXT. TERRACE-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Robie approaches the table. At the same time, Germaine appears, carrying a Quiche Lorraine
text: and two hot plates.
dialog: ROBIE: If you can call a man who climbs the outside of a fivestory
text: building, who cuts his way through a glass skylight and
text: escapes over the rooftops with a small fortune in jewels,
dialog: dishonest—yes.
text: Germaine has laid out the hot plates, and is cutting the Quiche Lorraine. Hughson throws
text: Robie a warning glance concerning Germaine’s presence. Robie smiles, shakes his head for
dialog: Hughson not to worry about her.
dialog: HUGHSON: I thought you’d have some defense. Some tale of hardship
dialog: —your mother ran off when you were young, your father
dialog: beat you...
dialog: ROBIE: No. I was part of an American trapeze act in a circus that
dialog: travelled Europe. It folded, and I was stranded. So, I put
dialog: my agility to a more rewarding purpose.
dialog: HUGHSON: You have no other defense.
dialog: ROBIE: For what it’s worth—I only stole from people who
dialog: wouldn’t go hungry.
text: Germaine holds out the dish to Hughson, who takes his cut portion. She looks up to Robie
text: who, with a gesture, tells her to serve him. She does, and leaves the scene. Hughson lifts a
text: knife and fork, then looks up to Robie.
dialog: ROBIE: I think you'll enjoy that, Hughson. It’s a Quiche Lorraine.
text: Hughson takes a bite, and murmurs appreciatively.
text: HUGHSON: Wonderful. And the pastry—it’s as light as air.
text: ROBIE: Germaine has sensitive hands—with an extremely light
dialog: touch.
dialog: HUGHSON: I can tell.
text: ROBIE: (Casually) She shot a German general once.
text: Hughson pauses with a forkful of Quiche Lorraine.
text: ROBIE: (Continues) At eighty yards.
text: Hughson’s bead is up, his mouth open. He looks thoughtfully toward the house, and then
text: slowly returns to his meal. In a moment, he speaks, trying to get back to the main
dialog: conversation.
dialog: HUGHSON: You—you were sort of a modern Robin Hood? I mean,
dialog: you gave away most of the proceeds of your crimes?
dialog: 30
dialog: ROBIE: (Shakes his head) Kept everything myself. Let’s face it. I
dialog: was an out-and-out thief—like you.
text: During this, Robie has moved over to the table, while THE CAMERA CLOSES IN. He seats
text: himself on the last word of the speech.
scene_heading: 242. EXT. TERRACE-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Hughson is a little shocked.
speaker_heading: HUGHSON: Now look here—
scene_heading: 243. EXT. TERRACE-(DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP
text: Robie interrupts, with apparent innocence.
dialog: ROBIE: Ever shortchange the butcher, by mistake?
scene_heading: 244. EXT. TERRACE-(DAY)—SEMI CLOSEUP
text: Hughson’s shock melts somewhat.
dialog: HUGHSON: Well, if a man makes a mistake in counting—
text: Robie lumps in quickly:
dialog: ROBIE: But you didn’t take the money back? (Before Hughson can
dialog: answer) Of course not. Ever take an ashtray from a hotel?
dialog: Or a towel?
dialog: HUGHSON: Souvenirs—they expect that. But—
dialog: ROBIE: Of course they do. Are you going to deduct this lunch
dialog: from your expense account?
text: Robie smiles mischievously at this. Hughson opens his mouth to speak.
dialog: ROBIE: Of course you’re not. It would be stupid.
text: Hughson takes a good drink of the wine, and as he drinks, appears visibly relieved. As soon
text: as he puts down the glass, Robie hastens to refill it.
speaker_heading: ROBIE: Do you agree?
speaker_heading: HUGHSON: Yes.
dialog: ROBIE: (Gently, but quickly) You're a thief.
text: Hughson sits back in his chair and stares unbelievingly at Robie.
dialog: ROBIE: Only an amateur thief, of course—but it might help you
dialog: have some sympathy for us professionals.
dialog: HUGHSON: (Still a little stunned) 1 don’t think I understand fully—
dialog: ROBIE: Look at it this way. You’re sorry you shortchanged the

dialog: HUGHSON: Right now, yes.
dialog: ROBIE: And someday you'll be sorry for not deducting this lunch
dialog: from your expense account.
dialog: HUGHSON: I can’t possibly deduct every little item from my expense
dialog: account. I frankly couldn’t spare the time.
dialog: ROBIE: Someday you'll wish you had. I’m sorry for ever starting
dialog: in crime—I look back with horror on every job I pulled
dialog: —TI have since paid out more in regret than I ever took in
dialog: precious stones—but that doesn’t help, because I’ll never

dialog: stop paying for it. The world won’t let me. Every time an

dialog: ROBIE: Something bothering you?
dialog: HUGHSON: (After pause) I told the police what you were going to do.
dialog: ROBIE: I didn’t expect them to like the arrangement.
dialog: HUGHSON: You were wrong. They thought it a splendid idea.
text: Robie is briefly thoughtful.
dialog: HUGHSON: They, of course, hope you'll make a mistake—and
dialog: provide them with the evidence they need against you.
dialog: ROBIE: It had to be something like that.
text: He holds out his hand.
dialog: HUGHSON: Suppose the whole thing goes wrong?
dialog: ROBIE: Come on, Hughson, we’re wasting time.
text: Hughson reaches for his pocket slowly. He takes out some folded papers, passes them to
text: Robie. Robie takes them eagerly, opens them, scans the names and information. Hughson
text: watches him apprehensively. Robie mumbles and nods appreciatively at what he reads.
dialog: ROBIE: Quite a thorough job. (He looks up) Have some wine,
dialog: Hughson.
text: Hughson automatically reaches for a wine glass, starts to sip some wine.
dialog: ROBIE: Wish I’d known somebody in the insurance racket when
dialog: I first started in the burglary business.
text: Hughson blanches, nervously puts down the wine.
dialog: HUGHSON: Tell me how you plan to operate?
dialog: ROBIE: Well, The Cat has operated every place but Cannes. He’s
dialog: due there. (Consults the list) I think my first bait will be
dialog: this Mrs. Stevens—the American woman with the dia-
dialog: monds, and the daughter. (Looks up) Know them?
dialog: HUGHSON: I’m having dinner with them tomorrow. Would you like
dialog: an introduction?
dialog: ROBIE: Hughson-in this business you can’t do things the honest
dialog: way. Remember that. (Looks at Hughson’s plate) Mr.

dialog: ROBIE: Would it be bad manners to ask who tipped off the police
dialog: in the flower market?
dialog: DANIELLE: They would never say anything to the flics. You know
dialog: that.
dialog: ROBIE: Somebody did.
dialog: DANIELLE: But still they would be very happy, if you were caught

dialog: want me dead, the Cat wants me out of town—
dialog: DANIELLE: How do you mean—The Cat wants you out of town?
dialog: ROBIE: He sent me a note this morning. It seems things are about
dialog: to get rough around here.
dialog: DANIELLE: Then don’t you think it’s foolish to remain here—without
dialog: knowing what will happen to you? But if you were in
dialog: South America, with me, you would know exactly what
dialog: will happen.
dialog: ROBIE: You make it sound dangerous either way?
dialog: DANIELLE: (Smiles) It would be so much nicer to be killed by love.

text: THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to include her, as Robie looks up with irritation, and replies:
dialog: ROBIE: Danielle—you’re just a girl. She’s a woman.
dialog: DANIELLE: (Shrugs) Why do you want to buy an old car? If you can
dialog: get a new one cheaper? It will run better, and last longer.
text: He looks at Danielle with some amazement. Then he turns, scans the beach again. He is
dialog: puzzled.

dialog: ROBIE: I only met her a couple of minutes ago.
dialog: DANIELLE: That’s right—only a few minutes ago.
dialog: FRANCIE: And you talked like two old friends. But that’s warm,
dialog: friendly France for you.
dialog: ROBIE: I was—I was asking her about renting some water skis.
dialog: Would you like me to teach you water skiing?

dialog: —last season.
dialog: ROBIE: Oh, I see. Well, it was an idea.

dialog: FRANCIE: Are you sure you were asking about water skis? From
dialog: where I sat it looked as if you two were conjugating some

text: She looks from one to the other. Danielle’s face is not friendly, but she doesn’t speak.
dialog: ROBIE: Say something nice to her, Danielle.
text: DANIELLE: (Flatly) She looks a lot older up close.
text: Robie can’t help laughing, but Francie loses some of her humor.
dialog: FRANCIE: To a mere child, anyone over twenty might seem old.
dialog: DANIELLE: A child? Shall we stand in shallower water, and discuss
dialog: that?
text: Robie is enjoying the conversation immensely, perhaps too much.
dialog: FRANCIE: Enjoying yourself, Mr. Burns?
dialog: ROBIE: Well, uh it is pleasant out here—the sun and all.
dialog: FRANCIE: Well, its too much for me. Ill see you back at the hotel.
dialog: ROBIE: I'll go with you.
dialog: DANIELLE: But, Mr. Burns you didn’t finish telling me how French

text: Francis is gone in a quick dive. She swims quickly away toward shore. Robie turns to watch

text: Robie helps Francie out of the car. They start to walk toward the villa.
scene_heading: 383. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP
text: As they approach THE CAMERA, which moves back with them, we get a vague impression
text: of the watching detectives outside the gate.
dialog: FRANCIE: You don’t like women who have brains and know what
dialog: they want, do you?
dialog: ROBIE: On the contrary. What thinking man likes the beautiful-
dialog: but-dumb type?
dialog: FRANCIE: Only about four-fifths of the population. They like a
dialog: woman beautiful enough to make them feel like Casa-
dialog: novas, but dumb enough not to know when they are—
dialog: ROBIE: (Interrupts) Being taken advantage of?
dialog: FRANCIE: That’s the long version.
scene_heading: 384. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: The CAMERA MOVES at the same tempo of their walk toward the villa.
scene_heading: 385. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP
text: The two continue walking leisurely.
dialog: ROBIE: You’re absolutely right. Give me a woman who knows her
dialog: own mind every time.
dialog: FRANCIE: No one gives you that kind of a woman. You have to
dialog: capture her.
dialog: ROBIE: Any particular method?
text: The CAMERA PANS them away toward the villa. They approach the steps leading to the
text: front door.
dialog: FRANCIE: Yes. But it’s no good unless you discover it yourself.
dialog: 52
scene_heading: 386. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(DAY)-SEMI CLOSE-UP
text: Francis surveys the front of the villa.
dialog: FRANCIE: Are you sure you have the right address?
text: Robie half pulls the list out of his pocket.
text: ROBIE: It is a little large, but it’s on the real estate agent’s list.
text: She turns, reaches quickly for the list.
speaker_heading: FRANCIE: Let me see.
text: Hastily he pushes the list back into his pocket.
dialog: ROBIE: Let’s look at the gardens first. No need to bother the
dialog: people.
text: They start to move around the house. The CAMERA PANNING with them.
dialog: ROBIE: With all your money, you should own a place like this.
dialog: FRANCIE: Palaces are for royalty. We’re just common people with a
dialog: bank account.
dialog: ROBIE: That sounds more like your mother than you.
dialog: FRANCIE: There isn’t much difference between us but a few years
dialog: and some grammar.
text: They are now walking along the front of the house.
text: 387 and 388 OMITTED.
scene_heading: 389. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(DAY)—CLOSEUP
text: A big head of Robie. As he talks, his eyes turn upward surreptitiously toward the roofline.
scene_heading: 390. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(DAY)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: THE CAMERA PANS down the slope of the roof, and over the edge to the top windows.
text: It moves along the windows. Robie’s voice is heard over:
dialog: ROBIE: And jewelry. You never wear any.
dialog: FRANCIE: I don’t like cold things touching my skin.
dialog: ROBIE: With your money you could probably invent some hot
dialog: diamonds.
dialog: FRANCIE: I'd rather spend it on more tangible excitement.
dialog: ROBIE: What do you get a thrill out of most?
dialog: FRANCIE: (After a pause) I’m still looking for that one.
scene_heading: 391. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(DAY)—CLOSEUP
text: Robie’s eyes lower from scanning the building, and he is startled to discover that:
scene_heading: 392. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(DAY)—CLOSEUP
text: Francis is staring at him casually.
dialog: FRANCIE: I thought we were going to look at the gardens.
scene_heading: 393. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
dialog: The two.
dialog: ROBIE: I couldn’t help being intrigued by the architecture.
dialog: Turn-of-the-century Mediterranean, I would say—with a
dialog: touch of too much money.
dialog: 53
scene_heading: 3914. EXT. GRANDE CORNICHE ROAD-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Outside the gate, on the other side of the road, one of the two detectives is watching.
scene_heading: 395. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: From the detective’s viewpoint, we see Robie and Francis walking around to the side of the
text: house. Robie is looking up, his head tilted towards the roof.
scene_heading: 396. EXT. GRANDE CORNICHE ROAD-~(DAY)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: The detective hurries back to his waiting car. He opens the door, leans in.
scene_heading: 397. INT. POLICE CAR-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: The detective leans into the car, picks up the radio-telephone. He starts to call in. He speaks
dialog: French.
scene_heading: 398. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: Another beautiful view of the garden. Robie and Francis strolling among the flowerbeds in
dialog: the distance.
scene_heading: 399, EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(DAY)—-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Robie and Francie now seem to have become preoccupied in their conversation, and are
text: barely looking at the garden.
dialog: FRANCIE: You never mention your wife.
dialog: ROBIE: Never found the time to get married.
dialog: FRANCIE: You don’t appear to be pushed for time now.
text: He looks at her, but doesn’t answer.
dialog: FRANCIE: Or did you Just come over to add interesting items to
dialog: your diary? Like the name and description of that French
dialog: girl you swam out to meet.
text: They have now turned, and are approaching towards the CAMERA, bringing themselves into
dialog: closer shot.
dialog: ROBIE: (Smiles) You are husband-hunting, after all.
dialog: FRANCIE: That wasn’t jealousy you heard working—but only disap-
dialog: pointment in your limited imagination. Teen-aged French
dialog: girls yet.
text: Robie tries to look properly uncomfortable, as they come in to a close TWO SHOT.
dialog: FRANCIE: I'll bet you snowed her under. The big, handsome rich
dialog: lumberman from America. I'll bet you even told her all
dialog: your trees were Sequoias.
text: ROBIE: That certainly sounds like jealousy to me. (Looks at her)
dialog: Well, don’t be ashamed of it. Let it out.
text: They both glance up casually at something in the distance.
scene_heading: 400. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: In the far distance, we see the tiny figure of a man emerging from a side door of the villa. He
text: comes towards THE CAMERA. He is so far away we cannot see who he is.
scene_heading: 401. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Robie and Francis, after a casual glance, resume their discussion.
dialog: FRANCIE: You’re somewhat egotistical.
speaker_heading: 54
dialog: ROBIE: Anybody near you would almost have to be.
dialog: FRANCIE: (Enjoys this) There’s hope for you yet.
speaker_heading: ROBIE: Miss Stevens—
dialog: FRANCIE: Yes, Mr. Burns—?
text: Robie glances toward the oncoming figure again.
scene_heading: 402. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(DAY)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: The figure becomes clear as it approaches. It is a heavy-built man.
scene_heading: 403. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: The attention of the pair lingers a little longer on the approaching figure. Then Robie turns
text: back and resumes the conversation.
dialog: ROBIE: Know what I think?
speaker_heading: FRANCIE: About what?
speaker_heading: ROBIE: You.
dialog: FRANCIE: I don’t really care.
text: Despite himself, Robie has to glance back to the figure again. She follows his glance.
scene_heading: 404. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(DAY)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: The figure of the man has now become much nearer. It is nearly possible to identify him, if
text: it were not for the fact that the brim of his hat shades his eyes.
scene_heading: 405. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Francie and Robie. Robie cautiously begins to express a slight uneasiness. Francis’s glance
text: at the man, however, remains casual.
dialog: ROBIE: You care more than I do what you think about me. Right,
dialog: or wrong?
dialog: FRANCIE: You tell me.
dialog: ROBIE: I will. You’re an insecure, over-pampered woman who
dialog: thinks men only like her for her money—and is probably
dialog: right.
text: Robie is now staring at the oncoming figure. He has not recognized him.
scene_heading: 406. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: It is Bertani-the restaurant proprietor, who approaches them. He is glancing at them quite
text: casually, without recognition.
scene_heading: 407. EXT. SANFORD VILLA (DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP
text: Robie is staring at the approaching Bertani apprehensively. Francie brings him back to the
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: FRANCIE: Anything more?
dialog: ROBIE: What you need is something I have neither the time, nor
dialog: the inclination to give you.
text: He stares back at Bertani.
scene_heading: 408. EXT. SANFORD VILLA~(DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP
text: As Bertani approaches the CAMERA he gives not the slightest sign of recognition. As THE
text: CAMERA PANS OVER, Bertani’s head and shoulders fill the screen as he passes out of the
dialog: picture.
dialog: 55
scene_heading: 409. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(DAY)-—CLOSEUP
text: Robie, half-turning from the departing Bertani stares ahead with a thoughtful look. Over this
dialog: we hear Francis’s voice:
dialog: FRANCIE: And just what is that?
text: He turns completely to her.
text: ROBIE: Two weeks, with a good man, at Niagra Falls.
scene_heading: LAP DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 410. EXT. SANFORD VILLA GATE-(DAY)-SEMI LONG SHOT
text: A little way up the road, away from the entrance gate, we see the waiting police car. The two
text: detectives are in the middle of the road, and in some apparent scheme to hide their real
text: identity, are playing a game of soccer, using a medium-sized stone as a ball. Then, over this,
text: we hear the sound of a car. The men look up, and suddenly, into the foreground, moving
text: across the picture, as it emerges from the gates, is the convertible carrying Francie and Robie.
text: It sweeps out of the picture, to the right.
text: The two men stop their game, and hurry to the waiting black sedan. The; jump in, and we
text: hear the starter grind. The engine starts up, and the car moves away at an easy pace.
scene_heading: 411. INT. CONVERTIBLE —(DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP
text: Robie looks at Francie, who is driving.
dialog: ROBIE: I’m hungry. Let’s open up that picnic basket.
dialog: FRANCIE: Not until we get to the picnic grounds—
dialog: ROBIE: Which you’ve already picked out.
dialog: FRANCIE: Which I’ve already picked out.
text: He looks forward again, his eyes straying toward the side-view mirror.
dialog: ROBIE: Is it far?
speaker_heading: FRANCIE: A few miles.
text: ROBIE: (Looking toward mirror) Uh-huh. Lonely and secluded?
speaker_heading: FRANCIE: Naturally.
speaker_heading: 412. INSERT
text: The side-view mirror on the right of the car. In it we can see the black sedan of the police

scene_heading: 413. INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP
text: Robie turns from the mirror to Francie.
dialog: ROBIE: Well, what are we dawdling along like this for?
text: Francie gives him a real sexy look.
dialog: FRANCIE: That’s exactly what was running through my mind.
text: She steps on the gas. The car seems to jump forward.
scene_heading: 414. INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: Shooting through the windshield, we see the hood and the road ahead. The car begins to

scene_heading: 415. INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP
text: Robie half glances over his shoulder with a look of smug satisfaction.
scene_heading: 416. , INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
dialog: 56
text: Shooting over the back of the car we see the fast-retreating road. Now and again we get a
text: glimpse of the police car following. It has also increased its speed.
scene_heading: 417. INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY) SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: The two. Robie turns back and glances at Francie. She’s calm, but intent on her speed.
scene_heading: 418. INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: Shooting through the windshield. She takes the next corner a little too near the center of the
text: road. Another car suddenly appears coming around the corner toward them.
scene_heading: 419. INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Completely confident, Francie swings the wheel over.
scene_heading: 420. INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: Shooting through the windshield again. The other car swings over, as Francie’s car swings
text: out toward the side of the road with a screech of the tires.
scene_heading: INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Robie’s expression sobers for a moment, but he manages to remain completely deadpan.
scene_heading: 422. INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: Shooting over the back of the car, we see the car that has lust passed getting back into the
text: center of the road, and then proceeding on out of sight. We hear another screech of tires.
scene_heading: 423. INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY) SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Robie, hearing the screech, smiles to himself. He turns back and looks ahead.
scene_heading: INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-LONG SHOT

scene_heading: 425. INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-CLOSEUP

scene_heading: 1429. INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-LONG SHOT

scene_heading: 430. INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-CLOSEUP
text: Robie. He looks down toward the front of the car.
scene_heading: 431. EXT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)—CLOSEUP
text: The screeching front wheel of the car in the foreground turning at terrific speed. We see the

scene_heading: 432. INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-CLOSEUP
text: Robie holding his breath.
scene_heading: 433. EXT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)—CLOSEUP
dialog: 57

scene_heading: 434, INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Robie and Francie. Francie glances at him with a slight smile as though to ask “Enjoying the
text: ride?” Robie forces a faint smile in response.
scene_heading: INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: Through the windshield. Around the next bend, the road suddenly turns into a village. Less
text: than a hundred yards away, an old lady is crossing the roadway. She carries a very heavy
text: bundle, and moves slowly. THE CAMERA bears down on her, but apparently she is deaf,
text: for she does not look around.
scene_heading: 436. INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: A profile shot of Francie and Robie. Robie leans forward in alarm. Francie, however, is in

scene_heading: 440. INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-SEMI-LONG SHOT

scene_heading: 441. INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-CLOSEUP Robie. half glances over his shoulder.
scene_heading: 442. INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: The car moves on again and gathers speed. We see the old lady completing her crossing, and
text: the police car turning into the village in the distance. The old lady has dropped something
text: and decides to return to pick it up. The police car comes to a screeching stop in front of her.
scene_heading: 443. INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Francie is now putting on an extra burst of speed as they go through the village. Robie
text: wonders whether to suggest that they might be going a little too fast. He restrains himself.

scene_heading: 447 EXT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT

text: The two detectives in their car rhythmically swaying in unison as the car takes the bends in

text: Profile shot of Francie and Robie. The wind in their faces, getting wilder.
scene_heading: 450. INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY) SEMI LONG SHOT
text: Through the windshield the road is starting to curve ahead. Suddenly a chicken is seen to

text: reaches the side of the road in time as the car whizzes by.
scene_heading: INT. CONVERTIBLE-(DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP
text: The speed is getting so great that Robie has now made up his mind to say something. But
text: first, he glances over his shoulder.
scene_heading: INT. CONVERTIBLE (DAY)-SEMI LONG SHOT
text: Seen over the back of the car. The retreating road behind them. There is no sign of the police
dialog: car.
scene_heading: 453 EXT. GRANDE CORNICES-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: The police car has come to grief. It is perched precariously astride the low wall above the
text: sheer drop below. One slight tip and the car would be crashing down thousands of feet. The
text: door of the car is open, and both detectives are safe and sound. One of that has the radio
text: telephone to his ear. By his pitiful gestures he is explaining to headquarters something of
text: their problem. Across the road, a chicken stands watching them.
scene_heading: 454 INT. CONVERTIBLE -.(DAY)-SEMI CLOSEUP
text: Robie, now looking anxiously ahead, speaks to Francie. Both he and Francie have to shout

dialog: ROBIE: Slow down!
dialog: FRANCIE: And let them catch us?
text: He looks sharply toward her.
dialog: ROBIE: Let who catch us?

dialog: 59
text: Francie stretches her arms up and out into the air. Then she takes a comb out of her purse,
text: and begins arranging her hair. She talks as she does this.
dialog: FRANCIE: My, it’s a lovely day. (Takes a deep breath) Did you ever
dialog: see any place in the world more beautiful than this? Look
dialog: at the colors of the sea off there, and the sky, and those

dialog: down there you could climb over.
dialog: ROBIE: Who did you call me?
dialog: FRANCIE: Robie. John Robie. One of the world’s cleverest jewel
dialog: thieves—known as The Cat. I’ve read all about you, in the

speaker_heading: ROBIE: Iam.

dialog: FRANCIE: I hope you try to bluff me, Mr. Robie. Then I can have
dialog: the fun of telling you how clever I was.
scene_heading: 459 EXT. LA TURBIE-(DAY)—CLOSEUP
text: Through the rear view mirror, we see Robie opening the trunk in back. He pauses in doing
dialog: so, as he replies:
dialog: ROBIE: Since I am not Mr. Robie, but W. Burns, Miss
dialog: Stevens—there would hardly be any point in bluffing you.
dialog: Nevertheless, tell me how clever you were.
text: Robie takes out the picnic basket, and closes the trunk.
scene_heading: 460. EXT. LA TURBIE-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Francie turns, with delight, and leans over the back of the seat to face him.
dialog: FRANCIE: Well, the first thing I noticed about you, was—
text: Her eyes follow Robie as he is moving from the trunk to the front seat of the car. His
dialog: VOICE is HEARD off:
dialog: ROBIE: (Interrupting) Don’t sound so pleased with yourself.
dialog: FRANCIE: I never caught a jewel thief before. It’s stimulating. It’s
dialog: like, like—
text: The CAMERA FULLS BACK as Robie comes into the picture and puts the basket on the
text: front seat.
dialog: ROBIE: Like sitting in a hot tub?
text: She laughs. There is something about her manner that seems flushed and exaggerated.
dialog: FRANCIE: Here, let me serve.
dialog: 60
text: Robie seats himself on the floor of the car, with his feet on the ground. His back is to her.
text: She opens the picnic basket. Takes out two bottles of beer and an opener, which she hands

dialog: You make the choice.

text: nonchalant. Francie reaches into the basket, and hands him a chicken leg. She takes a piece
text: of breast meat for herself. He has opened the beer bottles by now, hands one to her.
text: Each of them takes a bite of the chicken. She reaches in the basket for some salt, and salts

scene_heading: 504. INT. BERTANI’S KITCHEN-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Three detectives move into the kitchen at Bertani’s restaurant. They take La Mule and two
text: other chefs by the arms, preparatory to leading them out.
dialog: LA MULE: Moi? Quest-ce que vous voulez que je sache! Vous vous
dialog: imaginez que je passerais toute la sainte journée dans l’eau
dialog: de vaisselle si j'avais volé pour plusieurs millions de
dialog: bijoux?
text: The other two men are similarly protesting, but the detectives are overcoming their vocal
text: and physical resistance. Bertani hurries into the kitchen.
dialog: BERTANI: Montrez voir vos mandats d’amener.
dialog: DETECTIVE: Les voici, Mr. Bertani!
dialog: 73
text: He puts the paper, down on a bench, and the three men are hustled out of the kitchen as
text: Bertani and the others watch with startled and frightened looks.
scene_heading: 505. EXT. THE BEACH CLUB-(DAY) MEDIUM SHOT
text: Two detectives are questioning Danielle at a distance. She is protesting that she knows
text: nothing about Robie and his activities. She seems almost in tears. Claude steps in between
text: her and the police belligerently, but they turn on him with questions that make him lose his
text: bravery. Claude and Danielle are in bathing suits. Other people on the beach are watching
text: the episode. Although we cannot clearly distinguish the voices, it is evident that the
dialog: detectives mean business.
scene_heading: 506. INT. ROBIE’S VILLA -(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Two detectives move through the doorway of Robie’s villa. Germaine tries to block their

dialog: GERMAINE: Vous n’avez pas le droit d’entrer ici! Attendez un peu que
dialog: Monsieur Robie apprenne ca! (She looks at warrant in her
dialog: hand) Qutest-ce que vous voulez que j’en fasse de votre
dialog: papier —je ne sais pas lire!
text: One of the detectives immediately begins searching the room; the other moves toward a

scene_heading: 508. EXT. CANNES HARBOR-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: A lone figure sits out on the end of a pier extending into the gentle blue waters of the.
text: Cannes Harbor. The figure sits next to a tall brick tower, possibly a lighthouse.
scene_heading: 508A. EXT. CANNES HARBOR.~(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Shooting back toward the shore. The fisherman is John Robie. Another person stands in
text: front of the brick tower behind Robie. H. H. Hughson. He takes off his hat, and mops his
text: forehead with a handkerchief. Robie looks forward without turning around.
dialog: ROBIE: Do you believe I did the Stevens job?
dialog: HUGHSON: Until you sent for me. If you had done it, you would
dialog: hardly risk my bringing the police with me.
speaker_heading: ROBIE: Thank you.
dialog: HUGHSON: As you’ve been safely in hiding for several days... why did
dialog: you come out in the open?
dialog: ROBIE: I need your help.
dialog: HUGHSON: Perhaps I need your help even more. You see my
dialog: superiors at the London Office—
text: Robie lifts a hand to stop his conversation.
dialog: ROBIE: This time I might solve some of your problems. Possibly
dialog: all of them.
dialog: HUGHSON: That’s too much to hope for.
dialog: 74
dialog: ROBIE: For three nights I’ve been watching one of the villas on
dialog: your list.
text: Hughson’s interest picks up.
speaker_heading: HUGHSON: Which one?
dialog: ROBIE: The Silvas—that South American couple. (Significantly)
dialog: Somebody else is watching it too. I’ve seen him in the
text: dark—but haven’t managed to get close enough to catch
dialog: him.
dialog: HUGHSON: Has he seen you?
dialog: ROBIE: Probably. I want to set a foolproof trap tonight—and I
dialog: need the assistance of the police. Naturally, I can’t
dialog: approach them.
text: Hughson thinks a moment, then looks back to Robie.
dialog: HUGHSON: How do you know he'll be there tonight?
text: Robie takes out a folded piece of paper, hands it to Hughson, interrupting his speech.
dialog: ROBIE: Somebody gave this to Germaine, my housekeeper.
text: Hughson takes the paper unfolds it, and reads:
speaker_heading: 509. INSERT
scene_heading: The note: ROBIE-N’ALLEZ PAS ALA VILLA DES SILVA CE SOIR... CEST AMOI TOUR
scene_heading: DE FAIRE LE CHAT—PAS A VOUS.
scene_heading: 510. EXT. CANNES HARBOR-(DAY)—MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
text: Hughson looks up. The note definitely interests him.
dialog: HUGHSON: What does it say?
dialog: ROBIE: “Robie-stay away from the Silvas Villa. It’s my night to
dialog: howl, not yours.”
dialog: HUGHSON: Who gave it to Germaine?
text: ROBIE: It was left in her shopping basket.
text: Robie quickly follows up the advantage of Hughson’s interest.
dialog: ROBIE: Look, Hughson—get back to town. Tell Lepic to have the
dialog: police surround the Villa Pampas sometime after mid-
dialog: night.
dialog: HUGHSON: You're actually going there?
speaker_heading: ROBIE: Of course.
text: HUGHSON: But Robie—this note is obviously the bait for a trap.
dialog: Someone wants you to go to the Silvas tonight.
dialog: ROBIE: I know it.
dialog: HUGHSON: Possibly to kill you.
dialog: ROBIE: (After a slight pause) Will you talk to Lepic?
dialog: HUGHSON: (Disturbed) All right, but if this—this—Cat doesn’t show
dialog: up—the police might get you—and the whole. thing will
dialog: turn out badly. Maybe I'd better go along tonight as your
dialog: alibi.

scene_heading: 514. EXT. SEA VILLA-(NIGHT)-LONG SHOT
text: A large villa, surrounded by dark cypress trees, on a promontory jutting out into the sea. A
text: high stone wall, with wide steps, rises up from the rocks at the water’s edge.
scene_heading: 515. EXT. SEA VILLA-(NIGHT)-LONG SHOT
text: A closer view shows us the steps rising up toward the front of the house. Except for a slight
text: breeze stirring the cypress trees, there is absolutely no sound or movement about the villa.
text: A light is seen behind the shades of a second floor right room. It goes out.
scene_heading: 516. EXT. SEA VILLA-(NIGHT)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: The side of the villa, and the dark shrubbery beyond. There is the slightest movement in the
text: foliage, possibly caused by the breeze.
scene_heading: 517. EXT. SEA VILLA-(NIGHT)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: A dark cypress tree fills-part of the screen in the foreground. Beyond it, a parkway, and
text: shadows of trees across it. The shadows seem to move. In the distance we can almost seem
text: to hear the slip and grind of gravel, as though someone was stepping cautiously over it.
scene_heading: 518. EXT. SEA VILLA-(NIGHT)—MEDIUM SHOT
text: The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS along the edge of the roof, following the line of the rain
text: trough. It follows a rain pipe down to the ground as though awaiting the arrival of someone.
text: There is no sound.
scene_heading: 519. EXT. SEA VILLA-(NIGHT) SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: Across a stretch of lawn there is a series of short trees, any one of which could be mistaken
text: for the figure of a man. One or two of them move slightly in the breeze.
scene_heading: 520. EXT. SEA VILLA-(NIGHT)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: Shooting down the stone steps which lead to the water, we see the waves swirling around the
text: rocks below.
text: THE CAMERA holds on this for a while, because there seems to be someone moving on the
dialog: rocks below-although we cannot be sure.
scene_heading: 521. EXT. SEA VILLA-(NIGHT)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: Shooting along the top of the sea wall, showing the over-hanging trees. They shudder
text: successively down the wall, as though someone was passing behind them, brushing them with
text: his body.
scene_heading: 522. EXT. SEA VILLA-(NIGHT)—MEDIUM SHOT
text: Another part of the garden, near the sea wall. The shrubbery is completely still, the breeze
text: having died away. The CAMERA STAYS ON THIS for a second or two. Then suddenly, a
text: muffled, strangled shout shatters the silence. The wind seems to spring up again. THE
text: CAMERA WHIPS around. Two big heads fill the screen. In the front is Robie, an arm
text: clutched around his neck. A dark-face slightly behind him. It is Foussard, Bertani’s wine
text: steward. The two men begin to twist and struggle.
scene_heading: 523. EXT. SEA VILLA-(NIGHT)—CLOSEUP
dialog: 76
text: A man’s arm is seen, as we SHOOT UP toward the moonlit sky. The hand grips a long
text: blackjack. It descends successively and heavily down on one of the struggling men. Suddenly
text: the blackjack remains poised in mid-air, because the assailant has heard shouts, police
text: whistles, the screech of tires, doors slamming, etc. from a distance.
text: The blackjack and arm disappear from the picture.
scene_heading: 524, EXT. SEA VILLA-(NIGHT)-CLOSEUP
text: We now see the position of Robie and his attacker. In the struggle, Robie has turned their
text: positions so that the other man’s head is back to the CAMERA, and has obviously received
text: all the blows. The man’s grip on Robie has relaxed, as Robie twists free. The man’s body
text: spins, and is lost to sight as it tumbles over the rail of the sea wall.
scene_heading: 525. EXT. SEA VILLA (NIGHT)-LONG SHOT
text: We see the body of Robie’s attacker falling to the rocks below. Robie stops for a moment
text: until the body hits the rocks. We see his silhouetted figure dash into the shrubbery. The
text: sound of the police has increased.
scene_heading: 526. EXT. SEA VILLA-(NIGHT) SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: Shooting up the long flight of stone steps toward the house, we see the silhouettes of half a
text: dozen police hurrying down. They are carrying flashlights.
scene_heading: 527. EXT. SEA VILLA-(NIGHT)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: The police dashing down the stone steps to the rocks. They turn and quickly climb over the
text: wet rocks to the body.
scene_heading: 528. EXT. SEA VILLA-(NIGHT)-CLOSEUP

scene_heading: 529. EXT. STREET CORNER-(DAY)—CLOSEUP
text: The blazing headline of a French newspaper, Le Nice-Matin. It reads in large black letters,
text: with an exclamation mark: “LE CHAT EST MORT”. Coins are being tossed into a cigar
text: box, and many hands are pulling papers off the pile.
scene_heading: 530. EXT. STREET CORNER-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Ten or fifteen people are standing around the news stand, reading the front page of the
text: paper. Some slowly walk past THE CAMERA. On the fringe of the crowd,, coming toward
text: THE CAMERA, are Francie and her mother. As they come into semi-closeup, they slow up,
text: both of them look at the scene with interest.
text: MRS. STEVENS: Almost everybody in Philadelphia reads the Inquirer.
dialog: FRANCIE: Just a minute, mother.
text: She moves toward the news stand, and buys a paper. Once she looks at the headline, she
text: holds the paper in front of her, and like the others walks slowly along the sidewalk, in her
text: case toward her mother. Mrs. Steven’s curiosity is aroused, increased by the fact that she
dialog: cannot read French.
text: MRS. STEVENS: What is it? What’s the excitement?
text: Francie looks up.
text: FRANCIE: The Cat burglar is dead.
dialog: 77
scene_heading: MRS. STEVENS: (Alarmed) John Robie?
text: Francis refers again to the paper.
text: FRANCIE: A man named Foussard—a wine steward from a res-

scene_heading: 531. EXT. STREET CORNER-(DAY)—CLOSEUP

scene_heading: 532. INT. LEPIC’S OFFICE.-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: In a small office, Lepic is seated at his desk, while Hughson stands at the side. The latest
text: edition of the newspaper lies in front of Lepic, possibly with his picture included with the
text: story. Hughson holds a check in his hand.
dialog: HUGHSON: You're positive Foussard was the Cat?
dialog: LEPIC: I do not have any reason to change the story that I have
dialog: given to the newspaper.
dialog: HUGHSON: That’s hardly a direct answer, Commissioner.
dialog: LEPIC: (Displaying some impatience) I cannot give you another.
dialog: Now if you excuse me—
text: HUGHSON: (Interrupts) One more point, Monsieur Lepic. (Holds up
dialog: check) This is a check for eighty thousand dollars. That’s
dialog: nearly twenty-eight million francs. Since you have caught,
dialog: and unfortunately killed, The Cat—
dialog: LEPIC: In our opinion, he killed himself attempting to escape
dialog: justice.
dialog: HUGHSON: Either way. I’ve been instructed by my company to pay
dialog: off the Stevens claim. I’m disinclined to do this, if
dialog: recovery of the jewelry is imminent. Is it?
dialog: LEPIC: (After an uncomfortable pause) It will take time.
text: Robie’s voice is heard off:
dialog: ROBIE: Several centuries.
text: The men turn, look toward the doorway.
scene_heading: 533. INT. LEPIC’S OFFICE-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Once again well-dressed, and with a look of slight amusement on his face, Robie leans up
text: against the open doorway.
dialog: ROBIE: Congratulations on your capture, Commissionaire.
text: He enters the room, THE CAMERA PANNING him over to the desk.
dialog: ROBIE: All’s well that ends well.
text: He sits down in a nearby chair as the two men watch him.
text: ROBIE: The newspapers have their headlines.
dialog: The rich tourists can relax. You, Lepic, have your publicity and possibly a
dialog: 78
dialog: commendation from the Paris office. We all got something good out of it, except of course
dialog: Hughson’s company. But they can afford it, eh, Hughson!
dialog: HUGHSON: Well it has cut into their assets.
dialog: ROBIE: Poor Foussard. Never guessed it was him. Ordinary wine
dialog: waiter. Family man. Wooden leg
text: Hughson’s face shows a sudden startled look. He puts the check back into his pocket. Robie
text: catches his look.
dialog: ROBIE: Oh, didn’t you know? Lost it in the War. Isn’t it remark-
text: able? A man with a wooden leg teaching himself to climb
text: up walls and over roofs with the agility of a four-footed
dialog: cat?
text: Hughson quickly looks at Lepic.
speaker_heading: HUGHSON: Is that true?
dialog: LEPIC: I believe he had a—bad leg.
text: Robie gets up from the chair.
dialog: ROBIE: And it was certainly in good taste of you to keep it out of
dialog: the newspapers.
text: He walks to the door, THE CAMERA PANNING HIM.
dialog: ROBIE: Well, I think it’s only fitting to drop into Foussard’s
text: funeral and pay my last respects. (He turns, pauses, turns
dialog: back) Oh, and at the same time, to get a good look at the
text: real Cat—who will certainly be there, purring.
scene_heading: 534. INT. LEPIC’S OFFICE-(DAY)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: The full office. Hughson visibly startled by this last statement, takes a step forward.
dialog: HUGHSON: You know who the Cat is?
dialog: ROBIE: In a phrase—I do.
text: Lepic tenses, moves forward and upward a little in his chair, looking intently at Robie.
dialog: HUGHSON: Well—well, tell the commissioner who it is.
dialog: ROBIE: (Smiling) He wouldn’t believe me.
dialog: HUGHSON: Then try me.
dialog: ROBIE: You'd find it hard to believe. When I catch the Cat on a
text: rooftop, with a handful of stolen diamonds, then—
text: Lepic jumps to his feet, his face scarlet.
dialog: LEPIC: (Interrupting) Monsieur Robie! It is only because I have
dialog: given this story to the newspapers that you are in free-
dialog: dom! But the day where I catch you on the top of a roof,
dialog: with or without jewels, I shall be more than happy to call
dialog: the reporters again!
dialog: ROBIE: (Smiles) Lepic—that’s all I wanted to know. Good day,
dialog: gentlemen.
text: He goes out the door, and down the corridor, whistling a light melody. Lepic sits heavily
text: back in his chair, angry at his outburst, and annoyed by Robie’s whistling.

scene_heading: 535. EXT. CEMETERY-(DAY)-LONG SHOT
text: The small graveyard on Cap Ferret is occupied by a moderate crowd, the core of which
text: surrounds a flower—decked grave. Along the wall overlooking the cemetery are groups of
text: sightseers, because this is a funeral of more than ordinary interest. Now and again a flashlight
text: goes off to indicate the presence of a news photographer. There are newsreel photographers
text: around, and quite a number of uniformed police.
scene_heading: 536. EXT. CEMETERY-(DAY)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: A nearer high view of the burial. Apart from the black—-clothed figure of Danielle, most of
text: the mourners appear to be men. There seem to be very few women around, except among

dialog: service in Latin.
scene_heading: 537. EXT. CEMETERY-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP

scene_heading: 538. EXT. CEMETERY-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: The CAMERA PANS slowly along their faces. They are the men of the kitchen staff at
text: Bertani’s restaurant. Claude of the Beach Club is among them. One by one they notice the
text: presence of Robie, and look up with no unusual expressions, absorbed as they are in the
text: sadness of Foussard’s funeral.

scene_heading: 540. EXT. CEMETERY-(DAY) -SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: The CAMERA PANS BACK from Danielle to Bertani’s face. He has now seen Robie. He

text: Robie. Claude follows closely behind him, like a bodyguard.
scene_heading: 541. EXT. CEMETERY-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSED?
text: Robie does not acknowledge the greeting of Bertani. Instead, he studies him for a moment,
text: and then follows the approach of Bertani with his eyes. In a moment, Bertani appears by the
text: side of Robie, and slightly behind him. He speaks to him with a low whisper. We can still
text: hear the priest intoning the burial service.
dialog: BERTANI: (Half-whisper) A most unhappy affair, eh, Robie?
dialog: ROBIE: Unhappy because it isn’t me down there?
dialog: BERTANI: Poor Danielle—I have great compassion for her.
dialog: ROBIE: T’ll look out for her. What do you suppose happened to
dialog: the things he stole?
dialog: BERTANI: (Shrugs) That’s a mystery. The Police have looked in every

text: Another view of the roof.
scene_heading: 553. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-LONG SHOT

scene_heading: 554. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-LONG SHOT
text: The entrance gate at the bottom of the driveway leading to the villa. A long line of cars

scene_heading: 556. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: This is the main doorway from the house to the grounds. A flight of broad, wide stone steps
text: lead froma terrace. We get a glimpse of a large entrance hall brightly-lit inside. Through this
text: doorway and onto the terrace where Mr. and Mrs. Sanford, in their costumes, greet the
text: arrivals. Having made their Eighteenth Century curtsies to the hostess and host, each new
text: arrival moves on down the steps and approaches THE CAMERA.
text: THE CAMERA concentrates on the central figure of each new tableau. As the figure comes
text: nearer, our attention is centered on the jewelry being worn. We are therefore successively
text: treated to displays of fabulous stones and elegant settings.
text: The SOUND of music is heard off, flourishing the entrance of the guests.
scene_heading: 557. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: A section of the richly gowned and costumed onlookers who applaud each new arrival. The
text: people seem to be enjoying themselves.
scene_heading: 558. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Two rather drab-looking 18th Century characters stand together in the line of onlookers. By
text: contrast to the others, they seem to show an indifference. However, their eyes study every
text: new entry. THE CAMERA PANS DOWN their bodies, past their knee-breeches, over their
dialog: 84
text: rather ill-fitting, twisted stockings, to two pairs of heavy, modern shoes with thick soles. The
text: shoes are also highly polished for the occasion.
scene_heading: 559. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: Another grand entry, to a round of applause. The woman again walks past THE CAMERA
text: until her jewelry fills the screen.
scene_heading: 560. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-CLOSEUP
text: A big head of Bertani. He is looking across, keenly, at the arriving guests. THE CAMERA
text: PULLS BACK to reveal that he is in the center of the activities in and around the kitchen
text: quarters. Actually we are in a small yard, and in the background, we can get a glimpse of a

dialog: various cold foods, etc.
text: When THE CAMERA FIRST MOVES BACK, we are near enough to catch sight of a
text: sad-faced Danielle who is unpacking champagne, and putting the bottles into large, ice—filled
text: tubs. Antoinette, Bertani’s cashier, is seated at a small table checking off items. There are
text: three other serving girls, in addition to three or four chefs, and La Mule doing the heavy
text: lifting. They are all in 18th Century costumes, the women dressed identically as serving
text: maids. The waiters move in and out, taking trays of food and supplies to the various buffet
text: tables in the main grounds. These are also dressed as lackies. Claude, of the Beach Club, is

text: THE CAMERA PANS Bertani over to Danielle. He gives her an affectionate pat on the

dialog: survey one of the buffet tables,
scene_heading: 561. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-SEMLLONG SHOT
text: Back around the grand entrance, the crowd has become much greater, and noisier. They are
text: just applauding a grande dame who has two Afghan hounds at the leash.
text: As she passes out of the picture, the Stevens and Robie appear. Mrs. Stevens comes first, and
text: is then followed by Francie with Robie as her blackamoor attendant. They are applauded in,
text: and continue on down the steps to be greeted by the Sanfords. They move on, into THE
text: CAMERA, and out of the picture.
scene_heading: 562. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: The buffet tables are beginning to become busy. Bertani is supervising the work of his chefs,
text: when he notices the arrival of Lepic, and his assistant Mercier, at the table. He crosses to
text: them genially. The CAMERA MOVES IN until the three of them are in CLOSER SHOT.
dialog: BERTANI: Un peu de Champagne, Commissaire? Au moins que vous
dialog: ne buviez pas pendant le service?
text: Lepic, answering Bertani’s smile:
dialog: LEPIC: Je ne bois jamais en dehors du service.

text: They toast each other silently.
scene_heading: 563. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Francis, her mother and Robie. They have come down into the grounds. Robie no longer has

text: Francis and nods his head toward the buffet tables.
dialog: 85
scene_heading: 564. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-SEMI-LONG SHOT

dialog: the same table.
scene_heading: 565. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-SEMI-CLOSEUP,
text: Francie reacts to the sight of the police. She gestures a warning to Robie, trying not to be
text: obvious. Robie’s answer is to grip the arms of the two women and move them over toward
text: the buffet table, THE CAMERA PANNING them.
scene_heading: 566. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: As the three of them come up to the table, Bertani and Lepic are in discussion. Mercier,

dialog: est la Loi.
text: The attendant, who is Claude of the Beach Club, noticing their arrival, asks:
dialog: CLAUDE: Champagne, Mesdames—Monsieur?
speaker_heading: FRANCIE: Yes, please.
text: Claude gets the glasses, and pours. Lepic, Bertani and Mercier seem to pay no attention to
text: the group. Lepic and Bertani carry on a conversation in French, possibly about the large
text: quantity of food and drink which will be served at the gala. Mrs. Stevens appears to suddenly
dialog: remember something.
text: MRS. STEVENS: Oh, my heart pills! (She turns to Robie) I can’t drink
text: champagne without my pills. It makes my heart pound.
dialog: FRANCIE: Where did you leave them?
text: MRS. STEVENS: In our room, when we put the luggage up there. They’re
dialog: probably in my purse. (To Robie) Would you be sweet,
dialog: John, and go get my purse for me?
speaker_heading: ROBIE: Of course.
text: He turns and walks toward the villa.
scene_heading: 567. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: Lepic and his assistant have picked up their ears during this last conversation. They look

dialog: Robie.
scene_heading: 568. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-CLOSE SHOT
text: A quick flash to Francie, as she puts a cautioning hand on her mother’s arm, and speaks
text: guardedly.
speaker_heading: FRANCIE: Mother—!

scene_heading: 570. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-SEMI-CLOSEUP

scene_heading: 571. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Lepic and his assistant have a hurried consultation and we see them divide and go off in
dialog: different directions.
scene_heading: 572. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Mercier stops in front of two costumed men and almost in pantomime describes Robie to

dialog: word.
scene_heading: 573. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Lepic comes up to the Sanfords and whispers to them. They look toward the party grounds
text: with apprehension. He calms them with confident assurances.
scene_heading: 574, EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-SEMI-LONG SHOT
text: Bertani has lust left the buffet table and we see him striding purposefully toward the kitchen
text: section. He glances over his shoulder for a. brief moment without interrupting his walk.
scene_heading: 575. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: We pick up Robie moving through the crowd and PAN HIM OVER to the Stevens. He
text: hands Mrs. Stevens her purse. Francie whispers something to him and he looks around. The
text: music for dancing begins and before they have time to drink the champagne which was
text: poured for them, Robie invites Francie to dance. He is accepted; and they leave Mrs. Stevens
text: standing at the buffet table.
scene_heading: 576. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-CLOSEUP
text: Mrs. Stevens looks around to see if she is being observed. Finding she is not, with great relief
text: she quickly drains the three glasses of champagne, one after another. Just as she puts down
text: the third glass, the attendant has turned around and noticed her consumption of champagne.
text: He picks up the bottle and offers her more.
dialog: MRS. STEVENS: Have you got any bourbon?
text: The attendant smiles, produces a bottle of bourbon. Mrs. Stevens begins pouring herself a
dialog: stiff drink.
scene_heading: 577. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-SEMI-LONG SHOT

scene_heading: LAP DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 585. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-LONG SHOT
text: Still another TOP SHOT of the dance floor from a different angle. It is much later. The band
text: SOUNDS a little tired. Six couples and dancing on the floor, one of which is Francie and

scene_heading: LAP DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 586. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-LONG SHOT
text: From a HIGH TOP SHOT of the dance floor, we see Francie and Robie dancing close and
text: romantically to the slow and sleepy music of the band. They are alone on the floor. Some
text: of the detectives are grouping together in apparent consultation. They look over their
text: shoulder occasionally at the dancing pair.
scene_heading: 587. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Bertani, who is supervising the cleaning up of one of the buffet tables, takes a step or two

scene_heading: 588. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-SEMI CLOSEUP
text: Lepic has now been joined by his assistant Mercier. The commissioner seems quite pleased

scene_heading: 589. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-LONG SHOT
text: Robie graciously escorts Francie off the dance floor, past the watching police. The police

scene_heading: 593. INT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: On the landing, at the end of the corridor, one of the two police hurriedly gestures his

scene_heading: 603. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-SEMI-CLOSEUP,

scene_heading: 623. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-CLOSEUP
text: The dark figure is twisting and fighting to keep the mask out of Robie’s grasp. Robie’s hand
text: finally goes out, tears the mask off. It is Danielle. Her hair falls down from underneath the
text: black beret she’s wearing. She looks up at him, caught, but defiant.
text: DANIELLE: (Breathing heavily) You think you’ve caught The Cat?
dialog: ROBIE: I caught you the night your father died. He couldn’t climb

dialog: DANIELLE: What a mistake! John Robie-ici! John Robie, Le Chat!
dialog: T’ve got him! Ici! Here! John Robie!

scene_heading: 633. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-MEDIUM SHOT

scene_heading: 635. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-SEMI-LONG SHOT We do not see Robie in the

text: Robie, takes the leap. She hits the sloping roof right in FRONT OF THE CAMERA. For a
text: second she seems to have secured a hold, but then starts slipping toward the edge of the roof.
text: Involuntarily, she gives a slight SCREAM of fright. There are SCREAMS and SUDDEN
text: SHOUTS from the onlookers below, as she goes over the side of the roof.
scene_heading: 644, EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-CLOSE SHOT,
text: We see the tremendous drop beyond her hanging figure. She is holding the rain gutter with

text: The CAMERA is now below, SHOOTING UP between the gap of the roof edges. Robie,

text: Robie secures a foothold as best he can, and reaches down for Danielle’s hand, which is

scene_heading: 650. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-SEMI-CLOSEUP
text: There is a genuine fright on Danielle’s face as she looks up to Robie.
dialog: DANIELLE: Pull me up!
dialog: ROBIE: I’m trying to think of a reason why I should.
dialog: DANIELLE: (Louder) Now pull me up!
dialog: ROBIE: Don’t shout. It makes me nervous. I might drop you.
dialog: DANIELLE: Then go ahead—drop me!
dialog: ROBIE: Whatever you say.
text: He lowers his arm slightly. Even greater fright passes over Danielle’s face. She quickly
dialog: shouts:
speaker_heading: DANIELLE: No!
text: His grip tightens and holds.
dialog: ROBIE: You’ve got a full house down there, Danielle. Now shall
dialog: we begin the performance?
dialog: DANIELLE: What performance?
dialog: ROBIE: The one in which you tell them who is really who—and
dialog: what is really what.
dialog: DANIELLE: Please, John—I might slip!
dialog: ROBIE: I figure I can hold you another thirty seconds. No more.
dialog: DANIELLE: (Desperately) I did it for my father!
dialog: ROBIE: That’s fine...but I already know it. We’re telling them—
dialog: down there—remember?
text: Danielle looks down and the sight frightens her even more. She looks up again.
dialog: DANIELLE: 1’ll kill you when I get up there.
dialog: ROBIE: If you get up here. (Sharply) Tell them!
text: She gives him a look of hatred, then shouts down:
text: DANIELLE: I was working for my father! (She looks up) Now,
dialog: please—
dialog: ROBIE: Your father is conveniently dead. Who else?
text: DANIELLE: (Shouting down) And Claude, too! (To Robie) That’s all.
dialog: ROBIE: I’m out of training. I think my fingers are beginning to
dialog: open.
dialog: DANIELLE: (Anguish) I don’t know anything more!
dialog: ROBIE: (Patiently) Now why protect him? He’s probably keeping
dialog: all the jewels himself. Tell that: who was behind it—who
dialog: engineered everything—who sent me the “weather
dialog: reports”—who knew as much about as I knew myself. Go
dialog: on.
dialog: 94
text: DANIELLE: (After hesitation, shouts down) Bertani! Augustus Bertani
dialog: was behind it! (Looks up) Now, you miserable—
dialog: ROBIE: You left out one important thing. —Of course, I’m selfish.
dialog: DANIELLE: I know nothing more. You’re frightening me to death!
dialog: ROBIE: You'll, probably think of it—just before you hit the
text: ground. I’m getting a cramp in my arm.
text: He seems to lower her slightly. She is terrified.
text: DANIELLE: (Looks down, closing her eyes, shouts) John Robie had
dialog: nothing to do with it! Nothing! (Looks up, frightened
dialog: almost to tears) Now, please—please pull me up! I'll die—
text: Slowly Robie pulls her up to the roof. She freezes against the tiles, sobbing with relief and
text: shock. Robie leans back against the roof and takes a deep breath of the night air.

scene_heading: 651. INT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: In the main entrance hall of the Sanford villa, lighted sparingly. Standing in a casual group
text: are Lepic, Mercier, Danielle, Bertani and Hughson. Robie, Francie and Mrs. Stevens cross
text: the hallway on their way to the door. They pause. Lepic, who is speaking, seems much more
dialog: affable than we have known him to be.
dialog: LEPIC: Well, I think we have discussed all the details. Is anything
dialog: not clear to you, Monsieur Bertani?
dialog: BERTANI: (Shrugs pleasantly) No—but one little request.
speaker_heading: LEPIC: Yes?
dialog: BERTANI: That I come to the police station at twelve tomorrow,
dialog: instead of ten.
dialog: LEPIC: (Smiles) Ten, please. Be on time.
dialog: BERTANI: But I must find somebody to manage my restaurant. (He
dialog: winks broadly) | may be away a long time, eh?
dialog: LEPIC: (Shrugs) A private matter—between you and the judge.
dialog: BERTANI: (Smiles) Twelve o’clock, then?
dialog: LEPIC: (Pleasantly) Ten. And bring a lawyer, if you desire.
text: BERTANI: (Skeptically) No thank you. (Bows slightly to the group)
dialog: Bonne nuit, mesdames et messieurs.
text: They nod silently in, return to him.
dialog: BERTANI: (To Robie) I regret having given you such trouble,
dialog: Monsieur Robie.
dialog: ROBIE: Well, Bertani—had it ended differently, I might have been
dialog: a little put out. As it is, I have no personal complaints.
dialog: BERTANI: You'll eat at my restaurant again?
dialog: ROBIE: The very day you get out.
dialog: BERTANI: Ah...we’ll have a great feast!
dialog: ROBIE: Hurry back.
dialog: 95
text: BERTANI: (Smiles to him, turns to go, remembers something) Oh
dialog: —Monsieur Lepic, pardon—Danielle Foussard. May I
dialog: bring her with me at ten?
dialog: LEPIC: Unfortunately, no. She comes with us tonight.
dialog: BERTANI: (Shrugs) If you must. Bonne nuit.
text: He turns and walks across the hallway and out of the picture.
scene_heading: 651A. INT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Robie turns to Francie and Mrs. Stevens.
dialog: ROBIE: I think we had better “bonne nuit” ourselves.
text: Francie isn’t listening to him. She seems to be staring at Danielle with a look that could be
text: either sympathy, or wonder. Robie follows her glance. Danielle is nonchalantly yawning.
dialog: DANIELLE: I'd like to get some sleep.
dialog: LEPIC: I’m afraid that your next bed will be a hard one.
dialog: DANIELLE: I don’t mind. I’ve slept on prison beds before.
dialog: ROBIE: (Looks at her quickly) When were you ever in prison,
dialog: Danielle?
text: DANIELLE: (Stops, looks directly at him) I was born in jail.
text: Robie and Francie look at each other, not too happily. Mrs. Stevens starts moving for the
dialog: door.
dialog: ROBIE: (To Danielle) Goodnight.
text: Danielle smiles at him, then quickly walks up to him and impulsively kisses him.
dialog: DANIELLE: Well, no South America.
speaker_heading: ROBIE: Guess not.
text: They separate and Robie takes Francie’s arm, and follows Mrs. Stevens out of the hallway.
scene_heading: 651B. EXT. SANFORD VILLA-(NIGHT)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Robie, Francis and Mrs. Stevens come down the steps of the villa. They are met by La Mule
text: and a couple of the chefs from Bertani’s restaurant. The men rash up to Robie, to embrace
text: him, shake his hand, punch him affectionately.
dialog: LA MULE: Ah, Monsieur Robie!
dialog: CHEF: Nous avons honte de vous avoir si mal jugé. Nous vous
dialog: prions de nous excuser.
text: Robie smiles happily at the group.

scene_heading: 654, EXT. ROBIE’S VILLA-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Robie enters the patio of his villa. He walks over to the low wall beyond which lies the hills
text: and valleys of St. Gennet. He seems disturbed about something. He hears someone coming
text: into the patio from around the house. He turns, and looks with some surprise.
dialog: 96
scene_heading: 655. EXT. ROBIE’S VILLA-(DAY)-MEDIUM SHOT
text: Francie stands, watching him briefly. She isn’t smiling, but seems composed. She begins to
text: walk forward, the CAMERA PANNING her.
scene_heading: 656. EXT. ROBIE’S VILLA-(DAY)-SEMI-CLOSE SHOT
text: Robie is still surprised to see her.
dialog: ROBIE: Who brought you up here?
text: Francis comes into the picture, approaching Robie.
dialog: FRANCIE: The police. And we'd have caught you, if this dress hadn’t
text: gotten all over the gear shift and the wheel.
text: She stands next to him, looking out over the valley.
dialog: ROBIE: But it was only twenty minutes ago that I said goodbye!
dialog: FRANCIE: As quickly as you could.
dialog: ROBIE: Didn’t I thank you?
speaker_heading: FRANCIE: Politely.
dialog: ROBIE: Then what—uh—?
text: She turns to him.
dialog: FRANCIE: John—you left in such a hurry you almost ran.
dialog: ROBIE: I had things to do up here.
dialog: FRANCIE: Were you afraid I’d make you admit that without me you
dialog: couldn’t have saved yourself?
text: He doesn’t answer.
dialog: FRANCIE: That you needed the help of a “good woman? That you’re
dialog: not the lone wolf you think you are?
text: Robie throws out a hand in a gesture of gracious admission.
dialog: ROBIE: All right—without you I couldn’t have done it.
text: He begins to see some of the humor in his situation.
dialog: ROBIE: I needed the help of a woman.
text: He gives in.
dialog: ROBIE: I guess I’m not the lone wolf I thought I was, Francis.
dialog: FRANCIE: (She is pleased) I just wanted to hear you say it. Thank
dialog: you, and goodbye.
text: She turns, and starts to leave. But he quickly reaches out, takes her by the arm, and turns her
text: around. He pulls her close to him, kisses her. It is full, passionate—more of love than of sex.
text: Then he buries his face in her shoulder. She looks up, with a shining and happy face. Her
text: eyes are somewhat misty, but she manages a lightness to her voice as she says:
dialog: FRANCIE: So this is where you live?—I think I’m going to like it.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
