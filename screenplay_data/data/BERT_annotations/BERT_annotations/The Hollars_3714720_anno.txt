scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM, HOLLAR HOUSE. DAY.
text: A woman stands in front of a bathroom mirror, curling her
text: hair. Her name is SALLY HOLLAR, 58. Sally is dressed in a
text: pink nightgown and robe. She is a kind looking woman.
text: Heavy set and motherly with lines of distinction on her
text: face. She takes a breath and faces herself in the mirror.
text: A troubled look flutters across her eyes.
text: An out of shape man opens the door to the bathroom. His
text: name is RON HOLLAR, 36. Ron is Sally’s son. He looks
text: surprised to see his mother there.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Oh. Sorry. I thought you were...gone.
text: Sally looks annoyed.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Ronald. This is my bathroom. If you're
dialog: going to stay here, you have to use the
text: downstairs bathroom.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Dad’s in that one.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Well, then you’re going to have to wait.
text: Ron goes to leave... then comes back.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: How long?--
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Close the door.
text: Sally picks up her curling iron.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, HOLLAR HOUSE. DAY.
text: Ron holds himself as he looks around the kitchen. He
text: takes a container for juice out of a cupboard and pees
text: into it. A look of relief comes across his face as he
text: urinates into the container.
speaker_heading: MAN (0.S.)
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
text: Ron jumps, almost spilling everywhere.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Jesus, Dad, you scared me!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Ron looks over his shoulder at his father, DONALD HOLLAR,
text: 62, staring at him. Don is a taller, angry looking man.
text: He is dressed in flannel pajamas.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Your mother puts orange juice in that
dialog: thing.
text: Ron can’t stop peeing.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I’m going to wash it.
text: Don looks upset. But before he can say anything else
text: Sally screams in the bathroom. Glass breaks.
text: Don and Ron give each other a look.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM, HOLLAR HOUSE. DAY.
text: Ron and Don find Sally shaking on the floor.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: (totally confused)
dialog: Sally! What-- What are you doing on the
dialog: floor?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: What do you mean you don’t know?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I think I’m having a stroke.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: A stroke?! You’re only fifty eight.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Dad! The curling iron!
text: The curling iron is burning her wrist.
scene_heading: A MUSIC CUE BEGINS
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Get up, chief.
speaker_heading: SALLY
text: I can’t. I can’t move.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Ron goes over to his mother and moves the curling iron

speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Oh, my god.

speaker_heading: RON (CONT'D)
dialog: Dad, call an ambulance!
text: Don doesn’t move.
speaker_heading: RON (CONT'D)
dialog: (screams )
dialog: Dad, call an ambulance! Now!

scene_heading: INT. OFFICE CUBICLE, NEW YORK CITY. DAY.
text: THE SAME MUSIC CUE FROM THE LAST SCENE CONTINUES as we
text: come in on a man, 34, sitting at a cubicle talking on the
text: phone. He is of average height and weight. He has a
text: common face with a good natured grin. He wears a blue
text: oxford with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows and dark
text: grey slacks. His name is John Hollar. Hanging on the
text: cubicle walls are a few pictures of him with his
text: girlfriend and many, many comic book-esque drawings.
text: John wears a head set as he seemingly draws something.
text: Suddenly the music stops. We hear a very southern voice.

speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: No, we don’t have anything to do with

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Uh, yes. Yes. This is John Hollar.
dialog: No response.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: From Routlege Publishing?...We spoke last
dialog: week.
text: There is no answer. John looks for an invoice number on
text: his desk. As he turns we see what he’s been drawing... A
text: bizarre cartoon of a baby in an ultra sound photo. The
text: baby looks angrily out at John with a word bubble above
dialog: it’s head. “Oh, great!”
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)

speaker_heading: JOHN

dialog: I have a girlfriend who I don’t deserve.
text: She’s beautiful and smart and runs her
dialog: own company. We’ve been together for 3
dialog: years! She’s amazing! But, that doesn’t
dialog: stop my insane brain from consistently
dialog: questioning and over analyzing our

speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: ...No.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Well, lemme tell ya, nothing holds your

speaker_heading: DR. FONG
dialog: It could be any number of reasons. We
dialog: have no way of knowing right now. I will
dialog: say this, it’s not a young tumor. I'd say
