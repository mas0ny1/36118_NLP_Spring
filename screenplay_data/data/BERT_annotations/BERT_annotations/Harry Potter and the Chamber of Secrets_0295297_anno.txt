text: The Hand of Glory. Nearby, an OPAL NECKLACE gleams:

text: CLOSING IN.
speaker_heading: MR. BORGIN
dialog: Mr. Malfoy! What a pleasure to

dialog: today --
speaker_heading: LUCIUS MALFOY
dialog: I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin.
dialog: But selling.
speaker_heading: MR. BORGIN
dialog: Selling?
speaker_heading: LUCIUS MALFOY
dialog: You have heard, of course, that
dialog: the Ministry of Magic is

dialog: even rumors of a new Muggle
dialog: Protection Act...
text: Lucius unravels a roll of parchment, hands it to Borgin.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS MALFOY
dialog: I have a few... ah... items at

dialog: Certain poisons and the like...
speaker_heading: MR. BORGIN
dialog: Hmmm... yes. I see...
text: INSIDE THE CABINET, Harry realizes the walls are CLOSING

speaker_heading: LUCIUS MALFOY
dialog: Hopefully my son will amount to

speaker_heading: DRACO
dialog: It's not my fault the teachers

speaker_heading: LUCIUS MALFOY
dialog: I would have thought you'd be

dialog: Very good. I'1l expect you at the

speaker_heading: LUCIUS MALFOY

scene_heading: JUSTIN-FINCH-FLETCHLEY

speaker_heading: ERNIE

dialog: Remember what was written on the

dialog: Potter had some sort of run-in

speaker_heading: HANNAH

speaker_heading: TOM RIDDLE

speaker_heading: TUNNEL.
scene_heading: INT. CHAMBER OF SECRETS - SIDE TUNNEL - NIGHT 133A

scene_heading: TURNS BACK.

dialog: memory. Lord Voldemort will
dialog: return. Very much... alive.
text: Harry moves toward Ginny, then suddenly... the BASILISK
text: SHOOTS OUT of the TUNNEL, HISSING directly in front of
text: Harry. Trapped, Harry glances around, then --
text: impulsively -- LEAPS upward, begins to scale the statue
text: of Salazar Slytherin. The serpent strikes madly, but
text: Harry continues on, CLIMBING BOLDLY until he reaches the
text: top. He turns. Sees the Sorting Hat. Sees what
text: glitters within: the RUBY HANDLE of a SWORD.
text: Harry WHEELS, sword in hand, and fends off the slashing
text: serpent like St. George and the dragon. In a mad rush of
text: courage, he PITCHES HIMSELF onto the serpent, SLIDES DOWN
text: its back and rolls up, SWORD RAISED. Too tired to flee,
text: Harry simply waits. The serpent rises and, FANGS
text: BARED... STRIKES.
text: Marshalling every ounce of strength left to him, Harry
text: drives the sword upward, deep into the roof of the
text: SERPENT'S mouth. It HISSES in PAIN, thrashing MADLY as
text: it drives a FANG into Harry's arm. Harry clutches his
text: arm in agony, stumbles back and falls to the floor,
text: watching as the serpent THRASHES briefly... then goes
speaker_heading: STILL.
text: Harry peers down, sees the FANG that pierces his arm, the
text: blood soaking slowly into his robe. As he yanks the fang
text: free, Riddle steps forward, almost fully whole now. His
text: eyes shine at the sight of Harry's wound.
speaker_heading: TOM RIDDLE
dialog: Remarkable, isn't it? How quickly
dialog: the venom of the Basilisk
dialog: penetrates the body? If you have
dialog: any final words, Potter, you'd
dialog: best speak them now. I'd guess
dialog: you have little more than a minute
dialog: to live.

dialog: the pages.
speaker_heading: TOM RIDDLE
dialog: No!
text: Riddle SHRIEKS, writhing in pain. His body begins to

dialog: Harry. It was me! But I swear, I

speaker_heading: HARRY
