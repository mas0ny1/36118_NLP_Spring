text: The Hand of Glory. Nearby, an OPAL NECKLACE gleams:

text: CLOSING IN.
speaker_heading: MR. BORGIN
dialog: Mr. Malfoy! What a pleasure to
dialog: see you again. If I may, just in
dialog: today --
speaker_heading: LUCIUS MALFOY
dialog: I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin.
dialog: But selling.
speaker_heading: MR. BORGIN
dialog: Selling?
speaker_heading: LUCIUS MALFOY
dialog: You have heard, of course, that
dialog: the Ministry of Magic is
text: conducting more raids. There are
dialog: even rumors of a new Muggle
dialog: Protection Act...
text: Lucius unravels a roll of parchment, hands it to Borgin.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS MALFOY
dialog: I have a few... ah... items at
dialog: home that might prove embarrassing
dialog: if the Ministry were to call.
dialog: Certain poisons and the like...
speaker_heading: MR. BORGIN
dialog: Hmmm... yes. I see...
text: INSIDE THE CABINET, Harry realizes the walls are CLOSING
text: IN. His eyes shift upward. The ceiling is DROPPING.
text: Draco drifts to the Hand of Glory, reaches out, when...

speaker_heading: LUCIUS MALFOY
dialog: Hopefully my son will amount to

speaker_heading: DRACO
dialog: It's not my fault the teachers

speaker_heading: LUCIUS MALFOY
dialog: I would have thought you'd be

speaker_heading: LUCIUS MALFOY
dialog: Very good. I'1l expect you at the
dialog: manor tomorrow. Come, Draco.
text: They exit. As Borgin slips into the back room, the

speaker_heading: LUCIUS MALFOY
dialog: Yes, a pity about your parents.

scene_heading: JUSTIN-FINCH-FLETCHLEY

speaker_heading: ERNIE

dialog: Remember what was written on the

dialog: Potter had some sort of run-in

speaker_heading: HANNAH

dialog: Yes, Potter. The process is
dialog: nearly complete. Ina few

dialog: dead. And I will cease to be a
dialog: memory. Lord Voldemort will
dialog: return. Very much... alive.
text: Harry moves toward Ginny, then suddenly... the BASILISK
text: SHOOTS OUT of the TUNNEL, HISSING directly in front of
text: Harry. Trapped, Harry glances around, then --
text: impulsively -- LEAPS upward, begins to scale the statue
text: of Salazar Slytherin. The serpent strikes madly, but
text: Harry continues on, CLIMBING BOLDLY until he reaches the
text: top. He turns. Sees the Sorting Hat. Sees what
text: glitters within: the RUBY HANDLE of a SWORD.
text: Harry WHEELS, sword in hand, and fends off the slashing
text: serpent like St. George and the dragon. In a mad rush of
text: courage, he PITCHES HIMSELF onto the serpent, SLIDES DOWN
text: its back and rolls up, SWORD RAISED. Too tired to flee,
text: Harry simply waits. The serpent rises and, FANGS
text: BARED... STRIKES.
text: Marshalling every ounce of strength left to him, Harry
text: drives the sword upward, deep into the roof of the
text: SERPENT'S mouth. It HISSES in PAIN, thrashing MADLY as
text: it drives a FANG into Harry's arm. Harry clutches his
text: arm in agony, stumbles back and falls to the floor,
text: watching as the serpent THRASHES briefly... then goes
speaker_heading: STILL.
text: Harry peers down, sees the FANG that pierces his arm, the
text: blood soaking slowly into his robe. As he yanks the fang
text: free, Riddle steps forward, almost fully whole now. His
text: eyes shine at the sight of Harry's wound.
speaker_heading: TOM RIDDLE
dialog: Remarkable, isn't it? How quickly
dialog: the venom of the Basilisk
dialog: penetrates the body? If you have
dialog: any final words, Potter, you'd
dialog: best speak them now. I'd guess
dialog: you have little more than a minute

dialog: the pages.
speaker_heading: TOM RIDDLE
dialog: No!
text: Riddle SHRIEKS, writhing in pain. His body begins to

text: MOAN. Ginny STIRS, color blooming in her cheeks. As she
text: sees Harry, she SOBS.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Harry. It was me! But I swear, I
dialog: didn't mean to... Riddle made me.
dialog: He wrote to me... took me over...

dialog: Ingenious. Simply... ingenious.

speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Only because I asked it to.
