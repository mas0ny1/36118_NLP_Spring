scene_heading: DR. WAGGNER’S TV SPEECH
dialog: We've all heard people talk about “animal magnetism”, about the “natural
text: man” and the “noble savage”. As if we had lost something valuable in our
dialog: long evolution into civilized human beings -- and there’s a good reason for
dialog: this. Man is a combination of the learned and the instinctual, of the
dialog: sophisticated and the primitive. We should never try to deny the beast, the
dialog: animal, within us -- only to channel these energies in a positive
dialog: direction.
dialog: All of us have a great untapped potential -- a potential for living. What
dialog: we do with that potential, with that life, depends as much on our attitudes
dialog: toward our physical desires as it does on the social programming of our
dialog: minds. The struggle between mind and body is not a necessary one. It
text: produces anger, frustration, the strain of modern-day living in a world
text: that’s moving too quickly toward its own annihilation. Stress results when
dialog: we fight against our impulses, when we attempt to destroy the natural man
dialog: or woman within us. Repression is the father of neurosis, of self-hatred.
dialog: Let me say a few words about my new book, THE GIFT. When we’re born, each
