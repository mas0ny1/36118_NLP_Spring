scene_heading: FADE IN ON:
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT -- MOVING
text: A DISTORTED IMAGE of downtown city streets at night.
text: This is not a FISHEYE LENS, but the REFLECTION in the
text: mirrored surface of a helmet visor.
scene_heading: EXT. LUXURY BUILDING - NIGHT
text: A near-future MOTORCYCLE stops near a dramatic HIGH-RISE
text: RESIDENTIAL BUILDING. The rider, clad in black leather,
text: climbs off his machine. We'll call him the ASSASSIN.
text: He flips up his VISOR. His face is scarred, stubbly. He
text: conceals himself in an alcove, eyes never leaving the
text: building's entrance.
text: A uniformed DOORMAN opens the high-rise's lobby door for
text: a HANDSOME YOUNG MAN in a TUXEDO and TRENCHCOAT.
text: THE ASSASSIN has been waiting for this. He removes what
text: looks like a rifle scope from his jacket, aims it at
speaker_heading: TUXEDO.
text: SCOPE POV - focusing on TUXEDO'S FACE, magnified. A
text: digital readout: "SCANNING..." Then a long SERIAL
text: NUMBER reads out and the name, "LIONEL ALEXANDER CANTER,"
dialog: along with other personal information below.
text: THE ASSASSIN puts away the scanner scope, satisfied. He
text: reaches a hand into a pocket, withdraws a mysterious
text: DEVICE. The size of a first generation cellphone, it has
text: a military look, with a clear sliding panel over safety
text: switches and buttons.
text: The ASSASSIN hurries toward TUXEDO, but before he can
speaker_heading: REACH HIM--
text: A sleek, futuristic LIMOUSINE pulls up and TUXEDO gets in
text: the back. They're gone in an instant.
text: The ASSASSIN, frustrated, dashes for his MOTORCYCLE. He
text: starts it and pursues the limousine.

dialog: 2.
scene_heading: EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT
text: THE MOTORCYCLE pursues the LIMOUSINE along the Potomac,
text: D. C. LANDMARKS visible in the distance.
scene_heading: EXT. KENNEDY CENTER - NIGHT
text: FORMAL CROWDS, a RED CARPET, signs for an OPERA. The
text: LIMOUSINE approaches.
scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
text: TUXEDO leans forward to the DRIVER, a muscular, handsome
text: man in a suit named ARMANDO.
speaker_heading: TUXEDO
dialog: I'm not really in the mood for
dialog: opera, Armando.
text: ARMANDO nods knowingly pulls back into traffic.
speaker_heading: ARMANDO
dialog: F Street?
speaker_heading: TUXEDO
speaker_heading: (UNDOING BOWTIE)
dialog: You read my mind. Let's not
dialog: mention this to my Dad...
text: As he speaks, he passes a few BILLS over the seat.
scene_heading: EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT
text: THE LIMO moves through this seemingly deserted area,
text: pulls up near a STEEL DOOR with a spray-painted X.
text: TUXEDO emerges sans jacket and tie, his dress-shirt open.
speaker_heading: TUXEDO
dialog: I can find my way back.
text: ARMANDO nods and pulls away. TUXEDO moves toward the
text: entrance, says a word into an INTERCOM with a
text: SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. The door opens within moments, he
text: disappears inside.
text: THE ASSASSIN parks his bike, a few steps behind. Tuxedo
text: has vanished through the STEEL DOOR before he can catch
text: up with him.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The ASSASSIN takes off his helmet, tries the door. It
text: won't move. He buzzes the intercom. The DOOR slides
dialog: open a crack--
text: THE BOUNCER is a huge, bald man with JET BLACK skin, RED
text: EYES and TEETH that glow fluorescently. The THROBBING
text: BEAT of MUSIC within. The BOUNCER narrows his eyes.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: This is a private club.
speaker_heading: ASSASSIN
dialog: I just need to talk to--
text: THE STEEL DOOR has already shut in his face.
scene_heading: INT. THE PIT - NIGHT
text: POUNDING MUSIC. BODIES SLAM together in a brutal mosh
text: pit, MEN and WOMEN. All are young, some beautiful,
text: others extremely decorated and pierced. They tear at
text: each other brutally, trying to do real damage. On the
text: edges of the pit, individual FISTFIGHTS go on. An
text: incongruous CHANDELIER overhead, gilt-edged MIRRORS on
text: the walls-- the FIGHTERS SLAM INTO and SHATTER them.
text: A HARD-CORE BAND plays on an elevated stage. The
text: MUSICIANS are heavily punked out, in outlandish clothes,
text: with pierced faces, tattoos and body make-up.
text: IN A VIP AREA, a balcony elevated above the stage,
text: numerous BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE at tables. Many are making
text: out, gay, straight, threesomes-- orgies happen up here.
text: TUXEDO sits by himself. He raises a GLASS TUBE attached
text: to a CORD, one of a few leading into an ELECTRONIC DEVICE
text: on the table. As he brings the tube close to his own
text: neck, an ARC of electricity jumps to his skin. His
text: features go slack, a shudder goes through him. Then he
text: lowers the tube with a smile. He's using a JACKER-- a
text: sort of electro-shock hookah. A SHOUT over the MUSIC:
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: Mind if I join you?
text: A stunningly beautiful BLONDE in edgy, dramatic clothes
text: stands nearby. Tuxedo, recovering from the hit, gestures
text: graciously for her to sit. She picks up one of the
text: cords, gives him a sly smile. She opens her mouth,
text: SPARKS fly to her tongue and--
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
text: RAIN pours down as TUXEDO and the BLONDE burst out the
text: door, laughing. He pushes her against a brick wall, they
text: grope each other hungrily, hands inside clothes, getting
text: drenched in the warm downpour.
text: WITH THE ASSASSIN, wearing his HELMET with the VISOR UP,
text: as he approaches the entwined couple. TUXEDO hears him,
speaker_heading: TURNS--
speaker_heading: TUXEDO
dialog: Get lost, meatbag.
scene_heading: EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT
text: ANGLE ON the alley's mouth as we hear the BLONDE'S
text: SCREAM. Seconds later she staggers out, clutching her
text: head, and collapses to the pavement. We hear an ENGINE
text: START from the alleyway.
text: THE ASSASSIN emerges on his bike, rides directly over her
text: body unconcerned-- and ROARS into the night.
scene_heading: CAMERA PULLS UP to--
scene_heading: EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT
text: --an AERIAL VIEW of the rain-swept CITY, some futuristic
text: HIGH-RISES amongst the recognizeable landmarks. Also, a
text: great number of SUPER-CELL TOWERS and DISHES,
dialog: considerably larger than the ones we see today.
text: CAMERA PICKS UP SPEED, moves quickly to a run-down part
text: of the city, tenements and vacant lots. MOVE DOWN and
text: through a third-story window of--
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED PROJECT BUILDING - NIGHT
text: A dark, decaying hallway. A MAN and a WOMAN move
text: stealthily up the stairs, LASER-SIGHT GUNS in hand.
text: The man is THOMAS GREER, the woman JENNIFER PETERS. Both
text: are about 30, handsome, athletic. Greer's spent his life
dialog: in law enforcement. He's smart and able, wants things to
text: make sense-- but as the world changes around him, he
text: feels he's losing the thread. PETERS is junior to Greer,
text: her attitude's professional but rigid, by the book.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: GREER, in the lead, waves PETERS up. They approach a
text: door at the end of the hall. We see now that their
text: windbreakers read "FBI."
text: GREER kicks open the door--
scene_heading: INT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT
text: Lit by CANDLES and KEROSENE LANTERNS, SMOKE HANGS in the
text: room. We glimpse BODIES hanging from the ceiling in
text: CHAINS. GREER and PETERS train their LASERS around the
text: place, disturbed by the scene. A flash of MOVEMENT in a
dialog: bedroom and a CRASH--
text: THE PSYCHO who lives here has kicked over a LANTERN, FIRE
text: spills across the floor. We glimpse a surprisingly good-
text: looking guy, grinning maniacally. He dashes across the
speaker_heading: ROOM--
text: GREER squeezes off a couple of SHOTS. The PSYCHO's too
text: fast, he LEAPS through a cracked WINDOW.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT
text: RAIN has let up. The PSYCHO FALLS thirty feet into a
text: pile of soft DIRT and TRASH. He rolls to the bottom,
text: gets to his feet and runs.
text: GREER looks down from the broken window.
scene_heading: INT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT
text: PETERS is beating at the FLAMES with a towel, sees Greer
text: is preparing to jump.
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: Let's call for back-up.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Where'.s the sport in that?
speaker_heading: PETERS
speaker_heading: IT'S PROTOCOL--
scene_heading: GREER SNORTS and--
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT
text: --LEAPS, GREER hits the dirt hard and rolls. He reaches
text: the ground and sets off after the PSYCHO at top speed.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: PLAY A FRANTIC FOOT CHASE, both men scramble over chain-
text: link fences, leap over trashed cars.
text: GREER pursues the PSYCHO around a corner, into a
dialog: passageway between buildings--
text: --wherethePSYCHO gets the jump on him, SWINGS a length
text: of pipeathis head. Greer ducks fast, the blow catches
text: him inthearm, he drops his gun. The PSYCHO moves to
text: pick uptheweapon, but Greer tackles him against a
text: dumpster.
text: Greer SLAMS the dumpster lid on the man repeatedly.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: You have the right to remain silent--
text: But the PSYCHO has grabbed something from the trash,
text: manages to SQUIRT BUG SPRAY in Greer's eyes.
text: Greer's blinded temporarily, the PSYCHO squirms away,
text: running from between buildings across a street--
text: WHAM! He's hit full-on by a SEMI, his body FLIES through
text: the air. He LANDS HARD on cement, but amazingly is still
text: alive. He tries to get up, but--
text: GREER plants a foot on his chest and holds him fast
text: against the ground. Greer, still wiping at this eyes,
text: points his weapon at the PSYCHO's head.
speaker_heading: GREER (CONT'D)
dialog: Stay with me asshole--
speaker_heading: PSYCHO
dialog: Why would I do that?
text: The PSYCHO grins-- then his head lolls back, eyes empty.
scene_heading: INT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT
text: PETERS is by a WOMAN'S BODY on the floor, holding a
text: pocket SCANNER close to her head. This small device
text: resembles an iPhone. There's tape over the woman's eyes
text: and mouth, which Peters peels away as she speaks into a
text: tiny cellphone earpiece.
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: Is this Kathy Welles...? My name
dialog: is Jennifer Peters, with the FBI's

dialog: contact information below.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT
scene_heading: ON GREER'S SCANNER - "NEW-U RENTAL AGENCY," with an ID
text: NUMBER, but no name.
text: GREER kneels beside the PSYCHO's body, pockets his
text: scanner. He's angry but resigned, he was half expecting
dialog: this.
text: THE SEMI DRIVER is still behind the wheel of his rig. He
dialog: calls out to Greer:
speaker_heading: SEMI DRIVER
dialog: Am I in trouble?
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: (waves him off)
dialog: Nah, go back to work.
text: GREER rises as his PHONE CHIMES, he touches his earpiece.
text: IN BG, the DRIVER pulls away.
speaker_heading: GREER (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: PETERS (FILTER)
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: He's a rental.
text: He disconnects, reaches to turn the PSYCHO's head to one
text: side. The back of his skull is smashed. Instead of gore
text: and brains, we see torn GRAY PLASTIC and dense CIRCUITRY,
text: oozing pinkish hydraulic fluid at his neck.
text: We're in a world of SURROGATES, remotely operated
dialog: synthetic humans (also known as SYNTHs). These are not
text: artificially-intelligent robots-- each is linked directly
text: to a human being, miles or hundreds of miles away.
text: Surrogates are distinguishable from flesh-and-blood
dialog: humans primarily by their physical perfection-- ugly
text: surrogates are rare. On closer look, their eyes may have
text: an inhuman quality. Without a human mind sending and
text: receiving impulses, they are completely inert.
text: Suddenly the PSYCHO comes to life, spins his head around
text: at an impossible angle and BITES GREER'S HAND.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He won't let go. Greer stomps on the-PSYCHO's head,
text: reaches with his other hand into the back of the skull to
text: wrench out a CIRCUIT BOARD. The PSYCHO finally stops
text: writhing, disconnected.
scene_heading: INT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT
text: PETERS talks on the phone while scanning a SEVERED HEAD.
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: I don't recommend reconnecting,
dialog: Ms. Welles... hello?
text: The WOMAN on the floor TWITCHES, her eyes open. She sits
text: up on her elbows, looks down to see--
text: --her legs are gone. The bottom half of her is missing,
text: her tattered T-shirt covers the damage, soaked with dark
text: green and pink liquids-- coolant and hydraulic fluids.
speaker_heading: VICTIM
dialog: Aw crap, I'm totalled!
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: Your insurance ought to cover it.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT
text: GREER trudges toward the building, on his cell, leaving
text: the body behind. He turns the CIRCUIT BOARD over in his
dialog: fingers.
speaker_heading: GREER

speaker_heading: DISPATCHER (FILTER)

text: GREER picks up the pace, heads OUT OF FRAME.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT
text: START ON THE BLONDE, eyes empty, face against the cement.
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: Abandoned.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Or something happened to the operator.
text: GREER and PETERS stand over the corpse, a UNIFORM stands
text: nearby. Greer holds his SCANNER near her head.
speaker_heading: GREER (CONT'D)
dialog: Registered to a Cameron Michaels,
dialog: out in Clarksburg...
speaker_heading: (TO UNIFORM)
dialog: You call her?
speaker_heading: UNIFORM
dialog: Left a message.
text: GREER is leaning closer to the dead Blonde's face.
text: X-CLOSE-- CRACKS in the GLASS of her eye. We see GREER'S
text: FRAGMENTED REFLECTION as he peers at this.
speaker_heading: GREER
text: Optics are damaged.
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: Musta cracked when she fell.
speaker_heading: (TO UNIFORM)
dialog: There's a second?
text: The UNIFORM leads GREER and PETERS past the blonde, into
dialog: the alley.

scene_heading: INT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
text: TUXEDO lies on his side, eyes closed. We can hear MUSIC
text: THROBBING from within.
speaker_heading: UNIFORM
dialog: Couldn't get an ID from this one.
text: GREER kneels by Tuxedo, looks at his fancy CUFFLINKS.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: A tux? Kind of over-dressed for a
dialog: jacker joint.
text: GREER pulls out his scanner.
text: BY TUXEDO's FACE, the SCANNER reads "NO SIGNAL."
text: GREER seems surprised. PETERS looks over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: Maybe he's real.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Little too pretty for that.
text: GREER lifts one of Tuxedo's eyelids-- CLOSE, shattered
text: GLASS, ELECTRONICS visible within.
speaker_heading: GREER (CONT'D)
dialog: He's synth all right.
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: Looks like the optics exploded...
text: Greer reaches behind Tuxedo's head, pulls out a small
text: specially-shaped TOOL and pries up the PANEL at the back
text: of Tuxedo's skull. He pulls out--
text: THE CIRCUIT BOARD, melted and scorched.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: So much for the identity chip.
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: I'll call for a pick-up. Maybe
text: diagnostics can make sense of it.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. 1-270 - NIGHT
text: A slightly futuristic sedan speeds through light late-

speaker_heading: PROPHET (RADIO)
dialog: You feel you are free. You can be
dialog: what you want, do what you want,
dialog: nothing can hurt you. But you have
dialog: ceased to live.
scene_heading: INT. FBI CAR - NIGHT
text: GREER drives. PETERS has her eyes closed in the
text: passenger seat. THE VOICE on the RADIO continues IN BG
text: through scene.
speaker_heading: PROPHET (RADIO)
dialog: You think you control your
text: surrogates, but it is they who have
dialog: taken over your lives. You lie in
dialog: your cells, pale and fat prisoners,
text: while the puppets walk and dance
dialog: and make love...
text: Peters BLINKS and comes to.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Welcome back.
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: (re: the radio)
dialog: Are we actually listening to the
dialog: Prophet? We oughta lock this guy

speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: "Dreads..."
speaker_heading: PETERS
text: They dread the present, they dread
speaker_heading: THE FUTURE--
dialog: (points at radio)
dialog: You know this joker's calling for an

text: ahead to jam his broadcasts.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Sounds like they're doing a bang-up
dialog: job out there. Why'd you transfer?
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: D. C.'s the heart of the action,
dialog: right? Plus my ex and I were in
dialog: the same office, it got a little
dialog: uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You get along with your last

scene_heading: EXT. MODERN APARTMENTS - NIGHT
text: MOVE ACROSS the facade of a suburban apartment complex.
text: A RED GLOW suffuses most of the windows, all of which are
text: BARRED. In this warm light, we glimpse OPERATORS in
text: reclining chairs, motionless. They could be watching TV,
text: but no sets are in sight.
text: MOVE TO FIND GREER and PETERS as they exit the sedan and
text: pass a sign: "SURROGATE-READY UNITS AVAILABLE."

dialog: 13.
scene_heading: INT. MODERN APARTMENTS/CORRIDOR- NIGHT
text: GREER and PETERS walk along an almost prison-like
text: corridor, SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS, heavy doors. They follow
text: an empty-faced walking MANNEQUIN in an ugly pantsuit.
text: This is the LANDLADY. Her mouth moves like a
text: ventriloquist's dummy as she speaks self-consciously:
speaker_heading: LANDLADY
dialog: I been having problems with my
dialog: surrie, this is just a loaner. Is
dialog: there some kind of trouble?
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Nothing to worry about.
speaker_heading: LANDLADY

speaker_heading: GREER

speaker_heading: LANDLADY
dialog: (POUNDS on a door)
dialog: Cam? Wake up, the police are here
dialog: to talk to you...
scene_heading: INT. CAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: The LANDLADY undoes the MULTIPLE LOCKS on the door of a
text: small one-room apartment. She opens it and lets GREER
text: and PETERS inside. A RED GLOW from the far end of the
text: room-- GREER flicks on overheads. The Landlady hovers by
text: the door as they move into the place.
text: It's minimalist, nothing on the walls. Empty pizza
text: boxes. Skirts, stockings, high-heels strewn around
text: haphazardly. We also glimpse a large CHARGING CRADLE,
text: contact points embedded in the foam inside, shaped to
text: accomodate a curvaceous female body.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Hello?
text: A fat, hairy arm hangs over the side of a high-tech
text: CHAIR. The two feds move quickly to see--
text: --CAMERON MICHAELS, a 40-ish, overweight, bald male in
text: his underwear. BLOOD runs from his nose, his face
text: twitches slightly; he lies in a STIM CHAIR.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: STIM CHAIRS resemble-oversized massage chairs, contoured
text: to the body, with padded head supports. They vibrate and
dialog: electronically stimulate the user to prevent atrophy.
text: A SENSORY PROJECTOR sits beside the chair. This device
text: looks like a COMPUTER TOWER. It's linked to an elaborate
text: HEADSET, with contact points around the skull. There's
text: also a MONITOR SCREEN which displays the operator's
text: remote POV.
speaker_heading: LANDLADY
dialog: Oh my God, Cameron--
text: GREER quickly detaches the headset, rips a small

text: the man's pupil response and pulse.
speaker_heading: GREER
text: Call the paramedics.
text: While Peters calls in BG, GREER moves to the PROJECTOR'S
text: MONITOR SCREEN and taps a touchpad.
text: ON SCREEN - STATIC. GREER REWINDS to POVs at the hard-
text: core CLUB. FAST FORWARD to the ALLEY, making out with
text: TUXEDO. This is a recording of recent experience, as
text: seen through the eyes of the BLONDE.
text: GREER switches to real-time. Tuxedo breaks the kiss and
text: turns to look OS.
speaker_heading: TUXEDO (ON SCREEN)
dialog: Get lost, meatbag.
text: As Tuxedo turns back TO CAMERA, we hear a hideous
text: ELECTRONIC SCREECH, Tuxedo's face contorts in pain... and
text: his EYES BURST, fragments of GLASS and ELECTRONICS fly.
text: The POV reels, we hear the Blonde's SCREAM-- and STATIC
text: again fills the screen.
text: GREER is disturbed by this, looks again at the
text: unconscious, quivering face of the man in the chair.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. D.C. SUBWAY - NIGHT
text: A mostly empty car, scattered SURRIE PASSENGERS ride

speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Not cool.
text: The DREAD turns-- GREER is holding up a BADGE. The Dread

text: the end of the car. Greer pockets his badge calmly.
scene_heading: EXT. GREER'S BUILDING - DAWN
text: GREER approaches an urban APARTMENT COMPLEX on foot,
text: carrying a bag of TAKE-OUT FOOD. HIGH FENCES, SECURITY
dialog: CAMERAS and SCANNERS, all commonplace in this world. We

scene_heading: INT. GREER'S BUILDING/HALLWAY - DAWN

scene_heading: INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/KITCHEN - DAWN

scene_heading: INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM -- DAWN
text: GREER enters the bedroom, places the water glass on a
dialog: bedside table beside--
text: --the REAL GREER. He looks five years older, twenty

text: GREER, a surrogate we now realize, undresses, puts his

text: into this, seems to relax. We hear a low HUM and--
text: --the REAL GREER's eyes open. He disconnects the HEADSET
text: and FINGERSLEEVE, the RED GLOW is replaced by WHITE
text: LIGHT. He sits up, yawns and sips the water. He rises

speaker_heading: WATERS
dialog: Old soldiers never die...

text: dozens of surrogates. Males and females, but all have

text: PETERS stares in wonder at this voyeur's paradise. GREER
text: grabs her arm to keep her from getting hit as a WATCHER
text: tracks past. The Watcher ignores them, intent on work.
text: They mount stairs into the RAISED HUB that overlooks the

text: THE PROPHET is speaking. He stands before a platform
text: atop wooden scaffolding, firewood piled below. A
text: formidable ring of BODYGUARDS stands between him and the
text: gathered throng of DREADS.
speaker_heading: PROPHET
dialog: --serving faithfully beside us in
dialog: the cause of humanity. _I had the
dialog: privilege of hearing his confession
text: shortly before his death.
text: GREER has pushed his way gently toward the front to get a
text: look at the BODY atop the funeral BIER.
text: The corpse atop the bier is that of JACK STRICKLAND, eyes
text: closed, hands folded.
speaker_heading: PROPHET (CONT'D)
dialog: And I know he would have rejoiced
dialog: in the day of resurrection, the
dialog: day for which we are all
dialog: preparing, the day I promise you
dialog: is close at hand...
text: So saying, the PROPHET lifts the torch and touches it to
text: the base of the PYRE, which ERUPTS IN FLAME.
text: CLOSE ON STRICKLAND as the FLAMES lick up around him.
text: LATER, the BIER consumed in FIRE, the MOURNERS
text: dispersing. THE PROPHET is moving away, HANDLERS
text: surrounding him. GREER tags along-- but one of the
text: Prophet's goons, BUD, gets in his face.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: What happened to Jack Strickland?
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: He slipped and fell. Friend of yours?
text: Greer starts to move around him, Bud gets in his way.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: I'd like a word with the Prophet.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: You and everyone else.
text: MILLER and ADAMS, another goon, now join them.
speaker_heading: GREER
text: Strickland was carrying a weapon.
dialog: If it isn't recovered, there could
dialog: be serious consequences-- for all
dialog: of you.
text: IN BG, the PROPHET and HANDLERS head toward a large RV.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You some kinda cop? Where's your
dialog: puppet?
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Needs repairs.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You armed?
text: GREER shakes his head, raises his hands.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Frisk me if you want.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: No, that's OK.
text: With that, he throws a SUCKER PUNCH to the gut. GREER
text: doubles over. He seems amazed at the sensation, the
text: pain. But he recovers, throws a wild punch at Miller an d
text: misses by a foot. [Violence for Greer in human form
text: should have a very different, painfully visceral feel,
dialog: unlike when he was a surrogate.]
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: ADAMS cracks Greer across the back of his head. GREER
text: falls to the ground. BUD kicks him once. GREER chokes
text: and groans in pain.
speaker_heading: MILLER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hurts, doesn't it.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: It's a bitch being real.
text: GREER lets out a primal CRY and lunges at MILLER, driving
text: his head into the man's torso, knocking the wind out of
text: him before the other two can pull Greer back.
speaker_heading: ADAMS
dialog: I think he likes it.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: (catching his breath)
dialog: So give him some more.
text: Outnumbered three to one, Greer takes a beating,
text: continues to throw mostly ineffective punches that just
text: cause the men to redouble their efforts. Finally, he's
text: limp in their arms.
text: Miller plucks Greer's WALLET and BADGE from his pockets,
text: examines them. As he does so, GREER spits BLOOD on the
text: man's face. Miller seems about to whomp him again, but
text: stops himself.
speaker_heading: MILLER (CONT'D)
dialog: Not gonna give you the
dialog: satisfaction.
dialog: (to Bud and Adams)
dialog: Get him out of here.
text: Miller tosses Greer's ID at him, then moves toward the
text: RV, leaving GREER gasping in the clutches of Bud and
text: Adams, lit by the FLAMES from the funeral pyre.
scene_heading: INT. PROPHET'S RV - NIGHT
text: A spartan interior. MILLER enters. THE PROPHET stands
text: with a couple of HANDLERS.
speaker_heading: HANDLER
dialog: Trouble?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Some fed named Greer, he wanted to
dialog: talk to the Prophet.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HANDLER
dialog: About that turkey shoot in DC?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Didn't come up. Said they wanted
text: Strickland's weapon.
speaker_heading: PROPHET
dialog: Well, maybe I'll just have to
dialog: bring it to their doorstep...
dialog: In the Prophet's hand, we now see--
text: --the mysterious DEVICE with which Strickland killed his
dialog: targets.
scene_heading: EXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - NIGHT
text: GREER is half-dragged, half-carried, back the way he
text: came, flanked by BUD and ADAMS. Greer sucks on his
text: BLEEDING lip, works his tongue around in his mouth. He
text: touches parts of his bruised body carefully.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Guy like you oughtn't be out in
dialog: just your skin.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: I'm starting to see your point.
text: AT THE GATE - GREER leaves, trying to muster as much
text: dignity as he can. The DREAD GUARD calls sarcastically
text: after him.
speaker_heading: DREAD GUARD
dialog: Come again real soon!
scene_heading: EXT. BALTIMORE SLUMS - NIGHT
text: GREER trudges along the seedy streets. He looks a mess--
text: torn clothing, bloodstains, bruises. Suddenly he's
text: SHOVED from behind, falls to the pavement.
speaker_heading: WHEELS
dialog: Oops.
text: The assailant is a FREAK SURRIE-- extra ARMS, WHEELS
text: where his feet should be.
text: A moment later, Greer is surrounded by three rich, FREAKY
text: TEENS.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: They've customized their surries in completely bizarre

text: Besides WHEELS, there's a hairless teen with six EYES
text: scattered around his head. A GIRL has SPIKES sticking
text: out of her skull and flesh and REPTILE SKIN.
speaker_heading: EYES
dialog: Watch where you're going, meat.
speaker_heading: SPIKES
dialog: What are you doin' off the rez?
text: She bumps against GREER as he picks himself up, he
text: shrinks from the spikes. She shoots a small blast of
text: FLAME from her nostrils, then GIGGLES.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: I'm not a Dread.
speaker_heading: WHEELS
dialog: Then you oughta return that
dialog: surrie, looks like shit.
text: WHEELS comes at Greer again, Greer moves and TRIPS him--
text: but he just lands on an extra arm and rights himself.
speaker_heading: EYES
dialog: Hey, it wants to play.
text: EYES lowers his head and moves to butt him. GREER
text: dodges, it looks like a bullfight.
speaker_heading: SPIKES
dialog: Ole, toro!
text: They turn, hearing a SCREECH OF TIRES.
text: A LIMOUSINE has pulled up. A 10-year-old BOY climbs from
text: the back and approaches.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Agent Greer. Would you like a ride?
text: The kid's voice sounds like a child's, but with mature
text: cadences to his speech. -
speaker_heading: WHEELS
dialog: Check out Richie Rich.
text: THE DRIVER of the Limo steps out-- it's ARMANDO from
text: Canter's lobby. He lets his jacket fall open, revealing

speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: (re: the freaks)
dialog: So many unforeseen consequences to

dialog: suppose I should apologize.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Who are you?
scene_heading: INT. LIMO -- NIGHT
text: As GREER climbs in, the BOY hands him back his own
text: BUSINESS CARD, the one Greer left with Canter.
speaker_heading: BOY/CANTER
dialog: You left this on my desk.
text: ARMANDO has gotten behind the wheel, starts moving.
text: Greer looks at the boy, amazed.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Canter?
speaker_heading: BOY/CANTER
dialog: It's not safe for me to use my
dialog: usual surrogates. This is one of
dialog: VSI's.newer models. Not that the
dialog: market will be that strong, the
dialog: birthrate being what it is.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: You're having me followed.
speaker_heading: BOY/CANTER

speaker_heading: BOY/CANTER

speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Why not? You stand for everything
dialog: the humanists hate--
speaker_heading: BOY/CANTER
dialog: Then why would his own people
dialog: murder-him?
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: He'd outlived his usefulness.
dialog: With me all over his ass, he was
dialog: becoming a security risk--
speaker_heading: BOY/CANTER
dialog: To kill someone remotely-- it
dialog: would take a virus presumably, one
dialog: that could get past every firewall
dialog: protecting a surrie's circuitry--
text: then once in the CPU, override all
dialog: the fail-safes and cause
dialog: catastrophic brain damage...
speaker_heading: GREER
text: Presumably.
speaker_heading: BOY/CANTER
dialog: We're talking about an
scene_heading: EXTRAORDINARILY SOPHISTICATED

speaker_heading: GREER

speaker_heading: BOY/CANTER

scene_heading: EXT. GREER'S BUILDING - NIGHT

speaker_heading: BOY/CANTER

speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: While you're at it-- I am so sick

text: MAGGIE chuckles. On the coffee table before them sits a
text: small JACKER, like the one we saw in the underground
text: club. The foursome pass a single ELECTRICAL TUBE around,
text: attached by a cord to the device. Andre and Bridget have
text: clearly coupled up, Brian touches Maggie's leg casually
dialog: from time to time.
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: What do you want, we're men.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (coming out of it)
dialog: Why is that? Why do we all have

speaker_heading: BRIAN
speaker_heading: (BEAT)

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Excuse me.

scene_heading: INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/KITCHEN - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: What happened to you? I thought

speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Obviously. You know I don't like

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Somebody beat you up? How could
dialog: you go out like that?
text: As Maggie speaks, she moves to his side, touching his

speaker_heading: GREER
speaker_heading: (NODS GLUMLY)

speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Excuse me.
text: Brian turns, starts to rise. Greer grabs the man and

dialog: hasn't felt a thing.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Tom, the table!
text: Greer steps over the couch calmly and begins PUNCHING and
text: KICKING the surrie on the floor, working off pent-up
text: rage. BRIAN just keeps LAUGHING.
text: Soon Greer's hands are cut and bleeding, he's panting,
text: exhausted. MAGGIE finally succeeds in pulling him away.-

text: STRETCHED and TORN.
speaker_heading: BRIAN

speaker_heading: ANDRE
speaker_heading: (CHUCKLING)

speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Not this one. Maybe it never got
dialog: to you guys in the first place.
dialog: Who makes them?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: It's a DARPA design, subcontracted to

dialog: create a non-lethal weapon that could
dialog: disable every surrie in the field.
dialog: You beam a software virus straight to
text: the CPU. The fail-safes kick in and

speaker_heading: GREER

speaker_heading: MAGGIE

speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Exactly.
text: Nearby, MAGGIE works on a brown-skinned HAND. She stares

speaker_heading: MAGGIE

speaker_heading: BRIDGET

dialog: Because it's bullshit. Because

speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Ow! Easy, I'm only human.

speaker_heading: ARMANDO
dialog: Are you OK?

text: ARMANDO wraps his one good arm around Greer's throat from

text: the gun behind his head and FIRES, blowing a HOLE in
text: Armando's forehead. GREEN COOLANT, FRIED ELECTRONICS fly

text: They topple to the ground together. GREER struggles from

text: the gun's loud report.
text: As Greer gets to his feet, the DOORMAN enters, takes in
text: the tableau-- the gun-wielding man, the two surries on

speaker_heading: STONE (CONT'D)
