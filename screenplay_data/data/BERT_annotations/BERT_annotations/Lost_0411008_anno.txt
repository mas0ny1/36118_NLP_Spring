dialog: “Pilot”
speaker_heading: ACT ONE
scene_heading: OVER BLACKNESS, MUSIC. OMINOUS AND FOREBODING. THEN, OUT OF
text: THE DARKNESS, A SINGLE WORD. FLOATING IN SPACE, OUT OF
text: FOCUS, TOWARD CAMERA. AS IT APPROACHES IT COMES INTO FOCUS,
text: BUT IT'S SHARP ONLY FOR A BRIEF MOMENT:
speaker_heading: LOST
text: AS IT NEARS US IT AGAIN LOSES FOCUS -- AND AS WE MOVE THROUGH
text: THE "O" OUR MUSIC CRESCENDOS, THEN STOPS ABRUPTLY AS WE CUT
dialog: TO:
speaker_heading: A MAN'S EYE
text: EXTREME CLOSEUP. Open wide. The man's skin wet, speckled
text: with soil and flecks of blood. His breathing CLOSELY MIKED --
text: erratic. This man's in shock. The SOUNDS of INSECTS and
text: ANIMALS other-worldly. A blink.
text: Then, the REVERSE ANGLE: staring up hundreds of BAMBOO
text: STALKS. Sunlight almost impenetrable through the dense
dialog: forest.
text: SLIGHTLY WIDER on the Man's face as he stares upward,
text: disoriented, stunned. 40-years-old. Fit. In normal
dialog: circumstances, one glance would make you feel confident in
dialog: him. Trusting. But here, now, he's the one in trauma.
dialog: His name is JACK.
text: Then, a RUSTLING SOUND -- something COMING -- it gets LOUDER
text: and Jack suddenly SNAPS his head to the side to see something
dialog: appear through the thick bamboo foliage --
text: A WHITE LABRADOR.
text: Collar. Tags. It stops abruptly, twenty feet away from
text: Jack, looking at him. And for the first time, we PULL BACK
text: TO A WIDE SHOT of the intense, alien-looking BAMBOO FOREST.
text: The dog just stares at Jack, who we now see wears a BUSINESS
text: SUIT and lies on his back, caught in broken bamboo stalks.
text: And Jack just stares back.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: It's an odd tableau -- man and dog looking at each other,
dialog: both entirely out of place...
text: Finally the Lab turns and huffs back into the jungle,
text: disappearing in the claustrophobic bamboo -- and Jack would
dialog: call out "Wait" if he could even think that clearly and he
text: turns to sit up and it's a PAINFUL MOVE -- he manages to
text: extricate himself from the plants -- and while still on his
text: knees, he opens up his suit jacket to check out the source of
text: his pain. Something on his left side -- but we're so TIGHT
text: on his face that whatever he sees, we don't. Yet.
text: His reaction to his wound is more disappointed than
text: terrified. He manages to get to his feet, feeling something
text: in his jacket pocket. He reaches in... and pulls out a
text: MINIATURE BOTTLE OF VODKA.
text: And we HOLD ON his face as he looks at it... considering...
text: his heart beginning to POUND, his fear growing, as does a
text: SOUND -- a FRIGHTENING, ODD SOUND -- something REVVING in the
text: distance -- SOMETHING LOUD -- and the horror of what he
text: suddenly understands far outweighs any physical pain. He
dialog: moves off --
scene_heading: EXT. BAMBOO FOREST - DAY
text: Jack moves as fast as he can through the THICK BAMBOO -- and
text: as he goes there's something that almost beckons to him -- he
text: hurries through the thick growth, his determined eyes focused
text: on the thing he approaches -- and as he gets closer to it, we
dialog: finally see it:
scene_heading: A WHITE TENNIS SHOE
text: Laces untied, caught mid-fall in a bamboo tree, hanging by a
text: branch, twelve feet above ground. He stops for a moment,
text: looks at it. Again: THE LOUD REVVING -- but it's CLOSER NOW -
dialog: - and suddenly the most important thing in the world is that
text: he get there and fast -- so he's moving now, even faster than
text: before -- through a straight-away miracle path, he's near
text: SPRINTING now -- BREATHING QUICKLY, ERRATICALLY as he makes
dialog: his way --
scene_heading: EXT. BRUSH - DAY
text: -- and now he's running from bamboo into JUNGLE BRUSH --
text: thick still, but there's some more sunlight and he's almost
text: there and finally he bursts out of the brush onto --
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DAY
text: -- and Jack runs up, finally stopping dead in an EXTREME
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: 5
text: He's bathed in SUNLIGHT now -- squinting at what he sees --
text: and we're just on his eyes. HOLD ON HIM, in shock, until he
text: moves forward -- and IN THE SAME SHOT, we PAN AS HE MOVES --
text: 180 DEGREES UNTIL WE'RE BEHIND HIM, LOOKING OUT ON SOMETHING
text: ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC. Only twenty yards away...
text: A PLANE CRASH ON THE BEACH 6
scene_heading: 777 -- PASSENGER AIRLINER -- 250-Seater -- the MIDDLE SECTION
text: of the fuselage PLOWED INTO THE SAND -- one WING STICKING
text: STRAIGHT UP, TOWERING SEVEN STORIES INTO THE SKY, sporadic
text: SPARKS BURSTING FROM THE INVERTED ENGINE, showering down on
dialog: the absolute MAYHEM on the sand --
speaker_heading: ANGLE 7
text: -- and it is like a fucking WARZONE: scattered FIRES and
text: wreckage -- DOZENS OF PEOPLE RUNNING ABOUT, some injured,
dialog: others not -- they're helping each other, SCREAMING -- their
text: cries drowned out by the SOUND and WIND caused by the
dialog: ENORMOUS JET ENGINE -- no, not the one on the wing pointing
text: upward -- the other one -- the one on the INVERTED WING, now
text: cracked off its brackets and resting at SAND LEVEL. And the
scene_heading: ENGINE STILL REVS -- SPASTICALLY, ERRATICALLY -- SPEWING
text: COOLANT and SPARKS and SUCKING IN SAND every time it
scene_heading: THROTTLES UP --
speaker_heading: TIGHT ON JACK 8
text: as he takes this in, overwhelmed -- knowing he's part of it --
text: his eyes WELL UP in fear -- sorrow -- confusion -- and he
dialog: turns to look for help --
speaker_heading: ANGLE 9
text: -- but what he sees... is nothing. His look spans 360
dialog: degrees: there's only spectacular ocean, waves violently
text: CRASHING as far as a half mile from shore -- a distant
text: coastline -- then MOUNTAINS -- jagged, 2000-foot high peeks --
text: a deep valley of JUNGLE -- then his eyes are back on the
dialog: horror of the CRASH --
speaker_heading: ANGLE 10
text: -- where DOZENS OF LIVES are in the balance -- and all at
dialog: once he knows that some -- perhaps most -- will die if he
dialog: doesn't take action -- and so he does --
scene_heading: EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY 11
text: Chaos. Terror. Smoke, fumes, fire -- people desperately

speaker_heading: ANGLE 12
text: And amid the madness, the JET ENGINE MOMENTARILY REVS DOWN --
text: enough to HEAR A MAN'S SCREAM -- Jack turns to the source: a
text: MAN is caught -- STUCK UNDERNEATH two rows of airplane seats
text: -- ten feet to the side of the malfunctioning engine --
text: Jack hurries across the insanity toward the man -- flash-
text: passing pieces of conversation as he runs --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KOREAN MAN MAN #1
dialog: (searching for his wife) -- GET AWAY FROM THE GAS!!!
dialog: -- SUN!!! SUN!!! STAY OVER THERE!!!
speaker_heading: WOMAN #2 MAN #2
text: -- SHE WAS RIGHT HERE! I I NEED SOME HELP! PLEASE--!
dialog: DON'T KNOW!
speaker_heading: ANGLE 13
text: -- Jack races past a pretty 20-year-old girl who we HOLD ON
text: for a moment -- she just stands there, SCREAMING LIKE A
dialog: MOTHERFUCKER. We'll meet her later.
speaker_heading: ANGLE 14
text: Jack gets to the man stuck under the seats -- he's too close
text: to the terrifying, LOUD ENGINE -- which is still so hot that
text: HEAT RIPPLES can be seen behind Jack -- who sweats now as he
text: tries to LIFT THE ROW OF SEATS off the man --
text: With the DEAFENING VOLUME of the jet drowning out any
text: dialogue, we see Jack YELLING for TWO MEN close by (one of
dialog: them is LOCKE, 58, someone else we'll get to know in a bit) --
text: they run over and help -- and the three STRAIN HARD as they
text: lift the chair sections off -- Jack then moves to the man --
text: whose leg BLEEDS SEVERELY.
text: Jack rips off his tie, immediately goes to business the way
dialog: only a man with medical training could: he begins making a
text: TOURNIQUET, tying the injured man's leg off --
speaker_heading: ANGLE 15
text: As he ties the leg, Jack looks up to see a whole mess of
text: simultaneous emergencies -- including a 60-year-old WOMAN in
text: a PEACH BLOUSE, who lies unconscious with a 30-year-old MAN
dialog: desperately trying to revive her --
speaker_heading: WHIP PAN 16
text: across the beach of debris to a PREGNANT WOMAN, on her knees,
text: struggling to stand, but with no one to help --

scene_heading: BEHIND THE MONSTROUS REVVING ENGINE -- 18
text: over to the Australian Pregnant Woman (CLAIRE) -- he helps
text: her up -- helps her walk -- but she stumbles again, strains:
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: -- I'm having contractions--
dialog: Jack helps her lie down--
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: -- that's not ideal... how many months
dialog: pregnant are you--?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (crying)
dialog: -- almost eight months--
speaker_heading: ANGLE 19
text: -- and he glances up, checking on the unconscious 60-year-old
text: Woman in the peach blouse, the 30-year-old Man still trying
text: to revive her -- though his eyes are there, he asks Claire:
speaker_heading: ANGLE 20
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: -- how far apart are they--?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: -- I don't know, a few of ‘em just

speaker_heading: AND WE CUT BACK 21

scene_heading: THE LOUD ENGINE 22
dialog: -- and they're at a safe distance -- that's when ANOTHER MAN,
text: his back to us -- someone we haven't seen -- runs past us,

text: BLAST ~~ AND THE MAN GETS SUCKED INTO THE ENGINE AND JUST AS

dialog: them -- camera ROCKED, Claire SCREAMS, Jack COVERS Claire
text: with his body as debris falls -- LITTERING THE SITE WITH
text: PIECES OF FIERY DEBRIS.
speaker_heading: ANGLE 24
text: At least the HORRIBLE ENGINE NOISE IS GONE now -- and with
text: Jack's horrified face close to Claire's, he forces himself to
text: appear calm -- to his focus on her:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: -- listen to me-- listen to me, you're
dialog: gonna be okay -- do you understand? But
dialog: you need to lie absolutely st--
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (suddenly, winces, scared)
dialog: -- There -- God, that's a big one--
dialog: (looks up, calls out:)
dialog: YoU!
text: The random person who turns is a MAN -- a large guy, more or
text: less frozen in terror -- this is HURLEY.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: COME HERE!
speaker_heading: HURLEY
dialog: -- The -- the plane crashed--
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, I know -- get over here!
dialog: And Hurley does -- in this moment he might just follow anyone
text: anywhere -- Jack rips off his watch, gives it to him:
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D) HURLEY
dialog: -- I need you to get this
dialog: woman away from these fumes!
dialog: Take her over there! -- Then -- okay-- okay--
dialog: stay with her! Don't let her

dialog: minutes apart, call out for
dialog: me! -- you gotta be kidding me --

speaker_heading: HURLEY
dialog: -- Hey, what's your name?!
dialog: And here it is, the first time we've heard it:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Jack!
dialog: 
text: And Hurley turns back to Claire, who says, crying:
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: -- I'm sorry --
text: Hurley quickly begins helping Claire up -- and though
text: terrified, he tries to comfort her --
speaker_heading: HURLEY
dialog: -- Don't be sorry -- this wasn't your
dialog: fault--
speaker_heading: 25 WITH JACK NOW 25
text: -- as he runs to the unconscious 60-year-old Peach Blouse
text: Woman (ROSE) -- immediately taking over for the 30-year-old,
dialog: whose name is BOONE:

dialog: -- stop -- her head's not

scene_heading: ANGLE - JACK AND ROSE 27
text: As he keeps trying CPR on her -- Boone watching --
speaker_heading: BOONE
dialog: -- Hey man, she's still not breathing!
dialog: (then)
dialog: Maybe we need to do one of those hole
dialog: things -- where you stick a pen in her
dialog: throat?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (just get the fuck outta here)
dialog: -- Yeah, good idea -- you go get me a
dialog: pen!
text: And Boone hurries off -- Jack, just relieved to be rid of
text: him, goes back to Rose -- trying to bring her back -- when
text: suddenly: WREEEEEEEEEEORRRRRR!!! -- a LOUD METALLIC WHINE
dialog: which makes Jack TURN AROUND to look --
dialog: Dear God, it's --
speaker_heading: THE FUCKING WING 28
scene_heading: -- THE 75-FOOT WING POINTING TOWARD GOD -- IT'S ACTUALLY
text: BENDING AT THE FUSELAGE WHERE IT'S CRACKED -- IT'S STOPPED
text: FOR THE MOMENT, BUT IT'S CLEAR: THIS THING IS MOMENTS AWAY
text: FROM CRASHING DOWN UPON THE SAND -- WHIP PAN down to the sand
text: -- WHERE HURLEY AND CLAIRE REST ON THE SAND, oblivious -- and
text: in the direct path of the enormous metallic WING FULL OF FUEL
scene_heading: -- HORRIFIED --
text: JACK WORKS ON THE WOMAN FASTER NOW 29
speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: 32 ANGLE 32
text: Seeing this, Jack's already RUNNING NOW as the WING BENDS
text: AGAIN -- CRACKS MORE -- and as Jack runs he yells out:
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: MOVE! MOVE!
text: Hurley turns -- sees Jack approach -- Hurley's confused:
speaker_heading: HURLEY
dialog: You -- you said don't move!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: GO, GET HER UP!!! NOW!!!
scene_heading: 33 HURLEY TURNS -— SEES THE WING ~~ WEEEEEEEEEEEEORRRRRRR! !! 33
dialog: 
text: HURLEY SCREAMS AS THE WING STARTS TO GO -- a LONG LENS SHOT
text: as JACK ARRIVES -- GRABS THEM, PULLS THEM TO THEIR FEET AND
text: RUSHES THEM AWAY AS THE WING FALLS RIGHT BEHIND THEM LIKE A
scene_heading: TIPPING REDWOOD TREE --
text: 34 -- AND THE WING SMASHES TO THE GROUND 34
text: LANDING ON pieces of FIERY ENGINE DEBRIS and KA-BOOQOOOOM! !!
scene_heading: THE WING EXPLODES -- AN ENORMOUS BLAST -- pieces of FIERY

scene_heading: 36 EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY 36
text: Now we're LONG LENS as Jack walks through the wreckage scene
text: -- amid smoldering piles of debris, and People helping each
text: other. Things seem to finally be calming down.

dialog: 10.
scene_heading: JACK SCANS THE AREA 37
dialog: looking to make sure there's nothing that needs an urgent
text: response. He finds one MAN, 45 in a suit, who lies on the
text: ground, unconscious. BLEEDING BADLY from the head. Jack
text: pulls open the Man's jacket -- TO REVEAL A PIECE OF METAL
text: SHRAPNEL STUCK INTO HIS STOMACH.
text: Seeing this, Jack's eyes go flush with concern. He checks
text: SHRAPNEL MAN's pulse -- pulls open his eyelids. Jack
text: delicately removes the man's jacket, drapes it over him,
text: forming a makeshift BLANKET. Jack turns to the ripped-open
text: end of the fuselage -- where first class and the cockpit
dialog: would normally be --
scene_heading: INT. FUSELAGE - DAY 38
text: INSIDE the fuselage, looking out, the tumultuous OCEAN framed
text: by this giant shattered aluminum tube. It's a disorienting
text: shot, since the plane is BANKED ON ITS SIDE. At this angle,
text: SEATS are on a SIDE WALL, the wreckage-strewn floor actually
text: a long row of windows.
text: And Jack appears, looking into the fuselage -- and we PUSH IN
text: ON HIM. What Jack sees -- despite his ER training -- sickens
text: him. Then Boone arrives, urgent, holding a HANDFUL OF PENS.
speaker_heading: BOONE
dialog: -- I didn't know which one would work best.
text: For a long beat, Jack's eyes don't leave the fuselage.
text: Finally he looks at Boone. And the pens. And tears well in
text: Jack's eyes -- the whole experience finally catching up to
text: him. Jack takes all of the pens, saying, softly,
dialog: emotionally, kindly:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: ...They're all good. Thanks...
text: And Jack walks off, past Boone, who turns, watching Jack go.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DAY 39
text: A fifty-yard distance from the wreckage, a fellow survivor
text: stands here, staring almost angrily at the wrecked plane.
text: He's 35, handsome, with a cocky, self-centered vibe. And
dialog: he's smoking. Meet SAWYER.
text: A few others recover about here -- including another Man, who
dialog: approaches. 25. English rocker. Self-deprecating --
text: somewhere between an adult and a child. This is CHARLIE.
dialog: These two have never spoken.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: 39
speaker_heading: CHARLIE SAWYER
dialog: -- You, uh... s'cuse me, ya
dialog: sure you should be smoking--? -- You sure you want me to
dialog: shove my foot up your ass?
dialog: A beat.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay. Excellent, just... thought I'd
dialog: raise it.
text: Charlie walks off. A beat later, he returns --
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: -- Mind if I... bum one then? Thanks...
text: Charlie takes a cig from tough Sawyer, then walks off.
scene_heading: EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY 40
text: MUSIC: Synthesizer DRONE. A surreal post-disaster moment.
text: LONG LENS SHOT as Jack, for the first time appearing
text: vulnerable -- perhaps even weak -- near the jet's open CARGO
text: DOOR. He rummages through a stranger's SUITCASE... other
text: bags he's already searched beside it. As he ZIPS open
dialog: someone's TOILETRY BAG --
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH WOODS - DAY 41
text: A cluster of trees off the beach. The SHATTERED JET barely
text: visible in the distance. Jack walks in here, getting away
dialog: from the others.
text: TIGHT SHOTS as he sets down, on a large rock, a TRAVEL SEWING
text: KIT. A LIGHTER. A T-shirt.
text: And in some pain, Jack pulls off his jacket -- revealing an
text: enormous BLOOD STAIN and RIP on the side of his shirt. He
text: carefully removes his shirt. Looks down at the LARGE SLASH --
text: A DEEP SIX INCH CUT STARTING ON HIS LEFT SIDE AND RUNNING TO
speaker_heading: HIS BACK.
dialog: Christ, he did all that with this crash wound.
text: He twists, trying to figure out how best to sew himself up.
text: He angles around -- can't find a good way to approach this.
text: And we watch him for a long beat, feeling for Jack as he
text: tries to solve this painful puzzle. Frustrated but needing
text: help, Jack looks around -- we pop to a TIGHT SHOT as he sees
text: something off-camera. Something that makes him stop...
text: +. and we see his point of view: walking, slowly, seemingly
text: aimless through the brush, is a WOMAN.

text: She's thirty feet away, her back to us. Jack watches her for
text: a moment. Then he calls out:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Excuse me!
text: And this woman turns. Her face pale, ghostly. Wracked in
text: stress. Eyes wet. This is KATE. Pretty, 26 years-old.
dialog: Smart. Trustworthy. And, in all the important ways,
text: entirely untested.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: D'y'ever use a needle?
text: And Kate just stares at him for a moment, disoriented.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: ...d-- what?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Have you ever patched up a pair of jeans?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (beat, about to cry)
dialog: I... I made the drapes in my apartment
dialog: 
dialog: --?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That's fantastic -- d'you have a second?
dialog: I need a little help.
text: Kate takes a post-traumatic-stress-disorder beat, then moves
text: forward, through the trees. She arrives at Jack.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: ..-Help with what?
text: And Jack turns, SHOWING HER THE WOUND.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: This.
text: And her eyes just close.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd do it myself -- I'ma doctor -- but I
dialog: just can't reach it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (eyes closed)
dialog: You want me to sew that up.

dialog: thing-- machine on the drapes --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You can do this, I'm telling you. If you
dialog: wouldn't mind.
text: A beat. Finally Kate snaps into agreement: she'll do it.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: -- Thank you --
text: And Jack pulls from his pocket the mini bottle of VODKA.
text: Holds it out to her, as if offering a drink. Odd. Then:
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: It's for your hands.
text: Understanding now, she takes the vodka, cleans her hands with
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Save some for me.
dialog: (off her look; smiles)
dialog: The wound.
text: She nods, gives back the half empty bottle as he gives her
dialog: the needle and thread:
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: You're gonna have to sterilize the
dialog: needle.
text: She takes the stuff, using the lighter to heat the needle.
text: Jack sits on the rock, sucks in a sharp intake of breath as
text: he pours the remaining vodka over his wound -- it fucking
speaker_heading: STINGS --
text: Kate's finished with the needle -- considers the SIX COLORS
text: OF THREAD in the travel sewing kit.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Any, uh... color preference?
text: Jack looks at her -- there it was, the first flash of her
dialog: personality.
speaker_heading: JACK

text: Kate nods, trying to stay cool, pulling out a length of black
text: thread and threads the needle. Kate then kneels beside him --
text: and after a beat she starts to sew his skin. Then:
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So I might throw up on you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (it hurts, but:)
dialog: You're doing fine.
text: He watches her, this pretty young woman he doesn't know,
text: stitching him back together again, trying to keep her
text: composure. CLOSE ON her hands. No jewelry, no watch.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: You live in New York?
dialog: God, she just wants to lose it. But she doesn't.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: ++. I used to. I've been in New Zealand.
dialog: About a year.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: ...How come?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh, I just... had to get away --
text: -- And suddenly Kate is crying. It just caught up to her,
text: that's all. And she weeps, resting her head on the back of
text: her hand. Jack suddenly feels guilty, watching this kind
text: stranger weep. So he speaks, quietly, sweetly:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: ..-Hey... hey, listen, I can get someone
dialog: else to do this--
speaker_heading: KATE

dialog: (beat)
dialog: At the end of it -- thirteen hours later

text: Kate has stopped sewing, now staring at him.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
text: It's at the base of the spine, where all
text: the nerves come together. Membrane as
dialog: thin as tissue. So it ripped open -- the
text: nerves just spilled out like angel hair
text: pasta-- her spinal fluid flowing out and
dialog: I just... froze. 'Cause I knew. If I
dialog: didn't get those nerves back in that sack
dialog: and sew it up... those thirteen hours
dialog: were for nothing, that girl would be
dialog: paralyzed. I had about a minute.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And all the assistants were just watching
dialog: me, I could feel their eyes. And the
dialog: terror was so... crazy, so real... and I
dialog: knew I had to deal with it. So I just
dialog: made a choice. I'd let the fear in. Let
dialog: it take over. Let it do its thing.
dialog: (looks at Kate)
dialog: But only for five seconds. That's all I
dialog: was gonna give it. So I started to count
dialog: to five. I could feel it inside -- like
dialog: when you drink a milkshake on a hot day.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: One, two, three, four, five.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And it was gone. I got back to work.

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Why.
speaker_heading: JACK

scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 89
text: Kate is exactly where we left her, tucked amongst the roots
text: of the alien tree. Rain pouring down around her. Dark in
text: here. She's scared to death. We're with her. CLOSE.
text: And she hears a SOUND over the rain -- something moving
text: towards her -- and she turns around -- looking behind her
text: now, petrified.
text: Nothing there. Her eyes wide, blinking in the rain. Nothing
dialog: but jungle.
text: She then turns back -- AND CHARLIE IS STANDING RIGHT THERE --
dialog: 
text: and it scares her so much she SCREAMS AND GRABS HIM --
text: PUSHING -- AND THEY FALL OVER onto his back, her lying on top

dialog: -- Did you see it?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No. No. But it was right behind us. We
dialog: were dead -- I was. Until Jack came back
dialog: for me.
text: And just then, something remarkable happens. The rain stops.
text: As abruptly as it started, it's gone. They both look back
text: the way they came -- Kate looking up, Charlie, still on his
text: back, craning his head.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: We have to go back for him.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Go back? There? Love -- listen --

scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE - MOMENTS LATER 90
text: DOLLY OUT OF THE THICK FOLIAGE to find Kate and Charlie,
text: walking slowly through the dripping-wet jungle, back the way
dialog: they came. They're edgy... and we're moving with them. The
text: DRIPPING SOUNDS somehow unnerving.
text: Then Kate sees something up ahead. Something GLISTENING in
text: the mud -- and she moves for it, Charlie behind her.
text: And she gets to it -- kneels -- it's a scattered collection
text: of COINS. And among them, something she picks up.
text: A PILOT'S WINGS PIN.
text: And Kate stares at the pin, horrified... because she senses
text: what's coming next. She SLOWLY LOOKS UP. And sees something
text: horrific. Charlie looks up too. His mouth opens in shock.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: ..-What the hell's that...?
dialog: Then, a welcome voice:
speaker_heading: JACK (0.S.)
dialog: It's the pilot.
text: And they turn around -- grateful to see Jack approaching from

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: -- Did you see it?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No. It was right behind me, I dove into

dialog: Is that your boyfriend?

text: At the surf line, Jin, our Korean HUSBAND, his pants rolled

text: in a PLASTIC BAG he's taken from the plane. It's an oddly
text: serene image.
dialog: And then we have a REVERSE VIEW -- from the ocean inland --
text: and Sun, Jin's wife, sits on the sand. Sitting, straight
text: backed, rather stoic. Watching her husband. The TOP BUTTON
text: of her blouse undone.
text: Then we're TIGHT on Sun's face as she watches him, his back
text: to her... and though there's no dialogue here, there doesn't

speaker_heading: SUN
speaker_heading: (in KOREAN)
dialog: My apologies... but I do not speak
dialog: English.
text: And Michael stands there for a moment, confused. And Michael
text: looks up and sees that, mid-reach into the sea, Jin has
text: stopped working, looking back at her wife and this strange
dialog: man. Which should tell us immediately how controlling Jin
text: really is. Then, Jin calls out:

speaker_heading: SAWYER
dialog: Does anyone understand what the hell he's
dialog: talking about?
speaker_heading: SAYID
dialog: It's a running count. Of the number of

speaker_heading: SAWYER

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What? What is it?
text: The voice gets fainter and fainter. Shannon brings the

speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: "Please help... I'm alone now... on the
