scene_heading: INT. BARGE - DAY
text: Crewman EPPS (29), wearing a life vest and tool belt, jumps
text: down into the darkness. She stands in a great hollow cavern,
text: oily, wet, resonant with the sound of creaking, rusty steel
text: and WATER MOVING OVER ITS HULL on the other side.
scene_heading: INT. BARGE - LATER - DAY
text: Epps comes to a low point in the darkness, shining her light
text: on a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead. She
text: kneels. As the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking
text: in through the seams in the steel plate of the hull.
scene_heading: EXT. BARGE - LATER - DAY
text: Epps pulls herself onto the deck from below. She stands on a
text: rusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean
text: by a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable.
text: It is a typical summer day in the southern Bering Sea, which
text: means a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north-
text: west. She closes the hatch behind her and makes her way
dialog: forward.
scene_heading: EXT. BARGE - BOW - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Up ahead, the tug pulls steadily, grey-black clouds of diesel
text: smoke rising from its massive turbine vents.
text: Epps cinches and checks her body harness, focused and
text: professional. The product of a rocky childhood in the Pacific
text: Northwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her
text: true calling now. And under some grime, several polypro shirts
text: and a pair of orange men's Insulite pants she might even be
dialog: considered pretty.
text: She clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches
text: to a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow. She climbs onto
text: the cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the
text: bow beneath her. She pulls herself forward on a roller bearing
text: that fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward
text: the tug at the other end.
scene_heading: EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - DAY
text: DODGE and GREER look on from the stern, where the boat's
text: name "Arctic Warrior" is emblazoned on the transom. Dodge
text: (37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy
text: coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate
text: Texan and former merchant marine. GREER (42), is the boat's
text: first mate, African American, originally from some sweltering
text: red-neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the
dialog: north.
text: They watch as Epps pulls herself toward them, the cable
text: occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a
text: passing swell slackens it. Epps pulls herself to the stern
text: where the cable winds into a tow anchor.
speaker_heading: EPPS
text: It's a slow leak.
text: She unclips and drops to the deck.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: What's slow?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Where from?
speaker_heading: EPPS
text: Amidships starboard at the beam.
dialog: Just under the waterline. I don't
dialog: think it's a problem.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think
dialog: it's a problem.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: The view from the pilothouse commands 360 degrees as radar
text: and GPS navigation displays glow. MURPHY, the ship's master,
text: pilots the boat. He is 48, at sea all his adult life, and
text: most of the rest, a fact written on his face and one that
dialog: every crewman who's ever worked for him has been willing to
text: bet his life on. A walkie-talkie CRACKLES AWAKE.
speaker_heading: GREER (V.O. RADIO)
dialog: Greer to Murphy.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (lifting the radio)
dialog: Go.
text: Murphy turns back to see Greer, Epps, and Dodge looking up
text: at him from the stern.
speaker_heading: GREER
text: The number nine on the starboard
dialog: side's half flooded. Epps says it's
text: a slow leak just under the waterline,
dialog: about twenty gallons an hour. They
dialog: must've pumped it before we left
dialog: Sitka.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Of course they did.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Let the buyer beware.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: What do you say, Dodge?
speaker_heading: DODGE (V.O. RADIO)
dialog: (taking the radio)
dialog: If it started out at twenty an hour
dialog: the piece of shit'd be at the bottom
dialog: of the Gulf by now. Whether it'll
dialog: make St. Lawrence is anybody's guess.
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY
text: HIGH AND WIDE as the Arctic Warrior pulls the barge against
text: the swell of a grey ocean and a darkening sky.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PORT GERMAINE - ST. LAWRENCE ISLAND - DAY
text: The shores of St. Lawrence Island open into a small port
text: town of mainly pre-fab buildings as the Arctic Warrior
text: approaches with the barge, now pathetically listing to one
text: side as it moves into the harbor.
scene_heading: EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - LATER - DAY
text: A smaller harbor tug helps the Arctic Warrior jockey the
text: listing barge to the dock as Epps and Dodge jump off to tie
dialog: her up.
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Greer feathers the tug into position and shuts down the
dialog: turbines.
scene_heading: EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Murphy jumps down from the pilothouse to the deck as a fat
text: Russian man, Vasili (60) and a MECHANIC in grease-covered
text: orange coveralls approach from the dock.
speaker_heading: VASILI
dialog: I thought you say Tuesday.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Better late than never.
speaker_heading: VASILI
dialog: (seeing the listing
dialog: barge)
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: You got a leak in the number nine
dialog: compartment.
speaker_heading: VASILI
dialog: No, no. You got leak.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: You pump it out and re-seam the hull,
dialog: she'll be good as new.
speaker_heading: VASILI
dialog: That cost me twenty grand at least.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
text: Fifteen, at the most.
speaker_heading: VASILI
dialog: Twenty. You knock off twenty and
text: then we see. After my guy looks at
dialog: it.
scene_heading: INT. VASILI'S OFFICE - DAY
text: In a prefab office with a view of the shipyard, Vasili cuts
text: a check as Murphy and Greer look on. He tears it out of the
text: book, handing it across the desk to Murphy, who inspects it.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: You're kidding, right?
speaker_heading: VASILI
dialog: You want fair pay, make hamburger
dialog: for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to
dialog: sign.
text: Vasili pushes a transfer register toward him. Murphy signs.
scene_heading: EXT. SHIPYARD - DAY
text: Greer and Murphy walk back toward the dock.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Not bad for dragging a leaky tub
dialog: half way to Russia.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: He'll sell the scrap for three times
dialog: what he paid.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: I must be in the wrong business.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: You got that right.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: (imitating Vasili)
dialog: Better than "making hamburger for
dialog: Mickey D."
scene_heading: INT. BAR - NIGHT
text: A typical port town bar. Except this one is on an island in
text: the middle of the Bering Sea. Epps lines up a shot at the
text: pool table as a couple of SEAMEN check out her ass and a
text: tattoo of Wiley Coyote poking out of her pants. Greer reads
text: a paper near-by.
text: Murphy enters, crossing to the bar where Dodge nurses a beer
text: and a cigarette. Murphy throws down an envelope with Dodge's
text: name on it. Dodge picks it up, thumbs through a thick stack
dialog: of hundreds.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Much obliged, skipper.
scene_heading: INT. BAR - LATER - NIGHT
text: The place is a little more crowded now as Epps pushes her
text: way through to the bar, a cigarette dangling from her mouth.
text: She buys two beers and pays the BARTENDER from her envelope
text: of cash. She takes the beers back to the far wall where a
text: young off-duty COASTGUARDSMAN stands. He takes one, they
dialog: laugh.
speaker_heading: AT A TABLE
text: Beers, cigarettes and pay envelopes on the table before them,
text: Dodge, Greer and Murphy look on at Epps across the room, who
text: is showing the coastguardsman a birthmark on her neck.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Looks like Epps' gonna get some
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: With that coxswain dickhead.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps?
dialog: Gimme a break.
text: Greer and Murphy trade looks as Dodge raises his beer.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: What a laugh.
text: A MINOR COMMOTION can be heard as they sit there.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: I'll show you, bitch!
text: They look over to see the coastguardsman's GIRLFRIEND, late
text: 20s, hefty in a red miniskirt and big hair.
speaker_heading: GIRLFRIEND
dialog: You want to mess with me, I'll kick
dialog: your bitch ass, girl.
speaker_heading: WITH EPPS
text: Epps coolly puts out her cigarette as a circle has gathered
text: around her and the girlfriend, anxious to see a girl fight.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about. I just bought this guy a beer.
speaker_heading: GIRLFRIEND
dialog: This "guy" is my man, honey.
speaker_heading: COASTGUARDSMAN
dialog: Darlene --
speaker_heading: GIRLFRIEND
dialog: You, shut up.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: (starting off)
dialog: Listen, I don't want any trouble,
dialog: okay -- ?
speaker_heading: GIRLFRIEND
dialog: (stopping Epps)
dialog: Uh-uh. No. We're gonna fix this right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (stepping up)
dialog: What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
speaker_heading: RIVETER
dialog: Whyn't you mind your own business,
dialog: chief.
text: Murphy turns to see a shipyard RIVETER, a big man holding a
text: beer, still wearing his welding leathers. Murphy turns back
dialog: to Epps and the Girlfriend.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: As I said, what seems to be the
dialog: trouble?
speaker_heading: RIVETER
dialog: Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you
dialog: got your hearing aid turned down?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: I heard you. But I'm choosing to
dialog: ignore you. Epps, let's go.
text: Epps starts forward but the Riveter stands in her way, taking
text: Murphy by the collar.
speaker_heading: RIVETER
dialog: These ladies was having themselves a
dialog: discussion and you're interrupting
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: You got about two seconds to get
dialog: your paws off me, Tarzan.
speaker_heading: RIVETER
dialog: Or what?
text: Or WHACK! Murphy can't help but wince as a pool cue breaks
text: in two over the Riveter's head.
text: Dodge, cigarette in his mouth, takes a look at the cue half
text: he still holds, shaking his head.
text: The Riveter's hands fall from Murphy's collar and his legs
text: buckle. Some of his BUDDIES hold him up as Greer reminds
text: some of the others he's holding a pool cue of his own.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Epps?
text: He looks to Epps like let's get the hell out of here. She
text: grabs her coat.
speaker_heading: COASTGUARDSMAN
dialog: Wait.
text: Epps holds there as the Coastguardsman steps up to his
dialog: girlfriend.
speaker_heading: COASTGUARDSMAN
text: Darlene. It's over.
text: He gives her the ring from his finger. Murphy rolls his eyes
text: as the others look on.
speaker_heading: COASTGUARDSMAN
dialog: I don't love you anymore.
text: Darlene breaks into tears as they all look on, some pat her
text: on the back.
speaker_heading: COASTGUARDSMAN
dialog: (to Epps)
dialog: Come on, Candy. Let's get out of
dialog: here.
text: The Coastguardsman takes her by the hand. Epps looks to Murphy
text: and the others as he leads her out.
scene_heading: EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY
text: Murphy, Greer, and Dodge ready the tug to leave as Epps
text: approaches on the dock. She jumps down onto the deck, a spring
text: in her step and a song in her heart.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Morning everybody.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Show your tatoos to that coxswain
dialog: last night, did you Epps?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Showed him a hell of a lot more than
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: I bet you did.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Candy?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: It's my pen name.
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY
text: Murphy throttles up the turbines and backs the tug away from
text: the dock as Greer studies the dawn sky.
speaker_heading: GREER
text: Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Red sky in morning, sailor take
dialog: warning.
scene_heading: EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: As the tug turns into the harbor channel, the sun rising
text: under a cloud bank of brilliant red and orange.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT
text: Dodge and Epps play cards at the galley table.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Fuck it.
text: He puts down his hand. Epps takes another drag from her
text: cigarette, collecting her winnings.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: One more?
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Why not.
text: She gathers the cards, shuffles.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: What is your first name?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: It just occurred to me I don't know
dialog: your first name. All this time and I
dialog: don't know it.
text: She deals the cards in silence.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: (finally)
dialog: Maureen.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Maureen.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Maureen?
text: She looks on at him as he holds there, takes his cards.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: What's yours?
text: Dodge takes a drag from his cigarette, thinking about it.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Roger.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Roger?
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Yeah.
text: She wants to laugh, but only studies her cards.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: You think that's funny
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: (lying)
dialog: No.
text: She takes a hit from her cigarette as she plays her hand.
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN OCEAN - BERING SEA - NIGHT
text: THE SONG "SOS" BY ABBA BLASTS as the tug plows westward
text: through a steady chop and a mild swell.
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. Greer has the CD player cranked
text: as he mans the helm in the glow of the pilothouse. He checks
text: the radar, holds there a beat. He turns the MUSIC DOWN and
text: picks up a walkie-talkie.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: (into walkie)
dialog: Greer to Murphy.
text: Greer studies the radar display as he waits.
speaker_heading: MURPHY (V.O. RADIO)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GREER
text: There's a large vessel out about ten
text: miles to the north-west.
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTER'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: Murphy sits at his desk over the ship's log, holding his
dialog: radio.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: I been watching it for close to an
dialog: hour and it hasn't moved. I can't
dialog: raise it on the radio either. Makes
dialog: me think it might be in trouble.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Alright. I'll be right up.
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - LATER - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the sweep-refresh reveals a bright
text: point of light in the middle of nowhere.
speaker_heading: MURPHY (O.S.)
dialog: Merchant vessel at position one seven
dialog: four one five west, five seven seven
dialog: five north.
text: Murphy holds the radio mic as Greer looks on, Epps and Dodge
text: standing back.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: This is tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey
dialog: alpha sierra bravo four zero niner
dialog: two. Over.
text: Only the quiet hiss of white noise comes back from the radio
text: speaker as the bright point flashes on the radar screen.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (to radio)
dialog: Merchant vessel at one seven four
dialog: one five west, five seven seven five
dialog: north, this is tugboat Arctic Warrior
dialog: whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero
dialog: niner two. Over.
text: Again, only white noise comes back as the point flashes on
text: the screen.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
text: Too deep to anchor out there.
speaker_heading: GREER
text: Looks like it's adrift.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Could be a fishing boat.
speaker_heading: GREER
text: Too big. More like a freighter.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: What the hell would a freighter be
dialog: doing up here? It's way out of the
dialog: lanes. There's not a port for 800
dialog: miles.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Smugglers maybe.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Smuggling what? Tundra grass?
text: A beat as Murphy holds there. He raises the radio mic.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Merchant vessel at position one seven
dialog: four one five west, five seven seven
dialog: five north, this is tugboat Arctic
dialog: Warrior. Do you copy? Over.
text: Again, only the quiet hiss of static comes back.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Call the Coastguard?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Steer to one eight five. Let's check
dialog: her out.
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN OCEAN - NIGHT
text: The Arctic Warrior cuts a foamy break in the ink black water.
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the phantom point flashes closer.
text: Murphy looks on as Greer pilots, Dodge and Epps watching.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Alright. Back it off.
text: Greer throttles back and the boat slows.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
text: Hit the lights.
scene_heading: EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: The halogen flood lights flare to life, brilliantly
text: illuminating the water in front of the boat.
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: The four of them look intently into the darkness beyond the
text: light. Murphy reaches for the spot control, sweeping a broad
text: beam of light with a joy stick.
scene_heading: EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: As the tug moves along, servo motors sweep the searchlight
text: over the bow of the boat and into the darkness.
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: They peer into the night beyond the boat as it slowly moves,
text: when a shadow looms into view.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Whoa, whoa.
text: Greer throttles down all the way and they drift, as the shadow
text: looms bigger before them in the light from the boat.
text: As they approach, the shadow appears to be a giant rusting
text: bow, rising up from the water, disappearing in the darkness
text: above them. Murphy sweeps the searchlight to reveal more of
text: what appears to be a large, darkened ship. As they come
text: around, the name "CHIMERA" can be seen above the anchor
text: alleys.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: "Chimera."
text: Murphy reaches for the mic, hits the LOUD HAILER.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Chimera.
scene_heading: EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: The tug is dwarfed by the massive rusting hulk of the Chimera
text: rising above it.
speaker_heading: MURPHY (O.S. LOUD HAILER)
dialog: This is civilian tugboat Arctic
dialog: Warrior. Is there anyone aboard?
text: The quiet rumble of the tug's turbines is the only sound.
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: Murphy raises the mic again.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Chimera, I am hove to at your port
dialog: bow. Is there anyone aboard?
text: They wait, looking on at the silent, darkened ship under the
text: glare of their lights.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Epps, come with me. You guys sit
dialog: tight.
scene_heading: EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - NIGHT
text: Epps and Murphy, in heavy parkas, climb a hydraulic deck
text: crane up to the Chimera as Dodge man's the controls against
text: the movement of the water.
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: Greer holds the tug steady as Epps and Murphy can be seen
text: making their way up under the floodlights.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
text: Murphy pulls himself up and jumps down onto the deck. Epps
text: jumps down behind him. Murphy throws his light up on the
text: superstructure. All remnants of paint have been rusted over,
text: lending a still darker ominousness to it.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
text: Murphy and Epps move cautiously along, shining their lights
text: as they go. Despite the omnipresent corrosion, everything
text: seems to be in order. The decks are clear and there is no
text: apparent damage. They come to a hatchway. Epps shines her
text: light down the darkened passage. Murphy moves in.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: Murphy and Epps move down the passageway. Even the walls in
text: here are rusted. They come to a flight of stairs.
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: Greer and Dodge wait. Greer reaches for his radio.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: Talk to me, skipper.
text: After a moment, Murphy comes back on the radio.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
text: We're in a stairwell just under the
text: main superstructure.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: Murphy and Epps climb the darkened stairway.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: This is definitely an old boat, maybe
text: sixty years old. She hasn't been in
dialog: service for at least twenty years.
dialog: Probably a lot longer.
text: They top the stairs and walk into a wider passageway which
text: takes them into an open area. Their lights shine around them,
text: revealing sinks and counters and racks of old kitchen
text: equipment, a few pots still hanging.
text: They move through the galley and into another, narrower,
text: passageway.
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: Greer and Dodge look on.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: It's funny.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: How's that?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Besides a little rust, everything's
dialog: pretty well-preserved.
text: Greer and Dodge look at each other.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: How she got out here is one hell of
dialog: a good question.
dialog: (a long beat, then)
dialog: Jesus.
text: Dodge and Greer hold there, waiting. Only silence from the
dialog: other end.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: What is it?
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Murphy.
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Murphy, goddamit.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (finally)
dialog: Sorry.
text: Another beat in silence.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: What is it?
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: Murphy and Epps stand at the top of a stairway, looking over
text: an immense ballroom. Murphy raises his radio.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: It's a passenger ship. It's a damn
text: passenger ship.
text: Though it is dark, there is enough light to see its ornate
text: opulence, tables and chairs in place near a large dance floor
text: and orchestra well, and a magnificent crystal chandelier
text: hanging over it all.
scene_heading: EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FOREDECK - NIGHT
text: Epps and Murphy climb down the deck crane as Greer and Dodge
text: meet them at the bottom.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (jumping down)
dialog: There's nobody on that boat.
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT
text: Dodge, Epps, Greer and Murphy sit around the galley table.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Probably slipped her moorings, got
text: tangled up in a current.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Out here? What, so a seven hundred
text: foot passenger liner drifted out of
dialog: Spokane harbor and nobody managed to
dialog: bump into her until now?
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Somebody's probably looking for her
dialog: as we speak.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Whatever the reason, she's adrift
dialog: and abandoned. We've got every right
dialog: to salvage her.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: You mean tow her back? That's a thirty
dialog: thousand ton ship you're talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: We've done it before.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Yeah, from one side of the harbor to
dialog: the other. But we got half the Bering
dialog: Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to
text: drag her over.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: You have any idea how much a ship
dialog: like that could be worth in salvage?
dialog: The fittings alone could go for a
dialog: few million.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: If you get it back in one piece.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: It's a risk I'm willing to take.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: All we got to do is hit some rough
dialog: weather and you can forget about it.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: So we cut her loose and wait it out.
dialog: A little weather couldn't be anything
text: she hasn't seen before.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: It's a bloody navigation hazard.
dialog: One boat can't control a ship that
dialog: size.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: The damn thing's been floating around
dialog: for God knows how long and it hasn't
dialog: hit anything yet. So we take it easy.
text: A little of the old push pull.
text: A long beat as they hold there.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Listen. Forget this job's just a pay
dialog: check for a minute. You know I've
dialog: been good to you. But I'm prepared
dialog: to offer you something better now.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: If we do this right, it's worth a
dialog: lot of money. A lot of money.
text: They hold there looking on at him, waiting.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Salvage fees on a vessel like this
dialog: could come in around four million
dialog: bucks. At least. Who knows, could be
dialog: more. Could be a lot more.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: What I'm proposing is... we split it
dialog: four ways.
text: A beat. Dodge looks to Epps and Greer.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Think about it. A million bucks a
dialog: piece.

speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Bring it on, dude.
text: Dodge disappears from the hole and his hand comes back with

speaker_heading: EPPS

speaker_heading: DODGE

speaker_heading: MURPHY

speaker_heading: DODGE

speaker_heading: MURPHY

speaker_heading: DODGE

scene_heading: EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Hard to say. I gotta get in there

dialog: What'd you find up there?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
text: Some charts. A crew manifest.
dialog: (looking them over)
dialog: Looks like her last voyage was January

dialog: she been since.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: She was sailing up north, right?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Well, suppose she got a little further
dialog: north than she should have. Got
text: stuck in the ice. The passengers and
text: crew evacuated. She froze into the
text: ice pack, which moved further north,
text: where it froze in solid. They write
dialog: it off. Fifty years later, the whole
dialog: global warming thing happens. The
text: ice melts, she gets loose and floats
text: around til somebody runs into her.
text: Murphy nods, considering it.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: As reasonable an explanation as any,
dialog: I guess.
text: Epps takes a sip of her coffee as she thinks about it.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
text: She was a two-masted brig boat sailing
dialog: out of New York in 1872. One day
text: she was sighted off the coast of
dialog: Portugal by a merchant vessel, the
text: Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei
dialog: Gratia got closer, they discovered
dialog: that no one was at the helm of the
text: Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found
text: her completely deserted. The captain,
dialog: his wife, their daughter, and the
text: entire crew, all gone. The last entry
dialog: in their log made no mention of any
text: trouble. The table was even set for
dialog: dinner. And in the nine days after
dialog: the last entry, she sailed 700 miles
text: without anyone aboard.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: So what did happen?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Nobody knows. There've been a lot of
dialog: theories, of course. But we'll never
dialog: really know for sure.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: You think she's sailing without a
dialog: crew?
text: Murphy looks out at the Chimera off the bow.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: I think we'd be surprised where a

speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: You're more practical than
dialog: superstitious.
speaker_heading: MURPHY

speaker_heading: DODGE
text: Turbine rotor's shot.
speaker_heading: MURPHY

speaker_heading: DODGE

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: How much longer's that gonna take?
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Like I always say --
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: I know I know, two ways to do anything --
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: The right way and the wrong way.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: But how long?
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Hard to say.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A

speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: I'm telling you, you don't want to

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: What about running number two by

speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: It's a full 2500 horses down. We

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: How long, then?
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: I gotta pull the blades and re-seat

speaker_heading: MURPHY

speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Three, four days.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Goddamit, Dodge.

text: doll, holding a beat. She approaches, crossing the room,
text: coming finally to a stop before us and what we come to see
text: is an ancient grandfather clock.
text: All but it's minute hand has fallen off its corroded face,
text: but from inside it emits a weak though steady TICKING.
text: Epps stands there as the clock ticks, looking on, when the
text: TICKING CEASES. A beat as she holds there, as the clock faces
text: her, now silent.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY
text: Epps shines her light in the darkness as she comes to a door
text: where daylight falls from a small port. She looks through
dialog: it.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Epps stands in a white tiled room. Light falls from port
text: holes high in the wall. Running its length is a small swimming
text: pool, it's rusted fixtures and stained surface creating
dialog: bizarre patterns.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Epps comes to a row of changing stalls. Old clothing hangs
text: there, unused for fifty years. A pair of woman's shoes lie
text: on the floor.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - LATER - DAY
text: Epps moves along, passing through a doorway into
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Epps enters another room scattered with old exercise equipment
text: circa 1950, a wooden rowing machine, barbells and a medicine
dialog: ball.
text: She steps up to the wall, where pictures hang. The Chimera
text: can be seen in better days, sailing full speed on a calm
dialog: sea.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - LATER - DAY
text: Epps jumps down to a lower deck. She shines her light up to
text: see that she is in an engine compartment, showing a massive
text: diesel burner. She passes through into another compartment
text: where the giant pistons of the ship's power plant rise up to
dialog: the ceiling.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - PASSAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Epps moves, passing still more diesel burners, towering over
text: her in the cavernous space. She moves into a narrowing
text: passage, piping and machinery ducts winding their way into
text: the depths of the ship.
text: Finally the passage opens into yet another compartment,
text: apparently a cargo hold. Crates and boxes are stacked on
text: loading palettes.
text: In the corner, a rotting canvas drape covers something. Epps
text: comes to it. She lifts the canvas, which crumbles away to
text: reveal a 1951 Ferrari sportster. For the exception of a coat
text: of dust and a small amount of corrosion, it is perfectly
dialog: preserved.
text: Mail bags lie in piles along the wall, stacked between more
text: wooden crates and palettes, when something catches Epps'
dialog: eye.
text: A heavy, metal door in the wall is twisted on it's hinges,
text: as though blown back from some terrific explosive force.
text: Epps approaches, coming to the twisted door. She shines her
text: light inside.
text: A clutter of debris, shelving and wood, are visible in the
text: shadows, when her light catches a glint of something. She
text: swings her light back, revealing a yellowish bright object
text: between broken wood slats.
text: Epps steps in. She kneels, shining the light closer. The
text: yellow glint is metal. Epps pulls back a slat, sliding away
text: some of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram
dialog: ingot of gold.
text: She reaches out. She raises it, completely untouched by the
text: years. She pulls back still more debris, revealing a stack
text: of gold ingots, some having tumbled to the side. She slides
text: away a large trunk that has fallen, pushing off more junk to
text: see that the stack is much larger, perhaps four feet high
text: and five feet across.
text: A beat as Epps stands there, looking on at $50,000,000 in
dialog: gold.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - DAY
text: The debris has been cleared away to reveal a clean 5'x 5' x
text: 4' stack of gold ingots.
speaker_heading: DODGE (O.S.)
dialog: What the fuck we gonna do with it?
text: Greer, Murphy, Epps, and Dodge all look on.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: What the fuck you think we gonna do
dialog: with it? It's ours, baby. It's all
dialog: ours.
text: Murphy has stepped forward, taking an ingot, inspecting it.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: How much you figure that's worth,
dialog: skipper?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (still looking it
dialog: over)
dialog: Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty
dialog: million.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Ho, baby!
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: That's a lot of money for somebody
dialog: to just let float away.
text: Murphy looks up at her from the gold.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Yes, it is.
text: A beat as they all hold there.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: It's a hell of a lot of money.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: What, you think there's something
dialog: funny about it?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: A ship with fifty million dollars in
dialog: gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems
dialog: to care enough to come looking for
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: If they thought it was lost at sea,
dialog: they probably just wrote it off.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
text: Not for fifty million. An ocean liner
dialog: maybe. But fifty million in gold,
dialog: they come looking for.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Maybe they didn't want it back.
dialog: Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Maybe. But there's always somebody
dialog: whose interest's at stake.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: All I gotta say is it looks like
dialog: that somebody's us right now.
text: Greer cackles as he high fives Dodge.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: And it looks like somebody got here
dialog: before us too.
text: The steel hatch is twisted, as from a great hand ripping it
text: back from the wall.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: (inspecting it)
dialog: Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell
dialog: you that. Torn parts rusted bad as
text: the rest of the boat.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Then it happened before they scuttled
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: You mean, before she sank.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Cargo like this could make a crew
dialog: think twice.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: That it could.
text: A beat, as they all look on at the gold.
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT
text: After dinner, Murphy, Greer, Dodge and Epps sit around the
text: galley table.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Then why didn't they take it.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Probably didn't have time.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Or somebody stopped them.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Either way, they must've had a pretty
dialog: good reason.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Must be a damn good reason to jump
dialog: ship and leave fifty million dollars
dialog: aboard.
text: A beat as they consider it.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: So what're we gonna do. That's the
dialog: big question, right?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
text: A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's
dialog: as valid as a claim to the vessel
dialog: itself. It's ours.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy
text: stinking rich.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
text: It looks like it.
text: A beat as they let this sink in.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: So what? We gonna unload the gold
dialog: and get a move on?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: We leave it where it is. Stick to
dialog: the plan.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: You gotta be kidding? What the hell
dialog: we need that tub for, we got fifty
dialog: million bucks?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: So we get a little more for the boat.
dialog: Besides, the gold'll be safer where
dialog: it is.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Yeah, but we still gotta haul that
dialog: big piece of shit all the way back
dialog: to Sitka.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: It's worth the effort. Believe me.
dialog: Besides we're gonna need her to prove
dialog: the salvage.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Why not call for help?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: For now the best thing we can do is
dialog: to keep quiet about this.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Last thing we want is extra partners.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Or uninvited guests.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: I heard that.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: The sooner we get under way, the
dialog: sooner we are to spending what's
dialog: ours.

speaker_heading: GREER

scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - PASSAGEWAY - DAY
text: Murphy moves down the darkened passage, coming to a door
text: marked "CAPTAIN." The door is ajar. He pushes it open.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Murphy stands in the doorway of a spacious cabin panelled in
text: dark wood. A large desk occupies a corner of the room by the
text: windows. Though dirty and worn with time, everything is
dialog: ordered and in its place.
text: Murphy comes to the desk. He sits down in the chair behind
text: it. The surface is clear and uncluttered. He pulls out the
text: drawer to reveal pens, writing paper, a ruler, compass and
text: protractor amidst other sundry items.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER -
speaker_heading: DAY
text: Murphy steps in. The room is undisturbed, light falling in
text: on the taught green bedspread through dirty, tattered
text: curtains. A robe hangs on the back of a chair. A pair of
text: slippers lie beneath it.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER -
speaker_heading: DAY
text: Murphy stands in the bathroom. The tile has yellowed with
text: time, but everything is exactly as it was left. Even the
text: shaving kit is neatly arrayed on the sink as Murphy looks on
text: at it. He looks up, seeing himself in the mirror, when an
scene_heading: EXPLOSION SOUNDS.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Murphy comes to the railing, looking out over the bow of the
text: ship to see black smoke rising from where the Arctic Warrior
dialog: is tied.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Greer and Epps run to the side to see billowing smoke rising
text: from the Arctic Warrior as Murphy climbs down the crane to
dialog: the deck.
scene_heading: EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Murphy jumps down to the deck. Flames belch from an open
text: hatch as Murphy grabs a fire extinguisher from a deck locker,
text: coming to the engine room door.
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Murphy enters to find the engine room engulfed in flames and
text: black smoke. He finds Dodge spraying at it with an
text: extinguisher of his own.
text: The flames belch up from an oil fire in the turbine well,
text: the heat searing paint on the metal covers. Murphy sprays a
text: cloud of halon and the fire dims, but only for a moment.
text: Dodge grabs another extinguisher, his leg burned, face and
text: hands singed.
text: An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE BOAT and molten flames hurl through
text: the air, catching Murphy's pant leg. He's so engrossed in
text: fighting the flames, he doesn't realize he's on fire.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: (over the roar)
dialog: Murphy!
text: Murphy looks down to see his pant leg is on fire, as Dodge
text: turns a cloud of halon on him, putting it out.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Propane tanks're gonna go!
text: Murphy crosses in the smoke, coming as close as he dares to
text: the most intense part of the flames. He turns the extinguisher
text: into them, holding it there.
text: The flames dim, as Dodge joins him on the other side, turning
text: his extinguisher on it too. The fire seems to dim yet again
text: as clouds of halon rise up.
text: Fire belches from a duct, crawling across the ceiling. Dodge
text: fires his extinguisher at it, pushing it back across to the
text: wall again.
text: Murphy extinguishes the last of the flames in the turbine
text: well as Dodge brings a snaking tendril of fire down to the
text: deck, and finally out.
text: They stand there in the sudden silence, the air heavy with
text: smoke. A fine layer of halon powder lies over everything,
text: but the fire is out.
scene_heading: EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY
text: Dodge smokes a cigarette, now starting to feel his burned
text: leg, which is oozing as Murphy and Greer look on.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: One minute I'm minding my own
dialog: business, the next thing I know the
text: whole place is burning up.
dialog: (taking a drag)
text: An oxygen tank must've blown on the
text: welder. Started an oil fire.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Looks like it took out the backup
dialog: genny too.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Terrific.
text: Epps arrives with a first aid kit.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: How's that leg?
text: Epps cuts back the burned pant leg to see the burn.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Seen better -- Ow!
text: Epps cleans the burn with hydrogen peroxide.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: This's gonna hurt a little.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
text: Epps keeps cleaning as Dodge bears it.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: What now?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: We could call for help.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: And get a bunch of fools sniffin'
dialog: around here?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: What other choices have we got?
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: I tell you one thing, we're not gonna

scene_heading: EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

text: The DISTANT SHRIEKING IS LOUDER HERE, BUT SEEMS TO BE

speaker_heading: EPPS
text: It's coming from inside.

speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: That shit is seriously bizarre.
text: The DISTANT SHRIEKING ECHO continues as they hold there.
scene_heading: EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY
text: The engine room is black with soot, the turbines covered in
text: halon powder. Dodge stands there looking at it. He sighs.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY
text: Greer goes through shelves of supplies, finding a stack of
text: sterno cans and warming candles. He throws them into a wooden

scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - FIRST CLASS STATEROOM - DAY
text: Epps slowly pushes open the door. She holds a sack with a
text: few items she's managed to scavenge. Light falls from
text: curtained windows onto the room. A divan sits against the
text: wall. A table stands in the middle of the room, a moth-eaten
text: velvet table cloth sitting under a brass lamp on top. Two
text: twin beds stand on either side. They are covered in dust and
text: are moth-eaten, unmade, as if the occupants had just gotten
dialog: up, fifty years ago.
text: In one corner is an armoire. Epps steps up to it, pulling

text: there undisturbed.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: A pair of slippers lie on the floor beside a chair, over

scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: A drawer comes back to reveal a number of personal affects,
text: a man's billfold, cuff links, tarnished silver cigarette
text: holder and case, coins, black horn-rimmed glasses, pocket
text: watch and fob, and a room key.
text: Epps pulls back the billfold. She opens it. Inside she finds
text: a Canadian passport a picture of a dark-haired man with a
text: mustache and black horn-rimmed glasses, circa 1950. In the

scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - "A" DECK PASSAGE - LATER - DAY
text: Epps steps from the room. She turns to close the door, but
text: stops, holding there, strongly sensing something.
text: THE CAMERA SLOWLY COMES AROUND TO HER OTHER SIDE, revealing
text: the long passageway behind her, each bulkhead hatchway
text: creating the impression of a tunnel of mirrors that frame
text: one another and, standing at the very end of this tunnel in
text: the foggy light from a porthole, a MAN in dark clothing.
text: Epps slowly turns her head to see what she already senses,
text: the man standing at the end of the passageway facing her. A

text: then turns to walk away.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Hey!
text: Epps moves off as the man walks around the corner.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Hey, wait a minute! Hey!
text: MOVING WITH Epps as she breaks into a run, going down the

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: EPPS

speaker_heading: MURPHY

speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: There's somebody else on this boat.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: What? What the hell're you talking

speaker_heading: EPPS

speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: What'd he look like?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get

speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Where's his boat, then? Where's his
dialog: crew? He ain't gonna be out here by

dialog: we'd never know it.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Maybe that is his boat.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Gimme a break.

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: If somebody's aboard her already,
dialog: she ain't ours. She's theirs.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam

dialog: ours.
speaker_heading: MURPHY

speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: So, we find this guy and make a deal

speaker_heading: MURPHY

speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a

dialog: way out here by himself anyway?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: And what do you propose? That we

speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Why not? Why the fuck not?

speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Fifty million dollars. Fifty million.
dialog: We gonna let this guy just take it

speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: So we kill him?
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: I'm saying we gotta do whatever we
dialog: gotta do to preserve our interest.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Let's just take it easy here, alright?
dialog: Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
speaker_heading: GREER

speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
speaker_heading: EPPS
text: Maybe he isn't alone.
dialog: They consider this a moment.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: I say we off-load some of that gold
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Would you hold on just a minute here,
dialog: please? Look, there's no reason to
dialog: panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine.
dialog: It's a big boat. Chances're real
dialog: good he doesn't even know about the
dialog: gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be
dialog: the wiser.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: The gold stays where it is til we're
dialog: ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a
dialog: hell of a lot safer there than here.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: What if that fucker finds it before
dialog: we're ready to go?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight
dialog: off. Low man first.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Guess that'd be me. Again.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't
dialog: care if you don't sleep for a week.
dialog: The sooner you're done, the sooner
dialog: we can get out of here. How's the
dialog: food situation?
speaker_heading: GREER
text: Pretty low all around.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: We'll have to take it easy then. I

speaker_heading: EPPS

speaker_heading: MURPHY

dialog: (pocketing it in her
dialog: coat)
dialog: You're a pal.
text: She checks the squelch on her radio, pockets it too.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Got your light?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Smokes?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Oh yeah.
text: Her bravado does little to hide her apprehension as she slings
text: the shotgun on her back.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: See you boys later.
dialog: (to Greer)
dialog: Don't be late, I need my beauty rest.
text: She looks up, climbs onto the crane and up toward the darkened
text: ship above them.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
text: A flashlight beam cuts through the darkness as Epps
text: approaches. If this place is creepy in the daylight, it is
text: terrifying now. She comes to a ladder and climbs down.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT
text: Epps shines her light as she passes through, coming to the
text: cargo hold. She crosses in the darkness, her light catching
text: the tarnished glint of the gold. She comes up to it, stopping
text: there, looking on at it, a perfectly symmetrical fortune.
text: She looks around for a place to sit. She drags a palette to
text: the bulkhead, settling in to face the rest of the compartment.
text: She puts her shotgun down beside her and takes out her thermos
text: to pour herself a cup of coffee.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT
text: Epps has dozed off when a CLATTERING ECHOES DISTANTLY
text: somewhere in the ship. Epps wakes. It is silent, as she holds
text: there, not sure she heard anything, when a DISTANT BOOMING
text: SOUNDS. She reaches out for the shotgun, intently listening.
text: As Epps holds there, another deep BOOMING sounds distantly
text: somewhere. Epps turns, her blood running cold.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
text: Epps moves along in the darkness when the DISTANT BOOMING
text: CAN BE HEARD BRIEFLY AGAIN. She stops, holding there, in the
dialog: silence.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - SHAFT ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
text: Epps jumps down into the shaft alley where the ship's massive
text: propeller shaft hangs suspended above her. Epps moves along.
text: Finally she comes out into...
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: Where the propeller shaft extends into a large turbine. She
text: continues on, past huge rusting diesel burners, disappearing
text: into the darkness above her, when ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS.
text: She turns, shinning her light back from where she came.
text: Nothing moves. Not a sound, but for her breathing and maybe
text: her heart pounding in her chest. ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS, again
text: echoing distantly in the silence. She shines her light through
text: the line of burners. Nothing moves.
text: Epps moves quietly between the burners. She comes to a massive
text: watertight door at the bulkhead. She steps through, finding
text: herself standing between a row of huge oil storage tanks.
text: THE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping.
text: She moves on, cautiously walking between the tanks, holding
text: her light out before her. She comes to the end of the
text: compartment and another bulkhead. The BOOMING SOUNDS, still
text: closer. She turns the light into the recesses, showing rusting
text: machinery and a stack of oil drums.
text: She approaches, holding the shotgun up. As she nears, the
text: BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN. She stops. It is coming from here.
text: She tenses, raising the shotgun, holding the light as steady
text: as she can manage. The BOOMING SOUNDS YET AGAIN. It is
text: metallic and staccato.
text: She stops in the corner beside an oil drum. Several drums
text: have toppled and lie scattered in a pile when a draft stirs
text: her hair. She shines her light up to see that she stands at
text: the bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way
text: through the ship to the top deck and an echoey breeze that
text: betrays a throughway to the outside.
text: The BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, this time coming from the pile of
text: oil drums. She steps closer, raising the shotgun, ready to
text: fire. A beat as she summons her courage, then reaches out to
text: push a drum with her foot, when A BLUR EXPLODES OUT AT HER.
text: She fires the shotgun and a spray of buckshot glances off
text: the steel bulkhead in a shower of sparks, a flurry of frenetic
text: flapping whizzing by her head as she looks up to see a large
text: albatross flying back up the hatchway shaft toward the top
dialog: of the ship and freedom.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Murphy to Epps.
text: She settles back, exhausted.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Murphy to Epps.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: (taking her radio)
dialog: Epps.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: You just shoot at something?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid
dialog: bird.
text: She wipes her brow on her sleeve, holding there a moment,
dialog: when she smells something really awful.
text: She steps forward, following the smell, pushing aside the
text: toppled oil drums to see an unidentifiable form in the beam
text: of her flashlight. She steps still closer, training her light
text: on the form to see that it is a human torso. A large gash
text: runs up its middle and the clothing has been torn by
text: scavenging birds.
text: She hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on
text: something. She starts, then shines the light on the deck in
text: front of her where the body's decaying head looks back with
text: wide, unseeing eyes.
text: It takes everything she has just to hold there. She shines
text: her light back to the headless torso.
text: She shines her light beyond that, and up, to reveal a bent
text: steam pipe hanging out over the deck, stained with dried
text: blood, a pair of legs dangling from the pipe when, just behind
text: her, a booted foot comes into frame, lightly touching her.
text: She spins around to see another body above her. Except this
text: one hangs in one piece, suspended from another bent steam
text: pipe. It has been impaled length-wise on the pipe from rectum
dialog: to mouth.
text: One of its arms has rotted off and lies on the deck below
text: it. A few feet away, a third body hangs impaled from another
text: bent pipe.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - LATER - NIGHT
text: A lantern illuminates the impaled bodies and their various
dialog: rotting parts.
speaker_heading: GREER (O.S.)
dialog: Ho-ly shit.
speaker_heading: MURPHY (O.S.)
dialog: Couldn't have happened much more
dialog: than a month ago.
text: Greer, Dodge, and Epps look on as Murphy kneels over the
text: remains of the headless torso.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Bodies're too fresh.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Fresh ain't the first word that comes
dialog: to mind.
text: Murphy checks the pockets, finding a wallet. He looks through
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Greek citizen. Merchant navy.
dialog: (standing)
dialog: Obviously we aren't the first to
dialog: come across this ship. They probably
dialog: stumbled across it just like we did.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: And look what happened.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Damn barbaric is what it is.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Could be meant as a warning.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Stay away. Or else.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Because of the gold.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: That'd be my guess.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: So whoever did this might still be
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Maybe Epps's mystery man had something
dialog: to do with it.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Maybe.
text: A beat as they consider the implications of this.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: So, what? We report this? Call the
dialog: Coastguard?
text: Another beat as they hold there.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Let's not be too hasty.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Yeah. Hell, what difference does it
dialog: make if we report it now or later?
dialog: We call this in now, gonna be
dialog: Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all
text: over the place.
dialog: A beat as nobody's too sure about this.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Dodge, if this isn't incentive enough
dialog: to fix that boat, I don't know what
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY
text: Dodge fires up a compressor, which feebly comes to life,
text: turning over the turbine, then sputtering out in a cloud of
dialog: smoke.
speaker_heading: DODGE
text: All the seals and gaskets're shot.
dialog: Anything that was rubber burned up.
text: Murphy stands at the doorway, looking on.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Can't you use something else?
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: I might be able to find something on
dialog: the ship. But it's gonna take time.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Do what you need to do. Just do it
dialog: fast.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Right.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - CREW QUARTERS - DAY
text: Epps sleeps in her bunk.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - BETWEEN DECKS - DAY
text: Dodge and Greer climb down in the darkness.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: I need lag bolts, especially one
dialog: inch standard. And sheet metal.
dialog: Preferably steel, about a sixteenth
dialog: of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: I ain't no mechanic, just so you
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: You find anything that even looks
dialog: like a compressor. I don't care what,
dialog: grab it.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Murphy stands in the cramped room, full of radios and
text: communications equipment. He looks through the shelves and
text: cabinets, when he opens a drawer to find a dusty bound book.
text: He pulls it back, opening it to see that it is a radio call
text: log. He takes a seat, paging through it.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - WITH GREER - LATER - DAY
text: Greer works to disassemble a compressor mechanism. He has
dialog: difficulty getting the right purchase with his wrench, when
text: he slips.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Dammit!
text: A beat as he inspects his hand. In the silence A DISTANT
text: SHRIEK SOUNDS, maybe metal against metal or maybe human,
text: somewhere in the ship. He holds there, listening.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Dodge?
text: He moves on, shinning his light as he goes.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Greer moves along in the darkness when he hears THE SHRIEKING
text: AGAIN coming from somewhere in the ship.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Dodge!
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Greer walks up a stairway, stepping into a darkened
text: passageway. The SHRIEKING SOUNDS, THIS TIME CLOSER, as it
text: echoes through the ship. He stops, holding there to listen.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Greer comes out onto another deck, stopping there. He looks
text: down the passageway a beat, then moves on. He passes through
text: a hatchway in a bulkhead when A MUSIC BOX CAN BE DISTANTLY
text: HEARD. He stops. The song is "DAISY" ("Daisy, Daisy, give me
dialog: your answer do. I'm half crazy, oh for the love of you.").
text: He holds there, listening intently. A door stands open at
text: the other end of the passage. The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. He
text: moves forward, walking toward the end of the passage, and
text: the light falling from the open door.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Murphy pages forward to the last page of the radio call log
dialog: book.
text: On the page his finger runs down the columns of entries,
text: coming to "TRANSMISSION 1 Feb 53 21:34 hrs GMT. Engine trouble
dialog: notification made to passing vessel 'St. Charles.'"
text: His finger moves down to the next entry, coming to:
scene_heading: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 09:52 hrs GMT. Dead in Water.
dialog: Notification made to passing vessel 'Normandy.'"
text: His finger continues: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 14:07 hrs GMT.
text: Captain relieved of command. Notification made to passing
dialog: vessel 'China Sea.'"
speaker_heading: MURPHY
text: Captain relieved of command.
text: He holds there a moment, moving his finger down to the final
scene_heading: entry, reading: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 21:24 hrs GMT. General
dialog: SOS."
text: He turns the page to see only the words "GOD SAVE US" scrawled
text: in faded red ink. A beat as he holds there, when a CHANNEL
text: OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST ON MURPHY'S RADIO. He looks to it,
text: but there is no response from the other end. Another SHORT
text: BURST AND THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN. This time it remains open,
text: but no one says anything on the other end, UNTIL THE CHANNEL
speaker_heading: CLOSES AGAIN.
text: Murphy takes the radio.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: This is Murphy. Anybody trying to
dialog: call me? Over.
text: He waits as no response comes, then THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN.
text: Only silence from the other end as someone seems to be there,
text: but is not saying anything. Murphy presses the talk button.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Greer? Dodge?
text: Again, there is no response, until the CHANNEL OPENS. Murphy
text: holds there as he is answered by silence, WHEN A GRAVELLY,
scene_heading: STRANGELY DISTORTED MALE VOICE COMES BACK ON THE RADIO:
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O. RADIO)
text: "Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster
dialog: to the crow. "Where are you now? I
dialog: know, but won't say so."
text: Murphy is momentarily stunned. He hits the talk button.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Who is this?
text: The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS. Only silence comes back, as if
text: someone were there but not speaking.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Who is this!!
text: The CAMERA PUSHES IN AS MURPHY LISTENS.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle
dialog: toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle
dialog: toy.
text: The CHANNEL CLOSES as the CAMERA STOPS CLOSE ON MURPHY.
text: Murphy squeezes the talk button.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Greer! Dodge!
text: Only silence comes back from the radio when A MAN'S BLOOD
text: CURDLING SCREAM sounds from somewhere in the ship.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Murphy moves quickly down the passageway when his radio
dialog: sounds.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Dodge to Murphy.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (taking radio)
dialog: Murphy.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: You better get down here quick,
dialog: skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: I think you better see this for
dialog: yourself.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Murphy comes down the stairs and into the passageway we saw
text: Greer in earlier. At the end, the light from the cabin falls
text: from the open door as he approaches.
speaker_heading: AT CABIN 400
text: As Murphy comes to the door to see Dodge standing in the
text: middle of the cabin.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: I found him like this.
text: Greer is lying supine on the floor. His legs are rigid and
text: his trunk is extended. His arms are flexed and twisted so
text: that the palms are facing away, fingers splayed, wrists
text: quaking over his chest as they fight to touch each other.
text: Murphy kneels beside him. Greer's eyelids are half closed,
text: his eyes rolled up into his head. His jaw is clenched, face
text: contorted in a bizarre grimace. And he speaks, uttering
text: nonsense words in harsh expulsions, as though speaking in
dialog: tongues.

scene_heading: AN EYE - EXTREMELY CLOSE
text: As a light shines in it, the pupil is fixed and dilated.
speaker_heading: EPPS (O.S.)
dialog: Hard to say.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Greer lies unconscious on a bunk, now quiet, no longer seizing
text: as Epps shines a flashlight into his eye, Dodge and Murphy
text: looking on. She turns it off, standing upright.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a
dialog: coma.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: I don't know what else you'd call
text: it. He's breathing on his own, but
text: his pupils are completely blown out.
text: He's totally unresponsive to pain.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: What happened up there?
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: I heard a scream. When I got there I
text: found him on the floor. He was having
dialog: some kind of seizure. I didn't see
dialog: anybody else.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: He must've seen something.
text: A beat as they consider this.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Other than the obvious, there's
dialog: nothing wrong with him that I can
dialog: see, not on the outside.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Then what the hell happened to him?
text: Another beat as they hold there.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Just before I heard him yell there
dialog: was somebody on the radio.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Greer?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: I don't know. No. Not Greer.
dialog: Somebody.
text: Another long beat as they think about this.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
text: It was a man's voice. Repeating some
dialog: sort of children's rhyme. I don't
dialog: know, it didn't make any sense. You
dialog: didn't hear it?
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Not me.
text: Another beat as this sinks in.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: (looking to Greer)
dialog: He needs a doctor.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many
dialog: signal flares you can scrounge up.
dialog: (to Epps, meaning
dialog: Dodge)
dialog: Keep an eye on him.
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: How's he doing?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Same. Any luck?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: No. I'll try again later.
text: A beat as they look on at Greer.
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT
text: Murphy and Epps sit at the galley table. Epps reads the log
text: book Murphy found in the radio room.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: (reading it)
text: They're dead in the water that
text: morning. Four hours later the
text: captain's relieved of his command.
dialog: And that evening they issue a general
dialog: SOS.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Possibly false. Hence the IMA record
dialog: of being lost at sea. I don't think
dialog: mutiny's out of the question here.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: (taking a seat)
dialog: On a passenger ship in 1953?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: If they knew what they were carrying.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: You're saying they mutinied for the
dialog: gold?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: If they were close enough to shore,
dialog: they probably figured they could get
text: away in the lifeboats.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Only something must've gone wrong.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Yeah, way wrong.
text: A beat as they consider it.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: So. I got a question. Just from a,
dialog: you know, purely technical standpoint.
dialog: We call the Coastguard. Coastguard
dialog: shows up. What exactly is the plan?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: How do you mean?
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Well, they're gonna be asking a lot
dialog: of questions. About us. About those
dialog: bodies. About the gold. Seems like
dialog: we oughta be prepared is all.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: I guess the best strategy's just to
dialog: tell them the truth.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Yeah, well. The truth is one thing.
dialog: When there's more than a few hundred
dialog: million dollars involved, that's a
dialog: whole new deal.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: What do you propose?
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: For starters, getting that gold off
dialog: the ship. What they don't know about
dialog: isn't gonna bother them.
text: A beat as Murphy holds there.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: There's no way we're gonna hide a
dialog: few thousand pounds of gold from the
dialog: Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be
dialog: safer where it is.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: With all due respect, skipper.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Part of that up there's mine. I'd
dialog: kinda like to have a little say in
dialog: what happens to it.
text: A beat as Murphy looks on.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Tell you what, Dodge. Once we get
dialog: back to shore, you can do whatever
dialog: you want with your share. But until
dialog: then, the gold stays right where it
dialog: is.
text: Dodge holds there. He looks to Epps a beat, takes a drink of

scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Dodge works on one of the turbines when he is grabbed from

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Just what the hell do you think you're
dialog: doing?!
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: I think you know.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Maybe you can tell me then.
text: Murphy shoves him hard into the wall.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: The radio!
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: (not having a clue)
dialog: The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
text: Murphy tightens his grip.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Take it easy, willya? What about the

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: You smashed it!
speaker_heading: DODGE

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Don't lie to me!
speaker_heading: DODGE

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: You didn't want us calling anybody.
dialog: Too liable to ruin your big payday.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: I didn't touch the fucking radio.

speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: I didn't touch the fucking radio!

dialog: Ever occur to you there's somebody
dialog: else on that boat, skipper?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Conveniently enough for you.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?
text: Murphy holds there a beat longer. He shoves Dodge back letting
dialog: him go.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Jesus.
text: Dodge checks his throat as Murphy looks on.
speaker_heading: EPPS (O.S.)
dialog: Murphy.
text: They turn to see Epps in the hatchway.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: It's Greer.
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Greer stands at the galley sink finishing off the last of a

dialog: see them.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Never been more thirsty in my life.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Drink up then.
text: Greer smiles, raising the jug to drink as the others take a
text: seat, looking on at him.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: How're you feeling?
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Lost my sea legs.
speaker_heading: EPPS

speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: I don't know. Tuesday?
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Wrong. It's Friday.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Try Wednesday.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Right. Wednesday.
text: A beat as they all hold there. Greer takes a seat.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: You don't remember?
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Last thing I remember I was aboard
text: the Chimera. Down somewhere in there
text: scavenging around.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: You've been out for about a day.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Say what?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Dodge found you out cold in one of

speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Oh, man.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: We heard you scream. Any idea what
dialog: you might've seen?
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: I wish I could tell you. I'd be real
dialog: interested to know myself.
text: Another beat as they hold there, as Greer takes another drink
dialog: of water.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: The ah... the radio's out.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Somebody took it out of commission

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Smashed it up pretty bad.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: But, who -- ?
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: The skipper seems to think I did it.
dialog: That I'm more interested in that
dialog: gold than my own safety or the safety
dialog: of my fellow shipmates.
text: A beat as they hold there, as Murphy looks back.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Did you?
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
text: Another beat as they hold there.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Regardless of how it happened, there
dialog: isn't much of a chance to fix it.
dialog: The odds of another vessel in range
text: of the walkie-talkies are almost
dialog: astronomical. So, as of today, we're
dialog: pretty much on our own out here.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - DAY
text: Epps and Murphy, carrying the shotgun, make their way in the
dialog: ship.
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FIRST MATE'S QUARTERS - DAY
text: Greer stops before a mirror to see himself. He finds an
text: aspirin bottle, goes to open it. And as he does so, he sees
text: that his hand is shaking uncontrollably.
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY
text: Dodge works over the turbine. He stops, holding there. He
text: looks on at the plugs and wires and hoses. A beat.
text: He begins pulling out the hoses and wires, grabbing at them,
text: yanking them loose, breaking them off.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - DAY
text: The chassis comes off an old radio to reveal a dusty
text: assortment of tubes and condensers. Murphy looks on at it.
speaker_heading: WITH EPPS
text: A tattered, bound book lies in the refuse of a forgotten
text: corner. Epps picks it up. The cover has been ripped off and
text: the pages are torn. But, as she looks through it, she sees
text: that it is the ship's log.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Murphy.
text: Murphy steps over as she pages through the log book to the
text: very end. The last pages have been ripped out.
speaker_heading: EPPS
text: Looks like part of the general log.
text: Epps points to a page that has been incompletely ripped out.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: "The crew have gone mad with greed
dialog: and fight among themselves like wild
dialog: dogs over fresh kill."
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: February first.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: The same day she supposedly went
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Must not've been the captain's entry.
dialog: He was probably out of the picture
dialog: by then.
text: Epps continues to read.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: "Their lacking diligence has
dialog: undoubtedly caused the collision.
dialog: Distress calls have been made."
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Collision? With what?
speaker_heading: EPPS
text: The page's missing. Then their SOS
dialog: was real.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: But where's the damage?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Maybe the other ship took the worst
dialog: of it.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: If it was a ship she hit.
text: A beat as they hold there, when his radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Dodge to Murphy!
text: Murphy reaches down for his radio.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (to radio)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: You better get down here right now!
dialog: We're taking water! Big time!
scene_heading: EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY
text: Murphy and Epps jump from the deck crane as the tug is
text: starting to list to one side. He crosses to the deck house
text: and the open engine room hatch to see that it is rapidly
text: filling with seawater as Greer and Dodge scramble to set a
text: pump hose over the DIN OF THE PUMPS.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: What the hell happened!
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Turbine chamber on number two must've
dialog: blown! Took out part of the hull!
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: We're not gonna be able to pump it!
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Alright. Everybody grab your gear!
dialog: This' is where we get off!
scene_heading: EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: The tug is listing radically to the side, its deck awash
text: with seawater, as Epps, Greer, and Murphy scramble with their
text: gear to the crane.
text: Water is starting to pour out of the deckhouse hatch as the
text: towering framework rising over the pilothouse stabs
text: precariously at the bow of the Chimera.
text: Murphy stops to shout back at the deckhouse.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Dodge!
scene_heading: INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Water is starting to pour in as the entire cabin lurches to
text: one side. Dodge wades through toward the door.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Epps pulls herself up onto the deck, Greer following behind,
dialog: then Murphy.
text: Dodge can be seen stepping from the deckhouse on the tug,
text: which now lists at a near 45 degree angle.
speaker_heading: WITH DODGE
text: Dodge stumbles toward the bow, slipping on the wet deck. He
text: goes down, sliding into the water that washes over the
text: starboard rail.
text: He pulls himself up, using a cleat to push off. A deck locker
text: opens and the contents tumble around him. He struggles to
text: pull himself up to the base of the pilothouse. He climbs up
text: and edges his way toward the bow.
scene_heading: WITH THE OTHERS
text: Epps, Greer and Murphy look on as Dodge climbs up on the
text: skewed deck crane.
speaker_heading: WITH DODGE
text: The tug is slowly lurching over as Dodge climbs the crane,
text: the top of which is sweeping away from the Chimera.
text: Below, the decks of the tug are swept with seawater as it
text: sinks lower and lower.
scene_heading: WITH THE OTHERS
text: They look on as Dodge climbs toward them, the sinking tug
text: pulling Dodge and the crane away from the ship.
text: Greer pulls back a line, tying it into the deck railing.
speaker_heading: WITH DODGE
text: As Dodge makes his way up, he's forced to climb onto the
text: other side of the crane to keep from dangling over the water.
text: Above, Greer casts a line. It falls near, but out of reach
text: as the swell of the water starts to swing the crane to and
text: fro. Dodge reaches out for the line again, his hand coming
text: close but not close enough.
text: The swell brings the crane toward the boat one last time and
text: Dodge reaches out, his fingers just coming to the line,
text: coaxing it into his grasp. He pulls it back and hangs on, as
text: the crane sways back with the foundering boat.
text: The crane falls away from Dodge, leaving him hanging in space
text: by the line from the bow of the Chimera.
scene_heading: WITH THE OTHERS
text: Murphy, Greer and Epps look on as Dodge hangs over the water
text: and the tug as its stern slowly sinks beneath the waves.
text: Dodge climbs the line toward the bow railing as the tug rolls
text: still further to port, the pilothouse dipping into the sea,
text: slipping lower and lower.
speaker_heading: WITH DODGE
text: As he pulls himself upward, coming to the bottom of the rail
text: well on the Chimera where Murphy reaches out, just short of
text: Dodge's hand.
text: A SCREECHING SOUNDS and they turn to see the twin tow cables
text: coming taught against the hull in the anchor alley's of the
text: Chimera as the sinking tug pulls them tight.
text: With a CONCUSSIVE STRIKE, one cable is freed, snapping against
text: the Chimera's hull like a giant steel guitar string. It
text: starts sliding along the hull as the tug drifts, pulling the
text: cable with it, toward Dodge as he dangles in mid air.
text: Dodge pulls himself up, reaching for Murphy, but still short.
text: A LOUD HISSING SOUNDS and Dodge turns to see misty air
text: escaping from ports and deck vents as the encroaching water
text: forces it out of the tug below decks.
text: The tow cable LOUDLY SCRAPES THE HULL in a shower of rust,
text: as Dodge struggles to pull himself up.
text: Murphy reaches out as Dodge extends as far as he can, their
text: hands barely reaching.
text: The tow cable is a mere few feet away and closing, ready to
text: scrape Dodge into the water or smear him across the hull
text: like a bug on a windshield, when Dodge pulls himself up with
text: everything he's got and Murphy grabs his hand.
text: Murphy pulls, lifting Dodge, as Greer grabs Dodge's other
text: hand and they pull him up, the tow cable sweeping by with a
text: SICKENING GRINDING SOUND OF HEAVY STEEL AGAINST STEEL.
text: Dodge turns to see the bow of the tug dip below the surface,
text: slowly going under until disappearing with a last exhalation
text: of misty air. The pilothouse is next to go, the last of it
text: slipping into the frothing water, then the crane, finally
text: disappearing altogether into the depths.
text: A long beat as they hold there in the sudden silence, phantom
text: bubbles rising to the surface where the tug once stood.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY
text: A boot punches through a rotten wood hull.
speaker_heading: MURPHY (O.S.)
dialog: That just about says it all.
text: Greer stands at the bow of a lifeboat suspended from halyards
text: above the deck.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Rotten stem to stern. Guess you
dialog: couldn't expect much else.
text: Greer jumps down as Murphy, Dodge, and Epps look on.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: We ain't exactly in what you'd call
dialog: your high traffic neighborhood either.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: The coast guard has our last position.
dialog: They'll send somebody out soon enough.
dialog: A ship this size you can't exactly
dialog: miss.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: It's a good bet they'll be asking a
dialog: lot of questions when they get here
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Let 'em ask. This ship's legally
dialog: ours now.
speaker_heading: DODGE
text: When they find out what it's carrying,
dialog: they may not be so interested in
dialog: what's legal.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Maybe you shoulda thought a that
dialog: before you scuttled our boat.
text: Dodge turns to see Greer. A beat.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: The turbine blew.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Lemme see, was that before or after
dialog: the oil fire?
text: A beat. Dodge takes a swing at Greer.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (grabbing Dodge)
dialog: Easy, easy.
text: Murphy holds on to Dodge as he will have none of it.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Gettin' a little hot under the collar,
dialog: I'd say.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Must be a little too the truth, eh
dialog: Dodge?
text: Dodge jumps forward again, but Murphy hangs on.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: I said, shut the hell up.
text: Murphy shoves Dodge back.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Both of you. I don't want to hear it
dialog: again.
text: A beat as Greer and Murphy hold there.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: So just stow it. You understand?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: We don't need this right now.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT
text: A fire burns in an oil drum as Epps, Murphy, Dodge and Greer
text: sit around it in silence.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT
text: Epps steps in. She shines her light on the room. It is exactly
text: as it was left. She crosses to the bed, shining her light
text: under it. She sits down, trying it.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
text: Dodge moves in the darkness, coming to the corner where the
text: stacked gold ingots rest. He looks on at them.
speaker_heading: MURPHY (O.S.)
dialog: You shouldn't be down here alone.
text: Dodge turns to see Murphy standing there.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Just wanted to check on our little
dialog: baby.
text: A beat as they look on at the gold.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: That oughta buy a man pretty much
dialog: anything he wants.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: If money can buy what he wants.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: I don't figure there's much I want
dialog: money can't buy.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Then you're a lucky man.
text: Murphy tosses the shotgun to Dodge, who catches it.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: We'll stand the watch on deck tonight.
dialog: You're up first.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Right.
text: Murphy holds there a beat longer, then turns to go, as Dodge
text: looks after him.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - DAY
text: A grey chop gently rocks the Chimera, smoke rising from the
text: top deck.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY
text: Greer and Dodge tend the flames of three fire barrels, adding
text: broken up furniture to create heavy signal smoke.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PANTRY - DAY
text: Murphy moves through the pantry area with a pillow case,
text: scavenging for food.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY
text: Epps scavenges for food in the semi-darkness of the large,
text: open galley, when a MOVEMENT CAN BE HEARD SOMEWHERE BEYOND
text: THE ENTRY separating the galley from the outer passageway.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Murphy?
text: No one answers. She looks off across the stillness of the
text: galley. Nothing.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Epps steps into the passageway. Directly across is the entry
text: to the swimming pool. She walks on.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - DAY
text: Epps steps in. Light falls in from the dirty port holes at
text: the ceiling, every movement echoing off the hard tile walls.
text: She holds there a beat, then turns to go when she sees a
text: GIRL of about 16 facing her on the other side of the pool.
text: Epps holds there, as the girl only looks back. She is
text: porcelain white, flaxen hair drawn behind her head, her
text: clothing hanging loosely from a frail body.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: You must leave.
text: A beat as Epps stands there.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: (finally)
dialog: Who are you?
text: From this distance and in the light it is hard to fully
text: discern the girl's features.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: There's great evil here, more than
dialog: you can know. Leave now or you may
dialog: never leave.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: But --
text: A HATCH CLOSES SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. Epps turns to look.
text: When she turns back the girl is gone. A quiet "TICK" SOUND
text: ECHOES in the pool. She looks down to see that the pool is
text: now very, very deep, like a mine shaft falling away into the
text: depths. And, as she stands there, dark water is quickly rising
text: up from the bottom.
text: She steps back as the water gradually fills the pool to the
text: top. It is very dark and the bottom is indiscernible, when
text: the water begins to churn, as from bubbles of air reaching
text: the surface. Epps steps closer, looking on as a faint red
text: glow can be seen deep in the water below the churning bubbles.
text: As she watches, the red glow grows in intensity. The glow
text: spreads, illuminating a broad area until it becomes clear
text: that the water is not water at all but blood.
text: And, as the light grows still brighter, a figure is
text: illuminated, well below the surface as it seems to rise up.
text: Epps looks on as the figure rises higher into the light. It
text: is a MAN, fighting desperately to reach the surface. The
text: bubbles that rise up are produced from his silent screams.
text: Epps starts forward, but another figure rises to the same
text: point, a WOMAN, also struggling. Another MAN floats up, then
text: another, and another, people floating up, fighting desperately
text: to reach the surface, unable to do so, drowning in blood.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: My God....
text: Epps reaches out over the edge, plunging her hand into the
text: blood, reaching for the man's hand, but they are too far
dialog: apart.
text: She struggles desperately as the man fights to get to the
dialog: surface.
text: The others are fighting for the surface too, as Epps reaches
text: out, near tears, helpless to do anything.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: No!!
text: Everything suddenly stops. A beat as Epps only holds there.
text: The blood is gone, as are the people. The pool is back to
text: its normal state as though nothing had happened, Epps looking
text: on in disbelief.
speaker_heading: MURPHY (O.S.)
dialog: You okay?
text: Epps looks up to see Murphy standing at the door.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (looking back to the
dialog: pool)
dialog: Yeah, fine.
text: A beat as she holds there, looking on at the pool.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - FOREWARD DECK - NIGHT
text: Greer, Murphy, Dodge, and Epps sit on deck around the fire.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: You'd think on a ship this size
dialog: there'd be something left to eat.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: After fifty years there ain't nothin'
text: left but shoe leather.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find
dialog: some line and tackle. Use some of
text: those bodies below decks for bait.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: There's a charming thought.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: We can always start shooting birds.
text: Epps coaxes a hit out of her last cigarette.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: What say, Epps? You up for some
dialog: roasted albatross?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: (snuffing it out)
dialog: Why not?
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT
text: The SOUND OF SOMEONE BREATHING HARD CAN BE HEARD in the dark
text: room. As the CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES INTO THE ROOM, we see that
text: it is Greer, lying on the bed. His body is tense and his
text: arms arch rigidly toward his chest. His jaw is clenched and
text: he expels harsh, guttural utterances, experiencing something
text: between a night terror and a seizure.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - WHEELHOUSE - DAY
text: Sheets of rain come down on the deck in the grey light of
text: morning. Murphy stands on the bridge, looking off at it coming
text: down when Greer steps in.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Looks like we're in a strong current.
dialog: (closing the door)
dialog: Must be making almost five knots
text: full on ass backwards.
text: Greer crosses to the window, stepping up.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Nasty little swell outa the north
dialog: west too.
text: Murphy nods as he looks out.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Let's just hope somebody sees us
dialog: first out here.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PURSERS OFFICE - DAY
text: A file drawer comes open, revealing ticket receipts.
text: Epps looks on at it. The receipts are labeled "FULL FARE
dialog: PASSAGES" and are divided by first, second, and third class.
text: She goes through them, coming to a section that says
scene_heading: "ACCOMPANIED CHILDREN."
text: She pulls out the folder, laying it on the counter, opening
text: it. The first page is a receipt for a single passage to
text: Halifax for a Tatterly, Stephen age: 14. She pulls it back
text: to reveal another, Wilson, Harold age: 4. Another, Vitti,
dialog: Angela age: 17.
text: She pages through the stack, looking at the ages: 3, 15, 6,
text: 11, 1, until coming across a 9. She looks to the name, Klein,
text: David, a boy. She continues paging through the receipts coming
text: to another 9. She stops, looking to the name, Nichols,
text: Katherine age: 16. A girl. She looks to the cabin assignment:
text: "400." She notes that it is the same cabin where Greer was
text: found, when a REVERBERANT CONCUSSION SOUNDS THROUGH THE SHIP.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Dodge runs to the side to see a 15 feet wide by 40 feet tall
text: steel and concrete mid-ocean buoy bounce off the transom as
text: the ship drifts into it.
scene_heading: WITH GREER AND MURPHY
text: They come to the side at the wheelhouse, seeing the bright
text: orange letters "NOAA" emblazoned on the buoy's float pod as
text: the ship drifts by.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: It's a Noaa buoy.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Government weather. It's got a
text: transmitter aboard.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Dodge quickly ties a loop in a coil of docking line as Greer,
text: Epps, and Murphy look on at the approaching buoy.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Let's go, let's go, let's go.
text: Dodge finishes as Epps ties the other end off to a cleat.
scene_heading: ON THE BUOY
text: As it drifts along the side of the Chimera. Murphy drops the
text: line down, the buoy bouncing on the swell.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Murphy pulls the loop up as the buoy nears, aiming to hook
text: it on its wind gauge.
scene_heading: ON THE BUOY
text: The buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Murphy corrects.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Higher. You're gonna miss it.
text: Murphy holds the loop steady.
scene_heading: ON THE BUOY
text: The loop is too low. It's going to miss the mark as the buoy
text: drifts toward it, when the swell drops and the buoy goes
dialog: down.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Murphy yanks on the line.
scene_heading: ON THE BUOY
text: And the loop catches on the wind gauge.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: As the line goes taught he pulls his hands away just in time,
text: the line snapping hard against the rail. Below, the buoy
text: heels over as it's pulled.
scene_heading: ON THE BUOY
text: It drops with the swell, the line stretching, then swinging
text: the giant concrete buoy float into the side of the hull with
text: a huge BOOMING CLANG.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: The line is smoking with the friction, the steel railing
text: bowing a little with the weight as they look on.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: We're still drifting.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: The mooring hasn't come taught.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: It's not gonna hold us.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Doesn't matter.
scene_heading: ON THE BUOY
text: As the buoy falls again with a swell and slams into the side
text: of the ship. The water returns, lifting it high.
text: The ship is dragging it back and it begins to rise up as its
text: mooring comes taught. The line rises with it and soon the
text: buoy is at a steep angle as it comes out of the water.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: The buoy is held fast between the docking line and its own
text: mooring.
scene_heading: ON THE BUOY
text: The buoy rises fully from the water, all three tons of it,
text: and as it does, the wind gauge's steel mount begins to bend.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: As they watch the buoy suspended over the water between the
text: creaking docking line and its own underwater mooring cable.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: No fucking way.
scene_heading: ON THE BUOY
text: The gauge mount snaps and the docking line flails free,
text: sending the buoy hurtling back into the water in a curtain
text: of spray, whipping wildly from side to side.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: The buoy swings back and forth as it rights itself, rising
text: on a swell, passing beyond the bow of the Chimera.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Damn it.
text: They look on in silence, the buoy slowly receding as the
text: ship drifts away.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT
text: Murphy stands watch by the fire as Epps joins him.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Couldn't sleep.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Wish I could say the same.
text: They watch the fire in silence for a moment.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: What do you think happened on this
dialog: boat?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: I guess that's the sixty four thousand
dialog: dollar question, isn't it?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: The what?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Never mind. Before your time.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I think at least some of the crew
dialog: went a little nuts. The usual stuff
dialog: that happens when people stumble on
dialog: a fortune. Equal parts greed and
dialog: paranoia, usually resulting in
dialog: homicide. What happened after that
dialog: is anybody's guess. But, judging by
dialog: our Greek friends down below, it
text: doesn't look like the last time.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Are we smart enough to avoid that?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: I don't know, are we?
text: A beat as she looks back at him. She looks back to the fire,
text: watching it.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: When you found me yesterday, at the
dialog: pool. I'd seen... something. Someone.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Not our mystery guest again.
speaker_heading: EPPS
text: No. Someone else. A girl.
dialog: (hesitating, a beat)
dialog: I'm not sure she was... real.
text: She looks up to Murphy.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Not real?
text: A beat as she only looks back.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: What, like some kind of ghost?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: I don't know what else you'd call
dialog: her. One second she was there, the
dialog: next she was gone.
text: Another beat as he looks on at her.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: And I had a kind of hallucination.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: There were others. I saw them in the
text: pool. Drowning.
text: A beat as Murphy looks back, as she sees him.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Maybe hallucination is the wrong
dialog: word. It was more than that. As though
dialog: they were showing me.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Showing you what?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: What happened.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Maybe it was one of them did the
dialog: handy work on those Greeks.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: No. I think they are, were, just
dialog: passengers. Innocent victims.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Victims of what?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Something bad happened here, Murphy.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: That much I think we've already
dialog: established.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: More than just a mutiny. More than
dialog: just the gold.
text: A beat as he holds there.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: She said the ship was evil. That we
dialog: had to leave right away. That if we
dialog: didn't, we might never leave.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: I don't know.
text: A beat as she looks back.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Why you? How come the rest of us
dialog: haven't seen these people?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Just lucky I guess.
text: Another beat as he holds on her.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Well. Getting off this ship's exactly
dialog: what we're trying to do. Short of
dialog: that, I don't know what else to tell
dialog: you.
text: She only looks back at him, then into the fire.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Do me a favor and wake up Dodge.
text: He's next on.
text: She starts to get up.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: And Epps?
text: She stands, looking back at him.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: You can tell the others about this.
dialog: But, for my money, I think it's best
dialog: you keep it to yourself.
text: She holds there a beat longer, then turns, walking off.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY
text: Epps comes to the 2nd officer's door, knocks.
speaker_heading: EPPS

speaker_heading: EPPS

speaker_heading: DODGE (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah, yeah.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT
text: Epps sits down on the bed. She lies back, not sleepy. A beat
text: as she holds there in the darkness.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT
text: Murphy still sits by the fire as Dodge groggily approaches
text: from the officers quarters, carrying a blanket and a jug of
dialog: water.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: You're late.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (handing him the
dialog: shotgun)
dialog: Don't fall asleep.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: (laying out his blanket)
dialog: Right.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT
text: Greer lies asleep on the bed. But his sleep is fitful,
text: increasingly agitated, tormented. It is as if he tries to
text: speak, but cannot. As THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN, his words
text: are forced and garbled, speaking in the same nonsensical
text: language he spoke earlier, when he wakes with a start.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT
text: Dodge dozes, cradling the shotgun in his arms, when MUSIC
text: CAN BE HEARD VERY DISTANTLY. Dodge wakes. It is "Daisy"
text: playing on a music box somewhere in the ship.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
text: Dodge moves along as the MUSIC BOX DISTANTLY CONTINUES.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
text: Dodge moves cautiously down the stairway into another
text: passageway.
text: He approaches from the other end. He passes the open doors
text: of stateroom after stateroom. The MUSIC BOX IS CLOSER HERE.
text: It stops.
text: He holds there in the darkness. He turns, shining his light
text: back down the passageway. A beat. It is silent, when the
text: CHANNEL OF HIS RADIO OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST.
text: He raises his radio. But no one says anything, the CHANNEL
text: REMAINING OPEN, a discernible presence on the other end.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Dodge.
scene_heading: SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END
text: SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the other
text: end of the passageway.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: He gets no response, then presses the talk button.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: This is Dodge. Over.
text: He is answered by silence, the CHANNEL REMAINING OPEN, WHEN
text: THE GRAVELLY DISTORTED VOICE THAT MURPHY HEARD COMES BACK ON
speaker_heading: THE RADIO:
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: "Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster
dialog: to the crow. "Where are you now? I
dialog: know but won't say so."
text: Dodge hits the talk button.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Who is this?
text: The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS, but only silence comes back.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Identify yourself, motherfucker!
scene_heading: SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END
text: SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the far
text: end of the passageway.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Only silence returns on the radio as Dodge holds there, then:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle
dialog: toy.
text: THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN ON DODGE as he listens.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy --
dialog: .
text: Dodge senses something behind him. He turns, and before he
text: can draw a breath to shout, SOMETHING HEAVY SLAMS INTO HIM
text: IN THE DARKNESS, his flashlight tumbling away in a squiggle
text: of light.
speaker_heading: ON SHOTGUN
text: As the shotgun clatters to the deck, the muzzle resting in
text: frame as the radio falls a few feet away. A beat. The shotgun
text: muzzle slides out of frame as some unseen person or thing
text: pulls it away.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - DAY
text: A grey overcast stretches to the horizon.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - DAY
text: Murphy comes out onto the deck. Dodge is nowhere to be seen.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Dodge?
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY STORAGE COMPARTMENT - DAY
text: Epps shines her light on something.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Check it out.
text: Greer raises his light to reveal rows of canned goods. They
text: are industrial sized cans, from the 1950s. Greer takes one.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: I don't even want to know what that's
dialog: gonna taste like now.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Better than starving to death.
text: Epps' radio CRACKLES AWAKE.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Murphy to Epps.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: (raising the radio)
text: Epps, over.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Either of you seen Dodge?
text: She looks to Greer who shakes his head.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: He's not on deck and I can't raise
text: him on the radio.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - LATER - DAY
text: Dodge's stuff is laid out under the shelter of a vent duct
text: as Greer, Epps, and Murphy stand over it. A blanket, a pillow
text: and a plastic jug of water are all that remain.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
text: He took the shotgun and a light.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Must've heard something below deck
dialog: and went down to check it out.
text: A beat as they hold there.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Alright. We stay together. Nobody
text: goes any further than earshot.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - DAY
text: Greer and Epps move along as Murphy raises his radio.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (into radio)
text: Murphy to Dodge. Murphy to Dodge.
dialog: Over.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Dodge's radio lies in the detritus of the ship as Murphy's
text: voice can be heard on it.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Murphy to Dodge. Do you copy? Over.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - ENGINEERING - LATER - DAY
text: Epps moves cautiously along in the darkness.
speaker_heading: MURPHY (O.S.)
dialog: Epps? You there?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Right here.
speaker_heading: WITH MURPHY
text: As he moves along as well, eyes open.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Greer?
speaker_heading: WITH GREER
text: As Greer moves along too.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Yeah, yeah.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY
text: Epps jumps down, shining her light over machinery and across
text: bulkheads when a WHISPERING CAN BE HEARD somewhere. She holds
text: there, listening. It is echoey, distant.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Murphy?
text: No response as Epps holds there. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN,
text: far off, unintelligible. It stops.
text: She moves on, shinning her light.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Epps moves along in the darkness, holding the flashlight
text: before her, when the WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN.
text: Epps stops, holding there in the silence. She reaches for
text: her radio. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN. Epps turns to pinpoint
text: it, coming from somewhere in the cavernous space.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Epps passes under a catwalk. She moves on, passing a row of
text: standpipes. Epps stops, listening. Somewhere, the WHISPERING
text: CAN BE HEARD, then stops.
text: It is absolutely silent. In the darkness behind her, the
text: GIRL (KATIE) PULLS BACK INTO THE SHADOWS.
text: Epps holds there a beat, then turns, running into Greer with
dialog: a start.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.
text: She holds there a beat, looking around.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard
dialog: something is all.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Nothing. Let's get outa here.
text: They start to leave, when Epps notices something. She stops.
text: Beyond the standpipes, a faint glow can be seen in the
text: darkness. Epps steps forward, crossing to it. Greer follows.
speaker_heading: MOVING WITH EPPS
text: As Epps approaches, Greer behind her. The light is dim and
text: low to the deck. She stops.
text: WITH THE LIGHT
text: As Epps starts toward it again. She and Greer come up to it,
text: stopping there. She kneels, the dim glow shining on her. She
text: reaches out toward it, pulling back Dodge's flashlight, still
dialog: on.
text: She turns it off, standing. She shines her light into the
text: darkness and starts off, Greer following.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Epps and Greer move along, shining their lights as they go,
text: when something catches in the beam of Epps' flashlight.
text: It is Dodge's radio. They stop over it. Epps picks it up,
text: inspecting it. She looks to Greer, when a single dark spot
text: appears on Epps' cheek. It begins to run, a crimson tear.
text: She raises her hand to touch it, inspecting her finger to
dialog: see that it is blood.
text: She looks to Greer. They both look up to see, hanging
text: suspended above them, Dodge's face staring back down at them
text: from the darkness.
text: He has been imperfectly impaled, the sharp point of a high
text: pressure steam pipe protruding from his neck, head hanging
text: limp beside it.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY
text: Greer and Murphy lower Dodge's body on a rope as Epps guides
text: it to the deck. They stand looking on at it a moment.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Can't find the shotgun.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: So whoever did this now has our
dialog: shotgun.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Doesn't look like it much matters.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: What do we do with him?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Leave him till we can get some help.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: From now on, nobody comes down here.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: What about the gold?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Leave it.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Now hold up just a minute. Let's be
dialog: reasonable here.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: You think whoever did this is
dialog: reasonable?
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: All I'm saying is that gold's worth
dialog: a lot more to us now than it ever
dialog: was.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: I can't believe you. Dodge's dead
dialog: and all you can think about is cashing
dialog: in your share.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: I didn't sign up to go home empty
dialog: handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll
dialog: over for the freaky motherfucker did
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Nobody's going anywhere with that
dialog: gold now. Anybody tries to board,
dialog: we'll know about it.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: You can do what you want, Greer.
dialog: But neither of us is gonna risk saving
dialog: your ass down here if it comes to
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Fine with me.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - DAY
text: Epps enters the dim passageway from the bright daylight. She
text: moves down the passage, coming finally to the stateroom where
text: Greer was found, room 400.
text: She holds there a beat, then reaches for the door, hesitating.
text: She opens it.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: The door comes open and Epps steps in. It is dark, though
text: spacious. It is divided into two rooms. Beyond the sitting
text: room in the front, is a bedroom.
text: Epps steps in. A dressing table sits against the far wall.
text: A large bed is unmade. Suitcases lie open on stands at the
text: foot of the bed, still half full as if they were in the
text: process of being unpacked.
text: From one, she pulls back a woman's gown, a blouse. The other
text: contains shirts, trousers, socks, and underwear.
text: Across the room a smaller suitcase can be seen lying open on
text: an Ottoman in the corner. Epps crosses to it. She finds a
text: few shirts, and a red print dress, some books. She takes one
text: of the books, opening it.
text: Inscribed on the inside of the cover is: "This book belongs
text: to:" and then written in by hand: "Katie Nichols."
text: A page is marked with a purple ribbon. She opens it to see a
text: children's poem "The Rooster and the Crow" and a drawing of
text: a rooster and a crow and a stanza of a poem: "'Cock-a-doodle
dialog: doo,' said the rooster to the crow. 'Where are you now? I
dialog: know, but won't say so.'" She puts it down. A tin penny
text: whistle sits on the table. She picks it up, examining it.
text: She opens a small picture book, thumbing through to see photos
text: of a family, a young mother and father at the beach, the
text: mother and a girl of about 9 years, the girl and an older
text: girl of about 16, the girl she saw at the swimming pool,
text: KATIE. Epps holds on this picture, when A MUSIC BOX SOUNDS.
text: She looks up to the dressing table. On it a music box slowly
dialog: plays "Daisy."
speaker_heading: AT THE TABLE
text: Epps crosses to it, looking on at the music box as it slowly
text: winds down, then finally stops. A beat. She picks it up,
text: looking at it, when she looks up to see Greer standing there.
text: A beat.
text: The dirty white light falling into the room through the
text: windows falls on him as he looks off at something we cannot
text: see. His expression is empty, hollow.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Greer?
text: He does not hear her as he stands there. She approaches,
dialog: stepping up.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: You okay?
text: Another beat, as he looks off, into the light, when he slowly
text: turns to see her.
text: A long beat as she looks back. He holds there, the same empty
text: look about him, when he grabs her by the throat and squeezes
dialog: hard.
text: She is stunned, breathless, but raises her hands to grip his
text: wrists, fighting him.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Greer!
text: His grip tightens. He is much stronger and her efforts make
dialog: little difference.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Let go!
text: She hangs on, starting to choke. She drops one hand, searching
dialog: with it.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska
dialog: getofedobrodijotosiantosg.
text: He speaks nonsense, his face distorted in an ugly grimace,
text: eyes bulging as Epps fumbles over the table, a tray of glass
text: and silver crashing to the floor as he pushes her back, still
dialog: choking her.
text: He backs her to the wall, pushing in, closing her windpipe
text: the rest of the way.
text: Her hand searches behind her, knocking over a small vase, a
text: basket, some books. It comes to a brass desk lamp. It falls,
text: a little out of reach.
text: She is going to black out any second, as Greer strangles
dialog: her.
text: Her hand comes to the desk lamp, grabbing it.
text: She raises the lamp, swinging with all her might, connecting
text: with Greer's head.
text: He stumbles back, a gash laid into his face, as Epps sucks
text: in air, gagging and coughing, her neck purple with finger
text: marks. She fumbles her radio up.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: Murphy! I'm on C deck, cabin 400!
dialog: Get down here now!!
text: Blood is running down his face as Greer comes for her again.
text: She throws down the radio.
text: A bed stands between them. She feints right, then left. He's
text: dazed and has blood in his eyes. She manages to slip by, but
text: he dives, taking her down.
text: He drags her back along the floor, spinning her around. He
text: raises a fist to ram into her face when WHAM!
text: Epps has shoved the butt of her flashlight into his crotch
text: and he comes up SCREAMING. He grabs her face, striking her
text: with his other hand.
text: She swings the flashlight again and cracks him across the
text: head. He swings yet again and connects, knocking her across
dialog: the floor.
text: She lies in a heap as Greer climbs to his feet, enraged and
dialog: bleeding.
text: He unbuckles his belt as he approaches, pulling it from his
dialog: waist to do God knows what.
text: Epps looks around to see him approaching. And we see that
text: she has unhinged her gill knife.
text: As his foot steps near, she lets go and drives the knife
text: with all her might into his boot, plunging the blade through
text: his foot and into the floor. He SCREAMS.
text: After a moment he stops, looks to her. He is a bloody,
text: wretched, enraged mess. He starts toward her as Murphy appears
text: in the doorway.
text: Just as Greer is upon her, Murphy blind sides Greer from
text: behind at full speed, knocking him down.
text: Greer and Murphy struggle as Epps climbs unsteadily to her
text: feet. She staggers to them and raises the flashlight over
text: Greer, bringing it down on his head.
scene_heading: CUT TO BLACK
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY
text: Epps and Murphy carry Greer's unconscious body.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY
text: Greer tumbles down a sand bank in an empty aquarium. He stops
text: at the bottom, now starting to come to.
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE
text: Murphy slams the door shut as Epps looks on. She puts a steel
text: pipe across the hatch lever so that it cannot be opened.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY
text: Greer sits in the tank, visible through a large piece of
text: armored aquarium glass, amidst the fake coral. He sits in
text: the sand hugging his legs to his chest, bobbing slightly as
text: he speaks in his nonsensical language.
speaker_heading: MURPHY (V.O.)
dialog: Must've been him all along.
text: Murphy and Epps look on from the outside in the promenade.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
text: Smashed the radio. Scuttled the boat.
dialog: Killed Dodge. Would've killed you.
dialog: He's off his nut, no doubt there.
text: They watch him in silence a moment as Greer mutters and bobs.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Could be a stroke. Who knows?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: The general log said the crew were
dialog: fighting among themselves. "Like
dialog: wild dogs."
speaker_heading: MURPHY
text: Over the gold.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Maybe it was more than that.
text: Greer gets up, comes to the window, looking out at them. He
text: presses his face to the glass.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: They went crazy.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not
dialog: like him.
text: A beat as Epps looks off. In the window Greer drags his
text: hideously distorted face over the glass, the blood from his
text: wounds smearing in broad red streaks.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY
text: A partial hull of a rotting life boat falls into frame. Epps
text: and Murphy stand over it.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: We lash a few of these together it
dialog: might get us far enough into the
dialog: shipping lanes to be rescued.
text: A beat as they look on at the rotting hull.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Hard to say which is worse, staying
dialog: here or taking our chances in open
dialog: water.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: If the weather holds it might not be
dialog: so bad.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: It's not the weather I'm worried
dialog: about. The wrong current could drag
dialog: us as far as the Aleutians before we
text: come across another boat.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY
text: Epps and Murphy work to lash parts of the rotting boats into
text: a single usable raft.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - DAY
text: Greer lies asleep on the sand bottom of the tank, the white
text: light from the skylight falling on him from above.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE AREA - DAY
text: Epps has found a reel of wire and some metal braces, making
text: her way into the darkness, when her radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.
text: The channel remains silent a moment, then closes. She stops,
text: raises the radio.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: (holding down talk
dialog: button)
dialog: Murphy?
text: She waits, holding there as only silence comes back.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Murphy, this is Epps. Do you copy?
text: Again, only silence comes back until, after a moment, the
text: channel opens again. No one speaks, though there is a palpable
text: presence on the other end.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: (raising the radio)
dialog: Who is this?
text: The channel opens again, only silence returning. The sound
text: of the MUSIC BOX CAN BE HEARD, "DAISY" COMING BACK OVER THE
speaker_heading: RADIO.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Epps walks along in the darkness AS THE MUSIC BOX CONTINUES
text: TO PLAY OVER THE RADIO. She comes to the end of the corridor,
dialog: stopping there.
text: At the other end the light falls from the door at room 400.
text: The MUSIC FROM THE RADIO STOPS, leaving in its absence the
text: MUSIC AS IT CAN BE HEARD COMING FROM THE ROOM AT THE END OF
scene_heading: THE CORRIDOR.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Epps approaches the other end, from where the MUSIC EMANATES,
text: coming to a stop at room 400. A beat as she holds there.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Epps steps in as THE MUSIC BOX PLAYS IN THE OTHER ROOM.
text: The sitting room is dark as she holds there. After a moment,
text: she continues on, coming to the bedroom.
text: Epps steps in. Across the room the MUSIC BOX IS PLAYING.
text: She crosses, coming to it as it continues, when her radio
text: CRACKLES TO LIFE. The channel remains silent a moment, then:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: "Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster
dialog: to the crow. Where are you now? I
dialog: know but won't say so."
text: She holds there a beat, then crosses to the table to find
text: the book of nursery rhymes. She opens it to the nursery rhyme
text: "The Rooster and the Crow," seeing the same words on the
text: page, when the radio CRACKLES AGAIN.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle
dialog: toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle
dialog: toy.
text: On the table is the penny whistle she saw earlier. She takes
text: it, holding on it a moment. She raises it and THE CAMERA
text: SLOWLY PUSHES IN as she puts it to her lips and lightly blows
text: a C-SHARP WHICH BECOMES A C-SHARP FROM A PENNY WHISTLE across
dialog: the room.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: "Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster
dialog: to the crow. Where are you now? I
dialog: know but won't say so."
text: On the other side of the room, the younger girl from the
text: photo plays the penny whistle. She is sitting on the floor
text: with the MOTHER who reads from the book we saw earlier.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: "Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster
dialog: to the crow. Where are you now? I
dialog: know but won't say so." Cassandra,
dialog: if you insist on playing that while
dialog: I read I'll just stop right now.
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: Sorry.
text: The room is warm with light, restored to its original
text: condition some fifty years ago as Epps stands there, unseen,
text: no longer holding the whistle.
text: A man, the FATHER from the photos, steps from the bathroom
text: wearing a new coat.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: He certainly did shorten it, didn't
dialog: he?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: I thought this was all the rage.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Maybe last year.
text: Katie joins them from the outer room.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: What about this year?
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: It's not your color anyway.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I like it, daddy.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Well thank you!
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Daddy, how much longer before we
dialog: start moving again?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: They're working on the engines, honey.
dialog: As soon as they fix them we'll be on
dialog: our way.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
text: Epps steps from room 400 into the passageway. It is lit with
text: sconces running its length and the elegant furnishings and
text: objets d'art stretching to the far end are all in their
scene_heading: original condition. DISTANT MUSIC FROM THE BALLROOM CAN BE
text: HEARD as Epps stands there. She moves along.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
text: Epps walks in the passageway. Doors are open and she looks
text: in to see people doing various things, some packing and
dialog: putting their things in order.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
text: Epps walks down the passage, rounding the corner to see three
text: STEWARDS fighting with a fourth MAN in a tuxedo. They lift
text: him up and carry him off down the stairs as he shouts and
text: protests. She moves on, through a pair of double doors, into
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Epps moves through the now lighted storage area off the
text: galley. A group of CREWMEN stand around at the other end
text: and, as Epps nears, she sees that four figures can be seen
text: among them. They are four men, OFFICERS, swaying gently from
text: the ship's movement as they hang from ropes around their
text: neck, dead. Epps keeps moving, through doors at the other
dialog: end.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
text: A commotion can be heard at the other end of the passageway
text: as Epps keeps moving. A WOMAN SCREAMS, and is cut off when a
text: door slams shut.
text: The DISTANT MUSIC HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH INDISCERNIBLE
text: SHOUTING, as of someone commandeering the microphone somewhere
text: As she walks, she passes an open door where several CREWMEN
text: fight over a steamer trunk, which breaks open, scattering
dialog: the contents.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
text: Epps walks along, coming to another door where a dead man
text: and woman are laying in the middle of the room as a STEWARD
text: takes money from a wallet. The steward looks up, reaches
text: over and slams the door shut. She continues on.
text: Another door stands open as she comes to it, back at room
text: 400. She stops. A REPETITIVE SOUND CAN BE HEARD, coming from
dialog: inside.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Epps steps in as the SOUND CONTINUES. She crosses the sitting
text: room, coming to the doorway of the bedroom to find several
text: MUTINEERS, some in stewards attire, others wearing ships
text: officers caps, obviously taken from their rightful owners.
text: The repetitive sound comes from here, bed springs. And, from
text: between the men, a woman's bare legs hang over the end of
text: the bed as a pair of man's legs in boots lie between them,
text: the bed rocking, the others looking on.
text: Epps turns to see the father. He is on his knees, hands tied
text: behind his back as he is forced to watch from the foot of
dialog: the bed.
text: EPPS LOOKS DOWN TO SEE
speaker_heading: EPPS' POV
text: a geometric pattern of a lotus on the Persian carpet at her
text: feet. When she looks up again she sees what the father sees.
text: The mutineer finishes, climbing off the woman. Another of
text: the men pulls her up to reveal that she is no woman at all,
dialog: but Katie.
text: The mother and sister lie in a bloody heap near-by as one of
text: the other mutineers steps up to Epps.
speaker_heading: MUTINEER
dialog: You like that, daddy? I'll show you
dialog: something else now.
text: The mutineer steps back to the bed. He sits Katie down so
text: that she faces us on the end of the bed. He raises an axe
text: over her, bringing it down as the world becomes a whirling
dialog: blur --
speaker_heading: EPPS (V.O.)
dialog: NO!!!!
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: The CAMERA STOPS ON KATIE standing on the other side of the
text: room, now empty of people, returned to its shabby, abandoned
dialog: state.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: It isn't real.
text: Epps looks back at her from the other side of the room where
text: she stands.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Many bad things have happened here.
dialog: But you mustn't allow the evil inside.
dialog: I tell you this because you can see
dialog: me. The others can't. But you must
dialog: leave. You must leave.
text: A LOUD GUNSHOT SOUNDS SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. When Epps turns
text: back Katie is gone.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Epps moves quickly along, raising her radio.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Epps to Murphy.
text: Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Epps to Murphy.
text: Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK as she rounds the corner out
text: onto the promenade. At the other end, the aquarium can be
dialog: seen.
text: As she approaches she sees that the tank is empty. Greer is
text: nowhere to be seen and the skylight at the top is broken
dialog: out.
text: A GREAT BOOMING SHUDDER rocks the ship. A LOUD SCREECHING OF
text: METAL follows it.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: The ship's hull being scraped at the waterline by a jagged
text: mid-ocean island no bigger than fifty or sixty feet across.
text: The ship has entered a small archipelago of such islands, a
text: mine field for a drifting ship.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Epps moves quickly along, coming to the stairway, moving up,
text: almost running into Murphy on his way down, carrying a canvas
dialog: duffle.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: We hit land.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: We're in an island chain. It's only
dialog: a matter of time before we hit another
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: EPPS
text: Greer's gone. He broke out of the
dialog: tank.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Epps and Murphy move quickly along, when another HUGE BOOMING
text: shudders the ship and the SHRIEKING OF METAL follows.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: The ship bounces off another of the small, jagged islands as
text: it drifts past, buckling the steel plate of the hull
text: precariously.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Murphy and Epps run toward the other end of the ship. As
text: they do, something can be seen lying in the middle of the
text: passage some distance down.
scene_heading: AT THE OTHER END
text: Epps and Murphy slow to see that it is a body, lying face
text: down in the passage.
text: They step up. Epps kneels as Murphy looks on. She rolls the
text: body over. It is Greer, dead.
speaker_heading: EPPS
text: He's been shot.
text: Murphy kneels too, looking on at Greer's lifeless eyes.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Let's get the hell out of here.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Murphy and Epps come up the stairway, crossing to the doors.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: As Epps and Murphy come out, moving toward the make-do raft.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: It should be enough to get us to one
dialog: of those islands. Gimme a hand,
dialog: wouldya?
text: She joins him and they lift it off its stand, taking it to
dialog: the rail.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Prop it here. We need to pull these
text: braces off. There's a hammer on the
dialog: stand. There.
text: Epps crosses back to the stands.
speaker_heading: AT THE STANDS
text: Epps kneels. No hammer. She pulls back Murphy's canvas duffle,
text: folding back the flap to reveal a shotgun, the shotgun Dodge
dialog: had when he died.
text: A beat as she holds there, when Murphy's hand grabs it.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: I'll take that.
text: A beat as she looks to Murphy.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: It was you.
text: He only looks back at her as she stands there.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: You killed them.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: It was only a matter of time before
dialog: somebody killed somebody.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: You saw it coming as well as I did.
dialog: Dodge had his plans, starting with
text: scuttling the boat. And Greer too,
dialog: except he went nuts. Couldn't take
dialog: it, I guess. Could've happened in
text: the middle of downtown Anchorage.
dialog: But did it make him any less
dialog: dangerous? I don't think so.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: So you killed them?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: The way I figure it, it was them or
dialog: me. I thought putting Dodge up on
dialog: that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a
dialog: little time. Made it look like whoever
dialog: killed those Greeks was still around.
dialog: But it's just us on this ship. Us
dialog: and your... spirit friends.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: And now you're gonna kill me, is
dialog: that it?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: I didn't want it to turn out this
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: Murphy, don't you see what's
dialog: happening?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: I think I see it pretty well.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: It's the ship. The ship's making you
dialog: think this way.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: I know a little bit about human nature
dialog: and what I've seen only confirms
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: It's a trap. There was no way we
dialog: were gonna get away with that gold.
dialog: Nobody ever does. It's just the bait.
dialog: This ship sucks people in and it
dialog: never lets them out.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: I think maybe you been on this boat
dialog: a little too long, with all that
dialog: supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's
dialog: nothing supernatural about greed.
dialog: And that's what it comes down to,
dialog: pure and simple.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: I don't give a damn about the gold.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: I wish I could believe that. Either
dialog: way, you know what I've done. I've
dialog: got no choice.
text: He raises the shotgun.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: He prepares to fire, when a CONCUSSION ROCKS THE SHIP. Epps
text: ducks and Murphy fires, a spatter of buckshot shredding the
text: vent behind her. A SCREECHING OF METAL DEEP IN THE SHIP SOUNDS
text: as she gets up, diving for cover as Murphy shuttles the gun
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: WITH EPPS
text: Epps scrambles behind a deck vent.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: The ship has bounced off yet another small island, the jagged
text: rocks loudly scrapping the hull with a deafening shriek.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Murphy crosses toward the deck vent.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: There's no reason to make this any
dialog: more difficult than it has to be.
speaker_heading: WITH EPPS
text: As Epps holds there she sees the vent opening. She pulls
text: herself up and climbs inside.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - AIR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Epps climbs down the air shaft where a giant fan spans its
text: width. She squeezes through the fan blades and drops down
text: where several vent ducts lead in different directions below
dialog: it.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Murphy comes to the vent duct where Epps went down.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - AIR DUCT - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Epps crawls through. She comes to a vent that leads out to a
text: passageway.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Murphy runs quickly down the stairway, shotgun at the ready.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: The vent is shoved out and falls to the metal catwalk.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: The CLANG FROM THE VENT SOUNDS HERE and Murphy stops.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Epps extends her feet and climbs down into the passage.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Murphy rounds the corner, moving on the same deck.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Epps moves along on a metal catwalk in the darkness when
text: something can be heard ahead of her. She stops.
text: FOOTSTEPS SOUND at the end of the passage. Epps pulls back
text: into the shadows, holding there.
text: The footsteps sound as if they are coming down stairs at the
text: other end, when the FOOTSTEPS STOP.
text: Epps holds there, listening intently in the silence when, at
text: the other end, THE SOUND OF CREAKING METAL, as from a hatch
text: slowly opening, can be heard. It stops. All is silent, WHEN
text: THE HATCH CREAKS AGAIN at the other end. She begins moving
text: toward it.
text: As she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open,
text: swaying slightly with the movement of the ship.
text: A CREAKING SOUNDS behind her. She turns, just as Murphy steps
text: into view. She ducks as he fires and a spray of buckshot
text: ricochets off the metal around her.
text: She scrambles on her belly as Murphy fires again. She swings
text: down from the catwalk, letting herself fall to the next deck.
scene_heading: AT THE BOTTOM
text: Epps gets up, runs.
speaker_heading: WITH MURPHY
text: Murphy climbs down a ladder to the lower decks.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Epps moves quickly along.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Murphy follows, when A RUMBLING SOUND CAN BE HEARD.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Epps stops where she is in the cavernous engine room, looking
text: on at the massive hull rising above her as the RUMBLING GROWS
text: IN INTENSITY. Though it seems to resonate throughout the
text: ship, it seems to originate from here, from directly below,
text: as though the hull were being dragged over a rocky bottom.
text: She steps back as the sound grows still louder, until it
text: becomes absolutely deafening.
text: The ship begins to shudder. The steel bulkheads visibly move
text: and the steel plates in the hull can be seen to bend back
dialog: and forth.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Murphy slows and finally stops.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: A few rivets pop in the hull. Then a few more, as the RUMBLING
text: GROWS STILL LOUDER.
text: Epps puts her hands to her ears and begins to back away,
text: when the RUMBLING REACHES A PINNACLE. The rivets are springing
text: out of the hull like machine gun fire when the steel plate
text: of the hull gives way, A MASSIVE CRAG OF ROCK SMASHING THROUGH
text: WITH A TREMENDOUS BOOM AND A TORRENT OF SEAWATER.
text: Epps ducks for cover as the crag tears a diagonal line through
text: the Chimera's hull like a jagged claw through paper in a
text: HORRENDOUS TUMULT OF NOISE AND STEAM AND SPARKS.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: The Chimera is impaled broadside by a particularly devious
text: rock promontory of a small island.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: The giant claw begins to pull back, as the ship drifts off,
text: water pouring in behind it.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: The ship is drifting free of the island with the current, a
text: huge gash rising on its port side.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: A massive torrent sweeps over Epps as seawater pours in
text: through the breach.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Murphy stops where he is to see water rushing in at the end
text: of the passage. He begins backing away.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Epps is forced under as the water in the hull is already
text: half way up the side, the ship listing WITH A GREAT GROANING
speaker_heading: EXERTION.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Murphy moves down the passageway, coming to the cargo
dialog: compartment.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Epps comes up for air. A clatter of all manner of debris,
text: tools and general detritus hammers against the far bulkhead
text: as the ship eases over. A boiler breaks loose of its stays.
text: Epps looks up to see it coming right for her. She ducks under
text: the water as the boiler slams into the bulkhead where she
dialog: was.
speaker_heading: WITH EPPS
text: Epps is forced down by the boiler, trapped between it and
text: the bulkhead.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: The gold slides off the palette, crashing into the far wall.
text: Murphy hurries to it, collecting ingots and putting them in
text: his pockets.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Epps struggles under the water to free herself, but she is
text: trapped, the heavy boiler and its broken stays caging her.
scene_heading: ABOVE THE WATER
text: The level of the water has now almost completely reached the
text: deck above, filling the ship almost entirely below decks.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: The water is threateningly high as Murphy pockets one last
text: ingot and makes his way for the exit.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Epps is trying to pull back the boiler stays, without luck.
text: She swims down lower, finding a pipe fitting she pries at
text: the stays, without luck, when a form drifts into view in the
text: murky water.
text: Several more forms appear. They are human, suspended in the
text: water. As Epps looks, the several forms have become many.
text: They are the bodies of the dead she saw in the pool before.
text: As they look on at her from where they are, one form emerges.
dialog: It is Katie.
text: She reaches toward Epps, as if beckoning her to take her
text: hand from the other side. Epps raises her hand, taking it.
text: The girl leads Epps down into the murky darkness where she
text: finds a way out. She takes her back further, coming to the
text: breech, leading her out and into a cool green void of water.
text: Katie stops at the breach. Epps turns to her. She only looks
text: back at Epps. Epps turns away, swimming upward toward the
text: light of the surface.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Epps breaks through, gasping for air. She looks to see the
text: Chimera, listing heavily to one side, its bow decks fully
dialog: awash.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Murphy staggers through the flooded passage.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: The Chimera is getting lower in the water, the bow submerged
text: and the stern beginning to rise.
text: Epps sees another small island some distance off. She begins
text: swimming toward it.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Water runs down the stairway as Murphy struggles toward the
dialog: top.
scene_heading: EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Epps swims as the ship sinks in the distance.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMERA - PROMENADE - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: A river of water rushes through as Murphy crosses with
dialog: difficulty.
scene_heading: EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Epps reaches the jagged rock of the island. She pulls herself
dialog: up.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Water rushes in as Murphy wades out onto the Chimera's top
text: deck. He is heavily weighted down and periodically goes under
text: as he half wades half swims, the length of the ship's aft
text: portion rising above him as the bow sinks.
scene_heading: EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Epps collapses on the rocks.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: As the ship moves lower, Murphy pushes off. He bobs under
text: momentarily, then comes back up with difficulty. The forward
text: smoke stack has dipped under and is now taking on water, the
text: current from the rushing water pulling him toward it.
scene_heading: EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Epps looks on as the giant ship angles higher and higher.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMERA - WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: As the ship dips lower, the rushing water forms an eddy that
text: pulls at Murphy. Murphy struggles, too heavy to resist as he
text: is pulled closer and closer to the sucking maw that is the
text: smokestack's opening.
text: The ship sinks further and Murphy is pulled to the edge of
text: the stack. He frantically grabs for something to hold on to,
text: without success, until he is finally pulled into the smoke
text: stack and sucked into the bowels of the ship by the rushing
dialog: water.
scene_heading: EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY
text: Epps sits perched under a rock out of the wind, looking on
text: at the Chimera, her stern rising high above water as she
text: goes down, when the RUMBLE OF ENGINES CAN BE HEARD.
text: She turns to see a Coastguard plane sweeping low over the
text: Chimera, then banking back and flying right over as she shouts
text: and waves her arms.
scene_heading: EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY
text: The Coastguard plane flies by one more time, this time
text: dropping a survival pack.
text: The Chimera's stern rises up out of the water, almost vertical
text: now, slipping further and further under.
text: Epps looks on one last time, as the ship goes down.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - WITH CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: The afterdeck of the Chimera sinks slowly, slowly down, the
text: CAMERA PUSHING IN TO "CHIMERA" as the name comes to the water,
text: then slips slowly beneath the surface. And THE CAMERA FOLLOWS,
text: MOVING INTO THE WATER to reveal that, beneath the surface,
text: there is no ship at all, only the vast empty depths of the
dialog: ocean.
