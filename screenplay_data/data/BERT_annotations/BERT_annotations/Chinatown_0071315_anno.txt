speaker_heading: CHINATOWN
dialog: Written by
dialog: Robert Towne
dialog: 
text: FULL SCREEN PHOTOGRAPH Grainy but unmistakably a man and
text: woman making love. Photograph shakes. SOUND of a man MOANING
text: in anguish. The photograph is dropped, REVEALING ANOTHER,
text: MORE compromising one. Then another, and another. More moans.
speaker_heading: CURLY'S VOICE
dialog: (crying out)
dialog: Oh, no.
scene_heading: INT. GITTES' OFFICE
text: CURLY drops the photos on Gittes' desk. Curly towers over
text: GITTES and sweats heavily through his workman's clothes, his
text: breathing progressively more labored. A drop plunks on Gittes'
text: shiny desk top.
text: Gittes notes it. A fan whiffs overhead. Gittes glances up at
text: it. He looks cool and brisk in a white linen suit despite
text: the heat. Never taking his eyes off Curly, he lights a
text: cigarette using a lighter with a "nail" on his desk.
text: Curly, with another anguished sob, turns and rams his fist
text: into the wall, kicking the wastebasket as he does. He starts
text: to sob again, slides along the wall where his fist has left
text: a noticeable dent and its impact has sent the signed photos
text: of several movie stars askew.
text: Curly slides on into the blinds and sinks to his knees. He
text: is weeping heavily now, and is in such pain that he actually
text: bites into the blinds.
text: Gittes doesn't move from his chair.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: All right, enough is enough. You
dialog: can't eat the Venetian blinds, Curly.
dialog: I just had 'em installed on Wednesday.
text: Curly responds slowly, rising to his feet, crying. Gittes
text: reaches into his desk and pulls out a shot glass, quickly
text: selects a cheaper bottle of bourbon from several fifths of
dialog: more expensive whiskeys.
text: Gittes pours a large shot. He shoves the glass across his
text: desk toward Curly.
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: Down the hatch.
text: Curly stares dumbly at it. Then picks it up, and drains it.
text: He sinks back into the chair opposite Gittes, begins to cry
dialog: quietly.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: (drinking, relaxing a
dialog: little)
dialog: She's just no good.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: What can I tell you, Kid? You're
dialog: right. When you're right, you're
dialog: right, and you're right.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Ain't worth thinking about.
text: Gittes leaves the bottle with Curly.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: You're absolutely right, I wouldn't
dialog: give her another thought.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: (pouring himself)
dialog: You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I
dialog: know it's your job, but you're okay.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (settling back,
dialog: breathing a little
dialog: easier)
dialog: Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Thanks. You know something, Jake?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: What's that, Curly?
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: I think I'll kill her.
scene_heading: INT. DUFFY &amp; WALSH'S OFFICE
text: Noticeably less plush than Gitte's. A well-groomed, dark-
text: haired WOMAN sits nervously between their two desks, fiddling
text: with the veil on her pillbox hat.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I was hoping Mr. Gittes could see to
dialog: this personally.
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: (almost the manner of
dialog: someone comforting
dialog: the bereaved)
dialog: If you'll allow us to complete our
dialog: preliminary questioning, by then
dialog: he'll be free.
text: There is the SOUND of ANOTHER MOAN coming from Gittes' Office.
text: Something made of glass shatters. The Woman grows more edgy.
scene_heading: INT. GITTES' OFFICE  GITTES &amp; CURLY
text: Gittes and Curly stand in front of the desk, Gittes staring
text: contemptuously at the heavy breathing hulk towering over
text: him. Gittes takes a handkerchief and wipes away the plunk of
text: perspiration on his desk.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: (crying)
dialog: They don't kill a guy for that.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Oh they don't?
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Not for your wife. That's the
dialog: unwritten law.
text: Gittes pounds the photos on the desk, shouting;
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I'll tell you the unwritten law, you
dialog: dumb son of a bitch, you gotta be
dialog: rich to kill somebody, anybody and
dialog: get away with it. You think you got
dialog: that kind of dough, you think you
dialog: got that kind of class?
text: Curly shrinks back a little.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: ...No...
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: You bet your ass you don't. You can't
dialog: even pay me off.
text: This seems to upset Curly even more.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: I'll pay the rest next trip. We only
dialog: caught sixty ton of skipjack around
dialog: San Benedict. We hit a chubasco,
dialog: they don't pay you for skipjack the
dialog: way they do for tuna or albacore.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (easing him out of
dialog: his office)
dialog: Forget it. I only mention it to
dialog: illustrate a point...
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE RECEPTION
text: He's now walking him past SOPHIE who pointedly averts her
text: gaze. He opens the door where on the pebbled glass can be
scene_heading: read: "J. J. GITTES and Associates. DISCREET INVESTIGATION"
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I don't want your last dime.
text: He throws an arm around Curly and flashes a dazzling smile.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What kind of guy do you think I am?
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Call me Jake. Careful driving home,
dialog: Curly.
text: He shuts the door on him and the smile disappears.
text: He shakes his head, starting to swear under his breath.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: A Mrs. Mulwray is waiting for you,
dialog: with Mr. Walsh and Mr. Duffy.
text: Gittes nods, walks on in.
scene_heading: INT. DUFFY AND WALSH'S OFFICE
text: Walsh rises when Gittes enters.
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: Mrs. Mulwray, may I present Mr.
dialog: Gittes?
text: Gittes walks over to her and again flashes a warm, sympathetic
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
scene_heading: MRS. MULWRAY
dialog: Mr. Gittes...
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to be
dialog: the problem?
text: She holds her breath. The revelation isn't easy for her.
scene_heading: MRS. MULWRAY
dialog: My husband, I believe, is seeing
text: another woman.
text: Gittes looks mildly shocked. He turns for confirmation to
dialog: his two partners.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (gravely)
dialog: No, really?
scene_heading: MRS. MULWRAY
dialog: I'm afraid so.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I am sorry.
text: Gittes pulls up a chair sitting next to Mrs. Mulwray between
text: Duffy and Walsh. Duffy cracks his gum.
text: Gittes gives him an irritated glance. Duffy stops chewing.
scene_heading: MRS. MULWRAY
dialog: Can't we talk about this alone, Mr.
dialog: Gittes?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These
dialog: men are my operatives and at some
dialog: point they're going to assist me. I
dialog: can't do everything myself.
scene_heading: MRS. MULWRAY
dialog: Of course not.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Now, what makes you certain he is
dialog: involved with someone?
text: Mrs. Mulwray hesitates. She seems uncommonly nervous at the
dialog: question.
scene_heading: MRS. MULWRAY
dialog: A wife can tell.
text: Gittes sighs.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your
dialog: husband?
scene_heading: MRS. MULWRAY
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: ...Yes of course.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (deliberately)
dialog: Then go home and forget about it.
scene_heading: MRS. MULWRAY
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: (staring intently at
dialog: her)
dialog: I'm sure he loves you, too. You know
dialog: the expression, let sleeping dogs
dialog: lie? You're better off not knowing.
scene_heading: MRS. MULWRAY
dialog: (with some real anxiety)
dialog: But I have to know.
text: Her intensity is genuine. Gittes looks to his two partners.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: All right, what's your husband's
dialog: first name?
scene_heading: MRS. MULWRAY
dialog: Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (visibly surprised)
dialog: Water and Power?
text: Mrs. Mulwray nods, almost shyly. Gittes is now casually but
text: carefully checking out the detailing of Mrs. Mulwray's dress
dialog:  her handbag, shoes, etc.
scene_heading: MRS. MULWRAY
dialog: He's the Chief Engineer.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: (a little eagerly)
dialog: Chief Engineer?
text: Gittes' glance tells Duffy Gittes wants to do the questioning.
text: Mrs. Mulwray nods.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (confidentially)
dialog: This type of investigation can be
dialog: hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray.
dialog: It takes time.
scene_heading: MRS. MULWRAY
dialog: Money doesn't matter to me, Mr.
dialog: Gittes.
text: Gittes sighs.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Very well. We'll see what we can do.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY HALL  MORNING
text: Already shimmering with heat.
text: A drunk blows his nose with his fingers into the fountain at
text: the foot of the steps.
text: Gittes, impeccably dressed, passes the drunk on the way up
dialog: the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS
text: Former Mayor SAM BAGBY is speaking. Behind him is a huge
text: map, with overleafs and bold lettering:
scene_heading: "PROPOSED ALTO VALLEJO DAM AND RESERVOIR"
text: Some of the councilmen are reading funny papers and gossip
text: columns while Bagby is speaking.
speaker_heading: BAGBY
dialog: Gentlemen, today you can walk out
dialog: that door, turn right, hop on a
dialog: streetcar and in twenty-five minutes
text: end up smack in the Pacific Ocean.
dialog: Now you can swim in it, you can fish
dialog: in it, you can sail in it but you
dialog: can't drink it, you can't water your
dialog: lawns with it, you can't irrigate an
dialog: orange grove with it. Remember we
dialog: live next door to the ocean but we
text: also live on the edge of the desert.
dialog: Los Angeles is a desert community.
dialog: Beneath this building, beneath every
dialog: street there's a desert. Without
dialog: water the dust will rise up and cover
dialog: us as though we'd never existed!
dialog: (pausing, letting the
dialog: implication sink in)
speaker_heading: CLOSE  GITTES
text: sitting next to some grubby farmers, bored. He yawns, edges
text: away from one of the dirtier farmers.
speaker_heading: BAGBY (O.S.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: The Alto Vallejo can save us from
dialog: that, and I respectfully suggest
dialog: that eight and a half million dollars
dialog: is a fair price to pay to keep the
dialog: desert from our streets and not on
text: top of them.
scene_heading: AUDIENCE  COUNCIL CHAMBERS
text: An amalgam of farmers, businessmen, and city employees have
text: been listening with keen interest. A couple of the farmers
text: applaud.
text: Somebody shooshes them.
speaker_heading: COUNCIL COMMITTEE
text: In a whispered conference.
speaker_heading: COUNCILMAN
dialog: (acknowledging Bagby)
dialog: Mayor Bagby... let's hear from the
dialog: departments again. I suppose we better
dialog: take Water and Power first. Mr.
dialog: Mulwray.
speaker_heading: REACTION  GITTES
text: Looking up with interest from his racing form.
speaker_heading: MULWRAY
text: Walks to the huge map with overleafs. He is a slender man in
text: his sixties, who wears glasses and moves with surprising
text: fluidity. He turns to a smaller, younger man, and nods. The
text: man turns the overleaf on the map.
speaker_heading: MULWRAY
dialog: In case you've forgotten, gentlemen,
dialog: over five hundred lives were lost
dialog: when the Van der Lip Dam gave way
dialog: core samples have shown that beneath
dialog: this bedrock is shale similar to the
text: permeable shale in the Van der Lip
dialog: disaster. It couldn't withstand
dialog: that kind of pressure there.
dialog: (referring to a new
dialog: overleaf)
dialog: Now you propose yet another dirt
text: banked terminus dam with slopes of
dialog: two and one half to one, one hundred
dialog: twelve feet high and a twelve thousand
dialog: acre water surface. Well, it won't
dialog: hold. I won't build it. It's that
dialog: simple. I am not making that kind of
dialog: mistake twice. Thank you, gentlemen.
text: Mulwray leaves the overleaf board and sits down. Suddenly
text: there are some whoops and hollers from the rear of the
text: chambers and a redfaced FARMER drives in several scrawny,
text: bleating sheep. Naturally, they cause a commotion.
scene_heading: COUNCIL PRESIDENT
dialog: (shouting to farmer)
dialog: What in the hell do you think you're
dialog: doing?
dialog: (as the sheep bleat
text: down the aisles toward
dialog: the Council)
dialog: Get those goddam things out of here!
speaker_heading: FARMER
dialog: (right back)
dialog: Tell me where to take them! You don't
dialog: have an answer for that so quick, do
dialog: you?
text: Bailiffs and sergeants-at-arms respond to the imprecations
dialog: of the Council and attempt to capture the sheep and the
text: farmers, having to restrain one who looks like he's going to
text: bodily attack Mulwray.
speaker_heading: FARMER
dialog: (through above, to
dialog: Mulwray)
dialog: You steal the water from the valley,
dialog: ruin the grazing, starve my livestock
dialog: who's paying you to do that, Mr.
dialog: Mulwray, that's what I want to know!
scene_heading: L.A. RIVERBED  LONG SHOT
text: It's virtually empty. Sun blazes off it's ugly concrete banks.
text: Where the banks are earthen, they are parched and choked
dialog: with weeds.
text: After a moment, Mulwray's car pulls INTO VIEW on a flood
text: control road about fifteen feet above the riverbed. Mulwray
text: gets out of the car. Me looks around.
speaker_heading: WITH GITTES
text: Holding a pair of binoculars, downstream and just above the
text: flood control road using some dried mustard weeds for cover.
text: He watches while Mulwray makes his way down to the center of
text: the riverbed.
text: There Mulwray stops, tuns slowly, appears to be looking at
text: the bottom of the riverbed, or at nothing at all.
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: Trains the binoculars on him. Sun glints off Mulwray's
dialog: glasses.
speaker_heading: BELOW GITTES
text: There's the SOUND of something like champagne corks popping.
text: Then a small Mexican boy atop a swayback horse rides it into
text: the riverbed, and into Gitte's view.
speaker_heading: MULWRAY
text: Himself stops, stands still when he hears the sound. Power
text: lines and the sun are overhead, the trickle of brackish water
text: at his feet.
text: He moves swiftly downstream in the direction of the sound,
text: toward Gittes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: Moves a little further back as Mulwray rounds the bend in
text: the river and comes face to face with the Mexican boy on the
text: muddy banks.
text: Mulwray says something to the boy.
text: The boy doesn't answer at first. Mulwray points to the ground.
text: The boy gestures. Mulwray frowns. He kneels down in the mud
text: and stares at it. He seems to be concentrating on it.
text: After a moment, he rises, thanks the boy and heads swiftly
text: back upstream  scrambling up the bank to his car.
text: There he reaches through the window and pulls out a roll of
text: blueprints or something like them. He spreads them on the
text: hood of his car and begins to scribble some notes, looking
dialog: downstream from time to time.
text: The power lines overhead HUM.
text: He stops, listens to them then rolls up the plans and gets
text: back in the car. He drives off.
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: Hurries to get back to his car. He gets in and gets right
dialog: back out.
text: The steamy leather burns him. He takes a towel from the back
text: seat and carefully places it on the front one. He gets in
text: and takes off.
scene_heading: POINT FERMIN PARK  DUSK
text: Street lights go on.
speaker_heading: MULWRAY
text: Pulls up, parks. Hurries out of the car, across the park
text: lawn and into the shade of some trees and buildings.
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: Pulls up, moves across the park at a different angle, but in
text: the direction Mulwray had gone. He makes it through the trees
text: in time to see Mulwray scramble adroitly down the side of
text: the cliff to the beach below. Be seems in a hurry. Gittes
text: moves after him, having a little more difficulty negotiating
dialog: the climb than Mulwray did.
text: DOWN ON THE BEACH
text: Gittes looks to his right where the bay is a long, clear
text: crescent.
text: He looks to his left. There's a promontory of sorts. It's
text: apparent Mulwray has gone that way. Gittes hesitates, then
text: moves in that direction but climbs along the promontory in
dialog: order to be above Mulwray.
speaker_heading: AT THE OUTFALL
text: Gittes spots Mulwray just below him, kicking at the sand.
text: Mulwray picks up a starfish. Brushes the sand off it. Looks
text: absently up toward Gittes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: Backs away, sits near the outfall, yawns.
scene_heading: BEACON LIGHT AT POINT FERMIN
text: Flashing in the dust.
speaker_heading: CLOSE  GITTES
text: Sitting, suddenly starts. He swears softly. He's in a puddle
text: of water and the seat of his trousers is wet.
speaker_heading: MULWRAY
text: Below him in watching the water trickling down from the
text: outfall near Gittes.
text: Mulwray stands and stares at the water, apparently fascinated.
text: Even as Gittes watches Mulwray watching, the volume and
text: velocity seem to increase until it gushes in spurts, cascading
text: into the sea, whipping it into a foam.
text: AT THE STREET  GITTES' CAR
text: There's a slip of paper stuck under the windshield wiper.
text: Gittes pulls it off, gets in the car and turns on the dash
dialog: light. It says:
text: "SAVE OUR CITY! LOS ANGELES IS DYING OF THIRST! PROTECT YOUR
text: PROPERTY! LOS ANGELES IS YOUR INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE!!!
text: VOTE YES NOVEMBER 6... CITIZENS COMMITTEE TO SAVE OUR CITY,
scene_heading: HON. SAM BAGBY, FORMER MAYOR  CHAIRMAN." Gittes grumbles,
text: crumples it up and tosses it out the window. He notices other
text: flyers parked on a couple of cars down the street.
text: Gittes reaches down and opens his glove compartment.
scene_heading: INT. GLOVE COMPARTMENT
text: Consists of a small mountain of Ingersoll pocket watches.
text: The cheap price tags are still on them. Gittes pulls out
dialog: one.
text: He absently winds it, checks the time with his own watch.
text: It's 9:37 as he walks to Mulwray's car and places it behind
text: the front wheel of Mulwray's car. He yawns again and heads
text: back to his own car.
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: Arrives whistling, opens the door with "J.J. GITTES AND
text: ASSOCIATES  DISCREET INVESTIGATION" on it.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Morning, Sophie.
text: Sophie hands him a small pile of messages. He goes through
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Walsh here?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
text: He's in the dark room.
text: Gittes walks through his office to Duffy and Walsh's. A little
text: red light is on in the corner, over a closed door. Gittes
text: walks over and knocks on the door.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Where'd he go yesterday?
speaker_heading: WALSH'S VOICE
text: Three reservoirs. Men's room of a
dialog: Richfield gas station on Flower, and
dialog: the Pig 'n Whistle.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Jesus Christ, this guy's really got
text: water on the brain.
speaker_heading: WALSH'S VOICE
dialog: What'd you expect? That's his job.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Listen, we can't string this broad
dialog: out indefinitely we got to come up
dialog: with something.
speaker_heading: WALSH'S VOICE
dialog: I think I got something.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
scene_heading: INT. DUFFY &amp; WALSH'S OFFICE  GITTES
speaker_heading: WALSH'S VOICE
dialog: It's on your desk. Say, you hear the
dialog: one about the guy who goes to the
dialog: North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking
dialog: for penguins?
text: Gittes walks to his office.
speaker_heading: ON HIS DESK
text: Is the Ingersoll watch, the crystal broken, the hands stopped
dialog: at 2:47.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: He was there all night.
text: Gittes drops it, sits down. Walsh comes in carrying a series
text: of wet photos stuck with clothes pins onto a small blackboard.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing; eagerly)
dialog: So what you got?
text: Walsh shows him the photos. He looks at them. They are a
text: series outside a restaurant showing Mulwray with another man
text: whose appearance is striking. In two of the photos a gnarled
text: cane is visible.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing; obviously
dialog: annoyed)
dialog: This?
speaker_heading: WALSH
text: They got into a terrific argument
text: outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: What about?
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: I don't know. The traffic was pretty
dialog: loud. I only heard one thing  apple
dialog: core.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Apple core?
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: INT. GITTES' OFFICE
text: Gittes tosses down the photos in disgust.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you
dialog: spent your day doing?
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: Look, you tell me to take pictures,
dialog: I take pictures.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Let me explain something to you,
dialog: Walsh. This business requires a
dialog: certain finesse.
text: The PHONE has been RINGING. Sophie buzzes him.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah, Sophie?
dialog: (he picks up the phone)
dialog: Duffy, where are you?
text: Duffy's VOICE can be HEARD, excitedly. "I got it. I got it.
text: He's found himself some cute little twist in a rowboat, in
dialog: Echo Park."
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Okay, slow down  Echo Park.
dialog: (to Walsh)
dialog: Jesus, water again.
speaker_heading: WESTLAKE PARK (MCARTHUR PARK)
text: Duffy is rowing, Gittes seated in the stern.
text: They pass Mulwray and a slender blonde girl in a summer print
text: dress, drifting in their rowboat, Mulwray fondly doting on
dialog: the girl.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (to Duffy, as they
dialog: pass)
dialog: Let's have a big smile, pal.
text: He shoots past Duffy, expertly running off a couple of fast
dialog: shots.
text: Mulwray and the girl seem blissfully unaware of them.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
text: Turns again and they row past Mulwray and the girl, Gittes
text: again clicking off several fast shots.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT  SIGN:
scene_heading: "EL MACANDO APARTMENTS"
text: MOVE ALONG the red tiled roof and down to a lower level of
text: the roof where Gittes' feet are hooked over the apex of the
text: roof and Gittes himself is stretched face downward on the
text: tiles, pointing himself and his camera to a veranda below
text: him where the girl and Mulwray are eating. Gittes is clicking
text: off more shots when the tiles his feet are hooked over come
dialog: loose.
text: Gittes begins a slow slide down the tile to the edge of the
text: roof and possibly over it to a three-story drop. He tries to
text: slow himself down. The loose tile also begins to slide.
text: Gittes stops himself at the roof's edge by the storm drain
text: and begins a very precarious turn, this time hooking his
text: feet in the drain itself. The loose tile falls and hits the
text: veranda below. He stops as it's about to slide over the edge.
text: He carefully lays it in the drain. But a fragment off the
text: cracked edge of the tile falls.
scene_heading: WITH MULWRAY AND THE GIRL
text: Mulwray staring at the fragment at his feet. He looks to the
dialog: girl.
text: He's clearly concerned. He rises, looks up to the roof.
speaker_heading: FROM HIS POV
text: The roof and the sign topping it betray nothing. He slowly
text: sits back down, staring at the tile fragment.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT  NEWSPAPER "DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER BLOWS
text: FUSE OVER CHIEF'S USE OF FUNDS FOR EL MACANDO LOVE NEST."
text: In the style of the Hearst yellow press, there is a heart-
text: shaped drawing around one of the photos that Gittes had taken.
text: Next to it is a smaller column, "J.J. Gittes hired by
dialog: suspicious spouse."
scene_heading: INT. BARBERSHOP  GITTES
text: Holds the paper and reads while getting his haircut and his
text: shoes shined. In fact, almost all the customers are reading
dialog: papers.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: (to Gittes)
dialog: When you get so much publicity, after
dialog: a while you must get blasé about it.
text: A self-satisfied smile comes to Gittes' face.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Face it. You're practically a movie
dialog: star.
text: In b.g., customers can be OVERHEARD talking about the drought.
text: Interspersed with above, someone is saying, "They're gonna
dialog: start rationing water unless it rains." Someone else says,
dialog: "Only for washing your cars." Third says, "You're not going
dialog: to be able to water your lawn either, or take a bath more
dialog: than once a week." First says, "If you don't have a lawn or
dialog: a car, do you get an extra bath?"
text: Gittes has been staring outside the barbershop. A car is
dialog: stalled.
text: The hood is up. A man watches his radiator boiling over.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Look at that.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Heat's murder.
speaker_heading: OTHER CUSTOMER
dialog: (end of conversation)
dialog: Fools names and fools faces...
text: Gittes has heard the word. He straightens up.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (smiling; to Other
dialog: Customer)
dialog: What's that, pal?
speaker_heading: OTHER CUSTOMER
dialog: (indicating paper)
dialog: Nothing. You got a hell of a way to
dialog: make a living.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
speaker_heading: OTHER CUSTOMER
dialog: Mortgage Department, First National
dialog: Bank.
text: Gittes laughs.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Tell me, how many people a week do
dialog: you foreclose on?
speaker_heading: OTHER CUSTOMER
dialog: We don't publish a record in the
dialog: paper, I can tell you that.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Neither do I.
speaker_heading: OTHER CUSTOMER
dialog: No, you have a press agent do it.
text: Gittes gets out of the chair. Barney, a little concerned,
text: tries to restrain him, holding onto the barber sheet around
text: Gittes' neck.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Barney, who is this bimbo? He a
dialog: regular customer?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Take it easy, Jake.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Look, pal. I make an honest living.
dialog: People don't come to me unless they're
dialog: miserable and I help 'em out of a
dialog: bad situation. I don't kick them out
dialog: of their homes like you jerks who
dialog: work in the bank.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Jake, for Christ's sake.
text: Gittes is trying to take off his sheet.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: C'mon, get out of the barber chair.
dialog: We'll go outside and talk this over.
text: The Customer is shrinking back into the chair.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Hey, c'mon, Jake. Sit down. Sit down.
dialog: You hear about the fella goes to his
dialog: friend and says, 'What'll I do, I'm
dialog: tired of screwing my wife?' and his
dialog: friend says, 'Whyn't you do what the
dialog: Chinese do?'
text: Gittes allows himself to be tugged back to his chair.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I don't know how that got in the
dialog: paper as a matter of fact  it
dialog: surprised me it was so quick. I make
dialog: an honest living.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: 'Course you do, Jake.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: An honest living.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do
dialog: what the Chinese do?'
scene_heading: INT. GITTES' OFFICE
text: Gittes comes bursting in, slapping a newspapers on his thigh.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Duffy, Walsh.
text: Walsh comes out of his office, Duffy out of the other one.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Sophie, go to the little girl's room
dialog: for a minute.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: But, Mr. Gittes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (insisting)
dialog: Sophie.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Yes, Mr. Gittes.
text: She gets up and leaves.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: So there's this fella who's tired of
text: screwing his wife.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Jake, listen.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a
dialog: hurry and his friend says why not do
dialog: what the Chinese do? So he says what
dialog: do they do? His friend says the
dialog: Chinese they screw for a while. Just
dialog: listen a second, Duffy...
text: A stunning YOUNG WOMAN appears behind Gittes in his doorway.
text: She's shortly joined by a small, GRAY-HAIRED MAN. They listen,
text: unseen by Gittes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
text: ...and then they stop and they read
dialog: a little Confucius and they screw
text: some more and they stop and they
dialog: smoke some opium and then they go
dialog: back and screw some more and they
text: stop again and they contemplate the
dialog: moon or something and it makes it
dialog: more exciting. So this other guy
text: goes home to screw his wife and after
text: a while he stops and gets up and
text: goes into the other room only he
dialog: reads Life Magazine and he goes back
text: and he screws some more and suddenly
dialog: says excuse me a second and he gets
text: up and smokes a cigarette and he
text: goes back and by this time his wife
text: is getting sore as hell. So he screws
text: some more and then he gets up to
dialog: look at the moon and his wife says,
dialog: 'What the hell do you think you're
dialog: doing?
dialog: (Gittes breaks up)
dialog: ...you're screwing like a Chinaman.'
text: Gittes hangs onto Sophie's desk laughing his ass off. The
text: little Gray-Haired Man winces. When Gittes looks up he sees
text: the Young Woman, apparently in her late twenties. She's so
text: stunning that Gittes nearly gasps.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Mr. Gittes?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Do you know me?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Well... I think I... I would've
dialog: remembered.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Have we ever met?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Well, no.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Never?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Never.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: That's what I thought. You see, I'm
dialog: Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray. You know, Mr.
dialog: Mulwray's wife.
text: Gittes is staggered. He glances down at the newspaper.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Not that Mulwray?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And
dialog: since you agree with me we've never
dialog: met, you must also agree that I
dialog: haven't hired you to do anything.
dialog: Certainly not spy on my husband. I
dialog: see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes.
dialog: Well, you're going to get it.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...
text: She's walked past him toward the door. He stop her.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...there's some misunderstanding
dialog: here. It's not going to do any good
dialog: to get tough with me.
text: Evelyn flashes a cold smile.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I don't get tough with anybody, Mr.
dialog: Gittes. My lawyer does.
text: Evelyn starts out the door and Gittes starts after her. This
text: time he's stopped by the Gray-Haired Man who has also come
text: out of his office and up behind him.
scene_heading: GRAY-HAIRED MAN
dialog: Here's something for you, Mr. Gittes.
text: Gittes turns to be handed a thick sheaf of papers, a summons
text: and complaint. Evelyn walks out the door.
scene_heading: GRAY-HAIRED MAN
dialog: (continuing; pleasantly)
dialog: I suppose we'll be hearing from your
dialog: attorney.
text: Gittes stares down at the papers in his hand.
scene_heading: INT. GITTES' INNER OFFICE  GITTES, DUFFY &amp; WALSH
text: On Gittes' desk. There are empty coffee cups, the summons
dialog: and complaint, and the newspaper Gittes had brought with him
text: from the barber shop.
text: The three men are sitting, worn and silent. Walsh chewing
text: gum is the loudest noise in the room.
text: Gittes looks to Walsh with obvious irritation. Walsh stops
dialog: chewing.
text: Duffy puts out a cigarette in the dregs of one of the coffee
dialog: cups.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (to Duffy)
dialog: There's seven ashtrays in this room,
dialog: Duffy.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: That's a filthy habit.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: I said okay, Jake.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here
dialog: saying she was Shirley Temple you'd
dialog: say okay to that, too.
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's
dialog: real phone number and address.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: All she needed for that was the phone
dialog: book!
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: No, no. She said not to call, her
dialog: husband might answer.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: When I find out who that phony bitch
dialog: was.
text: Gittes is staring down at the newspaper. He suddenly grabs
text: the phone, begins dialing. A tight little smile breaks out
text: on his face.
text: He buzzes Sophie.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Sophie.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Yes, Mr. Gittes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Get me the Times. Whitey Mehrholtz.
dialog: (as he waits)
dialog: And how about that snotty broad?
dialog: (the phone to his ear)
dialog: What does she think, she's perfect?
text: Coming in waving her lawyers and her
dialog: money at me  so goddam smug. She's
dialog: no better than anybody else in this
dialog: town.
text: Sophie BUZZES.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Whitey, what's new, pal?... Yeah,
dialog: listen, where did you get those
dialog: photographs... Yeah, blowing a fuse
dialog: over the El Macando love nest. That's
dialog: cute, Whitey... so who sent them to
dialog: you... I sent them?
dialog: (Gittes laughs a little
dialog: hysterically)
dialog: Why would I be asking how you got
dialog: them if I sent them?... Whitey?...
dialog: Whitey?... C'mon, level with me for
dialog: once, my tit's in the wringer and
dialog: it's beginning to hurt... yeah...
dialog: yeah... yeah.
text: He hangs up.
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: So he says you sent them?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: They're all a bunch of phonies.
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT WATER &amp; POWER  HALL
text: Gittes stops outside a door marked:
scene_heading: "HOLLIS J. MULWRAY CHIEF ENGINEER"
text: He enters an outer office. The SECRETARY looks surprised.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Mr. Mulwray, please.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: He's not in, Mr.?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Gittes.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: May I ask what this is regarding?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: It's personal. Has he been out long?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Since lunch.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Gee whiz.
text: (he glances at his
dialog: watch)
dialog: And I'm late.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: He was expecting you?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go
dialog: in and wait?
text: Without waiting for a response, he does. The Secretary half
text: rises in protest but Gittes is through the inner door.
scene_heading: MULWRAY'S INNER OFFICE
text: The walls are covered with commendation, photos of Mulwray
text: at various construction sites, large maps of watershed areas
text: and reservoirs in the city. On the desk is a framed, tinted
text: photo of Evelyn in riding clothes.
text: Gittes moves to the desk, watching the translucent pane in
text: the upper half of the door leading to the outer office as he
dialog: does.
text: He begins to open and close the desk drawers after quickly
text: examining the top. He tries one of the drawers and it doesn't
dialog: open.
text: He reopens the top drawer, and the bottom one opens.
text: He looks in it, pulls out a checkbook. He opens it, riffles
text: through the stubs like he was shuffling cards. Drops it,
text: finds a set of keys, an old phone book, and a menu from a
text: Water Department lunch at the Biltmore Hotel in 1913. Then,
text: He flips through them, reads one notation in Mulwray's neat
dialog: hand:
dialog: "Tues. night. Oak Pass Res. 7 channels used."
text: Gittes spots a shadow looming in front of the translucent
text: pane. He quickly tosses item after item back, kneeing the
text: drawer, nearly knocking a spare pair of Mulwray's glasses
text: off the desk top when he does. He catches them, puts them on
text: the desk and is pacing the room as the door opens.
scene_heading: RUSS YELBURTON
text: Enters the room. An anxious Secretary is right behind him.
speaker_heading: YELBURTON
dialog: Can I help you?
dialog: (extending his hand)
dialog: Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the
dialog: Department.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (equally pleasant)
dialog: J.J. Gittes. And it's not a
dialog: departmental matter.
speaker_heading: YELBURTON
dialog: I wonder if you'd care to wait in my
dialog: office?
text: This is more a request than an invitation. Gittes nods,
text: follows Yelburton out, through the outer office to his offices
text: down the hall.
speaker_heading: YELBURTON
dialog: (continuing; as they're
dialog: going)
dialog: You see, this whole business in the
dialog: paper with Mr. Mulwray has us all on
dialog: edge.
scene_heading: INT. YELBURTON OFFICE
text: Smaller than Mulwray's, he has most noticeably a lacquered
text: marlin mounted on the wall. There are a couple of other
text: pictures of Yelburton with yellowtail and other fish he's
text: standing beside.
text: There's also a small burgee of a fish with the initials A.C.
text: below it, tacked onto the wall.
speaker_heading: YELBURTON
dialog: After all, you work with a man for a
dialog: certain length of time, you come to
dialog: know him, his habits, his values,
dialog: and so forth. Well either he's the
dialog: kind who chases after women or he
dialog: isn't.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: And Mulwray isn't?
speaker_heading: YELBURTON
dialog: He never even kids about it.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Maybe he takes it very seriously.
text: Gittes winks. Yelburton chuckles appreciatively, loosening
text: up a little.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: You don't happen to know where Mr.
dialog: Mulwray's having lunch?
speaker_heading: YELBURTON
dialog: I'm sorry, I --
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Well, tell him I'll be back.
text: Gittes spots a card tray on Yelburton's desk.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Mind if I take one of your cards?
dialog: In case I want to get in touch with
dialog: you again.
speaker_heading: YELBURTON
dialog: Help yourself.
text: Gittes fishes a couple off the tray, puts them in his
text: handkerchief pocket. He goes out the door, nearly running
text: into a man who is standing by the Secretary's desk, about
text: GITTES' age only a head taller and a foot wider, dressed in
text: a plain suit that fits him about as well as a brown paper
dialog: bag.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Mulvihlll, what are you doing here?
scene_heading: OUTER OFFICE  YELBURTON, MULVIHILL AND GITTES
text: Mulvihill stares at Gittes with unblinking eyes, remains by
dialog: the desk.
speaker_heading: MULVIHILL
dialog: They shut my water off, what's it to
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: How'd you find out? You don't drink
dialog: it, you don't take a bath in it,
dialog: maybe they sent you a letter. Ah,
dialog: but then you'd have to be able to
dialog: read.
text: Mulvihill moves toward Gittes, shaking with fury. Yelburton
text: steps between them.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.
dialog: (to Yelburton)
dialog: Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
speaker_heading: YELBURTON
dialog: Hope so. He's working for us.
scene_heading: EXT. MULWRAY HOUSE  GITTES
text: Rings the bell. He waits.
text: A powerful CHINESE BUTLER with heavy hair and a half-jacket
text: of gold on one front tooth, answers the door.
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Mulwray.
text: He hands the Chinese Butler a card from his wallet. The Butler
text: takes it and disappears, leaving Gittes standing in the
dialog: doorway.
text: Gittes stands, and sweats, watching a Japanese GARDENER trim
text: a hedge. There's a SQUEAKING SOUND. Gittes moves a few feet
text: off the porch.
speaker_heading: POV  GARAGE
text: A chauffeur is washing down a cream-colored Packard with a
dialog: chamois.
text: Steam rises off the hood. The squeaking has obviously come
dialog: from the chamois.
speaker_heading: CHINESE BUTLER
text: In doorway.
speaker_heading: CHINESE BUTLER
dialog: Please.
text: Gittes looks behind him. The Chinese Butler is gesturing for
dialog: him to follow.
text: THROUGH THE HOUSE  GITTES
text: Follows him, trying to check out the rooms as he goes. A
text: maid is cleaning in the den. They pass through it out some
text: French doors along a trellised walkway to a large pond with
text: running water.
speaker_heading: CHINESE BUTLER
dialog: You wait, please.
text: Gittes is left standing by the pond. It's suddenly very quiet
text: except for the runnning water. The pond is over-flowing.
text: After a moment, the Gardener comes running back. He smiles
text: at Gittes, probes into the pond.
text: There's something gleaming in the bottom of it. Gittes notes
dialog: it.
text: After a moment, the Gardener drops the long probe, the waters
text: recede.
scene_heading: EXT. POND  GITTES AND JAPANESE GARDENER  DAY
speaker_heading: GARDENER
dialog: (to Gittes)
dialog: Bad for glass.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (not understanding)
dialog: Yeah sure. Bad for glass.
text: The Gardener nods, and is off, leaving Gittes staring at the
text: object in the bottom of the pond that is gleaming.
text: He looks at the tool the Gardener was using, hesitates, picks
text: it up and starts to probe into the pond himself, toward the
text: gleaming object.
text: He then spots Evelyn rounding a turn, coming down the
text: trellised pathway. He casually belts the probe, holds onto
dialog: it for poise.
text: Evelyn is wearing jeans that are lathered white on the inside
text: of the thighs and laced with brown horsehair.
text: She's wearing riding boots, is perspiring a little, but looks
text: younger than she did in the office.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Yes, Mr. Gittes?
text: Gittes is a little taken aback at seeing Evelyn. He is annoyed
text: as well. Nevertheless, he is elaborately polite.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Actually, I'm here to see your
dialog: husband, Mrs. Mulwray.
text: He laughs. a little nervously. He waits for a reply. There
dialog: is none.
text: The Chinese Butler appears on the veranda.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Would you like something to drink?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: What are you having?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
text: Iced tea.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah. Fine, thank you.
text: Chinese Butler nods, disappears
scene_heading: EXT. POND AND GARDEN  MULWRAY HOUSE  DAY
text: Evelyn sits at a glass-topped table. Gittes Joins her.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: My husband's at the office.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Actually he's not. And he's moved
text: from his apartment at the El Macando.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: That's not his apartment.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs.
dialog: Mulwray. I'm not in business to be
dialog: loved, but I am in business, and
dialog: believe me, whoever set up your
dialog: husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small
dialog: town, people talk.
text: He waits for a response. Then:
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing; uneasily)
dialog: I'm just trying to make a living,
dialog: and I don't want to become a local
dialog: Joke.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into
dialog: it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I said I'll drop it.
text: The iced tea comes on a tray which Ramon sets down between
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (continuing; pleasantly)
dialog: So let's just drop the whole thing.
dialog: Sugar? Lemon?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Mrs. Mulwray?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (as she's mixing one
dialog: of the drinks)
dialog: Yes, Mr. Gittes?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I don't want to drop it.
text: Evelyn looks up. Gittes smiles a little sheepishly.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I should talk this over with your
dialog: husband.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (a little concerned)
dialog: Why?... What on earth for? Look,
dialog: Hollis seems to think you're an
dialog: innocent man.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Well, I've been accused of many
dialog: things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.
text: Again he laughs a little nervously. Again no reaction.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You see, somebody went to a lot of
dialog: trouble here, and I want to find
dialog: out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not
dialog: the one who's supposed to be caught
dialog: with my pants down... so I'd like to
dialog: see your husband. Unless that's a
dialog: problem.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (with a slight edge)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (determined to be
dialog: polite)
dialog: Well, that little girlfriend, she
dialog: was attractive in a cheap sort of
dialog: way of course. She's disappeared.
dialog: Maybe they disappeared together
dialog: somewhere.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (with rising anger)
dialog: Suppose they did. How does it concern
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I
dialog: just --
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: It's very personal. It couldn't be
dialog: more personal. Is this a business or
dialog: an obsession with you?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Look at it this way. Now this phony
dialog: broad, excuse the language, says
dialog: she's you, she's hired me. Whoever
dialog: put her up to it, didn't have anything
dialog: against me. They were out to get
dialog: your husband. Now if I see him, I
dialog: can help him. Did you talk this
dialog: morning?
text: Evelyn brushes lightly at the horsehair on her Jeans.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: No. I went riding rather early.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Looks like you went quite a distance.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: No, Just riding bareback, that's
dialog: all. Anyway, you might try the Oak
dialog: Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs.
dialog: Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks
dialog: around them. Otherwise he'll be home
dialog: by 6:30.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I'll stop by.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Please call first.

scene_heading: EXT. OAK PASS RESERVOIR  DAY
text: Gittes drives up a winding road, following a flood channel
text: up into the parched hills.
speaker_heading: TWO FIRE TRUCKS
text: One a rescue truck, are at the entrance to the reservoir.
text: The chain link fence with its KEEP OUT sign is open and there
text: are people milling around. The reservoir is below.
text: Gittes' car is stopped by a couple of UNIFORMED POLICE.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Sorry, this is closed to the public,
dialog: sir.
text: Gittes hesitates only a moment, then:
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (to the Guard)
dialog: It's all right. Russ Yelburton, Deputy
dialog: Chief in the Department.
text: He fishes out one of Yelburton's cards from his handkerchief
text: pocket, hands it to the Guard.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Sorry, Mr. Yelburton. Go on down.
text: Gittes drives past the Guards, through the gate, along the
text: reservoir. He spots a police car and an unmarked one as well.
text: Gittes stops and gets out of the car. Several men with their
text: backs turned, one talking quietly, staring down into the
text: reservoir where other men in small skiffs are apparently
text: dredging for something.
text: One of the men turns and sees Gittes. He recognizes Gittes
text: and is visibly shocked.
speaker_heading: LOACH
dialog: Gittes, for Chrissakes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Loach.
speaker_heading: LOACH
dialog: (moving to Gittes,
dialog: taking him by the

dialog: C'mon, get out of here before --
scene_heading: EXT. RESERVOIR  DAY
text: Loach tries to ease him down the path.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Before what? What the hell's going
dialog: on?
text: At the sound of his raised voice, a man standing at the edge
text: of the channel, talking to two boys in swimming trunks, turns
text: around. He's a tall, sleek Mexican in his early thirties,
speaker_heading: LUIS ESCOBAR.
text: Both Gittes and Escobar register considerable surprise at
text: seeing one another. The men around them are extremely uneasy.
text: Loach is actually sweating. Finally, Escobar smiles.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Hello, Jake.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (without smiling)
dialog: How are you, Lou?
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: I have a cold I can't seem to shake
dialog: but other than that, I'm fine.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Summer colds are the worst.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Yeah, they are.
text: Gittes reaches into his pocket, pulls out his cigarette case.
speaker_heading: A FIREMAN
dialog: No smoking, sir. It's a fire hazard
dialog: this time of year.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: I think we can make an exception.
dialog: I'll see he's careful with the
dialog: matches.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (lighting up)
dialog: Thanks, Lou.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: How'd you get past the guards?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Well, to tell you the truth, I lied
dialog: a little.
text: Escobar nods. They walk a couple of steps. The other police,
text: two plainclothesmen and a uniformed officer, watch them.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: You've done well by yourself.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I get by.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Well, sometimes it takes a while for
dialog: a man to find himself and I guess
dialog: you have.
speaker_heading: LOACH
dialog: Poking around in other people's dirty
dialog: linen.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah. Tell me, you still throw
text: Chinamen into jail for spitting on
dialog: the laundry?
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: You're behind the times, Jake. They've
dialog: got steam irons now.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: And I'm out of Chinatown.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Since when?
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Since I made Lieutenant.
text: It's apparent Gittes is impressed despite himself.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Congratulations.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Looking for someone.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Oh yes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I'd like to talk to him.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: You're welcome to try. There he is.
text: Escobar points down to the reservoir. A couple of men using
text: poles with hooks are fishing about in the water. It can be
text: SEEN that one of them has hooked something.
text: He shouts. The other man hooks it, too. They pull, revealing
text: the soaking back of a man's coat. They start to pull the
text: body into the skiff.
scene_heading: INT. CORONER'S OFFICE  EVELYN AND ESCOBAR
text: Are standing over the body of Mulwray. Escobar has the sheet
text: drawn back. Evelyn nods.
text: Escobar drops the sheet. Escobar and Evelyn move a few feet
text: to one side and whisper, almost as though they were trying
dialog: to keep the corpse from hearing them.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
text: It looks like he was washed the entire
dialog: length of the runoff channel. Could
dialog: he swim?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Obviously the fall must have knocked
dialog: him out.
text: Evelyn nods slightly Escobar coughs. A coroner's assistant
text: wheels the body out of the office.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: This alleged affair he was having.
dialog: The publicity didn't make him morose
dialog: or unhappy?
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE CORONER'S
text: Gittes has been sitting on a wooden bench, smoking and
text: listening. At this question, he rises and looks through the
dialog: doorway.
text: Escobar sees him, ignores him. Evelyn doesn't see him.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: ...Well, it didn't make him happy...
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: But there is no possibility he would
dialog: have taken his own life?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: (a little uncomfortably
dialog: now)
dialog: Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know
dialog: the name of the young woman in
dialog: question?
text: Evelyn shows a flash of annoyance.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Do you know where she might be?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Certainly not!
text: Escobar and Evelyn move slowly toward the door.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: You and your husband never discussed
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (stopping, faltering)
dialog: He... we did... he wouldn't tell me
dialog: her name. We quarreled over her...
dialog: of course. It came as a complete
dialog: surprise to me.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: A complete surprise?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: But I thought you'd hired a private
dialog: investigator.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: A private investigator?
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: (gesturing vaguely
dialog: toward the door)
dialog: Mr. Gittes.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Well yes.
text: Evelyn looks up to see Gittes standing in the doorway only a
text: foot or two from her. She stops cold. They look at one another
text: for a long moment.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (her eyes on Gittes)
dialog: But I... I... did that because I
dialog: thought it was a nasty rumor I'd put
dialog: an end to...
text: She finishes, looks plaintively at Gittes. Escobar is right
text: at her back. Gittes says nothing.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: And when did Mr. Gittes inform you
dialog: that these rumors had some foundation
dialog: in fact?
text: Evelyn looks at Escobar but doesn't know how to answer him.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (smoothly)
dialog: Just before the story broke in the
dialog: papers, Lou.
text: Escobar nods. They begin to walk slowly, again have to move
text: out of the way as some other corpse is being wheeled out of
text: one of the Coroner cubicles.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: You wouldn't happen to know the
dialog: present whereabouts of the young
dialog: woman.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Or her name?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: No.
text: They have walked a few steps further down the hall.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Will you need me for anything else,
dialog: Lieutenant?
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of
dialog: course you have my deepest sympathy
dialog: and if we need anymore information,
dialog: we'll be in touch.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I'll walk her to her car, be right
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR'S POV
text: Evelyn glances at Gittes. They go through a couple of outer
text: doors and pass several reporters who have been in the outer
text: hall, laughing, kidding, the tag end of lines like "only in
dialog: L.A." and "Southern Cafeteria."
text: Gittes hurries her past the reporters who flank them, asking
text: questions. Gittes brushes them aside.
text: EVELYN AND GITTES  AT HER CAR
text: In a small parking lot.
text: Evelyn fumbles in her bag, looking feverishly for something
text: in her purse.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (flushed, perspiring)
dialog: ...Just a minute...
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (touching her gently)
dialog: You left your keys in the ignition.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Oh... thank you.
text: She glances down, leans against the side of the car.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Thank you for going along with me. I
dialog: just didn't want to explain
dialog: anything... I'll send you a check.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: A check?
text: Evelyn gets in her car.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: To make it official, I hired you.
text: She drives off, leaving Gittes gaping.
scene_heading: INT. CORONER'S OFFICE HALLWAY
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Don't give me that, Lou. You hauled
dialog: me down here for a statement.
text: Escobar shrugs.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: I don't want it anymore.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: No. It was an accident.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: You mean that's what you're going to
dialog: call it.
text: Escobar looks up.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: That's right.
dialog: (contemptuously)
dialog: Out of respect for his civic position.
dialog: Resume walking.
text: Gittes laughs.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: What'd he do, Lou, make a pass at
dialog: your sister?
text: Escobar stops.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: No, he drowned a cousin of mine with
text: about five hundred other people. But
dialog: they weren't very important, just a
dialog: bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a
dialog: dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't
dialog: come out of this smelling like a
dialog: rose, you know.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Oh yeah? Can you think of something
dialog: to charge me with?
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: When I do, you'll hear about it.
text: Gittes nods, turns, and walks down the hall.
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE MORGUE
text: Gittes stops by a body on the table, the toe tagged with
text: Mulwray's name. MORTY is standing near it in a doorway to an
text: adjoining room. A RADIO is on, and with it the announcement
text: that they're about to hear another chapter in the life of
text: Lorenzo Jones and his devoted wife, Belle. Another Coroner's
text: assistant sits at the table, listening to the radio and eating
dialog: a sandwich.
text: Gittes ambles into the room.
speaker_heading: MORTY
dialog: (a cigarette dangling
dialog: out of his mouth)
dialog: Jake, what're you doin' here?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour,
dialog: I thought I'd drop by and see who
dialog: died lately.
text: Gittes picks up the sheet and pulls it back. CAMERA GETS ITS
text: FIRST GLIMPSE of Mulwray's body. Eyes open, the face badly
text: cut and bruised.
speaker_heading: MORTY
dialog: Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle
dialog: of a drought, the water commissioner
text: drowns. Only in L.A.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (looking at. Mulwray)
dialog: Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
speaker_heading: MORTY
dialog: That's a long fall.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: So how are you, Morty?
text: Morty is wheeling in another body with the help of an
dialog: assistant.
speaker_heading: MORTY
dialog: Never better. You know me, Jake.
text: As he begins to move the body into the refrigerator, he breaks
text: into a wrenching spasm of coughing. Gittes spots the other
text: body, lowers the sheet on Mulwray.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (picking up on cough)
dialog: Yeah, so who you got there?
text: Morty pulls back the sheet.
speaker_heading: MORTY
dialog: Leroy Shuhardt, local drunk used to
text: hang around Ferguson's Alley.
text: Morty brushes some sand from the man's face, laughs.
speaker_heading: MORTY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Quite a character. Lately he'd been
dialog: living in one of the downtown storm
dialog: drains. Had a bureau dresser down
dialog: there and everything.
text: Gittes has already lost interest. He starts away.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MORTY
text: Drowned, too.
text: This stops Gittes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Come again?
speaker_heading: MORTY
dialog: Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in
text: the bottom of the riverbed.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: The L.A. River?
speaker_heading: MORTY
dialog: (a little puzzled)
dialog: Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's
dialog: wrong with that?
text: Gittes has moved back to the body, looks at it more closely.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: It's bone dry, Morty.
speaker_heading: MORTY
text: It's not completely dry.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a
dialog: damp riverbed either, I don't care
dialog: how soused he was. That's like
text: drowning in a teaspoon.
text: Morty shrugs.
speaker_heading: MORTY
dialog: We got water out of him, Jake. He
dialog: drowned.
text: Gittes walks away mumbling.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Jesus, this town...
scene_heading: EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD  GITTES  DAY
text: He's parked on an overpass. The sign HOLLENBECK BRIDGE on
text: one of its concrete columns. Gittes looks down into the
text: riverbed below.
speaker_heading: FROM THE BRIDGE
text: Gittes can see the muddy remains of a collapsed shack, its
text: contents strewn down river from the bridge. Below him, lying
text: half over the storm drain and one wall that was on the bank
text: of the river is a sign that proclaims "OWN YOUR OWN OFFICE
text: IN THIS BUILDING $5000 to $6000" which was used as a roof of
text: sorts. Downstream, there's the dresser, an oil drum, a Ford
text: seat cushion, an Armour lard can, etc. The trashy remains of
dialog: Shuhardt's home.
text: Gittes scrambles down the embankment and as he lands near
text: the storm drain one shoe sinks, ankle deep into mud. Gittes
text: pulls it out, swearing.
text: He begins to walk a little further downstream when he hears
text: the vaguely familiar SQUISHY CLOP of something.
text: Clearing the bridge on the opposite side is the little Mexican
text: Boy, again on his swayback horse, riding along the muddy
dialog: bank.
text: They look at one another a moment.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (calling out to him)
dialog: You were riding here the other day,
dialog: weren't you...?
text: The Boy doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
speaker_heading: THE BOY
dialog: (finally)
dialog: Si.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Didn't you talk to a man here... few
dialog: days ago... wore glasses... he...
text: The Boy nods.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What did you talk about, mind my
dialog: asking?
text: The shadows of the two are very long now.
speaker_heading: THE BOY
dialog: (finally)
dialog: The water.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: What about the water?
speaker_heading: THE BOY
dialog: When it comes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: When it comes? What'd you tell him?
speaker_heading: THE BOY
text: Comes in different parts of the river.
dialog: Every night a different part.
text: Gittes nods. The horse snorts. The Boy rides slowly on.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERBED  DUSK
text: Gittes scrambles up the embankment to note the direction the
text: storm drain by Hollenbeck Bridge takes. It is headed above
text: toward the Hollywood Hills, where the sun is setting.
scene_heading: EXT. GITTES IN CAR  NIGHTFALL
text: Winding his way up a section of the Hollywood Hills. He picks
text: up on an open flood channel with the spotlight by the driver's
text: windwing.
text: GITTES IN CAR  MOVING
text: Along the flood channel. It is dark now and Gittes follows
text: the channel with the car spotlight. He turns at a fork in
text: the road which allows him to continue following the flood
dialog: channel.
text: FURTHER UP  MOVING
text: The road is narrower. Gittes drives more slowly. Foliage is
text: overgrown in the channel so its bottom cannot be glimpsed.
scene_heading: STILL FURTHER  NIGHT
text: The road is dirt. Heavy clusters of oak trees and eucalyptus
text: are everywhere. It is very still. Another turn and a pie-
text: shaped view of a lake of lights in the city below can be
speaker_heading: GLIMPSED.
scene_heading: POV  CHAIN-LINK FENCE
text: Over the road, bolted. It says "OAK PASS RESERVOIR. KEEP
text: OUT. NO TRESPASSING."
text: The chain-link itself actually extends over the flood channel
text: and down into it, making access along the channel itself
dialog: impossible.
text: Gittes backs up, turns off the motor, the car lights, the
dialog: spotlight.
text: A lone light overhead on tension wires is the sole
dialog: illumination.
text: There is only the eerie SOUND of the tension WIRES HUMMING.
text: Gittes gets out of the car, clubs the fence near the Flood
dialog: channel itself.
scene_heading: ON THE OTHER SIDE
text: Gittes carefully works his way up through the thick Foliage
text: toward a second and large chain-link fence. Lights from the
text: reservoir still higher above can be SEEN.
text: Suddenly there is a GUNSHOT. Then ANOTHER. Gittes dives into
text: the flood control channel, which is at this point about four
text: feet deep and six feet wide. There is the SOUND of men
text: scurrying through the brush, coming near him, then retreating.
text: Gittes loses himself among the ivy in the channel.
text: He waits. The men seem to have passed him by. But there is
text: another SOUND now. An echoing growing sound. It puzzles
text: Gittes. He starts to lift his head to catch the direction.
scene_heading: GITTES IN FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL  NIGHT
text: Then he's inundated with a rush of water which pours over
text: him, knocks off his hat, carries him down the channel, banging
text: into its banks, as he desperately tries to grab some of the
text: overgrowth to hang on and pull himself out. But the force of
text: the stream batters him and carries him with it until he's
text: brought rudely to the chainlink fence. It stops him cold.
text: He's nearly strained through it.
text: Swearing and choking, he pulls himself out of the rushing
text: water by means of the fence itself.
text: Drenched, battered, he slowly climbs back over the fence and
text: makes his way toward his car.
speaker_heading: AT GITTES' CAR
text: He fishes for his car keys, looks down. One shoe is missing.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (grumbling)
dialog: Goddam Florsheim shoe, goddammit.
text: He starts to get into his car but Mulvihill and a SMALLER
text: MAN stop him. Mulvihill pulling his coat down and pinning
text: his arms, holding him tightly. The smaller man thrusts a
text: switchblade knife about an inch and a half up Gittes' left
dialog: nostril.
speaker_heading: SMALLER MAN
dialog: (shaking with emotion)
dialog: Hold it there, kitty cat.
speaker_heading: CLOSE  GITTES
text: Frozen, the knife in his nostril, the street lamp overhead
text: gleaming on the silvery blade.
speaker_heading: THE SMALLER MAN
dialog: You are a very nosey fellow, kitty
dialog: cat... you know what happens to nosey
dialog: fellows?
text: The Smaller Man actually seems to be trembling with rage
text: when he says this. Gittes doesn't move.
speaker_heading: SMALLER MAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Wanna guess? No? Okay, lose their
text: noses.
text: With a quick flick the Smaller Man pulls back on the blade,
text: laying Gittes' left nostril open about an inch further. Gittes
dialog: screams.
text: Blood gushes down onto his shirt and coat.
text: Gittes bends over, instinctively trying to keep the blood
text: from getting on his clothes. Mulvihill and the Smaller Man
text: stare at him.
speaker_heading: THE SMALLER MAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Next time you lose the whole thing,
dialog: kitty cat. I'll cut it off and feed
dialog: it to my goldfish, understand?
speaker_heading: MULVIHILL
dialog: Tell him you understand, Gittes.
scene_heading: EXT. OAK PASS RESERVOIR  NIGHT
text: Gittes is now groveling on his hands and knees.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: I understand...
text: Gittes on the ground can see only his tormentor's two-tone
text: brown and white wing-tipped shoes, lightly freckled with his
dialog: blood.
speaker_heading: THE SHOE
text: Comes up and lightly shoves Gittes into the ground. The SOUND
text: of FOOTSTEPS RETREATING, Gittes gasping.
scene_heading: INT. GITTES' OFFICE  GITTES
text: Sits behind his desk, BACK TO CAMERA, not moving. Duffy sits
text: staring at nothing, Walsh moves uneasily around the room.
text: The PHONE is RINGING. Sophie BUZZES.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (pressing down intercom)
dialog: Yeah, Sophie.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE'S VOICE
text: A Miss Sessions calling.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE'S VOICE
dialog: Ida Sessions.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Don't know her. Take a number.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE  REVEALING
text: A bandage spread-eagled across Gittes' nose.
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: So some contractor wants to build a
dialog: dam and he makes a few payoffs. So
dialog: what?
text: Gittes turns slowly to Walsh. He lightly taps his nose.
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll
dialog: claim you were trespassing.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I don't want Mulvihill. I want the
text: big boys that are making the payoffs.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Then what'll you do?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Sue the shit out of 'em.
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah. What's wrong with you guys?
dialog: Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em.
dialog: We'll make a killing.
dialog: (a dazzling smile)
dialog: We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice
dialog: a week, we'll be pissing on ice the
dialog: rest of our lives.
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: Sue people like that they're liable
dialog: to be having dinner with the Judge
text: who's trying the suit.
text: Gittes looks irritated. The PHONE RINGS again.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE'S VOICE
dialog: Miss Ida Sessions again. She says
dialog: you know her.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Okay.
text: Gittes picks up the phone. He winks to his boys.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe
dialog: we've had the pleasure.
speaker_heading: IDA'S VOICE
dialog: Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr.
dialog: Gittes?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (clowning a little
dialog: for the boys)
dialog: Isn't everybody? What can I do for
dialog: you, Miss Sessions?
text: Walsh promptly starts to tell Duffy the Admiral Byrd story.
speaker_heading: IDA'S VOICE
dialog: Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes.
dialog: I didn't come in to see you on my
dialog: own.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: When did you come in?
speaker_heading: IDA'S VOICE
dialog: I was the one who pretended to be
dialog: Mrs. Mulwray, remember?
text: Walsh has finished off the punch line and both men are
text: laughing raucously. Gittes drops the mail he's been loafing
text: through and puts his hand over the receiver.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (to Duffy and Walsh)
dialog: Shut the fuck up!
dialog: (then back to Ida)
dialog: ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss
dialog: Sessions, just going over a detail
dialog: or two with my associates... you
dialog: were saying?
speaker_heading: IDA'S VOICE
dialog: Well I never expected anything to
dialog: happen like what happened to Mr.
dialog: Mulwray, the point is if it ever
dialog: comes out I want somebody to know I
dialog: didn't know what would happen.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I understand... if you could tell me
dialog: who employed you, Miss Sessions.
dialog: That could help us both.
speaker_heading: IDA'S VOICE
dialog: Oh no.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: ...Why don't you give me your address
dialog: and we can talk this over?
speaker_heading: IDA'S VOICE
dialog: No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the
dialog: obituary column of today's Times...
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: The obituary column?
speaker_heading: IDA'S VOICE
dialog: You'll find one of those people.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: 'Those people?' Miss Sessions.
text: She hangs up. Gittes looks to his two men.
scene_heading: INT. BROWN DERBY  CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER
text: Gittes is seated, flips through the paper until he finds the
text: OBITUARY COLUMN, scans it, looks up, abruptly tears the column
text: from the paper and puts it in his pocket.
text: When he closes the paper we can SEE headlines in the left
scene_heading: hand column: "WATER BOND ISSUE PASSES COUNCIL". Ten million
dialog: dollar referendum to go before the public.
text: Evelyn Mulwray is standing at the table as he does so. He
text: rises, allows her to sit.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON EVELYN
text: Gittes watches her as she removes her gloves slowly... She's
text: wearing dove gray gabardine, subdued, tailored.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Thanks for coming... drink?
text: The waiter's appeared. Evelyn is looking at Gittes' nose.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Tom Collins with lime, not lemon,
dialog: please.
text: Evelyn looks down and smoothes her gloves. When she looks
text: back up she stares expectantly at Gittes.
text: Gittes pulls out a torn envelope. The initials ECM can be
text: SEEN in a delicate scroll on the corner of it.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I got your check in the mall.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
text: Gittes' fingers the envelope. He coughs.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not
dialog: good enough.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (a little embarrassed)
dialog: Well, how much would you like?
scene_heading: CLOSE ON EVELYN
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Stop it. The money's fine. It's
dialog: generous but you've shortchanged me
text: on the story.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (coolly)
dialog: I have?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I think so. Something besides your
dialog: husband's death was bothering you.
dialog: You were upset but not that upset.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Mr. Gittes...
dialog: (icily)
dialog: Don't tell me how I feel.
text: The drinks come. The waiter sets them down.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband
dialog: dies, you drop the lawsuit like a
dialog: hot potato, and all of it quicker
dialog: than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse
dialog: me. Then you ask me to lie to the
dialog: police.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: It wasn't much of a lie.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: If your husband was killed it was.
dialog: (meaning check)
dialog: This can look like you paid me off
dialog: to withhold evidence.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: But he wasn't killed.
text: Gittes smiles.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I think you're hiding something,
dialog: Mrs. Mulwray.
text: Evelyn remains unperturbed.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Well, I suppose I am... actually I
dialog: knew about the affair.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: How did you find out?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: My husband.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: He told you?
text: Evelyn nods.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: And you weren't the slightest bit
dialog: upset about it?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I was grateful.
text: Evelyn for the first time appears a little embarrassed.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: You'll have to explain that, Mrs.
dialog: Mulwray.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (a flash of annoyance)
dialog: Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my
dialog: metiay. When a wife tells me she's
text: happy her husband is cheating on her
dialog: it runs contrary to my experience.
text: Gittes looks significantly to Evelyn.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Unless what?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (looking directly at
dialog: her)
text: She's cheating on him.
text: Evelyn doesn't reply.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Were you?
text: Evelyn is clearly angry but she is controlling it.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I don't like the word 'cheat.'
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Did you have affairs?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (flashing)
dialog: Mr. Gittes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Did he know?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (almost an outburst)
dialog: Well I wouldn't run home and tell
dialog: him whenever I went to bed with
dialog: someone, if that's what you mean.
text: This subdues Gittes a little. Evelyn is still a little heated.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (continuing; more
dialog: calmly)
dialog: Is there anything else you want to
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Where you were when your husband
dialog: died.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I can't tell you.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: You mean you don't know where you
dialog: were?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I mean I can't tell you.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: You were seeing someone, too.
text: Evelyn looks squarely at him. She doesn't deny it.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: For very long?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I don't see anyone for very long,
dialog: Mr. Gittes. It's difficult for me.
dialog: Now I think you know all you need to
dialog: about me. I didn't want publicity. I
dialog: didn't want to go into any of this,
dialog: then or now. Is this all?
text: Gittes nods.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Oh, by the way. What's the 'C' stand
dialog: for?
text: He's been fingering the envelope...
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (she stammers slightly)
dialog: K... Cross.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: That your maiden name?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Yes... why?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: No reason.
text: Evelyn turns into Gittes.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: You must've had a reason to ask me
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: No. I'm just a snoop.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: You seem to have had a reason for
dialog: every other question.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: No, not for that one.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I don't believe you.
text: Gittes suddenly turns sharply in to Evelyn.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (moving in)
dialog: Do me a favor. Sit still and act
dialog: like I'm charming.
text: Evelyn involuntarily draws back.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: There's somebody here. Say something.
dialog: Anything. Something like we're being
dialog: intimate.
text: Evelyn reluctantly allows Gittes to move closer and dangle
text: his hand in front of their faces. She stares at him.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (meaning his nose)
dialog: How did it happen?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Been meaning to talk to you about
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Maybe putting your nose in other
dialog: people's business?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: More like other people putting their
dialog: business in my nose.
text: Evelyn actually smiles a little.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: You son of a bitch.
text: Gittes looks up and flashes his smile.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Mrs. Match. How're you?
text: MRS. MATCH is swaying over the table, a plump woman with a
text: glass of whiskey in one hand, a large purse in the other,
text: and a menacing look in her eye.
speaker_heading: MRS. MATCH
dialog: Don't give me that, you son of a
dialog: bitch.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Okay.
text: Gittes turns back to Evelyn.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Another satisfied client?
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: Another satisfied client's wife.
speaker_heading: MRS. MATCH
dialog: Look at me, you son of a bitch. You...
dialog: you bastard. Are you happy, are you
dialog: happy now?
text: She tries to take a swipe at Gittes with her purse. Gittes
text: covers himself. Waiters rush over.
speaker_heading: MRS. MATCH
dialog: You smug son of a bitch. My husband's
dialog: so upset he sweats all night! How do
dialog: you think that makes me feel?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Sweaty?
text: Mrs. Match swings at Gittes again and again. She catches him
text: on the nose. It hurts. He covers it, then swings his leg out
text: from under the table and deftly kicks her in the shin.
text: Mrs. Match drops her purse and spills her drink. She grabs
text: her shin, hopping around a little. The waiters who had tried
text: to restrain her now try to keep her from falling over.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Let's get out of here before she
text: picks up her purse.
text: They rise and move toward the door.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Tough guy, huh?
text: Gittes looks, sees she's kidding, and nods.
text: OUTSIDE IN THE PARKING LOT  DUSK
text: Gittes' car has been brought by the parking attendant. The
text: attendant opens the passenger side for Evelyn.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Oh, no. I've got my own car. The
text: creamcolored Packard.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (to attendant who
text: dutifully starts for
dialog: her car)
dialog: Wait a minute, sonny.
dialog: (to Evelyn)
dialog: I think you better come with me.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: What for? There's nothing more to
dialog: say.
dialog: (to attendant)
dialog: Get my car, please.
text: The attendant starts after it again. Gittes leans on the
text: open door of his car and in to Evelyn. He talks quietly but
text: spits it out.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Okay, go home. But in case you're
dialog: interested your husband was murdered.
text: Somebody's dumping tons of water out
dialog: of the city reservoirs when we're
text: supposedly in the middle of a drought,
text: he found out, and he was killed.
text: There's a waterlogged drunk in the
dialog: morgue. Involuntary manslaughter if
dialog: anybody wants to take the trouble
dialog: which they don't. It looks like half
dialog: the city is trying to cover it all
dialog: up, which is fine with me. But, Mrs.
dialog: Mulwray.
dialog: (now inches from her)
dialog: I goddam near lost my nose! And I
dialog: like it. I like breathing through
dialog: it. And I still think you're hiding
dialog: something.
text: Evelyn steadies herself on the open car door. She stares at
text: Gittes for a long moment. Then he gently tugs the car door
dialog: closed.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Mr. Gittes.
text: He drives off into the Wilshire traffic, leaving Evelyn
text: looking after him.
scene_heading: INT. DWP  MULWRAY'S OFFICE DOOR
scene_heading: WITH ITS LETTERING:
scene_heading: "HOLLIS I. MULWRAY CHIEF ENGINEER"
text: Gittes goes through the door to the Secretary. She looks up.
text: She recognizes Gittes again and is not happy to see him.
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Yelburton.
text: The Secretary immediately gets up and goes into the inner
dialog: office.
text: Gittes turns and strolls around the office a moment. He sees
text: a photographic display of "THE HISTORY OF THE DWP. THE EARLY
text: YEARS", along the wall. He stops as he spots a photo of the
text: man with the cane Gittes had seen photos of earlier. He is
text: standing high in the mountains, near a pass. The caption
scene_heading: reads "JULIAN CROSS. 1905".
text: Cross is strikingly handsome.
text: Gittes immediately pulls out the envelope containing Evelyn's
text: check. He looks at the corner of it, his thumb pressing down
text: under the middle initial C, then he looks back to the photos.
text: The Secretary returns.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: He's liable to be tied up
dialog: indefinitely.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I take a long lunch. All day
dialog: sometimes.
text: Gittes pulls out a cigarette case, offers the Secretary one.
text: She refuses. He lights up and begins to hum 'The Way You
text: Look Tonight,' strolling along the wall looking at more
dialog: photographs.
scene_heading: INT. MULWRAY'S OFFICES
text: Here he spots several photos of a much younger Mulwray, along
text: with Julian Cross. One of the captions: "HOLLIS MULWRAY AND
text: JULIAN CROSS AS THE AQUEDUCT CLEARS THE SANTA SUSANNAH PASS.
dialog: 1912".
text: Gittes, still humming, turns to the Secretary.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Julian Cross worked for the water
dialog: department?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Yes. No.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (humming, then)
dialog: He did or he didn't?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: He owned it.
text: Gittes is genuinely surprised at this.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: He owned the water department?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: He owned the entire water supply for
dialog: the city?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (really surprised)
dialog: How did they get it away from him?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: (a sigh, then)
dialog: Mr. Mulwray felt the public should
dialog: own the display. The water. If you'll
text: just read the display.
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: (glances back, hums,
dialog: then)
dialog: Mulwray? I thought you said Cross
dialog: owned the department.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
text: Along with Mr. Mulwray.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: They were partners.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: (testily)
dialog: Yes. Yes, they were partners.
text: She gets up, annoyed, and goes into Yelburton's inner office.
text: Gittes goes back to the photographs. He hears a SCRATCHING
text: SOUND, apparently coming from just outside the outer door.
text: He moves quickly to it, hesitates, swiftly opens the door.
text: Workmen are behind it, scraping away Mulwray's name on the
text: outer door, looking up at Gittes in some surprise.
text: The Secretary returns, sees the workman on the floor.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: (to Gittes)
dialog: Mr. Yelburton will see you now.
text: Gittes nods graciously, heads on into Yelburton's office.
scene_heading: INT. DWP  YELBURTON &amp; GITTES
text: There is a subtle but perceptible difference in Yelburton's
dialog: attitude. He's now head of the department.
speaker_heading: YELBURTON
dialog: Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting.
dialog: These staff meetings, they just go
dialog: on and on.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah, must be especially tough to
dialog: take over under these circumstances.
speaker_heading: YELBURTON
dialog: Oh yes. Hollis was the best department
dialog: head the city's ever had. My goodness,
dialog: what happened to your nose?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I cut myself shaving.
speaker_heading: YELBURTON
dialog: You ought to be more careful. That
dialog: must really smart.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Only when I breathe.
speaker_heading: YELBURTON
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Only when you breathe... don't tell
dialog: me you're still working for Mrs.
dialog: Mulwray?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I never was.
speaker_heading: YELBURTON
dialog: (stops smiling)
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Neither do I, actually. But you hired
dialog: me or you hired that chippie to hire
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: YELBURTON
dialog: Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit
dialog: of sense.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Well, look at it this way, Mr.
dialog: Yelburton. Mulwray didn't want to
dialog: build a dam and he had a reputation
dialog: that was hard to get around, so.
dialog: you decided to ruin it. Then he found
dialog: out that you were dumping water every
text: night. Then he was drowned.
speaker_heading: YELBURTON
dialog: Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous
dialog: accusation. I don't know what you're
dialog: talking about.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the
dialog: Times will. Dumping thousands of
text: gallons of water down the toilet in
dialog: the middle of a drought. That's
dialog: news.
text: Gittes heads toward the door.
speaker_heading: YELBURTON
dialog: Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes.
dialog: We're... well, we're not anxious for
dialog: this to get around, but we have been
text: diverting a little water to irrigate
text: avocado and walnut groves in the
dialog: northwest valley. As you know, the
dialog: farmers there have no legal right to
dialog: our water, and since the drought
dialog: we've had to cut them off. The city
dialog: comes first, naturally. But, well,
dialog: we've been trying to help some of
dialog: them out, keep them from going under.
dialog: Naturally when you divert water you
dialog: get a little runoff.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah, a little runoff. Where are
dialog: those orchards?
speaker_heading: YELBURTON
dialog: I said, the northwest valley.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: That's like saying they're in Arizona.
speaker_heading: YELBURTON
dialog: Mr. Gittes, my field men are out and
dialog: I can't give you an exact location...
text: Gittes nods.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: You're a married man, am I right?
speaker_heading: YELBURTON
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Hard working, have a wife and kids...
speaker_heading: YELBURTON
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I don't want to nail you. I just
dialog: want to know who put you up to it.
dialog: I'll give you a few days to think it
dialog: over.
dialog: (hands him a card)
dialog: Call me. I can help. Who knows?
dialog: Maybe we can lay the whole thing off
dialog: on a few big shots and you can stay
dialog: head of the department for the next
dialog: twenty years.
text: Gittes smiles, leaves an unsmiling Yelburton.
scene_heading: INT. GITTES OFFICE
text: Gittes enters, drops his hat on Sophie's desk. Sophie tries
text: to tell him something but Gittes goes on into his office.
scene_heading: EVELYN MULWRAY
text: Is sitting, smoking. She looks up when he enters.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: What's your usual salary?
text: Gittes moves to his desk, barely breaking stride at the sight
dialog: of her.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Thirty-five bucks daily for me, twenty
dialog: for each of my operators, plus
dialog: expenses, plus my fee if I show
dialog: results.
text: He's sitting now. Evelyn is very pale now, obviously very
dialog: shaken.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Whoever's behind my husband's death,
dialog: why have they gone to all this
dialog: trouble?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Money. How they plan to make it by
dialog: emptying the reservoirs, that I don't
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I'll pay your salary plus five
dialog: thousand dollars if you find out
dialog: what happened to Hollis and who is
dialog: involved.
text: Gittes buzzes Sophie.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Sophie, draw up one of our standard
text: forms for Mrs. Mulwray.
dialog: (he leans back; to
dialog: Evelyn)
dialog: Tell me, did you get married before
dialog: or after Mulwray and your father
dialog: sold the water department?
text: Evelyn nearly jumps at the question.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Your father is Julian Cross, isn't
dialog: he?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Yes, of course. It was quite a while
dialog: after. I was just out of grade school
dialog: when they did that.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: So you married your father's business
dialog: partner?
text: Evelyn nods. She lights another cigarette.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing; staring
text: at her, points to
dialog: the ashtray)
dialog: You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Oh.
text: She quickly stubs one out.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Is there something upsetting about
dialog: my asking about your father?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis
dialog: and my fa... my father had a falling
dialog: out...
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Over the water department, or over
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Not over me. Why would they have a
dialog: falling out over me?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (noting her nervousness)
text: Then it was over the water department.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes
dialog: and no. Hollis felt the public should
dialog: own the water but I don't think my
dialog: father felt that way. Actually, it
text: was over the Van der Lip. The dam
dialog: that broke.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Oh, yeah?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Yes. He never forgave him for it.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Never forgave him for what?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: For talking him into building it, he
dialog: never forgave my father... They
dialog: haven't spoken to this day.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (starts a little)
dialog: You sure shout that?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Of course I'm sure.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: What about you? Do you and your father
dialog: get along?
text: Sophie comes in with the form, cutting off Evelyn's reply.
text: Gittes places two copies on a coffee table in front of Evelyn.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Sign here... The other copy's for
dialog: you.
text: She signs it. When she looks back up, Gittes is staring
text: intently at her.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: What are you thinking?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (picking up one of
dialog: copies, folding it,
dialog: putting it in his
dialog: pocket)
dialog: Before this I turned on the faucet,
dialog: it came out hot and cold, I didn't
dialog: think there was a thing to it.
scene_heading: INT. SEAPLANE
text: The engines make the small cabin vibrate. Gittes threads his
text: way down the tiny aisle of the eight passenger cabin, which
text: is full of middle-aged men in old clothes and their fishing
text: gear. Gittes is poked by a pole, has to move along.
text: One of the old men says something to him.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (above the engines)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: You'll have to sit with the pilot.
text: Gittes moves forward into the cockpit, the PILOT looks up 
text: nods for Gittes to sit down, first moving a half eaten cheese
text: sandwich out of Gittes' seat.
scene_heading: EXT. HARBOR - SEAPLANE
text: Taxiing down the ramp into the sea. In a moment, it kicks up
text: a spray of foam and takes off.
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT
text: The island gradually looming larger before the Pilot and
dialog: Gittes.
text: The Pilot glances over at Gittes who, as usual, is impeccably
text: dressed. A contrast to the others on the plane.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: (above the engines)
dialog: Well, you're not going fishing.
text: Gittes shakes his head.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Not exactly.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: (winks)
dialog: But that's what you told your wife.
text: The Pilot laughs raucously. Gittes laughs politely.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Lots of fellas do. Tell the little
dialog: woman they're going on a fishing
text: trip, then shack up with some little
dialog: twist on the island... she pretty?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (abruptly)
dialog: I'm going to see a man called Julian
dialog: Cross. Ever heard of him?
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you,
dialog: mister?... I ask because he doesn't
dialog: see a whole lot of people.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I'm working for his daughter.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: That right?... She used to be some
dialog: looker.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: She ain't exactly long in the tooth
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: She must be about thirty-three, thirty-
dialog: four.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: You must be thinking of a different
dialog: daughter.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: No, he's only got one, I remember
dialog: her age, I read it in the newspapers
dialog: when she ran away.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: She ran away?
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the
dialog: time. Julian Cross' daughter. God
dialog: almighty. She was a wild little thing.
text: He gives a sidelong glance to Gittes, a little concerned
dialog: he's said too much.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Course, she settled down nicely.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (smiling a little)
dialog: Well, you never know, do you?
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: (loosening up)
dialog: That's for sure.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Why'd she run away?
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Oh, you know. She was sixteen or
dialog: seventeen.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (nudging him)
dialog: We missed the best of it, didn't we,
dialog: pal?
text: Both men laugh a little lewdly.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she
dialog: was knocked up and didn't even know
dialog: who the father was. Went there to
dialog: get rid of it.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: You don't say?
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Cross was looking for her all over
dialog: the country. Offered rewards,
dialog: everything. Felt real sorry for him,
dialog: with all his money.
speaker_heading: ALBACORE CLUB  DAY
text: A pleasant but unobtrusive clapboard blue and white building
text: on the bay overlooking the harbor. The seaplane lands. A
text: motor launch with a burgee of a fish flying from it turns
text: and heads in the direction of the plane.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDING ROAD  RANCHO DEL CRUCE
text: Gittes, driven in a station wagon, passes under the sign
text: with a cross painted below the name.
text: The ranch itself is only partially in a valley on the island.
text: As the wagon continues one can SEE that it is actually a
text: miniature California, encompassing desert, mountains and
text: canyon that tumble down palisades to the windward side of
dialog: the sea.
text: The wagon comes to a halt where a group of hands are clustered
text: around a corral. The circle of men drift apart, leaving JULIAN
text: CROSS standing, using a cane for support, reedy but handsome
text: in a rough linen shirt and jeans. When he talks his strong
text: face is lively, in repose it looks ravaged.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDLE PATH  GITTES &amp; CROSS
text: Walking toward the main house. A classic Monterey. A horse
text: led on a halter by another ranch hand slows down and defecates
text: in the center of the path they are taking. Gittes doesn't
dialog: notice.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Horseshit.
text: Gittes pauses, not certain he has heard correctly.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: I said horseshit.
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Horseshit.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yes, sir, that's what it looks like.
dialog: I'll give you that.
text: Cross pauses when they reach the dung pile. He removes his
text: hat and waves it, inhales deeply.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Love the smell of it. A lot of people
dialog: do but of course they won't admit
dialog: it. Look at the shape.
text: Gittes glances down out of politeness.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: (continuing; smiling,
dialog: almost enthusiastic)
dialog: Always the same.
text: Cross walks on. Gittes follows.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (not one to let it go)
dialog: Always?
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: What? Oh, damn near yes. Unless the
dialog: animal's sick or something.
text: (stops and glances.
dialog: back)
text: And the steam rising off it like
dialog: that in the morning. That's life,
dialog: Mr. Gittes. Life.
text: They move on.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Perhaps this preoccupation with
dialog: horseshit may seem a little perverse,
dialog: but I ask you to remember this. One
dialog: way or another, it's what I've dealt
dialog: in all my life. Let's have breakfast.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD VERANDA  GITTES &amp; CROSS AT BREAKFAST
text: Below them is a corral where hands take Arabians, one by
text: one, and work them out, letting them run and literally kick
dialog: up their heels.
text: Cross' attention is diverted by the animals from time to
text: time. An impeccable Mexican butler serves them their main
text: course, broiled fish.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: You know, you've got a nasty
dialog: reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (dubious)
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: If you were a bank president that
dialog: would be one thing, but in your
dialog: business it's admirable. And it's
dialog: good advertising.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: It doesn't hurt.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: It's why you attract a client like
dialog: my daughter.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Probably.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: But I'm surprised you're still working
dialog: for her, unless she's suddenly come
text: up with another husband.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: No. She happens to think the last
dialog: one was murdered.
text: Cross is visibly surprised.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: How did she get that idea?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I think I gave it to her.
text: Cross nods.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Uh-huh. Oh I hope you don't mind. I
dialog: believe they should be served with
dialog: the head.
text: Gittes glances down at the fish whose isinglass eye is glazed
text: over with the heat of cooking.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Fine, as long as you don't serve
dialog: chicken that way.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Tell me. What do the police say?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: They're calling it an accident.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Who's the investigating officer?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Do you know him?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Oh yes.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Where from?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: We worked in Chinatown together.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Would you call him a capable man?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Very.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Honest?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Far as it goes. Of course he has to
dialog: swim in the same water we all do.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Of course, but you've got no reason
dialog: to think he's bungled the case?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: None.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: That's too bad.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Too bad?
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes
dialog: me think you're taking my daughter
dialog: for a ride. Financially speaking, of
dialog: course. How much are you charging
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come
dialog: up with any results.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Are you sleeping with her? Come,
dialog: come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to
dialog: think about that to remember, do
dialog: you?
text: Gittes laughs.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: If you want an answer to that question
dialog: I can always put one of my men on
dialog: the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Mr. Gittes! You're dealing with a
dialog: disturbed woman who's lost her
dialog: husband. I don't want her taken
dialog: advantage of. Sit down.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: You may think you know what you're
dialog: dealing with, but believe me, you
dialog: don't.
text: This stops Gittes. He seems faintly mused by it.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Why is that funny?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: It's what the D.A. used to tell me
dialog: about Chinatown.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Was he right?
text: Gittes shrugs.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...Exactly what do you know about
dialog: me, Mr. Gittes?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Mainly that you're rich and too
dialog: respectable to want your name in the
dialog: papers.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: (grunts, then)
dialog: 'Course I'm respectable. I'm old.
text: Politicians, ugly buildings and whores
dialog: all get respectable if they last
dialog: long enough. I'll double whatever
dialog: your fees are and I'll pay you ten
dialog: thousand dollars if you can find
dialog: Hollis' girlfriend.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: His girlfriend?
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Yes, his girlfriend.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: You mean the little chippie he was
dialog: with at the El Macando?
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Doesn't that strike you as odd?
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: No. She's probably scared to death.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Wouldn't it be useful to talk to
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: If Mulwray was murdered, she was
dialog: probably one of the last people to
dialog: see him.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: You didn't see Mulwray much, did
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: When was the last time?
text: Cross starts to reply, then there's the SOUND of a MARIACHI
text: BAND and some men in formation clear a bluff about a hundred
text: yards off. They are dressed like Spanish dons on horseback.
text: For the most part they are fat in the saddle and pass along
text: in disordered review to the music.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of
dialog: damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to
dialog: the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em
dialog: practice up out here.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah. Do you remember the last time
dialog: you talked to Mulwray?
text: Cross shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: At my age, you tend to lose track...
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Well, It was about five days ago.
dialog: You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle
dialog: and you had one hell of an argument.
text: Cross looks to Gittes in some real surprise.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I've got the photographs in my office.
dialog: If they'll help you remember. What
dialog: was the argument about?
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: (a long pause, then:)
dialog: My daughter.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: What about her?
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I
dialog: think she is frightened and I happen
dialog: to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd
dialog: like to help her if I can.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I didn't realize you and Hollis were
dialog: so fond of each other.
text: Cross looks hatefully at Gittes.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Hollis Mulwray made this city and he
dialog: made me a fortune... We were a lot
dialog: closer than Evelyn realized.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: If you want to hire me, I still have
dialog: to know what you and Mulwray were
dialog: arguing about.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: (painfully)
dialog: Well... she's an extremely jealous
dialog: person. I didn't want her to find
dialog: out about the girl.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: How did you find out?
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: I've still got a few teeth in my
text: head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends
dialog: in town.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Okay. My secretary'll send you a
dialog: letter of agreement. Tell me are you
dialog: worried about that girl, or what
dialog: Evelyn might do to her?
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Just find the girl.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I'll look into it as soon as I check
text: out some avocado groves.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Avocado groves?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
scene_heading: INT. HALL OF RECORDS  DAY
text: Dark and quiet except for the whirring of fans. Gittes
text: approaches one of the CLERKS at a desk.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I'm a little lost. Where can I find
dialog: the plat books for the northwest
dialog: valley?
text: The Clerk's droopy eyes widen a little.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Part of it's in Ventura County. We
dialog: don't have Ventura County in our
dialog: Hall of Records.
text: Which is a snotty remark. Gittes smiles.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I'll settle for L.A. County.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (regards him, then)
dialog: Row twenty-three, section C.
text: The Clerk turns away abruptly. Gittes regards his back a
text: moment, then goes to the stacks.
text: THROUGH THE STACKS
text: Gittes sees the Clerk turn to another, say something. The
text: second clerk gets on the phone. Gittes watches a moment,
text: then swiftly turns his attention to the stacks.
text: He hauls down the northwest valley volume, opens it. It's
dialog: huge and there's a lot to go through.
text: The print itself makes him squint.
speaker_heading: INSERT PAGE
text: Showing TRACT, LOT, PARCEL, even a METES AND BOUNDS
dialog: designation where the description of the land parcel is long
dialog: and hopelessly involved e.g. '6000 paces to Rio Seco, thence
dialog: 7000 paces to Loma Linda, etc.' These descriptions are old
text: and faded. In the owners' column, however there are numerous
text: freshly typed names pasted over the prior owners.
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: Hauls the huge volume back to the
text: Clerk's desk.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (to Clerk)
dialog: Say... uh... sonny.
text: The Clerk turns sharply around.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: How come all these new names are
dialog: pasted into the plat book?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Land sales out of escrow are always
dialog: recorded within the week.
text: Gittes looks a little surprised.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Then these are all new owners?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (astonished)
dialog: But that means that most of the
dialog: valley's been sold in the last few
dialog: months.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: If that's what it says.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Can I check one of these volumes
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (quietly snotty)
dialog: Sir, this is not a lending library,
dialog: it's the Hall of Records.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Well, then, how about a ruler?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: A ruler?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: The print's pretty fine. I forgot my
dialog: glasses. I'd like to be able to read
dialog: across.
text: The exasperated Clerk reaches around, rummages, slaps a ruler
text: on the desk.
text: Gittes goes back to the stacks with the ruler. He opens the
text: book, places the ruler not horizontally but vertically.
scene_heading: INSERT PLAT BOOK NORTHWEST VALLEY
text: Beside the OWNER column he places the ruler, looks toward
text: the clerks, then swiftly rips down the page, tearing out a
text: strip about two inches wide containing the owner's name and
text: property description. As he tears, he either sniffles or
text: coughs to cover the SOUND of the PAPER being ripped.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD  GITTES DRIVING  DAY
text: Amidst a hall of shimmering dust and heat, parched and drying
text: groves, narrower roads.
text: He passes a ramshackle home, next to a rotting orchard. There
text: is a "SOLD" sign on the collapsing barn. Gittes stops, checks
dialog: it against the names he had taken from the Hall of Records.
text: OLD STUCCO BUILDINGS FURTHER ON
text: And a few withered pepper trees. Gittes has paused at this
text: dried-up intersection. There is a "SOLD" sign on a drug store.
text: Gittes looks OFF SCREEN.
text: Coming INTO VIEW above the arid fields is a spiraling cloud
text: of purple smoke. Gittes heads in that direction.
text: Gittes parks at the edge of the field. About twenty yards
text: away is a man mounted on a strange machine, holding a lid
dialog: off it.
text: Billowing lavender clouds are belching forth.
text: Several CHILDREN are watching the man at work.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (to one of the Children)
dialog: Say, pal, what's he doing?
speaker_heading: CHILD
text: Making some rain.
text: Gittes nods, walks over to the man who is elaborately busying
text: himself with the intricacies of his machine. He's aware of
text: Gittes watching him.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Well, you're just the man I'm looking
dialog: for.
text: The Rainmaker now glances down at Gittes, who as usual is
text: immaculately dressed.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Some associates and I are thinking
dialog: of buying property out here. Of
dialog: course, we're worried about the
dialog: rainfall.
text: The Rainmaker steps down.
speaker_heading: RAINMAKER
dialog: No problem with me on the Job.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (glancing around at
dialog: the desolate, dry
dialog: field)
dialog: Do you have any references?
scene_heading: RAINMAKER &amp; GITTES
speaker_heading: RAINMAKER
dialog: City of La Habra Heights filled an
dialog: 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen
dialog: inches of rain in two days.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (nods)
dialog: That's swell. But how about here?
dialog: (pulling out names
dialog: from his pocket)
dialog: Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma
dialog: Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons,
dialog: or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
speaker_heading: RAINMAKER
dialog: Never heard of 'em... new owners?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: RAINMAKER
dialog: (climbing back up)
dialog: Lot of turnover these days. Better
dialog: tell them to get in touch with me if
dialog: they want to hang onto their land.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah, I'll do that.
speaker_heading: GITTES DRIVING
text: Is now covered with a film of dust:
text: He reaches a fork in the dirt road. There are a couple of
text: mailboxes.
text: Gittes takes this fork and begins a slow ascent.
text: As he does, the tops of a line of bright green trees can be
text: SEEN, coming more and more INTO VIEW, row upon row of avocado
text: and walnut groves, their foliage heavy. The few structures
text: in the distance are white-washed, and well kept, right down
text: to the white-washed stones that mark the pathway to the home.
text: Towering above it all is a huge wooden water tank.
text: Gittes drives through a gate that has "NO TRESPASSING" and
text: "KEEP OUT PRIVATE PROPERTY" signs neatly printed on it.
text: He drives down the road into the grove.
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: Pulls to a halt in the road flanking the orchard lanes. He
text: puts the car in neutral, stares at the trees. By contrast
text: with what he has seen they are lush and beautiful, their
text: heavy branches barely swaying in a light breeze.
text: Then a SHOTGUN BLAST abruptly strips bare the branches of
text: the tree he'd been staring at.
scene_heading: EXT. AVOCADO GROVES  DAY
text: Gittes is shocked. He looks behind him. Riding on horseback
text: down the field in the direction he had just driven is a Red-
text: Faced Man in overalls. His hat blows off his head. He does
text: not, however, lose the shotgun he has just used. Gittes'
text: lane of retreat is denied him. He guns the car, and takes
text: off down one of the orchard lanes.
scene_heading: MOVING WITH GITTES
text: The dirt lane is rough. As Gittes nears the end of it, a
text: Younger Man on a mule blocks the exit.
text: Gittes veers a sharp left, knocking a branch off one of the
text: trees, heading down one of the cross-lanes. Here he's pursued
text: by a scraggly dog that nips at the tires. Gittes yells at
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON GROVE
text: Two farmers on foot, one using a crutch, run down the lanes
text: toward a dust trail rising above the trees. They've spotted
text: it. Clearly it's from Gittes' car.
text: This hide-and-seek chase between one man on horseback, one
text: on a mule and a couple on foot continues up and down and
text: across the orchard lanes until Gittes' front tire and radiator
text: are ruptured by another SHOTGUN BLAST.
text: Gittes' car veers off, scattering a stray gaggle of geese
text: and smacks into an avocado tree, shaking loose a barrage of
text: the heavy fruit onto Gittes and the car.
text: Gittes immediately tries to get out through the branches
text: over the back of his car, but he's pulled off it by one of
text: the younger farmers, a huge brute who he begins to tussle
text: with. The Crippled Farmer begins to bang Gittes on the back
text: with his crutch. The two of them manage to pound Gittes to
text: the ground within moments, where the Crippled Farmer continues
text: to whack away at Gittes with the crutch.
text: The older Red Faced Farmer with the shotgun and the Man on a
text: mule ride up.
speaker_heading: RED FACED FARMER
dialog: All right, quit it! Quit now! Search
dialog: the man, see if he's armed.
text: Gittes is hefted half off the ground and the two younger
text: Farmers spin him around, going through his clothes. Gittes
text: is badly banged up and half out on his feet. They toss his
text: wallet, his silver cigarette case, etc. on the ground.
speaker_heading: RED FACED FARMER
dialog: I said see if he's armed, not empty
text: his pockets.
speaker_heading: BIG FARMER
dialog: He ain't armed.
text: Gittes leans against the back of his car, breathing heavily.
speaker_heading: RED FACED FARMER
dialog: All right, mister. Who you with?
dialog: Water department or the real estate
dialog: office?
text: Gittes' back is to the Red Faced Farmer. He has trouble
text: catching his breath. The Crippled Farmer pokes him rudely in
text: the back with his crutch. Gittes turns sharply.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (to Crippled Farmer)
dialog: Get away from me!
speaker_heading: CRIPPLED FARMER
dialog: Answer him!
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Touch me with that thing again and
dialog: you'll need a pair of them.
speaker_heading: BIG FARMER
dialog: (shoving Gittes)
dialog: Whyn't you pick on somebody your own
dialog: size?
speaker_heading: RED FACED FARMER
dialog: I said cut that out! Give him a chance
dialog: to say something.
text: Gittes looks up at the Red Faced Farmer.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (reaching down for
dialog: his wallet)
dialog: Name's Gittes. I'm a private
dialog: investigator and I'm not with either
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: RED FACED FARMER
dialog: Then what are you doing out here?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Client hired me to see... whether or
dialog: not the water department's been
dialog: irrigating your land.
speaker_heading: RED FACED FARMER
dialog: Irrigating my land?
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: The water department's been sending
dialog: you people to blow up my water tanks!
dialog: They threw poison down three of my
dialog: wells! I call that a funny way to
dialog: irrigate. Who'd hire you for a thing
dialog: like that?
text: Gittes reaches into his pocket. The paper's on the ground.
text: He picks it up.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.
speaker_heading: BIG FARMER
dialog: Mulwray? That's the son of a bitch
dialog: who's done it to us.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Mulwray's dead. You don't know what
dialog: you're talking about, you dumb Oakie.
text: The Big Farmer takes a swing at Gittes. Gittes kicks him
text: squarely in the nuts, knees him in the jaw after he's doubled
text: up, and hits him solidly. The Crippled Farmer takes careful
text: aim and brings his crutch down on the back of Gittes' head.
text: Gittes is knocked to the ground and lies still beside the
text: Big Farmer who is writhing in agony in the dirt.
speaker_heading: RED FACED FARMER
dialog: Well, that's that.
speaker_heading: BLACK SCREEN
text: There's a PURLING SOUND, which soon becomes defined into the
text: SOUND OF VOICES talking quietly  about whether to move or
dialog: not to move, doctors, etc.
scene_heading: CLOSE  EVELYN MULWRAY
text: Is staring down at Gittes who's lying in the screened in
text: porch of the farmers. His wife, the Red Faced Farmer, and
text: the Big Farmer are there, along with the dog.
text: The Red Faced Farmer's wife has set tea out. The farmers,
text: all of them, now seem awkward and a little embarrassed.
scene_heading: FRONT PORCH  RED FACE FARMER'S HOUSE  REACTION  GITTES 
speaker_heading: DUSK
text: He focuses on Evelyn who sits right next to him. He's got
text: dried blood down the side of his face from his nose, a huge
text: mouse on his cheek, and his clothes are torn in a couple of
dialog: spots.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (to Evelyn)
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: DUBOIS
dialog: (quietly, almost as
dialog: if he were in a
dialog: hospital)
dialog: You didn't look too good, so we
dialog: thought we better call your employer.
text: Gittes nods. He checks his watch. He looks out. It's almost
dialog: evening.
text: Gittes says nothing. The wife of the Red Faced Farmer (DUBOIS)
text: looks reproachfully at Dubois. Gittes feels the back of his
dialog: head, It obviously hurts him.
scene_heading: EXT. DUBOIS FARMHOUSE  EVENING
text: Evelyn and Gittes go out to her car, the cream colored
dialog: Packard.
text: Dubois accompanies them, along with the Big Farmer who is
text: carrying a crate of something. Gittes has cleaned himself up
dialog: a little.
speaker_heading: DUBOIS
dialog: Look here, if it's all the same with
dialog: you, we'll get your car patched up.
dialog: If you'll tell me what your trousers
dialog: run you, I'll make good on them, Mr.
dialog: Gittes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: It's okay, Mr. Dubois.
speaker_heading: DUBOIS,
dialog: (to Evelyn)
dialog: It's just that they're after everybody
dialog: out here, tearing up our irrigation
dialog: ditches trying to make our land
dialog: worthless so they can pick it up for
dialog: twenty-five dollars an acre.
text: Gittes nods.
speaker_heading: DUBOIS
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Anyway. Earl here is sorry, too. He
dialog: wants to give you something to take
dialog: back with you.
text: Gittes looks. Earl has the huge crate he's holding brim-full
text: of avocados.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Thanks, Earl.
scene_heading: INT. CAR  EVELYN &amp; GITTES  DUSK
dialog: Evelyn driving.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Thanks for coming...
text: Gittes pulls out cigarette case, takes one, offers one to
text: Evelyn who refuses.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: That dam is a con job.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: What dam?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: The one your husband opposed. They're
text: conning L.A. into building it, only
dialog: the water won't go to L.A. It'll go
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: The Valley?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Everything you can see, everything
dialog: around us. I was at the Hall of
dialog: Records today.
dialog: (whips out papers,
text: turns on the car
dialog: light)
dialog: That bother you?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (looking over papers)
dialog: In the last three months, Robert
dialog: Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma
dialog: Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer
dialog: 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb
dialog: 25,000 acres.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Jasper Lamar Crabb?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Know him?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: No, I think I'd remember.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah. They've been blowing these
dialog: farmers out of here and buying their
dialog: land for peanuts. Have any idea what
dialog: this land'll be worth with a steady
dialog: water supply? About thirty million
dialog: more than they paid.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: And Hollis knew about it?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar
dialog: Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.
text: He's pulling out his wallet, excitedly now, spilling its
text: contents onto the seat. He pulls out the obituary column
text: he'd folded up earlier in the day.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: We got it. We got it, baby.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: What? What is it?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: There was a memorial service at the
dialog: Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar
text: Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Is that unusual?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000
dialog: acres. That's unusual.
scene_heading: EXT. MAR VISTA INN AND REST HOME  NIGHT
text: Evelyn's car pulls up before the elegant Spanish rest home,
text: its entryway illuminated by streetlights. There is a small
text: sign giving the name of the place in elegant neon scroll. It
text: sits on the rolling green lawns.
text: Gittes gets out of the car with Evelyn. He offers her his
text: arm and they go up the walkway to the entrance.
scene_heading: INT. MAR VISTA INN AND REST HOME  NIGHT
text: Gittes and Evelyn are approached by an unctuous man in his
text: forties, with a flower in his buttonhole. He sees Evelyn
dialog: first.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Hello there, I'm Mr. Palmer. Can I
dialog: help you folks?
text: Then he gets a clear look at Gittes, bruised, trousers torn,
dialog: etc.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yes, I sure hope so. It's Dad.
dialog: (indicating his
dialog: disheveled appearance)
dialog: I just can't handle him anymore, can
dialog: I, sweetheart?
text: Evelyn shakes her head.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Oh my goodness.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (hastily)
dialog: Nothing to do with Dad. It's me,
dialog: actually.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: They just don't get along very well.
dialog: Dad's a lamb with anyone else.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: (not so sure)
dialog: Oh, well, I don't know.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Naturally, I want the best for him,
dialog: money is no object.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Perhaps if we could meet your father.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: There's just one question.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Do you accept anyone of the Jewish
dialog: persuasion?
text: Evelyn can't quite conceal her surprise at the question.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: (very embarrassed)
dialog: I'm sorry. We don't.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (smoothly)
dialog: Don't be sorry, neither does Dad.
dialog: Wanted to make sure though, didn't
dialog: we, honey?
text: Evelyn stares back at Gittes, amused and appalled. She manages
dialog: to nod.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Just to be certain, I wonder if you
dialog: could show us a list of your patients?
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: (polite but pointed)
dialog: We don't reveal the names of our
dialog: guests as a matter of policy. I know
dialog: you'd appreciate that if your father
dialog: came to live with us.
text: Gittes locks eyes with Palmer.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (confidentially)
dialog: That's exactly what we wanted to
dialog: hear.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Oh, good.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I wonder, is it too late for us to
dialog: have a look around?
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: I don't think so. Be happy to show
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Would you mind if we took a stroll
dialog: on our own?
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Just, if you will, confine yourself
text: to the main building. It's nearly
dialog: bedtime.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: We understand, c'mon, sweetheart.
text: He takes Evelyn.
scene_heading: INT. PARLOR  EVELYN
dialog: Looking. Either by accident or design, the primarily
text: octogenarian guests have segregated themselves. In one wing,
text: the men are playing pinochle, some are playing dominoes, one
text: elderly gentleman sits by himself carefully peeling an orange.
text: In an adjacent parlor several white-headed ladies work on a
dialog: quilt.
text: Gittes grabs Evelyn's hand.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: They're all here. Every goddam name.
text: Gittes points to the wall. It says "ACTIVITIES BOARD". There
text: are titles. "LAWN BOWLING". "BRIDGE". "FISHING". "CROQUET".
text: Below them are the names of the guests, entered under certain
dialog: activities, for certain days.
text: After Evelyn looks, she turns to Gittes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing; indicating
dialog: the ancients around
dialog: them)
dialog: You're looking at the owners of a
dialog: 50,000 acre empire.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (astonished)
dialog: They can't be.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: They may not know it but they are.
text: Gittes strolls toward the women knitting and working on the
dialog: quilt.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Hello, girls.
text: Two of the ladies giggle. The third continues to busy herself
text: with her quilt, off by herself.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Which one of you is Emma Dill?
text: Two of them say "she is," and point in different directions.
text: The third gives them a curt look and goes back to her
text: knitting. Gittes approaches her.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Are you Emma?
text: Some old voice is singing softly, "Don't Sit Under the Apple
dialog: Tree."
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I've been wanting to meet you.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Did you know that you're a very
dialog: wealthy woman?
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: (stitching, smiles)
dialog: I'm not.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Well you own a lot of land.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my
dialog: late husband owned a good deal of
dialog: beach property in Long Beach, but we
dialog: lost it.
text: Gittes looks at the quilt. In it is the head of a fish among
text: the rest of the crazy quilt pattern. Gittes spots it.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: That's just lovely.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Thank you...
text: He looks through the quilt for other pieces of the fish,
text: comes across the tail and by it the initials A.C.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (indicating tail)
dialog: Where did you get this material?
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: (what it sounds like)
dialog: The apple core club.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: The apple core?
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: No. The albacore. It's a fish. My
dialog: grandson's a member and they take
dialog: very nice care of us.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: How do they do that?
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Give us things. Not just some old
dialog: flag like this, but -
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (kneeling)
dialog: But what?
speaker_heading: PALMER'S VOICE
dialog: We're a sort of unofficial charity
dialog: of theirs, Mr. Gittes. Would you
dialog: care to come this way? Someone wants
dialog: to see you.
text: Gittes looks up, sees Palmer standing in the doorway, looking
text: taut and a little drawn. Evelyn is beside him. She gestures
text: as if there's someone behind Palmer.
text: Gittes rises.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: See you later, Emma.
text: He walks toward Palmer who waits for him to walk in front.
scene_heading: AT THE ENTRANCE HALL  MULVIHILL
text: Is waiting. He's got his hand in his pocket. Evelyn looks to
dialog: Gittes.
text: The four of them stand there, Mulvihill towering over
dialog: everyone.
speaker_heading: MULVIHILL
dialog: Come on I want you to meet somebody,
dialog: Gittes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (glancing from Palmer
dialog: to Mulvihill)
dialog: Can we leave the lady out of this?
speaker_heading: MULVIHILL
dialog: (a little uncertain)
dialog: Yeah, why not?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Okay, I'd like to walk her to her
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I'll stay.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (taking her by the
dialog: arm)
dialog: Get in the car.
speaker_heading: MULVIHILL
dialog: I'll see she makes it.
text: Mulvihill has walked up beside Gittes. He makes the mistake
text: of opening the glass door in the entryway, putting his back
text: to Gittes for a moment. Gittes swiftly pulls Mulvihill's
text: jacket up over his head. He spins him around. With his jacket
text: covering his face, Gittes hammers away at Mulvihlll, beating
text: him against the glass door, along the wall, mercilessly
text: pounding his fists into the cloth until the cloth turns red
text: and Mulvihill begins to sink to the red tile floor.
text: Palmer screams. Evelyn stands there astonished. Mulvihill's
text: gun has clattered to the floor.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (as Mulvihill hits
dialog: the floor, to Evelyn)
dialog: What are you waiting for? Get in the
dialog: car!
dialog: Evelyn goes.
text: Mulvihill tries to get up again. Palmer starts to go for the
text: gun, nearly picking it up. Gittes slaps it out of his hand
text: and kicks it.
text: It goes flying down the hall, at least thirty feet; hits the
dialog: wall.
text: Palmer goes screaming off into the night. Gittes turns back
text: to Mulvihill who starts to get up, then collapses.
text: Gittes goes out the front door, ignoring the excited audience
text: of ancients behind him.
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE
text: As Gittes walks down the pathway, he stops. Two men are coming
text: toward him. One of them is shorter, and has the nervous,
text: jerky moves of the man who slit his nose.
text: Gittes stops. The two men fan out and continue to move toward
dialog: him.
text: Gittes spots the two-tone shoes. He begins to back up.
text: Suddenly there is a pair of headlights flashing brilliantly
text: behind the two men. In a moment Evelyn's car is headed across
text: the lawn directly toward the two men, accelerating as it
text: gets near them. They look in disbelief, then dive for safety.
text: The car skids to a stop, fishtailing a little on the grass.
text: Evelyn opens the passenger door.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Get in.
text: Gittes jumps in and she takes off across the lawn, tilting
text: the elegant little neon sign on the lawn as she goes. Two
text: SHOTS ARE FIRED.
scene_heading: INT. CAR  EVELYN &amp; GITTES
text: Evelyn looking straight ahead, driving. After a moment she
text: takes one hand off the wheel and rubs her left eye a little.
text: Gittes watches her. He smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. VERANDA  MULWRAY HOME  NIGHT
text: Gittes stands on the veranda, smoking a cigarette, staring
text: off into the night.
text: Evelyn comes out to the veranda, carrying a tray with whiskey
text: and an ice bucket on it. She sets it down. Gittes turns.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (watching her pour)
dialog: Maid's night off?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (a little surprised,
dialog: he laughs)
dialog: What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's
dialog: here, that's all.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (handing Gittes his
dialog: drink)
dialog: I gave everybody the night off.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Easy, it's an innocent question.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: No question from you is innocent,
dialog: Mr. Gittes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I guess not to you, Mrs. Mulwray.
dialog: Frankly you really saved my a... my
dialog: neck tonight.
dialog: They drink.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Tell me something. Does this usually
dialog: happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Well, I'm only judging on the basis
dialog: of one afternoon and an evening, but
dialog: if that's how you go about your work,
dialog: I'd say you're lucky to get through
dialog: a whole day.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (pouring himself
dialog: another drink)
dialog: Actually this hasn't happened to me
dialog: in some time.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: When was the last time?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
text: Gittes touches his nose, winces a little.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: It was in Chinatown.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: What were you doing there?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (taking a long drink)
text: Working for the District Attorney.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Doing what?
text: Gittes looks sharply at her. Then:
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: As little as possible.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: The District Attorney gives his men
dialog: advice like that?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: They do in Chinatown.
text: She looks at him. Gittes stares off into the night.
text: Evelyn has poured herself another drink.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Bothers you to talk about it, doesn't
dialog: it?
text: Gittes gets up.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: No. I wonder... could I. Do you have
dialog: any peroxide or something?
text: He touches his nose lightly.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Oh sure. C'mon.
text: She takes his hand and leads him back into the house.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM  MIRROR
text: Gittes pulls the plaster off his nose, stares at it in the
dialog: mirror.
text: Evelyn takes some hydrogen peroxide and some cotton out of a
text: medicine cabinet. Evelyn turns Gittes' head toward her. She
text: has him sit on the pullman tile adjacent to the sink.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Doctor did a nice job...
text: She begins to work on his nose with the peroxide. Then she
text: sees his cheek, checks back in his hair.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (working on him)
dialog: So why does it bother you to talk
dialog: about it... Chinatown...
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Bothers everybody who works there,
dialog: but to me... It was...
text: Gittes shrugs.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Hold still. Why?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: You can't always tell what's going
dialog: on there.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: ...No. Why was it.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I thought I was keeping someone from
dialog: being hurt and actually I ended up
dialog: making sure they were hurt.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Could you do anything about it?
text: They're very close now as she's going over a mouse very near
dialog: his eye.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah. Make sure I don't find myself
dialog: in Chinatown anymore. Wait a second.
text: He takes hold of her and pulls her even closer,
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (momentarily freezing)
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Your eye.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (staring intently)
text: There's something black in the green
dialog: part of your eye.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (not moving)
dialog: Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: ...A flaw...
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (she almost shivers)
dialog: ...Yes, sort of a birthmark...
text: Gittes kisses her lightly, gradually rises until he's standing
text: holding her. She hesitates, then wraps her arms around him.
scene_heading: INT. MULWRAY BEDROOM  TELEPHONE
text: On a nightstand, city lights visible through the open window
text: behind it. It is RINGING. Evelyn's arm reaches INTO SHOT.
text: SOUND of something hitting the headboard. Gittes moans.
text: VIEW SHIFTS TO INCLUDE Gittes in bed, holding his head, which
text: he's just hit. Evelyn pauses in her reach to the phone. She
text: turns to him, whispers, "I'm sorry," kisses him on the head
text: and lips. PHONE CONTINUES TO RING. She picks it up.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Hello...
dialog: (in Spanish now)
dialog: No, no, I'll come and help, just
dialog: keep watching her and don't do
dialog: anything until I get there... 'bye.
text: VIEW SHIFTS AGAIN TO INCLUDE Gittes in bed, watching Evelyn
text: next to him as she's talking on the phone. She hangs up. She
text: touches Gittes' cheek lightly.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I have to go.
text: Gittes stares at her silently.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Just... I have to.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: And I want to know where.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (she starts out of
dialog: bed)
dialog: Please don't be angry... believe me,
dialog: it's got nothing to do with you.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (stopping her)
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (near tears)
dialog: Please!... Trust me this much...
dialog: (she kisses him lightly)
dialog: I'll be back. Look, there is something
dialog: I should tell you. The fishing club
dialog: that old lady mentioned, the pieces
text: off the flag.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: The Albacore Club.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: It has to do with my father.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: He owns it. You know?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I saw him.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (sitting up straight)
dialog: You saw my fa... father? When?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: This morning.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (panicked)
dialog: You didn't tell me.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: There hasn't been a lot of time.
text: She leaps out of bed, throwing on a robe.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: What did he say?
dialog: (insistent)
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: That you were jealous, and he was
dialog: worried about what you might do.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Do? To who?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing.
dialog: He wanted to know where she was.
text: Evelyn starts quickly for the bathroom, then comes back and
text: kneels by the side of the bed, takes Gittes' hand.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I want you to listen to me. My father
dialog: is a very dangerous man. You don't
dialog: know how dangerous. You don't know
dialog: how crazy.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Give me an example.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: You may think you know what's going
dialog: on, but you don't.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: That's what your father said. You're
dialog: telling me he's in back of this whole
dialog: thing?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: It's possible.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Including the death of your husband?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: It's possible. Please don't ask me
dialog: any more questions now. Just wait,
dialog: wait for me. I'll be back. I need
dialog: you here.
text: She kisses him, rushes to the bathroom, shuts the door. Gittes
text: stares at it a moment. Then leaps out of bed, rummages around,
text: tosses on his trousers. He grabs his shoes, throws them on.
text: Then hurries out of the bedroom.
scene_heading: EXT. MULWRAY HOME  GITTES
text: Running across the driveway to the garage. There are two
dialog: cars there.
text: Mulwray's Buick and Evelyn's Packard.
text: Gittes moves over to the Buick, opens the passenger's door.
scene_heading: INT. BUICK - GITTES
text: Checks the ignition. No key is in it. He pulls a couple of
text: wires from under the dash, starts to mess with them, seems
dialog: satisfied.
text: Slides out across the seat, slams the door.
scene_heading: EXT. MULWRAY DRIVEWAY  NIGHT
text: Gittes hurries over to the Packard. He gets down on the
text: driveway, lying on his back, bracing himself. With the heel
text: of his shoe, he kicks at the right rear taillight of the
text: car. He shatters the red lens, gets up. He carefully pulls
text: the red lens off the taillight, exposing the white light
text: beneath it. He tosses the red lens into the shrubbery and
text: hurries back toward the house.
text: ONE RED AND ONE WHITE TAILLIGHT  MOVING  NIGHT
text: Evelyn's car speeds along the curves on Sunset Boulevard,
text: the red and white lights coming IN AND OUT OF VIEW.
scene_heading: GITTES DRIVING  NIGHT
text: Behind the wheel of Mulwray's car, keeping a healthy distance
text: from Evelyn in front of him.
speaker_heading: EVELYN'S PACKARD
text: Pulls up before a small little bungalow house. She gets out,
text: looks up and down the street. There is nothing. She hurries
text: on up the walkway to the front door.
text: DOWN THE STREET  GITTES IN BUICK
text: Idles the engine with the lights off. He brings the car a
text: few yards further down the street, parking it near Evelyn's.
text: Gittes gets out of the car and goes up the walkway. The
text: curtains are drawn except for one of the small windows on
text: the side of the house.
text: He goes to it and looks, balancing on the edge of the porch.
text: THROUGH THE WINDOW
text: Gittes sees Evelyn's Oriental servant rush through the living
text: room of the small house. In a moment he re-emerges back
text: through the living room carrying a tray with a glass and
text: pitcher on it.
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: Around to the side of the house. He runs into shrubbery and
text: a short picket fence.
text: He climbs over it, follows along the stucco wall to a series
text: of windows at the corner of the house. These all have shades
text: on them.
text: He can hear someone crying in the house. Someone else talking
text: alternately firmly and plaintively in Spanish. Here the
text: windows have blinds. He moves to one where the blind is not
text: completely drawn.
text: There's an inch or so of space at the bottom.
text: THROUGH THE WINDOW
text: Gittes can see the servant again. Evelyn is pacing back and
text: forth in and out of his line of vision. After a moment someone
text: rises INTO SHOT, obviously from lying on a bed. The figure
text: is just a few feet from Evelyn. Her tear-stained face comes
text: INTO VIEW. It is unmistakably the girl Gittes had last seen
dialog: with Hollis Mulwray.
text: Mulwray's girlfriend. She's looking up to Evelyn, speaking
text: in Spanish. Her words are not discernible but the tone is
text: bitter, anguished. A newspaper is strewn about the room.
text: Evelyn kneels. She insists that the girl swallow down some
dialog: pills.
text: The girl reluctantly does.
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: Continues to watch.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET  EVELYN  NIGHT
text: Emerges from the house, goes to her car and gets in.
speaker_heading: INT. CAR
text: Evelyn sees Gittes sitting in her car, staring coldly at
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Okay, give me the keys.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (stunned, furious)
dialog: You bastard.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: It's either that or you drive to the
dialog: police yourself.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: The police?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your
dialog: husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: She's not tied up!
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: You know what I mean. You're keeping
text: her there against her will.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I am not!
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Then let's go talk to her.
text: Gittes starts to get out of the car. Evelyn grabs his arm,
text: nearly screaming:
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: No!
text: Her intensity actually rips Gittes' already partially torn
dialog: jacket.
text: He looks at it and her. It seems to have a momentary calming
dialog: effect on both of them.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (continuing)
text: She's too upset.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: What about?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Hollis' death. I tried to keep it
dialog: from her, I didn't want her upset
dialog: before I could make plans for her to
dialog: leave.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: You mean she just found out?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: That's not what it looks like, Mrs.
dialog: Mulwray.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: What does it look like?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Like she knows about Hollis' death.
dialog: Like she knows more than you want
dialog: her to tell.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: You're insane.
text: Gittes explodes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Just tell me the truth. I'm not the
dialog: police. I don't care what you've
dialog: done. I'm not going to hurt you, but
dialog: one way or another I'm going to know.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: You won't go to the police if I tell
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I will if you don't.
text: A long pause. Evelyn's head sinks onto the steering wheel,
text: her hair covering her face.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: She's my sister.
text: Evelyn is breathing very deeply now. Not crying, but the
text: kind of deep breathing that comes from real hysteria. Gittes
text: puts an arm on her shoulder.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Take it easy... If it's your sister
dialog: it's your sister... why all the
dialog: secrecy?
text: She lifts her head and looks up at him. He's genuinely
dialog: puzzled.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (really upset)
dialog: I can't...
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Because of Hollis? Because she was
dialog: seeing your husband? Was that it?
dialog: Jesus Christ, say something. Was
dialog: that it?
text: She nods. Gittes sighs.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (finally)
dialog: I would never ever have harmed Hollis.
dialog: I loved him more than my own family.
dialog: He was the most gentle, decent man
dialog: imaginable... and he put up with
dialog: more from me than you'll ever know...
dialog: I just wanted him to be happy...
text: She begins to cry softly.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: I took your husband's Buick...
text: (he opens the car
dialog: door)
dialog: I'll return it tomorrow.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Aren't you coming back with me?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody
dialog: about this.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: ...That's not what I meant.
text: There is a long moment of silence. Gittes looks over to
text: Evelyn. Her hair covers most of her face from him.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (finally)
dialog: Yeah, well... I'm very tired, Mrs.
dialog: Mulwray. Good night.
text: He gets out and slams the car door. She drives off.
scene_heading: INT. SHOWER  GITTES' APARTMENT  GITTES
text: The spray is hitting him full on the top of the head. Gittes
text: is so exhausted he's literally holding onto the nozzle as
text: the water pours down. He shuts the shower off, reaches weakly
text: for a towel, dabs his nose lightly with it.
scene_heading: INT. GITTES' BEDROOM  GITTES
text: Pads around in elegant silk pajamas.
text: He walks over to the window where morning light is streaming
text: in. He closes the curtains, collapses on the bed, on top of
text: the covers, inert. Almost immediately the PHONE RINGS. Gittes
text: lets it go on for a moment, then picks it up without saying
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: VOICE ON PHONE
dialog: (male)
dialog: Gittes?... Gittes?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: VOICE ON PHONE
dialog: Ida Sessions wants to see you.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: VOICE 0N PHONE
dialog: Ida Sessions, you remember Ida.
text: Gittes slowly rises to one elbow.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah?... I do?
speaker_heading: VOICE ON PHONE
dialog: Sure you do.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida
dialog: wants to see me she can call me at
dialog: my office.
text: He hangs up, falls back down. PHONE RINGS AGAIN. AND AGAIN.
text: Gittes swears, picks it up.
speaker_heading: VOICE ON PHONE
text: 684 1/2 East Tensington. Echo Park.
dialog: She begged me to call. She's waiting
dialog: for you.
text: Before Gittes can say anything, the phone clicks dead.
scene_heading: EXT. CERRITOS TOWER ROAD  HOLLYWOOD HILLS  EARLY MORNING
text: Gittes pulls up. It is a bungalow courtyard with a very narrow
text: walkway and sickly green stucco.
scene_heading: EXT. IDA SESSIONS' APARTMENT  DAY
text: Gittes at the front door. It's slightly ajar. He knocks.
text: Nothing. He opens it and enters.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: Morning light filters through the half-open blinds. Dust
text: particles in the shafts of light. It's still and empty. Gittes
text: sees something down the hall, under the legs of a telephone
text: table. Gittes moves toward it. It is grotesque. When he gets
text: closer he can see it's a wilted head of lettuce. Just inside
text: the kitchen some radishes and onions lie on the linoleum.
text: Gittes walks on into the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: Clearing the kitchen counter, Gittes sees IDA SESSIONS lying
text: on her back on the floor, surrounded by the groceries from a
text: broken bag.
text: Ice cream has melted around her. Her eyes are open, a stream
text: of ants is moving across the ice cream and into her mouth.
text: She's recognizable as the woman who posed as Evelyn Mulwray.
text: Gittes kneels over her. He gingerly opens her handbag, fishes
text: for its contents, takes them and looks at them on the kitchen
dialog: counter.
text: Wallet with a few bills in it, driver's license with her
text: name. A Screen Actors Guild card. Gittes nods, turns,
text: carefully replaces the items in the purse.
text: He idly opens the broom closet, pantry, and even Frigidaire,
text: which is all but empty. Then he steps over her body and moves
text: across the hall to a door that is slightly ajar.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: Gittes enters and turns on the light.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Find anything interesting, Gittes?
text: Escobar and another PLAINCLOTHED MAN stand in the bathroom
text: by the entrance to the bedroom door. Gittes turns around. A
text: THIRD MAN is now coming down the hall from the bedroom.
text: Gittes looks at the two, doesn't reply.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Didn't you call?
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: (jerk of his head
dialog: toward the kitchen)
dialog: How do you happen to know her?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I don't.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: (turning toward other
dialog: room)
dialog: Let me show you something.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: Escobar points to the number "MU 7279" on the side of one of
text: the kitchen cabinets.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Isn't that your number?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Is it? I forget. I don't call myself
dialog: that often.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Just to be on the safe side, we had
dialog: Loach here give you a ring.
text: He indicates one of his assistants.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR'S ASSISTANT
dialog: (a slight sneer)
dialog: What happened to your nose, Gittes?
text: Somebody slam a bedroom window on
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (right back, smiling)
dialog: Nope, your wife got excited, crossed
dialog: her legs a little too quick. You
dialog: understand, pal.
text: The Assistant starts to move for Gittes who is ready for
dialog: him.
text: Escobar steps between the two.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: (to other Assistant)
dialog: Loach.
dialog: (Escobar pulls out a
dialog: drawer)
dialog: How about these? Look familiar?
text: In the open drawer are the photos of Mulwray and the girl in
text: the park, boat, and at the El Macando on the veranda.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (no point in denying
dialog: it)
dialog: Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: How did she...
dialog: (meaning the corpse)
dialog: ...happen to have them?
text: Gittes takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Either you tell me or I guess 'cause
dialog: I don't have the answer.
text: Escobar nods.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: You really think I'm stupid, don't
dialog: you, Gittes?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I don't think about it one way or
dialog: the other. But if you want, give me
dialog: a day or two, and I'll get back to
dialog: you. Now I'd like to go home.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: I want the rest of the pictures.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: What pictures?
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: (meaning the corpse)
dialog: This broad hired you, Gittes, not
dialog: Evelyn Mulwray.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down
dialog: Mulwray, she hired you, and that's
dialog: how you happen to know Mulwray was
dialog: murdered.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I heard it was an accident.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: C'mon, you think you're dealing with
dialog: a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had
dialog: salt water in his goddam lungs! Now
dialog: how did he get that... in a fresh
dialog: water reservoir?
text: Gittes is surprised at this piece of information, but remains
text: nonplussed.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: You were following him night and
dialog: day. You saw who killed him. You
dialog: even took pictures of it. It was
dialog: Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying
dialog: you off like a slot machine ever
dialog: since her husband died.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: You accusing me of extortion?
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I don't think I need a day or two.
dialog: You're even dumber than you think I
dialog: think you are. Not only that, I'd
dialog: never extort a nickel out of my worst
dialog: enemy, that's where I draw the line,
dialog: Escobar.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Yeah, I once knew a whore who for
dialog: enough money would piss in a
dialog: customer's face, but she'd never
dialog: shit on his chest. That's where she
text: drew the line.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Well, I hope she wasn't too much of
dialog: a disappointment to you, Lou.
text: Escobar manages a thin smile.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: I want those photographs, Gittes.
dialog: We're talking about accessory after
dialog: the fact, conspiracy, and extortion.
dialog: Minimum.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Why do you think Mulwray's body was
dialog: moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray
text: knocked off her husband in the ocean
dialog: and thought it would look like more
dialog: of an accident if she hauled him up
dialog: to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
dialog: This is a little telling.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Mulwray was murdered and moved because
dialog: somebody didn't want his body found
text: in the ocean.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: And why's that?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: He found out somebody was dumping
dialog: water there. That's what they were
text: trying to cover up by moving him.
text: This stops Escobar. He's dumbfounded by it.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: C'mon I'll show you.
text: Escobar hesitates.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: C'mon make a decision, Lou. You're
dialog: in charge.
text: The men around Escobar look to him. Escobar grudgingly nods.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT  STORM DRAIN
text: It yawns AT CAMERA, only a trickle of water dropping into
dialog: the ocean.
text: VIEW WIDENS TO INCLUDE Escobar, Gittes, and two Plain
text: clothesmen, standing and staring at the empty pipe as if
dialog: they expect it to talk.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (squinting in sunlight)
text: It's too late.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Too late for what?
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: They only dump the water at night.
text: A THIRD ASSISTANT runs down the side of the cliff and Over
dialog: to Escobar.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Reach anybody?
speaker_heading: THIRD ASSISTANT
dialog: Yelburton, he's the new chief.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: I know who he is. Well?
speaker_heading: THIRD ASSISTANT
dialog: He says -
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I know what he says.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: (to Gittes)
dialog: Shut up.
dialog: (to Assistant)
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: THIRD ASSISTANT
dialog: Yelburton says they're irrigating in
dialog: the valley. There's always a little
dialog: runoff when they do that. And he
dialog: says is Gittes knows that, and has
dialog: been going around making irresponsible
dialog: accusations for the last week.
text: Escobar turns to Gittes. Stares at him for a long moment.
speaker_heading: ONE OF ASSISTANTS
dialog: Let's swear out a warrant for her
dialog: arrest. What are we waiting for?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (meaning Escobar)
dialog: Because he just made lieutenant, and
dialog: he wants to hang onto his little
dialog: gold bar.
text: Escobar stares hatefully at Gittes.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Have your client in my office in two
dialog: hours and remember. I don't have to
dialog: let you go. I've got you for
dialog: withholding evidence right now.
scene_heading: EXT. MULWRAY HOME  DAY
text: Gittes in Mulwray's Buick whips into the driveway. He looks
text: in the garage. Evelyn's car is gone. Only the Gardener's
text: truck is there.
text: Gittes hurries along the pathway and up to the house. He
text: rings the doorbell. Scarcely waiting for an answer he tries
text: it. It's locked.
text: He reaches into his pocket pulls out his cigarette case,
text: takes a pick out of the side and starts to fool with the
dialog: lock.
text: The Maid opens the door abruptly, stares in some surprise at
dialog: Gittes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Where's Mrs. Mulwray?
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: No esta.
text: Gittes looks past the Maid to the center of the living room
text: where luggage is packed and neatly piled.
text: The Maid is actually in the process of throwing covers over
dialog: the furniture.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (indicating luggage)
dialog: Is Mrs. Mulwray going someplace?...
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: on a trip?... vacation?...
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: No esta in casa.
text: Gittes nods. He continues through the house and out back to
text: the veranda.
scene_heading: EXT. MULWRAY VERANDA  GITTES
text: Is unsettled. Sees the Gardener working by the pond. He
text: wanders a few yards in that direction.
speaker_heading: GARDENER
text: Spots Gittes, half-bows, nods and smiles.
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: In turn, nods, smiles.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Bad for glass.
speaker_heading: GARDENER
text: Breaks into a big grin. Nods again.
speaker_heading: GARDENER
dialog: Oh yes, bad for glass.
text: He points to the newly mown lawn.
speaker_heading: GARDENER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Salt water velly bad for glass.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Can't quite believe what he's heard,
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Salt water?
text: The Gardener nods vigorously. Points to the pond.
speaker_heading: GARDENER
dialog: Velly velly bad.
text: Gittes has moved to the pond. He kneels. Clinging to the
text: edge of it he can now see as he could have before if he'd
text: looked closely, a starfish.
speaker_heading: CLOSE STARFISH
text: It has one leg missing. The fifth point on the star is just
text: beginning to grow back.
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: Touches the water, tastes it. He licks his lips, then spots
text: something glinting in the bottom of the pond.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: What's that... down there?
text: The Gardener peers into the pond.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...there.
text: The Gardener spots it. He rolls up his trousers, gets in the
text: pond, and reaches into the bottom, his chin actually touching
dialog: the water.
text: He misses the object, which seems to scoot away like an
text: animal. Then he grasps it. He lifts it out of the water and
text: holds a pair of eye glasses, rimless, bent, his finger poking
text: through the frame where one lens is shattered.
text: The Gardener seems surprised. Gittes looks at the glasses.
text: They are heavily bifocal and reflect the sun.
scene_heading: INT. MULWRAY HOME
text: Gittes holds the phone to his ear. On the telephone table,
text: lying on his handkerchief are the glasses.
text: The Maid hovers around over Gittes' shoulder, uneasily
text: watching him.
speaker_heading: CROSS' VOICE
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Have you got your checkbook handy,
dialog: Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
speaker_heading: CROSS' VOICE
dialog: You've got her? Where?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Do you remember the figures we

speaker_heading: CROSS' VOICE
dialog: Of course I do. Where are you?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: At your daughter's house. How soon
dialog: can you get here?
speaker_heading: CROSS' VOICE
dialog: Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be
dialog: there as well?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Either that or she'll be in jail.
speaker_heading: CROSS' VOICE
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Just bring your checkbook.
text: Gittes hangs up.
scene_heading: EXT. BUNGALOW HOUSE  ADELAIDE DRIVE
text: Gittes pulls up in Mulwray's Buick. He hurries to the front
text: door, pounds on it.
text: The Chinese servant answers the door.
speaker_heading: CHINESE SERVANT
dialog: You wait.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (short sentence in
dialog: Chinese)
dialog: You wait.
text: Gittes pushes past him. Evelyn, looking a little worn but
text: glad to see him hurries to the door. She takes Gittes' arm.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: How are you? I was calling you.
text: She looks at him, searching his face.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah?
text: They move into the living room. Gittes is looking around it.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Did you get some sleep?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (abruptly)
dialog: Where's the girl?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Upstairs. Why?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I want to see her.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: ...she's having a bath now... why do
dialog: you want to see her?
text: Gittes continues to look around. He sees clothes laid out
text: for packing in a bedroom off the living room.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Going somewhere?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch.
dialog: Why?
text: Gittes doesn't answer. He goes to the phone and dials.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: What are you doing? What's wrong? I
dialog: told you we've got a 4:30.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (cutting her off)
dialog: You're going to miss your train!
dialog: (then, into phone)
dialog: Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's
dialog: above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah,
dialog: soon as you can.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: What did you do that for?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (a moment, then)
dialog: You know any good criminal lawyers?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Don't worry. I can recommend a couple.
dialog: They're expensive but you can afford
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (evenly but with great
dialog: anger)
dialog: What the hell is this all about?
text: Gittes looks at her, then takes the handkerchief out of his
text: breast pocket. Unfolds it on a coffee table, revealing the
text: bifocal glasses, one lens still intact. Evelyn stares dumbly
text: at them.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I found these in your backyard... in
dialog: your fish pond. They belonged to
dialog: your husband, didn't they?... didn't
dialog: they?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yes positively. That's where he was
dialog: drowned...
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: What are you saying?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: There's no time for you to be shocked
dialog: by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The
dialog: coroner's report proves he was killed
dialog: in salt water. Just take my word for
dialog: it. Now I want to know how it happened
dialog: and why. I want to know before Escobar
dialog: gets here because I want to hang
dialog: onto my license.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about. This is the most insane...
dialog: the craziest thing I ever...
text: Gittes has been in a state of near frenzy himself. gets up,
text: shakes her.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Stop it! I'll make it easy. You
dialog: were jealous, you fought, he fell,
text: hit his head. It was an accident,
dialog: but his girl is a witness. You've
dialog: had to pay her off. You don't have
dialog: the stomach to harm her, but you've
dialog: got the money to shut her up. Yes or
dialog: no?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: ...no...
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Who is she? And don't give me that
dialog: crap about it being your sister. You
dialog: don't have a sister.
text: Evelyn is trembling.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I'll tell you the truth...
text: Gittes smiles.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: That's good. Now what's her name?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Katherine.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Katherine?... Katherine who?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: She's my daughter.
text: Gittes stares at her. He's been charged with anger and when
text: Evelyn says this it explodes. He hits her full in the face.
text: Evelyn stares back at him. The blow has forced tears from
text: her eyes, but she makes no move, not even to defend herself.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I said the truth!
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: She's my sister.
text: Gittes slaps her again.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: She's my daughter.
text: Gittes slaps her again.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: My sister.
text: He hits her again.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: My daughter, my sister.
text: He belts her finally, knocking her into a cheap Chinese vase
text: which shatters and she collapses on the sofa, sobbing.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I said I want the truth.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (almost screaming it)
dialog: She's my sister and my daughter!
text: Kyo comes running down the stairs.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (continuing; in Chinese)
dialog: For God's sake, Kyo, keep her
dialog: upstairs, go back!
text: Kyo turns after staring at Gittes for a moment then goes
text: back upstairs.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: My father and I, understand, or is
dialog: it too tough for you?
text: Gittes doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: ...he had a breakdown... the dam
dialog: broke... my mother died... he became
dialog: a little boy... I was fifteen...
dialog: he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast,
dialog: what clothes to wear!... It
dialog: happened... then I ran away...
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: To Mexico...
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Hollis came and took... care of me...
dialog: after she was born... he said... he
dialog: took care of her... I couldn't see
dialog: her... I wanted to but I couldn't...
dialog: I just want to see her once in a
dialog: while... take care of her... that's
dialog: all... but I don't want her to
dialog: know... I don't want her to know...
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: ...so that's why you hate him...
text: Evelyn looks slowly up at Gittes.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: No... for turning his back on me
dialog: after it happened! He couldn't face
dialog: it...
dialog: (weeping)
dialog: I hate him.
text: Gittes suddenly feels the need to loosen his tie.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah... where are you taking her
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Back to Mexico.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: You can't go by train. Escobar'll be
dialog: looking for you everywhere.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: How about a plane?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: That's worse... Just get out of here.
dialog: Walk out, leave everything.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I have to go home and get my things.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I'll take care of it.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Where can we go?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: ...where does Kyo live?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: With us.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: On his day off. Get the exact address.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Okay...
text: She stops suddenly.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Those didn't belong to Hollis.
text: For a moment Gittes doesn't know what she's talking about.
text: Then he follows her gaze to the glasses lying on his
dialog: handkerchief.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: He didn't wear bifocals.
text: Gittes picks up the glasses, stares at the lens, is
text: momentarily lost in them.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
text: From the stairs. She has her arm around Katherine.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Say hello to Mr. Gittes, sweetheart.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: (from the stairs)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: Rises a little shakily from the arm
text: of the sofa.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Hello.
text: With her arm around the girl, talking in Spanish, Evelyn
text: hurries her toward the bedroom. In a moment she re-emerges.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (calling down)
dialog: He lives at 1712 Alameda... do you
dialog: know where that is?
speaker_heading: REACTION  GITTES

speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah,
dialog: listen, pal, Escobar's going to try
dialog: and book me in about five minutes...
dialog: relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the
dialog: office for two hours. If you don't
dialog: hear from me, you and Duffy meet me
dialog: at 1712 Alameda.
speaker_heading: WALSH'S VOICE
dialog: Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't
dialog: it?
text: The front BELL RINGS.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I know where it is! Just do it.
text: Gittes hangs up and goes to the door. He opens it. No one is
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (not even bothering
dialog: to look around the
dialog: sides)
dialog: Come on in, Lou. We're both too late.
text: Escobar and his minions appear from either side of the door.
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: Looks like she flew the coop.
text: Escobar nods.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: I don't suppose you got any idea
dialog: Where she went?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Matter of fact I do.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Her maid's house. I think she knows
dialog: something's up.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: What's the maid's address?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: She lives in Pedro. I'll write it
dialog: down for you.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: No, Gittes, you'll show us.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: If she's not there, you're going
dialog: downtown, and you're staying there
text: til she shows up.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (deliberately petulant)
dialog: Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
text: (shoving him toward
dialog: the door)
dialog: Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.
scene_heading: EXT. SAN PEDRO  29TH STREET  DAY

speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Well, let's go.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
text: Escobar waits.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Let me bring her down myself... she's
dialog: not armed or nothing... she won't be
dialog: any problem... I'd just like a minute
dialog: alone with her... It would mean
dialog: something... to... her... and to
dialog: me.
text: Escobar shakes his head. For a moment it looks like it means
dialog: no.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: You never learn, do you, Gittes?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (a little chagrined)
dialog: I guess not.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Give you three minutes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Gee, thanks, Lou.
text: Gittes gets out of the car, glances around, goes up the

text: He waits. It opens. It's a WOMAN who's not recognizable.
text: She's got the remnants of a black eye.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Yes?...
text: Gittes looks past her to Curly, the fisherman from the first

speaker_heading: CURLY

speaker_heading: CURLY

speaker_heading: WIFE

speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Thanks just the same, Curly. I could

speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Forget it. How would you like to pay
dialog: me off by taking a couple of
dialog: passengers to Ensenada... you'd have
dialog: to leave tonight.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I might be able to squeeze an extra
dialog: seventy-five bucks out of it for
dialog: you. Maybe an even hundred.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Plus what I owe you?
speaker_heading: GITTES

speaker_heading: CURLY

speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: (a little worried)

speaker_heading: GITTES

speaker_heading: GITTES
text: Stares at the bifocal lenses as Cross continues to look
text: through the obituary column. He looks up.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: What does this mean?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
text: Gittes is holding the bifocals with the broken lens now.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Right here, in this pond. You drowned
dialog: him... and you left these.
text: Cross looks at the glasses.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: ...the coroner's report showed Mulwray

speaker_heading: CROSS

dialog: Haven't the faintest idea.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: That's where life begins... marshes,
dialog: sloughs, tide-pools... he was
dialog: fascinated by them... you know when
dialog: we first came out here he figured
dialog: that if you dumped water onto desert
dialog: sand it would percolate down into
dialog: the bedrock and stay there, instead
text: of evaporating the way it does in
dialog: most reservoirs. You'd lose only
dialog: twenty percent instead of seventy or
dialog: eighty. He made this city.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: And that's what you were going to do
dialog: in the Valley?
scene_heading: EXT. POND  CROSS AND GITTES
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: (after a long moment)
dialog: No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am
dialog: doing with the Valley. The bond issue
dialog: passes Tuesday. There'll be ten
dialog: million to build an aqueduct and
dialog: reservoir. I'm doing it.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: There's going to be some irate
dialog: citizens when they find out they're
dialog: paying for water they're not getting.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: That's all taken care of. You see,
dialog: Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the
dialog: water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to
dialog: the water.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: How do you do that?
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Just incorporate the Valley into the
dialog: city so the water goes to L.A. after
dialog: all. It's very simple.
text: Gittes nods.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (then)
dialog: How much are you worth?
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: (shrugs, then)
dialog: I have no idea. How much do you want?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: I want to know what you're worth.
dialog: Over ten million?
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Oh, my, yes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Then why are you doing it? How much
dialog: better can you eat? What can you buy
dialog: that you can't already afford?
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: (a long moment, then:)
text: The future, Mr. Gittes. The future.
dialog: Now where's the girl?... I want the
dialog: only daughter I have left... as you
dialog: found out, Evelyn was lost to me a
dialog: long time ago.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (with sarcasm)
dialog: Who do you blame for that? Her?
text: Cross makes a funny little cock of his head.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: I don't blame myself. You see, Mr.
dialog: Gittes, most people never have to
dialog: face the fact that at the right time
dialog: and right place, they're capable of
dialog: anything. Take those glasses from
dialog: him, will you, Claude?
text: Mulvihill moves INTO VIEW. Extends his hand for the glasses.
text: Gittes doesn't move.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: It's not worth it, Mr. Gittes. It's
dialog: really not worth it.
text: Gittes hands over the glasses.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Take us to the girl. Either Evelyn
dialog: allows me to see her, or I'm not
text: averse to seeing Evelyn in jail. If
dialog: I have to buy the jail. Hollis and
dialog: Evelyn kept her from me for fifteen
dialog: years. It's been too long, I'm too
dialog: old.
scene_heading: EXT. CHINATOWN STREET  NIGHT
text: The streets are crowded. Here and there one can see Chinese
dialog: in traditional dress.
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: Driving slowly, spots Katherine with Ramon and luggage, nearly
text: lost in the crowd. They are walking toward a car parked near
text: a laundry truck.
text: Gittes sees them, keeps driving.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: Stop the car. Stop the car!
text: Mulvihill tries to clobber Gittes. Gittes elbows him. The
text: car jumps the curb and hits a lamppost.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET  CROSS
text: Leaps out of the car shouting:
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Katherine! Katherine! Wait!
text: Gittes is after him, grabbing him. Cross tries to swing at
text: Gittes with his cane. Mulvihill comes up behind Gittes and
text: the three of them begin an awkward wrestling match, the crowd
text: scattering, Mulvihill pulling his revolver, trying to hit
text: Gittes on the side of the head. The three men crash to the
dialog: pavement.
speaker_heading: CURLY
text: Starts out of the car toward Gittes. Gittes sees him.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: No, Curly, get 'em out of here! Get
dialog: 'em out of here!
text: He bites Mulvihill's hand and furiously pounds it into the
text: sidewalk, shaking gun loose. Mulvihill and Gittes try for it
dialog: but someone else has it.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
text: Holds the gun. She's shaking but apparently in control of
dialog: herself.
speaker_heading: GITTES
text: Rises to his feet. Mulvihill starts to help Cross up.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: No, don't help him. Don't do anything.
text: Mulvihill doesn't move. Cross rises on his own. Evelyn holds
text: the revolver on him.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
text: She's gone. It's no good.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (moving to Evelyn)
dialog: Let me handle that.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (to Gittes)
dialog: I'm all right.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (she's not)
dialog: Sure, but I'd like to handle it.
text: Evelyn backs up as her father takes a step toward her.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: You're going to have to kill me,
dialog: Evelyn. Either that or tell me where
dialog: she is.
text: Evelyn is backing up. Cross moving on her. Evelyn cocks the
dialog: pistol.
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: How many years have I got?... she's
dialog: mine too.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: She's never going to know that.
text: There's the SOUND of a SIREN. Cross lunges toward her. Gittes
dialog: grabs Cross.
text: Duffy and Walsh are elbowing through the crowd. Gittes sees
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.
dialog: (to Walsh)
dialog: Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to
dialog: bring the police department with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all
dialog: over the place. You oughta know
dialog: better.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (to Walsh, meaning
dialog: Cross)
dialog: Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart,
dialog: will you?
dialog: (moving to Evelyn)
text: Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in
text: Pedro, near the Starkist cannery.
dialog: It's the Evening Star. He'll be
dialog: waiting. I'll take care of this.
text: She looks to Gittes. He looks at her. She turns and he looks
text: at her.
text: She turns and Escobar is standing between her and it.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run
dialog: around like that.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know
dialog: what's going on. Let her go. I'll
dialog: explain it later.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious
dialog: offense pointing that at an officer
dialog: of the law. It's a felony.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: (starting toward her)
dialog: I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Lou, she will kill you. Let her go
dialog: for now. You don't know.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: Gittes, stay outta this.
text: Escobar continues to move toward her. Gittes grabs him.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (to Evelyn)
dialog: Now take off.
text: Evelyn gets in the car. She starts it. Gittes lets Escobar
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: I'll just have her followed. She's
dialog: not going anywhere.
text: There's a single GUNSHOT. Both men look surprised. Down the
text: block a uniformed officer has fired, standing beside his
text: double-parked car.
text: Duffy's sedan slows to a stop in the middle of the street.
text: It jerks a couple of times, still in gear, then comes to a
dialog: halt.
text: Gittes rushes to the car. He opens it. Evelyn falls out,
text: inert.
text: Blood is pouring from her right eye.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: No!
text: He holds onto Evelyn as Escobar and others hurry up. Cross
text: himself elbows through.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Where is he? I'll kill him, I'll
dialog: kill the son of a bitch.
text: Several officers contain Gittes.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: (to Escobar)
dialog: Who is he, get his name? I'll kill
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: (badly shaken)
dialog: Take it easy, take it easy, it was
dialog: an accident.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: An accident?
text: Gittes looks down. What he sees horrifies him. Cross is on
text: the ground, holding Evelyn's body, crying.
speaker_heading: GITTES
dialog: Get him away from her. He's
dialog: responsible for everything. Get him
dialog: away from her!
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: Jake, you're very disturbed. You're
dialog: crazy. That's her father.
text: Walsh and Duffy elbow through the crowd.
speaker_heading: ESCOBAR
dialog: (to them)
dialog: You wanna do your partner the biggest
dialog: favor of his life? Take him home.
dialog: Just get him the hell out of here!
text: Duffy bear hugs the protesting Gittes, along with Walsh,
text: literally dragging him away from the scene, with Gittes trying
dialog: to shake free.
text: Through the crowd noises, Walsh can be heard saying, "Forget
dialog: it, Jake. It's Chinatown."
