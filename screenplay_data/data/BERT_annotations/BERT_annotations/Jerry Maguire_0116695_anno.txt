speaker_heading: JERRY'S VOICE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It was the oddest, most unexpected

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY'S VOICE
dialog: What started out as one page
dialog: became twenty-five. Suddenly I was

dialog: remembering the simple pleasures
dialog: of this job, how I ended up here
dialog: out of law school, the way a
dialog: stadium sounds when one of my
dialog: players performs well on the

dialog: said:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SHOT OF DICKY FOX

speaker_heading: DICKY FOX
dialog: The key to this job is personal

dialog: 
text: As Jerry continues typing, his voice is excited now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY'S VOICE
dialog: And suddenly it was all pretty
dialog: clear. The answer was fewer
dialog: clients. Caring for them, caring
dialog: for ourselves, and the games too.
dialog: Starting our lives, really.
dialog: 
dialog: SHOT OF SENTENCE: We must embrace what is still virginal
dialog: about our own enthusiasm, we must crack open the tightly
dialog: clenched fist and give back a little for the common good, we
dialog: must simply be the best versions of ourselves... that
dialog: goodness will be unbeatable and the money will appear.

text: ("Finally, someone said it!") Suddenly another agent begins

text: BACK TO DOROTHY
dialog: 
text: She takes one of her son's kleenex sheets, as an elegant

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What's wrong, mom?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: First class is what's wrong. It
dialog: used to be a better meal. Now

dialog: 
text: She pulls out the Mission Statement, aware that she's been

scene_heading: INT. LAX AIRPORT TERMINAL -- MORNING
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (quietly, like a
dialog: coach)
dialog: You'll know when you see him.
dialog: You'll know when you see him.
dialog: 
text: Bobbi scans the crowd. She spots Monkeyface, large and burly
text: in tiger-print sweats. He looks like Mickey Dolenz. He
text: holds flowers.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Oh my God, you're right. I know.
dialog: (Jerry smiles)
dialog: He's not The One. He's not the
dialog: One.
dialog: 
text: Jerry's face falls. Bobbi Fallon moves into the embrace,
text: faking it. Jerry moves ahead, turning back to see the doomed
text: couple. Melancholy now, he continues forward through the
text: crowded airport and the expectant faces of those waiting for
dialog: loved ones. Music.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LUGGAGE AREA -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: Dorothy looks through the rubber flaps of the luggage
text: conveyor belt. She clutches a cup of coffee. In the
text: background, other SMI agents' grab their bags and exit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Ray! Ray!
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Can I help?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Oh. Hi. I work in your office.
dialog: I was on the junket to the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I know who y6u are. You're
dialog: Dorothy Boyd. You're in...
dialog: wait... you're in Accounts. You

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Hmm. Pretty good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Now what did you lose?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: My son... my mind...
dialog: 
text: Over her shoulder, Maguire sees Ray rounding the corner,
text: riding the luggage conveyor belt like Washington crossing the
dialog: Delaware.
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Well, while I go look for him, why
dialog: don't you hang onto this curious
dialog: gentleman behind you --
dialog: 
text: Dorothy turns, is greatly relieved to see Ray, and snatches
text: him off the belt. She bends down into his face. She speaks
text: softly but intensely, with no frills.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Remember "imagination?"...
dialog: remember what that means? Well,
dialog: this is one of my bosses so you
dialog: will now IMAGINE me screaming at
dialog: you right now. Do NOT do that
dialog: again. Ever ever EVER.
dialog: 
text: She rises, shifting back to being a somewhat relaxed young

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Well, thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Well, take care.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: And have fun at your bachelor
dialog: party.
dialog:

text: freezes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Oh no.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: No no. I knew.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (slow sigh)
dialog: Nnnnn. I just killed the surprise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: No, I'm just... anxiously looking
dialog: past it. I already had my
dialog: bachelor party. It was called "my
dialog: twenties." See you later.
dialog: 
text: Jerry takes off.
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: I loved your memo, by the way.
dialog: 
text: He stops. Turns. She flashes the well-thumbed copy in her
text: purse. Jerry takes a step closer, interested and flattered.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Thanks... actually, it was just a
dialog: "Mission Statement."
dialog: 
text: Ray has taken Jerry's free hand, and begun swinging on him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: I think in this age, optimism like
dialog: that... it's a revolutionary act.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (eager for feedback)
dialog: You think so?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Oh tsht. Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I appreciate that, because some of
dialog: that stuff... you know, it was two
dialog: in the morning and...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: -- the part about "we should
dialog: embrace what it is still virginal
dialog: about our enthusiasm" --
dialog: 
text: Jerry looks slightly edgy at the naked vulnerability of his
dialog: words.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: -- "and we should all force open
text: the tightly-clenched fist of
dialog: commerce, and give a little back
dialog: for the greater good.". I mean, I
dialog: was inspired, and I'm an
dialog: accountant. Ray, don't spill my
dialog: coffee.
dialog: 
text: Jerry looks more nervous, as Ray has now taken his mother's
text: hand. He is now swinging on both of them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: One-two-three... swing.
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Hey. To respect yourself enough
dialog: to say it out loud, to put
dialog: yourself out there, so openly...
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: ... I don't know, it got me.
dialog: 
text: Now Jerry looks concerned, as Ray continues swinging happily.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: One-two-three, swing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Thanks. May I offer you both a
dialog: ride?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Oh no. I'm sure it would just
dialog: make your day to drive us all the
dialog: way to Manhattan Beach, taking
dialog: that left down to little tiny
dialog: Waterloo street where you have to
dialog: play chicken with oncoming
dialog: traffic, and your life flashes
dialog: before your eyes, but -- hey, I've
dialog: obviously had too much coffee and
dialog: all -- here's my sister Laurel to
dialog: pick us up. Thanks, though. Bye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Dorothy. Ray. A pleasure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: One-two...
dialog: 
text: Jerry lets Ray down easy. The kid is a little disappointed.
text: But Maguire bows, always courtly, and exits to get his bag.
text: He then realizes something amiss and returns quickly, pulling
text: Ray's hand up again and completing the swing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: ... three, swing.
dialog: 
text: Ray is now happy, in love even, as Jerry exits. Dorothy
text: laughs, as her sister arrives. LAUREL BOYD is 36. No make-up,
text: no bullshit. Laurel has a pin on her sweater, which catches
text: on dorothy's shirt as they hug.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Come on, I'm double-parked.
dialog: 
text: Dorothy returns to the world of motherhood, bending down,
text: gathering Ray's toys. She wipes at Ray's hair.
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: ("Don't put food in your hair.") She is surprised that
text: she's a little jazzed from her encounter with Jerry Maguire.
text: She can't help but look back at Jerry, who catches her
text: looking. He salutes her, with mock circumstance. She
text: returns it with a guilty smile. He disappears, and she finds
text: herself oddly short of breath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: Hmmph. Whoever snagged him must

speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been

dialog: 
text: Nearby, a large and sleepy German Shepard yawns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Never BETTER!!
dialog: 
text: The dog snaps awake, a little shook. Avery suddenly yanks
text: away. Breathing hard, she just looks at Jerry. Sex is a very
dialog: serious business with Avery.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Open your eyes.
dialog: (he does)
dialog: If you ever want me to be with
dialog: another woman for you, I would do
dialog: it. I'm not interested in it.
dialog: There was a time, yes, it felt
dialog: normal for me, but it was a phase,
text: a college thing, like torn Levi's
dialog: or law school for you... people
dialog: change, but if you ever feel like
dialog: being adventurous in that way, I
dialog: would do it for you. You want
dialog: anything from the kitchen I'm
dialog: going to get some fruit --
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She skips off like a colt. Jerry digests what he's just been
dialog: told.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (to the next room)
dialog: You know. I don't think we need
dialog: to do the thing where we tell each
dialog: other everything!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY (O.S.)
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
dialog: 
text: Jerry rubs his face, as he does often when processing complex

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY (0.5.)
dialog: Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we
dialog: have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY (0.5.)
dialog: I know about the bachelor party.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Who told you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
text: One of the accountants.
dialog: 
text: She makes a pissed-off sound. She then walks over, taking
text: his shoulders and bending them forward. She is an expert at
text: body manipulation, loosening him as she talks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Jerry. Your buddy Dooler worked
dialog: his ass off to make you a tribute
dialog: film. All those guys from the
dialog: office are coming. Everybody
dialog: loves you. Just calm down, relax,
dialog: act surprised, and have an amazing
dialog: time. And you'll never guess who
dialog: narrates your bachelor movie.

scene_heading: INT. FANCY HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT

scene_heading: THE FILM -- SHOWN ON BIG-SCREEN T.V.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL JORDAN
dialog: I have often wondered where my
dialog: career would have been had Jerry
dialog: Maguire been my agent. The
dialog: answer -- Yugoslavia.
dialog: 
text: Tepid laughs, as many of the agents turn and grab furtive
text: looks at Maguire, who stands at the back of the room with his
text: friend BILL DOOLER. Dooler, husky, 30, looks like a beatnik
dialog: on steroids.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOOLER
dialog: You hear those courtesy laughs,

dialog: wrongness at the edges of this
dialog: party.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Oh come on --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOOLER
dialog: This is fuckin Michael Jordan,
dialog: man! They should be screaming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (eying crowd)
dialog: You're imagining it.
dialog: 
text: They are joined by unctuous agent Bob Sugar. Sugar is a
text: Maguire wannabee. Puts an arm on Jerry's shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUGAR
dialog: We still having lunch tomorrow,
dialog: Jerry? Looks like Carl Denton
dialog: tested positive for marijuana.
text: That moves Cush solidly up to
dialog: numero uno in the draft.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOOLER
dialog: Oh, that'll really help this

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUGAR
dialog: (smoothly)
dialog: The best commercial director in

speaker_heading: DOOLER
dialog: Sorry I yelled. You have
dialog: exquisite taste.
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUGAR
dialog: Everybody's having a great time.
dialog: You're both nuts -- the movie's
dialog: great.
dialog: 
text: Sugar moves on, cheerfully.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOOLER
dialog: I like that guy.
dialog: 
text: (The movie, which plays simultaneously with the conversation,
text: is a Hi-8 confessional of Jerry's former girlfriends.
text: MICHAEL JORDAN is cut into this, nodding, as if he were
text: actually interviewing. The effect is funny, but the
dialog: confessions are brutally honest. There is The One He Was Too
dialog: Good For, The One He Wasn't Good Enough For ("He hated being
dialog: alone.") The Still in Love Girlfriend, The Punk Rock
dialog: girlfriend ("Sports makes me ill"), The Now Married With Kids
dialog: Girlfriend, The Cynical Girlfriend ("Beneath the cute
dialog: exterior, more cute exterior.") The Purely Sexual Girlfriend,
dialog: The Brainy Girlfriend, ("Great at friendship, bad at
dialog: intimacy") and even the Girlfriend Who Does A Great Jerry
text: Imitation (rubbing her face, she does a flawless Jerry-on-his-
dialog: way-to-the-airport). All seem to agree on some basic points
dialog: (and if necessary maybe Jordan narrates the following
dialog: information to underscore it.) Jerry always has a
dialog: girlfriend, and many met him on the first day he'd broken up
text: with the last one. The relationship always competes with his
text: job, and the job always wins. The final confrontation
text: happens somewhere around the 18-month mark. Sequence ends
text: with Avery in character, wielding a blowtorch, threatening to
dialog: burn all these old phone numbers.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (wounded good sport)
dialog: ... this is... uh... too funny...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOOLER
dialog: They ain't laughing, man.
dialog: Something's wrong.
dialog: 
text: Jerry nods, takes a swig of beer. He knows the response is
text: little more than polite. None of the other agents can keep
text: eye contact with him. Dooler is right. On the screen, the
text: finale features a good-humored collage of Jerry photos, cut
dialog: to music.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SMI OFFICE -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Elevator doors open. Maguire is now paranoid. He walks
text: through the buzzing SMI headquarters, heading for his corner
text: office. He is like an FBI man searching treetops and corners
text: for the Gunman. Everywhere he looks is a potential Grassy
dialog: Knoll.
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He passes Fellow Agents, always smiling, giving a word of
text: encouragement to an Agent having an emotional hallway
text: conversation with an Athlete, even bends down to check the
text: sheet of slides being approved by a very large but seated
text: Basketball Player. Moving forward. There is trouble in the
text: air, but only he seems to sense it. He turns corner and is
text: met by assistant WENDY, who hands him a long list of calls.
text: The sheet flaps against his leg as she moves with him toward
text: his back office.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (as in 'get ready')

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Tyson, hello.
dialog: 
text: Tyson just stares at Jerry. Jerry has little luck with kids.
text: He gives Marcee a quick peck and heads for the fridge. He
text: grabs a two-pint bottle of orange Gatorade -- another
text: habit -- and sits down at his desk. He slips into crisis
text: mode like an old shirt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: How can I make your life better?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCEE
dialog: I know you say to take the Arizona

dialog: You've called our house, right?

text: Sugar exits. Marcee resumes at the exact point, at the exact
dialog: level of intensity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCEE
dialog: Now I don't know what you do for
dialog: your five-percent, but this man,
dialog: my husband has a whole plan, an
dialog: image... we majored in marketing,
dialog: Jerry, and when you put him in a
dialog: Waterbed Warehouse commercial,
dialog: excuse me, you are making him
dialog: common. He is pure gold and
dialog: you're giving him "Waterbed
dialog: Warehouse" when he deserves the
dialog: big four -- shoe, car, clothing-
dialog: line, soft-drink. The four jewels
dialog: of the celebrity endorsement
dialog: dollar.
dialog: 
text: Jerry finds himself admiring her drive, and she commands the
text: best in him. The desk buzzes, and Jerry ignores it.

dialog: Damn right, and you can start by
text: taking Rod's poster and putting it
dialog: where people can see it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (it's infectious)
dialog: Damn right.
dialog: 
text: He climbs up on the edge of his sofa, and reaches for the
text: poster with his hanging device. True to Marcee's complaint,
text: the poster hangs in the upper Siberian region of his wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCEE
dialog: Look at that handsome man, trying
dialog: to build a life up there by the
dialog: air-conditioner. We're coming to
dialog: get ya, darlin! We are so close
dialog: to having it all!
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON THE POSTER -- CLOSE
dialog: 
dialog: It is the kind of poster that is strictly the domain of
text: second-tier players. Commanding wide-receiver ROD TIDWELL,

speaker_heading: SUGAR

dialog: scene...

speaker_heading: SUGAR
dialog: I know. It sucks. I suck.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: You...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUGAR
dialog: (razor sharp)
dialog: You did this to yourself. You
dialog: said "fewer clients." You put it
dialog: all on paper. Scully was very

dialog: did this to yourself --
dialog: 
text: Jerry's mouth opens to finish his sentence, but before he can
dialog: speak, Sugar continues.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUGAR

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUGAR
dialog: Give me a little credit for doing
dialog: this face-to-face! What I went
dialog: through knowing I was going to do
dialog: this to my mentor! Can you get
dialog: past yourself for a second?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: You'll lose.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUGAR
dialog: (musically)
dialog: You wanted smaller.

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: -- and I'll get 'em.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUGAR
dialog: (patronizing)

dialog: Always always always. We're
dialog: bringing other elements in, we're
dialog: focusing on endorsements -- it's

text: He begins dipping into the tank, grabbing the one exotic fish

text: Jerry absorbs the blow, and takes the keys from the top of

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Okay, anybody else?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON DOROTHY
dialog: 
dialog: She looks around. Doesn't anybody believe in the very thing
dialog: they were applauding three days ago? She has an odd
text: reaction, a muscle twitch of the soul. Before she knows it,

dialog: I'll go with you.

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (to Dorothy)
dialog: Let's see how they do without us.

scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT

text: silence. The elevator stops. A young, amorous Couple
text: enters. Both are about 24, and the Guy presses a number five
text: flights down. In a moment, we realize they are deaf. They
text: sign to each other, murmuring noises of love. And then the
text: Guy signs something, obviously powerful, because the Girl
text: emits a delighted gasp, as does Dorothy. The Couple are
text: truly in their own world. They kiss before exiting on their
text: floor. And suddenly the elevator seems empty without them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Wonder what he said.

dialog: Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
dialog: 
text: He spaces out for a moment. Awkwardly, she touches him
dialog: briefly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: And I guess we didn't talk about

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY

dialog: (off her look)
dialog: But it's going to be great.

speaker_heading: DOROTHY

dialog: great.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY

speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: You are not a loser.
dialog: 
text: Jerry stops, turns. The way she says "loser" is the most
text: elegant of disses. She wraps her lips around it like a cheap
dialog: hot dog.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Who said anything about "loser?"
dialog: Where do you get this word "loser?"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: I'm sorry. I was on a roll. I

text: Music continues.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CUSHMAN DOOR -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Jerry exits car. Adjusts the jacket. Takes the tie off too,
text: returns to the car and tosses it inside. He walks to the
text: front door with purpose. Suddenly an intercom crackles,
text: jolting him with a booming and cheerful voice:
dialog: 
scene_heading: MATT CUSHMAN'S VOICE
dialog: No sports agents allowed! Ha ha.
dialog: 
text: Jerry spots the small electronic camera pointed at him from
text: the upper-corner of this rustic home. The door buzzes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CUSHMAN HALLWAY/DEN -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Jerry follows the voice down a hallway loaded with Cush
text: memorabilia. Righteous indignation building.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MATT CUSHMAN'S VOICE
dialog: I'm in the back den, Jerry.
dialog: 
text: He moves into the den, finding MATT CUSHMAN, 40, who stands
text: at the living room bar. Two framed game jerseys on the wall.
text: A large draped American flag above the bar. He is a J. Crew
dialog: cowboy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You like a Bloody Beer, Jerry?
dialog: Beer and tomato juice --

speaker_heading: JERRY

speaker_heading: JERRY

dialog: piece of cattle to SMI. But to
dialog: me --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: We decided to stay with you.
dialog: 
text: On pure instinct, he hugs Matt Cushman. The move surprises

text: surprising tears of relief. He has been spared.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Oh, thank you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Told myself -- if he shows up,
dialog: we'll stick with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: You know, I'm not a hugger and
dialog: yet... I can't let go.
dialog: 
text: Matt laughs, as Cush lopes in from the kitchen. Little

speaker_heading: CUSH
dialog: Hey, Jerry, what's been going on?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DEN -- LATER DAY -- HANDHELD
dialog: 
text: Cush, Matt and Jerry brainstorm around the ceremonial "wagon-

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I want him to go number one in the
dialog: draft, and I want him to play.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: It's either going to be Denver or
text: San Diego trading up to take him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUSH
dialog: (big grin)
dialog: Hell, I'll either surf or ski. I
dialog: don't care.
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Denver is where he should be.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I'll give it everything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You know I don't do "contracts."

dialog: 
text: Jerry toasts Matt with a bloody beer. A good day.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RENT-A-CAR/TEXAS -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Jerry drives back on the same bumpy road. On the radio, it's
text: the Rolling Stones. He wants to sing along. He thinks he
dialog: knows the words, but...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (sings)
dialog: Feelin...
dialog: 
text: He realizes he doesn't know the words at all. He switches
text: channels. Finds a Rush song, with ornate lyrics. No one will
text: ever know what the words are. He switches again and finds
dialog: "Let's Groove Tonight" by Earth, Wind and Fire. Excellent.
text: He begins singing nonsense noises, passionately. Switches
text: again. All he wants is to sing along with a song he knows.
text: Finally he finds Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' "Refugee."
text: He drives through the countryside, singing the call and
text: response of the song, like a happy idiot.

dialog:

dialog: Sorry, that's my son and the

dialog:

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: No, that's fine. What calls came
dialog: in today?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY

speaker_heading: CHAD

dialog: 
text: Jerry bounces against the imaginary balloon. Ray is

scene_heading: INT. DALLAS AIRPORT -- DAY
dialog:

dialog: ("Where do you think you're gonna end up, Cush?" "You gonna

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUSH
dialog: (a big thought)
dialog: Jerry. Why does God sometimes
dialog: reward the evil and punish the
dialog: good?
dialog: 
text: Jerry shares a look with Avery, who is on the other side of
text: Cush. Her stockings swish as she crosses her legs.

speaker_heading: CUSH
dialog: (thoughtful pause)
dialog: I see what you're saying.

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Wait. What do you mean?

speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Hey man, I wish I had a

speaker_heading: CUSH
dialog: Thank ya.
dialog: 
text: Tidwell waits for a compliment of his own, but Cush doesn't

dialog: Well you ain't that mothafuckin
dialog: good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUSH
dialog: Say what?

speaker_heading: JERRY

speaker_heading: CUSH
dialog: Me too, dude. Especially that big

dialog: just insanity, man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Heard that.
dialog: 
text: Tidwell reaches over, he and Cush exchange a fingertips five.

scene_heading: EXT. MARRIOTT MARQUIS -- NIGHT

dialog: are calling out to the young star ("Go get the big chi-ching,
text: Cush!") Avery smoothly pulls ESPN into the front position.
text: Telegenic Cush shrugs and smiles. ("I'll either surf or

scene_heading: INT. GIFT SHOP -- NIGHT -- LATER

text: Elsewhere in the gift shop, he sees the very real and
text: emotional scene of a young athlete and his mother. Both wear
text: self-promoting colorful homemade t-shirts with the young
text: athlete's face on it. Something about them, their pure
text: enthusiasm, rubs Tidwell in an odd way. He almost cries, for
text: himself, for humanity, as Jerry enters. Tidwell is
text: embarrassed to have been caught in this misty state.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: At last I find you.

dialog: Why the fuck am I here? I feel

dialog: ego.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Come on. Come with me. We're
dialog: going to take a walk through this

text: everywhere, in every hand.
dialog: 
text: There is a heavy white media light bathing everything -- as
dialog: if life had become a t.v. show, and everything within it
text: concerned making other t.v. shows. Jerry works hard,

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: I came all the way here for that?
dialog: To walk the lobby?

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yeah. And it might have even

speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Let's do it again.

speaker_heading: JERRY

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUSH
dialog: (immediately)
dialog: God, you're like a dude.
dialog: 
text: It's a great line, and the room breaks up. This is charisma,
text: the future of the NFL. Waiter exits, as Cush continues
text: strumming. And now Jerry speaks, importantly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Cush, Matt -- we have a decision
dialog: to make.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUSH
dialog: "It's okay to eat fish, 'cause
dialog: they Don't have any feelings...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Okay. San Diego just came in with
text: a last-minute scenario. It's big.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUSH
dialog: "Something in the way. Yeah."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Well, he's gotta go number one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUSH
dialog: "Ooooooo."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: He still goes number one, but San
dialog: Diego wants to trade up with New
dialog: England -- they want him bad.
dialog: 
text: Cush turns to his curiously ambivalent father, who walks to
text: the window and looks out at the big Jumbotron with Keith.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What happened to Denver?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Denver got very silent about a day
dialog: ago. San Diego's got a fever for
dialog: Cush. This stuff tends to happen
text: the night before a draft. People
dialog: get crazy. And San Diego, you
dialog: should know, is crazy to the tune
dialog: of seven years for thirty. Signing
dialog: bonus of eight.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Million.
dialog: 
text: Anne-Louise whistles loudly. She is instantly embarrassed,
text: and puts a hand up. Sorry. In the next room, the phone is
dialog: ringing.
dialog: 60.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I don't know, Jerry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Should I unplug the phone?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUSH
dialog: Reporters, Jerry. They been
dialog: callin' all night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Just be friendly and say "no
dialog: comment."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUSH
dialog: Talking and saying nothing, man,
dialog: it's an art I have not mastered.
dialog: 
text: Jerry holds up a finger -- watch me. Jerry picks up the
text: ringing phone. He offers a near-perfect imitation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: "This is Cush."
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, everyone is, laughing. The room lightens.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BOB SUGAR'S HOTEL ROOM -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Bob Sugar talks on his hotel phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUGAR
dialog: It's Sugar. He must be there,
dialog: right? Just sniff or something if
text: he's there.
text: (Jerry sniffs,
dialog: panicked)
dialog: Alright, buddydude. Just
dialog: remember. You're swimming with the
dialog: big boys now. You let your dad do
dialog: all the talking. I'm the one who
dialog: got you the deal you needed. This
dialog: is business not friendship. Be
dialog: strong. You're global now.
dialog: 
text: Sugar hangs up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: "No comment.
dialog: 
text: Jerry hangs up. The room is still laughing. His head is
dialog: spinning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Hey, it's Cush on the big t.v.
dialog: again!
dialog: 61.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUSH
dialog: Hell, I'm already sick of me. I
dialog: got "Cushlash."
dialog: 
text: More laughs. Jerry sits across from Matt, reeling quietly. He
text: speaks casually, directly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Look, before I go back to Denver.
dialog: I think we should put something
text: down on paper. Something that
dialog: says, "hey, I'm with Jerry
dialog: Maguire."
dialog: 
text: He pulls out a yellow legal tablet. He scribbles a few
text: lines, as Matt looks increasingly nervous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Not right now, Jerry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Do I know everything there is to
dialog: know here?
dialog: (silent beat)
dialog: You fellas aren't talking with Bob
dialog: Sugar, are you?
dialog: 
dialog: More silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Apparently, Denver wanted to deal
dialog: with him instead of you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Said who? Sugar?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Hey, I'm learning as I go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal
dialog: with Denver behind my back?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I'm sorry, I --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I brought Denver to twenty
dialog: million. Denver deals with me all
dialog: the time. You listened to Sugar?
dialog: You let that snake in the door.
dialog: 
text: Jerry touches the coffee table. Calms himself.
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It's okay. You want Denver. I'll
dialog: fix this up. You didn't sign
dialog: anything with Sugar, right?
dialog: 
text: Another rough silence is broken by little brother Keith.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: (blurts)
dialog: Mr. Maguire, someday I'm gonna be
dialog: a famous athlete and I'm gonna
dialog: sign with you'.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Shut up!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm sorry... sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: (sympathy for Jerry)
dialog: S' cool.
dialog: 
text: Shot moves in on Jerry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Now. Wait. You didn't actually
dialog: sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me
dialog: you didn't sign.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Because I'm still sort of moved by
dialog: your "my word is stronger'n oak"
dialog: thing --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We signed an hour ago. You were
text: in the lobby with the black fella.
dialog: 
text: Jerry moans. Silently, he rises and begins to gather his
text: things. Cush hangs on to his guitar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUSH
dialog: I'm sorry, Jerry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: They say it's show "business,"
dialog: Jerry, not show friends.
dialog: 
text: Jerry takes a breath before he exits. He surveys the room,
text: settling on Cush. Visible behind Maguire is Times Square, in
text: all it's neon logo glory.
dialog: 63.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Well. Okay. Of course. You're
dialog: twenty years old, and I'm just
text: another guy in a suit. It's all
dialog: business. It didn't work out. You
dialog: didn't buy my product, which is,
dialog: unfortunately, mm. Let me see,
dialog: there's a speech that I'm supposed
dialog: to make -- right! -- "I'll be out
dialog: there cheering for you." "The door
dialog: is always open!" See? I'm a class
dialog: act.
dialog: (breath, directly)
dialog: But maybe this would have all
dialog: worked, us being real human
dialog: beings, coming through for each
dialog: other, really, and now I'll never
dialog: know. You'll never know. Weren't
dialog: you curious?
dialog: (they aren't)
dialog: No. Okay, well, I'll be fine.
dialog: And you'll be fine. And Keith I
dialog: bope you do call me.
dialog: 
text: Flushed and embarrassed, he exits. We hang a beat on the
text: silent Cushman hotel livingroom, as Cush now continues on
dialog: guitar.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jerry exits elevator dazed, at full trot. The Marriott lobby
text: is packed. He is looking for Avery. Beat reporter Patricia
text: Logan reappears. She relishes asking brutal questions,
text: innocently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATRICIA LOGAN
dialog: Jerry, is it true that Tidwell's
dialog: had three concussions?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I'm sorry... excuse me...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BALLROOM -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jerry enters the grand ballroom, looking for Avery.
text: Endorsement placards in evidence everywhere. NFL reps and
text: media workers move tables and work out camera and seating
text: arrangements. Elevated in a open ESPN booth six feet off the
text: ground, host Chris Berman records voice-overs for tomorrow's
text: draft. Fans heckle him by singing the ESPN theme. He rolls
text: with it, expertly. Jerry spots Avery across the empty
text: ballroom, moving fast, passing out media packets on the empty
dialog: tables.
dialog: 64.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ADJACENT BUFFET ROOM -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jerry finally catches up with Avery in the empty side-room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: I just heard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: What do I do? How do I spin this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Oh honey. It's spun.
dialog: 
text: She keeps moving, adding an extra snap to the packets.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: What did I do to you?
dialog: 
text: She is furious with his question. Doesn't he know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: It's all about you, isn't it?
dialog: Soothe me, save me, love me --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Could you just stop moving?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: I have to finish my job --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Everything's on the fucking run!
dialog: Everything --
dialog: 
text: She stops. Walks to him, framed by a bank of t.v. monitors.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Jerry. You and I are salespeople.
dialog: We sell --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Look, I don't want a --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: It's not "love me." It's not
dialog: "trust my handshake." It's make
dialog: the sale. Get it signed. There
dialog: shouldn't be "confusion" about
dialog: that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Go ahead. Jump right on into my
text: nightmare. The water's warm.
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: So honesty is outlawed here, I
dialog: can't be honest?
dialog: 
text: She turns and exits again. He follows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Tell you what -- I'd prefer
dialog: loyalty..
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: What was our deal when we first
dialog: got together? Brutal truth,
dialog: remember?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I think you added the "brutal."
dialog: 
text: She stops, slaps down another media packet. Blows a
text: troublesome piece of hair out of her face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Jerry, there is a "sensitivity"
dialog: thing that some people have. I
dialog: don't have it. I don't cry at
dialog: movies. I don't gush over babies.
dialog: I don't start celebrating
dialog: Christmas five months early, and
dialog: I don't tell a man who just
dialog: screwed up both of our lives --
dialog: 'oh, poor baby.' That's me. For
dialog: better or worse. But I do love
dialog: you.
dialog: 
text: Jerry looks at his fiancee. Standing here, watching Avery
text: coldly clasping her media packs to her chest, she looks
dialog: different to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Avery --
dialog: 
text: She knows what's coming. She moves fast to avoid him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Don't say it. We're both ragged
dialog: out right now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: -- stop --
dialog: 
text: She exits back into the main ballroom. For a moment, she
text: stops. They face off. This is it. They are quickly
text: interrupted by overweight, talk-show voiced CURTIS WEINTRAUB,
dialog: 45.
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS WEINTRAUB
dialog: Hey! Curtis Weintraub from the
dialog: Sports Popper! Haven't seen you
dialog: two since the Cuervo Gold Rock 'n
dialog: Sock Charity Six Flags Budfest!
dialog: Hello!
dialog: 
text: Neither look at him, they remain fixed on each other. Curtis

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS WEINTRAUB
dialog: (continuing; exiting
dialog: quickly)
dialog: Goodbye!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: I'm warning you. Don't say it.
dialog: You won't have another chance.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Listen to me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: It's over --
dialog: 
text: She continues moving into the next room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Didn't hear it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: There is something missing here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: You've never been alone and you
dialog: can't be alone --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Listen to me, it's over.
dialog: 
text: She can barely believe it. She blinks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: No one has ever dumped me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I'm not trying to make history.
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: I did the 23 hour nose-route to
dialog: the top of El Capitan in 6 hours!
dialog: I can make this work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (it slips out)
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: She takes a breath. It sinks in. From somewhere, the small
text: voice of her vulnerability.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Oh Jerry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (steps closer)
dialog: You know I didn't ever want to
dialog: hurt you.
dialog: 
text: She gets an odd look, shaking her head. Starts to step away,
text: then thinks better of it. She WALLOPS him in the face with
text: the back of her hand. Jerry stands like a woozy boxer. She
text: hits him again with a fist, then again in the chest. He
text: sinks to the floor, sagging. backwards. She straddles him,
text: addresses him fully, right in his bruised face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: I won't let you hurt me, Jerry.
dialog: I'm too strong for you. Loser.

speaker_heading: JERRY

speaker_heading: TIDWELL

dialog: You feel bad you tested positive?

dialog: leave the mother?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: What are you doing with me, Rod?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Don't you even see -- I'm
dialog: finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four
dialog: hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm
dialog: a cautionary tale!
dialog: 
text: Tidwell looks at Jerry, impassive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: See this jacket I'm wearing? You
dialog: like it? I don't really need it,
text: because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE.
dialog: I lost the number one draft pick
dialog: the night before the draft. They
dialog: will teach my story to other
dialog: agents on "do not do this" day in
dialog: agent school. Why? Let's recap.
dialog: Because a hockey player's kid made
dialog: me feel like a superficial jerk,
dialog: I had two slices of bad pizza,
dialog: went to bed, grew a conscience and
dialog: wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: The least you could do is nod and
dialog: act sympathetic --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: (shaking head)
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: It's a quality that might come in
dialog: handy for a commercial sometime.

speaker_heading: TIDWELL

scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE -- LATER DAY

speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Man, I got a shelf life of ten
dialog: years, tops! My next contract's
dialog: gotta bring me the dollars that'11
dialog: last me and mine a very long time.
dialog: I'm out of this sport in five
dialog: years. What's my family gonna
dialog: live on? What you get me. So I

dialog: your "nya nya nya."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (ruefully, to
dialog: attendant)
dialog: Another drink please.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Anybody else would have left you
dialog: by now, but I'm sticking with you.
dialog: I said I would. And if I got to

scene_heading: EXT. PORCH -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: DOROTHY
text: He's coming over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL

speaker_heading: DOROTHY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL

dialog: God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll-
dialog: Call-My-Newly Long-suffering-

speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Honey, he's engaged. And for the
dialog: first time in my professional
dialog: life, I'm a part of something I

speaker_heading: LAUREL

scene_heading: INT. RAY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

text: She kisses the corner of his forehead, rising up into the

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAB -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jerry in back of a cab, wearing sunglasses, three drinks
text: later, post-flight, rolling with anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Okay, turn here! Sharp right
dialog: turn. 8831 3/4 Waterloo.
dialog: 
text: The cab turns onto a very small street. Cars parked on both
text: sides. Down the street, another pair of headlights.
dialog: 71.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jerry's cab refuses to give in, in fact he floors it. Same

speaker_heading: JERRY

speaker_heading: JERRY

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Thanks for inviting me over.
dialog: Where's the little guy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: He's asleep. Watch out for that
dialog: lamp.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I'm glad you're home. That
dialog: "alone" thing is... not my
dialog: specialty...
dialog: 
text: He ducks the lamp, barely. Laurel exits through his shot,
text: miming "drinking" behind his back. Jerry takes off his
text: glasses, revealing a welt and a cut below his eye.
dialog: 72.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Oh my God.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yeah. That too. I broke up with

dialog: 
text: Dorothy's entire body chemistry changes in ways she doesn't
dialog: quite understand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Too bad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Better now than later. We'll
dialog: still be friends. I'm dying here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: And just think if I got her the
dialog: ring she really wanted.
dialog: 
text: Dorothy laughs. He looks at her strangely. Suddenly she
text: feels very nervous, as he sets down his bags.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Sorry. Uh, let me see, have a
dialog: seat. I'll get you some aloe vera
dialog: for that cut too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Do you have something to drink?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Sure --
dialog: 
text: She moves to the kitchen door. She is about to exit, when
text: Jerry begins to unburden.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: My brother works for the White
text: House. He pretends he's an
dialog: intellectual. He pretends he's
dialog: from the east coast.
dialog: 
text: She turns, not quite sure what his point is. She waits
text: politely for Jerry to finish before exiting into the kitchen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I was supposed to be the
dialog: successful one.
dialog: (more)
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY (cont'd)
dialog: But I don't want to talk about it.
dialog: And yet! My family. I grew up
dialog: with repression as a... a
dialog: religion --you don't bitch. No
dialog: moaning! Head down. Do it,
dialog: whatever "it" may be. My dad... he
dialog: worked for the United Way for 38
dialog: years! You know what he said when
dialog: he retired? He said, "I wish I'd
dialog: had a more comfortable chair." 38
dialog: years he sat in it! Do you know
dialog: what I'm saying, Dorothy?
dialog: Repression as a religion. I'm
text: almost as old as his chair.
dialog: 
text: He rubs his face. She looks at him, and the situation
text: slightly overwhems her. Here he is, wide-open, ripe for the
dialog: taking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Beer okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yeah, thanks.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
dialog: 
text: Laurel smokes a cigarette and blows it out the window.
text: Dorothy goes for the refrigerator, finds a couple beers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I heard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: No kidding. I looked over and saw
text: the shadow of two curious shoes in
text: the doorway of the kitchen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: This guy would go home with a
dialog: gardening tool right now if it
dialog: showed interest.
dialog: (off Dorothy's look)
dialog: Wait. Use the frosted glasses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Look, here's some of that chicken
dialog: with salsa too, I warmed it up --
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: That's the girl I love.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: But you just gotta hear me out on
dialog: one thing. You're very
dialog: responsible with Ray and you know
dialog: it's not right for a little boy to
text: hear some strange man's voice in
dialog: the house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: As opposed to twenty angry women?
dialog: 
text: Dorothy turns quickly and the beer, sisters and chicken
text: collide in the small kitchen. Dorothy deftly catches the
text: food in her t-shirt, and dumps it back onto the plate. But
text: her shirt is now stained. She starts to quietly implode, and
text: Laurel takes command. They know each other well.

dialog: Come on, let's get you another
dialog: top --
dialog: 
text: They exit to nearby laundry room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE/WINDOW OUTSIDE LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Now camera starts to move around the house, from this window
text: showing the two sisters in the laundry room, to the living
text: room where Jerry sits alone. We see Ray wander into the room
text: and stare at Jerry.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jerry, who is playing with a kaleidoscope on the table, looks
dialog: up to see Ray.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Hi Ray.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LAUNDRY ROOM -- SAME TIME
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: All I'm saying. You don't have
dialog: the luxury of falling for some
dialog: drowning man. Be practical. Now.
dialog: Which top?
dialog: 
text: She holds up two tops. One is sexier with a dipped down
text: front. The other is striped, cute, functional.
dialog: 75.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Okay, you want to talk about
dialog: practical? Let's talk about my
dialog: wonderful life. Do you know what
dialog: most other women my age are doing
dialog: right now? They are partying in
dialog: clubs, trying to act stupid,
text: trying to get a man, trying to
dialog: keep a man... not me. I'm trying
text: to RAISE a man.
dialog: 
text: She grabs the sexier top, and puts it on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I've got a 24 hour a day reminder
dialog: of Roger, for the rest of my life.
dialog: I have had three lovers in four
dialog: years, all boring, all achingly
dialog: self-sufficient all friends of
dialog: yours I might add, and all of them
text: running a distant second to a warm
dialog: bath. Look at me, Laurel, look at
dialog: me. I'm the oldest 26 year old in
dialog: the world! How do I look?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jerry and Ray have a great conversation, playing tug with a
text: piece of rope.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: And then my dad died and my mom
dialog: took me to the zoo and I love the
dialog: zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you
dialog: love the zoo?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Wait. I want to tell you more
dialog: about my dad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Let's go the zoo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Okay. I've been hogging it.
dialog: You're right.
dialog: (more)
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY (cont'd)
dialog: All my life I've been trying to
dialog: talk, really talk, and no one
dialog: wants to listen. You know that
dialog: feeling?
dialog: 
text: Ray nods vigorously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Let's go right now. Let's go to
dialog: the zoo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Aw, the fucking thing... I mean,
text: the zoo is closed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You said "fuck".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yeah I know. I did.
dialog: 
text: Ray loves this guy. He pats Jerry's knee.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I won't tell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: We'll go to the zoo sometime.
dialog: Okay? I think I might have some
dialog: time on my hands.
dialog: 
text: Ray looks at Jerry's hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I don't see any.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (points respectfully)
dialog: Funny.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Funny...
dialog: (imitates him)
dialog: (hears mom
dialog: approaching)
dialog: I better go to bed.
dialog: 
text: Ray hugs Jerry and exits. Jerry sits contemplating the kid
text: for a moment. The door swings open and a harried Dorothy
text: appears in the sexier top, but with a distinctly less sexy
text: attitude, and a tray.
dialog: 77.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Drinks. Food. Plus, I called you
text: a cab.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (slightly confused)
dialog: Good idea. Thank you.
dialog: 
dialog: And we should keep our voices down a little. I have a little
text: boy asleep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Right. Of course.
dialog: 
text: Jerry tries to twist open the beer, ripping at his palm. It's
text: not a twist-off. She hands him an opener. He opens it,
text: inelegantly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: So. Our company.
dialog: 
text: She watches the drunken man, who drinks. Then coughs a
text: little. Then stands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Okay. Lil' speech before I go.
dialog: 
text: He gets up, woozy, but loose. Powerfully:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Do. Not. Worry. About. Your.
dialog: Job.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Our company is in good shape. You
dialog: and your son... we... are just
dialog: fine. You still have a job. I
dialog: want you to feel confident! In.
dialog: Me. And I have a problem with
dialog: people who talk about themselves
dialog: in the third person, but let me
dialog: tell you something about Jerry
dialog: Maguire.
dialog: 
text: His confidence nicely fueled, Jerry reaches for a fireplace
text: poker. He begins to joust with an imaginary opponent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Come after me and you will lose I
dialog: am a survivor! Do not
dialog: underestimate Jerry Maguire! I've
dialog: got wits!
dialog: (more)
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY (cont'd)
dialog: I've got the instincts of a
dialog: panther!
dialog: (joust)
dialog: I've got Dorothy Boyd on my side!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Don't worry about me. I can get
dialog: jobs --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: We will be fine!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: -- especially one like this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: And I am...
dialog: 
text: He becomes very aware of himself. Acting out in a virtual
text: stranger's small-but-comfortable living room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I am drunk.
dialog: 
text: He collapses onto the sofa, embarrassed. Shaking his head.
text: Dorothy scoots closer in an adjacent chair. She breaks the
text: personal barrier, carefully touching his wound with the wet
text: tip of the aloe vera plant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Truth?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
text: Dorothy turns to see that Laurel's two shoes are still very
text: visible at the kitchen door. Decides to ignore them. She
text: gets closer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Sure, I care about the job. Of
dialog: course. But mostly...
dialog: (very honest)
dialog: ... I want to be inspired.
dialog: 
text: There is something inspiring about the way she says the word
dialog: "inspiring."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Me too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: What you wrote inspired me.
dialog: 79.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He is catching a scent of that most ancient elixer. A
text: woman's affection. Their heads inch closer together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm working with you because of
dialog: that memo...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Mission... statement...
dialog: 
text: They kiss. It turns rather passionate. She places a cool
text: hand on his cheek. He places a hand on her breast. The
text: taxi beeps outside. She pulls away. Both regard the hand on
dialog: her breast.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Well.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Sorry about this hand.
dialog: (he rises unsteadily)
dialog: You know that feeling -- you're
text: not completely embarrassed yet,
dialog: but you glimpe tomorrow's
dialog: embarrassment?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Don't worry about it, boss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Oh shit. You said "boss."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Yeah, I did.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: No. No don't feel like Clarence
dialog: Thomas.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: No, I do. I feel like Clarence
dialog: Thomas.
dialog: (the worst day ever)
dialog: I'm like... harrassing you...
dialog: right now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: I may not sue.
dialog: 
text: He laughs a little. Music. Unsure what more to say, Jerry
text: rubs his face. And then:
dialog: 80.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Well, good evening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Good evening.
dialog: 
text: He stands, returns the fireplace poker to her, and exits.
text: Stumbling slightly on the first step leading down from the
text: front porch, he recovers with style.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: We'll be okay. And I'm going to
dialog: take my... one client and we're
dialog: gonna go all the way.
dialog: 
text: He takes a few more steps, re-balancing bags, coughs a
text: little. He is a mess, and he knows it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (continuing; loving
dialog: the dark humor)
dialog: Hey. I'm back.
dialog: 
text: She laughs, waves, and exits back into the kitchen. She
text: regards the poker still in her hand. Laurel watches her
text: conflicted, slightly lovesick sister.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAB -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jerry in the back of the cab. He turns for a moment, looking
text: back at the warm house he's just left. Something is
text: scratching at his soul, trying to get in. Music continues. He
text: was strangely comfortable there, as the house disappears from
dialog: his view.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE TO
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TEMPE PRACTICE AREA -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Rod Tidwell races to catch up to a wobbly, overthrown pass.
text: He snags it out of the air, and moves gracefully downfield.
text: He turns back to shout at the quarterback for the wobbly
text: pass, and slams into a padding post. Dennis Wilburn, the GM
text: we met earlier, crosses in front of Maguire, giving him a
text: look. Maguire forges ahead anyway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: We gotta talk about his contract,
dialog: Dennis.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILBURN
dialog: Your timing is impeccable,
dialog: Maguire. Gee, I can't imagine how
dialog: you ever lost Cush...
dialog: 81.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Wilburn moves on, scoffing loudly.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM SHOWER AREA -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Jerry stands in pre-season locker-room. Off-stage we hear
text: a shower. In the b.g., one of those locker-room psych-up
dialog: signs like: Injuries happen first in the mind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I started talking with Dennis
dialog: Wilburn about your renegotation.
dialog: 
text: Rod emerges naked, dripping wet, pissed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Did you tell him about the "ten
dialog: million for four years?"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Uh, not today, but --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: John Taylor. J.J. Stokes. Andre
dialog: Rison. I SMOKE all these fools,
dialog: and yet they're making the big
dialog: sweet dollars. They're making the
dialog: money, and I got an agent that
dialog: ain't even put the number on the
dialog: table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I understand your anxiety.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Maybe you don't. Because it's not
dialog: just the money I deserve. It's
dialog: not just the "coin." It's the...
dialog: 
text: He says this next word royally, as if it's fine silk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: -- the kwan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: That's your word?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Yeah, man, it means love, respect,
dialog: community... and the dollars too.
dialog: The package. The kwan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: But how did you get "kwan?"
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: I got there from "coin," dude.
dialog: Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Great word. Towel?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: No, I air-dry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Rod, I say this with great
dialog: respect, but those players you
dialog: mentioned are marquee players
dialog: and --
dialog: 
text: A portable phone beeps.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Is that your porty or mine?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: You.
dialog: 
text: Tidwell rummages in his bag. Finds one of two porties and
text: answers the one with a Polaroid of Marcee taped to it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Hi baby. Yeah, I'm just breakin'
dialog: in the new agent. He says I'm not
dialog: marquee. I know... I know...
dialog: 
text: Tidwell holds up the phone so Jerry can hear the sound of
text: Marcee going off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: My wife is upset with you.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM MIRROR -- DAY
dialog: 
text: The conversation continues as Tidwell fixes hair in the
text: mirror. Jerry speaks to the reflection, taking him on,
text: gesturing passionately. Tidwell, still naked, may or may not
dialog: be listening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Here's what I'm saying. This is
dialog: a renegotiation. We want more
dialog: from them, so let's show them more
dialog: from us. Let's show them your pure
dialog: joy of the game, let's bury the
dialog: Attitude a little, let's show
dialog: them --
dialog: 83.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: You're telling me to dance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: No, I'm saying to be --
dialog: 
text: He mimes a dainty little showboat-touchdown dance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: (little voice)
dialog: "Love me love me love me... put me
dialog: on t.v."
dialog: (pissed)
dialog: That's the iconography of rascism,
dialog: man!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Rod, I'm not a rascist. I'm
dialog: telling you to be the best version
dialog: of you, to get back to the guy who
dialog: first started playing this game.
dialog: Way back when you were a kid. It
dialog: wasn't just about the money, was
dialog: it?
dialog: 
text: Tidwell gives him a look. Money was always a factor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Do your job, man, don't tell me to
dialog: dance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Fine.
dialog: 
text: He begins gathering his things.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: I'm an athlete, not an
dialog: entertainer. These are the ABC's
dialog: of ME. Get it? I don't dance.
dialog: 
text: Jerry rubs face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What's wrong.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Forget it. Forget it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: No tell me.
dialog: 84.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I'm out here for you! You don't
dialog: know what it's like to be me out
dialog: here for you. It is an up-at-dawn
dialog: pride-swallowing seige that I will
dialog: never fully tell you about! Okay?!
dialog: Help me help you help me help you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: You're hanging by a very thin
dialog: thread, dude. And I dig that
dialog: about you.
dialog: 
text: Jerry has had enough for one day.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (loopy, punch-drunk,
dialog: arms flailing)
dialog: Hey. I'm happy to entertain you!
dialog: I'll see you in L.A.!
dialog: 
text: Tidwell watches his agent lurch off, muttering and swaying.

speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: See, man, that's the difference.

scene_heading: INT. LAX AIRPORT -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Jerry moves slowly through crowded airport, preoccupied with
dialog: thought.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S HOME OFFICE -- LATER DAY
dialog: 
text: Jerry enters, carrying bags, weary. Dorothy greets him. They
text: are stuck in his small condo, and the scent of their previous
text: encounter is still in the air. She hands him a list of his
dialog: calls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona
dialog: to say he's faxing in the new
dialog: Tidwell offer on Thursday morning,
dialog: and you'll be happy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (jolted into
dialog: happiness)
dialog: Happy. He said "happy?"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Actually he said "glad."
dialog: 85.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Good. Good. Glad is good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Plus, you could use that
dialog: commission.
dialog: 
text: She hands him a financial report she's done. He takes a
text: quick look, seeing the thorough work she's already done.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I sunk most of what I had into
dialog: this condo, which devalued, and --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: You don't have to explain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Look, the other night, I want to
dialog: apologize.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (can't read her)
dialog: Yeah, what happened there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: We're two people working together
dialog: and we can't have an atmosphere.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: I'm relieved you said that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I mean, the other night was... I
dialog: felt like you understood something
dialog: I could barely even say, something
dialog: way down deep in the murk --
dialog: (beat)
dialog: -- but we have a company here to
dialog: think about. I won't ever take
dialog: advantage of you in that way again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (evenly)
dialog: Oh good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: You walked out on a job for me,
dialog: and I won't ruin that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Exactly because I know this is a
dialog: time when you need to be alone
dialog: with your thoughts.
dialog: (more)
dialog: 86.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY (cont'd)
dialog: Think about everything that's gone
dialog: wrong, how to fix them, and just
dialog: be... alone, alone, alone.
dialog: 
text: Dorothy in the background of the shot, watching his reaction.

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: You want to go out to dinner?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Dorothy looks for a jacket as Laurel helms the Divorced
text: Women's group in the living room. Jan speaks through her
text: whistly braces, gesturing with a too-full glass of red wine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: I broke up with the Cowboy. And
dialog: now he's stalking me...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: What's the current definition of
dialog: stalking?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN # 1
text: Coming over uninvited.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: (thoughtful)
dialog: So Romeo under the trellis... was
text: a stalker.
dialog: 
text: Meaningful sounds of revelation, as Dorothy finds the jacket.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Dorothy stops in the hallway to see that Jerry Maguire has
text: arrived at the back-kitchen door. She watches unseen as
text: Maguire shakes hands with Chad the Nanny and is hit suddenly
text: by a flying hug from Ray. He gives the kid an athletic bag,
text: which is filled with state-of-the-art promotional athletic
text: wear, etc. ("Brought you some swag.") Ray continues hugging
dialog: Jerry.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jerry is a little embarrassed by the affections of the kid.
text: Dorothy enters. Expertly breezy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Hey, looks like you've got a fan.
dialog: 87.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (outdressed)
dialog: Wow. That's more than a dress.
dialog: That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Yeah -- guess I got revved up at
dialog: the idea of an evening among
dialog: adults -- no offense buster.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You meet Chad the nanny?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay?
dialog: I guess I didn't realize we were...
dialog: 
text: He doesn't finish the words "going out on a date." The
text: cacaphony of the Boyd home swirls around Maguire. It's a new
dialog: sensation for this bachelor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Don't let him stay up too late.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: (grandly)
dialog: Hey, man, tonight I'm going to
dialog: teach Ray about jazz.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Good, that'll put him to sleep
dialog: early. No offense.
dialog: 
text: She twirls toward the door, grabbing her purse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: You know, you people have a jazz
dialog: problem in this house.
dialog: 
text: Laurel enters, adding to the chaos, adlibbing hellos.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I wanna go too.
dialog: 
text: Laurel gives Ray a look. Ray backs down, as Jerry hears
text: snatches of the Women's group going full blast in the living
dialog: room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Bye you guys.
dialog: 88.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray extends his arms, he wants a hug. Jerry bends down
text: awkwardly to give him one, and Ray plants a kiss on Jerry's
text: cheek. All are surprised, especially Jerry. Dorothy is
text: struck and moved. Shot falls on Ray who watches Jerry exit
text: with wonder. Even at his age, he knows a prize when he sees
dialog: one.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN-- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Laurel looks out the window, watches her sister exiting. She
text: is equal parts jealous and protective. She spots keys on
text: counter. She grabs them and runs out to catch her sister on
text: the lawn. "All Shook Down." Replacements.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DOROTHY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jerry and Dorothy exit through the many cars which we now see
text: are parked on the street and the front lawn. The sound of

dialog: them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Hey!
dialog: 
text: As Jerry moves ahead to the car, Dorothy retreats so she can
dialog: have privacy with her sister.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Forgot your keys --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (privately)
dialog: That's the first time I ever saw
dialog: him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't
dialog: that just... thrilling?
dialog: (eyes tear up)
dialog: I mean, he must have been needing
dialog: that.
dialog: 
text: Women's group laughter in the distance as Laurel attempts to
text: glue her emotional sister back together. She holds her arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: No no. Don't cry at the beginning
dialog: of the date.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY

dialog: 89.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: (can't help it)
dialog: And don't be a shoulder for him to
dialog: cry on either.
dialog: 
text: We stay with Laurel as she watches her sister exit. Music
text: continues. Lit by streetlight, Dorothy runs like a young
text: girl, across the lawns of this car-filled neighborhood,
text: slapping away the leaves of a tree, running to Jerry down the
dialog: street.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ANTONIO'S RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jerry and Dorothy sit at the table of this Mexican

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: It was laziness1 my whole breakup
dialog: with Avery. You know that thing
dialog: you say, "it's nobody's fault."

dialog: Someone is always to blame -- if
dialog: you go for it, go for it like you
dialog: do a job, work at it --
dialog:

speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: We work together.
dialog:

dialog: reluctantly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: See, you choose. If you fall for
dialog: someone, if you make a commitment,
dialog: you should make it work. It's
dialog: only when "options" entered the
dialog: picture that things got bad. I'm
dialog: speaking historically now. It's

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: No no no. I just underestimated

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Yeah. It wasn't like my marriage

dialog: before --
dialog: (stops herself)
dialog: Jerry?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (simply)
dialog: Let's not tell our sad stories.
dialog: 
text: Jerry laughs to himself. He admires her directness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'll be right back. Quit thinking
dialog: those murky thoughts, okay? We're
dialog: young, we're semi-successful. Life

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: No, now... come on... let Chad

dialog: won't hurt it. Aw, buddy, you got
dialog: such a good heart. I love you,

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BATHROOM
dialog: 
text: Sbe exits the bathroom and stops at the sight of what is
text: happening at the table. Jerry, hand on face, is
text: embarrassingly being serenaded by the Mariachis, who now play
text: a mournful "Tears in Heaven." She smiles at the image, in
text: fact the poetry charms her. Dorothy moves forward, grinning,
text: fishes some bucks out of her pocket, and sends the Mariachis
text: in another direction.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Come on, let's take a walk.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DOROTHY'S PORCH -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Music feathers into sounds of night. A bug buzzing from the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Well -- this would be goodnight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Good night.
dialog: 
text: They don't kiss. They take great care not to touch too much.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I'll see you tomorrow.
dialog: 
text: They don't move. On impulse, she grabs him and pulls him
text: close. Kisses him. It's a good one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Good night.
dialog: 
text: But they don't move. He pulls her closer by her straps.
text: They break. She holds them up, nervous now. His lips travel
text: down. He kisses her upper chest. She sighs deeply, she's
text: missed this feeling. Jerry rises to kiss her lips again,
text: tying her straps back on. Her expression says there is a
text: decision to make. She concentrates on the styrofoam container
text: she's brought back from the restaurant.
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (continuing; breath)
dialog: I think you should not come in, or
dialog: come in depending on how you feel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Same to you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: No. I have to go in. I live here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Right. I'll come in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Okay. Wait here a second.
dialog: (beat, then)
dialog: Do we really want to do this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (half-unsure)
dialog: Oh hell yes.
dialog: 
text: She exits, as shot lingers on Jerry. That odd moment when
text: you've crossed the line. He takes a breath.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Dorothy enters to find Chad watching t.v. The house is now
text: quiet, the remains of the Divorced Women's group is still in
dialog: evidence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: He's asleep, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY

scene_heading: EXT. PORCH -- NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: Treat her right, man. She's...
dialog: 93.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (self-conscious)
dialog: Yeah... well...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: She's great. And I know this is
dialog: a little awkward, but I want you
dialog: to use this.
dialog: 
text: Chad ruumages in bag for a moment. Jerry is somewhat
text: horrified at what Chad might be giving him. Out comes a
text: cassette tape.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: (continuing; intense)
dialog: This... is Miles Davis and John
dialog: Coltrane. Stockholm. 1963... two
dialog: masters of freedom, playing in a
dialog: time before their art was
text: corrupted by a zillion cocktail
dialog: lounge performers who destroyed
dialog: the legacy of the only American
dialog: artform -- JAZZ.
dialog: 
text: Jerry takes the tape, as the front door squeaks open.
text: Dorothy shoos Chad away, quietly leads Jerry inside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM-- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Fierce, driving jazz. Dorothy and Jerry making out on bed.
text: Getting hotter. The music gets wilder. Finally it is
text: impossible to ignore, and Jerry collapses backwards on the
text: bed laughing. She is left frozen, her arms open but he is
dialog: gone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: What is this MUSIC?
dialog: 
text: They both crack up, and she kisses him as the music plays. He
text: looks at her. She turns away, then back again, he's still
text: looking at her. It's a powerful moment for her. Laughter
dialog: continues, the music is ridiculous. (Their sex is a big
dialog: difference from the let's-be-intense sex with Avery.)
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT -- SAME TIME
dialog: 
text: Laurel just home from work in nurse uniform, has a late-night

scene_heading: INT. DOROTHY'S BEDROOM -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: Radio clicks on. It's still dark. Only the glow of the

dialog: toys.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: Dorothy and Laurel in the kitchen, waiting far the first
text: possible drops of coffee.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY

dialog: 
text: She starts to exit, but Laurel pulls her back far a second.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: First you gotta tell me something.

speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: No--

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: Jerry moving dawn the hallway, hears voices.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Because I'm worried that you're
dialog: putting your faith in this guy
dialog: who, because of the way things are
dialog: going, may not have an emotional
text: marble in his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Please, if I start talking --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Guys are just different people
dialog: when they're hanging onto the
text: bottom rung.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON JERRY
dialog: 
text: listening. Pinned to the wall, listening to the kind of
dialog: honesty an agent rarely hears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: ... so what am I, for taking the
dialog: opportunity, Laurel?
dialog: (more)
dialog: 95.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY (cont'd)
dialog: Maybe I am taking advantage. Am
dialog: I a bad person? All I know is that
dialog: I found someone who was charming
dialog: and popular and not-so-nice to
dialog: me -- and he died. Okay? So why
dialog: should I let this guy go, when
dialog: everything in my body says This
dialog: One is The One.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Easy, hon, I was just looking for
dialog: fun details --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Oh, well, why didn't you say so?
dialog: And oh, I don't know if you're
dialog: interested in this detail, but I
dialog: was just about to tell you that I
dialog: love him. I love him, and I don't
dialog: care what you think. I love him
dialog: for the guy he wants to be, and I
dialog: love him for the guy he almost is.
dialog: I love him.
dialog: 
text: They look at each other. The cat is way, way out of the bag.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON JERRY
dialog: 
text: rubbing his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Hi Jerry!
dialog: 
text: Dorothy leans into the hallway now, sees Jerry standing
text: there, well within earshot. As Ray pounds down the hallway
text: in his new over-sized shirt, brought by Jerry, Dorothy begins
text: to crumble. The lack of control in her life is overwhelming
dialog: her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Oh God.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Easy, easy --
dialog: 
text: Jerry enters the kitchen, stands near Laurel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I could pretend I didn't hear, but
dialog: I won't, I heard everything.
dialog: (to Laurel)
dialog: Thank you for your honesty, as
dialog: always.
dialog: 96.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: (frozen polite)
dialog: Coffee, Jerry?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Oh, no thanks. We bottom-feeders
dialog: prefer cereal first --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Let's have Apple Jacks!
dialog: 
text: Apple Jacks it is. Dorothy, good morning, darling. He kisses
text: her on the cheek, in full view of Ray. Dorothy, still
text: embarrassed, not sure what is going on, reaches for cereal.
text: Jerry sits down for breakfast. They are an odd, but fairly
text: complete-looking family.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What's going on, Jerry?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: A lot. We got a big fax today...
dialog: we need this commission, buddy.
dialog: 
text: The sisters look at each other. Ray looks around, he feels
text: happy, but there is something else in the room. He shrugs
text: and continues to feel happy.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S HOME OFFICE -- LATER DAY
dialog: 
text: Jerry and Dorothy prepare for the Tidwells, cleaning up the
text: cramped office, unstacking chairs and making room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: That was great of you this morning.
dialog: 
text: The Tidwells honk, arriving in the driveway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (friendly, dismissive)
dialog: Look, let's just root for a big
dialog: offer so we can move out of this
text: room to a real office.
dialog: 
text: She feels slightly slapped down, but covers. She opens a
text: window quickly, and busies herself with the clutter at hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON FAX
dialog: 
text: Connecting.
dialog: 97.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOUR FACES
dialog: 
text: waiting for the results. Everybody has a stake in this fax.
text: Lives are very clearly hanging on this results. Marcee shuts
text: her eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCEE
dialog: Read it to me, and don't say
dialog: anything unless it's over nine.
dialog: 
text: There is a stunning disappointment on the fax. Jerry's heart
text: sinks. His face slackens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Aw shit --
dialog: 
text: Rod turns away. Dorothy shuts her eyes, as Marcee opens hers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCEE
dialog: One-point-seven for three years.
dialog: That's below average. We owe more
dialog: than that...
dialog: 
text: It is so very painful for her, as Tidwell slinks off to sit
text: in a seat too small for him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I'll go back to them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCEE
dialog: (explodes)
dialog: And say what? "Please remove your
dialog: dick from my ass?!"
dialog: 
text: Both men look at her. The outburst has surprised even Marcee.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCEE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm a little pregnant
dialog: right now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: I feel like crying. I feel like
text: breaking the room up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Okay, we don't take this
dialog: emotionally. We roll with this
dialog: problem.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCEE
dialog: What are you talking about --
dialog: "don't get emotional." If you ask
dialog: me, you haven't gotten emotional
dialog: ENOUGH about this man.
dialog: 98.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Marcee --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCEE
dialog: What DO you stand for???
dialog: 
text: Dorothy looks right and left, can't hold back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: How about a little piece of
dialog: integrity in this world that is so
text: filled with greed and a lack of
dialog: honorability that I don't know
dialog: what to tell my kid except take a
text: look at a guy who isn't shouting
dialog: "show me the money," he's quietly
dialog: broke and working for you for free!
dialog: (off Jerry's pained
dialog: look)
dialog: Well, I'm sorry, I'm not as good
text: at the insults as she is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCEE
dialog: No, that was pretty good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: No shit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: In fact, you should read something
dialog: that meant the world to me...
dialog: 
text: She opens a drawer, and withdraws the Mission Statement. She
text: is headed across the room to give it to Marcee, when Jerry
text: swiftly intercepts it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Another time, okay Dorothy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Fine, I just --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: And I appreciate that impulse.
dialog: 
text: Jerry throws the Mission Statement into a bottom drawer.
text: Camera moves to Tidwell, and we see him for the first time
text: without his protective shield of attitude. Scared.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Tell me what to do, Jerry. You
dialog: tell me to eat lima beans, I'll
dialog: eat lima beans.
dialog: (more)
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL (cont'd)
dialog: If you say take the shitty deal,
dialog: that's all we can get --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCEE
dialog: "All we can get?"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Can I SPEAK with my agent here?
dialog: 
text: Marcee is passionate. Focused on Rod.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCEE
dialog: You know what you're qonna do,
dialog: Rodney. You're gonna reject this
dialog: shitty contract. You're gonna play
dialog: out your existihg shitty contract
dialog: and go be a free agent next year
dialog: and the hell with Arizona. This is
dialog: us, and we determine our worth.
dialog: You're a fine, proud, surviving,
dialog: splendid black man.
dialog: 
text: Beat. Truer words... The big man looks into his wife's eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Honey, you are just --
dialog: 
text: No one else in the world exists. They are focused totally on
text: each other. Jerry and Dorothy in the background, just
text: watching the intricate machinery of this marriage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: -- the shit.
dialog: 
text: She caresses the back of his neck. He pulls her to him. He
text: gives her a small kiss. Dorothy and Jerry look at the
text: couple, fascinated and somewhat uncomfortable. There is a
text: palpable forcefield around the Tidwells. They are a couple
text: in every passionate sense of the word. After a beat:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: If you get injured, you get
dialog: nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Won't happen. I'm strong in my
dialog: mind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: It's a risk.
dialog: 
text: Jerry looks over to Dorothy, who grits her teeth at the
dialog: implications of the decision.
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Bet on me, dude. Bet on me like
dialog: I bet on you.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCEE

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Don't be silly.

speaker_heading: MARCEE
dialog: My husband believes in you. We're
dialog: gonna make it. Bye bye Dorothy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Take care you guys.
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. COMMERCIAL SET/TAYLOR CHEVROLET/ARIZONA -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Tidwell stands on the set of a regional Arizona car
text: commercial. It is a hot day. Three other bored, large

text: arguing with Tidwell.
dialog: 101.
dialog:

dialog: Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Bill, Rod, wait --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Dude, know your art form. If you
dialog: put the camera down here, looking
dialog: up, I look more powerful. There's
dialog: no need for a camel... you got ME.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Rod, get on the camel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOOLER
dialog: (shoots look to Jerry)
dialog: The sponsor wants a camel --

speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Jerry, back me up. It's either
dialog: the camel or me...
dialog: 
text: Tidwell waves his arms, spooking the camel, who spits and
text: stormps. Several crew members scatter in various directions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (takes the bullet)
dialog: Airight. Enough. I'm pulling him
dialog: out of this. This isn't what I
dialog: had in mind anyway.

speaker_heading: DOOLER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Oh, we gonna be friends now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: What do you know about dating a

dialog: 
text: Tidwell warms to the personal question.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Oh I know plenty. I was raised by
dialog: a single mother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Tell me, because it's been a
dialog: month, and she's about to take
dialog: another job in San Diego.
dialog: 
text: Tidwell is always happy to hold forth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: First, single mothers don't
dialog: "date." They have been to the
dialog: circus, you know what I'm saying?
dialog: They have been to the puppet show
dialog: and they have seen the strings.
dialog: You love her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: How do I know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: You know when you know. It makes

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: No, I don't know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Then you gotta have The Talk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: But I sure don't like that she's
dialog: leaving.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Well, that ain't fair to her. A

dialog: 103.
dialog:

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: The kid is amazing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: (shaking head)
dialog: No. A real man does not shoplift

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I didn't "shoplift the pooty." We
dialog: were thrown together and -- I mean
dialog: it's two mutual people who --
dialog: (a look)
dialog: Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.

speaker_heading: TIDWELL

speaker_heading: DOROTHY

scene_heading: EXT. DOROTHY'S FRONT YARD -- DAY

dialog: 
scene_heading: POV -- THE SISTERS
dialog: 
text: We see Jerry, following Chad back to the house, saying

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DOROTHY'S PLACE -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Jerry scoots a very sad Ray over, and talks to him in the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I'm not good at this.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY

dialog: I'll see you this weekend, okay?

dialog:

speaker_heading: JERRY

dialog: Sure you're okay to drive this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY

speaker_heading: JERRY

speaker_heading: DOROTHY

dialog: (simple, with shrug)
dialog: I love you.
dialog: 
text: Jerry blinks.
dialog: 106.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (too quick, weirdly)
dialog: ... I love you too, you know.

speaker_heading: JERRY

dialog: What --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Look, just in case this weekend

dialog: 
text: He shudders a little with the intimacy of her words. She

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Wait a second.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON DOROTHY
dialog:

speaker_heading: JERRY

speaker_heading: JERRY

dialog: ... what if we stayed together?

text: He holds onto a table for a moment, steadies himself. Jerry
text: takes a breath and moves into the kitchen. Finds a beer. He

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Well, this was another way to go.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL

scene_heading: INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM/PHOENIX -- DAY
dialog:

text: Everything flows from her. Next to her is Tyson, and then
dialog: the cousins, the neighborhood friends. At this particular

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYSON
dialog: (proudly, to family)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I'm a little worried --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: I'm worried too. I'm worried that

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: No, you're --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: I'm trying to talk to you. How's
dialog: your marriage?
dialog: 
text: Jerry looks at Rod for a moment. It is the simplest

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Not everyone has what you have.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Then why'd you get married? I'm

dialog: for you. Are we really "friends?"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Why not --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Well, friends can tell each other
dialog: anything, right? If we have our

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: (wary)
dialog: I think so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (intense)
dialog: Airight. Here's why you don't

speaker_heading: JERRY (cont'd)
dialog: (finger rises to

dialog: That's not what inspires people.

text: Tidwell looks at him, chews his toothpick.

speaker_heading: SUGAR
dialog: (continuing)

speaker_heading: TIDWELL

speaker_heading: SUGAR
dialog: Rod. I know this is "uncool" to

dialog: 
dialog: Here comes Jerry Maguire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Get the fuck away from my guy,

dialog:

dialog: approach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: Jerry! You made it --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (off Sugar)
dialog: Go. Flee.

scene_heading: INT. FIELD -- NIGHT

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The Tidwell clan are banging on t.v. trays and whooping
text: loudly. But in the middle of the cheers, Marcee sees the
text: unsettled look on young Tyson's face. She pulls him over to
text: her, giving him preference over baby Kaydee. He is the only

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCEE
dialog: What does daddy say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYSON
dialog: "It looks worse than it is...
dialog:

speaker_heading: FRANK GIFFORD'S VOICE
dialog: They don't pay enough for a man to
dialog: take that kind of ugly hit --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCEE
dialog: (to others)
dialog: Boy, no s-h-i-t.
dialog: 
text: Big laughs from the living room. Except Tee Pee.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEE PEE

dialog: 
text: Maguire watches as Arizona's quarterback John Swenson drops

dialog: 122.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Philadelphia fans cheer wildly. The game is turning uglier
text: by the minute. Jerry looks up to the monitor for a closet
text: look at the next play.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON PRESS BOX MONITOR
dialog: 
text: Swenson, the Arizona quarterback, throws a wobbly pass into
text: the end-zone. Tidwell leaps for the catch, tucks the ball in
text: and is promptly and brutally hit by two defenders from two
text: different sides. This hit is bad. Worse than bad. Tidwell
text: flips and comes down like a sack of potatoes, with a thud,
text: ball still in his hands. His head hits the astroturf, hard.
text: Tidwell is out cold. And the ripple effect of the injury
text: shoots through the stadium. Jerry stares at the monitor,
text: stunned by the sudden brutality.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ARIZONA FIELD -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: We are thrust into the vortex, inside the game. Tidwell lies
text: still on turf. Overhead, the fight music continues for a few
text: seconds before disappearing abruptly. Players and coaches
text: begin to gather around the still body of Rod Tidwell.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TV MONITOR -- SLO-MO
dialog: 
text: The hit in replay. It is brutal. And we can see a flash of
text: his pride as he catches the lousy pass, and then... like two
text: bulls, the Philadelphia defenders enter from each side. One
text: cuts his legs out from under him, and Rod's taut body
text: literally flips. The second defender then hits him at the
text: shoulders. Tidwell lands on the back of his neck, crumpling
text: downwards. Still holding the ball. Still.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Silence. Utter silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIFFORD'S VOICE
dialog: -- you sure hope his family
dialog: wasn't watching that.
dialog: 
text: And then, in a cry that gurgles from way down deep, Marcee
text: begins to sob. Camera catches the face of Tyson, now
text: panicked. Scared, he embraces his mother.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BOWELS OF SUN DEVIL STADIUM
dialog: 
text: Maguire sprints through the inner bowels of the stadium. He
text: turns the corner, into the tunnel, talking his way past a

dialog: field.
dialog: 123.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
dialog:

speaker_heading: MARCEE

scene_heading: POV TIDWELL - SLO-MO -- SILENCE
dialog: 
dialog: The Doctors and the Trainers are now truly panicked. We
text: don't hear them. We see them, their motions increasingly
text: manic. Shoving fingers in front of him. Screaming. We read
text: their lips. ("Rod!" "Rod can you hear us!") We see the
text: anguish and escalating fear on their faces. The Trainer
text: leans in close, bellowing, he spreads his hands wide to clap
text: right in front of Rod's still face. His hands head toward
text: each other... closer... bringing with them the first inkling
text: of sound... getting closer and then finally coming together,
text: bringing with him the sounds of the stadium.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON TIDWELL
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRAINER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON MAGUIRE
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON TIDWELL
dialog: 
dialog: Has never felt like this before in his life. It is the pure
dialog: and absolute love of the spotlight. And his fans.
dialog: 
text: And then... it's real and he feels it. Tidwell breaks out in
text: a small but unmistakable move -- a flutter step. He does a
text: high-stepping move, all his own, for about ten yards.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON JERRY MAGUIRE
dialog: 
text: who watches, now in complete disbelief. Tidwell will not let

speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Nike.
dialog: 
text: He moves past Jerry Maguire on his way off the field. Jerry,
text: casually thumps his heart twice. Jerry Maguire is overcome
text: with emotion. He sits down on a camera case, head in his
text: hands. Behind him, a stadium cheers a new hero.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OVERHEARD FAN
dialog: I always knew he was great.
dialog: 
text: Maguire rubs his face. Overcome. Photographers and others
text: rush past to be closer to Tidwell.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL -- LATER
dialog: 
text: Jerry Maguire surrounded by well-wishers and backslappers and
dialog: Sportswriters. Success has returned, in all of it's
text: superficial grandeur. He is a star again, by association.
text: We catch the look on Maguire's face. Try as he might, he
text: can't manufacture the joy of the moment. There is a void.
text: Over the heads of the heatseekers we see Dennis Wilburn
text: nodding, holding a thumbs up. He tries to get to Maguire,
text: but cannot. And then a commotion behind them all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: It's Tidwell!
dialog: 
text: Tidwell exits the locker room. Press and media surround him.
text: Even the grizzled old-time stadium workers reach in to

dialog: Maguire.
dialog: 
text: They hug. Cameras flash. Tears roll down from beneath his
text: purple shades.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIDWELL
dialog: We did it.
dialog: 
text: And now, in the middle of this emotional union, a portable
text: phone rings. Both men reach for their porties. It's
text: Maguire's. With anticipation, he answers.
dialog: 127.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Hello.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's Marcee. She says she
dialog: couldn't get through on your phone.

dialog: 
scene_heading: ON JERRY MAGUIRE
dialog: 
text: He feels the cover, flips through it a little. Memories

text: as Tidwell continues singing in the background. Suddenly, an
text: odd feeling. A shiver runs up and down his spine. His
text: forehead tingles. He rubs his face. All he can do is think
dialog: of Dorothy.

dialog: comfortable with your pain. Plus,
dialog: Jan, you always spill your red
text: wine on the couch.
dialog: (off Jan's guilty
dialog: look)
dialog: I've not been fair to you. Women
dialog: need to stick together, and not
dialog: depend on the affections of a man
dialog: to "fix" their lives. Maybe
dialog: you're all correct. Men are the

speaker_heading: JERRY

dialog: This used to be my specialty. I

dialog: now I just... I don't know... but
dialog: on what was supposed to be the
dialog: happiest night of my business
dialog: life, it wasn't complete, wasn't
text: nearly close to being in the same
dialog: vicinity as complete, because I
dialog: couldn't share it with you. I
dialog: couldn't hear your voice, or laugh
dialog: about it with you. I missed my
