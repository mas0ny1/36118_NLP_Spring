speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah. Hey, guess what, Mom?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I figured out where wasps come from.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Oh, yeah? Where?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Well, I think it must be if you flick

text: turn into a wasp.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Dang...
speaker_heading: MASON

speaker_heading: MOM

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: What did she say?

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Well... she said that you weren't

dialog: She said she found a big chunk of
text: them crumpled up at the bottom of
dialog: your backpack.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: She didn't ask for 'em.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Well, baby, she doesn't have to.
dialog: You're supposed to turn them in.
dialog: And she said you're still staring

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Not all day.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: And she said that you destroyed her
dialog: pencil sharpener.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Not on purpose.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Wait, she said that you crammed a

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I thought if it could sharpen pencils,
dialog: maybe we could sharpen rocks.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: (stifling laugh)
dialog: Well, what were you gonna do with a
dialog: bunch of sharpened rocks?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I was trying to make arrowheads for

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Hm.

scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE/DITCH - DAY

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Dude, when's my turn?
speaker_heading: TOMMY

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Why didn't you call somebody else?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Well, I can't get a baby-sitter now,

dialog: "She haunts a toilet?"
speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: MOM (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - LATER

speaker_heading: TED (O.S.)

speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)
dialog: I'm sorry. I don't want to go with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: TED (O.S.)
dialog: You're sorry, that's bullshit!
speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)
dialog: That's right, I wanna stay here with

speaker_heading: TED (O.S.)
dialog: All right. Would you stop using

speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)
dialog: I'm not using my kids as an excuse!
dialog: You don't even know--
speaker_heading: TED (O.S.)
dialog: I know you have to stay here with
dialog: your kids! You're acting--
speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)
dialog: You have this immature life--
speaker_heading: TED (O.S.)
dialog: And why do I always-- Why--
speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)
dialog: You have no responsibility.
speaker_heading: TED (O.S.)
dialog: I have an immature life! I have an

dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)
dialog: And I have responsibilities, okay,
dialog: you don't know what it's like to be
dialog: a parent.
speaker_heading: TED (O.S.)
dialog: No, I don't! And why am I responsible

speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)
dialog: If you had any idea. You don't think
dialog: I wouldn't--
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Mason peeks around the corner to watch as the argument

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Don't call my kids mistakes! Don't!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I'm not responsible for your life
dialog: choic-- I didn't call your kids--
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: You said, "Your respons-- your
dialog: mistakes in your life," pointing at
dialog: my kids.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I know what I said, you know what,

dialog: again.
text: Mason peeks through the doorway.
speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)
dialog: This is the reality: I'm a parent!
speaker_heading: TED (O.S.)
dialog: That's, that's hysterical.
speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)
dialog: That means responsibility.
speaker_heading: TED (O.S.)

speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)
dialog: I would love to have some time to

speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Go have some dinner, go to a bar! I

scene_heading: INT. KID'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: "Oops, you think I'm in love. I'm

speaker_heading: MASON (O.S.)
dialog: Stop! Quit it!
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Quit! Mom!
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: "But to lose all my senses-- that

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: What the hell is going on in here?!
text: Samantha has instantaneously shifted from singing to crying.
speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you guys know what time it is?
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: (through tears/sobs)
dialog: He's throwing things at me...
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Mason! Do not throw things at your

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: She's faking, she hit me first!!
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Listen, both of you! I am going
dialog: back to bed. I don't wanna hear

dialog: Go to sleep.

dialog: Faker!
speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)
dialog: Hey!
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: MOM

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Well, soon. We should be out by the

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: No, Mother, we're not moving. Nope,
dialog: nope, sorry Mom. Nope. Nope.
dialog: Smack, smack, smack...
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Samantha, I have to go back to college
dialog: so I can make us a better living.
dialog: Smack.
speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: With this job I can't take care of
dialog: us the way I'd like to. I can't
dialog: keep going this way. And Grandma
dialog: said she'd help us out... and it
dialog: would be nice to be near her.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Fine, Mother. You can do whatever
dialog: you want but

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: What about our friends?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Oh, baby, we can e-mail them or write.
dialog: We can come back to visit. And guess
dialog: what?
text: She reaches out to touch Samantha's arm.
speaker_heading: MOM (CONT'D)
dialog: This place that Grandma found us,

dialog: Right?
text: Samantha shrugs.
speaker_heading: MOM (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Mason and Mom are lying on his bed together.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Mom, do you still love Dad?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I still love your father... but that
dialog: doesn't mean it was healthy for us
dialog: to stay together.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: What if after we move he's trying to
dialog: find us and he can't?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Oh, that won't be a problem. He can
dialog: call Grandma and she'll tell him or
dialog: he can call Information. We won't
dialog: be hard to find.
text: She pushes back his hair lovingly.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Is he still in Alaska?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Well, that's what your uncle says.
speaker_heading: MASON

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Here, wanna help me out?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Okay. Take this paint... very

scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR - DAY

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Okay, let's go, 'cause I wanna get

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Goodbye yard, goodbye crepe myrtle,

dialog: Goodbye house, I'll never like mommy
dialog: as much for making us move.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Samantha! Why don't you say goodbye

dialog: neighborhood.
speaker_heading: MASON
text: Goodbye old lady who listens to rock

text: Soon the car is pulling away. As they drive off, Mason
text: notices out his side of the car, Tommy approaching on a bike
text: in the distance, gesturing toward the car. Mason watches

text: the distance.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY
text: Mason and Samantha are restless and energetic, letting their
text: childish energy get the best of them as they wrestle, hit,
text: and squeal at each other in the back seat of the car. It is
text: all well-intentioned though, as the two share a laugh after
text: Mom tells them to quiet down.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Eeeee! Don't!
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Hey! Hey, what's happening back
dialog: there? Stop, put the barrier up.

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Hey, put the pillow between you.
dialog: Make a barrier, come on. Stop.

speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: TAMMY

text: Tammy walks away. Mason smirks at his dad.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Don't -- don't, don't look at me
dialog: like that, alright? I just -- look,
dialog: just to finish the point -- okay? I
dialog: was twenty-three when your mom had
dialog: you, alright? So was she, alright?
dialog: And we didn't put ourselves in the
dialog: best position to be great parents,
dialog: and I wish that -- I wish I were a
dialog: better parent to you guys. Alright?
dialog: And I, I hope that you can learn
dialog: from my mistakes. Okay? So, wear a

speaker_heading: SONG

speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: SONG

text: Dad sings along.
speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: All over Texas?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Well, if you gotta move, you gotta
dialog: move, you know? It's no big deal.
dialog: We can handle that. I'll still come
dialog: get you every other weekend. I mean,
dialog: unless she moves 500 miles away or
dialog: something, it'll just be a little
dialog: more car time. No big deal.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I'm just kinda sick of moving.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Well, I bet you are. But you know,
dialog: you never know. I mean, I might
dialog: have to move, right? I'm working
dialog: for this insurance company now.
dialog: These places get bought and sold all
dialog: the time. You know? We'll just
dialog: roll with it.
text: They take off pants, walk up to the water in boxer shorts.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I thought you were a musician?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I am but... life is expensive, you
dialog: know. Guy's got to be responsible.
dialog: What do you think?
text: Mason pushes his Dad into the water, then dives in himself.
speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Oh yeah? How'd that go?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Pretty terrible.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: (Laughs)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Well, when we're at school, we got
dialog: plenty to talk about, but when we're
dialog: alone or on the phone, it's like we
dialog: have nothing in common.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Nothing?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Uh, she's not interested in music or
dialog: video games or... the three best
dialog: movies this summer...
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: All right. What?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Tropic Thunder, Dark Knight and
dialog: Pineapple Express.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yeah, what about 'em?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: She said they all sucked.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Okay, well what's she interested in?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I don't know. Goin' to the mall
dialog: with her stupid friends.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Alright. Well, is she cute? Watch
dialog: your step there.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yeah? Alright. Well, here's what
dialog: you do. Alright. First off, you
dialog: gotta ask her a lot of questions.
dialog: Then you have to listen to the
dialog: answers, alright, actually be
dialog: interested in her. Alright, if you
dialog: can do those things, you're gonna be

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Mm-hm. Advertisement quality.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah.
text: Dad laughs.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: You think they ever will make another
dialog: "Star Wars"?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I don't know. I mean, I think if
dialog: they were to make another one that
text: the period where the game is set is
dialog: where it would have to be, 'cause
dialog: there's nothin' after, really. At
dialog: the end --
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yeah, no, "Return of the Jedi" it's
dialog: over. There's nothin' --
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah, there's nothing else to do

speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Mornin'.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: You gotta pee?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Ah. Hit the campfire. Ancient, uh,

text: Mason pees onto the fire.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

speaker_heading: MASON

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Psychology... I think. What are you
dialog: up to?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Oh, my mom owns Needleworks.
speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: JILL (CONT'D)
dialog: The arts and crafts store over there?
dialog: So I'm just kind of hanging out.
dialog: But I'm supposed to be going to the

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: How come?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: You know Courtney? Girl with the
dialog: dyed black hair and the nose ring?
dialog: Wears Hot Topic every day?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I... think so.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: We used to be best friends growing
dialog: up, but we've kinda grown apart.
dialog: She sorta got all emo. She thinks
dialog: I'm a prep. But, I still consider
dialog: her a friend! Anyway, she cut one
dialog: of her wrists. I don't know how
dialog: bad, but I think I should go visit.
text: Jill glances down at the book in Mason's hand.
speaker_heading: JILL (CONT'D)
dialog: So what are you reading?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Oh, it's uh, "Breakfast of Champions".
dialog: Kurt Vonnegut.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I think my older brother likes him.
dialog: I'm reading "To Kill a Mockingbird"
dialog: for the third time. My friends make
dialog: fun of me. I think I'm the only
dialog: girl in the whole school who doesn't
dialog: like the "Twilight" books. Have you
dialog: read them?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Sure haven't.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I tried... but it was so cheesy! So
dialog: how do you like San Marcos?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I like it alright. It's a lot smaller
dialog: than Houston, but it seems pretty
dialog: cool. Have you always lived here?
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Yeah. If you want the big city around
dialog: here, you have to drive to San Antonio
dialog: or Austin. Have you been there yet?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I went to San Antonio for a day,
dialog: but... I haven't been to Austin yet.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: That's where all the high school
dialog: kids go, on weekends, for shows and
dialog: stuff.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: That's what I've heard.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: So are you going to Shauna's party

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Um... I think I heard about it. I'm
dialog: not really sure, though.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Well you should!
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Why's that?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Well -- LeeAnn has a big crush on
dialog: you and I know she was hoping you
dialog: would go. You don't have a
dialog: girlfriend, do you?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Not currently.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Well then, you should come. I'll
dialog: tell Chase to make sure you're there.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: But don't tell LeeAnn I told you
dialog: that. She'd kill me.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I won't.

speaker_heading: JILL

scene_heading: INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)
dialog: His cognitive series, his interviews
dialog: with orphans, Ethology theorists'
dialog: work... And then he in turn was
text: supported strongly by Harry Harlow's
dialog: rhesus monkey study. Now you guys,
dialog: you gotta think, this is the 1950's,
dialog: this was radical! This flew in the
dialog: face of traditional learning theory,
dialog: of B.F. Skinner's classical and
dialog: instrumental conditioning. Now,
dialog: Bowlby is going to argue that human
dialog: survival depends on us falling in
dialog: love. It depends on me falling in
dialog: love with my mother, and my mother
dialog: falling in love with me. And if
dialog: that doesn't happen, we're pretty
dialog: much doomed. Now think about it. A
text: tiger chases our tribe out of a cave.
dialog: Now an ideal mother goes, "Huh! My
dialog: baby! I love you! I'll protect
dialog: you!" Or... "Well you, why am I
dialog: going to pick you up? You're going
dialog: to slow me down. You... are... tiger
dialog: kibble!"

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Mom, I know what you're gonna say.
dialog: She was running late and we couldn't

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: No, no! No excuses! The bottom
dialog: line is you didn't do what you said
dialog: you were gonna do. You stranded
dialog: your brother!
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: It's embarrassing to ask my friend
dialog: to turn around and go get some kid
text: at the middle school.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: What do you mean "some kid"? He's
dialog: your brother! And you know what?
dialog: We've helped Janie out before. I

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: You know what, Samantha? You need

speaker_heading: MOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you want to be a cooperative

dialog: be a self-centered narcissist?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: You know what? You're right. I am
dialog: this horrible person... But honestly,
dialog: he's not a baby anymore. You don't
dialog: have to treat him like one. He's in
text: eighth grade and he can find his way

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: You know what? When Gaby leaves,

speaker_heading: SENIOR GUY
dialog: Hey, fuck you, you little penis
dialog: wrinkle. You know, you're lucky to
dialog: even be here. This is our camp out.
dialog: The only reason you little cum gums
dialog: are here is because fucking Charlie's
dialog: mom made him bring his little asshole
dialog: brother, and then he drags along you
text: little dice danglers. Fucking fuzz
dialog: nut, talking shit!
text: Senior Guy throws a beer just past Tony.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: SENIOR GUY

speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: SENIOR GUY
dialog: Dude, it's okay to be gay. We

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I'm not gay.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Give it some time, man. You'll
dialog: realize.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Fuck y'all.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: See, that's exactly my point, man.
dialog: Nah, but we don't have whores coming

speaker_heading: SENIOR GUY
dialog: Yeah, and you just earned your Vag

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: COLLEGE GIRL
dialog: Wow. How long have you been doing
dialog: that for?
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Not very long. Um, I went to this
dialog: camp thing just this past summer.
speaker_heading: COLLEGE GIRL
dialog: They have a camp for graffiti?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Well, they call it "urban art".
speaker_heading: COLLEGE GIRL
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: So it sounds, you know, less illegal,
dialog: but... it was really just a way to
dialog: get free spray paint.
speaker_heading: COLLEGE GIRL
dialog: Cool. So is this your tag? Is that --
dialog: do they still call it...?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah, but you know, it's just letters

speaker_heading: COLLEGE GIRL
dialog: Oh. K...
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: E.
speaker_heading: COLLEGE GIRL

speaker_heading: COLLEGE GIRL

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: How's she doing? You know, is she --
dialog: is she a good teacher and everything?
speaker_heading: COLLEGE GIRL
dialog: Yeah! She's great. She's super

scene_heading: INT. DINING AREA - MOMENTS LATER
text: One of Mom's students, JIM, tells a story while the group
text: sits around the table eating.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: ...So anyway, we figured out a way
dialog: to rig up our iPods to the external
dialog: speakers on the ASV. So every time
dialog: we come rolling into town, you knew
dialog: the 456 was there, 'cause we were
dialog: bumping House of Pain. It was like,
dialog: "Jump around, Jump around." And the
text: whole family's coming outside, and
dialog: you got the kids and the mom and the
text: dad, and they're all bouncing up and
dialog: down. We're throwing out candies
dialog: for the kids, and soccer balls, and
dialog: Beanie Babies, and Frisbees... Um,
dialog: like, smokes for the adults. And
dialog: they loved, they absolutely loved,
dialog: Gatorade. But for some reason, you
dialog: know, they hated the lemon-lime
dialog: flavor. I don't know what it was.
dialog: Yeah. Couldn't give it away.
dialog: 102.
text: The group laughs.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: How long were you over there?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Uhh... I did two tours in Iraq and
dialog: one in Bosnia.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Did you enlist?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I was, um, Army
dialog: National Guard. And, uh, you know
text: coming straight out of high school.
dialog: Needed money for college. Seemed
dialog: like a decent paying job. And, uh,
dialog: did my tour. And whenever I got
dialog: done, I told them if there's, you
dialog: know, a world-changing event, I'll
dialog: come back. And, uh, 3 months later
dialog: 9/11 happened. And I was back 9/12.
dialog: And I'm proud to say the 456, the
dialog: whole time we were there, we never
dialog: lost a guy. Not one casualty.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: But is that odd? Is that unusual?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yeah. Almost impossible. Like the
dialog: guys that came along after us and
dialog: replaced us, they didn't listen to
dialog: any of our advice. They, you know,
dialog: did basically the polar opposite of
dialog: what we did, and they lost seven
dialog: guys in the first month.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Wow. What did you guys do
dialog: differently?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Well, I'd like to think it's just a
dialog: matter of mutual respect, you know.
dialog: I mean, all the time we spent over
dialog: there building trust, I mean these
dialog: guys basically destroyed it in three
dialog: days.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
dialog: So, what did the locals think about

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
dialog: Yeah, because those who hear Fox, in

speaker_heading: MOM

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yeah, no... But I had to sell that
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: You what?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yeah, I had to sell that.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: So... so it's gone?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yeah, some sucker collector from
dialog: California paid twenty-two grand for
dialog: it, which is great 'cause I basically
dialog: got to pay for this in cash. I only
dialog: paid eighty-five hundred for that
dialog: thing way back when. I mean, you
dialog: know, cars are generally a terrible
dialog: investment. You know? Soon as you
dialog: drive them off the lot you got a used
dialog: car on your hands, and the value's
text: only dropping from there.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: But... if you take care of it, you
dialog: know, and you get lucky and it's a
dialog: classic, you know, the value starts
dialog: going up again. I mean shit, you got
dialog: guys paying hundreds of thousands of
dialog: dollars for some Shelby Cobra.
text: After a long silence, Dad notices Mason is unusually quiet.
speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: You don't remember?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Remember what?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Really? You said that was going to
dialog: be my car when I turned sixteen.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: What? No, I didn't. I never said
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I remember. I was in third grade
dialog: and you were taking me over to Anthony
dialog: Nagar's house for his birthday...
dialog: and we were there early, so we gave
dialog: him a ride around the block. And he
dialog: was talking about how much he loved
dialog: your car and so you were all like
dialog: "Oh. This is going to be Mason's
dialog: when he turns 16."
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: What are you..? Alright, first off,
dialog: I have no memory of that, alright?
dialog: Second of all, I would never say
dialog: that. Never.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah. You did though.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: What? Mason. Come on, what about
dialog: your sister? I'm just gonna forget
dialog: about her? Come on, how's that fair?
dialog: Huh? Anthony Nagar, what the?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Are you...? Oh, come on! I mean,
dialog: you're not... Ughh.
dialog: Look, you can sit there like there's
dialog: a death in the family, alright, but
dialog: bottom line is that was my car.
dialog: Alright? I paid for it, I took care
dialog: of it, and I can do whatever I want
dialog: with it. Alright? I'm sorry if you
dialog: had other ideas about it but when
dialog: you get older you can save up and
dialog: buy a car of your own. And be cool
dialog: like I used to be. Or... you can
dialog: get a mini-van.
text: Annie and Samantha watch a Lady Gaga music video on Samantha's

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: She's coming to Houston?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: ANNIE

dialog: the, the little birthday present for
dialog: Mason?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah, babe.
text: Annie hands a small wrapped present to Dad. Mason unwraps
text: the gift to reveal a CD set.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Alright. This one, this one needs a
dialog: little explanation, okay? Open it
dialog: up. I call that "The Beatles' Black
dialog: Album". Alright, what it is, is the
text: best of John, Paul, George, and Ringo
text: solo, post-break up.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yeah, basically, I put the band back
dialog: together for you.
text: Annie Laughs.
speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, whenever you listen to too
dialog: much of the solo stuff, it kind of
dialog: becomes a drag, you know? But you
dialog: put 'em next to each other, alright,
text: and they start to elevate each
dialog: other... and then you can hear it.
dialog: Huh! It's The Beatles. You know?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I don't know. I think I always just
dialog: liked Paul the best.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: It doesn't matter, you know, you're
text: missing the point. There is no
dialog: favorite Beatle! That's what I'm
dialog: saying. It's in the balance. That's
dialog: what made them the greatest fucking
dialog: rock band in the world. Okay? You
dialog: know, and there's this decade of
text: music out there that's been scattered.
dialog: Alright?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: And now it has been carefully found,
dialog: arranged, and ordered for you, by
dialog: your loving father.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Very arranged and very organized,
dialog: over and over again by your loving
dialog: father.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yes, yes, yes. So, I mean, look at
dialog: that-- look at that, uh, top of Volume
dialog: II, first four tracks... You've got
dialog: "Band on the Run" into "My Sweet
dialog: Lord", into "Jealous Guy", into
dialog: "Photograph". I mean, come on.
dialog: It's like the perfect segue. You
dialog: got Paul, who takes you to the party,
dialog: George who talks to you about God,
dialog: John who says no, it's about love
text: and pain, and then Ringo who just
dialog: says hey, can't we enjoy what we
dialog: have while we have it? It's a good

dialog: Bible? Look, there's your name...
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: NANA
text: ...In gold. And wait-wait-wait-wait.
dialog: Look at this. It's a Red Letter

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: NANA
dialog: Like it? Alright. I love you,

speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: GRANDPA CLIFF

speaker_heading: GRANDPA CLIFF (CONT'D)
text: There's a 20 gauge shotgun.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: GRANDPA CLIFF
dialog: Yeah. My dad gave it to me when I
dialog: was a little younger than you, and
dialog: his dad gave it to him, and well,
dialog: you're fifteen and I'd like for you
dialog: to have it. Alright? Here, you
dialog: hold it. Yeah.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: (taking the gun)
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: GRANDPA CLIFF
dialog: Congratulations, son. I'll teach
dialog: you how to clean it, teach you how

scene_heading: EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY
text: Samantha holds a pistol, ready to shoot. Dad is helping her

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Now cock it. Alright, there you go.
dialog: Now, what you want to do is line up
text: the front sight with the back sight,
dialog: here, you see this little V right
dialog: here --
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Mm-hm.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Now which one you aiming at?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Ah, the middle can.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: The middle can? Alright, alright.
dialog: Now fire at will, alright?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: GRANDPA CLIFF

text: Mason misses the fist shot.
speaker_heading: GRANDPA CLIFF (CONT'D)
dialog: You uh, you uh, hit a little low.
text: Wait until it gets up high and then
dialog: shoot. Alright? Cause then it's a
dialog: better aim coming down. Remember,

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Mm-hm.
speaker_heading: GRANDPA CLIFF
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Mm-hm.
speaker_heading: GRANDPA CLIFF

speaker_heading: GRANDPA CLIFF (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Good!
speaker_heading: DAD AND ANNIE
dialog: (singing)
dialog: If you go home, you're rolling the

dialog: 121.
speaker_heading: DAD (O.S.)
dialog: Alright, you're our first audience,

speaker_heading: GRANDPA CLIFF
dialog: It was really wonderful. That's
dialog: sweet. Sweet.
speaker_heading: NANA

speaker_heading: PREACHER (O.S.)

scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - DAY

speaker_heading: PREACHER

dialog: see those nail prints in his hands."
dialog: Poof! About that time, here comes
text: Jesus, standing right next to him.
dialog: Okay? And he turns to Thomas. Don't
dialog: you know Thomas felt some shame?
text: And he turns to Thomas and says,
dialog: "Thomas, here, stick your finger in
dialog: my side. Look at these nail prints.
dialog: It's me." And Thomas says, "My Lord,
dialog: and my God, I believe."
text: Annie's parents nod in agreement.
speaker_heading: PREACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: And Jesus said, "Well, that's good.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 122.
speaker_heading: PREACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: But blessed are those who can believe
dialog: without seeing." It's a lot easier
dialog: when you can see, and feel, and touch.
dialog: But like us, we haven't seen him in
dialog: the flesh. We haven't felt him in
dialog: the flesh. But we have experienced
dialog: him in the spirit. At least I have,
dialog: and I hope y'all have too.

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Hey, you guys don't mind coming back

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: No, it's fine.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Sam?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I appreciate it. It means a lot to
dialog: Annie and her folks, you know.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Were we baptized?
text: They share a look and laugh.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I wasn't the least bit concerned
dialog: with the state of your soul. We can
dialog: do it now, though, if you want.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: No, nah, I think I'm alright.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: You and Cooper together, you know.
dialog: Dunk your heads.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: You're not becoming one of those God
dialog: people, are you, Dad?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: And what's that supposed to mean,
dialog: hm?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I can hear you!
dialog: 124.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Well, I think that shotgun should

text: Dad picks up a rock.
speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, look out, Sam. Let me show you

scene_heading: INT. DARKROOM - DAY
text: Mason is developing a picture in the darkroom. His teacher,

speaker_heading: TURLINGTON
dialog: How long you been in here, Mason?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I'm not sure.
speaker_heading: TURLINGTON
dialog: I'm sure. All class. Did you
dialog: complete your image diary?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Not yet.
speaker_heading: TURLINGTON
dialog: Completed your, uh, digital contact
dialog: sheet?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Not quite, but... I mean, it's not
dialog: gonna take me long.
speaker_heading: TURLINGTON
text: Not yet. Not quite. Darkroom time
dialog: is extra-curricular. I mean
dialog: technically, you don't ever have to
dialog: be in here these days, and certainly
dialog: not until you've completed your
dialog: assignments. That's the deal.
dialog: 125.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: TURLINGTON
dialog: I'm worried about you, Mason.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Why is that?
speaker_heading: TURLINGTON
dialog: I'll tell you why. The images you're
dialog: turning in, they're cool. You're
dialog: looking at things in a really unique
dialog: way. Got a lot of natural talent.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: TURLINGTON
dialog: Yeah, but, that and fifty cents will
dialog: just get you a cup of coffee in this
dialog: old world. I've met a lot of talented
dialog: people over the years. How many of
dialog: them made it professionally without
dialog: discipline, commitment, and a really
dialog: good work ethic?
text: Mason shrugs and shakes his head, unsure.
speaker_heading: TURLINGTON (CONT'D)
dialog: I can tell you. I can count it on
dialog: two fingers. Zero. It's not gonna
dialog: happen for you, Mason. The world is
dialog: too competitive. There are too many
dialog: talented people who are willing to
dialog: work hard. And a butt-load of morons
dialog: who are untalented, who are more
dialog: than willing to surpass you. As a
dialog: matter of fact, a lot of them are
dialog: sitting in that classroom out there
dialog: right now. Hm? You know what they're
dialog: doing? They're doing their
dialog: assignments, which is what you're
dialog: supposed to be doing, but you're
dialog: not. You're in here. Why is that?
dialog: Are you special, Mason?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: No, but I mean the things you're
dialog: talking about, like work ethic or
dialog: whatever, I feel like I do work pretty
dialog: hard. I spend the whole weekend
dialog: taking pictures a lot of times.
dialog: 126.
speaker_heading: TURLINGTON
dialog: You like football, Mason?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: TURLINGTON
dialog: Yeah, I know you don't. That's why
dialog: I've just assigned you to shoot the
dialog: football game tonight. Okay? It
dialog: starts at 7:30. I want you to get
dialog: there early. I want you to shoot a
dialog: full card, three hundred images, and
dialog: I want 'em downloaded, I want 'em
dialog: sorted, and I want to see them very
dialog: first thing Monday. Okay? You want
dialog: to know why I'm doing this?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: TURLINGTON
dialog: Who do you want to be, Mason? What
dialog: do you want to do?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I want to take pictures. Make art.
speaker_heading: TURLINGTON
dialog: Any dip-shit can take pictures, Mason.
dialog: Art, that's special. What can you
dialog: bring to it that nobody else can?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: That's what I'm trying to find out.
speaker_heading: TURLINGTON
dialog: Try harder. Hey, maybe in twenty
dialog: years you can call old Mr. Turlington
dialog: and you can say, "Thank you, sir,
dialog: for that terrific dark room chat we
dialog: had that day."
dialog: (walking away)
dialog: Get back to class and do your work.

dialog: Come on, this auction is going to
dialog: end on Sunday, honey. You've got to
dialog: get those posted.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Why are we even doing this? It's
dialog: like an online junk shop. I thought
dialog: you had a good job?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I do. We're what you call house
dialog: poor. Everyone's got to do their
dialog: part. Your brother took the pictures.
dialog: You have to help.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Who even buys this shit?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Hey, Sam, watch your mouth, alright?
dialog: Don't disrespect your mother. You

dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Yeah, and you like having electricity
dialog: so that you can charge your cell
dialog: phone?
dialog: 128.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Nice nails.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah, some girl did that in sixth
dialog: period.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You planning on keeping them?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Until it comes off, I guess.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Last summer it was the earrings, and
dialog: now the nails. You got a, uh, you
dialog: got a purse to go with all that?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: A lot of guys do that. He's just
dialog: trying to be cool.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: When I was in high school, having a
dialog: job, being responsible, being able
dialog: to afford a car, that was cool.
speaker_heading: MOM

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Hey. How's it goin'?
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: Pretty good. How long have you been

speaker_heading: SHEENA

scene_heading: EXT. QUIET SPOT - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I just feel like there are so many
dialog: things that I could be doing and
dialog: probably want to be doing that I'm
dialog: just not.
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: Why aren't you?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I mean, I guess it's... just being
dialog: afraid of what people would think.
dialog: You know, judgment.
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: Yeah. I guess it's really easy to
dialog: say, like, I don't care what anyone
dialog: else thinks, but, everyone does, you
dialog: know? Deep down.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Exactly. I find myself so furious
dialog: at all these people that I'm in
dialog: contact with just for controlling me
dialog: or whatever, but you know, they're
text: not even aware they're doing it.
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: Yeah. So... in this perfect world
dialog: where no one's controlling you, what's
dialog: different? What changes?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Everything. I mean, I just wanna be
dialog: able to do anything I want, because
dialog: it makes me feel alive. As opposed
dialog: to giving me the appearance of
dialog: normality.
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: Whatever that means.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I don't think it means much.
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: You're kinda weird, you know that?

speaker_heading: MASON (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SHEENA

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I mean, I don't want to like... scare
dialog: kids at the park, or anything like
dialog: that.
text: Sheena laughs.
speaker_heading: MASON (CONT'D)
dialog: I really like talking with you. I
dialog: don't usually even try to like
dialog: vocalize my thoughts or feelings or
dialog: anything. Just, I don't know, it
dialog: just never sounds right. Words are
dialog: stupid.
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: So, why're you trying with me?

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I don't know. Awhile ago.
speaker_heading: JIM

dialog: 132.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: JIM

dialog: what's up?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I don't know what to tell you.

scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: You want one?
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Ugh. God --
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: (Laughing)
text: She didn't even touch them, seriously.
dialog: I watched her the whole time.

speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Yeah, I bet you did watch her, you
dialog: little pervert.
dialog: (Laughing)

speaker_heading: MASON

speaker_heading: APRIL

speaker_heading: APRIL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MR. WOOD
dialog: Mason! We are in the weeds out here!
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I'm goin' as fast as I can.
speaker_heading: MR. WOOD
dialog: Oh!
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 136.
speaker_heading: MR. WOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: Then I must be confused then, cause
dialog: I just saw you chattin it up with
dialog: April when I gotta salad bar that
dialog: needs a refill, I gotta six top, two
dialog: four tops I can't use, because they
dialog: haven't been bused.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Enrique is not here. I'm tryin'.
speaker_heading: MR. WOOD
dialog: Well, while you're tryin', we're
dialog: dyin'! What am I supposed to tell
dialog: my customers? "Oh, I'm sorry that
dialog: your table's got dirty plates on it,
dialog: but Mason's tryin'. Least that's
dialog: what he told me, after he was flirtin'
dialog: with April and eatin' your leftover
dialog: shrimp." Now it is a challenge out
dialog: there today, I know, but I wanna
dialog: share somethin' with you, I got you
dialog: pegged for fry cook this summer, now
dialog: that's a lot more responsibility.
dialog: It's also more money. How's that
dialog: sound?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: MR. WOOD
dialog: I know you can handle that money...
dialog: but can you take the responsibility?
dialog: I think you can, because I believe

speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah, she said I can stay at her
dialog: dorm, which is cool, and I guess her
dialog: roommate's out of town so it's no
dialog: big deal.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Alright, well, did you apply there
dialog: yet? Did you get that application
dialog: in to UT?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Not yet, but Sheena's pretty much
dialog: in, though.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yeah, right. Well, if you know that's
dialog: where you wanna go, you should
dialog: probably do that early acceptance

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: DAD

dialog: How's that goin'?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Uh, I don't know. It's, it's alright.
dialog: Today kind of sucked, this guy didn't
dialog: show up. But it's definitely an

dialog: People are slobs.
speaker_heading: DAD

scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY/ INT. TRUCK

text: passenger seat.
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: ... That sounds to me like just
dialog: another extreme Mason view of
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Not at all! I finally figured it
dialog: out. It's like when they realized
dialog: it was gonna be too expensive to
dialog: actually build cyborgs and robots...
dialog: I mean, the costs of that were
dialog: impossible. They decided to just
dialog: let humans turn themselves into
dialog: robots. That's what's going on right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: Oh, right now?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah! I mean, why not? There are
dialog: billions of us just laying around,
dialog: not really doing anything. We don't
dialog: cost anything. I mean we're even
dialog: pretty good at self-maintenance and
text: reproducing constantly. And as it
dialog: turns out, we're already biologically
dialog: programmed for our little cyborg
dialog: upgrades.
dialog: 141.
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Seriously. I read this thing other
dialog: day about how, like, when you hear
dialog: that ding on your inbox you get a,
text: like a dopamine rush in your brain.
dialog: It's like we're being chemically
dialog: rewarded for allowing ourselves to
dialog: be brainwashed. How evil is that?
dialog: We're fucked.
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: So you deleting your Facebook page
dialog: is gonna change all that? Remember
dialog: when Trevor deleted his Facebook
dialog: page last year and everyone just
dialog: hated him? You made more fun of him
dialog: than anyone.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I still make fun of Trevor, though.
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: But it looked like he was so
text: pathetically desperate for attention.
dialog: Or to be different, or something.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: That's just 'cause they did that
dialog: lame story about it in the school
dialog: paper.
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: And then he had to make a big
dialog: announcement about it when he came
dialog: back a month later.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: That's the thing though, I'm not
dialog: doing it for attention. I just want
dialog: to try and not live my life through
dialog: a screen. I want, like, some kind
dialog: of actual interaction. A real person,
dialog: not just the profile they put up.
text: Sheena's looking at her phone.
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry. Were you saying
dialog: something?
text: She laughs.
dialog: 142.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah, okay, I know you're joking,
dialog: but, I mean, it's kinda true you
dialog: have been, you know, checking your
dialog: phone this whole time, and so what
dialog: are you really doing? You don't
dialog: care what your friends are up to on
dialog: Saturday afternoon but you're also
dialog: obviously not fully experiencing my
dialog: profound bitching so... it's like
dialog: everyone's just stuck in, like, an
dialog: in-between state. Not really
dialog: experiencing anything.
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: It's not an experience, it's just
dialog: information. Look, for example, I
dialog: just got the address of the club
dialog: where we're meeting them later, so
dialog: we won't be wandering the streets of
dialog: Austin lost for an hour tonight.
dialog: Thank you very much, Facebook. And
dialog: I just texted my mom back.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Oh, that's -- that's groundbreaking.
dialog: She hasn't seen you in, like, 55
dialog: minutes?
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: Oh! Oh my god, most importantly,
dialog: Meg's family just got a miniature
text: pet pig.
text: Sheena hands him the phone.
speaker_heading: MASON

dialog: Hm!

speaker_heading: SHEENA

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

dialog: he'll figure it out, he's smart,

dialog: about living when you come here?
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: Um, I'm not really sure yet. We're
dialog: gonna look at apartments tomorrow,

dialog: expecting me to live in a dorm.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: Yeah. But I mean, I'm paying my way
dialog: through college, so it doesn't really
dialog: matter that much.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Yeah, you don't have to listen to
dialog: your parents after you turn eighteen.
dialog: I mean, especially if they're not
dialog: helping you financially.
text: They laugh.
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: That's what I figured.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: But I mean, living in a dorm isn't
dialog: so bad.
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 145.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I don't know, doesn't it all seem a

dialog: I just, I don't know, I'm not counting
dialog: on it being some big transformative
dialog: experience.
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: I don't think it's that
dialog: transformative. I just see it as
dialog: the next step.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: But it's like a pre-ordained slot
dialog: that's already got your name and
dialog: number on it. I don't think it's
dialog: the key to my future. Cause, like,
dialog: I mean, look at my mom. She got her

speaker_heading: SHEENA

dialog: It's great that you can think that
dialog: way. And you know, I'm sure dating

dialog: mind.
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: He's not a jock, okay? He just
text: happens to be on the lacrosse team.
dialog: We're all going to other schools
dialog: next year anyway, it's not some super
dialog: serious relationship.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Great. I feel so much better now.
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: We're just having fun.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I bet he's having fun.
speaker_heading: SHEENA
text: Grow up, Mason.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: It's not like I haven't been with

speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: What do you care?
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Does it matter?
speaker_heading: SHEENA
dialog: You're the one who brought it up.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: SHEENA (CONT'D)
dialog: This is pointless.

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: MASON

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh my god, thank you.
speaker_heading: MASON

speaker_heading: MASON

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: MASON

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Do you want to hurt her feelings?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Mm-mm.
dialog: (Shakes head slightly)
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Well then, let's go get 'em.
speaker_heading: NICK

dialog: Yeah, sure why not.
speaker_heading: MR. WOOD
dialog: (To Mason)
dialog: I got you something.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: MR. WOOD
dialog: That is a savings bond. That is

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah.

speaker_heading: MOM (CONT'D)

dialog: And you're going to learn so much in
dialog: college. You're going to have so
dialog: much fun. You're going to have

dialog: (to Dad)
dialog: Alright, you're up, kid.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Oh, uh... Alright, uh, well... Mason,
dialog: I'll make a toast to the future. To
dialog: your future. You know, it's been a
dialog: little sketchy this... end of the
dialog: school year here, trying to figure
dialog: out what school to go to. Mason
dialog: told me that, uh, he wanted...to get
text: as far away from home as possible.
dialog: But still honor our agreement that
dialog: we pay in-state tuition, which I do
dialog: appreciate. He's a prudent man, and
dialog: uh, he's going to have a great future.
dialog: So, here's to you buddy.
speaker_heading: GUESTS
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: Whoo! Future!
speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Alright, that's enough. Just ignore

dialog: pace himself.
speaker_heading: MR. WOOD
dialog: Well, I've not known you as long as
dialog: everybody here, but uh, since I have
dialog: known you, you've grown a lot. And
dialog: uh, I don't know, I'm proud of you.
dialog: So if this photography thing doesn't
dialog: work out, you know you always got a
dialog: job. Lose that earring. But, uh,
dialog: you know, maybe I can get you in
dialog: front of house. Alright, to you
dialog: buddy!

speaker_heading: MOM

speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah, yeah, just recently.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
dialog: What was her name?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Sheena.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR DOUGLAS

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, he's at home.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yeah, yeah. Remember, he was such a
dialog: pain at Sam's thing that, you know...
speaker_heading: GRANDMA
dialog: Oh, I would love to see him.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, we have a special weekend this
dialog: weekend, so...
speaker_heading: GRANDMA
dialog: I'm so glad you found her. I really
dialog: am.
dialog: (to Annie)
dialog: You, you've got him at a good time,

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I think so, too.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yeah, yeah we all are.

text: Later, Uncle Steve, Dad, and Mason have a manly discussion.
speaker_heading: UNCLE STEVE
dialog: You got to remember, you're going to
dialog: college, though, alright? And if
dialog: you're anything like me or your old
dialog: man, you're gonna be pulling down
dialog: some serious wool. You're gonna be
text: tapping some masterful gap.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Steven...
speaker_heading: UNCLE STEVE
dialog: You're gonna be doing some good work
dialog: out there. Think about it, awful
dialog: lot of flowers in that bouquet.
dialog: But, you gotta do me a favor. You're
dialog: going to be vulnerable this summer,
dialog: alright. Remember to use protection
dialog: during breakup sex.
text: He puts his hand on Dad.
speaker_heading: UNCLE STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: This guy knows exactly of which I
dialog: speak. Look what happened to him.
dialog: Viola'.
text: Uncle Steve gestures to Mason.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Steven...
speaker_heading: UNCLE STEVE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Cheers.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: It's not that simple.

speaker_heading: UNCLE STEVE

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - GRADUATION PARTY - CONTINUOUS
text: Later Dad enters the kitchen where Mom happens to be.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Do y'all recycle? Should I --
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I have one started there.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Oh, yeah, right. Okay, great. Okay.
dialog: Am I, uh, am I your only ex at this
dialog: party?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Yes, but I'm not your only wife here,
dialog: though.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Can you believe they're both out of
dialog: high school?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: No. No, I can't.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: You did a great job with both of
dialog: them, by the way.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Thanks for saying that. I never
dialog: thought I'd hear you say that.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Well, it's true. Thank you.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: And you're doing it all over again,
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I know, I know, right? It's gonna be
dialog: uh, fifteen years till I have an
dialog: empty nest. But hey, I'd love to
dialog: pitch in, help with this, if I could.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 165.
speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, it's so great that you did
dialog: this. I was just going to give you
dialog: a little. I'd appreciate it if I
dialog: could.
text: He pulls out his wallet.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Sure. Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yeah. But I don't have any cash.
dialog: It's in Annie's purse. I'll be right
dialog: back.
scene_heading: INT. ANTONE'S - EVENING
text: Mason and Dad are wandering through the green room area while
text: the band is doing a sound check.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: ...So it sucks. I mean, the guy's a
dialog: college lacrosse player. I mean,
dialog: what are you gonna do?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: She didn't even like sports.
text: An iced-down bucket of drinks beckons.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: You want a beer?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: No, that's alright.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: You can have one.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: It's okay.
text: They continue their conversation out of the green room to a
text: little area overlooking the stage.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yeah, well, for what it's worth,
dialog: we've all been through the exact
dialog: same thing, at one point or another.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: It's not the same, though. I mean,
dialog: you never got to know her.
dialog: 166.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: No, I know, I know. It's not the
dialog: same.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I just don't know what I did wrong.
text: At this point Dad yells down to Jimmy, his roommate from
text: years before, briefly interrupting the sound check.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Hey, Jimmy. Hey, man. Hey --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Hey, Mason.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: We're up here raiding the green room.
dialog: Hope that's okay.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: That's totally cool.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Alright.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Wow! Is that M.J.?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Uh-huh. Right?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Unbelievable.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Well, we just decided to come a little
dialog: early, check you out.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: That's cool man, let me finish up,
dialog: I'll be up in a minute.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Alright, alright.
text: He and Mason slowly start to drift around the venue.
speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: (back to Mason)
dialog: I guarantee you, you didn't do
dialog: anything wrong. These high school
dialog: love things, they never work out.
dialog: Here, come here.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 167.
speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, everyone's just changing so
dialog: much. The odds of two young people
dialog: staying on the same wavelength are...
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah, but still --
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Look, and I also guarantee you that
dialog: every day of your life that you spend
text: crying over some silly girl is a
dialog: complete waste of time.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: She wasn't a silly girl, though. I
dialog: mean, she's a serious person. I
dialog: really thought we were --
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Here's the truth. Women are never
dialog: satisfied. Ok? They're always
dialog: looking to potentially trade up and
dialog: that's, I'm sorry to say, what I
dialog: think has happened to you my fine
text: feathered friend.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: What does that even mean?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: It means don't hand over the controls
dialog: to your self-esteem to Sheila.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Sheena.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Alright. It means you are responsible
dialog: for you, not your girlfriend, not
dialog: your mom, not me. You. And if you
dialog: truly take care of you, you will be
dialog: amazed at how much girls like Sheena
dialog: start lining up at your front door.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Great.
dialog: 168.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yeah, you know, you just gotta
dialog: separate yourself from the pack in
dialog: some way. Excel at something, you
dialog: know, and then you have your pick of
text: the litter when them front-running
text: hussies start sniffing around.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: So what you're saying is, I should
dialog: take up lacrosse.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Exactly. Or you could, you know,
dialog: start a band. Worked for me a long
dialog: time ago. I think it's still working
dialog: for Jimmy. Or you just keep taking
dialog: pictures.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: She hated the pictures I took of
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Alright. I'm sick to death of her,
dialog: okay? I only met her a few times
dialog: and yes she was cute, alright. But,
dialog: truth be told I always thought she
dialog: was a little bit, you know, a little
dialog: bit too square for you. Y'know, not
text: quite the same vibe.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: You really thought that?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: On some subtle, lower level. I mean,
dialog: uh, I wasn't surprised when it turned
dialog: out she was interested in some
dialog: knucklehead lacrosse player, okay?
dialog: I mean, bottom line is, it's all
dialog: timing with these things. Y'know.
dialog: I mean, uh, take your mom and me.
dialog: Y'know I think I probably turned
text: into the boring castrated guy she
dialog: wanted me to be fifteen or twenty
dialog: years ago, y'know? And man I'm not
dialog: saying she was wrong to be pissed.
dialog: I'm not, I'm just saying that, y'know,
dialog: she could have been a little more
dialog: patient... a little more forgiving.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Would've saved me that parade of
dialog: drunken assholes.
dialog: 169.
text: Dad gestures zipping his lip, saying nothing.
speaker_heading: MASON (CONT'D)
dialog: So what's the point?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Of what?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I don't know, any of this.
dialog: Everything.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Everything? What's the point? I
dialog: mean I sure as shit don't know. I
dialog: mean, but, neither does anybody else.
dialog: Okay, we're all just winging it, you
dialog: know? I mean the good news is you're
dialog: feeling stuff. You know? And you
dialog: got to hold onto that. You do. I
dialog: mean you get older and you don't
dialog: feel as much. You're skin gets
dialog: tougher. The point is those pictures
dialog: you took. Thousands of submissions
dialog: from all over the state and you won.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Well, I got silver. And nine other
dialog: people did, too.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I'm gonna kill you. I'm tryin' to
dialog: tell you that I believe in you,
dialog: Mason. I think you're really special,
dialog: and if some girl doesn't see that,
dialog: then fuck her, y'know?
text: Jimmy's at the mic.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, this next one goes out to a
text: young man in the house --
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Woo-oho!
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Known him since he was just a small
dialog: boy, now he's all graduated from
dialog: high school, making me feel old.
text: Happy high school graduation, Mason.

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Thank you. Okay guys, let's be clear.
dialog: I'm going to break this into four

dialog: keep from your childhood and your
dialog: taking with you. Two. Throwing
text: away. Three. Donating. Four.
dialog: Whatever you wanna try to sell at

dialog: we don't sell, we're donating.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Doesn't the apartment have like an
dialog: attic, or storage or something?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: No. You're missing the point. We're
dialog: not going to drag a bunch of crap to
text: mom's tiny apartment.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Can't believe we're moving again.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: No, I'm moving! You moved two years
dialog: ago. You have an apartment in Austin.
dialog: Mason is moving the fall. I'm done.
dialog: This will be great for me. I'll
dialog: have all these options. I could
dialog: take a sabbatical. I could get some
dialog: writing done and try to get published.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: What about Christmas, though? What
dialog: are we gonna do?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: I'm not sharing a room with him.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: One of you will sleep on the couch,
dialog: and we'll use that blow-up mattress.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: How am I supposed to do my laundry?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Sam, I'm gently pushing you out of
dialog: the nest.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 171.
speaker_heading: MOM (CONT'D)
dialog: And on your way down you may magically
dialog: find some quarters that you use to
dialog: do laundry in your own apartment.
dialog: Come on! You guys are adults. You
dialog: need to take some responsibility!
dialog: And what do you want?
text: Mom puts her glasses on.
speaker_heading: MASON

speaker_heading: MASON
text: She's pregnant.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

dialog: No. To be honest, I drank way too
dialog: much last night.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: You weren't driving, were you?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
text: No. No. Carrie's back home, too,

speaker_heading: MOM

speaker_heading: ERNESTO
dialog: Believe it or not, you changed my

dialog: go to school. I took your advice!
dialog: I signed up for English classes and
dialog: then a year later I went to community
dialog: college and I got my associates
dialog: degree. And I'm working on my
dialog: bachelors now at Texas State. And
dialog: I'm also one of the managers here.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: That's great.
speaker_heading: ERNESTO
dialog: Uh, it's good to see you. Because I
dialog: really wanted a chance to thank you
dialog: for that. Gracias. It really meant
dialog: a lot to me. Don't worry about lunch.
dialog: It's on me. It's the least I can
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: ERNESTO
dialog: You guys should listen to her. She's
dialog: a smart lady.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Thank you.

scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT - MORNING
text: Mason, now with a scruffy beard, is wedging a duffel bag and
text: bin into the bed of his truck. He walks back toward Mom's
dialog: new apartment.
dialog: 173.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT - MORNING
text: Mason is packing a box, in mid-conversation with Mom, who is
text: seated in another room.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: ...Isn't that kind of crazy though,
dialog: that a computer knows who you are
dialog: from just twenty questions off a
dialog: form? I guess there are really only
dialog: like eight types of people in the
dialog: world.
text: Mom goes to the kitchen and pours coffee into a mug.
speaker_heading: MASON (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean there are subsets, like male
dialog: and female, but apparently we're not
dialog: as unique as we want to think we
dialog: are.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Have you even talked to this guy
dialog: yet?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: No, but we've been trading emails.
text: He seems pretty cool. He's studying
dialog: literature, and uh, anthropology,
dialog: and he's way into Bright Eyes... so
dialog: that's not so bad. But anyways, he
dialog: was telling me about how the system
dialog: they use for assigning roommates is
dialog: kind of spooky. Like, the Freshmen
dialog: satisfaction rate for new roommates
dialog: used to be like 60%, and now it's
dialog: 100%. Just cause of the computer.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Well. Sounds like he'll be a good
dialog: roommate, then.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah. But we've pretty much decided
dialog: that soon they won't even need a
dialog: questionnaire. Because they'll just
dialog: let the NSA scan your digital ghost,
dialog: and they'll tell you who your roommate
dialog: is, based on everything you've ever
dialog: said, written, or clicked.
text: Mason walks back into the living room, carrying a box. He
text: holds up a framed picture.
dialog: 174.
speaker_heading: MASON (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you -- Did you put this in here
dialog: again?
text: Mom laughs.
speaker_heading: MASON (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't want it.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Come on, it's the first picture you
dialog: ever took.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Well, I mean, all the more reason to
dialog: leave it behind, right?
text: Mason goes to put the picture back in his room, while Mom
text: suddenly breaks into quiet sobs.
text: He comes back out, wearing a backpack, and notices Mom crying.
speaker_heading: MASON (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: (crying)
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: No, what is it?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Nothing!
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Mom...
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: This is the worst day of my life.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I knew this day was coming. I just --
dialog: I didn't know you were gonna be so
dialog: fuckin' happy to be leaving.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I mean, it's not that I'm that happy.
dialog: What do you, what do you expect?
dialog: 175.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: You know what I'm realizing? My
dialog: life is just gonna go, like that!
dialog: This series of milestones. Getting
dialog: married, having kids, getting
dialog: divorced, the time that we thought
dialog: you were dyslexic, when I taught you
dialog: how to ride a bike, getting divorced
dialog: AGAIN, getting my masters degree,
dialog: finally getting the job I wanted,
dialog: sending Samantha off to college,
dialog: sending YOU off the college... You
dialog: know what's next? Huh? It's my
dialog: fuckin' funeral!
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: MOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Just go, and leave my picture!
text: Stunned, Mason doesn't know what to say.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Aren't you jumping ahead by like,
dialog: forty years or something?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I just thought there would be more.
text: Mom sits at the table crying. Mason does not know how to
dialog: comfort her.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: Mason drives his pick-up truck through the open roads and
dialog: mountains of West Texas.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
text: Mason stops at a gas station to fill up. While he waits, he
text: takes pictures.
scene_heading: EXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY
text: Mason pulls into the parking lot of his University and parks.
scene_heading: INT. DORM - AFTERNOON
text: Mason walks through a hallway area and finds his dorm room.
text: He enters to find it half decorated with music going. He
text: throws his bag up on the available bed and starts to unpack
text: and get situated. DALTON enters.
speaker_heading: DALTON
dialog: Hey, you must be Mason.
dialog: 176.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah. Dalton, right?
speaker_heading: DALTON
dialog: Yeah, man, it's nice to finally meet
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Definitely.
speaker_heading: DALTON
dialog: Are you cool with this side of the
dialog: room?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DALTON
dialog: Got in this morning, just moved my
dialog: shit in, man.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Well, yeah. I don't- I don't care.
dialog: No worries.
text: He unzips his bag, but keeps the conversation going.
speaker_heading: DALTON
dialog: Cool. Can I help with anything,
dialog: man? Any bags? Any last stuff you
dialog: need brought in?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: I just got like one... box left, I
dialog: packed pretty light. But I appreciate
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: DALTON
dialog: My pleasure, man. Of course.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Um, are you goin' to the orientation
dialog: mixer thing?
speaker_heading: DALTON
dialog: Orientation mixer thing? Fuck no,
dialog: man! I'm not goin' to that and
dialog: neither are you, by the way. We got
dialog: way better stuff to be doin', dude.
text: BARB, Dalton's girlfriend, drifts into the room.
speaker_heading: BARB
dialog: You ready?
dialog: 177.
speaker_heading: DALTON
dialog: Yeah. Hey, Barb, this' my roommate
dialog: Mason. Mason, Barb.
text: They shake.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: BARB
dialog: Hey. You comin' with us?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Where're you going?
speaker_heading: BARB
dialog: Hiking.
speaker_heading: DALTON
dialog: Yeah, man, you should come. If we
dialog: leave now we can catch the late
dialog: afternoon at Big Bend. You ever
dialog: been before, man?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah. But not since I was really
dialog: little.
speaker_heading: DALTON
dialog: Oh, well then all the more reason to
dialog: come now, man. That's why we're
dialog: here, dude.
text: Barb's roommate, NICOLE, is now hanging out by the door.
speaker_heading: DALTON (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, Mason. This is Nicole, Barb's
dialog: roommate.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Hey, what's up?
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Hi.
text: Barb is reaching in her bag for something.
speaker_heading: DALTON
dialog: Mason, Nicole.
speaker_heading: BARB
dialog: (to Mason)
dialog: So, you game?
dialog: 178.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Sure.
text: She has produced a chunk of brownie that she hands to Mason.
speaker_heading: BARB
dialog: Here. Have the rest of this. Got
dialog: it timed perfectly. It'll kick in
dialog: when we get to the mountains.
text: Mason takes it, a little amused, looks at the others
text: (confirmation), then starts to consume.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Awesome.
speaker_heading: DALTON (O.S.)
dialog: Let's go.
text: They roll out of there.
scene_heading: EXT. BIG BEND - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Mason, Nicole, Dalton and Barb hike through a BIG canyon.
text: Nicole talks to Mason about teaching dance.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Do they let you major in that here?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Well, it's not that serious here, so
dialog: I kinda like train outside the
dialog: university, but I'm taking all my
dialog: basics like History of Dance and all
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Nice.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: What do you teach?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Oh, gosh. Ballet, tap, jazz, lyrical,
dialog: hip-hop...
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Wow. Which one's your favorite?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Tap.
dialog: 179.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Yeah. You can make up all your own
dialog: sounds and there's no rules.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Right...
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Just, like, creative freedom.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: That's great.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: ... So to be a part of bringing it
dialog: back to the kids...
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Right, keep it going.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: ... Is really rewarding. Yeah.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: How old are they?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Six to eight.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Yeah. They have like no fear, and
text: they're not self-conscious at all.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: They haven't reached the awkward
dialog: years yet.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Yeah, not yet. It's coming.
dialog: 180.
text: The group continues walking over a ridge as the sun is
dialog: setting.
scene_heading: EXT. HIKE - LATER
text: As Barb and Dalton coyote call on the rocks, Mason joins
text: Nicole sitting on a rock overlooking the river and sunset.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Hey.
text: Dalton and Barb continue like coyotes, much to Nicole and
text: Mason's amusement.
speaker_heading: NICOLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Dalton can be crazy sometimes.
speaker_heading: MASON
text: He seems cool, though.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Yeah. Yeah, they're both really
dialog: cool. How are you feeling?
text: They both laugh.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Great. Really great, to be honest.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Good. I'm really happy that you're
dialog: hangin' out with us.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah. Me too.
text: Meanwhile, over on a big rock, the coyotes are now yelling
dialog: words.
speaker_heading: DALTON (O.S.)
dialog: This moment's having a multiple
dialog: orgasm! It's like as if all of time
dialog: has unfolded before us so we can
dialog: stand here and look out and scream -
dialog: Fuck yea!! Wooo!
text: Back with Nicole and Mason laughing.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: You know how everyone's always saying,
dialog: "Seize the moment"?
text: Mason nods yes.
dialog: 181.
speaker_heading: NICOLE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know, I'm kinda thinkin'
dialog: it's the other way around. You know,
text: like, the moment seizes us.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Yeah. Yeah, I know. It's constant,
dialog: the moments, it's just... it's like
dialog: always right now, you know?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Yeah.
text: They trade smiles.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
dialog:
