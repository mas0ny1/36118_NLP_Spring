dialog: when...
text: MARTIN RIGGS STEPS INTO FRAME
text: He looks up at the underbelly of the jet. So low that

dialog: to be in any shape to count anything.
text: Unshaven. Hair matted, A grease-stained baseball cap
text: pulled down low to keep the sun out of his blood~-shot

text: Peter's eyes dart furtively behind his black-out shades.
text: Karl SHUTS the Mercedes trunk lid. Hans picks up two
text: of the suitcases and takes a step toward the Gulfstream
text: -- then stops abruptly.
text: Why? Because a drunk is weaving towards them.
text: Riggs rolls his eyes. Takes another hit from the bottle
text: in the brown paper sack, Licks his lips. Stumbles.
text: Regains his balance. Advances toward the men.
text: The South Africans exchange a look, then Hans moves
text: forward to intercept Riggs.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Hey, buddy. Where you going?
speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: (speech slurred)
dialog: Anybody seen a dog? Lookin' for
dialog: my dog. Ran off and got lost.
dialog: Maybe you seen him? A brown dog?
dialog: Four legs... one tail. Face
dialog: like this -~
text: Riggs contorts his face into a weird expression.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Come on, pal. No dog around here.
text: Hans clamps his hand down firmly on Riggs' shoulder.
text: Riggs sways from side to side and gives Hans a bleary-eyed
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: I just gotta find that dog. Know
dialog: what I mean? He's a good dog.
text: Hans spins Riggs around, points him in the opposite
text: direction and gives him a shove.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Go sleep it off somewhere.
text: Riggs takes several wobbly steps, then stops -- bends
text: at the waist -- appears to PUKE his guts out. Hans
text: grimaces. And that's when...
text: A FORD BRONCO ROARS INTO THE SCENE
text: Brakes SQUEALING as it skids up to the Guifstream.
text: The South Africans turn to look -- knowing instantly
dialog: that something has gone very wrong for them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: The suitcases! Grab the suitcases!
text: CAMERA PUSHES IN ON RIGGS' BACK
text: as Riggs straightens up and spins around . . . eyes
text: clear and alive; wider than hell -~ nostrils flaring
text: ~~ arm extended, gripping a silver NINE MILLIMETER BERETTA
dialog: that flashes in the midday sun. This is one very dangerous,
dialog: and very sober cop we have here.
speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: (screaming)
text: POLICE! FREEZE! HANDS ON THE CAR!
text: LEGS SPREAD APART! NOW!
scene_heading: AN UNMARKED POLICE SEDAN
text: SKIDS up from another direction. ROGER MURTAUGH leaps

speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: You're late! I had to do my lost dog
dialog: routine and my puke routine!
speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
dialog: You didn't give me the signal!
speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: I gave you the signal! -~ Jingle bell rock!
speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
dialog: The signal was Jingle bell roll!
text: Riggs sticks a hand under his shirt with a disgusted
text: expression and YANKS out the WIRE he's been wearing.
speaker_heading: THREE COPS
text: have jumped from the Ford Bronco with service revolvers
text: drawn. They wear jeans and distinctive satin jackets
scene_heading: that have "L.A.P.D DRUG ENFORCEMENT" lettered on the
dialog: back. We'll see these guys again. Their names are:
scene_heading: TIM CAVANAUGH, GARY PRICE and TOM WYLER.
text: They rush toward the flummoxed South Africans ...
dialog: but here's something they didn't count on:
scene_heading: THE GULPSTREAM PILOT
text: appears in the cabin doorway brandishing an UZI SUBMACHINE
text: GUN. A rapid BURST OF FIRE scatters the Drug Cops.
text: They dive behind the Bronco for cover.
speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
dialog: Oh, shit!
dialog: Now things happen fast ~~
text: Riggs ROLLS beneath the Gulfstream, behind the landing
dialog: gear.
text: Murtaugh DROPS down behind his Sedan, FIRING off several
speaker_heading: ROUNDS.
text: Hans grabs a suitcase, RUNS up the boarding steps and
text: disappears into the Gulfstream.
text: The other South Africans produce weapons from beneath
text: their coats and BLAST their way back into the Mercedes.
text: The Drug Cops are pinned down by UZI GUNFIRE. Murtaugh
text: tries to nail the Pilot -~- but only succeeds in drawing
text: his fire. The Pilot SPRAYS THE UZI in Murtaugh's direction.
text: Murtaugh ducks behind his Sedan as bullets RIP THROUGH
text: the car's HOOD and GRILL.
speaker_heading: RIGGS
text: crouches low under the Gulfstream's fuselage, working
text: his way toward the front. The REVVING ENGINES are HOT
text: and NOISEY.
text: Now Riggs is directly beneath the boarding staircase.
text: The spent shell casings from the Uzi Submachine gun
text: (CHATTERING directly OVERHEAD) dance on the tarmac all
text: around him.
text: Riggs grabs hold of the staircase and makes his move
text: . . . fast, and with the agility of a cat, he SWINGS
text: out from beneath the airplane ~- pulling himself upward
text: -- face to face with the startled Pilot ~- BERRETA OUT
text: ~~ fire EXPLODING from its mugzel at point blank range.
text: The Pilot is blasted backwards into the Gulfstream,
text: -- the Uzi SPRAYING BULLETS through the roof of the
text: fuselage as he falis.
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT OF GULFSTREAM
text: Bans panics. He doesn't know how to fly a plane, but
text: he wants to get the hell away . . . so he PUSHES FORWARD
text: on the THROTTLE just enough to put the plane INTO MOTION.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE GULFSTREAM
text: Riggs is on the staircase when the plane begins to TAXI
text: FORWARD. The staircase TEARS AWAY from the Gulfstream's
text: fuselage SPILLING Riggs to the ground.
dialog: 
text: Riggs TUMBLES beneath the wing, where -- flat on his
text: back -- he sees the LANDING GEAR ROLLING TOWARDS HIM!
speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: Oooohhhhhh -- {
text: He rolls out of harm's way -- the landing gear coming
text: within inches of crushing him. But now Riggs must
text: contend with the SEARING HEAT expelled from the Turbofan
text: Jet Engine as it passes over him.
text: THE LEADING EDGE OF THE GULFSTREAM'S WING
text: SHEERS off the roof of the Ford Bronco as it passes
dialog: by. Meanwhile...
speaker_heading: THE MERCEDES
text: SQUEALS away in cloud of exhaust smoke. But in their
text: hurry to escape with their lives, the South Africans
text: have forgotten about the TWO SUITCASES resting on the
text: tarmac. The Mercedes PLOWS into them, sending them
text: flying. One of them OPENS . . . and BUNDLES of U.S.
text: CURRENCY spill out.
speaker_heading: RIGGS
text: gets to his feet. Murtuagh rushes up to him.
text: The Glufstream is rolling off in one direction, and
text: the Mercedes has driven off in the other.
speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: (pointing at Gulfstream)
dialog: That one is mine! You take the Benz!
text: Riggs doesn't even wait for Murtaugh's reply. He just
text: RUNS OFF after the Gulfstream.
text: Murtaugh and the Drug Cops jump into the DECAPITATED
text: BRONCO and speed away.
scene_heading: THE MERCEDES LIMO
text: races across the perimeter of the landing field. The
text: Bronco chasing after it.
speaker_heading: RIGGS
text: chases the moving Gulfstream on foot -- running like
text: a gazelle. He catches up to it -~ LEAPS onto the wing
text: from behind and holds on tight. He works his way over
text: the wing toward the OPENING IN THE FUSELAGE where the
dialog: door used to be.
speaker_heading: THE BRONCO
text: overtakes the Mercedes. Now they're side-by-side.
text: GUNFIRE is exchanged out the windows of the two vehicles.

text: Brenco sticks to it like glue.
speaker_heading: RIGGS
text: is on the wing of the Gulfstream, He tries to SWING
text: INTO THE DOORWAY. His foot SLIPS. He aimost falls

text: Riggs PULLS himself up into the airplane.
scene_heading: INT, COCKFIT OF GULSTREAM

scene_heading: EXT, RUNWAY AND INFIELD

text: toward the TERMINAL AREA. The Bronco right on its tail.
text: They reach the AIRPORT APRON. This is where the planes

dialog: in the area. Such as...
text: A BAGGAGE TRAIN that crosses the Mercedes' path. No
dialog: time to aveid it ~- CRASH! -- the Mercedes RAMS it!
text: SPLITS it apart! Travels directly through it. Luggage
text: scattered everywhere.
text: The Bronce follows -- destroying the luggage even further
text: -- dragging articles of clothing from its bumper.
dialog: Suddenly ...
text: A BOEING 727 that is being BACKED AWAY from the gate
text: looms up iz front of the Mercedes. The Mercedes BRAKES

text: When pushed the wrong way they LOCK and an ALARM SOUNDS.
dialog: And that's what happens to Karl,

text: The pavement is whizzing by only inches below him.
text: He's totally unprotected -- a head~on collision would

text: as the Truck crosses the center line directly inte the
