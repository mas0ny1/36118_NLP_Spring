scene_heading: EXT. BATTLEFIELD, JENKINS' FERRY, ARKANSAS - DAY
dialog: 
text: Heavy grey skies hang over a flooded field, the water two
text: feet deep. Cannons and carts, half-submerged and tilted,
text: their wheels trapped in the mud below the surface, are still
text: yoked to dead and dying horses and oxen.
dialog: 
text: A terrible battle is taking place; two infantry companies,
dialog: Negro Union soldiers and white Confederate soldiers, knee-
text: deep in the water, staggering because of the mud beneath,
text: fight each other hand-to-hand, with rifles, bayonets,
text: pistols, knives and fists. There's no discipline or strategy,
dialog: nothing depersonalized: it's mayhem and each side intensely
text: hates the other. Both have resolved to take no prisoners.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROLD GREEN (V.O.)
dialog: Some of us was in the Second Kansas
dialog: Colored. We fought the rebs at
dialog: Jenkins' Ferry last April, just
dialog: after they'd killed every Negro
dialog: soldier they captured at Poison
dialog: Springs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: EXT. PARADE GROUNDS ADJACENT TO THE WASHINGTON NAVY YARD,
scene_heading: ANACOSTIA RIVER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Rain and fog. Union Army companies are camped out across the
dialog: grounds. Preparations are being made for the impending
dialog: assault on the Confederate port of Wilmington, North
dialog: Carolina.
dialog: 
text: Two black soldiers stand before a bivouacked Negro unit:
text: HAROLD GREEN, an infantryman in his late thirties, and IRA
text: CLARK, a cavalryman in his early twenties. ABRAHAM LINCOLN
text: sits on a bench facing Harold and Ira; his stovepipe hat is
text: at his side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROLD GREEN
dialog: So at Jenkins' Ferry, we decided
dialog: warn't taking no reb prisoners.
dialog: And we didn't leave a one of `em
dialog: alive. The ones of us that didn't
dialog: die that day, we joined up with the
dialog: 116th U.S. Colored, sir. From Camp
dialog: Nelson Kentucky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: What's your name, soldier?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROLD GREEN
dialog: Private Harold Green, sir.
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRA CLARK
dialog: I'm Corporal Ira Clark, sir. Fifth
dialog: Massachusetts Cavalry. We're
text: waiting over there.
dialog: 
text: He nods in the direction of his cavalry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRA CLARK (CONT'D)
dialog: We're leaving our horses behind,
dialog: and shipping out with the 24th
dialog: Infantry for the assault next week
dialog: on Wilmington.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: (to Harold Green:)
dialog: How long've you been a soldier?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROLD GREEN
dialog: Two year, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: Second Kansas Colored Infantry,
dialog: they fought bravely at Jenkins'
dialog: Ferry.
dialog: 
scene_heading: HAROLD GREEN IRA CLARK
dialog: That's right, sir. They killed a thousand rebel
dialog: soldiers, sir. They were very
dialog: brave.
dialog: (hesitating, then)
dialog: And making three dollars less
dialog: each month than white
dialog: soldiers.
dialog: 
text: Harold Green is a little startled at Clark's bluntness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROLD GREEN
dialog: Us 2nd Kansas boys, whenever we
dialog: fight now we -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRA CLARK
dialog: Another three dollars subtracted
dialog: from our pay for our uniforms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROLD GREEN
dialog: That was true, yessir, but that
speaker_heading: CHANGED -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRA CLARK
dialog: Equal pay now. Still no
dialog: commissioned Negro officers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: I am aware of it, Corporal Clark.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRA CLARK
dialog: Yes, sir, that's good you're aware,
dialog: sir. It's only that -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROLD GREEN
dialog: (to Lincoln, trying to
dialog: change the subject:)
dialog: You think the Wilmington attack is
dialog: gonna be -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRA CLARK
dialog: Now that white people have
dialog: accustomed themselves to seeing
text: Negro men with guns, fighting on
dialog: their behalf, and now that they can
dialog: tolerate Negro soldiers getting the
dialog: same pay - in a few years perhaps
dialog: they can abide the idea of Negro
dialog: lieutenants and captains. In fifty
dialog: years, maybe a Negro colonel. In a
dialog: hundred years - the vote.
dialog: 
text: Green's offended at the way Clark is talking to Lincoln.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: What'll you do after the war,
dialog: Corporal Clark?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRA CLARK
dialog: Work, sir. Perhaps you'll hire me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: Perhaps I will.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRA CLARK
dialog: But you should know, sir, that I
text: get sick at the smell of bootblack
dialog: and I can't cut hair.
dialog: 
text: Lincoln smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: I've yet to find a man could cut
dialog: mine so it'd make any difference.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROLD GREEN
dialog: You got springy hair for a white
dialog: man.
dialog: 
text: Lincoln laughs.
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: Yes, I do. My last barber hanged
dialog: himself. And the one before that.
dialog: Left me his scissors in his will.
dialog: 
text: Green laughs.
dialog: 
text: TWO WHITE SOLDIERS have come up, two young kids, nervous and
text: excited.

scene_heading: FIRST WHITE SOLDIER LINCOLN

dialog: 
scene_heading: SECOND WHITE SOLDIER

scene_heading: FIRST WHITE SOLDIER

speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: Could you hear what I said?

scene_heading: FIRST WHITE SOLDIER
dialog: No, sir, not much, it was-

scene_heading: SECOND WHITE SOLDIER
text: (he recites, fast and
speaker_heading: MECHANICALLY:)
dialog: "Four score and seven years ago,
dialog: our fathers brought forth on this

dialog: in liberty and dedicated to the
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: proposition that all men are
dialog: created equal."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: That's good, thank you for -
dialog: 
scene_heading: FIRST WHITE SOLDIER
dialog: "Now we are engaged in a great
dialog: civil war, testing whether that
dialog: nation or any nation so conceived
dialog: and so dedicated can long endure.

speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: Thank you, that's -

scene_heading: SECOND WHITE SOLDIER
dialog: "We have come to dedicate a portion
dialog: of that field as a final resting

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: SECOND WHITE SOLDIER A VOICE (O.C.)
dialog: I know the last part. "It is, Company up! Move it out!
dialog: uh, it is rather -"
dialog: 
text: Soldiers all over the field rise up at the mustering of the
dialog: troops. Names of regiments, brigades, divisions are called:
text: all across the field, the men put out fires, put on
text: knapsacks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: (to the two white
speaker_heading: SOLDIERS:)
dialog: You fellas best find your company.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FIRST WHITE SOLDIER
speaker_heading: (SALUTING LINCOLN:)
dialog: Thank you, sir. God bless you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: God bless you.
dialog: 
text: The second white soldier salutes, and the two move out.
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Green salutes Lincoln as well and glances at Clark, who
text: remains, looking down. Green leaves. Clark looks up, salutes
text: Lincoln and, turning smartly, walks toward his unit.
dialog: 
text: Then he stops, turns back, faces Lincoln, who watches him. A
text: beat, and then, in a tone of admiration and cautious
text: admonishment, reminding Lincoln of his promise:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRA CLARK
dialog: "That we here highly resolve that
dialog: these dead shall not have died in
dialog: VAIN -- "
dialog: 
text: Clark salutes Lincoln again, turns again and walks away.
text: Lincoln watches him go. As he walks into the fog, Clark
text: continues reciting in a powerful voice:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRA CLARK (CONT'D)
dialog: " - That this nation, under God,
dialog: shall have a new birth of freedom --
dialog: and that government of the people,
dialog: by the people, for the people,
dialog: shall not perish from the earth."
dialog: 
text: Lincoln watches Clark until the fog's swallowed him up.

scene_heading: EXT. A SHIP AT SEA - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A huge, dark, strange-looking steamship, part wood and part
text: iron, turreted like a giant ironclad monitor, is plowing
text: through the choppy black waters of an open sea.
dialog: 
text: Lincoln is alone, in darkness, on the deck, which has no
text: railing, open to the sea. The ship's tearing through rough
text: water, but there's little pitching, wind or spray. The deck
text: is dominated by the immense black gunnery turret.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN (V.O.)
text: It's nighttime. The ship's moved
dialog: by some terrible power, at a
dialog: terrific speed.
dialog: 
text: Lincoln stares out towards a barely discernible horizon,
text: indicated by a weird, flickering, leaden glow, which appears
text: to recede faster than the fast-approaching ship.
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN (V.O.)
text: Though it's imperceptible in the
dialog: darkness, I have an intuition that

scene_heading: INT. MARY'S BOUDOIR, SECOND FLOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The room's cozy, attractive, cluttered, part dressmaker's
text: workshop, part repository of Mary's endless purchases:
text: clothing, fabrics, knicknacks, carpets. Books everywhere.
dialog: 
text: Lincoln reclines on a French chair, too small for his lengthy
text: frame. He's in shirtsleeves, vest unbuttoned and tie
text: unknotted, shoeless. He has an open folio filled with
text: documents on his lap.
dialog: 
text: MARY LINCOLN sits opposite, in a nightgown, housecoat and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN (CONT'D)
dialog: I should spare you. I shouldn't

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I don't want to be spared if you

text: He looks down at the carpet, then back up at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)

dialog: Beyond description.

speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
text: Almost two years, nothing mends.
dialog: Another casualty of the war. Who

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: I do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Stuff! You tell me dreams, that's
dialog: all, I'm your soothsayer, that's

dialog: 
text: Mary studies Lincoln, thinking. Then a revelation:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I know...I know what it's about.
dialog: The ship, it isn't Wilmington Port,
dialog: it's not a military campaign! It's
dialog: the amendment to abolish slavery!
dialog: Why else would you force me to
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: invite demented radicals into my

dialog: 
text: Lincoln closes his folio.

speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)

dialog: 
text: Seeing that he's not going to discuss this, she turns away,
text: walking to an open window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you remember Robert's coming
dialog: home for the reception?
dialog: 
text: Lincoln nods, though Mary isn't bothering to look at him.

speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: I knew you'd forget.

text: She closes the window.

speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: It's late, Mrs. Keckley.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ELIZABETH KECKLEY

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH KECKLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: It's slow work.
dialog: 
text: He nods, smiles, straightens up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: Good night.
dialog: 
text: He continues down the hall. Mrs. Keckley starts to enter
text: Mary's boudoir, then stops, sensing something amiss. She
dialog: calls quietly after Lincoln:
dialog: 
scene_heading: ELIZABETH KECKLEY
dialog: (concerned, a little
speaker_heading: EXASPERATED:)
dialog: Did you tell her a dream?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, SECOND FLOOR, WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A working room, sparsely furnished. Lincoln's desk is heaped
text: with files, books, newspapers. The desk's near a window, now
text: open. Comfortable chairs and a rocker are in a corner. Near
text: the fireplace, in which embers are dying, there's a long
text: table, eight chairs around it, settings by each chair of
text: inkwells and pens.
dialog: 
text: Dozens of maps cover the walls and the crowded bookcases.
dialog: 
text: Lincoln opens the door and enters to find his 10 year-old son
text: TAD LINCOLN near the hearth, sleeping, sprawled on a very
text: large military map. Lead toy soldiers are scattered across
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: A large mahogany box, imprinted ALEXANDER GARDNER STUDIOS,
text: is open near Tad's head. The box contains large glass plates,
text: each framed in wood; these are photographic negatives. Tad's
text: been looking at several, which lie near him on the map.
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Lincoln kneels by Tad and looks down at the map, a
dialog: topographical and strategic survey of the no-man's land
text: between Union and Confederate forces at Petersburg. He
text: scrutinizes the precisely drawn blue and grey lines.
dialog: 
text: He lifts one of the glass plates and holds it to the
text: firelight: it's a large photographic negative of a young
text: black boy. There's a caption, in elegant cursive script:
dialog: "Abner, age 12 - $500"
dialog: 
dialog: And another: "Two young boys, 10 &amp; 14 - $700"
dialog: 
text: Lincoln puts the plates back in the box and closes the lid.
text: Carefully brushing the toy soldiers aside, he lies down
text: beside Tad. He touches Tad's hair and kisses his forehead.
text: Tad stirs as Lincoln gets on all fours; without really waking
text: up, knowing the routine, Tad climbs onto his father's back.
text: Tad holds on as his father stands, weary, and maybe a little
text: surprised to find his growing son slightly heavier than he
dialog: was the night before.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAD
speaker_heading: (FAST ASLEEP:)
dialog: Papa...

text: audience of officials, clerks, dignitaries, wives, soldiers.
text: A Marine band finishes a jaunty instrumental rendition of "We
dialog: Are Coming Father Abra'am."
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Two soldiers fasten a flag to the halyards. Lincoln moves
text: into place; as the crowd applauds, he takes a sheet of paper
text: from inside his hat and glances at it. Then he looks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: The part assigned to me is to raise
dialog: the flag, which, if there be no
dialog: fault in the machinery, I will do,
dialog: and when up, it will be for the

dialog: 
text: He puts the paper away. The audience waits, expecting more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN (CONT'D)
dialog: That's my speech.
dialog: 
text: He smiles at them. They applaud, some laughing. As Lincoln
text: turns the crank, hoisting the flag, a solo trumpet plays "We
text: Are Coming Father Abra'am" and the audience joins in. Among
text: them, Secretary of State WILLIAM SEWARD, 64, in a thick,
text: exquisite winter coat and hat, and Lincoln's dapper assistant
text: secretary, JOHN HAY, 27. Seward looks pleased.

speaker_heading: SEWARD

scene_heading: MRS. JOLLY

scene_heading: MRS. JOLLY

speaker_heading: SEWARD
dialog: And is that why you favor it?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. JOLLY
dialog: What I favor's ending the war.
dialog: Once't we do away with slavery, the
dialog: rebs'll quit fighting, since
dialog: slavery's what they're fighting

dialog: so. With the amendment, slavery's

text: (he smacks a newspaper on
speaker_heading: THE TABLE)
dialog: - that the anti-slavery amendment
text: is being precipitated onto the
dialog: House floor for debate - because
dialog: your eagerness, in what seems an
dialog: unwarranted intrusion of the
dialog: Executive into Legislative
dialog: prerogatives, is compelling it to
dialog: it's... to what's likely to be its
dialog: premature demise? You signed the
dialog: Emancipation Proclamation, you've
dialog: done all that can be expected -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAMES SPEED
dialog: The Emancipation Proclamation's
dialog: merely a war measure. After the war
dialog: the courts'll make a meal of it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN USHER
dialog: When Edward Bates was Attorney
dialog: General, he felt confident in it
dialog: enough to allow you to sign -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAMES SPEED
speaker_heading: (A SHRUG:)
dialog: Different lawyers, different
dialog: opinions. It frees slaves as a
dialog: military exigent, not in any other -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: I don't recall Bates being any too
dialog: certain about the legality of my
dialog: Proclamation, just it wasn't
dialog: downright criminal. Somewhere's in
dialog: between. Back when I rode the legal
dialog: circuit in Illinois I defended a
dialog: woman from Metamora named Melissa
dialog: Goings, 77 years old, they said she
dialog: murdered her husband; he was 83. He
dialog: was choking her; and, uh, she
text: grabbed ahold of a stick of fire-
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: wood and fractured his skull, `n he
dialog: died. In his will he wrote "I
dialog: expect she has killed me. If I get
dialog: over it, I will have revenge."
dialog: 
text: This gets a laugh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN (CONT'D)
dialog: No one was keen to see her
dialog: convicted, he was that kind of
dialog: husband. I asked the prosecuting
dialog: attorney if I might have a short
dialog: conference with my client. And she
dialog: and I went into a room in the
dialog: courthouse, but I alone emerged.
text: The window in the room was found to
dialog: be wide open. It was believed the
dialog: old lady may have climbed out of
dialog: it. I told the bailiff right before
dialog: I left her in the room she asked me
dialog: where she could get a good drink of
dialog: water, and I told her Tennessee.
dialog: Mrs. Goings was seen no more in
dialog: Metamora. Enough justice had been
dialog: done; they even forgave the
text: bondsman her bail.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN USHER
dialog: I'm afraid I don't -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: I decided that the Constitution
dialog: gives me war powers, but no one
dialog: knows just exactly what those
dialog: powers are. Some say they don't
dialog: exist. I don't know. I decided I
dialog: needed them to exist to uphold my
dialog: oath to protect the Constitution,
dialog: which I decided meant that I could
dialog: take the rebels' slaves from `em as
dialog: property confiscated in war. That
dialog: might recommend to suspicion that I
dialog: agree with the rebs that their
dialog: slaves are property in the first
dialog: place. Of course I don't, never
dialog: have, I'm glad to see any man free,
dialog: and if calling a man property, or
dialog: war contraband, does the trick...
dialog: Why I caught at the opportunity.
dialog: Now here's where it gets truly
dialog: slippery. I use the law allowing
dialog: for the seizure of property in a
dialog: war knowing it applies only to the
dialog: property of governments and
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: citizens of belligerent nations.
dialog: But the South ain't a nation,
dialog: that's why I can't negotiate with
dialog: 'em. So if in fact the Negroes are
dialog: property according to law, have I
dialog: the right to take the rebels'
dialog: property from `em, if I insist
dialog: they're rebels only, and not
dialog: citizens of a belligerent country?
dialog: And slipperier still: I maintain it
dialog: ain't our actual Southern states in
dialog: rebellion, but only the rebels
dialog: living in those states, the laws of
dialog: which states remain in force. The
dialog: laws of which states remain in
dialog: force. That means, that since it's
dialog: states' laws that determine whether
dialog: Negroes can be sold as slaves, as
dialog: property - the Federal government
dialog: doesn't have a say in that, least
dialog: not yet -
dialog: (a glance at Seward,
speaker_heading: THEN:)
dialog: - then Negroes in those states are
dialog: slaves, hence property, hence my
dialog: war powers allow me to confiscate
dialog: `em as such. So I confiscated `em.
dialog: But if I'm a respecter of states'
dialog: laws, how then can I legally free
dialog: `em with my Proclamation, as I
dialog: done, unless I'm cancelling states'
dialog: laws? I felt the war demanded it;
dialog: my oath demanded it; I felt right
dialog: with myself; and I hoped it was
dialog: legal to do it, I'm hoping still.
dialog: 
text: He looks around the table. Everyone's listening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN (CONT'D)
dialog: Two years ago I proclaimed these
dialog: people emancipated - "then,
dialog: thenceforward and forever free."
dialog: But let's say the courts decide I
dialog: had no authority to do it. They
dialog: might well decide that. Say there's
dialog: no amendment abolishing slavery.
dialog: Say it's after the war, and I can
dialog: no longer use my war powers to just
dialog: ignore the courts' decisions, like
dialog: I sometimes felt I had to do. Might
dialog: those people I freed be ordered
dialog: back into slavery? That's why I'd
dialog: like to get the Thirteenth
dialog: Amendment through the House, and on
dialog: 28.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: its way to ratification by the
dialog: states, wrap the whole slavery
dialog: thing up, forever and aye. As soon
dialog: as I'm able. Now. End of this

dialog: always done.

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yes, thank you, it's true, the

dialog: invoices. But I had to! Four years
dialog: ago, when the President and I
dialog: arrived, this was pure pigsty.
text: Tobacco stains in the turkey
text: carpets. Mushrooms, green as the
text: moon, sprouting from ceilings! And
text: a pauper's pittance allotted for

dialog: joined with all of Washington
dialog: awaiting, in what you anticipated
dialog: would be our comfort in squalor,
dialog: further proof that my husband and I
dialog: were prairie primitives, unsuited
dialog: to the position to which an error

dialog: never love you the way they love
dialog: him. How difficult it must be for
dialog: you to know that. And yet how

scene_heading: THADDEUS STEVENS
dialog: When the war ends, I intend to push
dialog: for full equality, the Negro vote
dialog: and much more. Congress shall

dialog: fought long and hard for the good
dialog: of the people without caring much

dialog: worse without the wig. The people
dialog: elected me! To represent them! To

dialog: try it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: I admire your zeal, Mr. Stevens,
dialog: and I have tried to profit from the
dialog: example of it. But if I'd listened
dialog: to you, I'd've declared every slave
dialog: free the minute the first shell
dialog: struck Fort Sumter; then the border
dialog: states would've gone over to the
dialog: confederacy, the war would've been
dialog: lost and the Union along with it,
dialog: and instead of abolishing slavery,
dialog: as we hope to do, in two weeks,
dialog: we'd be watching helpless as
dialog: infants as it spread from the

dialog: Well, what did he think of its

dialog: appropriately located to Mr. Allen?
dialog: Mr. Allen said it did. His host was

dialog:

speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: "Lieutenant General Ulysses S.

speaker_heading: HOMER BATES
dialog: I must've in school, but...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: I never had much of schooling, but

dialog: its way in here -
dialog: (touching his cranium)
dialog: - but once learnt it stayed learnt.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Euclid's first common notion is

dialog: 
text: Homer doesn't get it; neither does Sam.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN (CONT'D)
dialog: That's a rule of mathematical

dialog: In his book, Euclid says this is
dialog: "self-evident."
speaker_heading: (A BEAT)
dialog: D'you see? There it is, even in
dialog: that two-thousand year old book of
dialog: mechanical law: it is a self-
dialog: evident truth that things which are
dialog: equal to the same thing are equal
dialog: to each other. We begin with
dialog: equality. That's the origin, isn't

dialog: 
text: Behind the building, where the ground is bare, pitted with

dialog: 
text: Robert watches as they toss the remains into the pit.
text: Quicklime is shoveled atop the limbs.
dialog: 
text: Robert walks away, unsteady.
dialog: 
text: Around the corner, he fumbles through his pockets for rolling
text: paper and tobacco. He locates these and tries to focus on
text: rolling a cigarette, his hands shaking. He tries harder to

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Slavery troubled me, as long as I

dialog: troubled my father, though he hated
dialog: it. In his own fashion. He knew no
dialog: smallholding dirt farmer could
dialog: compete with slave plantations. He
dialog: took us out from Kentucky to get
dialog: away from `em. He wanted Indiana
dialog: kept free. He wasn't a kind man,
dialog: but there was a rough moral urge
dialog: for fairness, for freedom in him. I

text: Lincoln flicks the reins of his horse, which starts down the
text: slope. The officers follow behind him. No one speaks.
dialog: 119.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Lincoln rides slowly, his focus on the ground before him.
text: Debris is scattered all around him, along with the bodies of
text: fallen soldiers.
dialog: 
text: He looks up and across the battlefield; a terrible battle has
dialog: concluded a couple of hours ago.
dialog: 
text: Looking down, as he rides, he sees soldiers killed by
text: artillery fire, whose bodies lie twisted, burned, headless,
text: limbless, torn in two, blown out of their clothing or charred
text: too badly to tell. He sees soldiers killed by rifle and
text: bayonet, whose corpses are intact.
dialog: 
text: At the beginning of his ride, all the dead and wounded are in
text: Union blue, the casualties of Confederate cannon fire, felled
text: as the Union army, about six hours earlier, began its final,
text: successful drive to break through Confederate lines.
dialog: 
text: As Lincoln and his escorts move across the battlefield, grey
text: and blue uniformed corpses and badly wounded men intermingle.
dialog: 
text: He reaches the other side of the field, passing a Confederate
text: flag to enter the now-ruined town of Petersburg.

scene_heading: EXT. THE THOMAS WALLACE HOUSE, GRANT'S TEMPORARY
scene_heading: HEADQUARTERS, ON MARKET STREET, PETERSBURG - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Grant, smoking his cigar, his uniform dusty and rumpled, is
text: sitting on the small porch. He stares piercingly at Lincoln,
text: in a rocker next to him, watching his troops pass by as they
text: move in to secure the conquered town. Lincoln closes his
dialog: eyes.
dialog: 
text: He has grown older, the skin around his eyes is cobwebbed
text: with fine creases, and his hair's thinner, softer, suffused
text: with grey. His brow has grown smoother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
text: Once he surrenders, send his boys
dialog: back to their homes, their farms,
dialog: their shops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: Yes sir, as we discussed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: Liberality all around. No
dialog: punishment. I don't want that. And
dialog: the leaders - Jeff and the rest of
dialog: `em - if they escape, leave the
dialog: country while my back's turned,
dialog: that wouldn't upset me none.
dialog: 120.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: When peace comes it mustn't just be
text: hangings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: By outward appearance, you're ten
dialog: years older than you were a year
dialog: ago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: Some weariness has bit at my bones.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I never seen the like of it before.
dialog: What I seen today. Never seen the
dialog: like of it before.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: You always knew that, what this was
text: going to be. Intimate, and ugly.
dialog: You must've needed to see it close
dialog: when you decided to come down here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: We've made it possible for one
dialog: another to do terrible things.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: And we've won the war. Now you have
dialog: to lead us out of it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE MCLEAN HOUSE, APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE, VIRGINIA -
speaker_heading: AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: OFFICERS OF THE CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMY stand around in
text: the afternoon sun. Everyone's solemn, even stunned by what's
text: just happened. No one is speaking.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TITLE: APPOMATTOX COURTHOUSE, VIRGINIA
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL 9, 1865
dialog: 
text: ROBERT E. LEE comes down the steps of the McLean house, as a
text: CONFEDERATE OFFICER brings his horse to him. His face is
text: blank. Lee mounts his waiting horse.
dialog: 
text: Lee should leave, having just surrendered to Grant inside;
text: but he's immobile. Some of the officers of both sides look at
text: Lee, some can't bear it. Lee tries out various expressions:
text: pride, defiance, blankness.
dialog: 
text: Grant stomps onto the porch of the house, followed by his
text: staff. Among them is Robert Lincoln.
dialog: 121.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Grant, lost in thought, stops, taken aback, realizing that
text: Lee's still there, astride his horse. Everyone looks at the
text: two men who look awkwardly at one another.
dialog: 
text: Then Grant removes his famous slouch hat. Everyone freezes
text: for a moment, and then one by one, the officers of the Union
text: Army remove their hats.
dialog: 
text: Lee is visibly moved by this gesture of respect. He raises
text: his hat, briefly, only an inch from his head. Then, pulling
text: slightly on his horse's reins, he rides away.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. A BUGGY RIDE THROUGH WASHINGTON - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: A beautiful spring afternoon. Lincoln and Mary are riding in
text: the buggy, driven by the old soldier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You've an itch to travel?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: I'd like that. To the West by rail.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (shaking her head no:)
dialog: Overseas.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: The Holy Land.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (a laugh, then:)
text: Awfully pious for a man who takes
text: his wife out buggy-riding on Good
dialog: Friday.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: Jerusalem. Where David and Solomon
dialog: walked. I dream of walking in that
dialog: ancient city.
dialog: 
text: She seems sadder. They ride in silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: All anyone will remember of me is I
dialog: was crazy and I ruined your
dialog: happiness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: Anyone thinks that doesn't
dialog: understand, Molly.
dialog: 
text: She nods; then, tenderly:
dialog: 122.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: When they look at you, at what it
dialog: cost to live at the heart of this,
dialog: they'll wonder at it. They'll
dialog: wonder at you. They should. But
dialog: they should also look at the
dialog: wretched woman by your side, if
dialog: they want to understand what this
dialog: was truly like. For an ordinary
dialog: person. For anyone other than you.
dialog: 
text: Lincoln laughs, takes her hand. She leans against him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: We must try to be happier. We
dialog: must. Both of us. We've been so
dialog: miserable for so long.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE - EVENING
dialog: 
text: Lincoln's in the shirtsleeves and vest of his formal evening
text: wear, his hair brushed down and plastered in place. William
text: Slade is working the tie and gloves. James Ashley and
text: Schuyler Colfax stand with him, holding glasses of scotch
text: whiskey. Slade waits with Lincoln's coat, clothes brush, the
text: stovepipe hat and gloves on the table.
dialog: 
text: John Hay tears down several of the military maps, heavily
text: marked, from the bookcases where they're tacked. He drops
text: these on the floor. As they watch Hay:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: I did say some colored men, the
dialog: intelligent, the educated, and
dialog: veterans, I qualified it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAMES ASHLEY
dialog: Mr. Stevens is furious, he wants to
dialog: know why you qualified it -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER COLFAX
dialog: No one heard the intelligent or the
dialog: educated part. All they heard was
dialog: the first time any president has
dialog: ever made mention of Negro voting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: Still, I wish I'd mentioned it in a
dialog: better speech.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAMES ASHLEY
dialog: Mr. Stevens also wants to know why
dialog: you didn't make a better speech.
dialog: 123.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: They laugh. There's a knock on the door; Nicolay enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN NICOLAY
speaker_heading: (TO LINCOLN:)
text: Mrs. Lincoln's waiting in the
dialog: carriage. She wants me to remind
dialog: you of the hour, and that you'll
dialog: have to pick up Miss Harris and
text: Major Rathbone.
dialog: 
text: Lincoln nods. Slade enters with Lincoln's hat, coat, and
text: gloves. Lincoln begins to dress hurriedly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: Am I in trouble?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLIAM SLADE
dialog: No, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Slade.
dialog: 
text: Slade hands Lincoln his gloves as Colfax and Ashley drain
text: their drinks and rise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN (CONT'D)
dialog: I suppose it's time to go, though I
dialog: would rather stay.
dialog: 
text: He leaves the room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AN EMPTY CORRIDOR, SECOND FLOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE -
speaker_heading: CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: On the way out, Lincoln tosses the gloves on a side table.
text: Slade grabs them, considers chasing after Lincoln, then
text: thinks better of it. He walks back towards the office. Then
text: some strange feeling stops him, and he turns around again.
text: Lincoln is walking away, past the petitioners' chairs, down
text: the empty hallway.
dialog: 
text: Slade watches till Lincoln turns the corner, and he's gone.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. A THEATER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The theater is adorned with patriotic bunting.
dialog: 
text: Onstage, a Caliph's palace. A YOUNG MAN duels with scimitars
text: against a huge, hideous AFRIT. A YOUNG WOMAN in chains cowers
text: in distress. The young man gymnastically avoids being killed,
text: then plunges his scimitar into the afrit's heart. The demon
text: screams and topples to the ground. The audience gasps as a
dialog: 124.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: flame-colored, bejewelled bird rises up from the dead afrit's
dialog: heart.
dialog: 
text: The audience applauds. In the center box, Tad Lincoln is
text: joining in, as is his companion for the evening, Tom Pendel.
dialog: 
text: Onstage, the bird flies off, the young man is freeing the
text: young woman, when the scene is halted by the red curtain
text: lowering, surprising actors and audience. The music dies,
text: the gas lights in the house are being raised as the owner of
text: the theater, LEONARD GROVER, steps out before the curtain and
text: walks to the center of the stage, pale and badly shaken.
dialog: 
text: In the box, Tom Pendel glances quickly at Tad, who's fixed on
text: the stage, eyes open, alarmed.
dialog: 
text: The audience knows something's wrong. Their rising murmur of
text: concern dies immediately when Grover raises his hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEONARD GROVER
speaker_heading: (VOICE SHAKING:)
text: The President has been shot.
dialog: 
text: There are screams of horror from the audience; people leap
dialog: from their seats.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEONARD GROVER (CONT'D)
text: The President has been shot at
dialog: Ford's Theater!
dialog: 
text: The theater is a scene of complete pandemonium. People cry,
text: jam the aisles, call to each other across rows of seats,
text: shout questions at Grover, who's calling for calm, inaudible
text: in the uproar.
dialog: 
text: Tom Pendel is frozen in shock, then turns to draw Tad close
text: to him. Tad pulls away and begins shrieking, clinging to the
text: railing so tightly that Pendel can't pry him loose. Tad can't
text: stop screaming, his eyes wide open, seeing nothing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE BEDROOM IN PETERSON'S BOARDING HOUSE - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Mary is gently escorted into a tiny room. A small, hissing
text: gas jet in the wall bathes the scene with green light.
dialog: 
text: Stanton, Speed, GENERAL HENRY HALLECK and a MINISTER, are
text: standing. Welles sits by the head of the bed. DR. CHARLES
text: LEALE, a young army surgeon, and DR. ROBERT STONE, the
text: Lincoln family's doctor, stand uselessly by the foot of the
text: bed, while DR. JOSEPH BARNES, the Surgeon General, listens to
text: Lincoln's faint breathing.
dialog: 125.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Robert, in uniform, red-eyed, pale as a ghost, sits at the
text: bedside and stares at his father, barely breathing.
dialog: 
text: Lincoln lies in a crooked diagonal, his knees bent, on a bed
text: he's too tall to fit properly, clad only in a nightshirt.
dialog: 
text: Barnes moves his head closer, then closer. The room is
text: utterly still. Barnes takes out his watch, looks at the time,
text: softly clears his throat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. BARNES
dialog: It's 7:22 in the morning, Saturday
text: the 15th of April. It's all over.
dialog: The President is no more.
dialog: 
text: No one talks, or moves.
dialog: 
text: Stanton looks at Lincoln's body.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: Now he belongs to the ages.
dialog: 
text: Robert begins to weep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN (V.O.)
dialog: Fondly do we hope, fervently do we
dialog: pray, that this mighty scourge of
text: war may speedily pass away.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE EAST PORTICO OF THE CAPITOL - NOON
dialog: 
text: Lincoln, wearing spectacles, stands at a podium before the
text: Capitol Dome, still under scaffolding, under cloudy skies. He
text: reads from the two pages.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: Yet, if God wills that it continue
dialog: until all the wealth piled by the
dialog: bondman's two hundred and fifty
dialog: years of unrequited toil shall be
dialog: sunk, and until every drop of blood
dialog: drawn with the lash shall be paid
text: by another drawn with the sword, as
dialog: was said three thousand years ago,
dialog: so still it must be said "the
dialog: judgments of the Lord are true and
dialog: righteous altogether."
dialog: 
text: He glances at his audience: 40,000 people from all over the
text: country, wounded soldiers, civilians in black. And for the
text: first time, in the crowd, not at its edges, hundreds of
dialog: African Americans, civilians and soldiers.
dialog: 126.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINCOLN (CONT'D)
text: With malice toward none, with
dialog: charity for all, with firmness in
dialog: the right as God gives us to see
dialog: the right, let us strive on to
dialog: finish the work we are in, to bind
dialog: up the nation's wounds, to care for
dialog: him who shall have borne the
dialog: battle, and for his widow and his
dialog: orphan, to do all which may achieve
dialog: and cherish a just and a lasting
dialog: peace among ourselves and with all
dialog: nations.
dialog: 
text: FADE TO BLACK.
