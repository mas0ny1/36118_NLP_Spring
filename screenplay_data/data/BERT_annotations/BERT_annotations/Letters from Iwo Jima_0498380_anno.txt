scene_heading: INT. IWO JIMA CAVE ~ DAY (2006)
text: A dark, but large cave in the depths of the Motoyama
text: Mountains of Iwo Jima. The hand carved walls show
text: striations of pick axes from many years past.
text: A PHOTOGRAPHER makes notes on his clipboard and takes
text: flash pictures of labeled artifacts laid out on the
text: floor -- a dust covered BOOT, a rusted and dented
speaker_heading: CANTEEN.
text: A group of JAPANESE EXCAVATORS wearing hard hats with the
text: words “Association of Iwo Jima” emblazoned on them,
text: carefully dig the floor with shovels.
text: The dirt is thrown into wooden boxes with rhythmic
text: THUMPS, and carried out to be sifted.
text: Drenched with sweat and their faces red with exertion,
text: the excavators wither under the humid heat.
speaker_heading: EXCAVATOR #1
dialog: How did those soldiers dig out
dialog: these tunnels in the first place?
text: Exhausted, Excavator #1 has to pause.
speaker_heading: EXCAVATOR #1
dialog: Let’s get a rotation in here.
text: He starts to leave.
speaker_heading: EXCAVATOR #2
dialog: Wait a minute.
text: His shovel hits something which looks like a LEATHER
speaker_heading: SATCHEL.
text: The two Excavators take a closer look and carefully dig
text: around the artifact.

text: Holes just big enough to stand in.
dialog: Not wide enough to move forward or

dialog: Hanako, now I know what it feels
dialog: like to dig my own grave.
text: Saigo wipes his face dirtied with the black sand. He has

dialog: wise or a wise-ass.

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN TANIDA
dialog: You no good peasants! Scums!

text: stands at attention and stops beating Saigo and
dialog: Kashiwara.
speaker_heading: KURIBAYASHI
dialog: Captain, what are you doing?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN TANIDA
dialog: These soldiers were conspiring
dialog: with unpatriotic words, sir.
text: Kuribayashi looks over at the haggard looking soldiers.
speaker_heading: KURIBAYASHT
dialog: I see. And Captain, do you have
dialog: such an excess of soldiers that
dialog: you can put two of them out of

text: Captain Tanida is hesitant.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN TANIDA
dialog: No, sir.

speaker_heading: KURIBAYASHI
dialog: If you had studied Tarawa, you
dialog: would know that concentrating our

dialog: futile.

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN TANIDA
dialog: Stop digging!

dialog: the Americans.
speaker_heading: SAIGO
dialog: No, stupid. He studied the

speaker_heading: NOZAKI
dialog: I heard from someone in the 204th

speaker_heading: SAIGO
