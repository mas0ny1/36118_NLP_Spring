dialog: (Reads)
dialog: "In summer 2001 Iraq sought to

dialog: Turner.." That's me.. "flew to

dialog: scientists. Mr. Turner produced
dialog: this report, aspects of which
dialog: represents the CIA's present

dialog: questions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANALYST
dialog: The INR concluded late last year

dialog: they exactly matched those used by
dialog: Iraq for artillery rockets.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Where are the tubes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: WINPAC has them. We've examined
dialog: them. This is my point. None of you
dialog: guys has even seen the tubes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALERIE

dialog:

dialog: match for those developed by German

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: You're right. I'm no nuclear
dialog: expert. But Dr. Houston Wood, at
dialog: Virginia U atomic facility is. He
dialog: also knows Dr Zippe, who's 89 and
dialog: lives in Austria, and he told him
dialog: that the wall thickness of the
dialog: Iraqi tubes was three or four times
dialog: the thickness of his design.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: And the tubes are twice as long as
text: Zippe's design. In fact the only
dialog: similarity between his tubes and
dialog: the alumumium tubes is that they're
text: made of aluminium.

speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: A metal that hasn't been used in

speaker_heading: VALERIE
text: Behind the curve Sir. Most of the

speaker_heading: PAVITT
dialog: What about geo-satellite imaging?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: With respect sir, you can't look at

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAVITT
dialog: So talk to the defectors.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: The defectors are unreliable. Most
dialog: are supplied through a former asset
dialog: the agency's had on a burn notice
text: since `95. It's a racket. They walk

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAVITT
dialog: So we're blind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALERIE

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR AZIZ

speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: Sir, Dr Harper is in Cambridge,

dialog: 
text: The professor blinks. Taken aback.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR AZIZ
dialog: I don't understand. Who are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: I'm sorry for misleading you. But
dialog: I'm here to ask you the same
dialog: question.
dialog: (He stops)
dialog: Because you are not Professor Aziz.
dialog: 
text: He stands there. Thrown.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: I'm sorry to surprise you like this
dialog: Sir. Your name is Doctor Harif Al
dialog: Fallari. You were born in Basra.
dialog: 
text: The old man looks perplexed. Even a little amused. He sits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR AZIZ
dialog: Well. This is indeed a strange
dialog: morning. Madam, there seems to have
dialog: been a mistake. My name is Said
dialog: Uhmah Aziz. I am a theoretical
dialog: physicist. I model space. I've
dialog: never been to Basra. I'm a teacher.
dialog: I'd like to be of assistance. But
dialog: I'm afraid I can't help you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: So you're not Doctor Fallari.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR AZIZ
dialog: Madam. I've never even heard of
dialog: this man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: You were not lead engineer at the
dialog: Osirak nuclear installation outside
dialog: Tikrit. You were never captured by
text: the Mukhbarat escaping to Syria.
dialog: You didn't spend three years in the
dialog: Abu Dhan jail.
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR AZIZ
dialog: This is absurd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: You weren't tortured. Broken. You
dialog: didn't finally escape and arrive
dialog: here in Cairo with nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR AZIZ
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: Dr. Al Fallari had two daughters.
dialog: They were taken by Uday Hussein's
dialog: private guard. He never saw them
dialog: again.
dialog: 
text: He stares at the floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: That didn't happen. They never
dialog: existed.
dialog: 
text: He remains motionless. Valerie watches him closely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: I need names. Of your colleagues in

dialog: of hundreds of thousands of your
dialog: people may depend upon it.
dialog: 
text: He looks up at Valerie tears in his eyes
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: I know Tarif. I know what happened.
dialog: 
text: He walks over to the window. SLOWLY he takes off his jacket.
text: His shirt, pulls it off over his head and turns his back to
text: her. He's been mutilated and burned all up his back. Slowly
text: he turns. Deep scars. Burns.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANALYST 2
dialog: He thinks I don't know how serious
dialog: it is.. weeks and weeks of fifteen
dialog: hour days, we've gone back over and
text: over it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: OK. I'll handle this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Scooter listens patiently to PAUL, the chief analyst.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: And so apart from all the
dialog: scepticism surrounding the
dialog: specification, the analysis from
dialog: the IAEA which I believe is
text: numbered in the report..
dialog: (Stops. Changes tack)
dialog: Mr Libby. Energy department nuclear
dialog: scientists are among the most
dialog: boring people on the planet. They
dialog: can talk about gas centrifuges
dialog: until you want to jump out of a
dialog: window. And maybe once every ten
dialog: years someone comes along and says
dialog: "so, tell me about gas
dialog: centrifuges". That's literally the
dialog: only time you should listen to
dialog: these guys. If they say an
dialog: aluminium tube is not for a gas
dialog: centrifuge it's like a fish talking
dialog: about water. We've been over this
dialog: data with you now five, six times.
dialog: And... We don't really know how you
dialog: want us to play this..
dialog: 
text: Libby listens. He nods. Waits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIBBY
dialog: Let me level with you here Paul. I
dialog: don't know what these tubes are
dialog: for. From everything you're saying,
dialog: there could be something to this,
dialog: but very likely not, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Exactly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIBBY
dialog: May I ask a question? When you say
dialog: we don't really know how to play
dialog: this, what do you mean?
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (Stops. Turns white)
dialog: I'm just saying I don't know how to
dialog: say it any other way than that-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIBBY
dialog: Except you didn't say `I' you said
dialog: `we'. So you and the others have
dialog: discussed how to "play" these
dialog: briefings. Why does the CIA feel
dialog: the need to play these briefings?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No. I mean that.. Ok. I didn't mean
dialog: what I just said.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIBBY
dialog: Which part. The last part. Or other
dialog: things too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm a getting a little confused-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIBBY
dialog: You want me to come back?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No. GOD no.
dialog: 
text: The temperature drops five degrees.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIBBY
dialog: You don't know why I'm here do you?
dialog: In 1991 the United States invaded
dialog: Iraq, and afterwards weapons
dialog: inspectors discovered Saddam was
dialog: six months off enriching uranium to
dialog: sufficiently high specification to
dialog: make a nuclear bomb. He had fissile
dialog: material. And not a single person
dialog: at the CIA, from the DCI down to
dialog: the janitor had the slightest clue
dialog: that such a program even existed.
dialog: So now, one decade on, are you
dialog: telling me that you're 100% sure
dialog: these tubes are not intended to
dialog: create nuclear weapons?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I..Sir..OK. With intelligence,
dialog: nothing's 100 percent.
dialog: 39.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIBBY
dialog: So. What? Are you.. Ninety nine
dialog: percent sure? Ninety eight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You can't put an exact figure. You
dialog: can't be that precise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIBBY
dialog: But if you had to say, could you
dialog: say you're ninety seven percent
dialog: sure? Is there a three percent
dialog: chance you've got this wrong? Or
dialog: four? Or five? Still pretty good
dialog: odds. You like those odds Paul? You
dialog: willing to put your name to that.
dialog: Are you ready to make that call?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I don't make the call, Sir-.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIBBY
dialog: (Fixing him)
dialog: Yes you do Paul. Each time you
dialog: interpret a piece of data. Each
dialog: time you choose a "maybe" over a
dialog: "perhaps" you make a call. A
dialog: decision. And right now you're
dialog: making lots of little decisions
dialog: adding up to a big decision and out
dialog: there's a real world where millions
dialog: of people depend upon you being
dialog: right. But what if there's a one
dialog: percent chance you're wrong. Can
dialog: you say for sure you'll take that
dialog: chance and state, as a fact, that
dialog: this equipment is not intended for
dialog: a nuclear weapons programme?
dialog: 
text: The analyst sits frozen.

speaker_heading: LIBBY
dialog: Do you know what one percent of the

dialog: three million, two hundred and
dialog: forty thousand souls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Sir. We're not machines. We.. It..
dialog: We look at the evidence, we game it
dialog: out. Not everyone agrees all the
dialog: time. It's a process.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIBBY
dialog: It's a process.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
