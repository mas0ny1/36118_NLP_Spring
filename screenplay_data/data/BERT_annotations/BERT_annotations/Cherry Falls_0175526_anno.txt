speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN - NIGHT
text: The hanging sign says 'Entering Cherry Falls, Ohio'
text: We see Cherry Falls - A small town in rural Northeastern Ohio. This is
text: Norman Rockwell land, red barns on dirt roads, a square in the center of
text: town. But things are hidden here. The barns are locked, the shades are
dialog: drawn.
dialog: Dissolve to:
scene_heading: EXT. LOVER'S LANE
text: A romantic turn-off used exclusively for parking. A river gushes by.
text: Crickets chirp. The trees blow in the autumn wind. A single car sits on
text: the lonely road. The muffled sound of a young couple making out drifts
text: through the streamed up windows.
speaker_heading: INT. CAR
text: A teenage boy's hand is under a teenage girl's shirt, gently massaging her
text: breast. He pulls his hand out from under her shirt and places it on her
text: bare knee.
text: As he starts to slide his hand up her leg, she grabs his hand and gently
text: pulls it away. She places it back on her breast, sliding it under her
dialog: shirt.
text: We pull back. STACY and ROD, two healthy sixteen year olds, are
text: passionately making out in the proverbial back seat of a big American car.
text: Rod smiles seductively, kisses Stacy, and places his hand back on her
text: knee. Once again, she stops him, this time just squeezing his hand
dialog: tightly.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: No.
text: He doesn't give up easy. He playfully wrestles his hand free and slides it
text: under her skirt. She grabs his hand again.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I said no.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: But you don't really
dialog: mean it.
text: He struggles to free his hand.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Yes I do. Keep it in your
dialog: pants Rod.
text: He gives up, aggravated.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Maybe it won't stay in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Maybe you better just
dialog: drive me home.
text: He starts the car, glares at her for a second, then turns it off.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Let me just ask you a serious
dialog: question first.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Aren't you worried you
dialog: could die a virgin?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: Yeah. I'm extremely worried
dialog: about that. It's right up
dialog: there with global warming.
speaker_heading: ROD
text: On our way home, a drunken
dialog: driver could hit us head on
dialog: and send us flying through
dialog: the windshield. Terminate
dialog: us instantly. We'd never
dialog: experience what it means to
dialog: make love.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: If sheep don't count.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: That wasn't me ...
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I know. I'm kidding you.
dialog: Chill out.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Well I'm trying to be real
dialog: here and you're mocking me.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (softening)
dialog: I'm sorry, but you're not
dialog: going to die a virgin Rod.
scene_heading: EXT. LOVER'S LANE
text: There is another car around the bend, hidden from sight. It's an old beat
text: up Imperial from the late sixties. Someone is watching them. It's probably
dialog: a psychopath.
scene_heading: INT. ROD'S CAR
text: Rod leans in and starts kissing Stacy again.
speaker_heading: ROD(cont.)
dialog: I don't wanna take that chance.
dialog: I want my first time to be with you.
text: She kisses him back. He slides his hand under her skirt again.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Stop it.
text: He doesn't.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Rod!
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: You're being unfair.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Unfair?!
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Yes. Unfair to me.
text: He begins to overpower her. This is quickly turning into date rape. SHE
text: STARTS TO FIGHT BACK BUT HE DOESN'T STOP. FINALLY, SHE SCRATCHES him
text: savagely across the face. This catches his attention. He jumps back, cut
text: slightly, surprised.
text: She opens the car door and quickly escapes.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD
text: She runs away from the car, down the road, very upset.
speaker_heading: INT. CAR
text: Rod catches himself. He looks at his bloodied face in the rear view mirror
text: and realizes what he's done.
text: He starts up the car.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD
text: Stacy runs down the road alone, still very upset.
speaker_heading: INT. CAR
text: Rod pulls up next to her and rolls down his window.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Stacy! I'm sorry.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD
text: She pays no attention to him.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Please get back in the car, Stacy.
text: She turns and heads down a path into the dark woods, purposely going where
dialog: he can't follow.
speaker_heading: INT. CAR
text: Rod, frustrated, hits the steering wheel and floors it.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD
text: As Rod's car tears off, down the road, the other car that was parked at
text: lover's lane drives up and pulls over, lights still off.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS
text: Stacy heads deeper into the woods. When she finally stops to catch her
text: breath and wipe away her tears, she hears someone approaching her.
text: Suddenly, the footsteps stop. Stacy senses that someone is watching her.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Rod?
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Is that you Rod?
text: Still no answer. A little frightened, she starts to walk again. Again she
text: hears the footsteps following her. She stops again. Whoever is out there
text: stops too. She looks around in every direction.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Come out Rod.
dialog: This SCREAM bull shit ain't
dialog: gonna work with me!
text: No answer. Even the birds have stopped chirping.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (terrified)
dialog: Rod? You're freaking me
dialog: out. Game's over. I lose.
dialog: Come out and we'll fuck.
text: She hears the footsteps behind her and quickly turns around. She sees the
text: silhouette of someone standing a few feet away.
text: The wind picks up. Stacy realizes it isn't Rod. All she can see is that
text: whoever is there is carrying a small sledge hammer in one hand and a very
text: long, jagged, steel nail in the other.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (in full panic)
dialog: NO!
text: Stacy starts to run. The killer starts after her.
scene_heading: EXT. STACY'S
text: Rod is sitting in his car in front of Stacy's house at the edge of the
text: woods, waiting for her to appear. He checks his watch.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS
text: Stacy runs for the edge of the woods but she isn't quite fast enough to
text: elude her pursuer.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Help!
text: The killer catches Stacy from behind and savagely smashes her head against
text: a tree, cracking a branch. Stacy falls to the ground, dazed.
speaker_heading: INT. CAR
text: Rod sits up in his seat, thinking he's heard something
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS
text: Stacy, half conscious, bleeding from the head, is dragged back deeper into
dialog: the woods.
scene_heading: EXT. STACY'S
text: Rod gets out of the car and cautiously moves to the edge of the dark
dialog: woods.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS
text: Rod's POV - The woods are pitch black.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Stacy?
speaker_heading: STACY(O.C.)
dialog: (struggling, in the distance)
speaker_heading: ROD!
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS
text: The killer kicks Stacy in the side, instantly shutting her up. He gags her
text: and ties her to a tree trunk. She struggles, but she's no match for the
dialog: killer.
speaker_heading: INT. CAR
text: Rod grabs his flashlight from the glove compartment.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS
text: Rod's flashlight beam frantically cuts through the woods.
text: Rod charges through the woods, desperately looking for any sign of Stacy.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS
text: Stacy's right hand is raised above her head and placed, palm out, against
text: a tree trunk.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS
text: Rod searches for Stacy, his flashlight jaggedly cutting the darkness.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS
text: The huge nail, extremely sharp and jagged, is placed in the center of
text: Stacy's outstretched palm.
text: The hammer is pulled back, aimed at the head of the nail.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS
text: Rod stops and frantically looks around, knowing he's fighting a losing
dialog: battle.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Stacy?!
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS
text: The hammer descends on the nail.
text: Stacy screams out in pain, even through the gag, as he hand is nailed to
dialog: the tree.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS
text: Rod hears her muffled cry and runs toward the sound.
text: Stacy's left hand is now placed up against a different tree.
text: Another nail is readied.
text: Stacy tries to free her nailed hand but it's useless. She goes into shock.
text: Rod's flashlight continues to cut through the night. His feet trample
text: fallen branches. Suddenly, he stops. He's found her.
text: Stacy is stretched out between two trees, gagged, one hand nailed to each
text: tree. She almost looks crucified.
text: Rod, starts toward her, not sure what to do. He looks into Stacy's
text: terrified eyes. She's looking behind him.
text: Rod quickly turns around but he's too late.
text: A knife comes plunging down toward Rod's chest.
text: Stacy frantically tries to free herself but she only succeeds in ripping
text: her palms on the nails.
text: Rod falls to his knees, blood streaming from his chest and mouth.
text: Stacy can't even react anymore, she's so horrified.
text: The killer's hand rips open Stacy's shirt and feels her soft ripe stomach.
text: Stacy looks down, terrified of what the killer has planned.
text: A small but extremely sharp razor attached to the end of a pencil is
text: placed up against Stacy's bare stomach. The killer's hand grips it like
text: it's an ordinary pencil.
text: Stacy's eyes grow abnormally wide as the carving starts. She's never
dialog: experienced such pain.
text: Blood drips to the ground.
dialog: Dissolve to:
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHT SKY
text: The full moon looks down on the town.
scene_heading: EXT. CUL DE SAC
text: Another romantic turn off. A view from the top of a hill overlooking the
text: sleepy town. A lonely car sits there, the sound of a teenage couple making
text: out drifting through it's steamed up windows. It's almost a repeat of the
dialog: first scene.
speaker_heading: INT. CAR
text: The boy pulls his hand from under the girl's shirt and unsnaps her jeans.
text: She pushes his hand away but he puts it right back, wriggling a finger
text: down into her pants.
text: JODY MARKEN, a pretty all-American sixteen year old girl, strong willed
text: but still innocent, stops kissing her boyfriend KENNY, trying to hold him
text: off. Kenny is also sixteen. He's thin and a bit shaggy, but very cute
text: nonetheless. His hair is shoulder length, his stare intense. He takes
text: himself seriously, all rebel.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Cut it out.
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I was supposed to be home
dialog: fifteen minutes ago.
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: So? You're already late.
dialog: A few more minutes won't
dialog: matter.
text: He slides a second finger into her pants. She closes her legs, making his
text: probing much more difficult.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I got to get home.
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: Fuck your curfew. Most
dialog: sixth graders can stay out
dialog: later than you.
text: He starts kissing her again.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Kenny....
text: She pulls his hand out of her pants. He stares at her for a second,
text: completely exasperated. He sits up and starts the car.
scene_heading: EXT. CUL DE SAC
text: The car squeals away.
speaker_heading: INT. CAR
text: Jody and Kenny drive home, not talking.
text: He pulls up in front of her house.
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: You know, maybe we ought to
text: start seeing other people.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: Jody, we've been going out
dialog: for over a year. I love you
dialog: but I'm all out of patience.
text: Jody doesn't know what to say. She didn't expect this.
scene_heading: EXT. MARKEN HOUSE
text: Jody gets out of the car, very upset. Kenny takes off, not even waiting to
text: see if she gets inside safely, leaving her all alone on the dark street. A
text: car backfires in the distance. A nearby noise startles her. Something's
text: behind the garbage cans. She heads quickly up the driveway, disappearing
text: behind the house.
scene_heading: INT. MARKEN'S HOUSE - BACK FOYER
text: All is quiet in the house. The back door opens. Jody tiptoes up back
dialog: staircase.
scene_heading: INT. MARKEN'S HOUSE
text: Jody appears on the second floor. It's a family house, politely decorated
text: and immaculately clean. She quietly creeps down the hallway toward her
text: room. As she passes her parents' room, she looks down. She's relieved that
text: no light is coming from under their door.
scene_heading: INT. JODY'S BEDROOM
text: Jody creeps into her bedroom and quietly shuts the door. She's made it.
text: She sits on the bed to catch her breath.
text: Something moves in the corner of her room. Jody jumps, scared.
text: Someone is sitting in her rocking chair.
speaker_heading: BRENT
text: It's almost ten o'clock.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Daddy you scared me!
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: You're grounded Friday night!
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST
text: LOST TRACK OF TIME.
text: BRENT MARKEN gets up and heads to the door. He's a big man, 45 years old,
text: well built. He's dressed in a tree-shirt and jeans.
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: Your curfew is 9:30 and you
dialog: know it, little miss.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: It won't happen again.
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: You said that two weeks ago.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Dad ! Most of my friends can
dialog: stay out until 11 on school nights
dialog: and 1 on weekends!
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: They're not all the sheriff's daughter.
dialog: Goodnight.
text: He leaves. Jody is furious. She lies down on the bed to stew. She might at
text: well have stayed out. The phone in the hallway rings. She leaps up.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: Jody runs up to the phone but waits for it to ring a second time before
text: picking it up. She crosses her fingers, praying it's Kenny.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Hello. (beat) One second.
dialog: (to her dad)
dialog: Hey Adolph, it's the station!
text: Brent comes out and picks up the phone as Jody heads back to her room,
dialog: disappointed.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
text: Jody flops on the bed.
speaker_heading: BRENT(O.C.)
dialog: Hello. (beat) What?
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
dialog: Brent it shocked.
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: Where?
text: MARGE MARKEN, Jody's mother, comes out of the bedroom, sensing something
text: terrible has happened. Marge is a couple of years older than Brent. She's
text: a bit lifeless, a pretty woman who's whole life is her daughter and a
text: bottle of Peachtree Schnapps.
speaker_heading: BRENT(CONT'D)
dialog: I'm on my way.
scene_heading: INT. JODY'S
text: Jody sits up on her bed, also sensing something big has happened.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: Brent buttons up his shirt.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: Two kids were found mutilated
text: in the woods. Lock the door
dialog: after me.
text: Brent grabs his gun belt and heads down the stairs.
text: Jody appears. She and her mom share a concerned glance.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STACY'S HOUSE
text: Brent pulls up. A lot of official cars are already there.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS
text: A trail of flares eerily light up the woods, leading to the crime scene.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS
text: The murder sit. Police cameras flash. Stacy is still nailed to the tree.
text: Rod is dead on the ground below her in a puddle of his own blood.
text: Brent walks up, immediately repulsed by the gruesome sight. His deputy,
text: JACK WEBBER, sidles up next to him.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: Her parents reported her missing about
dialog: an hour ago.
text: A flash bulb momentarily lights up the scene. Brent pulls out his
text: flashlight to better survey the carnage.
text: He starts on Rod, throat slit, chest gutted. He then moves to Stacy,
text: looking at one nailed hand, then the other.
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: What kind of a person wakes
dialog: up in the morning and says
dialog: to themselves, 'Think I'll nail
dialog: a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
text: The same type that decides to carve into
dialog: her stomach.
text: Brent finally shines the flashlight beam on Stacy's stomach. Carved into
text: her flesh is the word 'VIRGIN'.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: MONTAGE
text: High school kids are getting ready for school.
text: Body parts are being covered. Pants and stocking are pulled up over bare
text: teenage legs.
text: Shirts and bras cover bare teenage chests.
text: Zippers are pulled tight. Buttons are buttoned.
text: The school bell rings and the kids arrive in cars, on bikes, walking.
text: IT'S A TYPICAL small town American high school, somewhat repressed but
text: alive. The news spreads quickly about the double killing as the crowd
text: splits into its various tribes: punk rockers, jocks, potheads,
dialog: cheerleaders, nerds.
text: The killing is on everyone's mind.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOLYARD
text: Jody rides up on her bike and glances across the schoolyard as she locks
text: it in the bike rack.
text: Jody's POV - Kenny is leaning against a tree, talking with a busty girl,
speaker_heading: SHARON.
text: Jody is upset to see Kenny flirting with someone else. As she starts
text: toward the front door of the school, a few other CLASSMATES run up to her.
text: She keeps glancing over at Kenny but he doesn't notice her.
speaker_heading: CLASSMATE 1
dialog: Jody!
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: CLASSMATE 2
dialog: Was Stacy raped?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I dunno. My dad never came home
dialog: last night.
text: Jody's POV - Kenny takes Sharon's hand for a second.
speaker_heading: CLASSMATE 1(O.C.)
dialog: I bet she was. I heard someone
text: stuffed a tent spike up her ass.
speaker_heading: CLASSMATE 2(O.C.)
dialog: Gives new meaning to the idea
dialog: of getting 'nailed'.
speaker_heading: CLASSMATE 1(O.C.)
dialog: Ha-ha. So funny. Sickfuck.
text: Jody doesn't respond. She stares at Kenny.
text: Jody's POV - Kenny walks into school with Sharon.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOMEROOM
text: Jody enters her homeroom, still upset.
text: Her teacher LEONARD MARLISTON is lecturing the class. Leonard is twenty-
text: five and quite hip looking for a teacher. He has long somewhat stringy
text: brown hair. He is a bit thin and is dressed casually, almost in hippy
text: attire. He wears wire-rim glasses and lace-up boots.
speaker_heading: MR. MARLISTON
dialog: No one understands what leads people
dialog: to do irrational things. We only
dialog: know that unpunished violence
text: festers, then explodes.
text: Jody sits down in the back.
speaker_heading: MARLISTON(CONT'D)
dialog: Witness the L.A. Riots. Years of
dialog: police brutality in forty-eight hours. Jody?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Yes Mr. Marliston?
speaker_heading: MR. MARLISTON
dialog: Your dad's in the principal's office.
dialog: He wants to see you.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE
text: Brent is talking to TOM SISLER, the principal. Tom is a wiry, hard
text: featured man in his mid-forties. They have known each other for a long
text: time but are not really friends. Brent knows Tom too well. Tom's a cynical
dialog: bastard.
text: Tom is examining the photos taken at the crime scene.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You aren't planning to tell these kids
dialog: that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy
dialog: and Rod, are you?
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: But I am going to have to question
text: all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Fine, just don't mention the carving
dialog: This is going to be a tough enough day
dialog: as it is.
text: There's a knock at the door. Jody enters.
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: Hi honey.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Hi Jody.
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: I just wanted to check that
dialog: you were okay?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I'm fine. I've just never had
dialog: someone my age die before.
dialog: It's so weird.
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: How well did you know Stacy and
dialog: Rod?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I've been in the same class
dialog: with Stacy for years but we
dialog: weren't tight or anything.
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: Had either of them broken
dialog: up with someone recently?
dialog: Hurt someone?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: No. Those two were together
dialog: before Kenny and I started
dialog: hanging out and that's over,
dialog: what, God a year now.
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: I want you to head right home
dialog: after school.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I will. Is that all?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Could you tell Mr. Marliston
dialog: we'd like to see him.
speaker_heading: JODY
speaker_heading: SURE.
text: She leaves.
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
speaker_heading: TOM
text: The kids adore him. They confide
text: in him. His patchouli reeking rear
dialog: might know if Stacy and Rod were
dialog: really virgins. Why didn't you
dialog: ask Jody that?
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: She's my daughter, Tom.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: So you just don't point
dialog: blank ask your teenage daughter
dialog: about sex.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Why not? You worried you might
dialog: find out how much she actually
dialog: knows?
text: Brent gives Tom a 'keep your cynical shit off my daughter' look.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: You rang?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Come in Leonard. Have you
dialog: met Brent Marken?
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: No but I've always wanted to.
text: He shakes his hand firmly.
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: Nice to meet you too. My
dialog: daughter speaks highly of you.
text: Leonard examines Brent's face carefully. Brent is a little taken aback by
dialog: his intensity.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: We have the same color eyes.
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: I guess we do.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CAFTERIA
text: MARK SHALE, a seventeen year old, rail thin pothead is sitting at a table
text: in the crowded cafeteria eating lunch. The place is a zoo. CINDY, a cute,
text: mini-skirted brunette, and BEN, a frizzy-haired, tattooed, pierced, punk-
text: rocker, are sitting with him.
text: Jody is standing at the door with her best friend SANDY, looking for a
text: place to sit. Sandy is thin and a little underdeveloped for her age. She
text: is wearing very little make-up, a baggy shirt and baggy jeans. Although
text: she looks much more tomboyish than Jody and a year or two younger, she is
text: still quite cute and curvy, just lacking a bit in self-confidence when it
text: comes to boys. Sandy is staring at Mark.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Go sit next to him.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Mark Shale.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Don't you want to talk to him?
dialog: You watch him eat everyday.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: I don't watch him eat everyday.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: You stare at him non-stop,
dialog: like every lunch. Like this. Like
text: most people stare at car accidents.
text: Jody imitates Sandy.
speaker_heading: SANDY
text: The seat behind him is open. Come on,
dialog: I can eavesdrop too.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: You eventually have to talk to him.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Why? All my mom and dad ever do is
dialog: watch each other eat and they've been
dialog: married for twenty years.
text: Cindy sees Jody approaching and motions her over.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Jody!
text: Jody starts toward her table.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: No! That's his table.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: You're going to look really
dialog: amoebic splitting off from me now.
text: The other three kids look up as Jody sits don.
text: Sandy has no choice but to sit down next to Mark. She immediately freezes
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Did your dad question you
dialog: this morning?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Just a little.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Did he ask you if Stacy
dialog: and Rod has ever exchanged
dialog: bodily fluids?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: No. Why?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: He asked Marliston.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: If they had ever gone all the way?
speaker_heading: BEN
text: Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED
text: OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: I wonder why it's so important
dialog: to know if they fucked?
text: Sandy is completely frozen. Jody realizes it. Mark is paying no attention
dialog: to her.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What I don't understand is
dialog: why they asked Marliston if
dialog: Rod was a virgin. They could have
dialog: asked you Cindy.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: I never fucked Rod.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
text: Jody nudges Sandy under the table, trying to prompt her to say something.
text: Sandy can only stare at Mark as he eats.
speaker_heading: CINDY(O.C.)
dialog: If I'm so all-used-up Ben,
dialog: why do you try to hook me
dialog: up non-stop?
speaker_heading: BEN(O.C.)
dialog: As fucking if.
text: Across the cafeteria, a sophomore ANNETTE storms in very upset. She
text: confronts DYLAN, her junior boyfriend.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: You're a shitsucking liar!
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: (taunting)
dialog: Better than being a 'cocksucking'
dialog: liar!
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: Shut your face!
text: Annette leaps on Dylan and starts violently scratching him. Mr. Marliston
text: runs over and pulls her off. He drags Annette away.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: He's been telling people....
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: You can tell me all about it in
dialog: my office. Calm down. We're all
dialog: on edge today.
text: He guides her out.
text: Sandy gets up her nerve and makes eye contact with Mark.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: What's up with that?
text: Mark opens a TWINKIE and starts to eat it.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Dylan's been telling people

scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL

dialog: extra make-up or a little tighter jeans. There's a sexual electricity
text: everywhere mixed in with a lot of fear.
text: The normal tribes are disbanding. What are forming in their place are
dialog: sexual tribes. Today, at the high school, sexual history bands kids
dialog: together. Not aesthetics, popularity, or wealth. Punkers chat with nerds,

scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF SCHOOL

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: WOULD that impress you?

dialog: impress the empress?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Your mind is just twisted enough.
dialog: I believe you'd do all this just to
dialog: get a dip or two.
text: Sandy walks up.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Hi Sandy.
text: They all stare at her for a second, noticing the change in her appearance.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Did you want something?
text: Sandy freezes. She doesn't known what to say.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: (almost frozen)
dialog: Yes.(beat) I was just curious

speaker_heading: SANDY

dialog: one.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: They're tasty.
text: He gets out the Twinkie and gives it to her. She unwraps it and takes a
text: bite. Ben and Cindy watch, amazed and entertained.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Thanks.
text: Sandy gets a little cream on her cheek and licks it away with her tongue,
text: a little embarrassed. The sight of her tongue turns Mark on.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You can have both if you want.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: No, you keep one.

speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: That's her.
text: The artist picks up the phone and dials.
speaker_heading: ARTIST
dialog: Brent, we got a sketch.
text: Brent comes into the room and picks up the sketch,
text: FOR THE FIRST TIME we see a picture of the killer. She looks about

dialog: looks like your average small town girl from the late sixties.
text: Brent's face goes white when he sees who it is.
text: Jody notices this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: You know her?

speaker_heading: TOM

dialog: That's impossible.
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: (growing frantic)

speaker_heading: SANDY

speaker_heading: JODY

speaker_heading: SANDY

speaker_heading: SANDY

speaker_heading: GIRL 3
dialog: What to do.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: You have to do everything
dialog: Boys are totally clueless when
dialog: it comes to sex.
text: This answer terrifies the audience.
speaker_heading: CINDY(cont'd)
text: It starts with them trying to
text: unhook our bras, fumbling around,
dialog: and never changes. Wait until they try
dialog: to put their dicks in you.
speaker_heading: GIRL 2
dialog: Please don't say they need our help

speaker_heading: CINDY

speaker_heading: BOY 2
dialog: No. The killer could be offing

speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I'm not using him as an excuse.

speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: Yes you are. You always do.

speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I do not.
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S

speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Attacked how?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: She was raped. At least that's
dialog: what she claimed.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: You didn't believe her?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (confessing)
dialog: No, I believed her. She was in
text: pretty bad shape. Inside and out.
dialog: But the boys were never formally
dialog: charged.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: They were children of our leading
text: citizens, stars of the football team.
text: And she was a loner. An angry girl
dialog: that no one really liked. She'd called
dialog: them 'queers'.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: People thought these guys had a
dialog: right to rape her because she called
dialog: them 'queers'?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: They were proving to her they weren't.

speaker_heading: JODY

speaker_heading: MARGE

speaker_heading: MARGE

speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JODY

speaker_heading: MARGE

speaker_heading: CARETAKER

speaker_heading: BRENT

speaker_heading: CARETAKER
dialog: Yeah. You should check downstairs.
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CARETAKER
dialog: People always keep their secrets in their

speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I can't believe I listened to one word of

dialog: in town refused to let her use their bathrooms.
dialog: Is that true? Did people really call her a slut
dialog: and tell her 'you can't shit here'? She used to
dialog: snarl that at me. That's all she really did, at least
text: in my direction, was snarl. When she looked at me,
dialog: she saw only you.
text: Jody gags in pain. Brent looks away.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Open your eyes Brent. Watch. Or
dialog: will I cause her much more pain.

text: from the other side.
text: Leonard picks up a lamp with his free hand and smashes Kenny across the
text: head. Kenny falls to the ground.

text: screams, and lunges at Brent.
text: Brent grabs Leonard. Using every ounce of energy he has, he throws Leonard
text: down the basement stairs.
text: Leonard grabs Brent as he tumbles down the stairs. The two roll to the
