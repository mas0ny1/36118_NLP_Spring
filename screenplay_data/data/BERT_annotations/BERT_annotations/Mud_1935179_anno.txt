scene_heading: 1 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - PREDAWN 1
text: ELLIS(14) sits fully-clothed on top of his made bed. He is a
text: wiry young man with a few blonde hairs on his upper lip
text: struggling desperately to be a mustache.
text: His room, cluttered with junk, is dark, quiet and tiny. A
text: backpack and an oversized Walkie-Talkie sit next to him.
text: The silence is cut by a SQUAWK from the Walkie. Ellis
text: quickly grabs it.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I'm comin' out now.
text: He crams the Walkie into his backpack and slings it over his
text: shoulder. On his feet, he slides open a window at the foot
text: of his bed. He's out in one motion.
scene_heading: 2 EXT. HOUSEBOAT - PREDAWN 2
text: Ellis skirts alongside the exterior wall of his room on a two-
text: foot-wide section of decking.
text: He lives on a HOUSEBOAT anchored just off the bank of the
dialog: Arkansas River. The "boat" is really the combination of a
text: double wide trailer and a vinyl-sided shack fused together
text: atop large flotilla.
text: Ellis scurries to the mobile home section of the boat. He
text: slips past a barbecue grill and settles underneath a lighted
text: window. VOICES come from inside.
text: Slowly, Ellis gets on his toes to peer through the window.
scene_heading: 3 INT. ELLIS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 3
text: MARY LEE(41) takes a jug of milk out of the refrigerator.
text: SENIOR(52) sits at a small table reading a newspaper. The
text: mobile home kitchenette is no larger than Ellis' room.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: I just want to have a conversation.
dialog: I just want to talk about it.
text: Mary Lee sits down across from Senior, who doesn't look up
text: from his paper. Her eyes narrow and she extends a finger
text: toward him.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE (CONT'D)
dialog: If you don't look up from that
dialog: goddamn paper...
text: She stops before completing the thought.
text: After a moment, Senior lowers his paper. He stares across
text: the table at his wife. He looks at her with true disdain.
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
text: His eyes trace down her face and robe before finally settling
text: on his cup of coffee. He picks up the cup, takes a sip, and
text: sets it back on the table. He raises the paper up.
text: Mary Lee's eyes soften. She bites the inside of her cheek to
text: keep from crying. Her eyes move to the kitchen window.
scene_heading: 4 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 4
text: Ellis quickly ducks and mouths the word "shit."
text: He slips under the window toward a metal carport that covers
text: a boat, fish cleaning station, and industrial ice machine.
text: The entire houseboat is anchored to the shore by two thick
text: ropes tied to opposite ends of the flotilla. The ropes
text: extend upward into the tops of enormous pine trees.
text: Ellis sprints across a simple, wood-planked bridge to shore.
text: His houseboat is one of several in a row along the riverbank.
scene_heading: 5 EXT. ELLIS' RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS 5
text: Ellis scurries into the treeline and arrives at a dirt path.
text: Waiting for him there is NECKBONE(14), a scrawny kid with
text: slicked back blonde hair wearing a FUGAZI T-shirt. He sits
text: atop a smallish dirt bike. Ellis hops on the back.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: What the shit man?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Suck it. Drive.
text: The bike spits up mud as they peel out down the trail.
scene_heading: 6 EXT. RIVERBANK - PREDAWN 6
text: From a distance, the single headlight of the dirt bike snakes
text: up and down, in and out of trees along the riverbank.
dialog: ON THE BIKE,
text: The sound of the engine rips through fog and trees
text: illuminated by the straining headlight.
scene_heading: 7 EXT. RIVERBANK - DAWN 7
text: The boys emerge from behind a sand covered hill. Now on
text: foot, they are silhouetted against a light blue, morning sky.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: How old is she?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: A Junior.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
text: At a collection of trees growing out of the water, the boys
text: move branches away from a tarp covered boat.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: She's got nice titties. You talk
dialog: to her?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Nah.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: You're gonna have to talk to her.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Remind me when we get back to my
dialog: house, Galen's got a book on that.
text: Neckbone takes a spot up front in the small, flat-bottom
text: boat. Ellis, a foot on the bank and one in the boat,
text: launches them out into the water.
scene_heading: 8 EXT. RIVER - MORNING 8
text: A chunk of Neckbone's greased back hair bobs in the wind as
text: they cruise down river. Ellis steers a small 15 horsepower
text: motor. An orange sun is coming up now.
text: Neckbone's eyes lock on what's in front of them. Ellis kills
text: the motor. Neckbone stands up, a serious look on his face.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Shit.
text: Ellis raises up behind him. He takes a deep breath, nods.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE (CONT'D)
dialog: Your dad'd kill us he knew we went
dialog: out there.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I'm not worried about my dad
dialog: killin' us.
text: THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER sprawls out in front of them. It's
dialog: enormous.
text: Their boat drifts at the mouth of the Arkansas, a small river
text: by comparison. The Mississippi is a swirling mess of brown
text: water and yellow foam six football fields wide.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: What if it sinks?
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: It ain't gonna sink. We gotta move
dialog: if we're gonna make it back. Set
dialog: your watch. We'll need a good
dialog: fifteen minutes.
text: Neckbone sets an alarm on his fat plastic wristwatch. They
text: take their seats. Ellis cranks the motor.
text: The small boat slowly chugs out onto the massive river.
scene_heading: 9 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - MORNING 9
text: The boat lurches through the murky, rushing water.
text: Neckbone has both hands firmly planted on the boat's edges.
text: Ellis tries to handle the motor which has little impact
dialog: against this current.
text: The tail end of the boat swings to the right. Ellis flinches
text: and grabs an edge to steady himself. The front of the boat
text: bobs toward an ISLAND in the middle of the river.
text: Neck turns to Ellis and points.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: THERE IT IS!
scene_heading: 10 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY 10
text: The boys splash down in ankle deep water. They take hold of
text: the front of the boat and drag it onto the muddy shore.
text: Neckbone jogs to a tree line in the center of the island.
text: Ellis snatches up his backpack and follows.
scene_heading: 11 EXT. ISLAND WOODS - CONTINUOUS 11
text: The island, only 60 some yards in diameter, is separated by a
text: clump of tall trees that form a wooded area in its center.
dialog: The trees make it so you can't see from one side of the
dialog: island to the other.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Galen thinks it's been here awhile.
dialog: Thinks the last flood did it.
text: Ellis follows as Neckbone winds through the trees. They stop
text: at a deep creek that cuts across the island. Neckbone looks
text: to his right, then his left. Sees what he's looking for.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's down there.
text: A fallen tree trunk that straddles the creek. Ellis starts
dialog: across.
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBONE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold it.
text: Neckbone picks a large stone up off the ground.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE (CONT'D)
dialog: Look.
text: Eight feet below the tree trunk, a nest of water moccasins
text: curl around in the creek. Neckbone drops the stone on top of
text: them. The snakes fan out.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE (CONT'D)
dialog: Little shits.
text: Their mud-caked high-tops stomp across the trunk.
scene_heading: 12 EXT. ISLAND WOODS - DAY 12
text: The boys stop near the base of a large tree and stare up.
text: Ellis cranes his neck back. Awestruck.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: So there it is.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Yeah, there it is.
text: A 26 Foot Long BOAT sits nestled in the tree limbs above.
scene_heading: 13 EXT. BOAT IN TREE - MOMENTS LATER 13
text: The boys scale up the tree from low lying branches.
text: Ellis, hands on the edge of the boat, gets a leg over the
text: side and pulls himself onto the deck. He reaches down and
text: helps to drag Neckbone on board.
text: They get to their feet, steadying themselves on the wooden
text: deck. It's solid. They take in their new vantage point.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: It came down from up there.
text: Ellis points to higher limbs that have long been broken off.
text: Neckbone walks to the back of the boat and hangs his head
text: over. He finds a gaping hole of gutted wood.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Motor broke off.
text: Ellis isn't concerned with the motor. His eyes are locked on
text: a covered cabin at the front of the boat.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Who else knows about this?
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Just me and Galen.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: What's he think?
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: He don't care about it.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Good.
text: Ellis walks to the cabin. He pushes a vinyl door open.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: 'Cause this boat's ours.
text: Ellis has to duck down to go inside. Neckbone follows.
scene_heading: 14 INT. BOAT CABIN - CONTINUOUS 14
text: Ellis, stooping over, makes his way into the tiny cabin room.
text: Yellow floral curtains, stained with age, cover a row of
text: windows that wrap around the top of the cabin. These provide
text: an odd glow in an otherwise dark, wood paneled space.
text: There is a bench with rotted out cushions to the left. To
text: the right, a mold-covered sink and mirror.
text: Neckbone peers over Ellis' shoulder at the front of the cabin
text: room. A small booth sits to the right across from a
text: miniature toilet partially shielded by an open door.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: It's got its own shitbox
text: Neckbone slides back a portion of floral curtain and light
text: streams in. He starts opening small closets and drawers.
text: Ellis plops down on the rotted bench cushions.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: This is perfect.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Ho-Lee-Shit.
text: Neckbone stares in an open drawer. He removes a stack of
dialog: Playboys from the 1980's.
text: Ellis smiles at him. He leans back and props his foot
text: against the sink cabinet across from him. This is home.
text: Neckbone opens the first Playboy. It disintegrates.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE (CONT'D)
dialog: Aw shit.
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
text: As he scrambles to gather the fallen pages, Ellis notices a
text: dried BOOT PRINT next to his foot. He lowers his shoe from
text: the cabinet leaving a smaller, muddy print of his own.
text: He leans in to examine the larger print. The impression of a
text: CROSS has been left in the heel.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE (CONT'D)
text: Her tits are so small.
text: Ellis reaches out and traces his finger in the groove of the
text: cross marking. His eyes narrow as he re-surveys the cabin.
text: On the table across from the toilet, he notices several empty
text: cans of Beanie Weenie. In the booth, he sees a grocery bag.
text: Ellis slowly raises up and goes over to it.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Neck.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Look at that beave. You gotta see
dialog: this.
text: Ellis reaches out for the plastic bag. His fingers pull back
text: the edges to reveal its contents: one can of unopened Beanie
text: Weenie and half a loaf of BREAD.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Neck.
text: Ellis reaches for the bread and gives it a squeeze. It's
text: FRESH. Ellis freezes.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Someone's here.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: What?
text: Ellis holds the loaf of bread up to Neckbone.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Someone's livin' here.
text: Neckbone sees the grocery bag. His eyes widen. The boys are
text: stone frozen. They listen for other sounds. Silence.
text: BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!
text: Both boys flinch at the sharp sounds. Neckbone's hand flies
text: to cover the alarm on his wristwatch.
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: We gotta go. I can't be late.
scene_heading: 15 EXT. BASE OF BOAT TREE - MOMENTS LATER 15
text: They drop out of the tree and hit the ground running.
scene_heading: 16 EXT. ISLAND WOODS/CREEK - MOMENTS LATER 16
text: The boys' feet rush across the tree trunk bridging the creek.
scene_heading: 17 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - MOMENTS LATER 17
text: They launch out of the treeline and sprint to their boat.
text: Neckbone grabs the side and starts pushing the boat to the
text: water. Ellis slings his backpack in and joins him.
text: Suddenly, Ellis straightens up, leaving Neckbone to struggle.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Ellis stares at a muddy boot print, cross in the heel,
text: stamped in the center of their boat. He looks back to the
text: treeline, then down the shore. He looks to his feet.
text: The boys' shoe prints make chaotic patterns in the mud.
text: Larger boot prints lead off down the shoreline.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE (CONT'D)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
speaker_heading: (POINTING)
dialog: I saw that same boot print up in
text: the tree. It has a cross in the
dialog: heel. Somebody's been in our boat.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Shit. Let's go.
text: Ellis begins following the boot prints around the shoreline.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE (CONT'D)
dialog: We gotta go if you wanna make it
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: (NO RESPONSE)
dialog: Your dad's gonna kick our ass.
dialog: It'll take twice as long goin' up
dialog: river.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Hold it.
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
text: Ellis stops and points ahead of them.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
text: Up there. They stop.
text: Neckbone takes the lead, walking up to the last boot print.
text: They appear to vanish.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Where the hell'd he go?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I don't know.
text: Neckbone turns and freezes. A MAN has appeared in the
text: distance behind Ellis. He stands between the boys and their
dialog: boat.
text: Ellis notices the look on Neckbone's face and turns. He
text: flinches at the sight of the Man.
text: MUD(38) stands near the boys' boat holding a pink, child's
text: fishing pole with cartoon characters on it. He stares back
text: at them and casts his fishing line into the water.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Shit. You know that guy?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I've never seen him before.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Shit.
text: Mud, not taking his eyes off the boys, slowly reels in his
text: line. His hair is a wild mop that leads to two weeks of
text: growth on his face.
text: With a cigarette clinched, he cracks a smile revealing a
text: MISSING CANINE. He holds a hand in the air as if to wave.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit.
text: Neckbone slowly raises his hand up to wave back. Mud wears
text: jeans and cowboy boots. His filthy button-up shirt looks
text: like it hasn't left his body in years.
text: He breaks his stare with the boys. Continuing to reel in his
text: line, he walks over to them.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: What you say?
text: The boys don't respond. Mud walks past them and casts again.
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Helluva thing.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: What's that?
text: Mud takes the cigarette from his mouth. A tattoo of a
text: snake's head covers the top of his right hand. Two large
text: cotton blossoms spill out of its jaws.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Boat in the trees. It's a helluva
dialog: thing.
text: Mud continues walking down the shoreline, reeling in his
text: bait. The boys follow, tentatively.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You talkin' 'bout our boat?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I'm talkin' about my boat.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: We found it.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: You found it with me livin' in it.
dialog: Possession is nine tenths of the
dialog: law.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Don't tell me you boys are from
dialog: Mississippi?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: No.
text: They watch as he grabs the bait at the end of his line and
text: spits on it. Then, tucking the pole under his arm, he ties a
text: lock of his hair into a knot. He finishes this process with
dialog: another cast.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You got crosses in your heels.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Nails. Shaped liked crosses.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: What for?
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Ward off evil spirits. A man I
dialog: called an Indian but was Meskin
dialog: said they were Seven-league boots
dialog: worn by the seventh son of a
dialog: seventh son. Told me it'd turn me
dialog: into a werewolf but that's a lie.
dialog: I don't know nothin' about that.
text: Ellis, confused, won't take his eyes off the man.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: They just good luck, but so far
dialog: they ain't been workin' too well.
dialog: (missing tooth smile)
dialog: What's your name?
text: Mud seems easy to smile, which softens his otherwise coarse
text: look. His words spill from the mouth rapidly, without much
text: thought for punctuation. Neckbone, emboldened by these
text: facts, steps forward to answer.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: I'm Neckbone, he's Ellis, and
dialog: mister you may be stone ass crazy
dialog: but I know you're not the owner of
dialog: that boat, not for nine tenths of
dialog: nothin'.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Neckbone? That's a real handle
dialog: son. Where ya'll from?
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: What do you care where we're from?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: DeWitt.
text: Neckbone looks at Ellis, frustrated by his friend.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Arkansas boys. Ya'll had me
text: worried for a second.
text: Mud, pleased by this news, tucks the fishing pole under his
text: arm and holds out a hand to shake. Ellis stares at the hand,
text: unsure. He takes it reluctantly.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: We s'posed to know you?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I doubt it. I grew up `round here,
dialog: but I've been gone awhile.
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Where around here?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Different places. Spent a lot of
text: time back up near the White.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You know Shelly's Oxbow?
text: Neckbone can't believe his friend is offering this up.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Ellis. We gotta go.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I know it. Guy named Tom
dialog: Blankenship used to live back in
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
text: He still does. His boat's cross
dialog: from mine.
text: Mud smiles.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Ain't that somethin'.
text: In one motion, Mud flicks his cigarette away and grabs a pack
text: out of his shirt pocket.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: I like you two. You remind me of
dialog: me. And seeing how you boys are
dialog: from Arkansas and we know some
dialog: people and sounds like we all from
dialog: the same place I'd say we can make
dialog: a deal here about somethin'.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: A deal for what?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Food. Food for a boat.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: This guy's a bum Ellis. Come on.
text: Mud's smile vanishes. Neckbone begins to walk off but
text: begrudgingly stops when Ellis starts back in.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Why don't you go get your own food?
dialog: 13.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I would if I could, but I told
dialog: somebody I'd meet `em here. So I'm
dialog: stuck for now and what I got's
dialog: runnin' low.
text: Neckbone walks back and pulls Ellis by the arm.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: He's a bum Ellis, let's go.
text: Mud lays a serious look down on Neckbone.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I'm no bum. I got money. You can
dialog: call me a hobo `cause a hobo'll
dialog: work for his living and you can
dialog: call me homeless `cause that's true
dialog: for now, but if you call me a bum
dialog: again I'll have to teach you
dialog: somethin' about respect that your
dialog: daddy never did.
text: Neckbone's confidence recedes. Ellis stands his ground.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: When they show up, you'll leave?
text: Mud begins fishing again.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: And when you leave, that boat's
dialog: ours?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Yeah.
text: Ellis studies Mud's face, clothes, tattoos. He's thinking
text: about it. Mud pauses from fishing to make eye contact.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm in a tight spot. I just need a
dialog: little help.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: We gotta go.
text: With that, Ellis turns to leave. The boys walk briskly back
text: to their boat. Ellis looks over his shoulder to see Mud
text: making another cast with his fishing pole.
scene_heading: 18 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - MOMENTS LATER 18
text: Ellis motors them away from the island.
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You get his name?!
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: No!
text: Ellis looks back. Mud has disappeared.
scene_heading: 19 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DAY 19
text: Senior heaves an enormous, white cooler into the bed of his
text: weathered pick-up truck.
text: The truck is parked at an angle on a concrete boat ramp next
text: to their houseboat. The bed of the truck is jam-packed with
text: six of the big, white coolers.
text: The SOUND of a dirt bike rattles through the trees. Senior
text: looks up, wiping his brow with a handkerchief.
text: Ellis leaps out of the treeline and runs to the pick-up. His
text: hands hit his knees, out of breath.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: Where you been?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Neck and I got caught up helpin'
dialog: Galen.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: You're s'posed to be helpin' me. I
dialog: had to load this myself.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I know, I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: Just get in the back. Can't be
dialog: later than we are.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Yessir.
text: Senior flips up the tailgate. Ellis hops up the wheel well
text: and into the bed of the truck. He steadies himself on one of
text: the coolers as his father pulls away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DEWITT/MONTAGE - DAY
speaker_heading: SERIES OF IMAGES:
dialog: 15.
dialog: 
text: 20 -Ellis looks around as he rides in the bed of the pick-up 20
text: truck. He's propped up on a cooler against the back window.
text: The truck works its way down a two-lane highway.
text: A20 -Driving, they pass a marina junkyard filled with old boats A20
text: and sailing paraphernalia.

scene_heading: 21 EXT. SONIC DRIVE-IN - DAY 21
text: Ellis sits in the bed of the truck eating a chili dog.
text: Senior is up front wolfing down a cheeseburger.
text: A GROUP of TEENAGERS are gathered around a CLUSTER of parked
text: cars in the corner of the lot. They meander between the
text: vehicles, smoking, gossiping, passing around a bottle of
text: Boone's Farm. Ellis watches them.
text: MAY PEARL(16) appears in the middle of the Group laughing
text: with her GIRLFRIENDS. She's pretty and physically more
dialog: mature looking than Ellis.
text: He watches as a SKINNY KID takes his ballcap off and puts it
text: on May Pearl's head. She sniffs the cap, gags and tosses it
text: back at him. Her friends laugh.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: Let's go son.
text: Ellis crumples the wrapper to his finished hotdog and jumps
text: down from the bed of the truck.
scene_heading: 22 I/E. SENIOR'S TRUCK/TWO-LANE ROAD - MOVING - DAY 22
text: Ellis rides up front with his father.
text: Senior is a reserved man, older than Ellis' mother by several
text: years. He's got thinning hair under the cap that only leaves
text: his head when he sleeps.
text: He reaches into his shirt pocket and fishes out a fold of
text: cash. He slips out a five dollar bill and hands it to Ellis.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: It's s'posed to be ten.
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: It's ten you do your share. I

text: Ellis begrudgingly stuffs the five in his jeans.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You drop me at Neck's?
text: Senior checks his pants pockets, feels around under his seat.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: Hadn't you seen enougha him today?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Said he had something for me.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: You see anymore Ding Dongs over
dialog: there?
text: Ellis checks under his seat and pulls out a half-empty box of

speaker_heading: ELLIS

speaker_heading: SENIOR

speaker_heading: ELLIS

text: Rhonda" plays off a record inside.
text: Senior's truck pulls away as Ellis walks up the entrance to
dialog: the trailer park.
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I came by for that book.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: What book?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You said Galen had a book might
dialog: help me out.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Aw, yeah. We gotta give it a
dialog: minute. You hear that music?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: That means he's doin' it. That's
dialog: his doin' it song.
text: Ellis takes a seat next to Neckbone. They listen to the
text: song, slightly craning their necks to pick up on any other
text: sounds. There are none.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You know who it is?
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Whoever's drivin' that white Dodge.
text: Neckbone motions to a beat up Dodge Shadow in the yard.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You tell Galen 'bout this morning?
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Nah. You tell anybody?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: That guy was crazy.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Maybe. I don't know. I think he
dialog: just needed some help.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Well he can swim his ass off that
dialog: island and get some.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I think I'm gonna go back, take him
dialog: some food.
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Why?
text: Suddenly, the music from inside stops. Footsteps approaching
text: and the trailer door flies open, almost hitting the boys.
text: A GIRL(28) bursts out down the steps, straight to her car.
text: She wears tight jean-shorts and is buttoning a white shirt.
text: She stops and turns back to the boys.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: You're Neckbone right?
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: You look like a good enough kid. A
dialog: word of advice, don't grow up to be
dialog: like your shit heel uncle.
text: The boys can't take their eyes off her cleavage revealed
text: under her half-buttoned shirt. A necklace with three
text: misshapen pearls hangs from her neck.
speaker_heading: GIRL (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey!
text: She snaps the boys' attention up to her eyes.
speaker_heading: GIRL (CONT'D)
dialog: You hear me? You treat a woman
dialog: like a princess. Got it?!
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Yeah.
text: The trailer door opens and GALEN(36) emerges. He's a big,
text: lumbering guy wearing a full-body wet suit pulled halfway
text: down. A faded mermaid tattooed in the middle of his chest.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Come on baby.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I'M A GODDAMN PRINCESS!!!
text: The Girl yanks off the necklace and hurls it at Galen. He
text: brushes fingers through his thick mustache.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: That's uncalled for.
text: He walks out to her. She heads for the Dodge Shadow.
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALEN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TRAILING OFF)
dialog: A lot of people are comfortable
dialog: with that kind of thing in the
dialog: bedroom. Some people aren't. We
dialog: know that about you now...
text: Ellis sees one of the misshapen pearls at his feet. He picks
text: it up and holds it to the sun.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Pearls. Galen finds 'em in some of
dialog: the mussel shells. Most of 'em
dialog: ain't worth dick, but he likes to
dialog: make necklaces for the girls. Come
dialog: on, let's get that book.
text: Neckbone walks into the trailer. Ellis stands up and
text: retrieves the other two pearls out of the dirt. He crams
text: them in his pocket and follows Neckbone inside.
scene_heading: 24 INT. NECKBONE'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS 24
text: The trailer is decorated in the filth of a true bachelor pad.
text: Neckbone makes his way to a bedroom. He tosses clothes and
text: trash around to get to what he's looking for. A cardboard
text: box. He pulls the box onto the bed and sifts through.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: I don't want you goin' back out
dialog: there by yourself. That river's
dialog: scary enough with two people, and I
dialog: don't trust that guy.
speaker_heading: (FINDS SOMETHING)
dialog: Here it is.
text: He takes out a hardback book. The slip reads, "The Confident
text: Confidant, communicating with the opposite sex."
speaker_heading: NECKBONE (CONT'D)
dialog: Galen said this really turned
dialog: things around for him.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Thanks.
text: Ellis flips delicately through the manual.
scene_heading: 25 EXT. NECKBONE'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS 25
text: Galen watches as the Girl's Dodge Shadow pulls away. The
text: boys step out of the trailer.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: You really going back out there?
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I think it's the right thing to do.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Well...I'll be over in the mornin'
dialog: then.
text: Galen, his thumbs tucked under his armpits, walks back to the
text: trailer. He passes the boys and notices the self-help book
text: in Ellis' hands.
speaker_heading: GALEN
speaker_heading: (WITHOUT STOPPING)
dialog: That's a good book. Be sure you do
text: the worksheets in the back. Let's
dialog: get some dinner Neck.
text: Galen's gone inside.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: I'll call 'fore I come.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: All right.
text: Neckbone follows his uncle into the trailer. Ellis flips
text: through his new book as he heads out of the trailer park.
scene_heading: 26 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 26
text: By the time Ellis makes it to his houseboat, the sun has
text: disappeared behind the horizon.
text: He crosses the make-shift plank and enters through a screen
text: door by the carport.
scene_heading: 27 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 27
text: Mary Lee flinches when she sees Ellis come through the door.
text: Her face is flushed. Senior stands toe to toe with her.
text: They stare at Ellis, who has paused in the doorway. He
text: doesn't say anything, just looks curiously at his parents.
text: Senior storms past Ellis and is out the door.
text: Ellis steps further into the den. Mary Lee tries to
text: straighten herself, patting down her hair and dabbing at her
text: eyes with the back of her hand.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You okay momma?
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
text: She walks into the kitchen keeping Ellis at her back. She
text: turns on the sink and begins scrubbing at a dish.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you need me to fix you
dialog: somethin'? Have you eaten?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I'm all right.
text: Mary Lee shuts off the water and lets the dish rest in the
text: sink. She turns to Ellis.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: I'm gonna turn in.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Okay momma.
text: Mary Lee slips past him and enters her bedroom. The door
text: closes and Ellis is left alone in the den. It's quiet. He
text: waits, looking at the door his mother just closed.
text: Ellis walks into the kitchen and eases open a cabinet door.
text: Checking over his shoulder, he zips his backpack open and
text: fills it with CANNED FOOD.
scene_heading: 28 EXT. TOM BLANKENSHIP'S HOUSEBOAT - DAY 28
text: Hands pump the stock of a high-powered pellet gun.
text: TOM BLANKENSHIP(67), white hair cut high and tight wearing a
text: short-sleeve button up, takes careful aim with the pellet
dialog: gun.
text: Tom sits in a lawn chair atop the roof of his houseboat. He
text: squeezes his left eye shut.
text: A snake's head pokes out of the water about 15 yards off his
text: boat. The head makes for a target no bigger than a thumb.
text: Tom's left eye snaps open and he fires. The pellet rips
text: through the snake's head. Its body floats to the surface.
text: Tom takes account of his shot as he pumps the air rifle. He
text: scans the water for more targets.
scene_heading: 29 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 29
text: Ellis watches Tom Blankenship from across the bayou. Tom's
text: boat sits directly opposite Ellis', separated by 30 yards of
text: muddy brown water.
text: Ellis leans against a post under the carport. His backpack
text: resting at his feet, he holds the Walkie-Talkie in his hand.
text: Senior works behind him washing utensils in the outdoor sink.
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: What do you know about Tom
dialog: Blankenship?
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: What?
text: Senior doesn't turn around from his work at the sink.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Mr. Blankenship, what do you know
dialog: about him?
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I don't know. He looks lonely over
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: Some people move to this river to
dialog: work on it, and some move here to
dialog: be left alone.
text: Senior makes his way to the ice machine and begins scooping
text: ice into a large white cooler.
text: Mary Lee emerges from the houseboat dressed for work, a
text: secretarial job. Senior stops what he's doing to watch her.
text: She walks over to Ellis.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: Let's sit down for dinner tonight
dialog: okay? Will you make it home by
dialog: seven?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Yes ma'am.
text: She walks off the boat without a glance in Senior's
text: direction. He trails her with his eyes before going back to
text: digging in the ice.
text: A29 Ellis looks back at Tom. The Walkie SQUAWKS out several A29
text: loud BEEPS. Ellis crams it in his backpack and runs off the
dialog: boat.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Bye Dad.
text: Senior holds a hand up but never looks up from his work.
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 30 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY 30
text: Water laps at the shore of the island. Ellis and Neckbone
text: drag their boat onto the muddy bank.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Where you think he's at?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I guess we should try the boat.
text: They head for the treeline.
scene_heading: 31 EXT. BASE OF BOAT TREE - DAY 31
text: The boys emerge from the woods, their attention focused up to
text: the boat hovering in the tree some twenty feet above them.
text: Ellis notices the remnants of a fire on the ground. A log
text: pushed up next to it for a seat. Ellis kicks at the ash.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Looks like he made camp.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: (looking up to the boat)
dialog: You think he's up there?
speaker_heading: MUD (O.S.)
dialog: I didn't know if ya'll'd come back.
text: The boys spin around. They survey the woods but no one's
text: there. Their eyes drift up to find Mud sitting in a tree,
text: his legs dangle off a branch.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: What're you doin'?
text: Mud bounds down, stepping from limb to trunk to the ground.
dialog: It's an agile move.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I try to never sleep in the same
dialog: place twice. What you got there?
text: Mud motions with his head to the backpack in Ellis' hand.
text: Ellis holds it out to him.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I brought you some food.
text: Mud looks at the backpack, but doesn't move.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Go on.
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
text: Mud takes the backpack and walks over to the ashes of his
text: campfire. He squats with his back to the boys and unzips the
text: bag. Hunkered down, Mud's shirttail rides up over the lip of
text: his jeans revealing a PISTOL at his backside.
text: Ellis sees this and motions to Neckbone. The boys stand
dialog: their ground, cautious.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I owe you boys.
text: Keeping the bag in hand, Mud takes a seat on the stump behind
text: him. He pulls out a selection of canned food; pumpkin pie
text: filling, evaporated milk, green beans. He grabs the beans.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: I was gonna try runnin' a trot line
dialog: today. See how far that'd get me.
text: Mud removes a good-sized folding knife from his pocket and
text: makes short order of the can lid. He tips the can up letting
text: the beans fall into his mouth. Juice flows down his cheeks.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (A MOUTHFUL)
dialog: I'd been rationin' what I
dialog: had...green bean never tasted so
dialog: good.
text: The can is quickly emptied, juice running down Mud's chin.
text: He straightens his back, choking down the final swallow. He
text: sees the boys staring at him and catches himself.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: I appreciate it.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: What you got that pistol for?
text: Mud wipes off his chin, realizing the boys have been studying
text: him. He closes the knife and tucks it in his pocket.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: For protection.
text: Mud gets up, heads for a duffel bag tucked under a nearby
text: tree. The boys pivot, keeping Mud in front of them. Mud
dialog: notices.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Ya'll don't have to be afraid of
dialog: me. I have two ways to protect
dialog: myself out here. This shirt, and
dialog: this pistol.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: There are fierce powers at work in
dialog: the world boys. Good, evil, poor
dialog: luck, best luck. Men have to take
dialog: advantage where they can.
text: Mud removes a spool of fishing line and a small plastic
text: tackle box. He scoops up the duffel bag and heads into the
dialog: woods.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Ya'll comin'?
text: 32 Neckbone looks to Ellis, who walks after Mud into the 32
dialog: trees.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Who's this guy you're waitin' on?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I'm not waitin' for a guy. I'm
dialog: waitin' on my girlfriend. Juniper.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Is she hot?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: She's beautiful.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
speaker_heading: (COUGHING)
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Best lookin' girl I've ever seen.
text: Hands down. Blonde hair. Long
dialog: legs. She's like a dream you don't
dialog: want to wake up from. She's got
text: birds tattooed on her hands, here.
text: Mud stops, points to the area on the top of his right hand,
text: between his thumb and pointer finger.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Nightingales. Good luck birds.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: That a good luck snake?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: No it is not.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: I hate snakes.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: That's because God made them for us
dialog: to fear.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a thing we knew to be afraid
dialog: of before we even got into this
dialog: world.
text: 33 They emerge from the woods onto the downstream coast of 33
text: the island. It looks different than the other shoreline.
text: A large swath of red clay angles sharply into the water.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Cherokee would wrap snake skin
dialog: around their pregnant women's
dialog: bellies. Induce labor, scare the
dialog: child out. Here.
text: He fetches a length of rope out of the duffel bag and tosses
dialog: it to Neckbone.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Set that `round your bed at night.
dialog: Snake won't cross braided rope.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (nods to Mud's tattoo)
dialog: So what's that for then?
text: Mud walks to a tree branch that has grown out over the bank,
text: nearly resting in the water. He sets a trot line from it.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: A reminder. Don't get bit. I was
text: 10, swimmin' `bout a mile up from
dialog: here. Me and Juniper. Sonofabitch
dialog: swam right up under me, bit me just
dialog: below the armpit. June got me out,
dialog: got me to a clinic. Doctor said I
dialog: shoulda been dead in twenty
dialog: minutes. Took us an hour just to
dialog: get back to town.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: What'd they do?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Gave me antivenom. For a cotton
dialog: mouth. See here.
text: Mud shows the tattoo on top of his right hand. He points out
text: the two cotton blossoms bulging from the snake's mouth.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Problem with antivenom is they can
dialog: only give it to you once. It's
dialog: made from horse blood. Your body
dialog: would reject it a second time. The
dialog: cure ends up being more dangerous
dialog: than the poison.
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: What happens if you get bit again?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I die, or just sweat it out.
text: Neckbone, not buying it, looks at Ellis and taps his watch.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: We gotta go help Neck's uncle.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You never said your name.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Mud. You can call me Mud.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Mud?
speaker_heading: MUD
speaker_heading: M-U-D.
text: Neckbone tosses the braided rope back. It lands at his feet.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Here you go, Mud. I think you need
dialog: that worse than I do.
speaker_heading: MUD
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: I'll be all right.
text: The boys disappear back into the trees.
scene_heading: 34 INT. GARY'S ELECTRIC SHOP - DAY 34
text: A switch clicks "ON". BLINDING LIGHT emits from two FLOOD
text: LAMPS encased in plastic shells. The switch clicks "OFF" and
text: the lights dim to the dull orange glow of their filaments.
speaker_heading: GALEN
text: They look bright enough.
text: The owner of the shop, an ELECTRICIAN(62), holds up a metal
text: bar with the lamps affixed by bolts at either end.
speaker_heading: ELECTRICIAN
dialog: Should be. I rigged DC power up
dialog: through marine batteries. Makes it
dialog: portable. Gave you a rigging bar
dialog: to set on your shoulder.
dialog: 28.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: So you really think these'll work
dialog: under water?
speaker_heading: ELECTRICIAN
dialog: In theory.
scene_heading: 35 EXT. GARY'S ELECTRIC/PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 35
text: Ellis and Neckbone sit on the tailgate of Galen's truck. The
text: Gary's Electric sign hangs behind them.
text: Neckbone focuses on a carburetor in his hand. Ellis stares
text: across the street at the Piggly Wiggly parking lot where the
text: roving GROUP of TEENAGERS have collected for the afternoon.
text: The Teenagers are up to their typical gossip and minor
text: offenses. Ellis has zeroed in on May Pearl again.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: You start datin' I bet her dad'll
dialog: give you a free pick-up truck.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I don't care about that.
text: Ellis watches as the same Skinny Kid from before tries to
text: flirt with her. She's not having it. He pops her bra strap
text: before landing the final straw, a smack on her ass. She
text: turns and swats at him.
text: Seeing this, Ellis is on his feet and crossing the street.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: What's goin' on?
text: Ellis doesn't turn back. Neckbone reluctantly sets the
text: carburetor down and follows.
scene_heading: 36 EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 36
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: Stop it!
text: She shoves the Skinny Kid, but he continues laughing.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (O.S.)
dialog: Hey.
text: Ellis taps the Kid on the shoulder. As he turns, Ellis
text: PUNCHES him in the face.
text: The Kid, completely taken off guard, stumbles and trips to
text: the ground. Some older, tougher looking GUYS see this and
text: begin laughing at him.
dialog: 29.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLDER KID
dialog: Holy shit Pryor, get off your ass.
text: Pryor collects himself and gets off the ground. Ego bruised,
text: he walks off mumbling. The Older Kids keep riding him.
dialog: May Pearl sizes up Ellis.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: You didn't have to do that.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: He was messin' with you.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: Do I know you?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I'm Ellis. That's Neck.
text: Neckbone waves by wagging a finger in the air.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: We went to Junior High with you,
dialog: before you went to High School.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: How old are you?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Fourteen.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: Fourteen? You know you just
dialog: punched a Senior?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: You think you're pretty tough.
text: Ellis shrugs, not wanting to deny it.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm May Pearl.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: What else do you know?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Nothin'.
text: She smiles.
dialog: 30.
dialog: 
text: Something catches Neckbone's attention. He cranes his neck
dialog: forward to get a better look.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Son of a bitch...Ellis?
text: Ellis breaks away from his conversation with May Pearl.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Look.
text: Neckbone nods to a cheap motel called the EXECUTIVE INN
text: located on the opposite side of the Piggly Wiggly parking
dialog: lot.
text: JUNIPER(35), a truly beautiful woman squeezed into tight
text: jeans and a low cut top, makes her way from the motel parking
dialog: lot to the Piggly Wiggly.
text: She passes in front of the cluster of Teenagers. All of the
text: boys have taken note. Some cat calls from the crowd.
text: Juniper, without facing the Teenagers, gives them the finger.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE (CONT'D)
dialog: You ever seen that girl before?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: No. Did you see her hands?
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: Hello?
text: Ellis catches himself and turns back to May Pearl.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Sorry. We know a guy we think
dialog: might know that girl.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: Oh.
text: A GIRLFRIEND(17) of May Pearl's calls out to her.
speaker_heading: GIRLFRIEND
dialog: May Pearl! Let's go!
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: Okay!
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I guess I'll see you.
dialog: 30A.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: If you can find my phone number,
dialog: you should call it.
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I can find it.
text: May Pearl walks over to her friend. Ellis watches her go,
text: but then remembers Juniper. He turns to Neckbone.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Where'd she go?
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Into the Piggly Wiggly. She came
dialog: from the motel.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I'm gonna go see if it's her.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: I gotta go check on Galen. We'll
dialog: pick you up out front.
text: Ellis heads for the Piggly Wiggly. Neckbone calls after him.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE (CONT'D)
dialog: What'd she say?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Wants me to call her.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Shit.
scene_heading: 37 INT. PIGGLY WIGGLY - DAY 37
text: Ellis walks past the grocery aisles looking for the girl. He
text: spots her by the potato chips. He tucks behind a display of
text: stacked cans and watches.
text: Juniper reaches for a bag of chips, birds tattooed on her
text: hand. Ellis smiles. It's her, and she really is beautiful.
text: She turns down the aisle, coming right for him. He pretends
text: to peruse the canned food and notices that it's a big display
text: of Beanie Weenie. He grabs two handfuls as she passes.
text: Ellis takes the cans to an open register. As a CASHIER scans
text: and bags his items, he cranes his neck looking for her.
text: She's disappeared into another section of the store.
text: Ellis pays in crumpled cash. A horn HONKS. He sees Galen's
text: truck idling out front. He grabs the bag and runs out.
scene_heading: 38 EXT. GALEN'S TRUCK/PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 38
text: Neckbone waits at the open passenger door.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Was it her?

speaker_heading: ELLIS

speaker_heading: NECKBONE
speaker_heading: (LOOKING BACK)
dialog: No he wasn't.
scene_heading: 39 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 39
text: By the time Ellis makes it back home, the sun has gone from
text: the sky. He crosses the makeshift plank to board his house.
speaker_heading: SENIOR (O.S.)
dialog: Home for dinner?
text: Ellis is startled by his father's voice. Senior sits in a
text: lawn chair under the eaves of the carport. He's hidden in
text: shadow, save for a red glow from the tip of his cigarette.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: What you hidin' for?
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: I ain't hidin'.
text: He notices Senior tip back a pint of liquor and set it at his
text: feet. Ellis opens the screen door leading inside.
speaker_heading: SENIOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Come over here.
text: Ellis lets the door fall shut and skulks over to a beam that
text: supports the carport. He leans into it.
speaker_heading: SENIOR (CONT'D)
dialog: You know I love you?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Yessir. I know.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: I work you hard 'cause life is

speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Yessir.
speaker_heading: SENIOR

speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: What's that mean?
dialog: 33.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SENIOR
text: She seems set on it. Wants to
dialog: separate. She may ask me for a

text: This hits Ellis like a ton of bricks. He rights himself.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: What's that mean for me?
speaker_heading: SENIOR

dialog: Enjoy it while you live on it,
dialog: 'cause this way a life isn't long
dialog: for this world. Game and fish's
dialog: 'bout made certain of that.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: But you and me can still live out
dialog: here. Game and fish can't take
dialog: your boat. Not while you're still
dialog: in it.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: The houseboat's in your mother's
dialog: name. Her daddy give it to her not
dialog: me. If she wants to leave it, Game
dialog: and Fish has ever' right to take
dialog: this boat apart board by board.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: But that ain't right. You work
dialog: outta here. We got the ice
dialog: machine, the traps. What are we
dialog: supposed to do?
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: Like I said, this is your mother's
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I ain't no townie. I ain't livin'
dialog: like that.
text: Senior takes a slow pull off the bottle. Ellis' mind races.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: I've let you down. A man should be
dialog: in charge of his own affairs, but I
dialog: haven't worked it like that.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: But ya'll are married. Ya'll are
dialog: s'posed to love each other.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: I don't know about that anymore.
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
text: Ellis is speechless. After a moment, he turns to go inside.
speaker_heading: SENIOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Ellis?
text: He stops and turns back to his father. Senior tries to
text: express a sentiment he doesn't have the words for. Ellis
text: continues inside.
scene_heading: 40 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DEN - CONTINUOUS 40
text: Mary Lee sits hunched at the made dinner table. She runs her
text: finger around the rim of a half empty glass of iced tea.
text: It's a full spread with fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and a
text: salad. The table is set for two. She's been waiting.
text: Ellis lets the front door slam shut behind him. She sits up.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: You're late.
text: Ellis doesn't speak, he doesn't look at her. He enters his
text: room and shuts the door.
text: He's heard the news and she knows it. Mary Lee's face drops.
scene_heading: 41 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - CONTINUOUS 41
text: Ellis slings his backpack down, pacing the small room. He
text: stops and leans his forehead against the door. The sound of
text: his Mother clearing the table seeps through.
text: He kicks the door, cracking its shitty composite wood. His
text: face flushed and his breathing heavy, he slides to a seat.
text: On the verge of hyperventilating, he stares out the dark
text: bedroom window trying to get control of his breathing.
text: Ellis looks at his backpack. It has spilled open revealing a
text: can of Beanie Weenie. Ellis studies the can.
text: He looks back to the window. His breathing settles.
text: Quickly, he scoops up the backpack and heads out the window.
scene_heading: 42 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - NIGHT 42
text: It's pitch black. The only light comes from the moon's
text: reflection off the surface of the water.
text: Ellis, eyes wide, navigates the small boat through choppy
text: black water.
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 43 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - NIGHT 43
text: Ellis struggles to pull the boat onto shore. Leaving it half
text: in the water, Ellis looks around. No sign of Mud. He sizes
text: up the dark woods.
text: He removes a flashlight from his backpack and shines it down
text: the shorelines. Still nothing. Ellis follows the beam of
text: light into the woods.
scene_heading: 44 EXT. ISLAND WOODS - NIGHT 44
text: Ellis stands at the creek that cuts through the island.
text: He can make out a campfire glowing through trees in the
text: distance. A RUSTLING behind him. He swings the light
text: around. Nothing but trees.
text: Ellis takes a deep breath. Finding the log to cross, he
text: shines his light down into the creek. The nest of snakes
dialog: show their backs.
scene_heading: 45 EXT. BASE OF BOAT TREE - NIGHT 45
text: A campfire burns at the base of the tree. The firelight
text: illuminates the belly of the boat that rests 20 feet above.
text: Ellis, his flashlight off, crouches behind a tree and watches
text: the campsite. There is no one there. He looks into the
text: black forest behind him, thinks of going back.
text: A twig snaps in the distance and he's back on guard. Ellis
text: nervously scans the woods before finally stepping into the
text: light of the campfire.
text: The SOUND of a gun's hammer drawing back CLICKS behind him.
text: Ellis freezes.
text: Mud emerges from the trees, a .45 extended toward Ellis'
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Ellis?
text: Ellis, still frozen, slowly turns to him. Mud huffs out a
text: laugh and drops the pistol to his side.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: What're you doin' out here?
text: Ellis slowly raises the backpack in his hand.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I got you some Beanie Weenie.
text: Mud tucks the pistol into his jeans and accepts the backpack.
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I appreciate that, but I didn't
dialog: expect you out here at night.
text: Mud takes a seat on the log and transfers the cans into his
text: own duffel bag. He holds up a can of the Beanie Weenie.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at that. You really know how
dialog: to do somebody right. I didn't
dialog: wanna say anything before, but it's
dialog: hard to make a meal out of pumpkin
dialog: pie filling.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: That's all my mom had.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I'm not complainin'.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Can I get one of those?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: They're yours to begin with.
text: Ellis sits as Mud hands him a can. They eat.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I missed my dinner.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: That's good right?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
speaker_heading: (MOUTH FULL)
dialog: You been out here too long.
text: Mud laughs. Finishing the can, he takes a half-smoked
text: cigarette from his shirt pocket. He pulls a twig from the
text: fire for a light.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: The girl you're waitin' on, she's
dialog: your girlfriend?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Juniper. Yeah.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: How'd you meet her?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: We grew up together.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Do you love her?
dialog: 37.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I do. The first time I saw her was
dialog: on this river. Just up from here.
dialog: She saved my life.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
text: From the snake bite.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: That's right. I was younger than
dialog: you are now, but when I came to in
dialog: the hospital and she was there, it
dialog: was like the world split open, came
dialog: back together new. Everything
dialog: changed. I knew from then on I'd
dialog: do anything for her.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Why aren't ya'll married?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I've asked. Several times.
dialog: Marriage just doesn't work for some
dialog: people.
dialog: Ellis thinks on this.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: My dad says my parents may be
dialog: gettin' a divorce.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I'm sorry to hear that.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: If it happens, and my mom moves us
dialog: off the river, they say the
dialog: government can come take our boat
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Who says that?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Everybody. They passed a law so
dialog: you can't sell your boat. Can't
dialog: rent it. If the owner leaves, they
dialog: got you. Game and Fish want `em
text: off the river.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I've never been one to trust the
dialog: government on matters of personal
dialog: property, but if your parents love
dialog: each other, there's always a
dialog: chance.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 38.

speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: People just sometimes forget why
dialog: they fell in love in the first

text: Ellis watches Mud toke the cigarette nub. He's really
dialog: getting all he can from it.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I saw Juniper today.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I didn't talk to her, but she had
text: the birds tattooed on her hand like
dialog: you said. You were right. She's
dialog: pretty.
text: Mud stands, surprised by the news. He walks to the other
text: side of the fire so his back is to the boy.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Where'd you see her?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: At the Piggly Wiggly. I think
dialog: she's stayin' at a motel by there.
dialog: The Executive Inn.
text: Mud looks at Ellis through the fire. He takes a drag and
text: smiles at the boy. The hole from his missing tooth shows.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: That's good news. Real good news.
text: Mud paces, slowly. He's thinking.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Does she know you're out here?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: No. We picked another place to
dialog: meet. Couple days from now.
text: Mud walks back to the log and sits.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You wanna go tonight? I can give
dialog: you a ride up river.
text: Mud looks at Ellis, nodding.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Tomorrow. I'll go tomorrow.
dialog: 39.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You need me to come get you?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Naw. I can manage. Hell I got out
dialog: here didn't I?
text: Ellis smiles.
text: They sit in silence. Ellis stares up at the boat hanging
text: over them, its peeling hull lit by the firelight.
text: Mud pinches the ash from the end of his cigarette, places the
text: stub back in his shirt pocket. Noticing Ellis, Mud tilts his
text: head back to take in the boat.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a helluva thing.
text: Mud pauses, his mind working on something.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Helluva thing.

scene_heading: 46 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - MORNING 46
text: Mary Lee knocks on her way into the bedroom.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: Time to get up.
text: She begins picking clothes off the floor. Ellis, in bed,
text: raises up on his elbows. He's tired from a late night.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: It's Saturday.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: I'm going to Wal-Mart. I need you
dialog: to come with me.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
speaker_heading: (MOANING)
dialog: Mom.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE

text: She pulls the covers off of him.
scene_heading: 47 I/E. MARY LEE'S CAR/INTERSTATE - DAY 47
text: The two ride in an awkward silence.
dialog: 40.
dialog: 
text: Ellis stares at the farmland passing by outside as Mary Lee
text: steers the compact Toyota down a four-lane interstate.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: Ellis I know what your father told
dialog: you last night. That's not what I
dialog: wanted. I wanted to sit you down
dialog: and talk about it.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: What do you wanna talk about? You
dialog: want to leave and that means they
dialog: can tear up our house.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: I've spent my whole life on that
dialog: boat. I don't think it's too much
dialog: to ask for your...
text: Mary Lee is interrupted by a line of traffic backed up in
text: front of her. She slows to a stop.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh no. I hope no one's hurt.
text: There are flashing police lights up ahead. Ellis tries to
text: see what's going on but can't make anything out past the line
text: of cars. They inch forward.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm just saying there are two sides
dialog: to this. I haven't made up my mind
dialog: about anything because I want you
dialog: to be involved in my decision, but
dialog: I need a change Ellis. I deserve
dialog: one.
text: As they approach the flashing lights, they see three State
text: Trooper vehicles parked to funnel traffic down to one lane.
text: The STATE TROOPERS stop each car, checking the trunks.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE (CONT'D)
dialog: I think they're searching people.
text: A Trooper signals Mary Lee to pull up to a stop. Two other
text: Troopers approach her vehicle. The first begins looking in
text: her back windows as the second leans down to speak to her.
text: She lowers her window.
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: Can you open the trunk please
dialog: ma'am?
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: Of course.
dialog: 41.
dialog: 
text: Mary Lee pulls the lever by her knee, and the second Trooper
text: walks around the back of the car.
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: Have you picked up or seen any
dialog: hitchhikers today ma'am?
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: No sir.
text: The Trooper produces a flier with a color photo on it.
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: Have you seen this man?
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: No sir.
text: The Trooper leans over and holds the paper out to Ellis.
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: Son, have you seen this man?
text: Ellis looks at the photo. It's of Mud. He looks exactly the
text: same as he did last night, down to the shirt. In the photo,
text: Mud's smiling, revealing his missing tooth.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: We've had reports that he's in this
dialog: area. If you see him, call 9-1-1
dialog: immediately.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: We will officer.
text: The Trooper pulls his head from the window.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: What'd he do?!
text: The Trooper bends back down and looks at Ellis.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (MORE CALM)
dialog: What'd he do?
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: Move along please.
text: Mary Lee pulls forward and speeds back up on the interstate.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE

speaker_heading: (MORE)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY LEE (CONT'D)
dialog: How would you feel about moving
dialog: into town with me?
speaker_heading: (NO ANSWER)
dialog: Please don't tell your father this,
dialog: but I've been looking at a couple
dialog: of places. I know it would be a
dialog: big adjustment for you, but it
dialog: might end up being something you
dialog: like. You know living on the river
dialog: isn't exactly everyone's idea of

text: He looks at her.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you even listening to me?
scene_heading: 48 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - DAY 48
text: Ellis busts through the door, grabs his backpack and is gone.
scene_heading: 49 EXT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 49
text: Ellis is off the houseboat and running up the bank.
text: He heads down the dirt path, grabbing the Walkie Talkie out
text: of his backpack.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: (into the Walkie)
dialog: Neck! Neck, pick up!
scene_heading: 50 EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY 50
text: Ellis removes branches and readies the flat bottom boat to
text: launch. The sound of Neckbone's bike arrives before he does.
text: Neckbone crests the sand covered slope. He dismounts and
text: starts to chain the bike up to a tree trunk.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: So what's the big deal?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: My mom and I were headed to Wal-
text: Mart on 165. There was a roadblock
dialog: with state troopers. They searched
dialog: our car and showed us a picture of
dialog: Mud. They're lookin' for him.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: I knew it! I told you that crazy
dialog: sonofabitch was trouble. Did they
dialog: say what he did?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: No.
dialog: 43.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: So'd you tell `em where he is?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: No. That's why I called you. We
dialog: gotta warn him.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: He's goin' to get Juniper today. I
dialog: went out there last night and told
dialog: him where we saw her. He needs to
dialog: know people are lookin' for him.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: You think he doesn't know that
dialog: already? Jesus Ellis, why do you
dialog: think he's on that island? You
dialog: don't even know what he's wanted
dialog: for.
text: Ellis climbs in the boat and Neckbone yanks his shoulder.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ellis! I'm serious. We don't know
dialog: who this guy is.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: He loves her Neck. He told me.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: I don't give a shit who he loves.
text: Ellis starts the motor and waits for his friend.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: He's not dangerous.
text: Reluctantly, Neckbone throws his leg into the boat.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: It sounds like a shitload of state
dialog: troopers think different.
scene_heading: 51 EXT. BASE OF BOAT TREE - DAY 51
text: Ellis and Neckbone emerge from the woods at Mud's campsite.
text: They scan nearby tree limbs.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: No tellin' where the hell he's been
dialog: sleepin'.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
text: He may already be gone.
dialog: 44.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUD (O.S.)
dialog: Hey!
text: The boys look straight up. Mud leans over the edge of the
text: boat above them.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Up here!
text: Mud drops them a rope with knots tied in it. Ellis starts
text: inching his way up. Neckbone begrudgingly follows.
scene_heading: 52 EXT. BOAT IN TREE - CONTINUOUS 52
text: Ellis pulls himself over the edge of the boat. He finds Mud
text: sitting in the swivel chair behind the steering wheel. He
text: writes in an open spiral notebook with a black Sharpie.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: What are you doin'?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I'm gonna have to go back on our
dialog: deal for the boat. I don't feel
dialog: good about it, but I don't see any
dialog: other way outta what I'm into.
text: Neckbone makes his way on board. Mud has pulled a panel off
text: the steering column. Exposed wires dangle.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: So you know about the state
dialog: troopers?
text: He looks up from his notebook.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: What state troopers?
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: The ones spreadin' your picture all
text: over the place. Stoppin' cars on
dialog: 165 searchin' for your ass.
text: Mud factors this in and then goes back to writing.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I didn't know about that, but it
dialog: doesn't surprise me. There plenty
dialog: of folks lookin' for me right now.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I shot a man. Killed him.
dialog: 45.
dialog: 
text: Mud stands and walks to the back of the boat. The boys' eyes
text: follow him cautiously.
text: Mud lifts a hatch at the back that would typically house the
text: batteries and engine wiring. There's nothing left but a hole
text: into the trees. He makes a note.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry I didn't tell ya'll
dialog: sooner, but I was hopin' to be gone
dialog: before anything came of it. Didn't
dialog: want you involved.
text: Mud turns to really face them for the first time.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Ya'll have been real good to me.
dialog: You're the only friends I got out
dialog: here. If the state troopers have
dialog: 165 blocked, they'll have others
dialog: blocked too. I won't get anywhere
dialog: in a car. I want to try takin'
dialog: this boat down, see if we can get
text: it in the water.
text: Ellis and Neckbone stand their ground. They don't say
text: anything. Mud walks back to the steering column. He drops to
text: his knees and fiddles with the wires.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: With a boat like this I can make it
dialog: to the gulf in two days. I could
dialog: get anywhere from there. But I'd
dialog: need a boat at least this big to
dialog: make it on open water. It's got no
dialog: title, no owner, nobody lookin' for
dialog: it. It's my best shot.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Who'd you kill?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: It was a bad piece of business.
dialog: Ya'll don't need to hear about it.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I need to hear about it.
text: Mud sits up. He looks at Ellis, deciding how much to tell.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Juniper made a mistake. She hooked
dialog: up with a guy. He was no good.
dialog: His name was Hutchins. Family owns
dialog: a chain of restaurants down in
dialog: Texas.
dialog: 46.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Where were you?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I was around, but me and Juniper
dialog: were on the outs. She met this
dialog: Hutchins, he sold her on some lies.
dialog: Got her pregnant. That's when he
dialog: started showin' who he really was.
dialog: He dropped June down a flight of
dialog: stairs after whoopin' her half to
dialog: death. She lost the baby. He made
dialog: it so the doctors think she can't
dialog: have children anymore. There're
dialog: things you can get away with in
dialog: this world and things you can't. I
dialog: tracked him down at a motel just
dialog: outside of San Antonio. He was
dialog: there with another woman. That's
dialog: where it happened.
text: Mud's done with his story. He goes back to the wiring.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: I understand if you can't help me
dialog: anymore, but I need this boat. And
dialog: I need to get it in the water fast.
text: After a moment, he sits up and wipes sweat from his forehead.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: I've made a list. Things we'll
dialog: need. What do ya'll think?
text: Ellis takes time to consider everything. He looks at
text: Neckbone, who has a disgruntled look on his face.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You did it for her? To protect
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Yeah.
text: Ellis nods. Mud looks over at Neckbone, who still has the
text: disgruntled look on his face.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: I think you want us to run around,
dialog: stickin' our necks out, gettin'
dialog: everything you need, just so you
dialog: can take our boat.
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: That's about it.
text: Mud removes a cigarette butt and sparks it with a lighter.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: What do we get out of it?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: What do you want?
text: Neckbone looks to Ellis, judging his bargaining position.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: What about that pistol?
text: Mud eyes the boy, pulling on the nub of cigarette.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I only got two things out here
dialog: worth anything. This shirt...
text: Mud pulls the pistol from the back of his jeans. Neckbone
text: tenses, but relaxes when Mud splays it out on an open palm.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: And this pistol. I can't give you
dialog: the shirt `cause I need it for
dialog: protection, but if you help me get
dialog: this boat in the water, the
dialog: pistol's yours.
text: Neckbone squinches his face in thought, sizing up this trade.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: What kind is it?
speaker_heading: MUD
text: A forty five.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: I guess we could work a deal like
dialog: that.
text: Neckbone steps forward to grab the pistol, but Mud puts it
text: back in his jeans.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: We get this thing floatin' first.
text: Neckbone looks over at Ellis, who shrugs.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: All right then.
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
text: Mud smiles, flashing his missing tooth. He spits in his palm
text: and holds it out to Neckbone. Neckbone, not sure about
text: taking the spit hand, reluctantly shakes.
text: Mud rips a page from the notebook and hands it to Ellis.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Ya'll scrounge what you can off
dialog: this list, but if we're gonna get
dialog: this done right we'll need more
dialog: help. Can you fetch Tom for me?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Tom Blankenship?
text: Mud has smoked down to the filter. He crushes the butt into
text: his palm and puts it back in his shirt pocket.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I was hopin' to let that old
dialog: assassin stay put, but we'll need
dialog: him to get things ya'll can't. Can
dialog: you find him?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I know where he lives, but I've
dialog: never spoke to him.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Just tell him my name. He'll know
dialog: you're serious.
text: Ellis folds the list up. He and Neckbone start down the rope
text: as Mud goes back to the wiring.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Boys?
speaker_heading: (THEY PAUSE)
dialog: Thanks.
text: Ellis nods.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Don't lose my pistol.
text: They continue down the rope. Mud continues his work.
scene_heading: 53 EXT. SHELLY'S OXBOW - DAY 53
text: Ellis steers to the southern mouth of Shelly's Oxbow, the
text: bend in the river that holds he and Tom Blankenship's
dialog: houseboats, among others.
text: He grounds the boat just shy of entering the Oxbow and steps
text: over Neckbone to hop onto the bank.
dialog: 49.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You comin'?
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: I'll watch the boat.
text: Ellis scans the woods that populate the patch of land wedged
dialog: between the river and this short tributary.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ellis?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Be careful. Galen always said that
dialog: old man's crazy.
text: Neckbone keeps his seat as Ellis darts into the woods
scene_heading: 54 EXT. TOM'S WOODS - DAY 54
text: Ellis prowls around the small pine trees and bushes. He
text: pauses, seeing the entrance to Tom Blankenship's boat.
text: Something moves on the houseboat. Ellis hunkers down behind
text: a bush. He sees Tom wrapping cable onto a metal spool.
text: Ellis is nervous. He checks over his shoulder, nothing but
text: woods. When he looks back to the boat, Tom is gone. In a

text: Taking a deep breath, Ellis steps out from the cover of the

speaker_heading: TOM (O.S.)
dialog: Why you huntin' me?
text: Ellis flinches. He turns to find Tom Blankenship standing at
text: the edge of the boat.
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: You deaf boy? I said why're you
dialog: huntin' me?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I ain't huntin you.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What's your business here?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I came to find you. I got a

dialog: 50.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You're Senior's boy.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Yessir.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What you got to say he can't tell
dialog: me himself?
text: Tom, rusty on pleasantries, brushes past Ellis as he heads
text: inside the boat.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: It ain't from him.
text: Ellis, not wanting to follow further, shouts from the planks.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: MUD SENT ME!
text: There is a silence. Then footsteps. Tom reappears.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Mud sent you.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Yessir.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What do you know about it?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: He asked me to come get you.
text: Tom straightens his back. He looks into the woods, searching
dialog: for something he may have missed.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Your daddy know this?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: No sir. Mud needs your help.
text: Tom's mind churns on a series of facts unknown to the boy.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Where is he?
scene_heading: 55 EXT. RIVER - DAY 55
text: Neckbone bounces in the boat as it shifts in the choppy
text: Mississippi water. His eyes are locked on the back of Tom's
text: head. Tom rides stone faced in the front.
text: Neckbone turns back to Ellis and raises his eyebrows as if to
text: ask, "What's going on?". Ellis shrugs.
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 56 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY 56
text: Ellis runs the boat on shore. Tom splashes into the ankle
text: deep water and helps the boys drag it onto the bank.
text: Ellis takes the lead, walking ahead and scanning the
text: treeline. Mud steps out, just past the shadow of the woods.
text: Ellis turns to Tom and points.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
text: There he is.
text: Tom spits onto the muddy bank and makes his way toward Mud.
text: Ellis and Neckbone stay by the boat and watch.
dialog: BY THE TREELINE,
text: Mud watches Tom approaching. He corrects his posture and
text: feebly attempts to smooth some wrinkles from his shirt.
text: Tom stops in front of him, his eyes pinched in the sun.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Mud.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Sir.
text: They stare at each other for a long moment. Neither one
text: flinching.
dialog: BY THE BOAT,
text: At this distance, the boys can't hear what is being said, but
text: they try and size up the situation through body language.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: You think that's his dad?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: BY THE TREELINE,
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: In town. Got here yesterday.
text: Tom lowers his head. Frustrated.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Why you out here like this?
dialog: BY THE BOAT,
dialog: 52.
dialog: 
text: The boys see Mud take a seat on a nearby stump. He's
text: explaining something. Tom listens, standing over him.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: They don't look like family.
text: Ellis watches Mud as he gestures and speaks. He seems
dialog: different. Younger.
text: Mud stops talking. Tom scratches a hand through his white
text: crew cut. He begins pointing a finger at Mud. His face is
text: flushed and the sound of his voice carries to the boys,
text: though still unintelligible.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE (CONT'D)
dialog: He's really givin' it to him.
text: AT THE TREELINE,
text: Mud's head hangs as Tom shouts at him.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You've spent your whole life
dialog: followin' that girl! She's run you
dialog: halfway cross the country and back,
dialog: and for what? For this, left out
text: on an island beggin' for help. A
text: murderer. A thief.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I ain't no thief.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What would you call it then? Don't
dialog: even mention draggin' those boys
dialog: into this. Do you have any idea
dialog: what you're doin'?
text: Waits for a response, but Mud gives none.
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm ashamed of you.
text: Mud looks up at him.
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't expect help from me. There's
dialog: none to be given.
text: AT THE BOAT,
text: They see Tom turn his back on Mud and head toward the boat.
text: Mud doesn't protest; he doesn't move.
text: Tom brushes past Ellis.
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm ready.
text: Tom shoves the boat back into the water. Neckbone helps him.
text: Ellis looks back at Mud, who still hasn't moved from his
text: stump. He goes to him. Tom sees this and stops pushing.
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: Dammit.
text: AT THE TREELINE,
text: Ellis stops a good six feet back from where Mud sits.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You all right?
text: Mud raises his head.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Looks like we're on our own.
text: He stands and takes a folded piece of paper from his shirt.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn't want you bein' the one to
dialog: do this, but I can't see a way
dialog: around it. I need to get this
dialog: letter to Juniper. Could you take
dialog: it to her for me?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: You have to be careful. You can't
text: just walk up and knock on her door,
dialog: you hear me? You have to watch
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I can handle it.
text: Ellis steps forward and Mud hands over the note. Ellis takes
text: it and walks back to the others.
text: AT THE BOAT,
text: Tom stares at Ellis as he climbs on board.
text: Tom looks back at Mud, who is watching him. He gives the
text: boat a final shove before pulling himself in. They motor
text: away. Tom doesn't look back.
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 57 EXT. RIVER/SHELLY'S OXBOW - MOVING - DAY 57
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: You Mud's daddy?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Mud didn't have no daddy. No
dialog: mother I ever knew of. He was
dialog: livin' in the woods when I met him.
dialog: Younger than you are now.
text: Tom doesn't offer anymore. Neckbone thinks on his answer.
text: Ellis kills the engine near the mouth of Shelly's Oxbow. Tom
text: jumps down into the knee deep river and wades onto shore. He
text: turns back to the boys.
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Ya'll need to watch yourselves.
dialog: Don't go gettin' into something you
dialog: don't have any business in. Mud's
dialog: into something you don't want any
dialog: part of. I suggest you forget
dialog: about him.
text: Ellis and Neckbone don't respond. Tom, with a final
text: admonishing look, disappears into the woods.
text: Ellis cranks the motor and points the boat up river.
scene_heading: 58 EXT. RIVER - MOVING - MOMENTS LATER 58
text: Edges of the notebook paper flap in the wind. Neckbone reads
dialog: Mud's letter to Juniper.
text: Ellis reaches the bank where they stash their boat. He shuts
text: off the motor and let's them drift. Neckbone folds the
text: letter back up and turns to face Ellis.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: He loves her. You can tell that
dialog: much. You gonna take it to her?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I told him I would.
text: Neckbone thinks about this seriously, shakes his head.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: I don't know. Could be a lot of
dialog: trouble.
dialog: 55.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You still got that trailer you made
dialog: for your bike?
scene_heading: 59 EXT. DEWITT STREET - LATE AFTERNOON 59
text: Neckbone rides with Ellis on the back of his dirt bike.
text: Cars and Trucks HONK and zip by them. Their speed is topped
text: out at about 15 miles per hour. Mostly a result of the small
text: 3X4 metal trailer they are towing behind the bike.
text: One of Senior's white fish coolers sits in the trailer.
scene_heading: 60 EXT. EXECUTIVE INN/PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON 60
text: Parked in the far corner of the lot, Ellis sits on top of the
text: white cooler eyeing the Executive Inn. Neckbone straddles
text: the dirt bike. A handful of cars are parked at the motel; an
text: old Honda, a pick-up, and a BLACK LINCOLN.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I say we start at the top, work our
dialog: way down.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: All right.
text: They each grab an end of the cooler and carry it across the
text: lot toward a flight of stairs.
text: 61 ON THE SECOND FLOOR, 61
text: The boys set the cooler down in front of the first room on
text: the corner. Ellis checks over his shoulder, nothing strange.
text: Ellis knocks. They wait. No answer.
text: They pick the cooler up and walk to the next door. Knock.
text: After a moment, a BLACK MAN in his late sixties opens the
text: door wearing boxers and an undershirt.
speaker_heading: BLACK MAN
dialog: What you want?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: We're sellin' fish. You wanna buy

speaker_heading: BLACK MAN
dialog: Fish?

speaker_heading: BLACK MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't want no damn fish.
dialog: 56.
dialog: 
text: He slams the door.
text: They drag the cooler to the next door. As Ellis holds up his
text: fist to knock, they hear a woman shouting a few doors down.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER (O.S.)
dialog: STOP IT! STOP!
text: Ellis heads for the room. Neckbone drags the cooler after
text: him. Ellis reaches the motel room door, which has been left
text: ajar. He places his hand on it and lets it fall open.
scene_heading: 62 INT. EXECUTIVE INN/JUNIPER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 62
speaker_heading: CARVER (O.S.)
dialog: KEEP LYIN'! KEEP LYIN' AND I'LL
dialog: CRACK YOUR NOSE OPEN!
text: The door opens to CARVER(47), a tall, slender man in a dark
text: Western cut suit, standing over Juniper. She's crumpled up
text: in a ball at the end of the bed. Carver swats open-handed at
text: her head. Grabs the top of her hair.
speaker_heading: CARVER (CONT'D)
dialog: You hear me bitch? Tell me another
dialog: lie.
text: Ellis rushes Carver with his shoulder as if he were breaking
text: down a door. Carver is knocked off balance. He trips over
text: the edge of the bed and crashes into the motel room wall.
text: Carver, slightly stunned, gets to his feet and in two broad
text: steps lands a man-sized punch across Ellis' face. It's hard.
text: Ellis melts. He grabs the boy up by the scruff of his shirt.
speaker_heading: CARVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Who are you!? Who the hell are
dialog: you!? Did he send you!?
text: Carver removes a piece of paper from his pocket. It's a
text: photo copied picture of Mud, different than the State
text: Trooper's. Carver crams the photo in the boy's face.
speaker_heading: CARVER (CONT'D)
dialog: You know this man!? Look at him!
dialog: Do you know him!?
text: Blood trickles from a cut under Ellis' eye. He stutters
text: under the shaking force of Carver's hands.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I don't...I...
speaker_heading: NECKBONE (O.S.)
dialog: FISH!!! IT'S FISH!!!
dialog: 57.
dialog: 
text: Neckbone is yelling at the top of his lungs, almost in a
text: girl's pitch. Carver turns to him. The cooler is open
text: behind them and Neckbone holds up two Ziplock bags of fish.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE (CONT'D)
dialog: We're just selling fish!
text: Carver sizes things up. It takes a moment, but he settles.
text: He snorts out a laugh and drops Ellis on the ground.
text: Carver turns his attention back to Juniper, who is huddled up
text: in the corner of the motel. Carver walks over to her.
text: Opening a good-sized knife, he gets down in her face and
text: holds the blade uncomfortably close to her cheek.
speaker_heading: CARVER
dialog: I know you know where he is. And I
dialog: swear to God I'll cut through every
dialog: one a you to find him.
text: She flinches. Standing, Carver folds up his knife.
speaker_heading: CARVER (CONT'D)
dialog: We know you came here for him, and
dialog: we know he's too stupid to leave
dialog: you behind. So when he pops his
dialog: head out of whatever shithole he's
dialog: staying in, I'll be there. You
dialog: tell him that.
text: Carver turns, stepping over Ellis on his way out.
speaker_heading: CARVER (CONT'D)
dialog: And you need to mind your business
dialog: boy.
text: Neckbone moves from the doorway to let him pass. Carver is
text: gone. Neckbone shuts the door and fastens the security
text: latch. He kneels down to check on his friend.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: You all right?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: He popped your eye.
text: Ellis holds the back of his hand up to his eye which has
text: begun to swell. The cut trickles blood over his cheekbone.
text: Juniper moves to the sink. Ellis sits up, staring at her
dialog: back.
dialog: 58.
dialog: 
text: She opens an ice bucket and wraps a handful of cubes in a
text: towel. She turns and walks over to them, her eyes cast down.
text: She kneels in front of Ellis, making eye contact for the
text: first time. She touches his chin, gently pivoting it to see
text: the wound. Her eyes are glassy.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER
dialog: Thank you.
text: He stares back at her. He can't take his eyes off her. She
text: holds the iced towel to his cheek. He doesn't even flinch.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm so sorry.
text: Tears form and run down her cheeks.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Here.
text: She takes his hand and places it against the towel. She gets
text: to her feet and pulls a pocket book from a bag in the corner.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER (CONT'D)
dialog: How much is your fish? I'll buy
text: the cooler full.
text: Ellis motions Neckbone to the cooler. Neckbone goes over and
text: crams his hand into the ice. He removes a Ziplock bag
dialog: containing the note that Mud sent.
text: Neckbone hands it to Ellis. Taking the note, he sets his ice
text: down and walks over to Juniper.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Mud sent us to give this to you.
text: Juniper is stunned. She looks at the bag, then at the boys.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER
dialog: You've met Mud?
text: Ellis nods. Neckbone speaks up from the back.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Yeah we met him.
text: Juniper takes the bag. She removes the letter and takes a
text: seat on the edge of the bed to read it.
text: Ellis watches her eyes move along the paper. She smiles,
text: which makes Ellis smile. After a moment, she folds it up.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER
dialog: He tells me to hold tight.
dialog: 59.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Yeah, we read it.
text: Juniper raises her eyebrows at Neckbone.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER
dialog: Well do you know how long `hold
dialog: tight' is?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I think it's a couple days. He
dialog: wants to get a boat for ya'll.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER
dialog: God.
text: Juniper shakes her head and goes to the sink. She pulls a
text: lighter from her jeans pocket and torches Mud's note.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell him I'll wait.
text: Running water over the ashes, she turns back to them.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER (CONT'D)
dialog: But I don't want ya'll involved.
dialog: Tell him what I said and make that
dialog: it. I don't want you gettin' in
dialog: any trouble.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: We won't.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER
dialog: What do you call that?
text: She motions to his swelling eye. Ellis shrugs.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: We'll be all right. Keep your door
dialog: locked. We'll be in touch.
text: Ellis heads to the door as Neckbone gathers up the cooler.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER
dialog: Wait.
text: Ellis turns back.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER (CONT'D)
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I'm Ellis. That's Neckbone.
dialog: 60.
dialog: 
text: Juniper walks up to Ellis and puts her hands on his

text: him just above his swollen eye.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER
dialog: Thank you Ellis.
text: Ellis stares at her, infatuated.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: We gotta go.
text: Ellis turns and grabs one end of the cooler. Neckbone slaps

text: hand. They walk out.
scene_heading: 63 EXT. EXECUTIVE INN/JUNIPER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DUSK 63
text: Ellis, his foot on the door, looks back at Juniper.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Lock the door.
text: She smiles. The door slams shut. The room number, 212,
text: stares Ellis in the face. He takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Let's go hard on.
text: He and Ellis wrangle the cooler down the steps. The sun set
text: while they were inside. A blue hue hangs over everything.
scene_heading: 64 I/E. CARVER'S LINCOLN/PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 64
text: Carver takes a drag off a cigarette from behind the steering
text: wheel of his black Lincoln town car, conscious to blow any
text: smoke out the open driver's window.
text: His car, wedged between two others in the Piggly Wiggly
text: parking lot, is pointed toward the Executive Inn. He watches
text: as Ellis and Neckbone load the cooler onto Neckbone's bike.
scene_heading: 65 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 65
text: Ellis enters his houseboat. It's quiet.
text: He sees a note on the counter next to a can of soup. It
dialog: reads, "I've gone to a movie. Warm up some soup for dinner.
text: Love, Mom". Ellis picks up the can, not thrilled.
text: He goes to the fridge and grabs a sack of peas from the
text: freezer. Holding the peas against his eye he takes a seat at
text: the counter and flips through a phone book.
text: He finds what he needs and dials a corded phone. He waits.
dialog: 61.

text: tied around his waist. A series of ropes and pulleys
text: crisscross from the boat to the trees.
text: Neckbone and Ellis stand on the ground staring up at him.
text: Mud holds a chainsaw and seems to be hesitating.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Well if you're gonna do it do it!
text: Mud takes a deep breath and yanks the cord. Angled on one of
text: the main branches holding up the boat, Mud begins cutting.
text: Ellis and Neckbone step further and further back as they
text: watch the chainsaw work through the thick limb.
text: Suddenly, the chainsaw stops. A deep CRACKING sound. The
text: huge branch SNAPS, tumbling off lower limbs before crashing
text: to the ground. Mud holds onto the trunk for dear life.
text: The branch now rests on the ground, SILENCE. The ropes and
text: pulleys hang taught, squeaking from the weight of the boat.
text: Mud slowly lifts his head up. He smiles at what he sees.
text: The rigging has held.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: One down!
text: Neckbone and Ellis watch as Mud scampers around the trunk to
text: the next branch. The chainsaw cranks back on.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: This shit is crazy.

speaker_heading: AFTERNOON
text: Ellis looks out the car window at HIGH SCHOOL KIDS that have
text: gathered in the Piggly Wiggly parking lot. His hair is
text: slicked to one side, and he's wearing a collared shirt.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: You look nice.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: What time are you gonna be home?
text: Ellis shrugs. She looks at him as the car radio rambles.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE (CONT'D)
dialog: No later than eleven?
text: Ellis nods.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You make up your mind?
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: About moving in town?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: About leavin' dad.
text: Mary Lee thinks about how to answer, shuts off the radio.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: You can't make other people change
dialog: Ellis. If I'm unhappy then I'll
dialog: have to be the one to change
dialog: something.
text: Ellis chews on the inside of his cheek and watches her avoid
text: eye contact. He shoulders his way out of the car.
text: Mary Lee takes a moment before driving off.
text: As Mary Lee pulls away, Ellis takes in the scene.
scene_heading: 72 EXT. EXECUTIVE INN - LATE AFTERNOON - ELLIS POV 72
text: He looks up at Juniper's motel room and sees her leaning on
text: the railing smoking a cigarette. She doesn't see him.
scene_heading: 73 EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS 73
text: He pauses, noticing a MAN to his left who ALSO stares up at
text: Juniper. The man, early thirties with a thick mustache, is
text: JAMES. He leans against the grill of a black Lincoln.
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
text: Carver appears from inside the Piggly Wiggly. He holds a cup
text: of coffee and is closely trailed by a fat little man,
text: NELSON(56). They're all dressed in a similar fashion, a
text: cross between rural farmers and rodeo stars.
text: As Carver approaches the Lincoln, he scolds James for leaning
text: on the grill. Carver rubs the hood with his coat sleeve and
text: gives orders to the men.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL (O.S.)
dialog: Ellis!
text: Ellis turns to see May Pearl hopping down from a Ford Bronco.
text: She leans on the door and waves Ellis into the back.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on!
text: Ellis takes another look at Carver and his men before running
text: over to the Bronco.
scene_heading: 74 EXT. FIELD/BONFIRE - NIGHT 74
text: A bonfire rages in the middle of an open field. A FEW DOZEN
text: KIDS mingle between vehicles and the fire. Drinking,
text: yelling, music blasting from car speakers.
text: Ellis stands by himself next to the blaze with his hands in
text: his pockets. May Pearl has vanished.
text: Pryor, the skinny kid Ellis punched to get this date, wanders
text: past. He makes eye contact. Ellis stares him down. Pryor
text: glares back but then just skulks over to another group.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL (O.S.)
dialog: Try this.
text: A Styrofoam Sonic Cup is thrust into Ellis' hand. He turns
text: to find May Pearl standing next to him.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on.
text: She leads Ellis behind one of the trucks parked nearby. May
text: Pearl climbs onto the tailgate, a red glow across her face.
text: No one else is around. Ellis hesitates.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL (CONT'D)
dialog: You wanna sit down?
text: Ellis takes a seat next to her. She looks at him, smiling,
text: and gestures to his black eye.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL (CONT'D)
dialog: You must really like to fight?
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Not really.
text: Ellis takes a sip from the Sonic cup. His face puckers.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: But you're not scared if you have
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I guess. You got a lot of friends.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: They're all right. I don't know
dialog: all of `em.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I bet you're pretty popular.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I don't know. `Cause you're nice
dialog: to people.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: How do you know that?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You're nice to me.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: But I like you.
text: Ellis digs into his jeans pocket.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I got this for you.
text: He removes a bracelet made from the pearls he collected off
text: Galen's porch. May Pearl takes it, begins putting it on.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: A bracelet?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Neckbone's uncle caught the pearls.
dialog: I thought with your name and
dialog: everything...
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: Thank you.
text: She leans over, hugging him with a kiss on the cheek. She
dialog: stays close.
dialog: 69.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You wanna be my girlfriend?
text: She smiles, then kisses him.
scene_heading: 75 EXT. ELLIS' AND TOM'S HOUSEBOATS - MORNING 75
text: Morning fog sits on top of the water around Ellis' houseboat.
text: Ellis steps outside and makes his way to the ice machine. A
text: loud WHISTLE comes from across the oxbow. Ellis walks to the
text: edge of the garage.
text: A75 He sees Tom Blankenship seated on the roof of his houseboat. A75
text: He motions Ellis over.
text: Ellis watches him, unsure of what to do. Another WHISTLE.
text: Tom motions to him again. Ellis looks back at the house. No
text: sign of his parents. He shoots a glance back at Tom.
scene_heading: 76 EXT. TOM BLANKENSHIP'S HOUSEBOAT - MOMENTS LATER 76
text: Ellis bumps his father's boat against the side of Tom's
text: houseboat. He steps up onto the deck and ties off.
text: Tom, down from the roof, stands by his front door.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You want some coffee?
text: Tom disappears inside.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I don't drink coffee.
text: Ellis waits for a moment, but realizes this is Tom's way of
text: inviting him inside. He enters.
scene_heading: 77 INT. TOM BLANKENSHIP'S HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 77
text: This houseboat, although similar in size, is different than
text: Ellis'. It's an actual wood shack that has been constructed
text: atop a barge.
text: Ellis looks at photos, books and memorabilia that cram the
text: walls and shelves. It feels homey.
text: Tom, his back to the boy, stands in the kitchen area pouring
text: a cup of coffee.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You been seein' Mud?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: No.
dialog: 70.
dialog: 
text: A collection of framed photos on a desk catches Ellis'
text: attention. A young Tom with a pretty dark skinned girl.
text: They seem happy. Another photo, late 60's, of Tom standing
text: alone in a suit. He holds a LONG SUITCASE.
text: Tom enters holding two cups of coffee.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You don't have to lie to me boy.
text: He hands Ellis a cup of coffee with a cartoon image of a dog
text: on it. It reads, "I'm a real bitch in the morning!" Tom
text: sits in a LazyBoy that he gently rocks in.
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: I've seen you runnin' around.
dialog: Takin' things. He all right?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: He's okay.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: He get that boat down?
text: Ellis nods. There is an awkward moment.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: He called you an assassin.
text: Tom snorts out a laugh, sips his coffee.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Is it true?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: How long have you known Mud?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Few days.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Well that's long enough to know
dialog: he's full of shit.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: So it's not true.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I was a sharpshooter in the army.
dialog: In Mud's world, that makes me an
dialog: assassin. Not exactly true, right?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Yeah I guess.
text: Tom notices the boy's disappointment.
dialog: 71.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You think he's a bad ass don't you?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You know why he's stuck out on that
dialog: island?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: He shot somebody.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: He tell you why he shot that man?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Because he hurt Juniper.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Right. The real reason Mud's in
dialog: the trouble he's got is because of
dialog: her. He's been in love with that
dialog: girl since he was your age. They
dialog: used to run all around here and it
dialog: was the same back then. He'd
dialog: follow that girl wherever she led
dialog: him. Problem is she don't care
dialog: about nobody but herself. I've
dialog: told him as much. She'd bed down
dialog: with the meanest snake she could
dialog: find, then when things went bad
dialog: she'd go runnin' to Mud. Mud would
dialog: take her back, then go find
dialog: whatever unlucky sonofabitch last
text: put a hand on her and beat `em `til
dialog: they knew to never touch her again.
dialog: And this time I guess he thought a
dialog: beating wasn't good enough. Had to
dialog: shoot that fella. I don't know for
dialog: sure, but I'd put money on Juniper
dialog: knowin' he'd do it. And I have a
dialog: suspicion she might of even told
dialog: him to. Either way, those two are
dialog: set for failure. Only chance Mud
dialog: has is to cut her loose. Cause
dialog: I'll tell you what, Mud's no bad
dialog: ass. He's runnin' scared.
text: Ellis can't look Tom in the eye, he's offended by the old
text: man's remarks. Ellis sets the coffee cup on the desk.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I gotta go.
text: Ellis heads for the door, but stops short.
dialog: 72.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You're wrong about Juniper. They
dialog: love each other and they're gonna
dialog: make it. If you weren't a wore out
dialog: old man you'd know it was true.
text: Tom eyes the boy, taking a sip from his cup. He nods a
text: goodbye to Ellis who is already out the door.
scene_heading: 78 EXT. ISLAND/BASE OF BOAT TREE - DAY 78
text: Ellis stomps out of the trees and is struck by the new
text: position of the boat. It hangs three feet off the ground;
text: SUSPENDED in dry dock. A clear-cut path of trees leads off
text: toward the island's southern shore.
text: Beside the boat, remnants of a giant fire smolder. Ellis
text: surveys the MOUND OF ASH.
speaker_heading: MUD (O.S.)
dialog: What you say Ellis?
text: Ellis turns to find Mud standing on the deck of the boat
text: holding a fistful of wires. He jumps down.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I got more stuff.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: You find a motor?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Not yet.
dialog: (points to the ash)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I made a bonfire.
text: Mud enters the woods. Ellis follows.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Bonfire's an all purpose cure all
dialog: for bad luck. I don't know where
dialog: this boat's been or what kind of
dialog: person had it before me. For all I
dialog: know it could have some serious bad
dialog: business left on it. We got too
dialog: much ridin' on this thing to leave
dialog: to chance. Where's Neckbone?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
text: Helpin' his uncle with a dive.
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 79 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - MOMENTS LATER 79
text: Mud and Ellis exit the treeline heading to Ellis' boat.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Tom called me over to his place
dialog: this mornin'.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: What he say?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: He was runnin' down Juniper.
text: Ellis looks for a response, but Mud just jumps up into the
text: boat and starts throwing pieces of wood on shore.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I told him he was a wore out old
dialog: man. Told him he couldn't know how
dialog: much you loved Juniper.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: You don't know his story.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I don't care.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: You should. Tom loved a woman more
dialog: than most men could in two
dialog: lifetimes. They had a good life
dialog: started together.
text: Mud hops down and scoops a load of wood into his arms.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: She was pregnant with a little boy,
dialog: but the birth got the better of
dialog: `em. They didn't make it. Tom's
dialog: been alone ever since. Lone wolf.
text: Mud has begun walking back to the treeline. Ellis stays.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I gotta go help my dad.
text: Mud turns back but doesn't stop moving.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Thanks for the wood Ellis.
text: Ellis watches him go, thinking on what he said.
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 80 EXT. UNDERWATER - RIVER - DAY 80
text: Fully suited in diving gear, Galen toils in the murky brown
text: water at the bottom of the river.
text: His gear consists of a typical wet-suit, wet-socks but no
text: gloves. His metal helmet is not typical. It's welded from
text: half a hot water heater that's been fitted with barbell
text: weights. A hose connected to the top runs to the surface.
text: Galen ties off a netted sack and yanks on its line.
scene_heading: 81 EXT. RIVER - CONTINUOUS 81
text: A small air compressor chugs as Neckbone stands in the middle
text: of Galen's boat pulling in the heavy rope. At the end, the
text: net bulging with mussel shells appears.
text: He manages to roll the heavy load into the boat before moving
text: over to a crank handle that feeds another line.
text: After several cranks, Galen's steel helmet breaches the
text: surface. He places his hands on the edge of the boat as
text: Neckbone removes the barbell weights.
text: The weight removed, Neckbone takes off the helmet. Galen
text: pulls himself into the boat, out of breath.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: This shit never gets easy.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: That's a good haul.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: I've had worse.
text: Galen reclines as Neckbone kills the air compressor and
text: begins organizing the gear. He watches his little nephew.
speaker_heading: GALEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You doin' all right?
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: You don't need to tell me anything?
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Tell you what?
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: I know I'm just your uncle, not
dialog: much of a parent. But you can tell
dialog: me things if you need to.
dialog: 75.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: I can tell you this helmet smells
dialog: like my duck butter.
scene_heading: 82 EXT. ELDERLY WOMAN'S HOUSE - DAY 82
text: Ellis holds a wrought iron door open with his backside as an
text: ELDERLY WOMAN takes the paper bag of fish from his hands.
text: Ellis walks back to the truck. Senior watches him, looking
text: at the black eye.
scene_heading: 83 I/E. SENIOR'S TRUCK/CATFISH PARLOUR - MOVING - DAY 83
text: Ellis rides up front with Senior. Windows down, no radio.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: Where'd you get that black eye?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: A kid in town. He got his too.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: What you fightin' for?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: `Bout a girl.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: What girl?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: My girlfriend.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: You got a girlfriend?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: When'd that happen?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Other day.
text: Senior pats his shirt pocket and finds a smoke. Lights it.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: You seen your mother today?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: You not talkin' to me?
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I'm talkin'. I'm talkin' to both
dialog: of you. That's all ya'll want to
dialog: do is talk.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: Well, that's your mother. Would
dialog: rather tongue lash a problem than
dialog: step up and handle it. You'll see
dialog: one day. Women are tough. They'll
dialog: set you up for things. You can't
dialog: trust love, Ellis. If you're not
dialog: careful, it'll run out on you. You
dialog: just gotta pick a woman and roll
dialog: the dice. Hope you don't wake up
dialog: in fifteen years hatin' each other.
text: Ellis keeps staring out the window as they pull into the
text: parking lot of the Catfish Parlour Restaurant.
scene_heading: 84 EXT. THE CATFISH PARLOUR/THE PINES MOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON- 84
speaker_heading: CONTINUOUS
text: Senior climbs out of the truck and enters the restaurant.
text: Ellis pops open the tailgate and reaches for a cooler.
text: The Catfish Parlour is one business in a strip center row.
text: There is nothing else around save for farmland and a motel
text: across the road.
text: Ellis notices Carver's black LINCOLN parked in the motel lot.
text: He walks away from the truck to get a better look.
text: Ellis scans the FOUR OTHER VEHICLES in the lot. All Texas
text: plates. A maroon Cadillac sails past and turns into the
text: motel. Ellis recedes to the rear of his truck.
text: He watches as KING(76), a fireplug of a man, emerges from the
text: Cadillac. Cramped from a long drive, he stretches and eyes
text: the sign for the Pines Motel.
text: A motel room door opens and Carver walks out. He's smiling
text: and calls out to King. They hug as a green PICK-UP pulls up.
text: MILLER, a slick dressed man in black boots, climbs out.
speaker_heading: SENIOR (O.S.)
dialog: Ellis! Let's go!
text: Ellis snaps around to find Senior leaning out the restaurant
text: door. Ellis yanks the cooler down and drags it inside. He
text: looks back over his shoulder for a final glance at the men.
text: AT THE MOTEL,
speaker_heading: CARVER
dialog: Daddy this is Miller. He's one of
dialog: ours.
dialog: 77.

speaker_heading: KING
speaker_heading: (SHAKING)
dialog: How do you do? Appreciate your

speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: CARVER
dialog: We'll be in in a minute.
text: Miller nods and enters the motel room. King turns to Carver.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Catch me up.
speaker_heading: CARVER
text: They work in shifts. Two outside
dialog: her motel, the others either out
dialog: searching or sleepin' here. I met
dialog: with the county sheriff but he
dialog: wasn't much help. Said they'd
dialog: handle their own business, but I
dialog: got two of their people on payroll
dialog: and a person on the inside at the
dialog: state police.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Good. Doin' good. Who all's here?
speaker_heading: CARVER
text: All but two now. Nelson and James
dialog: are watchin' her place. I called

speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Okay. Let's meet the men.
text: Carver leads his father to the motel room.
scene_heading: 85 INT. PINES MOTEL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS 85
text: Carver holds the door open as King steps inside. A door to
text: his left connects another room which is empty.
text: An episode of the Smurfs plays on the television. There's a
text: MAN on each of the queen beds. Another THREE playing cards
text: at a small table by the window. MILLER stands in the corner
text: smoking. Empty Budweiser cans litter the room.
text: King, unimpressed by the scene, looks at his son. Carver
text: quickly moves in front of the television and turns it off.
text: He stares down the men on the beds.
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARVER
dialog: Get up.
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: Ya'll pay attention.
text: The men get up from the beds and the others put down their
text: cards. Everyone slowly gathers into an audience.
speaker_heading: CARVER (CONT'D)
dialog: This is my father, King. He runs
dialog: the show.
text: Carver recedes as King steps forward. He speaks like a high
dialog: school football coach.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Men. I wanna thank you for the
dialog: work you're doin'. It's important
dialog: work, and I want you to know what
dialog: it means to me personally. I'm
dialog: grateful for it. No man should
dialog: have to bury his son. It's not
dialog: natural, and it's a pain I hope
dialog: none of you ever have to endure.
text: King removes a photocopied picture of Mud from his pocket.
text: He unfolds it, stares at it, then raises it to the men.
speaker_heading: KING (CONT'D)
dialog: This man did that to me. He took
dialog: my youngest boy. And now, you're
dialog: gonna help me get him.
text: King stares at the men, keeping the photo held high.
speaker_heading: KING (CONT'D)
dialog: Now gather `round. Come on now, in
dialog: a circle. I want ya'll to join
dialog: hands.
dialog: They do it reluctantly.
speaker_heading: KING (CONT'D)
dialog: Everybody take a knee.

speaker_heading: KING (CONT'D)

scene_heading: A85 EXT. NECKBONE'S TRAILER - MORNING A85
text: A tarp is thrown back from a rusting boat trailer.
text: Ellis and Neckbone stand by the trailer looking less than

speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: You touch her breast?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: A little.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: That's great man.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Thanks.
text: Ellis walks up and knocks a stack of bricks off the trailer.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: We could take it apart. Bring it
dialog: out piece by piece.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: It's welded. We'd just tear it up.
dialog: What if we float it out?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: With what?
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Come on.
text: Neckbone walks to the trailer. Ellis follows.
dialog: 
scene_heading: B85 INT. NECKBONE'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS B85
text: The boys open the front door and are met by a BLINDING LIGHT.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Jesus!
text: They squint and shield their eyes.
text: The light shuts off as quickly as it came on. Galen stands
text: in front of them wearing his wet suit. The bar with the
text: flood lights attached sits across his shoulders.
text: The boys rub their eyeballs, seeing spots. Galen shuffles
text: over to the couch holding a marine battery connected to the
text: lights. He labors to take a seat.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: 79A.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: That's real good Galen.
speaker_heading: (TO ELLIS)
dialog: Gimme a minute.

speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Come `ere Ellis.
text: Ellis takes a seat on the other end of the couch. Galen pats

speaker_heading: GALEN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (POINTING UP)
dialog: You see that ceiling fan?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: I found it in the river. Works
dialog: great. Best ceiling fan I've ever
dialog: owned. This river brings a lotta
dialog: trash down it. Some a that trash
dialog: is worth a lotta money, some of
dialog: it's not. You gotta know what's
dialog: worth keepin' and what's worth
dialog: lettin' go. You know the
dialog: difference?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Neck looks up to you. Don't get my

speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GALEN

speaker_heading: GALEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ya'll wanna hang out? Alan's

speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: King. That's what they call him.

text: BARRELS affixed with plastic zip ties. The make-shift raft

text: The boys watch as Mud walks around the trailer cutting off

dialog: trailer as this happens.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: He's their father. You didn't go

speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MUD

speaker_heading: ELLIS

speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: There's a motor in the scrap yard
dialog: might work.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I need one that runs.
text: Mud moves to the front of the boat trailer and begins
text: dragging it fully onto the bank. It's heavy.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: I can get it runnin'. Tell him
dialog: Ellis.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: It's true. He built his own dirt
dialog: bike.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: All right then. Give it a shot.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I don't know. That motor's worth
dialog: somethin'. It's not like this

dialog: 80.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: It's been there for months.
dialog: Nobody's even gonna know it's gone.
text: Ellis hesitates. He looks to Mud.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: We do need a motor.
text: Ellis thinks on it as Mud takes a deep breath and grabs the

scene_heading: 87 EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - DAY 87
text: The supermarket is busy. Ellis stands at a pay phone out

text: Ellis looks at Juniper's motel. He scans the Piggly Wiggly
text: parking lot and spots Carver's black Lincoln. Ellis picks up
text: the phone and deposits some change. He dials.
speaker_heading: ELLIS

scene_heading: 88 I/E. JUNIPER'S MOTEL ROOM/PIGGLY WIGGLY - CONTINUOUS 88

speaker_heading: ELLIS

speaker_heading: JUNIPER

speaker_heading: JUNIPER
dialog: They're watching my room.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I'll take care of that. Just be

speaker_heading: JUNIPER
dialog: Wait. Just wait. I don't know
dialog: about alla this. I don't even know

dialog: Where are we even gonna go? This
dialog: is Mud. This is what Mud does.
text: Ellis hears her crying through the phone.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: It's okay. He's got the boat. We

dialog: plan. Just be ready.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER
dialog: Why are you even doing this?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JUNIPER
dialog: Why are you helping us?
speaker_heading: ELLIS

speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: We're good.
scene_heading: 90 I/E. CARVER'S LINCOLN/PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - DAY 90
text: Carver sits behind the wheel of his Lincoln. The man with
text: the mustache, James, sits in the passenger seat next to him.
text: Carver notices Ellis and Neckbone standing in front of the
text: Piggly Wiggly. He climbs out.
text: AT THE VENDING MACHINES,
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Gimme a quarter. This shit took
dialog: mine.
text: Ellis watches May Pearl entering the grocery store. He calls
text: out with a wave.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL!
text: Without stopping, May Pearl, along with her Sister and
text: Mother, all turn. May Pearl sees him, but doesn't wave back.
text: She continues inside.
text: Ellis looks confused, then embarrassed. Neckbone notices.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: It's all right man. She's with her
dialog: family. Come on. I wanna get that
dialog: motor before dark.
text: They head to the dirt bike.
speaker_heading: CARVER (O.S.)
dialog: Hey there!
text: Ellis turns to see Carver approaching.
speaker_heading: CARVER (CONT'D)
dialog: You remember me don't you?
text: Ellis nods. Carver notes the healing bruise on Ellis' face.
speaker_heading: CARVER (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sure sorry about that. Ya'll
dialog: caught me at a real bad time.
dialog: 83.
dialog: 
text: Ellis climbs on the bike. Carver walks over to them.
speaker_heading: CARVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold on now. One second. I don't
dialog: want ya'll thinkin' I'm a bad guy.
dialog: Ya'll were just trying to do a job,
dialog: and I got in your way.
text: Carver removes a roll of twenties and peels off two.
speaker_heading: CARVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's just say I bought that whole
dialog: batch of fish ya'll were sellin'.
dialog: Would forty cover it?
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: That'd bout do it.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: We don't want your money.
text: Carver steps in close to the boys.
speaker_heading: CARVER
dialog: I bet ya'll really get around this
dialog: town. Probably know every hole and
dialog: ditch. Have ya'll come across the
dialog: man whose picture I showed you?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: No.
text: Carver removes a flier with Mud's picture and holds it out.
speaker_heading: CARVER
dialog: You sure about that? Take a look
dialog: with your good eye.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I'm sure.
speaker_heading: CARVER
dialog: What about that girl in the motel?
dialog: The pretty one. Ya'll talk to her
dialog: some more?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: No.
text: Carver smiles. He tucks the flier and the forty dollars into
text: Ellis' hand.
speaker_heading: CARVER
dialog: There's a number on there. Ya'll
dialog: let me know if you do.
dialog: 84.
dialog: 
text: Neckbone cranks the engine and backs the bike up with his
text: feet. They pull away.
text: Moving, Ellis looks back to see Carver watching them.
scene_heading: 91 EXT. CRAWFORD'S JUNKYARD - DUSK 91
text: Neckbone pulls back a loose section of chain-link fence
text: surrounding the marine junkyard. Ellis crouches through.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE JUNKYARD,
text: Ellis and Neckbone creep through piles of starboard and boat
text: parts. They stop at a party barge with only one pontoon. At
text: its rear hangs a big rusted motor, 200 horsepower.
text: Neckbone quickly disassembles its attachment. The motor pops
text: loose leaving the boys to strain against its heavy weight.
text: They ease it to the ground.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Jesus that's heavy.
text: The boys get on either side of the motor and begin half-
text: dragging it back to the fence line.
dialog: ACROSS THE YARD,
text: A LITTLE GIRL(10) dangles her feet off a loading platform and
text: bites at an ice cream sandwich. She watches Neckbone and
text: Ellis from a distance.
scene_heading: 92 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 92
text: Ellis walks onto the houseboat as the sound of Neckbone's
text: bike fades in the trees. He stops, noticing a PAPER BAG
text: sitting on the water's edge of the boat. He goes over to it.
text: He opens the sack and takes a quick inventory. A loaf of
text: bread, potted meats, a bottle of Jack Daniels, a roll of
text: cash, and an Arkansas boat tag.
text: Ellis looks around, no one. He looks over to Tom's boat.
text: It's dark. Ellis scoops up the sack and heads inside.
scene_heading: 93 EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON 93
text: The digital wristwatch changes from "4:59" to "5:00".
text: Neckbone sits on his bike parked near the vending machines at
text: the Piggly Wiggly. Ellis, on the payphone, scans the parking
text: lot. No sign of Carver's Lincoln. No other Bounty Hunters.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Where are those bastards?
dialog: 85.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: (HANGS UP)
dialog: She's not answerin'.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: What do you wanna do?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Take your bike around the side.
dialog: I'll check her room. We'll just
dialog: have to hope no one sees us.
text: Neckbone cranks the bike and speeds toward the motel. Ellis
text: looks to the motel, then the parking lot.
scene_heading: 94 EXT. EXECUTIVE INN - MOMENTS LATER 94
text: ON THE SECOND FLOOR,
text: Ellis cautiously heads up the stairs. He eyes the parking
text: lot at the Piggly Wiggly but still sees no sign of Carver's
dialog: men.
text: He moves quickly toward Juniper's door. Checking over his
text: shoulder, he knocks. No answer. He knocks again. Nothing.
text: He peeks through the window. No lights. No movement.
dialog: 95 BY THE DIRT BIKE, 95
text: Neckbone gets off his bike and slips to the corner of the
text: building. As he peeks his head out, Ellis nearly knocks him
text: over on his way downstairs. They both flinch.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Shit. Was she there?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Nothin'.
text: Ellis notices the front office
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on.
scene_heading: 96 INT. EXECUTIVE INN/FRONT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 96
text: The MOTEL CLERK(29) doesn't look up from his issue of
text: Lowrider as Ellis and Neckbone enter.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Scuse me, sir?
speaker_heading: MOTEL CLERK
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 86.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: We're lookin' for the girl in room
dialog: 212. You seen her?
speaker_heading: MOTEL CLERK
dialog: I've seen her.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You see her today.
speaker_heading: MOTEL CLERK
dialog: Yeah, she came down askin' for
dialog: directions to the nearest bar. I
dialog: told her to head out to a place on
dialog: 61.
text: Ellis digests this. They turn to leave.
speaker_heading: MOTEL CLERK (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait a second, are ya'll the little
dialog: bastards tryin' to sell fish to the
dialog: guests?
text: They're already out the door.
scene_heading: 97 EXT. ROADSIDE BAR - DUSK 97
text: Ellis and Neckbone pull into the gravel lot in front of a
text: roadside bar. The cinder block building sits by itself just
text: off the highway. Cars and motorcycles fill the lot.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: You think this is it?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: It's gotta be.
scene_heading: 98 INT. ROADSIDE BAR - CONTINUOUS 98
text: The small bar is loud and crowded. Shoulder to shoulder
text: PATRONS bump against one another as MUSIC blares.
text: Neckbone and Ellis press through the crowd searching for
text: Juniper. They are a good foot shorter than anyone else.
text: Ellis notices a man at the bar. It's Miller, the bounty
text: hunter from King's motel. He's staring at something across
text: the room. Ellis follows his line of sight.
text: The crowd weaves in front of him, but then he sees her.
text: Juniper leans against a pool table at the far end of the bar.
text: A GUY(32) whispers in her ear and kisses her neck. She
text: throws her head back, laughing. Ellis watches in disbelief.
text: Nearby, the BARTENDER(46) fills a customer's shot glass. The
text: two underage kids catch his attention.
dialog: 87.
dialog: 
text: Ellis' face is frozen, locked on Juniper. Neckbone places a
text: hand on his shoulder.
text: Juniper's eyes drift toward the boys. She makes eye contact
text: with Ellis, and her smile vanishes. The Guy keeps whispering
text: in her ear. Juniper straightens her back slightly.
text: Ellis can't take his eyes off her. Juniper stares back at
text: him, but doesn't make a move.
text: After a moment, Juniper's eyes fall to the floor. She turns
text: her head back to the Guy. The crowd fills back in and the
text: image is out of Ellis' reach.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER (O.S.)
dialog: What the hell are ya'll doin'?!
text: The Bartender swoops in, grabbing them both by the backs of
text: their necks and shoving them toward the door. Ellis strains
text: against the thick hand. He tries to get another look at
text: Juniper, but it's too crowded.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 99 EXT. ROADSIDE BAR - DUSK - CONTINUOUS 99
text: The Bartender flings Ellis and Neckbone into the parking lot.
text: Neckbone slides on the loose gravel.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Ya'll stay outta here!
text: Ellis just stands staring at the front door. The Bartender
text: makes a swatting motion toward them.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER (CONT'D)
dialog: I SAID GET OUTTA HERE!!!
text: Neckbone gathers his friend and leads him away.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Thanks a lot asshole!
speaker_heading: (TO ELLIS)
dialog: Come on man.
text: They head over to Neckbone's dirt bike. He pulls out the key
text: and climbs on. Ellis hesitates.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll take you home.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: We're gonna have to tell Mud.
text: Neckbone drops his head, nods reluctantly.
dialog: 88.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 100 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - NIGHT 100
text: The boys struggle to pull the heavy motor out of their boat.
text: It hits the shoreline with a thud. They lean over it,
text: sucking air.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Just leave it. Mud'll have to help
dialog: get it.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: What're you gonna tell him?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I'll just tell him the truth.
scene_heading: 101 EXT. ISLAND/SOUTHERN SHORE - NIGHT 101
text: Mud stands at the back of the boat, which now rests on the
text: boat trailer near the water. His face is clean shaven and
text: his hair is wetted back. His shirt, still filthy, is tucked
text: into his pants.
text: He whistles and works by the light of a small fire nearby.
text: Ellis steps out from behind a tree. He's holding the grocery
text: sack that was left on his houseboat.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
speaker_heading: MUD!
text: Mud, hearing the voice, quickly puts down his tools and turns
text: to the woods. He smooths his clothes down.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: What you say there?!
text: Ellis appears out of the dark, followed by Neckbone. Mud's
text: eyes search the treeline for Juniper.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: What you say Ellis?
text: Ellis can't look him in the eye.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: We got that motor.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Is Juniper okay?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Where is she?
dialog: 89.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: She didn't meet up with us.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: What happened? Was it Carver?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: It wasn't Carver.
text: Mud straightens up, prepares for the news.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: What's goin' on Ellis?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: She was supposed to meet us on the
dialog: side of the motel. She never
dialog: showed up. We went asking for her.
dialog: The motel clerk told us she went to
text: a bar out on 61.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: We tracked her down. She was there
dialog: with another guy.
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: They were together.
text: Mud's face drops. He walks to the fire and shakes a cooking
text: pot resting in the coals. The pot bubbles with roof tar.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: She probably thought Carver was on
dialog: to her.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: She knew the plan Mud. She just
dialog: didn't show up.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: What was she doin' with the other
dialog: guy?
text: Ellis hesitates, not wanting to say. Mud pushes.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: What were they doin' Ellis?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: They were playin' pool. Drinkin'.
text: He was close up on her. They were
dialog: laughin'. He kissed her on the
dialog: neck.
text: Mud nods.
dialog: 90.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: And that's how it is.
text: He takes the pot of roofing tar over to the boat and begins
text: pasting some of the newly replaced boards with a flat stick.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: What do you want us to do?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Just go home Ellis.
text: Ellis looks at Neckbone, then sets the grocery sack on the
dialog: ground.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Tom left this for you.
text: They slowly retreat into the woods and disappear.
text: Mud turns back to the campfire and shoves the pot into the
text: ashes. His eyes, soft and red, reflect the flame.
scene_heading: 102 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - NIGHT 102
text: Ellis and Neckbone motor away from the island in the flat
text: bottom boat. They look back at the shore.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You think it's all right to leave
dialog: him alone?!
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: I doubt it!
text: Neckbone sees Ellis' concern.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll sleep over at your house
dialog: tonight! We can check on him first
dialog: thing tomorrow!
text: Ellis nods. As they head further up river, the island grows
text: smaller, silhouetted by the moonlight.
scene_heading: 103 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - MORNING 103
text: Neckbone snores, sprawled out on top of a sleeping bag on the
text: floor. Ellis sits up in bed with something on his mind.
text: He gets up and steps gingerly over Neckbone to exit the room.
scene_heading: 104 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DEN - CONTINUOUS 104
text: The house is silent. Ellis slips into the kitchen and picks
text: up the phone receiver mounted on the cabinet.
dialog: 91.
dialog: 
text: He pulls the cord out to stand with his face in the corner.
text: He dials, waits, and speaks softly into the receiver.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Hello? Is May Pearl there...This
dialog: is Ellis...I called yesterday, you
dialog: give her my message?...My name is
dialog: Ellis. I'm her boyfriend...Oh,
dialog: she's asleep...I said she's asleep?
text: The front door flies open. Senior storms headlong toward
text: Ellis. He shouts.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
speaker_heading: MARY LEE!
text: Ellis turns as Senior yanks the phone by the cord. It snaps
text: out of Ellis' hand and smashes apart on the floor. Ellis
text: flinches at the sight of his father flying at him.
speaker_heading: SENIOR (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell have you been doing?
dialog: WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOIN'?!!
text: Senior grabs Ellis by the arms and shoves him against the den
text: wall. Mary Lee comes running from her room.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
scene_heading: SENIOR! SENIOR DAMMIT!
text: She slaps at her husband's arms and back. He swats her away.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: You tell her. You tell her what
dialog: you've been up to.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I don't know what you're sayin'.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: Take your hands off him Senior!
text: Senior keeps Ellis pinned to the wall with his left hand. He
text: opens up and addresses Mary Lee with his right.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: J.J. Crawford said a boat motor
dialog: went missin' from his stock yard.
dialog: Said his daughter saw this one and
dialog: his friend haulin' it off.
text: This makes Mary Lee pause.
speaker_heading: SENIOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Now you tell me right now, did you
dialog: steal that motor?
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: We didn't steal it.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: Lie to me again.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: We thought it was junk. We didn't
dialog: think it was worth anything.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: Ellis?
text: A cool anger rushes over Senior's face. He releases Ellis
text: and takes a step back.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: You tell me I raised a thief?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I'm not a thief.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: You take property that's not yours.
dialog: Property that belongs to another
dialog: man. That junk is his livelihood.
dialog: I'm ashamed of you.
text: Ellis drops his head. His face flushed.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: Senior.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: (to Mary Lee)
dialog: Shut your mouth. You think you can
dialog: take things and not have him see
dialog: it? Neither one of you has any
dialog: respect for a man's livelihood. A
dialog: life that puts clothes on your back
dialog: and food in your stomach.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: Don't you blame this on me. One
dialog: doesn't have a thing to do with the
dialog: other and you know it.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: Don't tell me what I know. If you
dialog: can steal a man's life out from
dialog: under him in front of your son and
dialog: think he won't take a lesson from
dialog: it than you're even dumber than you
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Stop it dad.
dialog: 93.
dialog: 
text: Senior volleys a finger at Ellis.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: She's raisin' you a snake like
dialog: herself, and you can curl up with
dialog: her `fore I give a damn. You just
dialog: remember this when you watch them
dialog: rip this house apart board by
dialog: board. You Hear Me!
text: Mary Lee slaps Senior hard. He turns to her, saying nothing.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: You're a man who's never had the
dialog: strength to support his own life.
dialog: I never asked you for a thing, and
dialog: I've never took a thing from you
dialog: that I couldn't provide for on my
dialog: own. If they do tear my home apart
dialog: the only joy I'll have in my heart
dialog: is knowin' that they'll be tearing
dialog: you out of my life for good.
text: She wipes her eyes and turns her attention to Ellis.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ellis. You'll return that motor
dialog: from where you found it and you'll
dialog: apologize in person to the man you
dialog: took it from. I won't hear about
dialog: anything like this again.
text: Mary Lee walks to the front door. She collects her purse and
text: keys and exits quietly.
text: Senior and Ellis stand in silence, which feels even more
text: uncomfortable than the shouting. Ellis finally speaks.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I can't take that motor back. But
dialog: I'll pay him for it. I'll pay him
dialog: what he wants for it.
text: Senior, stoic, pivots his body away from the boy.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: I don't care what you do Ellis.
text: Senior retreats to the bedroom. Ellis is left alone in the
dialog: wake.
text: He looks to his room. The door opens slightly and Neckbone
text: takes a step out. Neckbone doesn't say anything. He just
text: bites at his lip, sympathy for his friend.
dialog: 94.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 105 EXT. ISLAND SHORE LANDING - DAY 105
text: Charred hunks of driftwood smolder in a ruined pile on the

speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: What the hell's all this?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
text: It's a bonfire.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: I guess he didn't care about bein'
dialog: seen.
text: Ellis kicks at one of the burned logs. He bends down and
text: finds the bottle of Jack Daniels, smashed.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
text: He had something else on his mind.
dialog: Come on.
text: Ellis leads Neckbone into the treeline.
scene_heading: 106 EXT. ISLAND WOODS/CREEK - DAY 106
text: Mud's yellow shirt hangs, partially ripped, from a tree

scene_heading: 107 EXT. ISLAND WOODS AND SOUTHERN SHORE - DAY 107
text: The boys watch Mud through the trees at a distance. He's
text: crouched on the deck of the boat fiddling with wiring. Mud,
text: giving no sign he sees the boys, yells out to them.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: What are ya'll hidin' for?
text: Mud drops the wiring and scales down to the bank. They
text: emerge from the woods. Ellis carries the yellow shirt.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: We found your shirt.
text: Ellis tosses it to him. Mud tosses it back.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Keep it. I don't need it anymore.
text: Mud goes to the motor at the rear to tinker with more wires.
dialog: 95.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: We saw what's left of your bonfire.
speaker_heading: (NO RESPONSE)
dialog: Somebody could've seen you.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You do some drinkin' last night?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I did a lot of drinkin' last night.

text: pale and his manner is curt.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Neck I'm gonna need you here to get
dialog: the motor runnin'. Ellis I need
dialog: you to do something else for me.
text: Mud removes a folded note from his back pocket.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: I need you to take this to Juniper.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Okay Mud.
text: Ellis takes the letter. Mud goes back to the boat motor. He
text: motions to Neckbone to join him.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Let's go.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You still takin' Juniper?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: I had a dream last night. I saw
text: Juniper laying in a field with
dialog: another man. They were making
dialog: love. I walked out into the field.
dialog: Walked toward `em. I was so angry
dialog: the tips of my ears were burnin'.
dialog: That's how I knew I was gonna kill
dialog: this man. But when I got up close
dialog: enough, I saw that the man she was
dialog: with had tattoos on his back, just
dialog: like mine. I moved in closer and
text: the guy turns his head back toward
dialog: me. Hair for hair, dead truth, the
dialog: guy she was with was me.
text: Mud ducks back under the motor. Ellis looks at Neckbone,
dialog: worried.
dialog: 96.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll finish the boat, but I'd be
dialog: surprised if I live long enough to
dialog: sail on it. A vision of yourself
dialog: is a sure sign of death. Neck can
dialog: you grab me a socket wrench?
text: Neckbone and Ellis walk to the toolbox sitting nearby. They
text: crouch by it, speaking quietly.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: You be all right?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Yeah. What about you?
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: He'll be okay.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Can I borrow your bike?
text: Neckbone fishes the key out of his pocket. Hesitates.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Don't tump it.
text: Ellis nods. Neckbone walks over to Mud with the toolbox.
text: Letter in hand, Ellis gives a final look toward Mud's labor
text: and walks back into the woods. On his way, he stops to hang
text: Mud's shirt on a tree branch.
scene_heading: 108 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAY 108
text: Ellis rides in the flat bottom boat alone. He stares at the
text: letter in his hand.
scene_heading: 109 EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY - DAY 109
text: Ellis sits on the dirt bike. He scans the parking lot. No
text: black Lincoln. His eyes stop on a green pick-up. Miller,
text: sits inside.
text: Ellis looks around and finds a pay phone nearby. He gets off
text: the bike and walks toward it. Ellis removes the flier Carver
text: gave him. He dials a phone number copied at the bottom.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Hello. I saw the guy you're
dialog: lookin' for...Yeah, he's crazy
dialog: lookin'. Saw him at the Wal-mart
dialog: outside of Gillet. He was buyin'
dialog: some beanie weenie...'bout five
dialog: minutes ago.
dialog: 97.
dialog: 
text: Ellis hangs up the phone. He walks back over to the bike,
text: climbs on and waits.
text: After a moment, he watches as Miller's green pick-up pulls
text: out of the Piggly Wiggly parking lot and races away. Ellis
text: cranks the bike.
scene_heading: 110 EXT. EXECUTIVE INN/JUNIPER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 110
text: Ellis, at a slight crouch, keeps his eyes on the Piggly
text: Wiggly parking lot. The green pick-up is nowhere in sight.
text: At Juniper's door, he knocks twice, softly. The door swings
text: opens. Juniper stands there, holding a lit cigarette.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER
dialog: I was wonderin' when I'd see you.
text: Ellis checks over his shoulder and walks inside
scene_heading: 111 INT. EXECUTIVE INN/JUNIPER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 111
text: The bed is unmade and the room is a bit of a mess. Ellis
text: keeps his head down. Juniper closes the door and takes a
text: seat on the edge of the bed. She grabs the remote control
text: and mutes the television.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER
dialog: I'm sorry about last night. I
dialog: didn't plan on...
text: Before she can finish Ellis has fished the letter out of his
text: pocket and holds it out to her.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I'm supposed to give this to you.
text: Juniper takes the letter.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER
dialog: Okay.
text: Ellis goes to the door. He pulls the bedroom curtain back
text: slightly to check the parking lot. The coast is clear.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you read it?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: No. I gotta go.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER
dialog: Ellis?
text: He turns to her.
dialog: 98.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUNIPER (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: All you had to do was be there.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER
dialog: I couldn't.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Then why'd you even come here?
speaker_heading: JUNIPER
dialog: I came here to leave with him. I
dialog: really did. But now...now I guess
dialog: I just came to say goodbye.
text: His eyes fall to the floor.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't know us Ellis. We've
dialog: been headin' this way for a long
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I know he'd do anything for you.
text: She puts her cigarette out in a Coke can on the floor.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER
dialog: You really believe that?
text: Ellis nods. Juniper speaks to him gently, almost smiling.
text: It's a look of resignation.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Mud's a born liar. That's what
dialog: makes him so likable. He makes
dialog: people feel good about themselves.
dialog: He's a romantic. I don't think he
dialog: means to hurt people. But when
dialog: people get close to him, that's
dialog: what happens.
text: Ellis watches her as she goes to the sink and wets the end of
text: a towel. She dabs her eyes at the mirror.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER (CONT'D)
dialog: I do love him Ellis. But I can't
dialog: spend the rest of my life runnin'
dialog: with him. I may not know what kind
dialog: of life I want, but I know that's
dialog: not it.
text: Her back to him, Ellis watches as she unfolds the letter and
text: begins reading. He angles himself to see her face in the
text: mirror. He watches her eyes scanning the words. No emotion.
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
text: She finishes, folds the letter back up, then turns to him.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell him I understand.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: What's it say?
speaker_heading: JUNIPER
dialog: It says it's over. Tell him I've
dialog: packed my things. Tell him I've
dialog: gone.
text: She takes a deep breath and smiles at him.
speaker_heading: JUNIPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Bye Ellis.
text: Ellis turns and walks out.
scene_heading: 112 EXT. EXECUTIVE INN/JUNIPER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 112
text: Ellis, dejected, no longer bothers to look over his shoulder.
text: He walks to the staircase but stops there. Feeling the need
text: to say something more, he goes back to her room.
text: He puts his knuckle flat on the door but hesitates. He leans
text: over and looks through the window.
text: The sliver in the curtain gives him a glimpse. Juniper is
text: curled up on the end of the bed. She is sobbing.
text: Ellis watches longer than he should before pulling his head
text: away from the window. Ellis heads back downstairs.
scene_heading: 113 EXT. INTERSECTION/SONIC DRIVE-IN - DAY 113
text: Ellis, riding the dirtbike, looks to his left into the Sonic
text: Drive-In parking lot. The high school kids have gathered
dialog: there again.
text: He notices a rust colored Ford coup. The driver, an older
text: kid named KYLE(18), sits beside May Pearl laughing.
text: Ellis steers into traffic and crosses the street. He pulls
text: onto a patch of grass at the edge of the Sonic parking lot.
text: In one motion, Ellis tumps the bike on its side and makes a b-
dialog: line for the coup.
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE CAR,
text: Kyle's hand is on May Pearl's knee.
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: So what'd she say?
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: She said she didn't like him that
dialog: much. I told her I thought he was
dialog: all right.
text: Ellis appears with his elbows in the driver's side window.
text: He sticks his head so far in the door that Kyle has to lean
text: back in his seat to make room. May Pearl is surprised. Kyle
text: snorts out a laugh.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You get my phone calls?
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I've been callin' you.
dialog: (motions with his head)
dialog: Who's this guy?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Get your head outta my car kid.
text: Ellis takes his right elbow and quickly knocks Kyle in the
text: mouth. It splits his upper lip. Kyle grabs his face.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit!
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: Ellis!
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I called you twice yesterday. Your
dialog: sister didn't tell you?
text: Kyle slings the door open knocking Ellis to the pavement.
text: From the ground, Ellis can see that Kyle is big and
text: considerably tougher than the skinny kid he punched before.
text: Kyle's friends from other cars take notice and begin to
text: converge on them.
text: Ellis makes a move for Kyle's legs but is kicked back to the
text: pavement. Kyle straddles him on the ground and punches him.
text: Another punch to Ellis' face. May Pearl is out of the car
text: and yelling.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: Kyle! Stop it Kyle!
dialog: 101.
dialog: 
text: May Pearl pulls Kyle by the collar. By his own will, he
text: raises off of Ellis, keeping an eye on him.
text: A streak of blood stretches from Ellis' nose to his ear. He
text: gets to his feet, dazed.
text: Ellis wipes at his nose and sees May Pearl shove Kyle. Kyle
text: smiles and turns to his friends, who laugh. The CROWD that
text: has collected consists of older high school guys and girls.
text: Ellis steps toward May Pearl and is met with a shove too.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell are you doin' here
dialog: Ellis?!
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: You can't just run up and punch
dialog: people I'm with!
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I'm sorry, I just wanted to know
dialog: why you hadn't called me back.
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: Why would I call you back Ellis?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Because you're my girlfriend.
text: The crowd is watching.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: I'm not your girlfriend! We went
dialog: on one date. One!
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: We kissed.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: That doesn't matter!
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Yeah but...
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: But what Ellis?! What did you
dialog: expect?!
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I love you.
dialog: 102.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: You're fourteen!
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Don't. Wait. We can make this
dialog: work. We can figure it out. I
dialog: love you.
speaker_heading: MAY PEARL
dialog: What?
text: Ellis is losing it. His eyes are red. He looks at the crowd
text: of kids. There are smiles and some snickering. May Pearl is
text: speechless. She just stares at him.
text: Ellis turns and walks back to the dirt bike.
text: May Pearl's girlfriends gather around her. She shakes her
text: head, dumbstruck.
text: Ellis lifts the bike off the ground. He looks back at May
text: Pearl who appears to be shrugging off the whole affair in
text: front of her friends. Ellis speeds off.
scene_heading: 114 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT/RIVERBANK - DAY 114
text: A fire snaps and pops on the riverbank next to Ellis'
dialog: houseboat.
text: Ellis drags a piece of particle board from a trash pile
text: nearby. He drops the board onto the fire and stands back to
text: watch the blaze. Neckbone's bike leans on a tree behind him.
text: Senior's truck rattles to a stop in the gravel just down the
text: bank. He jumps out of the cab exasperated by the fire his
text: son has started by their home.
speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: What the hell are you doin'?!
text: Ellis says nothing. He doesn't move. Senior, continuing to
text: yell, runs and drags a hose up from the houseboat.
speaker_heading: SENIOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Ellis dammit! What the hell's
dialog: wrong with you?!
text: The fire hisses as Senior turns the hose on it.
speaker_heading: SENIOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Ellis? Look at me.
text: Ellis finally looks up at his father. A phone RINGS from
text: inside the houseboat. Senior holds the hose in front of him.
speaker_heading: SENIOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Take it. Put this damn thing out.
dialog: 103.
dialog: 
text: Ellis takes the hose as Senior stomps on board to catch the
text: phone. Ellis drops the hose.
text: Senior's voice, speaking into the telephone, faintly carries
text: outside. He's yelling. Ellis turns his head to listen.
speaker_heading: SENIOR (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't give a shit! Fine! I
dialog: don't care what you do! I'm done
dialog: with it!
text: Ellis moves around the fire so he can see the houseboat
text: through the flames. He hears the phone SLAM down.
text: Senior appears at the back door. He stares at Ellis through
text: the fire. Ellis moves to the side but realizes Senior isn't
text: staring at him. He's staring at the fire.
text: Senior disappears back into the house. There is a commotion.
text: Ellis watches as Senior bursts out of the house holding an
text: armful of woman's clothes. Senior walks up to the bonfire
text: and begins tossing clothes on top piece by piece.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Ellis watches as dresses and blouses begin to shrivel up in
dialog: the flames.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop it! That's mom's stuff! STOP
dialog: IT!
text: Ellis shoves at Senior. He easily counters the boy with his
text: arm and continues tossing the clothes into the fire. Ellis
text: is screaming and crying.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: STOP IT! STOP!
text: Ellis tries yanking the remaining clothes out of his father's
text: hands but Senior shakes him off. Ellis stumbles. He watches
text: with tears as Senior tosses all of the clothes on.
text: Senior watches his wife's clothes burn. Ellis backs away to
text: the bike. He climbs on, cranks the engine and speeds off.

speaker_heading: MUD

speaker_heading: NECKBONE

text: Ellis emerges from the treeline. Mud sees him and hops down
text: from the boat. He walks up to him.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: What'd she...
text: Ellis punches Mud with as much force as he can muster. It's
text: barely enough to turn Mud's face, but it stuns him.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You're a liar. Makin' two kids run
dialog: around doin' work you're too scared
dialog: to do yourself. Makin' me tell her
dialog: it's over `cause you're too scared
dialog: to do it yourself.
text: Mud steps back and gives the boy his space. Neckbone has
text: made his way over and watches from behind Mud.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You said you loved her and you
dialog: lied. You gave up on her and she
dialog: gave up on you just like everybody
dialog: else. I trusted you. Bonfires and
text: crosses. Wolf's eye bullshit.
text: Mud tries to approach him but the boy explodes, shoving him.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: EVERYTHING YOU'VE TOLD ME WAS A

text: Ellis walks through the woods. Neckbone follows.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Ellis! Ellis, stop for a second!
text: Neckbone watches as Ellis reaches the tree trunk that bridges

text: miss a step. He SLIPS.
text: Neckbone sees Ellis disappear down into the creek bed.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: ELLIS!
text: Neckbone rushes over. He cranes his neck out to peer over
text: the edge, a solid eight foot drop into the creek.

text: He snags it and darts into the woods.
scene_heading: 120 EXT. ISLAND WOODS/CREEK - DAY 120
text: Mud streaks through the woods as he gets his other arm
text: through the shirt sleeve. He reaches the creek.
text: Without hesitating, Mud leaps down into the water, scoops
text: Ellis into his arms and scales up the opposite side of the

text: chases after them.

speaker_heading: MUD

text: pulls up his shirt.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: IS HE OKAY?! Is he bit?!
text: Mud notices Ellis' jeans leg riding up. He pulls the jeans
text: back. A BITE in the middle of his calf. It's a bluish
text: bruise with two distinct red dots. The skin around the bite
text: has already begun to swell.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Shit.
text: He rips the jeans up to the thigh. Mud tears a section of
text: cloth from the bottom of his own shirt and creates a
text: tourniquet just below Ellis' knee.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: What time is it?
text: Mud pulls a black Sharpie out of his pocket. Neckbone
text: doesn't answer, just stares.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: WHAT TIME IS IT?!

dialog: 
text: Neckbone checks his watch.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE

text: Mud draws a line on Ellis' leg just above the swollen bite.
text: He writes, "418".
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Yell out every 10 minutes!
text: Mud elevates Ellis' leg then gently cups his head. He dabs
text: the gash on Ellis' forehead.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Is he gonna be okay?!
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: We just need to get him to a

speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: My bike should be just over that
dialog: ridge!
text: Mud looks at Ellis' leg. The swelling has crept up his
text: thigh. Black lines with numbers mark its progress: "428,

dialog: 108.

text: 123 AT THE BIKE, 123
text: Mud straddles it, turning Ellis' body so they are face to

text: Neckbone makes it to the top of the ridge in time to see Mud
text: disappear into the trees.
scene_heading: 124 EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY 124
text: Mud speeds the dirt bike down the two-lane highway. He's far

text: Coming up on a slow moving pick-up overloaded with junk, Mud
text: veers into the opposing lane.
scene_heading: ONCOMING TRAFFIC.
text: Mud darts back to his lane in time to miss a semi.

speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)

text: They take Ellis from Mud's arm, place him on the gurney, and
text: speed him into the back of the clinic.
text: The commotion gone, the reception area feels oddly still.
text: Mud takes a deep breath.
text: He looks to his right. Patients stare at him. He's beyond
text: disheveled. He's crazy looking.

scene_heading: 131 EXT. BLACK BAYOU - NIGHT 131
text: The night sky is dark purple. An unnatural color.
dialog: 111.
dialog: 
text: Ellis is on his back. Eyes closed. His head jostles at the
text: SOUND of THUMPING. More THUMPING. It sounds like the hood
text: of a car denting in.
text: His eyes open. He stares up at an absurdly full moon. It's
text: so bright it totally silhouettes the tree branches overhead.
text: The THUMPING continues. Ellis puts his hands on the edge of
text: the flat-bottom boat he's floating in and pulls himself up.
text: He leans over the side to see what's causing the noise.
text: The water is jet black. The entire bayou pulsates. Ellis'
text: eyes grow wide as the THUMPING reveals itself.
text: THE BAYOU IS FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH SNAKES.
text: The moonlight illuminates their shiny black backs as they
text: twist and churn in what seems like one giant ball of snakes.
text: Ellis lies back in the boat bringing his arms close to his
text: chest. He flinches at each THUMP. His eyes squeeze shut.
scene_heading: 132 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - NIGHT 132
text: His eyes open. Ellis bolts up in bed covered in a cold
text: sweat. Mary Lee places a palm on his chest.
speaker_heading: MARY LEE

speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Where am I?
speaker_heading: MARY LEE
dialog: You're home. We got you home.
text: Ellis takes a second to get his bearings. His mother lifts a

speaker_heading: SENIOR
dialog: You had us scared son.
text: Senior steps forward and kisses Ellis on the forehead.
text: Staying close to his face.
speaker_heading: SENIOR (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)

speaker_heading: MARY LEE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ELLIS

speaker_heading: SENIOR

speaker_heading: MARY LEE

scene_heading: 133 EXT. ISLAND/SOUTHERN SHORE - NIGHT 133
text: Mud and Neckbone shove against the back of the boat trailer.
text: The wheels of the trailer rock at the edge of the bank's

text: and Neckbone dismantled line a runway into the water.
dialog: 113.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUD
speaker_heading: (STRAINING)
dialog: Almost there.
text: The wheels finally turn over. The trailer rolls down the
text: bank and splashes into the water. The boat shimmies.
text: Mud and Neckbone follow the trailer into knee deep water and
text: shove on the boat. A final push jettisons it into the river.
text: They step back as the boat drifts out. A rope tied to its
text: back becomes taught as it stretches from a tree on shore.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
text: The sun does shine on a dog's ass
dialog: some days.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE

speaker_heading: MUD

speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: I owe you your end of the deal.
text: Mud removes the pistol from the back of his jeans.
text: Neckbone's eyes light up. Mud hands it over and Neckbone
text: immediately notices a hole where the clip is missing.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE
dialog: Where the bullets?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: The deal was for the gun, not the
dialog: bullets.
speaker_heading: NECKBONE

speaker_heading: MUD

scene_heading: 134 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 134

text: boat. They paddle with their hands. Approaching in silence.
scene_heading: 135 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - NIGHT 135
text: Ellis stares at the ceiling, unable to sleep. A TAP comes

text: in. He whispers.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Ellis?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Mud?
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Yeah.
text: Mud pulls his body through the window. It's tight but he

text: survey of the dark room. Ellis begins to get out of bed.
speaker_heading: MUD (CONT'D)
dialog: No, don't get up.
text: Mud motions him back down and pulls the chair from the desk
text: over to the bed. They speak in hushed voices.
speaker_heading: ELLIS

speaker_heading: MUD

scene_heading: 137 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - CONTINUOUS 137
speaker_heading: MUD

speaker_heading: ELLIS

speaker_heading: MUD

speaker_heading: ELLIS

speaker_heading: MUD

text: Mud smiles.
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: No. I'm not. But maybe from here

text: A SHOTGUN BLAST rips a fist-sized hole in the flimsy interior
text: wall. Mud, as if by reflex, yanks Ellis from the sheets and
text: shoves him under the bed.
scene_heading: BOOM. BOOM.
text: Bits of sheetrock fall like snow flakes as more holes blast
text: through the bedroom wall. Mud flinches with each shot. He
text: covers his own head with one hand and the boy with the other.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Mud?!
speaker_heading: MUD
dialog: Stay put! JUST STAY UNDER THERE!
text: The SOUND of shotgun shells being slipped into the chamber.
text: Mud gets to a crouch. Through the holes in the wall, Mud
text: makes out Nelson, the fat bounty hunter, reloading his gun.
speaker_heading: 138 IN THE DEN, 138
text: Nelson finishes reloading. The riddled bedroom wall hangs in
text: front of him. A door opens behind him. He swivels around.
text: Senior, in a robe, rushes from his bedroom with a pistol
text: leveled. He's met with a shotgun blast just above his head.
text: Pellets nick his face. Senior hits the ground and elbows his

text: Through the holes Mud sees Nelson approaching Ellis' bedroom.
text: He runs for the window at the foot of the bed. Another

scene_heading: 140 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 140
text: Mud crashes headfirst onto the edge of the houseboat grasping
text: for anything to keep from sliding off. His hand catches a
text: metal deck cleat. It bends under his weight but holds.
text: Mud gets to his feet and is met by the tip of a rifle.
text: Miller, the man from the cafe, stands poised to fire.
text: Mud's hand slips to the back of his pants for his pistol.
text: NOTHING. He looks to the flat-bottom tied at the far edge of
text: the boat. No sign of Neckbone.
text: Miller's finger curls around the trigger.
text: SUDDENLY, a BULLET snicks through Miller's neck.
text: Mud flinches. Miller's hand comes up to his neck but can't
text: hold the blood running from it. He topples into the water.
scene_heading: 141 EXT. TOM BLANKENSHIP'S HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 141
text: Tom Blankenship sits in the folding chair on the roof of his

text: RIFLE complete with scope. The long suitcase from the photo
text: in Tom's house sits open at his feet. It has compartments
text: for the disassembled rifle.
text: Tom quickly raises to a new firing position. He squints an
text: eye, searching for another target.
text: A141 From this vantage point, Ellis' houseboat is clearly visible;
speaker_heading: A141
text: partially lit by the two flood lights. FOUR other BOUNTY
text: HUNTERS swarm the boat.
scene_heading: 142 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - CONTINUOUS 142
text: Still under the bed, Ellis tries to hold his breath as
text: Nelson's boots step into the room. They pause for a moment,
text: before sluggishly struggling through the bedroom window.
scene_heading: 143 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 143
text: Mud rushes to untie the flat-bottom.
dialog: 118.
dialog: 
text: A BULLET splinters the corner of the dock sending shards of
text: wood into Mud's hand. He sees TWO more GUNMEN skirting
text: toward him on the deck of the houseboat.
text: Mud takes cover against the wall and finds the muzzle of
text: Nelson's gun teetering out Ellis' window. He grabs the
text: muzzle and yanks the shotgun free.
text: Nelson, stuck in the window, looks up in time to take a rifle

text: 146 ON THE RIVERBANK, 146
text: Carver turns to Neckbone.
speaker_heading: CARVER

speaker_heading: MUD

speaker_heading: MUD

text: Hearing footsteps, he cracks the door open. He sees Mud
text: standing in the den. Senior cocks his pistol
speaker_heading: 149 IN THE DEN, 149
text: The front door is KICKED open. Mud dives behind a Lazy Boy
text: as a Bounty Hunter fires through the doorway.
text: The back of the Lazy Boy explodes in fluff and fabric. Mud
text: raises up to return fire, forcing the Man back out the door.
text: Mud crouches back behind the Lazy Boy. Unbeknownst to him,
text: another MAN appears outside two sliding glass doors. The Man
text: raises his rifle at Mud.
text: One of Tom's bullets rips through the Man's chest and
text: shatters the glass door. Mud flinches. Another Hunter steps
text: into the now broken door frame. Mud FIRES the shotgun,
text: blowing the man into the patio grill.
text: A149 Mud can see Tom's houseboat silhouetted across the A149
text: bayou. A muzzle FLASH sparks from the top of Tom's
text: boat. This makes Mud smile.
text: 150 The Front Door kicks open again and more pellets shatter 150
text: through the den. Mud raises to return fire.

scene_heading: 155 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DEN - CONTINUOUS 155
