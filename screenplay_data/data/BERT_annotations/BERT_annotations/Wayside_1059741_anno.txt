scene_heading: NOW UNDER BLACK, a CARD --
speaker_heading: SATURDAY
text: The rapping, at first tentative and polite, grows insistent.
text: Then we hear someone get out of bed.
speaker_heading: MILES (O.S.)
dialog: ...the fuck...
text: A DOOR is opened, and the black gives way to BLINDING WHITE
text: LIGHT, the way one experiences the first glimpse of day amid,
dialog: say, a hangover.
text: A WORKER is there.
speaker_heading: MILES (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: WORKER
dialog: Hi, Miles. Can you move your car,
dialog: please?
speaker_heading: MILES (O.S.)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: WORKER
dialog: The painters got to put the truck
dialog: in, and you didn't park too good.
speaker_heading: MILES (O.S.)
dialog: (a sigh, then --)
dialog: Yeah, hold on.
text: He closes the door with a SLAM.
scene_heading: EXT. MILES'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE --
scene_heading: SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA
text: Wearing only underwear, a bathrobe and clogs, MILES RAYMOND
text: comes out of his unit and heads toward the street. He passes
text: some SIX MEXICANS waiting to work.
text: He climbs into his twelve-year-old CONVERTIBLE SAAB, parked
text: far from the curb and blocking part of the driveway. The car
text: starts fitfully.
text: As he pulls away, the guys begin backing up the truck.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Miles rounds the corner and finds a new parking spot.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: He cuts the engine, exhales a long breath and brings his
text: hands to his head in a gesture of headache pain or just
text: anguish. He leans back in his seat, closes his eyes, and
text: soon NODS OFF.
scene_heading: INT. MILES'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: The door bursts open. Miles runs into the kitchen, looking
text: just past camera.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Fuck!
speaker_heading: WHIP PAN TO --
text: THE MICROWAVE CLOCK that reads 10:50.
scene_heading: ON THE PHONE --
text: Miles hurriedly throws clothes into a suitcase.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yeah, no, I know I said I'd be there
dialog: by noon, but there's been all this
dialog: work going on at my building, and
dialog: it's like a total nightmare, and I
dialog: had a bunch of stuff to deal with
dialog: this morning. But I'm on my way. I'm
dialog: out the door right this second. It's
dialog: going to be great. Yeah. Bye.
scene_heading: INT. MILES'S BATHROOM - DAY
dialog: ON THE TOILET --
text: Miles has a BOOK propped open on his knees. He turns a page,
text: lost in his reading.
speaker_heading: LATER --
text: Miles SHOWERS.
scene_heading: IN THE MIRROR --
text: Miles FLOSSES.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY
text: Miles finally makes it to the front of the line.
speaker_heading: BARISTA
dialog: Hey, Miles.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Hey, Simon. Triple espresso, please.
speaker_heading: BARISTA
dialog: Rough night, huh?
dialog: (ringing it up)
dialog: For here?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No, I'm running late. Make it to go.
dialog: And give me a New York Times and...
dialog: (scanning the display
dialog: case)
dialog: ...a spinach croissant.
scene_heading: EXT. 5 FREEWAY ENTRANCE RAMP - DAY
text: Miles's Saab chugs up the ramp and merges.
scene_heading: INSERT - NEW YORK TIMES CROSSWORD PUZZLE --
text: -- pressed against the STEERING WHEEL. The puzzle is about
dialog: 1/3 finished.
scene_heading: EXT. 5 FREEWAY - DAY
text: As though from an adjacent car, we see Miles driving while

scene_heading: INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY
scene_heading: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD --
speaker_heading: A SIGN reads:
scene_heading: RANCHO PALOS VERDES
scene_heading: PALOS VERDES ESTATES
speaker_heading: 1/4 MILE
text: PAN TO MILES as he signals to change lanes. The finished

scene_heading: EXT. PALOS VERDES STREET - DAY
text: The houses on this block are blandly palatial as in so many
text: affluent Southern California suburbs.
text: Miles's car pull into the driveway behind an older BMW and
text: two LEXI. He gets out and trots toward the front door.
scene_heading: INT. ERGANIAN HOUSE - DAY
scene_heading: A GIANT PROJECTION TV --
text: In a large split-level living room displays a GOLF TOURNAMENT.
speaker_heading: WIDE --
text: Watching from the ultra-comfortable furniture are MIKE
text: ERGANIAN, a tanned, silver-haired real estate caudillo; bride-
text: to-be CHRISTINE ERGANIAN, his oldest daughter; and JACK
text: LOPATE, wearing bowling shirt, shorts and flip-flops.
text: MRS. ERGANIAN, a warm and elegant housewife, shows Miles
text: into the room.
speaker_heading: MRS. ERGANIAN
dialog: Look what the cat dragged!
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Hi, everybody.
text: Mr. Erganian and Jack get to their feet and shake hands with
text: Miles. Jack remains affable, but we can discern his genuine
dialog: irritation.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: About time you got here, bud. Mr.
dialog: Prompt.
speaker_heading: MR. ERGANIAN
dialog: We were thinking maybe you took the
dialog: wrong way and went to Tijuana and
dialog: they didn't let you back in.
text: The Erganians laugh. Miles works up a smile too.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I had to bribe them.
text: More lame laughter.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Hey, Miles.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (leaning in to kiss
dialog: Christine)
dialog: Seriously though, the freeway was
dialog: unbelievable today. Unbelievable.
dialog: Bumper to bumper the whole way. People
text: getting an early start on the weekend,
dialog: I guess. Granted I got a late start,
dialog: but still.
text: Although Mr. Erganian presses MUTE on the remote, he keeps
text: watching for an extended moment, as do Jack and Miles.
speaker_heading: MRS. ERGANIAN
dialog: Christine, why don't you ask Miles
dialog: about the cake?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Oh, good idea. Here, Miles, come to
dialog: the kitchen with me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't bother him with that. We got
dialog: to get going.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: (taking Miles's hand)
dialog: It'll just take a second.
scene_heading: INT. ERGANIAN KITCHEN - DAY
text: Jack and the Erganians surround Miles as he eats from a plate
text: with two pieces of CAKE -- one white, one dark.
speaker_heading: MRS. ERGANIAN
dialog: Jack tells us you are publishing a
dialog: book. Congratulations.
speaker_heading: MR. ERGANIAN
dialog: Yes, congratulations.
text: Miles shoots Jack a look. Mr. Erganian gets some ice cubes
text: from the refrigerator door.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yeah, well, it's not exactly finalized
dialog: yet, but, um, there has been some
dialog: interest and --
speaker_heading: MRS. ERGANIAN
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: Your friend is modest.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, Miles, don't be so modest.
dialog: Indulge them. Don't make me out to
dialog: be a liar.
speaker_heading: MR. ERGANIAN
dialog: What subject is your book? Non-
dialog: fiction?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No, it's a novel. Fiction. Although
dialog: there's a lot from my own life, so I
dialog: guess technically some of it is non-
dialog: fiction.
speaker_heading: MR. ERGANIAN
dialog: Good, I like non-fiction. There is
dialog: so much to know about the world that
dialog: I think reading a story someone just
dialog: invented is kind of a waste of time.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: So which one do you like better?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I like them both, but if pressed I'd
dialog: have to say I prefer the dark.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Christine)
dialog: See?
scene_heading: INT. SAAB - CONTINUOUS
scene_heading: IN A REAR VIEW MIRROR --
text: The Erganians wave good-bye.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE CAR --
text: Miles accelerates as he and Jack wave back.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Where the fuck were you, man? I was
dialog: dying in there. We were supposed to
text: be a hundred miles away by now.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I can't help the traffic.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Come on. You're fucking hungover.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Okay, there was a tasting last night.
dialog: But I wanted to get us some stuff
dialog: for the ride up. Check out the box.
text: Jack turns around, and starts rooting around in a CARDBOARD
scene_heading: WINE BOX.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Why did you tell them my book was
dialog: being published?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You said you had it all lined up.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No, I didn't. What I said was that
dialog: my agent had heard there was some
dialog: interest at Conundrum...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, Conundrum.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: ...and that one of the editors was
text: passing it up to a senior editor.
dialog: She was supposed to hear something
dialog: this week, but now it's next week,
dialog: and... It's always like this. It's
dialog: always a fucking waiting game. I've
dialog: been through it too many times
dialog: already.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds
dialog: like you're in to me.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: It's a long shot, all right? And
dialog: Conundrum is just a small specialty
dialog: press anyway. I'm not getting my
dialog: hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's
dialog: it. I've stopped caring.
text: Jack sits back in his seat holding up a bottle of CHAMPAGNE
text: and TWO GLASSES.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: But I know it's going to happen this
dialog: time. I can feel it. This is the
dialog: one. I'm proud of you, man. You're
dialog: the smartest guy I know.
text: Jack now begins to remove the foil from the champagne bottle.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Don't open that now. It's warm.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Come on, we're celebrating. I say we
dialog: pop it.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: That's a 1992 Byron. It's really
dialog: rare. Don't open it now. I've been
dialog: saving it!
text: Jack untwists the wire. Instantly the cork pops off, and a
text: fountain of champagne erupts.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: For Christ's Sake, Jack! You just
dialog: wasted like half of it!
text: Jack begins pouring two glasses.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Shut up.
dialog: (handing Miles a glass)
dialog: Here's to a great week.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (coming around)
dialog: Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass
dialog: behavior, I'm really glad we're
text: finally getting this time together.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You know how long I've been begging
dialog: to take you on the wine tour. I was
dialog: beginning to think it was never going
dialog: to happen.
text: They clink and drink.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, that's tasty.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: 100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard.
dialog: They don't even make it anymore.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Pinot Noir? How come it's white?
dialog: Doesn't noir mean dark?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Jesus. Don't ask questions like that
dialog: up in the wine country. They'll think
dialog: you're a moron.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Just tell me.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Color in the red wines comes from
dialog: the skins. This juice is free run,
dialog: so there's no skin contact in the
dialog: fermentation, ergo no color.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (not really listening)
dialog: Sure is tasty.
scene_heading: EXT. FREEWAY - DAY
text: The Saab heads north.
scene_heading: INT. SAAB - DAY
text: The boys continue to drink and drive.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Did you read the latest draft, by
dialog: the way?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, yeah. Yeah.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I liked it a lot. A lot of
dialog: improvements. It just seemed overall,
dialog: I don't know, tighter, more...
text: congealed or something.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: How about the new ending? Did you
dialog: like that?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh yeah. Much better.
speaker_heading: MILES
text: There is no new ending. Page 750 on
text: is exactly the same.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, then I guess it must have felt
dialog: new because everything leading up to
dialog: it was so different.
scene_heading: INT. GAS STATION #1 - DAY
text: Miles is pumping gas. Jack is stretching his legs nearby or
text: perhaps cleaning the windshield.
text: A CELLPHONE RINGS. Jack reaches into his pocket.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (looking at the phone)
dialog: It's Christine.
dialog: (snapping it open)
dialog: Hey you.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE (ON PHONE)
dialog: You guys having fun?
text: Christine's voice is so loud that Jack has to hold the phone
text: away from his ear.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have
dialog: been a blast.
scene_heading: CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Good. That's good.
dialog: A silence, then --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So what's up?
scene_heading: CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Just seeing how you're doing. And,
dialog: um, Mom and I were starting to look
text: over the seating charts again, and
dialog: we're wondering if you wanted Tony
text: Levin to sit next to the Feldmans,
dialog: or should he be at one of the singles
dialog: tables?
text: Jack looks at Miles in a mute appeal for sympathy.
scene_heading: CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: So what do you think? With the
dialog: Feldmans?
text: Jack hasn't even really heard the question.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah. The Feldmans.
text: As the conversation continues, Miles replaces the GAS PUMP,
text: screws the GAS CAP back on, and together the guys get back
text: into the car. We DRIVE AWAY WITH THEM.
scene_heading: CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Really? Because I don't know, I was
dialog: thinking that --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, then put him at the singles
dialog: table.
scene_heading: CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: The problem with that is that then
dialog: there's one extra --
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Then put him with the Feldmans.
dialog: Whatever you and your Mom decide is
dialog: fine with me.
scene_heading: CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to
dialog: include you in this decision. He's
dialog: your friend.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I didn't dismiss you. I told you
dialog: what I thought, but it didn't seem
dialog: to matter, so you decide. Besides,
dialog: this is supposed to be my time with
dialog: Miles. I hope you're not going to
dialog: call every five minutes.
scene_heading: CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: I'm not going to call every five
dialog: minutes, but this is important.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Honey, I'm just saying you know I
dialog: need a little space before the
dialog: wedding. Isn't that the point of
dialog: this? Isn't that what we talked about
dialog: with Dr. Gertler?
text: A silence. Then --
scene_heading: CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Why are you being so defensive?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't know, Christine. Perhaps
dialog: it's because I feel attacked.
scene_heading: CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: I ask you one simple question, and
dialog: suddenly I'm attacking you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Listen. I'll call you when we get
dialog: there, and we can talk about it then,
dialog: okay?
scene_heading: CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Bye.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I love you.
scene_heading: CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Bye.
text: Jack SLAMS his cellphone shut, momentarily blinded with rage.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Tony Levin? Why did you fucking invite
dialog: Tony Levin?
scene_heading: EXT. 405 FREEWAY - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The Saab heads north -- now passing through LOS ANGELES.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. SAAB - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Miles signals and begins to head for an EXIT.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Whoa, why are we getting off?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I've just got to make one quick stop.
dialog: Won't take a second.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I thought we could just say a quick
dialog: hello to my mother.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were
dialog: supposed to be up there hours ago.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: It's her birthday tomorrow. And I
dialog: don't feel right driving by her house
dialog: and not stopping in, okay? It'll
dialog: just take a second. She's right off
dialog: the freeway.
scene_heading: EXT. 101 FREEWAY - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The Saab takes an EXIT.
speaker_heading: JACK (O.S.)
dialog: How old's she going to be?
speaker_heading: MILES (O.S.)
dialog: Um... seventy... something.
speaker_heading: JACK (O.S.)
dialog: That's a good age.
speaker_heading: OMIT.
speaker_heading: OMIT.
scene_heading: EXT. CONDO COMMUNITY STREET - DUSK
text: The Saab rounds a corner and parks in front of a modest CONDO.
speaker_heading: SUPERIMPOSE:
scene_heading: OXNARD, CALIFORNIA
scene_heading: EXT. MILES'S MOTHER'S CONDO - DUSK
text: Approaching the front door, Miles pulls a BOUQUET OF FLOWERS
text: out of a plastic grocery store bag. Jack carries a bottle of
speaker_heading: CHAMPAGNE.
text: Miles pulls a BIRTHDAY CARD out of the bag too.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Wait a second.
text: He pulls a PEN from his pocket and signs it. As he licks the
text: envelope, Jack rings the bell.
text: Moments later PHYLLIS comes to the door. She is a matronly
text: older woman in a nightgown and housecoat.
scene_heading: MILES AND JACK
dialog: Surprise! Happy Birthday!
text: The boys offer up the flowers and champagne. Phyllis slurs
text: slightly as she speaks -- she's been doing some celebrating
dialog: of her own.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: My God. Miles. And Jack! What a
dialog: surprise. I can't remember the last
dialog: time you brought me flowers.
text: They hug.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: They're from both of us.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: A famous actor bringing me flowers
dialog: on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: A famous actor who's getting married
dialog: next week.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I
dialog: hope that girls knows how lucky she
dialog: is, marrying no less than Derek
dialog: Summersby.
text: The boys follow her inside.
scene_heading: INT. MILES'S MOTHER'S CONDO - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven
dialog: years ago.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Well, you were wonderful on that
dialog: show. I never understood why they
dialog: had to give you that brain tumor so
dialog: soon. Why that didn't make you the
dialog: biggest movie star in the world is a
dialog: sin. It's a sin.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: If I was, I would sing your praises
text: up and down the street until they
dialog: put me in the loony bin. Now Miles,
dialog: why didn't you tell me you were coming
dialog: and bringing this handsome man? Look
dialog: how I'm dressed. I've got to run and
dialog: put my face on.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: (over her shoulder)
dialog: Oh, stop it. Make yourselves
dialog: comfortable.
dialog: (now around the corner)
dialog: You boys hungry?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yeah, I'm hungry.
text: Jack gives Miles a look.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (low)
dialog: Just a snack. Calm down.
text: Miles leads Jack into this small condo. The TV is on, and
text: it's MESSY. Amid the newspapers and junk mail and dishes, an
text: AB-ROLLER and an ancient SCHWINN EXER-CYCLE sit forgotten in
text: a corner.
scene_heading: INT. MILES'S MOTHER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Miles finishes twisting ice trays into a MOP BUCKET as it
text: fills with water in the sink. He puts the champagne in and
dialog: carries it into the --
scene_heading: INT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: He takes a seat on the sofa next to Jack, who is watching
text: WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Let me show you something. The secret
dialog: to opening champagne is that once
dialog: the cork is released, you keep
dialog: pressure on it so you don't --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (concentrated on the
dialog: TV)
dialog: Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
text: Miles finishes opening the bottle with an elegant silence.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS (O.S.)
dialog: Ready for my close up!
text: The boys turn to see Phyllis now dolled up in thick make-up
text: and a PANTSUIT. Her eyebrows are painted and cock-eyed.
text: Overall she looks much worse than before.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Oh, champagne! Miles, why don't you
dialog: bring that out onto the lanai? I
dialog: thought we could eat on the lanai.
scene_heading: EXT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LANAI - NIGHT
text: Miles and Jack are seated in webbed chairs around a circular
text: glass table. They are mid-meal.
text: Everyone is more than a little lubricated, especially the
text: birthday girl as she returns from the kitchen with another
dialog: plate of food.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious.
dialog: Absolutely delicious.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: (sitting)
dialog: They're just leftovers.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Is it chicken?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I could have made something fancier
dialog: if a certain someone had let me know
dialog: that a certain someone was coming
dialog: for a visit with a certain special
dialog: friend. Could have made a pork roast.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: It was a surprise, Mom.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: And I could have already put clean
text: sheets on the other bed and the fold-
dialog: out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and
dialog: the twins are picking us up at 11:30
text: to go to brunch at the Sheraton.
dialog: They do a magnificent job there.
dialog: Wendy is so excited you're coming.
text: Silence. Jack freezes, his fork halfway to his mouth.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You talked to Wendy?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Just now. She's thrilled. And the
dialog: kids.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (trying to be chipper)
dialog: Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty
dialog: eager to get up to... you know, but,
dialog: uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Well, you boys do what you want. I
dialog: just think it would be nice for us
dialog: to be together as a family on my
dialog: birthday.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Uh-huh.
dialog: (wiping his mouth)
dialog: I'll be right back.
text: He gets up and heads into the house.
scene_heading: INT. MILES'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Miles heads toward...
scene_heading: INT. MILES'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: ...and goes directly to her dresser, opening a drawer filled
text: with bras, panties and stockings.
text: He burrows through his mother's lingerie until locating a
text: CAN OF RAID. A can of Raid?
text: He twists open the bottom and pulls it apart, revealing it
text: to be a SECRET STASH for valuables disguised as a common
text: household product. Inside are stacks of ONE-HUNDRED DOLLAR
speaker_heading: BILLS.
speaker_heading: MILES
text: (quickly peeling some
dialog: off)
dialog: ...six, seven, eight,...
dialog: (one more for good
dialog: luck)
dialog: Nine.
text: His task complete, he closes the drawer, and as he stuffs
text: the bills in his pocket, his glance falls upon FRAMED PHOTOS
dialog: atop the dresser --
text: -- A proud NINE-YEAR-OLD MILES poses in front of his childhood
text: San Diego home, showing off a WAGON filled with freshly
text: harvested lettuce. On the wagon is a hand-lettered sign --
dialog: "10 cents a bunch."
text: -- A Sears portrait shows the RAYMOND FAMILY: a much younger
text: Phyllis, her husband, and their two children -- a 12-year-
text: old Miles and seven-year-old Wendy.
text: -- Miles at his wedding. He and his bride VICTORIA look young
text: and attractive, their faces radiant and hopeful.
scene_heading: INT. MILES'S APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Miles enters, flushes the toilet and leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LANAI - NIGHT
text: As Miles slides open the door and takes his seat again, Jack
text: is pouring Phyllis another glass.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: And what was that other one you did,
dialog: the one where you're the jogger?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That
dialog: was for Spray and Wash.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Spray and Wash. That's the one.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, I remember the girl who was in
dialog: it with me. She was something.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I just remember you jogging. So when's
dialog: the wedding?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: This Saturday, Mom, remember? We
dialog: told you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And Miles is my best man, Mrs.
dialog: Raymond. My main man.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: (another drink of
dialog: wine)
dialog: Miles, when are you going to get
dialog: married again?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I just got divorced. Phyllis.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Two years ago, buddy.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: You should get back together with
dialog: Victoria. She was good for you.
text: Embarrassed for his friend, Jack just stares at his food.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: She was good for you.
dialog: (turning to Jack)
dialog: And so beautiful and intelligent.
dialog: You knew her, right?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you
dialog: need some money?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I'm fine.
text: Miles takes another drink of wine.

speaker_heading: WIDE --

text: adorned with all her decorative PILLOWS.
scene_heading: INT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Still in her pantsuit and smeared makeup, Phyllis lies
text: sprawled and snoring on the sofa. On the TV, ostensibly never
text: turned off the night before, is an inane CARTOON.
text: As Miles opens the front door, he spots Jack heading toward
text: the TV to turn it off. Miles waves him off.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (a loud whisper)
dialog: She'll wake up.
text: As they leave and Miles closes the front door quietly behind
text: him, we PAN to the flowers still wrapped and forgotten on a
text: side table.
scene_heading: INT. ROADSIDE IHOP - DAY
text: TWO PLATES OF FOOD float in front of two breasts tucked inside
text: a zippered uniform.
speaker_heading: WIDER --
text: Disheveled and unshaven, Jack and Miles are served breakfast
text: by a young, innocently sexy WAITRESS. Jack leers after her.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Fuck, man. Too early in the morning
dialog: for that, you know what I mean?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look
dialog: at that stuff anymore.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That's your problem, Miles.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: As if she'd even be attracted to
dialog: guys like us in the first place.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Speak for yourself. I get chicks
dialog: looking at me all the time. All ages.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: It's not worth it. You pay too big a
dialog: price. It's never free.
text: They eat in silence a moment.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You need to get laid.
text: Miles shrugs off the comment.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It'd be the best thing for you. You
dialog: know what? I'm going to get you laid
dialog: this week. That's going to be my
dialog: best man gift to you. I'm not going
dialog: to give you a pen knife or a gift
dialog: certificate or any of that other
dialog: horseshit.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I'd rather have a knife.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No. No. You've been officially
dialog: depressed for like two years now,
dialog: and you were always a negative guy
dialog: anyway, even in college. Now it's
dialog: worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching
dialog: English to fucking eighth-graders
dialog: when they should be reading what you
dialog: wrote. Your books.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I'm working on it.
text: Miles concentrates on his eggs and hash browns
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You still seeing that shrink?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I went on Monday. But I spent most
dialog: of the time helping him with his
dialog: computer.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, I say fuck therapy and what's
dialog: that stuff you take, Xanax?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: And Lexapro, yes.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, I say fuck that. You need to
dialog: get your joint worked on, that's
dialog: what you need.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Jack. This week is not about me.
dialog: It's about you. I'm going to show
dialog: you a good time. We're going to drink
dialog: a lot of good wine, play some golf,
dialog: eat some great food, enjoy the scenery
dialog: and send you off in style.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And get your bone smooched.
text: Jack spots the waitress coming out of the kitchen and motions
text: for more coffee. She nods and smiles, indicating she'll be
text: right over. Jack returns the smile and holds up a hand to
text: signal he'll wait. Jack turns back to see Miles watching
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL COAST - DAY
text: In a series of shots, the Saab -- now with its TOP DOWN --
text: makes its way onto the 101 and travels past landmarks that
dialog: those familiar with the Santa Barbara area might recognize.
text: MUSIC accompanies this sequence that anchors us into the
text: rhythm of a road trip.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY
text: The car now descends the Santa Ynez Mountains and heads toward
text: Buellton. Miles and Jack must SHOUT to be heard in the open
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You know what? Let's take the Santa
text: Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Whatever's closest, man. I need a
dialog: glass.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: These guys make top-notch Pinot and
dialog: Chardonnay. One of the best producers
dialog: in Santa Barbara county.
dialog: (looking out the window)
dialog: Look how beautiful this view is.
dialog: What a day!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I thought you hated Chardonnay.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I like all varietals. I just don't
dialog: generally like the way they manipulate
dialog: Chardonnay in California -- too much
dialog: oak and secondary malolactic
dialog: fermentation.
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA ROSA TURN-OFF - DAY
text: The Saab passes over the 101 and turns onto SANTA ROSA road.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY
text: The boys now pass vineyards of immaculate grapevines.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Jesus, what a day! Isn't it gorgeous?
dialog: And the ocean's just right over that
dialog: ridge. See, the reason this region's
dialog: great for Pinot is that the cold air
text: off the Pacific flows in at night
dialog: through these transverse valleys and
dialog: cools down the berries. Pinot's a
dialog: very thin-skinned grape and doesn't
dialog: like heat or humidity.
text: Jack looks at Miles, admiring his friend's vast learning and
dialog: articulateness.
text: The Saab now pulls of the road and makes its way down a long
text: gravel DRIVEWAY.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel
dialog: sells.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Thanks, Jack. So do I.
dialog: (noticing)
dialog: Here we are.
scene_heading: EXT. SANFORD TASTING ROOM - DAY
text: Miles brings the car to a stop in the parking lot. As they
dialog: get out and walk --
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: So what'd you guys finally decide on
dialog: for the menu?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I told you. Filet and salmon.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yeah, but how are they making the
text: salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill
dialog: sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always
dialog: have white wine with fish?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we
dialog: have to find out because it's going
dialog: to make a big difference.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (taking out his phone)
dialog: Let me call Christine.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Doesn't have to be now. Let's go
dialog: taste.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I owe her a call anyway.
text: Miles must curb his eagerness to go inside the tasting room
text: as Jack SPEED DIALS.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey, honey. So we're up here about
dialog: to taste some whites, and we need to
dialog: know how the caterers are going to
dialog: make the salmon.
text: Jack listens, then grows suddenly impatient.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, I know, I didn't forget, but we
text: wound up at Miles's mom's house, and
dialog: it got really late, and it was hard
dialog: to call, so I'm calling you now. I
dialog: said I was sorry. Yes, I did.
dialog: (to Miles)
dialog: You heard me say I was sorry, right?
text: Miles just shrugs.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Miles heard me say I was sorry.
text: As Jack gets more and more involved with the phone call, he
text: wanders off across the parking lot, progressively out of
text: earshot.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Give me a break, will you? I just
dialog: called to find out about the salmon --
dialog: for our wedding -- to be more
dialog: involved, like you said -- and all
dialog: you want to do is get into it about
dialog: last night and, okay, I'm sorry. I'm
dialog: sorry I didn't call. You're totally
dialog: right. I know, but I'm trying to
dialog: make this the best wedding I can
dialog: with the best wine we can find. Don't
dialog: I get any credit for that? Okay.
dialog: Look, I've got to go. I'm out here
text: in the parking lot, and Miles is
dialog: waiting for me...
text: And so it goes, Jack's voice rising and falling. Miles decides
dialog: to head inside.
scene_heading: INT. SANFORD TASTING ROOM - DAY
text: Miles is at the bar, TWO GLASSES in front of him. Jack walks
text: in and bellies up next to him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (proudly)
text: Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Now we're talking.
text: CHRIS BURROUGHS, a POURER in a cowboy hat and ponytail, comes
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: This is the condemned man?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Here he is. Jack, Chris. Chris, Jack.
text: Chris and Jack shake hands.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How you doing?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You guys want to start with the Vin
dialog: Gris?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sounds good.
text: TWO GLASSES are filled with small amounts of PINOT NOIR VIN
speaker_heading: GRIS.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: This is rose, right?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this
text: one is rather atypically made from
dialog: 100% Pinot Noir.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Pinot noir? Not again!
dialog: (joking, to Chris)
dialog: You know, not all Pinots are noir.
text: They laugh.
text: Miles swirls his glass in tight circles on the bar, then
text: lifts it to smell. Jack clumsily imitates Miles, perhaps
text: even spilling some wine in the process.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Let me show you.
text: We see details of what Miles now describes.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: First take your glass and examine
dialog: the wine against the light. You're
text: looking at color and clarity.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What color is it supposed to be?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Depends on the varietal. Just get a
dialog: sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery?
dialog: Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Now tip it. What you're doing here
dialog: is checking for color density as it
dialog: thins toward the rim. Tells you how
dialog: old it is, among other things, usually
dialog: more important with reds. This is a
dialog: very young wine, so it's going to
dialog: retain its color pretty solidly. Now
dialog: stick your nose in it.
text: Jack waves the glass under his nose as if it were a perfume
dialog: bottle.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Don't be shy. Get your nose in there.
text: Jack now buries his nose in the glass.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What do you smell?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
text: Miles smells.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: There's not much there yet, but you
dialog: can still find...
dialog: (more sniffs)
dialog: ...a little citrus... maybe some
dialog: strawberry... passion fruit... and
dialog: there's even a hint of like
dialog: asparagus... or like a nutty Edam
dialog: cheese.
text: Jack smells again and begins to brighten.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah,
dialog: strawberry. I'm not so sure about
dialog: the cheese.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Now set your glass down and get some
text: air into it.
text: Miles expertly swirls the wine. Jack follows suit.
speaker_heading: MILES
text: Oxygenating it opens it up, unlocks
dialog: the aroma and the flavors. Very
dialog: important. Now we smell again.
text: They do so. Jack smiles.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: That's what you do with every one.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: When do we get to drink it?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Now.
text: Jack gulps his wine down in one shot. Miles chews his before
dialog: swallowing.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How would you rate this one?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Usually they start you on the wines
dialog: with learning disabilities, but this
dialog: one's pretty damn good.
dialog: (to Chris)
dialog: This is the new one, right, Chris?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Released it about two months ago.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Nice job.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: We like it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Miles)
dialog: You know, you could work in a wine
dialog: store.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yeah, that would be a good move.
text: Now Miles notices something about Jack.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Are you chewing gum?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Want some?
scene_heading: EXT. SOLVANG, CALIFORNIA - DAY
text: The Saab passes through this Danish-themed tourist town.
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE --
speaker_heading: SOLVANG
scene_heading: EXT. BUELLTON, CALIFORNIA - DAY
text: The Saab makes its way into this very average-looking Central
text: coast town right off the freeway.
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE --
speaker_heading: BUELLTON
scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY
text: The Saab pulls into the parking lot of this motel. And look --
text: there's the WINDMILL itself, its decorative blades motionless.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: Miles and Jack enter the room and throw their suitcases onto
dialog: their respective beds.
speaker_heading: LATER --
text: The sounds of a SHOWER and OFF-KEY SINGING come from the
text: bathroom while Miles sits impatiently on the bed. He pounds
text: on the wall.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Hey Jack, hurry up!
speaker_heading: JACK (O.S.)
dialog: Just a minute!
text: Opening the bedside drawer, Miles finds a GIDEON'S BIBLE and
text: tosses it in the trash -- apparently his hotel routine.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 246 - DUSK
text: Freshly showered and dressed for dinner, Miles and Jack amble
text: along the shoulder of this busy local two-lane highway. They
text: pass a mall and a car dealership.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I thought you said it was close. Now
dialog: I'm all pitted out.
speaker_heading: MILES
text: It's not even a mile.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We should have driven.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Not with the wine list these people
dialog: have. We don't want to hold back.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You think I'm making a mistake
dialog: marrying Christine?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Whoa.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Come on, do you think I'm doing the
dialog: right thing? Tell the truth. You've
dialog: been through it.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Well, you waited for good reason,
dialog: and you proposed to Christine for
dialog: some good reason. So I think it's
dialog: great. It's time. You've got to have
dialog: your eyes open, that's all. I mean,
dialog: look at me. I thought Victoria and I
dialog: were set for life.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Christine's dad -- he's been talking
dialog: about bringing me into his property
dialog: business. Showing me the ropes. And
dialog: that's something, considering how
dialog: long it took him to get over I'm not
dialog: Armenian. So I'm thinking about it.
dialog: But I don't know, might get a little
dialog: incestuous. But Mike does pretty
dialog: well. A lot of high-end commercial
dialog: stuff.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: So you're going to stop acting?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No way. This would just provide some
dialog: stability is what I'm saying. I can
dialog: always squeeze in an audition or a
dialog: commercial here and there, you know,
dialog: keep myself in the game in case
text: something big comes along.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We're not getting any younger, right?
dialog: And my career, well, it's gotten
dialog: pretty, you know, frustrating. Even
dialog: with my new manager. Maybe it's time
dialog: to settle down.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: If that's what feels right.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (convincing himself)
dialog: It does. Feels right.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Then it's a good thing.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (nodding, feeling
dialog: better)
dialog: Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
text: Miles leads them away from the road and across a parking
text: lot. The camera PANS to reveal --
text: THE HITCHING POST, a local institution.
scene_heading: INT. HITCHING POST BAR - DUSK
text: Miles and Jack belly up. GARY, the Samoan bartender, spots
text: Miles and extends a welcoming hand.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Gary.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: When's that novel of yours coming
dialog: out? We all want to read it.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy
text: Jack. He's getting married next week.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (shaking Jack's hand)
dialog: My condolences.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What are you pouring tonight?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Lot of good stuff.
text: (looking at a row of
dialog: bottles)
dialog: Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Absolutement.
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: They have their own label that's
dialog: just outstanding.
text: Gary pours Jack and Miles a generous sample and the two men
text: swirl, sniff and taste. Jack is beginning to get the hang of
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: MILES
text: Tight as a nun's asshole but qood
dialog: concentration. Nice fruit.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah. Tight.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (to Gary)
dialog: Pour us a couple.
text: Gary fills their glasses and corks the bottle. Jack raises
text: his glass to toast.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Here's to my last week of freedom.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: It's going to be great. Here's to
dialog: us.
text: They clink their glasses and take a drink. We linger on them
text: as Miles retreats inward and a restless Jack scans the room.
scene_heading: INT. HITCHING POST DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Jack and Miles review their menus. Jack looks up and spots a
text: PRETTY WAITRESS placing an order at the bar.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Miles. Check it out.
text: Miles glances at the waitress and returns to his menu.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You know her?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Sure I know Maya.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You know that chick?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Jack, this is where I eat when I
dialog: come up here. It's practically my
dialog: office. And sometimes I have a drink
dialog: with the employees. Maya's great.
dialog: She's worked here about a year, maybe
dialog: a year and a half.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She is very hot.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: And very nice. And very married.
dialog: Check out the rock.
text: Jack leans forward and squints.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Doesn't mean shit. When Christine
dialog: was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she
dialog: wore a big engagement ring to keep
dialog: guys from hitting on her. Think it
dialog: worked? Fuck no. How do you think I
dialog: met her?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: This gal's married to I think a
dialog: Philosophy professor at UC Santa
dialog: Barbara.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So what's a professor's wife doing
text: waitressing? Obviously that's over.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You don't know anything about this
dialog: woman. Calm down. Let's just eat,
dialog: okay?
dialog: (focusing on the menu)
dialog: The duck is excellent and pairs nicely
text: with the Highliner Pinot.
text: Just then Maya comes by carrying a tray of food on her way
text: to another table.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Maya, how are you?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: I'm doing good, good. You look great.
dialog: Did you lose some weight?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been
dialog: out tasting today?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You know it. This is my friend Jack.
dialog: Jack, Maya.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (big smile)
dialog: Hiya.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: (smiling back)
dialog: Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here.
dialog: Bye, Miles.
dialog: She goes.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes
dialog: you. What else do you know about
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Well, she does know a lot about wine.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Ooooooohh. Now we're getting
dialog: somewhere.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: And she likes Pinot.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Perfect.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Jack, she's a fucking waitress in
dialog: Buellton. How would that ever work?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why do you always focus on the
dialog: negative? Didn't you see how friendly
dialog: she was to you?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: She works for tips!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're blind, dude. Blind.
text: Miles focuses again on the menu.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I also recommend the ostrich. Very
text: lean. Locally raised.
scene_heading: INT. HITCHING POST BAR - NIGHT
scene_heading: TWO BURGUNDY GLASSES --
text: are refilled with the contents of yet another bottle of
text: Hitching Post Pinot Noir.
text: Jack and Miles are enjoying a post-prandial drink.
speaker_heading: MILES
text: Looks like he's thinking about something. Then --
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I hate Tony Levin.
text: Jack swirls his wine and downs it in one gulp. Just then --
speaker_heading: MAYA
text: Walks into the bar and takes a seat a few stools down. She
text: has changed into a black cashmere sweater and corduroys,
text: lovely but tired.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: (to Gary)
dialog: Highliner, please.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That's on us.
text: Maya looks over and smiles as Gary pours her a glass from
dialog: their bottle.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Hey, guys.
text: Maya gets an American Spirit Yellow out of her purse and
text: lights it while Gary pours her a glass.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You want to join us?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: (polite)
dialog: Sure.
text: In no hurry, she takes a long sip of her wine, gets up and
text: comes down the bar.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: So how's that book of yours going,
dialog: Miles? I think you were almost done
dialog: with it last time we talked.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I finished it.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Good for you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's getting published. That's what
dialog: we're up here celebrating.
text: Miles shoots Jack a look. Jack responds with a "don't-fuck-
dialog: it-up-brother" glower.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: That's fantastic. Congratulations.
text: She offers her glass, and all clink.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: Are you a writer too?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, I'm an actor.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: A lot of TV. I was a regular on a
dialog: couple of series. And lately I've
dialog: been doing a lot of commercials.
dialog: National mostly.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Anything I'd know?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Maybe. Recognize this?
text: Jack takes a deep breath, and out comes a perfect VOICE-OVER
speaker_heading: VOICE.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: "Now with low, low 5.8% APR
dialog: financing."
text: Maya's mouth drops open and curves into a big smile.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: That's hilarious. You sound just
dialog: like one of those guys.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I am one of those guys.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: You are not.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: He is.
text: Jack launches into another one of his sure-fire hits.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (very fast)
dialog: Consult your doctor before using
dialog: this product. Side effects may include
text: oily discharge, dizziness, hives,
dialog: loss of appetite, difficulty breathing
dialog: and low blood pressure. If you have
dialog: diabetes or a history of kidney
dialog: trouble... you're fucked!
text: This makes Maya laugh a big throaty laugh. Jack joins in.
text: Nervous about Jack's aggressive flirtatiousness, Miles musters
text: a tight courtesy smile.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: (winding down)
dialog: Oh. I needed that. Thank you.
text: They all take a drink of wine.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: So what are you guys up to tonight?
text: Before Jack has a chance to speak --
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: We're pretty wiped. Probably go back
text: to the hotel and crash.
text: This makes Maya slightly embarrassed at her apparent
text: availability, but she recovers quickly, remains breezy.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a
dialog: long drive up here. Where're you
dialog: staying?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: The Windmill.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Windmill.
text: Maya downs the rest of her wine, stamps out her smoke, and
text: picks up her jean jacket and purse.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: See you.
dialog: As she leaves --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We'll catch up with you later, okay?
text: But she's gone. Jack gives Miles a slow burn look.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We'll probably go back to the hotel
dialog: and crash?
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: The guys walk drunkenly along the shoulder as CARS WHIZ BY.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: The girl is looking to party, and
dialog: you tell her we're going to go back
dialog: to our motel room and crash? Jesus,
dialog: Miles!
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The chick digs you. She lit up like
text: a pinball machine when she heard
dialog: your novel was getting published.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Now I've got another lie to live
dialog: down. Thanks, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm trying to get you some action,
dialog: but you've got to help me out just a
dialog: little bit.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Didn't seem to me like that's what
dialog: was going on. You were all over her.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Somebody had to do the talking. And
dialog: by the way, I was right. She's not
dialog: married.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: No rock. When she came to the bar,
text: sans rock.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: The screen is absolutely BLACK.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Single. Waitress. Getting off work.
text: Looking for love. A little slap and
text: tickle.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She probably went home, lit some
text: candles, put on some relaxing music,
dialog: took a nice hot bath, and laid down
text: on her bed with her favorite vibrator.
text: Jack begins to make a soft BUZZING noise, growing gradually
text: louder and more rhythmic.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Have you no shame?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Fuck you.
text: There's now a rustling noise and footsteps. Then a LIGHT is
text: flipped on in the BATHROOM.
text: Miles closes the door behind him, and the only light visible
text: is at the bottom of the bathroom door.
text: Miles PEES -- a series of semi-forced SHORT SQUIRTS. Then a
text: FLUSH as a door opens and the light goes off. Jack starts
text: BUZZING again.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Shut the fuck up!
text: Jack stops and Miles climbs into bed. Silence. Then --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You need to get your prostate checked.
speaker_heading: UNDER BLACK --
speaker_heading: MONDAY
scene_heading: EXT. BREAKFAST CAFE - DAY
dialog: Establishing.
scene_heading: INT. BREAKFAST CAFE - DAY
text: Miles and Jack are glancing at the menus. For some reason
text: Jack is humorless and grumpy.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: So what're we going to have? Pigs in
dialog: a blanket? The "rancher's special
dialog: breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease
dialog: and fat with a side of lard?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (not amused)
dialog: So what's the plan today?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: We head north, begin the grape tour
dialog: up there, make our way south so the
dialog: more we drink the closer we get to
dialog: the motel.
text: Jack sarcastically taps an index finger to his temple.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What's your problem?
text: Jack exhales and looks away, as though he doesn't want to
dialog: get into it.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What is it?
text: Jack sucks his teeth a moment searching for the right words.
text: Then the dam bursts.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I am going to get my nut on this
dialog: trip, Miles. And you are not going
dialog: to fuck it up for me with all your
dialog: depression and anxiety and neg-head
dialog: downer shit.
speaker_heading: MILES
text: Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do
dialog: not fuck with me. I am going to get
dialog: laid before I settle down on Saturday.
dialog: Do you read me?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Sure, big guy. Whatever you say.
dialog: It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in
dialog: the way and dragging you down. Maybe
dialog: you'd have a better time on your
dialog: own. You take the car. I'll catch
text: the train back.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, see, I want both of us to get
dialog: crazy. We should both be cutting
dialog: loose. I mean, this is our last
dialog: chance. This is our week! It should
dialog: be something we share.
text: The older WAITRESS comes over.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Can I take your order?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: But I am warning you.
speaker_heading: MILES
text: Oatmeal, one poached egg, and rye
dialog: toast. Dry.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Okay. And you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (glaring at Miles)
text: Pigs in a blanket. With extra syrup.
scene_heading: EXT. LOVELY HIGHWAY - DAY
text: The Saab winds along this beautiful road that meanders through
text: large open vineyards.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

text: A MAP and a MOVING LINE show the boys' route.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: INSERT --

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. VINEYARD - DAY
text: Framed by foreground grapevines, the Saab passes in the

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. FOXEN WINERY - DAY
text: Miles has just downed a taste of red wine.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: How much skin and stem contact?
speaker_heading: POURER
dialog: About four weeks.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Huh. That explains all the tannins.
dialog: And how long in oak?
speaker_heading: POURER
dialog: About a year.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: French or American?
speaker_heading: POURER
dialog: Both.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Good stuff.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, oak. That's a good wood.
text: Just as the pourer turns away toward other TASTERS, Jack
text: GRABS the bottle and helps himself and Miles to another glass.
text: They slam back their drinks like tequila.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LOVELY AREA ON A HILL - DAY
text: Miles brings the Saab to a stop, and the guys get out. Before
text: them lies an incredible view of endless vineyards.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Nice, huh?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Beautiful.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Victoria and I used to like this
dialog: view.
dialog: (lost in nostalgia)
dialog: Once we had a picnic here and drank
dialog: a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon
dialog: and artichokes, but we didn't care.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Miles.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: She has the best palate of any woman
dialog: I've ever known. She could even
dialog: differentiate Italian wines.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Miles, I gotta tell you something.
text: Victoria's coming to the wedding.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I know. You told me. I'm okay with
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, but that's not the whole story.
dialog: She got remarried.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: She what?
dialog: (long pause)
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: About a month ago. Six weeks.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: To that guy? That guy with the
dialog: restaurant...
text: Jack nods. Miles looks down at his shoes and draws a long
text: breath. Then he stiffly gets back in the open car and closes
text: the door.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Miles... MILES...
text: Miles continues to stare straight ahead.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I want to go home now.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You've been divorced for two years
dialog: already. People move on. She has!
dialog: It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes
dialog: you feel special or something.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Is she bringing him to the wedding?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You drop this bombshell on me. Why
dialog: didn't you tell me before?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Because I knew you'd freak out and
dialog: probably get so depressed you wouldn't
dialog: even come on this trip. But then I
dialog: figured here would be the best place
dialog: to tell you. We're here to forget
dialog: about all that shit. We're here to
dialog: party!
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (undeterred)
dialog: I'm going to be a fucking pariah.
dialog: Everyone's just going to be holding
dialog: their breath to see if I'm going to
dialog: get drunk and make a scene. Plus
dialog: Tony fucking Levin?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to
dialog: Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's
dialog: cool.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: You've all been talking about it?
dialog: Behind my back? Talking about it?
text: Miles turns and locates an open BOTTLE of wine in the back
text: seat. He uncorks it and begins to swig.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey, hey, hey. No, you don't!
text: Jack tries unsuccessfully to grab the bottle from Miles, but
text: Miles bolts out of the car.
scene_heading: A VERY WIDE SHOT --
text: Pursued by Jack, Miles dashes down the hill, all the while
text: taking huge swigs from the bottle.
speaker_heading: OMIT.
scene_heading: EXT. LOVELY VINEYARD - CONTINUOUS
text: Miles slows to walk between rows of GRAPEVINES. He polishes
text: off the bottle and tosses it. A painting Jack catches up
text: with him in the adjacent grapevine corridor.
text: Miles's face crumbles as though he were about to cry. Then
text: he collapses to the ground and closes his eyes tight.
text: Jack looks around impatiently for a moment. Then he squats
text: down so he can see Miles underneath the vines.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Miles?
text: Miles ignores Jack and focuses on the beautiful RIPE GRAPES
text: that surround him. They seem to distract him from his pain.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You going to be okay?
text: Miles looks up and shakes his head a definitive NO. Jack
text: can't help but LAUGH.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. KALYRA WINERY PARKING LOT - DAY
text: The sun hangs low as the Saab pulls into the parking lot,
text: Jack at the wheel.
scene_heading: INT. KALYRA TASTING ROOM - DAY
text: The pourer, a brunette in her early thirties, breaks away
text: from a BORING COUPLE down the bar. This is STEPHANIE.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Hey, guys. How's it going?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Excellent. My friend and I are up
dialog: here doing the wine tour, and he
dialog: tells me that you folks make one
dialog: hell of a Syrah.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: That's what people say.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (slurring slightly)
dialog: You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he
dialog: didn't know Pinot Noir from film
dialog: noir.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm a quick learner.
text: Stephanie laughs. She apparently likes big good-natured lunks
dialog: like Jack.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I'm trying to teach my friend here
dialog: some basics about wine over the next
dialog: few days before he goes off and --
text: WHOOMP! Under the bar Jack stomps on Miles's foot. Miles
text: winces.
text: Stephanie slides TWO GLASSES in front of them.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That's right -- I'm here to learn. I
dialog: never had that much interest in wine
dialog: before, but this trip has been very
dialog: enlightening. Always like wine, of
dialog: course, but I don't know. More of a
dialog: beer man, really. Microbreweries.
text: She THUMPS the cork off a bottle of Chardonnay.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Well, no better way to learn than
dialog: tasting.
text: She pours almost flirtatious amounts.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Now there's a girl who knows how to
dialog: pour. What's your name?
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Stephanie.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nice.
text: Jack swirls the wine as though he were by now a sommelier.
dialog: They look, they smell, they taste.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: So what do you think?
speaker_heading: MILES
text: Quaffable but far from transcendent.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I like it. Tastes great. Oaky.
text: Stephanie reaches for another bottle and pours. Jack's eyes
dialog: never leave her.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Cabernet Franc.
dialog: (as they taste)
dialog: This is only the fifth year we've
dialog: made this varietal. Very few wineries
dialog: around here do a straight Cabernet
dialog: Franc. It's from our vineyard up in
dialog: Santa Maria. And it was a Silver
dialog: Medal winner at Paso Robles last
dialog: year.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Well, I've come to never expect
dialog: greatness from a Cab Franc, and this
dialog: one's no exception. Sort of a flabby,
dialog: overripe --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (ignoring him)
dialog: Tastes good to me. You live around
dialog: here, Stephanie?
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: In Santa Ynez.
dialog: (low, to Miles)
dialog: And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton.
dialog: Windmill Inn.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Oh yeah.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You know a gal named Maya? Works at
dialog: the Hitching Post?
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Sure I know Maya. Real well.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No shit. We just had a drink with
text: her last night. Miles knows her.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Could we move on to the Syrah, please?
text: As she turns to reach for the right bottle, Jack winks at
text: Miles. Miles shakes his head.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: This is our Estate Syrah...
text: She pours each of them a full HALF GLASS.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: I know. I might need to be spanked.
text: She notices the boring couple, visibly annoyed that she has
dialog: been monopolized.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Excuse me.
text: As she wanders down the bar, Jack turns to Miles, his mouth
text: wide open.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: A bad girl, Miles. She might need to
dialog: be spanked.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Do you know how often these pourers
dialog: get hit on?
text: They glance down the bar at Stepanie. She smiles back.
scene_heading: EXT. KALYRA WINERY PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Miles is killing time by the car staring at his shoes. He
text: looks over and sees Jack waddling over from the tasting room
text: with TWO CASES OF WINE.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Get the trunk.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You have the keys.
text: Jack puts the cases down and glances back at the building.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We're on.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She called Maya, who's not working
dialog: tonight, so we're all going out.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: With Maya?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Been divorced for a year now, bud.
text: Jack puts the wine in the trunk, and they get in the car.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it
text: all going on.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Well, she is cute.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And
dialog: you almost tell her I'm getting
dialog: married. What's the matter with you?
dialog: (drumming on the
dialog: steering wheel)
dialog: Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
dialog: THE TV --
text: GOLF on ESPN.
scene_heading: MILES AND JACK
text: sit transfixed, each on his own bed. The curtains are drawn.
dialog: Then out of nowhere --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (mocking)
dialog: You know how often these pourers get
dialog: hit on?
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: I'm going for a swim. Get the blood
dialog: flowing. Want to come?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Nah. I want to watch this.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE TV --
text: A guy gets ready to putt. The announcer whispers what an
text: important moment this is. The guy misses.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: UNDER BLACK --
text: The sound of an AEROSOL CAN.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Miles. Hey, Miles. Time to get up.
text: WE OPEN OUR EYES TO SEE --
text: Jack spraying his feet with some Dr. Scholl's product.
speaker_heading: WIDE --
text: Miles pulls himself out of bed and slouches toward his
dialog: suitcase.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Fucking chick in the Jacuzzi --
dialog: goddamn, Miles, fucking going nuts
text: up here. Whole place is wide open.
dialog: Assylvania.
text: Jack does some actor's weird warm-up stretch.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: So what should I wear?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't know. Casual but nice. They
dialog: think you're a writer.
text: As Miles begins to dig through his suitcase, Jack flips open
text: his cellphone and speed-dials.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't you have any other shoes?
text: Miles glances as his shoes sitting sadly on the floor.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Hello? Oh hey, baby, just checking
dialog: in. Not much. We're about to go out
dialog: for dinner, probably be out pretty
dialog: late, so I thought I'd say goodnight
dialog: now. I know, I love you too. I miss
dialog: you.
scene_heading: EXT. LOS OLIVOS - NIGHT
text: The boys get out of the car and walk along a timbered sidewalk
text: in this tourist town with wine tasting rooms and gourmet
dialog: restaurants.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Please just try to be your normal
dialog: humorous self, okay? Like who you
dialog: were before the tailspin. Do you
dialog: remember that guy? People love that
dialog: guy. And don't forget -- your novel
text: is coming out in the fall.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it
dialog: called?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Do not sabotage me. If you want to
dialog: be a lightweight, that's your call.
dialog: But do not sabotage me.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Aye-aye, captain.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And if they want to drink Merlot,
dialog: we're drinking Merlot.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (dead serious)
dialog: If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving.
dialog: I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No
dialog: Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
text: Miles takes a SMALL BOTTLE from his pocket and rattles it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And don't drink too much. I don't
dialog: want you going to the dark side or
dialog: passing out. Do you hear me? No going
text: to the dark side.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Okay! Fuck!
text: Miles quickly POPS A XANAX. Jack gives him a final look in
dialog: the eye.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We're going in.
scene_heading: INT. LOS OLIVOS CAFE - NIGHT
text: The boys enter this cozy if crowded restaurant and exchange
text: words with the HOSTESS. Then they notice --
scene_heading: MAYA AND STEPHANIE
text: at a booth waving at them. They look great.
scene_heading: MILES AND JACK
text: make their way to the table, Jack wearing a broad, confident
speaker_heading: SMILE.
dialog: AT THE TABLE --
text: Jack plops down next to Stephanie, while Miles politely eases
text: in on Maya's side. Jack touches a hand to Stephanie's bare
text: neck and massages it meaningfully.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Good. How're you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Great. You look great.
dialog: (including Maya)
dialog: You both do.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Not so bad yourself.
text: Meanwhile Miles looks over at Maya and purses his lips in an
text: affable if uncomfortable smile. Then --
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What are you drinking?
speaker_heading: MAYA
text: A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Oh yeah? How is it?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: (sliding the glass)
dialog: Try it.
text: As Miles swirls the wine and takes a sip, he begins to relax.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Nice. Very nice.
speaker_heading: MAYA
text: Twelve months in oak.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: On a Sauvignon Blanc?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: I know the winemaker. She comes in
dialog: the restaurant all the time.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: This is good. Little hints of clove.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: I know. I love that.
speaker_heading: LATER --
text: A WAITER finishes listing off the specials.
speaker_heading: WAITER
text: ...medallions of pork with a dusting
text: of black truffles served with a root
dialog: vegetable foulon and wasabi-whipped
dialog: potatoes. And finally a Copper River
text: salmon grilled on an alder wood plank.
dialog: And that comes with roasted new
text: potatoes and steamed watercress.
text: The four diners exchange looks of delight.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: And who gets the wine list?
text: Miles raises his hand and takes the leather-bound book.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: I guess Miles wants it.
text: Jack glares at Miles, who immediately gets the hint.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Nope. You ladies choose.
text: Jack smiles and nods his approval. Jack takes the book out
text: of Miles's hands and offers it to the girls.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: You choose, Stephanie.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: (opening it)
dialog: So what does everyone feel like?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Whatever you girls want. It's on us
dialog: tonight. Sky's the limit.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: No, we're paying for the wine.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't think so. We're celebrating
dialog: Miles's book deal.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Well, in that case...
text: Miles draws a long breath.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: What's everyone ordering? Then we
dialog: can sort out the wine.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Exactement!
text: Jack shoots Miles a look.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: I'm having the salmon.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: That's what I'm having.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: (still scanning the
dialog: wines)
dialog: I'm thinking about the duck breast.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (slapping his menu
dialog: shut)
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Well, that narrows things down.
text: Stephanie lowers the menu so that only her eyes peer over
text: the top. She looks at the others, and they look back at her.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Sounds like... Pinot Noir to me.
text: Jack looks at Miles and raises one hand for a HIGH-FIVE.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Pinot!
text: Miles reluctantly slaps Jack's hand. This causes the girls
text: to laugh. MUSIC STARTS -- they're OFF!
dialog: DINNER is improvised, but includes:
text: -- The arrival of the FIRST WINE.
dialog: -- The SALADS.
text: -- Maya takes a turn with the wine list. Miles pushes her
text: finger down into the prices with THREE DIGITS.
text: -- New stemware is provided with the arrival of the SECOND
speaker_heading: WINE.
text: -- The four of them DRINK. Particularly Miles.
text: -- Stephanie and Jack get cozier and cozier.
text: -- The SALMON and DUCK arrive.
text: -- Miles is too shy to look into Maya's eyes. She's interested
dialog: and available -- it's too much for him.
text: -- As Miles gets DRUNKER, the camera angles become sloppier,
text: the cutting choppier.
text: -- Miles PONTIFICATES about some aspect of wine that Maya
text: and Stephanie find interesting. Left out in the cold, his
text: jaw tight, Jack wants to find a way in but can't.
text: -- Miles reaches over to refill his glass, but Jack's arm
text: shoots out to stop him -- "Slow down."
text: CLOSE ON MILES as a distant RUMBLE begins to sound, the rumble
text: of an oncoming ANXIETY ATTACK. By now he has drunk so much
text: that he spaces out, descending into --
scene_heading: INT. UNDERWORLD - DARK AND TIMELESS
text: Miles is boarding an OPEN BOAT atop this underground river,
text: the River Styx. Just beyond a ghoulish HUMAN CARGO the hooded
text: boatman CHARON wields a long staff. Miles is crossing over
text: to the dark side.
scene_heading: INT. LOS OLIVOS CAFE - BACK AGAIN
text: Miles returns to earth to find Jack and Stephanie now in
text: their own little world -- Jack explaining something to
text: Stephanie that she finds fascinating, just FASCINATING.
text: -- Miles converses with Maya, but it's clear from her bemused
text: expression that he's being charming if not entirely coherent.
text: -- ANOTHER WINE reaches the table -- a Comte Armand Pornrnard.
text: -- Miles looks over at Jack and Stephanie. They share a short
text: but sensual kiss.
scene_heading: MOMENTS LATER --
text: Miles is on his feet threading his way through the tables.
dialog: He is very unsteady, and we cut between first and third person
dialog: perspectives.
text: AT THE BATHROOMS --
text: He tries the MEN'S ROOM door but it's locked. He pulls the
text: XANAX out his pocket and pops one in his mouth, swallowing
dialog: it dry.
text: He notices a PAYPHONE nearby. Thinking better of it for a
text: moment, Miles makes a drunken bee-line for the receiver.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE KEYPAD --
text: as many numbers are dialed, and we HEAR the TONES, completely
text: out of sync, along with a sound melange of interior phone
text: RINGING and a PICKUP.
scene_heading: THE RECEIVER --
text: As Miles presses it desperately to his head.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Victoria.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Miles?
text: Miles feigns an implausible upbeat tone.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Victoria! How the hell are you?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Fine. What's, uh, what's on your
dialog: mind?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Heard you got remarried!
dialog: Congratulations. Didn't think you
dialog: had the stomach for another go-round.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Just some local Pinot, you know,
dialog: then a little Burgundy. That old
dialog: Cotes de Beaune!
text: Miles laughs at his own non-existent joke.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: A little place in Los Olivos. New
text: owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent
dialog: food too -- you should try it. Thought
dialog: of you at the Hitching Post last
dialog: night.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: MILES (CONT' D)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Miles, don't call me when you're
dialog: drunk.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I just wanted you to know I've decided
dialog: not to go to the wedding, so in case
dialog: you were dreading some uncomfortable,
dialog: you know, run-in or something, well,
dialog: worry no more. You won't see me there.
dialog: My wedding gift to you and what's-
dialog: his-name. What is his name?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: (silence, then --)
dialog: Ken.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Ken.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Miles, I don't care if you come to
dialog: the wedding or not.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you
dialog: guys have fun.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (rushing to keep her
dialog: on)
dialog: You see, Vicki, I just heard about
dialog: this today, you getting married that
dialog: is, and I was kind of taken aback.
dialog: Kind of hard to believe.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I guess I just thought there was
dialog: still some hope for us somewhere
dialog: down the road and I just, I just --
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Miles, maybe it is better if you
dialog: don't come to the wedding.
text: Miles sucks something from between his two front teeth.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Whatever you say, Vicki. You're the
dialog: boss.
text: He HANGS UP as nonchalantly as if it had been a sales call
text: and heads back to the table.
scene_heading: EXT. DEEP CANYON - DAY
text: For a flash, Miles is walking an unstable, narrow ROPE BRIDGE
text: extending vertiginously across a great CHASM.
scene_heading: INT. LOS OLIVOS CAFE - BACK AGAIN
text: Miles reaches the table, tries to sit and SLIPS ONTO THE
speaker_heading: FLOOR.
text: Although at first Jack blinks heavily in disgust, the girls
text: burst into hysterical LAUGHTER. Jack then laughs too, perhaps
scene_heading: OVER-LAUGHING.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Easy, boy. Easy.
text: Maya helps him back into the booth.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Are you all right?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Fine. Just slipped.
dialog: (picking up his glass)
dialog: This is my blood.
text: Miles drinks. Stephanie makes a head gesture to Maya, who
text: nods in return.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: (to the guys)
dialog: Excuse us.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Sorry to make you get up again, Miles.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: That's okay.
text: Miles and Jack allow the girls to pass. Then --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What the fuck, man? What is up?
text: Miles reaches for his wine glass, but Jack moves it away.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Pull yourself together, man.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I'm fine!
text: But in throwing open his arms for emphasis, he spills a WATER
text: GLASS. Jack rights it and throws a napkin on the tablecloth.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Where were you?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Bathroom.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Did you drink and dial?
text: Miles's silence confirms his guilt and shame.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why do you always do this? Victoria's
dialog: gone, man. Gone. Poof.
text: Miles looks down and squeezes his eyes tight while pushing
text: out an exhale through his nose.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Stop it. You are blowing a great
dialog: opportunity here, Miles. Fucking
dialog: Maya, man. She's great. She's cool.
dialog: She's funny. She knows wine. What is
dialog: this morose come-down bullshit? These
dialog: girls want to party. And what was
dialog: that fucking ten-minute lecture on,
dialog: what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come
dialog: on!
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Let's just say I'm uncomfortable
dialog: with the whole scenario.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh Jesus, Miles.
text: Miles belligerently reaches for his Comte Armand. Jack lets
dialog: it pass.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And don't forget all the bad times
dialog: you had with Victoria. How small she
dialog: make you feel. That's why you had
text: the affair in the first place.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Shut up. Shut your face.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't you see how Maya's looking at
dialog: you? You got her on the hook. Reel
dialog: her in! Come on, let's rachet this
dialog: up a notch. You know how to to do
dialog: it. Here.
dialog: (passing a glass)
dialog: Drink some agua.
text: Miles looks at the water, takes it and drains it.
text: The girls now return to the table. The guys slide over.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (trying to appear
dialog: sober)
dialog: Should we get dessert?
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: We were thinking. Why don't we go
dialog: back to my place? I've got wine,
dialog: some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
text: Jack raises both arms like a football referee.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Excellent idea. Waiter!
scene_heading: INT. SAAB - NIGHT
scene_heading: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD --
text: Trees and bushes lit by the headlights show us we're headed
text: into the woods.
speaker_heading: INSIDE --
text: Jack drives. Miles blinks heavily as he tries to make a sense
text: of A HAND-DRAWN MAP.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (grabbing the map)
dialog: Let me see that.
scene_heading: EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The Saab pulls into a gravel DRIVEWAY and comes to a stop
text: outside this wood-framed cottage.
text: Jack and Miles get out and head for the front door. On the
text: way, Jack reaches into his coat pocket and produces a string
text: of FOUR CONDOMS.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (tearing)
dialog: Here. One for you, three for me.
text: Miles wordlessly takes his. Just before they climb the porch
dialog: steps --
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You sure you want to do this?
text: Jack stops and looks at him for a moment with almost hostile
text: incredulity.
text: THE FRONT DOOR is open. Jack knocks twice on the SCREEN DOOR
text: before going in.
scene_heading: INT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The boys enter this modest living room furnished with
text: weathered but charming old furniture. Scattered here and
text: there are CHILDREN'S TOYS. FINGER-PAINTINGS are taped to the
text: walls. CANDLES are lit, and MUSIC is playing.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We're here!
text: Stephanie sails in.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: What happened to you guys?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Couple of wrong turns.
text: (pointing a thumb at
dialog: Miles)
dialog: Thanks to Magellan, here.
text: After a brief hug, Stephanie and Jack peck-kiss.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Hi.
dialog: (to Miles)
text: Maya's in the kitchen.
text: Miles hesitates a moment before Jack elbows him toward --
scene_heading: EXT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Miles wanders in to find Maya squatting in front of a little
text: temperature-controlled WINE STORAGE UNIT.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: She got anything good?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots
dialog: and Syrahs.
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Hey, Steph? You sure we can open
dialog: anything? Anything we want?
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE (V.O.)
dialog: Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I
dialog: have completely underestimated
dialog: Stephanie.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Who do you think you're dealing with
dialog: here?
text: Maya slips out a bottle of ESCHEVAUX.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: How about this?
text: Miles nods vigorously. Maya looks back and forth between
text: Miles and the wine, her eyes narrowed. Then she slides it
dialog: back in.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Nope. I don't think we know each
dialog: other well enough.
dialog: (picking out another
dialog: bottle)
dialog: I'd say this guy's more our speed.
text: They rise, and Miles glances at the ANDREW MURRAY SYRAH and,
text: raising his eyebrows, agrees. Maya begins opening it.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: So what gems do you have in your
dialog: collection?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Not much of a collection really. I
dialog: haven't had the wallet for that, so
dialog: I sort of live bottle to bottle. But
dialog: I've got a couple things I'm saving.
dialog: I guess the star would be a 1961
dialog: Cheval Blanc.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's
dialog: just sitting there? Go get it.
dialog: (pushing him, playfully
dialog: stern)
dialog: Right now. Hurry up...
text: Miles laughs, fights back a bit.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Seriously, the '61s are peaking,
dialog: aren't they? At least that's what
dialog: I've read.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yeah, I know.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: It might be too late already. What
dialog: are you waiting for?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I don't know. Special occasion. With
dialog: the right person. It was supposed to
dialog: be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
text: Understanding, Maya considers her response.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc,
dialog: that's the special occasion.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: How long have you been into wine?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: I started to get serious about seven
dialog: years ago.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What was the bottle that did it?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
text: Miles whistles and raises his eyebrows. Maya pours, and they
text: clink their glasses together before savoring the wine.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but
dialog: this is tasty. Really good. How about
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: (tastes again)
dialog: I think they overdid it a bit. Too
text: much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (tasting again,
dialog: impressed)
dialog: Yeah, I'd say you're right on the
dialog: money.
text: Then Miles absently scans the REFRIGERATOR DOOR and spots a
text: PHOTO of Stephanie holding a LITTLE GIRL.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is
dialog: cute.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Is she sleeping or...?
speaker_heading: MAYA
text: She's with her grandmother. She's
text: with Steph's mom. She spends a lot
dialog: of time over there. Steph's... well,
dialog: she's Stephanie.
text: Jack's voice-over voice from the other room...
speaker_heading: JACK (O.S.)
dialog: "And now for a low, low 4.8% APR..."
text: ...is followed by PEALS OF LAUGHTER.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: You got kids?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up.
dialog: That was the one unpolluted part of
dialog: my divorce -- no kids.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Yeah, same here.
text: Maya nods as she sips again, looking distant for a moment,
text: thinking about something else.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Let's go in there.
text: Maya takes the bottle, and they wander into --
scene_heading: INT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Jack and Stephanie are gone. From a distant bedroom comes
text: more laughter.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Looks like our friends are hitting
dialog: it off.
text: While Maya goes to turn down the STEREO, Miles sits on the
text: couch. Maya's shirt rides up as she crouches, giving Miles a
text: glimpse of the small of HER BACK.
text: She takes a seat opposite Miles on the couch. They look at
dialog: each other without speaking. Just what is the vibe here?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: It's kind of weird sitting here with
dialog: you in Stephanie's house. All those
dialog: times you came into the restaurant.
dialog: It's like you're a real person now.
dialog: Almost.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird.
text: Out of context.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Yeah, weird. But great.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yeah. Definitely.
text: An awkward silence, broken by Maya.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: So what's your novel about?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Well, it's a little difficult to
text: summarize. It begins as a first-person
dialog: account of a guy taking care of his
dialog: father after a stroke. Kind of based
dialog: on personal experience, but only
dialog: loosely.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: What's the title?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: "The Day After Yesterday."
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Oh. You mean... today?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Um... yeah but it's more...
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: So is it kind of about death and
dialog: mortality, or...?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It
dialog: shifts around a lot. Like you also
dialog: start to see everything from the
dialog: point of view of the father. And
dialog: some other stuff happens, some
text: parallel narrative, and then it
text: evolves -- or devolves -- into a
dialog: kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery --
dialog: you know, with no real resolution.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing
dialog: you're getting it published. Really.
dialog: I know how hard it is. Just to write
dialog: it even.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (squeezing it out)
dialog: Yeah. Thanks.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Like me, I have this stupid paper
dialog: due on Friday, and as usual I'm
dialog: freaked out about it. Just like in
dialog: high school. It never changes.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: A paper?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Yeah. I'm working on a masters in
text: horticulture. Chipping away at it.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know
dialog: there was a college here.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a
dialog: week.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: So... you want to work for a winery
dialog: or something someday?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I do have a copy of the manuscript
text: in the car. It's not fully proofed,
dialog: but if you're okay with a few typos...
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of
dialog: typos.
dialog: (sipping the wine)
dialog: Wow, this is really starting to open
dialog: up. What do you think?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: My palate's kind of shot, but from
dialog: what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty
dialog: damn good.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Can I ask you a personal question?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (bracing himself)
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Why are you so into Pinot? It's like
dialog: a thing with you.
text: Miles laughs at first, then smiles wistfully at the question.
text: He searches for the answer in his glass and begins slowly.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I don't know. It's a hard grape to
dialog: grow. As you know. It's thin-skinned,
text: temperamental, ripens early. It's
dialog: not a survivor like Cabernet that
dialog: can grow anywhere and thrive even
dialog: when neglected. Pinot needs constant
dialog: care and attention and in fact can
dialog: only grow in specific little tucked-
dialog: away corners of the world. And only
dialog: the most patient and nurturing growers
dialog: can do it really, can tap into Pinot's
dialog: most fragile, delicate qualities.
dialog: Only when someone has taken the time
dialog: to truly understand its potential
dialog: can Pinot be coaxed into its fullest
dialog: expression. And when that happens,
dialog: its flavors are the most haunting
text: and brilliant and subtle and thrilling
dialog: and ancient on the planet.
text: Maya has found this answer revealing and moving.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I mean, Cabernets can be powerful
text: and exalting, but they seem prosaic
dialog: to me for some reason. By comparison.
dialog: How about you?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: What about me?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I don't know. Why are you into wine?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: I suppose I got really into wine
dialog: originally through my ex-husband. He
dialog: had a big, kind of show-off cellar.
dialog: But then I found out that I have a
dialog: really sharp palate, and the more I
dialog: drank, the more I liked what it made
dialog: me think about.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yeah? Like what?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Like what a fraud he was.
text: Miles laughs.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: No, but I do like to think about the
dialog: life of wine, how it's a living thing.
dialog: I like to think about what was going
dialog: on the year the grapes were growing,
dialog: how the sun was shining that summer
dialog: or if it rained... what the weather
dialog: was like. I think about all those
dialog: people who tended and picked the
dialog: grapes, and if it's an old wine, how
dialog: many of them must be dead by now. I
dialog: love how wine continues to evolve,
dialog: how every time I open a bottle it's
dialog: going to taste different than if I
dialog: had opened it on any other day.
dialog: Because a bottle of wine is actually
dialog: alive -- it's constantly evolving
dialog: and gaining complexity. That is,
dialog: until it peaks -- like your '61 --
text: and begins its steady, inevitable
dialog: decline. And it tastes so fucking
dialog: good.
text: Now it is Miles's turn to be swept away. Maya's face tells
text: us the moment is right, but Miles remains frozen. He needs
text: another sign, and Maya is bold enough to offer it: reaches
text: out and places one hand atop his.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Bathroom over there?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Yeah.
text: Miles gets up and walks out. Maya sighs and gets and American
text: Spirit out of her purse.
scene_heading: INT. STEPHANIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: The bathroom's a MESS -- the shower curtain is filthy, and
text: the chipped and water-stained tub is filled with CHILDREN'S
text: BATH TOYS.
text: Miles is bent over the sink splashing water on his face,
text: trying to sober up and gather his courage. He stands, and
text: without drying his face, presses his palms against his cheeks.
text: Then he takes a deep breath and drops his hands.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You are such a loser. Come on!
scene_heading: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Miles comes out of the bathroom and looks for Maya, but she's
dialog: not there.
text: Then he hears a noise from the kitchen, so he goes through
dialog: the door into --
scene_heading: INT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Maya is at the sink, filling a glass with water.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: I was just getting some water. You
dialog: want some water?
text: Miles goes to stand by her and accepts a glass of water.
text: Just as she's about to fill a second glass, he stops her and
text: looks her in the eye, trying to recapture a moment that is
text: long gone.
text: He kisses her and she kisses back, but the whole thing feels
text: strained and awkward.
text: After a few seconds, Maya breaks away.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Nice.
text: But instead of resuming the kiss, she steps past him, heading
text: back into the living room.
speaker_heading: MAYA (O.S.)
dialog: I should probably get going.
text: Miles realizes he's blown it and silently berates himself.
scene_heading: INT. SAAB - NIGHT
text: Miles drives down the hill behind Maya's car, which leads
text: him through this very rural road.
scene_heading: EXT. WHERE THE ROAD MEETS THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: Maya's car comes to a stop just ahead of the Saab. She puts
text: it in PARK and gets out.
dialog: AT THE SAAB --
text: Miles rolls down his window as Maya leans over.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: You know how to get back to the
dialog: Windmill, right?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Got it.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: I had a good time tonight, Miles. I
dialog: really did.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Good. So did I.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Okay. See you around.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Um... did you still want to read my
dialog: novel?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
text: Miles turns to the backseat, locates a large MANUSCRIPT BOX,
text: and hands it to Maya.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Wow. Great.
text: He turns around again, produces a SECOND BOX, and hands it
text: over as well.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Hope you like it. Feel free to stop
dialog: reading at any time. I'll take no
dialog: offense.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Goodnight, Miles.
text: She gives him a friendly peck on the cheek.
text: After she gets back in her car, she heads in one direction
text: while Miles heads in the opposite.
speaker_heading: OMIT.
speaker_heading: UNDER BLACK --
speaker_heading: TUESDAY
text: Jack's cellphone RINGS.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING
scene_heading: NOW EARLY MORNING --
text: Still fully clothed, Miles staggers across the room.
text: Fishing the phone out of Jack's windbreaker pocket, he looks
text: at the CALLER ID: "Erganian, Christine" and the number. He
dialog: briefly considers his options -- answer it? shut it off? --
text: before placing it atop Jack's suitcase.
text: The moment he lies back down on the bed, the MOTEL PHONE
text: RINGS. An old DIGITAL CLOCK next to it reads 7:l0.
text: As Miles closes his eyes and pulls the pillow over his aching
dialog: head, we again --
text: FADE TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: LATER --
text: VROOM! Outside a roaring MOTORCYCLE comes to a stop. Then
text: over the sound of an IDLING ENGINE come familiar if indistinct
text: VOICES and LAUGHTER.
text: Miles opens his bleary eyes and listens.
text: FOOTSTEPS pound on the balcony outside, and Jack lets himself
text: in, flushed and exuberant.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Fucking chick is unbelievable. Un-be-
dialog: lieve-able!
text: He pounds on the wall, then goes into the bathroom and without
text: closing the door unzips his pants to PEE.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty
dialog: nasty nasty.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Well, I'm glad you got it out of
dialog: your system. Congratulations. Mission
dialog: accomplished.
text: A hungover Miles gets up and looks out the door Jack has
text: left open. Down in the parking lot he sees --
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
text: atop a mid-sized MOTORCYCLE, wearing a weathered fringed
text: suede jacket. She gives him a big friendly wave.
speaker_heading: MILES
text: returns the wave and goes back inside.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You didn't invite Stephanie to come
dialog: with us, did you?
text: With a FLUSH Jack emerges from the bathroom and opens his
dialog: bag.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's
dialog: off today, so she and I are going on
dialog: a hike.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: We were supposed to play golf.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're
dialog: brand new -- gift from Christine's
dialog: dad.
dialog: (slapping some cash
dialog: on the dresser)
dialog: It's on me. Oh, say, by the way,
dialog: Stephanie and me were thinking we'd
dialog: all go to the Hitching Post tonight
text: and sit at one of Maya's tables, and
dialog: she'll bring us some great wines and
dialog: then we can all --
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (sitting down)
dialog: Count me out.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last
dialog: night, huh? That's a shocker. You
dialog: mean getting drunk and calling
dialog: Victoria didn't put you in the mood?
dialog: You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's
dialog: getting real old real fast, dude.
text: Miles looks down. Jack heads for the door.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Later.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yeah, well, maybe you should check
dialog: your messages first.
text: Jack stops, eyeing Miles suspiciously. Miles tosses Jack his
text: phone. Jack flips it open and scrolls down with his thumb.
text: He doesn't like what he sees.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, boy.
speaker_heading: MILES
text: (pointing at the room
dialog: phone)
dialog: She's been leaving messages here
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah. Okay.
text: He SNAPS the phone shut and puts it back.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You should call her.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I will.
dialog: (heading out the door)
dialog: See ya!
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Right now.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay! Jesus!
text: Jack picks up his phone, sits on the bed and looks defiantly
dialog: at Miles.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I've got no problem calling her.
text: Now Jack closes his eyes and brings the heel of his hand to
text: his forehead as he begins to concoct the BIG LIE.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (opening his phone)
dialog: Wait outside, will you?
scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY
text: Miles wanders out and looks down at Stephanie.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: That was fun last night.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a
dialog: wine collection. Very impressive.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this
dialog: morning. She said she had a good
dialog: time too. You should call her.
text: Miles says nothing.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Where's Jack?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: He had to make a phone call.
text: Stephanie cuts her bike's engine and climbs off, propping it
text: up on the kickstand.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: So what are you up to today, Miles?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't
dialog: know. Jack and I were supposed to go
dialog: golfing.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yeah, I reserved the tee time about
dialog: a month ago.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Oops. Sorry.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You golf?
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid
dialog: game. I mean, at least, I could never
dialog: get into it. I tried it once.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about
dialog: it.
text: Just then Jack cracks open the motel room door.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: Hey Miles. Miles.
text: Miles ducks back inside.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Do you have that other condom?
text: Miles reaches into his wallet and hands over the little foil
dialog: square.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What'd Christine say?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Lucked out -- got voice mail.
dialog: Everything's cool.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL INN - CONTINUOUS
text: Jack bounds out of the room and down the stairs like a child
dialog: on Christmas morning.
text: Miles watches Jack climb on the bike behind Stephanie,
text: grasping her waist.
text: Stephanie and Jack PEEL OUT, leaving Miles alone on the
dialog: balcony.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON MILES --
text: As we begin to hear a SNIPPING sound which carries us to --
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL ROOM BALCONY - DAY
text: Miles sits outside carefully trimming his toenails. SNIP,
text: SNIP, SNIP. MUSIC BEGINS for this mournful montage of
dialog: solitude.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL LOBBY - DAY
text: Miles takes a styrofoam cup and helps himself to a cup of
text: complimentary COFFEE from a PUMP THERMOS.
text: Then he takes a look at the rack of pamphlets of local TOURIST
text: ATTRACTIONS -- a water park, a mystery cave, and of course
dialog: winery after winery.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL INN JACUZZI - DAY
text: Amid turbulent water, Miles corrects his students' papers.
text: He is alone in the tub, but at the nearby pool STOCKY KIDS
text: play noisily with SUPER-SOAKERS.
scene_heading: OVER MILES'S SHOULDER --
text: The PAPER he's reading is marked up with circled spelling
text: errors, and one entire paragraph has been crossed out. Finding
text: a new error, Miles writes "NO!!!"
text: CAMERA PANS to reveal a STACK of papers already heavily marked
text: with corrections, some of them mottled with water stains.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: Miles FLOSSES, his lips pulled back into a grotesque moue.
text: Then he brushes with a SONIC-CARE TOOTHBRUSH.
speaker_heading: LATER --
text: Miles checks his machine.
speaker_heading: SYNTHESIZED VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: No new messages.
text: He hangs up, disgusted.
scene_heading: EXT. CHINA PANDA RESTAURANT - DAY
text: A small Buellton eatery.
scene_heading: INT. CHINA PANDA - DAY
text: The only customer right now, Miles eats awkwardly with his
text: chopsticks.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVING RANGE - DAY
text: Miles DRIVES ball after ball, unsuccessfully trying to release
dialog: his frustration.
scene_heading: EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY
text: The Saab roars past us, perhaps going a little too fast.
scene_heading: INT. SAAB - CONTINUOUS
text: Whistling absently as he drives, Miles leans over to turn
text: the radio on and fiddle around to find a good station. Then
dialog: all of a sudden --
text: WHUMP! The car has struck something with a hideous sound
text: followed immediately by the receding "ARF-ARF-ARF-ARF" of an
text: injured DOG in the Saab's wake. Miles applies the BRAKES.
scene_heading: EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY
text: Miles gets out of his car just in time to see --
speaker_heading: A DOG
text: scampering into the nearby woods. Miles looks around -- has
dialog: anyone seen him? Is there a nearby residence? Finding nothing,
text: Miles momentarily weighs his options before finally GIVING
speaker_heading: CHASE.
text: He follows the path of the dog into --
scene_heading: EXT. ROADSIDE WOODS - CONTINUOUS
text: Still hearing occasional distant barking, Miles finds his
text: way among the trees and bushes, looking in vain for the ill-
dialog: fated cur.
text: After a frenetic search, Miles reluctantly gives up and heads
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: OMIT.
scene_heading: EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY
text: Miles has returned to where he hit the dog. Just then, Miles
text: notices TWO MEXICAN CHILDREN watching him from just down the
text: road. They disappear into the bushes.
text: Looking like a criminal, Miles trots back to the Saab climbs
text: behind the wheel and speeds away.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY
text: The Saab pulls into the parking lot.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: Miles trudges up the stops to the room. He opens the door
dialog: and sees --
speaker_heading: JACK
text: atop Stephanie, plowing her fertile fields. Despite the
text: interruption, their pace does not alter.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Not now! Not now!
text: Miles quickly shuts the door.
scene_heading: INT. WINDMILL SPORTS BAR LOUNGE - DAY
text: Miles pours himself another glass of Pinot. Jack comes in
text: and spots his morose friend.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey, there you are.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What're you drinking?
text: Jack reaches over to check out the bottle's label. Miles
text: remains cool to Jack's amiability.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Any good?
text: Miles shrugs.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to the bartender)
dialog: Could I get a glass please?
dialog: (to Miles)
dialog: Stephanie took me out into the Pinot
dialog: fields today. It was awesome. I think
dialog: I finally got a handle on the whole
dialog: process, from the soil to the vine
dialog: to the -- what do you call it? --
dialog: selection and harvest. And the whole,
dialog: you know, big containers where they
dialog: mix it. We even ate Pinot grapes
text: right off the vine.
dialog: (the new expert)
text: Still a little sour but already
dialog: showing potential for great structure.
dialog: Stephanie really knows her shit,
dialog: Miles.
text: Jack now has his glass and pours himself some wine.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Where is Stephanie?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What the fuck are you doing?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: With this chick.
text: Jack just looks at him.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Does she know about Saturday?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Um... not exactly. But I've been
dialog: honest. I haven't told her I'm
dialog: available. And she knows this trip
dialog: up here is only for a few days.
dialog: Besides...
text: Jack stops short in a rare instance of self-censorship.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Besides what?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well... I don't know, just... the
dialog: wedding.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, I've been doing some thinking.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Oh, you've been thinking. And?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I may have to put the wedding on
dialog: hold is all.
text: Miles looks at him with incredulity.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I fully realize that making a change
dialog: like that might be tricky for certain
dialog: people to accept at first, but life
dialog: is short, Miles. I've got to be sure
dialog: I'm doing the right thing before
dialog: taking such a big step. And not just
dialog: for my sake. I'm thinking about
dialog: Christine's feelings too. I take
dialog: marriage very seriously -- always
dialog: have. That's why I've never done it
dialog: before. The day I get married, it's
dialog: going to be the real thing.
text: Miles just looks at his friend, waiting for more.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Being with Stephanie has opened my
dialog: eyes. She's not uptight or
dialog: controlling. She's just cool. Things
dialog: are so easy with her. Smells
dialog: different. Tastes different. Fucks
dialog: different. Fucks like an animal. I'm
dialog: telling you, I went deep last night,
text: Miles. Deep.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Deep.
text: Miles draws a long sigh.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't get all judgmental on me. This
dialog: is my deal. It's my life, and it's
dialog: my call.
text: They fall silent for a moment. Then --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I was hoping to get some understanding
dialog: from you. And I'm not getting it.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Understanding of what?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Like I might be in love with another
dialog: woman.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: In love? Twenty-four hours with some
dialog: wine-pourer chick and you think you're
dialog: in love? And give up everything?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Look who's talking. You've been there.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yes I have, and do I look like a
dialog: happy man? Was all that drama with
dialog: Brenda a happy thing for me to do?
dialog: Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my
dialog: life now?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: This is totally different. I'm talking
dialog: about avoiding what you're talking
dialog: about. That's the distinction. I
dialog: have not made the commitment yet. I
dialog: am not married. I have not said the
dialog: words. In a few days, I might get
dialog: married, and if I do, then I won't
dialog: be doing stuff like this anymore.
dialog: Otherwise, what's the whole point of
dialog: getting married?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: And what about Stephanie? She's a
text: woman -- with a kid. A single mom.
dialog: What do you think she's looking for?
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Here's what I'm thinking. We move up
dialog: here, you and me, buy a vineyard.
dialog: You design your own wine; I'll handle
dialog: the business side. Then you get
dialog: inspired and write a new novel. As
dialog: for me, if an audition comes along,
dialog: hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What do you care anyway? You don't
dialog: even like Christine.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What? Of course I like Christine.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You said she was shallow. Yeah, and
dialog: a nouveau riche.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: That was three years ago after that
dialog: first party!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an
dialog: actor. All I have is my instinct.
dialog: (his hand on his chest)
dialog: My intuition -- that's all I have.
dialog: And you're asking me to go against
dialog: it. And that's just wrong.
text: Just then Stephanie walks in. She cozies up to Jack, and he
text: kisses the top of her head.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Hi, guys. We should probably get
dialog: going.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Where?
scene_heading: INT. BOWLING ALLEY - DUSK
scene_heading: CLOSE ON A VIDEO GAME MONITOR
text: as a crazy car races through the obstacle-ridden track, often
text: leaving the road, much like Jack's libido.
speaker_heading: ZOOM OUT
text: to reveal six-year-old SIENA seated in Jack's lap as they
text: drive together. A delighted Siena laughs and giggles.
text: Miles sits nearby with Stephanie and her fifty-something,
text: two-pack-a-day MOTHER CARYL.
speaker_heading: CARYL
dialog: Stephanie's heard this a thousand
dialog: times, but if I'd done what I wanted
dialog: and I'd bought up in Santa Maria
dialog: when I had the chance, I would have
dialog: made a fortune when they put in that
dialog: outlet center and that Home Depot.
dialog: (a drag off her
dialog: cigarette, then to
dialog: Stephanie)
dialog: Your father knew it too, but he was
dialog: a fucking chickenshit. Always was.
text: Caryl looks over her shoulder, her gaze drawn to Jack and
text: Siena, so completely happy together.
text: Caryl exhales a puff of smoke as she watches. Stephanie is
text: equally enthralled. Miles takes it all in, trying his best
text: not to shake his head in disgust.
scene_heading: INT. BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT - DUSK
text: Caryl is behind the wheel of her OLDSMOBILE as Stephanie
text: gets Siena buckled up in the backseat. Jack pulls Miles aside.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph
dialog: and Siena get home safe, and then
dialog: maybe we'll hook up with you later,
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (dispirited)
dialog: Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a
dialog: movie.
text: Stephanie kisses Miles's cheek before getting in the car
text: next to her mom.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: See you, Miles. You take care.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
scene_heading: SIENA AND CARYL
dialog: Bye, Miles.
text: As he gets in the car --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Call me on my cell if you go out.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yeah.
text: Miles watches them drive away, then heads toward his Saab.
scene_heading: INT. MINI-MART - DUSK
scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE COUNTER --
text: as Miles places a box of security ENVELOPES, a packet of
text: BEEF JERKY and some TROPICAL FRUIT SKITTLES.
speaker_heading: WIDE --
text: Miles points over the CASHIER'S SHOULDER.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: And could I get a Barely Leqal?
text: As the cashier reaches for the magazine --
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: NO, um, the new one.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Miles is once again FLOSSING.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: POP! Miles opens a bottle of Pinot and pours himself a glass.
text: He carries it to bed, takes a nice big slug, lies down on
text: the bed and opens his magazine.
scene_heading: NOW SNEEZING ATOP THE BED -- ANGLE ON TOP OF HIM --
text: The Barely Legal face down on his chest, Miles awakens with
text: a start and looks at the clock-radio. He thinks a moment,
text: takes a deep breath, and bounds off the bed.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON A WATER-SAVER SHOWER HEAD --
text: as little needles of water come at us.
scene_heading: THROUGH THE BATHROOM DOOR --
text: Miles takes a nice hot SHOWER. But wait -- he has forgotten
text: to put the shower curtain inside the tub. A closer look
text: reveals a growing PUDDLE OF WATER on the floor.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HITCHING POST - NIGHT
text: Miles walks across the parking lot. He pauses before entering,
text: then forces himself to take the leap.
scene_heading: INT. THE HITCHING POST - NIGHT
text: Miles affects nonchalance as he searches briefly for Maya.
text: He continues on into the BAR.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: How's it hanging, Miles?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You know me. I love it up here. How
dialog: about you?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a
text: busload of retired folks in on a
dialog: wine tour. Usually they're not too
dialog: rowdy, but tonight there was something
text: going on. Full moon or something.
dialog: What can I get you?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Highliner.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Glass or bottle?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (considers, then --)
dialog: Bottle.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: You got it.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Say, is Maya working?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Maya? Haven't seen her. I think she's
dialog: off tonight. Say, where's your buddy?
text: Miles just smiles.
speaker_heading: WIDE --
text: Gary serves Miles, alone at the bar. Miles takes his first
dialog: drink.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Oh, that's tasty.
scene_heading: EXT. HITCHING POST - NIGHT
text: It's closing time. The front door flies open, and Miles
text: staggers out sideways. Gary follows him out, concerned.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: You okay, Miles?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I'm good.
text: Miles heads in the wrong direction at first, then realizes
text: his mistake and steers himself back toward the Windmill.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: UNDER BLACK, A CARD --
speaker_heading: WEDNESDAY
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: The door bursts open, and Jack comes bounding in.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Come on, dude. Let's go golfing! I
dialog: got us in at Alisal.
text: Miles comes to, very hungover.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: That's a public course.
dialog: (then --)
dialog: No Stephanie?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She's working. I need a break anyway.
text: She's getting a little clingy.
dialog: (magnanimous)
dialog: This is our day!
scene_heading: EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY
text: WHACK! Jack TEES OFF with a manly athletic swing and shades
text: his eyes to watch the ball's trajectory.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Crap.
text: Miles, disheveled and sullen, approaches the teebox, sticks
text: a tee in the ground and sets his ball.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Did you ever got ahold of Maya
dialog: yesterday?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She likes you, man. Stephanie'll
dialog: tell you.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (preparing to swing)
dialog: Can you give me some room here?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (stepping back)
dialog: Oh yeah. Sure.
text: Miles lifts his club.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You know, in life you gotta strike
dialog: when the iron's hot.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Thanks, Jack.
text: Miles refocuses and SWINGS just as Jack offers more helpful
dialog: advice.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't whiff it.
text: WHACK! Despite the distraction, Miles manages to make a good,
dialog: long drive.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nice shot.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You're an asshole.
scene_heading: NOW ON THE FAIRWAY --
text: Jack is pouring two Dixie cups of wine as Miles prepares to
dialog: take his next swing.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What about your agent? Hear anything
dialog: yet?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What do you think's going on?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Could be anything.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Been checking your messages?
speaker_heading: MILES
text: Obsessively.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: They probably think my book is such
dialog: a piece of shit that it's not even
dialog: worthy of a response. I guess I'll
dialog: just have to learn how to kiss off
dialog: three years of my life.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: But you don't know yet, so your
dialog: negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't
dialog: you say?
text: Miles says nothing.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Or fuck those New York publishers.
dialog: Publish it yourself. I'll chip in.
dialog: Just get it out there, get it
dialog: reviewed, get it in libraries. Let
dialog: the public decide.
text: Giving Jack a look that says Jack has no idea what he's
text: talking about, Miles takes a stance over the ball and focuses.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't come over the top. Stay still.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Just trying to be helpful.
dialog: (a moment later)
dialog: It's all about stillness, Miles.
text: Inner quiet.
text: Miles drops his club and turns to Jack.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's
dialog: the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why are you so hostile? I know you're
dialog: frustrated with your life right now,
dialog: but you can choose not to be so
dialog: hostile.
text: (holding out a cup of
dialog: wine)
dialog: Here.
text: Still fuming, Miles begrudgingly accepts the wine and has a
text: taste. He's immediately distracted from his woes.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
text: Miles downs the rest and is intrigued by the taste.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Huh. Let me see the label.
text: Suddenly a golfball THUDS against the hard fairway directly
text: behind them.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (whirling around)
dialog: What the fuck?
text: Way back on the tee box, some 200 yards away, are a FOURSOME
text: of two couples. One of the MEN is waving his driver.
speaker_heading: HUSBAND #1
dialog: (shouting, barely
dialog: audible)
dialog: Hurry it up, will you?
text: Jack looks at Miles, the two incredulous.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Fucker hit into us.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Throw me his ball.
text: Jack walks over, picks up the offending ball and tosses it
text: to Miles. Miles gets out his 3-wood and -- THWOCK! -- cuts
text: it back low and hard.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nice shot.
speaker_heading: THE COUPLES
text: duck for cover as the ball whistles over their heads.
scene_heading: JACK AND MILES
dialog: laugh hard.
scene_heading: THE TWO HUSBANDS
text: climb in their CART and hasten down the fairway toward Jack
dialog: and Miles.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: watches their approach, grinning.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, this is going to be fun.
dialog: (jerking a driver
dialog: from his bag)
dialog: This is going to be fun.
text: Jack heads in their direction, brandishing the club like a
text: medieval knight with a mace.
text: As the husbands get a look at this sight, they turn their
text: cart around and speed back toward their wives.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hit into us again, motherfuckers,
dialog: and I'll ass-rape all four of you!
scene_heading: EXT. GOLF COURSE CLUBHOUSE - DAY
text: Jack and Miles are turning in their cart and hoisting their
text: clubs over their shoulders.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Just don't give up on Maya. Cool
dialog: smart chicks like that --they like
dialog: persistence.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I don't want to talk about it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: All I know is she's beautiful. Lots
dialog: of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not
dialog: going to feel good about this trip
dialog: until you guys hook up. Don't you
dialog: just want to feel that cozy little
dialog: box grip down on your Johnson?
text: Nearby a GOLFER is with his YOUNG SON.
speaker_heading: GOLFER
dialog: Hey, you mind keeping it down, buddy?
scene_heading: EXT. GOLF COURSE PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Miles and Jack walk toward their car.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Is it the money thing?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Is what the money thing?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: With Maya.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman
dialog: finds out how I live, that I'm not a
dialog: published author, that I'm a liar
dialog: essentially, then yeah, any interest
dialog: is gonna evaporate real quick. If
dialog: you don't have money at my age, you're
dialog: not even in the game. You're just a
dialog: pasture animal waiting for the
dialog: abattoir.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Is an abattoir like a... like a...
dialog: what is that?
speaker_heading: MILES
text: Slaughterhouse.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to
dialog: get the good news this week about
dialog: your book. I know you are. I can
dialog: feel it.
text: Jack's CELLPHONE rings, and he checks the caller ID.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's Steph.
dialog: (picking up)
dialog: Hey, baby. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yesssss. I
dialog: mean I would, but let me see. Hey,
dialog: Miles... Oh fuck it, we're going.
dialog: We'll be right there. Me too.
text: He snaps his phone shut and turns to Miles.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We're on.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What's happening?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We're going to have some fun. Remember
dialog: fun? We're going to have some of it.
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What exactly are we going to do?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I said okay?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You have to tell me --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I SAID OKAY?
text: Miles finally smiles.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: OMITTED
scene_heading: BIG FUN MUSIC BEGINS OVER:
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS OLIVOS - DAY
scene_heading: A HIGH WIDE SHOT --
text: The Saab pulls up where Stephanie and Maya await with bottles

scene_heading: INT./EXT. THE SAAB - DAY
text: They're going FAST, hair whipping around.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the
dialog: restaurant last night looking for
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped
dialog: by for a drink. Didn't see you.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: I had class.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Well, nice to see you now.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: You too.
scene_heading: EXT. BEAUTIFUL ROAD - DAY
dialog: WHOOSH! That car's going a little too FAST!
scene_heading: INT./EXT. LA PURISIMA MISSION CHURCH
text: The two couples wander around this historic site.
scene_heading: EXT. IDYLLIC PICNIC SPOT - DAY INTO DUSK
text: The girls have led them to a beautiful spot.
text: IN A SERIES OF SHOTS --
text: we see the progress of their picnic. We don't hear them, but
text: there is a growing intimacy about their interaction. Even
text: Maya and Miles seem to be overcoming residual awkwardness
text: from the other night. Jack and Stephanie lean on each other
text: as they eat and sip wine.
text: Finally, the two couples are SILHOUETTED against the SUNSET.
scene_heading: EXT. WINERY #3 PARKING LOT - EVENING
text: The parking lot is crowded. The foursome join others headed
text: toward the main building.
scene_heading: INT. WINERY #3 - EVENING
text: A LECTURE by British wine sage LESLIE BROUGH is in progress.
text: He holds aloft a RIEDEL BURGUNDY GLASS containing one of the
text: few but growing number of local reds worthy of his attention.
scene_heading: IN THE AUDIENCE --
text: As our foursome listen attentively, Jack leans over to Miles.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You ever actually read any of this
dialog: guy's books?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: He wrote a great one on Burgundy,
dialog: and I used to get his newsletter,
dialog: but then there were doubts about
dialog: whether he does all his own tasting.
dialog: Plus a couple of times he declared
dialog: certain years vintages of the century,
text: and they turned out to be turkeys.
dialog: Fucker never retracted.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Huh.
text: Stephanie leans forward and signals to Maya with a YAWN or a
text: GAGGING FINGER IN MOUTH that they hightail it. Although Miles
text: protests at first, they stand and leave.
text: AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM --
text: Stephanie finds a DOOR which she tests to see whether it is
text: open. It is! She leads her pals furtively inside --
scene_heading: INT. WINEMAKING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: This is an enormous, dimly-lit chamber filled with stainless
text: steel FERMENTATION TANKS and stacks of OAK BARRELS.
text: As the two couples walk in the near-darkness, they are
text: entranced. Maya takes Miles's hand and leads him away.
speaker_heading: LATER --
text: In the background, Stephanie and Jack lean against a tank,
dialog: kissing.
text: CAMERA DOLLIES to reveal Miles and Maya among the barrels in
text: the foreground. They are shy with each other, on the verge
text: of kissing but holding back.
text: THE MUSIC CONTINUES...
scene_heading: INT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: THREE BOTTLES OF WINE sit empty on the coffee table.
speaker_heading: WIDE --
text: The four friends sit on the floor around the coffee table.
text: They drink wine and pass a JOINT. Suddenly they explode in
scene_heading: LAUGHTER.
text: A sleepy Siena appears at the hallway door rubbing her eyes.
text: Stephanie gets up, but Jack stops her, gathers Siena in his
text: arms, and takes her back to bed.
scene_heading: EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The Saab pulls away from the house.
scene_heading: INT. SAAB - NIGHT
text: Miles sits in his own passenger seat as Maya tries her hand
dialog: at the Saab.
scene_heading: EXT. MAYA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Maya leads Miles up her back stairway. They're both a little
text: woozy from the hours of drinking.
scene_heading: AT THE DOOR --
text: Maya searches through her purse for her keys while Miles
text: hovers directly behind her, staring at her ear. Her ear?
text: Just as Maya puts the key in the lock, he impulsively leans
text: forward to kiss the nape of her neck. Maya's reaction is
text: immediate -- she turns to embrace Miles, giving him a long
text: KISS. Then she opens the door, pulls him inside and closes
text: the door in our face.
text: The camera PANS to the nearby ROOFTOPS.
scene_heading: MUSIC ENDS AND SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: THE SAME VIEW BY DAY, SUPERIMPOSED WITH --
speaker_heading: THURSDAY
text: The CAMERA PANS back to Maya's door, tilting down to find a
text: blue-wrapped NEW YORK TIMES. The door opens, and Maya's hand
text: picks up the newspaper. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Maya inside to --
scene_heading: INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: It is a small, clean apartment furnished with simple taste.
text: Maya is dressed in a ROBE and holds a COFFEE MUG. She drops
text: the paper on the dining table and continues into --
scene_heading: THE BEDROOM --
text: where Miles lies on his stomach DEAD TO THE WORLD. His stubbly
text: face is squished against the mattress and he SNORES lightly.
text: Maya looks at him for a moment before shaking his foot.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMERS' MARKET - DAY
text: This is a weekly event in a big PARKING LOT -- organic
text: produce, candles and incense, honey and cider.
text: Maya and Miles are shopping. Miles carries the bags.
scene_heading: EXT. ORCHARD - DAY
text: Across from each other at a PICNIC TABLE, and surrounded by
text: the remnants of BREAKFAST, Miles and Maya read the NEWSPAPER.
text: Miles is doing the CROSSWORD PUZZLE.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: You guys should stop by the restaurant
dialog: for lunch today.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Great. What's the latest we can get
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: MAYA
text: About two-thirty.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: (noticing)
dialog: Did you hear about this Bordeaux
dialog: tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara
dialog: Saturday night? It's a little pricey,
dialog: but if you wanted to go, I'd be into
dialog: it. Why don't you stay through the
dialog: weekend?
text: Miles has just figured out a difficult clue. As he writes it
dialog: down --
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No, we've got to get back Friday for
dialog: the rehearsal dinner.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: What rehearsal dinner?
text: Miles stops writing.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Who's getting married?
scene_heading: INT./EXT. PARKING AREA NEAR THE ORCHARD - DAY
text: Maya leads the way toward the Saab.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Were you ever going to say anything?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Of course I was. I mean, just now I
dialog: could have made up some story, but I
dialog: didn't. I told you the truth.
text: Maya turns to confront Miles with a look of "Give me a break."
text: Miles reaches out to touch her.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Maya.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: (jerking away)
dialog: Don't touch me. Just take me home.
scene_heading: INT. SAAB - DAY
text: Miles drives, glancing occasionally at Maya, who stares
text: straight ahead.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I've told him. I've told him over
text: and over, but he's out of control.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Do you know what he's been saying to
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: He's an actor, so it can't be good.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Oh, just that he loves her. That
dialog: she's the only woman who has ever
dialog: really rocked his world. How he adores
dialog: Siena. How he wants to move up here
dialog: and get a place with the two of them
dialog: and commute when he has to.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I'm sure he believed every word.
text: A stony silence.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Please believe me. I was even on the
dialog: verge of telling you last night,
dialog: but...
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: But you wanted to fuck me first.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Oh, Maya. No.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: EXT. MAYA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: Miles brings the car to a stop. Maya opens the door and begins
dialog: to get out.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: You know, I just spent three years
dialog: trying to extricate myself from a
dialog: relationship that turned out to be
dialog: full of deception. And I've been
dialog: doing just fine.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: And I haven't been with anyone since
dialog: my divorce. This has been a big deal
dialog: for me, Maya -- hanging out with
dialog: you, and last night. I really like
dialog: you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm
dialog: just his... his freshman roommate
dialog: from San Diego State.
text: Maya wants to let Miles's words reach her, but she can't
dialog: just yet.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Could I have my paper, please?
text: Unsure what she wants at first, Miles reaches into the back
text: seat for the New York Times. He hands it to her and watches
text: until she goes inside.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY
text: Miles pulls up and parks.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: As Miles enters, a shirtless Jack drops the Barely Legal and
text: is immediately upon him, grabbing him in a big BEARHUG. The
text: TV is on, perhaps showing an E! True Hollywood Story.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my
dialog: boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is
dialog: yo' daddy?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Put me down, Jack.
text: Jack continues his paean to Miles's triumphant night.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I said put me down. Jack!
text: Still gripping Miles in a bearhug, Jack flings the both of
text: them onto the bed. Now on top of Miles, Jack KISSES both
dialog: cheeks.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm so proud of you! Let me love
dialog: you!
text: Now they get up off the bed.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So tell me everything. Details. I
dialog: like details.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: It's private.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're kidding, right? Tell me what
dialog: happened, you fucker, or I'll tie
dialog: your dick in a knot.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Let's leave it alone.
text: Jack looks at Miles, his face frozen with incomprehension.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You didn't get any, did you?
dialog: (off Miles's silence)
dialog: You're a homo.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Just stop, okay? Make something up,
dialog: and that's what happened. Whatever
dialog: you want. Write my confession, and
dialog: I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me
dialog: all the time! I can't take it! You're
dialog: an infant! This is all a big party
dialog: for you, but not for me! This is
dialog: serious. And you -- Just... leave me
dialog: alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry.
text: Miles begins to calm down. Jack grows concerned and
text: sensitively puts one arm around his friend.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Did you have trouble performing?
dialog: Yeah, that's...
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
text: The phone RINGS and both men look at it, silenced by the
text: ominous sound.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Don't answer it.
text: But Jack is drawn to it as though enticed by a strange game
text: of Russian roulette.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I'm telling you, don't.
text: Jack picks up the receiver and puts it to his ear.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hello? Oh, hey, honey. How you doing?
dialog: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
dialog: (mouthing)
dialog: Christine.
text: Miles lies on his bed and clamps both hands over his ears.
text: His face is dark with resentment.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Listen, honey. Let me call you back.
dialog: Miles and I are in the middle of
dialog: something. No, it's nothing serious --
text: Miles is just having one of his freak-
dialog: outs. Yeah. Love you too. I'll call
dialog: you right back.
text: Jack hangs up.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: This whole week has gone sour. It
dialog: isn't turning out like it was supposed
dialog: to.
dialog: (deadly serious)
dialog: I want to go home.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Who's being selfish now? I'm the one
dialog: getting married. I thought this week
dialog: was supposed to be about me.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: We gotta slow down.
dialog: (closing his eyes)
dialog: I'm so tired. Let's just get out of
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I know what you need.
scene_heading: INT. SEARS - DAY
text: Jack watches Miles be fitted for SNEAKERS. A SALES ASSOCIATE
text: ties Miles's laces.
speaker_heading: SALES ASSOCIATE
dialog: There you go.
text: Miles gets up and walks in a circle.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Do you like them?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're
dialog: really sporty.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Are they too sporty?
scene_heading: INT. MALL - DAY
text: The boys exit Sears, Miles wearing his new shoes and carrying
text: a PLASTIC BAG with a string handle.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Feel better?
text: Miles shrugs.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (noticing something)
dialog: Oh here, wait a second. I want to
dialog: run in here real quick.
text: He heads toward a TOYS STORE.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (over his shoulder)
dialog: I want to get something for Siena.
text: Mildly concerned, Miles watches Jack go into the store.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY
text: Miles is slumped in the passenger seat as Jack drives. They
text: pass a BIG COMMERCIAL WINERY. Jack slows down, preparing to
dialog: turn in.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How about this one? We didn't hit
dialog: this one.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You ever actually been in there,
dialog: Miles?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I don't have to.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (turning the wheel)
dialog: I say we check it out. You never
dialog: know.
scene_heading: EXT. LARGE WINERY PARKING LOT - DAY
text: The Saab finds a place in the large parking lot. A TOUR BUS,
text: whose flank reads "Solvang Wine Tours," is in the process of
text: letting out WINE TOURISTS, many of them elderly.
scene_heading: INT. LARGE WINERY - DAY
text: The room boasts not only a large TASTING BAR but also display
text: after display of t-shirts, golf shirts, olive oils, chocolate
text: sauces and other gourmet tourist items emblazoned with the
text: winery's logo.
text: In the corner an ACOUSTIC GUITARIST with a small amp plays
text: soothing Windham Hill-ish music.
text: The tasting bar is packed three-deep with TASTERS attended
text: to by HARRIED POURERS.
text: Finally the POURER gets to their glasses. Miles chews a sip
text: and swallows, then downs the rest in a single gulp.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Tastes like the back of a fucking LA
dialog: schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem,
dialog: hoping for some semblance of
dialog: concentration, crushed it up with
dialog: leaves and mice, wound up with this
text: rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash
dialog: bullshit. Fucking Raid.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't know. Tastes okay to me.
dialog: (looking at the tasting
dialog: sheet)
dialog: Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Let me use your phone.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (handing it over)
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I can't take it anymore. I've got to
dialog: call Evelyn.
scene_heading: EXT. LARGE WINERY - DAY
text: Walking across the lawn outside, Miles holds the cellphone
text: to his ear.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Evelyn Berman-Silverman's office.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Hi, it's Miles.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Oh, hi, Miles. Let me see if I can
dialog: get her.
dialog: (a moment later)
dialog: You're in luck. I'll put you through.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Miles.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite
dialog: client.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: How's the trip?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Good, good. Drinking some good wines
dialog: and kicking back, you know. So what's
dialog: happening? Still no word?
speaker_heading: EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Actually there is word. I spoke to
dialog: Keith Kurtzman this morning.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: And... they're passing. Conundrum's
dialog: passing. He said they really liked
dialog: it. They really wanted to do it, but
dialog: they just couldn't figure out how to
dialog: market it. He said it was a tough
dialog: call.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: I'm sorry, Miles.
dialog: (off his silence)
dialog: So I don't know where that leaves
dialog: us. I'm not sure how much more mileage
dialog: I can get out of continuing to submit
dialog: it. I think it's one of those
dialog: unfortunate cases in the business
dialog: right now -- a fabulous book with no
dialog: home. The whole industry's gotten
dialog: gutless. It's not about the quality
dialog: of the books. It's about the
dialog: marketing.
text: Miles is at a loss for words. A distant RUMBLE begins to
text: sound, the familiar harbinger of an anxiety attack.
scene_heading: EXT. DEEP CANYON - INSERT
text: Once again we see the narrow ROPE BRIDGE extending
text: vertiginously across a great CHASM.
scene_heading: EXT. LARGE WINERY - BACK AGAIN
speaker_heading: EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Are you there? Miles?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yeah, I'm here.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could.
dialog: You've been a real trooper.
dialog: (loudly, to her
dialog: assistant)
dialog: Tell him I'll call back.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: So I guess that's it.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: You're a wonderful writer, Miles.
dialog: Don't be discouraged.
scene_heading: MOMENTS LATER --
text: Miles STAGGERS toward the tasting room, unpocketing his Xanax
text: and downing a couple, as Evelyn's clichés of consolation
text: continue in his head.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Just hang in there, and who knows?
dialog: After you get something else
dialog: published, we can revisit this one.
dialog: And next time we can try a different
dialog: title.
text: Once back at the tent, he leans against it in a vain attempt
text: to steady himself. The RUMBLE grows deafening.
scene_heading: INT. LARGE WINERY - DAY
text: Now inside, Miles grabs the first DIRTY WINE GLASS he finds
text: and shakes it out as he approaches the closest tasting
text: station. He pushes his way to front.
text: The pourer offers the usual one-ounce dollop. Miles jacks it
text: back, immediately extending his glass for more.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Hit me again.
text: The same small amount is poured and downed. Once again Miles
text: holds out his glass.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: POURER
dialog: This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
text: Miles slams a TWENTY-DOLLAR BILL on the table.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Just give me a full goddamn pour.
text: The pourer turns away to serve another party. Miles looks
text: around indignantly, as though everyone should be sympathetic
dialog: to this injustice.
text: Now Miles boldly reaches over and pours himself a glass right
text: up to the brim and beyond.
speaker_heading: POURER
dialog: Sir, what are you doing?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I told you I need a drink.
speaker_heading: POURER
dialog: Then buy a bottle and go outside.
text: The pourer grabs Miles by the wrist before he can drink.
speaker_heading: POURER
text: Put the glass down.
text: In the ensuing struggle, the wine spills, and everyone nearby
text: steps back.
speaker_heading: POURER
dialog: You're going to have to leave, sir.
text: The pourer signals to a SECURITY GUY at the door. Across the
text: room Jack notices the disturbance and heads over.
text: Miles hoists up the SPIT BUCKET, holds it aloft and starts
text: to GUZZLE it. Wine cascades down the sides of his face, onto
text: his shirt and even onto his shiny new shoes.
text: The Security Guy yanks the bucket away from Miles, and drags
text: him toward the EXIT. Jack catches up.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to the horrified
dialog: onlookers)
dialog: It's all right. His mother just died.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DAY
text: Two PELICANS soar low over the water. One of the DIVES,
text: crashing into the water and disappearing from view.
text: Jack and Miles sit on the hood of the Saab, gazing at the
text: ocean, sharing a bottle of wine.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Just write another one. You have
dialog: lots of ideas, right?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer.
dialog: I'm a middle-school English teacher.
dialog: I'm going to spend the rest of my
dialog: life grading essays and reading the
dialog: works of others. It's okay. I like
dialog: books. The world doesn't give a shit
dialog: what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.
dialog: (a dark laugh)
dialog: I'm so insignificant, I can't even
dialog: kill myself.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf,
dialog: Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't
dialog: kill yourself before you've even
dialog: been published.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What about that guy who wrote
dialog: Confederacy of Dunces? He committed
dialog: suicide before he got published, and
dialog: look how famous he is.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't give up. You're going to make
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Half my life is over, and I have
dialog: nothing to show for it. I'm a
text: thumbprint on the window of a
text: skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement
text: on a tissue surging out to sea with
text: a million tons of raw sewage.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: See? Right there. Just what you just
dialog: said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint
dialog: on a skyscraper. I couldn't write
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Neither could I. I think it's
dialog: Bukowski.
text: Unable to respond, Jack looks up and down the beach.
scene_heading: EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY
dialog: ZOOM! There goes the Saab.
text: The CAMERA lingers behind and PANS to reveal THE DEAD DOG,
text: now covered with FLIES AND MAGGOTS.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY
text: Jack and Miles pull into the parking lot.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (lighting up)
dialog: Oh, look. There's Steph!
text: He smiles broadly and honks his horn. Miles turns to see --
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
text: seated halfway up on the motel stairs, her HELMET in her
text: lap, watching patiently as --
speaker_heading: THE SAAB
text: pulls to a stop in a parking space.
text: Miles masks his concern as he gets out of the car and reaches
text: in the backseat for his Sears bag.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Hey, baby.
text: Stephanie stands up and slowly descends the steps, as Jack
text: reaches into the trunk and pulls out a BIG CUDDLY LION DOLL.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Look what I got for our favorite
dialog: girl.
text: Stephanie walks toward Jack as he waddles toward her hugging
text: the lion. When they get close, Stephanie's face transforms
dialog: with rage.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: YOU MOTHERFUCKER!
text: She swings her helmet and HITS JACK FULL IN THE FACE.
text: Jack falls, blood spraying out of his nose. Stephanie stands
text: over him and continues to BEAT HIM with her helmet as he
text: rolls back and forth, protecting his head with the stuffed
dialog: lion.
text: Miles ineffectually attempts to stop her, dancing just out
dialog: of range.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Stephanie! Stop!
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: You fucking bastard! Lying piece of
dialog: shit! You're getting married on
dialog: Saturday? What was all that shit you
dialog: said to me?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I can explain.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: You said you loved me! You fuck! I
dialog: hope you die!
text: With that she backs away. Glancing at her bloodied helmet,
text: she tosses it onto the pavement before getting on her bike.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Fuckface!
dialog: (to Miles)
dialog: You too!
text: As she speeds away, Miles is left to comfort his wounded
text: friend. The lion lies nearby, staring blankly at the sky.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY
text: Seated in the passenger seat and in great agony, Jack presses
text: a BLOOD-SOAKED TOWEL against his face.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Aren't you glad you didn't move up
dialog: here and marry her?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't need a lecture. You fucking
dialog: told Maya, didn't you?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No, I did not. Must have been Gary
dialog: at the Hitching Post. I think we
dialog: mentioned it to him the first night.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You told him. I'm fucking hurting
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Keep it elevated.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ER WAITING ROOM - DAY
text: CLOSE ON A COSMOPOLITAN open to an article titled "24 Ways
dialog: To Please Your Man."
speaker_heading: WIDER --
text: Miles reads, while nearby a YOUNG BOY dry-heaves into a
text: garbage can held by his FATHER. An OLD WOMAN parked in a
text: wheelchair faces the wall.
speaker_heading: LATER --
text: Miles is at a PAYPHONE. As he speaks he tries to peel off
text: the metal LONG DISTANCE STICKER.
speaker_heading: MAYA (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if
dialog: you even care, but I had to call and
dialog: tell you again how much I enjoyed
dialog: our time together and how sorry I am
dialog: things turned out the way they did.
dialog: I think you're great, Maya -- always
dialog: have. From the first time you waited
dialog: on me.
dialog: (bracing himself)
dialog: And while I'm at it, I guess you
dialog: should know that my book is not
dialog: getting published. I thought this
dialog: one had a chance, but I was wrong.
dialog: Again. Don't bother reading it --
dialog: you've got better things to do. So
dialog: you see I'm not much of a writer.
dialog: I'm not anything really. The only
dialog: real talent I seem to have is for
dialog: disappointing people and now you
dialog: know that firsthand. We're leaving
dialog: in the morning, and I want you to
dialog: know that I take with me wonderful
dialog: memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really
dialog: sorry.
text: What else to say? He hangs up.
text: He returns to his seat. A moment later he extends his legs
text: to look at his new SHOES now STAINED WITH WINE.
speaker_heading: LATER --
text: Jack emerges unsteadily from the bowels of the emergency
text: room, his face purple and swollen beneath the HUGE WHITE
text: BANDAGE that holds the NOSEGUARD in place. Miles walks with
text: him toward the exit.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm going to need an operation. Maybe
text: a couple of them. They have to wait
dialog: for it it to heal first. Then they
dialog: break it again.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Good thing you have a voice-over
dialog: career.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue
dialog: her ass. Only reason I won't is to
dialog: protect Christine.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: That's thoughtful.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (disgusted)
dialog: Yeah.
text: They walk by us and out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET IN SOLVANG - DAY
text: Jack sits in the Saab's passenger side with the seat almost
text: fully reclined. When his agony allows him to open his eyes,
text: he glares at the DANISH THEMED STORES lining the street. An
text: ABELSKIVER MAKER plies his lofty trade in a nearby window.
text: He hears a strange CLOMPING NOISE and turns his head to see
text: a MAN IN WOODEN CLOGS walking noisily down the street, dressed
text: in a TRADITIONAL DANISH COSTUME and carrying a TUBA. Jack
text: takes a slug of wine.
text: Just then Miles gets back in the car.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I hate this place.
text: Miles tears open a paper bag and removes a bottle of pills.
text: A closer angle reveals them as VICODIN.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Take a couple of these, and you'll
dialog: learn to love it.
text: Miles opens the bottle and hands Jack two PILLS.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Two for you. And two for me.
text: Jack washes down the pills and passes the bottle to Miles,
text: who follows suit.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL INN JACUZZI - EVENING
text: Jack and Miles sit across from each other. For the first
text: time we see LARGE PURPLE BRUISES on Jack's arms and chest.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So how did Stephanie know it was
dialog: Saturday? We didn't get into that
dialog: with Gary.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Huh. Let me think.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You sure you didn't say anything to
dialog: Maya?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Sure I'm sure. And just what are you
dialog: implying? I'm really pissed off at
dialog: you about all this, if you want to
dialog: know the truth. What's Maya going to
dialog: think of me now just for associating
dialog: with you? You're the one who's
dialog: sabotaging me, not the other way
dialog: around, pal. Not by a longshot.
text: Jack takes a long lie-detecting look at Miles.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't know. Just seems fishy.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: The boys lie on their respective beds staring at the TV.
text: Jack gets up and lumbers slowly to the dresser MIRROR like a
text: large dog who has just been neutered.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What's it look like to you?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Looks like you were in a bad car
dialog: accident.
text: Jack turns to Miles, nodding and thinking. Then he looks
text: back in the mirror.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm hungry.
scene_heading: EXT. A.J. SPURS BARBECUE - NIGHT
text: Establishing. Thursday night is Cajun Wings Night.
scene_heading: INT. A.J. SPURS BARBECUE - NIGHT
text: Miles and Jack are finishing their SALADS in the rustic-
text: themed restaurant festooned with animal trophies.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You know what I'm thinking?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm thinking it's time to settle
dialog: down. One woman. One house. You know.
dialog: It's time.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: Jack nods his head with no self-awareness or acknowledgment
dialog: of the irony.
scene_heading: NOW TWO PLATES ARRIVE
text: mounded high with ribs, slaw, beans and butter-whipped mashed
dialog: potatoes.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Mm. Mm.
text: Their cheery, saftig blonde WAITRESS removes several FOIL
text: PACKETS from her apron and places them on the table.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: And here're your Handi-wipes.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, so that's what those are? For a
dialog: second there I thought you guys were
dialog: promoting safe sex.
text: The waitress OVER-LAUGHS and swipes a hand at her naughty
dialog: customer.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: I'll be right back with more corn
dialog: bread.
text: Jack watches her go and leans in close to Miles.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I bet you that chick is two tons of
dialog: fun. You know, the grateful type.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I don't know. I wouldn't know.
text: Now she comes back toward the table carrying a BIG BASKET.
text: Beneath the hideous uniform, her nylons SH-SH-SH as she walks.
text: When she arrives, she replenishes their corn bread basket
text: using big TONGS. Jack watches attentively.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nice technique there...
dialog: (checking her name
dialog: tag)
dialog: ...Cammi.
speaker_heading: CAMMI
text: It's all in the wrist.
dialog: (a moment later)
dialog: You know, you look really familiar.
dialog: You from around here? Where'd you go
dialog: to high school?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, we're from San Diego. Why?
speaker_heading: CAMMI
dialog: I don't know. You just seem really
dialog: familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy
dialog: your meals.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek
dialog: Sommersby?
speaker_heading: CAMMI
dialog: Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean
dialog: from "One Life to Live"?
text: Miles looks away and sighs.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You have to imagine him with a bandage
dialog: and shorter hair.
text: As Cammi stares at Jack, her face transforms in astonishment.
speaker_heading: CAMMI
dialog: No. Way. No way!
text: Jack smiles and nods.
speaker_heading: CAMMI
dialog: Oh, my God!
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Could you tell me where the bathroom
dialog: is?
speaker_heading: CAMMI
dialog: (her eyes barely
dialog: leaving Jack)
dialog: Uh, sure, it's right over there,
text: right past the buffalo.
scene_heading: IN A WIDE SHOT --
text: Miles gets up and heads toward the bathroom as Jack's
text: flirtation with Cammi continues.
text: The camera PANS with Miles as he walks by us and goes through
text: the bathroom door, which closes behind him, filling the frame
text: with the word "MEN."
speaker_heading: LATER --
text: A TOOTHPICK DISPENSER as a finger tips it forward to dispense
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: WIDER --
text: Miles stands by the cash register and PICKS HIS TEETH as he
text: watches Jack finish speaking with Cammi and head his way.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She gets off in an hour, so I think
dialog: I'm just going to have a drink and
dialog: then... make sure she gets home safe.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You're joking, right?
dialog: (seeing that he isn't)
dialog: What are you doing? Un-fucking-
dialog: believeable. Can we just go back to
text: the hotel and hang out and get up
dialog: early and play nine holes before we
dialog: head home?
text: Jack rests one hand on Miles's shoulder and drops his head,
dialog: thinking how best to put it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Look, Miles. I know you're my friend
dialog: and you care about me. And I know
dialog: you disapprove. I respect that. But
dialog: there are some things I have to do
dialog: that you don't understand. You
dialog: understand wine and literature and
dialog: movies, but you don't understand my
dialog: plight. And that's okay.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON MILES --
text: as the disappointment in his friend deepens by the moment.
scene_heading: FADE TO BLACK:
scene_heading: UNDER BLACK, SUPERIMPOSED --
speaker_heading: FRIDAY
text: Now comes the sound of hysterical KNOCKING.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAWN
text: Despite the knocking, Miles remains motionless in bed, his
text: expression serene.
text: Finally he awakens and drags himself toward the door, opening
dialog: it to find --
speaker_heading: JACK
text: silhouetted against the first rosy fingers of dawn. He is
text: barefoot. In fact he is clad only in his UNDERWEAR. Hugging
text: himself, he PANTS and SHIVERS.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Jesus fucking Christ, it's freezing.
text: He limps past Miles, yanks off the bed covers and wraps them
dialog: around himself.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Vicodin. Where's the Vicodin? My
dialog: nose.
text: Miles hands him the bottle, and Jack frantically pops a couple
text: of pills, chewing them like candy. He sits down and bends
text: over at the waist as though preparing for an airplane crash.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Fucking chick's married.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Her husband works a night shift or
text: something, and he comes home, and
text: I'm on the floor with my cock in his
dialog: wife's ass.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked
dialog: all the way back from Solvang?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: That's five clicks, Jackson.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one
dialog: point I had to cut through an ostrich
dialog: farm. Fuckers are mean.
text: Miles has now awakened to take in the absurdity of the whole
text: scene, and he LAUGHS HARD. The blanketed bulge just sits
text: there. Finally it looks up and shows its pitiful visage.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We gotta go back.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I left my wallet. My credit cards,
dialog: cash, fucking ID, everything. We
dialog: gotta go back.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Big deal. We'll call right now and
dialog: cancel your cards.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You don't understand. The wedding
dialog: bands. The wedding bands are in my
dialog: wallet.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Okay, so they were in your wallet,
dialog: and you left your wallet somewhere.
dialog: Some bar. Christine'll understand.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No. She ordered them special. Took
dialog: her forever to find them. They've
dialog: got this design on them with dolphins
dialog: and our names engraved in Sanskrit.
dialog: We've got to go back. Christine'll
dialog: fucking crucify me.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No way. No way.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (a pitiful whine)
dialog: Please, Miles, please.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at
text: a bar. Happens every day.
text: Jack stares straight ahead, breathing through his mouth as
dialog: he considers this. Then --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, we've got to get my wallet! Those
dialog: rings are irreplaceable! We've got
dialog: to get them, Miles! I fucked up! I
dialog: know I fucked up, okay? I fucked up.
dialog: You gotta help me. You gotta help
dialog: me. Pleeeease!
text: Jack now descends to a level of wretchedness and desperation
dialog: that Miles has never seen before in Jack, or in anyone else
dialog: for that matter.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, God, please... Oh God. I know
dialog: I'm bad. I know I did a bad thing.
dialog: Help me, Miles. Just this one thing,
dialog: this one last thing. I can't lose
dialog: Christine. I can't. I'm nothing
dialog: without her. Please, Miles, please...
text: uuuuu... uuuuuu.... uuuuuuu......
text: No longer able to form words, Jack is reduced to emitting
text: low, primitive sounds. Snot flows from beneath his bandaged
dialog: nose.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. SAAB - MORNING
text: Miles drives in the early-morning light. Jack is now subdued,
text: quieted by his pain and exhaustion.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: She tell you she was married?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: So what the fuck were you thinking?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Wasn't supposed to be back till six.
text: Fucker rolls in at five.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Cutting it a little close, don't you
dialog: think?
dialog: (off Jack's silence)
dialog: So how was she? Compared to Stephanie,
dialog: say.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Horny as shit. Flopping around like
dialog: a landed trout.
scene_heading: EXT. LOW-RENT STREET - MORNING
text: The Saab creeps around a corner.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. SAAB - MORNING
text: Jack scans the street.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, this is the block. Just keep
dialog: going...
dialog: (spotting an AMC Pacer)
dialog: Yeah! This is it. There's her car.
text: Miles pulls over and cuts the engine.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: So what's the plan?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The plan is... you go.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: My ankle. Just go explain the
dialog: situation.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (sarcastic, clearing
dialog: his throat)
dialog: Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend
dialog: was the one balling your wife a couple
text: hours ago, and he seems to have left
dialog: his wallet behind, and we were
dialog: wondering...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like
dialog: that.
text: Miles gives Jack a withering look. Jack reaches for the DOOR
speaker_heading: HANDLE.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (grabbing Jack's shirt)
dialog: Hold on.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMMI'S STREET - MORNING
text: Miles crosses the street and approaches --
scene_heading: EXT. CAMMI'S HOUSE - MORNING
text: Miles presses his ear against the front door. Nothing. Then
dialog: he notices --
text: A SLIDING GLASS DOOR a few feet away, just barely cracked
dialog: open.
text: MILES creeps over, sticks his hand into the open space and
text: pulls back the curtain to reveal --
text: A LIVING ROOM the is hideously MESSY. Draped over a deformed
text: beanbag chair are JACK'S LEVI'S.
text: Miles gathers his courage, carefully slides open the glass
text: door, and creeps inside.
scene_heading: INT. CAMMI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: A furtive search of Jack's pockets reveals NOTHING. Then
text: Miles notices a HIGH-PITCHED SOUND wafting from an open door
text: down a short HALLWAY.
text: Miles feverishly begins foraging through the debris on the
text: floor. Again nothing. Meanwhile the noise from the bedroom
text: grows louder -- female MOANING in odd rhythmic unison with a
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE.
scene_heading: IN THE HALLWAY --
text: Miles gets on ALL FOURS and starts crawling, weaving his way
text: through a trail of shoes and clothes.
text: Nearing the open door, the sounds grow more distinct --
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You don't think I fuck you, bitch?
dialog: I'll fuck you.
speaker_heading: CAMMI
dialog: I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
text: Miles peers around the corner of the open door to see --
scene_heading: INT. CAMMI'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Cammi is TIED to the faux brass headboard. A BIG GUY slams
text: away at her. In the corner a soundless TV shows a PRESIDENTIAL
scene_heading: PRESS CONFERENCE.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You picked him up and you fucked
dialog: him, didn't you, bitch?
speaker_heading: CAMMI
dialog: I picked him up and I fucked him.
dialog: I'm a bad girl.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: And you liked fucking him, didn't
dialog: you, you fat little whore?
speaker_heading: CAMMI
dialog: I liked it when you caught me fucking
dialog: him.
dialog: Whoa!
text: Miles manages to tear his eyes away from this nature
text: documentary and scan the room.
scene_heading: IRIS IN --
text: to the WALLET atop the dresser.
text: Miles's eyes dart back and forth between the couple and the
text: wallet. His HEART BEATING LOUDLY, he goes for it. He scrambles
text: to his feet, dashes across the room, seizes the wallet and
text: tears out. Behind him he hears --
speaker_heading: MAN (O.S.)
dialog: The fuck was that?
speaker_heading: CAMMI (O.S.)
dialog: The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
scene_heading: EXT. CAMMI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Miles comes flying out of the sliding glass door, followed
text: swiftly by the man, who is of course STARK NAKED. And he's
dialog: fast for a man his size.
speaker_heading: CAMMI (O.S.)
dialog: Get him!
scene_heading: INT. SAAB - MORNING
text: Jack is reclined in the passenger seat FAST ASLEEP. On the
text: radio NPR'S CARL KASSEL reads the news.
scene_heading: THROUGH THE DRIVER'S WINDOW --
text: Miles comes sprinting towards us, mere steps ahead of Cammi's
text: naked husband. Finding the car door locked, Miles knocks
text: loudly on the glass, startling Jack awake.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Open up! Jesus! Open the goddamn
dialog: door!
text: Jack flips the electric locks just in time for Miles to get
dialog: in before --
text: WHUMP! The guy's BELLY hits the window. He pounds on the
text: roof before trying the door, now re-locked.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You motherfuckers! I'll kill you!
dialog: I'll kill you motherfuckers!
text: Miles starts the car and begins to drive away. The guy tries
text: to keep up but can't, running barefoot on asphalt. Jack turns
dialog: to look --
scene_heading: OUT THE BACK WINDOW --
text: The guy recedes in the distance.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: removes the rings from the wallet.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You did it! You fucking did it!
text: They LAUGH and SLAP HANDS.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON MILES --
dialog: For all his failures, this time he did something right.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: The shades are drawn. Jack is CRASHED OUT on the bed, snoring
text: loudly. Miles folds his shirts and trousers -- readying his
dialog: bags for departure.
text: At one moment he stops and watches his friend sleep.
text: A KNOCK at the door. Miles goes to answer it, but once his
text: hand is on the knob, he pauses. If we're perceptive, we will
text: know he's hoping against hope that it's Maya.
text: He opens it. It's just the MAID with her big CART.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Housekeeping.
speaker_heading: OMIT.
scene_heading: EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY
text: The Saab enters the freeway and heads south.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY
text: Miles drives while Jack stares out the window, WATCHING THE
text: LANDSCAPE CHANGE as they leave wine country.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Hey, Jack. Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hrnrnrn?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: That was quite a day yesterday.
text: Jack's eyes close, but his lips spread into a smile.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yep. Quite a day.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Quite a week.
scene_heading: EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY
text: A driving shot.
scene_heading: EXT. FILLING STATION - DAY
text: Miles pumps the gas, while nearby Jack stretches his legs.
text: As Miles puts the nozzle back in place --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Want me to drive?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No, I'm okay.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey, why don't you invite Maya to
dialog: the wedding?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Somehow I don't think inviting Maya
dialog: to your wedding is the right move.
dialog: In fact, after your bullshit, it's
dialog: going to be hard for me to even go
text: to the Hitching Post again.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're so negative.
text: Miles replaces the hose and screws on the gas cap.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Come on, let me drive.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I'm fine. You rest.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I feel like driving.
scene_heading: INT. SAAB - DAY
text: As the car makes its way back toward the freeway, Jack looks
text: over at Miles and slows the car to a stop.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
text: Miles obeys. Without hesitation, Jack accelerates and JUMPS
text: THE CURB, heading into --
scene_heading: EXT. VACANT LOT - CONTINUOUS
text: The Saab plows INTO A TREE.
scene_heading: INT. SAAB - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What the fuck!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (pointing at his face)
dialog: You said it looked like a car
dialog: accident.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What the fuck!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll pay for it.
scene_heading: EXT. VACANT LOT - DAY
text: They get out to inspect the damage. The hood is slightly
text: crumpled, and the front fender is bent.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Look at this!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't know. Doesn't look like
dialog: anybody got hurt in this one.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You need a new car anyway.
text: Miles looks at his friend, incredulous.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I said I'd pay for it.
scene_heading: MOMENTS LATER --
text: The trunk is open, and the guys are unloading their cases of
text: wine. Miles notices that one box is DRIPPING.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You broke some.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Whatever. Sorry.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No, not whatever. You fucking
text: derelict.
scene_heading: MOMENTS LATER --
text: Miles looks on as Jack hoists a FOUNDATION BLOCK toward the
text: open driver's door of the Saab.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You ready?
text: Miles waves his hand in a gesture of "Get it over with."
text: Grunting with effort, Jack leans inside the car and drops
text: the foundation block onto the GAS PEDAL.
text: Direct hit! Jack leaps backward and hits the dirt just in
dialog: time.
text: Miles and Jack watch the driverless Saab race toward the
text: tree, its speed increasing. But just before hitting it, the
text: car drifts to one side and SAILS RIGHT PAST.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Oh, fuck!
text: The car zooms wildly across the vacant lot and, missing the
text: tree, continues on until CRASHING THROUGH A FENCE and finally
text: toppling headlong into a CEMENT TRENCH. Only the back of the
text: car remains visible.
text: The whole thing is finished in a matter of seconds. Still
text: frozen in place, Miles and Jack turn slowly to each other.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's okay. I've got Triple A.
scene_heading: EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY
text: From in front of the Saab, we see its now CRUMPLED HOOD and
text: FENDER, a couple of BUNGEE CORDS holding the whole thing
dialog: together.
scene_heading: EXT. PALOS VERDES STREET - DAY
text: The Saab approaches the end of the line.
scene_heading: EXT. ERGANIAN HOUSE --DAY
scene_heading: AT THE FRONT PORCH --
text: Miles has helped Jack carry his bags and the wine. He plops
dialog: the last case down.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Well. That about does it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why don't you come in?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Uh-uh. You're on your own.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yeah.
text: They give each other a brief manly back-slappy hug.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Love you, man.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Back at you.
text: Miles heads toward the curb.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey, don't pull away till they see
dialog: the car.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (over his shoulder)
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (turning around)
dialog: Hey, why wasn't I injured?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (big smile)
dialog: You were wearing your belt.
scene_heading: BACK AT HIS CAR --
text: Miles gets in and watches through the side window as Mrs.
text: Erganian opens the front door and welcomes Jack with shock
text: and dismay. Jack points back at --
text: MILES raising one hand in a feeble wave. The camera slowly
text: MOVES CLOSER as he continues to watch --
speaker_heading: JACK --
dialog: weaving his story of woe. He's a great actor when he wants
text: to be. Mr. Erganian and a mortified Christine come to the
text: door too. Mr. Erganian takes a few steps toward the car to
dialog: get a better look.
scene_heading: VERY CLOSE ON MILES --
text: watching the drama play out. Then his eyes drop as he
text: momentarily loses himself in melancholy. This reverie is
dialog: interrupted by --
scene_heading: THE VOICE OF AN ARMENIAN PRIEST
text: Startled, Miles turns to look at --
speaker_heading: A PRIEST
text: who is singing the BLESSING OF THE RINGS.
dialog: We are now in --
scene_heading: INT. ARMENIAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH - DAY
text: The church is packed.
text: CLOSE ON THE RINGS as the priest holds them aloft.
text: If those rings could talk... Jack shoots a quick look at
text: Miles, who looks right back. The priest continues his
dialog: blessing.
scene_heading: EXT. ARMENIAN CHURCH - DAY
text: AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS --
text: The WEDDING FAMILIES greet the exiting guests in a RECEIVING
text: LINE. Smiling and exuberant, Jack seems utterly at home as
dialog: the new groom.
text: AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS --
text: Miles watches the scene, not without melancholy. Then --
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, Miles.
text: Miles turns and looks up to see Victoria, standing one step
text: above him. Just behind her is her NEW HUSBAND. He exudes the
text: quiet confidence of a successful businessman who played
dialog: college football, takes expensive skiing and sailing
text: vacations, and hasn't read a novel since high school.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Hi, Vicki.
dialog: (taking her in)
dialog: You look beautiful.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my
dialog: husband.
text: From his spot hovering over Miles, Ken leans down and offers
text: his hand.
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: How are you?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Hi. How you doing? You're a lucky
dialog: guy.
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (to Victoria)
dialog: I'll wait for you at the car.
dialog: (to Miles)
dialog: Nice to meet you, Miles.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Ken.
dialog: Exit Ken.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: That was big of him.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Yeah, he's good that way. Very
dialog: considerate.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: That's great.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: So how're you doing?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Since the last time we spoke? I don't
dialog: know. Could be better. Could be worse.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: So what's happening with your book?
speaker_heading: MILES
text: Universally rejected. Strike three.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are
dialog: you going to do?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Back to the drawing board, I guess.
dialog: Or not. So... you're married.
dialog: Congratulations. You look happy.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Seems like everyone's getting married.
dialog: A year ago it was all divorces. Now
dialog: it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I guess.
text: Just then a BLACK LINCOLN NAVIGATOR pulls up alongside the
text: curb. The passenger side window is halfway down, and the
text: sounds of Adult Contemporary Jazz waft out. Victoria gives
text: Ken a little wave.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (shifting gears)
dialog: Well, let's go have some champagne,
dialog: shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Not me. I'm not drinking.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You quit drinking?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I'm pregnant.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (hit in the solar
dialog: plexus)
dialog: Oh. Huh. Well...
dialog: (rallying)
dialog: Congratulations again, Vicki. That's
dialog: wonderful news.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (going to the car)
dialog: See you over there, Miles.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yeah.
text: As she gets in the car and cruises away, Miles glances back
dialog: at --
scene_heading: THE RECEIVING LINE
text: -- where Mike Erganian is introducing Jack to some dear old
text: FRIENDS. Mike throws a loving arm around his new son-in-law,
text: and Jack is drawn into Mike's bosom.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: A HAND-PAINTED SIGN, attached to a STOP SIGH and decorated
text: with balloons, reads: "RECEPTION THIS WAY!" with an arrow
text: pointing RIGHT.
text: One by one, CARS are making a right turn. But when his turn
text: comes, Miles turns LEFT.
scene_heading: EXT. MILES'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY
text: The Saab pull up outside. Miles leaves the car idling as he
text: sprints inside. Moments later he sprints back to his car,
text: this time carrying SOMETHING.
speaker_heading: OMIT
scene_heading: INT. FAST FOOD PLACE - DAY
text: His bowtie undone, Miles sits at a booth eating. He washes
text: down a bite by draining the contents of a big wax-coated
text: soft drink cup.
text: He brings the cup to his lap and refills it from a BOTTLE OF
text: WINE hidden next to him. As he sets the bottle back down, we
dialog: glimpse the label: 1961 Cheval Blanc.
text: He takes another sip. As the camera MOVES CLOSER, all the
text: complex emotions inspired by the wine ripple across Miles's
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: 14-YEAR-OLD BOY (O.S.)
dialog: "The marrow of his bone," I repeated
dialog: aimlessly. This at least penetrated
dialog: my mind. Phineas had died from the
text: marrow of his bone flowing down his
text: blood stream to his heart.
scene_heading: INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY
text: The voice belongs to one of Miles's PUPILS reading aloud in
text: class. Other students follow along silently from their own
text: copies of A Separate Peace.
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSED --
scene_heading: FIVE WEEKS LATER
text: Miles sits behind his desk at the front of the class.
scene_heading: 14-YEAR-OLD BOY
dialog: I did not cry then or ever about
dialog: Finny. I did not cry even when I
text: stood watching him being lowered
dialog: into his family's straight-laced
dialog: burial ground outside of Boston. I
dialog: could not escape a feeling that this
dialog: was my own funeral, and you do not
dialog: cry in that case.
text: The students look up.
scene_heading: 14-YEAR-OLD BOY
dialog: Do you want me to keep reading the
dialog: next chapter, Mr. Raymond?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (as though coming to)
dialog: Hrnrnrn? No, we'll pick up there on
dialog: Monday.
scene_heading: INT. MILES'S APARTMENT - EVENING
text: Miles enters his tiny apartment. He loosens his tie and puts
text: down his satchel.
text: On his way to the kitchen, he presses a button on his
text: ANSWERING MACHINE. As it plays, he opens the REFRIGERATOR
text: and looks inside.
scene_heading: ANSWERING MACHINE
dialog: One new message.
speaker_heading: MAYA'S VOICE
dialog: Hello, Miles. It's Maya.
text: Miles FREEZES, not wanting to miss a single syllable.
speaker_heading: MAYA'S VOICE
dialog: Thanks for your letter. I would have
dialog: called you sooner, but I think I've
dialog: needed some time to think about
dialog: everything that happened and what
dialog: you wrote to me. Another reason I
dialog: didn't call sooner is that I wanted
dialog: to finish your book, which I finally
dialog: did last night.
text: Miles's heart pounds.
speaker_heading: MAYA'S VOICE
dialog: I think it's really lovely, Miles.
dialog: You're so good with words. Who cares
dialog: if it's not getting published? There
dialog: are so many beautiful and painful
dialog: things about it. Did you really go
dialog: through all that? It must have been
dialog: awfully hard. And the sister character --
dialog: Jesus, what a wreck. But I have to
dialog: say I was really confused by the
dialog: ending. Did the father finally commit
dialog: suicide, or what? It's driving me
dialog: crazy. And the title.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY
scene_heading: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD --
text: We see ourselves taking the BUELLTON EXIT.
speaker_heading: MAYA'S VOICE
dialog: Anyway, it's turned cold and rainy
dialog: here lately. But I like winter. So
dialog: listen, if you ever do decide to
dialog: come up here again, you should let
dialog: me know. I would say stop by the
dialog: Hitching Post, but to tell you the
dialog: truth I'm not sure how much longer
dialog: I'm going to be working there. I'm
dialog: going to graduate soon so I'll
dialog: probably relocate. We'll see.
scene_heading: EXT. MAYA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
