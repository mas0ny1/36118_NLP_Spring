text: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT./EXT. A CAR (MOVING). NIGHT
text: The shifting lights from the odd passing car play over the
text: faces of MR. and MRS. PRESCOTT, a pleasant-looking couple in
text: their late thirties, dressed up for a night out. Mr. Prescott
text: drives them along a dark hilly two-lane highway.
speaker_heading: MRS. PRESCOTT
dialog: Why do they always put braces on
dialog: teenage girls at the exact moment
dialog: when they're the most self-conscious
dialog: about their appearance?
text: Pause.
speaker_heading: MR. PRESCOTT
dialog: I don't know.
text: UP AHEAD, near the top of the oncoming hill, a RED PICKUP
text: TRUCK is poking its nose out of the short exit lane.
speaker_heading: MRS. PRESCOTT
dialog: Tom --
speaker_heading: MR. PRESCOTT
dialog: I see him...
text: The PICKUP LURCHES into the road, with not nearly enough
dialog: time to spare.
speaker_heading: MRS. PRESCOTT
dialog: Tom!
speaker_heading: MR. PRESCOTT
dialog: Jesus!
text: Mr. Prescott swerves OVER the DOUBLE SOLID WHITE LINE and
text: clears the truck as --
text: Another pair of HEADLIGHTS from an oncoming truck RISES UP
text: over the HILL directly in FRONT of them --
speaker_heading: MRS. PRESCOTT
dialog: (Screams)
dialog: Tom!
text: Mr. Prescott's FOOT STOMPS on the BRAKE. We BLACK OUT and
text: there is the SOUND of a terrible CRASH.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE PRESCOTTS' FRONT DOOR. NIGHT
text: The SHADOW of a big man looms up onto the front door. A big
text: finger RINGS the BELL.
dialog: A moment.
text: AMY, a thirteen-year-old baby-sitter with braces, opens the
text: door and looks up. In the b.g. we see TWO CHILDREN, SAMMY
text: (Samantha) and TERRY PRESCOTT, in their pajamas, lying on
text: their stomachs in the living room, watching television. Sammy
dialog: is eleven. Terry is eight.
text: REVERSE: DARRYL, the SHERIFF, a portly fellow with glasses
text: and a mustache, looks down at AMY.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Hello, Amy.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (Puzzled)
dialog: Hi, Darryl.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (Thinking)
dialog: Amy, would you please tell the kids
dialog: you'll be right back, and then shut
text: the door and come outside to talk to
dialog: us for a minute?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: OK.
dialog: (To kids)
dialog: Be right back, you guys!
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: You're not supposed to go out, Amy.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: She's going to smoke a cigarette.
text: AMY closes the door and looks expectantly up at Darryl. Darryl
dialog: doesn't know how to start.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH. DAY
text: CREDITS BEGIN OVER a blustery April day. The steeple of the
text: little white church stands out against the sharp blue sky.
scene_heading: INT. TOWN CHURCH. DAY
text: It's a small church and a small congregation, but it's full.
text: There's a CHOIR of mostly SENIOR CITIZENS arrayed in the
text: back. TWO CLOSED CASKETS are laid out in front of the
text: MINISTER, a fiftyish woman with thick glasses and salt-and-
text: pepper hair, who is giving a eulogy MOS.
text: Among the mourners in the second row sit Terry and Sammy,
text: both redeyed, and uncomfortable in their dress-up clothes.
text: Their Aunt Ruth, a pinch-faced woman in her forties, sits
text: next to them.
text: Sammy and Terry are holding hands tightly. Terry wipes his
text: eyes with his free hand.
text: The Minister addresses her remarks to the children. Sammy is
text: hanging on the Minister's every word; Terry is shifting his
text: eyes and his seat as if it will kill him to sit still another
dialog: minute.
text: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SCOTTSVILLE CEMETERY. SIXTEEN YEARS LATER. DAY
text: On the beautiful hill overlooking the beautiful windy green
text: country, SAMMY, twenty-seven years old now, puts flowers on
text: her parents' graves with quick, practiced movements.
text: She is a nice-looking young woman of a neat appearance, saved
text: from primness by an elusive, pleasantly flustered quality.
text: An unsuccessfully neat person. She is dressed in office
text: clothes -- white blouse, dark skirt, high heels, light
text: raincoat over everything. She picks out a couple of weeds
text: and then bows her head and closes her eyes.
text: CREDITS END.
scene_heading: EXT. SCOTTSVILLE -- MAIN STREET. DAY
text: Scottsville is a small town. Main Street. Run-down old stores
text: next to a new bank, a couple of chain stores, a few
dialog: restaurants of varying ambitions. Civil War statue. World
dialog: War I statue. World War II statue. Residential streets
dialog: wandering away from Main Street up and down hills. You know
text: there's a minimall somewhere nearby. A fair amount of activity
dialog: during the daytime.
text: SAMMY'S CAR pulls up across the street from where an eight-
text: year-old BOY in a secondhand baseball jacket and a school
text: knapsack is waiting at the curb. This is her son, RUDY. SAMMY
text: calls out the car window.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Rudy, come on! I'm really late!
text: Rudy hurries across the street and gets in the car, slinging
text: his knapsack into the backseat.
scene_heading: INT. THE CAR (MOVING). DAY
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: How was school?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Stupid.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: We're supposed to write a story for
dialog: English homework, but they didn't
dialog: tell us what it's supposed to be
text: about.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I mean they didn't tell us what it's
dialog: supposed to be about. They said do
dialog: whatever you want.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: So what's wrong with that?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Nothing. I just think it's
text: unstructured.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: (Smiles)
dialog: Well, I'm sure you'll be able to
dialog: think of something. If you can't,
dialog: I'll help you.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. CAR/CAROL'S HOUSE. DAY
text: Sammy stops the car outside a heavily THICKETED DRIVEWAY
text: (CAROL'S HOUSE), and RUDY gets out.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Don't forget your backpack.
text: Rudy returns to take his knapsack out of the back.
speaker_heading: RUDY
text: It's not a backpack, it's a knapsack.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Don't forget your knapsack.
text: Rudy hoists his knapsack out of the back.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Give me a kiss.
text: Rudy gives her a kiss and puts his arms around her and
text: squeezes her neck.
text: He withdraws, slams the door. As Sammy DRIVES AWAY, he slogs
text: up the long twisting driveway.
scene_heading: EXT. MERCHANTS NATIONAL TRUST -- PARKING LOT. DAY
text: Sammy gets out of her car, which is parked in one of the
text: half dozen spaces in the little parking lot allocated for
dialog: bank employees.
text: She hurries toward the employees' entrance, fixing her skirt
text: as she goes.
scene_heading: INT. MERCHANTS NATIONAL TRUST. DAY
text: Sammy hurries down the clean hallway in the back past MABEL,
text: a pleasant-faced fellow employee.
speaker_heading: MABEL
dialog: Guess who's been asking for you?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Oh no, really?
text: Mabel nods and passes by.
text: SAMMY KNOCKS on a big door that says "Manager" and has half
dialog: the letters of the previous branch manager's name taken off
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (Inside)
dialog: Yeah, come in!
text: Sammy swings open the door. BRIAN EVERETT, the new branch
text: manager, is unpacking a box. Sammy is surprised to see he is
text: in his early thirties and very good-looking in a boyish sort
text: of way; he wears shirt-sleeves and tie, and a wedding ring.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Mr. Everett?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah: Brian.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Brian. Hi. I'm Samantha Prescott --
dialog: I'm the lending officer?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah, hi, how are you? Come on in.
dialog: Sit down.
text: Sammy comes into the office and sits.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I am so sorry I was late...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah, we missed you before...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I got held up. Believe me, it is not
dialog: something I make a habit of...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I'm sure it's not. Actually -- could
dialog: you just, could you close that door
dialog: for me? Thanks.
text: Sammy gets up and closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. BRIAN'S OFFICE. LATER
text: Sammy sits in front of Brian's desk. Brian is behind the
text: desk listening.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: -- so I always just run out at 3:15
dialog: to pick him up and then run him real
text: quick over to the sitter's house.
dialog: Anyway, Larry never minded about it
dialog: and I was just hoping it would be OK
dialog: with you too...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well -- Samantha -- I realize that
dialog: Scottsville is not exactly a major
dialog: banking center...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: No it's not...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No -- I know it's not... But it's
dialog: kind of a personal challenge to me
dialog: to see what we can do to bring local
dialog: service up to the same kinds of
dialog: standards we'd be trying to meet if
dialog: we were the biggest branch in the
dialog: state. And that means I don't want
dialog: anybody running out at 3:15 or 3:30,
dialog: or whenever the bus happens to come
dialog: in that day. Now is there anybody
dialog: else who can pick your son up after
dialog: school? Does your husband work in
dialog: the area? Do you --
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Oh -- No -- Rudy Sr. isn't "on the
dialog: scene." So to speak.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well, I can give you a couple of
dialog: days to make some other arrangement,
dialog: but...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Well -- Brian? I understand what
dialog: you're saying, and I think it's great.
dialog: I do. Because there's a lot of things
dialog: around here that could use some
dialog: attention. Believe me. But I've
dialog: honestly been meeting that bus every
dialog: day for four years now and it really
dialog: does take just fifteen minutes, and
dialog: if I take the time out of my lunch
dialog: hour...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I'd really prefer it if you would
dialog: make some other arrangement. OK?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: (Brightly)
dialog: I'll do my best...!
text: Brian kicks back in his chair and puts his hands behind his
text: head.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: How old's your son?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: He's eight.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: That's a terrific age.
scene_heading: INT. SAMMY'S CAR (MOVING). DUSK
text: Sammy and Rudy drive home in silence. The orange sunlight
text: flickers through the trees and onto their faces as they drive
dialog: along.
scene_heading: EXT. PRESCOTT (SAMMY'S) HOUSE. DUSK
dialog: The same house that Sammy grew up in, with sixteen years'
dialog: more wear on it.
text: Sammy's car swings expertly by the mailbox, and Rudy reaches
text: half his body out of the passenger window and gets the mail.
scene_heading: INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. DUSK
text: Sammy comes into the house carrying two bags of groceries.
text: Rudy follows, looking through the mail. Sammy passes through
text: the house and goes into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You got a letter from Uncle Terry.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: What?!
text: Her whole face lights up and she grabs the letter. She tears
text: it open and reads it with growing excitement.
scene_heading: INT. SAMMY'S BEDROOM. LATER
text: Sammy opens her FILE DRAWER. Inside are tax files, household
dialog: files, miscellaneous files.
text: She puts Terry's letter away in a very full file marked "Terry --
text: Correspondence." The folder is stuffed with other letters,
dialog: on all different kinds of stationery from all over the
dialog: country, all from Terry.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM. NIGHT
text: Sammy and Rudy are eating dinner. It's a biggish house for
dialog: just two people.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Whose room is he gonna stay in?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: He can stay in the little room.
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: But you know what? He's not going to
dialog: live here. He's only gonna stay for
dialog: a little while... And it's OK if you
dialog: don't remember him, because you were
dialog: only six the last time he was here...
dialog: But it'll be nice if you got a chance
dialog: to get to know each other a little
dialog: bit. Don't you think?
text: Rudy looks worried and doesn't answer.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. LATER
text: Rudy is on the floor, writing in his school composition
text: notebook. Sammy comes downstairs.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Rudy? Would it distract you if I put
dialog: on some music?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: No.
text: She puts on a CD, sits down and picks up a book. She looks
text: at Rudy, who is writing away.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Did you think of a story?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: What's it about?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: My father.
text: Pause.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: What about your father?
speaker_heading: RUDY
text: It's just a made-up story about him.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Can I read it when you're done?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: It's not very good.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Don't say that.
text: Rudy keeps writing.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. LATER
text: Sammy is smoking a cigarette and drinking a glass of wine
text: and reading Rudy's story. It upsets her.
scene_heading: INT. SAMMY'S BEDROOM. LATER
text: Sammy sits on the edge of her bed, not dialing the phone.
text: She catches a glimpse of herself in her parents' floor-length
text: mirror with the worn, heavy wooden frame. Against her better
text: judgment she picks up the phone and dials.
scene_heading: INT. DAWSON'S GRILL. NIGHT
text: Sammy and BOB STEEGERSON are eating dinner at Dawson's, the
text: only fancy restaurant in town. Bob is in his mid-thirties, a
dialog: Realtor, a decent, ordinary guy.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Anyway, Bob, it's sort of this
dialog: adventure story, and Rudy's father
dialog: is this secret agent or something,
dialog: working for the government... And it
dialog: just made me feel weird. You know?
dialog: Because I never really say much to
dialog: him about Rudy Sr., because I don't
dialog: know what to say. And I don't know
dialog: whether I should just let him imagine
dialog: whatever he wants to imagine, or
dialog: whether I should sit him down sometime
dialog: and tell him, you know, that his
dialog: father is not such a nice person.
dialog: You know?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well... I don't know, Sammy. What
dialog: have you told him already?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Not much. He knows I don't have the
dialog: highest opinion of him. And he knows
dialog: I don't want to see him or know
dialog: anything about him, ever. But I tried
dialog: to keep it kind of neutral. Anyway...
dialog: I could go into a lot more detail,
dialog: believe me.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well... It's an interesting problem.
dialog: But I don't really know what to tell
dialog: you... It's a little outside my
dialog: personal field of expertise...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'd be glad to give it some thought...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: OK.
text: He is smiling at her.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Nothing... I'm just glad to see you...
dialog: I'm glad you called me.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I bet you were surprised...!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Um -- a little.
text: Bob drains his wineglass. Sammy cuts at her steak.
scene_heading: INT. BOB'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
text: Sammy and Bob lie in Bob's bed, a few minutes after having
text: made love. They are very far away from each other, but trying
dialog: with difficulty not to let on.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I should get going...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Yeah... I've got the baby-sitter...
dialog: But... Thanks for a lovely evening.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Oh. Thank you.
text: She kisses him. She tries to make it sexy, but he's not into
text: it anymore and he politely restricts the kissing.
scene_heading: INT. SAMMY'S BATHROOM. NIGHT
text: Sammy stands in her slip brushing her teeth in front of the
text: mirror. She brushes vigorously, looking at herself while she
dialog: brushes.
text: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET CORNER -- WORCESTER, MASS. DAWN
text: The corner window of a grim little apartment building on a
text: very grim street in a grim little city.
scene_heading: INT. TERRY'S APARTMENT -- WORCESTER, MASS. NIGHT
text: A tiny apartment with a bed, chair, table, fridge, and not
text: much else. One window has a broken pane and an old sheet
text: neatly thumbtacked over it to keep the wind out.
text: TERRY PRESCOTT comes in. He is twenty-five years old: a real
text: mess with a certain natural appeal. He wears old jeans, very
text: old hiking boots, and a lumberjack-style coat. He takes a
text: wool hat off his head. His hair is longish and dirty.
text: SHEILA SADLER is sitting at the table by the fridge. She is
text: barely eighteen, frail and damaged.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: Hey, Terry.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Hey.
text: Terry looks at her and smiles encouragingly. She smiles back.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: Where'd you get the hat?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Oh, I got it on the street for a
dialog: dollar.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: It's nice.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well, you know, it's pretty much
dialog: your standard woolen hat.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: Yeah, I had a very similar reaction
text: to it.
text: Sheila looks away. Silence.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Can I get that money from you?
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: Yeah. Sorry.
text: As she opens her purse, Terry takes a few vague steps toward
text: her. She takes out a tiny hippie-ish woven wallet and gives
dialog: Terry all the money in it: a twenty and two ones.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Is that all you have?
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Can you borrow some cash from your
dialog: brother?
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: Um, yeah, but that would involve
text: speaking to him.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well, I'm definitely gonna be gone
dialog: for a couple of days at least, Sheila.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: Why do you have to stay so long?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Because my sister is not a bank, you
dialog: know? I can't just show up and ask
dialog: her for --
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: You seem to think my brother's a
dialog: bank!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Oh Sheila can we just cut out the
dialog: puerile crap?! I'll be back just as
dialog: soon as I can. OK? I am not the kind
dialog: of man that everyone says I am.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: I know you're not.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I'll call you tonight.
text: Pause.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: Don't you wanna tell me you love me?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: That was really convincing.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well... I think after this is over
dialog: you should seriously consider moving
dialog: back home.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: (Short laugh)
dialog: Oh, yeah.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (Gives up)
dialog: All right...
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: You gonna call tonight?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Definitely.
text: She puts her arms around him and holds on.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK STATE -- MOUNTAINS -- HIGHWAY. DAY
text: Wide open shot of hilly country and a big sky overhead. A
text: GREYHOUND BUS drives into the shot along the curve of the
dialog: highway.
scene_heading: INT. BUS (MOVING) -- BATHROOM. DAY
text: Terry is seated on the toilet seat in the cramped bathroom
text: smoking a joint. He takes a huge hit and holds it in for as
text: long as humanly possible. He blows out what's left, takes
text: another equally huge hit and holds it in.
scene_heading: EXT. LOCAL HIGHWAY. DAY
text: The BUS WHOOSHES along a smaller, heavily wooded roller-
dialog: coaster road.
scene_heading: INT. BUS (MOVING). DAY
text: Terry looks out the window at the passing scenery. The
text: sunlight flickers on his face.
text: POV TERRY: The bus rolls past the hilltop cemetery.
text: Terry shifts uncomfortably in his seat.
text: POV TERRY: THE "WELCOME TO SCOTTSVILLE" SIGN whizzes by.
text: Houses start dotting the side of the road.
text: Terry starts getting very agitated.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY
text: Terry stands at one end of Main Street, backpack over his
text: shoulder, as the BUS DRIVES OFF. He looks around at the town
dialog: going about its Saturday afternoon business.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. SIMULTANEOUS
text: Loud country-western music is blaring as Sammy, wearing an
text: apron, sets a big vase of flowers on the kitchen table and
text: hurries to the oven. There are also cookies, a pie, evidence
text: of massive fancy cooking. She puts on her oven mitts and
text: takes a lasagna out of the oven, as the phone rings. She
text: picks up.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: (Into phone)
dialog: Hello?... TERRY!...
scene_heading: EXT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. DAY
text: Sammy practically bursts out the front door. She has changed
dialog: into nice clothes.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY. DAY
text: Terry secrets himself in a small dark alley. He takes out
text: his carefully wrapped half joint and lights it. SMOKING, he
text: looks at the sunlit slant of street beyond the alley.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET. A FEW MOMENTS LATER
text: Terry, fairly well stoned, walks along Main Street. A skinny
text: man emerges from his hardware store to greet Terry and shake
text: hands. Terry says "Hi," but keeps on walking. He passes some
dialog: other people.
text: He almost runs right into SHERIFF DARRYL, sixteen years fatter
dialog: and grayer.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Whoa there!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Sorry.
text: The Sheriff recognizes Terry and breaks into a big smile.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: God damn! Terry Prescott! How you
dialog: doin'? Gimme a cuddle!
text: The Sheriff gives Terry a big bear hug. Terry is wasted and
text: selfconscious but smiling. He pats the Sheriff's back.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: How you doin', Darryl?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Which way you headed?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I'm just goin' to see Sammy at
dialog: Dawson's...
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Can I walk with you a little?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Sure, yeah --
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: So Sammy says you been out in
dialog: Alaska...?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah, I was workin' out there for a
dialog: little while...
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET. A FEW MOMENTS LATER
text: The Sheriff walks along with Terry. Terry, very self-conscious
text: about smelling like pot, fumbles to light a cigarette. The
text: Sheriff does not seem to notice.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: -- Sammy says she's gettin' postcards
dialog: from all across the country.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah, I've been all over the place...
text: They stop outside Dawson's.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Well, it's good to have you back
dialog: here, I'll tell you that.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Thanks, Darryl. Keep enforcing the
dialog: peace.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Well, that'll be a little harder now
dialog: that you're home, but I'll do what I
dialog: can.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No, man, I'm reformed.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Oh, yeah. Good to see you, kid.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Thanks, Darryl.
text: Darryl walks away. Terry stands outside the restaurant looking
dialog: for Sammy.
text: Behind him in the restaurant Sammy is sitting at a table,
text: talking to the waitress.
text: She sees Terry and gets up immediately, smiling like crazy
text: as she threads her way through the tables toward the door.
text: Terry turns and sees her. He breaks into a big smile, tosses
text: his cigarette and goes into the restaurant. Through the window
text: we see them make their way toward each other.
text: Sammy throws her arms around him. He hugs her back with a
text: big involuntary smile as the GLASS DOOR slowly CLOSES.
scene_heading: INT. DAWSON'S -- AT THEIR TABLE. A FEW MOMENTS LATER
text: Terry is studying the menu, over-intently. Sammy is beaming
text: at him.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Sorry about yesterday --
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I don't care --
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I was studying the bus description...
dialog: and I just... I got on the wrong bus --
dialog: I mean I missed my stop --
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I don't care, Terry. I'm just so
dialog: glad to see you...!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I'm glad to see you too, Sammy. Um...
dialog: are you coming from work?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Um, no, it's Saturday...
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah, no, it's just... you're dressed
dialog: so formally...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Oh. No. You know, I just thought I'd --
dialog: You know I thought it was a special
dialog: occasion... which it is...
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No, it's good. I thought I'd dress
dialog: up too.
text: He gestures to his shitty clothes.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: That's OK. You look fine.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (A strange,
dialog: unsuccessful joke)
dialog: Yeah, this is the haute cuisine of
text: garments.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Nothing, nothing... Um... So how are
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: How's Rudy?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: We're fine, Terry. How are you?
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: I mean --
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: -- Where have you been lately, Terry?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: -- I know, I haven't been --
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I got a postcard from you from
dialog: Alaska...?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah, I was up there for a while...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: But that was in the Fall, Terry...
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah, I know I've been out of touch...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I was a little worried.
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: I mean --
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Oh, I been a lotta different places...
dialog: Um... I went down to Florida for a
dialog: while... I was doing some work in
dialog: Orlando... I've been all over the
dialog: place.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Well... I just wish you would have
dialog: let me know you were OK...
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah. I didn't realize it'd been so
dialog: long...
text: He looks around the restaurant.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: (Beaming again)
dialog: Are you gonna stay in town for a
dialog: while?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well, I don't know... I got all these
dialog: things I gotta do back in Worcester...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: ...Yeah, so I'm probably not gonna
dialog: be able to stay more than a day or
dialog: so...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Oh... Well... That's all right...!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: ...I'm kind of trying to keep to a
dialog: schedule of sorts. It's a long and
dialog: worthy story but I won't trouble you
dialog: with it right now.
text: He twists around and looks all over the restaurant. She
text: watches him.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Are you expecting someone?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Who would I be expecting here?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: You just keep looking around, that's
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No, I was just wondering if we could
dialog: get some more refreshments, actually.
text: He laughs. Looks down. Silence. He looks up at her.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I've actually got to confess to you,
dialog: Sammy... that the reason you may not
dialog: have heard from me for a little while
dialog: is that I've been kind of unable to
dialog: write... on account of the fact that
dialog: I was in jail for a little while.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: You were what?
text: A couple of people in the restaurant look at them. Terry
text: notices but Sammy does not.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well, I did a little time, I guess,
dialog: in Florida. For, uh, just for
dialog: bullshit...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: It was just bullshit...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: What did you do?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I didn't do anything. Does it occur
dialog: to you that maybe I was wronged?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well, could I please --
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Oh my God! --
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Would you please let me --
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: -- What happened?!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I got into a fight in a bar down in
dialog: Florida. Which I was not the one who
dialog: instigated it, at all. But they worked
dialog: up all this bullshit against me and
dialog: they threw me in the pen for three
dialog: months. I didn't write you because I
dialog: didn't want you to get all upset
dialog: about it. I just figured you'd figure
dialog: I was on the road for a little while.
dialog: I know it was stupid and I'm sorry.
dialog: I really didn't mean to make you
dialog: worry. But you know what? I can't
dialog: run around all the time doin' stuff
dialog: or not doin' stuff because it's gonna
dialog: make you worry! Because then I come
dialog: back here, and I tell you about my
dialog: fuckin'... traumas, and I get this
dialog: wounded little "I've Let You Down"
dialog: bullshit, over and over again, and
dialog: it really just -- cramps me! Like I
dialog: just want to get out from under it!...
dialog: And here I am back in this fuckin'
dialog: hole explaining myself to you again!
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: OK -- Can you please stop cursing at
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I mean, I realize I'm in no position
dialog: to, uh, basically say anything, ever --
dialog: But it's not like I'm down there in
dialog: some redneck bar in Florida having
dialog: an argument with some stripper's
dialog: boyfriend and I suddenly think, "Hey!
dialog: Maybe this'd be a good time to really
dialog: stick it to Sammy and get myself
dialog: locked up for a few months."
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Me too, man. I mean "welcome home."
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Hey -- You don't write me for six
dialog: months, I have no idea where you are --
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I'm sorry --
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: -- I don't know if you're alive or
dialog: dead --
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I'm sorry --
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: -- and then you show up out of nowhere
dialog: and tell me you were in jail?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
dialog: Sammy, I'm really sorry...!
text: The patrons are all either looking at them or trying not to
text: look. Silence.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Sammy...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Um... I'm in the midst of a slight
dialog: predicament...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: What do you need? Money?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Um... Yeah... I'm broke. I gotta get
dialog: back to Worcester tomorrow. I got
dialog: this girl there, and she's kind of
dialog: in a bad situation...? I just need
dialog: to borrow some money. Whatever you
dialog: can spare.
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: I'll pay you back... I'll pay you
dialog: back, man.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I really wish Mom was here.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: So do I, man.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Nobody knows what to do with you.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I know how they feel, man.
text: Silence, except for the sounds of the restaurant.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Terry? Can I ask you something?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: (With some difficulty)
dialog: Well -- I mean, do you ever go to
dialog: church anymore?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Come on, Sammy, can we not talk about
dialog: that shit?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Um -- No, Sammy. I don't.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Can you tell me why not?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Um, yeah. Because I think it's
dialog: ridiculous.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Well -- can you tell me without like,
dialog: denigrating what I believe in?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Because I think it's primitive, OK?
dialog: I think it's a fairy tale.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Well -- I mean, have you ever
dialog: considered that maybe that's part of
dialog: what's making things so difficult
dialog: for you?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: -- That you've lost hold of -- well,
dialog: not just your religious feeling, but
dialog: lost hold of any kind of anchor, any
dialog: kind of trust in anything... I mean
dialog: no wonder you drift around so much.
dialog: What could ever stop you? How would
dialog: you ever know if you had found the
dialog: right thing?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well, uh, I'm not really looking for
dialog: anything, man. I'm just, like, trying
dialog: to get on with it.
text: The WAITRESS approaches with their salads.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Here we go...
text: She sets them down on the table.
dialog: SAMMY and TERRY Thank you.
text: The WAITRESS leaves. Silence. Terry picks at his salad. Sammy
text: doesn't touch hers. She watches him miserably.
scene_heading: EXT. BANK -- ATM. DAY
text: Terry watches while Sammy inserts her card in the ATM and
text: punches in her code. Terry waits. She punches in $300. The
text: machine grinds out her cash. She gives him the money.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Thank you, Sammy... I'm really gonna
dialog: pay this back.
text: She takes her card back and puts it back in her wallet.
scene_heading: INT. SAMMY'S CAR. DAY
text: Sammy and Terry get in the car. Sammy isn't saying anything.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Where we going?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: To pick up Rudy.
text: She puts on her glasses and her seat belt. She won't look at
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well... do you not even want me to
dialog: visit now? 'Cause I can catch the
dialog: bus at five o'clock if that's what
dialog: you want.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Well, of course I want you to visit,
dialog: you idiot! I've been looking forward
dialog: to seeing you more than anything!
dialog: I've been telling everyone I know
dialog: that you were coming home! I cleaned
dialog: the whole fucking house so it would
dialog: look nice for you! I thought you
dialog: were gonna stay for at least a few
dialog: days! It didn't occur to me that you
dialog: were just broke again. I wish you
dialog: would have just sent me an invoice!
text: She stops. Terry is now totally contrite.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT
text: Terry sits in the tub. Water drips from the faucet. He is
text: staring blankly up at the pristine blue-and-white tiled wall
text: and the neatly folded matching towels.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. LATER
text: Sammy and Rudy are in the living room. Rudy is playing with
text: a Game Boy type game. In the b.g., TERRY is dialing the PHONE.
text: He looks clean and shaved, his hair is neatly combed.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (Into phone)
dialog: Hi, is that Malcolm?... Hi, this is
dialog: Terry Prescott?... I been trying to
dialog: get ahold of Sheila and there's no
dialog: answer, and I was just wondering if
dialog: she -- She what?...
text: He sits down.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (Into phone)
dialog: When?... Well -- Is she all right?...
dialog: Well, could I talk to her?... Well,
dialog: could you give her a message that I --
text: CLICK. He is hung up on. He slowly HANGS UP.
text: Sammy notices that something's wrong. He looks at her from
text: across the room.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: That girl I'm with tried to kill
dialog: herself.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: She tried to kill herself.
scene_heading: INT. TERRY'S ROOM. NIGHT
text: Terry is sitting on the bed, addressing an envelope to SHEILA.
text: He puts the $300 in the ENVELOPE and seals it. He sees Sammy
text: standing in the doorway. He starts to unlace his boots.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Do you have everything you need?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I think so.
text: Sammy comes into the room and sits next to him. He is very
text: busy with his laces.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I don't know. Send the money I guess.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Maybe you should stay home for a
dialog: little while, Terry.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah, maybe that'd be a good idea.
text: He starts crying. Sammy pats him.
scene_heading: EXT. SCOTTSVILLE CHURCH. DAY
text: A bright, clear, blue-skied Sunday morning in Scottsville.
text: Inside the little white church they're singing.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH. DAY
text: People are filing out of the church. We also see a couple of
dialog: the bank employees, including BRIAN and his very pretty six
text: months' PREGNANT wife, NANCY. We find SAMMY and RUDY. Sammy
text: is chatting to some neighbors. Rudy is bored out of his mind,
text: waiting for her.
scene_heading: INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM. DAY
text: Terry is lying on the sofa, smoking, with his feet up and
text: boots on, watching Sunday morning TV. On the coffee table

scene_heading: EXT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. NIGHT
text: Crickets buzz loudly outside the house.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRS. NIGHT
text: Sammy, in her bathrobe, comes down the stairs into the living

text: barely looks up when she speaks to him.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I'm going to bed. Do you have
dialog: everything you need?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah. Thanks.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Good night.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Good night.
text: Pause.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Terry, I'm really glad you're home.
text: Terry tries to smile at her.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah, me too, Sammy.
text: He goes back to his game. She hesitates, then heads back up
text: the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. SAMMY'S KITCHEN. DAY
text: Sammy, Terry and Rudy sit at the kitchen table. Sammy is
text: dressed for work. Rudy is dressed for school. Terry is also
text: fully dressed, drinking the last dregs of a mug of coffee.
text: He is tired, but listening to Sammy very carefully, as if
dialog: receiving difficult and critical instructions.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: OK. So we'll drop Rudy off at the
dialog: bus, then all you have to do is drop
dialog: me off at the bank, and just pick
dialog: Rudy up at 3:30 in front of town
text: hall, and drive him over to Carol's
dialog: house. And that's it. She's on Harvey
text: Lane, right past where the Dewitts
dialog: used to live.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Rudy knows where she lives.
text: Terry glances at Rudy, then back at Sammy.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: OK.
scene_heading: INT. BANK -- MABEL'S DESK. DAY
text: Sammy walks past MABEL'S DESK, carrying a big stack of files.
text: She drops three of them on the desk. MABEL is typing away at
text: her PC. The colors are a garish PURPLE background with GREEN
dialog: letters.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: God, Mabel, don't those colors hurt
dialog: your eyes?
speaker_heading: MABEL
dialog: Oh no, they keep me fresh.
text: Sammy proceeds down the hall and into --
scene_heading: INT. BRIAN'S OFFICE. DAY
text: Brian is at his desk, busy working between stacks of papers.
text: She knocks on the open door.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah!
dialog: (Looks up)
dialog: Hi, Sammy. What can I do for you?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Um, Brian? Did you want us to turn
dialog: this time sheet in at the end of the
dialog: day, or do you want it at the end of
dialog: the week...?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Oh, yeah, end of the day'll be fine.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Seems like an awful lot of extra
dialog: paperwork...
text: Brian hesitates, shrugs and smiles.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I like paperwork.
text: Sammy looks at him with a blank smile.
scene_heading: INT. BANK -- SAMMY'S DESK. A MOMENT LATER
text: Sammy sits down at her desk and notices the time: 3:30. She
text: reaches for the phone, then decides not to call.
scene_heading: EXT. SCOTTSVILLE -- MAIN STREET. DAY
text: The CLOCK on the front of the TOWN HALL reads 3:31.
text: The SCHOOL BUS pulls up across from the town hall and
text: disgorges a handful of kids. Rudy comes out with his knapsack,
text: looking around...
text: POV RUDY: Terry, across the street, sits on the hood of
text: Sammy's car, smoking.
text: Rudy walks over to him.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You showed up.
speaker_heading: TERRY
text: Looks that way.
scene_heading: INT. SAMMY'S CAR (MOVING). DAY
text: Terry and Rudy drive in silence. Terry glances at Rudy.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Put on your seat belt.
speaker_heading: RUDY
text: It pushes on my neck.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RUDY
text: It pushes on my neck. It's
text: uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well, when somebody slams into us
dialog: and you go sailin' through the
dialog: windshield, that's liable to be
dialog: uncomfortable too. So put on your
text: seat belt.
text: Rudy puts on his seat belt.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Mom's parents died in a car accident.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I know. They're my parents too.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: They are?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well, yeah. Your mom is my sister.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Yeah, I know.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: So that means we have the same
dialog: parents.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Oh yeah.
text: They drive in silence for a moment. Terry glances down at
dialog: Rudy.
scene_heading: INT. BANK -- SAMMY'S DESK. DAY
text: Sammy, laden with files, plops down at her desk as Mabel is
text: passing by. Mabel puts a phone message down in front of her.
speaker_heading: MABEL
dialog: Um -- Carol just called. She said
dialog: Terry and Rudy never showed up at
dialog: her house?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: You've got to be kidding me.
text: A MOMENT LATER: Brian, talking to an employee, sees Sammy,
text: across the bank, hurrying out the employees' exit.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Hey, Sammy?
text: Sammy doesn't hear and exits.
scene_heading: EXT. ORRIN'S BACKYARD. DAY
text: Terry and Rudy are banging nails with RAY, a young guy Terry's
text: age. Terry, hammering with swift, accurate blows, glances up
text: and watches Rudy for a second. Rudy is hammering away with
dialog: no great skill.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Hey. Look.
text: He moves Rudy's hand down toward the end of the handle.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You hold it further down, you're
dialog: gonna get a lot more power. You should
dialog: be able to put that nail down with
dialog: two or three hits. Look:
text: With two swift strokes he drives the nail flush into the
dialog: wood.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Try it.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: That's not the way I hold it.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well, the way you hold it is wrong.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Why can't I just do it my own way?
text: Terry looks at him unsympathetically for a moment.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (Shrugs)
dialog: You can.
text: He goes back to work. Rudy resumes hammering. After a moment
text: he switches his grip and starts hammering Terry's way. Terry
text: looks up and watches him.
scene_heading: EXT. IN FRONT OF ORRIN'S HOUSE. A MOMENT LATER
text: Sammy pulls up, fast, and gets out of the car. Hearing the
text: hammering from the backyard, she walks quickly around the
text: side of the house and stops short when she sees Rudy hammering
dialog: happily away with Terry and Ray.
text: She watches them working, unobserved, with mixed annoyance
text: and relief, and finally with quiet pleasure, because it's a
dialog: very cheerful sight.
scene_heading: INT. BANK. DAY
text: Half the staff has gone home. Sammy, in her coat, picks a
text: NOTE up off her CHAIR. It reads:
dialog: "SAMMY, PLEASE SEE ME A.S.A.P!!! -- BRIAN"
scene_heading: INT. BRIAN'S OFFICE. A MOMENT LATER
text: Sammy stands in front of Brian's desk.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Brian? Did you want to see me?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah. I was kind of wondering what
dialog: happened to you today.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Oh -- Didn't Mabel -- I had a false
dialog: alarm about my son...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah, I kind of thought you were
dialog: gonna work that out.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Well, I did work it out -- more or
dialog: less --
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Then why're you running outta here
dialog: in the middle of the day without a
dialog: word of explanation to me, Sammy?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Brian, don't yell at me.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I'm -- I'm not yelling. I'm just
dialog: gettin' a little frustrated here.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Well Brian:
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Sorry, could you close the door
dialog: please?
text: Sammy closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM. NIGHT
text: Sammy, Terry and Rudy sit at dinner. The atmosphere is lively
dialog: and cheerful.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: ...And Eddy Dwyer lives in Buffalo,
dialog: with his wife and two sons, if you
dialog: can believe it.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: That is depressing.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: He just never struck me as the
dialog: marrying type, that's all.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Who are you talking about?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Wild kids we used to know.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Were you a wild kid?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Not compared to your Mom.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Yeah, right.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You don't believe me?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Ask her.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Mom, were you?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: No comment.

scene_heading: INT. RUDY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
text: Rudy is asleep in bed.
scene_heading: INT. BAR. NIGHT
text: Terry sits at the bar, drinking beer. There are a few locals
text: in the place, but it's pretty dead. He looks around; his
text: energy is too restless for the near-empty bar.
scene_heading: INT. RUDY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
text: The DOOR OPENS, and TERRY COMES IN, smoking a cigarette.
text: He's plastered. He looks around the room. Looks at Rudy's
text: toys. Picks up some superhero comics and sits on Rudy's bed.
text: Then he spies Rudy's COMPOSITION BOOK, picks it up and starts
text: reading it.
speaker_heading: RUDY (O.C.)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Terry looks up. Rudy is half-sitting up in bed.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Oh -- Just readin' some of your
dialog: compositions.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Why are you smoking?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Um... Because it's bad. Don't ever
dialog: do it.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I won't.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You know this used to be my room?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: Do you want it back?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No.
text: Rudy is very relieved. Terry keeps reading. Rudy watches
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Did you fight in Vietnam?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No. I wasn't even born yet.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Were you ever in the army?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: My father was in the army.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I know. Unfortunately he didn't fight
dialog: in Vietnam either.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Were you friends with him?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Not really. We had some friends in
dialog: common, I guess... I didn't like him
dialog: very much.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well, he wasn't very likable.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I don't know. He was always -- He
dialog: always had to be better than you at
dialog: everything. You know. Like if you
dialog: were all playing basketball or
dialog: something, everybody's havin' like a
dialog: friendly game and he's like ready to
dialog: kill somebody if his team didn't
dialog: win. Or like if you told like a joke
dialog: or a story, he always had to tell a
dialog: better one? Kinda gets annoying after
dialog: a while. Plus it was pretty scummy
dialog: how he split on your mom and you...
dialog: He was a prick. Probably still a
dialog: prick. Fortunately for you though,
dialog: your mom is like, the greatest. So
dialog: you had some bad luck and you had
dialog: some good luck.
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: You mind if I ask you a personal
dialog: question?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Do you like it here? I mean, in
dialog: Scottsville?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Yeah...?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I don't know. My friends are here...
dialog: I like the scenery... I don't know.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I know, I know, but it's so... There's
dialog: nothing to do here.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Yes there is.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No there isn't, man! It's narrow.
text: It's dull. It's a dull, narrow town
dialog: full of dull, narrow people who don't
dialog: know anything except... what things
dialog: are like right around here. They
dialog: have no perspective whatsoever. No
dialog: scope. They might as well be living
dialog: in the nineteenth century because
dialog: they have no idea what's going on,
dialog: and if you try to tell 'em that,
dialog: they wanna fuckin' kill you.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I don't know...
text: Terry lies on his back and smokes.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You're a good kid.

scene_heading: INT. BANK -- BRIAN'S OFFICE. DAY
text: Sammy listens to Brian.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah. This doesn't apply to you
dialog: directly, Sammy, but I've noticed
dialog: that some of the employees have their
dialog: PC monitors set with all kinds of
dialog: crazy colors... Purple and polka
dialog: dots or what have you. And it's not
dialog: a big deal, but really, this is a
dialog: bank. You know? It's not really
dialog: appropriate. So I'm just asking that
dialog: people stick to a more quote unquote
dialog: normal range of colors in future...
text: Sammy looks at him blankly.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Like I say, it doesn't really apply
dialog: to you.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: No, my computer palette's pretty
dialog: conservative.
scene_heading: INT. BANK -- MABEL'S DESK. DAY
text: Mabel is typing angrily at a GRAY SCREEN with BLACK LETTERS.

speaker_heading: BOB

dialog: Sammy LAUGHS.
scene_heading: INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE -- DOWNSTAIRS HALL. NIGHT
text: Terry is holding a broom looking up at the ceiling. Sammy
text: passes by and stops.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: What's up?
text: Terry taps the broom handle against the ceiling.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Do you know you have an enormous
dialog: leak from the upstairs hall?
text: He pokes again. A portion of the ceiling collapses on his
text: head in wet chunks of plaster and muck.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Um, yeah, thanks, I did.
scene_heading: INT. SAMMY'S ROOM. NIGHT
text: Sammy, in front of the mirror, finishes dolling herself up
text: for her date. O.C. we hear loud banging. Sammy puts on her
text: earrings and goes into --
scene_heading: INT. HALL. CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Are you guys sure you're gonna be
dialog: OK?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yes. Yes.
text: Sammy approaches RUDY and TERRY. They are bent over a big
text: nasty trench in the floorboard. There are wood shavings and
text: greasy pipe segments all over, and black smeary smudges on
text: the walls nearby.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: What is happening here?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: It's just -- The problem is that the
dialog: pipe is corroded all the way along
dialog: the length of the hall. So every
dialog: time I put in a new piece it starts
text: leaking further down.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Why don't I just call the plumber?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Why? He's not gonna do anything
dialog: different than what I'm doing.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: (Happily)
dialog: Yeah. We're making it worse!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No we're not. Shut up.
text: Terry yanks the wrench and a SPRAY of FILTHY WATER comes out
text: of the pipe and splatters the wallpaper and pictures and
text: Sammy with gritty gray water. She looks at them.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Thank you. Thank you both.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT
text: Bob and Sammy -- cleaned up and wearing a different outfit --
text: are bustling out the front door. Terry stands by.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Now, call if there's any problem,
dialog: and if I'm not there, I'm either on
dialog: my way or on my way back home.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: OK.
text: Sammy gets into her coat. Bob opens the front door.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: (To TERRY)
dialog: So lights out at ten... and don't
dialog: spend the whole night watching TV.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Nice to meet you, Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You too.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (To SAMMY)
dialog: What's your idea of the whole night?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Two hours tops.
text: Bob holds the door for Sammy and smiles at her. There is
dialog: some confusion about who should go out first. Finally she
text: goes and Bob follows. The atmosphere between them is fairly
dialog: awkward.
scene_heading: INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. NIGHT
text: Terry and Rudy are watching TV from the sofa.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What's your feeling about Bob?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I don't really know him that well.
text: Terry looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I have bad news for you.
text: He picks up the remote...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: No...!
text: ...and turns off the TV. They sit there in the sudden silence.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Great. What are we supposed to do
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Do you know how to play pool?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I've played it.
scene_heading: EXT. THE WILD MOOSE. NIGHT
text: The Wild Moose is a noisy roadside bar sitting under the
text: stars. Terry and Rudy get out of the car. Rudy looks
text: apprehensive.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I don't think they let kids in there.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well, we're not allowed to watch any
dialog: more TV, so it's this or nothing...
dialog: But if we run into any trouble, let
dialog: me do the talking.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: OK.
text: Terry swings the door open.
scene_heading: INT. THE WILD MOOSE. NIGHT
text: POV RUDY: A lot of men and women at the bar or in booths,
text: eating and drinking. Smoky, crowded and very loud. As he
text: follows Terry through the crowd various patrons notice him --
text: some of the looks are friendly, some blank, some cold, i.e.,
dialog: what's a kid doing in here?
text: AT THE POOL TABLE: Terry and Rudy stand side by side facing
text: the players and waiting players gathered around the table.
text: Terry waves a few bills.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I got a hundred bucks here says me
dialog: and my nephew can beat anybody in
dialog: here. Only we gotta get the next
dialog: game 'cause he's gotta be in bed by
dialog: ten o'clock.
text: A MOMENT LATER: RUDY, very nervous, and the 1st Pool Player
text: are side by side shooting for break. Terry is behind Rudy
dialog: coaching him.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Just hit it nice and soft... Nice
dialog: and soft.
text: They hit the balls. Rudy just clips his ball and it doesn't
dialog: go anywhere. 1st Pool Player's ball hits the opposite bank
text: and comes almost all the way back.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: (To TERRY)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: God damn, Rudy. I thought you said
dialog: you could play.
text: Rudy doesn't answer. Terry winks at him.
text: A MOMENT LATER: 1ST POOL PLAYER BREAKS -- WHACK! -- The balls
text: scatter. Nothing drops. TERRY steps up to the table, chalking
text: up his cue.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Boys, it's all over but the cryin'.
text: QUICK CUTS: Of Terry running the table and everyone watching.
dialog: Three-ball in the side. One-ball in the corner. Nine-ball
text: off three cushions and into the corner, and the eleven-ball
text: into the side. Rudy watches him.
scene_heading: INT. BOB'S APARTMENT. NIGHT
text: Bob and Sammy sit at Bob's dining room table. The little
text: bachelor apartment looks pretty good. Tablecloth, candles,
text: wine, everything. Bob has just dropped a huge bombshell.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Bob... Are you serious?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I... I don't know what to say. I --
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I mean, I know I haven't exactly
dialog: been the most... decisive... guy. In
dialog: the past... I don't know: I'm tired
dialog: of foolin' around. And I love you.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I... I'm totally... I don't know
dialog: what to say.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, you could always say "Yes."
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: Or you could think about it first.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: That's it: I want to think about it.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: OK... Fair enough.
scene_heading: INT. WILD MOOSE. NIGHT
text: Terry has sunk everything but the eight ball. He leans over
text: to sink it. It's a fairly easy shot. He lines it up carefully,
text: and deliberately shoots it so it stops two inches from the
text: corner pocket.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Ohhhh!
text: A FEW MOMENTS LATER: Terry and Rudy sit side by side watching
text: as the 2nd Pool Player passes back and forth between them
text: and the camera, running the table. "Oohs" and "All rights"
text: emit from the spectators.
text: Sudden silence. Then the clack of the balls connecting. A
text: great common GROAN goes up. RUDY looks up at Terry.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: It's all yours, baby.
text: Rudy looks at the TABLE: The eight-ball is two inches off
text: the corner. The cue ball is a few inches away from it. A
text: piece of cake, for an adult. Rudy looks deeply unconfident.
text: He gets up and tries to line up the eight-ball. Terry is
text: right next to him.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Just make sure to hit it really
dialog: gentle. But firm. And hit it a little
dialog: low so you get some backspin. Don't
dialog: even hit it. Just kiss it.
text: A long moment.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: What do you mean, kiss it?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I mean tap it. Firm but very, very
dialog: softly. And don't shoot until you
dialog: know it's going in. OK?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: OK.
text: Everyone is relatively quiet. Rudy takes a few practice
text: strokes and then hits the cue ball, straight, but too softly.
text: It crawls toward the eight and taps it toward the corner,
text: slower and slower, hangs there, and DROPS.
text: A GENERAL "HEYYY!" GOES UP and everyone claps and cheers.
text: Terry grabs Rudy. Rudy smiles, ecstatic.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: That was great!
text: AT THE BAR: Darryl the SHERIFF, in his civvies, drinking a
text: pint of beer, notices Rudy and Terry.
text: AT THE POOL TABLE: Terry picks Rudy up and turns him upside
text: down. Rudy laughs.
scene_heading: EXT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. NIGHT
text: The house is dark. Terry and Rudy are walking from the car
text: to the house.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: We creamed those guys! We creamed
dialog: them!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (Stopping suddenly)
dialog: Ssh...! Don't move.
text: They listen. A CAR is COMING.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: It's them!
text: They break for the door, Terry fumbling for his key. He gets
text: the door open.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Go! Go! Go!
text: He and Rudy run inside the house. The lights go on. BOB'S
text: CAR pulls into the DRIVEWAY.
scene_heading: INT. THE HOUSE -- FRONT DOOR. SIMULTANEOUS
text: Rudy runs up the stairs.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Wait a minute, gimme your jacket!
text: Rudy tries to take his jacket off fast but gets his arm caught
text: in the sleeve. He tries to shake it off.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I can't get my sleeve out...!
text: They HEAR Bob's CAR DOORS SLAM. Terry makes a comic panicked
text: face and leaps up the stairs two at a time.
text: OUTSIDE THE HOUSE: Sammy waves to Bob. Bob waves back as he
text: drives off. Sammy goes to the front door, opens it:
text: Terry and Rudy are in a giggly tangled panicked heap at the
text: top of the stairs, shaking Rudy's arm and sleeve, frantically
text: trying to get the jacket off.
text: Sammy comes in. They freeze.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: What is going on in here?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Um -- We were just out doing some
dialog: star-gazing, and, uh, Rudy lost track
dialog: of the time. Which I totally warned
text: him about.
dialog: (To Rudy)
dialog: You are a bad kid.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM. LATER
text: Rudy is brushing his teeth. Terry pokes his head in.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (In a low voice)
dialog: Hey: I think it's OK. Just don't
dialog: tell her where we went, 'cause she'll
dialog: be really mad at me. OK?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I won't.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (Suddenly dark)
dialog: Hey -- I'm not kidding, Rudy.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I won't!
text: Terry gives him a "You better not" look, then leaves. Rudy
text: continues brushing his teeth.
scene_heading: INT. RUDY'S ROOM. NIGHT
text: Sammy is tucking Rudy in, stroking his hair.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Did you know my Mommy used to take
dialog: me and Uncle Terry out at night to
dialog: look at the constellations?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Did you see that one, what's the one --
dialog: It looks like a big "W"? Cassiopeia?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT
text: Sammy comes out of Rudy's room, smiling. It's dark. She sees
text: a LIGHT on under TERRY'S DOOR. She walks toward it and steps
text: into the TRENCH, falling down violently.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Ow! Shit!
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT
text: Terry is putting a butterfly Band-Aid on Sammy's wound. It's
text: a nasty, bloody gash, just shy of needing stitches.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I've got a great idea. Why don't you
dialog: let me call the plumber?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Do whatever you want.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Oh, does that make you mad?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No...
scene_heading: INT. SAMMY'S ROOM. NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. TERRY'S WINDOW. NIGHT
text: Terry is smoking pot with his head and shoulders stuck outside

text: Early morning. The RAIN is still falling. Only a few cars
text: are in the employee parking lot yet.
scene_heading: INT. BANK -- BRIAN'S OFFICE. DAY
text: The RAIN runs down Brian's office window. BRIAN, in a wet
text: raincoat, turns on his light.
text: A MOMENT LATER: Brian turns on his PC. The SCREEN lights up.
text: The COLORS are a garish GREEN and ORANGE.
text: CUT TO:
text: LATER: SAMMY and BRIAN are both on their feet. The door is
dialog: closed.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Brian, get off my ass!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I didn't change the colors on your
dialog: stupid computer screen.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well, that's all you gotta say!
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: (On "that's")
dialog: There is nothing wrong with the work
dialog: I do here. I have been doing just
dialog: fine, the whole time before you came
dialog: here -- And if you think that riding
dialog: people in this petty, ridiculous way
dialog: is the way to improve service in
dialog: this bank or anywhere else I think
dialog: you're out of your mind!
text: Pause.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I didn't say there was. Could I please --
dialog: Could I please -- May I respond?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: No, that's really all I have to --
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: May I respond?
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: First of all, I don't appreciate
dialog: being spoken to with that kind of
dialog: language. That's not the way I talk
dialog: to you, and I'd appreciate it if you
dialog: wouldn't talk that way to me --
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Well --
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Second of all, if you say you didn't
dialog: change the colors on my computer
dialog: screen, then of course I accept your
dialog: answer. But you and I are gonna have
dialog: to find a way to work together --
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Brian --
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: But that's not gonna happen with the
dialog: attitude, it's not gonna happen with
dialog: the lateness, it's not gonna happen
dialog: by fighting me every step of the way --
dialog: OK, well not you, you're not late,
dialog: but too much of that stuff goes on
dialog: around here --
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I am not late and I do not have an
dialog: attitude -- Well then don't tell me
dialog: I'm late if I'm not late!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I'd really like to finish!
text: OUTSIDE BRIAN'S OFFICE: The whole staff is listening to the
text: muffled raised VOICES from inside the office.
text: MABEL especially is listening guiltily.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY
text: The rain falls on Main Street.
scene_heading: EXT. ORRIN'S BACKYARD. DAY
text: The rain comes down hard on Orrin's construction project.

scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- LUNCH PLACE. DAY
text: The rain comes down on the SHERIFF, looking through the
text: restaurant WINDOW at SAMMY, eating lunch alone at the counter.
text: He goes inside, shakes the rain off himself and goes over to
text: her. They start talking. We HEAR:
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: They were where?
scene_heading: INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM. DAY
text: The RAIN on the roof makes a sleepy, pleasant country sound.
text: TERRY is lying on the sofa, smoking a joint, watching TV, in
text: a funk. O.C. we LOUD BANGING ON THE PIPES.
text: LATER: A YOUNG PLUMBER, about Terry's age, comes thumping
text: down the stairs and goes into the living room, carrying his
text: toolbox. Terry looks up at him.
speaker_heading: PLUMBER
dialog: OK, you're all set.
text: Terry glares at him. The plumber turns and goes out.
scene_heading: EXT. BUS STOP. DAY
text: RUDY is WAITING in a doorway for Terry. He is wet and cold.
text: The RAIN pours down.
scene_heading: INT. BANK. DAY
text: Brian is showing his wife, NANCY, the bank. He is very
text: solicitous of her, nervously introducing her to the employees,
text: who are not responding very warmly. Nancy is not in a warm
text: mood either; she's very testy with Brian.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: This is Chuck. Chuck, this is my
dialog: wife, Nancy.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Nice to meet you.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: This is Mabel...
speaker_heading: MABEL
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Nice to meet you.
text: SAMMY, at her desk, watches Brian and Nancy make their
text: progress through the bank. Nobody is being very friendly,
text: and Brian suddenly seems awkward and vulnerable. Brian and
text: Nancy reach Sammy's desk.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: This is Sammy, our lending officer.
dialog: Sammy, this is my wife, Nancy.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: (Friendly)
dialog: Hi. It's nice to meet you.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Brian -- I gotta sit down.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Sure -- Let's go in my office.
text: He glances nervously at Sammy as he leads Nancy away from
text: her desk and toward his office. He murmurs something to Nancy,
text: who responds in a low but very testy voice:
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I'm fine...!
text: She roughly pulls her arm away from his. Sammy watches them
text: go into his office.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: RUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Mom!

dialog: Rudy!
text: Rudy is at the end of the hall, drenched and shivering, but
dialog: cheerful.
scene_heading: EXT. EMPLOYEE PARKING LOT. DAY
text: Rudy is in the car, somewhat dried off, waiting. Sammy and
text: Terry stand in the employee entrance doorway.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Look, I'm glad you guys are getting
dialog: along so well -- like, you have no
dialog: idea -- but if I can't rely on you
dialog: to remember to get him once a day...
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You can!
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: -- And what are you doing taking him
dialog: to play pool in the middle of the
dialog: night, and then telling him to lie
dialog: to me about it?
text: Pause.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I don't know.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. SAMMY'S CAR/CAROL'S DRIVEWAY. DAY
text: Terry and Rudy pull up in front of the driveway. Terry is in
text: a silent rage. The rain has let up.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Get out of the car.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: What are we doing?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You're going to Carol's house and
dialog: I'm going home.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Why can't I come with you?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Because if you're such a baby you
dialog: gotta tell your Mommy about us playin'
dialog: pool when I totally asked you not
dialog: to, and I gotta listen to her shit
dialog: all day, then you're goin' to the
dialog: baby-sitter's so you can stay at the
dialog: baby house.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: But I didn't tell her!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You know what? Don't even fuckin'
dialog: talk to me.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I didn't!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Just get out of the car.
text: He leans over Rudy roughly and pushes open the door. Rudy
text: gets out of the car and marches down the long driveway. He
text: bursts into tears.
text: Terry watches him go, then drives off.
scene_heading: INT. BANK -- HALL. A FEW MOMENTS LATER
text: Sammy walks through the empty bank hall and into Brian's
text: office. Brian is at his desk.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You're working late.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: How did your wife like the bank?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Oh, fine. She wasn't feeling so great.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: That's too bad.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No -- I don't mean -- She's not ill.
dialog: She's just... I don't know...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Pregnant?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: That's it. She's pregnant.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: It can make you kind of cranky.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah...
text: Pause.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Listen, I'm sorry we've been stepping
dialog: on each other's toes -- I -- I'm not
dialog: actually that bad a guy --
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Yeah, I am too... I know you're not,
dialog: Brian, but you're driving everybody
dialog: crazy.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well, I -- I'm just trying to do my
dialog: best here -- And I'm gettin' it from
dialog: all sides.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I know you are...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Anyway... We'll work it out...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Well... I could use a beer.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I could use a tranquilizer.
scene_heading: INT. PUB. NIGHT
text: Brian and Sammy sit at a table in the corner of the dimly
text: lit pub. It's a medium noisy place with various locals
text: drinking beers and eating hamburgers and chicken dinners.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Last I heard, Rudy's Dad was living
dialog: over in Auburn. But that was last
dialog: year.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Must be so tough raising a kid on
dialog: your own... Although I'm beginning
dialog: to get the idea my wife wouldn't
dialog: mind a crack at it.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Oh... It's just the hormones.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well, no, it isn't. But never mind.
text: The waitress brings them two boilermakers.
dialog: SAMMY and BRIAN Thanks.
text: She leaves. Sammy and Brian pick up their shots.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well, here's to improved employee-
dialog: management relations.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Amen.
text: They click shot glasses and drink.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: You can't judge all of Scottsville
dialog: by the people in that bank, believe
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well -- Let's -- Let's not talk about
text: the bank.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Let's just forget about the bank for
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Good idea.
text: They sip their drinks, smiling. Sammy looks at him
text: appraisingly.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. BRIAN'S CAR/WOODED ROAD. NIGHT
text: Sammy and Brian are making out in the front seat of his car.

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Sammy?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I want you to tell me who changed
text: the colors on my computer screen.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I'll never tell.
text: They start kissing again in the cramped space. Brian bangs
text: his head. They laugh.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAR. CONTINUOUS
text: We pull back and away from the car. The sodden trees spout
text: faucets of water down on the car.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT
text: The kitchen is dark. Sammy comes in, her hair a little wet,
text: and turns on the light. She goes to the telephone.
text: There's a NOTE in Terry's handwriting:
speaker_heading: "BOB CALLED."
speaker_heading: TERRY (O.C.)
dialog: Where were you?
text: Sammy jumps, startled. Terry is in the kitchen doorway.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Nowhere. I had dinner with my boss.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Kind of a late dinner, ain't it?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Yeah. How was Rudy?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Did the plumber come?
speaker_heading: TERRY

speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Terry -- Give me a break!!!

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What's the matter with you?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Nothing. I'm just tired.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You want to smoke some pot?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: No I don't. Why, you got some?
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH. NIGHT
text: Sammy and Terry stand side by side on the porch, passing a
text: joint back and forth. It has stopped raining but the trees
text: and roof are still dripping. The crickets are chirping loudly.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: So... Bob asked me to marry him.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Wow.
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: Are you going to?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I don't know. If he'd've asked me
dialog: this time last year I would have
dialog: probably said yes. But the minute he
dialog: said it, I don't know, I felt like
dialog: somebody was trying to strangle me.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well... bad sign.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I know.
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: Plus, Terry...
dialog: (Whispers)
dialog: I fucked my boss...!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I know! And his wife is six months
dialog: pregnant.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Jesus Christ, Sammy...!
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I know, I know.
text: He passes her the joint. She declines. He puffs away. The
text: water drips off the porch and the crickets chirp. She puts
text: her head on his shoulder. He puts one arm around her and
text: puffs away with the joint in his free hand.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Terry, I'm sorry I got so mad before.
dialog: I just don't want him, you know --
dialog: terrified of "telling," if there's --
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Uh, well, that's not really his
dialog: problem, Sammy.
text: Sammy straightens up.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Oh really? What's his problem?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: His problem is that he's like totally
dialog: sheltered because you treat him like
dialog: he's three, instead of eight, so
dialog: that's how he behaves.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Oh yeah? And how do you think he
dialog: should behave?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I think he shouldn't have to run and
dialog: tell his Mommy every time he does
dialog: something she might not like, for
dialog: one thing.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Uh huh. And what do you --
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (On "and")
dialog: I mean I took him to play pool! It
dialog: was a little clandestine thing we
dialog: did for fun! It wasn't like a big
dialog: secret, I mean who cares? I was
text: actually trying to be nice to him.
dialog: But he's so freaked out that he
dialog: disobeyed your orders that he has to
dialog: fuckin' squeal on me and I have to
dialog: listen to your fuckin' shit all day
dialog: when I didn't even fuckin' do
dialog: anything!
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: First of all, he didn't tell me
dialog: anything: Darryl did. OK? Second of
dialog: all, I don't really give a shit if
dialog: you took him to play pool: I was mad
dialog: at you because you left him standing
text: at the bus stop in the rain. But no,
dialog: I don't want you telling him not to
dialog: squeal, because I don't want him put
dialog: in that position!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (Losing ground)
dialog: Well... that... is a perfect example
dialog: of what I'm talking about.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: You are in idiot.
text: They stand apart now. Silence.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Darryl told you?
speaker_heading: SAMMY

text: taps on it. Brian is at his desk.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Morning.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah, good morning. Could you get
dialog: the door?
text: OUTSIDE THE OFFICE: Sammy shuts the door. MABEL and DORIS,
text: standing near the door, look at each other: i.e., Sammy's in
dialog: trouble again.
text: INSIDE THE OFFICE: Sammy stands by the closed door. Brian
text: comes out around his desk.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Listen -- I just --
text: Brian kisses her. She drops her folders and they make out
text: against the door.
text: OUTSIDE THE OFFICE: The employees click away at their PCs.
text: Mabel exchanges a quiet word with Chuck.
text: INSIDE THE OFFICE: Brian has Sammy pressed against the wall
text: with her skirt hiked up and is trying to get both of their
text: underwear out of the way. It's not so easy in their office
text: clothes. Sammy tears away.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Brian, that's enough.
text: BRIAN falls back, breathless.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: OK. Sorry.
text: He lunges at her again. They kiss some more.
text: OUTSIDE THE OFFICE. A MOMENT LATER: Sammy comes out of the
text: office, more or less composed, carrying her folders. She

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Um... Have you thought at all about
dialog: what I said?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Of course I've been thinking about
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: So... Any decisions? Or -- do you
dialog: still want to think about it some
dialog: more...?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Well -- I mean -- I don't know, Bob.
dialog: I mean, we haven't exactly been going
dialog: steady the last few months, if you
dialog: know what I mean --
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah, no, I know --
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: -- and then we see each other twice
dialog: and you suddenly say you want to get
dialog: married? I mean...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No, you're right, you're right --
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: What are you talking about?
text: Pause.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I don't know... I... Maybe this is...
dialog: Last year I sort of thought you were
dialog: possibly interested in that... idea...
dialog: but I was the one who, you know,
dialog: wasn't "ready" at that point -- So
dialog: that's why I thought things kind of
dialog: slowed down with us...
speaker_heading: SAMMY

speaker_heading: BRIAN

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Look, I know it's probably too late,

speaker_heading: SAMMY

speaker_heading: RUDY

speaker_heading: RUDY

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah, where?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I just have to go to Mabel's house.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: You know what, Rudy? It's personal.
dialog: This is a personal matter that has
dialog: to do with Mabel. I just have to go
dialog: see her for a little while.
text: Terry gives Sammy a look like, "You've got to be kidding."

text: She goes out.
text: LATER. Terry and Rudy sit in front of the TV, alone.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Listen. Listen. I'm sorry I said you
dialog: squealed on me. I was totally out of

speaker_heading: RON
dialog: (Gently)
dialog: What's on your mind, Sammy?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Well, a lot. But principally... I

dialog: opinion. If you know someone, in
dialog: your family, or just someone you
dialog: really care about, and they just

speaker_heading: RUDY

speaker_heading: TERRY

scene_heading: INT./EXT. FRONT DOOR. DAY

scene_heading: INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM. DAY
text: Terry, Sammy and RON sit in the living room. Sammy and Ron

text: glimpses of Rudy playing basketball in the backyard. There
text: is a heavy silence in the room.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well... I'm not really sure why you're
dialog: here, Ron. I mean, I realize I haven't
dialog: exactly been a model citizen since I
dialog: got here, but compared to how things
dialog: have been goin' for me lately, I
dialog: thought I was doing pretty well.
text: He turns to Sammy.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: And I also find it kind of
dialog: discouraging that you seem to think
dialog: I need some kind of spiritual
dialog: counseling or what have you, so much
dialog: so that you're willing to disregard
dialog: the fact that I don't believe in any
dialog: of this stuff at all --
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Well... I didn't mean to discourage
dialog: you --
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I mean it's really kind of insulting.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Can I say something here?
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: Sammy asked me to come and talk to
dialog: you, because it's her opinion that
dialog: you're not gonna find what you're
dialog: looking for the way you're looking
dialog: for it --
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: How would she know?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: But I'm really not here to try to
dialog: get you to do anything, or to believe
dialog: anything. And I'll tell you the same
dialog: thing I told her, which is that as
dialog: far as I'm concerned the only way
dialog: she can help you is by her example --
dialog: by trying to be a model for you, by
dialog: the way she lives her life...
text: Terry smiles.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: And that doesn't mean she's supposed
dialog: to be a saint, either, if that's
dialog: what you're smiling about.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I didn't realize I was smiling.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: You know, Terry, a lot of people
dialog: come to see me with all kinds of
dialog: problems. Drugs, alcohol, marital
dialog: problems, sexual problems, health
dialog: problems --
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Great job you got.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Well... I like it. Because even in
dialog: this little town, I feel like what I
dialog: do is very connected with the real
dialog: center of people's lives. I'm not
dialog: saying I'm always Mr. Effective, but
dialog: I don't feel like my life is off to
dialog: the side of what's important. You
dialog: know? I don't feel my happiness and
dialog: comfort are based on closing my eyes
dialog: to trouble within myself or trouble
dialog: in other people. I don't feel like a
dialog: negligible little scrap, floating
text: around in some kind of empty void,
dialog: with no sense of connectedness to
dialog: anything around me except by virtue
dialog: of whatever little philosophies I
dialog: can scrape together on my own...
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well --
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Can I ask you, Terry: Do you think
dialog: your life is important?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You mean -- Like, me personally, my
dialog: individual life?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well... I'm not sure -- What do you
dialog: mean? It's important to me. I guess.
dialog: And like, to my, you know, the people
dialog: who care about me...
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: But do you think it's important?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I --
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Do you think it's important in the
dialog: scheme of things? Not just because
dialog: it's yours, or because you're
dialog: somebody's brother. Because I don't
dialog: really get the impression that you
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well, I don't think... I don't
dialog: particularly think anybody's life
dialog: has any particular importance besides
dialog: whatever -- you know -- whatever we
dialog: arbitrarily give it. Which is fine.
dialog: I mean we might as well... I think
dialog: I'm as important as anybody else...
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I don't know: A lot of what you're
dialog: saying has a real appeal to me, Ron.
dialog: A lot of the stuff they told us when
dialog: we were kids... But I don't want to
dialog: believe something or not believe it
dialog: because I might feel bad. I want to
dialog: believe it because I think it's true
dialog: or not... I'd like to think that my
dialog: life is important... Or that it's
dialog: connected to something important...
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Well, isn't there any way for you to
dialog: believe that without calling it God,
dialog: or religion, or whatever term it is
dialog: you object to?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yes. I believe that.

speaker_heading: TERRY

speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: TERRY

speaker_heading: RUDY

speaker_heading: TERRY

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (Deadpan)
dialog: I'm not mad at you...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: -- but he didn't do anything to you.
dialog: And you cannot promise a little boy
dialog: that you're gonna --
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (On "boy")
dialog: ...I just, you know, after all that
dialog: religious conversation, I just
dialog: realized it's probably not so good
dialog: for him to be spending so much time
dialog: with someone like me who doesn't
dialog: believe his life is important in the
dialog: scheme of things --
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Would you please...
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I'm serious.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: (Practically choking)
dialog: Listen.
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: I am sure, if you put your mind to
dialog: it, you can think of some other way
dialog: of getting back at me besides this.
dialog: So would you please just give it
dialog: some thought, and take him fishing
dialog: tomorrow?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I would, Sammy, I just don't think
dialog: it'd be good for him.
text: Pause.
speaker_heading: SAMMY

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (Into the phone)
dialog: Hello?
text: SAMMY HANGS UP. Pause. She sweeps the TELEPHONE and ANSWERING
text: MACHINE OFF the nightstand. Pause. She calms down and puts

text: convulsively. She WHACKS IT and it stops.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH. DAY
text: The congregation is coming out of the church and milling
text: around at the steps. SAMMY, with Rudy at her side, is saying

text: BRIAN go down the steps.
text: POV SAMMY: Beyond Brian and Nancy, TERRY pulls up at the
text: curb in her car. He rummages around and produces FISHING
text: RODS which he waves, somewhat sheepishly.
text: REVERSE: At top speed, Rudy runs away from Sammy and the

speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Anyway... I don't know what the
dialog: church's position is on adultery and
dialog: fornication these days, but I felt
dialog: really hypocritical not saying
dialog: anything to you about it before,
dialog: so... What is the official position
dialog: on that stuff these days?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Well... it's a sin.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Good: I think it should be.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: ...but we don't tend to focus on
dialog: that aspect of it, right off the bat --
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Well --
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I think you should.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Well --
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Maybe it was better when you came in
dialog: and they screamed at you for having
dialog: sex with your married boss, and were
dialog: really mean to you, and told you
dialog: what a terrible thing it was. Maybe
dialog: it'd be better if you told me how
dialog: I'm endangering my immortal soul,
dialog: and if I don't quit I'm going to
dialog: burn in hell. Don't you ever think
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Um... No.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Well, it's a lot better than all
dialog: this "Why do you think you're in
dialog: this situation" psychological bullshit
dialog: you hear all the time.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Well... Why do you think you're in
dialog: this situation?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: With which one?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: All of them.
text: Pause.

scene_heading: EXT. STREAM -- BRIDGE. DAY

dialog: Two-thirty.
text: Silence. The birds sing.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Was my father a good fisherman?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah, your father was good at all
dialog: that stuff. He knew everything about
dialog: the woods, everything about fishing,
dialog: everything about hunting and
dialog: everything about cars. If he wasn't
dialog: such a pain in the ass he would've
dialog: been a lot of fun to be around.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Maybe he's nicer now.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I doubt it.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Well, I think he is.
speaker_heading: TERRY

speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Were you ever curious to meet him?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I guess so.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well, he doesn't live very far from
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I thought he lived in Alaska.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No -- I lived in Alaska. Your dad
dialog: lives in Auburn. Far as I know.
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: We could look him up in the phone
dialog: book. Wanna try?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: TERRY

speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: No. I'm not gonna stay long. Bob, I

text: Pause.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I've really thought about it a lot,
dialog: and if you had asked me last year
dialog: I'm sure I would have said yes.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Oh. Thank you.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: But I'm not sure it would have been
dialog: a good idea then either. I'm going
dialog: through a really hard time right now
dialog: and I just think that getting engaged
dialog: to you or anyone would be just about
dialog: the stupidest most self-destructive
dialog: thing I could possibly do.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: And I really think you have to grow
text: up.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, how about we fix up my
dialog: personality some other time?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: OK.

dialog: I really hope we can still be friends.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (Quietly sarcastic)

text: She looks at him miserably.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Bob... This is so crazy... I mean...
dialog: I don't even understand why you... I
dialog: don't even get it.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What do you want me to say? Everything
dialog: you said about me was true, Sammy. I
dialog: was just a big chickenshit jerk, and
dialog: now I'm payin' the price.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Bob...!
text: She goes over to him. He gets up.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Well -- I don't know...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I don't know. Sammy, I love you. I
dialog: wish I could say it in a more
dialog: interesting way. I just -- I love
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Well -- I mean -- I love you too --

speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Oh shit.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I gotta go. I'm sorry --
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Where do you have to go?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: (Off the top of her

dialog: I'm supposed to -- I gotta get Mabel

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: SAMMY

text: She comes into the room and starts walking around briskly
dialog: and nervously.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I mean -- Look, I don't mean to be
dialog: unsympathetic about your domestic
dialog: situation, whatever it is, but I'm
dialog: just beginning to think that if people
dialog: tried a little harder to stick to

speaker_heading: BRIAN

scene_heading: INT. SAMMY'S CAR (MOVING). DAY
text: Terry and Rudy drive along. Terry looks down at Rudy and
text: smiles. Rudy is tense and won't look at him.
text: OVER TERRY AND RUDY'S SHOULDERS as Terry drives slowly past
text: dilapidated little houses in a very depressed residential
text: area. Terry is scanning the house numbers.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Maybe we should call first.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well -- We're right here.
text: He pulls up outside a small, plain, run-down ranch-style
text: house with a lot of junk out front, and gets out of the car.
text: Rudy stays in.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Come on.
text: Rudy gets out of the car and comes around. Terry waits for
text: him, and then they walk up to the front door. The buzzer
text: says "KOLINSKI."
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: There he is.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: His last name is Kolinski?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah. Ring the bell.
text: Rudy pushes the doorbell. They wait. There's some noise inside
text: and some voices. The sound of WALKING.
text: THE DOOR OPENS. JANIE, a tired-looking young woman around
text: Terry's age, opens the door.
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Hi. We're looking for Rudy?
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: Who should I say is calling?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: An old friend.
speaker_heading: RUDY SR. (O.C.)
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: He says an old friend!
speaker_heading: RUDY SR. (O.C.)
dialog: How old is he?
text: RUDY SR. appears behind Janie. He's around thirty, wiry,
text: dressed in jeans and an old shirt. He doesn't look good. He
text: recognizes Terry.
speaker_heading: RUDY SR.
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Hey, Rudy.
text: Rudy Sr. sees Rudy, who is looking up at him. His face falls.
speaker_heading: RUDY SR.
dialog: Hey.
text: Rudy doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (To JANIE)
dialog: Hi, I'm Terry.
speaker_heading: JANIE

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: And this is Rudy.
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: You don't say.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Rudy, meet Rudy.

speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: I'll just be in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Nice to meet you.
text: Janie goes into the kitchen. Rudy Sr. watches her go.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: OK if we come in for a minute?
speaker_heading: RUDY SR.
dialog: What the hell are you doin'?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What do you mean what am I doin' --
text: Rudy Sr. starts walking toward Terry to make him go back out
text: the door.
speaker_heading: RUDY SR.

dialog: please?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well we just wanna --
speaker_heading: RUDY SR.
dialog: Could you step away from the door
dialog: please?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: All right, all right.
text: They all go outside. Rudy Sr. pulls the door closed behind
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: RUDY SR.
dialog: What are you doin' here?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I just wanted the kid to see you --
speaker_heading: RUDY SR.
dialog: Well, now he saw me.
dialog: (He looks at Rudy)
dialog: Now you saw me. OK?
dialog: (To Terry)
dialog: Now would you mind?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Man, you are really --
speaker_heading: RUDY SR.
dialog: Look: I'm tryin' to be polite. So
dialog: would you just take off? It's OK:
dialog: Just take off.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I just wanna --
speaker_heading: RUDY SR.
dialog: Do you know what you're doin'? Just
dialog: get outta here!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You know what, man? You're still a
dialog: fuckin' asshole.
speaker_heading: RUDY SR.
dialog: I'm an asshole? Get outta here!
text: Rudy Sr. shoves Terry. Terry belts him, and suddenly they
text: are throwing wild punches at each other. Rudy goes sprawling
dialog: in the dirt.
text: Terry knocks Rudy Sr. down and starts pummeling him brutally.
text: Janie comes out of the house and jumps on his back, trying
text: to pull him off.
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: Get your fuckin' hands off him...!
text: Terry throws Janie off him, grabs Rudy Sr. again and resumes
text: beating him up. Janie jumps back on top of him.
text: Two neighbors run toward the melee to break it up.
text: CUT TO:
text: A FEW MOMENTS LATER: The cops have arrived. The 1ST COP is
text: talking to Rudy and Janie. The 2ND COP is talking to Terry.
text: Rudy Sr.'s face looks puffy and beaten up. A 3RD COP stands
text: apart with Rudy, who is watching the whole thing. WE CUT
text: rapidly and jerkily through this section:
speaker_heading: 1ST COP
dialog: And you're not the boy's legal
dialog: guardian?
speaker_heading: RUDY SR.
dialog: I don't even know if that's my kid!
speaker_heading: JANIE

dialog: them before...
speaker_heading: RUDY SR.
dialog: I used to know his sister --
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I just came down here to talk to the
dialog: guy and all of a sudden he starts
dialog: shovin' me!
speaker_heading: 2ND COP
dialog: Listen up. Listen up. You're gonna
dialog: have to step back and just calm down --
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (To RUDY SR.)
dialog: You're a lyin' fuckin' piece of shit.
speaker_heading: 2ND COP
dialog: (To TERRY)
dialog: You're gonna have to step back.
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: We have a right to protect ourselves.
dialog: What else do you need to know?
text: A MOMENT LATER: The 2ND COP puts handcuffs on Terry. Rudy
dialog: watches.
speaker_heading: 2ND COP
dialog: Now give me your right hand...
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: This is such bullshit. He started

dialog: me?
speaker_heading: 2ND COP
dialog: Listen up. Now -- Listen up! Stop
dialog: talkin'. Terry, stop talkin'.
text: CUT TO:
text: A MOMENT LATER: As the 3RD COP walks Rudy to one cop car,
text: Rudy watches the 2ND COP guide the HANDCUFFED TERRY into the
dialog: other car.
text: Rudy gets in the back of the car and looks out at RUDY SR.
text: and JANIE talking to the 1ST COP. Rudy Sr. is looking at him
text: over the 1st cop's shoulder.
speaker_heading: 2ND COP
dialog: -- idea where we might be able to
dialog: contact his mother?
speaker_heading: RUDY SR.
dialog: No, because he's not my Goddamn kid.

dialog: I want you to leave.
text: Terry looks at her.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I mean I don't think you should live

speaker_heading: SAMMY

dialog: important person to me. But I'm saying
dialog: that I can't take any more of this --
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well --
speaker_heading: SAMMY

speaker_heading: TERRY

dialog: sense when you get old enough you'll
dialog: get out of here too. Your Mom's gonna
dialog: live in this town for the rest of
dialog: her life, and you know why? Because
dialog: she thinks she has to. Don't ask me
text: why, but that's the truth. She thinks
dialog: there's all these things she has to
dialog: do, but you want to know one thing
dialog: about your Mom? She's a bigger fuck-
dialog: up than I ever was. I mean, I know I
dialog: messed up. You think I enjoy getting
dialog: thrown in jail because I wanted you
dialog: to face that prick your Dad like a
dialog: little man and see what kind of a
dialog: guy he is? I know I got a little
dialog: carried away, and I lost my temper
dialog: just a little bit -- which is not
dialog: the end of the world either, by the
dialog: way, just for future reference --And
dialog: now she's kickin' me out of my own
dialog: house because -- you know, because I
dialog: fucked up a little bit. Which I

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No -- I'm just gonna take off. I'll

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well... I'm sorry you're havin' all

speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: But you made a pretty good speech to
dialog: me yesterday about people sticking
dialog: to their commitments...
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Yeah...?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well... you made a commitment to
dialog: this bank, Sammy. To this job.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I know I'd --
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: And to working things out with this
dialog: tough new son of a bitch boss of
dialog: yours. And whatever might have passed
dialog: between us after hours doesn't mean
dialog: you just walk away from that
dialog: commitment -- yeah, even when you
dialog: have a legitimate family emergency.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I'm really sorry I didn't --
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Which is why I think in the calm
dialog: cold light of day, we should both
dialog: think real hard about whether or not
dialog: you really want to continue on here
dialog: at Merchants National Trust.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: You're not serious.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: ...you're not happy, I'm not happy,

speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: By far the worst.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: ...I don't wanna trade insults with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Well, I don't want to be fired, Brian.
dialog: I've been working here for seven
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well --
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: And if I were you I'd be a little
dialog: nervous about firing an employee I
dialog: just had an affair with. OK?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: That's -- Don't threaten me, Sammy:
dialog: I'm not threatening you. I -- It's
dialog: just an area I think we should
dialog: explore.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: I'm not thr -- You explore it. I'm
dialog: going back to work.
text: She heads for the door, stops.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Oh, and I have to pick up Rudy today
dialog: because there's no one else to do
dialog: it. But I'll find someone as soon as
dialog: I have time.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah. Fine. Why don't you just take
dialog: over the whole bank?
text: Sammy hesitates in the doorway. This thought has never
text: occurred to her before. She goes out.
scene_heading: INT. LUNCH PLACE. DAY
text: THROUGH THE WINDOW we see Sammy and Bob having lunch. Sammy
text: watches him eat, full of mixed feelings about him.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. DAY

speaker_heading: SAMMY

speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Rudy, that's too much.

text: some of the dishes on the table.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: You gotta cut this out!
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: What did I do?
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: You don't know what you're talking
dialog: about! There was nothing else I could
dialog: do! I can't explain it better than
dialog: that, but you can't go on like this
dialog: because you don't know anything about

dialog: doing!
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: (Frightened)
dialog: OK, I'm sorry!
speaker_heading: SAMMY

speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Oh, are you gonna try to see that

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: SAMMY

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Of course you will, Sammy. You never
dialog: have to worry about that.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Please don't go till you know where
dialog: you're going. Please...!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I do know where I'm going. I'm going
dialog: to Worcester and I'm gonna try to
dialog: see that girl. And then depending on
dialog: what happens there, I thought I'd
dialog: try to see if there's any work for
dialog: me out West. And if there is, I'm
dialog: gonna head out there for the summer
dialog: and try to make some money. And if
dialog: there isn't, I'll figure something
dialog: else out. Maybe I'll stay around the
dialog: East. I don't know... I really liked
dialog: it in Alaska. It was really beautiful.
dialog: You just -- It made me feel good.
dialog: And before things got so messed up I
dialog: was doin' pretty well out there.
dialog: Seriously. But I couldn't stay here
dialog: long, Sammy: I don't want to live
dialog: here. But I'm gonna stay in touch.
dialog: And I'll be back. 'Cause I want to
dialog: see you and I want to see Rudy. I'll
dialog: come home for Christmas. How about
dialog: that? We'll have Christmas together.
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: Come on, Sammy. You can trust me...
