scene_heading: EXT. CLINTON CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - DAY
text: It's a summer day. The heat floats above the pavement.

text: The large gates of New York's largest prison open and today's
text: group of newly released emerge.
text: They pass a guard who lifts up a copy of The USA Today to

text: Amongst this group we find a man carrying a small duffel.
dialog: And we know this man. He is Gordon Gekko.
dialog: But he is not as slick as we remember... he doesn't have that
text: gleam in his eyes or that gel in his hair. No, this is a
dialog: very different version of the man we remember... because now
dialog: there's nothing behind those eyes... nothing we can read
dialog: anyway.
text: And he just stands there... coldly watching his recently
text: freed brethren greet their wives and children... reuniting
dialog: with the people who waited for them... the people who love
dialog: them.
text: The cab slowly pulls up and Gordon holds up a finger... wait
text: a minute. He glares over to the entrance of the lot...
text: waiting for his people... but they don't come.
text: And the cab waits... Gordon stands there... in the heat...
text: completely disappointed... and completely alone.

speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And he would take an umbrella with him

speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Are you okay?
text: Zabel doesn't answer... he just nods to the envelope.
speaker_heading: ZABEL
dialog: Open it.
text: He opens the envelope and looks down at the check.
text: $1,450,000. And he can barely contain his excitement.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Thank you.
text: And we get a good look at Jacob now... boyish features that

dialog: He's definitely sexy, definitely cerebral and definitely

speaker_heading: ZABEL
dialog: I'm proud of you, Jacob.
text: And Jacob tries to play it cool as he looks up at the

speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CODY WILLARD (ON TV) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: ... it was right after I ordered lunch

speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)

text: Jacob heads in and takes his seat at his desk. It's larger

text: Fox Business plays on each of the screens that line the space
dialog: ubiquitous. (A note, when possible, business news will be

speaker_heading: WILLY

speaker_heading: AUDRY

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: C'mon Jake, it's embarrassing.
text: Jacob just shrugs...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: The stock goes down, you wear the

text: Audry grins in victory.
text: Willy shakes his head, grabs a marker, scribbles something
text: down on a post-it then places it on his forehead. It reads
dialog: "I bought Toll Brothers at $24" and he has to wear it all
dialog: week.
text: And Jacob laughs... now looking up at the electronic

speaker_heading: QUANT ANALYST

speaker_heading: JACOB

speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND PM
dialog: Don't worry... it's not such a bull

text: The laughter dies down.
scene_heading: DERIVATIVES TRADER
dialog: (turning to Jacob)

speaker_heading: JACOB

speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND PM
speaker_heading: (DISMISSIVE)

speaker_heading: PRIVATE EQUITY CFO

speaker_heading: QUANT ANALYST

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (to Derivatives Trader)
dialog: Why? Why are you so shocked?
text: Offering Jacob a flute...
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND PM

speaker_heading: JACOB

scene_heading: DERIVATIVES TRADER
dialog: I think Goodyear Tire is definitely a

text: Hedge Fund PM checks out the woman.
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND PM
dialog: Totally. And those tires are real.
dialog: Even more confused...
speaker_heading: QUANT ANALYST
dialog: Goodyear? The chart is horrible.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE EQUITY CFO
dialog: Somebody color the quant in here.
text: Hedge Fund PM leans into Quant and explains...
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND PM
dialog: Boeing, ticker BA... Big Ass.
dialog: Goodyear, ticker GT... Great Tits.
speaker_heading: QUANT ANALYST

speaker_heading: QUANT ANALYST (CONT'D)
dialog: You guys were down three points in an

speaker_heading: JACOB

scene_heading: HEDGE FUND PM DERIVATIVES TRADER

speaker_heading: GDFS.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE EQUITY CFO
dialog: What the fuck is that?
dialog: 10.
dialog:

speaker_heading: QUANT ANALYST
dialog: It's an exchange traded fund that

speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND PM

speaker_heading: QUANT ANALYST
dialog: Gold Digger Freak Show.

scene_heading: EXT. LOWER BROADWAY - NIGHT
text: Jacob and Derivatives Trader enjoy the summer night. Out of

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Can I ask you something, Robby?
text: Robby nods.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: What's your number?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You know what I mean. The amount of

dialog: and walk away... if you wanted to.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Do you want to walk away?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Not now. But one day... I don't know.
dialog: When I have a family. It's just so
dialog: consuming... so many marriages get
speaker_heading: FUCKED UP--
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Wall Street divorce lawyers do great
dialog: in any market.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I've thought about it. What I would
dialog: need... to raise a family, live a good
dialog: life, be secure. It's not as much as
dialog: we would think if you move out of New

text: And it dawns on Robby...
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Aha... when did you buy the ring?
text: Jacob smiles at his friend's perception.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Last week.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: So when are you going to ask her?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm going to DC this weekend.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Good. I like her for you. She's one
dialog: of the good ones...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Did you hear what her father said on
dialog: Charlie Rose?
text: Jacob shakes his head.
speaker_heading: ROBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Something about Bear Stearns being the

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Sour grapes.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
text: He's speaking at Columbia on Friday.
dialog: If it's slow enough, a few of us might

dialog: And they continue to walk, until...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Tell me what you hear.
text: Robby slowly nods...
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: I don't think you want to hear it,
dialog: bro. You worship Zabel and it's not
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I don't worship him. He's done a lot
dialog: for me and I've known him a long time.
dialog: But he's been acting strange lately.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Just tell me what you hear.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: That Keller Zabel is holding toxic
dialog: waste they can't find a market for.
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jacob shakes his head...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It's not true. It's rumors. There

dialog: positions...
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Jacob, you know better. You know it
dialog: doesn't matter if they're rumors or
dialog: not.
text: And Robby stops walking.
speaker_heading: ROBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Senior year I couldn't get my mind
dialog: around how all those dot coms with no

dialog: something that made it all clear for
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I don't remember.
text: Turning to Jacob with...
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: "An asset's value can only be priced
dialog: at its perception."
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I said that?
text: Robby confirms... then...
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: So buddy -- it don't matter if the
dialog: rumors are true or not. Because in
dialog: this climate... if they exist at
dialog: all... then most likely...
text: Looking his friend head on...
speaker_heading: ROBBY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JACOB

speaker_heading: DIEGO

speaker_heading: JACOB

speaker_heading: ZABEL

scene_heading: EXT. GRAMERCY PARK - MORNING
text: As they enter through the gates of the park and walk...

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Is everything okay?
text: And Andrew Zabel doesn't seem all there... introspective and
dialog: blank.
speaker_heading: ZABEL
dialog: I remember when the starter gave me
dialog: this bushy hair twelve year old kid
dialog: and I said; "Donny, what the fuck --
dialog: give me a real caddy." And he said;
dialog: "This kid's the best."
speaker_heading: JACOB
speaker_heading: ANDY--
speaker_heading: ZABEL
dialog: And you were. You had the wind down,
dialog: the grade of every green.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: ZABEL
dialog: But you wouldn't shut up about stocks.
dialog: Twelve years old and you blabbed on
dialog: and on about companies and sectors and
dialog: earnings.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Andy, are we going under?
speaker_heading: ZABEL
dialog: What was that piece of shit you loved?
dialog: That airline equipment supplier who

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Flour Controls. Are you okay?
text: Zabel laughs.
speaker_heading: ZABEL
dialog: Flour Controls... what a dog.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Why did you give me that bonus?
text: Zabel stops walking and faces Jacob with...
speaker_heading: ZABEL
dialog: Because I know you, Jacob. And I know
dialog: you've been holding off because you
dialog: didn't think you had enough. We all
dialog: do that... postpone life until we
dialog: believe we have what it takes to
dialog: actually live it.
dialog: 15.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: There isn't a better money-runner on

speaker_heading: ZABEL
dialog: Marry her, Jacob. And have children

dialog: that's what's important.
text: And Jacob L. Moore... looking his boss head on...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Andrew, if there's anyway I can help --
dialog: give back the bonus -- whatever... all
dialog: you have to do is say the word.
text: And Zabel just looks away...
speaker_heading: ZABEL
dialog: There's just so much you don't know,
dialog: Jacob.
scene_heading: INT. KELLER, ZABEL INVESTMENTS/TRADING FLOOR - DAY
text: The normally very loud and frenetic place is very quiet and

speaker_heading: ALEXIS GLICK (ON THE TVS)
text: Rumors of insolvency have hit the

text: And he turns to Audry... helpless and in shock.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Who did this to us?

scene_heading: EXT. MIDTOWN -DAY
text: Furious, Jacob walks down 6th ave with his phone to his ear.

speaker_heading: JACOB

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: We're going to bounce back from this.
dialog: And we're going to find out who spread
dialog: the rumor... and then we're going to

text: He disconnects the call and keeps walking.
text: After a beat, with his anger brewing... Jacob SLAMS his phone

scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Jacob lays on his couch vacantly pondering the ceiling.

speaker_heading: GOVERNOR (FOOTAGE)
dialog: I don't know anything about the

dialog: that what's bringing down the stock at

dialog: this practice of short selling
dialog: American financial institutions then
dialog: floating rumors in order to profit
dialog: from them must be stopped. The uptick
dialog: rule must be reinstated.
text: Jacob glares over to the tv.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR (FOOTAGE) (CONT'D)
dialog: And once again, I will point to
dialog: largely unregulated world of hedge

dialog: Chairman of the SEC...
text: And there's a loud knock on the door. Jacob ignores it.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR (FOOTAGE) (CONT'D)
dialog: And the collapse of this legendary New

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What?
dialog: From the door...
dialog: 17.

speaker_heading: ROBBY
speaker_heading: (SHOUTING)
text: Jacob... answer the door.
text: Jacob gets up, moves slowly and answers the door.
speaker_heading: ROBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: You weren't answering your phone.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It broke.
text: Robby sharply nods.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Dude...
text: He stops short... swallows...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: I just found this out and it hasn't
dialog: hit the press yet.
text: Once again... he stops short and looks away in frustration.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What? Robby, what are you trying to
dialog: say?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
text: Andrew Zabel threw himself in front of
dialog: the subway this morning.
text: Jacob just stands in that doorway. No reaction at all.
text: Absolutely frozen.
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Jacob now stands in the center of his apartment. Completely
text: in shock. As he looks to the plasma... Fox Business on mute.
text: Brian Sullivan reporting under the graphic KZI $19.34... -
dialog: $37.28.
text: He glares at it for a long moment, then... almost calmly
text: picks up a chair and throws it into the tv... which shatters.
text: And Jacob... not sure what to do. Until... he turns and
text: sees... on the dresser... a gorgeous engagement ring sitting
dialog: in an open box... a fuck you ring.
scene_heading: EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY/CAMPUS - DAY
text: As Jacob bounds the steps of the Business School and heads
text: into the old stone building.
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COLUMBIA SCHOOL OF BUSINESS/URIS LECTURE HALL - DAY
text: The lecture hall is packed with wall to wall students. Jacob
text: stands at the back.
text: A PROFESSOR is at the podium.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Our speaker today has quite a
dialog: checkered background in the world of
dialog: finance.
text: Some laughter from the room.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR (CONT'D)
dialog: He graduated from City College in 1966
dialog: and became a securities broker at
dialog: Hudson River Bank then moved on to
dialog: Smith Barney. In 1973 he went out on
dialog: his own to establish a spectacular
dialog: career as a independent trader then an
dialog: active participant in the LBO craze of
dialog: the 1980s.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: In 1988, he was indicted for insider
dialog: trading and then charged with other
dialog: various forms of securities fraud and
dialog: IRS violations. In one of the most
dialog: harshest sentences ever given to a
dialog: white collar criminal... he served
dialog: fourteen years in a maximum security
dialog: prison and he wants me to stress that
dialog: it was not a country club.
text: Again laughter from the floor.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Since his release in 2002, he has
dialog: written and has spoken publicly about
dialog: what he refers to as the current state
dialog: of the world economy. He is not
dialog: allowed to trade on the US exchanges.
dialog: His new book "Moral Hazard! Why Wall
dialog: Street Has Finally Gone Too Far."
dialog: comes out in October.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Please welcome... Gordon Gekko!
text: The room applauds... and out to the podium slowly walks...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
text: No swagger in his step... not in a suit... hair not slicked
dialog: back... but still looks fucking good.
text: As he waits for the applause to wind down... and even a
text: little longer... surveying every corner of the large room...
dialog: commanding its full attention... getting it... holding the
text: silence... until finally... he leans into the mic and says...
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: You're all pretty much fucked.
text: The room breaks into laughter... Gordon smiles and waits for
dialog: it to die down.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: What's not funny is what's happening
dialog: out there. I don't think people get
dialog: it. And I know the financial center
dialog: of the world doesn't get it... which
dialog: happens to be Washington DC now.
text: As he takes to a pace...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: To understand where we are, we need to
dialog: understand how we got here. No good
text: deed goes unpunished, all fires start
dialog: with a well meaning spark and we
dialog: wanted Americans to be able to afford
dialog: homes. Sounds nice enough... lets try
dialog: to get the middle and lower classes
dialog: into homes they can own. So we made
dialog: money cheap and lowered restrictions
dialog: on mortgage lending.
text: As he takes a moment and looks over the room...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: Somebody reminded me the other night
dialog: that I once said "greed is good." I
dialog: swear I don't remember it but it
dialog: sounds like something I would say in
dialog: the Eighties.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: And I was right then. Greed was good.
dialog: America needed greed and risk-taking
dialog: and leverage to get to become the
dialog: superpower we are... or were. And
dialog: capitalism needed greed and risk and
dialog: leverage to become the economic
dialog: platform it has become... but those
dialog: same attributes that got us there are
dialog: now the liabilities that threaten to
dialog: destroy us.
text: Jacob's blackberry vibrates and he checks it. He has a text.
dialog: "KZI!!! -- wtf?"
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: So greed has been redefined. Who
dialog: knows -- maybe it was always like this
dialog: and like everything else in this
dialog: world, it's good and it is evil.
text: Taking a moment to survey the room...
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: Because people -- it's greed that
dialog: caused someone who aspires to own a
dialog: seven-hundred thousand dollar house
dialog: they can't afford, to take on a loan
dialog: they'll never be able to pay back...
dialog: and it's greed that caused their
dialog: mortgage lender to give them that loan
dialog: then sell it right away... and it's
dialog: greed that caused the buyer of that
dialog: loan to slice it into a million little
text: pieces then spit them all over the
dialog: world... and it's greed that caused
dialog: the rating agency to give that toxic
dialog: loan a triple-A rating just because it
dialog: was mixed in with some good loans...
dialog: and it's greed that caused the
dialog: insurance company to insure that loan.
text: Jacob quickly glances down again at his blackberry and checks
dialog: the quote, KZI $14.53.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: They were insuring the end of the
dialog: world; "When the world explodes...
dialog: just find us in the rubble and we'll
dialog: be sure to pay your claim."
text: Drawing in a deep breath...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: CMO's, CLO's, CBO's, CDO's, CDS's,
text: SPE's, ABCP's,SIV's, REMIC's, CMBS's,
dialog: toxic traunches, ninja loans, credit
dialog: default swaps, affinity marketing,
dialog: stapled financing, synthetic
dialog: securitization.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Maybe I was in prison too long but I
dialog: have no idea what half that shit
dialog: means.
text: The room laughs in agreement.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: And I'm considered a pretty smart guy
dialog: when it comes to finance!
text: And Jacob's blackberry vibrates again. This time he removes
text: it from his pocket, doesn't check it and simply turns it off.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: And if I know our central bank --
dialog: which I do -- I predict it's going to
dialog: throw gasoline on this fire with more
dialog: cheap money and federal bailouts and
scene_heading: HEAD-IN-THE-SAND MANIPULATED
dialog: statistics on productivity and
dialog: inflation.
text: And Gordon stops pacing... takes a moment for effect.
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Then sums it all up with...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: So no good deed goes unpunished and
text: all fires start with a well-meaning
dialog: spark and when you take free money and
dialog: no lending standards then add it with
dialog: unaccountable risk and ungodly
dialog: leverage and unbridled greed... what
dialog: you end up with is cancer.
text: And Gordon takes in a deep breath...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
text: Systemic, malignant and global.
text: Now the room is completely silent.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: Do they still have the V&amp;T restaurant
dialog: on Amsterdam? Is that still there?
text: A stunned girl in the front row shakes her head.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: God, I loved their pizza.
scene_heading: INT. URIS HALLWAY - DAY
text: Jacob looks on as Gordon is surrounded by professors and
dialog: students alike...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: (announcing to the throng)
dialog: I'll give you six minutes then I
dialog: really have to go.
scene_heading: EXT. URIS HALL - EXACTLY 6 MINUTES LATER
text: Gordon quickly walks out with his PUBLISHER, a woman in her
text: 40s and heads into the quad. Jacob immediately matches their
dialog: stride.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Mr. Gekko, can I speak to you for a
dialog: moment?
text: As he keeps walking...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: You're too late, Sport... Q&amp;A's over.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: My name is Jacob Moore and I'm dating
dialog: your daughter.
speaker_heading: (AND THEN)
dialog: I'm going to ask her to marry me.
text: And this makes Gordon stop and finally face Jacob with...
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: I'll give you nine minutes.
scene_heading: EXT. 112TH STREET - MOMENTS LATER
text: As Gordon and Jacob leave the campus and take to the street.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Keller, Zabel? Then you have my
dialog: apologies.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Stock's in a free fall. My guess is
dialog: that it just lost its Bar Mitzvah...
text: Jacob quickly takes out his blackberry, turns it on and
text: checks to see Gordon's right... KZI... $12.54.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: By the end of the day it might not
dialog: even be potty trained.
text: And Jacob looks at him.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: I might not be allowed to trade, Jake,
dialog: but I still love to watch from home.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Andrew Zabel took me under his wing
dialog: when I was in high school. He
dialog: basically got me my scholarship to
dialog: Yale then hired me right out of
dialog: business school.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Andrew's smart, he beats the
dialog: benchmarks consistently. He'll land
text: on his feet.
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: He's dead.
text: And Gordon stops walking and regards Jacob. Who confirms...
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: He killed himself this morning.
dialog: As that registers...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: I'm sorry to hear that.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: He was a father to me.
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: And Jacob coldly shakes it off then sucks in a deep breath
text: and looks into Gordon's eyes... genuine and lofty...
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: I love your daughter very much and I
dialog: would be honored if...
text: And realizing what this is... Gordon starts to laugh... which
text: throws Jacob off.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: ... you would bless-- I really don't
dialog: understand what you find so funny.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: My daughter hasn't spoken to me for
dialog: eleven years and you know it. She
dialog: blames me for her brother's overdose
dialog: and every other disaster that's fallen
dialog: upon the world since the mid-nineties.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: And by the way, isn't it strange that
dialog: Winnie would date a guy from the
dialog: street?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: She hates me. And she hates Wall
dialog: Street and everything it represents...
dialog: so don't you find it curious that she
dialog: would fall in love with you?
text: And that slams into Jacob... who's frozen for a beat.
text: Jacob finally snaps out of it then joins Gordon.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: So you want my blessing?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: I guess I should know a little about
dialog: you first. Where did you grow up?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Matinecock.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: I'm impressed.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It wasn't like that. I mean we didn't
dialog: have much money. My mother was a
dialog: tailor.
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: And your father... what did he do?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Disappear.
text: And Gordon regards Jacob for a long moment, taking him in,
dialog: until...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Clever.
text: Jacob looks down the street.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you looking for?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Your town car.
text: With a laugh...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Well, pal...
text: As Gordon pats Jacob on the back...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: ... then you're going to be looking
dialog: for quite awhile.
text: ... and heads for the subway.
scene_heading: INT. 110TH STREET SUBWAY STATION - DAY
text: Gordon takes out his wallet and produces his metrocard.
text: Jacob notices a picture of Winnie in the wallet.
speaker_heading: JACOB
speaker_heading: (RE PICTURE)
dialog: Can I see that?
text: Gordon shrugs and shows the picture to Jacob.
text: It's of a young Winnie and younger Gordon on the back of a
text: gorgeous white horse.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: She was eight in that one. It was
dialog: taken in Egypt.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Can I... have it?
speaker_heading: (EXPLAINING)
dialog: She doesn't keep pictures from her
dialog: childhood.
text: Gordon slowly nods.
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: What do I get in return?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You... wanna make a trade?
dialog: And Gordon thinks about, then...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Yes. I'll give you this picture and
dialog: in return... I'd like a picture of
dialog: Winnie... taken recently... without
dialog: you in it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I don't have one on me.
text: Gordon sighs, takes the picture out of his wallet and hands
dialog: it to Jacob.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Then I'll give you this one on margin.
speaker_heading: PLATFORM
text: As they wait for the train...
text: Jacob produces the ring box and opens it to show Gordon the
dialog: ring.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I really did come to ask for your
dialog: blessing.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: No, you didn't. Nice ring...
text: As the train arrives...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: It's so typical.
dialog: (inside of an ironic laugh)
text: Levered to the hilt... and with the
dialog: ship going down...
text: As he gets on...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: ... they still gave you a bonus.
scene_heading: INT. THE DOWNTOWN 3 TRAIN - DAY
text: Gordon stares at a one sheet advertisement on the wall.
text: And he doesn't look at Jacob when he says...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Don't play me, Jake. You don't think
dialog: I can see it in your eyes? You don't
dialog: think I know that look?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: I know it by sight, Kid... because I
dialog: lived it for years. Christ, I can
dialog: even smell it on you.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Smell what on me?
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Revenge.
text: Jacob just looks away.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: Some hedgehog said bad things about
dialog: your company. It caused the stock to
dialog: plummet and made those bad things
dialog: become true.
text: And Jacob now sees the poster that has Gordon's attention.
text: It features a pile of money being blown out the window under
dialog: the caption that reads... "If this looks familiar to you...
dialog: it's because you're renting!"
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: The man you loved like a father threw
text: himself in front of the uptown five
dialog: this morning and you want to bring
dialog: that hedgehog to their knees.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You knew he was dead?
dialog: "Guardian Mortgage... Low down payments... Adjustable rates."
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Like I said -- I still love to watch
dialog: from home.
text: And now Gordon turns to face Jacob with...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: So don't insult me by pretending to
dialog: ask for Winnifred's hand when what you
dialog: really want to know is who to bring
dialog: down to their knees and how to do it.
text: And Jacob swallows that back... doesn't argue it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I know who.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It was either Nassim Tariq from the
dialog: Frontier Fund, Bretton Woods from
dialog: Locust or Karen Molina from ESL.
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Does Winnie even know you came to see
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Well, not exactly.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: But I'm going to tell her.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Not such a grand idea, Pal.
dialog: Off Jacob's confusion...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: See, I have a feeling you're going to
dialog: want to see me again. And if you tell
dialog: her we had this little pow-wow...
dialog: she's not going to let that happen.
text: As Jacob considers that... the train slows to a stop.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, you seem like a smart kid.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Walk away, dust off your resume and
dialog: get another job...
text: As he steals one last glance at that Guardian Mortgage ad...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: ... but do it quick.
text: And with that, Gordon moves for the doors.
text: But Jacob steps in front of him.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm going to bring them down. Whoever
dialog: floated the rumor for a quick buck.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: It's not worth it. It's a waste of
dialog: energy and time. See, Jacob, nobody
dialog: gets it... they never did.
text: As the subway doors open...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: If there's one thing I learned in
dialog: prison it's that money is not the
dialog: prime commodity in our lives... time
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: And your nine minutes are up.
text: And Gordon Gekko gets off the subway... leaving Jacob on the
text: train. But right before the doors close, Gordon stops and
dialog: turns with...
dialog: 28.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: There are worse ways to go than
text: jumping in front of a train. For
dialog: instance, could you imagine taking
dialog: something for your diabetes...
text: As the doors close...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: .. and end up having it cause you to
dialog: die of acute pancreatitis?
text: And as the subway pulls out of the station, Jacob Moore just
text: stands there... holding the pole and wondering what the hell
dialog: that was supposed to mean.
scene_heading: EXT. ANDREW ZABEL'S MATINECOCK, LONG ISLAND HOME - DAY
text: A Victorian Estate on a bluff. Zabel's funeral in progress.
text: Hundreds of people made it out from the city. All types.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Andrew didn't have children, so he
dialog: made all you -- all of us -- his
dialog: children.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: And to list Andrew Zabel's many
dialog: accomplishments would take me far too
dialog: long to enumerate, but if you just
dialog: look around you, you'll see those
dialog: accomplishments in the faces of the
dialog: many people gathered here today.
text: And we pan the procession of mourners... past...
speaker_heading: PRIEST (CONT'D)
dialog: The alumni of the Morris High School

speaker_heading: PRIEST (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: PRIEST (CONT'D)
dialog: Those who were left behind... those
dialog: who were overlooked... those who
dialog: otherwise would never have stood a

dialog: 29.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: And we land on Jacob L. Moore...
speaker_heading: PRIEST (CONT'D)(O.S)
dialog: Above being just a great financial
dialog: mind... or a great husband...
text: He wears a dark suit... and a blank expression...
speaker_heading: PRIEST (CONT'D) (O.S.)
dialog: ... or a great father... or a great

text: ... with nothing but cold retribution in his eyes.
speaker_heading: PRIEST (CONT'D) (O.S.)
dialog: ... Andrew Zabel was a great man.
scene_heading: INT. POOL HOUSE - DAY
text: Most of the guests across the pool eat and quietly mill about.
dialog: We're with Jacob, Willy, Audry and another trader named
speaker_heading: DANIEL.
speaker_heading: AUDRY
dialog: Two dollars a share?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: The Fed didn't give us a choice.
text: Jacob walks around the room... taking in the pictures of
dialog: Andrew Zabel's life...
speaker_heading: AUDRY
dialog: Does that include the building?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What about the Zabel's institutional
dialog: managed fund? How much is in that?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Eight billion.
speaker_heading: AUDRY
dialog: And that's all intact.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Jesus, United Bancorp made out like a
dialog: bandit.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: We could've handled it at $60 a share
dialog: or even $50.
text: He just shakes his head...
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: It was that fucking rumor. It was so
dialog: well timed. And the market doesn't

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: My mother was a tailor.
text: They all look at him.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Out of our house less than five miles
dialog: from here.
speaker_heading: AUDRY
dialog: You're from Matinecock? I thought you

dialog: Jacob confirms...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: We weren't rich. Everyone else was.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: She altered their clothes and I
dialog: carried their golf clubs.
text: And Jacob looks at a picture of Andrew Zabel one more time...
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: He gave me a seat at the table.
dialog: ... and goes.
scene_heading: EXT. ANDREW ZABEL'S HOME - DAY
text: Jacob heads for the main house. He sees BARBARA ZABEL,
text: Andrew's wife, sitting next to the some friends.
text: Jacob slowly walks over and when she sees him... she
text: stands... wobbly and full of tears.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Jacob...
text: Jacob takes her into his embrace...
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)
dialog: (through her sobs)
dialog: You were a son to him...
text: Squeezing her tight... fighting back a rush of emotion.
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I was a fucked up kid, I was angry, my
dialog: mother couldn't control me. He was
dialog: the only one who cared. I wouldn't be
dialog: anywhere right now if it wasn't for...
text: And Jacob Moore stops short... finally breaking down...
text: allowing his own tears to stream down his face.
text: He pulls away...
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: If you need anything.
text: She nods.
text: And Jacob moves away from the people and moves across the
text: lawn. But he stops when he sees a woman standing across the
dialog: way... we've seen pictures of her.
text: She's in her late-twenties with a natural beauty that might
text: take two glances to notice. But after that second glance...
text: it's unforgettable. She's WINNIE GEKKO.
text: As she rushes to him...
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: Jacob, I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Why didn't you tell me?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Lehigh had the committee hearings and
dialog: I knew he would need you and I didn't
dialog: WANT TO--
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: That's not how this works.
text: And she looks into his eyes.
speaker_heading: WINNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Jacob, that's not how this works.
text: He nods. Regards her for a beat, then...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Will you marry me?
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I got a ring. Not on me, but--
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: Are you proposing to me at a funeral?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 32.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: And then...
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: I had a whole thing I was going to do

speaker_heading: WINNIE

speaker_heading: WINNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes... I'll marry you, Jacob.

speaker_heading: JACOB

speaker_heading: WINNIE

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: Jacob I don't care about what ring you
dialog: give me. You know that.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: We're not taking it back. I worked

text: She regards him... he's serious.
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 33.
dialog: 
dialog:

text: Then Jacob pulls her into his kiss... it's almost violent.
text: She's taken off guard.

scene_heading: INT. KELLER, ZABEL INVESTMENTS/TRADING FLOOR - DAY

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Hey Audry.
text: She looks up.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: AUDRY

speaker_heading: AUDRY

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Is anyone riding on something in phase

speaker_heading: AUDRY
dialog: Few midcaps maybe. You want me to

text: He nods. She turns on her computer and takes a seat.
speaker_heading: AUDRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, this takes me back to when I had a

text: He stands over her shoulder.
speaker_heading: AUDRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, Amlyn pharmaceuticals has Byetta
text: going in front of the FDA next month.
dialog: I remember this...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDRY (CONT'D)
dialog: they pulled it during phase two
dialog: because some of the test subjects died
dialog: but they've obviously solved those
dialog: problems now.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: How did they die?
speaker_heading: AUDRY
dialog: I don't remember.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Pancreatitis?
speaker_heading: AUDRY
dialog: Yeah. That was it.
text: Jacob shakes his head...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: How did he know?
speaker_heading: AUDRY
dialog: Who?
dialog: Without answering her...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Can you look up large institutional

speaker_heading: AUDRY
dialog: Mutual or hedge?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Hedge.
speaker_heading: AUDRY
dialog: Locust Fund owns a shitload.

speaker_heading: AUDRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Bretton Woods.

speaker_heading: JACOB

scene_heading: EXT. 15 CENTRAL PARK WEST - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. 15 CENTRAL PARK WEST/ PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: A BUTLER lets Jacob in. Jacob takes in the massive space
text: with an insane view of Central Park. He can hear a beautiful
text: sonata playing in the next room.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm here to see Bretton Woods.
text: The butler nods then leads Jacob through the full floor unit
dialog: and into the...
speaker_heading: PARLOR
dialog: 40.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A huge chandelier hangs over the all marble room. A
text: fireplace on one wall and a twelve foot wall of glass
text: featuring that park view on the other.
text: And Jacob realizes that sonata is live. He's walked into a
text: recital of some sort.
text: About twenty people sit watching a YOUNG GIRL play on a very
text: unique looking silver grand piano.
text: The girl can't be a day over thirteen. She's playing
text: Mozart's "Ronda Alla Turca"... her fingers gliding across the
text: keyboard in precision, her eyes closed in inspiration. It's
text: as spectacular as it is moving.
text: Jacob takes it in for a moment then looks over the room. All
dialog: ethnicities and types...
text: The AFRICAN LEADER in full tribal gear, the DISHEVELED ARTIST
text: with his GAY NOVELIST LOVER, the NEW YORK KNICK with his
text: MODEL WIFE, the MOVIE STAR with her TEENAGE SON.
text: And BRETTON WOODS...
text: Mid 40s, slicing jawline, deep set eyes, in great shape,
text: refined, composed and masculine.
text: He's the owner of this penthouse and he's looking right at
text: Jacob. Jacob looks away.
text: And the young girl finishes the last movement of the sonata
dialog: to applause.
text: The guests all stand, some go talk with the girl. Bretton
text: heads over to Jacob.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: As you can see, I'm having a little
dialog: dinner party here but I thought it was
dialog: important we speak right away.
text: He speaks with a British accent.. Jacob nods.
text: Bretton looks over the room for a moment, scans his guests
text: then back at Jacob...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: Please... if you don't mind waiting in
dialog: my office, I'll be in a minute.
text: And the butler is already at Jacob's side, motioning him to
dialog: follow him.
scene_heading: INT. BRETTON WOODS'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Jacob waits for Bretton. He looks over the place. The view
text: of the park. The classic furniture.
text: AND THE HUGE PAINTING ON THE WALL
dialog: 41.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Of a giant man-like monster eating a much smaller naked

speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (O.S.)

text: As Jacob turns to see Bretton standing in the doorway.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
text: Saturn devouring his son. Francisco

text: Bretton heads in and closes the door behind him.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Do you collect?
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: No.
text: Sitting behind his desk...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: Only the obsessive compulsive or the
dialog: insecure egotistical feel the need to
dialog: collect things.
text: Jacob nods. Bretton just looks at him... making him nervous.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Your daughter's an amazing piano
dialog: player. That was quite a show.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: That wasn't my daughter. That was
dialog: Isabel Patrovsky, she's the world's
dialog: greatest living piano prodigy.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: And that wasn't a show... that was a
dialog: very expensive private recital.
text: There's a long beat of silence with Jacob just looking at
text: Bretton... taking him in.
dialog: And it's unmistakable -- the one thing that this man exudes
text: above all else... is composure.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: You cost my fund three hundred and
dialog: forty million dollars today.
text: Off of Jacob's slight smile...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, kills my year, pushes my

dialog: redemptions.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 42.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I hope you're happy. My fund's in

text: Jacob just shrugs.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't want to deny it?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Who told you?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: A doctor I know.
text: Bretton nods... regards him.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: I checked with all the desks in
dialog: town... you didn't make money off it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Then why did you do it?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You destroyed my firm.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Your firm destroyed itself.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You killed Andrew Zabel.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Andrew Zabel killed himself.
text: And Bretton sighs...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: The rumors were true.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You made them true.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
text: No, Jacob, being levered thirty-eight
dialog: to one in toxic debt made them true.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Institutional money-running was
dialog: Zabel's talent... he didn't have a
dialog: down year in the last twenty.
text: Jacob just glares at him.
dialog: 43.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: His fatal flaw was allowing the
text: children on his mortgage security desk
dialog: to talk him into the deadly game of
dialog: hot potato everybody's been so fond of
dialog: playing recently.
text: And Jacob holds Bretton's look for a moment, then... heads
dialog: for the door without saying a thing...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: Come work for me.
text: Jacob stops and turns...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: I run three billion dollars. Come
dialog: help me run it.
text: And Jacob takes a beat... processing this...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Why me?
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Because your loyalty desired revenge,
dialog: your balls actually attempted it and
dialog: your skills pulled it off.
text: As he stands...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: And as for Andrew Zabel... there
dialog: really is no telling why he did what
dialog: he did.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: As far as I'm concerned, it was just a
dialog: bit of money... and there are surely
dialog: more important things in the world.
text: And Jacob sucks in a deep breath -- containing his anger.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: Now I'm going on Safari with my
dialog: family. Think about the offer and get
dialog: in touch after the July 4th holiday.
text: ... heading for the door...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: You got my attention, Jacob... and
dialog: that's one of the rarest commodities
dialog: out there.
text: And Jacob just regards him, then...
dialog: 44.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You can have my answer now, Bretton...
dialog: I have no interest in working for a
dialog: fund that's in trouble.
text: Bretton smiles...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Touche.
text: Jacob nods... holding Bretton's look. Then...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What's your number?
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: The amount of money you would need to
dialog: be able to walk away from it all and
dialog: just live happily-ever-after.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Everybody has one -- it's an exact
dialog: number -- what's yours?
text: And Bretton takes a moment to think about that, then simply
dialog: says...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: More.
text: ... and disappears into his penthouse.
scene_heading: EXT. 533 THIRD AVENUE - MORNING
text: Jacob heads out of his building to be greeted by...
speaker_heading: DIEGO
dialog: You know what I overheard a guy say
dialog: yesterday?
speaker_heading: JACOB

speaker_heading: DIEGO

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Fifteen minutes she said.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: No, that's not okay. Because it means
dialog: they're crowded so every tier in the
dialog: service chain will be extended. The
dialog: sixteen minutes we would normally wait
dialog: to order will now be twenty six, the
dialog: standard twenty four minutes waiting
dialog: for our food to arrive will turn into
dialog: thirty nine, the eight minutes to get
dialog: the check will become seventeen and
dialog: the four minutes to process the credit
dialog: card will take nine.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I told you I'd have lunch with you...
dialog: not give you a hundred and six minutes
dialog: of my time.

speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's go to Whole Foods.
scene_heading: INT. WHOLE FOODS - DAY
text: Gordon and Jacob share a little table out front of the market.
text: Gordon enjoys a turkey burger from the deli while Jacob doesn't

speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Did you eat before?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Just not hungry.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Yeah... I used to not eat lunch too.
text: Jacob nods and slides something across the table. The

text: Gordon looks at it and laughs.
dialog: 46.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: Fitting.
text: As he places it in his pocket...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: That'll make it a round trade for us.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I actually owe you one now.
dialog: Off Gordon's look...
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: I crushed him.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Did you?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: His fund is bleeding. I wouldn't be
dialog: surprised if the redemptions finish
dialog: the job.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Well, Chief... you seem awfully proud
dialog: of yourself.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: How'd you know about Amlyn?
text: Gordon shrugs.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: It's amazing what information you can
dialog: find out when people know you're not
dialog: going to trade on it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: So, you didn't use me to make a little
dialog: money?
dialog: And never to look up from his lunch...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Naw. I prefer to write about the
dialog: action now than be apart of it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Why'd you give it to me?
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: You're out of a job and most likely
dialog: going to marry my daughter... I
dialog: figured you could use the money.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I didn't make any money off of it.
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: You didn't trade it?
text: With a smile in and over-the-top faux innocence.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: That would've been insider trading,

text: Gordon just shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: And not "most likely."
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Winnie and I are engaged.

scene_heading: EXT. PARK AVENUE - DAY
text: As they walk up Park Avenue...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: So did you take my advice and not tell
dialog: your new fiance about our little
dialog: friendship.
text: Jacob doesn't say anything. And Gordon doesn't press.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: So, I'm guessing she's not going to
dialog: take your last name.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Good guess.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: That's my Winnie. I knew she was a
dialog: feminist when she was five and furious
dialog: that Mrs. Claus didn't get enough
dialog: credit.
dialog: And this makes Jacob smile... then...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: My brother has two daughters. I had
dialog: Winnie and Rudy.
dialog: (sucking in a deep breath)
dialog: And since Rudy... you know... well,
dialog: I've worried about the name. It's
dialog: something you don't really think about
dialog: until you hit sixty or so but it's
dialog: important.
text: As they walk some more in silence, until...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: I want you to get my daughter to
dialog: accept me back into her life again,
dialog: Jacob.
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jacob slowly nods... not surprised.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: Because save for the extremely

text: As Gordon stops in front of a Georgian-style, pre-war
text: building and turns to Jacob...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon, I'll show you some more
dialog: pictures of your fiancee that she

scene_heading: INT. 655 PARK AVENUE/ELEVATOR - DAY
text: Gordon and Jacob get into the elevator, Gordon pushes "4."
text: The doors begin to close but someone gets on at the last

dialog: He's a hedge fund type, real SLICK, reminds us of Gekko
dialog: twenty years ago. Oh... and he's about 29 years old.
speaker_heading: SLICK
dialog: Gordon...
text: Gekko nods. Slick hits his floor... "PH."
speaker_heading: SLICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Sky still falling?
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: You know it.
speaker_heading: SLICK
dialog: (inside of a derisive sigh)
dialog: Sells books I guess.
scene_heading: INT. GEKKO'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - DAY
dialog: No doubt about it, this is a nice place. Worth three million
dialog: dollars, maybe four at the beginning of the year.
text: Sparsely decorated. Large framed photographs line the walls.
text: Gordon shows Jacob pictures of Winnie's childhood.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: She refused to take that cowboy hat
text: off. She actually slept in it.
text: Smitten, Jacob looks at some more of the pictures then
text: stands... taking in the large framed pictures on the wall.
text: As Jacob checks out a framed chart for "Gouda Tulip Bulbs Dec
dialog: 1 1634 to Feb 5 1637." The chart goes straight up and to the

speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Bretton offered to hire me.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO

text: As Jacob moves over to an another piece.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Fuck no.
text: Jacob now finds himself looking at a political cartoon from
dialog: the early 1900s.

speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: JP Morgan... he single-handedly
dialog: stopped the Panic of 1907 by stepping
dialog: in and buying up shares in all the
dialog: companies that were crashing.
dialog: Everyone else quickly followed like
dialog: lemmings.
dialog: (re political cartoon)
dialog: See -- people had stopped looking to
dialog: their government or trusted advisors.
dialog: They looked to JP Morgan. It was all
dialog: about simple psychology -- every crash
dialog: should have a JP Morgan to step in and
dialog: save it.
text: As they walk the hardwood floor...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: See Jacob... the best opportunities
dialog: are found where angels fear to tread.
text: And they arrive at the next piece on the wall... a small
text: framed bond.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: That's a bond issued by the Central
dialog: American country of Poyais. Gregor
dialog: McGregor made a fortune dealing these
dialog: to the British elite in 1820.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: The country didn't exist.
text: And now Jacob notices a very strange picture across the
text: room... he goes over to look at it.
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: It's very old... black and white... of a woman filling her
dialog: stove with money.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: Weimer Republic of Germany 1922.
dialog: Inflation turned to hyper-inflation
dialog: and it was more efficient to burn the
dialog: money for heat than spend it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: That's horrifying.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: I know.
text: As they both hold on the picture...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What caused it?
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: A country in debt... that took on even
dialog: more debt to fund a war... then
dialog: printed mountains of money to avoid a
dialog: depression and other financial
dialog: imbalances...
text: As he turns to face Jacob...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: ... sound familiar?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: And you honestly think this is where
dialog: we're heading?
text: Looking Jacob head on... deadly serious...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: If we don't take our heads out of the
dialog: sand... yes. It's going to get bad
dialog: out there, Champ, I'm not going to
dialog: lie. Even the small regional bank I
dialog: started out at might go under.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Hudson River Bank...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: That's right.
dialog: And then...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: And I've got some news for you... he
dialog: ain't bleeding. He's not even cut.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: What I'm talking about, Jake... is
dialog: that I'd bet dollars to donuts that
text: Bretton Woods unwound most of his
dialog: position in Amlyn last week. That he
dialog: knew about the pancreatitis.
text: Off of Jacob's confusion...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: The only reason you think you hurt him
dialog: is because he wanted you to think
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: How do you know that?
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: I don't. But it's not Bretton's first
dialog: rodeo... and my instincts for this
dialog: sort of thing don't often disappoint.
text: Jacob can't believe it. And with each passing moment of
text: realization... shock turns into rage.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I can't believe it.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Believe it, Princess... he's beating
dialog: your ass all over the court.
text: As Jacob tries to calm himself.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: And you think I should take the job --
dialog: bring him down from the inside?
text: Gordon confirms that with a simple shake of the head and...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: I don't know, Jake... what you kids
dialog: think is pay-back these days is really
dialog: incredible. When I was coming up, we
dialog: slaughtered men.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: There are guys still working at penny
dialog: ante brokerages in the Poughkeepsie's
dialog: of this country because they crossed
dialog: me.
dialog: While Jacob processes that...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: So I'll make you another trade, Jake.
dialog: I'll help you bring him down, if you
dialog: help me get her back.
text: As Jacob just looks away... non committal.
dialog: 52.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: ... then you both can have a father.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK AVENUE - NIGHT
text: As Jacob walks... on the phone with...
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Jacob, I could lose my job.
text: ... who holds his sleeping infant in his hands.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Robby, I need to know. Now nobody
dialog: moves size in this town without using
dialog: your desk.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: We'll play twenty questions only it'll
dialog: be two questions and all you have to
dialog: do is say "yes or no."
text: Capitulating with a sigh...
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Fire away...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Bretton Woods... The Locust Fund...
dialog: did they make any major moves in the
dialog: last few weeks?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Was it unloading Amlyn
dialog: pharmaceuticals?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
speaker_heading: (NERVOUS)
dialog: Jacob...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Robby, I got you the fucking the job!
text: And after a long moment.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Yes.
text: Jacob stops walking... sucks in a deep breath...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm sorry to make you do that.
text: With that, he disconnects and shakes his head in frustration.
text: And after a moment, Jacob sucks in a deep breath then makes
dialog: another call.
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Okay Gordon... you've got yourself a
dialog: trade.
text: AND WERE BACK ON THE CHART
text: As a circle forms on June 19th then travels down the trend

dialog: And as a circle is formed around July 4th, we...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: FIREWORKS
text: Exploding over the Capitol building.
scene_heading: EXT. SENATOR LEHIGH'S GEORGETOWN HOME - NIGHT
text: A BBQ for the political set and their families. Paper plates
text: and plastic cups are being thrown away by HELP Children and
text: parents lay on blankets watching the fireworks.
text: Jacob holds Winnie as they look up at the sky...
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: My parents would always throw this
dialog: huge party in the Hamptons on the
dialog: fourth. The city of South Hampton
dialog: would have its firework show at 8pm
dialog: then my father would wait until it was
dialog: over then put on his... which, of
dialog: course, was always twice as
dialog: spectacular.
text: She leans up, sips her wine, then...
speaker_heading: WINNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Then one year the city passed an
dialog: ordinance that their firework show had
dialog: to be the last of the night... they
dialog: were sick of getting shown up by
dialog: Gordon Gekko.
text: Jacob laughs...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What'd he do?
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: He rented a barge and shot the
text: fireworks off of it a mile off the
dialog: coast... out of jurisdiction.
dialog: (then... almost to herself)
dialog: The show was even more amazing over
dialog: the water.
text: And Jacob looks at her.
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I think he should be invited to the
dialog: wedding.
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Winnie, he's your father...
text: As the fireworks explode into their finale...
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: You don't know him.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I know he's unhappy. Look at him out
dialog: there... trying to scare everybody.
text: He's desperate for attention.
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: This is none of your business.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: "That's not how this works."
dialog: Remember?
text: She just looks away...
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: He's got nothing.
text: The firework show ends and everyone applauds...
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: And that's what he deserves.
text: Suddenly, everyone begins to look over to the house where
dialog: something is happening...
speaker_heading: WINNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: The things that came out after he was
dialog: convicted. The affairs... the things
dialog: he was recorded saying...
text: SECRET SERVICE PERSONNEL, wearing ear pieces, start walking
dialog: the lawn.
speaker_heading: WINNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: This wasn't the man we knew, Jacob.
dialog: It was... sociopathic.
text: She stands up and looks across the lawn to where all the
dialog: action is.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It was a long time ago.
text: He stands and kisses her...
dialog: 55.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Just consider it, okay? That's all
dialog: I'm asking.
text: She holds his look for a long moment, then... nodding over to
dialog: all the excitement...
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: C'mon, you can meet the next President
dialog: of the United States.
scene_heading: INT. THE LOCUST FUND FOYER - DAY
text: A massive foyer of black marble with wall to wall views of
dialog: Manhattan. There's much more space than furniture here.
text: Jacob waits patiently in a white suede chair... he checks his

text: Finally, the SIX FOOT TALL RECEPTIONIST, leaves her desk...
text: her heels clicking as she walks over.
speaker_heading: SIX FOOT
dialog: Jacob... are you ready?
text: Jacob stands and she leads him toward a bank of elevators.
text: The doors open and Jacob gets on.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
text: Jacob stands there with Six Foot.
speaker_heading: SIX FOOT
dialog: Do you have everything they said you'd
dialog: need?
text: Jacob nods... holding a folder of his previous tax forms, his
text: passport and other documents obviously needed for the job.
text: And the elevator doors open... but not to an office...
text: Jacob shields his eyes to the wash of daylight... then looks
text: to realize that he's on the roof of the building.
text: And in front of him is... An Augusta A109E Helicopter with
text: "The Locust Fund" written on the side.
scene_heading: INT. AUGUSTA HELICOPTER - DAY
text: As Jacob looks down to the city below, wondering where the
dialog: hell they're going...
scene_heading: EXT. TETERBORO AIRPORT - DAY
text: Jacob emerges from the Augusta and looks across the tarmac to
text: see a Boeing 727 with "The Locust Fund" written on the side.
dialog: And now Jacob knows why he needed his passport.
dialog: 56.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. CHELSEA - NIGHT
text: The Black Maybach limousine pulls up out front of a 19,000-
text: square-foot Victorian home with the perfectly restored brick
dialog: exterior.
text: As Jacob gets out of the car and sizes down this incredible
dialog: home...
scene_heading: INT. BRETTON WOODS'S CHELSEA HOME/THE BLACK SWAN HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The design is much different that Woods's New York CPW
text: penthouse. It's more classical... with dark woods and worn
text: leathers and thick rugs and commanding views along the River
dialog: Thames.
dialog: And Jacob is lead into the...
speaker_heading: DINING ROOM
text: Where Bretton eats alone at the head of the long table.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Jacob.
text: As Jacob walks through the expansive space...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Mr. Woods.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: (Call me...)
dialog: Bretton.
dialog: ... and sits.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Okay... Bretton. I thought we were
dialog: going to meet in New York.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: And I thought you had no interest in
dialog: working for a fund that was in
dialog: trouble.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I was emotional. I was angry.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: And what changed?
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: I caught a glance of my portfolio.
dialog: 57.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: And Bretton laughs.
text: Jacob notices two huge chocolate brown French Mastiffs
text: sitting at Bretton's feet.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Cute dogs.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Dogue de Bordeaux... bred to kill.
dialog: But Contango and Backwardation here
dialog: are socialized since birth so they're
dialog: harmless.
text: Jacob laughs...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You named your dogs after technical
dialog: futures market terms?
dialog: And Bretton stands...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Of course not...
dialog: (with a wink)
dialog: My children did.
text: As he heads into...
speaker_heading: THE LIVING ROOM
text: A fire burning in the fireplace. Jacob follows Bretton in...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: And where are your children?
text: Bretton moves toward a table with a classic phonograph player
dialog: on it.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Greece with my wife. My boys are
dialog: studying The Iliad now.
text: While Bretton looks through the various sleeves of records,
text: Contango and Backwardation slowly find their way into the
text: room and sit by the fire.
text: Bretton finds what he's looking for... removing the record
dialog: from its sleeve.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: Here it is... one of the most
dialog: beautiful pieces of music you'll ever
dialog: hear.
text: Bretton places the record on the phonograph and The Rolling
text: Stones "Let It Loose" rings out...
dialog: 58.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: "Exile On Main Street," without a
dialog: doubt The Stones greatest album.
text: Jacob laughs. He was expecting Beethoven.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: It was all outtakes. Throwaway
dialog: tracks. And the critics hated it.
dialog: And it didn't sell well at first.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: But now it's universally known as
dialog: their best release. I asked Mick once
dialog: how he thought that happened. How
dialog: something could go from so worthless
dialog: to so valuable. He just looked at me
dialog: and said... "it never went from
dialog: worthless to valuable... just the
dialog: opinions of it did."
dialog: Taking a seat...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: And that was the greatest lesson I
dialog: ever learned about investing.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: An asset's value can only be priced at
dialog: its perception.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
speaker_heading: (IMPRESSED)
dialog: Exactly. There is no intrinsic.
dialog: Then... simply...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll work out of the New York
dialog: office. I wouldn't want to pull you
dialog: away from your fiancee in Washington.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: She's Gordon Gekko's daughter.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: He was a legend at one time. It's
text: quite sad how he publicly cries out
dialog: wolf now.
text: Bretton stands and stretches.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: You see, for a legend...
dialog: 59.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Inside of a tired sigh...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: ... the only thing worse than death is
dialog: becoming irrelevant.
text: And Bretton just sits there... enjoying his scotch while
dialog: taking in the Stones tune...
scene_heading: INT. LONDON/SAVOY HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
text: Jacob stands at the window of his suite... looking out onto
text: the Victoria embankment and on the phone with...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Good work, kid -- you're on the inside
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: He's going to Dubai to raise some
dialog: money then meeting me in New York to
dialog: set me up.
text: Gordon sits at the dining room table at his apartment.
text: Papers scattered about and his EDITOR waiting patiently.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: He's not meeting you in New York.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Because you need to go to Dubai with
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I don't understand.
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON - DAY
text: As the 727 takes off ...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.)
dialog: You need to do something that will
dialog: earn his trust... you need to make
dialog: yourself a hero...
scene_heading: INT. 727 - DAY
text: Jacob sits across from Bretton who enjoys a slice of Pizza
dialog: and a Coke.
dialog: 60.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.)
dialog: Jacob... you need to help him get this
dialog: money.
text: And Jacob glares at Bretton like he might kill him.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: But be cautious. Your relationship
dialog: with Bretton is still fragile -- you
dialog: fuck it up here and you're done.
text: Bretton looks up and Jacob immediately replaces his glare
text: with a smile.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Looks better than meals I get on
dialog: United.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: John's Pizza on Bleeker. It crossed
dialog: the Atlantic with you yesterday.
dialog: Would you like a slice?
text: Jacob declines... then...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: I appreciate you wanting to help with
dialog: this part of the business even though
dialog: it's not your expertise.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Well -- there's a lot I can learn from
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: For this trip just stay in the
dialog: background and observe.
text: As Bretton tosses some pizza to Contango and Backwardation...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: We're going to meet with Oleg Bakunin.
dialog: He's a Russian oligarch on the run
dialog: because Putin wanted to steal
dialog: everything he owns. He already has a
dialog: few hundred million with us but I'm
dialog: looking to get half a billion more.
dialog: Our maintenance fee on that alone
dialog: would be ten million a year.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: My father didn't make half of that in
dialog: his twenty-six year career.
text: And he looks out the window...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: He worked in a mid-level job for
dialog: United Bancorp actually...
dialog: 61.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Never to look from the window... with just a trace of

speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Yes... you have to be kidding me.
text: He disconnects the call with a mischievous smile and turns to
dialog: Jacob.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: Looks like a bit of news broke while
dialog: we were in the air...
text: And Bretton turns on Fox Business to see footage of... The
text: Governor of New York standing at a podium next to his WIFE.
text: He doesn't look happy as he says...
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR (ON THE TV)
dialog: The remorse I feel will always be with

speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS

speaker_heading: GOVERNOR (ON THE TV)
dialog: I have been given much -- the love of
dialog: my family, the faith and trust of the

dialog: lead this state
text: Laughing with delight...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Oh Jacob... you don't want to live in
dialog: a glass house if you're gonna play
dialog: this game.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I don't understand. Is he resigning?
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What'd he do?

speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Outsourced.

scene_heading: INT. BURJ AL ARAB/LOBBY - DAY

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY

scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S SUITE/BATHROOM - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. THE LEFT BANK - NIGHT
text: A Roaring 20's party is taking place... it's full-on

dialog: Russians and Middle-Easterners.
text: Smoke fills the room. A jazz band roars. Drinks flow.
text: As Jacob and Bretton head in...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: If he offers you a drink -- take it.
text: And with that, Bretton points across the room where OLEG
text: BAKUNIN sits.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: If he offers you a line of coke --
dialog: snort it.
text: He's in his mid-40s, overweight, sweaty, draped in tight

dialog: 64.
dialog:

speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: If he offers you a child -- raise it.

text: Oleg sees them, stands and opens his arms.
speaker_heading: OLEG
text: Bretton Woods has arrived.
text: Bretton smiles. They head over. Oleg turns to one of the

speaker_heading: OLEG (CONT'D)
dialog: I want you to meet one of the only men
dialog: in the world who might be as rich as I
dialog: am. Wait a minute... Bretton what did
dialog: oil close at today?
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: A hundred and twenty-nine dollars a

speaker_heading: OLEG

speaker_heading: OLEG (CONT'D)
dialog: Who the fuck is this?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Oleg, I'm Jacob Moore. It's nice to

speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Who the fuck is this?
text: Bretton smiles...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Jacob has recently come over from KZI

speaker_heading: OLEG

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: That's right.

speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: He was a legend.
text: Jacob just nods, not showing any emotion. Oleg motions for

speaker_heading: OLEG (CONT'D)
dialog: It was that mortgage shit. He

text: Bretton just looks away. Jacob stays cool.
speaker_heading: OLEG (CONT'D)
dialog: It was a shame his fund was only for

speaker_heading: OLEG (CONT'D)
dialog: In honor of the theme tonight, have a
dialog: glass of 1927 Heidsiek champagne...
text: Oleg hands Jacob a flute before he can decline.
speaker_heading: OLEG (CONT'D)
dialog: This is one of two hundred bottles
text: discovered on a shipwreck off the
dialog: coast of Finland... thirty grand a
dialog: bottle.
text: And Oleg aggressively puts his arm around Jacob, bringing him
text: into a drunken half-bear hug and spilling most of the
text: champagne out of Jacob's flute.
scene_heading: EXT. DUBAI HARBOR - NIGHT
text: Oleg and some of his crew lead Jacob, Bretton and three
text: beautiful, giggling model girls down a trail to a secluded
text: mooring.
text: Fishing boats bob violently in the water -- and next to them
text: is Oleg's Phoenix 1000, his personal, 65-meter SUBMARINE.
text: As a boatman helps them all climb aboard:
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Phoenix 1000.
scene_heading: INT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT
text: As they walk through the ornate deck saloon:
text: Oleg beckons Jasper toward a huge panoramic window looking
text: out at the city of Dubai.
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: And then the view starts to MOVE. The surface of the water
text: RISES before them, Dubai recedes and the submarine descends
text: spectacularly into the depths.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: 5000 square feet, 30 days of oxygen
dialog: capacity.
scene_heading: INT. THE DECK SALOON - NIGHT
text: Lights illuminate the dark waters as curious fish flit past.
text: Jacob, Bretton and Oleg are on divans, the girls undulating
dialog: around them.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Bretton, I have... what?... two
dialog: hundred million with you.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: And hopefully that's just a start.
dialog: Oleg, there are so many opportunities
dialog: out there right now I feel like a kid
text: in the candy store.
text: Oleg waves him off.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: You know I like to spread it around...
dialog: I'm like my own fund of funds. I
dialog: don't like to have too much with one
dialog: manager.
text: As Oleg shakes cocaine out of an envelope...
speaker_heading: OLEG (CONT'D)
dialog: You never really know who to trust in
dialog: this world.
text: Jacob takes a beat, swallows nervously, then...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I couldn't agree more, Oleg. It's one
dialog: of the first things that Andrew Zabel
dialog: taught me. I worked very closely with
dialog: him. It's why Bretton hired me. To
text: get behind the Andrew Zabel curtain.
text: Bretton flashes Jacob a look... "What the hell are you
text: doing?" Jacob swallows back some nerves then continues...
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: You said before that you always wanted
dialog: to invest with Zabel but couldn't
dialog: because he only handled institutional
dialog: money. Well here's your chance.
dialog: Zabel taught me everything he knew.
text: Oleg looks up to Jacob from the line of coke with interest.
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Such as... ?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Well, I'm not going to give you the
dialog: whole cake, Oleg...
text: He looks over to Bretton who still glares at Jacob...
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: But I can give you a little bite...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: It involves building positions in high
dialog: yielding stocks new to volatility then
dialog: writing calls with split strike
dialog: prices.
text: And Oleg regards Jacob for a long moment, a jury determining
text: the verdict... Jacob holding on to that sly smile... Bretton
text: looking away... playing it cool.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: It's complicated but like Bretton said
dialog: -- right now there are more
dialog: opportunities than ever.
text: Oleg simply nods... with a simple...
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Interesting.
text: ... then does another line.
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S SUITE - NIGHT
text: Jacob sleeps. There's a knock on his door. He stirs. The
text: knock's louder. Then... Jacob finally wakes, moves to the
text: door and opens it to see...
scene_heading: TWO BEAUTIFUL RUSSIAN WOMEN, PAULINA and NADIA
speaker_heading: NADIA
dialog: We're here for the party.
dialog: Confused...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What party?
speaker_heading: PAULINA
dialog: Oleg said you needed a party...
text: Cozying up to her friend with a smile...
speaker_heading: NADIA
dialog: ... and we're it.
text: Jacob nervously thinks, then...
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Come in.
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S SUITE - LATER
text: We pan across the suite... past the roaring fire...
speaker_heading: PAULINA (O.S.)
dialog: Right there... ?
text: ... past the empty bottle of champagne...
speaker_heading: JACOB (O.S.)
dialog: No... not there...
speaker_heading: NADIA (O.S.)
dialog: How about there? I bet you want me to
dialog: do it there.
text: ... past the plate of half-eaten chocolate strawberries...
speaker_heading: JACOB (O.S.)
dialog: No... I want you to hold it.
dialog: And find the three of them...
speaker_heading: NADIA (O.S.)
dialog: But it's gone up so much.
text: ... sitting at Jacob's computer... looking over a chart for a
dialog: Russian oil company.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I know... but if you're going to
dialog: correctly utilize this technical head
dialog: and shoulders strategy, you need to
dialog: hold the stock until...
dialog: (pointing on the chart)
dialog: ... right here.
speaker_heading: PAULINA
dialog: I always sell too soon.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Very common mistake. You need to cut
dialog: your losers short and let your winners
dialog: run.
text: She looks to her friend with a smile...
speaker_heading: NADIA
dialog: Good advice for everything... no?
text: Her friend agrees with a laugh. And Jacob checks the clock.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Okay. I think enough time has passed.
dialog: I appreciate you guys keeping our
dialog: little secret.
dialog: 69.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: As he walks them to the door...
speaker_heading: NADIA
dialog: You must love her very much.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I do.
text: Jacob opens the door to let them go but he hears a door open
text: across the hall... Bretton's.
text: And they all witness a YOUNGER AMERICAN WOMAN leave Bretton's
text: room then head down the hall right by them.
text: Jacob's stunned.
speaker_heading: PAULINA
dialog: The most famous hooker in the world.
dialog: Off Jacob's confusion...
scene_heading: THE YOUNGER AMERICAN WOMAN
text: that had just left Bretton's room looks right at us under the
dialog: caption "The Governor's $5000 Mistake"
dialog: Pull back to be on Perezhilton.com
text: Jacob Moore sits in front of his computer. And he turns to
dialog: Paulina.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Is she a gift from Oleg?
speaker_heading: PAULINA
dialog: No. She's Bretton's go-to.
speaker_heading: NADIA
text: He flies her in wherever he's at.
text: And Jacob slowly takes that in... absolutely floored.
scene_heading: INT. BURJ AL ARAB/LOBBY - MORNING
text: Wearing sunglasses, Jacob greets Bretton at the elevators.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: You look like crap.
text: They walk for the exit.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me ask you something... was that
dialog: speech about split strike prices and
dialog: stocks new to volatility for real?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No Bretton. That was all bullshit.
dialog: 70.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Bretton smiles.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Well, it worked. Oleg's wiring us
dialog: five hundred million dollars today.
text: And Bretton turns to Jacob... impressed.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: Good job, Jacob...
text: And as they head out into the Dubai heat...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.)(PRE-LAP)
dialog: So he trust you now.
scene_heading: EXT. BOWLING GREEN PARK - DAY
text: The iconic charging bull of Wall Street.
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.)
dialog: I think so.
text: Travel the park to find... Jacob and Gordon stopping at the
dialog: food vendors.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Well, I'm happy to help.
speaker_heading: (AND THEN)
dialog: What about your end of the trade,
dialog: Sport?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Oh... I'm still working on it.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I'll talk to her. I promise.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
speaker_heading: (TO VENDOR)
dialog: Hot dog.
speaker_heading: (TO JACOB)
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: JACOB
speaker_heading: (TO VENDOR)
dialog: I'll take a pretzel.
text: As they get their food and walk...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: So you're a hedge fund cowboy now?
text: Shaking his head...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: Goddamn hedge funds -- what a racket.
dialog: Playing the world casino, betting
dialog: other people's money with leverage.
dialog: And it's completely legal and
text: completely unregulated.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 71.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
text: The hustles they get away with make
dialog: insider trading seem like a parking
dialog: ticket.
text: SLAM INTO THE FRONTIER FUND/TRADING PIT
text: Rows and rows of computers in a large dark room....
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Nassim Tariq and his Frontier Fund.
text: With their slews of MIT grads who
dialog: become glorified millionaire robots
dialog: pushing buttons...
text: ... with casually dressed ASIANS and INDIANS in their 20s
text: working the keyboards like zombies.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: ... slaves to top-secret propriety
dialog: elegant algorithms that work until
dialog: they don't.
scene_heading: AND SLAM INTO ESSEX CAPITAL ADVISERS/CONFERENCE ROOM
text: A stuffy conference room half-filled with bored MEN in their
text: 40s watching a presentation...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Or the baby cub funds like Sammy
text: Rosen's Essex Advisers... filled with
dialog: Goldman Sachs and Julian Robertson
dialog: pedigree.
text: Most of the men type on their blackberrys... one is actually
dialog: asleep.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Men who are way too rich, lazy and
dialog: tired to run money properly anymore.
scene_heading: THEN SLAM INTO THE DANIELS ACTIVIST FUND/ALLAN DANIELS'S
speaker_heading: OFFICE
text: A small cluttered office with papers strewn about...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Or Allan Daniel's and his bully
dialog: operation.
text: ALLAN DANIELS, a small bull-dog of a man, paces back and
text: forth... dictating in anger. His SECRETARY types down every
text: word he's shouting.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: ... with his angry letters to company
text: boards that are nothing but veiled
dialog: threats in the name of activism.
text: AND RIGHT BACK TO BOWLING GREEN PARK
text: Where Gordon stops walking...
dialog: 72.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: So you're inside... you have his
dialog: trust... and now you want to know
dialog: what's next.
text: And Jacob's look over to Gekko confirms this.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: Here's the thing about Bretton. He
dialog: puts all of his money into his own
dialog: fund which makes him stupid,
dialog: egotistical, and most importantly...
dialog: vulnerable.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: And he chases. He doesn't take losses
text: well and he chases with leverage. He
dialog: thinks he's a trader, he thinks he's
dialog: an investor but he's not. He's a
dialog: gambler.
dialog: Regarding Jacob...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: That pretzel looks good.
text: Jacob just shrugs.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: Care to make a trade?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Whatever.
dialog: And they trade. The hotdog for the pretzel.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: As for your end of our trade.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Find a way for me to reunite with my
dialog: daughter, Jake. Because we both know
dialog: how she would react to the fact that
dialog: you've been lying to her about bonding
dialog: with your future father-in-law.
dialog: Just standing there... holding that hot dog...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Is that a threat?
text: Looking Jacob dead on...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Absolutely.
text: Jacob just shakes his head with a laugh... now realizing that
dialog: Gekko talked him into this position for this exact leverage.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You're priceless, Gordon.
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: With a smile...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Just be happy I'm on your team.
speaker_heading: (AND THEN)
text: Get him into a bad position and watch
text: him chase it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What bad position?
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: What have I been saying all along,
dialog: Kid?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Financials.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: They're a death trap -- mark my words.
scene_heading: INT. THE LOCUST FUND/JACOB'S OFFICE - DAY
text: As Jacob takes in his new view... it's spectacular.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.)
dialog: But he won't fall for a brokerage or
dialog: bank play this late in the game.
dialog: Everyone knows they're poison.
speaker_heading: AND TIME LAPSE
text: As the office grows furniture... a plasma on the wall...
text: a computer on the desk...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Sell him on insurance. There's a case
dialog: to be made for those stocks... ill-
dialog: fated as they may be.
text: ... books on the shelves... pictures on the walls...
text: a couch and table... a paper shredder and waste baskets...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: But take your time... make him think
dialog: you've been doing your due diligence.
text: Find Jacob at his desk... working away at his computer...
text: it's late at night.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Make it look like you're working your
dialog: ass off to find him this genius
dialog: trade... come in early, leave late and
dialog: don't bring up the idea for at least a
dialog: few weeks.
text: And Jacob finally gets up from his desk... goes to the
text: window... looking across midtown Manhattan...
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And then Jacob...
text: ... eyes pasted on a building made of glass and steel... a
dialog: building he once called home...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: ... sell him hard... then watch him
text: bite... then watch him chase...
dialog: ... KZI Investments.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
text: ... then watch him come undone.
scene_heading: EXT. 533 THIRD AVENUE - DAY
text: Holding his suitcase, Jacob emerges from the elevator and

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Bring it.

speaker_heading: DIEGO
dialog: What's the most dangerous question on

speaker_heading: JACOB

speaker_heading: DIEGO

scene_heading: EXT. WASHINGTON DC - MORNING

scene_heading: EXT. ROCK CREEK PARK - MORNING
text: Winnie and Jacob jog the park through the humid July haze.
dialog: It's very early.
text: And Jacob stops jogging. Catches his breath. She keeps
dialog: running.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Why are you with me?
text: She stops and turns back to him.
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: What?
dialog: 75.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You hate finance. You hate Wall
dialog: Street. Why are you with me?
text: Winnie nods. It's a valid question. And she thinks about it
dialog: for a moment, then...
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: Repetition compulsion.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: It's Freud.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: And what does it mean, psych major?
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: Well, it's when people repeat the same
dialog: dysfunctional relationships from
dialog: childhood in their adult life in hopes
dialog: of trying to master them.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Like when children of alcoholics fall
dialog: in love with alcoholics.
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: Yeah.
text: He turns away... upset.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: That's great, Winnie.
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: Jacob, that might be why I was
dialog: initially attracted to you... but it's
dialog: not why I love you.
text: She moves to him.
speaker_heading: WINNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I love you because you're
dialog: compassionate and you care so deeply
dialog: about what you do and you have like no
dialog: ego, it's crazy.
text: She reaches to him... turning his face to meet hers.
speaker_heading: WINNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: And you're the smartest person I've
dialog: ever met... and there's nobody I trust
dialog: more in the world.
text: Jacob looks away... almost ashamed. And Winnie can sense
dialog: something's not right.
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WINNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Nothing...
text: As Jacob draws in a deep breath, collects himself and finally
text: turns back to her with...
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: I just wish you would master that
dialog: relationship from childhood so you can
dialog: move forward with this one.
text: AND WERE BACK ON THE CHART
text: As a circle forms on July 20th then travels down the trend

dialog: And as a circle is formed around August 11th, we...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY- DAY

scene_heading: INT. JETVAN - DAY

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Bretton... I found something I like.
text: Bretton looks over to him.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: I've been wondering when my new
dialog: portfolio manager was going to come to
dialog: me with something special.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I just wanted to make sure I would be
dialog: bringing you the smartest idea
dialog: possible. I know you don't go light.
dialog: Confirming...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: That's right. If I commit to this...
dialog: we go large and we don't back down.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It might be better to do this in the
dialog: office. I have color and support to
speaker_heading: PRESENT--
dialog: Waving him off...
dialog: 77.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: C'mon Jacob, you know that's not how
dialog: we do.
scene_heading: EXT. ADIRONDACK FOREST PRESERVE - DAY
text: 2.7 million acres of State protected majestic land. All
dialog: nature... rivers and lakes... cypresses and maples. Clean

text: As the two Becker jetvans arrive at a restricted area, a
text: STATE RANGER opens the gate and allows them to drive through
dialog: then park.
text: Jacob and Bretton emerge from the jetvan.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: This is how we do.
text: And with a nod, the DRIVER of the other jetvan opens it to
text: reveal two motorcycles inside. Bretton's MTT Turbine
text: Superbike and an Agusta, these bikes are handcrafted works of
dialog: art as much as they are demons of speed.
text: Jacob laughs in disbelief and excitement.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: And we're allowed to ride these
dialog: through here?
text: Sucking in the fresh summer air...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: No.
scene_heading: AND JACOB AND BRETTON

speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: Follow me...
text: And with that, shoots into the forest. Jacob quickly
text: follows.
speaker_heading: AND THEY RIDE
text: Winding through the trees... along the side of a river...
text: Bretton riding extremely fast with Jacob trying to keep up.
text: Bretton reaches a clearing and waits for Jacob to catch up.
dialog: Once he does...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: You're going to have to keep up.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Okay. I'm just getting used to it.
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Tell me your idea.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Here?
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Where else?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Right. Okay.
speaker_heading: (COLLECTING HIMSELF)
dialog: Are you still short any of the
dialog: financials?
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: No. After KZI, I took profits.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I think it's time to go the other way.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Banks?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Insurance companies. I'm talking the
dialog: old school insurers that have become
text: the babies thrown out with the bath
dialog: water.
text: Jacob waits for a reaction from Bretton. But all he gets
dialog: is...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Keep up!
text: And with that, Bretton rips into the clearing. Jacob rides
dialog: just as fast. They're neck and neck... it's definitely a
dialog: race.
text: Bretton pulls ahead but Jacob doesn't give up.
text: As they move quickly toward a patch of forest with a only
text: narrow trail entering it, Jacob focuses on the horizon and
text: revs the bike into more speed. He pulls up next to Bretton
text: as they approach the trail.
text: If Jacob doesn't slow down, and fall in line behind Bretton,
text: he's going to hit the trees. But he doesn't.
text: Instead, Jacob blasts the bike into its final dose of speed,
text: narrowly avoiding impact by zipping into the trail... pulling
text: ahead of Bretton and taking the lead.
speaker_heading: A TRANQUIL LAKE
text: As it sits still in the setting sun. Untouched by man.

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: The basket of stocks I'm putting

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I say we buy them here.
text: Bretton thinks about it. He's not sure.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
text: Financials are a falling knife.
text: Jacob nods...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm not arguing that... but the best
dialog: opportunities are found where angels
dialog: fear to tread.
text: Jacob can see... he has Bretton on the hook.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: So yeah -- they are falling knives.
dialog: But Bretton...

speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: WINNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm not really hungry.
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: I've been following your career,
dialog: Winnie. Senator Lehigh said some very
dialog: nice things about you in The American
dialog: Prospect interview.
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: Yeah. She's really been... very...
dialog: supportive of my...
text: And it trails off... as she just glares at Gordon.
speaker_heading: WINNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't do this.
text: She exhales, stands and looks down to Jacob.
speaker_heading: WINNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry. I can't do this.
text: And she quickly walks off. Jacob frozen. Until Gordon looks
text: over to him with...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: It's okay. This is a long term
dialog: investment.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Go after her. She needs you.
text: And Jacob does. As Gordon looks down... disappointed.
scene_heading: INT. WEST 65TH - NIGHT
text: Pouring rain. Jacob runs after her.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Winnie... Winnie...
text: He turns her around.
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: You don't understand.
text: Her tears being washed away by the rain.
speaker_heading: WINNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: My mother couldn't handle Rudy. He
dialog: was so out of control. I couldn't
dialog: help him.
text: Jacob takes her into his hold...
speaker_heading: WINNIE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (RE GEKKO)
dialog: If he wasn't in prison... if he had
dialog: been there. I know it would've been
dialog: different.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Your brother's dead, Winnie.
dialog: 83.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Squeezing her tight...
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Your father isn't.
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: He's not the person people think he
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It was a long time ago.
text: She pulls out of his embrace...
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: He'll hurt us. Can't we just go home?
dialog: Please... Jacob. It's raining.
text: And he just looks at her for a long moment... soaking wet and
text: shivering... crying and exposed.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (what am I doing?)
dialog: I love you. You don't have to do
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: (AND THEN)
dialog: Let's just go home.
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Darkness. The phone rings. Jacob answers it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Yes.
text: INTERCUT WITH...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Your insurance companies are down.
text: He's working a coffee in the master suite of The Black Swan
dialog: Home...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Bretton.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: I want to increase our size.
text: Glancing at the LCD, 12:23am...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Okay. Good. It's just a matter of
dialog: time before they turn. I'll call the
scene_heading: DESKS TOMORROW--
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Jacob, I want you to triple our

dialog: 84.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jacob takes a beat.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: And they better fucking go up.
text: Click. And as Jacob just looks at the phone...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (PRELAP)
dialog: The instant you know you're in trouble
dialog: is the exact moment when a sound
dialog: investment thesis turns into blind
dialog: hope.
scene_heading: INT. NORMA'S - MORNING
text: Jacob sits across from Gordon at this well-known breakfast
text: spot in the Parker Meridian hotel.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Tripling the size... that's a very
dialog: aggressive move.
text: Jacob nods.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: And I promise you he's using leverage
dialog: to do this.
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: He's chasing.
text: Suddenly, a MAN approaches the table. He's in his thirties.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Mr Gekko, I'm Tom Sanders. I write
dialog: for Barrons.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: I've heard of it.
text: Letting out a little laugh...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I'm sure you have.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Well, I'm doing a piece of Wall Street
text: moguls who ended up going to prison.
dialog: I've already talked to Boesky and
dialog: Milken and would love to sit down with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Can you give me the cover?
text: Tom isn't sure if Gordon's serious. Either is Jacob.
dialog: 85.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Well, I... um... don't make those
dialog: decisions.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Get me the cover and I'll give you
dialog: seventy minutes.
text: Tom politely smiles.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I'll... take that as a no.
text: ... and goes. Gordon looks down to his breakfast and quietly
dialog: asserts...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: (almost to himself)
dialog: Both those assholes got the cover when
dialog: they were convicted.
dialog: And after a moment...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: How do we know the insurance companies
dialog: are going to continue going down?
text: As he casually places his egg on a piece of toast...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: It's all going down.
text: ... and takes a bite.
text: AND THREE CHARTS NOW FILL THE SCREEN
dialog: Side by side... above the charts are written respectively
speaker_heading: MCC, ACN and ISS.
dialog: And we follow all the three trend lines from Aug 17th forward
text: to the right... and they all move down.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Just wait.
text: And we stop in September. And as a blue circle is formed
dialog: over Sept 13th on all three charts, we...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: TIME WARNER CENTER/BALLROOM
dialog: This is The Financial Follies... an annual event held by the
dialog: financial writers association.
text: 500 people sit at tables, enjoying this dinner and live show
dialog: that pokes fun at people in the world of finance.
dialog: Everyone who's anyone in high finance is here.
dialog: 86.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: On the stage, the spotlight finds BILL MAHER and the applause
text: breaks out...
speaker_heading: BILL MAHER
dialog: Welcome to the 2008 Financial Follies!
speaker_heading: (APPLAUDS)
dialog: I'm Bill Maher and I'm getting paid in
dialog: Euros.
text: Jacob shares a table with Bretton, Bretton's wife and a few
text: other FINANCIAL PLAYERS. Winnie is not here.
speaker_heading: BILL MAHER (CONT'D)
dialog: When The Financial Writers Association
dialog: asked me to host an event for the
dialog: world of finance, I was shocked. I'm
dialog: known in Washington not Wall Street...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: ... but then they informed me that
dialog: Washington is actually in the process
dialog: of buying Wall Street, so it all makes
dialog: sense.
dialog: Laughter...
speaker_heading: BILL MAHER (CONT'D)
dialog: I asked them if anything's off limits.
dialog: And they said to stay away from the
dialog: brokerages, banks and insurers...
dialog: (pause for effect, then...)
dialog: ... where the fuck was that advice
dialog: five months ago?
dialog: More laughter.
speaker_heading: BILL MAHER (CONT'D)
dialog: I see Sammy Rosen's here.
text: The spotlight finds SAMMY ROSEN, billionaire hedge funder.
speaker_heading: BILL MAHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Sammy, how are you?
dialog: From his table...
speaker_heading: SAMMY ROSEN
dialog: Doing well.
speaker_heading: BILL MAHER
dialog: (to the room)
dialog: Of course he is... in the amount of
dialog: time it took for us to have that
dialog: exchange, he made three hundred and
dialog: nine thousand dollars.
dialog: (back to Sammy)
dialog: Sammy, let me give you some free
dialog: advice, the next time someone with bad
dialog: eyesight wants to sell you a hundred
dialog: and fifty million dollar painting...
dialog: don't let them personally deliver it.
dialog: 87.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: It's an inside joke that this room gets...
speaker_heading: BILL MAHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Somebody told me Gordon Gekko is here.
dialog: Gordon... ?
text: Across the room, a spotlight finds Gordon...
speaker_heading: BILL MAHER (CONT'D)
dialog: There you are. I have some inside
dialog: information for you, Gekko... sex
dialog: sells books, not bread lines.
text: Gordon smiles and raises his glass up to Bill.
speaker_heading: BILL MAHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Talk about your sour grapes.
dialog: Seriously Gordon -- just because the
dialog: SEC doesn't let you make obscene
dialog: amounts of money by being wrong and
dialog: nefarious doesn't mean you have to
dialog: ruin it for all of these hard working
dialog: people.
text: The room applauds...
speaker_heading: BILL MAHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, we have a video to show now.
dialog: It's a very detailed and academic
dialog: account of the current mortgage
dialog: crises. Let `er rip!
text: And the room goes dark... and on the screen plays a childlike
text: roughly illustrated stick-figure skit being narrated by
dialog: children.
speaker_heading: FIRST FRAME
text: Under the caption "Main Street National Bank" is a drawing of
text: a Poor Man sitting across from a Banker Man behind his desk.
speaker_heading: POOR MAN
dialog: I'd like a mortgage... I don't really
dialog: have any money though... is that cool?
speaker_heading: BANKER MAN
dialog: Totally cool. Since housing prices
dialog: are always going up it won't be a
dialog: problem.
speaker_heading: POOR MAN
dialog: You guys are awesome!
speaker_heading: NEXT FRAME
text: Under the caption "A few weeks later at the bank..."
text: Banker Man now stands over a pile of steaming shit.
dialog: 88.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANKER MAN
dialog: Wow, these mortgages are really
dialog: beginning to smell. I better sell
dialog: them to smart people.
speaker_heading: NEXT FRAME
text: Under the caption of "Smart People Investment Bank" Smart Man
text: stands over the same steaming pile of shit.
speaker_heading: SMART MAN
dialog: Wow, these mortgages we just bought
dialog: really smell. I better sell them to
dialog: foreigners.
speaker_heading: NEXT FRAME
text: Under the caption of "The CDO Factory" our smart man oversees
text: an assembly line of stick figure workers.
speaker_heading: SMART MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Mix those crappy mortgages in real
dialog: good with the clean ones so the rating
dialog: agencies won't smell them.
speaker_heading: NEXT FRAME
text: Under the caption of "Rich Man Hedge Fund" a stick figure
text: named Rich Man sits behind his desk and holds a phone to his
dialog: ear.
speaker_heading: RICH MAN
dialog: Good news, Smart Man, not only did
dialog: foreigners buy those traunches, but so
dialog: did school boards and charities and
dialog: big pensions.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Why did they buy them you ask? Well,
dialog: they were looking for a really secure
dialog: risk-free investment and they were all
dialog: triple A, so...
speaker_heading: NEXT FRAME
dialog: Under the caption "Norwegian Village Pension Fund" a
text: Norwegian Man sits behind his desk and shouts into his phone.
speaker_heading: NORWEGIAN MAN
dialog: Hey man! What the fuck? We're not
dialog: receiving our monthly payments!
speaker_heading: NEXT FRAME
text: Under the caption "Rich Man Hedge Fund," Rich Man at his desk
text: on the phone.
speaker_heading: RICH MAN
dialog: Yeah, we fucked up.
dialog: 89.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: And it now shuffles between the last two frames... the
dialog: Norwegian Man and Rich Man.
speaker_heading: NORWEGIAN MAN
dialog: What about the rating agencies?
speaker_heading: RICH MAN
dialog: Yeah, they fucked up too.
speaker_heading: NORWEGIAN MAN
dialog: What about the investment bank that
dialog: put these CDO's together?
speaker_heading: RICH MAN
dialog: Fucked up.
speaker_heading: NORWEGIAN MAN
dialog: What about the bank that made the
dialog: original loan?
speaker_heading: RICH MAN
dialog: Totally fucked up.
speaker_heading: NORWEGIAN MAN
dialog: What am I supposed to tell my
dialog: villagers?
speaker_heading: RICH MAN
dialog: That you fucked up.
dialog: The final frame
text: Just the rendering of that steaming pile of shit under the
dialog: caption... "The End."
text: And the lights go on to a some subdued laughter and a
text: smattering of applause.
speaker_heading: BILL MAHER
dialog: What a year -- enjoy the night!
scene_heading: INT. FINANCIAL FOLLIES - LATER
text: Desert is served. Jackets are off, cigars are lit, Bretton's
text: wife has gone home. The group at the table is a little drunk
dialog: and having a good time.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: It's a good question... what do you
dialog: think, George?
text: GEORGE, an investment banker at the table, thinks about it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: The definition of rich... flying
dialog: private.
text: The table reacts... some agree, other don't. George turns to
dialog: Jacob.
dialog: 90.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Jacob... ? What do you think?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: To be rich... is to have the love of a
dialog: good woman.
dialog: They all boo...
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: For real... I truly believe that.
text: And Jacob turns to Bretton...
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Bretton... what's your definition of
dialog: rich?
text: An approaching voice answers it for him.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: To have twice as much money as you
dialog: currently do.
text: As he takes a seat...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Isn't that what you always say,
dialog: Bretton?
text: Then... announcing to the table...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
text: He brings up the question, runs it
text: round the table then finishes with
dialog: that. It's an old bit.
text: Also announcing to the table...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Be careful Gordon...
dialog: (looking at Jacob)
dialog: ... your daughter's financial health
dialog: is in my hands now.
text: Jacob loses his smile... suddenly becoming uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: And the way The Locust Fund has been
dialog: buying up the insurance companies
dialog: lately makes me worried about my
dialog: future grandchildren's college
dialog: educations.
speaker_heading: JACOB
speaker_heading: (TO BRETTON)
dialog: I didn't tell him.
dialog: 91.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: No, I don't suppose you did.
text: Bretton looks over to Jacob.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: Go ahead, Jacob, preach your book...
dialog: defend your names.
text: And Jacob turns to Gordon...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: We have a proactive central bank, the
text: charts show a clear bottom on July
dialog: 15th and these companies are trading
dialog: at half of what they were six months
dialog: ago.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Just cause it's low don't make it
dialog: cheap, Sport.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I read your book.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
text: It's not out yet.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I have a friend in publishing.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: 25% unemployment... stagflation...
dialog: bread lines... Martial law...
dialog: government seizures of assets and
dialog: gold... end of democracy...
text: Bretton leans back... taking in this sparring match.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Really Gordon? Do you really need
dialog: attention that badly?
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Since I have forty-four seconds to
dialog: spare, I'm going to tell you a story.
dialog: It's about a guy named Sam.
dialog: And we go close on Gekko...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: Sam used to work a job, he made things
dialog: and he grew things and he sold those
dialog: things. Until one day Sam got a
dialog: credit card and was amazed how easy it
dialog: was to buy things with it. So Sam got
text: another card and then another. Then
dialog: he used the credit card money to make
dialog: it look like he had an income... and
dialog: he used that "income" to secure a
dialog: loan.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: And with that loan Sam bought a fancy
dialog: BMW car and rented a fancy penthouse
dialog: apartment.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Now, the credit cards hit their limit
dialog: and the bank needed him to service
dialog: that loan, so Sam went to his friends.
dialog: His Chinese friend... and his Japanese
dialog: friend... and his British friend and
dialog: so on. And his friends loaned Sam
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: (ANOTHER BEAT)
dialog: And that brings us to today... where
dialog: Sam owes the credit cards and Sam owes
dialog: the banks and Sam owes his friends and
dialog: eventually they're going to take away
text: Sam's fancy BMW car and his fancy
dialog: penthouse apartment.
text: And Jacob can now see... in Gordon Gekko's eyes... he truly
text: believes every word he's saying.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: And Sam doesn't make anything anymore
dialog: and Sam doesn't grow anything anymore
dialog: so Sam doesn't sell anything anymore.
text: As he stands...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: Our favorite Uncle Sam's desperate,
dialog: Jake... and he just found a printing
text: press in his basement.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: So you tell me -- where do we go from
dialog: here?
text: And with that, Gordon Gekko goes.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
speaker_heading: (RE GEKKO)
dialog: It is sad isn't it? That he can't
dialog: just take his ball and go home.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: That he has to piss on the whole game.
scene_heading: EXT. 533 THIRD AVENUE - MORNING
text: Rushed, Jacob heads through the lobby of his building. Diego
text: catches his stride.
speaker_heading: DIEGO
dialog: (doing his best Howard
speaker_heading: COSELL)
dialog: Down goes Lehman! Down goes Lehman!
dialog: Down goes Lehman!
dialog: And Jacob just keeps walking...

scene_heading: INT. THE LOCUST FUND/JACOB'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: Jacob heads into the office to find Bretton sitting behind
dialog: his desk.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: They're not going to save it. They're
dialog: just going to let it bloody die!
text: And sure enough... on the tv... Fox Business runs footage of
text: Lehman Brother's demise. On the screen, the chyron screams:
text: $700 BILLION GOVERNMENT BAILOUT TO THE BANKS!
speaker_heading: ALEXIS GLICK (ON TV)
dialog: And as another US banking institution
dialog: collapses, Congress is working quickly
dialog: on a bailout package that will
dialog: distribute over three hundred billion
dialog: dollars to other banks in trouble.
text: Bretton turns off the tv and looks to Jacob with...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: We're getting fucking killed.
text: And Jacob looks up to his electronic ticker...
dialog: MCC $18.53 -2.34, ACN $12.04 -1.35, ISS $7.03 -.65.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It's capitulation.
text: Bretton holds Jacob's look... fighting to keep his composure.
text: Until... he simply stands and offers Jacob his desk back.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Then buy more.
text: Jacob takes his chair and reaches for the phone.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: Cost us down to current levels.
text: Jacob looks up, surprised.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: It's just a question of time before
dialog: this turns around... right?
text: And he glares at Jacob.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Right.
text: Bretton just stares nervously at the electronic ticker... a
text: frazzled gambler talking himself into his bet.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Fuck it.
dialog: 94.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: As he goes...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: Leverage is sexy.
text: AND WERE BACK ON THE CHART
text: As a circle forms on Sept 16th then travels down the trend
text: line and stops.
dialog: And as a circle is formed around the Sept 24th, we...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: LCD reads 4:43 am. Jacob lays awake... staring at the
dialog: ceiling.
speaker_heading: WINNIE (O.S.)
dialog: I would hear him in the kitchen.
text: Jacob turns to see she's awake.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm sorry, you have an early train.
dialog: I'm going to just go to the office
dialog: now.
text: She leans up.
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: He didn't want to keep my mother awake
dialog: so he'd go into the kitchen and sit
dialog: there. I could hear him because my
text: room was right up the back stairs.
dialog: I'd go and sit with him sometimes.
dialog: We'd eat ice cream.
text: Jacob gets out of bed and throws on his robe.
speaker_heading: WINNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I was only eight but I could tell he
dialog: was worried about something and that
dialog: made me worried.
dialog: (softly, almost to herself)
dialog: Then the market would go back up and
dialog: he would sleep through the night
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It's not the market, Winnie.
text: As he sits on the edge of the bed...
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: It's just that I haven't been able to
dialog: sleep through the night since...
text: The thought trails off... she leans up and kisses him.
dialog: 95.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: I wish I could tell you something was
dialog: going to come along that would make it
dialog: better but I can't. It's just going
dialog: to take time, Jacob. A lot of time.
text: And she looks into his eyes...
speaker_heading: WINNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Have you been counting Fridays?
text: He slowly nods.
speaker_heading: WINNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I still count Tuesdays.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: All seven hundred and twenty eight of
dialog: them.
text: He leans over and kisses her forehead.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Go back to sleep.
dialog: And he goes...
text: After a beat, she sees Jacob's wallet.
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: (calling out after him)
dialog: Jacob, you forgot...
text: She jumps out of bed, grabs the wallet and goes after him,
text: but... it opens up and Winnie notices the picture inside.
text: And she stops, staring at that picture.
dialog: Her and her father on that white horse... taken years ago.
text: A picture she knows she never gave to Jacob.
scene_heading: INT. THE LOCUST FUND/JACOB'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: Jacob heads in and turns on Fox Business...
speaker_heading: BRIAN SULLIVAN (ON TV)
text: It's a complete unmitigated bloodbath
text: out there. The S&amp;P tried to rally at
dialog: about 10am but it was met with yet
dialog: another brutal wave of selling and
dialog: people... we're now at our lows for
dialog: the day, the week, the month and the
dialog: year.
text: Jacob looks up at ticker on the wall.
text: MCC $15.13 -3.40, ACN $10.10 -1.96, ISS $5.14 -1.89.
dialog: 96.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: And he stares at that ticker... at the The Locust Fund's
dialog: methodical death.
dialog: Suddenly...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (O.S.)
dialog: Are you happy?
text: He stands in the doorway holding a drink.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: We're done.
text: And Bretton CHUCKS the drink against the wall and the glass
text: shatters. Jacob takes a step back.
text: Bretton's in a complete state as he walks over to Jacob's
text: desk and SWIPES it clean... papers flying about.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: Finished...
text: Now he picks up the chair...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: Bank notices...
text: ... throws it against the window... which cracks.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: Margin calls...
text: As he punches the monitor of Jacob's Bloomberg...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: Redemptions...
text: And Jacob just stands there... wide-eyed. Just looking at...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
text: Face full of sweat... blood all over his hand... hair strewn
text: about... completely out of breath... bloodshot red eyes... a
text: beaten down mess of a man.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What happened to composure, Bretton?
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Well, I suppose it went to hell with
dialog: your fucking insurance stocks.
text: And Bretton calms down, walks to the window.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: It's not making sense to me anymore.
dialog: The market always made sense to me and
dialog: for the most part... I was better than
dialog: it... quicker than it.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 97.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
text: But it's moving too fast now and it
dialog: looks like the world is going to shit
dialog: anyway.
text: And he faces Jacob Moore.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: If I unwind the fund now I'll still
dialog: walk with six hundred million or so.
text: And Jacob's face falls... this is news to him.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: It's time to call it a day. Spend
dialog: more time with my family. I suppose
dialog: this moment comes for all of us.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You still have six hundred million?
text: Bretton vacantly nods.
dialog: And Jacob Moore... trying his best to hide his
dialog: disappointment...
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: (almost to himself)
dialog: That's a fortune.
text: With a shrug...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: I guess it's all relative.
text: Bretton then takes a moment... confirming to himself that
text: this is the right decision... then finally looks over to
dialog: Jacob with...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
dialog: And Jacob -- you're the worst
dialog: portfolio manager I've ever seen.
scene_heading: INT. CENTRAL PARK - DUSK

speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Okay...
dialog: 98.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No, it's not okay... because we're so
dialog: fucking close... and he's going to

dialog: and that's unacceptable.

speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: I don't know what to tell you, Pal.
dialog: You wanted to make him bleed, I wanted
dialog: my daughter back...
text: As he walks...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: ... looks like life brings
dialog: disappointment to us all.
text: And Jacob... as he matches Gordon's stride... in a complete
dialog: state.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What happened to slaughtering men,
dialog: Gordon? What happened to turning them
dialog: into penny-ante brokers in
dialog: Poughkeepsie?
text: Gordon stops walking.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Look at you. This can't possibly be
dialog: the man my daughter fell in love with.
text: Jacob turns away.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I want to finish the job.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Because nobody gave a shit about me
dialog: before Andrew Zabel came along.
dialog: Because he didn't deserve what he got.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: The universe is an efficient market,
dialog: Kid... we all get what we deserve.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Did you?
text: Now it's Gordon who looks away.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: I know you cared about him... and I
dialog: know how that motivates. But Jacob...
dialog: he wasn't such a Saint.
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: And with that, Gordon Gekko heads on his way...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: You don't want to know.
text: Jacob steps forward... shouting out after him...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm sorry she doesn't want anything to
dialog: do with you, Gordon -- I'm sorry she
dialog: doesn't love you!
text: Gordon stops walking. Turns...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Okay Jake... you want to know.
text: Jacob sharply nods.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you ever think about it? I mean
dialog: really think about it? How someone
dialog: could make money year after year...
dialog: even through bear markets?
text: Jacob just stands there... listening...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: On November 15th, 1903 an Italian man
dialog: arrived aboard the S.S. Vancouver in
dialog: Boston. He had two dollars and fifty
dialog: cents to his name. Yet just a few
dialog: years later he was millionaire. You
dialog: wanna know how? He had invented a
dialog: scheme... it was quite simple
dialog: actually.
text: And Jacob now steps forward... piecing it together...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: He would get people to invest with him
dialog: by offering larger than normal returns
dialog: then pay the old investors with the
dialog: new investors money. As long as there
dialog: was fresh money, he could keep going.
dialog: Do you know what his name was, Jacob?
dialog: It was Charles...

speaker_heading: JACOB
text: United Bancorp is going under. Wells
dialog: Fargo has stepped up but the offer is

speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: I know all this.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You still have the fund and you still

dialog: You want out of the game... buy a
dialog: bank.
text: Bretton skeptically regards Jacob.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Why are you doing this?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Because I got you into those insurance
dialog: companies... because I let you down...
text: And Bretton... biting his lip in thought...
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: I don't like the mortgage toxic waste.
dialog: It can't be quantified... and it
dialog: spreads...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I worked it out already. You wouldn't
dialog: have to take it.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: How'd you do that?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Well, Wells won't insure the Zabel
dialog: institutional money. It's against
dialog: their policy.
dialog: And then...
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: I told them you would.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Then who would take on the mortgage

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Uncle Sam.

speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: So, I'd get the bank, the KZI assets
dialog: including the institutional fund yet
dialog: none of the mortgage securities.
text: As Jacob leans forward... going in for the kill...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You could actually own the bank your
dialog: father toiled away at his whole
dialog: career. Think about that, Bretton.
text: Bretton just shakes his head.
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: We're going to lose our credit. I'm
dialog: facing margin calls.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: So in order to stay in the game... we

speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: OLEG--
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: (not going to work)

text: Jacob thinks for a moment, then...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: And how much do we need?
speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS
dialog: Fifty, sixty million minimum... and

speaker_heading: BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Short version -- taking risks you're

text: And the next person steps up and hands Gordon a copy.
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: He's going for it. We're almost home.
text: As he signs it...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: There you go.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: But he needs fresh money to serve the
dialog: leverage. A hundred million.
text: Gordon just shrugs.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: I'm a writer now. We don't make that
dialog: much.
text: As the line of people holding their new books start to get

speaker_heading: JACOB

speaker_heading: JACOB

speaker_heading: WINNIE

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: But it is... right? It's your money?
text: And she faces him... regarding his urgency...
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: (glaring at him)
dialog: You might want to wipe some of the
dialog: drool off your face...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm not kidding. This is important.
text: As they continue to walk...
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: Yes, it's mine. When he went to
dialog: prison, my father put a lot of money
dialog: in our names. And when Rudy died it
dialog: all became mine.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: But it's in a trust. I can't get to
dialog: it until I'm thirty-five and even then
dialog: I was planning on giving it to
dialog: charity.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Let's say I can figure out a way for
dialog: you to get it. Take a loan against it
dialog: -- something like that. Will you do
dialog: that for me?
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: Why are you doing this, Jacob?

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: He definitely knew what he was
dialog: doing...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: And how could Winnie get it now?
text: Hadley stops walking and thinks about it.
speaker_heading: HADLEY
dialog: Well, she'd have to sign a reversion
dialog: of trust document. That way the funds
dialog: would revert back to their pre-trust
dialog: posture and regulations.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: So all she has to do is sign a piece
dialog: of paper?
speaker_heading: HADLEY
dialog: Basically.
dialog: As that registers...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: How much is in there?
speaker_heading: HADLEY
dialog: It's complicated. There's private
dialog: equity ownership, real estate, a very
dialog: large position in a bank... all sorts
dialog: of investment vehicles.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Ballpark it for me.
speaker_heading: HADLEY
dialog: I don't know. Assuming immediate

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Who is that?
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What about you?
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: I would love to sign it, Jacob.
dialog: Consider it done.
text: Walking down 5th avenue...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Thank you. Thank you, Gordon.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Just after you agree to two things.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Anything.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
text: Before Bretton buys the bank, he must

speaker_heading: (BEAT)

speaker_heading: JACOB

speaker_heading: HADLEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: That's funny because he often speaks

dialog: can help me with were records of his

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: We think it'll be fun to bring up some

speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Of course... but it is against policy

speaker_heading: JACOB

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You let me see the records for

text: As Jacob looks over the old documents... trading ledgers from
dialog: twenty-five years ago.
text: Down the list we see him circle all the unusually large
dialog: successful trades. And then follow them to the client # on
text: the right side of the ledger.
dialog: And Jacob realizes it's the same client # every time. Client
dialog: #41.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Wow, Bretton -- you really kicked some
dialog: ass for client forty one.
text: Finally Jacob turns to the back of the ledger, to the client
text: key, where he moves the pencil down to client #41 and it
dialog: says... Gordon Gekko.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: (all making sense now)
dialog: Bud Fox wasn't the only one.
scene_heading: INT. IMPRESSIVE TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Jacob waits in the large entry hall... holding a cheap
dialog: umbrella he bought at Heathrow.
text: And down from the stairs walks...
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: It's been a bitch of a month, my
dialog: friend... tell me this visit does not
dialog: bring bad news.
scene_heading: INT. OLEG'S LIBRARY - NIGHT
text: Oleg sips his vodka and looks at Jacob.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: You want me to audit The Locust Fund?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: That's right. I want you to tell
dialog: Bretton you need the official records
dialog: of all the fund's activity starting
dialog: with when you gave him the original
dialog: two hundred million. You need this
dialog: because The Russian Federal Tax
dialog: Service is up your ass and you have to
text: play ball with them.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: And if he declines... ?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You'll have no choice but to pull your
dialog: money.
dialog: 116.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Oleg lights a cigarette... exhaling the smoke with...
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: And why would I do that?
text: And Jacob leans forward...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Because if you do this for me, Oleg,
dialog: I'll teach you the Andrew Zabel magic.
dialog: I'll explain to you, in detail, all of
dialog: his techniques... I'll give you all
dialog: his secrets... it's less complicated
dialog: than you might think.
scene_heading: INT. LONDON MOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: Darkness, until... a phone rings. Jacob wakes up and takes
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Hello... Okay, thank you.
text: He moves to the curtains then opens them.
text: And the daylight spills in.
scene_heading: INT. OLEG'S LIBRARY - DAY
text: Oleg slides four encyclopedia-sized bounded stacks of
text: printouts across his desk.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: All the Locust Fund's trades for the
dialog: last two years.
text: Jacob nods, placing them into his bag.
text: And Oleg lights a cigarette... looks right at us...
text: excited... leaning forward with...
speaker_heading: OLEG (CONT'D)
dialog: Now give it to me. Let me behind the
dialog: Andrew Zabel curtain...
scene_heading: INT. 767 - DAY
text: As Jacob flies back to New York. He flips through the Locust
text: Fund trading ledgers, shaking his head in disbelief.
scene_heading: INT. WINNIE'S APARTMENT - MORNING
text: Winnie answers the door to find...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: They were working together. Your
dialog: father and Bretton.
text: Walking back into the apartment...
dialog: 117.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: Jacob, what are you doing here?
dialog: Following her in...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Gordon wanted the trust the whole
dialog: time. And when I came to him seeking
dialog: revenge... he saw his window.
text: Upset, she looks for her keys.
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: I have to go to work.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Bretton owed him a favor because he
dialog: fed your father information twenty
dialog: three years ago when he was a young
dialog: broker in London and your father never
dialog: ratted him out.
text: She just looks at him... shaking her head... and not in
text: disapproval... but in pity. But he keeps going.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: And he never put the money into
dialog: Bretton's fund. Turns out your trust
dialog: had built up a controlling position in
dialog: Hudson River Bank.
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: That's the bank he worked at when I
dialog: was born.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Well, now he owns it. Or shall I say
text: pilfered it before he went AWOL.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: And that money wasn't even the
dialog: bank's... it was taxpayers'... bailout
dialog: money.
text: As this washes over a stunned Winnie Gekko...
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: Jesus...
dialog: And Jacob confirms...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: He saw this coming years ago... from
dialog: his cell. I'm guessing he made off
dialog: with billions.
text: And he throws something on the table.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: And now look?
dialog: 118.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: It's a copy of Portfolio Magazine with a picture of Gordon on
text: cover under the headline... "Guess Who's Back and Getting
dialog: Rich Betting Against You?"
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: He's in London... giving interviews
dialog: and being hailed as a genius.
text: Everyone's buying his book and waiting
text: to see his next move.
dialog: Desperately trying to get her mind around this...
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: But what about the SEC, the regulatory
dialog: agencies-- ?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: The government is flying this 700
text: billion dollar airplane by the seat of
dialog: it's pants. They don't know where
dialog: half of the fucking money is going.
dialog: And even if they did, do you think
dialog: they want this out there?
text: As this all washes over her...
speaker_heading: WINNIE
text: This is his revenge.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Yup... sure beats the hell out of
dialog: insider trading, doesn't it?
text: And Winnie finds her keys and heads for the door...
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: I can't hear anymore of this.
text: ... but Jacob steps in front of her.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm done. I sold everything. The
dialog: ring. Everything. I gave back the
dialog: KZI bonus. I'm out and I'm broke and
dialog: I deserve it.
text: And she just looks at him...
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: But Winnie, the one thing I can't
dialog: accept -- is losing you.
text: And before she reacts...
text: WERE BACK ON THE CHART
text: As a circle forms on Nov 6th then travels quite a ways then
text: finally stops. Unfortunately, this slope down the S&amp;P
text: trendline is quite pronounced.
dialog: 119.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: And as a circle is formed around Jan 24th 2009, we...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: THE CABIN OF A BOEING 777
text: As Jacob opens up a copy of Barron's... Gekko on the cover
text: under the caption "What's His Next Move?"
scene_heading: AND BRETTON WOODS
dialog: In an official office of our Federal Reserve Bank, proudly
dialog: signing the documents...
text: AND ALONG THE BANKS OF THE PERSIAN GULF
text: Dubai in the background. Jacob waits against a bench.
text: And across the way he sees... approaching him... Gordon
dialog: Gekko.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Did you see Barrons?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You finally got the cover.
text: Gordon nods.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Everybody thinks you got rich of
dialog: betting against the system. If they
dialog: only knew...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: The powers that be will never let that
dialog: happen.
dialog: Jacob's not arguing it...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: How much is enough, Gordon?
text: Gordon laughs with a shake of the head.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: I've been asked that before...
speaker_heading: (AND THEN)
dialog: They took a hundred, twenty two
dialog: thousand, six hundred and forty hours
dialog: from me... for a goddamn victimless
dialog: crime. All the while I sit in my 8 by
dialog: 12 and watch real crooks by the
dialog: thousands give out mortgages like
dialog: candy, package them into unexplainable
dialog: derivatives and spit the cancer out
dialog: into the world.
text: And he just shakes his head...
dialog: 120.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: And when I get out... who's there
dialog: waiting for me? Nobody.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You better believe I'm going to get
dialog: mine.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You're not going to miss America?
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: I'll always have America... it's why
dialog: I'm here. I'm buying the island.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I know it's kitschy but it's fun and
dialog: good for business.
text: Looking over the water...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: I have a lot business abroad now.
dialog: Interests in an Australian copper
dialog: mine, a German solar company, some
text: Russian oil pipelines, a casino in
dialog: Macau... see Jake, America just isn't
dialog: where the action is anymore.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What happened to the precious
dialog: depreciating asset of time?
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: It still trades...
text: And he turns to Jacob with a smile...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: ... but I'm a billionaire now, Pal.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm out, Gordon, I'm done trading.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: I don't know why. You pulled it off,
dialog: Kid, you took him down -- granted with
dialog: my help -- but you atoned for Zabel's
dialog: sins with Bretton's money.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: As I see it, you're just getting
dialog: started.
text: And Jacob stops walking then slowly turns to Gordon with...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Did you ever really want to reconcile
dialog: with her?
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: (of course I did)
dialog: I'm human.
dialog: 121.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Glaring at him...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Then why did you do it?
text: And Gordon... strongly holding Jacob's glare... simply
dialog: replies...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Same answer.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: But it didn't work.
text: Gordon sadly shrugs...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: I've been trying to wire two hundred
dialog: million into her bank account but she
dialog: won't accept it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I know. She doesn't want it... we
dialog: don't want it.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Because it's not about what you
dialog: have... it's about what you do. And
dialog: Gordon -- it's never about the money.
text: Gordon shakes his head.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: That sounds good. I bet you can even
dialog: wrap it in a pretty red bow. But
dialog: Champ, it's idealistic... and idealism
dialog: kills every trade.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Winnie will realize that at some
dialog: point... and then we'll be fine.
text: And Jacob finally looks away... in pity.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: See Jacob -- the hustle we all fall
dialog: for is actually thinking we can fight
dialog: what's inherent, what's inevitable...
dialog: that we can somehow undo what
dialog: genetics, or God, or whatever name you
dialog: wanna tag it, has placed deep inside
dialog: of us. Because whether it's greed or
dialog: revenge or the compulsion to chase...
dialog: it all amounts to the same thing...
dialog: loss of control. And it's always
dialog: going to be there and it's always
dialog: going to be stronger than you, Pal.
dialog: Now walking again...
dialog: 122.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: It's why bubbles will always exist and
dialog: it's why we're all currently in this
dialog: mess.
text: Joining Gordon's stride...
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: Winnie's pregnant.
text: And Gordon stops walking.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: It's going to be a boy.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It's bad out there, Gordon, people are
dialog: panicked. They're not looking to
dialog: their government. They're not looking
dialog: to their trusted advisors. They're
dialog: looking to you.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: You want me to buy?
dialog: And Jacob Moore... slowly confirming...
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: Publicly and aggressively.
text: Gordon just looks at him.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: But they're all lemmings. Simple
dialog: psychology. You once said every crash
dialog: should have a JP Morgan to step in and
dialog: save it.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Well Gordon -- this is your chance to
dialog: be JP Morgan.
text: And now Gordon shakes his head...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: We're far from the bottom. It'll be a
text: dead cat bounce.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It'll buy us time. That's all I'm
dialog: asking for... time.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Time for the new administration to put
dialog: their plan into action.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: What do I get in return?
dialog: 123.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: As Gordon turns... takes in the city of Dubai... in all of
dialog: its ridiculous splendor...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Full clemency.
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: You can offer that?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Your daughter can. She works with the
dialog: new Secretary of Treasury now.
dialog: Considering that...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: What else?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Winnie. Me. Your grandson.
dialog: Something money can't buy... a family.
text: And Gordon looks at him for the longest moments, allowing it
dialog: all to register, then...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Sorry son -- that's simply a trade I
dialog: cannot make.
text: And as Gordon Gekko walks off... leaving Jacob Moore
dialog: behind...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: You wanna know what the mother of all
dialog: bubbles was? Us. The human race.
dialog: Scientists call it the Cambrian
text: Explosion, from the Cambrian fauna.
scene_heading: AND RONALD REAGAN NATIONAL AIRPORT
text: As Jacob heads into the baggage claim area to see Winnie
dialog: waiting for him...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: It happened 530 million years ago...
dialog: when all of the sudden, there was the
text: seemingly rapid appearance of most
text: major groups of complex animals.
text: And as they embrace...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And from it was born humanity.
speaker_heading: AND GORDON GEKKO
text: Being led through a massive empty space... office space...
dialog: 124.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
text: It was an explosion of life.
dialog: Scientists will tell you it was
dialog: unprecedented, excessive and by the
dialog: standards of evolution-time...
text: happened in a flash.
text: The City of London outside the large windows...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
dialog: Suddenly the world had millions of new
dialog: species... just like that.
text: This will be the home of his new international empire.
scene_heading: AND BRETTON WOODS
text: At his desk in his 15 CPW penthouse...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: See -- bubbles are the purest form of
dialog: Darwinism.
dialog: ... looking over pages and pages of destruction... Andrew
dialog: Zabel's legacy that he now has to pay for...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: They teach us what we didn't know and
dialog: they remind us of what we forgot...
text: And Bretton completely loses it... just starts ripping out
text: the pages then tearing them in two...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: They kill excess and they lean out the
dialog: herd.
text: ... methodically... page by page... over and over again...
speaker_heading: AND GORDON GEKKO
text: Sitting in his massive London office.
text: It's empty. It's night. He's completely alone.
text: He looks up at the wall... at the framed picture of JP Morgan
dialog: and Uncle Sam rowing that boat.
text: Then he looks down at an old picture of Winnie... she's
text: probably three or four years old... and lovingly holding her
dialog: baby brother, Rudy.
text: And Gordon holds on this picture for a long moment, before
dialog: finally...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: They actually bring us back to the
dialog: necessary simple...
dialog: 125.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: ... picking up the phone.
speaker_heading: AND GORDON GEKKO
dialog: Now in the back of a Town Car... we don't know where...
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Because Jacob...
text: As the door opens, daylight spills in and we see the charging
text: bull of Bowling Green Park across the way...
text: Gordon is escorted out of the car and led to the doors of the
dialog: New York stock exchange.
text: And Gordon stops at the famed doors, takes a moment to regard
text: the exchange, sucks in a deep breath, readies for his hero's
text: welcome and finally... opens the doors then disappears
dialog: inside.
scene_heading: AND WINNIE AND JACOB
text: Greet the morning in their small Washington DC apartment.

dialog: "Gekko Now Betting On A Recovery."
speaker_heading: GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: ... you'd be amazed what can rise from
