text: PETE (39) and DEBBIE (39) are having fantastic sex in the
text: shower. Debbie moans loudly. Pete is strong and sure of
text: himself. In total control.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Oh Pete! Oh my god! This is crazy!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Oh my god. So incredible. Want to
dialog: know a secret? I took a Viagra.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I took a Viagra. Those things
dialog: totally work. This is awesome. Why
dialog: don't I use this every day?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What? What did you do? Wait. Stop.
text: Debbie gets out of the shower. Pete follows.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You just took a Viagra to have sex
dialog: with me?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I thought it would make it better.
dialog: It was better. It takes some of the
dialog: pressure off.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Because you can't get hard without
dialog: a Viagra? Is it because you don't
dialog: think I'm sexy?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I thought you'd think it was fun
dialog: for me to supersize it for once.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: That is the worst birthday present
dialog: you could ever give someone.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I was just trying to go turbo for
dialog: your birthday.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
text: My hard-ons are still in analog.
dialog: This shit's digital.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I don't want a turbo penis. I like
dialog: your medium soft one.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Look, I can get it up. Just not
dialog: that far up.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Where did you get this?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I got it from Barry.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What? You got it from Barry?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Why do you care? This is my dick
dialog: we're talking about, not yours.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: We are young people. We don't need
dialog: medication to have sex.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I only took it because it's your
dialog: birthday. I thought you'd like it.
dialog: Happy fucking fortieth birthday.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I am not forty! And I don't want to
dialog: have a husband who has to take
dialog: Viagra to get a hard-on.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I don't have to take it every time,
dialog: but once in a while...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Fuck forty! Forty can suck my dick.

speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: Your breath smells weird.
text: Pete breathes all over her as he talks.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Wake up, wake up. Time to get up.
scene_heading: INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - MORNING
text: Pete lifts a sleeping CHARLOTTE (8) out of bed and walks her
text: downstairs. It looks ridiculous because she is too tall to
text: hold her like she is a baby.
scene_heading: INT. BREAKFAST NOOK - MORNING
text: Pete and the kids set up a tray of muffins and donuts on the
text: table and decorate the room with birthday balloons,
text: streamers, etc. Pete sneaks bacon, cupcakes, and mini donuts
text: into his mouth occasionally. The house is a bit more
text: cluttered and messier than when we last saw it in Knocked Up.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BATHROOM - MORNING
text: Debbie opens a window and sneaks a cigarette.
speaker_heading: PETE (O.C.)
dialog: We're ready!
text: She holds her cigarette with a yellow dish washing glove. She
text: puts out the cigarette and goes through an elaborate routine
text: of hiding the smell of smoke. She puts some weird oil in her
text: hair and uses a wet nap on her neck and clothes and brushes
text: her teeth. She sprays cologne and walks through it.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Pete and the kids hold a cake and sing "Happy Birthday" as

text: on the cake which says "Happy 38th Birthday."
speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Can I watch Lost?
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: You can't handle Lost. It's too
dialog: violent, and you won't understand.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: If I don't understand it, why can't
dialog: I handle it?
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: Because you're eight.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I can handle it. I've seen a shark
text: eat a guy on Shark Week.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: Shark Week is fake.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: No, it's not.
speaker_heading: SADIE
text: All of it is reenactments.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I know but they--
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: That's scary! You shouldn't be
dialog: allowed to watch that.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
text: --they show the reenactments but
dialog: they actually happened.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: It's going to give you nightmares.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: The one you just put into the sink.
dialog: I saw you were hiding that.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: This cupcake? You think I'm going
dialog: to eat this cupcake?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I so don't want this cupcake. Look.
text: He turns on the faucet and pours water on the cupcake.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You're still going to eat it.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I'm going to eat this cupcake?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Just put it in the trash.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What would you like to do today?
dialog: Your choice.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Anything?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah, anything.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Just hang out with you guys.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Don't you want to get a massage? Or
dialog: do something fun? Forty's huge.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I'm turning thirty-eight.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Okay. Thirty-eight. We'll move on.
dialog: Isn't it weird that our birthday is
dialog: the same week and that we're going
dialog: to have a party, and it's just for
dialog: me?
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: No. I don't think it's weird at
dialog: all. Because you're turning forty
dialog: and I'm turning thirty-eight.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Come on. Do you really want to be
dialog: one of those ladies who's just so
dialog: insecure about their age and they
dialog: lie and then they've got to
dialog: remember.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You don't get it. You don't
dialog: understand how it works. I don't
dialog: want to shop at old lady stores. I
dialog: don't want to go to J. Jill and
dialog: Chicos and Ann Taylor Loft. I'm not
dialog: ready yet. I need two more years.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: That is so insane, it kind of makes
dialog: sense.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What did you get me for my
dialog: birthday?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I thought you said that we
dialog: shouldn't get each other gifts this
dialog: year?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What do you mean? You're supposed
dialog: to get me a surprise gift. This is

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: JASON

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It's not really a team, it's just a
dialog: bunch of guys who get together and
dialog: ride.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: I know, I know.
text: A car makes a right turn in front of Pete, nearly hitting

speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: So why on earth is Pete taking
dialog: Viagra? What's going on?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I don't know. I think maybe he just
dialog: isn't attracted to me anymore.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: That is ridiculous. If you were my
dialog: girlfriend, I would not need a
dialog: Viagra. I would need an anti-Viagra
dialog: pill. To try not to get a boner.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: But everyone gives you a boner.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Don't sell yourself short like
dialog: that. You give me a boner.
dialog: (whispers)
text: Barb doesn't give me a boner.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Maybe things are just getting
dialog: stale. That's why maybe I work out
dialog: really hard. Maybe he'll be able to
dialog: get a boner again.
speaker_heading: BARB
dialog: Why do you need to have sex, Deb?
dialog: Sex is the number one thing people

speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: BARB (CONT'D)
dialog: You stop having sex, there will be
dialog: no more fights. I am living proof.
dialog: I have no sex, and I am the
dialog: happiest I've ever been.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: I knew it. I knew you were not
dialog: having sex. I can see it on your
text: face. It's all puckered and pained.
speaker_heading: BARB
dialog: I'm enjoying our non-sex period,
dialog: that's all I'm saying.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Don't you miss it?
speaker_heading: BARB
dialog: Well, I wouldn't know, because I
dialog: don't have any feeling down there
dialog: anymore. I have nerve damage from
dialog: my C-section so everything is just
dialog: kinda-
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
text: She's numb down there.
speaker_heading: BARB
dialog: I could sit down hard on a fire
dialog: hydrant, and I wouldn't even know
dialog: that I was sitting. I could get
dialog: stung by a hornet down there, and I
dialog: would not feel it. You could put
dialog: anything in there, and I would not
dialog: know what the object was. I used to
dialog: pee in a nice stream, and now it
dialog: just kind of goes like a shower
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: That is the saddest thing I've ever
dialog: heard.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I think you need a family. Don't
dialog: you want a family?
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: No, I think I want to Clooney it.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Clooney it?

speaker_heading: JASON

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: No, he's not.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: See, I think he has sad eyes.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Aw, you sweet little thing. He's
dialog: doing sad, lonely eyes. To get the
dialog: next lady. I can do it too, watch.
text: Jason demonstrates.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I bet George Clooney is really
text: lonely. Just him and his pig.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: You'd fuck him.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I wouldn't.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: So would you.
speaker_heading: BARB
dialog: I would. I wouldn't feel it but-
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: You'd fuck him with your numb
dialog: vagina. Yes, you would. Ocean's

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

scene_heading: INT. STARBUCKS - MOMENTS LATER
text: Pete and Barry eat frosted scones, happy to get some alone
dialog: time to delay their return home.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: I mean that was idiotic. You have
dialog: to understand. That's like the one
dialog: thing you don't do is tell her you
dialog: used Viagra. I think that's even on
dialog: the warning label.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We're in one of those phases where
dialog: everything the other person says
dialog: just annoys the shit out of each
dialog: other. All the time. It's a blast.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Don't worry about it. You just
dialog: gotta ride that out.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: This sounds terrible but do you
dialog: ever wonder what it would be like
dialog: if, say, you were separated by
text: something bigger, like death. Like
dialog: her death?
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: I have given it a fair amount of
dialog: thought.
speaker_heading: PETE
text: Not in a painful way. Just quietly
text: slid into death. Like a gas leak.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Absolutely. It has got to be
dialog: peaceful. I mean this is the mother
dialog: of your children.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I'd want it to be a peaceful --
dialog: just like, drift, into a coma, from
text: which she never awakens.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Then you move on. Then you're a
dialog: widower.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: That's just it. People love
dialog: widowers.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: They love widowers. It's like the
dialog: polar opposite of divorced guys.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It's the best.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: It's like, oh, that poor widower.
dialog: You know. If I could only--
speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: BARRY

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Did you know that the Pixies did
dialog: this song about a Salvador Dali
dialog: short film called "Un Chien
dialog: Andalou"?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: This music doesn't make people
dialog: happy.
speaker_heading: PETE
text: This song kicks off Doolittle, one

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: SADIE

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: How many are there?
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: A hundred and fourteen?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Are you kidding me? You can't watch
dialog: over a hundred episodes of a show
dialog: in five weeks. It'll melt your
dialog: brain.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: It's not melting my brain, it's
dialog: blowing my mind.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: That's really bad, Sadie. You're
dialog: not allowed to do that.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: My relationship with Lost is not

speaker_heading: DESI
dialog: Jodi? Oh, Jodi's my new BFF. She's

speaker_heading: JODI

speaker_heading: DESI

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Huh.
text: Debbie goes behind the register. She looks at Jodi.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE (CONT'D)

dialog: do the sidewalk sale? And you
dialog: really need to pay attention to the
dialog: numbers because we have twelve
dialog: thousand dollars unaccounted for.
speaker_heading: JODI
dialog: I think it's probably Desi. She's

speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: JODI (CONT'D)
dialog: It's because she's stupid. I think

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: She's not stealing. She's our best
dialog: employee. She made nine grand last
dialog: month.
speaker_heading: JODI
dialog: Well, how much did I make?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You brought in twenty-two hundred.
speaker_heading: JODI

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What? Why are you looking?
speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
text: Maybe she's wearing dark underwear.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah. Maybe she has underwear that

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Stop looking.
text: Desi comes down to help a CUSTOMER at the front of the store.
speaker_heading: DESI

dialog: today.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Give me a break.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Why is your instinct to escape?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It's not my instinct to escape from
dialog: you. It is my instinct to come into
dialog: the bathroom when I need to go to
dialog: the bathroom.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: How come I don't smell anything?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It's because I shoved an Altoid up

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Let me see then.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Let me see!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No, I'm not going to let you see.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE

dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You know, when I started this
dialog: label, my dream was to work with
dialog: musicians and bands whose music I
dialog: just admired so much. The person
dialog: that I thought, "My god, wouldn't
dialog: it be incredible to work with" was
dialog: Graham Parker. Tonight we have him.
dialog: Solo. Because we couldn't afford to
dialog: fly in The Rumour.
text: The crowd applauds as Graham Parker (60's) leaps on stage.
text: Pete and Debbie watch Graham sing a very moving song. The
text: song is fantastic and personal, but clearly not commercial.
text: We watch Debbie. Although the music is great, it's a little
text: depressing and not working on her. She quickly gets bored.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
text: Pete and Debbie are driving home.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: It's just not my kind of music.

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I like Lady Gaga.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Oh, god, of course you do.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PETE
text: Shallow dance music.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: It's not! It's fun, and it's about
dialog: release and sex and power.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You know, you don't have to like
dialog: it. It's really not for you, that's
dialog: fine.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: This is a job. This is not a hobby.
dialog: Can't you love him just as a hobby?
dialog: And sign a fifteen-year-old hot
dialog: girl so we can eat?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Graham Parker and The Rumour had
dialog: two albums in the Rolling Stone Top
dialog: 500 Best Albums of All Time. Two of

speaker_heading: DEBBIE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: PETE

text: Pete puts on "Rooster" by Alice In Chains.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is called good music. From

speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: This is bumming me out. This isn't
dialog: fun.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Just listen to these words, okay?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I don't understand the words.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: This is lyrics, this is poetry.
dialog: This is what is going to survive in

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: It just doesn't make people happy.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It makes me happy. I can dance to

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL - MORNING

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

scene_heading: PREGNANT FIFTY-YEAR-OLD PARENT

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: TEACHER

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Oh. We are on time.

speaker_heading: TEACHER

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: TEACHER

dialog: forty?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: GRANDMA MOLLY
dialog: I remember when I was forty, and
dialog: then I blinked and there I was,
dialog: going to be ninety. My god, where
dialog: did it go? One day you're going to
dialog: blink, and you're going to be
dialog: ninety, and I won't be around to
dialog: see it. And that makes me very sad.
dialog: I'm telling you, I'm warning you.

speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT (O.C.)

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Oh, god. I can't tell Debbie.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT (O.C.)
dialog: You have to tell her, Pete.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: She knows it's bad, but she has no

speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT (O.C.)
dialog: If you sell the house, it'll really

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No. Debbie's not really into

speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT (O.C.)

speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT (O.C)

text: Pete is with RONNIE and CAT, employees at his record label.
text: They are watching an electronic press kit cut together for
text: Graham Parker. There is a montage of him performing
dialog: throughout the years from the seventies to the present.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: I'm contextualizing him as one of
dialog: the great figures in rock history.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: You can't show him in his prime in
text: `77 and then jump straight to him
dialog: as he is now. It's terrifying. You
dialog: have to reverse it. You've got to
text: show him as he is now very briefly,
dialog: and then show him in 1977. You have
text: to "Benjamin Button" it.
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about, okay? All rock stars are
dialog: older now. Steven Tyler, David
dialog: Bowie, Mick Jagger--
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Paul McCartney.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Okay, stop it. Everybody you're
text: mentioning looks like an old woman
dialog: now. You're just mentioning a bunch
dialog: of Jessica Tandys. Keith Richards
dialog: gets away with it. But that's
dialog: because Keith Richards looked
dialog: seventy when he was forty, and now
dialog: that he's seventy, he looks sixty-
text: nine. He's regenerating.
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: I like it. And I think Graham
dialog: Parker is sexy.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Would you fuck him?
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: You'd fuck him, and you won't fuck
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: I mean, I kind of fucked you once,
dialog: if you could have finished.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Oh, I finished.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You know what, enough of who fucked
dialog: who and who finished what.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: I finished.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Look. It's a retro label. That's
dialog: our niche. That's our market. It
dialog: costs money to break new bands, I
dialog: can't do that.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Oh, okay. And also you're the guy
dialog: who turned down Arcade Fire.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Everyone turned down Arcade Fire.
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: It's crazy, there are so many of
dialog: them!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We don't have the money to market a
dialog: new band. We just need to make
dialog: Graham seem relevant. Who is he
dialog: talking to?
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: Um, the Jewish Journal.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: The Jewish Journal?
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Apparently old Jews are the only
dialog: ones who still buy hard copies of
dialog: records. Because they don't like to
dialog: download music. Because they don't
dialog: know what downloading means.
text: Angle on Graham and a journalist wearing a yarmulke.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

text: Angle on Pete, Cat and Ronnie.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What is he wearing?
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: CAT
text: It's a hat with the Oreo logo on
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: I don't think he's being ironic, I
dialog: think he just really likes Oreos.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Look. The Paul Westerberg record
dialog: did okay. Frank Black did all
dialog: right. The Haircut 100, not so
dialog: much. We have to break this record.
dialog: Otherwise, we're not here next
dialog: year.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
text: He's coming. Oreo man is coming.
text: Graham walks up.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Hey guys, how are you?
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Aren't cookies the best?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Yeah. Jewish Journal guy loves the

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Great!
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Got a bit of a problem. Touch of
dialog: gout.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Gout?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Yeah, my whole family, they all had
dialog: gout.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: That's very unfortunate.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: My auntie Queenie, she had a foot

speaker_heading: RONNIE

text: gout foot.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: A couple of bunions as well.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Fuck.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I've got to go to the podiatrist,

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah, well, let's get you to the

speaker_heading: CAT

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: The happiest period in people's
dialog: lives is from age forty to sixty.
dialog: So this is it. We're in it, right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Says who?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Says a lot of people, most people.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Huh.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: We have everything we need right
dialog: now to be completely happy. We're
text: going to blink and be ninety.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: So, let's just choose to be happy.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
text: Your eyes are kind of glazing over.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No, I'm just processing it all.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Some of these I wrote for you. So,
dialog: we have to exercise every day.
dialog: Spend more time alone together. We
dialog: have to go to the therapist every
dialog: week.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: That's a little pricey.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: No stressing over tiny things.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah, that's good. You should do
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: We have to get more involved in
dialog: school. Have more patience with the
dialog: kids. And we need to work on our
dialog: anger.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah, I think it would be good if
dialog: you could take care of your anger.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: No, I said both of us.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: That's what I said. Our anger.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Okay. No more smoking.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah, you've got to cut that out.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I don't want to make this about a
dialog: fight, I want to just be positive.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Okay, and then no more holding on
dialog: to resentments. We have to just let
dialog: that go.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: So, you're saying that if we're
dialog: arguing and I apologize, you'll let
dialog: it go and not throw it back in my
dialog: face later?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Well, I don't do that, but I will
dialog: continue not to do that. What did
dialog: you write?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: All of that. That's plenty. That's
dialog: a lot.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: And you're going to eat better?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Oh, yeah. I've been doing a decent
dialog: job, but I don't think there's
dialog: anything wrong with having some
text: fries every now and again.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: And then I'll smoke that day.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: That's not the same thing.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: It is the same thing.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I like fries.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: And the other thing is your dad
dialog: stuff.
text: Pete picks up a guitar and starts playing with it.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE (CONT'D)
dialog: The not letting him guilt trip you
dialog: all the time, because that puts a
dialog: lot of pressure on you, and the
dialog: whole family feels it. He's a grown
dialog: man, and he's not our
dialog: responsibility. And you're not
dialog: giving him money anymore, right?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No, I haven't been giving him money
dialog: for years, I told you.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Can you please put that down?

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Twelve thousand dollars.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Oh, god. And Desi's taking it?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Well, I don't know. That's what
dialog: Jodi said.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We really need the store to work.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: It is. Don't put that kind of
dialog: pressure on me.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: That's not what I mean.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Are you nervous about money? Are we
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah. Maybe we just suck it up
text: because she's clearly earning so
dialog: much more than any other employee
dialog: we have.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Oh, yeah. For sure. We can't fire
dialog: her. We're barely breaking even
text: with her.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: That's why we have to keep her.
text: We watch the footage and suddenly Desi's BOYFRIEND enters. He
text: walks behind the counter, and she sits on his lap. She
text: adjusts herself.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Look at this, she's making out with
dialog: somebody.
text: On the screen, they kiss. Desi seems to be popping up and
text: down a little.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Is she screwing him??
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: That might be like a dry hump.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
text: Look at the position of her skirt.
speaker_heading: PETE
text: That's too grainy to know for sure.
dialog: Oh my god, this is the middle of

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
text: At least she's getting some.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What did you say? "At least she's
dialog: getting some"?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What are you talking about? We had
dialog: sex the other night. You have to
dialog: give me a little credit for that.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: It's not about credit. We need to
dialog: have more passion. Like this.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: That's not passion.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: It looks like passion to me.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What--
text: Pete farts.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: What is she doing?

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Don't fart in the bed!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I'm not, it's the springs.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Hey, Boychik.
text: A low flying 747 lets us know he lives too close to the
text: airport in a small house.
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: That's the eleven o'clock from
dialog: London.
dialog: (yells up at the plane)
dialog: Drop something valuable, you shit.
dialog: (back to Pete)
dialog: How are you?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: That's loud.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Every eight minutes, buddy.
scene_heading: INT. LARRY'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Pete sits down and talks with Larry.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: You look pretty good. Your hair is
dialog: different.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah, I'm growing it out.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I'd get it cut.
speaker_heading: TRIPLET #1
dialog: Daddy, you never play with me.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I do but right now look who I'm
dialog: talking to. It's your brother.
speaker_heading: TRIPLET #1
dialog: You don't look like my brother.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I told you honey, that's because of
dialog: the egg donor. Remember?
speaker_heading: TRIPLET #1
dialog: I came from a test tube.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: How's business?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: It's not good. Nobody wants
dialog: curtains. They think of it like a
dialog: luxury. It's not a luxury. You need
dialog: shade, you need privacy. Who wants
dialog: to have other people watch you
dialog: fuck?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I know how you feel. You know my
dialog: business is going through some
text: growing pains right now.
text: Two other identical children enter and jump on Larry.
speaker_heading: TRIPLET #2
dialog: Daddy come play with us.
text: The kids crawl around on him.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Be careful, don't jump on Daddy.
dialog: Remember, Daddy has high blood
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: TRIPLETS
dialog: Blood pressure.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: That's right. Can you go outside
dialog: without me for a little bit?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: All right? Do the Three Stooges
dialog: routine you were practicing.
text: The three exit.
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't tell them apart. I swear to
dialog: god. I need tattoos.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Look, I wanted to talk to you about
dialog: scaling back a little bit. You
dialog: know, Deb and I are thinking about
dialog: selling the house.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I think that house is more than you
dialog: need. I think it was too big of a
dialog: purchase when you made it.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah. In the meantime, I'm going to
dialog: have to make some changes. Going to
dialog: have to cut back.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: With you.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Oh. I'm sorry, what?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I can't lend you any more money.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: No, that's a bad idea. That's not
dialog: the way to cut back. I have three
dialog: children, here.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What about Claire? Why can't she
dialog: get a job?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Claire takes care of your brothers.
dialog: What do you want her to do? If she
dialog: goes to work, then I've got to hire
dialog: somebody.
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Well you've got to figure something
dialog: out because I can't do it.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Okay, fine. Why don't we kill them?
dialog: Come on, we'll kill two of them.
dialog: I'll keep the best one. Really, it
dialog: will save us both a lot of trouble.
text: Larry stands up and walks outside. Pete follows.
scene_heading: EXT. LARRY'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS
text: Larry prepares to spray the kids with the hose.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Line up! Line up for murder! Come
dialog: on! Who wants to be killed?
speaker_heading: TRIPLET #1
dialog: I do!
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Okay, we're eliminating one, we're
dialog: cheaper already.
text: Larry sprays him with the hose.
speaker_heading: TRIPLET #2
dialog: Murder me!
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Boom, dead. You're dead.
speaker_heading: TRIPLET #2
dialog: I'm dead!
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: All right, the kids are murdered.
dialog: That will save us some money.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Why would you have three kids,
dialog: anyway? I mean, you're sixty years
dialog: old. You have no money.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Because Claire wanted a baby. If we
dialog: didn't at least try, she would have
dialog: left me. She was forty-five years
dialog: old. Nobody thought it would take.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: The doctor when we were doing in
text: vitro was winking at me like,
dialog: "Don't worry, don't worry." We were
dialog: very unlucky. And now we have these
dialog: three beautiful children... Come
dialog: on, I've got to tell you something.
scene_heading: INT. LARRY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Your mother wanted you aborted.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Oh, Jesus Christ.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: It's the truth. It was the
dialog: seventies. We were twenty-two years
dialog: old. That's what everybody did. You
dialog: did some blow, had sex, had an
dialog: abortion.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Yes. We were on the way to the
dialog: doctor's office. I said, "Let's
dialog: stop, have a pizza, talk about it,
dialog: if you still want to do it after
dialog: lunch, it's okay." The pizza saved
dialog: your life. But don't give me money.
dialog: Because I'm not worth it.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: So how much do I owe you for saving
dialog: my life?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I don't have a number. You just
dialog: keep giving like you're giving.
text: Larry's wife, CLAIRE, enters.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh, hi Pete.
dialog: (to Larry)
dialog: Why aren't you playing with kids?
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: We were playing with them all day.
dialog: Pete's just talking to me about his
dialog: fortieth birthday party... Whatever
dialog: I can do to help.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Okay. Did you feed them?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I fed half of one. Okay, let's feed
dialog: them. Who wants tuna with a side of

scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - LATER
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: So how's Sony treating Pete?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Oh, he's not with Sony anymore. He
dialog: went out on his own. Now he's able
dialog: to focus on the artists that he's
dialog: really passionate about.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: How's Sadie doing? Last time I saw
text: her she was throwing her Cheerios
dialog: on the floor. What a mess.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: She just got her period.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Well. I guess she's not a little
dialog: baby anymore.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: It would be nice to see more of
dialog: each other.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Well, we can certainly arrange for
dialog: that. I'd love to see the girls.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: That would be nice. Do you have a
dialog: good day?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I would say the weekends, but our
dialog: weekends are hell. Soccer
dialog: competitions, kids exams. I mean,
dialog: we're both so busy. I have young
dialog: children, you have young children.
dialog: I don't think we should judge
dialog: ourselves too harshly about that.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I know, I wasn't. I'm glad we're
dialog: here. I think this is a good start
dialog: and that if we can spend more time
dialog: together, it would be nice.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: It would be nice.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Do you want to see pictures of the
dialog: kids?
text: Oliver takes out his iPhone and starts showing Debbie photos.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: This is Kell, my son.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: He's handsome. He's thirteen?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Yeah. And that's Alexandra, my
dialog: daughter, she's a real
dialog: perfectionist. A lot like you.
dialog: That's the whole gang at Cabo.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Will you excuse me, dear? I've got
dialog: to use the restroom. Be right back.

scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The family's hanging out, relaxing at dinner.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Daddy and I are making some changes
dialog: so that we can be happier and
dialog: healthier, and we're starting with
dialog: this meal that I prepared.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I think it looks great.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Doesn't it look good?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What is that, grilled cheeses?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: No, baked tofu. It's actually
dialog: really tasty. And the lettuce is so
dialog: fresh and tasty that you forget how
dialog: good lettuce tastes on its own
dialog: without dressing.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah, dressing always gets in the
dialog: way of the natural taste of the
text: lettuce.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: And another thing we've decided is
dialog: to cut back on all of the
dialog: electronics we use. What we're
dialog: going to do is get rid of the wi-fi
dialog: and only use the computer from
text: eight to eight-thirty at night.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: How are we going to go on the
dialog: computer?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: We're going to have a hard line in
text: the kitchen.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah, we'll supervise that.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: You can't do this. You can't take
dialog: away the wi-fi.
text: Charlotte holds her iPhone to her face using an app that
text: animates her mouth to look like a talking monkey's.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: (from behind her iPhone)
dialog: No wi-fi! Ha-ha-ha!
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You don't spend enough time with
dialog: the family when you're constantly
dialog: on your iPhone and your computer.
dialog: You're only here five more years.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: So you won't see me after five
dialog: years?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: No, but you won't be living with
dialog: us. And you should get to know your
dialog: little sister.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You've got the perfect friend right
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: I don't want to be friends with her
dialog: now. I'll be friends with her when
text: she's twenty and a normal person.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I don't want to hang out with her
dialog: when I'm in my twenties.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You're on your computer too much as
dialog: it is. You need to get outside
dialog: more.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Yeah. You can build things. You can
dialog: build a fort.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Yeah, build a fort. Play with your
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: Make a fort?! Outside? And do what
dialog: in the fort?
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: When I was a kid we used to build
text: tree houses and play with sticks.
speaker_heading: SADIE
text: Nobody plays with sticks.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You and Charlotte can have a

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Play Kick the Can.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Look for dead bodies.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: It's fun.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Get a tire and then take a stick
text: and run down the street with it.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: Nobody does that crap. It's 2012.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You don't need technology.
text: Charlotte holds the iPhone monkey app to her lips again.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: No technology!
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Charlotte, put that down.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: I don't need to be monitored all
dialog: the time on the computer. I don't
dialog: do anything bad.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Nobody said you were bad.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: I don't do things I'm not supposed
dialog: to. I don't illegally download
dialog: music. I don't look at porn like
dialog: Wendy.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: She is up to no good. She's not
dialog: allowed to come over here anymore.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: What's porn?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No, she said "corn."
speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Them's little bitches.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I don't know, it makes no sense at

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
text: It makes no sense.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: When we get in a fight, look in my

dialog: right now and know that we never
dialog: have to fight.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: But you're such a dick sometimes.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I know, I am a dick sometimes.
dialog: People think I'm so nice, but I'm
dialog: such a dick.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Thank you for admitting that.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: And you get so mad at me. I feel
dialog: like you want to kill me.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I do want to kill you.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: How would you do it?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I don't know... poison you. I'd
dialog: poison your cupcakes that you
dialog: pretend not to eat everyday. And
dialog: just put enough in to slowly weaken
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I love it.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I would enjoy our last few months
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Me too.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Because you'd be so weak and sweet,
dialog: and I could take care of you but
dialog: while killing you.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: See? You know what I love about us?
dialog: You can still surprise me. I
dialog: figured for sure you'd knock me out
dialog: with one fell swoop. But you would
dialog: extend it over a series of months.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Have you ever thought about killing
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Oh, yeah.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Really?

dialog: Did you see Fargo?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Pete makes a wood chipping splatter noise.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Wow. That's a bad plan. The
dialog: cupcakes is a way better plan.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It is. You know what? I won't

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Aw. I love you.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Should we do it?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Let's eat the cookie, and then
dialog: we'll order a bunch of
dialog: cheeseburgers. Let's order the
text: entire room service menu.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Just get all of it. You deserve it.
dialog: You really do.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Wouldn't you rather have me around
dialog: for less years and I'm incredibly
dialog: happy than longer and miserable?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Yes, and I just realized that right
dialog: now. Go get the cookie!
text: Pete runs into the bathroom. He looks for the cookie.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Should we watch porn when we eat
dialog: the cookie?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Should we get a block of porn?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I don't think we need twenty-four
text: hours of porn.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah, but you know, two porns cost
text: about as much as a block.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I think that's too much porn.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We don't have to watch it all, but
dialog: for the value it makes sense.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER
text: Pete and Debbie eat the cookie.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: How much are we supposed to eat?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I don't know. I think like six or

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Plus, it's old. It probably has
dialog: lost some of its-
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Potency?
text: They sit in silence for an incredibly long amount of time,
text: staring through each other in a haze. They are stoned.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: We should have sex. More.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I mean, girls have it so easy. You
dialog: just show up with your sexual
dialog: organs and you're good to go. All
text: the pressure is on the guy.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: It's true.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: And I look at guys, like I look at
dialog: a guy like Prince, and you know
dialog: that guy fucks. I know I don't fuck
dialog: like Prince. Prince can fuck. I
dialog: fuck more like David Schwimmer.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You do.

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (to Pete)
dialog: I told you the pediatrician didn't

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Oh, come on. You can't blame it on

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Not in kids over six years old.
dialog: We're going to the Eastern doctor.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: If she's in this much pain, we

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I think I've got something in

dialog: something.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What are you doing with your phone?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Trying to take pictures of it, so I

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: DESI

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We expected more. I mean, I know

dialog: way under what we were looking for.
speaker_heading: REALTOR (O.C.)
dialog: I know, but based on the market,
dialog: it's like you're gaining money.
dialog: Because it's so much more than what
dialog: you deserve. But these people are
dialog: from Iran and they don't really
dialog: know that they're offering too
dialog: much. Is there any chance that

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Remember the Alamo?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Have you ever built a fort, Wendy?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Like on Facebook?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I will take this if you're going to

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: LARRY

speaker_heading: WENDY

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: But I get better grades than Wendy.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: She does. She's so smart.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Let me just grab the candy worms.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: Your rules are ridiculous.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Don't sass me.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: I'm only sassing you because you're

dialog: You're being stupid.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You do? He's making a "Hot or Not"
dialog: list.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: So, Sadie said, "That's so lame and
dialog: immature that you're doing that."
dialog: And then Joseph says, "Yo, girl.
dialog: We're just having some fun so don't
dialog: be a bitch, yo."
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: That is not nice.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: So, then Sadie said, "Don't call me
dialog: a bitch." And Joseph said, "I
dialog: didn't call you a bitch, I said
dialog: don't act like a bitch. And by the
dialog: way you're in the `Not Hot'
dialog: column."
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Who made him the judge of hot?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Do you realize what that could do
dialog: to her self-esteem?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What a little fuckhead. I'll kill
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: So then Sadie said, "You're in the

dialog: bored of you."
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: That is cool. That's taking the

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: For some reason, there's an

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I wonder what that means.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I don't think it means anything, I
dialog: think it's just adorable.

speaker_heading: PETE

dialog: after that?
speaker_heading: RONNIE (O.C.)
dialog: There are zeros, but all of them
dialog: are before six hundred and twelve.
dialog: There are none after.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: How is that even possible?
speaker_heading: RONNIE (O.C.)
dialog: Out of three hundred million
dialog: Americans, six hundred and twelve
dialog: people chose to download the album.
dialog: You could personally call everyone

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We're fucked! Here's the deal. I

dialog: list of at least thirty ideas of

speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: We heard.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You heard.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: And they're bad. You know, it's

text: creating a strain.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: How much have we lent him?
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Eighty thousand.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Did you say "eight thousand" or
dialog: "eighty thousand"?
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Eighty thousand, over the past
dialog: couple of years. And then you
dialog: missed the mortgage payment--
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: On the house?
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: And you missed the rental on the
dialog: office.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Does Pete know that?
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Oh, yeah. We're on the phone all

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: RONNIE

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Well, you're not giving me money.
dialog: You're giving me a project. I don't
dialog: know how to sell this. I'm not an

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Just sell it online. Do some

dialog: that too hard to do with your high

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: All right. Don't get snippy. Just
dialog: because you write a great song

speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: I think about that gray-haired

text: sitting in that scooter eating a
dialog: soft cracker." Kids don't want to
dialog: have old parents. You know, it
dialog: would also be nice for us to spend
dialog: some time apart. Kind of rediscover
dialog: who we are individually. It would
dialog: be so great to not see you for like

speaker_heading: JOSEPH

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

dialog: why? You look like a miniature Tom

dialog: think that haircut's cool? It's
dialog: not. It looks like you put your

speaker_heading: CATHERINE

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: If he insults my daughter again,

dialog: to do? I'm going to show up at your

dialog: I'll take your iPad and your iPod

speaker_heading: OLIVER

dialog: important part of the spectrum.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Do you operate every single day?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Most days.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Multiple times a day?
speaker_heading: OLIVER

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: So what's the price range? Like if
dialog: I wanted--
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Oh, I'd rather not say.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: It's so big you're embarrassed to

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I wouldn't say embarrassed.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Are there hunchbacks today?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I've never seen one.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Well, that's because there are

speaker_heading: LARRY

speaker_heading: JASON

speaker_heading: RONNIE

speaker_heading: DESI

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Wait. Forgive who?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I think she just meant generally.

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: My parents divorced when I was

dialog: like to work on that. Just like

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: It's been about seven years.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Seven years? That's a joke, right?

speaker_heading: LARRY

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Are you really about to hit up my
dialog: dad for money?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What? He does four operations a

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You can't buy forgiveness, right
dialog: Pete?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I don't think anyone's looking for

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: If you two are in a bind I'd be

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah.

speaker_heading: LARRY

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

dialog: broken inside. It's not your fault
dialog: you can't feel love. There's
dialog: something that you can't -- this is
dialog: coming out wrong.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You know what? I would rather have
dialog: my dad than your dad, because he
dialog: doesn't drive me crazy. You know
dialog: the best quality my father has? He
dialog: asks for nothing. I don't know what
dialog: the fuck he's thinking right now.
dialog: Look at that. Nothing. I don't even
dialog: know him. And I turned out
dialog: perfectly fine without his input.
speaker_heading: LARRY

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: Debbie and Larry sit in the waiting area of the hospital.
dialog: 140.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I guess the party didn't turn out
dialog: like you planned.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: It wasn't a good party.
text: A NURSE walks over to them.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Hi. I'll bring you in as soon as
text: his x-rays are finished.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Is he okay?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Yeah, he has a broken rib and he's
dialog: been crying a little bit, but he'll
dialog: be fine.
text: The Nurse walks away.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: You know Pete was never a real
dialog: fighter. But that's why he married
dialog: you. That's why he loves you.
dialog: Because you're the fighter, and you
dialog: need that. One person in a
dialog: relationship has got to punch.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Do you mean that in a good way?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Oh, it's a high compliment.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Listen, I know what you're worried
dialog: about. You think he's going to turn
dialog: into me, but I don't think it's
dialog: going to happen. He's smarter and
dialog: probably a little cuter. A little
text: less Jewy. Although, after fifty,
dialog: that's all going to change. Be
text: prepared to wake up one day with a
dialog: a rabbi. But the good news is,
dialog: he'll love you forever. That's in
dialog: our DNA. We stick around.
dialog: 141.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: He worries about you. It puts a lot
text: of pressure on him.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I know. I just don't have anyone
dialog: else to talk to about it.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You can talk to Claire.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: No. If I open up to her she'll
dialog: leave me.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: No, she won't, Larry, she loves
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I know, but there's a certain point
dialog: at which you just can't stay.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I guess it's hard to forgive
dialog: somebody if they don't formally
dialog: apologize to you.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Are you apologizing?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I'm very close.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yes, I'm sorry. And I'm glad
dialog: everybody's okay.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Thanks.
text: She hugs him and starts to cry a little bit.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I'm off.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: This is awkward.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What?
dialog: 142.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I need forty dollars for a cab.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: That's funny.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: No, I'm not kidding. You drove me.
dialog: I wasn't prepared.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I only have a hundred.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: That's okay. I'll bring you the
dialog: change.
text: He grabs the bill out of her purse and walks off.
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: All right, give him a kiss for me.

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I really liked our lives so much
dialog: better before we tried to change
dialog: everything. I'm sorry.
dialog: 143.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No. I'm sorry. I don't want to keep
dialog: anything from you. I love you.
dialog: You're my wife. I just didn't want
dialog: to let you down.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Are you mad that I'm pregnant?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No. I'm not mad. I'm thrilled.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You don't feel trapped?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Sometimes I feel like I trapped
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I don't feel trapped.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You should, because I've trapped
dialog: you. You can't go anywhere. I'm

dialog: years for the rest of your life.
dialog: You can never leave me. Ever.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I never feel trapped by you. I'm so
dialog: happy to be with you. I love you so
dialog: much. You're my favorite person in
dialog: the whole world. god damn it, why
dialog: am I crying like this? Something is
dialog: wrong with me.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You're pregnant.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Oh, yeah. Shit. I was just outside
dialog: telling your dad that I liked him.
dialog: What if he thinks I like him now?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No, he won't think that.
dialog: 144.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I don't want him to think I like
dialog: him that much.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It'll never happen.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (suddenly giddy)
dialog: Can you believe it? This is the
dialog: craziest thing ever. What are we
dialog: going to do with a third baby?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I have no idea. How are we going to
dialog: afford it?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: We'll sell the house.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We don't have to.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: We kind of do.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We kind of do.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: We'll make new memories in a new
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Is there anything you want to do
dialog: for your birthday? It's been the
dialog: worst birthday ever.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: There is one thing, but I don't
dialog: think you'll like it.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I wouldn't mind going to see some
dialog: music. Would you want to do that?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 145.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Really? I don't believe you, but
dialog: you're sweet for saying that.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: How do we break you out of here?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I can just leave on my own
dialog: volition. It's not a mental
dialog: institution.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Can you?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It's not like One Flew Over the
dialog: Cuckoo's Nest. Please don't put a
text: pillow over my face.
text: Debbie laughs.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Let's get out of here, McMurphy.
speaker_heading: PETE
