scene_heading: EXT. BOYLESTON STREET, BOSTON -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: The boulevard is empty, eerie silence. No cars, no people. A man
text: walks down the middle of the street, long trench, dark shades.
text: Though he does not speak, we hear...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN V.O.
dialog: There's two kinds of people in this
dialog: world when you boil it all down. You
dialog: got your talkers and you got your
dialog: doers.
dialog: 
text: We recognize this man as ROCCO. He crosses Copley Square toward the
text: looming dome of the Trinity Church.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCCO V.O.
dialog: Most people are just talkers. All they
dialog: got is talk. But when all's said and
dialog: done, it is the doers who change the
dialog: world. And when they do that, they
dialog: change us. That's why we never forget
dialog: them...So, which one are you? Do you
dialog: just talk about it? Or do you stand up
dialog: and do something about it? Because
dialog: believe you me all the rest of it is
dialog: just coffee house bullshit.
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DEEP COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUBTEXT: "Ireland"
dialog: 
text: From behind we see two men perched atop a boulder. A flock of sheep
text: encircles them. Their army sacks and shotguns are nearby. They roll
text: their own cigarettes with effortless synchronicity and light up.
text: CONNOR and MURPHY MacMANUS (30's) now have long hair with heavy
text: facial growth. Rugged. Piercing eyes. Looking to the horizon...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Looks like a storm's comin'.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONNOR
dialog: Aye.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FIELDS -- LATER
dialog: 
text: MOODY MUSIC: The brothers drive the flock across jewel green hills.
text: Murphy cuts a sheep from a thicket and sets it off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POPPA M V.O.
dialog: Peace, they say, is the enemy of
dialog: memory. So it had been for my boys.
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Connor shares some jerky with a sheep dog as the flock surges.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
dialog: For some time now, their past had felt
text: like a dream to them...faded and worn.
dialog: 
text: Murphy touches the faded Celtic Cross tattoo on his forearm. Connor
text: sees. The music takes us to a secluded, pioneer-esque ranch.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: POPPA M's (58yrs) face as he coughs and watches his sons
text: approach from his rocking chair on the porch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
dialog: And then suddenly, as if not a day had
dialog: passed...it was back. I could see it
text: in their eyes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Poppa M and his sons eat a rustic dinner. It storms outside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POPPA M V.O.
dialog: I could feel it, heavy in their
text: presence. Something calling them back.
dialog: 
text: Poppa M looks to his boys who just keep eating. DIP TO BLACK...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- NEXT MORNING
dialog: 
text: Very early dawn, shadowy morning light. Connor and Murphy sip
text: coffees and look out into the rain. Lightening lights up the flock.
dialog: 
text: Through the open door behind them, Poppa M stokes a warm fire.
dialog: 
text: Connor touch the Celtic Cross tattoo on his forearm. The boys look
text: at each other as the rain suddenly stops and all the "little sounds"
text: of morning cease. Something's amiss. Thunder. Ominous music as...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BOSTON, TRINITY CHURCH -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: From behind, we see a man with a CREW CUT, staring at the dome of
dialog: the Trinity.
dialog: 
text: SLO-MO, CLOSE ON: Crew Cut's boots as he paces toward. The
text: threatening music bleeds over to...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FARM -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Just inside the trees, a pack of wolves stalk the sheep flock...
dialog: 
text: SLO-MO, CLOSE ON: A wolf's paws as it paces toward...
dialog: 
text: We intercut between BOSTON and IRELAND as chaos erupts...
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BOSTON: Crew Cut quickly enters the church.
dialog: 
text: IRELAND: The wolves burst from the tree line.
dialog: 
text: BOSTON: A frantic priest in his 50's weeps and begs as Crew Cut
text: slams him to his knees with a .9 mm to his head.
dialog: 
text: IRELAND: The wolves savagely attack the screaming sheep.
dialog: 
text: BOSTON: Muzzle flash, blood splatters on the altar.
dialog: 
text: IRELAND: BOOM! BOOM! Connor and Murphy blast shotguns at the
text: wolves. One is hit, the rest retreat. The boys perform mercy
text: killings on the wolf and one sheep.
dialog: 
text: Everything calms as Poppa M rushes up with a mag light and stops.
text: He coughs roughly. Moody choral music begins...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POPPA M V.O.
dialog: "And they cried out, How long O'Lord
dialog: dost thou not judge and revenge our
dialog: blood upon them that dwell on the
dialog: earth?"
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD -- LATER
dialog: 
text: The boys toss the wolf carcass onto a bonfire. It rains again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POPPA M V.O.
dialog: And God said, "All will fear the wrath
dialog: of the lamb. For the great day of
dialog: their reckoning hath come."
dialog: 
text: Poppa M looks across the blaze to his sons. Connor and Murphy stare
text: into the fire, bathed in the light of angry flames.
speaker_heading: POPPA M
dialog: "And they that holdest my name shall
dialog: come with the shaking of the earth and
dialog: the roiling of the oceans."
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FARM -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Downpour. A rugged old jeep tears through the mud. It stops at the
text: farmhouse. Poppa M and the boys come out onto the porch. A dark
text: figure with a fedora and rain slicker exits the jeep and hurries to
text: the porch. Meet Uncle SIBEAL (62yrs). He wears a priest's collar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIBEAL
dialog: Something's happened.
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: Breaking news. REPORTER #1 is live from outside a church. Squads,
text: coroner's vans, CSI etc. Police hold back crowds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER #1
dialog: There is no new information on the
dialog: victim found slain this morning inside
dialog: Trinity Church. As you can see the
dialog: size of the crowd here has increased
dialog: substantially over the last couple of
text: hours. People are demanding answers as
dialog: to how a priest could be murdered in a
dialog: church. But perhaps more shocking, we
dialog: have confirmed that the body was
text: ritualized with pennies in the eyes.
dialog: Many remember this as the grisly
dialog: calling card of the prolific vigilante
dialog: killers known as the Saints, who went
text: on a murder spree here in Boston.
dialog: 
text: NEWS FOOTAGE: People scream as they run out of a courthouse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER #1 V.O.
dialog: A rampage that ended six years ago,
text: when the Saints brazenly walked into
dialog: open court...
dialog: 
text: NEWS FOOTAGE: A body is wheeled out on a gurney.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER #1 V.O. (CONT'D)
dialog: ...and executed Mafia Don, Poppa Joe
text: Yakavetta before a courtroom of
text: terrified witnesses, then simply
dialog: disappeared without a trace.
text: Grainy, unclear security footage of three men walking the court
text: halls, two in heavy black jackets, one in a trench...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER #1 V.O. (CONT'D)
dialog: The now legendary security camera
dialog: footage from that harrowing day, our
dialog: singular tiny glimpse of these infamous
dialog: and controversial killers.
dialog: 
dialog: We are back with Reporter #1 at the church.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER #1
dialog: As police have yet to confirm the
dialog: Saints' possible involvement, the
text: ominous question hangs heavy in the
dialog: air. "Are they back?"
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Sibeal, Poppa M, Connor and Murphy sit around the table. The boys
text: have a look of controlled anger. Presently...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: The priest. Did they release his name?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIBEAL
dialog: No. But I made a few calls, still got
dialog: some friends in the diocese there.
text: McKinney. Father Douglas McKinney.
dialog: 
text: The boys flash with recognition.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIBEAL (CONT'D)
dialog: You knew him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONNOR
dialog: Knew of him. Everybody did. A regular
dialog: Mother Theresa. Youth hostels, soup
dialog: kitchens. Even made it into the
dialog: newspapers sometimes.
dialog: 
text: Sibeal considers this. He genuflects and turns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIBEAL
dialog: Listen boys. I think it's best that ya
dialog: just stay put and we'll try ta figure
dialog: out what...
dialog: 
text: Connor and Murphy are out the door and headed for the barn.
text: Confused, Sibeal looks to Poppa M, who just sips his coffee.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BARN -- MOMENTS LATER
text: MOODY MUSIC: The boys begin to look more like "themselves" as the
text: they cut their hair and beards with sheep sheers.
dialog: 
text: The brothers lift a chest from a hole in the barn floor. They load
text: guns and money into black duffel bags and place their signature
text: rosaries around their necks, clasping their hands in prayer...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRINITY CHURCH, ALTER -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Detective GREENLY (38yrs) is alone on the alter. Police line all
text: around as Greenly stares at the body like the detective has seen a
text: ghost. He turns and nervously staggers toward the front vestibule.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VESTIBULE -- SAME TIME
dialog: 
text: Detectives DOLLY and DUFFY are scared. In hushed tones...
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: We need to keep our heads, here. It's
dialog: probably not even them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOLLY
dialog: Of course it ain't them but that
dialog: doesn't really matter, does it. Our
text: skeletons just came screaming out of
dialog: the closet. We're fucked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: We're not fucked.
dialog: 
text: Greenly enters from the church proper. Dolly and Duffy turn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREENLY
dialog: We are totally fucked!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RAPID FLASHBACK SEQUENCE, "ACCESSORY TO MURDER"
dialog: 
text: Greenly, disguised as a correctional officer, lets Connor, Murphy
text: and Poppa M out of a paddywagon. FLASH!
dialog: 
text: The Saints enter the Suffolk Courthouse, undetected. FLASH!
dialog: 
text: Dolly, dressed as a civilian, pulls the fire alarm. FLASH!
dialog: 
text: The Saints execute Poppa Joe Yakavetta before many terrified
text: witnesses, the alarm blaring in the b.g. FLASH!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BACK TO PRESENT, VESTIBULE -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREENLY
dialog: ...and not just fucked, like elephant
dialog: dick, pounded in the ass, no reach
dialog: around, jungle fucked!
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Now's not the time to panic, Green
dialog: beans!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREENLY
dialog: Oh, I disagree. Now's the perfect time
dialog: to panic. We're all Accessories to...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOLLY
dialog: Don't you fucking say it!
dialog: 
text: They all argue over one another. OFFICER #1 peaks his head in the
text: front door. The detectives grind to a halt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER #1
text: Her E.T.A. is ten minutes.
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVEYARD -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: a gravestone. "Paul M. Smecker, 1956 - 2003"
dialog: 
text: We reveal a pair of sexy female legs, expensive "Jimmy Choo" heels.
text: From behind we see the woman rest a rose at Smecker's Grave. "Legs"
text: turns and walks toward a waiting squad car in b.g.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Dolly, Duffy and Greenly stand outside in the entry way of the
text: church. Though still on edge, they have calmed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOLLY
dialog: I didn't even know he had a protege.
dialog: What is this bullshit?
dialog: 
text: Duffy whips out his trusty note pad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Special Agent Eunice Bloom, 32 years
dialog: old. Smecker plucked her right out of
dialog: class at Quantico.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREENLY
dialog: Smecker hand picked her? Aw, man.
dialog: This brawd's gonna be a nightmare.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: She was assigned to OCD two years back.
text: She can shoot a gun, set three course
dialog: records during her training.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREENLY
dialog: Great. A bull dike, Annie Oakley wanna-
dialog: be. We gotta get rid of her.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: She is also an authority on the Saints
dialog: case. Which means Smecker must have
text: walked her through it.
dialog: 
text: The cops suddenly flush with fear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOLLY
dialog: And the hits just keep on comin'.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Sibeal waits as Poppa M thinks, then shakes his head.
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POPPA M
dialog: Naw...I'm in no condition. I'd just
dialog: slow 'em down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIBEAL
dialog: Well, are ya at least gonna try ta talk
dialog: them out of this?
dialog: 
text: Poppa M shakes his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIBEAL (CONT'D)
dialog: We don't even know what this is yet!
dialog: Somebody could just be tryin' ta get
dialog: away with murder here!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POPPA M
dialog: Aye. Only there's about a thousand
dialog: easier ways ta do that. Trust me.
dialog: Someone's callin' them out, Sibeal. Ya
dialog: kill a priest in a church and make it
dialog: look like they did it. Bring 'em back
dialog: with a vengeance. Don't know who.
dialog: Don't know why. But someone thinks
dialog: he's real fuckin' clever. Only one
dialog: problem with his little plan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIBEAL
dialog: What's dat?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POPPA M
dialog: It worked.
dialog: 
text: Fear and frustration burst from Sibeal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIBEAL
dialog: Jesus Christ! D'er's too much we don't
dialog: know and if you're won't at least try
dialog: ta talk some sense into them, I will!
dialog: 
text: The door opens and in comes Connor and Murphy. Sibeal notes the
text: change in appearance. The boys stand at the kitchen table's
text: opposing end, hands in their pockets. Their resolve fills the room.
dialog: 
text: The brothers face off with Poppa M and Sibeal: a bizarre board
text: meeting. Poppa M cocks a brow at Sibeal who clears his throat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIBEAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Exactly what do you intend to do?
dialog: 
text: Silence. Nobody moves. Connor withdraws a hand from his pocket and
text: looks down. He flips a penny on the table. It clatters to a stop.
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Every last motherfucker that had
dialog: anything to do with it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH -- LATER
dialog: 
text: A squad pulls up. Dolly, Duffy and Greenly turn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOLLY
dialog: Game time. How are we playing this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Feds love to pull the divide and
dialog: conquer routine. We hard line her.
dialog: Stick together on this. Agreed?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOLLY
dialog: Agreed. We're a brick wall.
dialog: 
text: They all nod and stiffen their resolve.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREENLY
dialog: Let's rock this bitch.
dialog: 
text: Rockin' music fades in as a uniform opens the squad door.
dialog: 
text: SLO-MO: EUNICE BLOOM (32yrs) exits the squad and moves toward.
dialog: 
text: She is simply delicious: sexy, blonde hair, a woman's business
text: suit, short skirt, brass rimmed specs. Each detective's face drops.
text: Soon she is before them. Music cuts. She smiles and speaks with a
dialog: southern drawl a la Doc Holiday.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE
speaker_heading: (POINTING)
dialog: You hafta be Detectives Dolly and
dialog: Duffy. Am I right?
dialog: (extending hand)
dialog: Eunice Bloom. A pleasure.
dialog: 
text: Dolly and Duffy shake and manage a nod. Greenly is still enamored.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE (CONT'D)
dialog: And you must be Greenly. Smecker
dialog: always said you were the funny one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREENLY
dialog: T'sup...I mean, what? Yeah, well,
dialog: funny as in ha ha, though not like
dialog: funny as in gay cuz...I'm not...played
dialog: high school football.
dialog: 
text: She chuckles. Dolly and Duffy fume.
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOLLY
dialog: Look, with all due respect, Agent
dialog: Bloom...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE
dialog: Special.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOLLY
dialog: Excuse me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE
dialog: You see there's a "special" before my
dialog: "agent." If we are going to address
dialog: each other formally, I'd prefer if you
dialog: popped it in there. Makes me feel, I
dialog: don't know...special. Of course, I'd
dialog: hoped we could be a little more
dialog: personable. In fact, I'd like you to
dialog: call me Eunice.
dialog: 
text: The cops are dumbfounded. Duffy snaps out of it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: O'kay, Eunice. I don't see why the
dialog: fuck the Fed is...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE
dialog: Whoa, whoa, "fuck?" This isn't a
dialog: "fuck" situation, is it? I can see a
dialog: "God Damn" or two but why skip all the
dialog: way to "fuck" right off the bat? Let's
dialog: start slow and work our way up to it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: What is the Fed's interest in this?
text: The detectives harden, brick wall. Eunice furrows her brow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE
text: Their interest, Detective, is capturing
dialog: the men responsible for the murders of
dialog: 22 of Boston's finest criminals. Y'see
dialog: public perception is that these boys
dialog: stepped in, did our jobs for us and
dialog: then disappeared into thin air as we
text: fecklessly searched for them. The FBI
dialog: tends to take exception to such things.
dialog: They coulda sent anyone. They sent me.
dialog: Why do you think that is?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Well, since we've broken the "Fuck
dialog: Barrier," allow me to be blunt.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: EUNICE (CONT'D)
dialog: It is because I am so fucking smart
dialog: that I make smart people feel like
dialog: retards. Now, we seem to be getting
dialog: off on the wrong foot here. I'd
dialog: appreciate a bit of cooperation. Let's
dialog: chalk it up to paying respect to the
dialog: memory of a dearly departed mutual
dialog: friend. A man who taught me everything
dialog: I know.
dialog: 
text: After a moment of consideration, the cops concede with nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Lovely.
dialog: (re: crowd)
dialog: Now what's with the circus?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: The victim was killed late last night.
dialog: When people gathered for morning mass,
text: they found the front entrance chained
text: and padlocked. A locksmith came out,
text: cut the chain and surprise, surprise.
dialog: Cell phones. Half of them called the
text: cops. Half of them called the media.
dialog: But regardless...word's out.
dialog: 
text: Eunice turns and looks over the crowd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE
dialog: And it looks like that's just the way
dialog: somebody wanted it. What say we scrape
dialog: the shit off this cow's ass, fellas?
dialog: Detective Greenly? Escort a lady onto
dialog: the crime scene?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREENLY
dialog: What? No, yeah, no. Of course.
dialog: 
text: Greenly escorts her as Dolly and Duffy walk behind, mystified.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREENLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you want a cup of coffee or
dialog: something?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE
dialog: Never touch the stuff.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VESTIBULE -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Eunice stands, looking down the aisle at the altar. Behind her, the
text: Detectives are curios as Eunice slides on pink latex gloves.
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She puts in ear plugs and all ambient sound ceases. She starts
text: slowly down the aisle...
dialog: 
text: TOTAL SILENCE AS...Eunice inspects the smashed door of a
text: confessional booth. She looks over the body closely then turns from
text: the altar and walks to the detectives. She pulls her earplugs and
text: all sound returns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE
dialog: It wasn't them...but I'm sure you boys
dialog: already knew that.
dialog: 
text: The detectives nod.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUFFY
text: The two "V's." The victim and venue
dialog: don't add up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE
dialog: Let's go with the venue first. Our
dialog: perpetrators are devout. They would
dialog: never commit such an act on sacred
dialog: ground. And as for the victim?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOLLY
dialog: All their vics were criminals. Clearly
dialog: not the case here. So, it wasn't them
dialog: which means this is a local matter and
dialog: it falls under our jurisdiction. No
dialog: need for Federal involvement so with
dialog: all due respect...we'll see you later,
dialog: Special Agent Bloom.
dialog: 
text: Eunice stands right in front of Dolly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE
dialog: Man, I hate it when people say that.
dialog: "With all due respect." Because it is
text: inevitably followed by a disrespectful
dialog: remark. I'll give you an example.
dialog: With all due respect, Detective, this
dialog: matter falls under whatever
dialog: jurisdiction I fuckin' say it does.
dialog: 
text: Dolly fumes. Duffy and Greenly share an "oh shit" look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Uh, so...let's just...what can you tell
dialog: us about the shooters?
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE
dialog: Shoo-ter. Singular. And I can tell
dialog: you that he is left handed and how
dialog: shall I put this delicately...? He's a
dialog: short bastard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOLLY
speaker_heading: (FACETIOUS)
dialog: One guy, lefty, short. Got it.
dialog: 
text: Eunice furrows her brow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE
dialog: I'll show you what I'm talking about.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH, ALTAR -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Close up on Greenly's enraptured face. We pull back and see he is
text: on his knees before Eunice and staring longingly between her legs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE
dialog: Detective Greenly, you're the victim.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREENLY
dialog: David. You can call me David.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE
dialog: Very well, David.
dialog: 
text: Duffy and Dolly stand behind Greenly, chest to chest, each mimicking
text: guns to the back of the kneeling cop's head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE (CONT'D)
text: The Saints' signature stance. Copley
dialog: Plaza Hotel four years ago. Two men of
dialog: identical height put Yuri Petrova on
text: his knees and each dropped iron to the
text: back of his head.
dialog: 
text: This is torture for Greenly and he turns his head from Eunice's
text: crotch. She immediately adjusts him back into place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE (CONT'D)
text: Eyes front, David. The position of the
dialog: victim and the angles produced by the
dialog: killers' stance created a unique
text: scenario. The bullets criss crossed in
text: the skull and exited the eye sockets.
dialog: Here, this did not occur. The rounds
text: moved on a straight trajectory through
text: the back of the victim's head and out
dialog: the front. Which happens when...
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Eunice circles around, positioning herself between Dolly and Duffy.
text: She aims both hands to the back of Greenly's head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUFFY
text: ...one guy's holding two guns to the
dialog: back of your head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE
dialog: One guy.

scene_heading: INT. FLASHBACK, CHURCH -- NIGHT BEFORE
dialog: 
text: Crew Cut holds two guns to the back of the pleading priest's head.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BACK TO PRESENT, CHURCH -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE
dialog: Now, the victim falls forward. If you
dialog: please, David.
dialog: 
text: Greenly lays flat on his stomach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE (CONT'D)
text: The killer approached the body from the

dialog: (Eunice approaches)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUFFY
text: Left handed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EUNICE
dialog: Yep, southpaw.
scene_heading: INT. FLASHBACK, CHURCH -- NIGHT BEFORE
dialog:

text: Connor and Murphy are standing 25 feet behind them.

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: It's Irish for "You're fucked."
dialog: 
text: Hard core music as the Brugliones turn in horror. Everyone begins

dialog: 
text: Several are chewed up as chests explode and they are blown into
text: George on the cart, knocking it over. George comes to.
dialog: 
text: Romeo appears and tears in, sending several more crashing into the

speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Viva La Mejico, bitches!
dialog: 
text: George bolts up. The bus cart is still tied to his fat belly.

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (to Connor)
dialog: What do ya think? Let him go?
dialog: 
text: Connor slips one bullet in a revolver, spins the barrel and snaps it

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONNOR
dialog: We'll let God decide if you get a
dialog: second chance.
dialog: 
text: He slowly cocks the hammer back, pulls trigger, "click."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONNOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, praise the Lord.

speaker_heading: CONNOR (CONT'D)
dialog: George?

dialog: All good boys go to heaven.

speaker_heading: MURPHY

text: Eunice fires as the boys dive on Romeo. Crew Cut is revealed behind

text: fire as the boys reload.
dialog: 
text: Eunice hits Crew Cut in the side. The assassin has a moment of
text: outrage but persists firing as he makes a hasty exit.
dialog: 
text: In the confusion it is a few moments before anyone realizes he is

speaker_heading: CONNOR (CONT'D)

dialog: 
text: The boys wrap Jo Jo's body in a tarp and put it in the Green

dialog: 
text: Romeo and the brothers place the guns they used in the hands of dead

speaker_heading: EUNICE
dialog: Something ain't right with this whole

dialog: 
text: The Roman's common, two story home looms in the b.g. at the end of a

dialog:

text: Beside him, a horned phonograph plays 40's Jazz. Behind him, we see

dialog: 
text: The Roman sits in front of a sunken fire pit at a low flame. Across
text: the pit, an empty chair. Extended before him is a stunning garden,
text: standing in stark contrast to the common house: vines, flowers,
text: cobblestone walks, fountains. The center piece is a Turkish pool
text: with pure white Lillys afloat.
text: Poppa M slowly approaches the Roman from behind. He holsters his

text: The double doors crash in and men barrel through as Poppa M turns,
text: pulls two weapons and fires upon them, hitting one.
dialog: 
text: The boys crash through the glass ceiling of the greenhouse on either

dialog: 
text: Romeo bursts into the fray from inside the house, blasting away with
text: his gold .45's, a shotgun hanging on his back.
dialog: 
text: The garden is being torn apart as the brothers, Poppa M and Romeo
text: hit their marks and the hit squad returns fire. The boys dive

dialog: 
text: The gun battle rages around the Roman who remains seated in the very

dialog: 
text: Romeo fires as a large rack of wine behind him is torn apart.
