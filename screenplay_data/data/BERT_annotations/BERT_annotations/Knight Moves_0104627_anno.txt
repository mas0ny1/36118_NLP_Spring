scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - 1972 - DAY
dialog: 
text: TWO BOYS sit on opposite sides of a chessboard. One is NINE,
text: the other FOURTEEN. The room is SILENT, the tension between
text: the two young players severe. All the ADULT PLAYERS that have
dialog: been eliminated from this match by the two boys stand around
text: watching. On the wall is a BANNER that reads: 1972 WASHINGTON
speaker_heading: STATE TOURNAMENT.
dialog: 
text: The FOURTEEN year old moves and hits his TIMER. Frustration
text: fills the NINE year old's face. He moves. The FOURTEEN year
dialog: old moves and calls CHECK. The NINE year old frantically
text: searches the board for a solution. He moves. Again the
dialog: FOURTEEN year old moves and calls CHECK. The NINE year is
text: stunned. He picks up his KING to lay it on it's side and
text: signal defeat. Suddenly, he rakes the pieces off the board,
text: grabs his fountain pen and lunges at the FOURTEEN year old,
text: stabbing him repeatedly in the chest. They fall to the floor.
text: The ADULTS try to pull them apart. The NINE year old struggles
text: ferociously, SCREAMING and kicking like a mad man.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL WARD - 1972 - DUSK
dialog: 
text: In the b.g. we see the Nine year old Boy sleeping. A DOCTOR
text: and the boy's FATHER, a hard-looking MAN in his forties, walk
text: through the door. We MOVE with them down the hall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: The pressures and demands players with
dialog: your son's abilities put on themselves
dialog: to win are incredible. The stress and
dialog: tension are difficult enough for adults
dialog: to handle, yet alone a nine year old.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: I can't afford to keep him in here
dialog: forever, you know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I'd just like to keep him here over
dialog: night, then start sessions with a child
dialog: psychologist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: I knew this would happen. This is his
dialog: mother's doing. She's not strict
dialog: enough with him. I work all day. She
text: lays in bed drunk and the boy does
dialog: whatever he wants.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: After he's released it's crucial that
dialog: he's supervised. The most important
dialog: thing is that during his treatment he's
dialog: not allowed anywhere near a chessboard.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE, BACKYARD - 1972 - DUSK
dialog: 
text: A small, tract home. The Boy sits on the ground, drawing in
text: the dirt with a stick. He does not notice as his Father walks
text: up and stands behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
text: The Boy is startled. He stands up quickly. In the DIRT we see
text: he has drawn a CHESSBOARD.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: 
text: The Father SLAPS him across the face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Don't lie to me! What did the doctor's
dialog: tell you about playing chess! Get in
dialog: the house!
dialog: 
text: The Father drags his foot across the dirt, erasing the board.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - 1972 - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The Boy is sitting on his bed. In the b.g. we HEAR the VOICES
dialog: of his PARENTS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER (OS)
dialog: I've had it! I've got a drunk for a
dialog: wife and a lunatic for a son. I don't
dialog: need this shit anymore!
dialog: 
dialog: We HEAR FOOTSTEPS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER (OS)
dialog: You're crazy! Both of you.
dialog: 
text: We HEAR a DOOR SLAM. The Boy shows no sign of emotion.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY BLACK SCREEN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: All is quiet except for a faint DRIPPING SOUND. A door is
text: slowly opened. Light streaks out into a hallway. We see the
text: NINE year old. He is barefoot and wearing pajamas. He looks
text: up. Drops of BLOOD drip from a crack in the ceiling above.
text: The Boy moves towards a staircase at the end of the hall.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - 1972 - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The Boy enters, takes a few steps into the room and stops. He
text: stares ahead blankly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HIS POV: WOMAN'S ARM - CLOSE SHOT
dialog: 
text: The arm hangs off the bed, blood flows out of a deep gash in
text: her wrist and pools on the floor. The CAMERA moves up the arm.
text: A WOMAN in her forties lays in bed. The blood flows from her
text: other wrist, soaking into the mattress. Her eyes are closed,
text: head titled away from him.
dialog: 
text: The Boy shows no sign of emotion. He walks over to the
text: nightstand and starts to open her purse. There is a MOAN from
text: the WOMAN as she opens her eyes and turns her head toward the
text: boy. They lock eyes for a moment, then slowly, her eyes close.
text: The boy removes a key from the purse and walks to a dresser.
text: He unlocks a drawer and removes a box, then leaves the room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - 1972 - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The Boy walks over to the table with a glass of MILK and
text: COOKIES. He sits down, his feet dangling from the chair and
text: opens the box. Inside is a CHESSBOARD and PIECES. He removes
text: them, sets up the board and starts to play.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON CHESSBOARD: The CAMERA moves from one side of the
text: board to the other, weaving through the chess pieces, then
text: PULLS BACK over the heads of the AUDIENCE.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: >From the rear of the room, over the HEADS of the AUDIENCE, we
text: see THREE TABLES on stage. A large board of the game is
text: presented on the wall behind each table.
dialog: 
dialog: CLOSE SHOT - PLAYER'S EYES: We cut back and forth. Deep,
text: probing eyes, intensely focused and determined.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON THE CLOCK: It ticks methodically, and is the only
dialog: sound we hear.
dialog: 
dialog: 4
dialog: 
text: THE AUDIENCE: watches with anticipation, their eyes locked on
dialog: the viewing board.
dialog: 
text: PETER SANDERSON sits on one side of the board. He is a
text: handsome man, in his early thirties. Well-dressed in an
text: expensive suit, there is an air of confidence about him. Peter
text: makes a move, then hits the timer. Peter's opponent,
text: GRANDMASTER LUTZ, a quirky-looking little man in his fifties
text: makes a tentative move.
dialog: 
text: JEREMY EDMONDS, Peter's trainer, a distinguished-looking man in
text: his fifties, watches from his WHEELCHAIR. He grins and nods
text: his head, knowing that Peter has got the game.
dialog: 
text: Lutz studies the board, makes a move, then hits his timer.
text: Peter moves, then hits his timer. He is in control.
text: Frustration shows on Lutz's face. He surveys the board, then
text: slowly reaches over and lifts up his KING and lays it on it's
text: side signaling defeat. Peter stands, shakes his hand, waves to
text: the crowd, then leaves the stage.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A NEWSCASTER is positioned by the stage door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER
dialog: Today concludes the second week of
dialog: competition in this round-robin
dialog: candidates tournament. Each of the
dialog: players will play four games against
dialog: the other and the winner will earn the
dialog: right to play for the world title next
dialog: year.
dialog: 
text: Peter walks through the doorway and down the hall, accepting
text: congratulations. Jeremy wheels himself along side of him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER
dialog: But the big story is the amazing
dialog: comeback of Peter Sanderson who is
dialog: currently leading the tournament.
dialog: America's best hope since Bobby
dialog: Fischer, Sanderson stunned the chess
dialog: world three years ago when he walked
dialog: out in the middle of last candidates
dialog: tournament while leading by three games
dialog: and forfeited the match to Viktor
dialog: Yurilivich who is only two games behind
dialog: Sanderson in this match.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5
text: Peter stops to sign a few autographs. A young attractive WOMAN
text: in her twenties walks over to Peter. She is wearing a CHESS
text: FEDERATION BLAZER and a NAME TAG identifying her as DEBI
speaker_heading: RUTLEGE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBI
dialog: Mister Sanderson, here is your schedule
dialog: for tomorrow.
dialog: 
text: Peter takes it. They lock eyes. She smiles at him. A
text: REPORTER sticks a MICROPHONE in Peter's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Peter, could we have a moment please?
dialog: 
text: The moment is broken, as ERICA SANDERSON, Peter's daughter, a
text: bright-faced ten year rushes up to him and hugs him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Congratulations, dad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (to the press)
dialog: My cheering section.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Peter sits across a CHESSBOARD from Jeremy, who has just
dialog: finished making an opening move.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You opened with the English. Lutz
dialog: won't use it. He opened his first game
dialog: with it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: He knows you're aware of that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Then I'll transpose.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: On a variation, yes -- but it must be a
dialog: variation that is unique.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I suppose you have something in mind?
dialog: 
text: Peter gets up and begins to pace.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: (quickly moving the
dialog: pieces)
dialog: At this point you'll move Bishop to e4.
dialog: He'll capture your Knight e6. Rook to
text: b5, begins his counterplay. D6 takes
dialog: your Rook, your advantage is lost --
dialog: but watch -- Queen f5 check. He takes
dialog: your Knight -- Now, Rook to d3 -- he's
dialog: finished.
dialog: 
text: There is a KNOCK on the door and a MESSAGE is slipped under.
text: Peter picks it up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It's a good play, but risky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: You don't win by playing it safe,
dialog: Peter.
dialog: 
text: Peter opens the MESSAGE and reads it. Erica appears in the
text: doorway to her room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What are you doing up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I can't sleep. My beds lumpy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I see. You forgot to bring you're
dialog: night-light, didn't you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: That has nothing to do with it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: I'll tuck you in.
dialog: 
text: Erica kisses Peter, then runs into his room. Jeremy wheels
dialog: after her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Jeremy, have someone pick up a night-
dialog: light tomorrow.
dialog: 
text: Jeremy nods and leaves the room. Peter picks up the phone and
dialog: dials.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Debi..?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DEBI'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Peter and Debi move passionately on the bed, their bodies
text: moving rhythmically. Peter pulls her up to a sitting position,
text: guiding her up and down as he runs his lips sensually over her
text: breasts. She arches her back, MOANING softly as she gives way
dialog: to her pleasure.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DEBI'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Peter kisses Debi goodbye. He walks off and she closes the
dialog: door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DEBI'S BATHROOM - LATER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Debi is soaking in the bath. The DOORBELL RINGS.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DEBI'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Debi slips on a ROBE as she walks to the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBI
dialog: Yes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: (static; barely
dialog: audible)
dialog: It's me. I forgot something.
dialog: 
text: She smiles and pushes the button, then opens the door, leaving
text: it ajar, and walks out of the room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DEBI'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Debi quickly fixes her face, grins and leaves.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DEBI'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: It is dark. She enters and tries the light switch. It doesn't
dialog: work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBI
dialog: Very funny.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8
dialog: CLOSE ON DEBI: She senses something is very wrong. She turns
text: around slowly, her eyes squinting to see through the darkness.
text: Suddenly, terror fills her face as a FLASH of BRIGHT LIGHT
text: fills the screen.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FERRY LANDING - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Quaint and charming. Boats bob lazily in the water. TOURISTS
text: walk along the waterfront shops. ANDY WAGNER, a tough-looking
text: cop in his twenties, smokes a cigarette as he waits on the
text: dock. CHIEF OF POLICE, FRANK SEDMAN, walks towards him. He's
text: a large, slightly over-weight man in his forties. He takes one
text: last drag of a cigar, then crushes it out on the dock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Sorry to ruin your trip to the city,
dialog: but we got a real nut on our hands,
dialog: Frank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (all business)
dialog: Run it down.
dialog: 
text: Frank starts to walk. Andy follows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: (looking at note-pad)
dialog: Debi Rutlege. Female. Caucasian.
dialog: Twenty four. Worked over at the Four
dialog: Oaks Hotel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Local?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: No. She just moved here last month
dialog: from Portland.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DEBI'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Several BLACK and WHITE units are in front of the building.
text: Uniformed OFFICERS keep back a CROWD of onlookers. A CAR
text: drives up and stops in front of the building. Frank and Andy
dialog: get out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DEBI'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING
dialog: 
text: The room is filled with FORENSIC TEAM MEMBERS along with
text: UNIFORM OFFICERS. Frank enters with Andy. UNIFORMED OFFICERS
text: are standing around talking.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This isn't a party. Everybody that
dialog: doesn't need to be here get out!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DEBI'S BEDROOM - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Frank enters the room with Andy. He stops and stares at the
dialog: sight before him.
dialog: 
text: Debi Rutlege is laying on her bed. Her face is a deathly white
text: and has been painted awkwardly with rouge and lipstick giving
text: her a macabre appearance. She is draped in the sheet which is
text: tucked tightly around her body, her hands folded carefully
text: across her chest.
dialog: 
text: Above the bed written in blood is REMEMBER.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I moved out here from the city so I
dialog: could get away from this kind of shit.
dialog: 
text: STEVE NOLAN, from the forensic team, who has been kneeling on
text: the other side of the bed stands up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Whaddaya got, Nolan?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NOLAN
dialog: (continuing; holding
dialog: up a plastic bag)
dialog: Not much. There's no sign of a break
dialog: in. I think she let him in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How long has she been dead?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NOLAN
dialog: Six, eight hours tops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Any sign of rape?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NOLAN
dialog: Not that I can see. We'll know more
dialog: once I get the lab reports back from
dialog: Seattle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: What she die of?
dialog: 
text: Nolan turns over her arms. There are deep gashes in each
dialog: wrist.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You think whoever did this wanted it to
dialog: look like it was a suicide?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NOLAN
dialog: No. He would have taken more care not
text: to the leave rope burns on her wrists.
dialog: The way I got it figured is he tied her
text: up, slit her wrists, then sat back and
dialog: watched her bleed to death. But that's
dialog: not the main thing. What's wrong with
dialog: this picture?
dialog: 
text: A beat. Suddenly, Frank sees it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: There's no blood. Where's the fuckin'
dialog: blood?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NOLAN
dialog: Bingo.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DEBI'S APARTMENT, COURTYARD - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Frank and Andy walks across the yard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Who found her?
dialog: 
text: Andy points to MISS GREENWELL, a middle-aged woman talking to a
text: UNIFORMED OFFICER in the b.g.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: The landlady. Alice Greenwell. She
dialog: came for the rent check. The door was
dialog: ajar.
dialog: 
text: Frank walks over to Miss Greenwell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Miss Greenwell, I'm Captain Sedman.
dialog: Did Miss Rutlege have a boyfriend?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISS GREENWELL
dialog: I guess so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What do you mean, you guess so?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISS GREENWELL
dialog: I know she had company last night.
dialog: (confidentially)
dialog: A man.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How do you know that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
text: Well, her bedroom is on the other side
dialog: of mine. The walls are very thin. I
dialog: could hear them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: What were they doing? Humping?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISS GREENWELL
dialog: They were having sex, yes--
dialog: 
dialog: Andy grins.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISS GREENWELL
dialog: -- not that I was intentionally
dialog: listening -- but with the walls being
dialog: so thin--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I understand. Thank you.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Frank and Andy stand before several UNIFORMED OFFICERS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: First of all, I'd like to say that a
dialog: lot of us haven't got to know each
dialog: other since I replaced Captain Waters
dialog: last month. A lot of you think that
dialog: I'm an outsider who came over and took
dialog: away a job that should have gone to a
dialog: local... but that's the way it worked
dialog: out. So, all I can say is tough shit.
dialog: You want to bitch about it, that's fine
dialog: -- but you will tow the line in my
dialog: department. That means the next time
dialog: an Officer is responding to a homicide
dialog: call he seals off the crime scene and
dialog: nobody -- nobody but but Detective
dialog: Wagner and I go in.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Also, if anyone talks about the message
dialog: on the wall or the blood I'll
dialog: personally cut their balls off with a
dialog: butter knife.
dialog: (to Andy)
dialog: Get 'em going - then meet me at the
dialog: car. We're going over to the hotel.
dialog: 
text: Frank heads to the door.
dialog: 
dialog: 12
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Campbell, you check with the FBI see if
dialog: they got anything like this on file...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION, HALLWAY - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Frank steps into the hall and bumps into Nolan. They walk
dialog: together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Anything?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NOLAN
dialog: Not much. I don't think she was raped.
dialog: There's no bruising, or any signs of
dialog: trauma to the pelvic region -- and no
dialog: trace of sperm which makes sense
dialog: because she took a bath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What about prints?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NOLAN
dialog: No prints.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You mean, no prints but hers?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NOLAN
dialog: No Frank. No prints.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Peter is sitting at a chessboard with Jeremy. Peter studies
text: the board. There is a KNOCK on the door. Peter gets up and
text: opens the door. Frank and Andy are outside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Mister Sanderson? I'm Frank Sedman,
dialog: Bainbridge P.D. and this is Detective
dialog: Wagner. We'd like to ask you a few
dialog: questions about Debi Rutlege.
dialog: 
text: Peter opens the door and they enter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I know you're busy so I'll get right to
dialog: it. Did you know her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Only in passing. To say hello to.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I've talked to a few people who say you
dialog: and her were... friendly?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Chess tournaments can be boring
dialog: sometimes. People have a lot of free
dialog: time. They like to gossip.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Could you tell me where you were last
dialog: night?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Here. I played Gregory Lutz.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I know. You won two games against him
dialog: and left the auditorium at eight forty
dialog: five. Where did you go after that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: To my room and then I went for a walk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: By yourself?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
text: Frank takes out a piece of paper from his jacket pocket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This is a printout from the hotel
dialog: computer for all the messages logged to
dialog: your room. Here's one at 9:04 pm. It
dialog: says: From Debi. Please call me at
dialog: home.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: She called to give me my schedule for
dialog: tomorrow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What's interesting about it is you say
dialog: you only knew her in passing. Yet, she
dialog: says on her message for you to call her
text: at home and she doesn't leave a number.
dialog: That would imply you already knew the
dialog: number.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I got it from the tournament directory.
dialog: 
text: Frank takes out a small book.
dialog: 
dialog: 14
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: There's no Debi Rutlege listed in the
dialog: directory.
dialog: 
text: Peter's irritation starts to show. He opens a dresser drawer
text: and removes a small book.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You're looking in the general
dialog: directory. The player's directory
dialog: lists everyone connected to the
dialog: tournament.
dialog: 
text: A beat. Frank and Peter have reached a stalemate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: We seem to have a little problem here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What kind of problem?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I think you're lying. That's what kind
dialog: of problem.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What are you saying?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We're not saying anything right now.
dialog: We're just trying to put a few pieces
dialog: together.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: What do you think?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: He's got an answer for everything, but
dialog: he doesn't have an alibi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You think he's dirty?

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don't know, but I think you're right.

dialog: 
text: On the stage is three tables each flanked by two chairs.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I want another chair. This one killed
dialog: me yesterday.
dialog: (points to big board)
text: Also, the pieces on the board move too
dialog: slowly. I can see them out of the

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: David?
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No problem. It's just a matter of
dialog: adjusting the response time.
dialog: 
text: He taps in a few commands on the keyboard. We see a piece
text: quickly move across the board.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That should do it.

speaker_heading: YURILIVICH

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'm sure you are.

speaker_heading: YURILIVICH
dialog: No, I want you to do good. That way

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich.
dialog: You're nervous?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YURILIVICH
dialog: I'm not nervous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, you should be, because this time

speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: 
dialog: The "CALLERS" VOICE we HEAR is FILTERED through some type of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: Hello, Peter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Who is this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)

dialog: 
text: CLOSE SHOT: The back of a POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH. Letters have

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Casual.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: It means, if I were a killer and I
dialog: thought the police were closing in on

dialog: put them off the scent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That's crazy! Why would I draw

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You like to play games, don't you,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: DOCTOR FULTON

speaker_heading: ANDY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: When I was very young.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: It seems like such a complicated game.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Not really. You see your goal and you

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: That's a very personal question.

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: really nice touch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You weren't mad at him for picking up

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No. I told him to. I wanted to make
dialog: sure there was someone on the other

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: But we heard him.

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It could have been a tape. A

scene_heading: INT. POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: A room set up to deal with the murder. PHOTOGRAPHS are pinned

text: Nolan. On the chalkboard in the rhyme the Caller recited
dialog: earlier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar
dialog: to this guy. I think he's a first-
dialog: timer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Check with the State. If he's never
dialog: killed outside of Washington the F.B.I.
dialog: wouldn't have it. Nolan?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NOLAN
dialog: He tapes their mouths shut. We found
dialog: traces of adhesive around the victims
dialog: mouths. We're doing a chemical
dialog: analysis for components, but it's
dialog: probably a standard brand you can buy
dialog: in any hardware store.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: There's only two hardware stores on the
dialog: whole Island. We'll check that out.
dialog: What about the blood?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NOLAN
dialog: Not a drop. Maybe the guy works for
dialog: the Red Cross.
dialog: 
text: Frank looks at Nolan askance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Kathy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Well, the fact that he views this as a
dialog: game suggests that he is trying to
dialog: prove some sense of superiority -- and
dialog: the way he murders confirms a need to
dialog: be in complete control of his victim.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What about the way he arranged the
dialog: body?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 34
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: That would indicate he's playing out a
dialog: fantasy. Power-control killers usually
dialog: fantasize about their actions long
dialog: before they commit them. Once they
dialog: become a reality though, they reach a
dialog: sense of euphoria and need to repeat
dialog: the act to sustain it. But, in all the
dialog: research I've read on Serial Killers,
dialog: I've never heard of one moving so fast.
dialog: It's as if the game is the catalyst for
dialog: the murders -- not the other way
dialog: around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Anything else?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Yes. Why disguise your voice if no one
dialog: knows it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I was thinking the same thing. He must
dialog: be local. It's logical for him to
dialog: assume that the police would be there,
dialog: but he recognized Andy's voice and
dialog: called him by name.
dialog: (points to the rhyme)
dialog: What about this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I would think it's some type of clue as
dialog: to where he's going to kill next?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Why does he call Sanderson?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: He's one of the best Chess players in
dialog: the world. Who better to play a game
dialog: with?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (to Andy)
dialog: You still having a problem with this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Yeah, I am. I think he's playing us.
dialog: If I was a killer and the police were
dialog: trying to make a case against me, what
dialog: better why to draw them off than to put
dialog: their attention on someone else?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 35
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Sending yourself anonymous notes in the
dialog: mail is one thing -- but who called him
dialog: today?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I don't know. Maybe there's two of
dialog: them. Maybe he hired some Wino to make
dialog: the calls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Maybe you're reaching a bit? I think

speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Sometimes I think you'd rather be the

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hello?

speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: Do you know what I'm doing right now,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You know her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: Not really.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Why her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: (a trace of anger)
dialog: Because she's the type.

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Just like who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: I really wish you'd stop trying to

dialog: to mention insulting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'm just trying to play the game.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: You're not playing very well. There

speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: I'm sure there are other people who

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Let's see how much he wants to play.
dialog: 
text: SILENCE fills the room. Peter stares at the phone expectantly.
text: A moment later it RINGS. Peter waits and lets it ring.
text: Finally he answers it on the fourth ring.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: Just for that no hint today.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Why are you doing this? You must have
dialog: some idea of the pain you're causing
dialog: people.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: Pain? Pain is just a state of mind.
dialog: It's something you learn to live with.

text: Kathy hands Peter a note she has written.

speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: Please, I don't want to get into the
dialog: psychological aspects of my actions.
dialog: It would detract from the game.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: How?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: I couldn't say it any better than
dialog: Huxley.
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: PETER

text: The line goes dead. Peter hangs up.

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: What in the hell do you think you're

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You think you're going to catch him on
dialog: a trace? Everything he does is planned
dialog: out well in advance. The only way
dialog: we're going to get him is to rattle him

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You never know how you're going to

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Maybe you should.

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What were you going to say, Kathy?

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Well, I think you have to play to his
dialog: ego. He thinks he's superior. The
dialog: more secure he feels, the more chances
dialog: he'll take.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What did he mean by Huxley?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He was referring to a quote by Thomas
dialog: Henry Huxley.
dialog: (quoting)
dialog: "The chess board is the world, the
dialog: pieces are the phenomena of the
dialog: universe, the rules of the game are
dialog: what we call Nature. The player on the
dialog: other side is hidden from us. We know
dialog: that his play is always fair, just, and
dialog: patient. But also, we know, to our

text: Peter smiles like a boy with his hand caught in the cookie-jar.

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: When I was little I'd watch the other

dialog: call them in to put their bats and

dialog: window, forcing, expressions of
dialog: disappointment, trying to gain another
dialog: few minutes outside so they could play
dialog: -- but no one could stop me from
dialog: playing.
dialog: (he closes his eyes)
dialog: All I had to do was close my eyes and
dialog: my whole world became a chessboard. I
dialog: could see the pieces, and sometimes it
dialog: felt like if I reached out I could
dialog: almost touch them. I ordered them and
dialog: they obeyed.

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (thinks for a moment)
dialog: No. But I'm open to distractions.

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I'm sure you are.

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You know, you're not the easiest person

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You always want to talk about me. What
dialog: about you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Wasn't I just talking about me?

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: No. You were talking about chess.

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What? By attacking me?

dialog: 
dialog: 56
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Nobody could attack you. You set your
dialog: life up like one of your chessboards.
dialog: You're impregnable -- but at the same
dialog: time you've become trapped behind your
dialog: own defenses. You're cut off from
dialog: everyone around you.

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: PETER

text: With one hand he sweeps the PIECES off onto the floor, then
text: sits her down on it. They kiss each other furiously, each of

speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: Since Grandmaster Sanderson leads the

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I used to. With my old man. He taught
dialog: me how to hunt and trap. Trapping's a
dialog: lot harder than most people think. We
dialog: used to go after Raccoons mostly.
dialog: They'd get into our garbage, our
dialog: fields. When an animal can't live
dialog: peacefully with those around it, it has
dialog: to be destroyed. But they're crafty
dialog: little devils. You see the trick is,
dialog: you can put your trap down, but no
dialog: Raccoon is going come near it unless
dialog: you lay down the scent. You ever smell
dialog: Raccoon scent? Smells like shit, but
dialog: to a male Raccoon it smells just like
dialog: pussy. He'll walk right up to that
dialog: trap, even though it don't look nothing
dialog: like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam
dialog: head right in it. You know why? Cause
dialog: he can't help himself. The scent
dialog: drives him. So, if you want to catch a
dialog: Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out
dialog: where he is -- lay down the scent --
dialog: and sooner or later he'll walk right
dialog: into the trap.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What if he doesn't bite? What if he's
dialog: an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Well then, you just gotta find out
dialog: where he is -- and once you're sure
dialog: where he is -- you shoot the fucker.

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: If it's so important, why don't you

speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: I couldn't tell you that. It would

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You like to brag, don't you?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 71
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)

dialog: I'm not worldly like you, Peter. I'm
dialog: not an internationally known figure.
dialog: I'm just a poor guy who has never been
dialog: anywhere, but I'm beating you.

text: The Caller's statement hits home. Slowly a look of

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: So, why were you looking for Doctor
dialog: Sheppard today?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)

speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: What makes you think I was there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (using his words)

speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)

dialog: you're running out of time.

text: Peter's face hardens, eyes intensely staring off in the

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It's you who's running out of time.
dialog: You're starting to make mistakes now.
dialog: You're wondering just how much I really
dialog: know. Just how close I'm getting?
dialog: Well, I'm closer than you think, pal --
dialog: and I'm gonna nail your ass to the
dialog: wall!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: Very nice speech, Peter. Did you
dialog: rehearse that, or was it impromptu?
dialog: (Peter doesn't answer)
dialog: There's an old wooden bench in the
dialog: garden. Next to it is a rock. You'll
dialog: find a message for you under it. Let's

dialog: 
text: IN A FIERCE MAGAZINE YOU WILL FIND A HINT OF MY ACTION TO COME:

speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint
dialog: of my actions to come... Why does he
dialog: set this line apart?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: For emphasis?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Exactly. It's the key.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: But what does he mean by a fierce
dialog: magazine? Violent?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: A fierce magazine... brutal...
dialog: (thinking aloud)
text: An angry magazine... A war magazine...
dialog: a mercenary magazine... fierce...
dialog: (he gets it)
dialog: Mad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Where's the note?
dialog: 
dialog: 73
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You got it on the board.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, I need the original note.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: There's a photostat of the original on
dialog: the wall.
dialog: 
text: Peter gets up and takes the note off the wall and studies it
text: for a moment, then starts to fold it in half.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: My daughter reads Mad Magazine all the
dialog: time. If you fold the back cover a
dialog: certain way, the text reads
dialog: differently.
dialog: 
text: Peter moves the crease of the paper in and out until it forms
dialog: the correct margin.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: The NOTE now reads:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: IN A FIERCE ACTION TO COME:
dialog: 
dialog: AS LARGE AS CASTLES, YOU ARE
text: STILL LIGHT AS THE AIR,
dialog: ONE HUNDRED MEN CAN'T MOVE ME.

text: Kathy looks at Peter, impressed.

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (reading)
dialog: As large as castles. You are still
dialog: light as air, one hundred men can't
dialog: move me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It doesn't make sense.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: It doesn't make sense because we don't
dialog: understand it.

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: But a hundred men could move him.

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Then what's he talking about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (on edge)
dialog: If we knew that we'd know the answer to
dialog: the riddle, wouldn't we? He's telling
dialog: us where he's going to kill tonight and
dialog: we can't see it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Maybe we should back up a minute and
dialog: take a look at what we do have. All
dialog: the girls that have been killed have
dialog: been killed at night. They're all the
dialog: same type. All moved into their homes
dialog: within the last three months -- and all
dialog: of them found their homes through
dialog: Homesearchers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I thought that Homesearchers was a dead
dialog: end?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It can't be a coincidence. The woman
dialog: that owns it has a son. She says he's
dialog: been on vacation in Montana for the
dialog: last ten days. We're trying to locate
dialog: him. There's also a cleaning service
dialog: that comes in once a week. We're
dialog: checking that out too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: He moves around a lot. Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: He finds his victims through
dialog: Homesearchers. He goes where they are.
dialog: 
text: Peter is only half-listening to the conversation. He appears
dialog: deep in thought.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: But they rent lots of apartments. He
dialog: could probably find them all in a
dialog: localized area. Why move all over the
dialog: Island?
dialog: 
text: Peter slowly comes to a realization. His eyes open wide as a
text: thought crashes into his mind.
dialog: 
dialog: 75
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Jesus! It can't be that easy!
dialog: 
text: Peter walks to the MAP of the victims locations on the wall.

text: move his finger in various GEOMETRIC LINES across the map.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You want to tell us what the hell
dialog: you're doing?
dialog: 
text: Peter doesn't answer. He stares at the MAP for a few more
text: seconds, as the excitement of his realization grows. He takes
text: a step back and turns to Kathy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He told us and we missed it! He said
dialog: he's never been anywhere. Therefore,
dialog: this Island is the world to him.
dialog: (pointing to the map)

dialog: of the world. That's why he quoted

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: You want me to what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I want you to feed every street in this

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: It'll take hours. You can't make me do
dialog: this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You're right, I can't make you do it.
dialog: Besides, you're probably gonna be too
dialog: busy with the Franchise Tax Board
dialog: anyway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I gotta friend over there. He was
dialog: telling me things are kind of slow.
dialog: So, I figured I'd give him a call, have

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: As large as castles, you are still
dialog: light as the air, one hundred men can't
dialog: move me. It's posed as a question.
dialog: What am I?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: A building?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
text: A building isn't as light as air.
dialog: What's large, but as light as air and
dialog: can't be moved?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: (correcting him)
dialog: As large as castles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yes. Why not just say a building if he
dialog: meant any general type of structure?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He's not going to give us direct hints.
dialog: He's going to skirt around it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: He uses castles...plural -- then says
dialog: "can't move me." Singular. Not can't
dialog: move us.
dialog: 
text: Kathy stretches her arms above her head. Her shadow falls
text: across the lawn. Peter stares at the ground for a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: A shadow. What's as big a castle? As
dialog: light as air , but one hundred men
dialog: can't move it? The shadow of the
dialog: castle. Are there any buildings that
dialog: have the name Castle in it that cast a
dialog: shadow long enough to fall across
dialog: another building?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Wait a minute. There's an apartment in

speaker_heading: named JANET MCLELLAN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay. Homesearchers gave us the name
dialog: Laura Owens. She just moved into an
dialog: apartment across the street from the
dialog: Castle Arms one week ago. We've moved
dialog: her to her parents house in Seattle and
dialog: S.P.D. is going to keep a watch on her
dialog: tonight.
dialog: (pointing)

dialog: at her apartment.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Andy, you're going to go to the hotel
dialog: and pick up Yurilivich at the

scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Yurilivich makes a move, then hits his timer. Peter studies
text: the board. He looks up at Yurilivich. Both of them stare at
text: each other intensely. Peter looks back at the board and makes
text: a move. On the BIG BOARD a PIECE MOVES, then STOPS halfway
text: between a square. A moment later the entire board breaks up
text: into an unreadable mass of lines. There's a GROAN from the
text: crowd. The President walks over to David and confers with him
text: quickly, then goes to the players.

scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The POV climbs through the window and studies the WOMAN in bed

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'm getting a bad feeling about this.
dialog: If Yurilivich was making a move we
dialog: would have heard something from Andy by
dialog: now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: You think we're in the wrong place?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This has to be the right place. It all
dialog: fits. This is the only building that
dialog: has the word castle in it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: No. There's the Castle Courts
text: Apartments over on Pine Road.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: But that's all the way across town.
text: It's in another grid.
dialog:

speaker_heading: FLASHES.

dialog: back apartment of the Castle Courts.
dialog: 
text: He runs towards the building.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE COURTS, APARTMENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The front door crashes open as Frank breaks it down. He enters

scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT HALL - NIGHT

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Frank enters. The room is lit by moonlight. The rear window
text: is open. On the bed is the WOMAN we saw earlier. She is
text: naked. Her arms tied to the bed frame. There are two deep
text: GASHES in her wrists. Blood flows from her wrists into large
text: plastic bags. Her mouth is taped. Still conscious she
text: struggles, her eyes opened wide in a horror-filled stare.
dialog: 
text: On the wall behind her, written in blood is CAREFULLY.
dialog: 
text: Frank runs to the window. The b.g. we HEAR the SOUND of
text: FOOTSTEPS running away. Frank turns back towards the Woman and
text: quickly moves to the bed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE COURTS APARTMENTS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: BLACK and WHITE UNITS are parked in front, their lights

speaker_heading: RADIO.

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: How is she?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: She's unconscious, but they think she's

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You alright?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I've seen a lot of things in my time on
dialog: the job, but nothing like this.
dialog: Yurilivich?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I was with him the whole time until I
dialog: got the call at the hotel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sanderson?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 85
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I spoke to Jeremy. He's watching

scene_heading: EXT. PUGET SOUND - NIGHT

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KATHY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: We HEAR the DOORBELL. Kathy glances at her watch as she walks
text: across the living room to the front door. She looks through
text: the viewing-hole, then opens the door to reveal a tired-looking
text: Peter on the doorstep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Can I come in?
dialog: 
text: Kathy thinks about it for a moment,then opens the door wider,
text: signaling for him to come in. Kathy sits down on the arm-rest
text: of a chair, Peter stands. A beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: The other night -- I said some things
dialog: that maybe I shouldn't have. I mean,
dialog: you haven't known me very long and I
dialog: can see how you thought what you did.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I was thinking that... maybe when this
dialog: is all over we could...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I want someone I can get close to. I
dialog: don't know if that's possible with you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You really haven't seen my best side.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 86
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Peter...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, listen. You have no idea of the
dialog: kind of pressure I'm under right now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: That's still no excuse. You treat
dialog: everything like a game.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I can't think any more, unless it's
dialog: about you. I'll be in the middle of a
dialog: match and instead of thinking about my
dialog: next move, I think about how you look
dialog: when you smile.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Remember how you said that I hide
dialog: behind my chessboard? Ever since my
dialog: wife died I've been...
dialog: (this isn't easy)
dialog: I've been afraid of getting too close
dialog: to someone again -- afraid of losing
dialog: them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You're wife died. You can't feel
dialog: responsible for that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You don't understand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Then help me to understand. I want to
dialog: understand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It's not that easy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Of course it isn't. It's always
dialog: difficult when someone you love dies.
dialog: But you can't feel responsible because
dialog: she had a car accident.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: But I do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Because she killed herself!!
dialog: 
dialog: 87
dialog: (softer)
dialog: She killed herself.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: She drove her car over that cliff!
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Oh, the police said it was an accident
dialog: -- but I knew. I've always known. I
dialog: closed myself off to her and after I
dialog: found the letter I closed myself off to
dialog: everything else. Beating Yurilivich
dialog: and playing for the title was all I
dialog: could think about -- but I snapped. I
dialog: had a breakdown in the middle of the
dialog: match. I don't remember too much about
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: He removes the envelope from his pocket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: This letter. I've never opened it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Because I know what it says.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
dialog: 
text: A beat. Peter walks to the couch and sits down. He stares at
text: the envelope, then starts to open it. He stops and looks up at
text: Kathy who nods her head. Kathy starts to leave
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Will you stay with me?
dialog: 
text: Kathy sits beside him. He opens the envelope and starts to
dialog: read.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Peter. There are many pains we feel in
dialog: this world -- but loving someone who
dialog: has shut you out of his life has to be
dialog: the most unbearable of them all. I
dialog: knew when we married that you were a
dialog: man consumed with ambition, but
dialog: somewhere along the way, your
dialog: chessboard became your wife, and I
dialog: became your mistress.
dialog: 
dialog: 88
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I know now that you cannot change,
dialog: cannot give me the things I need. You
dialog: may think that I'm a coward for what I
dialog: am about to do, but it is my choice.
dialog: My release. I only ask that you shield
dialog: Erica from the truth, and that you
dialog: forgive me for being so weak.
dialog: Jennifer.
dialog: 
text: His eyes fill with tears. The guilt he has carried for so long
text: is released. Kathy puts her arm around him. He turns to her
text: and rests his head on her shoulder.

text: behind and Peter enter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Doctor Sheppard, what goes on in the
dialog: mind of someone like this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: That's a very difficult question to
dialog: answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Is there a usual scenario?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Well -- yes... usually we find they've
dialog: had a traumatic childhood. He was
dialog: probably abused by a dominant female
dialog: figure. That, coupled with the fact
dialog: that these girls have not been raped
dialog: leads me to believe that he is either
dialog: impudent or a latent homosexual.
dialog: Regardless, he's acting out some type
dialog: of revenge fantasy that fulfills some
dialog: sick sexual needs.
dialog: 
text: Jeremy notices Peter. He turns off the TV.

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hi. Where's, Erica?

speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: KATHY (OS)

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What time did he get there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: About a quarter to one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: We're interested in where you were from
dialog: the time you left the auditorium until
dialog: you got there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I was at the beach.
dialog:

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'm positive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You're a lying bastard!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Fuck you! I'm tired of your goddam
dialog: accusations! If you want to arrest me
dialog: go ahead! Otherwise back off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: It's all a big game isn't it? A sick,
dialog: fuckin' game. I don't know if there's
dialog: two of you involved, or what -- but
dialog: we're going to find out. Last night
dialog: you gave us just enough to send us to
dialog: the wrong place. It must've shocked
dialog: the hell out to you when Frank walked
dialog: in on Pine Road and you couldn't
dialog: finish.
dialog: 
text: Peter starts to walk away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'm not going to listen to this.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Yes you are.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (pushing him)
dialog: Get off me!
dialog: 
text: Andy explodes. He pushes Peter backward into a GLASS FIRE
text: EXTINGUISHER CASE. It breaks as Peter's HAND SMASHES THROUGH
text: THE GLASS. Peter raises his hand. Blood pours out from a cut
text: on his wrist. Anger floods across his face. He raises his
text: hand to hit Andy. Andy quickly pulls out his gun and points it
text: at Peter's head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Go ahead. Do it.
dialog: 
text: A beat. Peter stares at him. Slowly a crazed grin spreads
text: across his face. He moves closer, pressing his forehead
text: against the barrel of the gun, his eyes locked on Andy's.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 91
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You want to shoot me? Go ahead. Shoot
dialog: me!
dialog: 
text: Peter and Andy lock eyes. Everyone in the room is stunned by
text: Peter's action. The tension is broken as the phone RINGS.
text: Peter and Andy continue to stare at each other. Slowly, Andy
text: backs off. Peter doesn't move. The PHONE continues to RING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You going to answer that?
dialog: 
text: A beat. The PHONE continues to RING. Peter stares at Andy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Peter. Please.
dialog: 
text: Peter walks to the phone and answers it. Kathy wraps a towel
text: around his hand to stop the bleeding.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hello.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: Last night was very exciting, wasn't
dialog: it? Have you figured out what I'm
dialog: doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: Very good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You're next move should have been e2-
dialog: e3.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: I used a variation. You should have
dialog: anticipated that. Have you figured out
dialog: the message?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What word did you leave last night?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: The police haven't told you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: They think that you and I are doing
dialog: this together.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: Interesting concept. I hadn't thought
dialog: of that. If you think about how Anton
dialog: Berger plays chess you might get it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean
dialog: anything. Remember eventually revenge-
dialog: -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: --you're hopeless! You can't even read
dialog: a sentence! Didn't they teach you

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Remember eventually revenge is
dialog: carefully... Have you tired
dialog: juxtaposing the words?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Oh, c'mon. We're not going to spend
dialog: any more time on this crap, are we? It
dialog: doesn't mean anything. It's Sanderson!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: It isn't him. Frank, you brought me in
dialog: on this in the beginning because you
dialog: wanted my opinion if he was capable of
dialog: doing this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy.
dialog: You've lost your perspective. You
dialog: can't possibly be unbiased.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: He's right, Kathy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: What are you saying? That I'm seeing
dialog: what I want to see? That I'm
dialog: protecting a murderer? What?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 93
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We can't rely on your judgement
dialog: anymore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: What does that mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: It means you're off the case.
dialog: 
text: Kathy looks at Frank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'm afraid I have no choice. I can't

dialog: suspect.
dialog: 
text: Kathy stands up and stares at Frank angrily.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: (pointing to Andy)
dialog: And what if he's wrong. If you were
dialog: one hundred percent sure it was Peter
dialog: you would've arrested him. If it is
dialog: someone else then he's going to kill
dialog: again tonight and you're sitting here
dialog: ignoring the message.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We're going to work on the message.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: (angry)
dialog: This stinks! You want to know what I
dialog: think? I think there have been five
dialog: murders and you've got shit to go on.
dialog: You need to blame someone and he's the
dialog: easiest choice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The most logical choice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You don't have a shred of evidence!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY

text: wall, waiting for her to enter the room.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. PETER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Peter sits by the phone in the dark. He stares at the PHONE
text: almost willing it to ring. In a FLASH OF LIGHTNING he sees a
text: pool of blood flowing out under the closet door. Slowly Peter
text: walks towards the door, he reaches to open it, then hesitates,
text: afraid of what might be behind the door. He takes a deep
text: breath, then opens it quickly.
dialog: 
text: PETER'S POV: A FLASH OF LIGHTNING highlights Andy's lifeless

dialog: Yes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: Congratulations on your daring escape.
dialog: You just missed me by a few seconds.

dialog: It's check, Peter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Let me speak to my daughter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: She's in the other room. I just wanted
dialog: you to know she wasn't dead... yet.
dialog: But it's time for her to die now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Please... wait.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: The game's over. You lost.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It's me you want. Not her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: No. As usual you're wrong. It is her
dialog: I want. Killing you would be easy.
dialog: Living with the consequences of losing
dialog: will be much more of a defeat.
dialog: 
text: Peter HEARS a faint RATTLING SOUND in the background.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That wouldn't be very sporting.
dialog: Remember Huxley? "His play is always
dialog: fair and just."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: You're groping. I have been fair.
dialog: It's my move now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'll give you anything you want.
dialog: Anything! Please!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: Don't beg, Peter. She has to die. I
dialog: can't win unless she dies.
dialog: 
text: Peter hears the SOUND again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (OS)
dialog: I was thinking about leaving the phone
dialog: line open so you could hear her die --
dialog: but I've decided it's better if you
dialog: don't know exactly when I kill her.
dialog: Good-bye Peter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No! Wait!!
dialog: 
text: The line goes dead. Peter's mind races.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: A few seconds! Where could he have
dialog: gone in a few seconds? Think! Think,
dialog: Goddamit!
dialog: 
text: He looks towards the window.
dialog: 
text: PETER'S POV: of the wind blowing through the trees outside.
dialog: 
text: Peter's face floods with realization.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Steam pipes!
dialog: 
text: Peter dials a THREE DIGIT number on the phone.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BASEMENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The MAN wearing a black rain-coat walks across the room towards
text: an alcove. The door to the alcove is OPEN and we see Erica who
text: is tied to a chair and gagged. WATER FLOODS in through cracks
text: in the foundation flooding the room.
dialog: 
dialog: 113
dialog: 
text: THE PHONE RINGS. He stops, startled by the sound, his head
text: snapping towards the phone. The MAN is stunned. His mind
text: races. He thinks for a moment. He walks back to the phone and
text: slowly lifts the receiver.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER (OS)
dialog: I know where you are.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER
dialog: Very good. How did you know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER (VO)
dialog: The pipes.
dialog: 
text: The MAN looks at the PIPES. They RATTLE. The realization of
text: his mistake dawns on him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER
dialog: Excellent. It doesn't matter. You
dialog: still lose. She'll still be dead
dialog: before you can get down here.
dialog: 
text: The MAN slams down the receiver. CLICK! The blade snaps out of
text: the STILETTO. He walks quickly back towards the alcove, the
text: KNIFE clutched tightly in his hand. He stops for a moment at
text: the door, as he prepares for the act ahead.
dialog: 
text: Erica stares at him as he approaches with wide-eyed terror!
text: The MAN moves towards her then stops, sensing something is
dialog: wrong.
dialog: 
text: The door slowly CLOSES revealing Peter standing behind it,
text: Frank's gun aimed at him in one hand, the CORDLESS PHONE in the
dialog: other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: Checkmate!
dialog: 
text: Peter turns on the LIGHTS. The MAN turns around. It is David,
text: the computer technician. He slowly brings the KNIFE to his
text: side, hiding it behind his leg.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER
dialog: How'd you know I wouldn't be in the
dialog: same room with her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You told me. When you called you said
dialog: she was in the other room. Drop the
dialog: knife.
dialog: 
text: The Caller shrugs his shoulder, then drops it. They stare at
text: each other. David takes a little step closer.
dialog: 
dialog: 114
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Computers. That's how you got into
dialog: Homesearchers records. You can get
dialog: into anything. But why? Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You still haven't figured it out, have
dialog: you? You think that I've put you
dialog: through an ordeal. My scars run so
dialog: much deeper than yours.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What scars?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (moving closer)
dialog: The scars on your chest. From where I
dialog: stabbed you with my fountain pen.
dialog: 
text: Shock pours over Peter's face as his mind drifts back to a
dialog: tournament twenty years ago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We were only children.
dialog: 
text: David lunges at Peter. Peter raises the gun. Too late! David
text: is too close. He pushes Peter's hand away. They struggle over
dialog: the gun.

scene_heading: INT. PETER'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kathy runs outside.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BASEMENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The struggle continues. David butts his head into Peter's
text: nose, then slams him into the wall again. THE GUN FIRES into
text: the air. At the same moment a CLAP OF THUNDER BOOMS overhead.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kathy does not HEAR the SHOT. In the b.g. we see Frank running
dialog: towards her.
dialog: 
dialog: 115
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BASEMENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: David repeatedly smashes Peter's hand into the wall. THE GUN
text: FIRES INTO THE AIR SEVERAL TIMES. A bullet hits an over head
text: PIPE. STEAM FLOODS the room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Frank hears the shots and runs towards the SOUND.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BASEMENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: David smashes Peter's hand into the wall until the gun falls to
text: the ground, disappearing under the water. He grabs Peter,
text: lifting him into the air, displaying brute strength, his rage
text: is unleashed. He slams Peter's back into the wall, knocking
dialog: the wind out of him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL UTILITY CORRIDOR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Frank races through the hallway.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BASEMENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The fight continues. STEAM SWIRLS through the room. David
text: slams his elbow into Peter's face. Blood pours out of Peter's
text: nose. David raises his knee, kicking Peter in the stomach.
text: Peter doubles over. David picks up a lamp off the desk and
text: smashes it over Peter's head. Peter drops to the ground.
text: David picks up his knife and walks over to Peter, then lifts
text: his head out of the water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They took everything from me -- because
dialog: of you -- and now I'm going to take
dialog: everything from you.
dialog: 
text: David opens the door to the alcove, then walks back to Peter.
text: He bends down and presses the BLADE to Peter's neck. For a
text: moment we sense he is going to kill Peter, then, he grabs him
text: by the hair, lifting his head up so he can see.
dialog: 
text: PETER'S POV: Erica is sitting in the alcove, tied to the
dialog: chair.
dialog: 
text: Peter is only semi-conscious. David starts to leave. David is
text: just about at the alcove door when Frank enters the room, his
text: weapon drawn. Then looks at Peter, then David.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 116
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (moving towards Frank)
dialog: Thank God you're here. I heard Erica
dialog: scream and came in to see what was
dialog: going on. Mister Sanderson was going
dialog: to stab her.
dialog: (holds up the knife)
dialog: With this.
dialog: 
text: Frank looks at the knife.
dialog: 
text: FRANK'S POV: There is a DEEP CUT on David's wrist, exactly
dialog: like Peter's.
dialog: 
text: Frank's face registers the cut. David notes it. Before Frank
text: can even look at him, David thrusts the blade into his stomach.
text: The force drives Frank back against the wall. His gun drops
text: from his hand as Frank slides to the floor.
dialog: 
text: Peter tries to grab David's leg as he heads towards the alcove.
text: Frank pulls up his pant leg revealing his backup gun. He tries
dialog: to reach for it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BASEMENT, ALCOVE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: David enters the room. Through the STEAM he sees Kathy trying
text: to untie Erica. David stares at them, his lips spread into
text: maniacal grin. The OVERHEAD LIGHTS FLASH on and off
dialog: intermittently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: This isn't going to help, David.
dialog: You're mother's dead. You can't undo
dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You don't understand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Yes, I do. I found your file. I know
dialog: what happened.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They took away the game because of him.
dialog: My father left and my mother... There
dialog: was so much blood... It covered
dialog: everything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I know, but this isn't going to bring
dialog: her back.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 117
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Don't you see? I had to make it right.
dialog: I ignored my mother's crossing. I sat
dialog: with them all. I held their hands. I
dialog: stroked their hair. I was with them to
dialog: the end. I took away the blood. I
dialog: washed them. Their crossing was
dialog: peaceful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I think your mother knows that now.
dialog: Why don't you put the knife down. Put
dialog: it down, David.
dialog: 
text: For a moment it appears he is thinking about it. He lowers the
text: blade, but his need to kill is to strong. He raises it again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She has to die!
dialog: 
text: His face tenses. He lunges towards Erica.
dialog: 
text: BANG! A shot tears through his chest. The impact blows him
text: off his feet. He falls back into the murky water and
dialog: disappears.
dialog: 
text: Peter stands in the doorway, straining to stay conscious,
dialog: Frank's GUN aimed at David.
dialog: 
text: Kathy quickly finishes untying Erica. They run to the corner
text: of the room. Kathy holds her close.
dialog: 
text: Peter slowly staggers forward. He probes the water with his
text: feet, checking for David's body. The MURKY WATER, THE STEAM
text: and the BLINKING LIGHTS don't make it easy. Peter leans over,
text: pointing the gun at the ground.
dialog: 
text: PETER'S POV: The MURKY WATER. Suddenly, a HAND streaks out of
dialog: the water.
dialog: 
text: The hand grabs Peter around the neck. David stands up quickly.
text: They struggle over the gun. They both fall backwards into the
text: water. Peter surfaces and crawls backwards. David stands up.
text: They locks eyes. Peter stares back with a deadly calmness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: The game's over, asshole!
dialog: 
text: David starts to lunge for him. Peter empties the GUN into him.
text: His body jerks backwards violently, smashing into the wall,
text: then he slides down and dies, slowly disappearing under the
dialog: surface of the water.

dialog: 
text: Peter sits off to the side. He looks worn to the point of
text: exhaustion. A PARAMEDIC attends to the wounds on his face.
text: Erica sits beside him, clinging to his arm. TWO MEN carry a
text: STRETCHER, the body on it is covered. Peter stares at it
text: blankly as it passes.
dialog: 
text: Kathy is standing at the rear of an AMBULANCE. The doors close
text: and it drives off. She walks over to Peter and Erica.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Frank's going to be alright. They
dialog: don't think any major arteries were
dialog: severed.
dialog: 
text: The information doesn't seem to register with Peter. He

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Peter, you beat him.
dialog: 
text: He slowly looks over at her, but says nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You beat him.

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I got lucky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: There's a girl in the hospital who is
