text: Black screen: Echoing through a house, we hear A BOY BARKING
text: and A DOG YELPING.
text: The picture comes up and a raggedy black dog tears down a set
text: of stairs, toward us.
text: MAX, eight years old and wearing a white wolf suit, jumps
text: down the stairs, tumbling toward the camera, growling and
text: chasing the dog. For some reason, Max is holding a fork.
text: He jumps to the bottom of the stairs tucking and rolling,
text: screeching a feral war-cry and follows the dog off-screen.
text: Max chases the dog under the dining room table and closes in.
text: He leaps and grabs the dog, and howling and somersaulting,
text: they wrestle happily together until the screen freezes.

scene_heading: EXT. SNOW-COVERED SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
text: Max's legs protrude from a hand-dug opening in a large snow
text: embankment - a remnant of the morning’s snowplows.
text: He crawls out and stands over it, surveying his creation. A
text: proud and crooked grin spreads across his face.
text: He runs off toward his house, wanting badly to tell someone
dialog: about it.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. MAX’S HOME - DAY
text: Max runs up to the window and taps on the glass. Inside is

dialog: Max, go play with your friends!
text: Max is crushed. He walks off, dejected.
scene_heading: INT. IGLOO - DAY
text: Max sits, resting in his igloo, deep in thought. He exits the
text: igloo with a makeshift flag -- a plastic bag tied to a birch
text: twig. He marches over to a nearby wooden fence and barks
text: orders to it.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You! Go that way! You! Go that way!
text: The fence isn’t responding. Max kicks it.
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t talk to me like that. You’re
dialog: just a fence. Go play with your own
dialog: fence friends. Now move out!
text: He runs to his fort and carefully secures his flag to the
text: top. He adjusts it two or three times to make it just right -
dialog: Max is something of a perfectionist.
text: Just then, Max watches as a car pulls into his driveway. Max
text: sees a group of teenage boys and girls get out of the car and
text: lope into his house.

text: Max gets an idea. He jumps into his igloo and scoops up all
text: of his snowballs. He can’t carry them all so he hurriedly
text: rolls them out the entrance.
text: He runs across the street to his house, closer to his prey,
text: carefully balancing his ammunition on his coat, kangaroo
text: style. He hides behind the neighbor’s low fence.
text: He waits, excitedly, organizing his arsenal while stealthily
text: peering over the fence. He watches the teens while they’re
text: inside his house. Meanwhile, he makes more snowballs.
text: The teenagers come outside with Claire. Max holds a snowball,
text: giddy with anticipation. He waits until they’re close enough
text: and then jumps up and unleashes his projectiles. His aim
text: isn’t so good, but he has the element of surprise on his
text: side. A few snowballs hit the teenagers, and when they see
text: that it’s him, they laugh and start throwing snowballs back.
text: The fight is on.
text: As Max is reloading, a large mound of snow is dumped on his
text: back. The boys are close now, on the other side of the fence.
text: It’s time to retreat. Max bolts. He runs across the street,
text: giddy -- the thrill of battle.
text: He gets to his fort just in time and dives inside. He slides
text: into his little cave - nervous and happy. He’s safe.
text: But the boys are upon him. Through the fort’s entrance, he
text: sees them approach.
text: An arm comes through the side, searching for Max. Max squirms
text: out of the way, his eyes wide with alarm.
text: Then there’s a sickening crunch from above. Another crunch.
text: They’re on the roof. Max looks up. The ceiling caves in.
text: Max is trapped in a world of cold white.
text: He claws his way out of the top, and we see his face, red,
text: wet with snow and tears. He’s cold and humiliated.
text: The two boys see how upset Max is. They pull back, feeling
text: awful. They walk back across the street.
text: A horn honks - everyone is waiting. The boys run back to the
dialog: car.
text: Max, hurt and shamed, looks for Claire among the teenagers.
text: He finds her. Max and Claire lock eyes. Claire looks worried
text: and feels bad for Max. Max hopes that Claire will come over,
text: to help and comfort him - even to stick up for him.

text: Carol is crying hysterically as he chases Max toward the
text: forest, both of them at full speed. Max darts through a low,
text: small opening in the dense forest - too small for Carol to
text: fit through. Carol crashes head first into the trees.
text: The forest is too dense. Carol grinds to a halt, stuck in the
text: trees. Max ploughs on, rushing through the dense woods.
text: Carol watches him escape.
text: Max continues through the woods. He breaks through the
text: foliage onto a forest path.
text: Max runs down the path. The sound of Carol yelling echoes in
text: the distance. Max is looking back, trying to see where Carol
text: is, and runs full-speed into K.W.
dialog: K.W.
dialog: Cc’mon, C’mon. C'mere.
text: K.W. has a look of desperation on her face, and Max spends a
text: split second trying to read it. Carol is getting closer.
text: She grabs his arm and yanks him off the path.
text: Carol runs by, growling ferociously. He's terrifying now,
text: without any trace of the more civilized or charming Carol.
text: Now he's pure id, a raging animal.

dialog: K.W.
dialog: Get in. Crawl inside my mouth.
dialog: I‘1l hide you!
text: The growling of Carol gets louder. Max realizes that he has
text: no choice. He starts, tentatively, to crawl into K.W.'s
text: mouth. Once he’s half-way in, she swallows him whole.
text: Max lands inside of KW, where there are some rocks and sticks
text: and “Richard” the raccoon. Richard is hanging out, eating
