text: FATHER JAMES LAVELLE, fifties, is idly reading Moby Dick.
text: Dressed in an old-fashioned black soutane. He hears

speaker_heading: MAN’S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: I first tasted semen when I was
dialog: seven years old.
scene_heading: HOLD CLOSE on LAVELLE.
speaker_heading: MAN’S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Nothing to say?
speaker_heading: LAVELLE
dialog: It’s certainly a startling opening
dialog: line.
speaker_heading: MAN’S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: What is that, irony?
speaker_heading: LAVELLE
dialog: I'm sorry, let’s start again.
dialog: Are you...What do you...What do
dialog: you want to say to me? I’m here to
dialog: listen to whatever you have to say.
speaker_heading: MAN’S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: I was raped by a priest when I was
text: seven years old. Orally and anally,
dialog: as they say in the court reports.
dialog: This went on for five years.
dialog: Every other day for five years.
dialog: I bled a lot, as you can imagine.
dialog: I bled a terrible amount.
speaker_heading: LAVELLE
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: Have you spoken to anyone about--
speaker_heading: MAN’S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: I'm speaking to you now.
speaker_heading: LAVELLE
dialog: I mean, have you sought professional
dialog: help?
speaker_heading: MAN’S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Why, so I could learn how to cope?
dialog: So I could learn how to live with it?
dialog: Maybe I don’t want to cope. Maybe T
dialog: don’t want to learn how to live with it.
speaker_heading: LAVELLE
dialog: Why don’t you make a formal complaint?
dialog: You can testify--

speaker_heading: MAN’S VOICE (0.S.)
text: The man’s dead.
text: There is silence for a moment.
speaker_heading: LAVELLE
dialog: I don’t know what to say to you.
dialog: I have no answer for you, I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: MAN’S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: What good would it do anyway, if he
dialog: were still alive? What'd be the point
dialog: in killing the bastard? That’d be no
dialog: news. There’s no point in killing a
dialog: bad priest. But killing a good one?
dialog: That'd be a shock, now. They wouldn't
dialog: know what to make of that.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I’m going to kill you, Father.
dialog: I’m going to kill you ‘cause you've
dialog: done nothing wrong. I’m going to kill
dialog: you ‘cause you're innocent.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Not right now, though. I’11 give you
dialog: enough time to put your house in order.
dialog: Make your peace with God. Sunday week,
dialog: let’s say. I’11 meet you down on the
text: beach there. Down by the water there.
dialog: (with a laugh)
text: Killing a priest on a Sunday.
dialog: That’1l be a good one.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Do you not have anything to say to
dialog: me, Father?
speaker_heading: LAVELLE
dialog: Not right now, no. But I’m sure 1/11
dialog: think of something. By Sunday week.
text: There is a pause. Then the MAN laughs. The confessional
text: door is heard opening and closing. LAVELLE waits.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - DAY

speaker_heading: MICHEAL
dialog: Sorry, Father.
speaker_heading: LAVELLE

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: 9
speaker_heading: MICHEAL
dialog: A ploy, Father?
speaker_heading: LAVELLE
dialog: (untying his cincture)
dialog: A ploy, Micheal. I’ve noticed my

text: somewhat diminished of late.
dialog: I’m wondering is this some kind of
dialog: ploy you're working to cover up
dialog: for the wine you've been imbibing
dialog: on the q.t.
speaker_heading: MICHEAL
dialog: I have no idea what you are talking
dialog: about.
text: LAVELLE removes his stole. Studying MICHEAL all the while.
speaker_heading: MICHEAL
dialog: Father Leary noticed nothing amiss.
speaker_heading: LAVELLE
dialog: Father Leary does not know you as
dialog: well as I do, Micheal. I’d say he
dialog: may well underestimate the depths
dialog: of your Machiavellian chicanery.
speaker_heading: MICHEAL
dialog: can I go now, Father?
speaker_heading: LAVELLE
dialog: What’s the hurry? Have they called

speaker_heading: LAVELLE

speaker_heading: LEARY *
dialog: Your one with the big black eye on
dialog: her, have you seen her?
speaker_heading: LAVELLE
dialog: Veronica Brennan. I have, yeah.
speaker_heading: LEARY *
dialog: She’s an odd one. The things she
text: comes out with. It’s like she’s
dialog: trying to drag you down into the
dialog: muck. D’you know what felching is?
speaker_heading: LAVELLE
dialog: I do know what felching is, yeah.
speaker_heading: LEARY *
dialog: I had to look it up.
speaker_heading: LAVELLE
dialog: This is you not going into details
dialog: is it?
speaker_heading: LEARY *
dialog: Oh sorry. Anyway, whatever’s going
dialog: on with her it’s obviously all gotten
text: out of hand and she’s being knocked
dialog: around now.
speaker_heading: LAVELLE
dialog: Well if you speak to her she’ll raise
dialog: holy hell and say it was on the basis
dialog: of something she said to you in the
dialog: confessional.
speaker_heading: LEARY *
dialog: I know, I know. We can’t have that.
dialog: She’1l' get me excommunicated, the cow.
speaker_heading: LAVELLE
dialog: I'll have a word with her. Jack as
dialog: well. Part of my pastoral duties and
dialog: what-have-you, nothing to do with her
dialog: confession or anything. See what’s

speaker_heading: LEARY

text: REVERSE-SHOT ~~ LAVELLE looking over MICHEAL’s shoulder,
text: impressed. MICHEAL ignoring him as he scratches away.
speaker_heading: LAVELLE
text: Not bad. Surprisingly.
dialog: I was expecting a daub.
speaker_heading: MICHEAL
dialog: I was thinking, though, Father,
dialog: what if I was no good at all?
speaker_heading: LAVELLE
dialog: How do you mean?
speaker_heading: MICHEAL
dialog: I mean, what if there’s something
dialog: you really want to do, or something
dialog: you really want to be, but you're

text: LAVELLE enters, turning on the light, closing the door.

text: Whitewashed walls without adornment, save for a crucifix.
text: Cupboard. Writing desk with a large white seashell. Two
text: chairs, one at the desk, one beside the bed.
text: He tosses Moby Dick onto the bed. Bruno yawns. He sits on

text: Removes one of his black leather Oxfords. Then the other.
text: Pauses, the second shoe still in his hand. Thinking.
text: Puts down the shoe beside its comrade. Gets up and goes to

speaker_heading: LAVELLE
dialog: I don’t know. I’m not sure.
speaker_heading: MONTGOMERY
dialog: “Not sure” means it’s possible.
speaker_heading: LAVELLE
dialog: Yes. I suppose.
text: MONTGOMERY puts down the scone. Licks his fingers.
speaker_heading: MONTGOMERY
dialog: You didn’t grant him absolution,
dialog: obviously.
speaker_heading: LAVELLE
dialog: He didn’t ask for it.
speaker_heading: MONTGOMERY
dialog: Well there you have it. The man is
text: not penitent. There is no contrition.
text: He’s threatening to commit a crime,
dialog: not asking for forgiveness for one.
dialog: The inviolability of the sacramental
dialog: seal does not apply.
speaker_heading: LAVELLE

dialog: I joined the priesthood.
speaker_heading: HERLIHY
dialog: You can do that, can you?
speaker_heading: HARTE
dialog: It would appear so.

speaker_heading: VERONICA

speaker_heading: LEARY
dialog: I don’t know about that, now. And

speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: I don’t know, maybe I’m exaggerating.
dialog: You were a highly-functioning

speaker_heading: LAVELLE

speaker_heading: LAVELLE
dialog: Cheap cynicism.
speaker_heading: BRENNAN
dialog: No, not cheap, now. That’s a cynicism
dialog: that was hard-won. That's a cynicism
dialog: that was earned after a hell of a lot
dialog: of psychological and physical torture.
speaker_heading: LAVELLE
