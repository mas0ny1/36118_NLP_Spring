dialog: the-art residential protection.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.0.)
dialog: I might have five minutes.
dialog: 
text: We hear the WHRRRRR of POWER TOOLS going to work on his door.

text: The sleek lobby is deserted. We SEE, through the GLASS, lying
text: on the floor, the barest glimpse of the FEET of what are
text: presumably TWO DEAD SECURITY GUARDS -- although their bodies
text: are largely hidden behind their massive curly walnut desk.
text: All the security monitors are BLACK -- the feeds clearly cut.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.O.)
dialog: They've become sophisticated.
dialog: Before they couldn't have done

speaker_heading: EDDIE MORGAN,
dialog: 
text: 30's, lean and stylish, standing on the exterior ledge of his
text: multimillion-dollar terrace. New York City looms around him,
text: beneath him. His hands are outstretched. Balancing. He is
text: calm, but fatalistic. He's clearly going to jump.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I will never let them touch me.
dialog: 
text: His attention is CAUGHT by the SOUNDS of a commotion in the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.0.)
dialog: My neighbor must've heard the
text: noise. Opened his door to complain.
dialog: 
text: Two MUFFLED SHOTS - the neighbor drops. The door is pounded
text: again. It doesn't give.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: He bought me half a minute. I wish
dialog: he hadn't. Last thoughts are self-
dialog: pitying and mine are no exception:
dialog: the waste. The waste of it all. I
dialog: mean, how many of us ever know what
dialog: it is to become... the perfect
dialog: version of ourselves. I'd come
dialog: that close. To having an impact on
dialog: the world.
dialog: 
text: The pounding intensifies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And now, the only thing I'd have an
dialog: impact on...
dialog: 
text: He looks over the railing...

speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

dialog: 
text: Eddie is walking down the street, messily eating a street
text: falafel. His hair is longer, his clothes schlumpier, his face

speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Look, I'm going to give 90 pages to

dialog: for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Then you know I could use a friend.

speaker_heading: LINDY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.0.)
dialog: She knew what was beckoning: the
dialog: lower bunk in my childhood bedroom
dialog: in Newark. We'd even had sex on it

dialog: 
scene_heading: THE LITTLE WHITE PILL
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EDDIE'S BUILDING - STAIRWELL - DUSK
dialog: 
text: It's a former tenement, fourth-floor walk-up. Eddie trudges
text: up the old stairs, the tiny tiles worn away in spots, the
text: Victorian moldings disfigured from a hundred and twenty years
dialog: of paint.
dialog: 
text: Eddie is suddenly seized by a racking cough -- a horrible
text: smoker's cough that makes him double over. He sounds like
text: he's 80 years old. He finally gets it under control, gets a
text: glimpse of himself in the storefront window. He looks bad,
text: and he knows he looks bad.
dialog: 
text: He reaches into his pocket. THE PILL sits teasingly in the
text: palm of his hand, looking up at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.0.)
dialog: Well. There was less than nothing
dialog: to lose.
dialog: 
text: Quickly, impulsively, he swallows it.

speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: Look, enough, okay--?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Just tell him-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: Steve handles the rents. So feed
dialog: your fucking bullshit to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.0.)
dialog: I suddenly had extra reason to get
dialog: away from her. I had thoughtlessly
dialog: ingested a substance.
dialog: 
text: Valerie's tirade FADES up or down, depending on when we're
dialog: hearing Eddie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: --Like the rent's not low enough--!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.0.)
dialog: I had gotten remarkably little

speaker_heading: VALERIE

dialog: 
scene_heading: EDDIE'S POV - THE APARTMENT UPPER HALL...
dialog: 
text: The room is changing... springing into sharper focus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.0.)
dialog: Levels more, layers more, 3-D
dialog: more... galactically more. But the
dialog: same. Just the depth and beauty...
dialog: of clarity.
dialog: 
text: There seems to be more definition, more dimension, a little
text: more light -- he can see more clearly. The SOUND drops out
text: for a moment; he can see VALERIE'S FACE, mouth contorted,
text: continuing to heap the abuse, but there's something in her
text: eyes that's not mean... something anxious.He looks at her
text: with a sudden keen intelligence. And sympathy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong?

dialog: 
text: 3. Eddie tosses the finished pretzel's wrapper and SHAKES HIS

speaker_heading: WHAT HAP-

speaker_heading: VERN
dialog: Don't ask.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERN
dialog: It doesn't have a street name yet,

speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, there's no time for human

speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: Until they weren't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Same rules, even in a panic. It's

speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: EDDIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Already I recognized it... the

speaker_heading: EDDIE

scene_heading: INT. THE REGENCY HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY

speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: VAN LOON

dialog:

speaker_heading: VAN LOON (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: LINDY'S

dialog: Badly.
dialog: 
text: He sinks to his knees, hand to his cheek, welling blood.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Well, it's nothing you can cook up

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Meaning...?

speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Clinical trials. Guinea pig
dialog: people.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: That's too long.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: It's what it is. Or you'll kill

speaker_heading: MONTHS--
dialog: 
text: Eddie tosses the envelope back at him, gets up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Two million dollars if you do it in

text: He holds up the packet. The guy considers. Then slowly

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.O.)
dialog: It was all going to work out...
dialog: 
text: His eyes flicker upwards. His two SECURITY MEN are seated at
text: the bar. The CAMERA PANS to find... Also seated at the bar,
text: is the DETECTIVE who questioned Eddie at the police station!
dialog: 
text: Eddie gets up, "casually" wanders over to where the detective
text: is sitting, pretends to order another drink. He does not make
text: eye contact with the detective, or look like he's talking to
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.0.)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: ...well, a unified front between

dialog: lethally effective, and not a
dialog: moment too soon.. SyCorps, Andine

text: secretly sniffing out...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANK ATWOOD
dialog: How do you know this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Well, the governmental bribe
dialog: structure is, in itself, corrupt,
dialog: so of course information about its
dialog: inner workings, like anything, can
dialog: be bought. And there are other
text: barbarians waving cash at the
dialog: gates. I have a list here, in

speaker_heading: ATWOOD
dialog: Go on.

scene_heading: INT. VAN LOON'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: VAN LOON

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: All right. If all this comes

speaker_heading: VAN LOON
dialog: You should have pre-negotiated.

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I trust you.

speaker_heading: VAN LOON

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Well, given the scale of my

speaker_heading: VAN LOOK
dialog: ...But you're not going to continue

speaker_heading: VAN LOON

dialog: Onto the next...?
dialog: 
dialog: Van Loon didn't get to where he is for nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAN LOON (CONT'D)
dialog: I would really love to know what,

dialog: payout, is "next" to you. But
dialog: you're not going to tell me that,
dialog: either.
speaker_heading: (SMILES)
dialog: And I'm not sure I want to know.

speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.O.)
dialog: It was, as it turned out, a good

dialog: own. This is new, and Eddie wasn't expecting it.
dialog: 
text: Gennady's security guys eye Eddie's security guys, and vice
text: versa. Gennady is wearing a suit and looks much more
text: sophisticated. Eddie hands Gennady a small envelope. Gennady
text: takes it. In his eyes is a penetrating intelligence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Right away, it was obvious he was
text: on MDT.
dialog:

text: laughs, an unpleasant sound.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GENNADY
dialog: I don't think your Forbes 400 new

speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.0.)

scene_heading: MRS. HANK ATWOOD
dialog: There is absolutely no truth to the

text: puts it to his ear. It's dead.
dialog: 
text: He pushes the "on" button again and again. Nothing. The

text: CLOSET. In the closet is a state-of-the-art SECURITY MONITOR.
dialog: 
text: Gennady and TWO MEN are outside his door! Suddenly the
text: MONITOR goes BLACK. Eddie flicks the switch on the monitor.

dialog:

scene_heading: THE CELL PHONE - CLOSE

dialog: 
text: Steadman suddenly chuckles -- not at all concerned by this.
text: Even amused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEADMAN
dialog: We were right about you Eddie -
dialog: you're gonna go all the way. Let's
dialog: not do anything to jeopardize that.
dialog: There's no downside here - we're
dialog: offering you a limitless supply
dialog: with fewer side effects. I think
dialog: you'll be pleased with the
dialog: arrangement.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Come on, let's get some lunch. I'm
dialog: starving...
dialog: 
text: He heads for the door. Eddie remains still.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Tell me something.
dialog: 
text: Steadman stops, looks back at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Did I kill that woman?
dialog: 
text: Steadman looks puzzled that Eddie would ask.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEADMAN
dialog: Do you really want to know?
dialog: 
text: Eddie thinks. No, he doesn't.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS BUILDING - DAY
dialog: 
text: Eddie and Steadman exit, come down the steps, Eddie looking
text: thrown. He drifts along, half-a-step behind Steadman, deep
dialog: in thought.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEADMAN
dialog: It's not so bad, is it?
dialog: 
text: Eddie doesn't answer.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEADMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Doesn't every man on the path to
dialog: greatness have to tolerate the wind-
dialog: drag of compromise?
dialog: 
text: A black LIMO waits at the curb.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEADMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Overall, we'll all be better off...
dialog: foreign policy, the courts, even
dialog: the Constitution could stand a
dialog: little tweaking...
dialog: 
text: They descend the last few steps. Steadman opens the limo
dialog: door for Eddie...
dialog: 
text: But Eddie hesitates. Doesn't get in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEADMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Eddie?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: After you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEADMAN
speaker_heading: (CORDIAL)
dialog: No, "Senator". You first.
dialog: 
text: Eddie gestures for him to get in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Please.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEADMAN
dialog: All right then...
dialog: 
text: He gets in. And Eddie CLOSES THE DOOR AFTER HIM. Stands
text: outside the limo, looking back at Steadman through the rolled-
text: down window, his face a cold mask.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEADMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, now. Don't underestimate us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Don't underestimate your own
dialog: creation.
dialog: 
text: Steadman looks at him quizically.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, you invented it. What does
dialog: it do? It puts me 50 steps ahead
dialog: of you fucks.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You think I didn't spend my days on
dialog: MDT devising a personal defense
dialog: structure that would scare the shit
dialog: out of the Israelis--? You think
dialog: there's not people with a bead on
dialog: you right now, right in this
dialog: building? You think this
dialog: conversation is private?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEADMAN
dialog: You don't know the caliber of
dialog: enemies you'll be making.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You want to push that button? I'll
dialog: show you my silos if you show me
dialog: yours.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEADMAN
dialog: You'll run out. You'll die.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Or I'll think of something. Isn't
dialog: that what MDT does? Makes you
dialog: think of something? Might even
dialog: tell me how to get off it.
dialog: 
text: A flicker in Steadman's eyes. Anger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: What if I just ask the drug... how
dialog: to tell the drug... how to fuck
dialog: itself? I mean, isn't it like the
dialog: 8-ball?
dialog: 
text: Steadman raises his hand to the driver and the limo pulls
dialog: away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: It always answers.
dialog: 
text: As the limo recedes into the distance, Eddie finally exhales.
dialog: 
dialog: And only then do we see it.
dialog: 
text: He's scared.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE END
