speaker_heading: TUMNUS
dialog: Why, I'm a faun! And you must be some

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I'm not a dwarf, I'm a girl! And actually

speaker_heading: TUMNUS

speaker_heading: TUMNUS

speaker_heading: TUMNUS
dialog: No, were not alike at all really.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: My father is fighting in the war.
speaker_heading: TUMNUS
dialog: My father went away to war too... but
dialog: that was a very long time ago... before
dialog: this dreadful winter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Winter isn't all bad. There's ice skating
dialog: and snow ball fights. Oh! And Christmas!
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUMNUS
dialog: We haven't had Christmas in a hundred
dialog: years here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (shocked) No presents for a hundred
dialog: years?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUMNUS
dialog: But, oh, you would have loved Narnia
dialog: in spring! The Dryads and the Fauns
dialog: would dance all night... but we never
dialog: got tired. And oh, the music! Such music.
dialog: Would you... like to hear some now?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: yes please
speaker_heading: TUMNUS
dialog: (gets flute out) Now, are you familiar

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (shakes her head): No, I'm afraid I'm
dialog: not
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUMNUS
dialog: Good, because this probably won't sound
dialog: anything like one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Oh I must go
speaker_heading: TUMNUS
dialog: It's too late for that now I'm such
dialog: a bad faun
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: No. You're the nicest faun I've ever
dialog: met.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUMNUS
dialog: Then I'm afraid you've had a very poor
dialog: sampling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I'm sure you're very sorry, and you'll
dialog: never do it again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUMNUS
dialog: It's not something I have done, Lucy
dialog: Pevensie. It's something I'm doing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: TUMNUS
dialog: I'm kidnapping you. It's the White Witch,
dialog: the one that makes it always winter,
dialog: and never Christmas. She told me that
dialog: I If I ever was to come across a son
dialog: of Adam or a daughter of Eve, I am supposed
dialog: to turn it over to her!

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDMUND
dialog: Edmund, your majesty.
speaker_heading: WHITE WITCH
dialog: And how was it, Edmund, that you came
dialog: to enter my dominion?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDMUND

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHITE WITCH
dialog: Your sister? How many are you?
speaker_heading: EDMUND
dialog: four
speaker_heading: WHITE WITCH
dialog: Edmund you look so cold! Come and sit

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDMUND
dialog: Yes...your majesty.(Take vial and drops

speaker_heading: EDMUND
dialog: They're nothing special
speaker_heading: WHITE WITCH
dialog: I have no children of my own and you
dialog: are such a good little boy (I never
dialog: could hear those words right) where
dialog: I could see, one day, you becoming prince

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDMUND
dialog: (mouth full) Really?
speaker_heading: WHITE WITCH
dialog: (nods) Of course you'd have to bring
dialog: your family.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDMUND
dialog: They're nothing special
speaker_heading: EDMUND
dialog: Oh, Peter will be king too?
speaker_heading: WHITE WITCH
dialog: No! But a king needs servants.
speaker_heading: EDMUND
dialog: I-I guess I could bring 'em.
speaker_heading: WHITE WITCH
dialog: Beyond these woods, do you see those

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You saw the faun?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Well, he didn't actually go there with

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDMUND
dialog: I-I was just playing along. You know
dialog: what little children are like these
dialog: days, they just don't know when to stop

dialog: No, not her - the forest!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You're-you're not saying you believe
dialog: her?

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: No, not her - the forest!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You....you actually believe her?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Well don't you?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Well, logically it couldn't possibly
dialog: be there!

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: What do they teach at these schools?

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, this would be the first time.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Well then, id your sister isn't lying
dialog: and isn't mad then logically we must

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Are you ready then?
speaker_heading: EDMUND
text: Are you? (smacks his bat on the ground

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don't suppose saying we're sorry would

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: No, it wouldn't. But this might!

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Come and take it then.
speaker_heading: WHITE WITCH
dialog: You think that a simple threat will

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHITE WITCH
dialog: You know, Aslan, I'm a little disappointed

dialog: giving your life you would save the
dialog: Human boy? Ha. You are giving up your
dialog: life, and saving no one. So much for
dialog: love.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHITE WITCH

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: We saw the Witch, the knife.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: If the Witch knew the true meaning of
dialog: sacrifice, she might have interpreted
dialog: the Deep Magic a little differently.
dialog: For she would know that if a willing
dialog: victim who had committed no treachery
dialog: died in a traitors stead, the Stone
dialog: Table would crack and death itself would
text: begin to unwind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: We sent the word that you were dead.
