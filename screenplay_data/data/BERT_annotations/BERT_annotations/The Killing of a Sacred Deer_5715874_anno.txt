text: THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER
text: Inspired by a Euripides tragedy, THE KILLING OF A SACRED
text: DEER centres on Steven, a charismatic surgeon, and a teenage
text: boy who seeks to integrate him into his broken family. When the
text: boy’s actions become increasingly sinister, Steven’s ideal life starts
text: to fall apart and he is forced to make an unthinkable sacrifice.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - OPERATING THEATRE - MORNING
text: STEVEN, a cardiothoracic surgeon, around 45 years old,
text: MATTHEW, an anaesthetist of around 55, and three SURGICAL
text: NURSES are leaning over the chest of a patient. They are
text: performing open heart surgery. We follow the surgical
text: instruments as they explore the patient’s internal organs.
text: The surgeon’s movements are precise, considered. The
text: procedure unfolds in perfect synchronicity. No one misses a
text: beat. The only sounds are the clink of metal instruments, the
text: doctors’ breathing, and the electronic beep of the heart
dialog: monitor.
scene_heading: BLACK SCREEN - OPENING CREDITS
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - SURGERY PREPARATION ROOM - MORNING
text: Steven and Matthew stand at a sink, washing their hands.
text: Their scrubs are splattered with blood. The overhead lighting
text: is harsh. The anaesthetist takes his watch out of his pocket
text: and puts it on. The surgeon takes the anaesthetist’s hand and
text: studies his watch.
dialog: Steven
dialog: Nice watch.
dialog: Matthew
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What’s the water resistance?
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: 200 metres.
dialog: Steven
text: It also has a date display.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Yes, it does.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I might have gone for a metal strap
text: instead of a leather strap.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Oh, really?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yes. I think I’d prefer a metal
dialog: strap. I’ve had this one for years
dialog: and it’s as good as new.
text: He shows Matthew the watch he’s wearing, which has a metal
text: strap. Matthew studies it carefully.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: What’s the water resistance?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: 100 metres.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: How long have you had it?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Nine years. I’m a bit bored of it,
dialog: actually. I’ve been thinking about
dialog: getting a new one for a while now.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Think about it. We can go together
dialog: to the place where I bought it. If
dialog: I tell them you’re a colleague of
dialog: mine, a friend, they'll definitely
dialog: give you a better price. Both the
dialog: owner and his father have been
dialog: patients of mine, so I know them
dialog: quite well. Think about it.
text: Steven looks at Matthew’s watch again. He smiles almost
text: imperceptibly and with a nod assures Matthew that he will
text: think about it. The anaesthetist leaves the room.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - STEVEN'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON
text: Steven unlocks the door to his office. A small room with two
text: chairs, a two-seater sofa, and a metal locker. He opens the
text: locker, takes off his white coat and hangs it up. He puts on
text: a blazer and picks up his leather briefcase.
scene_heading: INT. BURGER KING - AFTERNOON
text: Steven sits in a Burger King, waiting for someone. He sips a
text: soft drink. There are barely any customers, it’s a slow time
text: of day. On the table in front of him is a small piece of
text: apple pie. MARTIN, a teenage boy, rushes over to Steven's
text: table. His face is flushed and his T-shirt is patchy with
text: sweat. Martin, around 15, is dressed like a typical teenager.
text: He has a nondescript face, not particularly likeable but not
dialog: unlikeable either.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Sorry to keep you waiting. Did you
dialog: eat?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I’ve just had some apple pie.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Do you mind if I grab something to
dialog: eat before we go? I’m starving.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Sure. No problem.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Are you sure you don’t want
dialog: anything? Chicken wings?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: No, thank you. I’m fine. Do you
dialog: have money? I can give you some.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: No, I’ve got money, thanks. I’1l be
dialog: right back.
text: The boy leaves. Steven’s mobile phone rings. He switches the
text: ringer to silent and ignores the call. He watches the boy as
text: he waits for his order. Martin comes back. Steven watches
text: Martin while he eats. The boy eats very methodically. He
text: folds his napkin neatly and puts it to one side.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Did you get a haircut?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes. Do you like it?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: It looks great.
text: A beat of silence.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Aren’t you going to eat your chips?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I’m saving them ‘til last.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I really like chips. I always save
dialog: them for last.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I do that too.
text: Martin finishes his burger then starts eating his chips. He
text: leaves half of them untouched and pushes his plate away.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Shall we go?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I’ve got French class in an hour.
dialog: Will I be back in time?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yes, definitely. Don’t worry.
scene_heading: EXT. SEASIDE ROAD - AFTERNOON
text: Steven and Martin are standing beside the car. It is parked
text: near the sea. The weather is fine, the sea calm. A few people
text: are swimming. The boy takes off his jacket.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Sorry I was late today, Steven.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: It doesn’t matter.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I was at a friend’s house. He got a
dialog: new motorbike and I wanted to check
dialog: it out. He took me for a ride,
dialog: that’s why I was late.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: It’s fine.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: He even let me ride it for a bit.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I hope you were wearing helmets.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes, of course we were. We weren’t
text: going very fast anyway.
text: A beat of silence.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I got you a present.
text: Steven hands Martin a small box. The boy opens the box.
text: Inside is a new watch. It’s the same one the anaesthetist was
dialog: wearing.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I don’t know how to thank you. It’s
dialog: really nice. Thank you so much. Can
dialog: I give you a kiss?
text: The doctor nods. The boy kisses him and strokes his cheek. He
text: slips the watch onto his right wrist.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you so much.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: It’s water resistant up to 200
dialog: metres.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Fantastic. Does this come off? I'd
text: prefer a leather strap.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: It comes off, yes. You can put on
dialog: any strap you like. But metal ones
dialog: are more hard-wearing, that’s why I
dialog: got you the metal strap. It’s more
dialog: expensive too.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes. Thank you so much.
scene_heading: EXT. STEVEN’S HOUSE - GARDEN - NIGHT
text: A detached suburban house. Steven is sitting at the garden
text: table with his two children: KIM, a girl of 14, and BOB, a 12
text: year old boy. A hush hangs in the air. The garden is
text: perfectly manicured and the flowers are well tended. The
text: doctor's wife brings out a dish with meat and starts to serve
text: everyone. She is around 40, rather beautiful. Her name is
speaker_heading: ANNA.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Dad, do you remember Claire, my
dialog: friend from school?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: KIM
text: It’s her birthday and she’s having
text: a party in two weeks. At her place.
text: She’s invited most of the class.
dialog: Can I go?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: We'll see.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Dad, if Kim goes can I go with her?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I don’t know, darling. Your mother
dialog: and I will discuss it and we’ll
dialog: see.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I say they can go. Claire is a very
dialog: nice girl. She’s the girl we met at
dialog: the mall with her parents who asked
dialog: you about becoming a doctor. The
dialog: one who wants to be a cardiologist.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yes, I remember.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: How was work today?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Fine. How about you?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I've decided to make a few changes
dialog: at the clinic. I’m going to get it
dialog: painted, buy a new sofa. I’m
dialog: thinking of doing it now before my
dialog: receptionist goes on leave. Did I
dialog: tell you she’s pregnant?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yes. Good for her.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes. She finally succeeded. She’s
dialog: thrilled.
dialog: (Looking at her son.)
dialog: Look at you, all hunched over.
dialog: You'll strain your back like that,
dialog: how many times do I have to tell
dialog: you? And your hair is practically
dialog: trailing in your food.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Bob, you promised me you'd get a
dialog: haircut and you still haven’t done
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'll get a haircut.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Tomorrow.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Not tomorrow, Dad. After the party.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I like his hair long. He has lovely
dialog: hair.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: What about mine?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You have lovely hair too. We all
dialog: have lovely hair. And darling, you
dialog: have to go to the dentist. It’s
dialog: been over six months, it’s time to
dialog: get your teeth cleaned again. I’1l
dialog: book an appointment for Friday
dialog: afternoon. Is Friday afternoon all
dialog: right? Do you have any appointments
dialog: at the hospital?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: No. Friday after five is fine.
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Anna is sitting in front of the mirror, removing her make-up.
text: Steven is lying in bed in his pyjamas, looking at something
text: on his phone. The room is dimly lit.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I bought that dress you liked. I
dialog: can wear it tomorrow. I can’t show
dialog: it to you now, it needed some
dialog: alterations. I’m picking it up
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: The black one?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It was the black one you liked,
dialog: wasn’t it?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yes. The other one looked great on
dialog: you too, but I think the black one
dialog: was perfect.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m worried it’s a bit too short.
dialog: I'd like it better if it was below
dialog: the knee.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You’ve got great legs. You’ve got
dialog: the most beautiful legs of any
dialog: ophthalmologist anywhere in the
dialog: world.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Let me think, yes, of all the
dialog: cardiologists in the world, there's
dialog: no doubt at all, you are most
dialog: definitely the biggest flatterer of
dialog: them all.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Is that a problem?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No, that’s not a problem. And
dialog: that’s why tomorrow I’m going to
dialog: bake a lemon cake and nobody’s
dialog: going to eat any of it, but you.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Not even the kids?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Not even the kids. Did I tell you
dialog: about my receptionist?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: If Kim was a bit more dependable,
dialog: she could help arrange the
dialog: appointments at the clinic until
text: Christina gets back.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Kim could handle that just fine.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I don’t know. I hope so. Did I tell
dialog: you, Bob announced me the other day
dialog: he wants to be an ophthalmologist.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yes, you did. Bob would be a coal
dialog: miner if you were one too. Do you
dialog: mind if I turn the light off?
text: Anna gets up and kisses him on the mouth for a long time.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No.
text: They carry on kissing with the lights on. Anna pulls Steven’s
text: pyjama bottoms off.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - STEVEN'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: Steven is examining a PATIENT. There is a knock at the door.
text: Steven’s SECRETARY enters.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Excuse me, Doctor. There’s a boy
dialog: for you outside. He says it’s
dialog: urgent.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I’ll be out in five minutes. Tell
dialog: him to wait.
scene_heading: 10 INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR —- MORNING
text: Steven sees Martin waiting for him in the corridor. He takes
text: him to one side.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Look I’ve told you, it’s best not
dialog: to come to the hospital without
dialog: calling me first.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: You're right. I’m sorry. I just
dialog: wanted to thank you again and show
dialog: you the new strap I got for my
dialog: watch. I swapped the metal strap
dialog: for a leather one. I’m sorry, I
dialog: didn’t mean to put you in an
dialog: awkward position. Bye.
text: The boy walks away.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Martin. Come here. What kind of
dialog: strap did you get?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (Without turning his head)
text: Brown leather.
text: The doctor hurries after the boy and catches up with him.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Show me.
text: Martin hesitates at first, then shows him the watch.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s very nice.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Do you really think so? Or are you
dialog: just being polite?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I really like it. Next time you
dialog: want to come here, please call me
dialog: first. You have my number. It’s for
dialog: your own good. I might be with a
dialog: patient or in surgery or ina
dialog: meeting. There’s no point you
dialog: waiting around if I can’t see you.
dialog: I’m telling you for your own good.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Okay.
text: Matthew walks past, holding a patient’s file.
text: to Steven and puts on his reading glasses.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Good morning, Matthew.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Could you please take a quick look
dialog: at this.
text: He shows Steven the file.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Of course, Matthew. Please leave it
dialog: on my desk. I’1l have a look ina
dialog: minute.
text: Martin looks at the anaesthetist.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: We've got the same watch.
text: The anaesthetist turns to look at Martin, who
dialog: watch.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Let me introduce you. This young
dialog: man is one of my son’s classmates.
dialog: I ran into Martin and his parents
dialog: at the mall last week. He told me
dialog: he’s very interested in medicine.
dialog: He wants to be a cardiologist. I
dialog: suggested he drop by some time, so
dialog: he can see what being a doctor is
dialog: really about. Martin, this is
dialog: Matthew, a great friend of mine and
dialog: an excellent anaesthetist.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: That's great. Nice to meet you.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Nice to meet you too. Steven, I’m
dialog: going to leave it on your desk. Let
dialog: me know when you’re ready.
text: The anaesthetist walks off.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I’ve got to go back in now. We'll

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - KIM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Steven, dressed in a suit and bow tie, sits opposite Kim. She
text: is doing voice exercises. She exhales slowly, controlling her
text: diaphragm, then takes a deep breath and runs through a series
text: of vocal scales. Bob has just had a shower and is combing his
text: hair very thoroughly and very slowly.
text: Steven watches his daughter with pride, holding her gaze as
text: she performs her vocal drills. When she finishes, Steven
text: claps, stands up, and kisses her on the cheek.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I think your breathing has really
dialog: improved over the last few months.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: That’s what the choirmaster said
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Did you tell him to move you closer
dialog: to the front?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Yes, I did. He said he’1ll see what
dialog: he can do.
text: Steven turns to Bob.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Did you water the plants, Bob?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Mum said she was going to water
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Your mother works very hard. That’s
dialog: why we said it would be nice to
dialog: help her as much as we can, and we
dialog: agreed that Kim would take care of
dialog: walking the dog and you would take
dialog: care of the plants.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'll do the dog and Kim can do the
dialog: plants.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You're too young to be wandering

text: Bob gives the comb to Kim.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Thanks for the comb.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: You’re welcome.

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’ve watered them already. Come on,

scene_heading: 12 INT. CARDIOLOGY CONFERENCE - HALL - NIGHT
text: Steven is at the podium giving a speech. The conference hall
text: is quite evidently full of doctors.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: A full 22 years have passed since
dialog: the German cardiologist Andreas
dialog: Gruentzig performed the first
dialog: coronary angioplasty, on 16
dialog: September 1977. Today, that first
text: patient is still alive and well.
dialog: Dr. Gruentzig, however, had an
text: unfortunate accident and met with
text: an untimely end. In short, he is
dialog: one of those rare cases where one
dialog: can say: “The operation was a
dialog: success, but unfortunately the
dialog: doctor didn’t make it.”
text: Scattered laughter in the audience. The doctor chuckles and
text: takes a sip of water before he continues.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (CONT'D)
dialog: In the two decades that have passed
dialog: since that first coronary
dialog: angioplasty, many things have
dialog: changed. The indications for
dialog: angioplasty are more widespread,
dialog: alternatives to the classic balloon
dialog: method have been developed, and an
dialog: angioplasty during the acute phase
dialog: of a heart attack is practically a
dialog: routine operation nowadays.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (CONT'D)
dialog: But now let’s touch upon the
dialog: importance, both for us doctors and
dialog: for our patients, of the
dialog: development and use of the stent.
text: Anna watches her husband with pride. Matthew, sitting next to
text: her, gets up.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: I'm going for a cigarette. I’1l be
dialog: at the bar. Come find me when it’s
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: 13 INT. CARDIOLOGY CONFERENCE - PARTY - NIGHT
text: Steven is talking to Anna, Matthew and an ELDERLY MAN, who is
text: holding a flamboyant cocktail.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY MAN
dialog: The guy who made it told me what
dialog: was in it. I can’t remember now but
dialog: it’s very refreshing. Would you
dialog: like one?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: No, thank you.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY MAN
dialog: Try it. It’s really delicious. Use
dialog: this straw, I haven’t touched it.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: He hasn’t had a drink in three
dialog: years. High GGT and elevated
dialog: transaminases.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY MAN
dialog: Good on you for not drinking.
text: Steven smiles.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Well, I wouldn’t say no toa
dialog: cocktail, if you’re still offering.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY MAN
dialog: Of course. I’1l get you one right
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I think we should go soon.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: It’s early.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: He’s got surgery in the morning and
dialog: he needs to get some sleep.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
text: It’s still early.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: We've got surgery in the morning.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Fine, okay. How are the kids?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: They're doing very well. Bob
dialog: started piano lessons and the
dialog: teacher says he’s really talented.
dialog: Now we need to buy him one so that
dialog: he can practise at home, but I
dialog: haven’t got round to it. I’m
dialog: renovating the clinic. I’m on the
dialog: phone all day.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Our daughter started menstruating
dialog: last week.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: (awkwardly)
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yes. She was a little scared, but
dialog: she’s okay now. You haven’t seen
dialog: her in ages.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Not since last summer. At that
dialog: school choir concert.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You’1l have to come over for dinner
dialog: one night. You really shouldn't
dialog: stay late either. Just drink that
dialog: cocktail you ordered and get
dialog: yourself home. You have to be at
dialog: the hospital in six hours. Shall we
dialog: go, darling?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yes.

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You're not wearing your watch.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes, I took it off to take a shower
dialog: and left it at home.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: It’s water resistant up to 200
dialog: metres.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Oh, that’s right. I forgot.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: If you don’t like it, we can go
dialog: back to the shop and you can choose
dialog: one that you do like.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: No, I really like it. I just took
dialog: it off to take a shower and forgot
dialog: to put it back on, that’s all.
text: Martin carries on eating his ice cream. It’s quite clear that
text: the subject is closed.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Do you have many friends?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Not that many. I don’t think people
dialog: can have a lot of friends. I mean,
dialog: it’s difficult. The important thing
dialog: in life is to have good friends,
dialog: not lots of friends. That’s what my
dialog: dad used to tell me.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Your father was absolutely right.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes, I know. I have a very good
dialog: friend from school who plays
dialog: basketball. We go and play together
dialog: sometimes. And a friend who lives
dialog: in France. I don’t see him very
dialog: often. He usually comes in the
dialog: summer with his family. He’s a
dialog: great guy, very polite, lots of
dialog: hobbies. I really miss him. I also
dialog: consider my mum to be a friend. I
dialog: know it might sound strange, but
dialog: ever since my dad died we’ve become
dialog: very close, me and my mum. We talk
dialog: about things, lots of things. She
dialog: helps me as much as she can with a
dialog: lot of stuff. And I help her too.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I'd like to ask you a favour. Only
dialog: if you want to of course, I don’t
dialog: want you to feel any pressure or
dialog: obligation. It just seemed to me
dialog: like a good idea, so I thought I'd
dialog: ask.
text: He hesitates for a moment.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd like you to come by my house
dialog: one day. To meet my wife and
dialog: children. I think you’d all get
dialog: along really well, especially with
dialog: Bob. They’re both lovely kids, I
dialog: think you'll get along great. What
dialog: do you think? Like I said, I don’t
dialog: want to pressure you, come only if
dialog: you'd genuinely like to.
text: Martin looks at him for a few seconds without saying
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Are you serious? I'd love to come

speaker_heading: STEVEN

text: Martin takes two small boxes out of his plastic bag and gives
text: them to Bob and Kim. They start unwrapping the presents.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
text: It’s a key ring with a musical note
dialog: on it for Kim, because I know she

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What lovely key rings. Now let’s
dialog: get a move on and eat before the
dialog: food gets cold. Are you hungry,
dialog: Martin?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes, I’m starving.
scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - KIM’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Martin is sitting on the edge of the bed. Bob is sitting next
text: to him. Bob is staring at Martin’s shoes, which are identical
text: to his own - probably another gift from Steven. Kim is
text: standing by the wardrobe. Martin stares at a photograph of
text: Kim, lying on a beach in a swimsuit. A child’s leg, probably
text: Bob's, is also visible beside her in the picture.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: How long have you been in the
dialog: choir, Kim?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Two years. Since I was 12. Do you
dialog: like singing?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I love it. But I haven’t got a very
dialog: good voice.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: How old are you?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Have you got hair under your arms
dialog: yet?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I just got my first period.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Do you mind if I light a cigarette?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You'd better not.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: It’s all right. Just go over by the
dialog: window.
text: Martin goes over to the window and smokes a cigarette.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Can you sing us something?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: What, now?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes. Anything you like.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Not right now.
speaker_heading: BOB
text: She's embarrassed.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: No I’m not. I just don’t feel like
dialog: it. When did you start smoking?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Eight months ago. I was over at a
dialog: friend’s place, it was a party
dialog: actually, and we’d had way too much
dialog: to drink and a girl offered me a
dialog: cigarette and I said “why not” and
dialog: lit up. That was a mistake. I
dialog: regret it, but it’s too late now.
dialog: I’m addicted.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Can you show me the hair under your
dialog: arms?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Sure.
text: Martin shows Bob his underarm hair.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You haven’t got that much. Have you
dialog: seen how hairy my dad is?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: He’s got three times more hair than
dialog: you do.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: You've got a great body.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Thanks.
text: An awkward pause.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you want to go out for a walk?
dialog: It’s a really nice day.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'd rather stay here and listen to
dialog: music.
text: Bob picks up his headphones and an MP3 player.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Is that my MP3 player or yours?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Mine. You've asked me a million
dialog: times. And don’t you dare take this
dialog: one and lose it as well, because
dialog: Dad said he’s not going to buy us
dialog: new ones.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: What kind of music do you listen
dialog: to?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: All kinds.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I‘m into metal and punk. What about
dialog: you?
dialog: 18
dialog: 19
dialog: 20
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I think all kinds of music are
dialog: worth listening to. It depends on
dialog: my mood and what I’m doing..
text: Bob puts his headphones on before Martin can finish his
dialog: sentence.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I'll come for a walk, if you like.
dialog: We can take the dog with us. If you
dialog: don’t mind.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I'd rather it was just the two of
dialog: us. I always get nervous around
text: dogs, in case they get into a fight
text: with another dog. Separating dogs
dialog: that are fighting scares me.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - AFTERNOON
text: Martin and Kim are walking along the road. There is an
text: awkward distance between them and they both stare straight
text: ahead. Martin has one hand in his jacket pocket and a
text: cigarette in the other. Kim walks a few steps behind him,
text: watching him. She picks up her pace and catches up with
text: Martin. She undoes her ponytail and shakes out her hair.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK —- AFTERNOON
text: Martin is sitting on a bench watching Kim. She stands facing
text: him, singing a song. Martin nods his head in time with the
text: music. Kim sways as she sings, not quite dancing. She holds a
text: lit cigarette in one hand.
scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Martin is sitting on the sofa. Kim sits next to him. Anna,
text: opposite them, is serving lemonade. On the table is a plate
text: with some carrot cake. The dog is staring at the cake. Bob
text: still has his headphones on.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Is this homemade lemonade?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: It’s amazing. My mother makes
dialog: lemonade too. But she hasn’t made
dialog: it in a while. I’1l ask her to make
dialog: some. I love lemonade.
dialog: 21.
text: He drains his glass of lemonade and refills it.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: The kids’ rooms are amazing. So big
dialog: and bright. I told Bob to put a
text: pull-up bar in his bedroom doorway.
dialog: I’ve got one and I do a few pull-
dialog: ups every time I walk past.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: That’s a great idea.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I don’t think so. Pull-up bars in
dialog: doorways are dangerous. You might
dialog: fall.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: If you attach it to the door frame
dialog: properly, you won’t fall.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Okay. If we get one, we’ll ask you
dialog: to come help us put it up.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: With pleasure. You know this whole
dialog: house is really amazing.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You're welcome to spend the night,
dialog: if you like. We can easily fit a
text: mattress on the floor next to Bob’s
dialog: bed. You can play together in the
dialog: morning and I'll drop you back home
dialog: tomorrow afternoon.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Thank you very much, but I’d rather
dialog: go home tonight. I don’t like
dialog: leaving my mother by herself. She
dialog: wouldn’t mind if I told her I was
dialog: spending the night here, but I'd
dialog: better not.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Whatever you like.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Can I have a piece of cake please?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Of course you can. What about you
dialog: guys?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: No.
dialog: 21
dialog: 22
text: Bob doesn’t respond.
scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT.
dialog: 22.
text: Anna is in the en-suite bathroom, flossing her teeth. Steven
text: is already in bed.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What a charming boy.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Isn't he?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes, very. How did his father die?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Car crash.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You should tell him to come round
dialog: again.
text: The doctor’s mobile phone rings. He ignores it.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I will. He'll be great company for
dialog: Bob. I thought next time I could
dialog: take them both out somewhere, for a
dialog: bike ride.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Darling, you should get that. It
dialog: might be the hospital.
text: Steven answers his phone. It’s Martin. Steven gets up and
text: leaves the room.
scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Steven goes out into the corridor. He tries to speak quietly.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Hello. How are you?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I'm fine, Martin. Has something
dialog: happened?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: No. I just called to tell you I had
dialog: a wonderful time today.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I’m very pleased to hear that.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes. I thought I should return the
dialog: favour, so I'd like to invite you
dialog: to dinner. At my house. My mother
dialog: will be delighted to see you. She
dialog: hasn’t seen you in two years, not
dialog: since the hospital. I asked her if
dialog: she'd like you to come for dinner
dialog: one day and she said she'd like
dialog: that very much. She’ll bake a meat
dialog: pie.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: That's very kind of you. We’1ll do
dialog: that someday.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Tomorrow night. I told her already.
dialog: I've asked her to make meat pie and
dialog: lemonade. I’1l be home by eight-
dialog: thirty. Around nine?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: All right. Around nine.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I can buy some non-alcoholic beers,
dialog: if you like.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: No, there’s no need.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I‘1l buy four and if you don’t
dialog: drink them it doesn’t matter. My
dialog: mother will drink them, or some
dialog: other guest another day. So I’1ll
dialog: see you tomorrow at nine. Good
dialog: night and sorry to disturb you. Are
dialog: Kim and Bob asleep?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I’m going to sleep now, too. Good

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - SURGERY PREP ROOM - MORNING
text: Steven pulls off his bloodied surgical gloves. He washes his
text: hands and then applies steriliser. Matthew, standing beside
text: him, takes off his disposable hat, gloves, and surgical mask
text: and throws them in the bin.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: A friend of mine brought me a huge
dialog: steelhead the other day. I thought
dialog: I'd barbecue it. Do you and Anna
dialog: want to come over for lunch on
dialog: Saturday?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I’d love to. I’1l talk to Anna
dialog: tonight to check we can make it and
dialog: let you know.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Does Anna eat fish?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yes, she does.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: I’m only asking because she seems
dialog: like quite a picky eater.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: No, she isn’t. She loves fish.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Perfect. Then you must come. Tell
dialog: her I'll be offended if you don’t.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CAR PARK - EVENING
text: Steven approaches his car. The car park is fairly dark.
text: Steven gets into his car and switches on the engine. As he
text: pulls away, he sees a figure moving behind some parked cars.
text: It looks like Martin. He’s wearing the same jacket as Martin,
text: but we can’t see his face. As Steven drives towards him, the
text: figure runs towards the fire escape, opens the door, and
dialog: disappears.
scene_heading: INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Steven, Martin and MARTIN’S MOTHER have just finished dinner.
text: Martin’s mother is around 45 years old, a little plump, and
text: has a beautiful face. She is dressed rather formally and is
text: heavily made up. The living room is spacious and decorated in
text: a conventional style. Everything is just so. Martin drains a
text: glass of lemonade. His mother clears away the dishes and
text: takes them into the kitchen.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Did you come to the hospital today?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: No. I was at school, then I went to
dialog: the gym and my French class.
dialog: Weren’t you at the hospital today?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I was, but I was really busy. I
dialog: just wondered whether you came by
dialog: and couldn’t find me.
text: Martin’s mother returns.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I'd like us to watch a film
dialog: together, if you don’t mind.
scene_heading: MARTIN'S MOTHER
dialog: I'd gladly watch a film.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I'm afraid I have to be getting
dialog: home soon. I can’t be out too late.
dialog: I didn’t tell my wife I’d be late
dialog: tonight and she might get worried.
scene_heading: MARTIN'S MOTHER
dialog: You could call her. In any case, if
dialog: you feel tired we can stop the
dialog: film, you can go home and we can
dialog: watch the rest next time you come.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Please. We've rented my favourite
dialog: film. It was my father’s favourite
dialog: film too.
scene_heading: INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Steven, Martin, and Martin’s mother are sitting on the sofa
text: watching the film. She looks rapt. Martin yawns.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I think I’1l go to bed. I’m tired.
dialog: Besides, I’ve got to get up early
dialog: tomorrow to finish my homework. I’m
dialog: sorry I can’t watch the end of the

scene_heading: MARTIN'S MOTHER
dialog: Good night.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Good night.
text: Sitting on the sofa side by side, Steven and Martin’s mother
text: carry on watching the film for a while.
scene_heading: MARTIN'S MOTHER
dialog: He really loves you, you know. He
dialog: talks about you a lot.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I love him too.
scene_heading: MARTIN'S MOTHER
dialog: Have you been married long?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: 16 years.
scene_heading: MARTIN'S MOTHER
dialog: You have lovely hands.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: MARTIN'S MOTHER
dialog: Most doctors have beautiful hands.
text: So white and soft and clean.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Really?
scene_heading: MARTIN'S MOTHER
dialog: Yes. I remember your hands from
dialog: back when I used to visit my
dialog: husband at the hospital. In fact, I
dialog: even told him about your hands and
dialog: he agreed. “You're right, he has
dialog: beautiful hands,” he said.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Thank you very much.
scene_heading: MARTIN'S MOTHER
dialog: Do you remember me coming to the
dialog: hospital?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Of course.
scene_heading: MARTIN'S MOTHER
dialog: I was a bit heavier then. And my
dialog: hair was brown.
dialog: She moves
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: MARTIN'S MOTHER
dialog: I got tired of it. I dyed it about
dialog: a month ago. Did you prefer me with
dialog: brown hair? Like it was back then?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I think it’s nicer now.
scene_heading: MARTIN'S MOTHER
dialog: Yes. I agree. Do you like the film?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yes, it’s good.
scene_heading: MARTIN'S MOTHER
dialog: It gets better. You’ll see. Would
dialog: you like some dessert?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: No, thank you.
scene_heading: MARTIN'S MOTHER
dialog: Maybe later, then. You did eat a
dialog: lot.
text: closer to him.
speaker_heading: MARTIN'S MOTHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Can I have a closer look at your
dialog: hands?
text: Steven looks embarrassed. Reluctantly, he extends a hand.
text: Martin’s mother looks at the doctor’s hand. She kisses it
text: momentarily, almost reverently. Then again and again, all
dialog: over. She
text: sticks his whole thumb in her mouth. He stands up.
speaker_heading: MARTIN'S MOTHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Don't be afraid. He’s definitely
dialog: asleep. There’s nothing to be
dialog: afraid of. In any case, he wants
dialog: this as much as I do, you know.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I have to go. It’s late. Thank you
dialog: for dinner. I have to go. Have a
dialog: good night.
scene_heading: MARTIN'S MOTHER
dialog: I’m sorry if I made you feel
dialog: awkward. I didn’t mean to. But I

speaker_heading: STEVEN

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - STEVEN’S OFFICE - MORNING
text: Steven walks into his office. Martin is there, sitting ina

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What are you doing here? Why aren’t
dialog: you in school?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
text: My heart aches.
text: The boy takes off his T-shirt.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
text: I’m in pain. It’s my chest, my
dialog: heart. I’m worried.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: There’s no reason for you to be
dialog: worried.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I’m worried because it’s
dialog: hereditary.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You're too young to be worried.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: That’s what you said about my
dialog: father. And he didn’t smoke, he ate
dialog: a very healthy diet, he went
dialog: swimming almost every day. He
dialog: should have come out of that
dialog: surgery alive but he died. I also
dialog: smoke. I started smoking recently.
dialog: (Touching his chest.)

text: Steven attaches some electrodes to the boy’s chest.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - STRESS TEST ROOM —- MORNING
text: Martin is running on a treadmill. Wires are attached to his
text: body. Steven measures Martin’s blood pressure while he runs.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - STEVEN’S OFFICE - MORNING
text: Martin removes the electrodes from his body and puts his T-
text: shirt back on.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: If I had hair on my chest and
dialog: stomach, how would you attach
dialog: these?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: We'd shave the hair off first.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: How long does it take for the hair
dialog: to grow back?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I don’t know. About a month, I
dialog: suppose.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Your son told me you have loads of
dialog: hair under your arms, three times
dialog: more than I do. And that you have a
text: hairy belly and a hairy back.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I probably do have a bit more hair
dialog: than you do because I’m older than
dialog: you. But you’1l soon have more hair
dialog: too. It’s all down to hormones.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Can I see? Please. Take off your
dialog: shirt and show me, please.
text: The doctor hesitates, but eventually complies. Martin stares
text: at his body.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, you do have more than me. But
dialog: not three times more.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Mum and I thought it would be nice
dialog: if you came for dinner with us
dialog: tonight, then we can watch the rest
dialog: of the film. Is nine good for you?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Thank you very much, but I’m afraid
dialog: I can’t make it tonight. I need to
dialog: be home.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Can’t you get away for a couple of
dialog: hours?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I'm afraid not. Some other time.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: My mother will be upset. I’11 tell
dialog: you a secret, but don’t tell her I
dialog: told you. I think she likes you. I
dialog: mean she’s attracted to you. She
dialog: says that’s not true, but I’m sure
dialog: of it. And to be honest, I think
dialog: you're perfect for each other.
dialog: You'd make a great couple. She’s
dialog: got a great body, you’ve seen that
dialog: for yourself. She lost weight and
dialog: now she’s has a really lovely
dialog: figure.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Your mother is very beautiful, but
dialog: the idea that she and I could ever
dialog: be together is ludicrous. Let me
dialog: remind you that I’m a married man
dialog: and I love my wife very much, and
dialog: my kids, and that we are very happy
dialog: together.
text: The boy looks at Steven, half sad and half angry. Tears well
text: up in his eyes.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (CONT'D)
dialog: And for your information, you're
dialog: absolutely fine. There’s nothing
dialog: wrong with you. But you really
dialog: should stop smoking. Do you
dialog: promise?
text: Martin stands up.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: So we’re okay? There’s nothing

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You couldn’t be healthier. Now
dialog: you'd better go because I’m late
dialog: for my rounds. Let’s talk tomorrow
dialog: or the day after and arrange to
dialog: meet again.
text: Steven heads towards the door.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I want you to buy me a motorbike. A

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: We'll talk about it next time we

scene_heading: INT. BURGER KING - AFTERNOON

text: A beat.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes. Where are you? I called you a

speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s so important? An operation?
dialog: Are you at the hospital? What sort

scene_heading: EXT. MATTHEW’S HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY

text: emerges from the house and sits in a chair. He looks ill at

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Where were you?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
text: I was inside, making a phone call.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW

speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Yes, right. Martin. I couldn’t
dialog: remember his name.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Where did you see him?
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
text: At the hospital. He was hanging
dialog: around beside your car. It looked
dialog: like he was waiting for you. I said
dialog: hello, but he pretended not to see
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: That's impossible. It can’t have
dialog: been him.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Maybe I was mistaken. But it looked
dialog: a lot like him.

speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: KIM

speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Martin. That boy who came over the

speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: KIM

speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: KIM

scene_heading: EXT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Martin is standing on the pavement opposite Steven’s house.
text: He watches the house with a blank expression that betrays no
text: emotion. He is holding a helmet under his arm. His friend’s

scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN —- MORNING
text: Steven, Anna and Kim are having breakfast. Bob is not there.
text: Steven seems agitated.
speaker_heading: KIM

speaker_heading: KIM

dialog: 36
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: “Certainly, when would you like to
dialog: come in?”
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: “Today. It’s urgent.”
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: “Today is impossible.”
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: “Please describe your symptoms.”
dialog: Then you come and talk to me and I
dialog: tell you whether it’s urgent or
dialog: not. Meanwhile, you ask them to
dialog: hold while you check to see whether
dialog: any appointments are available.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Did you wake up Bob?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I did. He just likes lying in bed
text: for a bit before he gets up. Leave
dialog: him be. Should I squeeze some more
dialog: orange juice?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: He’ll be late. Have you seen the
dialog: time? The school bus will be here
dialog: any minute.
text: Steven gets up and goes to get Bob out of bed.
scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BOB'S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Bob is sitting on the edge of his bed. As soon as his father
text: enters the room, Bob turns to look at him. His face is pale.
text: He looks a little frightened.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Robert, do you have any idea what
dialog: time it is? Get up and get dressed.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I can’t get up.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You have ten minutes to get washed,
dialog: dressed and eat your breakfast. I’m
dialog: not going to drive you to school
dialog: and neither is your mother.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I can’t get up.
dialog: 37
dialog: 38
dialog: 39
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Bob. Get up and get dressed and
dialog: stop messing about.
text: Steven goes to leave the room.
speaker_heading: BOB
text: Dad. My legs. They’re numb. I can’t

text: Bob is on the verge of tears.
scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - GARAGE - MORNING

scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE —- MORNING
text: Steven lifts Bob out of the car. He puts a hand around his
text: shoulder and practically carries his son into the hospital.
text: Anna follows them inside.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - NEUROLOGIST’S OFFICE - MORNING
text: DR. ANDREW NICHOLS, a neurologist, is examining Bob. The boy
text: is lying on a hospital bed. His shoes are off. Steven is
text: sitting in a chair, watching the whole procedure. He tries to
text: crack a joke to reassure his son.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I hope you washed your feet
dialog: yesterday, Bob, because Dr. Nichols
dialog: punishes boys who don’t wash
text: between their toes. He gives them
text: injections with big fat needles.
speaker_heading: DR. NICHOLS
text: Bob's feet are just fine and he has
dialog: lovely hair and he is very brave.
dialog: He’s all grown up now. You know I
dialog: had long hair when I was little,
dialog: too. Just like Bob.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I didn’t know that. Really?
speaker_heading: DR. NICHOLS
dialog: Yes, really. Only mine was curlier.
dialog: Now then Bob, I want you to tell me
dialog: where you are.
dialog: 40
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I’m at the hospital. In the
text: neurology department.
speaker_heading: DR. NICHOLS
dialog: That's absolutely right. And what
dialog: day is it today?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Thursday.
speaker_heading: DR. NICHOLS
dialog: Okay then. With this pin, I’m going
dialog: to touch the soles of your feet and
dialog: all your toes. I want you to tell
dialog: me if you can feel it. Don’t be
dialog: scared, I’m not going to prick you,
dialog: I’m just going to touch you. Okay?
text: Bob nods.
speaker_heading: DR. NICHOLS (CONT’D)
dialog: Perfect.
text: Bob can feel the pin under all his toes.
speaker_heading: DR. NICHOLS (CONT’D)
dialog: Perfect. Now, look directly into my
dialog: eyes for this one. As soon as you
text: see a finger move, point to it.
text: The neurologist spreads out his hands and fingers. Bob looks
text: him in the eye without moving his head. Dr. Nichols moves a
text: finger on the left, then a finger on the right, then both
text: fingers together. Bob points to the correct fingers every
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: DR. NICHOLS (CONT’D)
dialog: Okay, good. Now I’m going to test
dialog: your sensations. I want you to tell
dialog: me if this feels the same on both
dialog: sides.
text: He touches Bob on the left and right cheek, the left and
text: right ear, the left and right temple. Bob nods each time.
speaker_heading: DR. NICHOLS (CONT’D)
dialog: Now close your eyes as tight as you
dialog: can. Okay. Show me your teeth.
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - MORNING
text: Anna is waiting in the corridor. Steven and Bob go up to her.
text: Bob is limping a little, but he can walk.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Everything is absolutely fine.
dialog: Andrew gave him a thorough
dialog: neurological examination and he
text: passed with flying colours. It’s
dialog: nothing. You two go home and we’1l
dialog: talk tonight. I won’t be late, my
dialog: schedule is pretty light today.
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Maybe he should have an MRI.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: There’s no need to bother with all
dialog: that. He just got scared, that’s
dialog: all. He’s absolutely fine. You’re
dialog: absolutely fine, aren’t you?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I think there was probably some
dialog: test at school today that we
dialog: weren’t very well prepared for.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes, and he preferred to spend his
text: day at the hospital with Andrew and
dialog: us. Let’s go.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Dad, aren’t you going to show me
dialog: your office?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Another time, darling. I have to go
dialog: down to the operating theatre right
dialog: away.
text: Steven kisses his son and walks away.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I've have to go. See you tonight.

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - MRI SCANNER ROOM - MORNING
text: Bob is lying inside an MRI machine. Steven and Anna watch
text: from behind a glass window. Dr. Nichols is taking notes.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Bob is sleeping. Anna sits beside him. Steven stands talking
text: to Matthew. There is a second bed in the room, but it is
text: empty.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: You don’t have to operate tomorrow.
dialog: Cancel everything.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: No. Why would I cancel? The
dialog: schedule would go haywire. There's
dialog: no need. Anyway, it’s nothing.
text: The door opens and Dr. Nichols walks in.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Any news, Andrew?
speaker_heading: DR. NICHOLS
text: MRI and MRA both fine. Blood work
dialog: came back good. Cardiogram, chest X-
text: ray and carotid ultrasound all
text: clear.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I told you. I knew it.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thank goodness for that.
speaker_heading: DR. NICHOLS
dialog: Has he been under any psychological
dialog: stress lately? Exams at school
dialog: maybe?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No, he wasn’t stressed, he was just
dialog: fine. He’s always a bit anxious,
dialog: but that’s just the way he is.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: DR. NICHOLS
dialog: In my opinion, he should stay in
dialog: tomorrow as well so that we can
dialog: keep an eye on him.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Maybe we should give him a PET
dialog: scan?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I don’t think there’s any need for
dialog: that, do you Andrew? Tomorrow he’1l
dialog: be well enough to walk all the way
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: DR. NICHOLS
dialog: Yes, I don’t think that’s necessary
dialog: at this point. Let’s see how things
dialog: are tomorrow and take it from
dialog: there. There’s nothing to worry
dialog: about, in my opinion. You go home
dialog: and we'll speak tomorrow. I’1l be
dialog: here all day. Anna, it was great
dialog: seeing you, even under these
dialog: circumstances.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: And you, Andrew. How’s your
dialog: daughter?
speaker_heading: DR. NICHOLS
dialog: She got married last year. I’ma
dialog: grandfather now.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Give her my love.
speaker_heading: DR. NICHOLS
dialog: I will. Good night.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Goodbye, Andrew. Thanks for
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Do you want me to let them know
dialog: that you won't be operating
dialog: tomorrow?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I said no. Don’t go on about it.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: That won’t be necessary, Matthew.
dialog: I'll come in the morning. I won't
dialog: go in to the clinic. I’1l bring him
dialog: those cinnamon doughnuts he loves
dialog: so much.
dialog: 44
dialog: 45
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yes, I’m sure he’1l be thrilled.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
text: Martin is riding his friend’s motorbike. Kim sits behind him,

text: down Kim’s face, but it’s impossible to tell whether it’s
text: from the wind or if she’s crying for some other reason.
scene_heading: EXT. STEVEN’S HOUSE - GARDEN - NIGHT
text: Anna is watering the plants. Kim comes out into the garden.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Where were you?
speaker_heading: KIM
text: At Claire’s. Is Dad asleep?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: How’s Bob?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Bob is absolutely fine. They’ve
dialog: just kept him in as a precaution.
text: Kim looks at her mother for a while without saying anything.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: How are you?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m fine. How do you mean?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I mean are you tired?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m absolutely fine. A little
dialog: tired, that’s all.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: See you in the morning. Oh, and
dialog: while Bob’s in the hospital, you’1l

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR —- MORNING

text: hour at the hospital. They both greet various people as they
dialog: walk along.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Did he go to the toilet? Did he get
dialog: up?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: He hadn’t when I passed by about an
dialog: hour ago. He didn’t want to.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: He didn’t want to pee or he hadn’t
dialog: got up?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: He didn’t want to pee.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Could he get up?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: He was asleep. I didn’t want to
text: drag him out of bed.
text: They stop outside the door to Bob’s room.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT’S ROOM - MORNING
text: Steven and Anna enter Bob’s room. Martin is already there,
text: sitting next to Bob’s bed. Martin stands up.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Good morning, Doctor. How are you
dialog: Mrs. Murphy? I just came by to see
dialog: Bob. Kim told me what happened.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Hello, Martin. How nice of you. Hi
dialog: darling, good morning. Did your
dialog: friend Martin come to see you?
text: Bob does not reply.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I’1ll leave you alone now so that
dialog: you can spend time with him too. I
dialog: have to go anyway. I’1ll come by and
dialog: see him again some other time, for
dialog: sure. I offered to help him go to
dialog: the toilet but he didn’t want me to
dialog: and he wet the bed. I brought some
dialog: lemonade. Mum made it yesterday.
speaker_heading: (MORE )

dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Try it and let me know what you

speaker_heading: STEVEN

text: Anna goes over to Bob.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Darling, do you know what’s in this
dialog: box?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Cinnamon doughnuts, that’s what.
text: Martin goes over to Steven. Anna pulls off the sheets and
text: folds them up.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I'll be in the canteen. Come
dialog: whenever you can.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I don’t think I’1l have time today,
dialog: as you might imagine. We’ll talk
dialog: some other time.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: No. Today. Come to the canteen.
dialog: Just for ten minutes. Don’t stand
dialog: me up like last time. Goodbye Mrs.
dialog: Murphy. Bye, Bob.
text: Martin leaves. We hear Anna saying goodbye as we watch him
dialog: go.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CANTEEN - AFTERNOON
text: Martin is waiting in the hospital canteen. Steven appears.
text: The canteen is packed with doctors, nurses and patients,
text: seated at the tables.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Coffee? Apple pie?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I’ve only got ten minutes. I have
dialog: to be back upstairs in ten minutes
dialog: max.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Okay. I’1l get straight to the
dialog: point. I’ve brought you a present.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: You've given me so many presents
dialog: and I’ve never given you anything.
dialog: I thought that was rude of me. So I
dialog: decided to make amends. Close your
text: eyes.
text: Steven does not close his eyes.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Please close your eyes.
text: Steven, losing patience, closes his eyes. Martin places a
text: small box in his hand. Steven opens his eyes and sees the
dialog: box.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
text: It’s a Swiss army knife.
text: The boy puts his hand over his mouth, mortified.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: I shouldn’t have told you that. I
dialog: messed it up. I ruined the
dialog: surprise. I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Thank you very much, Martin.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: What an idiot.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: It doesn’t matter. Thank you very
dialog: much.
text: A PARAMEDIC approaches the doctor.
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
dialog: Good afternoon, Doctor.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Hello, Justin.
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
dialog: I got the car. Second-hand, but
dialog: still. Blue. I couldn’t find it in
dialog: silver.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: That’s great. You’ll have to take
dialog: me for a ride in it soon.
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
dialog: Yeah, sure. See you later.
text: The paramedic walks away.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: That reminds me, did you do
dialog: anything about that motorbike I
dialog: wanted?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Martin, I have to get back
dialog: upstairs.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: All right. I won’t keep you much
dialog: longer, even though you are
dialog: devoting less and less time to me
dialog: lately. But that’s okay, I
dialog: understand. I just wanted to say
dialog: one more thing. I’m really sorry
dialog: about Bob.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: It’s nothing serious.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: No, it is. That critical moment we
dialog: both knew would come someday, well,
dialog: here it is. The time is now. You’ll
dialog: see, things will be better for us
dialog: all after this. You know what I
dialog: mean.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: No, I don’t. Listen, Martin, I
dialog: don’t have time for this. I have to
dialog: be upstairs.
text: Steven stares at Martin in silence. The boy looks around to
dialog: make sure nobody can hear them, that nobody is sitting too
dialog: close.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (speaking fast, almost
dialog: without catching his
dialog: breath)
dialog: Okay, I’m going to tell you this as
dialog: quickly as I can so that I don’t
dialog: hold you up since I get that you
dialog: don’t have much time and you have
dialog: to go back up to the ward. I will
dialog: make myself as clear as possible.
dialog: Yes, it’s exactly what you think.
dialog: Yes. That’s it. Just like you
dialog: killed a member of my family, now
dialog: you have to kill a member of your
dialog: own family. To balance things out,
dialog: understand? I’m not going to tell
dialog: you who to kill of course, that’s
dialog: for you to decide. But if you don’t
dialog: do it, they all die. Bob will die.
dialog: Kim will die.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: And so will your wife. They will
dialog: all get sick and die. One:
dialog: paralysis of the limbs, two:
dialog: refusal of food to the point of
dialog: starvation, three: bleeding from
dialog: the eyes, four: death. One, two,
dialog: three, four. You’re not going to
dialog: get sick, don’t worry. You just
dialog: have to stay calm, that’s all.
dialog: There, I said it. As quickly as I
dialog: could. I hope I haven’t kept you
dialog: too long. Oh and one more thing,
dialog: but I'll be very quick. You only
dialog: have a few days to decide who to
dialog: kill. Once stage three kicks in -
dialog: remember what stage three is?
dialog: Bleeding from the eyes, that’s
dialog: stage three - once the bleeding
text: starts, they die in a matter of
dialog: hours. Well, don’t let me keep you.
dialog: I have nothing more to say. Unless
dialog: you have any questions.
text: Steven stares at Martin in silence. He is clearly furious. He
text: picks up his mobile phone and keys.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Get up and get out of here and
dialog: don’t you dare come back or call me
dialog: ever again. Now. Before I hit you.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: All right, I'll go. I have to go
dialog: anyway, I have French class to get
dialog: to. I was leaving anyway. But don’t
dialog: get angry. There’s really no point
dialog: getting mad at me. I told you. This
dialog: will do us all good. You'll see.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: If you ever come anywhere near me,
dialog: my wife, or my children again I
dialog: will kill you, I swear.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: But how will you kill me? Oh wait,
dialog: I have an idea. Why don’t you
dialog: operate on me?
text: Several people turn and stare at the doctor. Steven gets up
text: and leaves. Martin calls after him.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - AFTERNOON

text: and smoothing down his hair.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT’S ROOM - EVENING
text: Anna is sitting on the empty bed next to her son’s bed. She
text: is reading him a book. Steven comes in and sits in a chair.
text: He is restless.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Has he eaten?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No, he’s not hungry.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What do you mean he’s not hungry?
speaker_heading: ANNA
text: He’s not hungry.
text: Steven takes a doughnut out of the box. He reaches over and
text: puts it near his son’s mouth.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Come on, darling. Eat a doughnut.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I don’t want it, dad.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You do, but you're afraid that your
dialog: mother and I will tell you off for
dialog: eating doughnuts. Come on, eat it.
dialog: You have my permission. You have
dialog: our permission. It’s okay for him
dialog: to eat a doughnut, isn’t it Anna?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You heard your mother. Eat it.
text: He prises Bobs lips open and shoves the whole doughnut into
text: his mouth. Anna gets up and pulls Steven away from their son.
dialog: 51
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Leave him alone. He doesn’t want it
dialog: now. He’ll eat it later.
text: Steven does not back down. He gestures for Anna to sit back
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: That’s right. Chew it a bit. Now
dialog: swallow.
text: Bob spits the doughnut out.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Leave him alone. He said he doesn’t
dialog: want it now.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: He is going to eat it right now. He
dialog: is completely run down, that’s why
text: he keeps falling over and crawling
dialog: around on all fours. He’s going to
dialog: eat them, all of them. In five
dialog: minutes flat, I want to see this
text: whole box empty.
text: Steven storms out of the room, slamming the door behind him
text: as he goes.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - DIRECTOR’S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Steven, Anna, Dr. Nichols and the HOSPITAL DIRECTOR are
text: discussing Bob’s case. A FEMALE DOCTOR is standing beside

text: results out on the desk. The Hospital Director studies the
text: test results thoroughly, in silence.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: He stopped eating today. He keeps
text: vomiting.
text: The Hospital Director looks up at Anna and then looks back at
dialog: the test results.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Some of the tests need to be done
dialog: again, in my opinion. They haven't
dialog: found anything, it’s not possible.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It’s been less than a day since his
dialog: last tests. I don’t think the
dialog: results will be any different. To
dialog: be honest, I think what we have
dialog: here is a clear case of some
dialog: psychosomatic disorder.
dialog: 52
dialog: 53
dialog: 49,
speaker_heading: HOSPITAL DIRECTOR
dialog: I’m inclined to agree with Anna.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What do you mean? Shouldn’t we rule
dialog: out all possible causes before we
dialog: resort to the easy option of a
dialog: psychosomatic disorder?
speaker_heading: DR. NICHOLS
dialog: We already have ruled out
dialog: everything else.
speaker_heading: HOSPITAL DIRECTOR
dialog: I think with psychiatric treatment
dialog: and psychological support
dialog: everything will be fine. He will
dialog: walk again and eat just fine.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Of course he will.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Anna, if Bob was short-sighted or
dialog: had a cataract or glaucoma, then
dialog: your opinion really would be
text: valuable. But thankfully Bob’s
dialog: eyesight is perfect. And I can
dialog: honestly say that if he ever needed
dialog: glasses, you'd be the first person
dialog: I'd consult. But right now the boy
text: can’t eat and is paralysed in both
dialog: legs, so I’m afraid I’m not
dialog: remotely interested in your medical
dialog: opinion.
text: Nobody says a word. Anna opens the door and leaves the room.
scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

text: They kiss.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: You are the prettiest girl I’ve

speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm afraid I have to go.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Why? Stay a bit longer. We can

speaker_heading: MARTIN

speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Are you mad at me because of my

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Don’t be stupid. I’m not mad at you
dialog: at all. And I thought I’d made
dialog: myself clear - I don’t feel angry
dialog: at him, I feel sorry for him. I
dialog: have to go because it’s late,
dialog: that’s all. It’s as simple as that.
dialog: Don’t be annoying, I thought you
dialog: understood.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I’m sorry. Martin, I love you so
dialog: much.
text: He hugs her but does not say it back.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Anna is marching angrily down the corridor. Steven follows
text: her, holding a file of papers.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I’m sorry about what happened in
dialog: there.
dialog: 55
dialog: 56
dialog: 57
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It doesn’t matter.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I’m just so exhausted and stressed
dialog: and...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: It’s okay.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You go home. I’m staying here.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I’m going to give him all the tests
text: again. Every single one of them.
dialog: I’m staying here. Go home.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Let’s go home and we'll talk it
dialog: over again tomorrow.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Just go. Go to Kim, she’s by
dialog: herself. I’1l come later. Go.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Good night.
text: Anna stands there watching Steven as he goes back towards the

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - MRI SCANNER ROOM - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - ULTRASOUND ROOM - NIGHT
text: Tired but wired, Steven stands next to a doctor who is giving
text: Bob an abdominal ultrasound.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Take a deep breath and hold it for
dialog: a few seconds. Good.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Steven pushes Bob back to his room in the wheelchair. Bob is
text: shattered, so is Steven. Abruptly, Steven stops pushing the
text: wheelchair, lifts Bob up with both hands, puts his arms
text: around him and walks him down the corridor, with the drip
text: trailing behind them. Steven lets go of Bob and he falls to
text: the floor. Steven picks him up again. He kneels down in front
dialog: of his son.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Bob, why don’t we play a game?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What game?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I'll tell you a secret, something
dialog: I’ve never told you before, and
dialog: then you’1ll tell me one. And
dialog: whoever tells the best secret wins.
dialog: Okay? When I was your age I'd just
dialog: started masturbating and I’d only
text: just started ejaculating. Only a
dialog: little, barely a drop. I was
dialog: worried that I had some kind of
dialog: problem because at school I'd heard
dialog: all sorts of stories. Then one day
dialog: when my father had had a lot to
dialog: drink and my brothers were out and
dialog: he was sleeping in the bedroom, I
text: crept inside, put my hand on his
text: penis and started stroking it until
text: he ejaculated. The sheets got
dialog: covered in sperm. I got scared and
dialog: ran out. I’ve never told anybody
dialog: that before. Now it’s your turn to
dialog: tell me a secret.
text: Bob stares at his father, dumbstruck. An awkward silence.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I don’t know. I don’t have one.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: That's impossible, you must have
dialog: one.
dialog: 60
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I don’t.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Bob, if all this is just an act,
dialog: you should know that if you tell me
dialog: now, I won't punish you and neither
dialog: will your mother. We won’t be angry
dialog: with you either.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It’s not an act.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: But if it is an act and you don’t
dialog: stop this stupid joke right this
dialog: minute, your punishment won't just
dialog: be no TV for a month. I will take
dialog: my electric shaver and I will shave
dialog: your head and I will make you eat
dialog: your hair. I mean it, I will
dialog: literally make you eat your hair.
dialog: I’m not kidding.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It’s not an act.
text: Steven puts Bob back into the wheelchair in silence.
scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - HOSPITAL - MORNING
text: Steven is asleep at his desk. His hair is tousled and his tie

text: Anna hands him a takeaway coffee. They don’t say anything.
dialog: Steven has nothing to report.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I brought you a clean shirt.
text: She takes a shirt out of her bag and hangs it up inside the
text: locker where Steven keeps his lab coat.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Anything to tell me?
text: Steven shakes his head.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)

dialog: 61
dialog: 62
dialog: 63
dialog: 64
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: No, thank you. Maybe you were
dialog: right. Maybe it’s all
dialog: psychological.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Everything will be all right,
dialog: you'll see. Trust me. We’re in this
dialog: together and everything will be all
dialog: right. Let’s go and get you
dialog: something to eat and some fresh air
dialog: and then we’ll go up and see the
dialog: little one.

text: Kim is singing in the choir. A middle-aged man, the
text: CHOIRMASTER, is conducting the orchestra. Suddenly, Kim falls

text: silent and the music stops. The choirmaster rushes over to
dialog: see what has happened.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON
text: Anna is sitting outside Bob’s room, crying. Matthew hugs her.
text: A nurse comes out of the room, pushing a food trolley.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT’S ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Kim and Bob are lying in adjacent beds. Steven is feeding Kim
text: pieces of fruit. Kim spits them out. Bob watches them, slowly
text: opening and closing his eyes. He looks as if he has just
text: woken up. Their dinner plates lie untouched on trays.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Dad, I don’t want any fruit.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Just one bite. For me.
text: Kim chokes and her face flushes. She spits out the piece of

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT’S ROOM - EVENING
text: A nurse inserts nasogastric feeding tubes into the noses of

speaker_heading: KIM

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: All right, darling. What are you
dialog: going to wear to Claire’s party,
dialog: did you decide yet?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: No. I’m tired, Dad. Switch off the
text: light.
text: Steven goes to turn the light off. He spots a new MP3 player
text: on the bedside table.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Where did you get this? Did Mum
dialog: give it to you?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: No. Martin did. He made me a
dialog: playlist with some songs that he
dialog: likes. That we both like.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: When did he give you this?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I don’t remember. Good night, Dad.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Good night.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
text: Steven sits in his car, thinking. He opens the car door, gets
text: out, and walks quickly and angrily across the road. He is
text: outside Martin’s house. He sees a light on in the living
text: room. The TV is blaring. Steven goes up to the front door and
text: rings the doorbell frantically. Nobody answers. He bangs on
text: the door with his fists.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Open the door. I know you’re in
dialog: there. Open the door or I will
dialog: smash it down. Martin. Open the
dialog: door or I will smash it down and I
dialog: will fuck you and your mother just
dialog: the way you wanted.
text: Steven tries to break in through the balcony doors, but
dialog: doesn’t succeed.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (CONT'D)
dialog: If anything happens to my kids or

dialog: you hear me? You’ll die in prison.
dialog: 56.
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - NIGHT
text: Anna is sitting on the steps outside the hospital. Steven
text: stands beside her. He appears rather sheepish and speaks in a
text: low voice. He avoids looking Anna in the eye.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: How old was his father when he
dialog: died?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Had you been drinking that day?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: He had an arrhythmia, a stroke, and
dialog: that was it.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I asked whether you’d been
dialog: drinking, not how he died. How long
dialog: has this been going on? How long
dialog: have you been seeing this boy?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: About six months.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Where were you meeting?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What does it matter?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Where were you meeting him?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: At a Burger King, then we'd drive
dialog: to the seaside. He’s got issues,
dialog: serious psychological issues. He
dialog: always did. I knew he acted weird
dialog: sometimes, but now he’s lost it
dialog: completely, he’s become dangerous.
dialog: We have to take precautions. Go to
dialog: the police and take some
dialog: precautions.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You're not going to the police.
dialog: You're not going to tell anyone.
dialog: There’s no point. We’1ll wait and
dialog: see. Had you been drinking when you
dialog: operated on his father?
dialog: 67
dialog: 68
dialog: 69
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Only a little. That had nothing to
dialog: do with the outcome. A surgeon
dialog: never kills a patient. An
dialog: anaesthetist can kill a patient,
dialog: but a surgeon never can. For
dialog: example, Matthew has made mistakes
dialog: that led to the death of a patient,
dialog: but I never have.
text: Anna turns her head away. She doesn’t say anything.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I think Bob is a little better
dialog: today. He seemed in a better mood
dialog: and he wasn’t so pale.
text: Anna does not respond.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Why didn’t you tell me you were
dialog: seeing him?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: At first I didn’t see him that
dialog: often, it was only recently that we
dialog: started meeting more regularly. I
dialog: was going to tell you at some
dialog: point. I felt sorry for him. I gave
text: him some money. His mum is out of
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m going upstairs.
text: Anna gets up and leaves. Steven stands there for a while,
text: alone with his thoughts. Then he follows his wife into the
dialog: hospital.
scene_heading: INT. STEVEN’S HOUSE- BATHROOM - DAY
text: Steven takes a shower.
scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
text: Steven sits on the edge of his bed, naked and numb. His gaze

text: dark. The curtains are drawn. Steven stands up and hurriedly
text: gets dressed.
scene_heading: EXT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - DAY
text: Steven emerges from the front door of his house and finds an

text: opens the envelope.
dialog: 70
dialog: 58.
text: Inside is the watch he had given Martin, with a note. One of
text: the watch straps is missing. Snapped off. Steven looks inside
text: the envelope for the missing piece of leather, but it is not
text: there. The note, written in very neat handwriting, reads:
dialog: “Time shows no mercy. By the way, you were right. Metal
dialog: straps are better. Leather straps break.”
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT’S ROOM - DAY
text: Anna is sitting next to Bob’s bed. Kim is lying on her back
text: on the other bed. She is playing a game on her mobile phone.
text: Her legs are covered from the knees up with a sheet. Her toes
text: are pointed. Exhausted, Anna rests her head on the metal bed
text: frame. She strokes Bob’s legs.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: When are we going home?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Tomorrow or the day after. We’1ll
dialog: get all our tests done and when the
dialog: doctors say so, we can go home.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: But you are doctors too. Tell them
dialog: we can go home.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: We'll tell them, darling.
text: Kim interrupts the conversation.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Mum, did Martin come by while I was

text: Anna stands up and looks at her daughter.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Can you turn me onto my side,
dialog: please?
text: Anna goes over, turns Kim onto her side and returns to her

speaker_heading: KIM (CONT'D)
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Nine.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Is Dad here?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No, he’ll be here soon. Would you

speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: No. Don’t go anywhere. Stay here.
text: Silence. Kim’s phone rings. She picks it up.
speaker_heading: KIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Good morning. How are you? Aren’t
dialog: you coming by? Okay. Just my mum,
dialog: my father will be here soon. Yes.
dialog: You're here? I can’t. Are you
dialog: coming up to see me?
dialog: (Kim laughs)
dialog: You really think that’s possible?
dialog: Well, let’s see. Okay. Okay.
text: Kim’s toes uncurl. Her legs slowly start to move. Kim pulls
text: herself up and sits on the bed. She then stands up and walks
text: over to the window.
speaker_heading: KIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Martin? Yes, I stood up. Yes, thank
dialog: you. Can you see me? Yes, I’m at
text: the window, I’m standing at the
dialog: window. Can you see me?
text: Kim waves with her right hand. Then she smoothes her hair
text: down with both hands.
speaker_heading: KIM (CONT'D)
dialog: I can’t see you, can you see me?
dialog: I’m waving at you. Can you see me
dialog: waving? Great. Yes.
text: Anna gets up and walks over to the window.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Mum, I want to stand up like Kim.
dialog: Why can she get up and I can’t?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: All right. I’m going back to bed
dialog: now. I’m lying down now. Okay.
dialog: Thank you. Me too. Next time you
dialog: come, call me first so that I’m not
dialog: sleeping. I’1l tell them. Me too.
dialog: Bye.
text: As Kim lies down, her legs seize up again and her toes curl
text: back into the soles of her feet. Anna looks out of the
text: window. She scans the people in the street, but she cannot
text: see Martin. Bob falls out of bed.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Mum, I’m coming over to the window.
text: Anna rushes over, picks Bob up, and puts him back into bed.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You'll be able to soon, my darling.
dialog: Kim is older than you, that’s why
dialog: she can do it. Soon you’1l be
text: strong enough to stand up too.
text: Anna turns to look at Kim, who has her back to them and her
text: face pressed up against the window.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Who were you talking to?
speaker_heading: KIM
text: Martin. He sends his regards.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I don’t want you talking with him
dialog: ever again.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Because I said so.
text: Kim does not respond.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you hear what I said?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: Fuck you.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I didn’t say anything.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes you did. What did you say, Kim?
text: Anna grabs her daughter with both hands and shakes her hard.
text: Kim cries out in pain.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Mum, let go, you’re hurting me. I
dialog: didn’t say anything.
text: Anna lets Kim fall abruptly back down on the bed.
dialog: 71
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m not like your father. You
dialog: better watch your mouth. If that’s
dialog: the way you want it, I’m
dialog: confiscating your phone right here
dialog: and now. That’1ll teach you to be
dialog: rude to your mother.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Give me my phone back. Please.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You can forget it.
text: A long beat of silence.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Don’t be scared, mum. Don’t get
dialog: hysterical. It’s not that tragic.
dialog: Sometimes your body hurts from not
dialog: moving and you can’t sleep, that’s
dialog: all. The important thing is to make
dialog: sure you have everything you need
dialog: within reach. That’s all. You’1l
dialog: see. You won’t be able to move
dialog: either, but you'll get used to it.
text: Anna stares at her speechless and her anger morphs into fear.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON
text: Anna is talking to Steven. She is upset. He hugs her and
text: tries to calm her down.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You’re tired. Go home and rest. I’m
dialog: here now.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m not tired. I’m telling you the
dialog: truth, I really saw it happen.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: It was just a coincidence.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: How can it be a coincidence? How
dialog: come neither of them have been able
dialog: to get up and walk until now?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Darling, listen to yourself.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I saw it.
dialog: 72
dialog: 73

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Okay. It just means things are

dialog: Go home and rest for a bit. Please.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: They’re not better. They’re worse.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: This afternoon there’ 11 be an
dialog: emergency meeting of the medical
dialog: board. Andrew and I took the
dialog: initiative of inviting two
dialog: outstanding specialists from the
dialog: Presbyterian University Hospital of
dialog: Columbia. They’ve already arrived
dialog: from New York and I’m meeting them
dialog: this afternoon to brief them about
text: the case. One of them is actually a
dialog: personal friend of the director.
dialog: Dr. Johnston. You must have heard
dialog: of him. He’s the best there is when
dialog: it comes to paralytic disorders.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: EXT. ANNA’S CAR — AFTERNOON
text: Anna is driving. We can sense that contradicting thoughts are
text: going through her mind.
scene_heading: EXT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
text: Anna pulls over outside Martin’s house. She looks at the
text: house, trying to figure out whether anyone is home. She takes
text: a deep breath and gets out of the car. She hesitates for a
text: moment, looks around, then carries on walking up to the front
text: door of Martin’s house.
scene_heading: EXT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
text: Martin opens the front door. He is home alone. He is wearing
text: a T-shirt and boxer shorts and holding a plate of spaghetti.
text: His hair is wet and freshly combed.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Good evening. I’m not sure if you
dialog: remember me.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Of course I remember you. How are
dialog: you? Come in.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: 75 INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Anna sits on the sofa. Martin brings her a glass of iced
dialog: water.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thank you very much. I'd like to
dialog: have a talk with you. I won’t take
dialog: up much of your time.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Of course. I’ve only got ten
dialog: minutes because I have to get to my
dialog: French class. What’s up?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: My husband told me about you and
dialog: your father.
text: Martin puts his plate of spaghetti down on the table. He
text: looks at Anna and smiles faintly.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Did he also tell you about my mum?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I’m sorry, then maybe I’m not the
dialog: one you should hear it from. Ever
dialog: since your husband killed my
dialog: father, he’s been flirting with my
dialog: mother constantly. To be honest,
dialog: she has feelings for him too. She
dialog: really likes your husband's hands
dialog: and the truth is he does have very
dialog: beautiful hands. All doctors have
dialog: nice, clean hands. You see, now
dialog: that we only have each other, my
dialog: mother and I are friends and we
dialog: tell each other everything. So I
dialog: told her that I have no problem if
dialog: she wants to go ahead with it, and
dialog: anyway, he seems like a nice guy.
dialog: Why would I stand in the way of her
text: trying to get her life back on
dialog: track? I mean, I'll be gone ina
dialog: few years. I’1l get a job and I'll
dialog: be gone.
dialog: 76
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Look, if my husband made a mistake,
dialog: if out of negligence or I don’t
dialog: know what he somehow caused this
dialog: tragic thing to happen, I don’t
dialog: understand why my children and I
dialog: have to pay the price.
text: Martin picks up his plate of spaghetti.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Not long after my dad died, someone
dialog: told me that I eat spaghetti in
dialog: exactly the same way he did, told
dialog: me what an extraordinary impression
dialog: this fact had made on him. “Look
text: how the boy eats spaghetti,” he
dialog: said. “Exactly the same way his
text: father did. He sticks his fork in
text: and twirls it around and around
dialog: until the spaghetti is all twisted
text: up and then he puts it in his
dialog: mouth.” At the time, I thought I
dialog: was the only one who ate spaghetti
dialog: like that. Only my dad and me. I
dialog: realised later, of course, that
text: everyone eats spaghetti that way.
text: They all stick their fork in and
text: twirl it around.
text: Martin stands up.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: I was really upset when I realised
dialog: that, maybe even more upset than
dialog: when they announced to me that he
dialog: was dead. I don’t know if what is
dialog: happening is fair, but it’s the
dialog: closest thing to justice I can
dialog: think of. But enough chit chat,
dialog: time's getting on and if I’m late
dialog: for class I’m done for. You have a
dialog: good day.

speaker_heading: HOSPITAL DIRECTOR
dialog: So, I don’t see any reason for the

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You mean you think you’ve done
dialog: everything you can?
speaker_heading: HOSPITAL DIRECTOR
dialog: Yes, Steven, I believe we have done
dialog: everything we can.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Sorry, but if I was running this

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Good evening, Matthew. Sorry to

speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: It’s no bother, really.
speaker_heading: ANNA

dialog: meeting like this.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: He won’t. I’m listening.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Four years ago, you were operating

speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Were you the anaesthetist for

text: Male, 46 years old, one of Steven's

speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Anna, there have been so many
dialog: patients over the years, so many
dialog: operations. I don’t remember him,
dialog: I’m afraid. I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Can you find his file in the
dialog: records and bring it to me, please?
dialog: I'll give it straight back to you.
dialog: I just want to have a look at his
dialog: medical history. And the cause of
dialog: death.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: I don’t think that will be
dialog: possible. I’m sorry, Anna. I can’t
dialog: just take a file from the hospital.
dialog: Why do you need it?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Look, I can’t bring you the file
dialog: but I can tell you a couple of
dialog: things about the case. I remember
dialog: him now, I put him under. But what
dialog: do I get in return?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What you didn’t get that day we
dialog: came for lunch.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Now. Had Steven been drinking?
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Can it be considered his mistake?
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Yes. It definitely wasn’t mine,
dialog: that’s for sure. You know an
dialog: anaesthetist is never to blame for
text: the bad outcome of an operation.
dialog: The surgeon is responsible. He’d
dialog: had two drinks that morning before
dialog: we went in to prepare. Luckily none
dialog: of the others realised, I was the
dialog: only one who knew. But that wasn’t
dialog: exactly unusual back then.

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Do you remember Lang’s case

text: Matthew leans forward in his chair again and rests his arms
text: on the table.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERTED ROAD - MORNING
text: Matthew’s car is parked on a deserted road on the edge of
text: town. There are no pedestrians and very few cars. Anna stares
text: straight ahead as she jerks off the anaesthetist. He pushes
text: his seat back to the reclining position. As soon as he comes,
text: he pulls the chair forward, starts the engine, and they drive
dialog: off.
scene_heading: EXT. STEVEN’S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - AFTERNOON
text: The front door is open. The children are being carried into

text: fairly optimistic as he manically rushes about, supervising
dialog: the procedure.
scene_heading: INT. KIM’'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Kim's bedroom has been rearranged to accommodate both the

scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Steven and Anna are having dinner. He is the only one eating.
text: Anna toys with the wedges of potato on her plate with her
text: fork. Steven watches her intently, trying to get a reaction,
text: but she remains stubbornly silent. Steven fills Anna’s glass
text: with wine. She does not say thank you.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: This meat is delicious.
text: His wife does not respond.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You were right after all. The
dialog: children are much better off here.
dialog: I was even thinking we might take
dialog: them to the beach house for a few
dialog: days. A little fresh air anda
dialog: change of scenery might do us all
dialog: good.

text: Anna looks up and stares at her husband, as if she were
text: observing him for the first time.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: One of these days you’re going to
dialog: have to go in to their school and
dialog: excuse their absence. They want you
dialog: to sign some papers. They've called
dialog: lots of times.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I will. You know what I’ve been
dialog: craving? Mashed potatoes. Why don’t
dialog: you make some tomorrow?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You've got beautiful hands. I'd
dialog: never noticed before. Everyone's
dialog: been telling me lately what
dialog: beautiful hands you have and now I
dialog: can see it for myself. Nice and
dialog: clean. But so what if they’re
dialog: beautiful? They’re lifeless.
dialog: Sometimes, Steven, you’re just an
text: incompetent man with hands that
dialog: don’t move who just goes on and on,
dialog: saying stupid things. “Let’s do a
dialog: scan, let’s do a gastroscopy, let’s
dialog: make mashed potatoes, let’s wear
dialog: brown socks, let’s go to the beach
dialog: house.”
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Our two children are dying in their
dialog: beds but yes, I can make you mashed
dialog: potatoes tomorrow.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Please don’t talk to me that way.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: If you don’t like it why don’t you
dialog: go and live with Martin’s mother, I
dialog: bet she’d talk to you nicer.
text: Steven does not take the bait.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You wanted the kids to come home

dialog: want me to do?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Do something to put an end to all
dialog: this, that’s what.
speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s what I want. Can you do
dialog: that? You do realise Steven that
dialog: we've ended up in this situation
dialog: because of you?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: So what do you suggest? Tell me.
dialog: Oh, wait, I know, I’ve got it.
dialog: There is a way that we can put a
dialog: stop to all this. All we need to do
text: is find the tooth of a baby
text: crocodile, the blood of a pigeon,
text: and the pubes of a virgin and then
dialog: we just have to burn them all
dialog: before sunset. Let me see, do we
dialog: have any spare teeth lying around?
text: Steven starts opening cupboards and flinging packets of food
text: onto the floor.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Teeth, pubes, nope, nothing in
dialog: here, or here. Nothing in this box
dialog: either. Where are they? I was sure
dialog: they were here somewhere. I put
dialog: them here myself. Who keeps moving
dialog: things around? Unbelievable. I
dialog: don’t supposed you’ve got any pubes
dialog: I could have, by any chance? Oh I
dialog: forgot, you don’t have any left. We
dialog: don’t have any of the things we
dialog: need. Well, that’s a shame. I guess
dialog: there’s nothing I can do.

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: There’s no need for us to argue.
dialog: Everything's so difficult already,

text: Anna does not respond. She lies down on the bed without
text: covering herself up and turns her back to Steven.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (CONT'D)
dialog: If he was telling the truth,
dialog: wouldn't you be sick too? Wouldn't
dialog: you be paralysed already? How do

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes, you're right. Let’s wait a bit

text: A short, awkward beat of silence.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: STEVEN

scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Steven is standing in the middle of the room, smoking. He is
text: alone. He sits in an armchair. After a few moments, he stands
text: up again. Taking care not to make any noise, he picks up his
text: car keys and coat and quietly shuts the door.
scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM — MORNING
text: Anna is lying in bed with her eyes open. Steven enters the

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: ANNA

speaker_heading: STEVEN

scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - MORNING
text: Steven and Anna head down to the basement. Steven unlocks the
text: door. They enter a fairly large room full of random garden
text: furniture. It is dark and dirty. The light goes on - a small
text: bulb that faintly illuminates the space - and we see Martin
text: huddled in a corner. He is sitting in an old armchair. His
text: feet are bound together with gaffer tape and he is chained to
text: a pipe in the corner of the room. His hands are tied in front
text: of him. Martin’s face is bloodied and swollen. There is a
text: rifle on the table.
text: Anna looks at Martin and then walks over to the table. She
text: turns to face Steven.
text: Anna does not move. She looks at Martin. Martin looks up and
text: holds her gaze. It’s hard to tell whether he is angry or
text: afraid. He raises his hand and wipes some blood off the side
text: of his mouth.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You remember Martin, don’t you? He
dialog: came over for a play date, but I
dialog: told him the kids are feeling a
dialog: little unwell, so he’ll just have
dialog: to wait here until they get better.
dialog: Anna, go upstairs and make me some
dialog: of that lemonade he likes so much,
dialog: would you? I’ll stay here and keep
dialog: him company. Off you go.
text: Anna hesitates and then leaves. She closes the basement door
text: behind her. We hear her footsteps on the stairs.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Let me go. My mother will be
text: worried sick.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Do you think your mother is proud
dialog: of you, Martin? Do you think she is
text: happy that her beloved son is a
dialog: murderer?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Murderer. There’s no need for such
dialog: a dramatic, sensational, old-
dialog: fashioned word. But if you insist,
dialog: the murderer, both in my father’s
dialog: case and our current situation, is
dialog: not me.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Stop talking.
dialog: 88
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Don’t you understand that you’re
dialog: wasting time? You don’t have much
dialog: time left.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I said stop talking.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Steven, you’ll feel better once
dialog: it’s done. You can start over, a
dialog: clean slate, don’t you get it?
dialog: Sometimes I think you might just be
dialog: a fool who can’t understand the
dialog: significance of the gift I am
dialog: offering. Sometimes I think you’re
dialog: naive. But you can’t be. You’re a
dialog: good scientist, you can’t be an
dialog: idiot. If I’d only just met you I’d
dialog: seriously question the depth of
dialog: your judgement.
text: Steven strikes the boy across the face. Martin grabs his hand
text: and holds it tight.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t move. I just want to give you
dialog: an example, that’s all. I’1l give
dialog: you one little example so that you
dialog: understand what I mean.
text: Martin bites Steven’s arm. Blood trickles down his hand.
text: Steven screams.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Should I apologise? No. Should I
dialog: stroke your wound? No way. That
dialog: would probably hurt even more,
dialog: touching an open wound. No. There’s
dialog: only one way to make you and me
dialog: both feel better.
text: Martin bites his own arm and spits out a small piece of
text: flesh. His face is contorted with pain but he doesn’t scream.
text: He tries to remain composed.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you understand? It’s
dialog: metaphorical, my example. A
dialog: metaphor. I mean, it’s symbolic.
scene_heading: EXT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - GARDEN - MORNING
text: Anna is scrubbing the blood from the back seat of Steven's
text: car. The dog watches her but she doesn’t pay him any
text: attention. We hear a muffled gunshot. The dog starts to bark.

dialog: 74.
scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - MORNING
text: Anna opens the door. Steven has shot Martin in the leg. He is
text: still holding the gun and pointing it at Martin. The boy
text: writhes in agony.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Shut the door, Anna. Now Martin,
dialog: you'll see what it’s like to die.
dialog: What it’s like when your head
dialog: cracks open and your brains are
text: blown out.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Steven, don’t shoot him.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: And then?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Shoot me. Then what? Answer me.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I‘1l bury you in the garden and
dialog: you'll decompose. That’s what.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: You won’t be able to explain it.
dialog: You won’t understand how it could
dialog: have happened. You’ll say - “But I
dialog: only killed one person, how come
dialog: four people are dead? I only shot
dialog: one.” You’ll get confused and
dialog: you'll start counting again: one,
dialog: two, three. But the numbers still
dialog: won't add up. If you dig a hole in
dialog: the garden, better make it a big
dialog: one.
text: Steven walks over to Martin and puts the gun to his head.
text: Anna walks up behind Steven and tries to take the gun out of
text: his hands.
text: At first Steven doesn’t let go, but Anna whispers something
text: in his ear and he releases the gun. Anna calmly takes the gun
text: and walks out of the room.

speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: He didn’t kill him.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I just do. Anyway, he did the right

dialog: tragic? I’m going to live with
dialog: Martin.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: KIM (CONT'D)
dialog: I want you to know that I’m really
dialog: sorry, Bob. I really love you. We

dialog: doesn’t have much of a choice. It’s
dialog: not because he doesn’t love you.

dialog: They've bought me a piano. Mum told

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Thank you very much. They’re

speaker_heading: HEADMASTER (CONT'D)
dialog: However, do bear in mind that in

dialog: Attending even some of their

dialog: course, it’s ultimately your

text: which she read out in class. At.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What about their behaviour in

speaker_heading: HEADMASTER
dialog: They're both a little restless,

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
text: She’s gone.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Where is she? What did you do to
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I didn’t touch her. I don’t know
text: where she is.
text: Steven runs out of the room.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
text: Anna is driving very slowly along the road. Steven walks in
text: front of the car. The high beam headlights illuminate the
text: road. They scan the street for any sign of Kim. Steven is
text: anxious, out of breath. He glistens with sweat. They find Kim
text: dragging herself along the pavement. She tries to cross the
text: road. Her hands and knees are covered with blood.
scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

dialog: instruments.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I’m sorry for what I did tonight. I
dialog: don’t know what came over me, I
dialog: don’t know what I was thinking. I
dialog: was only thinking about myself,
dialog: noone else. That was wrong of me. I
dialog: was frightened. Terrified. I
dialog: shouldn’t have been. Let me be the
dialog: one who atones for your sins, Dad.
dialog: Kill me right here, in front of
dialog: your eyes so you can be sure that I
dialog: die, in case some fate spares me at
dialog: the last moment. Kill me right here
dialog: in front of you and give me the
dialog: ultimate joy of saving my own
dialog: mother and my beloved brother from
dialog: certain death.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: KIM (CONT'D)
dialog: A joy that may take the form of
dialog: death but has none of death’s
dialog: bitterness, of its chill or
dialog: darkness. Please Dad, take these
dialog: scissors and do me the honour. Mum,
dialog: tell him. Dad, please. I would do
dialog: anything for you, I would even die
dialog: for you. And I’m ready to prove it.
dialog: You gave me life and you, only you
dialog: have the right to take my life
dialog: away. That makes perfect sense. You
dialog: are my lords, my masters and I am
dialog: just someone who lives to obey your
dialog: wishes. I love you so much, don’t
dialog: forget that. Remember that when I’m
dialog: in my grave, unable to tell you
dialog: that I love you. I love you more
dialog: than anything in the world, you and
dialog: my brother.
text: Steven finishes dressing his daughter’s wounds. He kisses her

text: taking the bloodied gauzes and cotton wool with her.
scene_heading: 106 INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN —- MORNING
text: Anna is sitting in a chair. In front of her is a glass of

text: table. Classical music plays from a radio on the kitchen
text: counter. Steven walks into the room.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Where have you been?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I went to the hospital. I got the
dialog: feeding formula. Have you checked
dialog: on him? Did you give him the
dialog: sedatives?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I let him go.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: ANNA
text: He’s not downstairs. I let him go.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Why would you do that?
text: He hits Anna around the head.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Why did you let him go? Tell me.
dialog: Are you a complete idiot?
dialog: 107
dialog: 84.
text: Anna walks away. The dog follows her. She stops and turns to
dialog: face Steven.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It wouldn’t have made any
dialog: difference, Steven. It wasn’t going
dialog: to solve anything. We both know
dialog: that.

text: mother has taught her to say when she answers the phone at
dialog: the clinic.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Please describe your symptoms. I
dialog: see. Would you be so kind as to
dialog: hold the line while I check the
dialog: doctor's availability? Yes, sorry
dialog: to keep you waiting. The earliest
dialog: the doctor can see you is next
dialog: Thursday. Are mornings or evenings
dialog: more convenient for you? Mornings
dialog: are better, I see. Next Thursday at
dialog: eleven then. We’ll be expecting
dialog: you. Good day. (Pause). Anna Murphy

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Kim, I’m trying to rest. Can you
dialog: please be quiet?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Mum, do you remember when I was
dialog: rude to you at the hospital that
dialog: day?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Did you tell Dad about it?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Of course I told him, Kim.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I didn’t mean it, Mum. Maybe it was
dialog: a side effect of the drugs or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Kim, please. I’m trying to rest.

scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM — MORNING
text: Anna is asleep. Steven is sitting on the edge of the bed. He
text: stares at the wardrobe for a long time. Then he gets up and
text: goes over to his wife. He stands over her. He looks at her.
text: His gaze is fixed on her. Wondering whether he should kill
dialog: her or not, whether she should give her life to save the
text: children or not. He takes a step backwards. He looks at her
text: for a few more moments.
scene_heading: INT. STEVEN’S HOUSE - CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Bob is listening to music on his MP3 player. His eyes start
text: to bleed. Blood trickles down onto the pillow. Bob wipes the

text: cannot see her.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Dad, quick! Bob’s dying.
scene_heading: INT. STEVEN’S HOUSE - CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Bob is lying on his bed. Steven wipes the blood from his face

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Dad, who’s your best friend?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I don’t know, Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Is it Matthew?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yes, Matthew is a very good friend
dialog: of mine.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I have three. Two boys and a girl
dialog: from my class.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: That’s great, Bob. It’s good to
dialog: have lots of friends.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I think Mum considers Matthew a
dialog: very good friend too.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yes, that’s right.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: He used to call Mum a lot. Once he
dialog: called the house and I picked up
dialog: and he said: “I'd like to speak to
dialog: Anna, please.” I recognised his
dialog: voice, but I didn’t say: “Hi,
dialog: Matthew”. I just said: “She’s not
dialog: here right now, can I take a
dialog: message?” He came over to the house
dialog: one time too when you and Kim were
dialog: out, so I guess you wouldn’t
dialog: remember.
scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - KIM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Steven undresses Kim. He then dresses her up in the outfit
text: she had chosen to wear to Claire’s party. Lying in bed,

text: wheelchair, watching them.
scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Steven enters the bedroom. Anna is frantically making their
text: bed. She doesn’t seem to notice him. Steven approaches Anna

scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Kim is sitting in a chair in a corner of the room. Anna is
text: standing by the wall, near the French windows. Bob is on the
text: sofa. He can barely sit up. They all look terrified. Their
text: feet are tied with rope and their mouths are taped.
text: Steven is standing in the middle of the room. He looks at
text: each of them in turn. They form a triangle around him. He
text: puts on a black balaclava that covers his entire face, so
text: that he can’t see anything. He raises the rifle.
text: Steven starts spinning round on the spot. He fires a shot. He
text: stops. Silence. The other three are trying to not make a
text: sound. They struggle to stifle their instinctive reactions.
text: He hasn’t hit anyone. The bullet has lodged itself ina
text: cabinet full of crystal tableware.
text: Steven starts spinning around again. He fires another shot.
text: Anna screams. Steven pulls off the balaclava. He sees Bob,
text: hit in the chest. Motionless. Blood is splattered across the
text: couch. Kim stares, frozen. Steven puts down his rifle.
scene_heading: INT. BURGER KING - DAY
text: Steven is sitting in a Burger King with Anna and Kim. Martin
text: walks in, limping from the bullet wound. He stares at them as
text: he walks past and sits at a table nearby. Steven and Anna
text: watch Martin out of the corner of their eye. They both look
text: haggard. Kim puts ketchup on her chips and starts wolfing
text: them down. She looks healthy. Her parents watch her eat. When
text: Kim has finished eating her chips, they put on their jackets
text: and go to leave. Kim stands up, takes a quick look at Martin
text: and then follows her parents. She is walking normally.
