scene_heading: INT. LECTURE HALL BERKELEY - DAY
text: The hall is full. On the stage, DR. HELEN HUDSON is
text: speaking. HELEN is a forensic psychologist. Behind her is
scene_heading: a projected diagram: PREDISPOSITION, DISSOCIATION, TRAUMA,
scene_heading: FANTASY, VIOLENT FANTASY, FACILITATORS, MURDER, and
text: TRAUMA-REINFORCEMENT which she can point to with a laser
text: pointing device. We see her from a considerable
text: distance... the back of the balcony. Her voice is crisp and
dialog: assured.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Our society creates these socially
text: and psychically disenfranchised
dialog: men, and their revenge on society
dialog: is terrible. They are hard to
dialog: catch. They are "the nice guy next
dialog: door," their employers -- if they
dialog: work at all -- find them quiet and
text: uncomplaining. Early abuse and
dialog: rejection have taught them
dialog: passivity. Only in their violent
dialog: fantasies do they feel alive. What
text: they seek in their frenzied
dialog: assaults on their victims is relief
dialog: from passivity. For these men, ten
dialog: minutes relief is worth far more
dialog: than the life of another human
dialog: being. Torture, the pain they
text: inflict, the screams of the victim,
dialog: are all part of the ritual that
text: gives them a brief respite from
dialog: their own psychic pain. And then
dialog: the depression, the forgetting, the
text: feeling of sadness and despair
text: begins the cycle all over again.
dialog: Like addicts seeking their drug,
dialog: Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono,
dialog: Berkowitz, Dahmer, Bundy -- they
dialog: seek out their next victim.
text: During the second half of this speech, the eye of the camera
text: has moved slowly forward until it settles just behind the
text: balcony railing.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP: HELEN
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: The cycle is endless until they are
text: caught. And they are caught by
text: chance -- they run a red light, and
text: a body is in the trunk. A leaking
text: pipe brings a plumber to a basement
text: where they is the smell of death.
text: Her eyes have come to rest on the spot of the camera eye in
text: the balcony... Her voice chokes off. She stares.
speaker_heading: HELEN'S POV:
text: Sitting in the front row of the balcony, a YOUNG RED-HEADED
text: MAN (DARYLL LEE CULLUM) leans forward, resting his tattooed
text: arms on the railing. He smiles intimately at HELEN.
text: HELEN cuts her eyes to the left. She sees:
text: Backstage, an overweight COP in plain clothes. Instantly
text: alert to HELEN'S alarm, he jumps up, comes within an inch of
text: exposing his presence to the audience. A SECOND COP, in the
text: wings on the other side of the stage, also springs to
text: attention. FIRST COP'S eyes follow HELEN'S...
text: Their POV: THE BALCONY - YOUNG RED-HEADED MAN is no longer
dialog: there.
text: HELEN Can she believe her eyes? Resumes:
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: At any time, right now, as you
dialog: listen, the FBI estimates there are
dialog: 30 to 35 serial killers stalking
text: their victims. The serial killer is
dialog: a plaque that must be addressed not
dialog: only by the law, but by science.
dialog: Florida spent eight million dollars
dialog: to execute Ted Bundy. It would
dialog: have been better spent building a
dialog: forensic penal facility devoted to
dialog: research.
text: Once again her eyes fix on the balcony to reassure herself
dialog: that the smiling man is not there...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Confined for life, without parole,
dialog: and subjected to scientific study,
dialog: these men's lives might finally, in
dialog: some small measure, educate and
dialog: thereby protect society. Thank
dialog: you.
text: Applause as Helen warily checks for the TWO COPS. They are
text: carefully casing the crowd.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: LATER:
text: The crowd is breaking up. FIRST COP walks HELEN to the
text: ladies' room. People reach to shake Helen's hand; she copes
text: as well as she can with her fear. THEY LEAVE THE STAGE
text: THROUGH A DOOR OPENING TO A CORRIDOR LEADING BACK TO
text: DRESSING ROOMS AND A LADIES' ROOM...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LADIES' ROOM - DAY
text: THE COP, clearly embarrassed, pokes his head in and looks
text: around. Under one stall he sees a woman's HIGH HEELS. He
text: hastily ducks back into HALL and signals an okay to Helen.
text: Before the door behind her closes, we see the COP prepare to
text: stand guard outside. HELEN walks past the stall with the
text: high heels to a stall several doors down.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP HIGH HEELS:
text: And a tattoo that the cop missed seeing on one of the
text: ankles. The shoes are kicked off. The feet disappear from
dialog: view as
text: HELEN, a few stalls away, methodically places toilet paper
text: around the seat before raising her skirt. A faint noise
text: makes her freeze. Her hand reaches for the door. She is
text: just able to unlock it, but no more, before a NOISE COMES
text: DOWN FROM THE NEXT STALL.
text: Like a lariat it falls over HELEN'S head and is violently
text: yanked tight. She kicks at the stall door.
text: CORRIDOR: COP, leaning against outside door smoking, hears
text: the clang of metal as the stall door bangs open. He
dialog: reacts...
scene_heading: INT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUED
text: The RED-HEADED MAN is struggling to secure the rope around a
text: hook inside his own stall. KNOCKING (o.s.)
speaker_heading: COP (o.s.)
dialog: Doctor Hudson? Are you okay in
dialog: there?
text: The MAN lets slip a little slack.
text: HELEN'S fingers, thrusting between the rope and her neck,
text: get just enough air for HELEN to let out a strangled little
dialog: scream.
text: CORRIDOR: COP, not certain what to do about the ambiguous
text: sounds from inside. Women stands nearby, inhibiting him for
text: a split second from going in the Ladies' Room door. Now
text: there is more SOUND from inside...
scene_heading: INT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: COP steps into the room, gun down. Over the COP'S shoulder
text: we see HELEN hanging in open booth, her hand fluttering at
text: her throat. She has one slippery shoeless foot on the
dialog: toilet seat.
text: COP takes a couple of steps forward. Behind COP'S back we
text: see a broom closet door opening.
text: HELEN'S POV: CLOSE UP: The COP, taken from behind. In a
text: second, his throat is slit. In a gush of blood, he falls,
text: his gun still in his hand.
text: RED-HEADED MAN standing over the fallen COP, smiling at
speaker_heading: HELEN.
text: COP'S BODY IS TWITCHING, JERKING. The violent contractions
text: in his fingers cause the gun to go off... ONE... TWO SHOTS,
text: the sound reverberating against the tile walls.
speaker_heading: STAGE AREA
text: The audience and SECOND COP react to the gunshots.
text: HELEN, her eyes bulging, struggling against the rope.
speaker_heading: SLAM CUT:
scene_heading: INT. HELEN'S APT - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT
text: As HELEN, in bed, bolts up from the nightmare, her hands try
text: desperately to pull the dream rope from her neck. She is now
text: pale, her hair is dirty, there are deep circles under her
text: eyes. This is a woman in the throes of a breakdown.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Andy! Andy!
text: She races through this LOFT APARTMENT (THE WALLS ARE EIGHT
text: FEET UNDER A TWELVE-FOOT CEILING) to study opening off a
text: hall. She looks in, gasping for breathing...
scene_heading: INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: The room is neat -- nobody there. (We will later see that it
text: is used on and off by her computer, Andy.)
text: HELEN whimpers in frustration; she is alone. SHE TALKS TO
text: HERSELF as she turns back and moves past a LIVING ROOM,
text: where she turns on lights and the TV flicks on, (COURT TV.)
text: The sound comes up, loud... She moves on... trying to calm
text: herself with the sound of her own voice...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: It is October twelfth, 1994 in the
dialog: city of San Francisco, California,
dialog: U.S.A., the strongest, richest,
dialog: most stable and happiest country in
dialog: the world. That is the sole place
dialog: of life in the universe. Under
dialog: God.
text: CLOSE: XANAX BOTTLE. Two pills are shaken out into a palm,
text: others scattering from the nervous haste...
text: CLOSE: HELEN Watching herself in BATHROOM mirror as she
text: tosses down the pills, gulps water. She regards her haggard
dialog: reflection with a certain detachment...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Good God. What happened to you?
text: She barks a rueful laugh... we are seeing a woman will
text: herself from near-hysteria to relative calm...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: HALL As she exits the bathroom. And moves into her OFFICE.
text: She pours herself a brandy and stands before two computers.
text: Of the side-by-side computer screens, one is blank. The
text: other shows a chess setup. Flashing on the bottom of the
text: screen comes a command.
speaker_heading: CHESSMASTER
dialog: 'It's almost seven. Make a goddam
dialog: move.'
text: She studies the chess set-up for a moment, then makes a
text: move. She has not even hit the Keyboard of the other
text: computer before CHESSMASTER sends another message.
speaker_heading: CHESSMASTER
dialog: 'Lousy move. Not really into this
dialog: game, Helen. Let's drop it. I've
dialog: got a feeling about you. Let's
dialog: meet. Like a date.'
text: HELEN types the following to CHESSMASTER.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: 'I'm a terrible date. I'd mess up your
dialog: life.'
speaker_heading: CHESSMASTER
dialog: 'Another romantic dream gone all to
dialog: hell.'
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: 'Maybe it's better to just dream
dialog: on; avoid the disappointments of
dialog: life. Come on, move.'
text: She pushes a button on the remote, and we see the window
text: curtains open. BRIGHT SUNLIGHT STREAMS IN! We see that the
text: T-shirt HELEN wears says "Shrinks 'R' Us." She crosses to
text: the window with her glass of cognac, looks out.
speaker_heading: VIEW:
text: A sweeping view of the bay, and across to Marin County. The
text: morning sun is dispelling the last of the night's fog.
text: HELEN opens window, puts a hand outside, trying to feel the
text: air, the freedom. Feeling quite restored from the dream
dialog: horror of the night...
scene_heading: O.S., THE PHONE RINGS. HELEN. A FRISSON.
text: CLOSE: PHONE Her hand comes into FRAME and picks up the
text: handset and carries CAMERA TO CLOSEUP HELEN.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: Yes?
dialog: (listens)
dialog: You son-of-a-bitch! Son of
dialog: a bitch...
text: Stiff with fear and rage, she slams down phone.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You filthy... son of a bitch!
text: On the computer screen behind her the Chessmaster makes his
text: move: the computer speaks in its tiny computer voice:
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: (filter)
dialog: You Queen is in check.
dialog: Protect your Queen.
speaker_heading: OVER CREDITS:
text: HOME MOVIE of a young woman dressed in a seat suit. It is
text: morning, and she is jogging on a park path. Her hair is in
text: a long braid. She is sweating, breathing heavily, clearly
text: near the end of a satisfactory run.
text: THE FILM REVERSES, THE FILM STARTS UP AGAIN IN EXTREMELY
text: SLOW MOTION. WE ARE NOW AWARE THERE IS ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW
text: AT WORK HERE.
text: NOW THE FRAME FREEZES AT A POINT WHERE IT MAKES THE JOGGER'S

scene_heading: INT. RIFLE RANGE - DAY
scene_heading: MUZZLE OF SEMI AUTOMATIC PISTOL BLASTS NINE SHOTS ALMOST
text: DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA. A BEAT OF SILENCE...
text: THE TARGET: it is a silhouette of a man's head and torso;
text: centered in the right side of the upper chest, near the
text: shoulder, is a small red circle. Still SMOKING, THE HOLES
text: FROM THE BULLETS are scattered all over the chest, and none
text: in the circle.
speaker_heading: M.J. (V.O.)
dialog: My third grade teacher at the
dialog: convent shot better than that.
scene_heading: THE SHOOTER, RUBEN GOETZ, AND PARTNER M.J.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
text: We now take in the shooter, RUBEN, and his companion M.J.
text: HALLORAN. M.J. is a small, deceptively vulnerable looking
text: young woman. She is neat, buttoned down, crisp. M.J.
text: appears to be about twenty-five. She is, in fact,
text: thirty-four and a homicide inspector with the rank of
text: sergeant. She is usually dressed in slacks and a loose
text: sweater or an oversize jacket that helps make her appear
text: even smaller and younger than she is.
text: RUBEN GOETZ is also in homicide, about twenty-six and junior
text: in authority to M.J. RUBEN is good-looking, good-humored
text: and laid back. He has a cellular phone attached to his
dialog: belt.
text: M.J. PULLS THE LINE THAT DOLLIES THE TARGET BACK TO THEM,
text: AND RUBEN REPLACES IT WITH ANOTHER AS THEY TALK.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: I'd feel a whole lot safer with
dialog: Sister Loretta for my backup. Look
dialog: at this guy: you shredded him!
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: Well, he's dead, he can't hurt me
dialog: now.
text: The target is rigged; they pull the line that dollies it back
text: to shooting position.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: It's sloppy shooting. It's in
text: character, Ruben, but unnecessary.
dialog: And bad for your career.
text: RUBEN LETS OFF THREE QUICK SHOTS: they cluster nearer the
text: circle. M.J. looks at him in surprise.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: I've been practicing. Now can I
dialog: kiss your tummy?
text: M.J. hides her smile as she prepares her weapon for her turn.
dialog: M.J.
text: Perp's holding a hostage, the
text: shoulder on his gun hand is gonna
dialog: be exposed.
text: SOUND: A CELLULAR PHONE (ON RUBENS' BELT). M.J. holds her
dialog: fire.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Answer it.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: I'm sure she thinks it is. Aren't
dialog: you at least interested in which
dialog: one it is?
text: She's lost her concentration lowered the gun; now as he
text: answers, she raises her gun and aims...
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I'm here, where are you?...
dialog: Heeeeyyy! What a surprise! No. On
dialog: duty, have to call you back... You,
dialog: too, you too. My God, you made my
dialog: day.
text: He hits the "end" button...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: You hit the brachial nerve...
text: SHE FIRES! The shots make a perfect heart around the circle,
text: inside his looser pattern. ONE FINAL SHOT STRIKES EXACTLY
dialog: IN THE MIDDLE!
dialog: M.J.
dialog: You're good enough you'll never
dialog: have to kill anyone. I joined the
dialog: cops to save lives, not waste them.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: You know, M.J., when I watch you
dialog: shoot, I realize I've got a little
dialog: problem with my stance... could you
dialog: just move over here and critique my
dialog: legs?
text: He slaps his thigh where he indicates the trouble might be.
text: She is unloading her weapon...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: The problem is between your legs.
dialog: You told your shrink about that?
text: She is unloading and cleaning up. Ruben doing the same...
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: I tell my shrink about you,
dialog: Sergeant. I tell him you're the
dialog: top cop of my dreams.
text: Ruben has been gathering up his box of doughnuts, from which
text: he has nibbled during the preceding... he drops them, picks
text: one up off the floor and sticks it in his mouth...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: (putting away her
dialog: gear)
dialog: Don't take that mess in the car.
text: They're on the move; as they go away from us...
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: He's in love with you already...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY
text: They pull up in front of an apartment building in the
text: Pacific Heights section. Patrol cars flank the street, the
text: thick yellow ticker tape "POLICE CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS"
text: is already up. M.J. double parks beside a blue-and-white.
text: A couple of cars from the media are already there. SUSAN
text: SCHIFFER a bulldog of a woman, and her camera crew, waylay
text: M.J. and Ruben as they cross the sidewalk...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Oh, Christ, the Mouth is already
dialog: here.
text: She is, with a cameraman with a haircut and smile that speak
text: of a life of orthodontics and dreams of TV anchorship.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: Hey. And there's the Haircut right
text: behind. If she stops short he's
dialog: gonna be there feet up her ass...
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (on camera)
dialog: Inspector, can you...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: I just got here myself, Susan.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: ...confirm this third murder adds
dialog: up to a pattern? Do we have a
dialog: serial killer on the loose in the
dialog: city?
dialog: M.J.
dialog: I just got here. Talk to you
dialog: later...
dialog: M.J.
text: (as they escape behind the
dialog: barrier tape)
dialog: What the hell does she want to do,
dialog: scare everybody to death?
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: That's her job... Jesus, Quinn is
dialog: here already.
text: QUINN, a splenetic Irishman, a politician, Chief of Homicide
text: stands at the top of the steps leading to the front door.
text: As they climb up toward him...
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: I been waiting... I have to do
dialog: everything myself. Photo, crime
dialog: tech, the Coroner are already
text: inside. The Landlady calls it in;
dialog: tenant is not answering when
text: called, she sticks her head in,
text: sees the body, uses the deceased's
dialog: telephone to call 911. Otherwise
dialog: nothing disturbed. It's all yours,
dialog: kid. I'll take care of the Mouth
dialog: and the Haircut.
text: M.J. and Ruben enter...
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT HOUSE - HALL - DAY
text: Four uniformed cops stand in the hall securing the premises;
text: at the back one cop stands by a stunned and tearful woman
text: chain-smoking (the Landlady).
dialog: M.J.
dialog: (to cop)
dialog: That the Landlady?
dialog: (to Ruben)
dialog: You wanna talk to her, Ruben?
dialog: (back to cops)
dialog: Who was first on the scene?
text: Mike answers her question by answering to Ruben!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I was.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: (forcefully)
dialog: I'm over here? What's your name,
dialog: Officer?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Michael Johnson.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: You touch anything, Mike? Pick up
dialog: anything? Use the doorknob? I
dialog: don't want to find your prints on
dialog: anything later and you tell me you
dialog: forgot to tell me.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No. I didn't.
text: She glances at him, at the SLIGHTLY OLD INFLECTION ON THE "I
text: DIDN'T." But moves on, as Ruben goes to the Landlady...
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAY
text: The same YOUNG WOMAN we saw jogging, is now dead. Hair
text: still in a long braid. She wears only a blouse, open and
text: pushed back. She is on her back in the bathtub, with one
text: leg dangling over the side of the tub. The effect is
text: slightly posed, but casual, relaxed.
text: Bending over her is DOC, the Coroner, WITHDRAWING A HUGE
text: MEAT THERMOMETER FROM HER SIDE.
text: M.J. APPEARS IN THE BACK OF THE SHOT taking in the scene.
text: Foreground, Doc reads the thermometer. The photographer is
text: finishing up his shots. The room is crowded. Two Coroner's
text: men wait in the doorway, a stretcher standing on end between
text: them; M.J. has to pass between them to come down to the
text: body. THROUGHOUT WE FOCUS ON M.J.'S FACE; HER REACTION TO
text: THE SCENE, RATHER THAN DWELLING ON THE SCENE ITSELF.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON M.J.:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOC (V.O.)
dialog: Liver and rigor are telling me
dialog: about eight hours. I'm gonna take
dialog: her out now if it's alright.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: I'm seeing ligature marks on her

speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You got it. Same as the other two.
text: THE TELEPHONE RINGS.
speaker_heading: COP (V.O.)
dialog: Tell whoever she can't come to the
text: phone, she's all tied up.
dialog: Nobody laughs...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: That's real old material, get a new
dialog: writer...
text: She picks up the phone after the second ring, holding
text: it in tissue someone hands her...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: PHONE VOICE
dialog: (extremely cheerful)
dialog: Hello! This is Geena Martinez, how
dialog: are you this morning?
dialog: M.J.
dialog: What is this about, Ms Martinez?
speaker_heading: PHONE VOICE
dialog: I'm conducting a telephone survey
dialog: to determine whether you're
dialog: satisfied with your insurance on
dialog: your personal valuables...
text: M.J. gently hangs up the phone. She has been looking at the
text: Dead Woman... They pick up where they left off.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: He used something soft, like a
text: stocking or a bathrobe tie.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Anybody find it?
text: No answer as the Coroner's men crowd in beside M.J. to begin
text: lifting the body out of the tub. M.J. takes one last look
text: into the dead woman's eyes...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Cover her up, please.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: Ruben still talking to the Landlady and taking notes. M.J.
text: approaches Mike... takes him aside...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Mike. Why don't you tell me what's
dialog: bothering you?
text: Mike is acutely uncomfortable.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out
dialog: and sooner is a hell of lot better
dialog: than later.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Well, there's something missing in
dialog: there. There was something around
dialog: her neck when I came in there, but
text: it's gone now.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Who came in after you?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Lieutenant Quinn.
text: She seems relieved. Brightly:

dialog: Well, it's all right, then, Mike.
dialog: Thanks.
scene_heading: EXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY
text: In the door, M.J. appears, looking out thoughtfully over the

speaker_heading: HELEN

text: HELEN She drops to her knees and tries to lean out further
dialog: into the hall...
text: POV. The floor seems to melt and roll in waves toward her.

dialog: don't even care about the truth?!
dialog: I killed her in the bathtub.
speaker_heading: NIKKO
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CONFESSOR
dialog: Because she was dirty, a dirty
dialog: girl!
speaker_heading: NIKKO
dialog: How? How did you do it, Harvey?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: With a knife?
speaker_heading: NIKKO
dialog: Good guess, but not good enough.
dialog: Get the fuck outta here...
text: He has stood as M.J. passes coming from Quinn's office. He
text: falls into stride with her through the crowded scene... He
text: is sweaty and sniffs his armpits as a matter of general
dialog: hygiene checkup...
speaker_heading: NIKKO
dialog: What am I wasting my time with this
dialog: shit for?
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Because it's your job, that's all.
speaker_heading: NIKKO
dialog: Not what I meant; why me?
dialog: M.J.
dialog: (cutting)
dialog: Maybe it's something you did in
dialog: this life, Nikko...
text: It has the flavor of a spoiled intimacy, an unfinished
text: argument... He pantomimes she got him with a poison dart.
speaker_heading: NIKKO
dialog: Got me. That really hurt! You...
text: Ruben joins them; Nikko stifles and turns away...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: (to Ruben)
dialog: Get Mercer to run the medical,
dialog: dental, legal bills, laundry and
dialog: dry cleaning receipts, extermin-
dialog: ators, mailmen, grocery and
dialog: drugstore deliveries, handymen,
dialog: plumbers...
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: It's mostly done, they got nobody
dialog: in common, the three of them... No
dialog: mutual friends -- the Landlady says
dialog: nobody was ever there, she never
dialog: saw her with anybody.
text: They are approaching PACHULSKI'S desk. PACHULSKI is on
text: phone. Pachulski is looking at M.J., grinning...
speaker_heading: PACHULSKI
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yes, ma'am, I know. You can't talk
dialog: her right now... because she's
text: busy, she's all tied up.
dialog: (sotto to M.J.)
text: Deep Throat's back.
text: He hits the speaker phone...
speaker_heading: FEMALE PHONE VOICE
dialog: This is the third one. You've got
dialog: a serial killer here. When are you
dialog: going to start warning people?
speaker_heading: PACHULSKI
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Fourteen calls from this broad.
dialog: And she ain't stupid.
text: M.J. signals for GIGI to trace the call. Takes the phone,
text: switches off the speaker...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Who is this?
scene_heading: INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY
text: HELEN on phone
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Who is this?
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Inspector Halloran, Homicide. I'm
dialog: in charge here.
speaker_heading: PACHULSKI
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Ask her about the moon bike.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: I'm really interested in your
dialog: ideas. The moon bike. What is
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What is wrong with you people?
dialog: The first two, I thought he might
dialog: be on a lunar cycle because they
dialog: were 28 days apart, but obviously
dialog: not. This new one is only two
dialog: weeks.
text: Pachulski is delighted at the joke he's played on M.J., M.J.
text: not so much... Gigi signals they're getting it.
speaker_heading: HELEN (cont'd)
dialog: You want to joke about moonbikes?!
dialog: M.J.
dialog: No, ma'am. This is no joke. And
dialog: neither is tying up telephone lines
text: to police with crank calls while
dialog: people in trouble are trying to get
dialog: through for help.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You're calling me a crank?
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Do you have any evidence to report,
dialog: ma'am? Do you know any of the
dialog: victims...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I think this is number three...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: (over her)
dialog: That's an opinion, not evidence...
text: Gigi hands her a slip of paper... M.J. reads it... glares
text: at Pachulski who is still laughing. M.J. knows the name on
dialog: the slip of paper...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: (covers the phone)
dialog: Helen Hudson. Get Ruben back
dialog: here?
text: As she turns back to the phone...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: HELEN, now wearing slippers and shorts with the same T-shirts
text: she slept in, is standing behind the living room curtains
text: looking down at the street. She hears a code knock, then a
text: key turns in the lock. She moves to greet ANDY her
text: assistant and friend. ANDY is laden down with groceries and
text: mail. HELEN immediately reaches a hand up to touch his
dialog: face...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Where were you? Don't tell me.
dialog: It's just under seventy, right? The
text: sun is strong but the air is dry
dialog: and fresh...
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Would you please get your hands off
dialog: my face, Tallulah? What happened
dialog: to the newspaper?
text: He withdraws a popsicle from the bag, offers it to her.
text: When she rejects it, he takes it for himself.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Well! Aren't we the daring one?
dialog: What's morbid and ghastly enough in
dialog: the news to make Doctor Helen set
dialog: foot outside her door? The antenna
dialog: is gone off her car again. I had
dialog: no music, all the way to the
dialog: market. Let me find a garage for
dialog: it?
text: They're in the kitchen area; Andy unpacking stuff...
dialog: expensive goodies...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I've told you: I can't afford to
dialog: garage it.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Are you kidding? You buy enough
dialog: gourmet junk every week... most of
dialog: which rots... to garage a fleet of
text: stretch limos.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I had the dream again.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And I got another call. This time
dialog: he spoke. He said "You and me, you
dialog: and me."
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: A little heavy breathing is what
dialog: most of us yearn for. Forget it.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: He whispered, but it was him! I
dialog: know it was him!
text: Andy now stops to address this seriously...
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: He can't phone you unless the
dialog: warden gets an okay from you. Did
dialog: you give him an approval?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Andy? When a three-year-old says
text: there's a monster under the bed,
dialog: you don't say 'forget it'. You
dialog: look under the bad.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm three years old. Call the
dialog: prison.
text: Her fear is so palpable, she is so nakedly vulnerable it
text: breaks his heart. He puts his arms around her.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh God. I'm really crazy.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: When was the last time you washed
dialog: your hair?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (shaky, but trying)
dialog: Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my
dialog: coiffure?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Monsieur Andy can smell your
dialog: coiffure. And guess what else?
text: He pats her thighs... she walks to the window as he talks...
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Cellulite. What do you say I
dialog: blindfold you and take you to the
dialog: gym. Aerobics with housewives...
scene_heading: HELEN AT WINDOW
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Andy?
text: Andy has heard this tone before: panic attack alert.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Here we go again.
text: ANGLE AT WINDOW TO INCLUDE THEIR POV OF STREET
text: In a parked car a man is reading a newspaper that hides his
text: face. Behind him is parked a slightly beat up red Saab.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You parked right behind him. The
dialog: one I noticed earlier. I didn't
dialog: say anything, I thought he'd leave.
dialog: Just take a look.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Oh my God! Help! HE'S READING A
speaker_heading: NEWSPAPER!
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: But earlier, he was staring up
dialog: here. Please, Andy.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Okay. You win. 'Dirty Harry'
text: coming up.
text: ANDY leaves the apartment.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT DOOR OF HELEN'S BUILDING - DAY
text: The heavy old industrial door is pushed slightly open, ANDY
text: peers out, sees:
text: ANDY crosses behind the car and then sneaks back, coming
text: up to Driver's side window, surprising the Driver.
text: THE NEWSPAPER DROPS: IT'S RUBEN.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Excuse me, but would you mind
dialog: explaining why you're watching the
dialog: lady upstairs?
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: None of your fucking business.
text: Usurping RUBEN'S aggressive attitude, ANDY leans his face
text: close to RUBEN'S window.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Listen, asshole, I've got a gun...
text: RUBEN grabs ANDY by the collar and yanks his head inside the
text: car. With the other hand he pulls his gun and pushes it up
text: ANDY'S nose.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: I hate this...
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Only kidding!
text: RUBEN pushes the 'up' button on the window, capturing ANDY'S
text: head in a deadlock. Then he opens the door, gets out, slams
text: door, forcing the squawking ANDY into a helpless frisk
text: position. We HEAR HELEN scream, (O.S.). Ignoring this,
text: RUBEN begins to frisk ANDY.
text: M.J. APPROACHING IN HER OWN CAR, SEES THE ACTION, BRAKES
text: FAST AND GETS OUT.
text: HELEN at window, shouting.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'm calling the police!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Andy enters, followed by Ruben and M.J., who holds up her
dialog: badge to Helen.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Investigators Halloran and Goetz. I
dialog: apologize for Goetz, he's a
text: firehouse dog.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: (trying to defuse)
dialog: I'm okay. I really kind of enjoyed
dialog: it.
text: Uncomfortable silence for a beat as they try to take in
text: what's happening, who's who and what's what. Helen is
text: confused, fighting back fear...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: (trying to communicate
dialog: here)
dialog: Ring the gong, he goes. Poor
dialog: impulse control.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Is he out?
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (to Andy)
dialog: If he's not out, why are they here?
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Because of your phone calls.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What calls? I haven't made any
dialog: calls.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: (to distract)
dialog: Are you staying long? Shall I shut
dialog: the door? Make your coffee? Make
dialog: the beds?
dialog: M.J.
dialog: (to Helen)
dialog: You talked to me. Do you remember?
text: The two women measure each other, Helen struggling to
text: control herself. A beat.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You were the one that talked about
dialog: moonbikes and called me a crank?
dialog: Oh God, I am!
dialog: (to Andy)
dialog: Make them some coffee.
dialog: (to M.J.)
dialog: Halloran, is it? Investigator
dialog: Goetz? I had a crank call myself--
dialog: he said...
dialog: (a moment of real
dialog: fear)
dialog: I thought it might be Daryll Lee
dialog: Cullum. I thought he might be out
dialog: of prison.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: Daryll Lee Cullum? I don't think
dialog: so. If he's escaped we'd have the
dialog: National Guard, cops'd be crawling
dialog: through sewers. You'd have a guard
dialog: on your front door.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: I want to tell you it's a great
dialog: honor to meet you and talk to you.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You don't admire me. No police
dialog: admire me. I got one of you
dialog: killed. Why don't you say right
dialog: out what you're here for?
dialog: M.J.
dialog: You called us, Doctor Hudson.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes, I did. Poor impulse control.
dialog: The accounts of the firs two
dialog: murders made it so clear they were
dialog: the work of the same man, but you
dialog: kept announcing they were
dialog: unrelated. You'll never catch him
dialog: that way.
text: M.J. regards her for a moment...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: (to Andy)
dialog: Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take
dialog: mine black.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're absolutely correct. The
dialog: politicians don't want panic
text: headlines spoiling the Festival of
dialog: Love.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Well, let's thank God you and
text: Inspector Goetz are on the case,
dialog: then.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Would you want to work with us on
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh, my God, no! I'm a clinical
text: hysteric, with panic syndrome, and
dialog: anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm
dialog: afraid of everything, real and
dialog: imaginary. I never leave this
dialog: apartment now. Nobody ever comes
dialog: here. I just wanted to get your
dialog: attention. I write and I used to
dialog: lecture on these crimes, but... I'm
dialog: not competent.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: I think you are. I really admire
dialog: everything you've done; it would be
dialog: an honor to work with you, and we
dialog: need all the help we can get,
dialog: especially yours.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Inspector Halloran, that is so much
dialog: bullshit, you don't like or admire
dialog: me, but the beautiful part is I
dialog: don't give a fuck. That's the
dialog: upside of having a breakdown.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Well, it's a hell of an apartment
dialog: you got here. I'm living one step
dialog: away from the projects, myself, but
dialog: I get to go to work every day,
dialog: wading in blood and guts. I guess
dialog: the books you wrote about these
dialog: sons of bitches paid off pretty
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Will you go. Andy, make them go.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: You can't go out lecturing? Tough
dialog: shit. Women are dying. Where can
dialog: I lay this stuff out?
text: She dumps files of photos, etc., out on Helen's cocktail
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I don't want this. What are they?
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: You called us, Doctor, if you don't
dialog: want to look at them here, how
dialog: about downtown. I'll drive you
dialog: down...
text: She pushes the pictures off onto the floor, tries to get up
text: to leave the room. M.J. and Ruben are both appalled at the
text: force of what is happening: an all-out panic attack...
text: Andy races t o the kitchen; Ruben tries to help but Helen
text: fights him off viciously, gasping for air... Andy races
text: back in with a PLASTIC BAG HE PULLS OVER HELEN'S HEAD AND
text: FACE... She hyperventilates into the bag...
text: THE PLASTIC BAG BALLOONS OUT AND BACK IN HELEN'S FACE until
text: she faints. Andy deals with it like an everyday event,
text: treating her very gently...
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: (to Ruben)
dialog: Now look what you did.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: What did I do?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You threatened to drive her
text: downtown. She has agoraphobia.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: Fear of what...
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Open space. She hasn't been out of
dialog: this apartment in three years. I
dialog: didn't used to think it was real...
text: He's making her comfortable.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: We'll get the paramedics...
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Oh, God, uniforms, more stress.
dialog: Let her sleep. It's a self-limiting:
text: she hyperventilates till she passes
text: out, then her breathing goes back
text: to normal, and she wakes up singing
text: like a lark.
dialog: (rocking the
dialog: unconscious Helen)
dialog: We know, don't we, Princess?
dialog: (to them)
dialog: Give her a couple of hours. I know
dialog: about this.
text: M.J. starts to gather up the pictures and files. She is
text: angry and disgusted.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Tell her we're sorry we bothered
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Hey, no. Leave those here. If you
dialog: really want her help. I mean if
dialog: you really do, leave them. Let her
dialog: see them. I'll see they're safe...
text: M.J. takes in the scene; the now soundly sleeping Helen;
text: Andy sitting over her protectively, the files and photos
text: strewn around. Makes a decision...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Tell her to ask for me...
text: She's handing Andy her card...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HELEN'S APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY
text: M.J. AND RUBEN come out in the street... CAMERA IN A HIGH
text: ANGLE LOOKING DOWN ON THEM...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Snotty neurotic bitch...
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Classy madonna.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Sure. She likes you, Rube. She
dialog: likes the way you move. She sure
dialog: as hell isn't in love with me.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: You came in there with this
dialog: attitude...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: (over him)
dialog: Order Chinese for us and meet me
dialog: the library? Anything but beef.
text: She jumps in her car, still steaming, leaving Ruben to move
text: to his car. AS HE MOVES CAMERA FOLLOWS, BECOMING A WIDER
text: ANGLE TO INCLUDE FACADE OF HELEN'S APARTMENT.
text: We can SEE ANDY, SITTING WHERE WE LEFT HIM, HOLDING HELEN IN
text: HIS ARMS. SHE SLEEPS PEACEFULLY. DISTANTLY WE HEAR THE
scene_heading: PHONE RING. ANDY SHOWS IMPATIENCE, THEN CAREFULLY
text: DISENGAGES FROM HELEN SO AS NOT TO DISTURB HER SLEEP.
text: HE MOVES ACROSS THE ROOM UNTIL HE IS OUT OF FRAME. THE SHOT
text: HOLDS ON HELEN FOR A BEAT. PHONE RINGS.
scene_heading: THEN THE CAMERA PANS LEFT (OUR FIRST CLUE THIS IS ANOTHER
text: POINT OF VIEW) ACROSS TO A SECOND WINDOW WHERE IT CATCHES
text: ANDY MOVING UNTIL WE AGAIN DISAPPEARS BEHIND THE BUILDING
text: WALL AND THE CAMERA PANS SMOOTHLY TO THE THIRD WINDOW, WHERE
text: ANDY ENTERS. WE SEE HIM PICK UP THE PHONE AND SPEAK INTO
scene_heading: IT. HE SEEMS IMPATIENT.
text: THEN CAMERA PANS DOWN TO A CELLULAR PHONE, F.G. AND FOCUS
text: RACKS TO E.C.U. AS A FINGER PUSHES THE "END" BUTTON.
speaker_heading: CLOSE: ANDY
text: Putting down the phone. Irritated...
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Shit...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. POLICE LIBRARY - DAY
scene_heading: CLOSE: AN ATTORNEY IN COURT
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY
dialog: ... it was your feeling after
dialog: careful evaluation that he was a
text: sexual sadist who satisfied at
dialog: least four out of ten criteria in
dialog: the DMS III?
text: SHOW M.J. and Ruben watching videotapes, and eating Chinese
text: takeout. HELEN is being interrogated by the ATTORNEY for
text: Daryll Lee Cullum. Helen sure of herself to the point of
dialog: arrogance, which is her undoing...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes. Without question.
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY
dialog: Without question? He only scored
dialog: 40 percent, four out of ten
dialog: criteria? Couldn't another expert
dialog: say he flunked the sexual sadist
dialog: test? What curve are you marking
dialog: on, Doctor?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: The test criteria are only part of
dialog: what we look at in evaluating
dialog: subjects.
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY
dialog: Only part. What else? What did
dialog: you think of his claim that he tied
dialog: this girl to the tree and set fire
dialog: to her because Joan of Arc told him
dialog: to do it.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: He was lying.
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY
dialog: 'Lying. He was lying.' I asked
dialog: you what you thought, not what he
dialog: did.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I thought he was lying.
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY
dialog: You said, first, he was lying. How
dialog: do you know that, Doctor?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Because people who are suffering
dialog: from aural hallucinations hear
text: voices in both ears. Daryll Lee
dialog: told me that Joan of Arc always
text: appeared beside him on his left
text: side and spoke softly in his left
dialog: ear.
text: Murmur of subdued laughter in court.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (emboldened)
dialog: He took pains to hide his actions
dialog: because he knew they were morally
dialog: wrong. He was not acting on mad
dialog: impulse. He was sane and acting
text: out a pattern he carefully followed
dialog: every time.
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY
dialog: (playing causal)
dialog: What pattern was that?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: The same as the first time...
text: She catches herself. The D.A. has leapt to his feet, but now
text: tries to sit down as though nothing was happening, but
text: Helen, the Attorney and the D.A. all are clearly disturbed
text: by the line this questioning is taking.
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY
dialog: The first what?
dialog: (as she hesitates)
dialog: Your Honor, she's got this far, I
dialog: think she should finish. I don't
dialog: think this jury should be left
dialog: wondering where the rest of her
dialog: statement would lead.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I agree, Doctor.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: The first two murders.
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY
dialog: What first two murders. We don't
dialog: know about them here, do we?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (giving up)
dialog: He told me he had done two others
dialog: just like it.
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY
dialog: When was that?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: When he was seventeen.
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY
dialog: And you believed him when he told
dialog: you he had done that.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes. I believed him.
text: The D.A. is rushing to the bench to argue with the Judge.
speaker_heading: JUDGE (V.O.)
dialog: Yes, I'll accept a call for a
dialog: mistrial. Evidence of that other
dialog: crime when the defendant was a
dialog: juvenile is inadmissible and never
dialog: should have been heard by this
dialog: jury...
speaker_heading: FREEZE FRAMES.
text: NOW WE SEE M.J. AND RUBEN LOOKING AT HELEN on the TV screen,

speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: There was no sperm.

speaker_heading: QUINN

dialog: M.J.
dialog: What clues? I'm going to work
dialog: Helen Hudson.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: Would you step outside, Sergeant?
text: M.J. leaves a cautiously silent RUBEN. Once the door shuts,
text: he turns tape back to 'play.'
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE DOOR TO LIBRARY - DAY
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: I'm telling you. Don't you ever
dialog: address me publicly in that tone.
dialog: You'll work what and who I tell you
dialog: to work.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Anybody in this department ever
dialog: worked a serial killer case? She's
dialog: the expert. I need help.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: How about I put Nikko on it?
dialog: M.J.
dialog: That's always your privilege, sir.
text: QUINN snorts, starts on his way, then turns back.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: Sergeant?
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Yessir.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: You ever reflect how this big
dialog: explosion in dead women coincides
dialog: with the flowering of women's lib?
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Yessir. I have reflected on that,
dialog: sir. Which explains my gushing
dialog: deference to you, sir.

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I want to die.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I wouldn't. He'll be back. If you
dialog: want him. The cute brutal type

text: HELEN grins, and ANDY starts to tickle her, she laughs.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You thought he was cute too, didn't
dialog: you? Admit... admit...
text: HELEN now laughing a little too hard. Suddenly the laughter
dialog: changes to tears.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: What? What'd I do?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Reminded me that I used to be
dialog: attractive. That men used to want
dialog: me...
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You slut! No sexy young cop for

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: When are you going to call them?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (big beat)
dialog: About what?
text: ANDY PRODUCES THE FILE M.J. LEFT WITH HIM. Helen looks at
text: it. Andy watches her...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I can't, Andy.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Then, why don't you just die. I'm
dialog: going. They'll find your body
text: years later, the old recluse lady,
dialog: she ate cat food, ten years of the
text: New York Times, unread, piled on
text: top of the unread mail, the TV
dialog: still on. Make up your mind. Live
dialog: or die.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'll get coffee.

speaker_heading: ANDY (O.S.)
dialog: Yes? Inspector Halloran, she's

dialog: (beat)
dialog: She'll call you... No, she'll be

speaker_heading: NIKKO
dialog: Yeah. And you used that. Used me
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Don't put yourself down like that.
dialog: I never used you. I worked my way

speaker_heading: NIKKO
dialog: Yeah, you did that too. You earned

speaker_heading: HELEN (V.O.)
dialog: The way he's posed the bodies...
text: he's flaunting his power to do
dialog: whatever he wants to her. This
dialog: man... He probably seems perfectly
dialog: normal. These murders are organized
dialog: and planned.
text: WE ARE NOW SEEING THE ROOM: M.J. AND RUBEN, HELEN AT A TABLE
text: IN HER OFFICE LAYING OUT THE PICTURES. Helen picks out one
dialog: picture from the rest...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Except for this one. You put that
dialog: one in to test me.
text: M.J. nods, pleased with HELEN>
text: INSERT: THE PICTURE. The victim's body is covered with

speaker_heading: HELEN (V.O.)
dialog: Is it an ongoing case?
text: BACK TO SCENE...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: (nods)
dialog: For months... last October.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: It was a lover or a husband.
dialog: Someone close. Somebody who knew
dialog: her and cared about her.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: (glancing at Ruben)
dialog: How do you know that?
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: He felt remorse. He covered her.
text: HELEN arranges and rearranges photos like tarot cards.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: The bodies have been carefully
dialog: arranged... different positions,
dialog: but somehow the same. The
dialog: positions are brutal... yet
dialog: quite... artful. It's like... a
dialog: signature. He's proud of his
dialog: accomplishments. There are early
dialog: Picassos and late Picassos, but you
dialog: always recognize the hand. He
dialog: wants us to recognize his hand.
dialog: I've seen this hand before... what
dialog: are you hiding?
dialog: M.J.
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Where are the stockings he

dialog: M.J.
dialog: How did you know they were
dialog: stockings?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: I sent Andy out on murder missions.
dialog: For God's sake -- it's the Boston
dialog: Strangler, Alber deSalvo. He used
dialog: their own stockings to strangle
text: them. Tied in a bow-knot.
text: She gets down a file from her bookcase and flops it open to
text: pictures of deSalvo's victims: they are identical...
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: Somebody is imitating his m.o.
dialog: Look for a plumber or carpenter or
dialog: handyman; that's how deSalvo got in
text: the door and caught them off guard.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: The Boston Strangler, when was
dialog: that...?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: In the sixties. He's dead --
text: stabbed to death in prison.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Why imitate a dead serial killer?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: If you knew why, you might know
dialog: where to look for him.
dialog: I don't envy you this; he's not
dialog: done -- he's going to do them faster
dialog: and faster to keep the adrenaline
dialog: rush. Now, I've done what you
dialog: asked me.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Work with me.
speaker_heading: ANDY (O.S.)
dialog: It's good for you.
text: They are startled by his appearance! A little unsettling.
speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (exhausted)
dialog: None of you know anything about it.
dialog: Now go. And Andy, if you persist

dialog: for rape, especially by a man
text: wearing green. Checking out

text: going to hit again, soon.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: (morose)

speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: What I love, the big fight, some

speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Maybe that's why you can't catch

dialog: M.J.
dialog: I just came from her... here's what

speaker_heading: RUBEN

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: MaryJane. You think that logic and
dialog: police procedure, order and science
dialog: and method will hold back the
dialog: horrors of a world gone mad and the
dialog: sickness of the night. I did once.
dialog: But you know how he'll get caught?
dialog: He'll have an accident, or some cop
dialog: will get lucky. You can't catch
dialog: him by being intelligent and
dialog: working hard. Or the worst: there
text: are dozens of women slaughtered in
dialog: the most horrible way, month after
dialog: month. The news stories grow more
text: grotesque and bizarre and in the
dialog: city people lock their doors and
text: windows, and hurry home before
dialog: dark. And then, one day, there are
dialog: no more. What happened? Did he
dialog: just stop? Get tired and disgusted
dialog: and decide not to kill any more?
dialog: Did he kill himself? Did he die in
dialog: an auto accident? Or a fight. Or
dialog: get sick and die? It's like the
text: murderer walked off the edge of the
dialog: earth. And you never know. But
dialog: you keep asking yourself -- when you
dialog: read about a new murder -- is he
dialog: back?
text: M.J. stands. She has noted Ruben's reaction to Helen's
text: story. There is an edge of sarcasm in her voice...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: That's amazing. A whole new book,
dialog: thought up in a minute. Very good.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: All I know how t do is get up,

scene_heading: INT. HELEN'S FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
text: RUBEN is outside the door. HELEN just inside.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: They'll have a guard here tomorrow.
dialog: I know you have the idea, but it'll
dialog: make me feel a lot better.
text: She smiles, and RUBEN turns, walks away. She stays in the
text: doorway watching his retreat. About ten feet away, he
text: suddenly stops.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: Hey!
text: He turns around, she is still in the doorway. He reaches
text: for his wallet, withdraws a card, holds it up to her.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: The number for my cellular.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: Don't hesitate. Anytime. Night or
dialog: day. I mean that.
text: He hods card out to her. HELEN, holding onto the door
text: frame, doesn't move. RUBEN continues to extend his hand
text: with the card in it. It is a charged moment. She is frozen
text: in the doorway; RUBEN refuses to make a move towards her.
text: HELEN summons all her nerve and lets go of the door frame,
dialog: determined not to have any further mortification this night,
text: she takes one shaky step out into the hallway to meet him.
dialog: Then a second step and a third.
text: Her hand touches the card, takes it.
text: She turns her head to gauge the distance she must retreat.
text: What she sees is that the door's Sureclose device has
text: quietly and efficiently closed. The door is locked.
text: Frantic, she turns back toward RUBEN.
speaker_heading: HER POV:
text: RUBEN, now seems a vast distance away from her. He is just
text: turning down the stairs and is gone... The hallway first
text: narrows, squeezing her in, then expands. She is lost in the
text: miles and miles of space between the two walls.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh, God! Help me!
text: RUBEN reappears, races toward her...
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: Tell me what to do!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'm falling! I'm going to fall!
text: She starts to pass out, to sink to her knees, but RUBEN
text: catches her, puts her up against the wall, handling her like
text: a suspect. He puts one hand on the back of her neck,
text: spreads her legs, gets her in frisk position. Somehow, this
text: is comforting to her, but she is still in full-blown
dialog: panic...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ...falling... FALLING!
text: He pressed his body up against hers, his weight anchoring
text: her against the feeling of free-fall.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: I'm right here. I won't let you
dialog: fall.
text: He still has a hand on the back of her neck. Suddenly, the
text: proximity effects him, makes him want to kiss her neck. She
text: begins to hyperventilate.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Don't let go... I can't breathe...
dialog: I'll die!
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: Shhh. It's okay. Just breathe.
dialog: I'll fix it...
text: RUBEN takes out his gun...
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: Put your hands over your ears.
text: RUBEN shoots off the lock. Then he picks HELEN up and
text: carries her back into her apartment.
scene_heading: INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: RUBEN enters and puts HELEN down on the couch, pulls a throw
text: up over her. He sees her Xanax bottle on a table, hands it
text: to her. She takes out three as he pours her some seltzer
text: water, then watches her take the pills. After which he
text: takes the bottle and pockets it.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: The lock...
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: I'll get a locksmith.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Will you stay? Please? I'm afraid
dialog: to sleep... I don't want...him...in
dialog: my head...
text: RUBEN pulls a big chair up beside the sofa. As her eyes
text: close, RUBEN comforts her. TV features the antics of a
text: nervous little prairie dog family. He looks back at HELEN.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP HELEN:
text: We hear a faint but impatient voice call:
dialog: V.O.
dialog: Peter... Peter...
speaker_heading: CROSS FADE TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM (DALY CITY) - NIGHT
text: Dim light. The room is unattractive, over-furnished but not
text: comfortably. A WOMAN is sitting propped up in a double bed.
text: She is in her mid-thirties, but drained and pale, she looks
text: older. A chronic invalid. By her side is a NASTY LITTLE
text: DOG, with ribbon bows in its fur. Near the bed is a TV and
text: video, on which a movie's final credits are running.
text: THE WOMAN IS IMPATIENTLY PUSHING AN INTERCOM BUTTON
text: PETER enters. Younger than the woman, rather good-looking.
text: Boyish and nondescript except for a patch of white skin near
text: his hairline. AN OLD SCAR. He goes straight to TV and puts
dialog: the tape on 'eject.'
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Put in the Kevin Costner.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Why don't we save it for later?
text: It's almost time for Letterman.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You know I don't like to watch talk
dialog: shows by myself. Where're you?
text: He inserts the video she wants and pushes 'play.' Then he
text: approaches the bed, leans over his wife and gently pushes a
text: lock of hair back from the forehead.
text: She ignores him, staring at the screen. The NASTY LITTLE
text: DOG BARES ITS TEETH AND SNAPS AT HIM.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: See, now you've annoyed her. You
dialog: know she doesn't like you to touch
dialog: me.
dialog: (to dog)
dialog: Does she, widdle wee fing! Wuhve
dialog: you so much!
dialog: (to Peter)
dialog: Did you feed her?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes, I fed her. If she says she's
dialog: hungry, she's lying to you. Again.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: She doesn't lie! You sure you fed
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: She lies all the time. Why would I
dialog: say I fed her if I didn't?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: That's what I don't know. Why
dialog: would you lie? That's the
dialog: problem... I can't understand why
dialog: anyone would lie.
text: He leaves. As he goes we can hear the Woman still talking
text: to her dog over the TV soundtrack.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (cont'd)
dialog: You wouldn't lie to Mummy, would
dialog: you? Just to get Dad in trouble?
dialog: Such a naughty widdle dog...
text: HER VOICE FADES AWAY AS WE FOLLOW HIM down the stairs into a
text: small, ill-lit and dreary living room, into a messy kitchen,
text: then through a door leading to the basement. He locks the
text: basement door behind him.
text: THE BASEMENT is brightly lighted, full of high tech, gadgets
text: and computers. As he approaches the bottom stair, we see a
text: small TV/video set attached to a wall. On its screen,
text: freeze-framed and silent, is a video of a PRETTY GIRL at an
text: outdoor rock concert, smiling seductively.
text: PETER puts on a WHITE LAB COAT and then reaches over
text: something to turn the video back on.
text: The CAMERA PANS DOWN to what he has leaned across. It is
text: the YOUNG GIRL from the concert. She is strapped onto a
text: table, her mouth taped shut. A plastic bag covers her head,
text: but not tightly. She is semiconscious. She is being
text: asphyxiated by slow degrees.
text: PETER looks at her, gently pushes the bag up far enough to
text: repeat the tender gesture with her damp hair that he made
text: toward his wife. He whispers:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Didn't I promise I'd come right
dialog: back?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE - DAWN
text: ALL NIGHT FESTIVAL REVELLERS dance across the skyline, of
text: glorious misty green hills, hand in hand. The Camera moves
text: down, across verdant meadows, until we arrive at the bottom
text: of the nearest hill which slopes finally to a highway. A
text: few festival up-all-night REVELERS, looking down at a new
text: CRIME SCENE, where three blue-and-whites are parked, plus a
text: number of unmarked cars.
text: RUBEN ARRIVES IN A TAXI.
text: As he moves past the ever-present SUSAN we THREAD THROUGH
text: THE SCENE TO FIND M.J. M.J. takes one look at RUBEN'S
text: stubble, his yesterday's slept-in clothes, and she turns
text: away. Before RUBEN can catch up with her, NIKKO approaches.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
text: Up all night with a sick friend.
text: NIKKO'S face is tight with anger.
speaker_heading: NIKKO
dialog: You dumb son of a bitch! You don't
dialog: even know how to treat a woman.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: Who? M.J.? Hey, Nikko, explain to
dialog: me why she gave you the boot...
text: He moves to M.J. who stands beside the dead BODY OF THE
text: WOMAN WE LAST SAW STRAPPED TO A TABLE. The plastic bag is
text: now tied tight around her neck. She has been posed beneath
text: a sign that says "NO DUMPING". The usual technicians,
dialog: photographers, Doc, the Coroner, etc.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: Is Niccoletti assigned here?
dialog: M.J.
dialog: (angry about it)
dialog: Quinn decided we should form a task
dialog: force -- they're all one case, now.
dialog: He wants all the senior detectives
dialog: on it...
dialog: (to Doc)
dialog: She wasn't killed here.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Not likely.
text: M.J. is kneeling, inspecting everything here; Ruben kneels
dialog: beside her... to Ruben...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Tell me what you see.
text: He inspects the dead girl's fingernails.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: She didn't fight back, no hair or
dialog: skin under her fingernails. I'm
dialog: not seeing any bruises or
dialog: contusions...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: What about her arms?
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: Needle marks, fresh, here. look at
dialog: this...
text: Nikko appears, looming over her...
speaker_heading: NIKKO
dialog: Probably so stoned she never knew
dialog: what got her. Like Goetz's sick
dialog: friend. Right Goetz?
text: They ignore him. M.J. stands...
speaker_heading: RUBEN
text: She's blue as hell. No marks on her
dialog: neck. Asphyxiated? not the same --
dialog: no ligature marks. Outdoors...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Look at her legs.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
text: Spread out like she was sexually
dialog: assaulted here.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: After she was dead.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: She was dragged up here from the
dialog: road, you can see the tracks. She
text: was already dead or unconscious.
dialog: Let's get plaster casts on any --
dialog: all footprints.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: If this is just the dump site,
dialog: where did he do the job? Where did
dialog: he pick her up?
speaker_heading: NIKKO
dialog: Doped up kids all over town. Park
dialog: was full of them last night. Very
dialog: easy pickin'. Goetz's type.
text: Ruben hits him, Nikko reflexively throws a punch that grazes
text: Ruben. Everybody stops in astonishment. M.J. steps between
dialog: them. Ready to get physical herself; they settle...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: What the hell are you doing? The
dialog: Mouth and the Haircut are right
dialog: down there, thank God they didn't
dialog: see that.
text: Down below, Susan and the Haircut are interviewing Festival-
dialog: of-Lovers.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Niccoletti, they're on the wrong
dialog: side of the tape, you want to push
dialog: them back? Now.
text: Nikko trots off to Susan and the Haircut. M.J. gestures for
text: RUBEN, now on his feet and dabbing at a split lip, to follow
text: her back to the cars. As they move more slowly down the
dialog: hillside to their cars...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Ruben, my God, I ought to put you
dialog: on report.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: You're right. I can't stand that
dialog: bastard. Sorry.
dialog: (getting back to
dialog: work)
dialog: This is something new. Not the
dialog: same guy, that's for sure.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Yeah, everything's different.
text: But she seems unhappy... to techs standing by:
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Get the pictures, and casts of
text: footprints.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: Look at him, grandstanding...
text: Nikko is talking to Susan Schiff...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: That's all we need...
text: She strides toward them...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Detective Niccoletti?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What's this about the Boston
dialog: Strangler, M.J.?
text: M.J. looks at Nikko. He should know better. She's also
dialog: thinking: is this a good thing to have the media announce at
dialog: this point -- or not?
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Hey, Susan -- I'm sorry, you're on
dialog: the wrong side of the tape. We're
text: still trying to find any footprints
dialog: or tire marks and we don't want to
dialog: chew up the ground, okay? I'll
dialog: talk to you later.
dialog: (to Nikko)
dialog: You, too.
dialog: She's got Susan outside the tape...
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Inspector, will you confirm
dialog: somebody is copying the Boston
dialog: Strangler? This is the fourth, is
dialog: that correct?
dialog: M.J.
dialog: We're going to review all the
dialog: evidence carefully before making
dialog: any statement...
text: She is getting into her car; Ruben jumps in on the other
text: side. Susan races for her silver Audi...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Ruben, put the light on...
text: From outside the car as they drive away we see Ruben's arm
text: clap the magnetic flasher on the top of their unmarked car.
text: M.J. switches it on... A CHASE ENSUES. SUSAN has a faster
text: car, but M.J. is a better driver. Stomach dropping hills,
text: trolley cars, the corkscrew turns of Lombard Street, all the
text: familiar San Francisco chase scenes.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Now listen up, Ruben. You never,
dialog: never, never mess with somebody
dialog: inside the case!
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: Excuse me? Excuse me?! What do
dialog: you...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: You damn well better start working
text: on that impulse control. A woman
dialog: who is implicated in this case?
dialog: Someone who's practically a piece
dialog: of evidence?
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: It's against your rules that I try
dialog: to help a witness who's scared
dialog: shitless? Who's...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: The woman's unstable. You could
dialog: wind up with a harassment charge.
dialog: Anything. You're like some horny
dialog: little teenager.
text: M.J. takes another two-wheel corner. In the rear view
text: mirror, M.J. watches SUSAN lose control of her car as she
text: tries to make a tight turn, M.J. smiles in contempt.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Anybody who's ever watched TV knows
dialog: about that corner.
text: Having lost SUSAN, M.J. slows down to a normal speed.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Everybody could see you -- unshaved,
dialog: same clothes from yesterday,
text: reeking of sex.
text: RUBEN'S eye-brows lift. She peels into the HQ parking lot
text: and jumps out.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: (going away)
dialog: Park the car. Call the lab. Get
text: Doc to lean on the coroner for a
dialog: really fast prelim on the sperm.
text: RUBEN gets out of the car to cross to the driver's side...
speaker_heading: M.J. (O.S.)
dialog: When you get it, call me.
text: RUBEN look after her, a smile of delight on his face.
speaker_heading: RUBEN

speaker_heading: QUINN

speaker_heading: NIKKO

speaker_heading: QUINN

dialog: nothin' about sex I don't hate.
dialog: But of course, I'm Irish.

speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: So what have we got?
dialog: M.J.
dialog: It's not the same guy. It should be
dialog: a self-solver. No bow around the

dialog: completely different. The others
dialog: were housewives, secretaries, he
dialog: talked his way inside, killed them
dialog: in their own living room or bed- or

dialog: husband or a boyfriend, no family,
dialog: temp waitress, 3 arrests for
dialog: misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI,

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Then what do you need me for?

dialog: She was killed somewhere else and

dialog: wrong with it.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You're saying it's the same man,
dialog: but he's changed his style? That

dialog: of the pleasure...
text: They've turned into the office. Something is wrong...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Who turned off the Internet
dialog: computer...
speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: HELEN
text: She was near a sign that said "No

speaker_heading: HELEN

dialog: was two men, that's why there are

dialog: M.J.
dialog: That's not consistent... You said
dialog: they never changed their style,
dialog: they're robots...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Consistency is the hobgoblin of
dialog: little minds. Tell them to test
dialog: for the chemicals found in Windex.
dialog: That's a product for cleaning

dialog: M.J.
dialog: I know Windex, for God's sake, I

dialog: Injected Windex! Why would he

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half
dialog: way to nailing him. Serial killing
dialog: is irrational and rigid and
dialog: compulsive. This guy has a plan
dialog: all thought out, flexible and
text: complex. He's playing a game with
dialog: us. Who will he imitate next?
dialog: Maybe he's doing all the serial
dialog: killers in history, the great
dialog: innovators, the murderers' hall of
dialog: fame. Just to prove he's better
dialog: than all of them. They got caught;
dialog: he didn't.
dialog: M.J.

scene_heading: INT. PETER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: We see on HIS computer screen a picture of HELEN scanned

text: beside Helen on screen is another image -- of the RED-HEADED
text: woman. He is placing marks on one picture, on the exact
text: corner of Helen's left eyes. As he does so, a red dot
text: appears near the corner of the left eye of the Red-headed
text: woman. Both pictures are dappled with similar dots. It
text: looks very odd, as though someone had stuck Post-its all
text: over the images. Around him, as he works are other pictures:

speaker_heading: LAMPS, ETC.

text: SUDDENLY, FOREGROUND, HELEN'S HEAD POPS UP, HUGE! SHE IS

scene_heading: MAN STOPS, TRYING TO LOCATE DIRECTION. HE DECIDES. LEAPS

text: ONTO THE TOP OF THE WALL!
text: NOW HE STANDS ON THE PARTITION, LOOKING AROUND AT THE
scene_heading: GROUNDPLAN (AS IT WERE) OF THIS APARTMENT MAZE FROM A HIGH

text: TO WALK ALONG LIKE A CAT ON A GARDEN WALL, ABLE TO SEE ON
text: BOTH SIDES INTO WHATEVER ROOMS HE IS PASSING.
text: HE DROPS OFF THE WALL FOR A MOMENT INTO HER BEDROOM.
text: INTERCUT MAN AND HELEN. HE LOOKS FOR HER, PRODS THE BED
speaker_heading: COVERS.
text: THEN LEAPS BACK UP TO THE TOP OF THE WALL.
text: SHE TAKES A VASE AND THROWS IT OVER THE WALL INTO THE

text: ALREADY FIGURED IT OUT: HE LEAPS CLEAR ACROSS AN OPENING
text: ONTO THE WALL THAT LEADS DIRECTLY TO HER.
text: SHE HITS THE REMOTE: THE CURTAINS SWEEP OPEN, AND MORE LIGHT
text: COMES IN NOW FROM THE STREET.

text: BLOCK AND THE MAN FALLS BACK INSIDE THE APARTMENT.
text: LIGHT FROM HALL GIVES US OUR FIRST LOOK AS RUBEN TEARS THE

speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I can explain!
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: The fuck you can!
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Helen! Are you okay? HELEN!

speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: Did this animal touch you?
text: She shakes her head, turns and runs out of the room, as
text: RUBEN catches sight of BURT.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: Turn on a light and call in the

text: BURT rushes to okay. RUBEN FRISKS THE MAN.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: No gun!
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: Bullshit's gonna get your balls

speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Chow. Conrad Chow.

speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Backup's here...
speaker_heading: RUBEN

speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: You break into her apartment to

speaker_heading: CONRAD
dialog: The door was open, swear to God,

speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: Where is it?
speaker_heading: CONRAD
dialog: I'm trying to tell you. It's on the

text: Ruben shoves Conrad into Backup Cop's hands.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Ruben comes running in, sees a parcel lying on pillow...
text: scoops it up, and rips it open. It's a book. He returns
text: to Conrad, who is now surrounded by police. Ruben holds the
dialog: book up like a question.
speaker_heading: CONRAD
dialog: Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that
dialog: book, he wanted the lady to have
dialog: it. They won't let him send it to
dialog: her, so I'm getting out, he asks me
dialog: to deliver it in person, he says,
dialog: put it on her pillow. It has all
text: about how he tried to kill her.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: He told you she was loaded, any-
dialog: thing you could steal you could
dialog: keep, Conrad? You bought yourself
dialog: a return ticket to Quentin,
text: breaking and entering.
speaker_heading: CONRAD
text: The door was already open...
speaker_heading: RUBEN

dialog: Send the book to evidence...
speaker_heading: CONRAD

speaker_heading: RUBEN

scene_heading: INT. HELEN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: HELEN is sitting on the floor, her knees pulled up to her
dialog: chest.
speaker_heading: RUBEN (V.O.)
dialog: Helen? Open the door. The guy's
text: nothing. A burglar.
text: She sits there, says nothing.
speaker_heading: RUBEN (V.O.)
dialog: Open the door. Please.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Why don't you shoot off the lock?
text: She starts to laugh. The sound is awful. After a moment,
text: she gets up on wobbly legs and opens the door. RUBEN takes
text: her to the sink, sort of sits her down on it. Wets a
text: washcloth, goes to sponge off her face. She is trembling.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: He was in my apartment!
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: I know, baby. I know.
text: Without warning, in some sort of manic phase of a freak-out,
text: she breaks away from him, ricochets through bedroom, down
text: the hallway, RUBEN follows, tries to put his arms around
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: It's okay... you're safe with me!
text: He pulls her down into a chair with him, his arms tight
text: around her, holding her still. He smoothes her hair, rubs
text: her neck, pets her like a frightened and resistant cat.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: When I was a little kid, and I'd be
dialog: in a state, my father would hold me
text: on his lap, until all the fight
dialog: would go out of me...
text: She breaks free and whacks him across his nose.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You think you're my Daddy?
dialog: There is something so perverse about this, so erotic, that
text: RUBEN kisses her. She goes limp, kisses him back, then
text: she's suddenly sobbing. His nose is bleeding, but she's
text: smiling. Something between them has finally connected.
dialog: Been agreed upon.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: Helen...honey, you know I gotta go.
text: He digs out his sneaky gun from whenever he keeps it.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: You know how to use this?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: They taught me at the FBI. I was
dialog: very good at it. It scared me... I
dialog: liked it.
speaker_heading: RUBEN
dialog: You take it, hang on to it, it'll
dialog: make you feel safer. Stay put.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What else?
dialog: He goes.
text: A SONG BEGINS, PRELAPPING THE FOLLOWING SCENES: "MURDER BY

dialog: "Once that you've decided on a killing
dialog: First you make a stone of your heart
dialog: And if you find that your hands are still willing
dialog: You can turn murder into an art..."
text: HELEN OPENS THE WEAPON, SEEMINGLY COMPETENT ENOUGH TO HANDLE

text: HEAVES A SIGH OF RELIEF.
text: THE SONG CONTINUES...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY
text: THE FBI ARRIVES. High angle, looking down: three identical
text: cars draw in front, park with military precision: all four
text: doors on the all three cars open at the same time and
text: identically dressed men, in suits, get out, slam the doors
text: in sync., and march toward the front steps to HQ, ignoring a
text: couple of bemused cops smoking on the sidewalk...
scene_heading: INT. POLICE HQ - CONTINUOUS
text: As the parade of FBI, led by their Commander SAKS, walk down
text: the corridor from the front door, toward CAMERA, performing
text: a smart right angle turn, and (CAMERA PANNING TO FOLLOW)
text: continue away from CAMERA down another corridor. Through
text: the glass partitions and in the halls they pass cops who
text: pretend they aren't looking at them: no eye contact between
text: cops and FBI. The cops are at ease; bellies slop over
text: belts; neatly pressed blouses strain over breasts; sweat
text: stains; shirtsleeves. The marching men wouldn't sweat.
text: QUINN emerges from his office and sees them arriving. He
text: gets his jacket off a hook on the back of the door, signals
text: a few top officers to follow. He looks resigned...
scene_heading: INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY (LATER)
text: M.J., RUBEN, NIKKO, and a number of other officers are being
text: addressed by SAKS, an FBI agent. At the back are three more
text: FBI AGENTS, suited and tied. QUINN stands off to one side.
text: THE SONG IS JUST ENDING, ON A CD PLAYER IN THE ROOM. A
text: projector beams up a copy of the note RUBEN found in the
dialog: phone booth.
dialog: Dr. Hudson: Don't lose your head.
dialog: "Once that you've decided on a killing
dialog: First you make a stone of your heart
dialog: And if you find that your hands are still willing
dialog: You can turn murder into an art.
dialog: Well, if you have a taste for this experience
dialog: You're flushed with your very first success
dialog: Then you must try a twosome or a threesome
dialog: Before your conscience bothers you much less.
dialog: Then you can join the ranks of the illustrious
dialog: In history's great dark hall of fame
dialog: All of our greatest killers were industrious
dialog: At least the ones that we all know by name."
dialog: SAKS speaks...
speaker_heading: SAKS
dialog: Hello. I am (research title)
dialog: Meryhew Saks. The song is called
dialog: "Murder By Numbers." The
dialog: performers are a group called The
dialog: Police. Adam here...
dialog: ... from Behavioral Science is
dialog: working out exactly what this
text: perpetrator is trying to telegraph
dialog: in the note. This is an extremely
dialog: complex case, and we have a lot of
text: fancy theories floating around.
dialog: We're not ruling out the possib-
dialog: ility of three Copycat serial
dialog: killers. We have Quantico working
dialog: on graphology, the Washington lap
text: is cloning DNA from the secretor.
dialog: It's our feeling that the best lead
dialog: we have is the two sperm samples in
dialog: one of the victims. We have a team
dialog: sweeping sperm banks. Now I want
dialog: to say a few word to you local
dialog: people. Your Commissioner asked
dialog: for our assistance. The Bureau
dialog: does not send us in on these cases
dialog: to lord it over the local police.
dialog: We couldn't catch up on what you
dialog: people know if we had a year. We
dialog: have nation-wide resources and hard
dialog: state of the art forensic science;
dialog: you have the local savvy. Together
dialog: we can be unbeatable. Which one is
dialog: Inspector Halloran?
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Over here.
text: SAKS approaches M.J., guides her away from the others.
text: TWO SHOT: Saks is unctuous and insincere, self-confident.
speaker_heading: SAKS
dialog: We don't see too many lady homicide
dialog: detectives. You have my respect.
dialog: Have you discussed the note with
dialog: Dr. Hudson?
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Someone broke into her place last
dialog: night. It wasn't connected to our
dialog: case, but it shook her up pretty
dialog: bad so I haven't...
text: QUINN joins them, SAKS gives him a nod.
speaker_heading: SAKS
dialog: I was just about to advise the
dialog: Inspector here not to show Dr.
dialog: Hudson the note.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a
dialog: pattern develop...
speaker_heading: SAKS
dialog: (riding over her)
dialog: We know Helen. She's not exactly a
dialog: credible collaborator. Especially
dialog: late in the day...
dialog: M.J.
text: She takes tranquilizers her doctor
dialog: prescribes.
speaker_heading: SAKS
dialog: Who prescribes the brandy?
text: M.J.'S look makes SAKS smile. QUINN is called to the phone.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: How come you're so up on Dr.
dialog: Hudson?
speaker_heading: SAKS
dialog: She is a writer, writing best
dialog: selling books about serial killing.
dialog: Giving lectures she's well-paid
dialog: for. Her interests are not the
dialog: interests of law enforcement.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: SAKS
dialog: We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's
dialog: phone. I know you won't mention
dialog: it.
dialog: So much for any trusting relationship, right? QUINN has
text: arrived, addresses SAKS.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: Sorry to interrupt. I need a word
dialog: with my officer...
text: He turns to M.J. Diplomatically, SAKS moves away.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: M.J., I'm going to have to borrow
dialog: Ruben. The alien-smuggling thing
dialog: in Chinatown is going down tomorrow
dialog: night and Jack's kid got hit by a
dialog: car. I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: What does this mean? Now we got

dialog: away from it anymore.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Look at the order he's doing
dialog: them... He did three as the Boston
dialog: Strangler just to tell us a copycat
dialog: serial killer was at work. Then he
dialog: did one like the Hillside Strang-
dialog: ler. And then one as Son of Sam.
dialog: To lead us on -- to where and what
dialog: end? And he's doing more than that
text: -- he's imitating each killer's

speaker_heading: HELEN (V.O.)
dialog: He needs to prove they don't

dialog: I am so glad Jesus didn't let me

scene_heading: EXT. HER BUILDING - NIGHT

text: STREET: HER OLD SAAB IS PARKED. THE ANTENNA IS GONE, AND

scene_heading: EXT. MULUSKEY AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

scene_heading: FLAGGING HER DOWN --

text: TOWARD THE AUDITORIUM...
text: SAKS, CURSING, LEAPS TO HIS FEET; A SWAT TYPE AIMS HIS GUN
text: AFTER HELEN, BUT SAKS PUTS HIS HAND ON THE WEAPON STOPPING
text: HIM FROM SHOOTING.
text: NEW ANGLE: Helen's Saab speeds out of the tree shadowed
text: street into the bright plaza in front of the auditorium, and
text: brakes behind M.J.'s car.
text: CLOSE: HELEN. Sudden silence when she kills the car engine.
text: She gets out of the car. As she walks even her sneakers
text: make an echo from the silent stone facade... She walks up
dialog: the wide stairs...
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
text: The huge doors creak open and Helen enters. She stands,
text: listening: light streams in from the exterior through tall
text: windows, otherwise it's all back shadows, weird enough
text: without the distorted vision, the vertigo that momentarily
dialog: returns...
text: Helen wills herself to move into the deep space before her.
text: She stands listening: we HEAR the creaks and tiny snaps of a
text: building cooling in the night air. Or is the movement of
dialog: Peter somewhere in the room?
text: She whirls to face a distance sound that echoes in the
dialog: auditorium...
text: CLOSE: HELEN staring, trying to SEE. NOTHING.
speaker_heading: THEN:
text: PETER IS STARING BACK. HIS FACE BECOMES DARYLL LEE. THE
speaker_heading: VISION SNAPS.
text: HELEN: SHE TURNS AND WALKS PAST THE ROSTRUM OF THE STAGE TO
text: A DOOR UPSTAGE LEFT... OPENING INTO A LONG AND DARK
text: CORRIDOR. SHE GROPES FOR LIGHT SWITCHES, CAN'T FIND OUT ANY.
text: THE CORRIDOR LEADS TO THE LADIES' ROOM ON THE RIGHT. AS SHE
text: WALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY, IT BEGINS TO RESEMBLE TO HER THE
text: SAME WALK SHE TOOK AT THE BEGINNING: AND SUDDENLY AT THE
text: DOOR TO THE LADIES' ROOM SHE SEEMS TO SEE THE FAT COP. SHE
text: SHAKES HER HEAD AND THE VISION IS GONE.
text: REPLACED BY INT. LADIES' ROOM. THE COP IS NOW HELD FROM
text: BEHIND BY DARYLL LEE - SMILING AT HELEN. IN REVERSE, WE SEE

scene_heading: TERRIBLE SLOW MOTION INTERCUTS BETWEEN DARYLL LEE GRINNING

text: FROM HER NECK BY ONE HAND...
text: HELEN STARTS TO RUSH TO HER ASSISTANCE, WHEN THE LIGHTS GO
text: OUT. PETER TAKES HER FROM BEHIND, SWIFTLY DISARMING HER,
text: REGARDING THE GUN WITH AMAZEMENT.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You cheated! You said you'd come
dialog: die with me.
text: WITHOUT PAUSE HE PUMPS TWO BULLETS INTO M.J. WHERE SHE
text: HANGS. HER BODY JUMPS FROM THE IMPACT OF THE BULLETS, HER
text: HEAD FLIES BACK AND SHE SLUMPS, THE NOOSE TIGHTENS; THE DOOR
text: OF THE STALL SWINGS SLOWLY SHUT, AS PETER TURNS ON HELEN,
text: WHERE SHE LIES ON THE FLOOR, HORROR-STRUCK.
scene_heading: EXT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Listen to them! We'll be on all
dialog: three channels.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No. Not yet.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Do it. If that's what all this
dialog: carnage is about, then do it. Have
dialog: enough guts to do it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Don't talk to me about courage. I
dialog: know death, what it's like to kill.
dialog: You're not a killer -- you watched
dialog: Daryll Lee kill that cop and you
dialog: didn't make a peep, because you
dialog: were paralyzed with fear. You
dialog: chocked. I know something else about
dialog: you.
text: Peter is jerking about with amphetamine energy; he pops a
text: pill into his mouth and swallows...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You want one? No? There was
dialog: something in you that was
dialog: fascinated, that wanted to see what
dialog: it was like for a man to die.
dialog: Everybody feels it. Like every
dialog: person who slows to see a bad
text: accident, or runs to see a fire.
dialog: That's true. I see it in you...
dialog: you're the same as me.
text: THERE IS NOISE OUTSIDE... LIKE SOMEONE BREAKING IN.
speaker_heading: PETER

scene_heading: FLOODLIGHTS SUDDENLY ILLUMINATE THE FACADE OUTSIDE,

scene_heading: DARKENING THE SHADOWS FURTHER. GERMAN EXPRESSIONISM.

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We'll keep talking. Until they get
dialog: here. Then...
dialog: (smiles)
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I have no life anymore. I ruined
dialog: your life, make me pay for it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Why did you do that? Didn't you
dialog: have any idea how hard it was for
dialog: me, to get that far? I worshipped
dialog: you. You inspired me. I thought
dialog: you could understand me the way you
dialog: understood the others. I knew that
dialog: about you -- the ones you admired
dialog: were the great murderers; they
dialog: fascinated you.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: That's not who I admire -- I admire
dialog: people who are good at what they
dialog: do, great artists, writers,
dialog: thinkers...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don't have the talent for any of
dialog: those things. All I have a talent
dialog: for is death. And I am one of a
dialog: kind. What do you think of your
dialog: student now? I have made you
dialog: famous, I am your creation and your
dialog: monument.

speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, please. I know what's coming,
dialog: now. "Let me help you..."
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Do anything you want to me. I give
dialog: myself to you. Only put the knife
dialog: down. Isn't this what you always
dialog: wanted? I know it's what we all
dialog: want, to love and to loved. I
dialog: could love you. You could work

speaker_heading: PETER
text: Back in the driver's seat again,
dialog: Doctor? That old dream -- study us
dialog: to see what makes us sick. So you
dialog: can find a cure -- they'd name it
dialog: after you? Death is the only cure
dialog: for people like me.
text: He leans toward her with the knife. This might be the
text: moment. His gun lies on the floor beside him.
text: HER EYES HAVE FLICKED TO THE SHADOW BEHIND HIM; HE SEES IT
text: AND STOOPS TO PICK UP THE GUN AND FIRES INTO THE SHADOWS,
text: TWO OR THREE QUICK ROUNDS. HE TURNS BACK TO HELEN, DROPPING
text: THE GUN TO REACH FOR THE KNIFE.
text: HELEN HEAD BUTTS HIM WITH ASTONISHING STRENGTH, KNOCKING HIM

text: A PATTERN OF RED DOTS FROM LASER BEAM SIGHTS ON THE SWAT
text: TEAM RIFLES DAPPLE PETER'S HEAD AND TORSO.
speaker_heading: SWAT TEAM
text: LIKE A FIRING SQUAD THE TEAM FIRES.
text: PETER'S BODY FLIES THROUGH THE AIR FROM THE IMPACT AND
text: SLIDES SPRAWLING ACROSS THE STAGE TO A STOP.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER
text: M.J. SITS AS PARAMEDIC GENTLY PULL OFF HER SHIRT AND THE
text: BULLET PROOF VEST THAT SAVED HER LIFE.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: Jesus that hurts. You think the
dialog: rib is busted?
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
text: That looks like just a bad bruise.
dialog: I'll tape it up if you want to...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: I'll take some Tylenol and codeine,
dialog: instead, how about a lot of number
dialog: six?
text: The medic turns to his medicine bag. Cops swarm around
text: them. Helen sits down next to M.J. M.J. begins to put on
text: her shirt, wincing at the movement. Helen helps her.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: (it hurts)
dialog: Oh, God.
text: SAKS AND QUINN EMERGE THROUGH THE CHIAROSCURO OF SMOKE AND
text: LIGHT AND SHADOW. When M.J. sees him she takes out her gun
text: and hands it to him. It is what he expects, but she
text: misunderstands -- she is offering it to him as her
text: resignation from the cops. He takes it only as a part of
text: officer related shooting routine. SHE LOOKS INTO HIS FACE
text: AS HE SMELLS THE MUZZLE, KNOWS SHE FIRES IT, APPROVED.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: I'll take it, kid. You take two
dialog: weeks paid leave. Don't waste a
dialog: second thinking about that shitbag.
dialog: Then come back. You're a cop, M.J.
text: He nods to Helen...
speaker_heading: QUINN (cont'd)
dialog: Get the civilians outta here.
dialog: M.J.
text: She's in no shape to give her
dialog: statement tonight...
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: No, she can come in tomorrow...
dialog: gonna want to know a lot of
dialog: things...
text: B.G. the cops have pulled PETER'S BODY BY THE FEET, LETTING
text: HIM BUMPITY BUMPITY BUMPITY DOWN THE STEPS from the stage
text: and lifted him onto a gurney. The body is wheeled past
dialog: them, as...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: The only one who could tell you
dialog: what you really need to know is
dialog: dead.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: Yeah, it's a thought...
text: Of no importance to him, he turns away...
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
text: In the LOBBY area between the auditorium proper and the big
text: exterior doors (now the worse for wear from the concussion
text: grenades). Outside, through the glass we SEE a media circus
text: under the BRIGHT LIGHTS put up for the assault. M.J. and
text: HELEN SQUINT AGAINST THE LIGHT, AND TURN...
speaker_heading: THE AUDITORIUM (POV).
text: The cops and technicians are working away; at one side is a
text: small door -- easy escape. They run toward it...
scene_heading: EXT. MCCLUSKEY AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
text: It is dark where they step out into the night. Around the
text: corner of the building we see the light from the MEDIA
text: CIRCUS. THEN HELEN STEPS OFF DOWN INTO THE DARK CAMPUS.
text: M.J. LOOKS AT HER: REALIZING: HELEN IS NO LONGER AFRAID.
text: SHE CATCHES UP TO HER. HOLD ON THEIR BACKS AS THEY WALK
text: AWAY...
dialog: M.J.
dialog: You could use a long hot bath, you
dialog: know that? You better get somebody
dialog: to drive you home.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Why can't I drive home? I will.
dialog: You. Look at you. You need a ride
dialog: home. And you don't even know it.
dialog: M.J.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Well, thanks.
text: The two women continue down toward Helen's car, just outside
text: the circle of media. CAMERA RISES AND RISES TO A HIGH FULL
speaker_heading: SHOT.
text: THE MOUTH AND THE HAIRCUT spot them and race toward them.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Hey! Halloran! What's the story
dialog: here?
text: On the two women getting in the car...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: If she has to ask, she's never
dialog: gonna know.
text: HIGH FULLSHOT OF THE CAMPUS AS THEY DRIVE AWAY INTO THE
speaker_heading: NIGHT.
speaker_heading: THE END
