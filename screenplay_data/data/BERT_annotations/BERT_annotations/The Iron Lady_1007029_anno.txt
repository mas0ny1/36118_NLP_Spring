dialog: Or take in paying guests!
text: He scoops up the newspaper and glances towards the door -
speaker_heading: DENIS (CONT'D)
text: Watch out. She’s on the prowl.

speaker_heading: MARGARET
speaker_heading: (to DENIS)
dialog: Eat your egg.

speaker_heading: MARGARET

scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY.
scene_heading: WHISPERING-—
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I don’t understand how it
dialog: happened, how could she possibly
dialog: have got out? It’s very very
dialog: important -
text: MARGARET looks out of the kitchen. Her POV down the

speaker_heading: JUNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Please just make it really clear.

scene_heading: INT.HALL. CHESTER SQUARE. DAY.

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DAY.

text: MARGARET’s eyes move back along the rail in front of her,
text: her fingers touch hanger after hanger of brown tweed and
dialog: grey twill.
text: JUNE goes over to the curtains, pulling them back,
dialog: letting in the sunlight-
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Beautiful day. Oh, you’ve made a
dialog: start. Carol’s coming soon, I'll
dialog: get some bags. Anything you want
dialog: to go to Mark, I'll bring up a
dialog: suitcase for it.
text: The smell of smoke lingering. Suddenly DENIS’ hand
text: reaches across, wavering between jackets of brown tweed
dialog: and grey twill-
text: He reaches for a suit.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: No no no no. The grey.
speaker_heading: DENIS (0.S)
dialog: You sure?

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes.
dialog: Distant footsteps-
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: ..-Definitely the grey.
text: JUNE returns, oblivious-—
speaker_heading: DENIS (0.S)
dialog: Righty ho. Boss knows best.
text: JUNE spies the newspaper, sees the photos of twisted

speaker_heading: DENIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t let her take my paper away.
text: JUNE reaches one hand out to scoop it up in passing-
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh, I haven’t had a chance to look
dialog: at that yet, dear.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Sorry.
text: JUNE hesitates, leaves the newspaper resting on the bed
text: as she heads off with the suit on a hanger.
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: Atta-girl.
text: DENIS smiles as he stands in the bathroom doorway,
text: soaping his face with shaving cream-
text: He hums to himself as he resumes shaving until-
speaker_heading: DENIS (0.8) (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn.
text: MARGARET looks up, DENIS has nicked his chin-
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Blot it...Blot it..

speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Sorry ?
scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
text: A comfortable drawing room, filled with the photographs
text: and memorabilia of a former political life.
text: MARGARET stands by the window, half a dozen of DENIS’
text: ties in her hand. Pulling back the net curtain, MARGARET
dialog: peers out-—
text: Two POLICEMAN stand down below next to a Police BMW car.
text: They are lost in conversation, pointing to the door,
text: clearly concerned.
text: One POLICE MAN nods to the other, a sense of the changing
text: of the guard as he drives off in the BMW.
text: SUDDENLY from behind-
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: Now look what you’ve done. Are
dialog: they to keep the loonies out or
dialog: you in?
text: MARGARET eyes DENIS, looking at her with wry smile -
speaker_heading: DENIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ll be off then.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Wear your scarf. There’s a chill
dialog: out there.
text: Suddenly looming over her and grinning down as if at the
text: top of a tunnel SUSIE, MARGARET’s personal secretary
text: carrying a cardboard box.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Good morning Lady Thatcher. Are
dialog: you alright ?
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: How are you feeling ?
speaker_heading: MARGARET

speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: I’ve just been reading about the

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes. Frightful.
text: SUSIE’s mobile goes off. She fumbles in her bag to
dialog: switch it off.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: SUSIE (CONT'D)
dialog: These are the books for you to
dialog: sign. I brought as many as I could
dialog: find. Shall we go through your

text: MARGARET looks at her still nonplussed.
speaker_heading: SUSIE (CONT'D)
dialog: We said we’d go through them
dialog: today.
dialog: MARGARET nods-
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes, of course, dear. Today.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: The invitation has come from

dialog: of your portrait. I’1l put it on
dialog: the mantelpiece, and there’s an
dialog: invitation from Lord Armstrong for
dialog: lunch on the first Friday of next
dialog: month.
text: The murmur of SUSIE’s voice, a kind of white noise-
speaker_heading: SUSIE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I said no because you've got a
dialog: concert that afternoon but if
dialog: you'd like to..?
speaker_heading: SILENCE-
speaker_heading: SUSIE(O.S) (CONT'D)
dialog: .+.-It looks like a very
dialog: interesting programme.
text: MARGARET’s listens, oddly distracted-
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What are they playing?

scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
text: Whilst SUSIE shuffles through the arrangements at the
text: desk in the background, MARGARET stands at the window.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Silly man.
text: MARGARET’s gaze, seeing DENIS just visible in the street
text: below. He looks up, smiles,
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
text: He hasn’t got his scarf on.
text: MARGARET throws DENIS a half wave. In return, he twirls
text: his umbrella and does a couple of steps of a Chaplin walk
text: for her benefit before passing the Postman who is
text: shuffling through his letters as he approaches the front
dialog: step, below.
text: SUSIE looks on with quiet concern.
scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
text: MARGARET’ is at her desk signing a stack of her memoirs,
dialog: The Downing Street Years.
text: MARGARET opens one, reaching for a pen. The curve of inky
text: handwriting as she begins to sign them, Margaret
dialog: Thatcher.
text: Close on the swoop of the pen. Without missing a beat,
dialog: she writes the name Margaret Roberts...
text: The insistent blare of an air raid siren from another
dialog: time cuts through -
scene_heading: INT. BACK PARLOUR. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DUSK.

speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Did someone cover the butter?
text: All look at one another in a panic.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I‘l1l go.
text: Suddenly MARGARET scrabbles out from under the table, all
dialog: look on with horror-
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: Leave it.
speaker_heading: ALFRED (CALLING AFTER)
dialog: Margaret—
scene_heading: INT. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DUSK.
text: MARGARET scooping up the butter cover slamming it quickly

text: SUDDENLY the shop illuminates- A DISTANT EXPLOSION.
text: MARGARET momentarily paralyzed before, running back
text: towards the back parlour to resume her place under the
dialog: table.
scene_heading: INT. BACK PARLOUR. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DUSK.

speaker_heading: BEATRICE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: CUPS!
text: MARGARET sinks a little, taking the tray, and glances
text: back at ALFRED just visible on a stage.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: We on this island are strong.
dialog: We're self-reliant. Sometimes
dialog: we're plain bloody minded.
text: NOW AT THE BACK OF THE HALL, holding a tray loaded with
text: dirty cups, MARGARET watches her father, back turned to
text: the kitchen filled with WOMEN and YOUNG GIRLS making tea
text: and washing up cups.
speaker_heading: ALFRED (CONT'D)
dialog: But we also believe in helping
dialog: each other. And I don’t mean by

scene_heading: EXT. STREET. GRANTHAM. 1943. DAY.

scene_heading: PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN 1
dialog: Margaret, do you want to come to
dialog: the pictures?

speaker_heading: ALFRED OOV
dialog: (close to)
dialog: Open it then.
scene_heading: INT. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DAY.
text: Close on a telegram addressed to MARGARET ROBERTS, 1-3

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (calling out)

speaker_heading: BEATRICE

speaker_heading: BEATRICE

speaker_heading: BEATRICE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: CUPS!
speaker_heading: PRESENT -
text: MARGARET stirs again, blinking awake.
text: DENIS sits by the window. He is bent over a pair of

text: Margaret’s couch.
dialog: 12
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: (without taking his

text: MARGARET considers DENIS now wearing a pink turban and
text: confronts the extraordinary head-gear.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What have you got on your head?
text: DENIS smiles, throwing back his head, the swathe of pink
text: fabric from his turban hanging down ridiculously-
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: Found it in the cupboard and
dialog: thought bugger it, it’s Friday,
dialog: why not fancy dress?
text: MARGARET sits drinking her tea, JUNE’s hushed tones
text: almost audible.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You look ridiculous.
text: MARGARET strains to hear-
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: Bosslady no like?
text: She makes a shushing motion.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (as if to a bad dog)
dialog: No, Denis, Bosslady no like.
text: MARGARET resumes listening. The door ajar, the sounds of
dialog: life just audible outside-
speaker_heading: JUNE (0.8)
dialog: It’s taken Carol so long to get
dialog: her to agree to this. She’s been
text: so reluctant to let his things go.
text: DENIS sinks onto the bed, bored.
dialog: 13
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (without looking)
dialog: Feet.
text: He tuts and adjusts his legs so that his shoes don’t

speaker_heading: JUNE (0.8)
dialog: You can never be sure she’s taking
dialog: her medication...I think sometimes
text: she hides them..
speaker_heading: DENIS VO
dialog: Oh, rumbled!
text: MARGARET looks back at her cup of tea, spots two pills

speaker_heading: GREY SUITED MAN
dialog: Ah, Miss Roberts. Hoping to be
dialog: chosen as our candidate for

text: A young MARGARET [24yrs] stylish in a suit, straight from
text: work, stands clutching her handbag, oddly out of place
text: amidst the neat 50’s chintz. A bank of sporting prints
text: collage a wall. A bespectacled YOUNG DENIS THATCHER

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Well I don’t like coalitions,

text: MARGARET’s POV of her fingers absently grazing a

speaker_heading: DENIS VO
dialog: Start on the outside...
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM. HOUSE. DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING.

speaker_heading: DENIS VO
dialog: .--and work your way in.
text: A long table packed with silverware. She looks back at

text: savoury confection in aspic.
dialog: 20
speaker_heading: PORTLY HOST
text: ...-Attlee has his sights set on
dialog: the steel industry, you mark my
dialog: words.
speaker_heading: GREY SUITED MAN
dialog: They’1l be nationalizing the
text: bloody air next.
speaker_heading: MALE GUEST
dialog: Yes, hold your breath, sir, that’s
dialog: government property!
speaker_heading: PORTLY HOST
dialog: So was your father a political
dialog: man, too, Miss Roberts?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh, yes, to his core. And Mayor of
dialog: Grantham.
speaker_heading: PORTLY HOST
dialog: And a grocer as well!
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes.
text: Ears prick up around the table. The Host is lost for
dialog: something to say.
speaker_heading: HOSTESS
dialog: And did you help, err, in
dialog: the...shop?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh, yes. It was a family business.
speaker_heading: GREY SUITED MAN
dialog: A very good starting point for the
dialog: political life, I’m sure.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: That and a degree from Oxford.
text: The put-down, though not intentional, causes Denis to
dialog: smile.
text: MARGARET catches the smile. She remains unruffled and
text: goes back to her food, picking up a knife and fork,
text: working her way in, teasing her hors d’oeuvres.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE.LONDON.PRESENT.EVENING.
text: MARGARET sits oddly removed, hand instinctively covering
text: her wine glass, as a WINE WAITER hovers.

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (hushed aside to
speaker_heading: WAITER)
dialog: Whisky.
text: The MURMUR of conversation all around-
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM. HOUSE. DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING.
dialog: 
text: Pudding is on the go and Margaret is warming to her
dialog: theme.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What I do think is that a man
dialog: should be encouraged to stand on
dialog: his own two feet. Yes we help
dialog: people of course we help people.
dialog: But for those that can do, they
dialog: must just get up and do. And if
dialog: something's wrong, they shouldn't
dialog: just whine about it, they should
dialog: get in there and DO something
dialog: about it, change things.
text: The female guests exchange glances. A half-chuckle from
dialog: someone.
speaker_heading: PORTLY HOST
dialog: With all due respect, Miss
dialog: Roberts, what may have served in
dialog: Grantham-
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Can serve very well for the people
dialog: of Dartford too.
speaker_heading: MALE GUEST
dialog: Really?
text: A general sense of quiet incredulity.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I know much more than those who
dialog: have never lived on a limited
dialog: income. Just like the man or woman
dialog: on the street, when I am short one
dialog: week, I have to make economies the
dialog: next.
speaker_heading: GREY SUITED MAN
dialog: Nothing like a slice of fiscal
dialog: responsibility.
dialog: 22
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: A man might call it fiscal
dialog: responsibility, a woman might call
dialog: it good housekeeping.
speaker_heading: MALE GUEST
dialog: I’m not sure a home economics
dialog: lesson is quite what the Dartford
dialog: constituents need. They see
dialog: industry being nationalized, the
dialog: unions on the up, the pound on the
dialog: slide...whoever can sort that lot
dialog: out - he’s my man.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Or woman?
text: Denis lets out a spontaneous guffaw as the host and
text: hostess exchange looks. He signals ‘Get them out of
text: here’. The men rise.
speaker_heading: HOSTESS
dialog: Ladies shall we ?
speaker_heading: PORTLY HOST
dialog: Miss Roberts, do join the ladies.
text: The ladies scurry to the sitting room. Margaret is the
dialog: last to leave.
scene_heading: INT. SITTING ROOM. DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING.
text: As Margaret closes the door to the dining room -
speaker_heading: PORTLY HOST (0.S.)
dialog: Well. That’s told us!

dialog: suspicion.
scene_heading: INT.DINING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.
speaker_heading: EVENING.
text: The aftermath of the muted dinner party-
text: MARGARET at the helm, a small whisky just visible nestled
text: next to her wine glass. She is flushed and nicely mellow
text: surrounded by mainly MALE GUESTS-
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: So, Margaret, how would you have
dialog: dealt with this if you’d been
dialog: Prime Minister?
dialog: 23
text: MARGARET looks at him, her flicker of bemusement.
text: .-.Slowly registering across the faces of her FRIENDS and
text: COLLEAGUES including CAROL.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: The bombings, mummy. Today?
speaker_heading: MARGARET still lost
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: We were just talking about them?
text: MARGARET deflects, reaching for her glass, it trembles
text: unsteady in her grasp.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: No, uhm, yes - we have always
dialog: lived alongside evil. But it has
dialog: never been so patient, so avid for
text: carnage, so eager to carry
text: innocents with it into oblivion.
speaker_heading: MALE GUEST
dialog: So, would you -
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Western civilization must root out
dialog: this evil, wherever it hides, or
text: she risks defeat at the hands of
dialog: global terror in a nuclear age.
dialog: Unimaginable!
text: Appreciative murmur of agreements amongst the listening
dialog: party-
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: The Prime Minister gave a very
dialog: good statement I thought.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes. Clever man. Quite a smoothie.
dialog: Laughter-

speaker_heading: NIGHT.

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You don’t mind if I sit down...
dialog: 24
text: Sitting down on a nearby chair, MARGARET looks with
text: feigned recollection at the FEMALE GUEST as she sinks
text: down on the ground in front of her, gripping MARGARET’s
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: FEMALE GUEST
dialog: I heard you speak at conference in
dialog: 1984 in Brighton just after the
dialog: IRA bombed the Grand Hotel. You
dialog: were remarkable. I hope you
dialog: appreciate what an inspiration you
dialog: have been for women like myself.
text: MARGARET hesitates, smiles, nods to herself, considering-
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It used to be about trying to do
dialog: something. Now its about trying to
dialog: be someone.
text: The FEMALE GUEST nods and scrambled to her feet, clearly
text: concerned, shooting a look to her HUSBAND standing beside
text: her, waiting to depart.
speaker_heading: FEMALE GUEST
dialog: Well anyway, I...thank you.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Good night to you.
text: MARGARET sits alone. In the background, the chatter of
text: Carol saying final farewells.
speaker_heading: CAROL (0.S.)
dialog: Great to see you, thank you very
dialog: much for coming.
speaker_heading: MALE GUEST (0.S.)
dialog: Oh, thank you. It was lovely,

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: OK...hold on to me...that’s right.
text: MARGARET struggles with the catch on her pearls
dialog: 25
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Can you do the clasp, I can’t
dialog: quite -
text: CAROL hurries to help her, MARGARET quietly concedes.
text: Fingers fumble to unclasp the pearls-—
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you.
text: CAROL drops the pearls into a jewelry box, close to
text: MARGARET, staring back at their reflections.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You’ve got an eyelash.
text: CAROL catches the stray eyelash on the tip of her finger,
text: holding it close to MARGARET, with a smile-
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Make a wish.
text: MARGARET, closes her eyes until-
text: MARGARET blows. She opens them smiles. CAROL smiles.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: I spoke to Doctor Michael today-
text: MARGARET glances away, deflecting.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: He is very good and very expensive-
text: MARGARET ignores her-
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: ...I know you’re not due to see
dialog: him for another month but I’ve
dialog: spoken to him and he can fit you
dialog: in tomorrow.
speaker_heading: SILENCE-
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Just for a check up.
dialog: (silence)
dialog: Ma please-
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What does Mark think about it?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Mark?
dialog: 26
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes. Tell him to come up. I want
dialog: to talk to him about it.
text: CAROL, hesitates, with concern-
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Mark's with Sarah and the
dialog: children.
text: MARGARET nods, heading through into the bathroom.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Well tell him to come up and see
dialog: me after he’s kissed them good
dialog: night, would you Carol darling?
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. NIGHT.
text: MARGARET, sitting on her bed, glances expectantly towards

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: He’s not here Mummy.
text: MARGARET hesitates, CAROL using all her might, not to
text: crumble under MARGARET’s cool gaze-
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Mark lives in South Africa...
text: MARGARET inwardly flinches.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: «..you are not Prime Minister
dialog: anymore and Dad is...Dad is dead-
dialog: Silence-
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You look exhausted, dear. You

text: MARGARET’s FINGERS absently grazing over the programme,
dialog: in time with the music-
text: SUDDENLY a closed fist reaches out, then opens to reveal

text: She turns to smile at DENIS, her face is glowing with
dialog: happiness-
scene_heading: INT. TOWN HALL 1950. NIGHT.
text: MARGARET sits on the edge of a trestle table, scrunching
text: a rosette in her hand. The Town Hall is empty save for a

speaker_heading: RADIO ANNOUNCER
dialog: Twenty-four-year-old Miss Margaret
dialog: Roberts lost her bid to win a seat

dialog: watch out, this bright young woman
text: is on his tail.
text: DENIS appears in the doorway, carrying fish and chips. He
text: slides them down in front of her.
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: Eat!
text: MARGARET almost smiles. Then sinks once more into misery.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Disaster.
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: Hang on...Hang on...Hang on...
text: DENIS fishes in his pocket pulling out a hip flask. An
text: impromptu supper made. MARGARET takes in the aftermath of
text: rosettes, the whiff of defeat all around.
speaker_heading: DENIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You shaved thousands off their
dialog: majority. You did splendidly.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Not splendidly enough.
dialog: 28
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: Ah I see. Self pity.
text: MARGARET eyes him, mid chip-
speaker_heading: DENIS (CONT'D)
dialog: No one is saying you don’t need a
dialog: safe seat. You deserve a safe
dialog: seat. But it does not come unless
dialog: you learn to play the game a
dialog: little.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What game?
text: She is fuming but he regroups with a big breath.
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: You are a grocer’s daughter-
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (fiercely)
dialog: -And proud of being-
text: He grabs her hand, silencing her.
speaker_heading: DENIS
text: - in their eyes. A single grocer's
dialog: daughter. But if you were to
dialog: become the wife of a moderately
dialog: successful businessman-
text: For the first time, we see MARGARET taken by surprise.
speaker_heading: DENIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You’d get to parliament, and I'd
dialog: get to be the happiest man in- in
dialog: wherever they select you.
speaker_heading: (SILENCE)
dialog: Margaret, will you marry me?
text: She is genuinely stunned.
speaker_heading: DENIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Well ?
text: She is frozen. Then she begins to smile and nod her head
dialog: and smile.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes. Yes!
text: He leans over and kisses her, long and passionately until-
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: What ?
dialog: 29
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I love you so much but...I will
dialog: never be one of those women Denis -
text: who stays silent and pretty on the
text: arm of her husband. Or remote and
text: alone in the kitchen doing the
dialog: washing up for that matter.
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: (trying to retain the
dialog: moment )
dialog: We'll get a help for that.
text: He leans forward to kiss her again but she pulls away a
dialog: little.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: No - one’s life must matter,
dialog: Denis. Beyond the cooking and the
dialog: cleaning and the children, one’s
dialog: life must mean more than that - I
text: cannot die washing up a tea cup.
text: He sits up and stares as if seeing her for the first
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean it Denis, say you
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: That’s why I want to marry you, my
dialog: dear.
text: She kisses him.
text: A CHINK of a TEACUP-
text: They pull apart. FLUSHED and GIGGLING on seeing-
text: A LONE WOMAN enters the hall, cleaning up the last of the
text: tea cups, and generally tidying.
speaker_heading: DENIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Now eat.
text: MARGARET smiles her joy at him as ‘SHALL WE DANCE’

text: And now she’s in his arms as they dance, swirling through

text: and GREY SUITED MEN, almost at first glance
text: indistinguishable, with PRIME MINISTER EDWARD HEATH (late

dialog: bench.
text: MARGARET, her speech and papers in her hand is fighting
text: hard but the OPPOSITION LABOUR BENCHES scent blood - and
text: they literally bray, getting to their feet and shaking
text: their order papers in her face.
text: The SPEAKER tries to control the chamber but his VOICE is
text: almost lost in the bedlam.
dialog: 34
speaker_heading: SPEAKER
dialog: The Right Honourable Lady the
dialog: Secretary of State for Education.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: The right honourable gentleman
dialog: knows that we have no choice but
dialog: to shut down the schools!
text: Cries of ‘Shame!’ From the opposition. The chamber
text: reduced to a bear-pit. HEATH glum and offering no help to
text: MARGARET whose voice becomes increasingly shrill.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: Because his union paymasters have
dialog: called a strike deliberately to
dialog: cripple our economy. Teachers
dialog: cannot teach when there is no
dialog: heating, no lighting in their
dialog: classrooms. And I ask the
dialog: honourable gentleman, whose fault
dialog: is that?
speaker_heading: SHADOW MINISTER
dialog: Methinks the Right Honourable lady
dialog: doth screech to much. If she wants
dialog: us to take her seriously she must
dialog: learn to calm down!
text: The OPPOSITION BENCHES love that, rocking in their seats,
dialog: laughing... falsely of course.
text: But MARGARET is aware that there are many MEN behind her,
text: on the government benches, who are also sniggering in
dialog: agreement.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: If the right honorable gentleman
dialog: could perhaps attend more closely
dialog: to WHAT I am saying, rather than
dialog: HOW I am saying it, he may receive
dialog: a valuable education in spite of
dialog: himself!
text: Her opposite number Shadow Minister looks almost smug:
text: smiling, pointing a finger at her.
speaker_heading: SHADOW MINISTER
dialog: Why has this Conservative
dialog: government failed? Why has it
dialog: forced so many in the public
dialog: sector into taking strike action
dialog: to save their own jobs?

scene_heading: SHADOW MINISTER VO
dialog: Minister, the breakdown of

speaker_heading: HEATH (CONT'D)
dialog: The miners are asking for a 35%

dialog: unions are not our enemies and
dialog: never have been. We want - and
dialog: have always wanted - the broadest

speaker_heading: HEATH
dialog: - the fact of the matter is, it’s
dialog: absolutely crucial that we are

dialog: (Finally
dialog: acknowledging
dialog: Margaret)
dialog: Yes, Education Secretary.

speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: Prime Minister, with the Miners’

speaker_heading: HEATH (CONT'D)

text: A snigger, then the lights flicker back on.
speaker_heading: HEATH (CONT'D)
dialog: Your thoughts are duly noted.

text: The crowd of men applaud. The lone woman in their midst,
text: YOUNG MARGARET watches her father, face aglow.
speaker_heading: ALFRED (CONT'D)
dialog: We Conservatives believe in giving
dialog: people the freedom and opportunity
dialog: to fulfil their own potential,
dialog: especially the young. There’s no
dialog: good in pretending we’re all
dialog: equal, we’re not all the same,
dialog: never have been, never will be. We

scene_heading: VOICE ON THE RADIO
dialog: It’s 1974 and you’d think it was

dialog: mess. Heath should resign now and
dialog: make way for someone who’s not

dialog: any lessons. Ridiculous isn’t it?
dialog: Maybe third time lucky.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Right. The only thing you should

dialog: often both.

speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MARGARET

speaker_heading: CAROL

speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: So sorry! Terribly sorry!
text: MARGARET throws a wave from the wound down window. The
text: CYCLIST swerves on recognizing her, watching as the car

speaker_heading: DENIS

speaker_heading: CAROL

speaker_heading: MARGARET

dialog: It's her driving test this

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh, right. Of course.
text: A BEAT.
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: Are you saying you want to be

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (with false patience)
dialog: What I’m saying is that someone

dialog: unsayable. None of these men have
dialog: the guts.
text: MARGARET sees the burnt toast and energetically starts
text: clearing up and putting more bread under the grill.
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: The Prime Minister has been very
dialog: loyal to you, MT.
text: He tries, with a trembling hand, to scoop boiled eggs
text: from the pan.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
text: But he’s weak, and he’s weakened
dialog: the party. One must know when to
dialog: go.
dialog: (glancing at him)
dialog: You're shaking.
text: She reaches out.
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: I can do it!
text: DENIS pulls his arm away, sending boiled eggs flying.
speaker_heading: SILENCE.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Goodness me! What is the matter
dialog: with everyone this morning?
text: A beat. He looks utterly fragile.
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: I’ve told you what the matter is.
dialog: The business is a bit rocky at the
dialog: moment and the Doctor thinks I
dialog: need a rest.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: And do you need a rest?
dialog: 41
text: It’s almost challenging. He doesn’t answer and she
text: doesn’t notice.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: We both know that it’s highly
dialog: unlikely that I would ever be
dialog: elected leader, I’1l never be
dialog: elected leader. But I will run. I
dialog: will run. Just to nip at their
dialog: heels and make them reaffirm the

dialog: There’s so much to do.
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: (sotto voce)
dialog: You're insufferable, Margaret, do

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Denis, you married someone who is
dialog: committed to public service, you
dialog: knew that. And it is my duty -
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: Don’t call it duty. It’s ambition
dialog: which has got you this far.
dialog: Ambition. And the rest of us, me,

speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER (CONT'D)
dialog: What was it you took away from
dialog: that visit which may be of value
dialog: here in Great Britain?
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO. LONDON. 1975. NIGHT
text: MARGARET perched on a chair, smiling at the TV
scene_heading: INTERVIEWER -
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh that’s rather easy to answer,
dialog: actually. They are unafraid of
dialog: success.
scene_heading: INT. REECE’S OFFICE. LONDON. 1975. DAY
text: MARGARET is watching the same interview on a TV monitor.
text: She is watching herself intently, as are REECE and AIREY
text: NEAVE. They are polar opposites, REECE flamboyant to
text: NEAVE’s bluff.
dialog: 43
text: She sounds very plummy, like a Conservative party wife
text: from the shires. And she wears a hat.
scene_heading: MARGARET ON TELEVISION
dialog: We in Great Britain and in Europe
dialog: are formed mainly by our history.
dialog: They on the other hand are formed
dialog: by their philosophy. Not by what
dialog: has been, but by what can be. Oh,
dialog: we have a great deal that we can
dialog: learn from them, yes. Oh yes!
text: MARGARET is trapped in the moment - but the two men
text: exchange a glance. NEAVE freezes the picture. MARGARET
text: smiles uneasily, like someone expecting a compliment.
text: REECE considers her, long and hard. It is a little
dialog: unsettling until-
speaker_heading: REECE
dialog: Well er...For a start, that hat
dialog: has got to go. And the pearls. In
dialog: fact I think all hats may have to
dialog: go. You look and sound like a
dialog: privileged Conservative wife and
dialog: we've already got her vote. You’ve
dialog: got lovely hair but we need to do
dialog: something with it - to make it
dialog: more-
speaker_heading: AIREY NEAVE
dialog: Important.
speaker_heading: REECE
dialog: Yes. Give it more impact. But the
dialog: main thing is your voice. Its too
dialog: high. It has no authority.
speaker_heading: AIREY NEAVE
dialog: Methinks the Lady doth screech too
dialog: much
speaker_heading: REECE
dialog: People don’t want to be harangued
text: by a woman or hectored. Persuaded
dialog: yes. That ‘oh yes’ at the end of
dialog: the interview, that’s
dialog: authoritative, that’s the voice of
dialog: a leader.
text: MARGARET stares at him.
dialog: 44
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It’s all very well to talk about
dialog: changing my voice, Mr Reece, but
dialog: for some of my colleagues to
dialog: imagine me as their leader would
dialog: be like imagining, I don’t know,
text: being led into battle by their
dialog: chambermaid. It’s my background,
dialog: and my sex. No matter how I’ve
dialog: tried, and I have tried, to fit
dialog: in, I will never be truly one of
dialog: them.
text: Both REECE and NEAVE are aware that she has spoken very
text: nakedly - and is thus extremely vulnerable.
speaker_heading: REECE
dialog: If I may say so - I think that’s
dialog: your trump card. You’re flying in
dialog: the face of everything the Tories
dialog: have been thus far. It’s really
dialog: very exciting. One simply has to
dialog: maximise your appeal, bring out
dialog: all your qualities and make you
dialog: look, and sound, like the leader
dialog: that you could be.
speaker_heading: NEAVE
dialog: You’ve got it in you to go the
dialog: whole distance.
speaker_heading: REECE
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Prime Minister?! Oh no. Oh no no
dialog: no. In Britain? There will be no
dialog: female Prime Minister here, not in
dialog: my lifetime. No. And I told Airey,
dialog: I don’t expect to win the
dialog: leadership, but I am going to run.
dialog: Just to shake up the party.
dialog: NEAVE moves in intently-
speaker_heading: NEAVE
dialog: Respectfully, Margaret, I
dialog: disagree. If you want to change
dialog: this party, lead it. If you want
dialog: to change the country, lead it.
dialog: What we're talking about here
dialog: today is surface. What’s crucial
dialog: is that you hold your course, and
dialog: stay true to who you are. Never be
dialog: anything other than yourself.
text: MARGARET, though flattered, looks sceptical.
dialog: 45
speaker_heading: REECE
dialog: Leave us to do the rest.
speaker_heading: A BEAT
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Gentlemen, I am in your hands. I
dialog: may be persuaded to surrender the
dialog: hat. But the pearls were a gift
dialog: from my husband on the birth of
dialog: our twins and they are absolutely
dialog: non-negotiable.

dialog: Maaaaaaaaaaaa.
scene_heading: THEATRICAL VOICE COACH
dialog: Good, I think we can loose the

dialog: the sides...Because this isn’t
dialog: really about the voice, it’s about

scene_heading: THEATRICAL VOICE COACH
dialog: That's right, one more time, deep

dialog: What? What am I ‘bound to be

speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: People don’t ‘think’ any more.
dialog: They ‘feel’. ‘How are you
dialog: feeling?’ ‘Oh I don’t feel
dialog: comfortable with that’ ‘Oh, I’m so
dialog: sorry but we, the group were
dialog: feeling...’ D’you know, one of the
dialog: great problems of our age is that

speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: What are you thinking, Margaret?
text: MARGARET looks at the DOCTOR, quietly struggling with a

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Watch your thoughts, for they
dialog: become words. Watch your words,
dialog: for they become actions. Watch
dialog: your actions, for they become
dialog: habits. Watch your habits, for
dialog: they become your character. And
dialog: watch your character, for it
dialog: becomes your destiny. What we

dialog: said that.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And I think I am fine.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But I do so appreciate your kind

text: The sudden and persistent buzz of an intercom-
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, do please answer that.

speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I’'ll give Carol a quick ring, let

text: MARGARET nods. Looking through the bannisters, her eyes
dialog: fall on-
text: A golf ball running along the floor. MARGARET considers,

speaker_heading: DENNIS OOV
dialog: Steady, steady, steady! Damn.
dialog: Fore!

speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: What about that medicine man, eh?
dialog: Ah. Cold supper. Standards are

text: MARGARET ignores DENIS taking out the plate unwrapping

speaker_heading: DENIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Well you really gave it to that
dialog: quack didn’t you, darling ? Just
dialog: like the old days! Hallucinations

speaker_heading: DENIS (CONT'D)
dialog: How dare he?
text: DENIS smiles.

speaker_heading: DENIS (CONT'D)
dialog: But then you give us all the run

scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DUSK.

speaker_heading: MARGARET

speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: June! Bingo. Knew you'd get there

scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DUSK.

dialog: the TV-
speaker_heading: BBC VOICEOVER
dialog: Baroness Thatcher made an
dialog: apparently routine visit to her

text: MARGARET turns up the volume to full, trying to hear over

speaker_heading: FOOT (CONT'D)
dialog: The biggest fall in total output

speaker_heading: HESELTINE
dialog: May we have a word, Prime

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes, but in order to arrive at the
dialog: palace on time, Geoffrey and I are
dialog: will be walking out of that door
dialog: in 15 minutes. As you can see -
speaker_heading: HESELTINE
dialog: I know you’re running late
dialog: Margaret, but we have to address
dialog: this situation in light of
dialog: tomorrow’s blistering press
dialog: coverage. Blistering! The knives
dialog: are out. Your draft budget’s been

speaker_heading: HOWE
dialog: Michael we can’t possibly buckle

text: The SCRATCH of PRIOR’s hand on unkempt hair-
speaker_heading: HESELTINE
dialog: No one is saying we have to

speaker_heading: PRIOR
dialog: But is this really the time to

dialog: middle of one of the deepest

dialog: experienced?
speaker_heading: HESTLETINE
dialog: We need a plan of action,

speaker_heading: PYM

speaker_heading: GILMOUR

speaker_heading: PRIOR
dialog: Agreed.
text: MARGARET stiffens, the needle momentarily hovering mid

text: The SEAMSTRESS resumes sewing-
speaker_heading: PRIOR (CONT'D)
dialog: There’s a perception, Margaret
dialog: rightly or wrongly, that we are
text: now completely out of touch with
dialog: the country.
text: The patronizing tone inflames her.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Really.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: How much is a pack of Lurpak?
speaker_heading: PYM
dialog: Lurpak?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Butter, Francis.
dialog: (silence)
text: Forty two pence. Anchor butter is

text: Another MINISTER - GILMOUR - whispers the words:

dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: What - did you say?

speaker_heading: GILMOUR

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Don’t try to hide you opinions.

scene_heading: MOMENTARILY SILENT-

speaker_heading: GILMOUR
dialog: The manufacturing industry is

speaker_heading: PYM
dialog: Honest, hard-working, decent

dialog: It's terribly shameful.
speaker_heading: GILMOUR
dialog: The point is, Prime Minister, that
dialog: we must moderate the pace -—
speaker_heading: HESELTINE
dialog: - if we’re even to have a hope of
dialog: winning the next election-
speaker_heading: PYM
dialog: Quite right.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Ah. Worried about our careers, are

text: They make noises - to the effect that nothing could be
dialog: further from the truth.
text: But MARGARET has their measure.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: Gentlemen, if we don’t cut

dialog: the medicine is harsh but the

text: meeting slowly disbands and the MINISTERS move away.
speaker_heading: HOWE
dialog: You can’t close down a discussion
dialog: because it’s not what you wish to

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I don’t expect everyone just to

dialog: what kind of leader am I if I
dialog: don’t try to get my own way - to

speaker_heading: HOWE

text: MARGARET stands, watching the evening news.
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: Margaret, you can’t let them do
dialog: this to you. Please, boss.
text: MARGARET looks at DENIS, with quiet surprise, hears the
text: desperation in his voice, the crack-
speaker_heading: DENIS (CONT'D)
dialog: They’1l destroy you.
text: MARGARET looks at DENIS, sees he is near to tears-—
speaker_heading: DENIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Throw in the towel now, love.
dialog: Don’t let those bastards see you
dialog: humiliated. You just won’t win,
dialog: darling. Not this time.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh Denis.

text: steely under his gaze.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: I am the Prime Minister. 154
text: On her face as CASTA DIVA breaks through.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE OF COMMONS. DAY
text: MARGARET sits alone on the front bench. A stream of
dialog: voices from the past -
speaker_heading: SPEAKER (V.O.)
dialog: Order! Order!
speaker_heading: MARGARET (V.O.)
dialog: The Right Honourable gentleman is
dialog: afraid!
speaker_heading: NORTHERN VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: This is a naked strategy of
dialog: closing some coal mines and then
dialog: selling off -
dialog: 90
speaker_heading: MARGARET (V.O.)
dialog: They believe in striking, I
dialog: believe in working!
speaker_heading: IRISH VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: This is the woman who’s watched
dialog: ten men on hunger strike starve
dialog: themselves to death and never
dialog: flinched!
speaker_heading: MARGARET (V.O.)
dialog: Despicable and cowardly -
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Cynical Falklands war -
speaker_heading: MINISTER (V.O.)
dialog: More homeowners, more
dialog: shareholders, more savings -

dialog: years -
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1990. DAY.
text: MARGARET descends the stairs like an operatic heroine,
text: her hand gripping the banister of the staircase. Below
text: the Downing St staff waiting to say goodbye. Many are in
dialog: tears.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: -proud to have left Britain ina
dialog: much better state than when we
dialog: took office.
text: She passes the photographs of her predecessors and stops
dialog: to receive a gift, opening it-
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: What's this then? A radio... How
dialog: useful.
text: She moves down the receiving line of staff. The floor is
text: carpeted with roses. Men’s wet eyes. The door ahead. She
text: is crying.
dialog: 91
text: Finally reaching the door, MARGARET stands bracing
text: herself. Denis’s hand on her shoulder standing behind.
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: Steady, MT.
text: MARGARET nods, bracing herself. A hand on the door
text: handle. As it swings open-
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. NIGHT
text: MARGARET stands staring at herself in the mirror.
speaker_heading: DENIS (0.S.)
dialog: The greatest Prime Minister since
text: Churchill deposed by a bunch of
dialog: spineless pygmies!
speaker_heading: MARGARET VO
dialog: All those years of taking the
dialog: tough decisions, does any of it
dialog: matter now?
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: It’s all been turned to mush!
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What?
text: DENIS lies on the bed behind her with the newspaper.
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: By these fools! These lily-livered
dialog: pinkos!
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: These inept placators.
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: Very good! These vacillators.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Vacillators! Poll takers.
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: Popularity seekers.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: So busy taking the pulse of the
dialog: public!
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: Weak -
dialog: 92
speaker_heading: MARGARET
text: (pulling down a rack of Denis’s
text: black oxford shoes onto the floor)
dialog: These...weak...weak...weak...wea..
dialog: -weak...Men!
text: DENIS’s clothes are all over the room and the main
text: cupboard is open and empty apart from shoes. There are
text: several bin liners already filled with clothes.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t they know if you take the
dialog: tough decisions, yes people will
dialog: hate you today but they’1ll thank
dialog: you for generations.
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: Or forget you entirely and chuck
dialog: you out with the rubbish!
text: MARGARET turns away from this thought and opens a last
text: big chest of drawers.
speaker_heading: MARGARET V/O
dialog: (seizing shirts and
dialog: jerseys and putting
dialog: them on the floor)
dialog: All I wanted was to make a
dialog: difference in the world.
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: And you did, love, you did.
text: She sits at the end of her bed and opens a box she has
text: found in Denis’s cupboard. There is a programme from ‘The
text: King and I’ and a faded blue rosette from some long
text: forgotten election campaign. A small flyer ‘Margaret
dialog: Roberts. Conservative Candidate for Dartford’ and some
dialog: childrens cards “to the world’s greatest Daddy love Mark
dialog: and Carol.”
speaker_heading: MARGARET V/O
dialog: All I wanted was for my children
dialog: to grow up well and be happy -
dialog: happier than I was certainly. And
dialog: I wanted you to be happy of
dialog: course. Were you happy, Denis?
dialog: Tell me the truth.
text: There is no response. MARGARET is momentarily lost in the
dialog: room.
text: Then, seized by some compulsion, she begins to pull out
text: the rest of his clothes, shoving them into black bags.
text: As shirts and trousers go in, quick flashes of Denis -
dialog: 93
text: His youthful face, smiling at her at the opera.
text: Laughing on the beach in Cornwall.
text: At the door of Number 10, smiling at her.
text: Sharing her bed.
text: MARGARET looks up. Denis’s suitcase is on the bed. His
text: coat and hat lying beside it. She folds his dressing gown
text: - the one from the bathroom hook - tenderly and puts it
text: on the top of the case.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Denis? Denis?
text: And there he is by her side.
speaker_heading: MARGARET V/O
dialog: Here’s your bag. You’re all
dialog: packed, sorted.
text: She walks him to the bedroom door and gives him a gentle
text: kiss. DENIS starts to walk away.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
text: (seeing he is walking away in his
dialog: socks)
dialog: Denis wait...Where are your shoes?
dialog: You can’t go without shoes! Not
dialog: yet.
text: DENIS straightens his hat.
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: Steady.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes...Steady...
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: Steady the buffs -
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Steady...Steady the buffs...
text: DENIS heading out.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: 154d NO...Not yet...Denis. Wait...I 154d
dialog: said I don’t want you to go yet.
text: The endless corridor, MARGARET calling after DENIS-—
dialog: 94
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: Denis...Please...No...Not...Don’t.
dialog: .-NO...I don’t...I don’t want to
dialog: be on my own.
text: DENIS turns back for a moment -
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: You’re going to be fine on your
dialog: own, love.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You always have been.
text: MARGARET calling out as DENIS reaches the window at the
text: very far end of the house and appears to disappear into
dialog: the white light-
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Denis!!
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DAWN
text: From above we see MARGARET lying dead asleep on the bed
text: on a pile of DENIS’ clothes. The bed is surrounded by
text: bulging black bin bags.
speaker_heading: CAROL OOV
dialog: Mummy-
text: CAROL looming over Margaret, looking horrified.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: My God, Mum. Are you alright?
dialog: (opening the
dialog: curtains)
dialog: Mummy you should have called for
dialog: help, silly old sausage. Have you
dialog: not even been in your bed
dialog: properly? You’ve done all this?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes, all sorted. Finished.
text: MARGARET looks around her.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Yes well don’t worry about all

dialog: I was just going to get dressed.
dialog: 95
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: ..-Shall I call someone, see if
dialog: anyone can come over and do your
dialog: hair?
text: MARGARET looks at her warmly.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh. No, you do it.
text: CAROL reacts, surprised but pleased.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
dialog: 
text: MARGARET sit finishing a cup of tea. Hears Carol’s bustle
text: in the downstairs hallway.
speaker_heading: CAROL OOV
dialog: Right, I’m off June.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: OK. ‘Bye.
text: She stands, picking up the cup.
dialog: From behind-
speaker_heading: JUNE (0.S) (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh let me do that, Margaret.
text: MARGARET’s turns for a moment-—
text: It is JUNE. MARGARET shakes her head.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: No, dear, I’1l do it.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Carol said you might go to the
dialog: House of Lords today?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: No no. I’m not going anywhere.
text: The sound of hot water running. CHINK of a teacup-
text: MARGARET stands, washing up a tea cup.
text: The SQUEAK of her wet cloth, working on a stubborn tea
text: stain, puncturing the silence.
text: The sound of birdsong and children playing drifts from
text: the street outside.
text: MARGARET sets the cup aside, turns and walks out of the
text: room, and out of sight.
