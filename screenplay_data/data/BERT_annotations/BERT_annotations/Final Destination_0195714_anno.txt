text: On the rear wall, the Fighting Colonials pennant begins to flutter slightly, as if affected by the moving breeze. The path of which is continued toward the bed, rustling the sheets, subtly blowing Alex's hair and continuing OVER CAMERA.
text: Even in his sleep, Alex shivers from the passing cold. His eyes open surprised to be suddenly awakened. He considers for a beat, then looks toward...

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - WAGGNER HOUSE - NIGHT

text: Alex studies his mountain of research, increasingly obsessed.
text: An O.S. paper FLUTTER draws his attention to the newspaper being blown by the fan. He reaches out and grabs it. Headlines and photos report on the memorial service.

speaker_heading: ALEX'S POV - NEWSPHOTO
text: Clear Rivers sits in her seat, legs crossed, alluring and sexy and

speaker_heading: ALEX

text: Tod puts the lid down and UNSNAPS his jeans. As he turns, pulls his pants down and sits, CAMERA MOVES to the CURTAINS... still... until a cold soft breeze causes them to billow. CAMERA FOLLOWS the wind as it CONTINUES into the room, rippling across shower curtains.
text: As the breeze passes Tod, he pauses... as if sensing, but not

speaker_heading: ALEX'S POV - WINDOW

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: MR. WAGGNER

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: MR. WAGGNER
dialog: All my wife and I will ever know is

speaker_heading: CLEAR (O.S.)
dialog: Almost Autumn.
text: Alex looks off toward a small unkept house, nestled at the edge of the woods. In the open garage stands Clear Rivers amongst cluttered artwork, supplies and tools. Her t-shirt's sleeves have been cut off and neck-line cut low. Her jeans have a revealing hole at the spot which once was a back pocket. She wears heavy black work shoes. A dog rests nearby on the floor.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: It's only the end of June.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Yeah, but everthing's always in

text: Alex reads her intention loud and clear. She returns to her artwork. The dog GROWLS softly as Alex appraches the garage.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVERS' HOUSE - DAY
text: Entering the garage, Alex gets a closer look at her artwork. It's abstract sculpture and canvas work and pretty bad, at that.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: Know what this is?
text: She gestures to him to approach her. He tenses, awkward, but moves closer. Clear lifts a plastic cover off a canvas. Beneath is a mess of green and brown and orange; teen angst poorly communicated. Glued to the center is a twisted piece of metal.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Like, um... you're mad about
dialog: something?
text: She sighs, "thanks a lot," then proud, but not enough to make her appear foolish over her bad artwork, indicates the metal.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: A piece of debris... from the plane.
dialog: I went to the shore off the crash
dialog: site and it washed up on the beach.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You went there? I've wanted to go
dialog: there, but I thought it was off
dialog: limits.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: It is. But that didn't stop me.
dialog: Shouldn't stop you.
text: Alex gently touches the piece of the plane, almost expecting to feel something more than cold metal. He looks to Clear...
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Why were you there last night?
text: While she cleans brushes with a can of turpentine...
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: Look, I've seen enough T.V. to know
dialog: the F.B.I. doesn't investigate teen
dialog: suicides. But they were there last
dialog: night, that means: one, they still
dialog: don't have a clue what caused the
dialog: crash. Two, they haven't ruled out
dialog: anything. And the fact that seven
dialog: people got off the plane is probably
dialog: weird enough, not to mention, that
dialog: one of those people had a vision, or
dialog: whatever, of it exploding minutes
dialog: before it did explode, is highly
dialog: suspicious. And it doesn't help that
dialog: the visionaries' friend just
dialog: committed suicide.
text: Alex eyes her for a long beat. She turns away from him, returning the can of turpentine to a shelf.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Why were you there last night?
text: Clear turns to Alex. The two couldn't appear more different. She moves to a sculpture, an ugly black and green globular sculpture with a white dot in the center.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: Know what this is?
text: Alex, cocks his eyebrow probably thinking, "a mess?" but tactfully shakes his head "no."
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: It's you.
text: Remaining dry and stoned faced, Alex tenses, uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: Not a likeness. It's how you make
dialog: me feel, Alex.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm... really sorry.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: Like you, the sculpture doesn't even
dialog: know what, or why, it is. Reluctant
dialog: to take form. And, yet, creating an
dialog: absolute but incomprehansible
dialog: attraction.
text: Uncertain, and yet moved, Alex listens.
speaker_heading: CLEAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Before that day, you were just
dialog: another suburban nothing that would
dialog: never have anything to do with my
dialog: life. And I'm sure you thought I was
dialog: some Marilyn Manson body-pierced
dialog: freak, or whatever.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But at that moment... on the plane...
dialog: I felt what you felt. I didn't know
dialog: where all those emotions were coming
dialog: from until you started freaking out.
dialog: Alex sighs, embarrassed.
speaker_heading: CLEAR (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn't see what you saw, but I
dialog: felt it. Okay, I'm not into all that
dialog: X-Files bullshit... but it was a
dialog: psychic connection. Why to me? Why
dialog: to you?
text: Jarred, he eyes her, frightened.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: And you can still feel it, can't
dialog: you? Something from that day is
dialog: still with you. I know, because I
dialog: can still feel you.
text: Alex is increasingly uncomfortable with the subject, but eased by Clear's apparent, somewhat, understanding. Lowering his tone...
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: That's why I was there last night.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I've never dealt with death before.
dialog: I wasn't alive when my grandparents
dialog: died. I wish I could know. I mean,
dialog: all this... could just be in our
dialog: heads. Now it feels like it's
dialog: everywhere.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: "It?"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What if Tod... is just the first...
dialog: of us?
text: The idea sends a shot of apprehension through Clear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: Is that something you're "feeling?"
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I don't know. I wish I could just see
dialog: him... one more time, then, maybe...

scene_heading: INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT
text: An elevator with collapsible metal door lowers INTO FRAME. Pushing the door aside, Alex and Clear proceed into the hallway, lined with morgue green tile. Stainless steel gurneys and porcelain equipment holding yellow surgical tubing and thick foot-long needles sit in the corridor.
text: A faint light spills from beneath a doorway. Clear reaches out to the knob but Alex quickly grabs her hand. From a cart behind them, he pulls a latex glove out of a box and snaps it on.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: Good call. Very "Quincy."
text: Alex tries the doorknob. Locked. He looks at her, defeated. Clear quickly points to some mortician's tools on the cart.
text: From it, Alex produces a thin six inch needle. He inserted the tool in the lock and jimmies the doorknob. CLACK!
scene_heading: INT. MORGUE - FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT
text: A lone desk lamp shines. Across the room, laying on a porcelain table, fluid draining tubes attached, lies Tod. A sheet is pulled up to his shoulders. He carries the macabre appearence of a corspe having been made up by a mortician. Hair combed and sprayed, skin tone too orange, blush too rouge and lips too red.
dialog: As Alex and Clear approach...
speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: CLEAR

speaker_heading: MR. BLUDWORTH

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Why..?
text: Alex completes his question by raising his hand, ala Tod's dead body. Bludworth nods, understanding...
speaker_heading: MR. BLUDWORTH
dialog: Chemicals in the vascular flush
dialog: create cadaveric spasm.
text: As the startle of the situation settles, it dawns on Alex that they have been busted. He nervously offers an explanation.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm... a friend of his. His best
dialog: friend. See, his father...
speaker_heading: MR. BLUDWORTH
dialog: (ominous)
dialog: I know who you are.
text: The mortician eyes Alex, understanding. Alex senses this and eases. Clear moves toward Tod's body, examining the neck area.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: They said he hung himself, but
dialog: there's no marks.
speaker_heading: MR. BLUDWORTH
dialog: I crafted a reconstruction of the

speaker_heading: ALEX'S POV - CLOSE - TOD'S NECK

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: Why would they say it was a

text: Because of the supernatural "message" he recieved, Alex is reluctant to answer. He eyes Mr. Bludworth, who, with a wry half smile, eyes Alex as if aware of the reason behind his hesitation.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: His father's pretty fucked up with
dialog: denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with
dialog: the thought of an other accident...
dialog: taking another son.
speaker_heading: MR. BLUDWORTH

text: CAMERA INCHES TOWARD the mortician. In this environment, lit with Fritz Lang shadows, Bludworth's tone, appearance... he could easily be mistaken for personification of the subject.
speaker_heading: MR. BLUDWORTH

speaker_heading: MR. BLUDWORTH

text: Vile liquid oozes out of the body onto the porcelain table.
speaker_heading: MR. BLUDWORTH
dialog: You may not realize it, but we're
dialog: all just a mouse that a cat has by
dialog: its tail. Every single move we
dialog: make, from the mundane to the
dialog: monumental... the red light we stop
dialog: at, or run; the people we have sex
dialog: with, or won't with us; the airplane
dialog: we ride, or walk out of... is all a
dialog: part of Death's sadistic design
dialog: leading to the grave.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Design?
text: The mortician considers as he drains some yellowish green fluid from the table. He shrugs then continues his work...
speaker_heading: MR. BLUDWORTH
dialog: If Life is like a box of
dialog: chocolates... Death... Death is like
dialog: a big Milton Bradley game of "Mouse
dialog: Trap." The day you're born is just
dialog: the boot, hanging from the
dialog: streetlamp, kicking the marble to
dialog: get things rolling. Growing up is
dialog: only the marble rolling down the
dialog: curving chute. You feel immortal
dialog: having survived school, sex, drugs
dialog: 'n' rock 'n' roll, but you've really
dialog: only upset the big hand holding the
dialog: steel ball that falls into the
dialog: bathtub. Marriage and kids and
dialog: career seem to make it all worthwhile
dialog: until the ball hits the see-saw and
dialog: flips the diving man into the big
dialog: barrel. In the old folks home or the
dialog: hospital you just see the big cage
dialog: rattling down until it captures...
dialog: the mouse.

dialog: Game over.
text: Alex considers as Clear eyes him, conveying "this guys's whacked!" Alex moves toward Bludworth...
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Maybe there's no way to win...
dialog: but... if you figured out the
dialog: game... you knew where the "steel
dialog: ball was rolling" couldn't you
dialog: avoid the trap and extend the

dialog: Death at Its own game?
text: Mr. Bludworth looks directly at Alex. CAMERA MOVES IN ON EACH,
dialog: INDIVIDUALLY... this between the two of them.
speaker_heading: MR. BLUDWORTH
dialog: You already did that by walking off
dialog: the plane. Now you gotta out when

text: BRAKING LOUDLY, startlingly, a public bus PULLS INTO CAMERA and stops. The doors HISS open.
speaker_heading: CLEAR (O.S.)
dialog: The mortician was whacked.
text: CAMERA ADJUSTS as Alex and Clear step off the bus and onto the street.
speaker_heading: CLEAR (CONT'D)
dialog: He was trippin' on formaldehyde.
text: Clear starts up the street, but Alex grabs her arm and steps back, assuring the bus moves off... safely. He nods, "it's safe to go." Throughout the following, his eyes are searching for anything potentially deadly.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: He said Death has a design. Even
dialog: before he said that I had been
dialog: seeing patterns.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: As in flannels and plaids?
text: Up ahead, scaffolds rise before a building being restored. O.S., HAMMERING and CONSTRUCTION WORK POUND from above. In the f.g., tools and metal spikes. After a "thumbs up" gesture, the rope is pulled UP AND OUT OF FRAME.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: How many died on Flight 180?
dialog: From our group?
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: Thirty-nine.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Remember the gate number?
text: As Clear takes a moment to consider, Alex steers them well around the scaffolds, eyes skyward during the move...
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Thirty-nine.
text: This is a creepy fact. Even though past the construction, Alex checks over his shoulder to assure they are out of harm's way.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Remember the departure time?
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: Like... 4:25.
text: Reaching an intersection, Alex pushes the pedestrian traffic light button, then steps well away from the curb.
speaker_heading: PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC SIGNAL
text: the halting red hand is lit.
speaker_heading: ALEX (V.O.)
dialog: Do you know when I was born?
speaker_heading: INTERSECTION
text: Clear sighs, growing impatient with Alex.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: 4:25.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Right. April 25th.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: Wait. I thought you meant the time
dialog: of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as
dialog: in, month and day... that's a reach.
speaker_heading: PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC SIGNAL
text: the halting red hand turns to the little white walking man.
speaker_heading: INTERSECTION
text: Clear takes a step off the sidewalk and onto the street. Alex tugs her back, looking both ways while outraged by her challenge.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: My birthday is the same as of the
dialog: time I was meant to die! That's a
dialog: reach!?
text: VROOM! A car indeed makes a right, TEARING through the intersection. Once past, Alex takes Clear by the arm and hustles them across the street.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: You're sounding like those people
dialog: who, you know... "Oswald shot
dialog: Kennedy from a warehouse and hid in
dialog: a theatre and Booth shot Lincoln in
dialog: a theatre and hid in a warehouse."
text: CAMERA HOLDS REVEALING an unmarked sedan parked across and down from a Starbucks with outdoor seating. Schreck and Weine sit in the car, eyes coolly locked on Alex and Clear.
speaker_heading: DOWN THE STREET - HEADING WEST
text: Billy Hitchcock rides toward the Starbucks on his bicycle.
speaker_heading: EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY
text: sitting outside, Alex hunches over the table, increasingly anxious. Clear listens; expression skeptical.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm not just layin' down a bunch
dialog: of math here, with this. I'm talking
dialog: about indications... omens... that
dialog: day, that we were meant to die. That,
dialog: if, we have been aware of... would
dialog: have saved everyone on the plane.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: That's total bullshit. You can find
dialog: death omens anywhere you want to.
text: She picks up her paper coffee cup.
speaker_heading: CLEAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, look! "Coffee" starts with a
dialog: "C" and ends with an "E." So does
dialog: the word "choke!" We're going to
dialog: choke to death! Oh no! Starbuck was
dialog: a whaler. We're going to be
dialog: harpooned!
text: Alex angrily glares at Clear. Clear drops her tone.
speaker_heading: CLEAR (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll go nuts if you start with
dialog: that shit.
text: Ms. Lewton appears from around the corner. She starts toward the entrance, but pauses, tensing when she sees Alex.
text: He cautiously flashes a greeting smile. The teacher, however, averts her eyes and continues into the coffee shop. Alex sighs, guiltily. Clear sympathizes with both of them.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: She's leaving the school. Moving
dialog: away.
dialog: Alex studies, appealing to her...
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Clear, how do we know that by
dialog: just sitting here, breathing this
dialog: air or sipping the coffee, having
dialog: crossed the street... we haven't
dialog: started in motion the events that
dialog: will lead to our death? Fifty years
dialog: from now. Ten years. Tomorrow.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You don't unless... you're able to
dialog: open yourself to the signs I'm
dialog: willing to show you.
text: He leans foward, removing a peice of paper from his pocket.
speaker_heading: CLOSE - ALEX'S HAND
text: slides across the table. Opening his hand REVEALS the piece of paper reading, "... Tod..." Clear's hand ENTER'S FRAME to take the paper. CAMERA FOLLOWS AS SHE raises it, her expression obviously puzzled. As she eyes Alex for an explanation, CAMERA CRANES DOWN QUICKLY to the empty paper cups on the table...
text: ... a slight approaching BREEZE knocks them over.
speaker_heading: DOWN THE STREET - HEADING WEST
text: A somewhat cherry 70's muscle car speeds in the direction of the Starbucks. Carter Horton is driving. Terry Chaney rides shotgun. Carter looks out the window.
speaker_heading: CARTER'S POV - MOVING - ALEX AND CLEAR
text: She holds the paper as Alex, apparently, explains the story.
speaker_heading: CARTER'S CAR
text: CARTER scowls, his anger rising as he slows, staring at the perceived reasons for his problems.
speaker_heading: ALEX AND CLEAR
text: Her eyes turn from the paper to Alex, concerned about him...
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: I don't understand... did you see
dialog: Tod die? Did it happen again, like 		on the plane?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No, but it might as well be the
dialog: same thing. This was a message...
dialog: from someone, or something...
dialog: hinting... at the design.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: Alex, on the plane... you must have
dialog: experienced... some kind of hyper
dialog: awareness. But here... you're
dialog: suggesting Tod's death... and maybe
dialog: our own... will happen because of...
dialog: an active Presence.
text: Alex nods, feeling she's understanding.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: The mortician said Death has a
dialog: design. Now... if you, me, Tod,
dialog: Carter, Terry, Billy, Ms. Lewton
dialog: messed up that design, because, for
dialog: whatever reason, I was able to see
dialog: Death's plan... then we cheated it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But what if it was our time, what if
dialog: we were not meant to get off that
dialog: plane? What if it is still is our
dialog: time? If... It... is still not
dialog: finished with us? We will all still
dialog: die; now, not later.
dialog: Troubled and deeply concerned, Clear studies Alex.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: Unless... we find the pattern. And
dialog: cheat it again.
text: Clear sets the paper down, looking sadly at Alex.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: After hearing you, just now... I do
dialog: believe...
dialog: 
text: Alex leans back and sighs, relieved...
speaker_heading: CLEAR (CONT'D)
dialog: ...that Tod killed himself.
text: Alex is taken aback, hurt and angry.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Then there's no one left who can help
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: CARTER'S CAR
text: His eyes having never left Alex, Carter suddenly cranks the wheel hard to the left to make a tight U-Turn.
speaker_heading: BILLY HITCHCOCK
text: rides his bike. He reacts, startled by...
speaker_heading: BILLY HITCHCOCK'S POV - CARTER'S CAR
text: barreling down towards him. The car cuts in front of the bicycle to complete the U-Turn.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Billy SWERVES to the left, directly in front of an oncoming car. The car SWERVES right, as does Billy, avoiding a certain fatal collision for the cyclist. The oncoming car HONKS!
text: Carter's car pulls up to the curb. Oblivious to the accident he almost caused, Carter gets out, strutting toward the tables outside the coffee shop. Inside the car, Terry sighs...
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Baby, come on... not now.
text: But her boyfriend continues. She gets out and hustles after him.
speaker_heading: ALEX AND CLEAR
text: Their attention drawn by the commotion, Clear and Alex watch Carter Horton approach them, followed by Terry, who stops, irked, near the curb at the crosswalk.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Carter...
text: At that moment, Ms. Lewton exits with an ezpresso drink. Sensing trouble, she has no energy or desire to involve herself.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Kind of have a reunion, here.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Let it go!
text: Carter steps before Ms. Lewton, blocking her exit...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: When are you moving?
speaker_heading: MS. LEWTON
dialog: A couple of weeks.
text: She can't wait to leave. While trying to walk around Carter...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: We're losing our favorite teacher.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Look, there's something you should
dialog: all know.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: Alex...
text: Carter eyes Alex, continuing the taunt. He raises the volume of his words to drown out Alex's words and incite conflict.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D) ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: Lived here her whole life. This'll be hard to believe.
text: Ms. Lewton's eyes flash to Alex, afraid of him.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D) ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: And now she has to move. Listen to me, we may all
dialog: All because of Browning. be in danger...
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Shut up! The both of you!
dialog: The two boys stop their heated exchange.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: They died! We lived!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Get over it! I won't let that plane
dialog: crash be the most important thing in
dialog: my life. I'm moving on, Carter, and
dialog: if you're gonna waste your life
dialog: beating the shit out of Alex
dialog: everytime you see him, then you can
dialog: just drop fucking dead!
text: Head and shoulders remaining angrily in Carter's direction, Terry takes a blind step off the curb and into the crosswalk, WITHOUT A CUT... a bus suddenly speeds INTO FRAME and, THUD! plows directly right into her...
speaker_heading: ALEX, CLEAR, CARTER AND MS. LEWTON

speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: It's that girl... Clear.
text: No response from Alex. Ken sighs, then into the phone...
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: He's in the shower, Clear. Can I
dialog: have him get back at ya? Sure...
dialog: bye.
text: Ken returns to the living room, concerned about his son. Alex averts his eyes, stressed and ashamed. Ken sits nearby.
speaker_heading: KEN (CONT'D)
dialog: She's concerned about you.

speaker_heading: TELEVISION
text: The high-tech computer image traces the path of the explosion through the plane. A red line representing the fuel line zigs through the body of the plane, making a sharp turn forward to the fuel pump, which explodes. Jagged lines show the direction of the explosion moving backwards toward the rear of the plane.

text: The corresponding jagged picture of the explosion back is reminiscent of the "hand of Death," seen earlier in the lightning. It is a graphic demonsration of the arbitrary nature of Death.
speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: MS. LEWTON
dialog: Oh... mom's favorite.
text: She slides a vinyl record album out of the sleeve and moves to the turntable on a shelf, thick with dust.

CAMERA SWEEPS IN CLOSE TO THE TURNTABLE, although spinning around and around... the bold letters of the center label can be read...

Some water spills on the side of the kettle. As she wipes the pot with a blue checked hand towel, a dark shadow appears to cross behind her.

text: On her back, on the floor, she is badly burned. Her open neck wound continues to bleed. Blood pools on the floor. In shock and moving on pure survial instincts, she reaches up...
scene_heading: LEWTON'S POV - (LOOKING UP) - THE HAND TOWEL
text: the lower third of the towel dangles over the edge of the counter top. Her hand grabs it, and pulls.
speaker_heading: COUNTER TOP
text: the draped edge of the towel pulls over the cutlery block. The knives spill out, entangled with the hand towel.
speaker_heading: ALEX (O.S.)
dialog: Ms. Lewton!
speaker_heading: KITCHEN DOORWAY
text: Alex rushes across the threshold as Ms. Lewton pulls the knives over the counter.
speaker_heading: MS. LEWTON
text: a half dozen knives, from small, but sharp, cutting blades to large butcher knives, cascade into her body.
speaker_heading: JOHN DENVER (V.O.)
dialog: They say that he got crazy once and
dialog: he tried to touch the sun...
text: Her hand trembling, her expression horrified, Lewton grabs the handle of the largest blade, trying to pull it out. Alex quickly kneels next to her. She looks at him, in shock, her eyes pleading. Alex gathers his courage, places his hand on the handle of the largest blade. As he's about to remove it...
speaker_heading: THE STOVE
text: a gas line ERUPTS, creating a small EXPLOSION.
speaker_heading: THE COUNTER TOP
text: the cutlery block is knocked off of the counter...
speaker_heading: MS. LEWTON
text: the block lands directly on the butcher knife handle, driving the blade further into Ms. Lewton's body.
speaker_heading: LEWTON'S POV - THE SHADOW
text: descends, the FRAME COLLAPSING until her face, eerily peaceful, but lifeless gray, horrifically decays... flesh rotting, worms feeding on muscle until only a skull remains.
speaker_heading: MS. LEWTON
text: as Death arrives, her eyes are macabrely focused above her.
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: Even as blood squirts on him from her open wound, he appears to realize she is "seeing" the moment of death.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Ms. Lewton!
text: Flames leap from the stove to the curtains, which catch fire.
text: Alex grabs the knife and pulls it out. He quickly removes another and another... yet there is no reaction from the woman.
text: Knowing she is dead, Alex pauses with guilt. He looks at the knife in his hand, then realizes how incriminating this could appear. In that moment, another small EXPLOSION from the stove brings Alex quickly to his feet. He drops the knife to the floor and races from the house. CAMERA TILTS DOWN to the shoe prints left in the pool of blood.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LEWTON'S STREET - NIGHT
text: Alex runs with all his strength away from Valerie Lewton's home. Billy Hitchcock is riding his bicycle in Alex's direction. He stops and gets off his bike.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Hey, Alex...
text: Alex appears unaware as he simply runs past Billy, who curiously turns his head to watch Alex race up the street. O.S., the CRACKLING OF FIRE. CAMERA MOVES INTO Billy as he turns back, reacting with shock to Ms. Lewton's house.
speaker_heading: THE HOUSE
text: from inside, an intense EXPLOSION propels glass from the windows. Flames engulf the entire house.
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: even down the street, he is knocked to his feet by the blast. In the distance, SIRENS from approaching POLICE AND FIRE trucks are HEARD. He stands, looks to the now suspicious Billy... then opts to run off away from the scene. Escaping into the dark backyards of the neighborhood.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT./EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVERS' HOUSE - DAY - CLEAR RIVERS
dialog: Tense, her eyes look left, then right...
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: I don't know where he is. He's not
dialog: talking to me.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Agents Schreck and Weine stand before Clear in her garage.
speaker_heading: WEINE
dialog: Why?
text: She studies the men before averting her eyes.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: Because I didn't believe him.
text: The agents study her. Weine accepts the explanation. Schreck's eyes take a walk around the artwork in the garage, pausing on a piece of twisted metal from the crash. Clear tenses, however...
speaker_heading: SCHRECK
dialog: If he should contact you, it
dialog: would be in the best interest
dialog: of your own safety to contact us.
text: Schreck hands his card. She takes it and nods. Schreck pauses, once again eyeing the painting before moving out of the garage on their way to their car.
text: CAMERA PUSHES IN ON CLEAR as she looks at the business card.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MT. ABRAHAM HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT
text: CAMERA PUSHES IN ON Flight 180 Memorial, lit for dramatic effect at night, but only achieving an eeriness. Carter Horton and Billy Hitchcock ENTER FRAME, moving toward the monument. Billy is riding his bicycle, wearing a New York Rangers jersey with "Hitchcock" across the back of the shoulders. Nearing the shadows, the two boys stop looking at the monument.
text: Carter pulls put a heavy pocket knife and starts attempting to cut into the stone.
dialog: Clear Rivers appears from the shadows.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Terry's name should be on this wall.
dialog: Clear is touched by the action.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: So, why'd you want us to meet you
dialog: here? Now?
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: They're watching me, see if I go to
dialog: Alex.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Are you?
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: They'll follow my car.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's why you're taking me.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Why would I want to see him?
text: Clear eyes the two of them. With the memorial standing behind them...
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: Because he knows which one of us
dialog: is next.
dialog: As Carter and Billy feel the chill of their inner fears...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: The muscle car ROARS onto U.S. 17 on ramp. A sign near the road indicates:
dialog: "Middletown - 25 mi. New York City - 105 mi."
speaker_heading: INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Carter checks the rearview mirror. Clear looks out the front passenger window. She shakes her head, as if "no one's following us." Billy leans forward from the backseat...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Um... okay... drive the speed limit,
dialog: right?
text: He sits back, OUT OF FRAME, but quickly darts forward.
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: And don't pass on the right.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!
dialog: You're the next one...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: 'Cause if you say another word,
dialog: I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
text: Billy sits back, gesturing, "hear ya. Got it." Clear pays no attention to their exchange as she stare out into the darkness, her thoughts a million miles away.
scene_heading: EXT. SEASHORE - JONES BEACH SATE PARK - NIGHT
text: A posted sign indicates "ACCIDENT SITE. ANY DEBRIS FOUND SHOULD BE REPORTED TO THE NTSB (212)555-NTSB." CAMERA FINDS Carter's car pulling up to a stop. Clear opens the passenger door and pauses in the car a while...
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: He could be anywhere from here to a
dialog: mile down the shore. You guys drive
dialog: down there, start this way and we'll
dialog: meet around the middle. It'll take
dialog: half the time.
dialog: 
text: Clear closes the door. Carter and Billy drive off. As she looks to the beach.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
text: CAMERA, FACING the ocean, moves along the shore revealing a lone image sitting on the beach, looking into the Atlantic.
text: The waves are small bur rhythmic, an enternal metronome. Numb, Alex Browning sits in the sand searching for an answer somewhere in the darkness of the evening sea.
text: Behind him, O.S., approaching in the sand, SOFT FOOTSTEPS. He listens, notes them. Yet rather than turn around... he looks up into the sky.
speaker_heading: ALEX'S POV - THE SKY
text: The shoreline lights cast an orange haze on the stars, breaking through, infinitely above.
speaker_heading: ALEX (O.S.)
dialog: Are they up there?
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Clear Rivers approaches, barefoot in the sand. He neddn't turn to know who is behind him.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: Somehow... is 180 still in flight?
dialog: Somewhere... are they still safe?
text: Clear hasn't met eyes with Alex, but she sits nearby, looking into the sky.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: When I was a kid, like, six or
dialog: seven... I used to worry so much
dialog: about my parents dying. Like lying
dialog: awake at night... just worrying. I
dialog: loved them so much. I didn't want
dialog: them to get hurt. And what would
dialog: happen to me? What would life be
dialog: like?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Every night... it seemed.
text: She looks out at the stars. He doesn't eye her, either...
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Most kids do, I guess.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: Most kids never have it happen.
dialog: Alex hangs his head...
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: When I was ten... my dad went into a
dialog: 7-11 for cigerettes. I guess he heard
dialog: somebody say "Don't turn around." So
dialog: on reflex, or thinkin' a friend was
dialog: jokin'... he did. And the guy blew
dialog: his head off.
dialog: She has lived this so many times, she is long beyond crying...
speaker_heading: CLEAR (CONT'D)
dialog: And, let me tell ya, I had every
dialog: reason to worry before... because
dialog: life became shit. I don't blame her,
dialog: I guess, but my mom couldn't deal
dialog: with it at all. She married this
dialog: asshole, who my mom with my real
dialog: dad would cross the street to avoid
dialog: this guy. He really didn't want a
dialog: kid. And so my mom didn't either
dialog: anymore, I guess.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If that was the design for my
dialog: father... and my family... then fuck
dialog: Death, FUCK IT!
text: The waves continue to shore. Clear looks up at the sky.
speaker_heading: CLEAR (CONT'D)
dialog: And so, anyway... I've thought of
dialog: that "somewhere," Alex. It exists,
dialog: that place.
text: He looks at her.
speaker_heading: CLEAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Where my dad is still safe. Where he
dialog: had a full pack of cigerettes and
dialog: kept driving. A place where me and
dialog: my dad and my mom... are still
dialog: together....and have no idea about
dialog: this second life, here.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: A place where our friends are still
dialog: in the sky... where everyone gets a
dialog: second chance.
dialog: She looks at him...
speaker_heading: CLEAR (CONT'D)
dialog: But that place might only exist in
dialog: my heart. And maybe, now... yours. I
dialog: haven't experienced too many second
dialog: chances in my life. I haven't seen
dialog: any. But because of all of this, I
dialog: believe... because of you... I will
dialog: get a second chance. Because of me,
dialog: you will. With you in my life... that
dialog: place, right now existing in our
dialog: hearts, will spring out... and become
dialog: a real part of this life.
text: Alex looks within her, as a soft ocean breeze blows through Clear's hair.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: And that is the only way we can beat
dialog: Death... by making something special
dialog: out of Life.
text: His eyes well with tears. Only as she looks at Alex does Clear become emotional... they move closer, and kiss, the desire for each other, to defy the events around them; darkness; the isolation...
text: They dive into a deep feverish kiss. Embracing, as if the tighter, the safer. She pulls him back down to the beach and lifts his shirt over his head.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: This won't be safe.
text: Clear looks down the beach, checking for any sight of Billy and Carter.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: Those guys are probably fifteen
dialog: minutes away.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No.. I mean, I don't have anything
dialog: on me. This won't be safe.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: Nothing is... anymore.
text: Alex looks to Clear, then kisses her with passion that reflects the defiance of death. He pulls open her shirt and falls into her arms. CAMERA CRANES UP as the young man and woman make love in the sand... consciously and defiantly oblivious, to anything around them... including the stars, possibly Flight 180, up above.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Carter drives. Billy rides shotgun. Alex and Clear are in the back. Everyone anxious, looking for cops.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I can't go home. After Lewton's,
dialog: they'll be after me.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: We're takin' you to a cabin in the
dialog: woods, it's only a couple miles from
dialog: my house.
dialog: (to Carter)
dialog: Keep off the highways, they'll be
dialog: lookin' for us.
text: Carter, however, continually glances into the rearview mirror, checking Alex. Finally, hotheaded and unable to withhold it any further...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Alright, Browning, you fuckin'
dialog: warlock... did you know about Ms.
dialog: Lewton, or what?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Why do you think I was hiding?
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you
dialog: runnin' away from her house.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: They blame me for everything. Her,
dialog: Tod, the plane crash...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Your shoe prints were in the blood.
dialog: Your fingerprints on the knives...
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I already told you...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: I'm not talkin' about if you did it.
dialog: Or if you knew she was dead...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Did you know she was going to be
dialog: next... before she was?
text: Alex looks at Clear, her expression asking the same question...
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (almost to himself)
dialog: When she died... at that moment, I
dialog: could tell she saw something... horrible.
dialog: The three others turn quiet, considering what it must be...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Out of us... who's next to see it?
dialog: Alex eyes them... hesitant to respond.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Please tell me I'm gonna get to see
dialog: the Jets win the Super Bowl.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Me, right? That's why you're not
dialog: saying.
text: Billy looks out the window, despondent.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Shoulda felt up Tammy in the pool,
dialog: that time...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (to Billy)
dialog: Whatta you whinin' about? He said I'm
dialog: next.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You have a responsibility to tell me.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Is knowing going to make it easier?
dialog: It makes it harder.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You get off havin' control over me.
dialog: Let me choose how to deal with it.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: It doesn't matter who's next...
dialog: we're all on the same list.
dialog: The three are silent.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Aww, fuck... really?
text: Carter's expression becomes frightened, but he cannot have this. He counters with an irrational bravado.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Then why bother? What's the fuckin'
dialog: point? Terry and me will be back
dialog: together on the other side, so why
dialog: wait any longer?
text: Carter bares down on the wheel, hits the GAS...
scene_heading: EXT. AN INTERSECTION - NIGHT

speaker_heading: INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CLEAR

scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER INTERSECTION - NIGHT

speaker_heading: INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CLEAR BILLY
dialog: Stop it! Hey, c'mon, man...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What's your fuckin' worry? If it's
dialog: not your time...? I could get nailed

speaker_heading: ALEX CLEAR

scene_heading: EXT. TRAFFIC LIGHT INTERSECTION - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. A SECOND TRAFFIC LIGHT INTERSECTION - NIGHT
text: The turning car HONKS, ROARING through the intersection as Carter's car nearly clips the rear end of the turning car.
speaker_heading: INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CLEAR ALEX
dialog: Stop the car! Let us out!
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I am... so close to puking, you

speaker_heading: CLEAR

dialog: So, stop what you're doing and STOP
dialog: THIS CAR! Right fucking now!
scene_heading: EXT. BACKSTREET - NIGHT
text: In the backseat, Alex and Clear ease... just as a railroad crossing arm drops INTO FRAME in the REAR WINDOW. O.S., the CLANG CLANG CLANG of a RAILROAD CROSSING ALARM.
speaker_heading: OUT OF THE FRONT WINDOW

speaker_heading: INSIDE THE CAR

speaker_heading: ALEX BILLY
dialog: Don't do it! Don't do it! It's coming! It's coming!
speaker_heading: INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Arms crossed, Carter remains in the front seat. As the interior fills with light from the headlight of the oncoming train, Carter turns and looks at them with a smart ass smile, pleased that he's shown how brave he truly is. With a beam of cocky definace...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: It ain't my time.

speaker_heading: CARTER'S POV - REAR VIEW MIRROR

speaker_heading: CARTER
text: as if the image has effected him, he looks to his lap belt and CLACKS the button. He tugs at the restraint, but it will not move. He's strapped in.
text: He tries to open the door... it won't open. He pulls at the door handle... tugs at the seatbelt... panicked. Horrified, he whips towards the others.
speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: BILLY

dialog: DEAD!
speaker_heading: TRAIN TRACKS
text: the debris bounces directly on the track. With great power and force, a train wheel runs over the debris, cutting it in half. It catches in the wheel and is spun around until shot out with the force of a missile...
speaker_heading: BILLY
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: AND YOU AIN'T TAKIN' ME WITH YOU!
text: FWOOP! The metal tears ACROSS FRAME, ripping Billy's head from his

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Jesus fucking Christ!
text: For a beat, there is SILENCE... until, in the distance, SIRENS can be heard, approaching. As Alex stands and Carter manages to rise on wobbly legs... none of them can remove their eyes from Billy's body.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (to Carter)
dialog: You should have been next. After
dialog: Lewton, you should've been next.
dialog: That's the only pattern. You should
dialog: be dead.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You're the fuckin' devil.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (to Clear)
dialog: But I saved him. I intervened. Just
dialog: like the plane. That's the design.
speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: Police are coming.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: That's why It skipped Carter and
dialog: went to the next one in the path
dialog: of the explosion; Billy.
text: Alex looks at Clear as if expiriencing an intense epiphany.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: My intervention in the death of 180
dialog: surviviors will cheat the design.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: "Intervention?" What are you, God
dialog: now?!
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to

speaker_heading: CLEAR
dialog: You're losin' it. The police will be
dialog: here. We have to go to the cabin.
dialog: You can hide there. Get your head

text: Clear grabs Clear and touches her face.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)

dialog: Hey, I won't let it happen, okay.
dialog: Carter turns to them; it's as far as he will go to admit he believes... or will help...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Then, get out of here.
text: As she moves to Alex, Clear nods her acknowledgement and appreciation to Carter. She takes Alex by the hand and the pair begin running away, off into the woods.
text: In the DISTANCE, a TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS, eerie, as if Death was punctuating the moment.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: EXT. CABIN - NIGHT
text: The windows are boarded. The front steps are worn and dilapidated. In the early evening moonlight, the dwelling appears eerie and ghostly. CAMERA CREEPS TOWARD the house, a pre-storm breeze swaying branches and blowing leaves. In the distance... LIGHTNING...
scene_heading: INT. CABIN - DAY - A SMALL TABLE
text: A final piece of duct tape is applied to the corner of the table, dulling any sharp edges. Even though it is sunny outside, all the shades are pulled. The room sits in dark shadows broken by occasional bright shafts of light.
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS a hand as it carefully picks up a Coleman lantern and sets it atop an empty can placed in the center and above the water line of a large metal tub; a fire protection moat.
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: finds his way to a chair in the center of the room, away from everything except a nearby table holding a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit, both at less than arm's reach.
text: Unshaven, a week and a half's growth, and unkept, Alex looks horrible. An anxious zombie, especially in the dim glow of the lantern. Dark circles, from lack of sleep. Thin, from lack of food. Pale, from lack of sunlight.
text: He places workman's gloves on his hands before picking up a can of Underwood chicken spread. With some degree of difficulty, he works the gloves beneath the tab and pulls. Careful not to cut himself, he reaches out and drops the lid into a small trash can.
text: Alex removes the gloves and, with a plastic spoon, begins to eat. CAMERA PUSHES IN as he begins to chew methodically, chewing and chewing and chewing with concentration until... after steadying himself... prepares to swallow... then, carefully does.
text: Pause... he's alright. He takes the spoon. Scoops some more. And the process begins again.

scene_heading: INT. CABIN - NIGHT - CRACK BENEATH DOOR
text: The resulting THUNDER RUMBLES. A breeze blows beneath the door, carrying some Autumn leaves. CAMERA FOLLOWS the breeze across the floor to Alex's pant legs which slightly flutter.

speaker_heading: ALEX'S POV - TRASH BAG
text: the brown shopping bag tips over. Amongst the trash spread on the floor, a can rolls out and across the floor.
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: tenses. He doesn't look to where the can has been, but where it is going.
speaker_heading: ALEX'S POV - CAN
text: rolls across the floor and gently hits the end of a fishing pole, propped in the corner. The pole teeters and falls over.
speaker_heading: FISHING HOOK
text: falls, hooking a closet door. The door begins to swing open.
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: is quickly out of his safe chair, hustling towards...
speaker_heading: THE DOOR
text: Alex slams the door shut before it can open. Behind the door, a CRASH as something falls. Alex cracks a wicked half smile, cocky he has caught Death before this attempt has brought to fruition.
text: Alex removes the hook from the door and places the pole on the floor. He cautiously opens the door, REVEALING an old fish scaling knife embedded on the back side of the door, unaware. Removing the knife and securing it, his eyes turn towards the floor.
speaker_heading: CLOSET FLOOR
text: a tackle box has spilled thick, rusted old treble and aberdeen fishing hooks upon the floor. Alex bends down and examines them.

speaker_heading: INT. CABIN - NIGHT
text: Distant THUNDER ECHOES. Alex kindles a fire in the fireplace, balling up old newspapers. He begins to crumble the local news... then pauses.

speaker_heading: HEADLINE - CRUMPLED NEWSPAPER

scene_heading: EXT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CLEAR'S POV - POWER LINES
dialog: ARC violently striking the ground and each other. Each line whips
text: unpredictably like an uncontrolled garden hose with the water turned on full. And yet, there's a mean, angry and taunting personality to the two power lines. As if Death were within them.
scene_heading: INT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: She assesses the situation and moves to a pair of candles on the mantle, lightning them with a Bic. O.S., from the backyard, a DOG BARKS. Clear brings the candle through the small house.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CLEAR'S POV
text: An old circular clothesline turns like a pinwheel in the wind. In the center of the yard is an oblong, tarped above ground pool. In the furthest corner of the yard, her dog is chained to a tree, BARKING AND FREAKED OUT. An old tire swing rocks in the storm. From the manner in which the house is situated and the length of the snapped power lines, one is capable of reaching the backyard.
dialog: The power line STRIKES the ground, "closing in on" the dog.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
