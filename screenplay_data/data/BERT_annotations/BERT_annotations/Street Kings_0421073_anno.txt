dialog: "Pilot"
speaker_heading: TEASER
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NIGHT
text: TwO MEN in their early twenties, JIMMY PATTERSON and TONY
text: BUTLER, walk down a sidewalk in the Meat Packing District.
text: Funky hole-in-the-wall bars butt up against graffiti covered
text: steel shutters protecting closed storefronts. There are few
text: other people on the streets at this hour: Hipsters heading
text: out to begin their night, while the homeless hunker down.
text: Late night delivery trucks rumble down the street.
text: Both Jimmy and Tony are dressed down in the latest hip grunge-
text: wear. There's a lot of pent-up energy crackling around these
text: guys, especially Tony, who's twitching like roach caught in
text: a trap.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Jimmy, I'm jonesin' hard. We've gotta
dialog: make a stop.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Wait on it. We're already late.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I'm telling you, I need a taste now
dialog: Tony's serious.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Okay, fine. But we make it quick.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NONDESCRIPT BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Jimmy and a SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE, of varying ages and
text: ethnicities mill around, smoking cigarettes. They are all
text: waiting for an unmarked, but heavily secured door to open.
text: Tony is still twitching.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Man, what's the hold-up tonight?
speaker_heading: WAITING MAN
dialog: Always like this on Fridays. Everyone
text: waits till the last minute.
text: The door opens and Tony steps out. The Waiting Man hurriedly
text: pushes past him into the building.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You ready?
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 2.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I'm set.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Let's go.
text: As Tony and Jimmy walk away from the building, Tony reaches
text: inside his jacket. Jimmy grabs his arm.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You're not gonna do it here?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You watch me.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Not cool.
text: He scans the street, sees an alley, shielded from the
text: streetlights.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Over there, c'mon.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
text: Tony hurries into the shadows with Jimmy a few steps behind.
text: They side-step the usual assortment of overflowing garbage
text: cans. A few scavenging rats scurry away from their
dialog: interrupted meals.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Dude, shouldn't be this bad. You're
text: waiting too long between hook-ups.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Now you're the expert? I've been
dialog: doing this longer than you.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What can I say? I'm a natural.
text: Tony snorts derisively as he reaches inside his jacket to
text: pull out something wrapped in PLAIN BROWN PAPER. He tears
text: open the paper. Inside is not drugs, but a CLEAR, HOSPITAL-
text: STYLE BAG FILLED WITH A RED, VISCOUS LIQUID. It looks
text: suspiciously like BLOOD.
text: Tony opens his mouth to reveal TWO SHARP, OVERLY LONG CANINE
text: TEETH. He BITES INTO THE BAG and a BLISSFUL LOOK spreads
text: across his face as he GREEDILY GULPS down the blood.
text: Seeing Tony's obvious, almost sexual satisfaction, Jimmy
text: can't resist. He pulls out a similar bag of blood.
text: But just as he's about to bite into his, Tony GAGS.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 3.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: (jokes)
dialog: What'd your mamma say about gulping
dialog: your food?
text: But Tony isn't laughing. He begins to CHOKE, then RETCHES
text: UP RED FLUID.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Tony, take it easy! What's wrong
dialog: with you?
text: As Jimmy looks on in horror, Tony begins to VIOLENTLY
text: CONVULSE. He FALLS FACE FIRST to the ground, his body FLAILING
speaker_heading: WILDLY.
text: Jimmy grabs Tony, rolls him over onto his back. Tony's
text: face is a mask of shock and fear. A SMALL CRIMSON TRICKLE
text: OF BLOOD runs down his chin. Tony blinks rapidly as his
text: EYES TURN RED, filling with blood. Then, with a final,
text: PINKISH, FROTHY COUGH, it's over. Tony's hand, still
text: clutching the plastic bag, falls to his side. His red eyes
text: now stare sightlessly at the black night sky above.
text: Jimmy staggers back...
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: (completely freaked)
dialog: Tony... Oh, man, oh man...
text: He looks down at the bag of blood he's still holding in his
text: hand. Then, looks back toward the building from where he
text: and Tony just came. From this distance, we can now see a
text: brightly lit sign on the side of the building. It reads:
text: CANAL STREET BLOOD BANK.
text: Jimmy drops his untouched bag of blood. It falls onto the
text: ground next to Tony's lifeless body as Jimmy turns and runs
text: first awkwardly, than faster, faster, down the alley, away
dialog: from his dead friend...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - DAWN
text: A number UNIFORMED COPS mill around, putting up crime scene
text: tape, comparing notes. A CRIME SCENE TECH snaps a few final
text: photos of the dead vampire, before covering it with a tarp.
text: A sea of HUMAN GAWKERS, straining their necks for a glimpse
text: of gore from behind the tape, suddenly part for ALEXANDRA
text: CANTARA, a Classically beautiful young woman in her mid-
text: twenties. Although in civilian dress, she carries herself
text: with a definite air of authority.
text: Alex quickly makes her way to the front of the gathered crowd.
text: Flashing her badge, she fluidly ducks beneath the gaudy yellow
text: police tape and is met by DETECTIVE DARNELL HARVEY.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 4.
text: Mid-thirties, tall, with a solid, muscular build. A career
dialog: cop you'd want at your back in a dark alley at night.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: Morning, Alex.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Darnell. What've we got?
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: Dead Vampire.
text: Alex follows Darnell to a tarp-covered body. They both pull
text: on LATEX GLOVES. Alex pulls the tarp back to reveal Tony,
text: still lying face up in what is now a pool of cold, congealed
text: blood. She scans the body.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Poor kid.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
text: He wasn't staked. No signs of any
dialog: struggle. Just lots of regurgitated
dialog: blood.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Like the Vampire we found last week.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: That's what I was thinking too.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Damn.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You smell anything?
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: Just death.
text: Alex notices the empty blood bag clutched in Tony's hand.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: The Canal Street Blood Bank is right
text: around the corner.
text: Darnell holds up an ID card.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: Yeah, this was in his wallet. Name
dialog: was Tony Butler. Registered with the
dialog: city for weekly withdrawals.
text: Alex picks up the still full bag of blood laying beside Tony.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: One bag per customer which means
dialog: another Vampire was here. Let's get
dialog: this blood tested.
text: Darnell takes the bag and puts it in an evidence envelope.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: And I'll run the bag's serial number
text: against the blood bank's records.
dialog: See if I get a name. You think this
dialog: other Vamp is our killer?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Vampires don't kill each other like
dialog: this. And why would he take off and
dialog: leave a full bag of blood behind?
dialog: Especially one we can trace.
text: Alex looks at Tony's hand clutching the empty bag.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: Unless he was afraid of it...
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: You think something in the blood
dialog: killed this guy?
text: A dark, concerned expression washes over Alex's face.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: The City's blood supply has always
dialog: been safe. But if someone's found a
dialog: way to tamper with it...
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: The Vampires will stop going to the
dialog: blood banks. They'll have to find
dialog: other sources for their fix.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Human sources. The Vampires will
dialog: start hunting again.
text: The Camera pans up and out of the alley, and we catch a
text: glimpse of Alex's city, New York City...
speaker_heading: END OF TEASER
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 6.
speaker_heading: ACT ONE
scene_heading: INT. 6TH PRECINCT, DETECTIVE BUREAU - DAY
text: A large open room, filled with about a dozen or so desks
text: all groaning under stacks of paperwork. File cabinets line
text: the walls. Dry erase boards list active cases.
text: It's a typically busy day and the bureau is filled with the
text: usual gathering of UNIFORMED COPS, PLAIN CLOTHES DETECTIVES
text: and A MOTLEY CREW OF SUSPECTS. But as the camera pans through
text: the room, we see there is something very different about a
dialog: few of the civilians:
text: A MAN, dressed in a business suit, answering a detective's
text: questions, has YELLOW EYES WITH OVAL CAT-LIKE PUPILS.
dialog: (A Shapeshifter )
text: A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN gives a tearful statement to another
text: detective. She absentmindedly pushes back her long blonde
text: hair to reveal AN EAR WITH A POINTED TIP (A Fairy).
text: A STOCKY AND OVERLY HAIRY MAN in handcuffs, complains angrily
text: as he's led to a holding cell. (A Troll)
text: The Camera finds Alex and Darnell as they enter and cross
text: paths with DETECTIVE STERN, a career cop so horribly obnoxious
dialog: he should be in parking enforcement.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: Hey, Cantara, heard another
text: bloodsucker bit the dust.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'll be sure to extend your sympathies
dialog: to his family.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: Don't get all snotty. Just cause
dialog: I've got a real job and you're stuck
dialog: chasing night crawlers
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: A crime is a crime, Stern. Everyone's
dialog: equal under the law.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: I remember a time when you didn't
dialog: give a rat's ass about non-Human
dialog: rights, Darnell.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: Things change.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: Guess you should know.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 7.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm just surprised she talked you
dialog: into joining the SCD. Didn't the K-
dialog: 9 Unit have an open spot?
text: Darnell moves toward Stern like he's going to clock him one,
text: but Alex quickly steps between the two men.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (to Darnell)
dialog: Go pull the paperwork on the first
dialog: dead vampire.
text: As Darnell moves off, Alex gives Stern a filthy look that
text: sends him on his way too.
text: Alex continues on through the room, but this exchange hasn't
text: escaped the attention of CHIEF ALBERT KINCAID, a been there,
text: seen that, cop in his late forties. Dealing more with
text: politicians than criminals now, his waistline has softened,
dialog: his fixity of purpose has not.
text: He intercepts Alex and they continue walking together
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: You want me to talk to Stern?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Don't waste the oxygen.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I need you to shut down the Canal
dialog: Street Blood Bank. I've got a Vampire
dialog: who died after ingesting blood from
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: Closing the bank is going to make
dialog: people very nervous.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Well, it's making me nervous too.
dialog: (lowering her voice)
dialog: The Vampire today looked a lot like
dialog: the one we found last week.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: And you think there's something in
dialog: the city's blood supply?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: It's possible.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: All right. I'll make the call. But
dialog: this is going to bring a lot of heat
dialog: down on us.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 8.
speaker_heading: KINCAID (CONT'D)
dialog: Just rumors of tainted blood will
text: start a panic. It's hard enough to
dialog: get Humans and Vampires to trust
dialog: each other in the best of times.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I can handle it.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: Alex, I've known you since you were
dialog: sixteen and I've never heard you say
dialog: anything but 'I can handle it'.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: And I always do.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: But you don't have to do it all by
dialog: yourself. Why can't you admit
dialog: sometimes you need help?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: From some bigoted jar-head like Stern?
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: Don't worry, I don't think Stern's
text: volunteering. In fact, no one is.
dialog: You need another cop on your squad,
dialog: Alex. Have you thought any more
dialog: about Detective Fletcher?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: The guy from Phoenix?
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: He's a first rate cop and willing to
dialog: transfer to New York just to work
dialog: with you on the SCD.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: Ask him yourself.
scene_heading: INT. 6TH PRECINCT, KINCAID'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Kincaid opens the door to his office and strides in. Alex
text: follows to find CAMPBELL FLETCHER waiting.
text: Campbell is a very handsome man in his late twenties with an
text: athletic build and the cocky stance of someone very sure of
dialog: himself and his abilities.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: Detective Campbell Fletcher meet
dialog: Detective Alexandra Cantara, head of
dialog: the Supernatural Crimes Division.
text: As Kincaid takes a seat behind his desk, Campbell extends a
dialog: hand to Alex.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (turning on the charm)
dialog: I've heard a lot about you, Detective.
text: He gives Alex a smile, it's a charming smile, but Alex is
text: really not in the mood to be charmed. So, she ignores him.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: When I set up this squad you promised
dialog: no interference.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: I said minimal interference.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Hiring people behind my back is major
text: Major interference.
text: Campbell gives a little wave to get their attention.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Hello? I'm sitting right here.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Detective Fletcher, do you have any
dialog: idea what you're signing up for?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: As a matter of fact I do. Before I
dialog: joined the force in Phoenix, I got
dialog: my Master's degree in preternatural
dialog: sociology. I've done extensive
dialog: studies in non-Human criminology...
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: And how many non-Humans did you
dialog: actually encounter out there in sunny
dialog: Arizona?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Not many, but that's why I'm here.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: That's what I thought.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I'm sensing a lot of hostility.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 10.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Wrong, Detective. What you're sensing
dialog: is skepticism. I don't meet many
dialog: cops so willing to volunteer for
dialog: "Spook Squad" duty.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Obviously you volunteered.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: He's got a point.
text: Alex can't believe Kincaid has blindsided her like this.
text: They lock eyes. Alex realizes this is a fight she won't
dialog: win.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (to Campbell)
dialog: Fine, but this is my game. You play
dialog: by my rules.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Got it.
text: Campbell exits. As Alex also leaves, Kincaid stops her.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: You can't run this show all by
dialog: yourself, Alex. I'm ordering you to
dialog: give him a chance.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: A chance to get himself killed?
text: She slams the door behind her
scene_heading: INT. 6TH PRECINCT, AUTOPSY ROOM #2 - LATER
text: Alex and Campbell enter to find DOCTOR RICHARD HUNTER pulling
text: on a latex glove. He stands in front of an examination table
text: on which Tony's naked body lays. An ARRAY of SURGICAL
text: IMPLEMENTS, some familiar some not, rest on a nearby tray.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Hey Doc.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Alex. I thought Darnell was coming
dialog: down?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Why should he have all the fun?
dialog: This is Detective Fletcher. He's
dialog: going to be working with us on this
dialog: case. Fletcher, this is Doctor
dialog: Hunter, best coroner in the city.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 11.
text: Hunter nods hello, but Campbell only has eyes for Tony's
text: corpse. In death, Tony's mouth hangs slightly open and the
text: tips of his fangs glint in the overhead light.
text: Hunter reaches down and pulls Tony's lips back to reveal
dialog: even more fang.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: I took a dental mold to confirm his
dialog: I.D. Bite imprint matches Tony
dialog: Butler's registration records.
text: Hunter closes Tony's mouth again and snaps on a second glove.
speaker_heading: HUNTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Ever attended a Vampire autopsy
dialog: before, Detective Fletcher?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (not worried)
dialog: First time for everything.
text: Hunter shoots Alexandra a look as he picks up a very sharp
speaker_heading: SCALPEL.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Don't worry, doc. Fletcher here has
dialog: a masters degree in preternatural
dialog: anthropology.
text: Hunter shrugs and brings the scalpel to Tony's chest. He
text: presses down to make the first cut and...
text: Suddenly, Tony's body CONVULSES and a THICK STREAM OF BLACK
text: GOO ERUPTS from the incision, bubbling up like a mini-geyser
text: before falling back onto his chest with a squishy SPLAT.
text: Campbell turns green, in fact, a number of different greens
text: each shade more and more impressively sickly, but he holds
text: his ground. Dr. Hunter looks at him knowingly,
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: The first cut's the deepest.
text: Just a little Coroner humor and Alex brings her hand to her
text: mouth to keep from laughing at Campbell's reaction.
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: It's bad form to puke on the corpse.
text: Campbell swallows a few times.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: What is that stuff?
text: Hunter takes a long cotton swab of the equipment tray and
text: dips the end into the black goo.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 12.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: It's the virus that turns Humans
dialog: into Vampires.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (back on solid ground)
dialog: Once introduced, the virus completely
dialog: overwhelms the Human immune system,
text: re-creating the host in its own image,
dialog: until, viola, you're a Vampire.
text: Hunter smears a small glass slide with the swab and moves to
text: a nearby microscope. Placing the slide on the stage, he
text: peers through the eyepiece.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
text: A very painful process.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: And a purposeful one. A Vampire has
dialog: to choose to infect the Human and
dialog: there's no guarantee the Human will
dialog: even survive the transformation.
speaker_heading: MICROSCOPIC VIEW
dialog: 
text: The Vampire Virus in the goo resembles Human blood cells
text: but the platelets are black with a slightly different
text: geometry. We see a BACTERIUM smother one of the healthy
text: Vampire blood cells, destroying it.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: I found the same blood-borne infection
dialog: in the Vampire you brought in last
dialog: week. Some kind of bacterial toxin
dialog: that suffocates healthy Vampire
dialog: hemoglobin.
text: Alex takes a look under the microscope.
speaker_heading: HUNTER (CONT'D)
text: It was also present in the empty bag
dialog: you found, but in a dormant state.
text: It doesn't seem to attack Human
dialog: hemoglobin, just Vampire.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: And our first victim was found in
text: his apartment with a half-empty cup
text: of blood next to him.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Could it have gotten into the blood
dialog: supply by accident?
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 13.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: All the blood distributed by the
dialog: blood banks is cloned from genetically
dialog: altered cells resistant to toxemia.
dialog: This had to be introduced later.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: So it was deliberate.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: I'm sending samples to the National
dialog: Preternatural Sciences Lab in D.C.
dialog: for further testing.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Doc...
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Alex, you don't have to tell me you
dialog: need the results yesterday.
scene_heading: INT. 6TH PRECINCT, SCD OFFICES - DAY
text: Alex, Kincaid, Darnell and Campbell sit around a conference
text: table. Case files and papers are strewn amongst styrofoam
text: coffee cups and soda cans.
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: Two victims dead after drinking
dialog: contaminated blood from the city's
dialog: blood supply.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: Victim number one, John Knox. Made
text: a withdrawal from the East 70th Street
dialog: Blood Bank the night he died. Victim
dialog: number two, Tony Butler. Got his
dialog: blood from the Canal Street Bank
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Anything to connect them?
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: Just that they were Vampires. Tony
dialog: was an unemployed "actor" who arrived
dialog: in New York a few weeks ago. Knox
dialog: was an investment strategist who
dialog: lived on the Upper East Side. I talked
text: to Knox's neighbors and co-workers.
dialog: Guy didn't socialize much, rarely
text: strayed south of the Plaza Hotel.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What about the full bag of blood we
dialog: found next to Tony?
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 14.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
text: Pulled a usable print and checked it
dialog: against the registry.
text: Darnell refers to a piece of paper in front of him.
speaker_heading: DARNELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Withdrawn by one Jimmy Patterson
dialog: same time Tony was there. But it
dialog: tested clean. No toxin.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: He didn't stick around, try to help
dialog: a fellow Vampire?
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: He probably just freaked. Jimmy's a
dialog: minor league punk recently turned
text: Vamp. Petty criminal with a couple
dialog: of outstanding warrants.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: A lot of Vampires still don't trust
dialog: the police.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: I got an APB out on him.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: Tell 'em to keep a low profile. I
dialog: want to keep a lid on this as long
dialog: possible.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: If there's no connection between our
dialog: victims, the poisonings were random.
dialog: Done by someone who wasn't too
dialog: particular about their target.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: We got a lot of hate groups out there.
dialog: Start digging, see who could pull
dialog: something like this off.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: I'm on it.
text: Darnell gathers up his files and heads out. Kincaid's CELL
speaker_heading: PHONE RINGS.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Kincaid.
dialog: (listens)
dialog: Right.
text: He hangs up and looks at Alex.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 15.
speaker_heading: KINCAID (CONT'D)
dialog: Next problem.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CITY HALL - AFTERNOON
text: Alex and Campbell exit their car and find themselves in the
text: middle of a chaotic HUMAN'S FIRST RALLY. Hundreds of people
text: surround City Hall. Some carry signs: "NON-HUMANS = NON-
scene_heading: PEOPLE"; "HUMANS FIRST, HUMANS ONLY"; "REPEAL THE NON-HUMAN
text: CIVIL RIGHTS ACT NOW!!". Police barricades have established
text: a perimeter to keep the Human Protesters away from a vocal
text: and growing number of non-Human counter-protesters. AS
text: slogans are chanted and slurs thrown back and forth, anger
text: on both sides builds, threatening to boil over at any moment.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Humans First is a New York-based
dialog: group...
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: ...O0f racists who believe all non-
dialog: Humans should be exterminated.
text: As Alex looks approvingly at Campbell.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You have done your homework
text: As Alex and Campbell wade through the crowd, they're
text: approached by CHASE DESMOND, a stunning woman in her late
text: twenties, a sexy, professional, dresser who knows how to get
text: what she wants. A PRESS BADGE hangs around her neck.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Hey Alex.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Detective Campbell Fletcher this is
dialog: Chase Desmond, a reporter for the
dialog: Times.
text: Campbell smiles warmly at this alluring woman.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: You cover a lot of these protests?
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Unfortunately they're news.
text: A commotion in the crowd draws Chase's attention.
speaker_heading: CHASE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll catch you later.
text: As Chase disappears into the crowd, Alex catches sight of
text: two men making their way toward her.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 16.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Wonderful.
text: JACK KEMP, a charismatic, Donald Trump-like businessman in
text: his 50s approaches. He is trailed by MARK DALI, 30s, a smarmy
text: corporate type with a permanent smirk on his handsome, but
text: cold face.
speaker_heading: KEMP.
dialog: Alex, darling, how are you? It's
dialog: been far too long...
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Not long enough, Jack.
dialog: (to Campbell)
dialog: This is Jack Kemp, head of the Humans
dialog: First movement and Mark Dali, his
dialog: lap dog.
text: Dali bristles.
speaker_heading: DALI
dialog: This is a legitimate gathering,
dialog: Detective Cantara. We're protected
dialog: by the First Amendment.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: And non-Humans are protected by the
dialog: 28th Amendment.
speaker_heading: DALI
dialog: The Non-Humans Civil Rights Act should
dialog: never have been passed. And we'll
dialog: do everything in our power to repeal
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Not going to happen today, Dali.
dialog: (to Kemp)
dialog: What's all this about, Jack?
speaker_heading: KEMP.
dialog: The Human community is very concerned
dialog: about the two Vampires recently
dialog: killed. Concerned the Vampires will
dialog: use them as an excuse to return to
dialog: their old ways.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: The second Vampire died less than
dialog: twelve hours ago. No one has had
dialog: time to get very concerned. Unless
dialog: Humans First somehow anticipated it
dialog: happening?
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 17.
speaker_heading: DALI
dialog: How dare you! Mr. Kemp is a highly
dialog: respected community leader...
speaker_heading: KEMP.
dialog: It's alright, Mark, I'm sure Alex
dialog: didn't mean anything. She's always
dialog: been very passionate about her causes.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You're using those dead Vampires to
text: spread fear and paranoia.
speaker_heading: KEMP.
dialog: If the NYPD is going to continue
dialog: putting the rights of "Monsters"
dialog: ahead of Humans, it's up to people
dialog: like me to ensure the Human majority
text: has a voice.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Even if that voice calls for the
dialog: slaughter of all non-Humans?
speaker_heading: KEMP.
dialog: I didn't get your name, Detective?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Fletcher, Campbell Fletcher.
speaker_heading: KEMP.
text: A word of advice, Detective Fletcher.
dialog: A battle is coming, choose your side
dialog: very carefully.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
text: Campbell drives, Alex, lost in thought, in the passenger
dialog: seat.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: What's the story with you and Kemp?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: He was friends with my parents.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: But your mother and father were on
dialog: the front lines of the Non-Human
dialog: Civil Rights Movement?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: And Kemp's one of the planet's biggest
dialog: bigots? The irony isn't lost on me.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 18.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Your parents' study on Non-Human
dialog: Integration was one of the primary
dialog: sources for my Master's thesis.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm sorry about what happened to
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: It was a long time ago.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: And the police never found their
dialog: killers? That must be hard.
text: Campbell's compassion prompts Alex to make an unexpected
dialog: admission.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yeah. It was... It still is.
text: Alex looks at Campbell's profile for a long moment. Campbell
text: turns to see the carefully guarded pain in Alex's eyes.
text: There's a spark of a connection, but Alex breaks it...
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: Pull over up here. There's someone
dialog: I need to talk to.
text: As Campbell pulls the car to the curb
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Need some back-up?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Good night, Fletcher.
text: Alex exits the car in front of...
scene_heading: EXT. CLUB CARNAGE - CONTINUOUS
text: Stretching down the block is a red velvet rope holding in
text: check a long line of HOPEFUL ENTRANTS. A CROWD OF YOUNG,
text: CLUBBY TYPES are ignoring the queue, posing for the
text: unimpressed BOUNCER who stands in the doorway.
text: Alex moves confidently toward the club's entrance. She
text: bypasses the line and walks right up to the door. The Bouncer
text: doesn't speak, but to the chagrin of the posers, he moves
text: aside to let her pass. As she enters, we see a BRASS PLAQUE
text: on the door. It reads: CLUB CARNAGE.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Instead of leaving, Campbell watches Alex in his rear view
text: mirror until he sees Alex go inside the club. Then he pulls
text: the car over and parks.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 19.
scene_heading: INT. CLUB CARNAGE, LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: The décor of the main room is minimalist hipster cool. Sexy
text: shades of cobalt and purple dominate. Scandinavian designed
text: light fixtures cast a warm glow on the patrons. Low slung
text: modern couches are packed with drinkers. Another, larger
text: room has a DJ booth and dance floor filled with dancers.
text: Alex moves purposefully through the crowd to the bar.
speaker_heading: AT THE BAR
text: Alex sits down on a stool and almost immediately a very dry,
text: Belvedere vodka martini with two olives is placed before her
text: by the beautiful, young, female BARTENDER.
text: Alex acknowledges it with a smile. As she raises her drink
text: to take a sip, a man suddenly appears behind her, whispers
text: in her ear...
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: Hello, Sasha
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (without turning)
dialog: Hello, Christien.
text: We get our first look at CHRISTIEN as he sits down on the
text: stool next to Alex. He looks so innately dangerous he must
dialog: be non-Human, but so devastating attractive, you don't care.
text: A walking advertisement for the seductive pleasures of
dialog: vampirism,
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: You look lovely as always.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm here on business.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: That doesn't make your company any
dialog: less of a pleasure.
text: Christien reaches out to take Alex's hand. He kisses it
text: with a delicacy that makes Alex unintentionally shiver.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Come to my office. It's quieter.
text: Christen sweeps to his feet and Alex takes a final slug of
text: her drink (for courage?), before following him.
speaker_heading: AT THE ENTRANCE
text: Campbell enters and takes in the scene, looking for Alex.
text: As he makes his way to the bar, the camera pans over to find
dialog: Jimmy (the Vampire from the Teaser).
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 20.
text: Jimmy prowls the room, looking hungry, a little dangerous.
text: He catches the eye of WENDY, a smokin' hot club chick about
text: his age. Jimmy smiles, he's found his hook-up for the night.
speaker_heading: AT THE BAR
text: Campbell makes his way to the bar and grabs a seat.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: What's your poison?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Beer.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: I've never seen you here before.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: You remember all your customers?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Just the cute ones.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I'm new in town.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Yum, fresh meat.
text: The Bartender places the beer in front of Campbell and smiles
text: while EXTENDING TWO VERY SHARP LONG FANGS. Whoa! That was
text: unexpected. Campbell looks around and now sees interspersed
text: with the painted-up human clubbers are Vampires.
text: Ditching his new friend with a somewhat nervous smile,
text: Campbell moves away from the bar and continues his search
dialog: for Alex.
scene_heading: CHRISTIEN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Christien and Alex enter a room, filled with a mix of both
text: modern and antique furniture. Its style is both beautiful
text: and timeless, much like Christien.
text: Alex sits on the sumptuous couch as Christien moves to his
text: personal bar. He pours himself a glass of red wine (or maybe
text: it's blood) from a crystal decanter. As he mixes Alex another
dialog: martini...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: Olives, right?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You know me too well.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: I would say, not nearly well enough.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 21.
text: Christien brings Alex her drink and sits down next to her.
dialog: Anxious to change the subject...
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I assume you've heard about the
dialog: tainted blood?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
text: News travels fast in the Vampire
dialog: community.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: That's what I'm afraid of.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: The police are worried Vampires will
dialog: stop going to the banks and start
dialog: attacking Humans.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Pretty much.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: Well, I'm worried that someone is
dialog: using the blood banks to launch
dialog: unprovoked attacks against my people.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: We're going to find out who's
dialog: responsible.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: Forgive me if I find it hard to
dialog: believe the police are giving this
dialog: top priority.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm giving it top priority. But I
dialog: need your help. As leader of the
dialog: Vampire community in New York, you
dialog: have the power to keep this contained.
dialog: We've already shut down two banks
dialog: and we're running tests at the others.
dialog: Tell your people not to hunt.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: They're scared, they may not listen.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Oh, please. There isn't a Vampire
dialog: in this City that would dare disobey
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: And in return for my help?
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 22.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Preventing an all out war between
dialog: Humans and Vampires isn't enough?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Fine. What do you want?
text: Christien just sits, staring at Alex. She wonders what he's
dialog: thinking. She's sure she wouldn't like it. Well, not sure
dialog: but pretty sure.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: I'll have to think about it.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Well, don't take too long.
text: Alex stands to leave.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: Christien, until we're sure about
dialog: the blood... Be careful.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: I don't take blood from the banks.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No, I suppose you don't have problems
dialog: finding consensual donors.
text: Particularly of the female persuasion.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: Jealous, Sasha?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Not my scene.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: There are fringe benefits.
text: Alex is sure there are. But their conversation is interrupted
text: when the Bartender runs into the room.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Christien, you better come. There's
dialog: a fight.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: A fight? Here?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: This I have to see.
scene_heading: INT. LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Alex and Christien arrive to find shocked club patrons
text: watching as Campbell and one of Christien's BODYGUARDS
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 23.
text: struggle. Or rather Campbell is struggling, the Bodyguard,
text: is on top of Campbell, PUMMELING him.
text: Alex's GUN is immediately out, cocked and hovering inches
dialog: from the Bodyguard's ear
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Get off him.
text: The Bodyguard looks toward Christien for guidance. Almost
text: too fast for the Human eye to see, Christien GRABS the
text: Bodyguard and YANKS him way from Campbell.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Christien)
dialog: Thanks.
text: Christien casually TOSSES the Bodyguard aside like an empty
text: candy wrapper.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: Good help is so hard to find.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Tell me about it.
text: Campbell bristles at Alex's words and tone.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I thought you might need help.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: If I need help, I'll ask for it.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I doubt that.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I won't tolerate this macho-defender
dialog: crap from you, Fletcher!
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: And I won't tolerate being treated
text: like some wet-behind-the-ears rookie.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Then stop acting like one.
text: They suddenly fall silent as they realize Christien is
text: intently watching their bickering as someone would follow a
dialog: tennis match.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: No please, Sasha, don't stop on my
dialog: account. This is most entertaining.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 24.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Why is it that every Vampire runs a
dialog: nightclub? Don't you think it's a
dialog: little cliché?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: Not many establishments remain open
dialog: all night. Can you see me behind
dialog: the counter at your local Seven-
dialog: Eleven?
text: Campbell's not done with Christien, but Alex cuts him off...
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Thank you for your time, Christien.
text: We don't see him move, but suddenly Christien stands in front
text: of Alex. Looking deep into her eyes...
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: You are welcome here anytime, Sasha
text: He eyes a steaming Campbell.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN (CONT'D)
dialog: But, perhaps you should find a
text: playmate with better manners.
text: Alex quickly ushers Campbell across the room, practically
text: pushing him out an emergency exit door...
scene_heading: EXT. CLUB CARNAGE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Head of Humans First, leader of the
dialog: Vampire Community, you keep some
dialog: pretty funky company, Detective.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Are you purposely trying to get
dialog: yourself killed?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I can take care of myself.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yeah, I could tell by the way you
dialog: got the crap beaten out of you.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Who do you think you are?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Back off.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Why? Tell me why and I will.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 25.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (beyond frustrated)
dialog: Because people who do this job die.
dialog: And I don't want to be responsible
dialog: for that!
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Who died?
text: Alex takes a deep breath. She can't believe she's even
dialog: getting into this. But... there's something about the way
text: Campbell is looking at her. Something that suddenly makes
dialog: her want him to understand.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Mike Wells. We went to the Academy
dialog: together. We were close.
dialog: (smiling sadly)
dialog: He joined the SCD because he believed
dialog: in what I was trying to do. He joined
dialog: because he believed in me.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: We found out someone in the Fairy
dialog: Court was trafficking illegal weapons.
text: Mike went to meet an informant.
dialog: Rangers found him two days later.
text: Dead, entombed in a tree in Central
dialog: Park.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: A tree?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: The Fairies wanted to send a message.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: It's not your fault. He was a cop.
dialog: He knew the score.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: That doesn't make it any easier.
text: For just a moment, there's something in the open, unguarded
text: way she's looking at him that threatens to take Campbell's
text: breath away. But then, it's over, leaving Campbell to wonder
dialog: if it even happened.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: And I won't let it happen again.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 26.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - MUCH LATER THAT NIGHT
dialog: Jimmy and Wendy, the beautiful girl we saw him with earlier,
text: stand in a dark corner of a parking lot down the street from
text: Club Carnage. They're making out against a parked car
text: After a few passionate kisses, Jimmy pulls back.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You know what I want...
text: Wendy pulls her hair back to expose her neck. The white
text: skin almost gleams in the dark.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I'm told I'm very tasty.
text: Jimmy extends his fangs, bites into her jugular. He starts
text: to drink. Ecstasy overcomes them both, until...
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, that's enough, Jimmy.
text: But, Jimmy can't stop. He's too hungry. He continues to
text: greedily suck at Wendy's neck
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm serious. You're taking too much!
text: Wendy tries to squirm away, but Jimmy is too strong. We see
text: his EYES FILL WITH BLOOD.
text: Off Wendy as she begins to SCREAM...
speaker_heading: END OF ACT ONE
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 27.
dialog: ACT Two
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - MORNING
text: UNIFORMS survey the crime scene as Alex and Darnell check
text: out Wendy's body with a CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATOR. Wendy's
text: body has a DISTINCT PALE PALLOR. TWO DEEP PUNCTURE MARKS on
text: her neck are plainly visible.
speaker_heading: cSI
dialog: Judging by rigor and liver temp, I'd
dialog: put time of death around 4 AM. Cause
dialog: of death was exsanguination. She
dialog: was drunk dry.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Get an impression of the puncture
dialog: wounds. Hopefully our perp's dental
text: molds are on file.
text: Alex and Darnell step aside as the CSI signals for a gurney
text: to take the body away.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: It's been months since a Vampire
dialog: killed a Human like this.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I just can't believe it happened so
text: close to the Club.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: Think we're looking for a hungry
dialog: Vamp too scared to go to the blood
dialog: banks?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: A Vampire more scared of the banks
dialog: than he is of Christien? That's
dialog: pretty damn scared. Something isn't
dialog: right here.
text: Darnell looks over to Campbell who's a short distance away
text: talking to a short man.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: How's it going with Fletcher?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: A master's degree is no substitute
dialog: for experience.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: I wasn't exactly an expert in non-
dialog: Humans when you recruited me.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 28.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: That was different and you know it.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: I still think you should cut Campbell
dialog: some slack. We can use all the help
dialog: we can get right now.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I know. I'm trying.
text: At Darnell's look.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: I am.
dialog: (changing the subject)
dialog: Make sure the CSIs get a cast of
dialog: Wendy's puncture wounds. Maybe our
text: perp's fang molds are in the system.
text: Alex moves away.
speaker_heading: WITH CAMPBELL
text: Campbell interrogates a TROLL who stands next to a large
text: garbage dumpster. A makeshift tent made of plastic bags and
text: cardboard, and the clutter around it, indicates the Troll's
dialog: been camping out here for a while.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: You must've seen something.
speaker_heading: TROLL
dialog: We don't like to get involved. This
dialog: is a Human thing, a Vampire thing.
dialog: Not a Troll thing.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I'm going to make this a "Troll thing"
dialog: unless you start cooperating.
speaker_heading: TROLL
dialog: (reluctantly)
dialog: Maybe I saw something.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: The girl and the Vampire?
speaker_heading: TROLL
text: I saw them leave the club. Head off
dialog: together. That's all I remember
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Think you'll remember more down at
dialog: the station?
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 29.
text: After a beat, the Troll reaches into his tent and pulls out
text: a PURSE. Campbell practically grabs it from him.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Is this the girl's purse? Did you
dialog: steal this?
speaker_heading: TROLL
dialog: I found it. Later. After. She
dialog: didn't need it anymore.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Are you kidding me?
text: Alex approaches.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (to the Troll)
dialog: Go see Detective Harvey. Give him
dialog: your Guild Name in case we need to
dialog: talk to you again.
text: The Troll stalks off, mumbling under his breath.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: We should take him in.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Trolls have a very set view of
dialog: "finders-Keepers". He doesn't think
dialog: he did anything wrong.
text: Campbell begins to search the purse's contents.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: This happened just a few hours after
dialog: we left the Club.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Your Vampire friend seemed kind of
dialog: pissed. Could he be involved?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Christien? Not a chance.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And we're not friends.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Then what are you?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: None of your business.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Why does he call you 'Sasha'?
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 30.
speaker_heading: ALEXANDRA
dialog: It's a nickname for Alexandra.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Can I call you Sasha?
speaker_heading: ALEXANDRA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: What makes Christien so special?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Just that he's the oldest, most
dialog: powerful Vampire in New York.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Good point.
text: Campbell pulls an ID out of the purse.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Our dead girl is one Wendy Williams.
dialog: I've got her address.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Take Darnell and check out her
dialog: apartment.
text: Alex's cell phone rings. She opens it.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: This is Detective Cantara.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: This is Bill White from the Canal
dialog: Street Blood Bank. I've been going
dialog: through my records like you asked.
dialog: I think I found something...
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'll be right there.
scene_heading: INT. CANAL STREET BLOOD BANK, HALLWAY - DAY
text: Alex walks with BILL SMITH, a young, ernest, overworked civil
dialog: servant-type who also happens to be a Vampire
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I was going over the delivery invoices
dialog: from last week and I came across
dialog: some discrepancies.
text: He opens the door to...
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 31.
scene_heading: INT. CANAL STREET BLOOD BANK, BILL WHITE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: MARTY GIBSON, a beefy Teamster with an attitude sits
text: impatiently. He doesn't want to be there.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Detective Cantara, this is Marty
dialog: Gibson.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What do you do here, Marty?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I'm a driver.
speaker_heading: BILL
text: Marty picks up the blood bags from
dialog: the processing facilities and
dialog: distributes them to banks throughout
dialog: the city.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I don't know why you're making such
dialog: a big deal out of this. Blood is
dialog: blood. The Vamps don't care where
dialog: they get it.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You Human, Marty?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Yeah. But I don't have a problem
dialog: with Non-Humans if that's where you're
dialog: goin'. Hell, my sister's dating a
dialog: Shifty. Had him over for barbecue
dialog: just last week.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: How very PC of you.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: We're supposed to receive our allotted
dialog: supply of blood from the processing
dialog: facility in Trenton every Thursday.
dialog: Last week, Marty didn't make his
text: pick-up.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What happened Marty?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I was running behind. You know what
dialog: the traffic's like going through the
dialog: tunnel? I wasn't going to make my
dialog: day.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: So, you gave us blood meant for the
dialog: Morningside Heights Bank.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I made it up on my next run. It's
dialog: not like there was going to be run
dialog: on the stuff. Not with everything
dialog: that's been going on.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Was the blood that killed Tony Butler
dialog: from that batch?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (to Marty)
dialog: Where'd you pick-up the blood you
dialog: delivered here?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: The plant out in Queens.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (to Bill)
dialog: What other banks does that facility
dialog: supply to?
text: Bill takes a clipboard from his desk. Flips through the
dialog: pages...
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Morningside Heights, Times Square,
dialog: East 70th Street...
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: The East 70th Street Bank? That's
dialog: where the first victim got his blood.
text: Both Knox and Tony's blood came from
dialog: the same plant...
scene_heading: INT. WENDY WILLIAMS APARTMENT - DAY
dialog: 32.
text: A typically tiny New York apartment shared by two young women.
text: Ikea, futons, more clothes than closet space.
text: Campbell sits on a small futon couch with Wendy's roommate,
text: SHANNON KELLY, an adorable girl in her early 20s.
text: She gazes deeply into Campbell's eyes as he desperately tries
dialog: to remember the questions he's supposed to be asking her
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Anyway, Ms. Kelly, we were hoping...
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 33.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Please, call me Shannon.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Shannon. That's a beautiful name.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: You're sweet.
text: Shannon puts a hand on Campbell's thigh and he breaks into a
dialog: sweat.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Thanks. But, um, we really need to
dialog: ask you some questions about Wendy.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Wouldn't you rather talk about me?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Or, maybe you could tell me a little
dialog: about you.
text: Campbell moves a little closer to Shannon. He's practically
text: panting. Darnell enters from the back bedroom.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: (matter of fact)
dialog: Quit it with the Glamour Shannon.
dialog: (to Campbell)
dialog: She's a Fairy. Using mind tricks to
dialog: seduce you.
text: Shannon breaks eye contact with Campbell who startles as if
text: suddenly woken from a day-dream, a very erotic daydream.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I was just messing around.
text: As Campbell collects himself.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: You don't seem too upset about your
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: She wasn't my friend, just my
dialog: roommate. Besides I warned her
dialog: told her it was just a matter of
dialog: time. Wendy was always picking up
text: Vamps. She was starting to look
text: like a Human pincushion.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: She let them bite her?
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 34.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: She was totally into it. Said it was
dialog: great buzz.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: Was Wendy trying to become a Vampire?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: No, I don't think she wanted to take
dialog: it that far.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY
text: Campbell and Darnell head back to their car.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Sorry about that in there. The

dialog: do that to me before.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: (knowingly)
dialog: You liked it, didn't you?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: It was... intense.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: I almost woke up married once. But

speaker_heading: DARNELL

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I can't imagine letting someone do
dialog: that to me.
speaker_heading: DARNELL

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL

scene_heading: INT. BLOOD PROCESSING FACILITY - DAY
text: Alex and the FACILITY'S MANAGER, CURT SMITH, a 30-ish, shirt
dialog: and tie, put-upon managerial-type, tour the high-tech blood
text: processing facility. SECURITY CAMERAS are omnipresent, as
text: are ARMED SECURITY GUARDS. Every person they pass wears a
scene_heading: SECURITY BADGE.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I've got two dead Vampires who drank
dialog: tainted blood processed at this
dialog: facility.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: We process over one thousand pints
dialog: of blood a day.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: And it's all cloned here on site?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Yes, we extract the key elements of
dialog: human plasma from the milk of cows
dialog: that have had their plasma genes
dialog: replaced with human ones.
scene_heading: BLOOD CLONING LAB
text: Lab technicians dressed in medical scrubs, wearing protective
text: goggles, masks and gloves work extracting the compounds to
dialog: clone blood.
speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Of course, the cows don't live here.
dialog: But, the genetically altered milk is
dialog: brought here and the essential
dialog: proteins extracted to grow the cloned
dialog: plasma.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I assume your employees are carefully
dialog: screened?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: You'd have an easier time getting a
dialog: job with the CIA.
scene_heading: BLOOD PROCESSING LAB
text: More TECHNICIANS supervise the BLOOD ANALYSIS PROCESS. This

dialog: the blood.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 36.
speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)
text: Every drop of blood is purified before
dialog: it's packaged.
speaker_heading: BLOOD PACKAGING
text: Technicians man the BLOOD PACKAGING EQUIPMENT. Picture a
text: high-tech version of a bottling plant, with blood flowing
text: into individual plastic bags, which are sealed and bar coded.
speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Each bag of blood individually sealed
text: and bar coded.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: How are requests from the blood banks
dialog: processed?
speaker_heading: BLOOD STORAGE
text: A large warehouse space. Armed guards stand ready. A robotic
text: arm moves along the shelves of stored blood, before stopping
text: and removing a container of individual blood bags.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: By computer. Requests are submitted
text: and an automated system pulls blood
dialog: lots for dispatch.
speaker_heading: SMITH'S OFFICE
text: What it lacks in personality it makes up for in functionality.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: And the blood lots are distributed
dialog: randomly based on individual blood
dialog: bank requests?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: It's what guarantees freshness.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Who's the last person to handle the
dialog: blood before it leaves for the banks?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: That would be me. As the Senior
dialog: Facility Manager, I supervise
dialog: everything from beginning to end.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Then how did the toxin get into the
dialog: blood without you knowing about it?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: I have no idea.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 37.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You can understand why that makes
dialog: you rather suspicious.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: You think I'm responsible for the
dialog: poisonings?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You had the opportunity. Motive, I
dialog: don't know? Maybe you've got
dialog: something against Vampires. Maybe
dialog: Humans First put you up to it?
text: A smile plays across Smith's lips.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Believe me, I know.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: You think Jack Kemp's Humans First

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You know I can't comment on an on-

speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: I've got a source who says Christien
text: is losing control of the Vampires.
dialog: They're ready to hit the streets
dialog: whether he likes it or not.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You can't go public with that.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 38.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: The public has a right to know if a

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Chase, whoever is doing this is
dialog: looking for publicity. Wants Humans
dialog: and Vampires afraid of each other.
dialog: Don't play into their hands.
text: Chase thinks about it for a long moment.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Nothing's confirmed yet. I'll sit
text: on it until it is.
dialog: (sweetly)
dialog: If you promise me a scoop.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Don't even think about trying to
dialog: glam me. I'm so not in the mood.
text: Chase pushes her hair back and we see the pointed ear, she's
dialog: a Fairy.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Damn you're cranky. Fine, enough
dialog: business. As a friend, what can I
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Besides the Vampires, what are the
dialog: other non-Humans thinking? Anything
dialog: going on I don't know about?
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Everyone's just mostly waiting to
dialog: see how it plays out. Consensus is
dialog: that Humans First is behind it and
dialog: they won't stop with the Vampires.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yeah, Darnell's been tracking the
dialog: hate groups. Humans First is the
dialog: only one organized enough to put
dialog: something like this together.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: A year ago, I wouldn't have thought
dialog: Kemp would try anything this extreme.
dialog: But ever since he hired Dali...
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Dali's got an ego, that's for sure.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: You know him?
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 39.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: I did a piece on him right after he

speaker_heading: DALI

speaker_heading: RICH
dialog: Meanwhile, we just sit here?
speaker_heading: DALI
dialog: I didn't say that. How would you

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Always.
speaker_heading: DALI

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: I'm getting a lot of pressure to
dialog: call for a boycott of the blood banks.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm getting squeezed too. Kemp and
dialog: Dali are turning this into a media
text: circus. Wendy's parents are pushing
dialog: the Mayor for a "Stake 'em first
dialog: ask questions later" investigation
dialog: into their daughter's death.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: I will find out which Vampire dared
dialog: to defy me and deal with him.
dialog: Personally.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No, that's my job.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: There are Human matters and there

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I don't know what you're talking

scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 42.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I think you do.

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (panicked)
dialog: Look, okay, I'm sorry. I took too
dialog: much but I couldn't help it. I was
dialog: so hungry. You gotta believe me
dialog: man, it was an accident...
text: Jimmy's words fall on deaf ears. Jeff and Rich POUNCE on
text: Jimmy, sending him sprawling to the ground.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: This is for Wendy.
text: Rich DRIVES the stake through Jimmy's heart, killing him
text: instantly. Darnell and Campbell pull guns as they run.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: Police! Drop it!
text: But he can't get a shot, it's too dark. Jeff and Rich ignore

text: Darnell takes one look at the Vampire.
speaker_heading: DARNELL (CONT'D)
text: He's gone.
text: They take off again after Jeff and Rich who have a pretty
dialog: good head start on our people. It doesn't look we'll be
dialog: able to catch up with them, until...
text: Mid-stride, DARNELL's body transforms as he SHAPESHIFTS INTO
text: A WEREWOLF. His eyes turn YELLOW as his jaw lengthens to
text: accommodate a set of LARGE, GNASHING, CANINE TEETH. His
text: arms and legs bulge with growing muscular bulk and his skin
text: sprouts heavy, coarse hair.
text: Now, a hybrid creature of RIPPLING MUSCLE and SLASHING CLAWS,

scene_heading: EXT. PARK - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: RICH

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: How did these two losers know that
dialog: before we did?
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: Humans First must've sent them out.
dialog: Kemp knows killing Jimmy would get

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: But who gave Kemp his info? Nobody
dialog: in the Vampire community would give
dialog: up Jimmy to Kemp, that's for sure.
speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: He's getting him information from
dialog: somewhere.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: This whole thing is starting to feel
dialog: very orchestrated. The poisonings,

dialog: a connection we're not seeing.
scene_heading: INT. 6TH PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY
text: Kincaid intercepts Alex.
speaker_heading: KINCAID

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: KINCAID

dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: What does it mean?
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: How'd it happen?
speaker_heading: DARNELL

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Is that how you ended up in the SCD?
speaker_heading: DARNELL

speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: Well, that sure clears everything

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL

speaker_heading: DARNELL
dialog: Smith's not in the National Non-Human

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL

speaker_heading: KEMP.
dialog: Study the Vampire and Shapeshifter

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL

dialog: appointment I don't want to be late
dialog: for.
text: As Dali exits, Curt smiles widely, revealing his sharp fangs.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: My pleasure.
text: A beat later, Alex and Campbell enter Dali's office, guns
dialog: drawn.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Nothing stupid, Smith. Get down on
dialog: the ground. NOW!
text: In the blink of an eye, Smith GOES FULL VAMP (fangs extended,
text: eyes blood red) and LAUNCHES himself at Alex and Campbell.
text: Campbell OPENS FIRES. The bullets STRIKE Smith, but barely
text: slow him down.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Campbell)
dialog: He's too old, bullets won't stop
dialog: him.
text: Smith POUNCES on Campbell, quickly taking Campbell to the
text: ground. Campbell fights back, landing VICIOUS BLOWS to
text: Smith's neck and face. A blow connects with Smith's nose,
text: spraying Campbell with BLOOD.
text: Alex reaches inside her jacket and pulls out A SMALL SILVER
text: CYLINDER. With a TWIST OF HER WRIST, the cylinder EXTENDS
text: to become a HIGH-TECH STAKE.
text: Campbell struggles with all his strength to keep Smith's
text: fangs away from his neck. But he loses his grip and Smith's
text: fangs descend....
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 52.
text: Smith BITES Campbell just as Alex PLUNGES her stake into
text: Smith's back and PIERCES HIS HEART. Smith falls DEAD on top
dialog: of Campbell.
text: Alex yanks Smith's body off Campbell and drops it heavily to
dialog: the ground.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: You all right?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (re: Alex's stake)
dialog: How do I requisition one of those?
text: Campbell holds his neck where he was bitten.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Let me see.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I think he nicked me.
text: Alex moves Campbell's hand to find an UGLY GASH on Campbell's
text: neck where Smith's fangs had ripped the skin. We see
text: Campbell's bright red blood on Alex's hand as she pulls a
text: handkerchief out of her pocket and carefully presses it to
dialog: the wound.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: That's more than a nick. But he
text: missed the jugular.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I don't think he had a chance to
dialog: infect me with the virus.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No, he was trying to kill you, not
dialog: turn you.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I'll get tested anyway. Just to be
dialog: sure.
text: Alex helps Campbell up. He's pale, but steady on his feet.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You sure you're okay? Should we
dialog: call the EMTs?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I'm fine. All in a day's work.
text: Alex knows he's putting on a brave front for her, but she's
text: impressed anyway. She reaches out to wipe a splatter of
text: blood from Campbell's face.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 53.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Not bad, Fletcher. A lot of people
dialog: would've really freaked out.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Don't go all soft on me now,
dialog: Detective. We still have work to
dialog: do.
text: Alex and Campbell move to Dali's desk and begin searching
text: it. Campbell spots Dali's discarded teeth caps.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
dialog: What are these?
text: Alex takes the small pieces of white porcelain from Campbell.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Caps. Dali must've used them to
text: hide his fangs.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Why'd he leave them?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: He must think he doesn't need them
dialog: anymore. Doesn't need to hide.
text: Campbell moves to Smith's body. He begins to riffle through
text: Smith pockets. Campbell pulls out a FEW FOLDED SHEETS OF
speaker_heading: PAPER.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Alex, look at this.
text: Campbell shows her the papers.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Shipping orders from the Blood
text: Processing Facility. Poisoned blood
dialog: is being sent all over the city
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: But why is Dali doing this? why
dialog: does he want Humans and Vampires
dialog: fighting each other? What does he
dialog: get out of it?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: It's a power play. By poisoning the
dialog: blood supply, Dali's convinced the
dialog: Vampires they're not safe anymore.
dialog: He's going to use their fear to turn
dialog: them against Christien.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 54.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Dali wants to become the new leader
dialog: of the Vampires?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Which means the only person standing
dialog: in his way now is...
text: Alex pulls out her cell phone and dials.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, Christien pick up. Pick
dialog: up!
text: Alex snaps her phone closed and hands Campbell the shipping
dialog: lists.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: Take these lists to Kincaid. Tell
dialog: him to rally every cop in the city.
dialog: If we don't stop this tainted blood
dialog: from getting to the blood banks, New
text: York is going to become a war zone.
dialog: Off Alex...
speaker_heading: END OF ACT THREE
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 55.
speaker_heading: ACT FOUR
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - EVENING
text: At VARIOUS LOCATIONS around the City, a frantic and massive
text: police operation is under way.
text: CAMPBELL leads a TEAM OF UNIFORMED OFFICERS into a Blood
text: Bank, where a truck is in the middle of off-loading its supply
dialog: of tainted blood.
text: DARNELL, behind the wheel of an unmarked police car with
text: lights flashing, SKIDS to a STOP in front of a BLOOD TRANSFER
text: TRUCK. He leaps out of the car, badge in one hand, gun in
dialog: the other.
text: KINCAID leads a fleet of BLACK AND WHITES, LIGHTS FLASHING
text: AND SIRENS BLARING, as they intercept other BLOOD TRANSFER
text: TRUCKS .
text: Unsuspecting DRIVERS are pulled from their trucks at gun
text: point, as OFFICERS secure their deadly payloads.
scene_heading: INT. CLUB CARNAGE, LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: Alex enters to find the Club dark, empty, and all too quiet.
text: She draws her weapon.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Christien?!
text: No answer. Alex cocks her gun.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: Christien? Are you here?
text: Alex's senses are on fire, she's not frightened, just focused.
text: Something moves in the deep shadows across the room. Alex
text: sees it and trains her gun in that direction.
speaker_heading: DALI (0.S.)
dialog: I'm afraid it's just me.
text: Dali emerges from the shadows.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Stop right there.
text: Dali doesn't stop. He continues to walk toward Alex.
speaker_heading: DALI
dialog: Or what? You'll shoot me? Do you
dialog: think your bullets can kill me?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I think they'll hurt. A lot.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 56.
speaker_heading: DALI
dialog: I'm not afraid of a little pain. In
dialog: fact, I might enjoy it.
text: Keeping her gun trained on Dali, she reaches into her pocket
text: with her other hand and finds her stake. She extends it.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: How'd you enjoy your time with Humans
dialog: First?
speaker_heading: DALI
dialog: I laughed myself to sleep every night.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: How could you pass for Human for so
dialog: long? I saw you at the Rally. You
text: were standing in broad daylight.
speaker_heading: DALI
dialog: I have lived many years, Alex. More
dialog: even than your friend Christien.
dialog: There are only a handful of us in
dialog: the world and we are very, very
dialog: powerful.
text: Dali is getting entirely too close. Alex doesn't want to
dialog: give up ground, but she doesn't want to have to fight this
dialog: fucker either.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What do you want?
text: Dali circles Alex, studying her, careful to stay just out of
text: reach of her stake. Just in case.
speaker_heading: DALI
dialog: I've decided to get into politics.
dialog: As many of your Human leaders have
dialog: proven, there's no better way to
dialog: consolidate power than to start a
dialog: war.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I can't let you do that.
speaker_heading: DALI
dialog: I am a Sanguis Vestus. You can't
dialog: stop me.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I don't care if you're the Queen of
dialog: the Damned, this is my City.
text: Alex suddenly draws in a SHORT STARTLED BREATH as she feels
text: another PRESENCE in the room.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 57.
text: The Camera finds Christien, who has appeared as if out of
text: thin air.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: No, it's mine.
text: The air crackles with tension, there's an energy that's almost
text: palpable.
speaker_heading: DALI
dialog: You had your chance to lead Christien.
dialog: But you sold your people out,
text: pandering to the Humans, subjugating
dialog: yourself to their laws.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Those laws keep the peace.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: Stay out of this Alex.
dialog: (to Dali)
dialog: We have laws too, Dali. And you've
dialog: broken them. Killed your own kind
dialog: by poisoning their blood.
speaker_heading: DALI
dialog: Cloned blood from banks? Vampires
dialog: have become nothing but pigs feeding
dialog: at the Humans' trough. I will return
dialog: the Vampire Community to prominence.
dialog: No more blood banks. No more living
dialog: in fear of Humans and their laws.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: You're talking about starting a war.
speaker_heading: DALI
text: One that's been long overdue.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: One we may not win.
speaker_heading: DALI
dialog: You just don't have the stomach for
dialog: it.
text: Christien just smiles. It's a smile that promises death.
dialog: Alex gives everyone one more chance to be reasonable...
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Christien, this is a police matter
dialog: Dali, I'm placing you under arrest...
dialog: She knows its stupid even as she says it, but hey, it's her
text: job. Dali never takes his eyes off Christen.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 58.
speaker_heading: DALI
dialog: (to Alex)
dialog: Stick around, Detective. I'm going
dialog: to be hungry when I'm done.
text: And with a rush of air and sound it begins.
text: Alex dives out of the way as Christien rushes Dali. But
text: with staggering speed, Dali side-steps Christien and uses
text: his momentum to HURL Christien across the Club. Christien
text: SMASHES into a wall.
text: But, Christien quickly recovers and LEAPS, almost flies,
text: back to Dali, landing a SERIES OF BLOWS that staggers Dali,
text: but he doesn't fall.
text: Christien and Dali TRADE SAVAGE BLOWS that would kill a Human.
text: VICIOUS ROUND HOUSE KICKS snap necks and heads backward as
text: they crash against each other and to the floor, only to return
text: to their feet and continue their brutal ballet.
text: BLOOD FLOWS from their noses, mouth, eyes, yet the ferocity
text: of their attacks do not wane until Christien finally gains
text: the upper hand. He catches Dali's guard down for a split
text: second and DRIVES him across the room.
text: Christien and Dali crash into the bar, sliding across its
text: smooth surface, shattering bottles and other assorted glass
text: as they go. Dali is momentarily STUNNED.
scene_heading: IN SLOW MOTION
text: Christien raises himself over Dali. His eyes are FILLED
text: WITH BLOOD. He DRAWS his HAND back and over his head, ready
text: to plunge his fist into Dali's chest and rip his heart out...
dialog: BACK TO SPEED
text: Alex runs toward them.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: NO!
text: Christien's focus is broken. He looks at Alex as if she's
dialog: lost her mind.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: I have the right to kill any Vampire
dialog: that challenges me.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: This isn't only about Vampires.
dialog: Dali's crimes affected Humans too.
dialog: If you kill him now, the City has no
dialog: closure. Without Dali, we'll never
dialog: be able to explain what happened.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 59.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: If we don't bring him in, how can we
dialog: convince people its over?
text: Right now, Christien doesn't care. With incredible strength,
text: he grabs Dali around the neck and lifts him straight up in
text: the air. Dali SHRIEKS AND FLAILS WILDLY.
text: Alex GRABS Christien's arm.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: Christien, this city. Your City
dialog: needs to see Dali punished under the
dialog: law, everyone's law.
text: Christien locks eyes with Alex for a long moment. Then,
text: Christien lets out a horrible SCREAM of un-exercised RAGE as
text: he HURLS Dali across the room.
text: Dali CRASHES into a wall and falls unconscious to the ground.
text: Christien turns to Alex, his eyes slowly draining of their
dialog: red...
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: That's two you owe me.
text: UNIFORMED POLICE burst in the room to find Alex and a bloodied
text: Christien standing silently in the middle of the dark Club...
scene_heading: ON A TELEVISION - NIGHT
text: Kincaid stands at a PODIUM. In front of him, A CLUSTER OF
text: MICROPHONES and a SMALL SEA OF REPORTERS. Behind him, Jack
text: Kemp tries to hide his discomfort to be standing shoulder to
text: shoulder with his most hated adversary, Christien. Christien
dialog: loves that Kemp is miserable and, of course, he loves the
dialog: camera.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: The Mayor's Office, in conjunction
dialog: with the NYPD, has officially
dialog: confirmed that all the contaminated
dialog: blood has been accounted for and
dialog: destroyed. The blood in our Blood
text: Bank System is now 100% safe.
text: Kincaid steps back from the microphones, as Christien steps
dialog: forward.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIEN
dialog: On behalf of the entire Vampire
dialog: Community I would like to extend our
dialog: thanks to the NYPD, especially the
dialog: Supernatural Crimes Division, in
text: dealing so quickly with a very
dialog: dangerous situation. We are grateful
dialog: that the rule of law has prevailed.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 60.
text: As the cameras click and their flashes strobe, Christien
text: gives Kincaid a hearty handshake, before stepping back. He
text: gives Kemp a smirk as Kemp approaches the microphone.
speaker_heading: KEMP.
dialog: As the public is well aware, Humans
dialog: First has always been and will
dialog: continue to be a law-abiding
dialog: organization. The unfortunate actions
dialog: of one man will in no way derail us
dialog: from our stated goals.
text: The gathered Reporters pounce...
speaker_heading: REPORTER 1
dialog: Mr. Kemp, what does it mean that a
dialog: Vampire was able to infiltrate Humans
dialog: First so easily?
speaker_heading: REPORTER 2
dialog: Mr, Kemp, is it true you personally
dialog: recruited Dali?
text: As Kemp hems and haws, we pull back to REVEAL we're in...
scene_heading: INT. BAR 390 - NIGHT
text: A local cop hang out. Lots of brass and wood. Pictures of
text: fallen officers adorn the wall behind the bar. Definitely
text: more of a beer and shots than cocktails crowd.
text: Alex and Chase sit at the bar. In front of them are two
text: glasses on wine and a copy of THE NEW YORK TIMES.
speaker_heading: TIGHT ON
text: The Headline: HIGH RANKING MEMBER OF HUMAN'S FIRST REVEALED
scene_heading: TO BE A VAMPIRE. Byline: CHASE DESMOND.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: The television continues to drone on in the background, but
text: Alex and Chase have seen all they want to see.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Did you see the look on Kemp's face?
dialog: Classic.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: He's going to be living this down
dialog: for a long time.
text: Alex and Chase pick up their glasses and clink them ina
dialog: little toast.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 61.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: You took a big chance going to Club
dialog: Carnage like that.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I had to get that scoop I promised
dialog: you, right?
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: It's not funny. What if Dali had
dialog: killed Christien? You would've been
dialog: next.
text: Alex thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You know, it's weird. That didn't
dialog: even occur to me. I just assumed
dialog: Christien would win.
speaker_heading: CHASE
text: He isn't invincible.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Don't tell him that.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don't know what I would've done if
dialog: he'd killed Dali. I'm picturing
text: trying to get the cuffs on him...
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Harder in this situation than a couple
dialog: others I can think of.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Ha, ha.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: You know Christien wants you. He
dialog: didn't spare Dali for the 'sake of
dialog: the city'. He did it for you.
dialog: Because it was important to you.
text: Alex stares into her glass where the red wine swirls. She
text: notices it's almost the color of blood.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: How am I supposed...?
text: She stops mid-sentence when she sees Campbell approaching.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Hey.
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 62.
text: He sees Chase.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't want to interrupt.
text: Chase stands as Alex lets Campbell in.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Actually I was just leaving. Nice
dialog: to see you again, Detective.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Likewise.
text: Chase grabs her coat and gives Alex a hug goodbye.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: He's hot. For a Human.
text: The bar patrons part appreciatively for Chase as she sails
text: out the door.
text: Campbell sits down and puts his drink on the bar
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Nice to have a night off.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Don't get used to it, they're few
dialog: and far between.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You did pretty good out there,
dialog: Fletcher.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Just pretty good? Come on, I've got
dialog: war wounds.
text: Campbell reflexively puts a hand to his bandaged neck
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: How is it?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Got the blood tests back. Still one
dialog: hundred percent Human.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: There's a "Thank God" in there somewhere.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Not ready to see how the other half
dialog: lives?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I think I'll leave that to Darnell.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 63.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Although I suppose being a Vampire
dialog: could have its moments.
text: Campbell raises an eyebrow, but Alex isn't taking the bait.
dialog: There's been enough talk about Vampires tonight.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
dialog: So, am I in, or what? Kincaid said
dialog: you have the final say.
text: Alex picks up her glass and holds it up. Part of her is
dialog: sure this is a mistake, but there's something about him..
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Don't make me regret this.
text: Campbell leans in to her space. He is only inches away.
text: Alex can feel the warmth of his skin, feel his breath on her
text: face as he asks,
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: What's life without a few regrets?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Welcome to the squad, Campbell.
text: With a grin, Campbell drains his glass with a single swallow
text: and Alex suspects her life suddenly just became even more
dialog: complicated...
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT
