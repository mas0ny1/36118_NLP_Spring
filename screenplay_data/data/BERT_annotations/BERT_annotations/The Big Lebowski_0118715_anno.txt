dialog: 
scene_heading: THE BIG LEBOWSKI
text: We are floating up a steep scrubby slope. We hear male voices
text: gently singing "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" and a deep, affable,
text: Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps:
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: A way out west there was a fella,
dialog: fella I want to tell you about, fella
text: by the name of Jeff Lebowski. At
dialog: least, that was the handle his lovin'
dialog: parents gave him, but he never had
dialog: much use for it himself. This
dialog: Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.
dialog: Now, Dude, that's a name no one would
dialog: self-apply where I come from. But
dialog: then, there was a lot about the Dude
dialog: that didn't make a whole lot of sense
dialog: to me. And a lot about where he
dialog: lived, like- wise. But then again,
dialog: maybe that's why I found the place
dialog: s'durned innarestin'.
text: We top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at
text: twilight stretches out before us.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: They call Los Angeles the City of
dialog: Angels. I didn't find it to be that
dialog: exactly, but I'll allow as there are
dialog: some nice folks there. 'Course, I
dialog: can't say I seen London, and I never
dialog: been to France, and I ain't never
dialog: seen no queen in her damn undies as
dialog: the fella says. But I'll tell you
dialog: what, after seeing Los Angeles and
dialog: thisahere story I'm about to unfold--
dialog: wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever'
dialog: bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any
dialog: a those other places, and in English
dialog: too, so I can die with a smile on my
dialog: face without feelin' like the good
dialog: Lord gypped me.
speaker_heading: INTERIOR RALPH'S
text: It is late, the supermarket all but deserted. We are tracking
text: in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the
text: dairy case. He is the Dude. His rumpled look and relaxed
text: manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep.
text: He is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their
dialog: expiration dates.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: Now this story I'm about to unfold
dialog: took place back in the early nineties--
dialog: just about the time of our conflict
dialog: with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies. I
dialog: only mention it 'cause some- times
dialog: there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro,
dialog: 'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes
dialog: there's a man.
text: The Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of
text: milk. He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: And I'm talkin' about the Dude here--
dialog: sometimes there's a man who, wal,
dialog: he's the man for his time'n place,
dialog: he fits right in there--and that's
dialog: the Dude, in Los Angeles.
speaker_heading: CHECKOUT GIRL
text: She waits, arms folded. A small black-and white TV next to
text: her register shows George Bush on the White House lawn with
text: helicopter rotors spinning behind him.
speaker_heading: GEORGE BUSH
dialog: This aggression will not stand. . .
dialog: This will not stand!
text: The Dude, peeking over his shades, scribbles something at
text: the little customer's lectern. Milk beads his mustache.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: ...and even if he's a lazy man, and
dialog: the Dude was certainly that--quite
dialog: possibly the laziest in Los Angeles
dialog: County.
text: The Dude has his Ralph's Shopper's Club card to one side and
text: is making out a check to Ralph's for sixty-nine cents.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: ...which would place him high in the
dialog: runnin' for laziest worldwide--but
dialog: sometimes there's a man. . . sometimes
dialog: there's a man.
scene_heading: EXTERIOR RALPH'S
text: Long shot of the glowing Ralph's. There are only two or
text: three cars parked in the huge lot.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: Wal, I lost m'train of thought here.
dialog: But--aw hell, I done innerduced him
dialog: enough.
text: The Dude is a small figure walking across the vast lot.
text: Next to him walks a Mexican carry-out boy in a red apron and
text: cap carrying a small brown bag holding the quart of milk.
text: The two men's footsteps echo in the still of the night.
text: After a beat of walking the Dude offhandedly points.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: It's the LeBaron.
speaker_heading: DUDE'S HOUSE
text: The Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow
text: court. He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small
text: leatherette satchel in the other. He awkwardly hugs the
text: grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door.
speaker_heading: INSIDE
text: The Dude enters and flicks on a light.
text: His head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit.
text: We track with him as he is rushed through the living room,
text: his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body.
text: Going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece
text: of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a
dialog: hole.
text: The Dude is propelled across the bedroom and on into a small
text: bathroom, the satchel once again taking away a piece of
text: doorframe. His head is plunged into the toilet. The paper
text: bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet
text: rim and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the
dialog: floor.
text: The Dude blows bubbles.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: We want that money, Lebowski. Bunny
dialog: said you were good for it.
text: Hands haul the Dude out of the toilet. The Dude blubbers and
text: gasps for air.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Where's the money, Lebowski!
text: His head is plunged back into the toilet.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Where's the money, Lebowski!
text: The hands haul him out again, dripping and gasping.
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: It's uh, it's down there somewhere.
dialog: Lemme take another look.
text: His head is plunged back in.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Don't fuck with us. If your wife
dialog: owes money to Jackie Treehorn, that
dialog: means you owe money to Jackie
dialog: Treehorn.
text: The inquisitor hauls the Dude's head out one last time and
text: flops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against
dialog: the toilet.
text: The Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand.
text: Looming over him is a strapping blond man.
text: Beyond in the living room a young Chinese man unzips his fly
text: and walks over to a rug.
speaker_heading: CHINESE MAN
text: Ever thus to deadbeats, Lebowski.
text: He starts peeing on the rug.
text: The Dude's hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his
dialog: sunglasses.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Oh, man. Don't do--
speaker_heading: BLOND MAN
dialog: You see what happens? You see what
dialog: happens, Lebowski?
text: The Dude puts on his dripping sunglasses.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Look, nobody calls me Lebowski. You
dialog: got the wrong guy. I'm the Dude,
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: BLOND MAN
dialog: Your name is Lebowski. Your wife is
dialog: Bunny.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Bunny? Look, moron.
text: He holds up his hands.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: You see a wedding ring? Does this
dialog: place look like I'm fucking married?
dialog: All my plants are dead!
text: The blond man stoops to unzip the satchel. He pulls out a
text: bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious
dialog: native.
speaker_heading: BLOND MAN
dialog: The fuck is this?
text: The Dude pats at his pockets, takes out a joint and lights
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Obviously you're not a golfer.
text: The blond man drops the ball which pulverizes more tile.
speaker_heading: BLOND MAN
dialog: Woo?
text: The Chinese man is zipping his fly.
speaker_heading: WOO
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: BLOND MAN
dialog: Wasn't this guy supposed to be a
dialog: millionaire?
speaker_heading: WOO
dialog: Uh?
text: They both look around.
speaker_heading: WOO
dialog: Fuck.
speaker_heading: BLOND MAN
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: WOO
text: He looks like a fuckin' loser.
text: The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose with one finger
text: and peeks over them.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Hey. At least I'm housebroken.
text: The two men look at each other. They turn to leave.
speaker_heading: WOO
dialog: Fuckin' waste of time.
text: The blond man turns testily at the door.
speaker_heading: BLOND MAN
dialog: Thanks a lot, asshole.
text: ON THE DOOR SLAM WE CUT TO:
scene_heading: BOWLING PINS
text: Scattered by a strike.
text: Music and head credits play over various bowling shots--pins
text: flying, bowlers hoisting balls, balls gliding down lanes,
text: sliding feet, graceful releases, ball return spinning up a
text: ball, fingers sliding into fingerholes, etc.
text: The music turns into boomy source music, coming from a distant
text: jukebox, as the credits end over a clattering strike.
text: A lanky blonde man with stringy hair tied back in a ponytail
text: turns from the strike to walk back to the bench.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Hot damn, I'm throwin' rocks tonight.
dialog: Mark it, Dude.
text: We are tracking in on the circular bench towards a big man
text: nursing a large plastic cup of Bud. He has dark worried
text: eyes and a goatee. Hairy legs emerge from his khaki shorts.
text: He also wears a khaki army surplus shirt with the sleeves
text: cut off over an old bowling shirt. This is Walter. He
text: squints through the smoke from his own cigarette as he
text: addresses the Dude at the scoring table.
text: The Dude, also holding a large plastic cup of Bud, wears
text: some of its foam on his mustache.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: This was a valued rug.
text: He elaborately clears his throat.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: This was, uh--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah man, it really tied the room
dialog: together--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: This was a valued, uh.
text: Donny, the strike-scoring bowler, enters and sits next Walter.
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: What tied the room together, Dude?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Were you listening to the story,
dialog: Donny?
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: What--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Were you listening to the Dude's
dialog: story?
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: I was bowling--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: So you have no frame of reference,
dialog: Donny. You're like a child who
text: wanders in in the middle of a movie
dialog: and wants to know--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: What's your point, Walter?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: There's no fucking reason--here's my
dialog: point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: Yeah Walter, what's your point?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: What's the point of--we all know who
dialog: was at fault, so what the fuck are
dialog: you talking about?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Huh? No! What the fuck are you
dialog: talking--I'm not--we're talking about
dialog: unchecked aggression here--
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: What the fuck is he talking about?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: My rug.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Forget it, Donny. You're out of
dialog: your element.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I
dialog: can't go give him a bill so what the
dialog: fuck are you talking about?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What the fuck are you talking about?!
dialog: This Chinaman is not the issue! I'm
text: talking about drawing a line in the
dialog: sand, Dude. Across this line you do
dialog: not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is
dialog: not the preferred, uh. . . Asian-
dialog: American. Please.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Walter, this is not a guy who built
dialog: the rail- roads, here, this is a guy
dialog: who peed on my--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What the fuck are you--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Walter, he peed on my rug--
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: He peed on the Dude's rug--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT! This
dialog: Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: So who--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Jeff Lebowski. Come on. This other
dialog: Jeffrey Lebowski. The millionaire.
dialog: He's gonna be easier to find anyway
dialog: than these two, uh. these two . . .
dialog: And he has the wealth, uh, the
dialog: resources obviously, and there is no
dialog: reason, no FUCKING reason, why his
dialog: wife should go out and owe money and
dialog: they pee on your rug. Am I wrong?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: No, but--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Am I wrong!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah, but--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Okay. That, uh.
text: He elaborately clears his throat.
dialog: That rap really tied the room together, did it not?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Fuckin' A.
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: And this guy peed on it.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Donny! Please!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: His name is Lebowski? That's your
dialog: name, Dude!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should
dialog: compensate me for the fucking rug.
dialog: I mean his wife goes out and owes
dialog: money and they pee on my rug.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Thaaat's right Dude; they pee on
dialog: your fucking Rug.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON A PLAQUE
text: We pull back from the name JEFFREY LEBOWSKI engraved in silver
dialog: to reveal that the plaque, from Variety Clubs International,
text: honors Lebowski as ACHIEVER OF THE YEAR.
text: Reflected in the plaque we see the Dude entering the room
text: with a YOUNG MAN. We hear the two men talk:
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: And this is the study. You can see
dialog: the various commendations, honorary
dialog: degrees, et cetera.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yes, uh, very impressive.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Please, feel free to inspect them.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I'm not really, uh.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Please! Please!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: We are panning the walls, looking at various citations and
text: certificates unrelated to the ones being discussed offscreen:
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: That's the key to the city of
dialog: Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was
dialog: given two years ago in recognition
dialog: of his various civic, uh.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: That's a Los Angeles Chamber of
dialog: Commerce Business Achiever award,
dialog: which is given--not necessarily given
dialog: every year! Given only when there's
dialog: a worthy, somebody especially--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Hey, is this him with Nancy?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the
dialog: first lady, yes, taken when--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Lebowski on the right?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right,
text: Mrs. Reagan on the left, taken when--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: He's handicapped, huh?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes. And
dialog: this picture was taken when Mrs.
dialog: Reagan was first lady of the nation,
dialog: yes, yes? Not of California.
speaker_heading: DUDE
text: Far out.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: And in fact he met privately with
dialog: the President, though unfortunately
dialog: there wasn't time for a photo
dialog: opportunity.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Nancy's pretty good.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Wonderful woman. We were very--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Are these.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: These are Mr. Lebowski's children,
dialog: so to speak--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Different mothers, huh?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: No, they--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I guess he's pretty, uh, racially
dialog: pretty cool--
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: They're not his, heh-heh, they're
dialog: not literally his children; they're
dialog: the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers,
dialog: inner-city children of promise but
dialog: without the--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: --without the means for higher
dialog: education, so Mr. Lebowski has
dialog: committed to sending all of them
dialog: to college.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Jeez. Think he's got room for one
dialog: more?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: One--oh! Heh-heh. You never went
dialog: to college?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Well, yeah I did, but I spent most
dialog: of my time occupying various, um,
dialog: administration buildings--
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Heh-heh--
speaker_heading: DUDE
text: --smoking thai-stick, breaking into
dialog: the ROTC--
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Yes, heh--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: --and bowling. I'll tell you the
dialog: truth, Brandt, I don't remember most
dialog: of it.--Jeez! Fuck me!
text: Our continuing track and pan have brought us onto a framed
text: Life Magazine cover which is headlined ARE YOU A LEBOWSKI
text: ACHIEVER? Oddly, the Dude's sunglassed face is on it; we
text: realize that, under the magazine's logo and headline, the
text: display is mirrored.
text: We hear the door open and the whine of a motor. The Dude,
text: wearing shorts and a bowling shirt, turns to look.
text: So does Brandt, the young man we've been listening to. He
text: wears a suit and has his hands clasped in front of his groin.
text: Entering the room is a fat sixtyish man in a motorized
dialog: wheelchair--Jeff Lebowski.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Okay sir, you're a Lebowski, I'm a
dialog: Lebowski, that's terrific, I'm very
dialog: busy so what can I do for you?
text: He wheels himself behind a desk. The Dude sits facing him
text: as Brandt withdraws.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Well sir, it's this rug I have, really
dialog: tied the room together-
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: You told Brandt on the phone, he
dialog: told me. So where do I fit in?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Well they were looking for you, these
dialog: two guys, they were trying to--
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: I'll say it again, all right? You
dialog: told Brandt. He told me. I know
dialog: what happened. Yes? Yes?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: So you know they were trying to piss
dialog: on your rug--
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Did I urinate on your rug?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: You mean, did you personally come
dialog: and pee on my--
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Hello! Do you speak English? Parla
dialog: usted Inglese? I'll say it again.
dialog: Did I urinate on your rug?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Well no, like I said, Woo peed on
dialog: the rug--
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Hello! Hello! So every time--I
dialog: just want to understand this, sir--
dialog: every time a rug is micturated upon
dialog: in this fair city, I have to
dialog: compensate the--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam
dialog: anybody here, I'm just--
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: You're just looking for a handout
dialog: like every other--are you employed,
dialog: Mr. Lebowski?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Look, let me explain something.
dialog: I'm not Mr. Lebowski; you're Mr.
dialog: Lebowski. I'm the Dude. So that's
dialog: what you call me. That, or Duder.
dialog: His Dudeness. Or El Duderino, if,
dialog: you know, you're not into the whole
dialog: brevity thing--
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Are you employed, sir?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Employed?
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: You don't go out and make a living
text: dressed like that in the middle of a
dialog: weekday.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Is this a--what day is this?
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: But I do work, so if you don't mind--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: No, look. I do mind. The Dude minds.
dialog: This will not stand, ya know, this
dialog: will not stand, man. I mean, if
dialog: your wife owes--
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: My wife is not the issue here. I
dialog: hope that my wife will someday learn
dialog: to live on her allowance, which is
dialog: ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that
dialog: will be her problem, not mine, just
dialog: as your rug is your problem, just as
dialog: every bum's lot in life is his own
dialog: responsibility regardless of whom he
dialog: chooses to blame. I didn't blame
dialog: anyone for the loss of my legs, some
dialog: chinaman in Korea took them from me
dialog: but I went out and achieved anyway.
dialog: I can't solve your problems, sir,
dialog: only you can.
text: The Dude rises.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Ah fuck it.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Sure! Fuck it! That's your answer!
dialog: Tattoo it on your forehead! Your
dialog: answer to everything!
text: The Dude is heading for the door.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Your "revolution" is over, Mr.
dialog: Lebowski! Condolences! The bums
dialog: lost!
text: As the Dude opens the door.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: ...My advice is, do what your parents
dialog: did! Get a job, sir! The bums will
dialog: always lose-- do you hear me,
text: Lebowski? THE BUMS WILL ALWAYS--
text: The Dude shuts the door on the old man's bellowing to find
dialog: himself--
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
text: --in a high coffered hallway. Brandt
text: is approaching.
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: How was your meeting, Mr. Lebowski?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Okay. The old man told me to take
dialog: any rug in the house.
speaker_heading: WALKWAY
text: A houseman with a rolled-up carpet on one shoulder goes down
text: a stone walk that winds through the back lawn, past a swimming
text: pool to a garage. Brandt and the Dude follow.
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: Manolo will load it into your car
dialog: for you, uh, Dude.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: It's the LeBaron.
scene_heading: DUDE'S POINT OF VIEW
text: Tracking toward the pool. A young woman sits facing it, her
text: back to us, leaning forward to paint her toenails.
text: Beyond her a black form floats in an inflatable chair in the
dialog: pool.
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see
dialog: you again some time, Dude.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the
dialog: neighborhood, need to use the john.
speaker_heading: CLOSER TRACK
text: Arcing around the woman's foot as she finishes painting the
text: nails emerald green.
speaker_heading: THE DUDE
dialog: Looking.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: The young woman looks up at him. She is in her early
dialog: twenties.
text: She leans back and extends her leg toward the Dude.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Blow on them.
text: The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose and peeks over
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Huh?
text: She waggles her foot and giggles.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: G'ahead. Blow.
text: The Dude tentatively grabs hold of her extended foot.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: You want me to blow on your toes?
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Uh-huh. . . I can't blow that far.
text: The Dude looks over at the pool.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: You sure he won't mind?
text: The man bobbing in the inflatable chair is passed out. He
text: is thin, in his thirties, with long stringy blond hair. He
text: wears black leather pants and a black leather jacket, open,
text: shirtless, exposing fine blond chest hair and pale skin.
text: One arm trails off into the water; next to it, an empty
text: whiskey bottle bobs.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
text: Dieter doesn't care about anything.
dialog: He's a nihilist.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Practicing?
text: The young woman smiles.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: You're not blowing.
text: Brandt nervously takes the Dude by the elbow.
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: Our guest has to be getting along,
dialog: Mrs. Lebowski.
text: The Dude grudgingly allows himself to be led away, still
text: looking at the young woman.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: You're Bunny?
speaker_heading: BUNNY
dialog: I'll suck your cock for a thousand
dialog: dollars.
text: Brandt releases a gale of forced laughter:
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: Ha-ha-ha-ha! Wonderful woman. Very
dialog: free-spirited. We're all very fond
dialog: of her.
speaker_heading: BUNNY
dialog: Brandt can't watch though. Or he
dialog: has to pay a hundred.
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! That's marvelous.
text: He continues to lead away the Dude, who looks back over his
speaker_heading: SHOULDER:
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I'm just gonna find a cash machine.
scene_heading: BOWLING PINS
text: Scattered by a strike.
speaker_heading: THE BOWLERS
text: Donny calls out from the bench:
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: Grasshopper Dude--They're dead in
dialog: the water!!
text: As the Dude walks back to the scoring table he turns to
text: another team in black bowling shirts--the Cavaliers--that
text: shares the lane.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Your maples, Carl.
text: Walter, just arriving, is carrying a leatherette satchel in
text: one hand and a large plastic carrier in the other.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Way to go, Dude. If you will it, it
dialog: is no dream.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: You're fucking twenty minutes late.
dialog: What the fuck is that?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Theodore Herzel.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: State of Israel. If you will it,
dialog: Dude, it is no--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: What the fuck're you talking about?
dialog: The carrier. What's in the fucking
dialog: carrier?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Huh? Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian.
dialog: Can't leave him home alone or he
text: eats the furniture.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: What the fuck are you--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian.
dialog: I'm looking after it while Cynthia
text: and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: You brought a fucking Pomeranian
dialog: bowling?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What do you mean "brought it bowling"?
dialog: I didn't rent it shoes. I'm not
dialog: buying it a fucking beer. He's not
dialog: gonna take your fucking turn, Dude.
text: He lets the small yapping dog out of the carrier. It scoots
text: around the bowling table, sniffing at bowlers and wagging
text: its tail.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked
dialog: me to take care of her fucking dog
dialog: while she and her boyfriend went to
dialog: Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck
dialog: herself. Why can't she board it?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: First of all, Dude, you don't have
dialog: an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show
dialog: dog with fucking papers. You can't
text: board it. It gets upset, its hair
text: falls out.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Hey man--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over
dialog: the line!
text: Smokey turns from his last roll to look at Walter.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Smokey Huh?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Over the line, Smokey! I'm sorry.
dialog: That's a foul.
speaker_heading: SMOKEY
dialog: Bullshit. Eight, Dude.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Excuse me! Mark it zero. Next frame.
speaker_heading: SMOKEY
dialog: Bullshit. Walter!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: This is not Nam. This is bowling.
dialog: There are rules.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Come on Walter, it's just--it's
text: Smokey. So his toe slipped over a
dialog: little, it's just a game.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: This is a league game. This
dialog: determines who enters the next round-
dialog: robin, am I wrong?
speaker_heading: SMOKEY
dialog: Yeah, but--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Am I wrong!?
speaker_heading: SMOKEY
dialog: Yeah, but I wasn't over. Gimme the
dialog: marker, Dude, I'm marking it an
dialog: eight.
text: Walter takes out a gun.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Smokey my friend, you're entering a
dialog: world of pain.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Hey Walter--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Mark that frame an eight, you're
text: entering a world of pain.
speaker_heading: SMOKEY
dialog: I'm not--
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: A world of pain.
text: A manager in a bowling-shirt style uniform is running for a
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: SMOKEY
dialog: Look Dude, I don't hold with this.
dialog: This guy is your partner, you should--
text: Walter primes the gun and points it at his head.
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: HAS THE WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY? AM
text: I THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO GIVES A SHIT
text: ABOUT THE RULES? MARK IT ZERO!
text: The Pomeranian is excitedly yapping at Walter's elbow, making
text: high body-twisting tail-wagging leaps.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Walter, they're calling the cops,
text: put the piece away.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: MARK IT ZERO!
speaker_heading: SMOKEY
dialog: Walter--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE?
dialog: MARK IT ZERO!!
speaker_heading: SMOKEY
dialog: All right! There it is! It's fucking
dialog: zero!
text: He points frantically at the score projected above the lane.
speaker_heading: SMOKEY
dialog: You happy, you crazy fuck?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: This is a league game, Smokey!
speaker_heading: PARKING LOT
text: Walter and the Dude walk to the Dude's car. The Pomeranian
text: trots happily behind Walter who totes the empty carrier.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Walter, you can't do that. These
dialog: guys're like me, they're pacificists.
dialog: Smokey was a conscientious objector.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You know Dude, I myself dabbled with
dialog: pacifism at one point. Not in Nam,
dialog: of course--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: And you know Smokey has emotional
dialog: problems!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You mean--beyond pacifism?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: He's fragile, man! He's very fragile!
text: As the two men get into the car:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Huh. I did not know that. Well,
dialog: it's water under the bridge. And we
dialog: do enter the next round-robin, am I
dialog: wrong?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: No, you're not wrong--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Am I wrong!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: You're not wrong, Walter, you're
dialog: just an asshole.
text: They watch a squad car take a squealing turn into the lot.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Okay then. We play Quintana and
dialog: O'Brien next week. They'll be
text: pushovers.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Just, just take it easy, Walter.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: That's your answer to everything,
dialog: Dude. And let me point out--pacifism
dialog: is not--look at our current situation
dialog: with that camelfucker in Iraq--
dialog: pacifism is not something to hide
dialog: behind.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Well, just take 't easy, man.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah? Wavin' a gun around?!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (smugly)
dialog: Calmer than you are.
text: -his irritates the Dude further.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Just take it easy, man!
text: Walter is still smug.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Calmer than you are.
speaker_heading: DUDE'S HOUSE
text: A large, brilliant Persian rug lies beneath the Dude's beat-
text: up old furniture.
text: At the table next to the answering machine the Dude is mixing
dialog: kalhua, rum and milk.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Dude, this is Smokey. Look, I don't
dialog: wanna be a hard-on about this, and I
dialog: know it wasn't your fault, but I
dialog: just thought it was fair to tell you
dialog: that Gene and I will be submitting
dialog: this to the League and asking them
dialog: to set aside the round. Or maybe
dialog: forfeit it to us--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Shit!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: --so, like I say, just thought, you
dialog: know, fair warning. Tell Walter.
text: A beep.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER VOICE
dialog: Mr. Lebowski, this is Brandt at, uh,
text: well--at Mr. Lebowski's office.
dialog: Please call us as soon as is
dialog: convenient.
dialog: Beep.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER VOICE
dialog: Mr. Lebowski, this is Fred Dynarski
dialog: with the Southern Cal Bowling League.
dialog: I just got a, an informal report,
dialog: uh, that a uh, a member of your team,
dialog: uh, Walter Sobchak, drew a loaded
dialog: weapon during league play--
text: We hear the doorbell.
speaker_heading: THE DOOR
text: It swings open to reveal a short, hairy, muscular but balding
text: middle-aged man in a black T-shirt and black cut-off jeans.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Hiya Allan.
speaker_heading: ALLAN
dialog: Dude, I finally got the venue I
dialog: wanted. I'm Performing my dance
dialog: quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane
text: Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on
dialog: Tuesday night, and I'd love it if
dialog: you came and gave me notes.
text: The Dude takes a swig of his kalhua.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Sure Allan, I'll be there.
speaker_heading: ALLAN
dialog: Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the
dialog: tenth.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
speaker_heading: ALLAN
dialog: Just, uh, just slip the rent under
dialog: my door.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah, okay.
text: BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM
text: The voice continues on the machine.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: --serious infraction, and examine
dialog: your standing. Thank you. Beep.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Mr. Lebowski, Brandt again. Please
dialog: do call us when you get in and I'll
dialog: send the limo. Let me assure you--I
dialog: hope you're not avoiding this call
dialog: because of the rug, which, I assure
dialog: you, is not a problem. We need your
dialog: help and, uh--well we would very
dialog: much like to see you. Thank you.
dialog: It's Brandt.
speaker_heading: TRACKING
text: We are pushing Brandt down the high-ceilinged hallway.
text: Distantly, we hear a dolorous soprano. Brandt talks back
dialog: over
scene_heading: HIS SHOULDER:
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: We've had some terrible news. Mr.
text: Lebowski is in seclusion in the West
dialog: Wing.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Huh.
text: Brandt throws open a pair of heavy double doors. The music
text: washes over us as we enter a great study where Jeffrey
text: Lebowski, a blanket thrown over his knees, stares hauntedly
text: into a fire, listening to Lohengrin.
scene_heading: BRANDT ANNOUNCES, AMBIGUOUSLY:
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: Mr. Lebowski.
text: Jeffrey Lebowski waves the Dude in without looking around.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: It's funny. I can look back on a
dialog: life of achievement, on challenges
dialog: met, competitors bested, obstacles
dialog: overcome. I've accomplished more
dialog: than most men, and without the use
dialog: of my legs. What. . . What makes a
dialog: man, Mr. Lebowski?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Dude.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I don't know, sir.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Is it. . . is it, being prepared to
dialog: do the right thing? Whatever the
dialog: price? Isn't that what makes a man?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Sure. That and a pair of testicles.
text: Lebowski turns away from the Dude with a haunted stare, lost
dialog: in thought.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: You're joking. But perhaps you're
dialog: right.
text: The Dude thumps at his chest pocket.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Mind if I smoke a jay?
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Bunny.
text: He turns back around and the firelight shows teartracks on
text: his cheeks.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: 'Scuse me?
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light
dialog: of my life. Are you surprised at my
dialog: tears, sir?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Fuckin' A.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Strong men also cry. . . Strong men
dialog: also cry.
text: He clears his throat.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: I received this fax this morning.
text: Brandt hastily pulls a flimsy sheet from his clipboard and
text: hands it to the Dude.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: As you can see, it is a ransom note.
text: Sent by cowards. Men who are unable
dialog: to achieve on a level field of play.
dialog: Men who will not sign their names.
dialog: Weaklings. Bums.
scene_heading: THE DUDE EXAMINES THE FAX:
scene_heading: WE HAVE BUNNY. GATHER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN UNMARKED NON-
scene_heading: CONSECUTIVE TWENTIES. AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS. NO FUNNY STUFF.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Bummer.
text: Lebowski looks soulfully at the Dude.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Brandt will fill you in on the
dialog: details.
text: He wheels his chair around to once again gaze into the fire.
text: Brandt tugs at the Dude's shirt and points him back to the
dialog: hall.
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
text: The soprano's singing is once again faint. Brandt's voice
dialog: is hushed:
speaker_heading: BRANDT
text: Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a
dialog: generous offer to you to act as
dialog: courier once we get instructions for
dialog: the money.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Why me, man?
speaker_heading: BRANDT
text: He suspects that the culprits might
dialog: be the very people who, uh, soiled
dialog: your rug, and you're in a unique
dialog: position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm
dialog: that suspicion.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers,
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: Well Dude, we just don't know.
scene_heading: BOWLING PINS
text: CRASH--scattered by a strike, in slow motion.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Still in slow motion. We are looking across the length of
text: the bowling alley at a tall, thin, Hispanic bowler displaying
text: perfect form. He wears an all-in-one dacron-polyester stretch
text: bowling outfit with a racing stripe down each side.
speaker_heading: FAST TRACK IN
text: On the Dude, sitting next to Walter in the molded plastic
text: chairs. The Dude is staring off towards the bowler.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Fucking Quintana--that creep can
dialog: roll, man--
text: BACK TO THE BOWLER
text: Displaying great slow-motion form as the Dude and Walter's
text: conversation continues over.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert,
dialog: Dude.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: The man is a sex offender. With a
dialog: record. Spent six months in Chino
dialog: for exposing himself to an eight-
dialog: year-old.
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK
text: We see Quintana, in pressed jeans and a stretchy sweater,
text: walking up a stoop in a residential neighborhood and zinging
dialog: the bell.
text: The VOICE-OVER conversation continues.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: When he moved down to Venice he had
dialog: to go door-to-door to tell everyone
dialog: he's a pederast.
text: The door swings open and a beer-swilling middle-aged man
text: looks dully out at Quintana, who looks hesitantly up.
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: What's a pederast, Walter?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Shut the fuck up, Donny.
speaker_heading: PINS
text: scattered by a strike.
speaker_heading: QUINTANA
text: wheeling and thrusting a black gloved fist into the air.
text: Stitched above the breast pocket of his all-in-one is his
dialog: first name, "Jesus".
text: BACK TO WALTER AND THE DUDE
text: They have been joined by Donny.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Anyway. How much they offer you?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Twenty grand. And of course I still
dialog: keep the rug.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Just for making the hand-off?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah.
text: He slips a little black box out of his shirt pocket.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: ...They gave Dude a beeper, so
dialog: whenever these guys call--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What if it's during a game?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I told him if it was during league
dialog: play--
text: Donny has been watching Quintana.
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: If what's during league play?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Life does not stop and start at your
dialog: convenience, you miserable piece of
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: What's wrong with Walter, Dude?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I figure it's easy money, it's all
dialog: pretty harmless. I mean she probably
dialog: kidnapped herself.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: What do you mean, Dude?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Rug-peers did not do this. I mean
text: look at it. Young trophy wife.
dialog: Marries a guy for money but figures
text: he isn't giving her enough. She
dialog: owes money all over town--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: That...fucking...bitch!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: It's all a goddamn fake. Like Lenin
dialog: said, look for the person who will
dialog: benefit. And you will, uh, you know,
dialog: you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying
dialog: to say--
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: I am the Walrus.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: That fucking bitch!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: I am the Walrus.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Shut the fuck up, Donny! V.I. Lenin!
dialog: Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: What the fuck is he talking about?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: That's fucking exactly what happened,
dialog: Dude! That makes me fucking SICK!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed
dialog: off?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Those rich fucks! This whole fucking
dialog: thing-- I did not watch my buddies
dialog: die face down in the muck so that
dialog: this fucking strumpet--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I don't see any connection to Vietnam,
dialog: Walter.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Well, there isn't a literal
dialog: connection, Dude.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Walter, face it, there isn't any
dialog: connection. It's your roll.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Have it your way. The point is--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: It's your roll--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: The fucking point is--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: It's your roll.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Are you ready to be fucked, man?
text: They both look up.
text: Quintana, on his way out, looks down at them from the lip of
text: the lanes. Over his polyester all-in-one he now wears a
text: windbreaker with a racing stripe and "Jesus" stitched on the
text: breast. He is holding a fancy black-and-red leather ball
text: satchel (perhaps a Sylvia Wein). Behind him stands his
text: partner, O'Brien, a short fat Irishman with tufted red hair.
speaker_heading: QUINTANA
dialog: I see you rolled your way into the
dialog: semis. Deos mio, man. Seamus and
dialog: me, we're gonna fuck you up.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah well, that's just, ya know,
dialog: like, your opinion, man.
text: Quintana looks at Walter.
speaker_heading: QUINTANA
dialog: Let me tell you something, bendeco.
dialog: You pull any your crazy shit with
dialog: us, you flash a piece out on the
dialog: lanes, I'll take it away from you
dialog: and stick it up your ass and pull
dialog: the fucking trigger til it goes
dialog: "click".
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: QUINTANA
dialog: You said it, man. Nobody fucks with
dialog: the Jesus.
text: Jesus walks away. Walter nods sadly.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Eight-year-olds, Dude.
scene_heading: DUDE'S BUNGALOW
text: We are looking down at the Dude who is prone on the rug.
text: His eyes are closed. He wears a Walkman headset. Leaking
text: tinnily through the headphones we can just hear an
text: intermittent clatter.
text: In his outflung hand lies a cassette case labeled VENICE
scene_heading: BEACH LEAGUE PLAYOFFS 1987.
text: The Dude absently licks his lips as we faintly hear a hall
text: rumbling down the lane. On its impact with the pins, the
text: Dude opens his eyes.
text: He screams.
text: A blonde woman looms over him. Next to her a young man
text: in paint-spattered denims stoops and swings something towards
dialog: the carrier.
text: The sap catches the Dude on the chin and sends his head
text: thunking back onto the rug.
text: A million stars explode against a field of black. We hear
text: the "La-la-la-la" of The Man in Me.
text: The black field dissolves into the pattern of the rug.
text: The rug rolls away to reveal an aerial view of the city of
text: Los Angeles at twilight, moving below us at great speed.
text: The Dude is flying over the city, his arms thrown out in
text: front of him, the wind whipping his hair and billowing his
text: bowling shirt. He looks up.
text: Ahead the mysterious blonde woman wings away, riding on the
text: Dude's rug like a sheik on a magic carpet. She is outpacing
dialog: us, growing smaller.
text: The Dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices
text: that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand.
text: His bemusement turns to concern over the aerodynamic
text: implications just as the ball seems to suddenly assume its
text: weight, abruptly snapping his arm down, and him after it. He
text: is falling. From a high angle we see the Dude hurtling down
text: toward the city, dragged by the ball.
text: A reverse looking up shows the Dude hurtling toward us
text: out of the inky sky, his eyes wide with horror. Led by
text: the bowling ball, he zooms past the camera leaving us in
dialog: black.
text: We hear a distant rumble, like thunder. Dull reflections
text: materialize in the darkness. They are glints off the shiny
text: surface of an oncoming bowling ball.
text: We pull back to reveal that the blackness was the inside of
text: a ball return, and the gleaming bowling ball is being
text: regurgitated up at us, overtaking us.
text: The Dude looks up, up, up at the looming ball, its mass
text: rolling a huge shadow across his face.
text: The gleaming ball shows three dead black holes rolling toward
dialog: us --finger holes.
text: The largest--thumb--hole rolls directly over us, engulfing
text: us once again in black..
text: The black rolls away and we are spinning--spinning down a
dialog: bowling lane--our point of view that of someone trapped in
text: the thumbhole of the rolling ball.
text: We see the receding bowler spinning away. It is the blonde
text: woman, performing her follow-through.
text: Floor spins up at us and then away; ceiling spins up and
text: away; the length of the alley with pins at the end; floor;
text: ceiling; approaching pins; again and again.
text: We hit the pins and clatter into blackness. We hear pins
text: spin, hit each other and drop.
text: We hear an irritating, insistent beeping.
speaker_heading: FADE IN
text: We are close on the Dude, upside down. As the picture fades
text: in the bowling noises continue, but filtered and faint.
text: They come from the Dude's Walkman, the headset of which is
text: now askew, with one arm off his ear.
text: As the Dude opens his eyes we spiral slowly upward to put
text: him right side around. His head is now resting against
text: hardwood floor, not rug.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Oh man.
text: He raises himself onto his elbows and massages the
text: red lump on his jaw. The beeper on his belt is
text: blinking red in sync with the continuing irritating beeps.
scene_heading: WIDE ON THE ROOM
text: An end table is upset, but otherwise the furniture is
text: in place. The rug is gone.
text: The Dude looks around. The bowling sounds continue.
text: The beeps continue.
text: The phone starts to jangle.
speaker_heading: TRACK
text: We push Brandt down the familiar marble hallway.
text: Again there is a distant aria. Brandt throws out a
text: wrist to look at his watch.
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: They called about eighty minutes
dialog: ago. They want you to take the money
dialog: and drive north on the 4 5. They'll
dialog: call you on the portable phone with
text: instructions in about forty minutes.
dialog: One person only or I'd go with you.
dialog: They were very clear on that: one
dialog: person only. What happened to your
dialog: jaw?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Oh, nothin', you know.
text: They have reached the little desk outside of the big
text: Lebowski's office; Brandt opens its bottom drawer with a key
text: and takes out an attache case. He hands this to the Dude
text: along with a cellular phone in a battery-pack carrying case.
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: Here's the money, and the phone.
dialog: Please, Dude, follow whatever
text: instructions they give.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: Her life is in your hands.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Oh, man, don't say that..
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that:
dialog: Her life is in your hands.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: Her life is in your hands, Dude.
dialog: And report back to us as soon as
dialog: it's done.
speaker_heading: DUDE'S CAR
text: We pan off the Dude, driving, to his point of view through
text: the front windshield. The headlights play over Walter
text: standing waiting in front of the storefront of SOBCHAK
text: SECURITY. Though he is wearing khaki shorts and shirt, the
text: fact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look
text: oddly like a commuter. He also holds an irregular shape
text: bundled in brown wrapping paper.
text: The car stops in front of him and he opens the Dude's door
text: and hands in the briefcase.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Take the ringer. I'll drive.
text: The Dude takes the briefcase and slides over.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: The what?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: The ringer! The ringer, Dude! Have
dialog: they called yet?
text: The Dude opens the briefcase and paws bemusedly through it
text: as the car starts rolling.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: What the hell is this?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: My dirty undies. Laundry, Dude.
dialog: The whites.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Agh--
text: He closes the briefcase.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Walter, I'm sure there's a reason
dialog: you brought your dirty undies--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Thaaaat's right, Dude. The weight.
text: The ringer can't look empty.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Walter--what the fuck are you
dialog: thinking?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Well you're right, Dude, I got to
dialog: thinking. I got to thinking why
dialog: should we settle for a measly fucking
dialog: twenty grand--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: We? What the fuck we? You said you
dialog: just wanted to come along--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: My point, Dude, is why should we
dialog: settle for twenty grand when we can
dialog: keep the entire million. Am I wrong?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yes you're wrong. This isn't a
dialog: fucking game, Walter--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: It is a fucking game. You said so
dialog: yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
speaker_heading: DUDE '
dialog: Yeah, but--
text: The phone chirps. Dude grabs it.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Dude here.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (German accent)
dialog: Who is this?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Dude the Bagman. Where do you want
dialog: us to go?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: ...Us?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Shit. . . Uh, yeah, you know, me and the driver. I'm not
text: handling the money and driving the car and talking on the
dialog: phone all by my fucking--
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Shut the fuck up.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Okay, listen--
text: Walter looks over at the Dude and bellows:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Dude, are you fucking this up?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Who is that?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: The driver man, I told you--
dialog: Click. Dial tone.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Oh shit. Walter.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What the fuck is going on there?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: They hung up, Walter! You fucked it
dialog: up! You fucked it up! Her life was
dialog: in our hands!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Easy, Dude.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: We're screwed now! We don't get
dialog: shit and they're gonna kill her!
dialog: We're fucked, Walter!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Dude, nothing is fucked. Come on.
dialog: You're being very unDude. They'll
dialog: call back. Look, she kidnapped her--
text: The phone chirps.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Ya see? Nothing is fucked up here,
dialog: Dude. Nothing is fucked. These
dialog: guys are fucking amateurs--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Shutup, Walter! Don't fucking say
dialog: peep when I'm doing business here.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (patronizing)
dialog: Okay Dude. Have it your way.
text: The Dude unclips the phone from the battery pack.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: But they're amateurs.
text: The Dude glares at Walter. Into the phone:
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Dude here.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Okay, vee proceed. But only if there
dialog: is no funny stuff.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: So no funny stuff. Okay?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Hey, just tell me where the fuck you
dialog: want us to go.
scene_heading: A HIGHWAY SIGN: SIMI VALLEY ROAD
text: It flashes by in the headlights of the roaring car.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: That was the sign.
text: Walter wrestles the car onto the two-lane road.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah. So as long as we get her back,
dialog: nobody's in a position to complain.
dialog: And we keep the baksheesh.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Terrific, Walter. But you haven't
dialog: told me how we get her back. Where
dialog: is she?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: That's the simple part, Dude. When
dialog: we make the handoff, I grab the guy
text: and beat it out of him.
text: He looks at the Dude.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: ...Huh?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah. That's a great plan, Walter.
dialog: That's fucking ingenious, if I
dialog: understand it correctly. That's a
dialog: Swiss fucking watch.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Thaaat's right, Dude. The beauty of
dialog: this is its simplicity. If the plan
dialog: gets too complex something always
dialog: goes wrong. If there's one thing I
dialog: learned in Nam--
text: The phone chirps.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Dude.

speaker_heading: FUCK.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What'd he say? Where's the hand-
dialog: off?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: There is no fucking hand-off, Walter!
text: At a wooden bridge we throw the money
dialog: out of the car!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: DUDE
text: We throw the money out of the moving
dialog: car!
text: Walter stares dumbly for a beat.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: We can't do that, Dude. That fucks
dialog: up our plan.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Well call them up and explain it to
dialog: 'em, Walter! Your plan is so fucking
dialog: simple, I'm sure they'd fucking
dialog: understand it! That's the beauty of
dialog: it Walter!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Wooden bridge, huh?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I'm throwing the money, Walter!
dialog: We're not fucking around!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: The bridge is coming up! Gimme the
dialog: ringer, Dude! Chop-chop!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Fuck that! I love you, Walter, but
dialog: sooner or later you're gonna have to
dialog: face the fact that you're a goddamn
dialog: moron.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Okay, Dude. No time to argue. Here's
dialog: the bridge--
text: There is the bump and new steady of the car on the bridge.
text: The Dude is twisting around to pull the money briefcase from
text: the back seat. Walter reaches one arm across Dude's body to
dialog: grab the laundry.
dialog: And there goes the ringer.
text: He flings it out the window.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Walter!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Your wheel, Dude! I'm rolling out!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: What the fuck?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Your wheel! At fifteen em-pee-aitch
text: I roll out! I double back, grab one
dialog: of 'em and beat it out of him! The
dialog: uzi!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Uzi?
text: Walter points across the seat at the paper-wrapped bundle.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You didn't think I was rolling out
dialog: of here naked!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Walter, please--
text: Walter has flung open his door and is leaning halfway out
text: over the road.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Fifteen! This is it, Dude! Let's
dialog: take that hill!
text: Walter rolls out with his parcel, giving a loud grunt as he
text: hits the pavement. The car swerves and lurches and the Dude,
text: cursing, takes the wheel.
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE
text: Walter tumbles onto the shoulder and--RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!--muzzle
text: flashes tear open the wrapping paper.
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE CAR
text: The car rocks and the Dude wrestles with the wheel.
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE
text: The car clunks and screams around in a skid.
speaker_heading: INSIDE
text: The Dude is thrown forward as the car hits something.
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE
text: As the Dude struggles out holding the satchel of money. The
text: front of his car is crumpled into a tree. The car body saps
text: back to the left, where the rear wheel has been shot out.
text: WALTER is just rising from the ground massaging an
text: injured knee.
text: The Dude runs up the road toward the bridge,
text: frantically waving the satchel in the air.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: WE HAVE IT! WE HAVE IT!!
text: There is a distant engine roar. A motorcycle bumps up onto
text: the road from the ravine under the bridge and, tires
text: squealing, skids around to speed away in the opposite
text: direction. It is closely followed by two more roaring
dialog: motorcycles.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: WE HAVE IT!!. . . We have it!
text: The Dude and Walter stand in the middle of the road, watching
text: the three red tail lights fishtail away.
text: AFTER A LONG STARING SILENCE:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Ahh fuck it, let's go bowling.
speaker_heading: BOWLING LANE
text: A ball rumbles in to scatter ten pins.
speaker_heading: WALTER.
text: He turns from the lane to where the Dude sits in the nook of
text: molded plastic chairs. The Dude listlessly holds the portable
text: phone in his lap. It is ringing.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Aitz chaim he, Dude. As the ex used
dialog: to say.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: What the fuck is that supposed to
dialog: mean? What the fuck're we gonna
dialog: tell Lebowski?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Huh? Oh, him, yeah. Well I don't
dialog: see, um-- what exactly is the problem?
text: The portable phone stops ringing.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Huh? The problem is--what do you
dialog: mean what's the--there's no--we didn't--
dialog: they're gonna kill that poor woman--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What the fuck're you talking about?
dialog: That poor woman--that poor slut--
dialog: kidnapped herself, Dude. You said
dialog: so yourself--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: No, Walter! I said I thought she
dialog: kidnapped herself! You're the one
dialog: who's so fucking certain--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: That's right, Dude, 1 % certain--
text: Donny is trotting excitedly up.
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: They posted the next round of the

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: This Saturday. Quintana and--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Saturday! Well they'll have to
dialog: reschedule.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I told that fuck down at the league
dialog: office-- who's in charge of
dialog: scheduling?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Walter--
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: Burkhalter.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I told that kraut a fucking thousand
dialog: times I don't roll on shabbas.
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: It's already posted.
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Who gives a shit, Walter? What about
dialog: that poor woman? What do we tell--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get
dialog: sick of her little game and, you
dialog: know, wander back--
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: How come you don't roll on Saturday,
dialog: Walter?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm shomer shabbas.
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: What's that, Walter?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah, and in the meantime what do I
dialog: tell Lebowski?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Saturday is shabbas. Jewish day of
dialog: rest. Means I don't work, I don't
dialog: drive a car, I don't fucking ride in
dialog: a car, I don't handle money, I don't
dialog: turn on the oven, and I sure as shit

speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: Sheesh.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Walter, how--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Shomer shabbas.
text: The Dude gets to his feet with the portable phone.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: That's it. I'm out of here.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: For Christ's sake, Dude.
text: Walter and Donny join the Dude as he walks out of the bowling
dialog: alley.
dialog: Hell, you just tell him--well, you tell him, uh, we made the
dialog: hand-off, everything went, uh, you know--
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: Oh yeah, how'd it go?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Went alright. Dude's car got a little
dialog: dinged up--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: But Walter, we didn't make the fucking
dialog: hand- off! They didn't get, the
dialog: fucking money and they're gonna--
dialog: they're gonna--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."
text: He waves both arms as if conducting a symphony orchestra.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Kill that poor woman.
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: Walter, if you can't ride in a car,
dialog: how d'you get around on Shammas--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Really, Dude, you surprise me.
dialog: They're not gonna kill shit. They're
dialog: not gonna do shit. What can they
dialog: do? Fuckin' amateurs. And meanwhile,
dialog: look at the bottom line. Who's
dialog: sitting on a million fucking dollars?
dialog: Am I wrong?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Walter--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Who's got a fucking million fucking
dialog: dollars parked in the trunk of our
dialog: car out here?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: "Our" car, Walter?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: And what do they got, Dude? My dirty
dialog: undies. My fucking whites--Say,
dialog: where is the car?
text: The three bowlers, stopped at the edge of the lot, stare out
text: at an empty parking space.
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: Who has your undies, Walter?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Where's your car, Dude?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: You don't know, Walter? You seem to
dialog: know the answer to everything else!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Hmm. Well, we were in a handicapped
dialog: spot. It, uh, it was probably towed.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: It's been stolen, Walter! You fucking
dialog: know it's been stolen!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Well, certainly that's a possibility,
dialog: Dude--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Aw, fuck it.
text: The Dude walks away across the lot. The portable phone starts
text: ringing again.
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: Where you going, Dude?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I'm going home, Donny.
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: Your phone's ringing, Dude.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Thank you, Donny.
scene_heading: DUDE'S LIVING ROOM
text: The Dude is slumped disconsolately back in his easy chair,
text: fingers of one hand cupped over his sunglasses. Facing him
text: on the couch are two uniformed policeman, one middle-aged,
text: the other a fresh-faced rookie.
text: At the cut the portable phone, in the Dude's lap, is chirping.
text: The Dude waits for the rings to end. When they do:
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: 1972 Pontiac LeBaron.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER COP
dialog: Color?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Green. Some brown, or, uh, rust,
dialog: coloration.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER COP
dialog: And was there anything of value in
dialog: the car?
speaker_heading: DULLY:
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Huh? Oh. Yeah. Tape deck. Couple
dialog: of Creedence tapes. And there was
dialog: a, uh. . . my briefcase.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER COP
dialog: In the briefcase?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Papers. Just papers. You know, my
dialog: papers. Business papers.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER COP
dialog: And what do you do, sir?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I'm unemployed.
speaker_heading: OLDER COP
dialog: ...Most people, we're working nights,
dialog: they offer us coffee.
text: There is silence. Dude continues to stare at a spot on the
text: floor. The older cop stares at him.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: ...Me, I don't drink coffee. But
dialog: it's nice when they offer.
speaker_heading: AT LENGTH:
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: ...Also, my rug was stolen.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER COP
dialog: Your rug was in the car.
text: The Dude taps the floor with his foot.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: No. Here.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER COP
dialog: Separate incidents?
text: The Dude stares at the floor.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: OLDER COP
dialog: Snap out of it, son.
text: The home phone starts ringing--a ring distinct from the
text: chirp of the portable. The Dude makes no move to answer
text: it. Finally the rings stop as an answering machine kicks
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: You find them much? Stolen cars?
dialog: Dude's Voice on Machine The Dude's not in. Leave a message
text: after the beep. It takes a minute.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER COP
dialog: Sometimes. I wouldn't hold out much
dialog: hope for the tape deck though. Or
dialog: the Creedence tapes.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: And the, uh, the briefcase?
dialog: Beep.
scene_heading: FEMALE VOICE ON MACHINE
dialog: Mr. Lebowski, I'd like to see you.
dialog: Call when you get home and I'll send
dialog: a car for you. My name is Maude
dialog: Lebowski. I'm the woman who took
dialog: the rug.
text: Beep. Dial tone.
speaker_heading: OLDER COP
dialog: Well, I guess we can close the file
dialog: on that one.
scene_heading: TRACKING FORWARD
text: We are moving through the open living area of a large downtown
text: L.A. loft. A huge unfinished canvas, lit by standing
text: industrial lights, dominates one wall. The furnishings are
text: spare given the space. On the floor is the Dude's brilliant
dialog: rug.
text: We hear a rumble like an approaching bowling ball. The Dude,
text: standing in the middle of the loft, looks into the murky
text: depths of the cavernous space.
text: Something huge and white hurtles towards the Dude's head.
text: As it roars overhead he ducks, and spins to watch it pass.
text: We see the backside of a naked woman in a sling suspended
text: from a ceiling track rumbling over a canvas that lies on the
text: floor. She is holding a paint bucket in one hand and a brush
text: in the other, with which she flicks paint down at the canvas.
text: The Dude turns again as he hears running footsteps. Two
text: young men in paint-spattered shorts, T-shirts and sneakers
text: reach the sling shortly after it reaches the end of its track
dialog: and haul it back for another push.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I'll be with you in a minute, Mr.
dialog: Lebowski.
text: She rumbles by in another pass.
dialog: All right, we'll do the blue tomorrow. Elfranco. Pedro.
dialog: Help me down.
text: The two men help Maude out of her sling. She is naked
text: except for leather harness straps which ring her breasts
text: and wrap her thighs and give her something of a dominatrix
dialog: look.
dialog: Does the female form make you uncomfor- table, Mr. Lebowski?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Is that what that's a picture of?
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: In a sense, yes. Elfranco, my robe.
dialog: My art has been commended as being
dialog: strongly vaginal. Which bothers
dialog: some men. The word itself makes
text: some men uncomfortable. Vagina.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Yes, they don't like hearing it and
dialog: find it difficult to say. Whereas
dialog: without batting an eye a man will
dialog: refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or
dialog: his "Johnson".
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: "Johnson"?
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Thank you.
text: This to Elfranco, who has handed her a robe.
dialog: All right, Mr. Lebowski, let's get down to cases. My father
dialog: told me he's agreed to let you have the rug, but it was a
dialog: gift from me to my late mother, and so was not his to give.
dialog: Now. As for this. . . "kidnapping"--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Yes, I know about it. And I know
dialog: that you acted as courier. And let
dialog: me tell you something: the whole
dialog: thing stinks to high heaven.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Right, but let me explain something
dialog: about that rug--
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Sex. The physical act of love.
dialog: Coitus. Do you like it?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I was talking about my rug.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: You're not interested in sex?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: You mean coitus?
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: I like it too. It's a male myth
dialog: about feminists that we hate sex.
dialog: It can be a natural, zesty enterprise.
dialog: But unfortunately there are some
dialog: people--it is called satyriasis in
dialog: men, nymphomania in women--who engage
text: in it compulsively and without joy.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Oh, no.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate
dialog: souls cannot love in the true sense
dialog: of the word. Our mutual acquaintance
dialog: Bunny is one of these.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your
dialog: stepmother is a nympho, but I don't
dialog: see what it has to do with--do you
dialog: have any kalhua?
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Take a look at this, sir.
text: She is aiming a remote at a projection TV. The screen
text: flickers to life. A title card:
scene_heading: JACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS
speaker_heading: SECOND CARD:
speaker_heading: KARL HUNGUS
speaker_heading: AND
speaker_heading: BUNNY LAJOYA
speaker_heading: IN
speaker_heading: A THIRD CARD:
speaker_heading: LOGJAMMIN'
text: The Dude is at the bar, a bottle of kalhua frozen halfway
text: to his glass.
text: From the television set we hear a doorbell ring, and then a
text: door opening.
text: On the TV screen the door opens to reveal a sallow-faced
text: man in blue coyer-alls. It is Dieter, the floater in
text: Lebowski's pool.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: Hello. Nein dizbatcher says zere
dialog: iss problem mit deine kable.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Shit, I know that guy. He's a
dialog: nihilist.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: And you recognize her, of course.
text: The girl answering the door is Bunny Lebowski.
dialog: Bunny The TV is in here.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: Za, okay, I bring mein toolz.
dialog: Bunny This is my friend Shari. She just came over to use
dialog: the shower.

speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Lord. You can imagine where it goes
dialog: from here.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: He fixes the cable?
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey. Little
dialog: matter to me that this woman chose
dialog: to pursue a career
text: in pornography, nor that she has been "banging" Jackie
dialog: Treehorn, to use the parlance of our times. However. I am
dialog: one of two trustees of the Lebowski Foundation, the other
dialog: being my father. The Foundation takes youngsters from Watts
dialog: and--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Shit yeah, the achievers.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Little Lebowski Urban Achievers,
dialog: yes, and proud we are of all of them.
dialog: I asked my father about his withdrawal
dialog: of a million dollars from the
dialog: Foundation account and he told me
dialog: about this "abduction", but I tell
dialog: you it is preposterous. This
dialog: compulsive
dialog: fornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah, but my-
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: I'm getting to your rug. My father
dialog: and I don't get along; he doesn't
dialog: approve of my lifestyle and, needless
dialog: to say, I don't approve of his.
dialog: Still, I hardly wish to make my
dialog: father's embezzlement a police matter,
dialog: so I'm proposing that you try to
dialog: recover the money from the people
dialog: you delivered it to.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Well--sure, I could do that--
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: If you successfully do so, I will
dialog: compensate you to the tune of 1% of
dialog: the recovered sum.
speaker_heading: DUDE
text: A hundred.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Thousand, yes, bones or clams or
dialog: whatever you call them.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah, but what about--
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: --your rug, yes, well with that money
dialog: you can buy any number of rugs that
dialog: don't have sentimental value for me.
dialog: And I am sorry about that crack on
text: the jaw.
text: The Dude fingers his jaw, where the lump from the sap has
text: all but disappeared.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Oh that's okay, I hardly even--
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Here's the name and number of a doctor
dialog: who will look at it for you. You
dialog: will receive no bill. He's a good
dialog: man, and thorough.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: That's really thoughtful but I--
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Please see him, Jeffrey. He's a
dialog: good man, and thorough.
speaker_heading: LIMO
text: The Dude sits in back holding a White Russian, listening to
text: the chauffeur, a man of about the same age from whose livery
text: cap a ponytail emerges.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: --So he says, "My son can't hold a
dialog: job, my daughter's married to a

dialog: But you know me. I can't complain."
scene_heading: THROUGH RASPING LAUGHTER:
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Fuckin' A, man. I got a rash.
dialog: Fuckin' A, man. I gotta tell ya
dialog: Tony.
text: He takes a sip of a freshly-mixed White Russian, which leaves
text: milk on his mustache.
dialog: I was feeling really shitty earlier in the day, I'd lost a
dialog: little money, I was down in the dumps.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Aw, forget about it.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah, man! Fuck it! I can't be
dialog: worrying about that shit. Life goes
dialog: on!
text: The limo has rolled to a stop. The Dude gets out, still
text: holding his drink.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Home sweet home, Mr. L. Who's your
dialog: friend in the Volkswagon?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Huh?
text: His eyes on the rearview mirror, Tony jerks a thumb over his
dialog: shoulder.
dialog: He followed us here.
text: The Dude turns to look.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Halfway up the block a Volkswagon bug has pulled over to the
text: curb. In the driver's seat we see a fat man's shape.
speaker_heading: THE DUDE
text: He scowls.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: When did he-
text: The Dude is grabbed from behind and muscled away in a half-
text: nelson by another uniformed chauffeur.
scene_heading: SECOND CHAUFFEUR
dialog: Into the limo, you sonofabitch. No
dialog: arguments.
text: As he is frog-marched towards another limo the Dude holds
text: his drink away from his chest and cups a hand underneath it.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Fuck, man! There's a beverage here!
text: The waiting limo's back door is flung open.
speaker_heading: INSIDE
text: The Dude is shoved in and awkwardly takes a seat facing the
text: rear. The door is slammed behind him.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Start talking and talk fast you lousy
dialog: bum!
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: We've been frantically trying to
dialog: reach you, Dude.
text: Brandt sits catty-corner from the Dude; directly across from
text: the Dude is the big Lebowski, a comforter across his knees.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Well we--I don't--
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: They did not receive the money, you

speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: WHAT?!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I--the royal we, you know, the

dialog: information, certain things have
dialog: come to light, and uh, has it ever

dialog: including to known pornographers--
dialog: and that's cool, that's cool-- but
dialog: I'm saying, she needs money, and of
dialog: course they're gonna say they didn't
dialog: get it 'cause she wants more, man,
dialog: she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean--
dialog: hasn't that ever occurred to you...?
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: No. No Mr. Lebowski, that had not
dialog: occurred to me.
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: That had not occurred to us, Dude.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Well, okay, you're not privy to all
dialog: the new shit, so uh, you know, but
dialog: that's what you pay me for. Speaking
dialog: of which, would it be possible for
dialog: me to get my twenty grand in cash?
dialog: I gotta check this with my accountant
dialog: of course, but my concern is that,
dialog: you know, it could bump me into a
dialog: higher tax--
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Brandt, give him the envelope.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Well, okay, if you've already made
text: out the check. Brandt is handing
text: him a letter-sized envelope which is
text: distended by something inside.
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: We received it this morning.
text: The Dude, frowning, untucks its flap, takes out some cotton
text: wadding and unrolls it.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Since you have failed to achieve,
dialog: even in the modest task that was
dialog: your charge, since you have stolen
dialog: my money, and since you have
dialog: unrepentantly betrayed my trust.
text: The wadding, undone, reveals a smaller wad of gauze taped up
text: inside. The Dude undoes the tape with his fingernails and
text: starts to unroll the inner package.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: I have no choice but to tell these
dialog: bums that they should do whatever is
dialog: necessary to recover their money
dialog: from you, Jeffrey Lebowski. And
dialog: with Brandt as my witness, tell you
dialog: this: Any further harm visited upon
dialog: Bunny, shall be visited tenfold upon
dialog: your head.
text: Between thumb and forefinger the Dude holds up the contents
text: of the package--a little toe, with emerald green nail polish.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: ...By God sir. I will not abide
dialog: another toe.
speaker_heading: COFFEE SHOP
text: The Dude and Walter sit at the counter, both staring off
text: into space, both absently stirring their coffee with little
text: clinking noises.
scene_heading: AFTER A LONG BEAT:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: That wasn't her toe.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Whose toe was it, Walter?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: How the fuck should I know? I do
dialog: know that nothing about it indicates--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: The nail polish, Walter.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Fine, Dude. As if it's impossible
dialog: to get some nail polish, apply it to
dialog: someone else's toe--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Someone else's--where the fuck are
dialog: they gonna--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You want a toe? I can get you a
dialog: toe, believe me. There are ways,
dialog: Dude. You don't wanna know about
dialog: it, believe me.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: But Walter--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'll get you a toe by this
dialog: afternoon--with nail polish. These
dialog: fucking amateurs. They send us a
dialog: toe, we're supposed to shit our-
dialog: selves with fear. Jesus Christ. My
dialog: point is--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: They're gonna kill her, Walter, and
dialog: then they're gonna kill me--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Well that's just, that's the stress
dialog: talking, Dude. So far we have what
text: looks to me like a series of
dialog: victimless crimes--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: What about the toe?
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!
text: A waitress enters.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Could you please keep your voices
dialog: down--this is a family restaurant.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Oh, please dear! I've got news for
dialog: you: the Supreme Court has roundly
dialog: rejected prior restraint!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Walter, this isn't a First Amendment
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Sir, if you don't calm down I'm going
dialog: to have to ask you to leave.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Lady, I got buddies who died face-
dialog: down in the muck so you and I could
dialog: enjoy this family restaurant!
dialog: THE DUDE GETS UP:
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: All right, I'm leaving. I'm sorry
dialog: ma'am.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Don't run away from this, Dude!
dialog: Goddamnit, this affects all of us!
text: The Dude has left frame; Walter calls after him:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Our basic freedoms!
text: He looks defiantly around.
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: I'm staying. Finishing my coffee.
text: He stirs the coffee, bopping his head in time to the Muzak,
text: affecting nonchalance.
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: Finishing my coffee.
scene_heading: DUDE'S BATHROOM
text: A dripping noise.
text: The Dude sits in the bathtub, staring stuporously, a joint
text: pinched in one hand, a washcloth draped over his head.
text: We hear the phone ringing in the other roam.
text: The Dude is staring at his toes, which protrude from the
text: soapy water, splayed against the far side of the tub.
text: After the Dude's outgoing message we hear:
scene_heading: VOICE THROUGH MACHINE
dialog: Mr. Lebowski, this is Duty Officer
dialog: Rolvaag of the L.A.P.D.
text: The Dude looks stuporously up, his head swaying.
scene_heading: VOICE THROUGH MACHINE
dialog: We've recovered your vehicle. It
dialog: can be claimed at the North Hollywood
text: Auto Circus there on Victory.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Far out. Far fuckin' out.
speaker_heading: MESSAGE
dialog: You'll just need to present a--
text: The message is interrupted by loud smashing sounds, as of
text: someone applying a baseball bat to the answering machine.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Hunh?
text: He looks blearily at the open doorway.
text: A tall man dressed in black leather with a cricket paddle is
text: striding across the living room towards the bathroom.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Hey! This is a private residence,
dialog: man!
text: The man has entered the bathroom and, in stride, swings the
text: cricket paddle up to smash the overhead light. Two other
text: men are entering behind him.
text: The room is dark now except for spill from the living room;
text: the men are backlit shapes.
text: One of them holds a string at the other end of which a small
text: animal skitters excitedly about the floor.
text: The Dude looks curiously at the small, nattering animal.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Nice marmot.
text: The man with the string scoops up the marmot and tosses it,
text: screaming, into the bathtub.
text: The Dude screams.
text: The marmot splashes frantically, biting at the Dude in a
text: frenzy of fearful aggression.
speaker_heading: FIRST MAN
dialog: Vee vant zat money, Lebowski.
text: The Dude, screaming, grabs the lip of the tub and starts to
text: hoist himself up but the first man lays a palm on top of his
text: head and squishes him back into the water.
speaker_heading: SECOND MAN
dialog: You think veer kidding und making
dialog: mit de funny stuff?
speaker_heading: THIRD MAN
dialog: Vee could do things you only dreamed
dialog: of, Lebowski.
speaker_heading: SECOND MAN
dialog: Ja, vee could really do it, Lebowski.
dialog: Vee belief in nossing.
text: He scoops the marmot out of the water. It shakes itself
text: off, spraying the Dude.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Jesus!
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: Vee belief in nossing, Lebowski!
dialog: NOSSING!!
text: The marmot, back on the floor, is skittering around, shaking
text: itself and convulsing in little sneezes.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Jesus Christ!
speaker_heading: FIRST MAN
dialog: Tomorrow vee come back und cut off
dialog: your chonson.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: FIRST MAN
dialog: I SAY VEE CUT OFF YOUR CHONSON!
text: The three men turn to leave. Over their retreating backs:
speaker_heading: SECOND MAN
dialog: Just sink about zat, Lebowski.
speaker_heading: FIRST MAN
dialog: Ja, your viggly penis, Lebowski.
speaker_heading: SECOND MAN
dialog: Ja, und maybe vee stamp on it und
dialog: skvush it, Lebowski!
scene_heading: NORTH HOLLYWOOD AUTO CIRCUS
text: A policeman with a clipboard is leading the Dude through a
text: large parking lot.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: You're lucky she wasn't chopped, Mr.
dialog: Lebowski. Must've been a joyride
dialog: situation; they abandoned the car
text: once they hit the retaining wall.
text: They have reached the Dude's car. The driver's side
text: exterior has been scraped raw. The policeman hands the Dude
text: a door handle and an exterior rear-view mirror.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
text: These were on the road next to the
dialog: car. You'll have to get in on the
dialog: other side.
text: The Dude climbs in the passenger side.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: My fucking briefcase! It's not here!
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Yeah, sorry, I saw that on the report.
dialog: You're lucky they left the tape deck
dialog: though.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: My fucking briefcase! Jesus--what's
dialog: that smell?
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Uh, yeah. Probably a vagrant, slept
text: in the car. Or perhaps just used it
text: as a toilet, and moved on.
text: The Dude tries to roll down the driver's window but it will
text: not go; he bellows through the glass:
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: When will you find these guys? I
dialog: mean, do you have any promising leads?
text: The policeman laughs, agreeing broadly.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Leads, yeah. I'll just check with
text: the boys down at the Crime Lab.
dialog: They've assigned four more detectives
dialog: to the case, got us working in shifts.
text: The Dude looks sadly through his window at the policeman
text: rocking back on his heels, his raucous laughter muffled by
dialog: the glass.
scene_heading: BOWLING ALLEY BAR
text: The Dude, Walter and Donny sit at the bar, the Dude with a
text: White Russian, Walter with a beer, and Donny eating beer
dialog: nuts.
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Oh for Christ--will you shut the
dialog: fuck up, Donny.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I figure my only hope is that the
dialog: big Lebowski kills me before the
dialog: Germans can cut my dick off.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Now that is ridiculous, Dude. No
dialog: one is going to cut your dick off.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Thanks Walter.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Not if I have anything to say about
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: Yeah, thanks Walter. That gives me
dialog: a very secure feeling.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Dude--
speaker_heading: DUDE
text: That makes me feel all warm inside.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Now Dude--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: This whole fucking thing--I could
dialog: be sitting here with just pee-stains
dialog: on my rug.
text: Walter sadly shakes his head.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Fucking Germans. Nothing changes.
dialog: Fucking Nazis.
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: They were Nazis, Dude?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Come on, Donny, they were threatening
dialog: castration!
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Are you gonna split hairs?
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: No--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Am I wrong?
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: Well--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: They're nihilists.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: They kept saying they believe in
dialog: nothing.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Nihilists! Jesus.
text: Walter looks haunted.
dialog: Say what you like about the tenets of National Socialism,
dialog: Dude, at least it's an ethos.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: And let's also not forget--let's not
dialog: forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife,
dialog: an amphibious rodent, for uh,
dialog: domestic, you know, within the city--
dialog: that isn't legal either.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: What're you, a fucking park ranger
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: No, I'm--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Who gives a shit about the fucking
dialog: marmot!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: --We're sympathizing here, Dude--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Fuck your sympathy! I don't need
dialog: your sympathy, man, I need my fucking
dialog: Johnson!
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: What do you need that for, Dude?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You gotta buck up, man, you can't go
dialog: into the tournament with this negative
dialog: attitude--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Fuck the tournament! Fuck you,
dialog: Walter!
text: There is a moment of stunned silence.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Fuck the tournament?!
speaker_heading: SAD; QUIET:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Okay Dude. I can see you don't want
dialog: to be cheered up. C'mon Donny, let's
dialog: go get a lane.
text: They leave the Dude sitting morosely at the bar. As he stares
text: DOWN INTO HIS EMPTY GLASS:
speaker_heading: DUDE
text: Another Caucasian, Gary.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Right, Dude.
text: STILL STARING DOWN AT THE BAR:
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Friends like these, huh Gary.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: That's right, Dude.
text: The pop song on the jukebox has ended; someone puts on
text: "Tumbling Tumbleweeds."
text: A man saunters up to the bar to take the stool that Walter
text: vacated. He is middle-aged, amiable, craggily handsome--Sam
text: Elliot, perhaps. He has a large Western-style mustache and
text: wears denims, a yoked shirt and a cowboy hat.
scene_heading: TO THE BARTENDER:
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: D'ya have a good sarsaparilla?
text: We recognize the voice of The Stranger whose narration opened
dialog: the movie.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Sioux City Sarsaparilla.
text: The Stranger nods.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: That's a good one.
text: Waiting for his drink, he looks amiably around the bar. His
text: crinkled eyes settle on the Dude.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: How ya doin' there, Dude?
text: The Dude, still staring down at his drink, shakes his head.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Ahh, not so good, man.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: One a those days, huh. Wal, a wiser
dialog: fella than m'self once said, sometimes
dialog: you eat the bar and sometimes the
dialog: bar, wal, he eats you.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: (absently)
dialog: Uh-huh. That some kind of Eastern
dialog: thing?
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: Far from it.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Mm.
text: The bartender puts a brown bottle and a frosted glass on the
text: bar in front of The Stranger, who touches his hat brim.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: Much obliged.
text: He looks back at the Dude.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: I like your style, Dude.
text: THE DUDE LOOKS UP, ABSENTLY:
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Well I like your style too, man.
dialog: Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude.
dialog: D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?
text: The Dude looks at The Stranger as if just now noticing how
text: out of place the cowpoke is.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: The fuck are you talking about?
text: The Stranger chuckles indulgently and pushes off from the
dialog: bar.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: Okay, have it your way.
text: He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: Take it easy, Dude.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah. Thanks man.
text: He is gone. "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" is ending as we hear an
text: offscreen voice, breaking the spell:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Dude! Dude!
scene_heading: THE DUDE LOOKS:
text: Tony, the unformed limo driver, is at the door of the bar,
text: beckoning.
speaker_heading: MAUDE'S LOFT
text: She strides toward us, naked under a robe which she is just
text: cinching shut. Paint flecks her skin.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the
dialog: doctor.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: No it's fine, really, uh--
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Do you have any news regarding my
dialog: father's money?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta
dialog: respecfully, 69 you know, tender my
dialog: resignation on that matter, 'cause
dialog: it looks like your mother really was
dialog: kidnapped after all.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: She most certainly was not!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Hey man, why don't you fucking listen
dialog: occasionally? You might learn
dialog: something. Now I got--
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: And please don't call her my mother.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Now I got--
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: She is most definitely the perpetrator
dialog: and not the victim.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I'm telling you, I got definitive
dialog: evidence--
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: From who?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: The main guy, Dieter--
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Dieter Hauff?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Well--yeah, I guess--
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Beaver? You mean vagina?--I mean,
dialog: you know him?
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Dieter has been on the fringes of--
dialog: well, of everything in L.A., for
dialog: about twenty years. Look at my LP's.
dialog: Under 'Autobahn.'
text: The Dude fingers through the albums filling one bookshelf.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: That was his group--they released
dialog: one album in the mid-seventies.
text: The Dude stops between two albums.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Huh? Autobahn. A-u-t-o. Their
dialog: music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.
text: The Dude pulls out an album with a worn sleeve. On it is
text: the group's name, Autobahn, the album name, Nagelbett, and a
dialog: picture
text: OF THREE YOUNG GERMANS, THEIR FOREHEADS LOOMING BELOW
speaker_heading: SLICKED-
text: back hair, gazing upward in thin-lipped epiphany. They are
text: wearing severe but modishly retro suits. Each has his name
text: under his picture--Dieter, Kieffer; and Franz. A bed of
text: nails is the only set dressing on the cyc.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Jeez. I miss vinyl.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
text: Is he pretending to be the abductor?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Well...yeah--
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Look, Jeffrey, you don't really
dialog: kidnap someone that you're acquainted
dialog: with. You can't get away with it if
dialog: the hostage knows who you are.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Well yeah...I know that.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: So Dieter has the money?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Well, no, not exactly. It's a
dialog: complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins.
dialog: Lotta outs. And a lotta strands to
dialog: keep in my head, man. Lotta strands
dialog: in old Duder's--
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Do you still have that doctor's
dialog: number?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Huh? No, really, I don't even have
dialog: the bruise any more, I--
text: She is scribbling.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Please Jeffrey. I don't want to be
dialog: responsible for any delayed after-
dialog: effects.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Delayed after-eff--
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: I want you to see him immediately.
text: She is picking up a telephone.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: I'll see if he's available. He's a
dialog: good man, and thorough.
text: CLOSE SHOT THE DUDE
text: His eyes are closed, a headset on, his shirt off. Leaking
text: tinnily through the headset we hear the opening bars of
dialog: "Comin' Up Around the Bend."
text: Behind him, cropped so that we see only a little of his torso,
text: a white-smocked figure taps at the Dude's back. After a
text: moment the figure circles to one side, out of frame. His
text: hand reaches in to pull one arm of the headset away from the
text: Dude's ear, and as he does so the music issues more strongly.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Could you slide your shorts down
dialog: please, Mr. Lebowski?
text: The Dude's eyes open.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Huh? No, she, she hit me right here.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I understand sir. Could you slide
dialog: your shorts down please?
speaker_heading: DUDE'S CAR
text: The Dude is driving home. A Creedence tape plays. The Dude
text: is sucking down a joint. He glances at the rear-view mirror--
text: and, noticing something, looks again.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: A Volkswagon bug is following, a lone fat man driving.
speaker_heading: THE DUDE
text: His eyes still on the mirror, he absently takes the joint
text: between thumb and forefinger of his right hand and flicks it
text: out the driver's window--except that the window is not open.
text: The butt bounces off the glass and around the car, showering
text: sparks.
speaker_heading: DUDE'S CROTCH
text: The glowing butt rolls down the car seat between his legs.
text: The Dude screams.
speaker_heading: THE STREET
text: The car careens wildly as the surrounding traffic veers off
text: to, make way, horns blaring. The car finally spins and comes
text: to rest with its passenger side wrapped into a telephone
dialog: poll.
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE CAR
text: The Dude frantically grabs at his door, which won't open,
text: and then slides over to push at the passenger door, which
dialog: also won't open.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Fuck Me.
text: But he is sitting on the passenger side now, away from
text: the lit butt. He looks around for it.
text: Smoke is wisping up from between the Driver's seat cushion
dialog: and back cushion.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Fuckola, man.
text: He takes his beer and pours it in between the cushions.
text: There is a hissing sound. But there is a piece of paper
text: sticking out from between the cushions.
text: The Dude pulls it out.
text: It is lined spiral notebook paper, slightly singed and
text: dripping beer, covered with handwriting. In the upper right-
text: hand corner is the name Lawrence Sellers, and under that,
text: Mrs. Jamtoss 5th Period. The theme is titled "The Louisiana
text: Purchase." In red ink is a large circled D and some
text: handwritten marginal comments; misspelled words are circled
text: in red throughout.
scene_heading: CRANE JACKSON'S FOUNTAIN STREET THEATER
text: We are behind Walter, the Dude, and Donny, facing the stage
text: in the background where Allan, the Dude's balding landlord,
text: is performing a dance moderne.
text: As Walter talks to the Dude he leans in to him, his voice
text: hushed, so as not to disturb the rest of the very sparse
dialog: audience.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: He lives in North Hollywood on
text: Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
speaker_heading: DUDE
text: The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: Near the In-and-Out Burger--
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: Those are good burgers, Walter.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Shut the fuck up, Donny. This kid

speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Who the fuck is that?
speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: DUDE

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Who the f--have you ever heard of a

speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: WALTER

dialog: Creek?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote
dialog: 156 episodes, Dude.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: The bulk of the series.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Not exactly a lightweight.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Uh.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah, go figure. Well we'll go out

text: He waves a hand vaguely toward the stage.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What have you. We'll, uh--
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Shut the fuck up, Donny. We'll, uh,
dialog: brace the kid--he'll be a pushover.
dialog: We'll get that fucking money, if he
dialog: hasn't spent it already. Million
dialog: fucking clams. And yes, we'll be
dialog: near the, uh--some burgers, some
dialog: beers, a few laughs. Our fucking
dialog: troubles are over, Dude.
scene_heading: RESIDENTIAL AREA
text: The Dude and Walter are pulling up in front of a dilapidated
text: house sitting on a scrubby lot. Parked incongruously in
text: front of the house is a brand new red Corvette.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Fuck me, man! That kid's already
dialog: spent all the money!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Hardly Dude, a new 'vette? The kid's
dialog: still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand,
dialog: depending on the options. Wait in
dialog: the car, Donny.
speaker_heading: THE FRONT DOOR
text: Walter rings the bell. It is opened by a matronly Spanish

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Jace?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Hello, Pilar? My name is Walter
dialog: Sobchak, we spoke on the phone, this
dialog: is my associate Jeffrey Lebowski.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Jace.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: May we uh, we wanted to talk about

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Jace.
text: They enter a dim living room and stand, looking about, as
speaker_heading: Pilar
text: CALLS UP THE STAIRS:
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: Larry! Sweetie! Dat mang is here!
text: There is a rhythmic compressor sound; Walter places it and
text: nudges the Dude. At the other end of the living room a man
text: lies on something that looks like a hospital gurney with its
text: midsection enclosed by a motorized stainless-steel bubble.
text: It is an iron lung, artificially breathing with distinct
text: hisses in and out.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: That's him, Dude.

dialog: And a good day to you, sir.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: See down, please.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Thank you, ma'am.
text: He and the Dude sit on a sagging green sofa. In a lowered
dialog: voice, to Pilar:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Does he, uh. . . Is he still writing?
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: No, no. He has healt' problems.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: HE BELLOWS ACROSS THE ROOM:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I just want to say, sir, that we're
dialog: both enormous--on a personal level,
dialog: Branded, especially the early
dialog: episodes, has been a source of, uh,
dialog: inspir---
text: There are footsteps on the stairs. Larry, a fifteen-year-
text: old, looks at the two men.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: See down, Sweetie. These are the
dialog: policeman--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: No ma'am, I didn't mean to give the
dialog: impression that we're police exactly.
dialog: We're hoping that it will not be
dialog: necessary to call the police.
text: He adopts his command voice in turning to Larry:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: But that is up to little Larry here.
dialog: Isn't it, Larry?
text: Walter pops the latches on his attache case and takes out
text: the homework, which is now in a ziploc bag. He holds it out
text: at arm's length, displaying it to Larry.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Is this your homework, Larry?
text: Larry does not respond.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Is this your homework, Larry?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Look, man, did you--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Dude, please!. . . Is this your
dialog: homework, Larry?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Just ask him if he--ask him about
dialog: the car, man!
text: Walter is still holding out the homework.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Is this yours, Larry? Is this your
dialog: homework, Larry?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Is the car out front yours?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Is this your homework, Larry?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: We know it's his fucking homework,
dialog: Walter! Where's the fucking money,
dialog: you little brat?
text: Throughout Walter has been staring at Larry with the homework
text: extended towards him.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard
dialog: of Vietnam?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You're going to enter a world of
dialog: pain, son. We know that this is
dialog: your homework. We know you stole a
dialog: car--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: And the fucking money!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: And the fucking money. And we know
dialog: that this is your homework, Larry.
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You're gonna KILL your FATHER, Larry!.
scene_heading: FINALLY, IN DISGUST:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Ah, this is pointless.
text: As he shoves the homework back in the attache case:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: All right, Plan B. You might want
text: to watch out the front window there,
dialog: Larry.
text: He is heading for the door. The Dude, puzzled, rises to
dialog: follow him.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: This is what happens when you FUCK a
text: STRANGER in the ASS, Larry.
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE
text: Walter is striding down the lawn with his attache case like
text: an enraged encyclopedia salesman. Without looking back at,
text: the Dude, who follows:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Fucking language problem, Dude.
text: He pops the Dude's trunk, flings in the briefcase and takes
text: out a tire iron.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Maybe he'll understand this.
text: He is walking over to the Corvette.
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!
text: CRASH! He swings the crowbar into the windshield, which
text: shatters.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS?!
text: CRASH! He takes out the driver's window.
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK A
text: STRANGER IN THE ASS!
text: Lights are going on in houses down the street. Distant dogs
dialog: bark.
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!
speaker_heading: CRASH!
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS! FUCK A STRANGER
dialog: IN THE ASS!
speaker_heading: CRASH!
text: A man in a sleeveless T-shirt and boxer shorts has run over
text: behind Walter and grabbed him from behind on a backswing of
text: the crowbar.
speaker_heading: MAN
text: WHAT THE FUCK JOO DOING, MANG?!
text: He wrestles the crowbar away from the startled Walter.
speaker_heading: MAN
text: I JUS' BAWDEEZ FUCKEEN CAR LASS WEEK!
text: Walter cringes before the enraged Mexican.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Hunh?
text: The man looks about, wildly.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I KILL JOO, MANG! I--I KILL JOR
scene_heading: FUCKEEN CAR!
text: He runs over to the Dude's car.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: No! No! NO! THAT'S NOT--
dialog: CRASH! CRASH!
speaker_heading: MAN
text: I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
speaker_heading: CRASH!
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE CAR
text: Glass rains in on a terrified, cringing, Donny.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
text: ON A DEAFENING CRASH WE CUT TO:
speaker_heading: THE DUDE'S CAR
text: We are looking into the car through the broken windshield as
text: it rattles down the freeway. Wind whistles through the caved-
dialog: in windows.
text: The Dude drives, his jaw clenched, staring grimly out at the
text: road. Walter, beside him, and Donny in the back seat, munch
text: 'on In-and-Out Burgers.
text: Creedence music plays above the bluster of wind.
scene_heading: DUDE'S BUNGALOW
text: As the Dude talks on the phone he is hammering a two-by-four
text: into the floor just inside, and parallel to, the front door.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I accept your apology. . . No I, I
dialog: just want to handle it myself from
dialog: now on. . . No. That has nothing to
dialog: do with it. . . .Yes, it made it
dialog: home, I'm calling from home. No,
dialog: Walter, it didn't look like Larry
dialog: was about to crack.
text: He finishes hammering, rises and grabs a straightbacked chair
text: that stands nearby.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Well that's your perception. . .
dialog: Well you're right, Walter, and the
dialog: unspoken Message is FUCK YOU AND
dialog: LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE. . . Yeah,
dialog: I'll be at practice.
text: He hangs up and has just finished sliding the chair into
text: place with its top under the doorknob and its legs braced
text: against the two-by-four, thus wedging the door closed, when
text: the door is opened--outwards. The chair clatters to the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Huh?
text: Woo and the blond man who earlier peed on the rug stride in,
text: kicking the chair away.
speaker_heading: WOO
dialog: Pin your diapers on, Lebowski. Jackie
dialog: Treehorn wants to see you.
speaker_heading: BLOND MAN
dialog: And we know which Lebowski you are,
dialog: Lebowski.
speaker_heading: WOO
dialog: Yeah. Jackie Treehorn wants to talk
text: to the deadbeat Lebowski.
speaker_heading: BLOND MAN
dialog: You're not dealing with morons here.
speaker_heading: BLACKNESS
text: Out of the blackness something is falling toward us. It is
text: a woman, falling in slow motion, her limbs flailing, her
text: mouth contorted by either fear or ecstasy. She is topless.
text: She falls past the camera, leaving blackness, then after a
text: beat reappears, rising into the night sky.
speaker_heading: MALIBU BEACH
text: A crowd of mostly tanned middle-aged men with blow-dried
text: hair, wearing jogging outfits and other expensively casual
text: attire, are blanket-tossing the squealing young woman in
text: nightmarish slow motion.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: It is a party, lit by festive beach lights and standing
text: kerosene heaters. 1960's mainstream jazz, of the Mancini-
text: Brubeck school, has been piped down to speakers on the beach'.
text: In long shot now the woman rises, squealing, disappears
text: into darkness, descends into light, rises again.
text: A man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach
text: light. He is handsome, fiftyish, wearing cotton twill pants
text: and a Turnbull &amp; Asher shirt with a foulard knotted at the
text: neck. Behind him, the woman rises and falls, appears and
dialog: disappears.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Hello Dude, thanks for coming. I'm
dialog: Jackie Treehorn.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE BEACH HOUSE
text: The Dude is looking around at the '60's modern decor.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: This is quite a pad you got here,
text: man. Completely unspoiled.
speaker_heading: TREEHORN
dialog: What's your drink, Dude?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: White Russian, thanks. How's the
dialog: smut business, Jackie?
speaker_heading: TREEHORN
dialog: I wouldn't know, Dude. I deal in
dialog: publishing, entertainment, political
dialog: advocacy, and--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Which one was Logjammin'?
speaker_heading: TREEHORN
dialog: Regrettably, it's true, standards
dialog: have fallen in adult entertainment.
dialog: It's video, Dude. Now that we're
dialog: competing with the amateurs, we can't
dialog: afford to invest that little extra
dialog: in story, production value, feeling.
text: He taps his forehead with one finger.
speaker_heading: TREEHORN
dialog: People forget that the brain is the
dialog: biggest erogenous zone--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: On you, maybe.
text: He hands him the drink.
speaker_heading: TREEHORN
dialog: Of course, you do get the good with
dialog: the bad. The new technology permits
dialog: us to do exciting things with
dialog: interactive erotic software. Wave
dialog: of the future, Dude. 100% electronic.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Uh-huh. Well, I still jerk off
dialog: manually.
speaker_heading: TREEHORN
dialog: Of course you do. I can see you're
dialog: anxious for me to get to the point.
dialog: Well Dude, here it is. Where's Bunny?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I thought you might know, man.
speaker_heading: TREEHORN
dialog: Me? How would I know? The only
dialog: reason she ran off was to get away
dialog: from her rather sizable debt to me.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: But she hasn't run off, she's been--
text: Treehorn waves this off.
speaker_heading: TREEHORN
dialog: I've heard the kidnapping story, so
dialog: save it. I know you're mixed up in
dialog: all this, Dude, and I don't care
dialog: what you're trying to take off her
dialog: husband. That's your business. All
dialog: I'm saying is, I want mine.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah, well, right man, there are
dialog: many facets to this, uh, you know,
dialog: many interested parties. If I can
dialog: find your money, man-- what's in it
dialog: for the Dude?
speaker_heading: TREEHORN
dialog: Of course, there's that to discuss.
dialog: Refill?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Does the Pope shit in the woods?
speaker_heading: TREEHORN
dialog: Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Okay, Jackie, done. I like the way
dialog: you do business. Your money is being
text: held by a kid named Larry Sellers.
dialog: He lives in North Hollywood, on
text: Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger.
dialog: A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure
dialog: your goons'll be able to get it off
dialog: him, mean he's only fifteen and he's
dialog: flunking social studies. So if you'll
dialog: just write me a check for my ten per
dialog: cent. . . of half a million. . .
dialog: fifty grand.
text: He is getting to his feet, but sways woozily.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I'll go out and mingle.--Jesus, you
dialog: mix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie.
text: The Dude shakes his head, tries to focus.
speaker_heading: TREEHORN
dialog: A fifteen-year-old? Is this your
dialog: idea of a joke?
text: Jackie Treehorn's image starts to swim. He is joined on
text: either side by Woo and the blond man, all three men looking
text: grimly down at the Dude.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: No funny stuff, Jackie. . . the kid's
dialog: got it. Hiya, fellas. . . kid just
dialog: wanted a car. All the Dude ever
dialog: wanted. . . was his rug back. . .
dialog: not greedy. . . it really.
text: He squints at Jackie Treehorn, who swims in and out of focus.
text: Tied the room together.
text: He tips forward, spilling his drink off the table.
text: FROM UNDER THE GLASS COFFEE TABLE
text: Looking up at the Dude as his face hits the glass and
text: squishes.
speaker_heading: FAST FADE OUT
speaker_heading: BLACK
scene_heading: THE STRANGER'S VOICE
dialog: Darkness warshed over the Dude--
text: darker'n a black steer's tookus on a
text: moonless prairie night. There was
dialog: no bottom.
text: We hear a thundering bass.
scene_heading: SCRATCHY WHITE TITLE CARD:
scene_heading: JACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS
scene_heading: ANOTHER TITLE CARD:
speaker_heading: THE DUDE
speaker_heading: AND
speaker_heading: MAUDE LEBOWSKI
speaker_heading: IN
scene_heading: THIRD TITLE CARD:
speaker_heading: GUTTERBALLS
text: The title logo is a suggestively upright bowling pin flanked
text: by a pair of bowling balls. The bending bass sound turns
text: into the lead-in to Kenny Rogers and the First Edition's
dialog: "Just Dropped In."
text: The Dude is walking down a long corridor dressed as a cable
text: repairman. The Dude's face is washed with a brilliant light
text: as the corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley.
text: In the center of the alley stands Maude Lebowski, singing
text: operatic harmony to the Kenny Rogers song. She wears an
text: armored breastplate and Norse headgear, has braided pigtails,
text: and holds a trident.
text: The Dude stands behind her and, pressed up against her, helps
text: her with her follow-through as she releases a bowling ball.
text: The lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini-
text: skirts, their arms akimbo, Busby-Berkley style, their legs
text: turning the lane into a tunnel leading to the pins at the
dialog: end.
text: But it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their
text: legs--it is the Dude himself, levitating inches off the lane,
text: the tools from his utility belt swinging free. He is face
text: down, his arms, torpedolike, pressed against his sides.
text: His point of view shows the lane rushing by below, the little
text: ball-guide arrows zipping by.
text: The Dude twists his body around, performing a barrel-roll so
text: that he is now gliding along the lane face-up.
text: Now his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing
dialog: chorines.
text: The Dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so
text: that he is once again gliding face-down. He looks forward
text: and his forward momentum blows back his hair.
text: Coming at us, as we go through the last few pairs of legs,
text: are the approaching pins. We hit the pins, scattering them,
text: and rush on into black.
text: A body drops down into the blackness in slow motion--a topless
text: woman, squealing, her legs kicking.
text: As she drops out of frame, leaving blackness again, three
text: men are entering from the background, emerging into a pool
text: of light. It is the Germans, advancing ominously, wielding
text: oversized shears which they menacingly scissor.
text: The Dude, now standing in a field of black, reacts to the
text: advancing Germans. He turns and runs, fists pumping.
text: The scissoring sound of the shears turns into the whoosh of
text: car-bys. The field of black is punctured by headlights.
text: The Dude is running blearily down the middle of the Pacific
text: Coast Highway. Cars rush by on either side, horns blaring.
text: With the BLOO-WHUP of a short siren blast, a squad car with
text: flashing gumballs pulls up.
speaker_heading: SQUAD CAR
text: The Dude sits in the back seat, his head lolling with the
text: motion of the car as he blearily sings the theme of Branded:
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: He was innocent. Not a charge was
dialog: true. And they say he ran awaaaaaay.
speaker_heading: CHIEF'S OFFICE
text: The Dude is hurled against the chief's desk, which he bounces
text: off of, to come to rest more or less seated in a facing chair.
text: His wallet is tossed onto the desk.
text: The chief leans forward, takes the wallet and sorts through
text: it with disgusted incredulity.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: This is your only I.D.?
text: He is looking at the Ralph's Shopper's Club card.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I know my rights.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: You don't know shit, Lebowski.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I want a fucking lawyer, man. I
dialog: want Bill Kunstler.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: What are you, some kind of sad-assed
dialog: refugee from the fucking sixties?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to
dialog: eject you from his garden party,
dialog: that you were drunk and abusive.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: That guy treats women like objects,
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
text: Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in
dialog: this town, Lebowski. You don't draw
dialog: shit. We got a nice quiet beach
dialog: community here, and I aim to keep it
dialog: nice and quiet. So let me make
dialog: something plain. I don't like you
dialog: sucking around bothering our citizens,
dialog: Lebowski. I don't like your jerk-
dialog: off name, I don't like your jerk-off
dialog: face, I don't like your jerk- off
dialog: behavior, and I don't like you, jerk-
dialog: off --do I make myself clear?
text: The Dude stares.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
text: The Chief hurls his steaming mug of coffee at the Dude. It
text: hits him in the forehead with a thud, the scalding coffee
text: splashing everywhere.
text: The Chief is already up off his chair, rounding the desk.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: --Ow! Fucking fascist!
text: The Chief slaps him twice.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski!
text: He kicks the chair out from under the Dude, and then starts
text: kicking at him.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat! Keep
dialog: your ugly fucking goldbricking ass
dialog: out of my beach community!
speaker_heading: CAB
text: The Dude, in the back seat of a taxicab that rocks and squeaks
text: with every bump, is gingerly touching at sore spots on his
text: face and scalp.
text: "Peaceful Easy Feeling" is on the radio.
speaker_heading: DUDE'S POV
text: The back of the driver, a large black man with rasta dreds
text: under a knit cap.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Jesus, man, can you change the
dialog: station?
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Fuck you man! You don't like my

speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I've had a--
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: I pull over and kick your ass out,
dialog: man!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: --had a rough night, and I hate the
dialog: fucking Eagles, man--
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: That's it! Outta this fucking cab!
speaker_heading: THE STREET
text: The cab screeches over towards the curb. Another car,
text: oncoming, its radio blaring Metallica, speeds by.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE OTHER CAR
text: It is a red convertible. The driver, singing loudly and
text: badly along with the radio, her hair blowing in the wind, a
text: dreamy smile on her face as she speeds along, higher than a
text: kite, is Bunny Lebowski.
speaker_heading: THE FOOTWELL
text: On the accelerator her right foot, in an open-toed bright
text: red high-heeled shoe, has five painted toes.
text: When she downshifts her left foot enters to engage the clutch.
text: Five more toes.
scene_heading: DUDE'S BUNGALOW
text: The Dude staggers in the open front door, one hand pressed
text: to a lump on his forehead, and looks around.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Jesus.
text: The place is a wreck. Furniture has been overturned,
text: upholstery slashed, drawers dumped.
dialog: Quiet.
text: The door to the bedroom starts to creak open.
text: The Dude cringes.
text: Maude emerges from the bedroom. She is wearing a bathrobe.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Jeffrey.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Maude?
text: She pulls open the bathrobe as she approaches.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Love me.
text: The Dude is stupefied.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: That's my robe.
text: THOOMP! ON THE EMBRACE WE CUT TO:
speaker_heading: BLACK
text: After a beat, a long sigh, and then a voice from the
dialog: blackness:
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Tell me a little about yourself,
dialog: Jeffrey.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
text: A match is dragged across a headboard; the Dude is lighting
text: himself a joint. He shakes the match out to restore blackness
text: except for the glowing tip of the joint.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I was, uh, one of the authors of the
dialog: Port Huron Statement.--The original
dialog: Port Huron Statement.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Not the compromised second draft.
dialog: And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the
dialog: Seattle Seven?
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Mmnun.
text: Click--the Dude turns on a bedside lamp. He and Maude lie
text: next to each other in bed.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: And then. . . let's see, I uh--music
dialog: business briefly.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah. Roadie for Metallica. Speed
dialog: of Sound Tour.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Bunch of assholes. And then, you
dialog: know, little of this, little of that.
dialog: My career's, uh, slowed down a bit
dialog: lately.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: What do you do for fun?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Oh, you know, the usual. Bowl.
dialog: Drive around. The occasional acid
dialog: flashback.
text: He climbs out of bed but Maude remains in it. She wedges a
text: pillow into the small of her back and clasps a hand on each
text: kneecap. She pulls her knees in toward her chest to keep
text: her pelvis raised.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: What happened to your house?
speaker_heading: DUDE
text: Jackie Treehorn trashed the place.
dialog: Wanted to save the finder's fee.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Finder's fee?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: He thought I had your father's money,
dialog: so he got me out of the way while he
dialog: looked for it.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: It's not my father's money, it's the
dialog: Foundation's. Why did he think you
dialog: had it? And who does?
speaker_heading: DUDE
text: Larry Sellers, a high-school kid.
dialog: Real fucking brat.
text: He picks a White Russian off the bedside table.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Jeffrey--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: It's a complicated case, Maude.
dialog: Lotta ins, lotta outs. Fortunately
dialog: I've been adhering to a pretty strict,
dialog: uh, drug regimen to keep my mind,
dialog: you know, limber. I'm real fucking
dialog: close to your father's money, real
dialog: fucking close. It's just--
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: I keep telling you, it's the
dialog: Foundation's money. Father doesn't
dialog: have any.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Huh? He's fucking loaded.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: But your father--he runs stuff, he--
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: We did let Father run one of the
dialog: companies, briefly, but he didn't do
dialog: very well at it.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: But he's--
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: He helps administer the charities
dialog: now, and I give him a reasonable
dialog: allowance. He has no money of his
dialog: own. I know how he likes to present
dialog: himself; Father's weakness is vanity.
dialog: Hence the slut.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Huh. Jeez. Well, so, did he--is
dialog: that yoga?
text: Throughout, Maude has been lying on her back with her knees
dialog: pulled in.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: It increases the chances of
dialog: conception.
text: The Dude spits some White Russian.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Increases?
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Well yes, what did you think this
dialog: was all about? Fun and games?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Well...no, of course not--
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: I want a child.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner.
dialog: In fact I don't want the father to
dialog: be someone I have to see socially,
dialog: or who'll have any interest in rearing
text: the child himself.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Huh...
text: Something occurs to him.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: So...that doctor.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Exactly. What happened to your face?
dialog: Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
text: The Dude is staring off into space, thinking. His answer is
dialog: absent.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu.
dialog: A real reactionary. . . So your
dialog: father. . . Oh man, I get it!
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: What?
text: The Dude is leaving the bedroom.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah, my thinking about the case,
dialog: man, it had become uptight. Yeah.
dialog: Your father--
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: The Dude finishes punching a number into the phone.
speaker_heading: PHONE VOICE
dialog: This is Walter Sobchak. I'm not in;
text: leave a message after the beep.
scene_heading: FROM THE BEDROOM:
speaker_heading: MAUDE'S VOICE
dialog: What're you talking about?
dialog: Beep.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Walter, if you're there, pick up the

dialog: this is an emergency. I'm not--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Dude?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I can't drive, Dude, it's erev
dialog: shabbas.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Erev shabbas. I can't drive. I'm
dialog: not even supposed to pick up the
dialog: phone, unless it's an emergency.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: It is a fucking emergency.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I understand. That's why I picked
dialog: up the phone.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind,
dialog: just call Donny then, and ask him to--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
speaker_heading: DUDE
text: WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA
dialog: GO TO PASADENA! COME PICK ME UP OR
text: I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!
speaker_heading: MAUDE'S VOICE
dialog: Jeffrey?
speaker_heading: THE DUDE
text: He emerges on his front stoop, pulling on a shirt. His
text: attention is caught by something down the street.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: A car is parked halfway down the block. We can see the
text: shape of a fat man in the driver's seat.
speaker_heading: THE DUDE
text: Striding purposefully down the street.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: The fat man leans forward and we hear the sound of the car's
text: ignition coughing, but the engine will not turn over. More
text: whines and coughs; no start.
text: The man hurriedly fumbles in front of him. He brings up a
text: newspaper, which he holds before his face.
speaker_heading: THE DUDE
text: As he gets to the car. He reaches through the open driver's
text: window and grabs the newspaper and hurls it to the ground.
text: He is revved with nervous energy.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Get out of that fucking car, man!
text: The man nervously complies. The Dude flinches at the man's
text: movement as he gets out.
text: The man cringes, reacting to the Dude's flinch.
text: He is wearing a cheap blue serge suit. He is bald with a
text: short fringe and a mustache.
text: The Dude shouts to cover his fear:
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Who the fuck are you, man! Come on,
dialog: man!
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Relax, man! No physical harm
dialog: intended!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Who the fuck are you? Why've you
dialog: been following me? Come on, fuckhead!
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.
text: The Dude is stunned.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Brother Shamus? Like an Irish monk?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Irish m--What the fuck are you talking
dialog: about? My name's Da Fino! I'm a
dialog: private snoop! Like you, man!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: DA FINO
dialog: A dick, man! And let me tell you
dialog: something: I dig your work. Playing
text: one side against the other--in bed
dialog: with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay
dialog: away from my fucking lady friend,
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: DA FINO
dialog: Hey hey, I'm not messing with your
dialog: special lady--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: She's not my special lady, she's my
dialog: fucking lady friend. I'm just helping
dialog: her conceive, man!
speaker_heading: DA FINO
dialog: Hey, man, I'm not--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Who're you working for? Lebowski?
dialog: Jackie Treehorn?
speaker_heading: DA FINO
dialog: The Gundersons.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: The? Who the fff--
speaker_heading: DA FINO
dialog: The Gundersons. It's a wandering
dialog: daughter job. Bunny Lebowski, man.
text: Her real name is Fawn Gunderson.
dialog: Her parents want her back.
text: He is fumbling in his wallet.
speaker_heading: DA FINO
dialog: See?
text: The Dude looks at the picture.
text: It is probably a school portrait, unmistakably Bunny, but
text: fresh-faced, much younger looking, with a corn-fed smile and
text: straight Partridge Family hair and bangs.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Jesus fucking Christ.
speaker_heading: DA FINO
dialog: Crazy, huh? Ran away a year ago.
text: He is holding out another picture.
dialog: The Gundersons told me to show her this when I found her.
dialog: The family farm.
text: A bleak farmhouse and silo are the only features on a flat
text: snow-swept landscape.
dialog: Outside of Moorhead, Minnesota. They think it'll make her
text: homesick.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Boy. How ya gonna keep 'em down on
dialog: the farm once they seen Karl Hungus.
text: He hands back the picture.
dialog: She's been kidnapped, Da Fino. Or maybe not, but she's
text: definitely not around.
speaker_heading: DA FINO
dialog: Fuck, man! That's terrible!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah, it sucks.
speaker_heading: DA FINO
dialog: Well maybe you and me could pool our
dialog: resources--trade information--
dialog: professional courtesy--compeers, you
dialog: know--
text: We hear distant yapping, growing louder with the hum of an
text: approaching car.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah, I get it. Fuck off, Da Fino.
dialog: And stay away from my special la--
dialog: from my fucking lady friend.
text: The Dude steps out to meet Walter's car as it pulls up, its
text: passenger window open and the pomeranian leaning out and
text: yapping.
speaker_heading: DENNY'S
text: Four people sit at a booth: Dieter, Kieffer, Franz, all in
text: black leather, and a young woman with long stringy blonde
text: hair, wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed sleeveless
text: tee-shirt, worn thin with age. She is apparently braless,
text: and is teutonically pale with birthmarks on her face and
dialog: arms.
text: Notable is her camera-side leg, which ends in a bandage-
text: swaddled foot. Dried rust-colored blood stains the tip of
text: the bandage. The four are arguing, loudly, in German.
text: They seem very unhappy. A waitress enters with a checkpad
dialog: and pen.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: You folks ready?
text: The German shouting stops. Dieter looks sourly up.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: I haff lingenberry pancakes.
speaker_heading: KIEFFER
text: Lingenberry pancakes.
speaker_heading: FRANZ
text: Sree picks in blanket.
text: The woman speaks to Dieter in German. He nods.
speaker_heading: DIETER
text: Lingenberry pancakes.
speaker_heading: WALTER'S CAR
text: Walter's eyes are on the road as he listens, driving, to the
text: Dude, whose speech is occasionally punctuated by yaps from
text: the back seat.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I mean we totally fucked it up, man.
dialog: We fucked up his pay-off. And got
text: the kidnappers all pissed off, and
dialog: the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot,
dialog: but he didn't do anything. Huh?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Well it's, sometimes the cathartic,
dialog: uh.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck-
dialog: up, then why does he still leave me
dialog: in charge of getting back his wife?
dialog: Because he fucking doesn't want her
dialog: back, man! He's had enough! He no
dialog: longer digs her! It's all a show!
dialog: But then, why didn't he give a shit
dialog: about his million bucks? I mean, he
dialog: knew we didn't hand off his briefcase,
dialog: but he never asked for it back.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What's your point, Dude?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: His million bucks was never in it,
dialog: man! There was no money in that
dialog: briefcase! He was hoping they'd
dialog: kill her! You throw out a ringer
dialog: for a ringer!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Shit yeah!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Okay, but how does all this add up
dialog: to an emergency?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm saying, I see what you're getting
dialog: at, Dude, he kept the money, but my
dialog: point is, here we are, it's shabbas,
dialog: the sabbath, which I'm allowed to
dialog: break only if it's a matter of life
dialog: and death--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Walter, come off it. You're not
dialog: even fucking Jewish, you're--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What the fuck are you talking about?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: You're fucking Polish Catholic--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What the fuck are you talking about?
dialog: I converted when I married Cynthia!
dialog: Come on, Dude!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah, and you were--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You know this!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: And you were divorced five fucking
dialog: years ago.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah? What do you think happens
dialog: when you get divorced? You turn in
dialog: your library card? Get a new driver's
dialog: license? Stop being Jewish?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: This driveway.
speaker_heading: AS HE TURNS:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: It's just part of your whole sick
dialog: Cynthia thing. Taking care of her
dialog: fucking dog. Going to her fucking
dialog: synagogue. You're living in the
dialog: fucking past.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Three thousand years of beautiful
dialog: tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax--
text: YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE
dialog: PAST! I--Jesus. What the hell
dialog: happened?
text: He is looking off as the car slows. The Dude looks where
text: Walter is looking.
scene_heading: THE LEBOWSKI MANSION
text: Walter's car pulls up the drive into the foreground and he
text: and the Dude get out.
text: Both are gaping off at the front lawn.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Jesus Christ.
speaker_heading: THEIR POV
text: Tire treads lead across the manicured front lawn to where a
text: little red sports car rests with its hood crumpled into a
text: palm trunk.
text: TRACKING DOWN THE GREAT HALLWAY
text: Through the French doors at its far end we can see Bunny,
text: naked, briefly bouncing on the diving board before splashing
text: into the illuminated pool outside. Heavy metal music filters
text: in from a boom box by the pool.
text: Brandt, approaching, stoops and straightens, stoops and
text: straightens, picking up the discarded clothes that run the
text: length of the hall.
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: He can't see you, Dude.
text: We pull the Dude and Walter as they approach the doors to
text: the great study. Walter's dog follows, stiffly waving its
dialog: tail.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Where'd she been?
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: Visiting friends of hers in Palm
text: Springs. Just picked up and left,
dialog: never bothered to tell us.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: But I guess she told Dieter.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Jesus, Dude! He never even kidnapped
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: Who's this gentleman, Dude?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Who'm I? I'm a fucking VETERAN!
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: You shouldn't go in there, Dude!
dialog: He's very angry!
text: BANG--the Dude and Walter push through the double doors into--
speaker_heading: THE GREAT ROOM
text: The big Lebowski turns at the sound of the door. His
text: wheelchair hums as he spins it around.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: Well, she's back. No thanks to you.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Where's the money, Lebowski?
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: A MILLION BUCKS FROM FUCKING NEEDY
text: LITTLE URBAN ACHIEVERS! YOU ARE
speaker_heading: SCUM, MAN!
text: The dog yaps.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Who the hell is he?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'll tell you who I am! I'm the guy
dialog: who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY
text: GOLDBRICKING ASS!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: We know the briefcase was empty,
dialog: man. We know you kept the million
dialog: bucks yourself.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Well, you have your story, I have
dialog: mine. I say I entrusted the money
dialog: to you, and you stole it.
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING
dialog: YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped
dialog: and you could use it as a pretext to
dialog: make some money disappear. All you
dialog: needed was a sap to pin it on, and
dialog: you'd just met me. You thought,
dialog: hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone
dialog: the square community won't give a
dialog: shit about.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Well? Aren't you?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Well. . . yeah.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: All right, get out. Both of you.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Look at that fucking phony, Dude!
dialog: Pretending to be a fucking
dialog: millionaire!
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: I said out. Now.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Let me tell you something else.
dialog: I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude,
dialog: and this guy is a fake. A fucking
dialog: goldbricker.
text: He is crossing to Lebowski.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: This guy fucking walks. I've never
dialog: been more certain of anything in my
dialog: life!
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Stay away from me, mister!
text: Walter reaches around from behind and hoists the big Lebowski
text: out of the wheelchair by his armpits.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Walk, you fucking phony!
text: The big Lebowski waggles helplessly, his rubbery feet grazing
text: the floor like a Raggedy Ann's. The pomeranian gaily leaps
text: and yaps.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Put me down, you son of a bitch!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Walter!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: It's all over, man! We call your
dialog: fucking bluff!
speaker_heading: DUDE
scene_heading: WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE! HE'S
text: CRIPPLED! PUT HIM DOWN!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Sure, I'll put him down, Dude. RAUSS!
dialog: ACHTUNG, BABY!!
text: He shoves the big Lebowski forward and he crumples to the
text: floor, weeping.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Oh, shit.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: (sobbing)
dialog: You're bullies! Cowards, both of
dialog: you!
text: Walter is abashed. The Big Lebowski flails about on the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Oh, shit.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: He can't walk, Walter!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah, I can see that, Dude.
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: You monsters!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Help me put him back in his chair.
text: Walter moves to comply.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Shit, sorry man.
scene_heading: THROUGH HIS TEARS:
speaker_heading: LEBOWSKI
dialog: Stay away from me! You bullies!
dialog: You and these women! You won't leave
dialog: a man his fucking balls!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Walter, you fuck!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Shit, Dude, I didn't know. I
dialog: wouldn't've done it if I knew he was
dialog: a fucking crybaby.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: We're sorry, man. We're really sorry.
text: The Dude has picked up the Big Lebowski's plaid lap warmer
text: and is frantically tucking it back in around his waist and
text: batting the dog away.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: There ya go. Sorry man.
text: Walter, puzzled, hands on hips, stands over the big Lebowski.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Shit. He didn't look like a spinal.
speaker_heading: TEN PINS
text: Scattered at the cut.
scene_heading: DUDE AND WALTER
text: Each with a beer at the scoring table.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Sure you'll see some tank battles.
dialog: But fighting in desert is very
dialog: different from fighting in canopy
dialog: jungle.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war
dialog: whereas, uh, this thing should be a
dialog: fucking cakewalk. I mean I had an
dialog: M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking
dialog: tank. Just me and Charlie, man,
text: eyeball to eyeball.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: That's fuckin' combat. The man in
dialog: the black pyjamas, Dude. Worthy
dialog: fuckin' adversary.
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Shut the fuck up, Donny. Not a bunch
text: of fig-eaters with towels on their
dialog: heads tryin' to find reverse on a
dialog: Soviet tank. This is not a worthy--
speaker_heading: VOICE
speaker_heading: HEY!
text: The Dude and Walter look.
text: Quintana is bellowing from the lip of the lane, and is
text: restrained by O'Brien.
speaker_heading: QUINTANA
dialog: What's this "day of rest" shit, man?!
text: Walter looks at him innocently.
speaker_heading: QUINTANA
dialog: What is this bullshit, man? I don't
dialog: fucking care! It don't matter to
dialog: Jesus! But you're not fooling me!
dialog: You might fool the fucks in the league
dialog: office, but you don't fool Jesus!
dialog: It's bush league psych-out stuff!
dialog: Laughable, man! I would've fucked
dialog: you in the ass Saturday, I'll fuck
dialog: you in the ass next Wednesday instead!
speaker_heading: QUINTANA
text: He makes hip-grinding coital motions as O'Brien leads him
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: QUINTANA
dialog: You got a date Wednesday, man!
text: Walter, his head cocked, and the Dude, peeking over his
text: shades, watch him go.
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: He's cracking.
scene_heading: BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT
text: Donny, Walter and the Dude emerge from the alley, each holding
text: his leatherette ball satchel.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: A tree of life, Dude. To all who
dialog: cling to it.
text: They react to the droning synthesizer-based technopop coming
text: from a boom box.
speaker_heading: REVERSE
text: Dieter, Kieffer and Franz, in shiny black leather, stand in
text: a line facing them in the all-but-deserted lot. Behind them
text: orange flames lick gently at the Dude's car, which has been
text: put to the torch. The orange flames glow on the men's
text: creaking leather. Next to the car are three motorcycles,
text: parked in a neat row. The Dude looks sadly at the burning
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: They finally did it. They killed my
dialog: fucking car.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: Vee vant zat money, Lebowski.
speaker_heading: KIEFFER
dialog: Ja, uzzervize vee kill ze girl.
speaker_heading: FRANZ
dialog: Ja, it seems you forgot our little
dialog: deal, Lebowski.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: You don't have the fucking girl,
dialog: dipshits. We know you never did.
dialog: So you've got nothin' on my Johnson.
speaker_heading: DUDE
text: The men in black, stunned, confer amongst themselves in
text: German. Under his breath:
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: Are these the Nazis, Walter?
text: Walter answers, also sotto voce, his eyes still on the three
dialog: men:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: They're nihilists, Donny, nothing to
dialog: be afraid of.
text: The Germans stop conferring.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: Vee don't care. Vee still vant zat
dialog: money or vee fuck you up.
speaker_heading: KIEFFER
dialog: Ja, vee still vant ze money. Vee
dialog: sreaten you.
text: He pulls an uzi from under his coat. It glints in the
text: firelight.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Fuck you. Fuck the three of you.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Hey, cool it Walter.
text: Walter ignores the Dude, addresses the Germans:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: There's no ransom if you don't have
dialog: a fucking hostage. That's what ransom
dialog: is. Those are the fucking rules.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
speaker_heading: WALTER
scene_heading: NO RULES! YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS-
scene_heading: OF- BITCHES--
speaker_heading: KIEFFER

dialog: dollars! Iss not fair!
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: Fair! WHO'S THE FUCKING NIHILIST
dialog: HERE! WHAT ARE YOU, A BUNCH OF

speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Hey, cool it Walter. Listen, pal,
dialog: there never was any money. The big
dialog: Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase,
dialog: man, so take it up with him.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
text: The Germans confer again, in German.
text: Donny is visibly frightened.
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
scene_heading: WALTER 'S TONE IS GENTLE:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: They won't hurt us, Donny. These
dialog: men are cowards.
scene_heading: THE CONFERENCE ENDS:
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: Okay. Vee take ze money you haf on
dialog: you und vee call it eefen.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Fuck you.
text: The Dude is digging into his pocket.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Come on, Walter, we're ending this
dialog: thing cheap.
text: Walter's eyes, burning with hatred, are locked on Dieter's.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What's mine is mine.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Come on, Walter!.
text: Louder, to the Germans, as he looks in his wallet:
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Four dollars here!
text: He inspects the change in his palm.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Almost five!
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: (tremulously)
dialog: I got eighteen dollars, Dude.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (grimly)
dialog: What's mine is mine.
text: With a ring of steel, Dieter produces a glinting saber.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN! VEE TAKE YOUR
speaker_heading: MONEY!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (coolly)
dialog: Come and get it.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Come and get it. Fucking nihilist.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: I FUCK YOU! I FUCK YOU!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Show me what you got. Nihilist.
text: Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.
text: In a rage, Dieter charges.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: I FUCK YOU! I FUCK YOU!
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: hurls his leather satchel.
speaker_heading: KIEFFER
text: Watching Dieter's charge, is caught off-guard. The bowling
text: ball thuds into his chest and lifts him off his feet.
text: He falls back, his uzi clattering away.
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: twists away as Dieter reaches him; grabs Dieter's head in
text: both hands; draws Dieter's head up to his mouth, which closes
text: on Dieter's ear.
speaker_heading: DUDE
text: He rushes Franz but draws up short as Franz sends out karate
text: kicks, his leather pants squeaking and popping. Franz gives
text: a loud cry with each kick; the Dude leans back, throwing his
text: arms up, evading the kicks.
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: His jaw is still clamped on Dieter's ear. Dieter draws his
text: saber against Walter's side, drawing blood.
text: Walter doesn't react to the wound. Growling as Dieter
text: screams, he worries his ear, waggling his head with his jaws
dialog: clamped.
speaker_heading: THE SABER
text: Dieter drops it.
speaker_heading: DUDE
text: Awkwardly circling, evading Franz's kicks.
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: still worrying the ear. With a tearing sound his head and
dialog: Dieter's separate.
scene_heading: DIETER, EARLESS, SCREAMS:
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: I FUCK YOU! YOU CANNOT HURT ME! I
text: BELIEF IN NUSSING!
text: Walter spits his ear into his face.
speaker_heading: DUDE
text: The Dude and Franz, both now panting heavily, have yet to
text: establish body contact. Franz continues to kick.
speaker_heading: FRANZ
text: VEAKLING!
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: draws back his fist.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: NUSSING!
speaker_heading: WALTER
scene_heading: ANTI-SEMITE!
text: Bam!--A powerhouse blow to the middle of his face drops Dieter
dialog: for the count.
speaker_heading: DUDE AND FRANZ
text: With a piercing shriek Franz finally summons the nerve to
text: charge the Dude, hands raised to deliver karate blows.
text: As he reaches the Dude--WHHAP--the boom box swings into
text: frame to smash him in the face. Its volume shoots up.
text: Walter bashes him a few more times over the head. The music
text: screeches to static, then quiet. Laid out now, Franz too is
dialog: quiet.
text: All quiet.
text: Walter, panting, looks around.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: We've got a man down, Dude.
text: With a hand pressed to his bleeding side he trots over to
text: Donny, who lies gasping on the ground.
text: The Dude, also panting, rises and trots over.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Hy God! They shot him, Walter!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: No Dude.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: They shot Donny!
text: Donny gasps for air. His eyes, wide, go from the Dude to
text: Walter. One hand still clutches his eighteen dollars.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: There weren't any shots.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Then what's...
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: It's a heart attack.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Wha.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Call the medics, Dude.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Wha. . . Donny--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Hurry Dude. I'd go but I'm pumping
text: blood. Might pass out.
text: The Dude runs into the lanes. Walter lays a reassuring hand
text: on Donny's shoulder.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Rest easy, good buddy, you're doing
dialog: fine. We got help choppering in.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
scene_heading: HOLD IN BLACK
scene_heading: THE DUDE AND WALTER
dialog: ---
text: They sit side by side, forearms on knees, in a nondescript
text: waiting area. Walter bounces the fingertips of one hand off
text: those of the other. They sit. They wait.
text: A tall thin man in a conservative black suit enters. He
text: eyes the Dude's bowling attire and sunglasses and Walter's
text: army surplus, but doesn't make an issue of it.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Hello, gentlemen. You are the
dialog: bereaved?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah man.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Francis Donnelly. Pleased to meet
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Jeffrey Lebowski.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Walter Sobchak.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: The Dude, actually. Is what, uh.
speaker_heading: DONNELLY
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: DONNELLY
dialog: Yes. I understand you're taking
text: away the remains.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DONNELLY
dialog: We have the urn.
text: He nods through a door. Another man in a black suit enters
text: to carefully deposit a large silver urn on the desktop.
speaker_heading: DONNELLY
dialog: And I assume this is credit card?
text: He is vaguely handing a large leather folder across the desk
dialog: to whomever wants to take it.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah.
text: He takes it, opens it, puts on reading glasses that sit
text: halfway down his nose, and inspects the bill with his head
text: pulled back for focus and cocked for concentration. Silence.
text: The Dude smiles at Donnelly. Donnelly gives back a
text: mortician's smile. At length Walter holds the bill towards
text: Donnelly, pointing.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: DONNELLY
dialog: That is for the urn.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Don't need it. We're scattering the
dialog: ashes.
speaker_heading: DONNELLY
dialog: Yes, so we were informed. However,
dialog: we must of course transmit the remains
dialog: to you in a receptacle.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
speaker_heading: DONNELLY
dialog: Yes sir. It is our most modestly
dialog: priced receptacle.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Well can we--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: A hundred and eighty dollars?!
speaker_heading: DONNELLY
text: They range up to three thousand.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah, but we're--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Can we just rent it from you?
speaker_heading: DONNELLY
dialog: Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: We're scattering the fucking ashes!
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Walter--
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T
dialog: MEAN WE'RE SAPS!
speaker_heading: DONNELLY
dialog: Sir, please lower your voice--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Hey man, don't you have something
dialog: else you could put it in?
speaker_heading: DONNELLY
dialog: That is our most modestly priced
text: receptacle.
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: GODDAMNIT! IS THERE A RALPH'S AROUND
dialog: HERE?!
scene_heading: POINT DUME -- DAY
text: It is a high, wind-swept bluff. Walter and the Dude walk
text: towards the lip of the bluff. Parked in the background is
text: one lonely car, Walter's.
text: Walter is carrying a bright red coffee can with a blue plastic
text: lid. When they reach the edge the two men stand awkwardly
text: for a beat. Finally:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'll say a few words.
text: The Dude clasps his hands in front of him. Walter clears
text: his throat.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Donny was a good bowler, and a good
dialog: man. He was. . . He was one of us.
dialog: He was a man who loved the outdoors,
dialog: and bowling, and as a surfer explored
dialog: the beaches of southern California
dialog: from Redondo to Calabassos. And he
dialog: was an avid bowler. And a good
dialog: friend. He died--he died as so many
dialog: of his generation, before his time.
dialog: In your wisdom you took him, Lord.
dialog: As you took so many bright flowering
dialog: young men, at Khe San and Lan Doc
dialog: and Hill 364. These young men gave
dialog: their lives. And Donny too. Donny
dialog: who. . . who loved bowling.
text: Walter clears his throat.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: And so, Theodore--Donald--Karabotsos,
dialog: in accordance with what we think
dialog: your dying wishes might well have
dialog: been, we commit your mortal remains
text: to the bosom of.
text: Walter is peeling the plastic lid off the coffee can.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: the Pacific Ocean, which you loved
dialog: so well.
text: AS HE SHAKES OUT THE ASHES:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Goodnight, sweet prince.
text: The wind has blown all of the ashes into the Dude, standing
text: just to the side of and behind Walter. The Dude stands,
text: frozen. Finished eulogizing, Walter looks back.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Shit, I'm sorry Dude.
text: He starts brushing off the Dude with his hands.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Goddamn wind.
text: Heretofore motionless, the Dude finally explodes, slapping
text: Walter's hands away.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Goddamnit Walter! You fucking
dialog: asshole!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Dude! Dude, I'm sorry!
text: The Dude is near tears.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: You make everything a fucking
dialog: travesty!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
text: The Dude gives Walter a furious shove.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: What about that shit about Vietnam!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Dude, I'm sorry--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: What the fuck does Vietnam have to
dialog: do with anything! What the fuck
dialog: were you talking about?!
text: Walter for the first time is genuinely distressed, almost
dialog: lost.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: You're a fuck, Walter!
text: He gives Walter a weaker shove. Walter seems dazed, then
text: wraps his arms around the Dude.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Awww, fuck it Dude. Let's go bowling.
text: THE LANES THE DUDE AND WALTER BOWLING
text: We watch each of them glide across the floor, release, follow
dialog: through--gracefully. We have never seen them bowl before.
text: They are quite good. Each wears a black armband on his
dialog: bowling shirt.
speaker_heading: BAR AREA
text: The Dude walks up to the bar.
speaker_heading: DUDE
text: Two oat sodas, Gary.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Right. Good luck tomorrow.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Thanks, man.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Sorry to hear about Donny.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah. Well, you know, sometimes you
dialog: eat the bear, and, uh.
text: "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" has come up on the jukebox, and The
text: Stranger ambles up to the bar.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: Howdy do, Dude.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Oh, hey man, how are ya? I wondered
dialog: if I'd see you again.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: Wouldn't miss the semis. How things
dialog: been goin'?
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Ahh, you know. Strikes and gutters,
text: ups and downs.
text: The Stranger's eyes crinkle merrily.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: Sure, I gotcha.
text: The bartender has put two gleaming beers on the counter.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I
dialog: gotta get back.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: Sure. Take it easy, Dude--I know
dialog: that you will.
scene_heading: THE DUDE, LEAVING, NODS:
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Yeah man. Well, you know, the Dude
dialog: abides.
text: Gazing after him, The Stranger drawls, savoring the words:
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: The Dude abides.
text: He gives his head a shake of appreciation, then looks into
dialog: the camera.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: I don't know about you, but I take
dialog: comfort in that. It's good knowin'
dialog: he's out there, the Dude, takin' her
dialog: easy for all us sinners. Shoosh. I
dialog: sure hope he makes The finals. Welp,
dialog: that about does her, wraps her all
dialog: up. Things seem to've worked out
dialog: pretty good for the Dude'n Walter,
dialog: and it was a purt good story, dontcha
dialog: think? Made me laugh to beat the
dialog: band. Parts, anyway. Course--I
dialog: didn't like seein' Donny go. But
dialog: then, happen to know that there's a
dialog: little Lebowski on the way. I guess
dialog: that's the way the whole durned human
dialog: comedy keeps perpetuatin' it-self,
dialog: down through the generations, westward
text: the wagons, across the sands a time
dialog: until-- aw, look at me, I'm ramblin'
dialog: again. Wal, uh hope you folks enjoyed
dialog: yourselves.
text: He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip as we begin to pull
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: Catch ya further on down the trail.
text: As we pull away The Stranger swivels in to the bar. As his
text: voice fades:
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: ...Say friend, ya got any more a
dialog: that good sarsaparilla?...
dialog:
