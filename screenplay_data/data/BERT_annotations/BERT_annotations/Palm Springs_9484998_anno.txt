scene_heading: EXT. CALIFORNIA DESERT - DAY
text: We’re LOW TO THE GROUND, floating through a patch of Desert
text: Marigolds swaying with the breeze, a stark contrast to their
text: desolate, eerily silent surroundings. Until --
text: A TORTOISE trudges into frame, an imposing prehistoric beast
text: from this angle. Three healed SCARS mar its shell -- remnants
text: of a lifelong shitstorm. And it’s about to get worse.
text: A MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE HITS, the tortoise halts. A CRACK
text: splinters in the earth’s crust -- ORANGE LIGHT bursts up --
text: Mother Nature takes the tortoise, burying it alive. Or dead.
dialog: Who knows? Who cares?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A PERFECTLY CLEAR NIGHT SKY. Full moon, every constellation.
text: As we PAN ACROSS, the muffled sound of Gram Parsons’ “Return
text: of the Grievous Angel” crescendos until we land on its source:
text: A ROADSIDE BIKER BAR. A true desert dive lost in time.
scene_heading: INT. ROADSIDE BIKER BAR - NIGHT
text: PUSH IN on NYLES, 35 -- his head down on the bar, dressed in
text: swim trunks and a Hawaiian shirt, a full glass of whiskey to
dialog: the side. How he ended up here is anyone’s guess, but what's
text: clear is a faded self-regard and fatalistic outlook. A few
text: BARFLIES throw darts and eat chili behind him.
text: DARLA, 60s, a crusty regular, rubs his leg. Nyles shoots up.
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: You okay, sweetheart?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I've felt everything I'll ever feel
dialog: so I'll never feel ever again.
text: Darla looks to TED THE BARTENDER --
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: What’re you pouring this kid, Ted?
scene_heading: TED THE BARTENDER
dialog: That’s his first drink.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I thought I knew how to live. But I
dialog: didn’t. Or, I don’t? You know what
dialog: I mean.
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: Darlin’, take a look around: whatever
dialog: you're after, it ain’t here...
text: Nyles stares back at Darla -- for an uncomfortably long time.
text: Darla cocks her head. What the fuck is this guy on?
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: (to Ted the Bartender)
dialog: You sure he didn’t take something?
scene_heading: TED THE BARTENDER
text: He’s sober. Kid’s just moping there.
text: Nyles glares at Ted, defiantly shoots back his whiskey, and
text: shatters his glass on the floor.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I’m a fucking adult, Thaddeus.
scene_heading: TED THE BARTENDER
dialog: Talk to me like that and you'll be
dialog: pulling your teeth from the bar.
text: Nyles sizes up the barflies leering at him. He turns to Ted
text: and holds a peace sign... and rotates it into a middle finger.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROADSIDE BIKER BAR - NIGHT
text: We HEAR the sound of a FIGHT: SHOUTING, GLASS BREAKING --
text: The front door flies open and two GIANT BIKERS hurl Nyles
text: face first onto the gravel parking lot, then go back inside.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT DIRT ROAD - NIGHT
text: Nyles trudges up a moonlit road. He takes a Tecate from his
text: pocket and drinks as he reaches the top of a hill, where
text: another source of LIGHT illuminates his face. He gazes out
text: with a look of recognition -- and resignation:
text: A LARGE ESTATE at the end of the road, 100 yards down, in
text: this otherwise pitch black desert valley. The MAIN HOUSE in
text: the center, with two large GUEST HOUSES, all connected
text: through strands of twinkling lights extending down a long
text: dirt driveway, packed full of hybrid cars.
text: Nyles continues toward the estate, passing a SIGN: “Tala &
text: Abe's Wedding - November 9,” stenciled on driftwood in white
text: Futura font. Nyles SLAPS it down as he passes.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Nooooooovember ninth.
text: PRE-LAP the sound of LAUGHTER FROM A CROWD --
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - BACKYARD - NIGHT
text: A Pinterest board come to life: Under an intricately designed
text: web of lights fixed to palm trees, FIFTY WEDDING GUESTS of all
text: ages and dressed in all sorts of hip, eclectic attire sit at
text: tables assembled around a DANCE FLOOR, where MISTY (28, a
text: bridesmaid with face gems) is giving a drawn-out speech --
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: +. hashtag LifeGoals. So, this was
dialog: supposed to be three minutes and I’m
dialog: going on like ten. Sorry, not sorry.
text: TALA (28, bride, flower crown) WOOOs to Misty, then cuddles up
text: with her groom, ABE (28, dapper ‘stache), high on marriage.
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: To wrap things up... Tala, girl,
dialog: you're the sister I always wanted.
speaker_heading: TALA
dialog: Love you, babe!
text: AT THE BAR: SARAH HARRIS (32, cool tattoos, an emotional
text: fortress, Tala’s real sister), scoffs at this as she waits
dialog: for her wine to be filled.
text: Luckily she’s far enough away so no one heard her besides
text: DAISY THE BARTENDER (30, droll) who fills her wine halfway.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Throw me a bone, this isn’t the day
dialog: for moderation.
text: After a brief staredown, Daisy fills the rest, letting it
text: spill over the edges. Sarah smiles, tips $10, GLUGS half the
text: glass, and heads back to the tables.
text: Everyone clinks their drinks for Tala and Abe to kiss --
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: That’s my cue --
text: Abe, always the charmer, pulls Tala in for a long kiss while
text: guests cheer. As he releases her, Sarah returns to her seat
text: across from them, watching with quiet judgement.
text: Tala smiles at her sister, Sarah feigns one back.
text: Misty turns the page of her notes --
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: Oh, wait, there’s still another
dialog: page. I’1l make this quick.
text: The laughter is dying out. This is really dragging on.
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: I decided to Google the two most
dialog: important things about marriage.
dialog: Love and Commitment.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Jesus Christ.
text: Tala shoots Sarah a look: Stop. Sarah nods: Yeah, sorry.
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: Love is “to feel a deep romantic or
dialog: sexual attachment to someone.” We
dialog: know they’re fine in that department.
text: Tala and Sarah’s parents, HOWARD and PIA (50s), wince. Sarah
text: lets out an unconvincing chuckle.
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: And Commitment is “the state or
dialog: quality of being dedicated to a
dialog: cause, activity, etcetera.”
text: Silence. Crickets. Not the triumphant ending she hoped for.
speaker_heading: TALA
dialog: Woo-hoo!
text: Tala and Abe stand and clap. Everyone else joins in applause.
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: Without further ado, let me bring
dialog: up the maid of honor, the actual
dialog: big sister of the bride, Sarah.
text: All eyes land on Sarah -- caught mid wine sip.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Uh...
text: Sarah doesn’t move. Howard leans across the table.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Get on up there, peanut.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No one told me I was supposed to
dialog: give a speech.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Of course you’re supposed to give a
dialog: speech, you’re the maid of honor.
dialog: That's your main job.
speaker_heading: PIA
dialog: She's been drinking, Howard.
text: Sarah looks at her sister and Abe apologetically. Tala
text: struggles to hide her disappointment.
speaker_heading: NYLES (0.S.)
dialog: (Subtitled Italian, Spanish, and French)
dialog: Bonsoir mi familia et amici!
text: Heads swivel to the dance floor. Nyles has commandeered a mic.
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: (away from her mic)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Going in for the assist, babe. I'd
dialog: like to share my thoughts on love.
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: No, you wouldn’t.
scene_heading: ON THE BRIDE/GROOM TABLE:
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Who's this guy?
speaker_heading: TALA
text: Misty’s boyfriend.
text: DANCE FLOOR, Nyles addresses the guests:
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Here’s what you want to hear, what
dialog: I want to say, what you want me to
dialog: say. What all this solipsistic
dialog: horseshit means...
text: Sarah stifles a laugh. Nyles notices.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You're born lost, then you’re
dialog: found... but we’re all just lost,
dialog: am I right?
dialog: 6.
text: Sarah watches intently. Is he talking about me? Other guests
text: trade awkward glances.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: But these two. Tala Anne Harris and
dialog: Abraham Eugene Trent Schlieffen,
dialog: you proudly wave the middle finger
text: in the face of all that negativity.
dialog: Then you give it a thumbs up.
text: Some smiles begin to trickle through the crowd.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Your optimism, your selflessness,
dialog: it’s in your blood. Just look at
dialog: Nana and Papa Schlieffen. After
text: narrowly escaping persecution in
dialog: Nazi Germany, they devoted
dialog: themselves to giving other refugees
dialog: a safe passage to the U.S.
text: NANA and PAPA SCHLIEFFEN (90s) smile at the shout out. Papa
text: pats his Sudanese son, JERRY (20), on the back.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: They found hope, purpose, and
dialog: empowerment through love. And I see
dialog: that same fire burning in you two.
dialog: You’1ll use your love for good. To
dialog: inspire. To change.
text: Tala leans into Abe --
speaker_heading: TALA
dialog: How does he know all that?
text: Abe shakes his head -- he has no clue.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Tala. Lovely, stunning Tala.
text: Tonight’s true beacon of altruism.
dialog: There’s something most people here
dialog: probably don’t know about you, but
dialog: they should, so they can all
dialog: appreciate the wealth of humanity
dialog: on display. I hope it’s okay?
text: Tala has no idea what he’s about to say.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: It’s not just time and money that
dialog: Tala gives to so many charitable
dialog: causes. She donated her physical
dialog: self: bone marrow.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: NYLES (CONT'D)
dialog: While we all gorge that shit, she
dialog: gave hers up to Baby Brother Nico,
dialog: saving his life.
text: Everyone is stunned by this revelation. Tala smiles at her
text: hipster brother, NICO (23), through scattered applause --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You should clap, it’s scary! She
dialog: gave so much. But now it’s time we
dialog: give to you.
text: Nyles locks eyes with Sarah, like he’s addressing her now.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Here you are. On the precipice of
dialog: something much larger than any of
text: us, facing that wide open road. It
text: may seem frightening, filled with
dialog: uncertainty. But remember: you are
dialog: not alone.
text: Tala and Abe look at their guests, hanging on every word.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Everyone here is your family. We
dialog: are your world. We will bolster you
dialog: up when you’re low, and we will
dialog: cheer you on with delight in our
dialog: eyes as you fulfill your every
dialog: dream. So, raise a glass.
text: Nyles takes a Tecate from the pocket of his swim trunks and
text: holds it up, again looking at Sarah:
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: We may be born lost. But you have
dialog: been found.
dialog: (subtitled Arabic: “Welcome home."”)
dialog: Marhabaan bik fi albayt.
text: CHEERS and TEARS ALL AROUND, as we PRE LAP the tropical disco
text: beats of Brian Eno and Karl Hyde’s “Daddy's Car.”
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - BACKYARD - LATER
text: A BACCHANALIAN DANCE PARTY. Guests bounce, groove, grind --
text: energized by the LOVE in the air. Tala Bhangras with her dad,
text: Howard. Nana Schlieffen shimmies with Jerry from Sudan. Abe
text: Soulja Boys with his new mother-in-law, Pia. Brother Nico
text: makes out with ERIN (27, bridesmaid).
dialog: 8.
text: Sarah nurses her wine off to the side, watching Tala and Abe.
text: RANDY (25, bolo tie, top knot), drunkenly dances up to her.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I already told you No earlier. What
dialog: makes you think I changed my mind?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I dunno, you’ve had more to drink?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You can’t say that to me --
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Oh whatever, I don’t have time for
dialog: a lecture.
text: Randy dances away, one hand in the air. Sarah shakes her
text: head, and as she takes another sip of wine -- she locks eyes
text: with Nyles, across the dance floor, smiling back at her.
text: Nyles struts onto the dance floor, navigating the sea of
text: partiers with a cool familiarity. He effortlessly anticipates
text: each passing guest’s dance moves and incorporates them into
dialog: his own unique, complicated, and fucking bizarre routine.
text: He weaves his way over and presents himself in front of
text: Sarah, holding out his hand: Dance with me?
text: She shakes her head. Not a chance.
text: He tucks in his Hawaiian shirt, slicks his hair back, licks
text: his fingers and grooms his eyebrows, then pirouettes.
text: There’s intrigue on her face at least. Her aloof facade may be
text: dropping... But she still declines.
text: Nyles shrugs, then performs a flawless cartwheel back to the
text: center of the floor, narrowly kicking multiple guests yet,
text: somehow, missing each one by inches. He continues letting
text: loose with Sarah’s family -- high-fives to Howard and Abe, a
text: twirl for Pia, an undeniable master of this universe.
text: Off Sarah, increasingly curious about this odd stranger.
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - BACKYARD - LATER
text: As Nyles waits patiently at THE BAR, something hits his
text: senses. He looks around, suddenly alert... He squints --
text: OFF IN THE DISTANCE: behind some shrubs, shrouded in darkness,
text: a silhouette, swaying side to side... Is that a person?
dialog: Nyles SNIFFS the air...
speaker_heading: SARAH (0.S.)
dialog: What are you smelling?
text: Startled, Nyles spins to find Sarah behind him. Covering, he
text: sniffs her hair.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Viktor and Rolf Flowerbomb, right?
text: Sarah cocks her head.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Uh, yeah. That’s weird.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I know my hair mists. Dated a girl
dialog: who bathed in it.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I hate it, but it was a birthday
dialog: present from Tala last year and
dialog: she'd kill me if I didn’t wear it.
text: Daisy the Bartender returns with two COCKTAILS. Nyles offers
dialog: one to Sarah.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I always order two drinks at a
dialog: time. Saves an extra trip.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Or maybe you’re an alcoholic?
text: Nyles shrugs: Yeah, maybe. She takes the drink, they cheers,
text: then meander away from the bar.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You're Misty’s boyfriend, right? I
dialog: don’t think we met at the rehearsal
dialog: last night. I’m Sarah.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Nyles. So what’s the deal, you
dialog: don’t like to dance?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Plantar fasciitis.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Respect.
text: Sarah smiles, just as Nana and Papa Schlieffen interject.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: PAPA SCHLIEFFEN
dialog: Son, I’ve been to more weddings in
dialog: my life than you could imagine --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You'd be surprised.
speaker_heading: PAPA SCHLIEFFEN
dialog: I have to say that your speech was
dialog: the best wedding speech I have ever
dialog: heard. Shukraan.
text: Papa Schlieffen pats Nyles on the shoulder and walks off.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You don’t actually believe any of
dialog: that stuff you spouted, right?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Not a word. We’re all fucking alone.
text: An O0.S. COUGH -- Nyles anxiously glances at the shrubs again,
text: that swaying silhouette still there.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Hey, uh, want to go somewhere we
dialog: can be alone?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Wow. That’s a little forward.
dialog: What’s the rush?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Your mom’s about to sing and I can’t
dialog: handle that right now.
text: Nyles gestures to the DANCE FLOOR, where Pia and her two
text: SISTERS are setting up to sing a song.
text: As Sarah looks over, Nyles glances back to the desert
text: shrubs... then Randy emerges from behind, zipping up his
text: pants. He was just peeing. Nyles exhales with total relief,
text: and turns back to Sarah with a renewed ease about him.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What would Misty think about us
dialog: running off together?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ANGLE THROUGH A WINDOW: Misty leans against the bathroom sink
text: as TREVOR (25, groomed beard, Zara suit) goes down on her.
speaker_heading: SARAH (0.S.)
dialog: Can't say I ever really liked her.
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - SIDE YARD - THAT MOMENT
text: REVEAL: Nyles and Sarah squeeze next to each other, spying on
text: the scene through a small window.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: She has her moments. But yeah. This
dialog: one hurts.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You know she tried to get Tala to
dialog: make her the maid-of-honor because
dialog: I missed the bachelorette party?
dialog: Manipulative bitch.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Who’s the guy?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Ex-boyfriend. Trevor.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Why don’t you go in and stop them?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: There isn’t a world where these two
dialog: don’t end up together.
text: Nyles stops looking, leans against the house, gazes out to
text: the desert. He actually does seem a little affected by this.
text: Sarah slides down beside him. Misty’s MOANS continue.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Well, if it makes you feel any
dialog: better, you gave a great speech and
dialog: everyone out there loves you.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: That’s true.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: On the other hand, they see me as a
dialog: liability who fucks around and
dialog: drinks too much.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Why would they think that?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Because I fuck around and drink too
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Mmm. Don’t we all?
dialog: 12.
text: MISTY SQUEALS -- Nyles gestures behind him: See what I mean?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: And now they just worry and try to
dialog: take care of me, but it’s
text: suffocating.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Yeah, I was never great with
dialog: unsolicited help. Like, don’t tell
dialog: me how to live my life.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Exactly, I can fend for myself.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Of course you can. You don’t need a
dialog: leg up --
text: Another MOAN, followed by --
speaker_heading: MISTY (0.S.)
dialog: -- hold my legs up --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: That was weird.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: This is so fucked up.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Soooo fucked up.
text: They both look back through the window.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Kind of hot though.
text: They share a smile. Locked in. She feels it, he feels it,
text: sparks fly, Misty climaxes, shit’s getting real. Connection.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - ON TOP OF A BOULDER - NIGHT
text: Nyles and Sarah make out on top of a small boulder, not far
text: from the party. Sarah keeps trying to untie Nyles’ board
text: shorts but they’re double knotted.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Okay, I give up. Take off your
dialog: clothes.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You got it.
dialog: 13.
text: Nyles stands up and seductively unbuttons the top button of
text: his shirt, the second... then he RIPS it off.
text: Nyles moves to his board shorts, but they’re tied too tight
text: for him, too. His faux suave-ness on hold as he focuses in --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Almost got ‘em...
text: And... he gets it! He yanks them off, so he’s down to just
text: his boxer-briefs.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You wear underwear under your
dialog: bathing suit?
text: THWACK! AN ARROW FLIES INTO NYLES’ SHOULDER.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: AGGGHH FUCK!!!
text: Some BLOOD sprayed onto Sarah’s face -- SHE SCREAMS!
text: Nyles spots a MAN (50s) in army fatigues and a HUNTING BOW at
text: the base of the boulder.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I thought I smelled you, you piece
dialog: of shit!
text: The Man fires another arrow, GRAZING Nyles’ left love handle.
text: He SCREAMS IN AGONY.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What the fuck is going on?! Who is
dialog: that?!
text: The Man begins to climb up to them. Nyles staggers away from
text: Sarah, slides down the opposite face of the boulder, and runs
text: off into the desert, the Man in pursuit.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT VALLEY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Nyles rounds a corner and pauses to catch his breath. He
text: turns around. Looks like he lost the Man.
text: THWACK! AN ARROW FLIES INTO HIS THIGH. Nyles SCREAMS.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You're a sick fuck, Roy!
text: Nyles sprints with everything he has around a bend. ROY (the
text: man) scurries out of the shadows after him.
dialog: 14.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HILLSIDE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Nyles hobbles around the bend, losing blood, slowing down...
text: and he collapses before a mound of boulders blanketing the
text: side of a hill... almost at his destination:
text: A TRIANGLE-SHAPED CAVE in the hillside, twenty feet ahead.
text: But he can’t make it in time -- Roy’s grunting just around
text: the bend. Quick decision -- Nyles army crawls to the other
text: side of a nearby Joshua Tree, concealed by darkness. He holds
text: his breath, remaining completely silent, just as --
text: Roy rounds the bend -- and stops before the cave. Roy looks
text: around, but he can’t see Nyles. It’s too dark.
text: NYLES’ POV: Roy’s menacing silhouette, fifteen feet away. Roy
text: shouts into the cave.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Keep running, shit bird. I’1l
dialog: always find you.
text: Then, with a disappointed sigh, Roy marches forward -- into
text: the cave. And after a few seconds... Roy vanishes. Weird.
text: Relieved, yet still in excruciating pain, Nyles uses his
text: remaining strength to crawl into the cave, following Roy.
scene_heading: INT. TRIANGLE CAVE - CONTINUOUS
text: Nyles goes deeper, groaning and wincing with each movement.
speaker_heading: SARAH (0.S.)
dialog: (a loud whisper)
dialog: Hey!
text: He turns his head to find Sarah, twenty feet back, standing
text: at the mouth of the cave.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Stop! No no no --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Don’t come in here --
text: A POWERFUL FORCE SUCKS NYLES DEEPER INTO THE CAVE -- FARTHER
scene_heading: AND FARTHER FROM SARAH -- A BURST OF ORANGE LIGHT --
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: MISTY (PRE-LAP)
dialog: Wake up.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. NYLES AND MISTY’S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Nyles wakes up in bed, shirtless, free from any injuries or
text: scars. He rolls over with a yawn to find Misty wrapped in a
text: towel, leg up on the bed as she moisturizes. Her hair and
text: make-up are wedding ready.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: That’s a good leg.
text: She gives him a cheeky smile.
scene_heading: INT. NYLES AND MISTY’S BEDROOM - BATHROOM - MORNING
text: Misty and Nyles have sex. And it’s a struggle. (This is the
dialog: same bathroom we saw Misty and Trevor in.)
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: You close? I can’t start sweating.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Working on it, darling.
text: After a few more thrusts, Misty stops, frustrated.
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: I have to get ready. Just finish on
dialog: your own. Watch me, I don’t care.
text: Misty heads to the bedroom.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Cool, yeah, that’s romantic.
text: Nyles tries masturbating, watching her dig in her suitcase...
text: But he catches his reflection in the mirror -- sweat beading
text: on his chest hair, fat jiggling with each stroke. He grimaces
text: back, full of shame, a weak man trying to feel something...
text: So he strokes harder, faster, FASTER --
scene_heading: INT. NYLES AND MISTY'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Starfished on the bed, Nyles cycles through every channel on
text: TV, never stopping. Misty pulls on her bridesmaid’s dress.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: No offense, but you’re the only guy
dialog: I’ve been with who’s had a problem
dialog: coming. And don’t say the age
dialog: thing. I’ve had older boyfriends.
text: Nyles keeps his eyes locked on the TV.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: It’s not you, it’s me.
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: Yeah, no shit.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I meant it’s you, not me.
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: Funny.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I meant kill me.
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: Look, I know weddings make you
dialog: super uncomfortable, but please
dialog: don’t bring our drama here. This
dialog: day doesn’t belong to us. It’s Tala
dialog: and Abe's.
text: Nyles gives a thumbs up. Misty doesn’t buy his sincerity, but
text: also doesn’t have time to argue. She escapes to the bathroom.
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - FRONT - MORNING
text: Howard carries a driftwood sign down the driveway. At a fork
text: in the road, he hammers it in the dirt with a mallet. REVEAL
dialog: THE SIGN: “Tala & Abe’s Wedding - November 9.”
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - BACKYARD - MORNING
text: IN SLOW MOTION: Nyles does a cannonball into the pool,
text: soaking the pool deck with his splash.
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER
text: Nyles floats on an inflatable pizza raft, beer in hand, a few
text: in his pepperoni cup holders. Jerry (from Sudan) swims by on a
text: KICKBOARD. Nyles offers him a beer from a BOX by the pool.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (accepting the beer)
dialog: Shukraan.
dialog: After a few moments:
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Good day so far?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Today, tomorrow, yesterday, it’s
dialog: all the same. Yourself?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Today is young. Ask me again at the
dialog: end. Anything can happen.
text: Jerry shoots Nyles some flirtatious side-eye.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Not today, sauce pot. Nice try,
dialog: though.
text: Jerry laughs nervously.
speaker_heading: SARAH (0.S.)
dialog: You!
text: Sarah storms up to the side of the pool, almost slipping on
scene_heading: the water. Nyles FREEZES --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (to Nyles)
dialog: What the fuck did you do to me?
text: Jerry looks at Nyles, horrified.
text: Nyles sees Jerry, looks back to Sarah -- panics -- and
text: submerges himself to escape.
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
text: Nyles dodges a bombardment of Tecate cans thrown from above.
text: We’re with him for as long as he can hold his breath, while
text: we hear Sarah’s muffled shouts --
text: SARAH JUMPS IN THE POOL, grabs Nyles’ hair, yanks him up --
text: Nyles surfaces with a GASP, arms FLAILING --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Tell me what the fuck is going on!
dialog: 18.
text: But before Nyles can come up with an answer:
speaker_heading: TALA (0.S.)
dialog: Sarah!
text: Sarah turns: Tala, hair and make-up wedding-ready, is
dialog: crossing the yard --
speaker_heading: TALA
dialog: Oh my god, what are you doing?!
text: Tala reaches the pool deck -- and SLIPS ON WET CONCRETE --
text: her face SMACKS the ground.
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT VALLEY - THE NIGHT BEFORE
text: SARAH'S FACE -- all horror and confusion -- hiding behind a
text: bush as she watches:
text: THWACK! AN ARROW FLIES INTO NYLES’ THIGH. Nyles SCREAMS.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You're a sick fuck, Roy!
text: Nyles sprints with everything he has around a bend. Roy
text: scurries out of the shadows after him.
text: Sarah waits. Listening intently...
text: It’s quiet.
dialog: But she can’t miss whatever the fuck this is so she follows
text: after in a full sprint --
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HILLSIDE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Sarah rounds the corner but no one is there. She hears a
text: SOUND -- a faint groan. Coming from --
text: THE TRIANGLE CAVE. Sarah follows the groans -- until she’s at
text: the mouth of the cave.
text: She can faintly make out Nyles crawling twenty feet in.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (a loud whisper)
dialog: Hey!
text: Nyles turns his head --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Stop! No no no --
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Don’t come in here --
text: -- Nyles vanishes into the cave. No sound, no orange light.
text: All goes silent.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Hello?
dialog: Nothing.
text: But something about the cave draws her in. Some intangible
text: urge she can’t resist, this black hole of both curiosity and
text: escape, and she has to know what’s inside. She steps forward.
scene_heading: INT. TRIANGLE CAVE - CONTINUOUS
text: Sarah’s hands trace the walls for guidance. The moonlight
text: dims as she goes deeper... Until it’s completely PITCH BLACK.
text: Then -- a faint sliver of an orange light appears in the
text: distance, growing brighter the closer she gets. It lights up
text: her face, revealing a mix of wonder and fear --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What the fuuuuuck???
scene_heading: AN ORB OF ORANGE LIGHT SWELLS -- ENGULFS SARAH --
scene_heading: SHE LOSES CONTROL OF HER BODY -- THE ORB COLLAPSES --
scene_heading: -- A BRIGHT BURST OF ORANGE --—
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: SARAH’S CLOSED EYE LIDS
text: The SUN beats down on them. Her eyelids fly open --
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
text: The harsh ray of sunlight slices through a gap in the
text: curtains onto her face. She shoots up, assesses her
text: surroundings, piecing things together...
text: This room is familiar. Shag carpet, black silk sheets,
text: clothes scattered on the floor, someone in the shower. Was
dialog: that all a dream?
dialog: 20.
text: She jumps out of bed, quickly dresses, peers out a WINDOW:
text: Howard and Nico carry sections of the altar, wrapped in
text: plastic; Pia talks to the FLORIST by the main house. They’re
text: setting up for the wedding.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What the fuck?
text: She hears the shower turn off. PANIC. She has to leave --
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - SIDE YARD - MORNING
text: The taupe backside of the estate. Desert shrubs, a noisy AC
text: unit, and, above it, a small window... which OPENS. Sarah
text: wiggles out head first but gets stuck at her waist.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Come on...
text: O.S. VOICES approach. She FREEZES, looking toward two large
text: trash bins by the corner --
text: Howard and Nico appear with giant balls of plastic wrap. They
text: don’t see Sarah teetering out the window as they smash the
text: plastic in the bin. Howard shuts it and they walk off.
text: Once out of sight, Sarah uses all her strength -- STRAINING --
text: and pushes OUT -- taking the entire window frame with her --
text: SLAMS onto the air conditioner, BOUNCES off, and lands on a
text: CACTUS. A silent SCREAM --
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - FRONT - MORNING
text: Sarah hurries to her Kia rental car, parked among the others,
text: and gets in the front seat.
scene_heading: INT. SARAH'S CAR - PARKED - CONTINUOUS
text: Sarah catches her breath, steadying herself. She checks her
text: PHONE: The date and time - 9:40am, November 9.
text: She drops it. What’s happening? She stares into the rearview
text: mirror and SLAPS herself, again and again, sanity cracking --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Wake up. Wake up.
text: BEHIND HER, we see Jerry in his swim trunks, towel over the
text: shoulder, kickboard in hand. He stops to watch, weirded out.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Nothing makes sense.
text: They stare at each other for a moment -- helpless terror on
text: her face, confusion on his. Too much for him to handle, he
text: scurries off to the backyard.
text: She drops her head onto the steering wheel, giving up.
scene_heading: INT. CALMADA ESTATE - FOYER - MORNING
text: ON SARAH as she quietly opens the front door, hoping to go
text: unnoticed... but is hit by the mad rush of people bustling
text: about to set up, the onslaught of wedding decorations, Tala
text: and Abe's engagement POSTER before her. Nausea strikes --
speaker_heading: PIA (0.S.)
dialog: There you are!
text: Pia stands on a ladder tying photos of Tala and Abe to tweed
text: string across the room.
speaker_heading: PIA
dialog: (shouting out)
dialog: Tala! I found Sarah!
text: Pia waddles off the ladder and grabs Sarah --
speaker_heading: PIA
dialog: We were looking for you all
dialog: morning, come on --
dialog: She leads Sarah into the --
scene_heading: KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Where Nana Schlieffen ties ribbon around silverware and Nico
text: blows up balloons. Howard cools off with a wet washcloth on
text: his neck while drinking a glass of water.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Sarah, peanut!
dialog: (gives her a kiss)
dialog: You must’ve gotten up early, I
dialog: checked your room at six --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah... I went on a hike.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: You look exhausted. Stay hydrated.
text: Howard offers her his water.
speaker_heading: PIA
dialog: Tala should be done with her make-
dialog: up soon, so you need to be ready.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I need a minute.
speaker_heading: PIA
dialog: She made a specific order for you
dialog: girls, and we already moved Misty
dialog: up because we couldn’t find you.
text: Sarah's gaze darts around the room, her mind racing.
dialog: Pia looks
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (to Howard)
dialog: This is really happening, right?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I don’t understand the question.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: This day already happened.
text: over at Howard with a concerned look...
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: What are you saying?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It was real. It felt so real.
speaker_heading: PIA
dialog: Are you on drugs again?
text: Sarah stops suddenly, staring out the window to the backyard.
text: IN THE POOL: Jerry... and Nyles.
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - BACKYARD - MORNING
text: Sarah storms up to the side of the pool, almost slipping on
text: the wet pool deck. Nyles freezes at the sight of her.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What the fuck did you do to me?
text: Jerry looks at Nyles, horrified. Nyles panics -- and
text: submerges himself to escape.
dialog: 23.
text: Sarah grabs cans from the box of Tecate, firing into the
text: water at Nyles while she berates him.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Hey! Come back up here!
text: Jerry uses his kickboard to shield himself.
text: SARAH JUMPS IN THE POOL, grabs Nyles’ hair, yanks him up --
text: Nyles surfaces with a GASP, arms FLAILING --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Tell me what the fuck is going on!
text: But before Nyles can come up with an answer:
speaker_heading: TALA (0.S.)
dialog: Sarah!
text: Sarah turns: Tala is crossing the yard --
speaker_heading: TALA
dialog: Oh my god, what are you doing?!
text: Tala reaches the pool deck -- and SLIPS ON WET CONCRETE --
text: her face SMACKS the ground.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDAL SUITE - MORNING
text: Tala WAILS, clasping her bloody mouth. Sarah stands beside
text: her, drenched and shellshocked -- Tala grabs her hand --
text: It’s all out pandemonium; a mess of snot, tears, and streaks
text: of mascara. Pia, Misty, and Erin (bridesmaid) dab Tala’s
text: eyes, Nico looks on with a morbid curiosity, Howard
text: frantically paces around the bedroom on the phone.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Nico! Get me the teeth --
text: Tala WAILS some more. Nico hands Tala’s TEETH to Howard.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (into phone, re: teeth)
text: The three front teeth are broken in
dialog: half, one full canine... I’d guess
dialog: two millimeters? ... Yes, the
dialog: wedding is today... in six hours...
text: Sarah silently observes this nightmare... We go into her POV:
text: BLURRY FACES coming into focus to scream at her:
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: PIA ERIN
dialog: Get ice, Sarah! Help! Help, Sarah! Do something!
text: «+. a nauseating nightmare... swirling pastels...
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: Why were you in the pool?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I can’t be here. This doesn’t make
dialog: any sense. None of this makes any
dialog: fucking sense!
speaker_heading: PIA
dialog: You're making it worse!
text: Sarah flees to the door, flings it open, and STARTLES when
text: she finds Abe listening in --
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: What happened? How is she?
speaker_heading: TALA
dialog: Don’t let him in! He can’t see me!
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: I need to see you, baby!
speaker_heading: TALA
dialog: Don’t fucking come in here!
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (covers phone; to Abe)
dialog: She'll be okay. I found a dentist
dialog: in Cathedral City...
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yes, sorry. We’ll be there soon!
text: Abe leans in close to Sarah, quietly asking:
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: How bad is it?
text: Sarah just stares back, trapped by this bizarre situation.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Everyone! I’m taking Tala into
dialog: town. This dentist glues teeth!
text: Tala WAILS -- it’s all too much -- Sarah VOMITS on the floor.
text: Abe leans back, grossed out --
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: No, Sarah, no!
dialog: 25.
text: Howard grabs a towel, tosses it to Sarah, commands the room --
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Alright! Pia, keep setting up --
speaker_heading: PIA
dialog: I am going with you.
text: Pia cradles Tala in her arms.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Okay. Girls, you’re on table decor.
dialog: Jerry and Nico are here to help.
dialog: Your bride-slash-wedding planner
dialog: needs some emergency surgery so --
text: He looks at Sarah, but she’s useless right now, so --
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Misty, you’re in charge. All hands
dialog: on deck! We can do this!
dialog: off Tala’s WAILING --
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - BACKYARD - DAY
text: Nyles slouches in a lounge chair, but he’s far from relaxed.
text: He stares off, dwelling on the chaotic turn of events.
text: cans litter the pool bottom.
dialog: Beer
text: Sarah wanders out of the house, physically and emotionally
text: drained, and collapses onto one of the chairs.
text: Nyles tries to bury any semblance of guilt... and smiles as
text: he cracks open another Tecate.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: So I guess you followed me.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What’s going on?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I tried stopping you.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Tecate?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: But what is this? When is this?
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: This is today. Today is yesterday.
dialog: Tomorrow is today. And so on. One
dialog: of those infinite loops.
text: Sarah’s mind is melting. Grasping for any help, or hope.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: How do I stop it? I don’t want
dialog: tomorrow to be today. I want
dialog: tomorrow to be tomorrow.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: That's never going to happen.
dialog: Tomorrow will always and forever be
dialog: today.
text: He holds out a beer to her again, but she just sinks back
text: into her chair, approaching, if not already at, complete
text: hopelessness. Nyles feels... bad? A little.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: At least Tala’s teeth will be back
dialog: tomorrow. So she’ll still have her
dialog: dream wedding. That’s good, right?
text: Ignoring this, Sarah looks to the canyon beyond the property.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Which way is that cave?
text: Nyles sighs and points. Sarah walks off, determined.
text: Nyles sips his beer and attempts to continue his sky gazing,
text: but he’s clearly bothered. His routine’s been fucked with.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Fuuuuuck.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT CANYON - DAY
text: Sarah mutters to herself, scanning the boulders, searching
text: for the cave. From the edge of the canyon, we get a clear
text: picture of how big it is, and how small Sarah is within it.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: LATER...
text: The afternoon sun blazes on. Sarah is completely lost, just
text: miles of boulders and hills that all look the same. She
text: passes an empty tortoise shell with three distinct cracks.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 27.
text: LATER...
text: Sarah, out of steam and hope, sits on a small boulder,
dialog: waiting for something, anything. But there’s only that eerie
text: silence, that desert wind. She lies on her back. Giving up.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: LATER...
text: The sun begins to set. Sarah hasn’t moved, made evident by a
text: festering sunburn. She stares dead-eyed at the sky. Then --
text: Nyles steps up, drinking a beer. He offers her a sip and she
text: quickly takes it. Any liquid helps.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Please. Where is it?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You have to wait.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Fuck you. Just tell me.
text: Nyles gives up... and points to the other side of the canyon.
text: Almost directly across from them. But there’s no cave.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Where?
text: Nyles looks toward the horizon... watching... He takes a few
text: steps back, to the left, like he’s looking for his mark...
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Wait for it... Almost... Okay.
dialog: (dead serious)
dialog: I am the Antichrist.
text: Nyles SNAPS his fingers -- and an EARTHQUAKE BEGINS.
text: Sarah freezes, bracing herself --
text: Nyles casually drinks his beer as ROCKS TUMBLE out of place,
text: careening across the canyon, landing all AROUND him.
text: The earthquake stops. Nyles, satisfied with himself, looks
dialog: back at Sarah -- what the fuck was that?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I'm kidding, there is no god, the
dialog: earthquake happens every day. But --
text: Nyles points across the canyon -- to the cave, right there in
text: plain sight. Sarah heads over, intent on ending this day.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You won’t find what you’re looking
dialog: for in there. Once you go in the day
dialog: will just restart, right back to
dialog: wherever you woke up this morning.
text: Sarah pauses.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Same thing if you stick around. The
dialog: second you fall asleep it just
dialog: starts over. Weird, huh?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: But will this day end if I go in
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Sure. For you.
text: Sarah continues into the cave and vanishes in the darkness.
text: All alone now, Nyles sips his beer, conflicted. He looks back
text: toward the direction of the wedding, and all of its tumult.
text: And into the cave, now with an entirely different feeling of
text: dread. He hangs his head, unable to make a decision.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: SARAH’S CLOSED EYE LIDS OPENING UP --
text: -- but she immediately squints at a harsh ray of sunlight.
scene_heading: INT. CALMADA ESTATE - BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Sun through the curtains. Shag carpet. Black silk sheets.
text: Shower running. She shoots up, peeks OUTSIDE: Howard and Nico
text: carry the altar; Pia talks to the florist. It’s all the same.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No, no, no.
text: In a panic, Sarah turns around, scans the room: The bathroom
text: door. The window to escape. Her keys on the bedside table.
speaker_heading: MISTY (PRE-LAP)
dialog: Wake up.
scene_heading: INT. NYLES’ AND MISTY’S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Nyles wakes up and finds Misty, in her towel, moisturizing
text: her leg. She glances at him, as if expecting a comment.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: Good morning...
text: Nyles curls into a ball, not ready to face the day.
scene_heading: I./E. SARAH'S CAR - MOVING / HIGHWAY - MORNING
text: Sarah races down a desert highway. A blank look on her face.
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - BACKYARD - MORNING
text: Nyles cautiously steps up to the pool, lingering by the edge,
text: anticipating Sarah’s arrival. Jerry kickboards across.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Have you seen Sarah around?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: No, sorry. Maybe she’s with Tala?
text: Nyles, relieved, gives a thumbs up, then falls into the pool.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION, MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - MORNING
text: Sarah downs three 5-Hour-Energy shots as she fills her car.
scene_heading: INT. CALMADA ESTATE - KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Still wet from the pool, Nyles pours every alcohol he can
text: find into a blender, as the family prepares for the wedding.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: She didn’t leave a note or
dialog: anything? Are you sure she didn’t
dialog: text back?
speaker_heading: PIA
dialog: Check my phone if you don’t believe
dialog: me. Sarah realized the day wasn’t
dialog: about her so she left.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Don’t say that.
text: Nyles flips ON the blender -- and it’s LOUD. Pia and Howard
text: both glare at him, but he doesn’t take his eyes off the
text: cyclone of booze. He flips it off and pours into his cup.
speaker_heading: NYLES
text: Or she’s scared.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Who, Sarah? Of what?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Weddings, families, commitment,
dialog: people, death, intimacy, melanoma,
dialog: judgement. Sauce.
text: Pia and Howard stare back at him.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: (resigned)
dialog: She’1l be back.
text: Nyles heads out to the pool.
scene_heading: I./E. SARAH'S CAR - MOVING / HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: Sarah passes a SIGN: “Welcome to Texas.” Windows down, Sarah
text: SLAPS her face to stay awake.
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - BACKYARD - NIGHT
text: As the crowd laughs at Misty’s speech, Nyles watches Daisy
text: fill his wine. He drinks and looks at Sarah’s empty chair,
text: then over to Tala. She’s staring at it too, missing her sis.
scene_heading: I./E. SARAH'S CAR - MOVING / HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: Sarah is still driving. Wide awake. 320z coffee in hand.
scene_heading: INT. NYLES AND MISTY’S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
text: Nyles stumbles in drunk and flops on the bed.
speaker_heading: MISTY (0.S.)
dialog: -- hold my legs up --
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
text: Austin, TX. Sarah parks her car in front of a small home.
scene_heading: INT. SARAH’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING
text: Photo booth strips of Sarah with various friends cover the
text: fridge, depicting a life full of partying and bars. Dishes
text: are piled in the sink. A lone cup in the drying rack.
dialog: 31.
text: Sarah grabs the cup and fills it with water. She drinks, puts
text: it back in the drying rack, then moves into her --
speaker_heading: BEDROOM
text: And finds her two cats on an unmade bed. She shuts her blinds
text: to block the early morning sun and crawls in. She stares up
text: at the ceiling for a moment, mind still racing.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: This is all a dream. This is alla
dialog: dream. This is all a dream.
text: She shuts her eyes.
text: CLOSE ON Sarah’s face... Her closed eyes... Then --
text: A SLIVER OF SUNLIGHT STRIKES HER FACE.
text: Her eyes open. It’s a new day. Shag carpet, black silk
text: sheets. Someone in the shower. She’s back. Fuck.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. NYLES’ AND MISTY’S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Nyles sleeps in bed. Just another day. Misty is in the
text: bathroom. A KNOCK. Nyles doesn’t flinch. The person outside
text: tries to open the door but it’s locked. KNOCK KNOCK.
text: Nyles snores through it.
speaker_heading: MISTY (0.S.)
dialog: Are you getting that?
text: Nope. Misty hurries out of the bathroom and opens the door.
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: Sarah?
text: Sarah barges in and sees Nyles in bed.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Wake up.
text: Nyles moans. Too early for him.
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: Uh... What are you doing?
text: Sarah ignores her. She spots Nyles’ foot sticking out of the
text: sheets, grabs his pinky toe and SNAPS it.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: ow!!
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: What the fuck, Sarah?!
text: Nyles shoots awake, wincing in pain.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Get dressed. I can’t be here
dialog: anymore.
text: Sarah leaves. Misty, totally lost, looks at Nyles.
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: Are you fucking cheating on me?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: No, you're cheating on me, ya goof.
text: Misty’s stunned. Nyles grabs his clothes and follows Sarah.
scene_heading: INT. SARAH’S CAR - DRIVING - MORNING
text: Sarah turns onto the highway. Nyles sits shotgun.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You have a destination in mind, or
dialog: are you just driving aimlessly?
dialog: Because if so, I’d much rather go
dialog: for a float.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Stop talking. Let me think.
text: He offers her a beer and she swiftly accepts, pleasing him.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What is this? I get that it’s the
dialog: same day. But what is it?
text: Nyles inhales, gearing up to give what feels like a rehearsed
text: speech, aimed at quashing any further questioning.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: (in one breath)
dialog: I have no idea what it is. This
dialog: might be life, this might be death,
dialog: might be a dream, I could be
dialog: imagining you, you could be
dialog: imagining me, might be purgatory,
dialog: or this might be a glitch in the
dialog: computer simulation we're in.
dialog: And in another breath:
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: So, after a while I stopped caring
dialog: altogether. The only way to
dialog: actually live in this world is to
dialog: embrace the fact that nothing
dialog: matters. Disappointment, regret,
dialog: guilt will just drive you bonkers.
text: Nyles exhales, sips a beer.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Then what’s the point of living?
text: Sarah presses down on the gas, the car accelerates.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Well, you have no choice but to
dialog: live, so I guess you gotta learn to
dialog: suffer existence.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: So we can’t die?
speaker_heading: NYLES
text: No. The day just starts over. Or
dialog: maybe we can, but I haven't figured
dialog: out the proper way to kill myself
dialog: and I’ve tried them all.
dialog: (sips his beer)
dialog: Slow down a bit.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Why slow down if nothing matters?
text: Sarah's becoming unhinged. Nyles tries a softer approach.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You have to find what brings you
dialog: peace. For me it’s floating in the
dialog: pool with a beer. I think everyone
dialog: can find peace in that. So why
dialog: don’t we turn this car around and
dialog: hit the water?
text: Sarah stares ahead, picking up speed.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No. I need to get out of this.
text: Sarah keeps a serious, dogged expression. She stomps down on
text: the gas and the car quickly gains speed. 100mph -- 115mph --
text: Nyles grows irritated. He unbuckles his seatbelt and
text: maneuvers into an odd, super unsafe crash position.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Bracing for a quick death. We can’t
dialog: die, but pain is a very real thing.
dialog: There’s nothing worse than dying
text: slowly in the ICU.
text: Sarah keeps gaining speed. But at another glance at Nyles in
text: his crash position, she too unbuckles her seatbelt.
text: ON THE ROAD AHEAD, a truck drives in the oncoming lane. Sarah
text: doesn’t let up. She slowly drifts into the other lane.
text: Nyles peeks up to see. He still shows no sign of fear. More
dialog: annoyed than anything.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: We can skip this whole phase and
text: just have a drink at the bar.
dialog: (off her silence)
dialog: Or not. Whatever. See you tomorrow.
text: Sarah stares ahead -- the oncoming truck gets closer, flashes
text: its lights -- but Sarah doesn’t slow down. Closer...Closer...
scene_heading: HORN BLARING -- SARAH’S FACE --
text: NYLES takes one more sip of his beer --
scene_heading: SARAH'S EYES -- TRUCK HORN BLARES -- SCREECHING TIRES --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROADSIDE BIKER BAR - DAY
text: Head in her hands, Sarah stares down at a double whiskey
text: shot, still in a serious existential funk. Nyles leans
text: against the bar, at home in this desert dive.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: As I was saying, you have to find
dialog: peace. One thing that’s nice is no
dialog: one knows me at the wedding.
dialog: Besides Misty, of course. You might
dialog: have trouble with that.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: They don’t want me there, I don’t
dialog: want to be there, so it’s a win-win
dialog: for all.
text: Sarah shoots back her whiskey and slams it down for a refill.
text: Sore subject. Nyles notices. Sarah shifts course --
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I drove all the way back to Austin.
dialog: Still woke up here.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: That’s the way it works. You can go
dialog: anywhere you want.
text: She looks at him: Really?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: As long as you’re awake, you can
dialog: keep moving. I smoked a bunch of
dialog: crystal and made it to Equatorial
dialog: Guinea once. Big waste. They
dialog: detained me once I got off the
dialog: plane, I crashed within minutes,
dialog: back in the desert I found myself.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (intrigued)
dialog: I can go anywhere...
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Yeah, but you don’t want to.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Don’t fucking tell me what I want.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Okay, then go. I don’t give a shit.
dialog: I’m just saying that it’s a hassle.
speaker_heading: DARLA (0.S.)
speaker_heading: WOOHOO!
text: At the DARTS BOARD behind them: Darla hits a bullseye. A
text: disgruntled BIKER hands her cash.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Darla! You and me. Hundred bucks.
text: Darla looks at Nyles for a moment.
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: Who the fuck are you?
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER
text: Nyles demonstrates perfect dart throwing form and hits a
text: bullseye with his first dart. Darla’s stunned by his skills.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: Don’t you know how to hustle, kid?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I’m an honest man, Darla. You are
dialog: going to lose this game, but you
dialog: can keep your money.
text: He smiles, readying the next dart. Sarah stands by, watching.
text: Nyles throws it -- and it goes in the same hole as his first
text: dart, side by side, metal on metal. And it reminds Sarah of:
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Wait. Jesus. Who was that guy with
dialog: the hunting bow?
text: Darla cocks her head, just as Nyles throws his final dart --
text: and misses the board.
speaker_heading: NYLES
speaker_heading: FUCK.
text: He collects himself, marks his score on the chalk scoreboard,
text: and gives the darts to Darla, holding her hand.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Your eyes and hand are one.
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: My eyes and hands are one.
text: Nyles keeps watching Darla, Sarah keeps staring at him,
text: waiting for an answer. He finally looks over.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: That was Roy. He was a guest at the
dialog: wedding. Abe’s dad’s cousin, of the
dialog: Schlieffen clan. Other than that, I
dialog: know very little about the dude.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: But why was he trying to kill you?
text: Nyles sighs. Even thinking about Roy bothers him...
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: One night, a very long time ago, I
dialog: partied with Roy.
speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - BACKYARD - NIGHT
text: We follow a SERVER through the COCKTAIL HOUR with a tray of
text: tuna tartare on wonton crisps. Guests clutching signature
text: cocktails snag bites as she passes --
speaker_heading: NYLES (V.O.)
dialog: This was back in the early days,
dialog: before I really became acquainted
dialog: with everyone. I was still feeling
dialog: my way through...
text: A HAND taps the server on the shoulder, and we turn around
text: with her to find: ROY (50s), white hair, white teeth, grey
text: suit, much less frightening in the light. He grabs a wonton --
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: This tuna?
speaker_heading: SERVER
dialog: Yeah.
text: He takes a bite --
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Mmm. Tasty.
text: The server holds the tray as he takes two more. She moves on,
text: but we follow Roy meander away, smiling at guests he clearly
text: doesn’t know while he continues to eat, until he makes it to --
speaker_heading: THE BAR
text: Where Nyles talks nonsense to Daisy the Bartender.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I know you know. But you don’t know
dialog: that I know. Or do you know?
text: Daisy stares back, unenthused.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You being a dick to Daisy? It takes
dialog: a patient soul to put up with
dialog: pricks like us.
dialog: (to Daisy)
dialog: A more beautiful barkeep I never
dialog: did see... Moscato, please.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: “What might have been and what has
dialog: been point to one end, which is
dialog: always present.”
dialog: 38.
text: Roy considers Nyles, intrigued by this drunk prophet.
speaker_heading: ROY
text: Actually Dais’, two whiskey shots.
text: Daisy pours the shots, hating life. Roy flips through a
text: massive wad of cash, puts a single dollar bill in the tip jar.
text: Roy hands Nyles one of the shots and holds his up --
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: To the struggle.
text: Nyles and Roy take their shots -- just as the guests APPLAUD
text: around the dance floor. The WEDDING PARTY makes their grand
text: entrance. There’s Misty and Trevor, Erin and Nico, Sarah and
text: Randy... And the guests go nuts as Tala and Abe stroll out.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Why do people clap? What’s to clap
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: People clapped when the Titanic set
dialog: sail.
text: Roy chuckles.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Confucius said: Marriage is a
text: seemingly bottomless pit of sorrow
dialog: that makes you forget who you are.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: He did not.
text: Roy smirks at Nyles:
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: But there is a bottom, my friend.
dialog: And it’s dark down here.
text: Nyles gives Roy the hang loose sign.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (leaning in)
dialog: You wanna dance a little?
text: Roy taps his nose.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: The Officiant in the dumb suit --
dialog: 39.
text: Roy gestures to THE OFFICIANT (30s), a bearded guy in a hip
text: Nudie suit (A rhinestone embroidered cowboy suit), who MCs
text: the wedding party entrance.
speaker_heading: ROY
text: Turd bird has a bag of sweets in his
dialog: pocket. I tried to corner him in the
dialog: bathroom, but he won’t share --
text: But Nyles walks away from Roy before he can finish.
text: From ROY’S POV, Nyles walks across the dance floor up to the
text: Officiant, reaches into his pocket, pulls out a bag of pills.
text: The Officiant buries his shock and continues to MC as Nyles,
text: ignoring quizzical looks, returns to an amused Roy.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: (holding up bag)
dialog: Got ‘em.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Nyles and Roy grin at each other, swaying, nostrils caked in
text: different colored powders. Roy keeps licking his lips wildly.
text: Nyles’ gaze goes from watching this to the bathroom door
text: handle jiggling. Someone tries to open it -- POUNDS on it --
speaker_heading: THE OFFICIANT (0.S.)
dialog: Give me back my shit! Open up!
text: Nyles’ eyes drift back to Roy -- but he’s vanished.
speaker_heading: ROY (0.S.)
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Over here.
text: Roy crouches in the bathtub.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Hop in.
text: Nyles joins him. More POUNDING on the door.
speaker_heading: THE OFFICIANT (0.S.)
dialog: Come on, I know you’re in there.
text: Roy Shhhhs Nyles. Nyles Shhhhs him back. They escalate
text: Shhhhing, on and on into GIGGLES --
speaker_heading: THE OFFICIANT (0.S.)
dialog: You guys suck.
dialog: 40.
text: Roy grabs Nyles by the back of his neck and brings him close,
dialog: sweaty forehead to forehead, real intimate --
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I won’t let him hurt you, friend.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: We're in the shit.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: We are the shit. You and I, we’re
dialog: in this together.
text: Nyles stares back, eyes fully dilated, but he begins to
text: look... scared. Not of Roy, but of everything happening. His
text: eyes roll back, but Roy SLAPS him awake --
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: My boy, I got you. We’re alive.
text: Roy holds Nyles head to his breast to comfort him as the
dialog: POUNDING continues --
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - BACKYARD - NIGHT
text: IN SLOW-MOTION: Nyles and Roy tango on the dance floor, tuning
text: out the world around them, lost in this blur of life.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - ON TOP OF A BOULDER - NIGHT
text: Nyles and Roy lie on their backs, staring at the stars, out
text: of their fucking minds, stoned, tripping.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: This is the greatest night of my
dialog: life. The Earth, the stars, the
dialog: holy mother. Grace and love. Peace
dialog: and personality.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I’m not seeing it, Roy.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You'll find it. I know you will.
dialog: Otherwise, what’s the point?
text: They go silent for a moment, star gazing. We see Nyles’ eyes
text: dart as he stares up --
text: THE SKY: Nyles’ creates his own constellations, connecting
text: star to star with trails of light zig zagging into a
text: shapeless, meaningless mess -- his new existence.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Man, I wish I could just live out
dialog: here forever.
text: Nyles looks over at Roy. A fucked up, sad man who seems truly
text: at peace right now.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Follow me.
text: Nyles gets up and slides down the boulder.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HILLSIDE - NIGHT
text: Nyles and Roy stand before the CAVE. A quiet wind inside.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Your ancestors are in there.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: My ancestors?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Your answers. The answers you’re
dialog: looking for.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Alright. I’m in.
text: Nyles wobbles, dizzy, while watching Roy walk in through
text: blurred vision. Nyles’ legs give out and he collapses onto
text: his back, the toll of their binge catching up with him.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Roy... Wait...
text: Nyles dies. Roy continues forth -- then vanishes.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROADSIDE BIKER BAR - DAY
text: Sarah throws darts as Nyles continues.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: That was a mistake. Once Roy
dialog: learned about his new life, he
dialog: didn't take it lightly.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: NYLES (CONT'D)
dialog: Luckily he lives out in Irvine and
dialog: wakes up there every day, so he
dialog: only comes around every few...
dialog: days? weeks? My concept of time is
dialog: fuzzy.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What does he want?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You got a taste the other night. I
dialog: think he thinks it’s revenge?
speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
scene_heading: INT. DARK ROOM
text: A shirtless, sweaty Roy cracks a whip as he SCREAMS at Nyles,
text: gagged and tied to a chair under a single swinging lightbulb.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROADSIDE BIKER BAR - DAY
text: Nyles stares ahead, reflecting on the memory.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: He may have some anger issues.
speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
scene_heading: INT. DARK ROOM
text: Roy waterboards Nyles.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY
text: A fully naked Nyles sprints for his life through the desert,
text: running zig zag patterns... He looks back, and UP: An ARROW
text: flies through the air -- hits his shoulder, takes him down.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROADSIDE BIKER BAR - DAY
text: The darts game is over. Now both Sarah and Darla listen
text: attentively to Nyles’ story.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: He even stopped for a while. I
dialog: thought I was safe. I settled back
dialog: into a routine. I felt good.
speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - BACKYARD - MORNING
text: IN SLOW MOTION: Nyles does a cannonball into the pool.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: NYLES (V.O.)
dialog: But then he hit me where it hurt.
text: Nyles surfaces with a gasp, spitting up water --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: What the fuck’s that smell1??
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Jerry?
text: But he’s not there. Nyles SNIFFS again, then --
speaker_heading: ROY (0.S.)
dialog: How’s the water?
text: Roy walks up smoking a cigar, holding an empty gas can.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Looks a little cold.
text: Before Nyles can react, Roy tosses his cigar in the pool,
text: engulfing Nyles in flames.
text: Roy, fire reflected in his eyes, just watches.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROADSIDE BIKER BAR - DAY
text: Nyles shoots back a shot of tequila, numbing his PTSD.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: So I vowed to never bring anyone
dialog: else into this life again. Not
text: everyone is cut out for it.
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: Amen to that. I tied my tubes at
dialog: forty.
text: Despite his nonchalance, Sarah senses Nyles is still troubled.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You need to confront him. You can’t
dialog: keep running from this guy forever.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: What’re you talking about, yeah I
dialog: can!
text: Nyles gets up and opens the door, the desert sun floods in.
dialog: 44,
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT TACO STAND - DAY
text: A hole-in-the-wall taco stand. Nyles and Sarah finish up
text: burritos. A MEXICAN BOY, 8, walks up with a box of candy.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Chocolate? For charity...
text: Nyles takes $100 out of his wallet and hands it to the kid.
text: The kid’s eyes go wide. Nyles speaks to the kid in Spanish.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: One Kit Kat, a Snickers...
dialog: (to Sarah)
dialog: What candy do you like?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Twix.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Good choice.
dialog: (to the boy)
dialog: One Twix. Keep the change, friend.
dialog: And make sure you spend it all
dialog: today. Buy flowers for that girl
dialog: Ignacia you have a crush on.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Thank you!
text: The boy walks off, staring at the money.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You know that’s a scam. Notice how
dialog: he didn’t say which charity?
text: Nyles turns to the kid, now selling to another table.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: What’s the name of your charity?
text: The boy turns, panics, then sprints down the road.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I know there’s no charity. I give
dialog: back when I can. I have no interest
dialog: in material matters.
text: Sarah watches in disgust as he douses his burrito with hot
text: sauce, then takes a huge bite.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Other than beers, burritos,
dialog: designer drugs, and candy.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: (chewing through)
dialog: Obviously. I’m not a Puritan.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What about sex?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I’m not not into sex. But it’s been
text: in a steady decline.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Because Misty’s cheating on you?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Nah, I don’t care about that. We
dialog: have sex all the time. But no
dialog: matter how you feel about someone,
dialog: physically or emotionally, the
text: novelty is bound to fade.
text: Sarah studies him. Is he being serious? Hard to tell.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: But to have to live with that over
dialog: and over again, to experience that
dialog: level of betrayal every day, that
dialog: might really fuck a person up.
text: Nyles studies her.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Yeahhh, but it’d be pretty pathetic
dialog: of me to hold a grudge.
text: Nyles finishes off his beer. Sarah reaches under the table
text: and grabs two more from the box of Tecate.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What about fucking other people?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Oh I have. It just takes a lot of
dialog: work and I put very little effort
dialog: into my life.
text: A thought strikes Sarah.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: We've never had sex, right?
dialog: EXT.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: No. At least not that I recall.
dialog: Memory is another thing that fades
dialog: with time, but that may also just
dialog: be alcoholism.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah, you said that already.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: See my point?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Okay... Who, then? Besides Misty.
dialog: Just curious.
speaker_heading: NYLES
text: Daisy. The barkeep.
speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
speaker_heading: DESERT - NIGHT
text: Nyles lies on a boulder while Daisy rides him, berating him --
dialog: EXT.
text: INT.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: You are a prop. You are my little
dialog: fucking dildo.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Oh my goodness.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: DESERT TACO STAND - DAY
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I can see that. Who else?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Darla.
speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
scene_heading: DARLA’S TRAILER - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Nyles and Darla lie on the bed, caressing each other. She
text: grabs his head and brings it to her bosom.
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: You make me feel illegal.
text: Nyles kisses her belly tenderly... He looks at her and locks
text: eyes. He nods. She guides him down further, between her legs.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
dialog: 47.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT TACO STAND - DAY
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I need to be put in my place
dialog: sometimes. But it’s great because I
dialog: always get to wake up alone. Or, ya
dialog: know, emotionally.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That’s something an asshole says.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Guess I have no choice but to be an
dialog: asshole.
text: Nyles takes another bite of his burrito.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What about Tala?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: HA. No. Tala actually is a Puritan.
dialog: But I have tried.
speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
text: Tala and Abe slow dance, gazing into each other’s eyes.
text: Nyles, dressed in a tux, taps on Abe’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Ahem. May I cut in?
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: It’s the first dance.
text: REVEAL: All of the guests watch. It is indeed the first dance.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Please. The one dance. And possibly
dialog: some over-the-clothes stuff.
speaker_heading: TALA
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT TACO STAND - DAY
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah. That’s Tala. Anyone else?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Jerry.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You fucked Jerry Schlieffen?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: He fucked me.
text: Off Sarah’s bewildered look --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: He stuck his penis in my butthole--
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah, I got it.
speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
text: NYLES FACE -- He looks nervous...
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I’m ready...
text: He WINCES as he’s penetrated. But after a moment, he settles
text: into it, nodding. He looks back to Jerry --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You know, it’s not that bad.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT TACO STAND - DAY
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I'm glad I tried it. Turns out I’m
dialog: not really into dudes.
text: Nyles gathers their burrito wrappers and tosses each of them
text: over his shoulder across the patio, directly into the trash.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That’s it?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Oh, and your dad.
speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - BACKYARD - LATE NIGHT
text: IN A HOT TUB: Nyles and Howard are forehead-to-forehead --
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: What are we doing?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I don’t know.
dialog: 49,
text: Howard goes in for the kiss.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT TACO STAND - DAY
text: Sarah processes, confused. Nyles stares back. For a long time.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Okay, fine, that one didn’t happen.
dialog: (continuing casually)
dialog: What about you? Solid sex life?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I’m not going to fuck you, so don’t
dialog: even try. Maybe would have the
dialog: other night. Not now, though.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Girl, I was thinking the same thing.
text: Sarah squints, studying him...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You promise we’ve never hooked up?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Again, my memory is shot, but I
dialog: don’t think so.
dialog: (looking up at the sun)
dialog: Party’s about to start. Head back?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Uh. No. Why would I do that?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Eat, drink, dance. Bask in looove.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That’s not love.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Sure it is! Tala’s in love.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: HA! For someone who knows
dialog: everything, you really have no idea
dialog: what you're talking about.
text: Nyles sees he struck a bad chord there.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Tala and Abe are like 95% of all
dialog: couples.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: SARAH (CONT'D)
dialog: They hit the point in their
dialog: relationship where they got bored,
dialog: but are so emotionally stunted they
dialog: can’t be alone. So, they fall
dialog: victim to the most archaic
dialog: patriarchal scam of all time:
dialog: marriage. Weddings: An industry
dialog: designed to turn you against the
dialog: one you ‘love.’
text: Nyles tries to chime in, but Sarah gets passionate --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: How any woman with an ounce of self
dialog: respect is okay spending tens of
dialog: thousands of dollars so their
dialog: father can ‘give them away,’ AND
dialog: calls it the fucking high point of
dialog: their life... it’s one of society's
dialog: greatest tragedies.
text: Nyles opens his mouth again, but --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Why, when anyone tries to simply
dialog: start a dialogue is it always
dialog: suppressed? Because we, you and me
dialog: and everyone, are weak. We can’t
dialog: stand the idea of being alone, so
dialog: we buy into the pageantry and
dialog: celebrate its bullshit.
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: And the other 5% of couples?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: They have a relaxed no-frills
dialog: celebration without any friends or
dialog: family, just free booze and their
dialog: own mutual respect. They party like
dialog: it’s their last night on earth,
dialog: have incredible sex, and then --
dialog: they get divorced.
dialog: We aren’t built to spend our entire
text: lives with another person.
text: Nyles sips his beer.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Okay. So, no wedding I guess. What
dialog: do you want to do?
dialog: 51.
text: Sarah sits back, moving on.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Maybe it’s a karma thing?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: What is?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Maybe that’s how I get out of this.
dialog: Be selfless and you’re free.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I just bought you a hundred dollar
dialog: Twix, and I’m still here.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No, real acts of selflessness. The
dialog: bone marrow shit Tala does.
text: She looks around at the various people at the taco stand.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Maybe life goes on for everyone
dialog: else here, just not us, until we've
dialog: earned our way out. So, tomorrow,
dialog: that kid will still have a hundred
dialog: bucks to spend.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: And there’s a world where Tala is
text: missing her teeth.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: But there are millions of worlds
dialog: where she isn’t. Have you really
dialog: never thought of this before?
dialog: Of course he has. Still, he humors her --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Okay. Maybe you’re right. Then what
dialog: is the most selfless act you could
dialog: do? Something that would absolutely
dialog: guarantee an end to this day.
text: Sarah thinks for a brief second. She knows what to do.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 52.
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - WEDDING CEREMONY AREA - SUNSET
text: TRIBAL MUSIC begins and the guests quiet down for the
text: ceremony. Two DANCERS in green leotards dance down the aisle,
text: weaving between hay bales, tossing glitter on guests.
text: From here we catch brief snapshots of the wedding:
text: - Abe and his MOM stroll down the aisle to CHEERS.
text: - The WEDDING PARTY walks down... Misty and Trevor, Erin and
text: Nico, Sarah and Randy. Nyles gives her two thumbs up.
text: EVERYONE STANDS to watch Tala walk with Howard. As Tala and
text: Abe meet at the altar, their faces stretch into the greatest
text: smile of their lives. Abe’s eyes well up, Tala starts crying.
text: The Officiant wipes a tear. Howard sobs, Pia comforts him. We
text: pan the audience: EVERYONE feels the love.
text: And then there’s Sarah. She steps forward --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Hold up!
text: Puzzled looks fill the crowd. Nyles, too. At this point he
text: has no idea what her “selfless act” actually is.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Sarah ignores him and takes the mic from The Officiant.
text: She holds it up to her mouth, words on the tip of her
text: tongue... but looking out at audience, and then to Tala...
text: she reconsiders, and lowers the mic.
text: She walks up to Tala, pulls her into a tight hug and says
text: something inaudible into her ear. The onlooking crowd waits.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (quietly to Nyles)
dialog: What is she doing?
text: Nyles shrugs. No clue.
text: Sarah releases the hug, tears fill her eyes. She hands the
text: mic to The Officiant, the flowers to Pia, and walks away.
text: Everyone turns to Tala for an explanation. She’s in shock.
text: Speechless. She looks at her parents, a silent cry for help.
text: At Abe. At everyone. Heavy breathing, the world is ending --
scene_heading: -- THE EARTHQUAKE HITS --
dialog: 53.
text: EVERYBODY PANICS. Pia holds Tala. Howard holds the altar
text: steady. One guest sprints away. A baby cries.
text: Nyles remains calm, but confused --
text: THE EARTHQUAKE STOPS. The guests glance around with relief.
speaker_heading: THE OFFICIANT
dialog: Look at that. The gods have spoken
dialog: and they approve this marriage!
text: But Tala is now SOBBING into Pia’s shoulder.
scene_heading: INT. ROADSIDE BIKER BAR - NIGHT
text: Sarah’s far more relaxed, with an almost celebratory vibe as
text: she takes shots and plays pool with a couple barflies.
text: The front door swings open, Nyles steps in --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: What the hell did you say to her?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Doesn't matter, sister stuff. But I
dialog: think I’m good. Karma’s fucking
dialog: great. Selflessness is fantastic.
text: Sarah hits two balls in at once.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Pay up boys.

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (to the Ted the Bartender)
dialog: Two shots of your finest whiskey.
text: Ted pours the shots. Sarah holds one out for Nyles --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Well, Nyles, it’s been great. Or,
dialog: interesting, at least. If this ever
dialog: happens again, please keep me out
dialog: of the cave. Good luck with the
dialog: psychopath. Deal with him. Maybe
dialog: that’s your way out.
text: They clink their glasses and take the shot.

scene_heading: INT. NYLES’ AND MISTY’S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Nyles sleeps in bed. Just another day. Someone POUNDING on
text: the door. Misty wraps a towel around her body --
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: Hold on, I’m coming!
text: She unlocks it and Sarah barges in, straight to Nyles --
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: What the hell, Sarah?
text: Nyles jolts up.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Didn't work. Life is meaningless.
dialog: Let’s get the fuck out of here.
text: She heads out. Misty looks at Nyles as he rolls out of bed --
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: Are you --
dialog: Nyles jumps in --
speaker_heading: NYLES MISTY
dialog: -- fucking cheating on me? -- fucking cheating on me?
text: Nyles pulls on his swim trunks --
speaker_heading: NYLES / MISTY
dialog: (in unison)
dialog: What? ... This isn’t funny.
text: Nyles puts on his Hawaiian shirt, Misty is freaking out --
speaker_heading: NYLES / MISTY
dialog: Okay, stop... I’m serious... Don’t
dialog: copy me... Stop pretending like you
dialog: know everything... I hate, agh --

scene_heading: INT. CALMADA ESTATE - BEDROOM - MORNING

scene_heading: EXT. GUN RANGE - DAY

speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Kill shot.
text: Sarah steps up with an AK-47 and scans the targets. Castro,
text: Osama Bin Laden, and some guy with a handlebar mustache.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Who’s the mustache?
text: SPUDS (50), the owner, stands by with a bazooka. A GOAT
text: grazes in a PEN behind him.
speaker_heading: SPUDS
dialog: The prick my wife ran off with.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: How’d you get such a good picture?
speaker_heading: SPUDS
dialog: Facebook.
scene_heading: SARAH FIRES -- DESTROYING THE MUSTACHE MAN’S HEAD.
scene_heading: I/E. SARAH’S CAR/HIGHWAY - DAY

dialog: 56.
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
text: Sarah (not dressed for the wedding) walks to the edge of the
text: dance floor. Randy drunkenly dances up to her.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What up, Sarah? We missed you
text: earlier. Tala’s pissed.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I missed you.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What?
text: Sarah leans in to his ear --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Meet me in the bathroom in ten
dialog: minutes... And you better be naked.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: You’re messing with me, right?
text: Sarah grabs his crotch --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Use your shirt as a blindfold...
dialog: And film me when you walk in.
text: off Randy’s bewildered smile --
scene_heading: INT. OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Randy is naked, blindfolded by his shirt, holding his iPhone
text: out to record. He takes a deep breath, then opens the door --
text: REVEAL: Trevor going down on Misty --
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: Randy! Fuck!
text: And just behind them we see Nyles and Sarah watching the
text: scene through the bathroom window, loving it.
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN DESERT - DAY

text: Nyles DIGS into the cake, GASPS throughout the crowd, and he
text: finds a BRICK OF C4.
speaker_heading: PIA
dialog: Oh my god!
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: It’s okay, I used to be a bomb guy.
text: Nyles takes an arrow and STABS it into the C4, cocks the
text: crossbow, and FIRES it into the air --
text: It EXPLODES above the party, a bizarrely beautiful fireworks
text: display, interrupted by --
text: SARAH, riding up on a motorcycle. She stops by the pool.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Hey, that’s my motorcycle --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (to Nyles)
dialog: You son of a bitch! You ruined my
dialog: plan to kill everyone!
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Sarah! The sister of the bride! I
dialog: should’ve known it was you!
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: NYLES (CONT'D)
dialog: (then)
dialog: Howard, I’1l take her alive, if
dialog: it’s the last thing I do.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Son, please, put the weapon down --
text: Sarah TACKLES Nyles into the pool --
scene_heading: INT. SMALL PROP PLANE - CARGO HOLD - DAY
text: Nyles (helmet and goggles on) feigns a confident smile and
text: thumbs up to Sarah as he’s led to the open door by his tandem
dialog: skydiving INSTRUCTOR --
text: Sarah pushes by and leaps OUT of the plane, without her
text: parachute, turning back at Nyles with two middle fingers --
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR
dialog: NO NO NO NO NO!!!
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN DESERT - DAY
text: Wide shot, brutal sun, clear blue sky, A FIGURE rockets
text: TOWARD the Earth -- it’s SARAH -- in FREEFALL, dive-bombing --
text: THUMP!!! A mini mushroom cloud where she hits the ground.
scene_heading: ON THE GROUND - LATER
text: Nyles and the instructor hurry out of the prop plane -- Nyles
text: laughs maniacally while the instructor frantically sprints to

text: to Nyles, still laughing as he marches INTO THE PROPELLER --
scene_heading: INT. CALMADA ESTATE - NYLES AND MISTY’S BEDROOM - MORNING

scene_heading: INT. ROADSIDE BIKER BAR - NIGHT

text: The unenthused BARFLIES all wear PARTY HATS, Darla claps --
text: Sarah covers her smile, truly touched and surprised --
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Have I really been here that long?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You’re asking the wrong guy --
text: Nyles lifts up a CONFETTI CANNON and blasts her face --
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Nyles, Sarah, and five other DESERT HIPSTERS party --
text: drinking, dancing, snorting blow. A couple of them make out.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Everyone is passed out. Four packed on the bed, including
text: Sarah, eyes closed, nuzzling into Nyles’ arm.
text: ON NYLES’ FACE, watching Sarah fall asleep, weighing
text: something in his head... He drifts to sleep.
scene_heading: INT. NYLES AND MISTY’S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Nyles opens his eyes. An empty space next to him, as always.
scene_heading: EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY
text: END MONTAGE ON: Sarah and Nyles drive away from us down a
text: dirt road deep in the desert...
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT PLATEAU - SUNSET
text: Nyles and Sarah sit by a small fire, empty desert vista
text: behind them. Sarah holds a cheeseburger. Nyles chews a Twix.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Think of it like this --
text: Nyles holds up his half-eaten Twix and gestures to the area
dialog: that’s gone.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Everything in this void here, where
dialog: the Twix once was but is now in my
dialog: stomach, is the past.
text: He gestures to the remainder of the Twix bar --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: And everything that’s left to eat is
text: the future, encased in chocolate.
text: Sarah keeps listening... Nyles gestures to the void again.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: None of this concerns me. The who,
dialog: what, why of your past. You got
dialog: here, that’s all that matters. You
dialog: ate some Twix and pooped it out. No
dialog: need to sift through the shit.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: But if you really want to know
dialog: someone deeper, it does matter. You
dialog: have to know the whole package.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Packages suck. Does what you said to
dialog: Tala at the altar concern me? Nah.
dialog: All that matters is it convinced you
dialog: to let it go. This --
text: He shows his next bite -- layers of crunchy cookie, caramel --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: -- the next bite is all that
dialog: matters.
dialog: (takes another bite)
dialog: Devote all of your energy to what’s
dialog: happening in this precise moment.
dialog: (another bite)
dialog: Now. And again --
dialog: (another bite, chewing)
dialog: Passing.. Now...
text: With every ‘Now,’ Nyles watches an imaginary figure drift
text: away - from the Twix - off into the distance.
text: Sarah stares back at him, unimpressed.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I was married for two years.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You don’t need to tell me about
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I still am, technically. Divorce
text: takes a while.
dialog: (then)
dialog: My family hated him. My dad's the
text: kind of guy who desperately tries to
dialog: see the good in everyone, and even
dialog: he hated the guy.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Good thing none of that matters
dialog: anymore.
text: Sarah ignores Nyles’ attempt to keep her from opening up.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I knew it wasn’t going to work out
dialog: when I said ‘yes,’ I knew it wasn’t
dialog: going to work out when I moved to
dialog: Austin for him, I knew it wasn’t
dialog: going to work out as I walked down
dialog: the aisle. But I went through with
dialog: it. And it didn’t work out. And
dialog: ignoring all of that would make me
dialog: destined to repeat it.
text: Nyles stares in the middle distance as his chewing slows.
text: Like he’s short circuiting.
text: Silence. For a long time.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: These are fantastic mushrooms.
text: Sarah stares at her burger. It’s so juicy...
text: Nyles digs through his memory... it’s fading fast... then
text: snaps back into it, momentarily --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You could be dead tomorrow...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Except I can’t be dead tomorrow.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: But if you could, all that energy
dialog: spent focusing on the past and
dialog: future will have been wasted...
dialog: Energy is everything. Energy is...
speaker_heading: SARAH NYLES
dialog: Everything. Everything.
text: Sarah processes... Losing her grip... She puts up a finger --
text: hold on. She walks behind some bushes and pukes 0.S., then
text: returns, wiping her mouth. Reengaged --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What if I want to invest some
dialog: present energy into my future? Like
dialog: my burger.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: SARAH (CONT'D)
dialog: I have maybe one bite in me, but I
dialog: also know the center is going to be
dialog: the tastiest part. So what if I go
dialog: straight for the center and skip
dialog: the edges.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Don’t ever skip the edges.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I hate the edges.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I feel sorry for you then.
text: A beat. Sarah begins to smile...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: If you feel sorry for me, that
dialog: Means you care about me, Nyles.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: (deflecting)
dialog: When I say “I feel sorry,” it’s in
dialog: the same way that I feel slightly
dialog: annoyed when I finish a beer and
dialog: need to open a new one.
dialog: (he opens another beer)
text: It’s a fleeting feeling. It drifts
text: away, like everything else.
text: Nyles watches the imaginary ‘It’ drift away. Sarah studies
text: him as he sips his beer...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What else has drifted away?
text: Nyles goes silent, his thoughts take him somewhere else.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Nyles?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Everything.
text: (smiling, holding up his beer)
dialog: Cheers.
text: He’s burying something, but she’s not in the right headspace
dialog: to push him further.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: To pretending not to care.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: To pretending --
text: Nyles FREEZES, drops his beer, eyes wide, staring at
text: something in the distance. A child-like grin takes shape as
text: he’s fully entranced by what he’s looking at.
text: Sarah turns her head to see --
scene_heading: MILES AWAY: SILHOUETTES TRAVERSING THE SUNSET. DINOSAURS. A
text: BRONTOSAURUS MOTHER LEADS HER TWO SMALLER DINO CUBS.
text: Sarah's face glows with pure joy.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Oh my god.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You see them, too?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Are they real?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Who cares?
text: As they watch the dinosaurs, Sarah moves to the other side of
text: the fire and sits down next to Nyles.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: They're beautiful.
text: She smiles and grabs Nyles’ hand. He squeezes back.
text: THE EARTHQUAKE HITS -- but Nyles and Sarah don’t react.
text: They're locked onto the dinosaurs. Off this tableau --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Nyles pisses on the fire to extinguish it. The light of the
text: lantern shines through the tent behind him.
scene_heading: INT. TENT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Nyles crawls into his sleeping bag. Sarah’s still awake.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Au revoir, mi amigo.
text: Nyles shuts his eyes. Sarah watches him drift into sleep...
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Nyles.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Mmmhmm. . .
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Let’s just get it over with and
dialog: fuck.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: (caught off guard)
dialog: Okay.
text: Sarah straddles him and starts kissing him, taking charge.
text: She takes off his shirt. Then her own. As she goes back in --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Wait.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What?
text: Nyles, though drunk and still coming down from the mushrooms,
text: is quite taken by Sarah, by her body, by the whole situation.
text: It’s intense and real and complicated. To the point where
dialog: Sarah feels uncomfortable by the vulnerability. So --
text: She skirts past it, pulls him toward her, and they go at it.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT PLATEAU - NIGHT
text: Locked on the tent, the lantern casts shadows, subtle moans
text: merge with the desert sounds -- creaking insects, the
text: smoldering fire, a coyote’s howl. We MOVE AWAY from the tent,
text: through the smoke of the fire, and float UP --
text: Off the plateau, drifting into the night, moving on from this
text: moment... And now the tent is merely a spec, a dot of light,
text: in the distance.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: SARAH OPENS HER EYES, WAKING UP...
scene_heading: INT. CALMADA ESTATE - BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
text: But her face wears conflicted emotions, more like a bad
dialog: hangover than the post-coital elation one might expect. She
text: considers sitting up, but it’s all too heavy for her right
text: now. She gives up and lies there, listening to the shower run.
dialog: 65.
scene_heading: INT. CALMADA ESTATE - HALLWAY - MORNING
text: Sarah walks through the house to wake up Nyles, but she stops
text: at the BRIDAL SUITE. The door is ajar. She peeks INSIDE:
text: Tala sips on a mimosa while Erin does her hair, both smiling.
text: Sarah watches, longing for this happiness she can never share
dialog: with her sister.
text: PRE-LAP: The sound of a beer can opening.
scene_heading: INT. SARAH'S CAR - DRIVING - DAY
text: Sarah sips her beer, driving. In the passenger seat, Nyles
text: has a fresh glow and a twinkle in his eyes.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I gotta say, I felt different this
dialog: morning. Like... goooooood. In a
dialog: good way though, ya know?
text: Sarah's off in another world.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Because of last night?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Oh. Yeah.
text: She glances in the rearview mirror, noticing a dark car a
dialog: ways back. Is this guy following her?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Is that a “Yeah” of regret? Or...?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah, it was fun. Tension relief.
dialog: It’s fun to relieve tension.
text: She's still looking at this car. It’s a little closer now.
text: Close enough to see that it’s a POLICE CAR.
text: Nyles doesn’t notice, more concerned by her response.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Should we talk about it?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What’s to talk about, it’s all
dialog: meaningless, and technically that
dialog: happened tonight.
dialog: 66.
text: Nyles sits back, put off by the cold turn she’s taken.
text: Sarah throws her beer out the window, and checks the mirror
text: for the cop’s reaction.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: So we’re littering now?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (re: the cop)
dialog: Nothing still, Jesus. This cop’s
dialog: been following us for miles. What's
dialog: this fucker’s deal?
text: Sarah presses the gas to pick up speed. 90mph and climbing.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Are you trying to get pulled over?
text: ON NYLES... thinking... he turns around and squints at the
text: cop car, still following at the same distance. Nyles seems to
dialog: be piecing something together in his head...
text: 100mph. The cop turns the sirens on.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Finally!
text: Sarah starts slowing down.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Believe it or not I’ve never been
dialog: arrested before. Curious to see
dialog: what it’s all about.
text: Nyles looks back one more time. His eyes go wide.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: No.
text: Dead serious, he slouches in his seat, out of view.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I think it’s him.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Him?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Roy.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Oh! That fucker.
text: Sarah screeches to a halt. The cop car stops right behind. We
text: only see the cop’s silhouette, his sheriff’s hat...
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Keep driving.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No way. If you aren’t going to deal
dialog: with him, someone has to.
text: Sarah gets out of the car and throws her arms up --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Help! He’s trying to kill me!
text: Sarah runs back toward the cop car as Nyles sinks deeper into
dialog: his seat -- what the hell is she doing?
text: NYLES’ POV: Sarah reaches the cop car, frantically shouting.
speaker_heading: COP'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: (on the microphone)
dialog: Sir, step out of the vehicle!
text: Nyles freezes. Maybe it isn’t Roy. Now what?
speaker_heading: COP'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: (on the microphone)
dialog: If you don’t step out, I have no
dialog: choice but to remove you by force.
text: Nyles peeks back again: the cop slowly approaches Sarah’s
text: car. Still backlit, but it doesn’t look like Roy. This guy
text: has a mustache. Nyles breathes a sigh of relief.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Okay! I’m coming out!
text: Nyles opens the door, puts his hands up, still holding his
text: beer, and slowly stands, his back to the officer.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Sorry Mr. Policeman, I thought you
dialog: were someone else.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Oh yeah, who’s that?
text: Nyles turns and locks eyes with the cop, who’s now at the
text: trunk of Sarah’s car... And Nyles’ relief drains.
dialog: 68.
text: It’s Roy, wearing a huge grin -- and a fake mustache.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Howdy, stranger.
dialog: Roy raises a SHOTGUN --
text: SCREECH -- ROY TURNS JUST AS SARAH HITS HIM WITH THE COP CAR,
text: PINNING HIM BETWEEN THE TWO VEHICLES.
text: ON SARAH, surprised by the mix of pleasure and horror she’s
text: feeling. She shakes off those thoughts, backs the cop car up.
text: Roy collapses, broken in half, held together by skin.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (on the microphone)
dialog: You called for back up?
text: Nyles stares at Roy twitching on the ground, gasping for life.
text: BWOOP BWOOP -- Sarah messes with the cop car sounds.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: -.. Who... is that?
text: Nyles shakes his head, conflicted. This asshole’s caused him
text: so much pain, but it’s hard to watch someone die.
scene_heading: BWOOP BWOOP.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (on the microphone)
dialog: Please step inside my vehicle, sir.
text: As Roy wheezes, Nyles steps back to the cop car, maintaining
text: eye contact with Roy the whole way.
scene_heading: INT. COP CAR - DRIVING - DAY
text: Nyles chugs beer in the passenger seat, dazed, even
text: remorseful, but trying to stay composed while Sarah drives.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Lighten up, dude. Look what he was
dialog: planning to use on you.
text: Sarah gestures to the backseat where there’s an aquarium with
text: a COBRA SNAKE. It hisses, spitting venom against the glass.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Let’s do something crazy.
text: Nyles looks around at their stolen cop car.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Isn't this crazy?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Let’s rob a gas station. Ooh, what
dialog: about a bank?
text: Nyles doesn’t share in her excitement.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: What’s with the sudden blood lust?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It’s not blood lust. It’s about
dialog: trying something new.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You just killed a guy.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah, a fucking sadist, dude.
dialog: You've had forever to play around
dialog: in this world but I haven’t. You
dialog: can’t expect me to take your word
dialog: for everything.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: What about the karma?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah, I don’t believe in that
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Oh. Really?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Of course not. That’s what you’ve
dialog: been telling me from day one. “The
dialog: only way to live is to embrace the
dialog: fact that nothing matters.” Right?
dialog: So I’m embracing it.
dialog: 69.
text: Nyles sits back. She’s right. But he doesn’t want to admit
text: it. He glances out the window, searching for an answer, a
text: distraction, and notices a BILLBOARD for a local casino.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: What about the casino?
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Ooo, good call. That’s even better
dialog: than a bank.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I don’t mean rob the place. Being a
dialog: source of terror isn’t fun and
dialog: isn’t fulfilling. It doesn’t matter
dialog: that everything resets and people
dialog: forget. WE have to live with what
dialog: we do. I draw a line at cruelty.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: For a guy who supposedly cares
dialog: about nothing, you seem to have a
dialog: lot of lines you won't cross.
text: Nyles drinks his beer, done debating this.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Whatever, fine. We’ll go to the
dialog: casino and not rob it.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Pussy.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Thank you.
text: Nyles raises his beer in cheers -- as Sarah stomps on the gas
text: and accelerates down the highway --
scene_heading: INT. CASINO - NIGHT
text: Sarah slams her hands down on a half-full BLACKJACK table as
text: she takes a seat. Nyles sits beside her --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (to the DEALER)
dialog: I’m gonna count cards. Cool?
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: Please don’t.
text: The Dealer starts dealing out the next hand. Sarah counts
text: cards out loud, albeit completely incorrectly.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: King, nine, ace, three. Nyles,
dialog: wanna jump in here?
text: Nyles lightens up, glad to get back to the innocuous fun --
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Sure thing. Three, four, three. Lot
dialog: of threes.
text: A GRUMPY PLAYER groans, then takes a bite of his HOT DOG.
text: Sarah adds a few $100 BLACK CHIPS to her bet --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Bold move, I dig it.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: You can’t bet during your hand.
speaker_heading: GRUMPY PLAYER
dialog: These fucking kids --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Don’t call me a fucking kid. I
dialog: didn’t know I couldn’t bet more.
dialog: (to Dealer)
dialog: Apologies.
text: Sarah kisses her fingertips and makes a peace sign -- and
text: rotates into a middle finger aimed at the Grumpy Player.
text: Nyles clocks this as the Dealer looks at him for his turn.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I’ll stay...
text: Sarah’s turn, but she’s still shooting angry eyes at the
text: Grumpy Player. He stares back at her, dead-eyed.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I want more.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You already have nineteen.
speaker_heading: GRUMPY PLAYER
dialog: You don’t want to hit, sweetheart.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Don’t tell me what to fucking do.
dialog: (to Dealer)
dialog: Hit me. Hard.
text: The Dealer lays down a QUEEN on her TEN/NINE. BUST.
speaker_heading: GRUMPY PLAYER
dialog: You took my card, bitch.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: NYLES SARAH
dialog: Hey! That’s not nice! The fuck did you call me?
speaker_heading: GRUMPY PLAYER
dialog: Screw you two, fucking amateurs.
dialog: This isn’t daycare.
text: Sarah gets in his face as Nyles tries holding her back --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Oh suck my dick you greasy fucking
dialog: hot dog man.
speaker_heading: GRUMPY PLAYER
dialog: (to Nyles)
dialog: You should keep a tighter leash on
dialog: your girlfriend and her nasty mouth --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Hey! Screw you, dude --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I’m not his girlfriend --
text: Nyles shoots her an surprised look --
text: Sarah KNEES the Grumpy Player in the nuts, grabs all of his
dialog: chips and bolts for the door --
scene_heading: EXT. CASINO - ENTRANCE DOORS / PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Sarah bursts through the doors, giggling and delirious,
text: followed by an exasperated Nyles, the Security Guards and the
text: Grumpy Man now in pursuit.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: What the hell is going on with you?!
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That guy had it coming to him.
dialog: You're supposed to be on my side!
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I was on your side!
text: Nyles is losing steam -- then -- a SECURITY GUARD in a golf
text: cart speeds up beside them --
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Freeze, asshole!
text: Sarah THROWS her CHIPS at his face, causing him to swerve --
dialog: 73.
text: Nyles and Sarah keep running -- almost to the car --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: (to the Guard)
dialog: It’s not worth it, man! Back off --
text: The Security Guard FIRES HIS TASER into Nyles’ neck -- Nyles
text: YELPS and tumbles onto the asphalt, writhing.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: A COP sits a handcuffed Nyles on the curb beside Sarah, also
text: handcuffed. Nyles’ face is scraped and bloodied from the
text: fall. Sarah seems... excited. Almost manic.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Not quite what I had in mind, but
dialog: glad we did it, ya know? This world
dialog: is too small for dicks like that.
text: She gestures to the Grumpy Player giving his statement to the
text: cops. But Nyles looks at her, blank-faced. We now see his
text: right eyeball is completely red and draining bloody tears.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You're a fucking lunatic.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Oh shut up. No one got “harmed.”
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I DID. I’m crying blood.
text: Sarah chuckles, but Nyles is really pissed.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You’1l be fine tomorrow.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: PAIN IS REAL. Why can’t you
dialog: understand that?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters.
dialog: Those are your words.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Pain matters! What we do to other
dialog: people matters! We were having fun.
dialog: Then you killed Roy.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You were never going to deal with
dialog: him. I did you a favor. So, fuck
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: No, Sarah fuck you. You act like a
dialog: child, which is exactly what led to
dialog: you being stuck in this shit in the
dialog: first place.
text: This strikes a nerve with Sarah. So, she KICKS him.
dialog: A beat...
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Ow! See?! A child!
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Knock it off, over there!
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I’m stuck in this shit because YOU
dialog: got me stuck in it.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: HA! I told you to stop, but nope,
dialog: can’t tell you what to do because
dialog: you've got it all figured out.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I followed you because I liked you
dialog: and someone was trying to hurt you.
dialog: Because I GIVE A SHIT, which you
dialog: clearly know nothing about. But had
dialog: I known I’d be stuck with a
dialog: pretentious, wannabe nihilist for
dialog: the rest of my fucking life I'd have
dialog: stayed far away, and I sure as hell
dialog: would never have slept with you.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Oh please, we've fucked a thousand
dialog: times.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What do you mean?
text: Nyles looks to the Cops --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Can you move this along, guys?
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Answer me.
text: Nyles looks at her with a cold stare --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I lied. Yes, we've hooked up. So
dialog: many times. All I had to do was
dialog: bail you out with that ridiculous
dialog: speech at the wedding. That easy.
dialog: And it was always nice because I
dialog: never had to deal with it the next
dialog: day. But now I do.
text: They stare at each other for a moment, letting it all sink
text: in. Sarah’s lip begins to quiver, but she fights it back.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I’m an awful person, whatever, but
dialog: you're that predictable.
text: She turns away. Nyles does the same.
speaker_heading: MISTY (PRE-LAP)
dialog: Wake up.
scene_heading: INT. NYLES’ AND MISTY’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
text: Nyles wakes up in bed. Another day. Misty moisturizes. She
text: glances at him, expecting a comment. But he offers nothing.
text: He looks at the door, waiting for Sarah's knock. Silence.
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - POOL - DAY
text: Nyles drinks on his pizza, but he can’t get comfortable. The
text: sun is too bright, the beer too warm, the pizza isn’t
text: inflated enough. Everything is off. Sarah is gone.
scene_heading: INT. CALMADA ESTATE - KITCHEN - DAY
text: Nyles pours himself a tall glass of tequila while Howard and
text: Pia chat nearby.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: She didn’t leave a note or
dialog: anything? Are you sure she didn’t
dialog: text back?
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: PIA
dialog: Check my phone if you don’t believe
dialog: me. Sarah realized the day wasn’t
dialog: about her so she left.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Don’t say that.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: No, Pia’s right.
text: Howard and Pia look over at him. Who is this guy? Nyles downs
text: his tequila and walks off with the bottle.
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - BACKYARD - NIGHT
text: Nyles lies on a hay bale, drinking by himself, watching the
text: wedding reception unfold, Misty and Trevor flirting by the
text: bar. He shifts his gaze up to the sky, to the stars.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HILLSIDE - NIGHT
text: Nyles stands before the cave. He turns around and scans the
text: desert, one final check. He downs a bottle of wine, shatters
text: it against a rock, then walks into the cave.
speaker_heading: MISTY (PRE-LAP)
dialog: Wake up.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CALMADA ESTATE - HALLWAY - MORNING
text: Nyles wanders down the hall in his underwear, passing people
text: setting up for the wedding. He stops in the living room when
text: he sees Pia putting up photos of Tala and Abe.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Pia, what room is Sarah staying in?
text: Pia turns, she doesn’t recognize this odd man.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Misty’s boyfriend, come on.
speaker_heading: PIA
dialog: (playing it off)
dialog: Oh. Yeah, of course. Her room is
text: the second to last down the hall.
dialog: (as Nyles turns)
text: But she isn’t there.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: PIA
dialog: No one knows, we haven’t seen her
dialog: since last night. Howard went to
dialog: wake her up this morning but she
dialog: wasn’t in there.
text: Nyles walks down the hall, second to last room, and opens --
text: It’s empty. The bed perfectly made, untouched.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: What the fuck?
text: He walks back to the living room. Howard, The Officiant, and
dialog: Randy are all there now...
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Did anyone actually see her stay in
dialog: there last night?
text: Pia cocks her head. The others are just as confused.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: She wakes me up every day, so she
text: has to be somewhere. She has to be.
text: Nyles looks out the front window for Sarah’s car. It’s gone.
text: Misty steps out, still in her towel, worried that her
dialog: boyfriend might be having a breakdown.
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: What are you doing, Nyles?
text: Nyles stares back at the onlookers. Maybe he’s lost his mind.
scene_heading: INT. CALMADA ESTATE - GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Nyles zones out on the bed amidst an intimate cocaine party
text: with Randy, The Officiant, and Jerry. An alt-country record
text: plays. The Officiant cuts the coke on the mirrored coffee
dialog: table and rambles about the record:
speaker_heading: THE OFFICIANT
speaker_heading: Frederick Dougless, spelled L-E-S-S
text: instead of L-A-S-S like the slave.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: But he’s white?
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: THE OFFICIANT
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: That seems fucked up.
speaker_heading: THE OFFICIANT
dialog: No, man, it’s a commentary. He’s
text: the second coming of Gram Parsons.
dialog: Abe enters --
scene_heading: RANDY THE OFFICIANT
dialog: Ayyy! Married man! There’s the fuckin’ guy!
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Mind if I partake? Need a breather.
text: Abe snorts a line off the coffee table. He notices Nyles --
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Misty’s boyfriend, right? Maybe
dialog: don't mention this to her, cuz
dialog: it’ll be a thing.
text: Nyles zips his lips shut, locks them, and throws the key. We
text: frequently cut back to Nyles as the coke babble accelerates:
speaker_heading: THE OFFICIANT
dialog: (to Abe)
dialog: Remember when Frederick Dougless
dialog: opened for me at the Bootleg.
text: The Officiant does a line.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: The next Gram Parsons.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Who is this Gram Parsons?
text: Abe, Randy, and the Officiant all look over, judging him.
text: Nyles lies back, his head on the pillow, staring up.
speaker_heading: THE OFFICIANT
dialog: Flying Burrito Brothers? The Byrds?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I’m from Sudan, dude.
dialog: (off their looks)
dialog: Of course I know the fucking Byrds.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: THE OFFICIANT
dialog: Well, Gram Parsons was in The Byrds
dialog: for their best record --
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: -- Sweetheart of the Rodeo.
speaker_heading: THE OFFICIANT
dialog: And then he moved out here, did a
dialog: ton of drugs with Keith Richards,
dialog: wrote his solo albums --
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: -- GP and Grievous Angel.
speaker_heading: THE OFFICIANT
dialog: Then he OD‘d, but he practically
dialog: drank himself to death by then.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: The dude just couldn’t hang.
text: Abe snorts another line.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I don’t really like country music.
text: The three guys hang their heads and groan in disappointment.
text: Nyles turns to his side, his face sinks into the silk pillow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: (to Nyles, re: coke)
dialog: Misty’s boyfriend, you in?
text: Nyles doesn’t move... his face changes... something about
text: this pillow. He inhales and recognizes the scent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Whatever.
text: Abe does another line, then heads for the door --
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Feel free to join the party --
text: Abe exits. Nyles takes another breath into the pillow -- then
text: sits up with some pep. His detective hat is on.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Is it just you two staying in this
dialog: room?
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: THE OFFICIANT
dialog: Yeah...
text: Nyles’ suspicious stare bounces between the two guys.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: You okay, dude?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Were you both here last night, too?
speaker_heading: THE OFFICIANT
dialog: Nah, Tala is all serious about the
dialog: whole no-sleeping-together-before-
dialog: the-wedding thing, so Abe took it.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Abe slept here last night?
speaker_heading: THE OFFICIANT
dialog: Yeah... What’s up?
text: Nyles grabs the pillow and heads outside --
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - BACKYARD - NIGHT
text: Nyles races to the dance floor as Abe sits down next to Tala.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Abraham, you slick fuck! I get it!
text: Abe turns, confused.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You and Sarah. It all makes sense!
text: Abe’s stomach sinks. Other guests turn to watch...
speaker_heading: TALA
dialog: (to Abe)
dialog: What’s he talking about?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Your sister and Abraham were boning
dialog: each other. She spent last night in
dialog: his room, that’s why no one could
text: find her. She wakes up with him
text: everyday and probably sneaks out in
dialog: the morning. No wonder she hates
dialog: herself.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: NYLES (CONT'D)
dialog: (then)
dialog: Here, smell this. From Abe’s bed.
text: Nyles tosses Tala the pillow. She holds it, piecing things
text: together in her head...
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Shut up, you’re drunk.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: No, you shut up. How did no one
dialog: notice this before?
dialog: (then)
dialog: I mean, it took me a long time. A
dialog: really long time. Jesus... How did
dialog: I miss this?
text: Nyles pauses for a moment of self-reflection. He shakes it
text: off just as a pissed-off Misty steps in --
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Shut up and go fuck Trevor.
text: Misty’s jaw drops. Tala focuses her attention on --
speaker_heading: TALA
dialog: Abe. That isn’t true, is it?
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Of course not. This guy’s been
dialog: drunk all day.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: That may be accurate, nevertheless --
dialog: (to Tala)
dialog: If you smell the pillow, you will
dialog: recognize the distinct scent of
dialog: Viktor and Rolf Flowerbomb, the hair
dialog: mist you gave Sarah on her birthday.
text: Quizzical looks all around. Why, and how, would he know this?
text: Tala slowly brings the pillow to her nose. It’s Viktor and
dialog: Rolf Flowerbomb alright.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: (to the crowd)
dialog: Is there anyone else here who uses
dialog: Viktor and Rolf Flowerbomb?
text: The crowd is silent. Tala’s face sinks with the realization.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: (to Abe)
dialog: Never underestimate the scent of a
dialog: woman.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Get the fuck out of here.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (off Tala’s realization)
dialog: Abe, let’s take a walk.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: You don’t actually believe this guy?
text: Abe looks at all the faces judging him. Tala, Howard, Pia,
text: the Schlieffens, Trevor, Erin -- all stare at Abe in shock.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Come on. Guys, really. That’s not
dialog: me.
text: But Tala knows it is. It makes sense to her. Time for him to
text: leave. Abe begins to walk away... but Nyles won’t let it go --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You sad, pathetic fool.
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: Nyles.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: (to Abe)
dialog: You cheated on your fiancé, at your
dialog: wedding, with her sister...
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: Stop it, Nyles.
text: Nyles turns to Tala. Her world is falling apart.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: And fuck, Sarah, doing that to you?
dialog: Even I wouldn’t stoop that low.
dialog: (turns to the guests)
dialog: And all of you --
text: ABE TACKLES NYLES. A FIGHT BREAKS OUT BETWEEN THE TWO.
text: Nyles and Abe sloppily wrestle on the dance floor, Nyles on
text: the losing end. Nyles manages to get up, then TACKLES Abe
text: into a table -- place settings and succulents go flying.
text: FACE SLAPS, BITING, KNEES TO THE GUT, SPITTING -——
dialog: 83.
text: Pinned down, Nyles spots a FORK and reaches for it... His
text: fingers are almost on it... And he gets it --
text: And STABS ABE IN THE CHEEK WITH THE FORK.
scene_heading: HORRIFIC SCREAMS ALL AROUND --
text: Abe gets up in a state of shock. Fork stuck in his face. He
text: pulls it out, stares at it. Blood drains from his cheek.
text: Nyles even seems stunned.
text: Abe STABS NYLES IN THE EYE WITH THE FORK. EVERYBODY SCREAMS --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ABE'S SMILING FACE, unscathed, as he goes to kiss Tala --
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - BACKYARD - THE NEXT NIGHT
text: Everything is back to normal. No mess, no blood, no horror.
text: Nyles slouches in his chair at another table, bearing the
text: heavy reality of his world. He refills his glass of wine,
text: spilling over the brim onto the white table cloth.
text: Jerry watches him, concerned.
text: DANCE FLOOR: The Officiant takes the mic.
speaker_heading: THE OFFICIANT
dialog: I'd like to invite the mother of
text: the bride up for a little surprise.
text: Pia and her two sisters walk out. Pia takes a breath to
text: compose herself. One of her sisters rubs her back, smiling.
text: Tala gives Abe a look: What’s she doing? Abe shrugs.
speaker_heading: PIA
dialog: Tala. You know that I’m not great
dialog: with words. But I do love you more
dialog: than anything.
speaker_heading: TALA
dialog: Love you too, Mom!
text: Nyles watches with dead eyes, nursing his wine.
speaker_heading: PIA
dialog: And Abe, the beautiful bridegroom,
dialog: you are now my son.
dialog: 84.
text: Tala kisses him. Nyles gives a loose wrist clap.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Great man, great man!
text: Abe notices, but shrugs it off.
speaker_heading: PIA
dialog: When I was a little girl, me and my
dialog: sisters found beauty in music. It’s
dialog: how we communicated and bonded.
text: Abe rubs Tala’s back. Tala smiles wistfully, missing Sarah.
text: Nyles watches this and drinks more.
speaker_heading: PIA
dialog: So we’re going to perform a song we
dialog: learned as little girls. It’s a
dialog: song I want you two to remember
dialog: when you run into hard times. Love
dialog: can get you through anything. This
dialog: is “A Lover’s Concerto.”
text: The Officiant presses play on the laptop, cueing “A Lover’s
text: Concerto” by The Toys. Pia TRANSFORMS into a whole new
text: person, a true performer, hamming it up with PURE JOY --
speaker_heading: PIA
dialog: How gentle is the rain that falls
text: softly on the meadow...
text: Tala’s hands cover her grin, tears welling up.
text: Nyles’ breathing gets heavier. He downs the rest of his wine.
speaker_heading: PIA
dialog: «+. Some magic from above made this
dialog: day for us just to fall in love...
text: Pia and her sisters do a little choreographed step-and-shimmy
text: as they sing back ups. The guests all CHEER.
text: Nyles stares off, lost in a thought or memory. And he begins
text: to cry. Some guests notice.
speaker_heading: PIA
dialog: .«.. Oh, don't ever make me cry
dialog: through long lonely nights without
dialog: us. Be always true to me, keep this
dialog: day in your heart eternally...
text: Tala grabs Abe’s hand and pulls him up to dance.
dialog: 85.
text: As the INSTRUMENTAL BREAK in the song hits, the sound of a
text: grown man’s GUTTURAL MOANS spread. Heads turn to the source:
text: Nyles is a bawling, blubbering mess. It’s truly an ugly cry.
text: The backing track of the song continues on, but Pia and her
text: sisters stop singing, joining everyone as they just watch
text: Nyles in bewilderment. At a loss, Tala and Abe look over to --
text: Misty, by the bar with Trevor, shaking her head, embarrassed.
text: Finally, Jerry puts his hand on Nyles’ shoulder, bends down
text: and whispers into his ear. Nyles nods and rises. Jerry puts
text: his arm around Nyles and leads him away.
scene_heading: INT. NYLES AND MISTY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Nyles and Jerry sit on the bed. Nyles is hunched over, head
text: in his hands, but he’s done crying. Jerry rubs his back.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: It's okay, my friend.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: It’s painful. I don’t get it.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: What is painful?
text: Nyles turns to Jerry, snot dripping from his nose, blood shot
text: eyes, and asks with full sincerity:
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Do you want to fuck me? I’1l let
dialog: you do it.
text: Jerry smiles.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Not right now, but I appreciate the
dialog: offer.
text: Nyles pats Jerry on the leg, then continues hanging his head.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I miss her, Jerry.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Sarah.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Harris?
text: Nyles nods, still buried in his hands.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I didn’t know you knew her. We all
dialog: wish she could’ve been here.
text: Nyles shakes his head.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I love her.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Oh. I see. That’s interesting.
text: Off this image of a kind dude consoling a heartbroken man...
speaker_heading: MISTY (PRE-LAP)
dialog: Wake up.
scene_heading: INT. NYLES’ AND MISTY’S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Nyles wakes up in bed. Another day. Misty moisturizes.
scene_heading: Nyles GROOOOOANNNS --
scene_heading: I./E. PRIUS / DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY
text: Nyles drives down the road with a look of defeat on his face.
scene_heading: I./E. PRIUS / 91-FREEWAY - SUNSET
text: The Prius blends in with the weekend traffic in Orange
text: County, side-by-side with hundreds of dead-eyed drivers.
scene_heading: EXT. IRVINE SUBURB - NIGHT
text: Identical tract homes. Nyles parks the Prius by the curb in
text: front of one. He checks the number: 742. He checks the
dialog: address on the GPS: 742 Woodflower St, Irvine.
text: He gets out of the car and stands on the front lawn.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: ROY! I’m turning myself in! Torture
dialog: me, fuck me, I don’t care!
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: NYLES (CONT'D)
dialog: I've felt it all and there’s
dialog: nothing left but this pit of
dialog: sorrow! You were right, it’s dark
dialog: down here!
text: He lies on his back, sprawled on the crisp grass. Some
text: NEIGHBORS pop their heads out.
text: The front door opens. Roy hurries out to him.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (harsh whisper)
dialog: What are you doing here?!
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I surrender. You win.
text: Roy helps Nyles up, smiling at his neighbors as he does.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Everything's okay, nothing to see.
dialog: My brother-in-law, PTSD, Fallujah,
dialog: 9/11. Real war hero.
dialog: (quietly to Nyles)
dialog: I’m not letting you ruin family
dialog: day, so keep your mouth shut.
text: Roy drags Nyles into his house.
scene_heading: INT. ROY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Pleasant, portrait of Jesus. TWINS (boy and girl, 6) on
text: tricycles. A TEEN watches TV. Not what Nyles expected.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You can’t be here.
speaker_heading: WOMAN’S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Who was that man?!
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Goddammit.
text: JAMIE (45), Roy’s wife, appears at the top of the stairs ina

speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Oh, hi, sorry, just got out of the
dialog: shower.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Hey, sorry hon’, this is ...
dialog: 88.
text: It just now dawns on Roy that he doesn’t know Nyles’ name.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Nyles.
speaker_heading: ROY
text: Nyles is an old friend.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: We’re not friends, we’re enemies.
dialog: (to Jamie)
dialog: You married this piece of shit?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: He’s a ball buster, hon’. Nyles just
dialog: stopped by to say hi. Tuna will be
dialog: ready soon. We’ll be out back.
text: Roy pulls Nyles away.
scene_heading: EXT. ROY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT
text: Nyles blankly takes in Roy’s yard. Idyllic suburbia. Pool,
text: Golden Retriever, BBQ and a smoker. A twin BOY (6) waters the
text: grass with a hose. His twin SISTER calls out from a swing set.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Push me!
text: Feeling powerless at the moment, Nyles pushes the girl on the
text: swing. Roy walks up with beers, slightly calmer now.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (re: his twins)
dialog: Can you believe I made these? If I
dialog: had one less Mai Tai that night I'd
dialog: have put the rubber on right and
dialog: they wouldn’t be here.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Here’s to Mai Tais.
text: Roy sips his beer, watching his kids with fatherly pride. He

speaker_heading: NYLES

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Not bad, huh? Beautiful wife, three

speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: ROY (CONT'D)

text: in middle of the grass, and continues watering it.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: What about marriage being a
dialog: “bottomless pit of sorrow?”
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Shit, man, I’m not without my

dialog: So what are you doing here? You
dialog: have two minutes to drink that beer
dialog: before I slit your throat and throw
dialog: you in the smoker.
dialog: (off Nyles’ look)
dialog: I’m kidding. This is a PG house.
dialog: Get on with it though. You’re
dialog: scaring my wife.
text: Nyles notices Jamie watching him through the blinds from the
text: second floor bedroom window. She shuts the blinds.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I haven't seen you in a while.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Yeah, no shit. A bunch of rock
dialog: climbers found me on the road that
dialog: day and brought me to the hospital.
dialog: Nurses wouldn’t let me sleep
dialog: because they thought I'd fall into
text: a coma. Died a slow, painful death.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: There’s nothing worse than dying
text: slowly in the ICU.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Alzheimer’s. Way worse. Runs in my
dialog: family. At least I don’t have to
dialog: deal with that.
text: Roy sips on his beer, suppressing some memory.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I had a lot of anger for you, man.
dialog: I’m never gonna see my kids grow
dialog: up, I’m never gonna walk Madison
dialog: down the aisle. But you wouldn’t
dialog: know shit about that, would you?
text: Roy glares at Nyles, then takes a more enlightened approach.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I admit, my head may have been up
dialog: my own ass, I might not have fully
dialog: grasped what I put you through, but
dialog: that little hospital stint opened
dialog: my eyes. Today was always a good
text: day here. Matty tending his dog
dialog: shit, Jamie in the prime of her
dialog: womanhood at forty-five. Madison's
dialog: gonna draw a family portrait later
dialog: where we’re all animals. I’ma
dialog: goddamn grizzly. I don’t have to
dialog: watch my family grow up to hate me.
dialog: Can't beat that.
text: Roy glances over at Nyles, sensing that the dude is a lost
dialog: soul at the moment.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You gotta find your Irvine.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I don’t have an Irvine.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: We all have an Irvine.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Who was that looney bitch that
dialog: blindsided me, anyway?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: Don’t call her that.
text: Roy shakes his head at Nyles while drinking his beer.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You brought her to the cave, didn’t
dialog: you? Goddamn, didn’t you learn
dialog: anything?
text: Nyles stares ahead, still pushing Madison.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: She followed me in.
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Hey. At least you have each other.
dialog: Can’t imagine anything worse than
dialog: going through this shit alone.
text: Nyles stops pushing, hit with the reality that they don’t
dialog: have each other anymore... He does have to go through this
dialog: shit alone.
text: Madison looks back at Nyles.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Okay, you gotta go now.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Can I stay for dinner?
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: It’s probably best if we don’t see
dialog: each other again.
dialog: (then)
dialog: It’s not you, it’s me.
text: A moment as Nyles absorbs this. Even Roy is done with Nyles.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Kill me?
text: Roy takes him in -- this defeated shell of a man.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: The traffic.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Side yard.
dialog: (to Madison)
dialog: Daddy’1l be right back, honey.
scene_heading: EXT. ROY’S HOUSE - SIDE YARD - MOMENTS LATER
text: Roy leads Nyles to the side yard and shuts the gate behind
text: them so that they’re out of view from the kids.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: K, uh... Get in the recycle bin.
text: Roy unlocks a storage bin and pulls out the HUNTING BOW.
text: Nyles climbs into the empty recycle bin and faces Roy.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You actually own that?
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: It’s my eldest’s. Caught him
dialog: hunting cats. At least I don’t have
dialog: to see him grow up to be a serial
dialog: killer.
text: Roy cocks the arrow into place -- AIMS at Nyles’ HEAD...
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I hope you find it, man.
text: Then AIMS at Nyles’ HEART -- and FIRES --
text: Nyles collapses into the bin -- the lid shuts closed.
text: We HOLD ON the recycle bin for a few more seconds as Roy
text: leaves the side yard...
text: TILT UP to the NIGHT SKY --
text: All the stars, all the constellations -- and BACK DOWN to:
scene_heading: EXT. CASINO - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Where Nyles and Sarah sit handcuffed on the curb as the
text: Grumpy Man gives his statement to the Cop. Back to the last
text: time Nyles and Sarah saw each other.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I’m an awful person, whatever, but
dialog: you're that predictable.
text: She turns away. Nyles does the same.
text: The Cop finishes taking the Grumpy Man’s statement and heads
text: to Nyles and Sarah. Just before he reaches them --
text: Sarah turns back to Nyles, determination in her eyes:
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I’m getting the fuck out of here.
dialog: Nyles doesn’t understand...
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: Okay, up we go --
text: The Cop helps Nyles up, and as his back is turned, Sarah,
text: hands still cuffed behind her back, manages to grab his GUN --
speaker_heading: COP 1 COP 2
dialog: Whoa whoa whoa! Drop the weapon!
dialog: 93.
text: Sarah starts FIRING at NYLES, everybody SCATTERS --
text: But the Grumpy Man, Mr. Hot Dog Man himself, is fearless. He
text: pulls out a .44 MAGNUM, aims it at Sarah -- BANG!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CALMADA ESTATE - GUEST HOUSE - MORNING
text: Sarah shoots awake, sits up, fucking done with this day.
text: She goes straight to the BATHROOM --
text: She flings open the steamed shower door to find Abe --
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Hey you.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No. This is done. This never
dialog: should've happened. We both deserve
dialog: every awful thing that’s coming to
dialog: us because we are shitty people.
dialog: But I’m done being shitty.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Uhh, okay. You’re not going to tell
dialog: Tala though, right?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I already fucking told her and it
dialog: doesn’t make a difference.
text: And with that Sarah SLAMS the shower door, cracking it.
scene_heading: INT. SARAH'S CAR - MOVING / HIGHWAY
text: PUSH IN on Sarah behind the wheel, a woman on a mission.
scene_heading: EXT. PALM SPRINGS PUBLIC LIBRARY - MORNING
text: Sarah’s car screeches into the EMPTY parking lot.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Sarah paces back and forth at the ENTRANCE, waiting for the
text: library to open. BEHIND HER we see the LIBRARIAN (40s)
text: inside, unlocking the glass doors and opening them.
speaker_heading: LIBRARIAN
dialog: off to an early start --
dialog: 94,
text: Sarah slips right by and we follow her INSIDE --
scene_heading: INT. PALM SPRINGS PUBLIC LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Science. I need the science section.
speaker_heading: LIBRARIAN
dialog: What type of science?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Time loops? Time travel?
speaker_heading: LIBRARIAN
dialog: Try aisle six...
text: The Librarian follows slowly behind Sarah --
text: Sarah turns down aisle six, scans titles: Quantum Mechanics,
text: In Search of Schrédinger’s Cat, The Infinity Puzzle...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIBRARIAN
dialog: What are you looking for exactly? I
dialog: can help narrow it down...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I walked into a cave that sucked me
text: into some type of hellish wormhole
dialog: and now I’ve been stuck living the
dialog: same day over and over again and I
dialog: need to find a way out.
text: The Librarian gives her a blank stare.
speaker_heading: LIBRARIAN
dialog: Maybe try the Internet?
text: Sarah stops. Looks over. That’s it.
scene_heading: INT. COMPUTER LAB - MOMENTS LATER
text: From behind the computer, ANGLE ON Sarah as she sits before
text: this machine which may hold all the answers. As she gets to
text: work typing we slowly PUSH IN on her face --
text: TIME SPEEDS UP BEHIND HER -- library guests pass by in a blur
text: -- but Sarah never moves, her eyes just rapidly scanning
text: every page she reads, absorbing every video she watches --
text: -- FLASH TO diagrams of WORMHOLES, BLACK HOLES, EQUATIONS,
scene_heading: COSMOLOGICAL DIAGRAMS --—
dialog: 95.
text: -- FLASH TO various entries typed into GOOGLE: cosmology,
dialog: Magnetic vortex, quantum suicide, parallel universes --
text: PUSHING IN on Sarah, her face fills the frame, pupils shrink --
text: -- FLASH TO Sarah waking up -- she hops out of bed -- Her CAR
text: speeds away in a dust cloud -- OVER and OVER again --
text: -- FLASH TO a Stephen Hawking TED Talk -- Sarah furiously
dialog: takes notes --
text: -- Sarah's eyes grow heavy as she watches a dated TV special
text: on time travel... until she falls asleep at the computer --
text: -- Sarah WAKES UP -- back at the guest house -- FUCK -- and
text: jumps out of bed -- Her car speeds away --
text: PUSHING IN on Sarah’s face -- on her EYE --
text: -- As Howard assembles the ALTAR, Sarah swipes a TAPE MEASURE
text: from Howard’s tool box and walks off, but STOPS when --
speaker_heading: NYLES (0.C.)
dialog: Sarah! I see your car! I know
dialog: you're here!
text: She hides up against a wall as Nyles passes by, then runs off.
text: -- Sarah exits a Superstore carrying a bunch of TOOLS and
text: CHEMICALS. The same young BOY selling candy from before
text: approaches. She ignores him. Then stops. Goes back and gives
text: him a 100 DOLLAR BILL.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (Subtitled Spanish)
dialog: Make sure you spend it all today.
text: -- FLASH TO Sarah at the mouth of the CAVE, measuring it,
text: pacing back and forth, pouring weird chemicals in the dirt.
text: She strides in, staring at a stopwatch, the ORANGE ORB
text: engulfs her into a BLACK VOID --
text: We PULL OUT from Sarah’s PUPIL -- she rubs her weary eyes as
text: she SKYPES with a PROFESSOR:
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: -+. we're kind of circling
dialog: determinism, so there’s really only
dialog: one possible future given the laws
dialog: of our universe --
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: -- BUT. Wait. You’re wrong. Hintz
dialog: argued that a Reissner-Nordstrom-de
dialog: Sitter black hole would allow an
dialog: observer access to the
dialog: indeterministic universe on the
text: other side of the Cauchy horizon.
text: The Professor stares back.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Okay. Sounds like you don’t need my
dialog: help. Take care --
text: The Professor signs off.
text: -- FLASH TO Sarah, face-to-face with SPUDS’ GOAT. She pets it
text: endearingly, apologetically, then walks her INTO the cave. WE
text: SEE the ORANGE FLASH and hear the goat bleat.
text: -- FLASH TO Sarah leaning over the fence at Spuds’ GOAT PEN,
text: weighing something as she looks at the goat, who stares back.
text: -- Sarah, outside the cave, straps a PACK FULL OF C4 onto the
text: same goat’s back. She walks the goat into the cave, out of
text: view... but after a moment Sarah RUNS OUT -- without the goat
text: -- takes cover behind a boulder, detonator in hand -- and
scene_heading: CLICK -- AN EXPLOSION IN THE CAVE --
text: -- FLASH TO a VIDEO depicting a theoretical journey through
text: the UNIVERSE, through a WORMHOLE -- leading us to:
text: BLACKNESS, NOTHINGNESS -- except for a SINGLE, DISTANT STAR...
text: ... THE STAR EXPLODES, filling a PERFECTLY CLEAR NIGHT SKY --
text: Now we're BACK TO the starting ANGLE -- behind the computer.
text: Sarah stops reading, stops typing, and sits back in her chair.
text: She looks to The Librarian, cataloguing books at the counter.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I think I got it.
text: The Librarian smiles politely, then goes back to her work.
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - BACKYARD - THAT MOMENT
text: Nyles, dejected and back in the lounge chair, stares at the
text: pool. Pure misery and emptiness. The guy just can’t move on.
speaker_heading: SARAH (0.S.)
dialog: Still here, huh?
dialog: 97.
text: Nyles turns his head to see Sarah approaching -- and falls out
text: of his chair. He blinks to be sure he isn’t hallucinating.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Hey! You’re here.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Wow, you look great.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah. Well I can’t age.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Right.
text: It’s awkward... She looks down at him, still on the ground.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: So, how you been?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Bad.
dialog: (stands up)
dialog: I mean, yeah bad, look, can I just
dialog: say something... I am SO sorry, for
dialog: everything, for lying, for not
dialog: telling you about our “previous
dialog: encounters.” All of it, it was not
dialog: cool. And I don’t blame you for
dialog: being mad at me. But, I’ve been
dialog: thinking about it, we had a really
dialog: good thing going before I screwed
dialog: it up. So, do you think we could
dialog: just start over? I feel like we owe
dialog: that to ourselves.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Are you done?
text: Nyles thinks for a moment. Am I done?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Good. I think I found a way out.
dialog: off Nyles --
dialog: 98.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDAL SUITE BATHROOM - DAY
text: TIGHT ON Sarah as she explains her theory to Nyles.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: «+. all lying entirely within a
dialog: Cauchy horizon, and though the
dialog: chronology protection hypothesis
dialog: and quantum fluctuations
dialog: theoretically don’t allow for
dialog: traveling back in time, it really
dialog: comes down to nature always
dialog: inhibiting us. So, the general
dialog: consensus is eradicate the energy
dialog: source and all should reset.
text: She looks at Nyles, preoccupied and clearly not following.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Nature prevents time travel. The
dialog: earthquake broke nature.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: (unconvincing)
dialog: Right. I hear that.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No, listen, this is serious.
text: Sarah leans forward and grabs her PURSE from the vanity --
speaker_heading: ERIN (0.S.)
dialog: Please, don’t move --
text: WIDE TO REVEAL: Erin, thoroughly annoyed as she tries to do
text: Sarah's hair for the wedding.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I don’t know what you’re talking
dialog: about, but we only have half an
dialog: hour until photos and I still need
dialog: to get ready.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Then get ready. I'll finish up.
text: Erin puts her hands up, glad to be done, and leaves.
text: Sarah takes out LIPSTICK and draws a DIAGRAM on the mirror,
dialog: starting with a LONG TUBE --
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: This is the cave. It’s also life,
dialog: birth and death, our consciousness,
dialog: the timeline we all live on, but
dialog: it’s simpler to think of it solely
dialog: as the cave. We enter here --
text: She circles the left entry --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: -- and what’s supposed to happen in
dialog: life is we just walk through this
text: tube to the other end, continuing on
dialog: this regular timeline. But, much
dialog: like an earthquake can break pipes
dialog: underground, it broke our pipe.
text: She circles a section of the tube --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: This is the part where it all turns
dialog: orange, where we’re sucked in. For
dialog: exactly 3.2 seconds we lose control
dialog: of our bodies, and what’s happening
dialog: is we’re being sucked down into this
dialog: fissure caused by the earthquake,
dialog: back to the moment we wake up.
text: Sarah draws a line down from the fissure, back to the start.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: (trying to follow)
dialog: Okay... I really missed you.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Nyles, focus. It’s really not that
dialog: hard to understand. Here --
dialog: (circling the fissure again)
dialog: This is a highly concentrated
dialog: energy source. Remember, you said
dialog: it yourself. Energy Is Everything.
text: We're trapped in a box of energy.
text: Sarah draws a BOX around the entire graphic.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That's all this day is. A box of
dialog: energy.
dialog: (pointing to the fissure)
dialog: We destroy the energy source in
dialog: that 3.2 second window, we break
dialog: the box. At least I think.
text: Sarah goes back to applying her make-up, pleased with herself.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: And then what, there’s like more
dialog: boxes outside the box?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I don’t know, maybe we wake up and
dialog: it’s today, maybe it’s twenty years
dialog: from now, or we're dead under a
dialog: pile of rocks. I can’t be sure of
dialog: any of it, that’s why it’s a
dialog: theory. But we have to try.
text: Sarah’s making somewhat of a convincing argument, but Nyles
text: remains skeptical.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Okay. And by “break the box,” you
dialog: mean...?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: We blow up ourselves and the cave
dialog: in that 3.2 second window. Then
dialog: we're out.
text: Sarah moves onto her mascara, so confident in her plan.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I dunno, I mean, we've killed
dialog: ourselves so many times already and
dialog: we're still here, in “this box,”
dialog: right? I mean, I don’t wanna shit
dialog: on your idea, you've clearly spent
dialog: a lot of time learning all about
dialog: this stuff --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Well, technically, I’ve spent no
dialog: time on it, since this isn’t real
dialog: time, it’s all time spent outside
dialog: of time, but go on.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I just think you might be setting
dialog: yourself up for disappointment
dialog: again. Remember your karma
dialog: experiment?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: This is different.
text: She puts down her mascara and looks him in the eyes.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I tested it.
dialog: 101.
text: Sarah moves into the BEDROOM and starts changing into her
text: DRESS. Nyles is stuck on her last line though...
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: How did you test it?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I tried it with Spuds’ goat. I sent
dialog: her into the cave, blew her up,
dialog: and... she’s gone. I don’t know
dialog: where she went, but she isn’t here
dialog: anymore.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Zip me up.
text: Nyles zips her dress, still unsure...
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: The goat’s gone?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah. Crazy, right? So, get through
dialog: today, don’t do anything too crazy,
dialog: and tonight, meet me at the cave so
dialog: we can peace the fuck out of this
dialog: shithole.
text: Sarah checks her dress in the armoire mirror. Nyles sits on
text: the bed, processing. Did she actually find a way out?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You sure you don’t wanna run a few
dialog: more tests first?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What? No. What are you talking
dialog: about?
text: Sarah sits on the bed and begins lacing up on her shoes.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: The cave will still be there
dialog: tomorrow... I just don’t wanna rush
dialog: into anything, you know, in case
dialog: something actually does happen.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Rush? Nyles, we've been stuck in
dialog: here for an eternity.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Yeah, no, I know. I guess I just
dialog: really saw this conversation going
dialog: differently, y’know?
dialog: 102.
text: She looks at Nyles. The same dude she once had a fling with,
text: may have even loved, but who remains unchanged. Same wrinkled
dialog: Hawaiian shirt, same dirty swim trunks...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Holy shit. You’re scared to leave.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: No, I’m not. I just don’t WANT to
dialog: leave. There’s a difference.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What’s the difference?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I wanna stay with you.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Everything we’re doing in here is
dialog: meaningless. You know that, right?
dialog: This isn’t real.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: It’s real to me. Look...
dialog: (takes a breath)
dialog: I love you. How about that?
text: Sarah continues with her other shoe, deflecting --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You don’t love me. I’m literally
text: the only other human being stuck in
dialog: here with you.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: No, what about Roy? I don’t love
dialog: him.
dialog: Sarah looks at him: Come on.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: So, you're saying that out there,
dialog: in the real world, with millions of
dialog: choices, you'd still want to be
dialog: with me?
text: Nyles hesitates for a second too long... Sarah clocks it.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Yeah. Absolutely.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Bullshit. You can’t possibly know
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Well, would you want to be with me?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Fuck no.
text: Sarah heads back into the bathroom --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Right, see, we “can’t possibly know
dialog: that.” Your words. But what I DO
dialog: know is that we’re good together,
dialog: here, in this world.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You've lost your mind.
dialog: Nyles stands --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: That’s what love’s all about! Sane
dialog: people don’t fall in love, don’t be
dialog: so afraid of it. I’m not going to
dialog: fuck you over. And if you get mad
dialog: at me again, just take a few years
dialog: off and then come back. We’ll still
dialog: have our youth.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I want my life back, Nyles!
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Why? It’s not like things were
dialog: working out so great for us out
dialog: there. I mean, I know you’re
dialog: screwing Abe, so if your plan works
dialog: you'll have to deal with that whole
dialog: mess.
text: The color drains from Sarah’s face.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: How do you know about that?
text: He sighs.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Viktor and Rolf Flowerbomb.
text: She is livid, ashamed, as she packs her purse --
dialog: 103.
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: But it doesn’t matter. I don’t
dialog: judge you for the past, that’s kind
dialog: of my whole thing.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Wow, YOU don’t judge ME? That’s rich
dialog: coming from the guy who lied about
dialog: us fucking “thousands of times.”
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I said I was sorry!
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah, well apology not accepted.
dialog: Good talk, Nyles. Don’t come with
dialog: me, I don’t care.
text: She turns to leave -- but he’s in the way.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Can you move? If this is my last
dialog: day, I’m not wasting it with you.
text: Nyles stares back, he wants her to stay... but she won’t back
text: down. He steps aside and she leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - FRONT - DAY
text: Nyles wanders out the front door in a daze. He stops and
text: stares up at the sun, like he’s trying to blind himself...
scene_heading: EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY
text: Nyles trudges down the dirt road, AWAY from the estate, as
text: guests drive toward the wedding.
text: He passes the sign for “Tala & Abe’s Wedding - November 9.”
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - DAY
text: Sarah, all dressed for the wedding, straight-faced as the
text: PHOTOGRAPHER positions the family members around Tala and Abe
text: in front of a cactus. Sarah forces a smile for the photo.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY
text: Nyles walks in the middle of the road, head hanging, looking
text: pathetic. A passing CAR blares its horn. Nyles doesn’t react.
dialog: 105.
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - WEDDING CEREMONY AREA - SUNSET
text: MOS: Tala and Abe share their vows as family tears up. Sarah
text: smiles, standing by Tala in full support. She glances out at
text: the audience -- everyone falls for the love on display.
scene_heading: EXT. DIRT ROAD - SUNSET
text: Nyles turns up another dirt road, the sun descends below the
text: mountains behind him -- and THE EARTHQUAKE HITS.
text: Nyles pauses for a moment. A thought crosses him, he looks
text: west: The cave is open. Maybe Sarah’s heading in.
text: He sighs, then keeps walking forth into the darkness.
speaker_heading: MISTY (PRE-LAP)
dialog: And Commitment is “the state or
dialog: quality of being dedicated to a
dialog: cause, activity, etcetera.”
scene_heading: EXT. CALMADA ESTATE - BACKYARD - NIGHT
text: Misty looks out at the silent guests.
speaker_heading: TALA
dialog: Woo-hoo!
text: Tala and Abe stand and clap. Everyone else joins in applause.
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: Without further ado, let me bring
dialog: up the maid of honor, the actual
dialog: big sister of the bride, Sarah.
text: All eyes land on Sarah, seated across from Tala. She takes a
text: breath... and heads onto the dance floor. She takes the mic --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Thanks Misty, that was great.
text: Sarah looks directly at Tala throughout.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Tala. My baby sister, Tala. What
dialog: can I say that hasn’t been said?
dialog: Heh... Even from this angle, I can
text: see a very faint halo of light
dialog: around your head -- hovering just
text: above those angelic cheekbones.
dialog: 106.
text: Tala’ cheekbones radiate. Sarah sighs to herself, this is
text: ridiculous... But sees Tala beaming at her... and actually
dialog: gets a little choked up. What are these feelings I’m feeling?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: This world is bizarre... things
dialog: happen, life happens, and it’s easy
dialog: to bear down and just go through
dialog: the motions day after day, after
dialog: day... But, my sweet little sis’,
dialog: you are so open to the wonder of it
dialog: all. You have this hopefulness
dialog: that’s special and rare. Every
dialog: morning you get up and you
text: confidently charge forth toward the
dialog: life you've dreamt up for yourself.
dialog: Your joy, this joyous energy, it's
dialog: contagious and it’s just...
speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
speaker_heading: SARAH AND NYLES
text: Staring at each other across the campfire --
speaker_heading: NYLES SARAH
dialog: «+. Everything. ... Everything.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: SARAH - MID SPEECH
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: .-. it’s everything.
text: Sarah pauses, struck by the warmth of this memory. She
text: swallows her vulnerability, and looks back at Tala --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Big sisters are supposed to teach
dialog: baby sisters, but I will today and
dialog: forever, and ever and ever, be
dialog: learning from you.
text: The two sisters share a blissful, teary smile.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: So, now, Abe...
text: Abe leans forward, expecting some kind words...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You fucking hurt her and I’1l stab
dialog: your little fucking dick with a
dialog: fork, I swear to god.
dialog: 107.
text: Stunned reactions from the crowd.
text: Sarah smiles, drops the mic, and walks off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROADSIDE BIKER BAR - NIGHT
text: Nyles sulks at the bar, swirling a glass of whiskey. PUSH IN
text: on that empty mug of his... Until he DROPS his face down on
dialog: the bar. As we first met him. Gram Parsons’ “Return of the
text: Grievous Angel” plays throughout.
text: Darla slides up and rubs his leg. Nyles shoots up.
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: You okay, sweetheart?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I've felt everything I'll ever feel
dialog: so I'll never feel ever again.
text: Darla looks to Ted the Bartender --
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: What’re you pouring this kid, Ted?
scene_heading: TED THE BARTENDER
dialog: That’s his first drink.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I thought I knew how to live. But I
dialog: didn’t. Or, I don’t? You know what
dialog: I mean.
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: Darlin’, take a look around: whatever
dialog: you're after, it ain’t here...
text: But now TIME SLOWS for Nyles... and _we see this moment
text: differently than before as he locks eyes with Darla --
text: He turns back to the bar, digesting this odd profundity,
text: staring into the MIRROR behind dusty liquor bottles --
text: FROM OVER NYLES’ SHOULDER, REFLECTED IN THE MIRROR, WE WATCH:
text: A giddy Nyles leading a blindfolded Sarah into her surprise
text: shindig filled with decorations and a giant ‘HAPPY MILLIONTH
text: BIRTHDAY, SARAH’ sign... that joyous tableau from their early
text: days together. He removes her blindfold --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (touched, beaming)
dialog: Have I really been here that long?
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: You’re asking the wrong guy --
text: Nyles lifts up a CONFETTI CANNON and blasts her face --
text: FROM NYLES’ POV, CLOSE UP AND DIRECT INTO SARAH’S GRIN --
text: Confetti pieces flutter around Sarah, radiant with an
text: unbridled joy we haven’t seen. She leans in and squeezes
text: Nyles in a hug, then lets go and steps back, bringing us
text: BACK TO THE BAR, IN THE PRESENT
text: ON NYLES, lost in this memory as Gram Parsons SWELLS:
dialog: “,..Twenty-thousand roads I went down, down, down, and they
dialog: all lead me straight back home to you...”
text: Darla, weirded out, looks to Ted the Bartender --
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: You sure he didn’t take something?
scene_heading: TED THE BARTENDER
text: He’s sober. Kid’s just moping there.
text: Nyles turns to them, quickly piecing together a haphazard
text: plan. He JOLTS up and defiantly shoots his whiskey,
text: shattering the glass with a glare for Ted --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I’m a fucking adult, Thaddeus.
scene_heading: TED THE BARTENDER
dialog: Talk to me like that and you'll be
dialog: pulling your teeth from the bar.
text: Nyles sizes up the barflies leering at him. He turns to Ted
text: and holds a peace sign... and rotates it into a middle finger.
text: Nyles LUNGES over the bar and latches onto Ted’s shirt as
text: some BIKERS grab Nyles’ legs -- the place erupts into CHAOS --
scene_heading: EXT. ROADSIDE BIKER BAR - NIGHT
text: We HEAR the sound of a FIGHT: SHOUTING, GLASS BREAKING --
text: The front door flies open and the two bikers hurl Nyles face
text: first onto the gravel parking lot then go back inside.
text: Nyles looks into his clenched hand: TED’S CAR KEYS.
text: Nyles pushes himself up -- with a bloody, broken nose -- and
text: RUNS to Ted’s PICK-UP truck, gets in, REVS the engine --
dialog: 109.
scene_heading: INT. SARAH'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Sarah drives her car along a rough dirt road, deeply focused --
scene_heading: INT. TED’S PICK-UP - NIGHT
text: Nyles presses down the gas -- SPEEDING DOWN THE HIGHWAY --
text: He CRACKS his nose back into place, then --
text: He hits a POTHOLE -- POP!!! -- he blows a tire --
text: -- and SKIDS TO A STOP on the shoulder.
text: Nyles jumps out of the truck, checks the tire: torn to shreds
text: and bent in on itself.
speaker_heading: NYLES
speaker_heading: FUUUUCK!
text: Nyles looks down the road -- and takes off RUNNING --
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT VALLEY - NIGHT
text: Sarah gets out of her car at the dead end of a dirt road. She
text: pops the trunk and pulls out a DUFFEL BAG, throws it over her
text: shoulder, and powers forth into the desert -- on a mission.
scene_heading: EXT. SPUDS' HOUSE - GUN RANGE - NIGHT
text: Spuds FIRES a shot at the Mustache Man target. As he nods
dialog: with pride at his perfect shot --
speaker_heading: NYLES (0.S.)
dialog: Don’t shoot, Spuds!
text: Spuds turns and aims the gun at this mysterious man running
text: out of the darkness and into the flood lights -- a lunatic
text: drenched in sweat, caked in dirt, and out of breath --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I need help! A ride... Anything...
speaker_heading: SPUDS
dialog: Who the fuck are you?
text: Spuds doesn’t flinch. Nyles plays his only card:
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Thirty years ago you met a woman
text: named Tracy Holmes at a bar in
dialog: Aberdeen, and after she popped your
text: cherry in the little boy’s room,
dialog: she left town and you never saw her
dialog: again.
text: Spuds’ hands tremble at the memory, still raw, while
text: maintaining his aim.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Spuds. I’m your son.
text: Spuds sheds a tear. He lowers his gun, totally buying Nyles’
text: story. He walks up to Nyles and pulls him in for a tight hug.
speaker_heading: SPUDS
dialog: I always had a feeling.
text: Mid hug, Nyles glances at the GOAT PEN and considers checking
dialog: to see if Sarah was telling truth, if the goat is really
text: gone. But the clock's ticking. He gets out of the hug --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I love you, Dad. But I really need
dialog: your help. The love of my life
dialog: might be leaving forever.
text: Spuds wipes his nose and looks at Nyles with fatherly eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HILLSIDE - NIGHT
text: THE CAVE. Open and ready.
text: SARAH. Calm. Resolute. She stands just beyond the mouth,
text: staring at it. She takes a deep breath and pulls on a VEST
text: LINED WITH C4. She walks toward the cave.
text: Just as she’s about to cross the threshold --
speaker_heading: NYLES (0.S.)
dialog: Wait!!! Sarah!!!
text: Sarah turns to see a DIRT BIKE weaving through the valley,
text: Spuds is driving, Nyles holds on tight to his waist.
text: Spuds skids to a stop. Nyles jumps off and runs toward Sarah.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Goddamnit. What is it, Nyles?
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I blew it again! You were right, I
dialog: was scared, but I’m not anymore!
dialog: We’re all lost, but somehow we
dialog: found each other. And yes, I’m
dialog: quoting myself, but I hope you can
dialog: look past that, because I know you
dialog: feel it, too.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You don’t know what I feel. You
dialog: don’t know me.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: But maybe I do!
dialog: (composes himself)
dialog: Sarah, from the moment I saw you --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I don’t want another one of your
dialog: fucking speeches, Nyles...
text: She looks toward the cave.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You get one more sentence.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Okay, okay, okay --
text: Nyles thinks for a moment...
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Even though I pretend not to be,
dialog: I've realized I’m completely co-
dialog: dependent, but now I’m cool with it
dialog: because life is meant to be
dialog: shared... semi-colon... I need you
dialog: for survival --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That’s your one sentence --
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: WAIT!
text: She stops.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: .»+.- I need you for survival, comma,
dialog: but this is so much more than
dialog: that... colon...
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: NYLES (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you better than anyone knows
dialog: you, and that day we saw the
dialog: dinosaurs, you said to really know a
dialog: person you have to see their entire
dialog: package, the good and the bad, well
dialog: you've see mine, and I’ve seen
dialog: yours, and you have an excellent
dialog: package. Ampersand you're my
dialog: favorite person I’ve ever met, and
dialog: yes, it seems like crazy odds that a
dialog: person I’d meet stuck in a time loop
dialog: would end up being my favorite
dialog: person, but you know what else has
dialog: crazy odds? Getting stuck in a
dialog: fucking time loop... Dot dot dot --
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: Ellipses.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Yes, ellipses, thank you. Ellipses,
dialog: I hope blowing ourselves up works,
dialog: but if it doesn’t, it’s irrelevant
dialog: for me, as long as I’m with you.
dialog: And if it kills us... well... Sarah
dialog: Isabel Harris, I'd rather die with
dialog: you than live in this world without
dialog: you, emphatic period.
text: Sarah’s speechless for a moment.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That was a grammatical nightmare.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Yeah, hopefully that didn’t
dialog: distract from my point.
text: Nyles locks eyes with her, letting his declaration of
dialog: commitment linger for as long as he needs to.
text: Sarah finally breaks the silence:
dialog: A beat...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What if we get sick of each other?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: We're already sick of each other.
dialog: It’s the best.
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I can survive just fine without
dialog: you. But there’s a chance that life
dialog: can be a little less mundane with
dialog: you in it.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Yes, less mundane. That’s a very
dialog: low bar, great place to start.
text: She cracks a smile.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Then I’1l try it for now.
text: Nyles beams. Spuds CLAPS, watching from his bike.
speaker_heading: SPUDS
dialog: And that is love.
scene_heading: INT. CAVE - MOMENTS LATER
text: From the inside looking out, Sarah and Nyles stand at the
text: mouth of the cave. Her in her C4 vest, him with a broken nose,
text: in his swim trunks and Hawaiian shirt. A perfect engagement
text: photo. They begin their walk in.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: So did that goat thing actually work
dialog: or was that bullshit?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Too late, you already committed.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Son of a bitch.
text: Sarah takes his hand.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Hey, where do you wanna go on our
dialog: first date when this for sure works?
text: The orange light BRIGHTENS on their faces.
text: They look at each other, still walking forward...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: In case I don’t see you again --
text: Sarah kisses Nyles, the ORANGE ORB SWELLS --
scene_heading: IT DWARFS THEM -- THEY LOSE CONTROL --
dialog: 114.
scene_heading: ENGULFED BY ORB --—
scene_heading: MAKING OUT -—
scene_heading: SARAH’S HAND ON THE DETONATOR -- CLICK -—-
text: ** A BURST OF WHITE LIGHT **
text: CUT TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY
dialog: Yesterday, last year, today, tomorrow... Sarah and Nyles
text: float on an extra large pizza raft in a pool, burritos in
text: hand, horchata in the pepperoni cupholders.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: There’s one thing I still really
dialog: don’t understand?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Only one thing?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: How did you find the cave in the
dialog: first place? You had to find it
dialog: that first day at the wedding, but
text: it’s like two miles from the party,
dialog: not by any roads. What were you
dialog: doing out there?
text: Nyles takes a big bite of his burrito.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Seriously. Honesty and communication
dialog: are key to a healthy relationship.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: But is there any answer that’1ll be
dialog: satisfying to you?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah, because an answer is
dialog: inherently satisfying. It satisfies
dialog: the pursuit of truth. And I like
dialog: truth. I get off on truth.
text: Nyles stares directly at Sarah.
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: But does it not run the risk of
dialog: disappointment if I tell you what
dialog: happened? By this point your mind
dialog: is made up about me, whether you
dialog: love me, hate me, or anything in
dialog: between. And if I tell you how I
dialog: found the cave, that might give you
dialog: a sense of truth, but will it be
dialog: satisfaction? Our energy should be
dialog: focused on pursuing what gives us --
text: Sarah SLURPS her horchata loudly, growing peeved.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Isn't it more exciting to live your
dialog: life always having some sense of
dialog: mystery?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No. That’s pretentious. And dumb.
text: Nyles ponders this for a moment. A small raft with the box of
text: Tecate on it floats by.
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: Yeah. I guess it is.
text: Sarah smiles. She stops the Tecate box and grabs a beer.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Beer?
speaker_heading: NYLES
dialog: I’m good. Watching my figure.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Look. A turtle.
text: Nyles points to the scarred TORTOISE walking toward them from
text: the other side of the backyard. As they gaze at it --
text: “Forever and Ever” by Demis Roussos kicks in...
text: We FLOAT UP AND AWAY from Nyles and Sarah... And as we get
text: farther away we see they’re in this pool by themselves, in
text: the backyard of a secluded desert house...
text: Scattered civilization, farther away, dinos in the distance,
text: up into a cloud, until we can’t see shit anymore.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: *THE END*
