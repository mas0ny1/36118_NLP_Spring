text: OVER BLACK: We hear the sound of a pitch pipe.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: One, two, three, four --
text: As the Universal logo appears on screen, we hear Universal’s
text: theme song sung a cappella.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. LINCOLN CENTER - STAGE - CONTINUOUS 1
text: On stage, the Barden Treblemakers, an all-male a cappella
text: group dressed in matching smoking jackets, conclude singing
text: Universal's theme song.
scene_heading: BARDEN TREBLEMAKERS
speaker_heading: BRRMP BRRMP!
text: The audience cheers. Then, the Trebles begin Rihanna's,
text: “Don’t Stop The Music,” and the place goes apeshit.
speaker_heading: BARDEN TREBLEMAKERS (CONT’D)
text: PLEASE DON'T STOP THE MUSIC, MUSIC,
scene_heading: MUSIC/PLEASE DON’T STOP THE MUSIC,
dialog: MUSIC... (song continues)
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 2
text: CREDITS ROLL as a gorgeous girl, CHLOE (20), dressed like a
text: 1970's flight attendant, frantically rummages through a
text: swanky dressing room.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Shitballs, where is it?
text: Chloe stops, reaches into her jacket pocket, and pulls out a
text: red scarf. Relieved, she DASHES out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. STAGE - SAME TIME 3
text: As the BU Treblemakers sing, we WIDEN TO REVEAL: A sold out
text: audience at Lincoln Center. The atmosphere is reminiscent of
text: an American Idol finale. PROUD PARENTS, COEDS, and A
text: CAPPELLA FANATICS hold up signs: “I HEART BELLAS”, “I'LL
text: TREBLE 4 YA!”, and “A CAPPELLA IS MY CO-PILOT!”
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE STAIRWELL - SAME TIME 4
text: A winded Chloe runs up a set of stairs, clumsily wrapping the
text: scarf around her neck.
scene_heading: INT. ANNOUNCER BOOTH - SAME TIME 5
text: GAIL and JOHN, a cappella alums, color-commentate.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON:
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: This is exactly the type of
dialog: performance you would expect to see
dialog: at “The International Championship
dialog: of Collegiate A Cappella.” Isn’t
dialog: that right, Gail?
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: John, you're so right that
dialog: everything else seems wrong. This
dialog: is what the ICCA’s are all about.
text: The Barden Treblemakers. The guys are crushing
speaker_heading: JOHN (0.C.)
dialog: The Barden University Treblemakers
dialog: never disappoint. It is their
dialog: showbotage that is re-defining
dialog: modern a cappella. And the ladies,
dialog: well, they just can’t get enough.
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: Yes. Nothing makes a girl feel
text: more like a woman than a man who
text: sings like a boy.
text: A TREBLE steps forward to solo the next lyric.
speaker_heading: TREBLE SOLOIST
dialog: I WANNA TAKE YOU AWAY.
text: On the word, “Away”, he goes flat.
speaker_heading: GAIL/JOHN
dialog: Whoa! /Boom!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That was flatter than my ex-wife’s
dialog: chest. The Asian one. [get alts]
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE OF LINCOLN CENTER - SAME TIME 6
text: Chloe runs past a variety of A CAPPELLA GROUPS readying
text: themselves to compete, stopping at the all-female Bellas: A
text: group of model-esque ladies dressed exactly like her. Chloe
text: lifts up her scarf and comes face to face with Alice.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: 6
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: I found it!
text: On stage the BU Treblemakers continue singing.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Chloe, look at you. You’re a mess.
text: ALICE, the aggressive leader, undoes Chloe's scarf and then
text: methodically re-ties it.
speaker_heading: ALICE (CONT'D)
dialog: You’re unreliable. You’re
dialog: unfocused. And your breath smells
dialog: like egg. Like, all the time.
text: Alice pushes the knot up to Chloe's throat. Chloe winces.
text: Then, Alice turns to address both Chloe and AUBREY, an
text: exceptionally focused girl standing next to her.
speaker_heading: ALICE (CONT'D)
dialog: I can’t believe the Bellas are in
dialog: the hands of you two slut bags
dialog: after we graduate.
text: Alice gets right up in Aubrey’s face.
speaker_heading: ALICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Eff up your solo, and I’‘1l tell
dialog: everyone you were born without a
dialog: butthole and it all just comes out
dialog: the front.
speaker_heading: AUBREY
dialog: I won’t disappoint you. My dad
dialog: always says if you’re not here to
dialog: win, get the hell out of Kuwait.
scene_heading: INT. STAGE/ORCHESTRA PIT/BACKSTAGE/STAGE - CONTINUOUS 7
text: The Trebles end their performance to wild applause.
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: With a couple of shaky notes in
dialog: there, it’s anybody’s game now.
dialog: Next up, BU’s other group, The
dialog: Barden Bellas.
text: BACKSTAGE: The Trebles brush past the Bellas. BUMPER, the
text: Trebles outspoken ringleader, stops to address them.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: 7
speaker_heading: BUMPER
dialog: (“genuine”)
dialog: Good luck out there. Seriously. I
dialog: mean that. You guys are
dialog: awesome...ly horrible. I hate you.
dialog: Kill yourselves.
dialog: (all girly)
dialog: Girl Power! Sisters before
dialog: Misters! Go get ‘em gang!
text: Bumper crosses away. An infuriated Alice turns to the ladies.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Now or never, bitches! HANDS IN!
text: Alice puts her fist out. Nine others meet hers.
speaker_heading: ALICE (CONT'D)
dialog: One, two --
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: (Mariah Carey-high note)
speaker_heading: -- AHHH!
speaker_heading: EMCEE (0.C.)
dialog: Please give it up for the Barden
dialog: Bellas!
text: The ladies run out on stage and take their position. Alice
text: steps up to the microphone.
speaker_heading: JOHN (0.C.)
dialog: The Bellas. Making history as the
dialog: first all-female group to ever
dialog: advance to the ICCA finals.
speaker_heading: GAIL (0.C.)
dialog: John, why do you think it’s taken
dialog: so long for an all-lady group to
text: break through the glass ceiling of
dialog: a cappella?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Well, women typically can’t hit the
dialog: low notes that round out a musical
dialog: arrangement and that limits them.
dialog: They’re about as good at a cappella
text: as they are at being doctors.
text: ON STAGE: Alice blows the pitch pipe. It’s red with a large
text: cursive “B” on it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2) 7
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: One, two, three, four...
text: They begin the arrangement and choreography to Ace of Base’s,
text: ‘The Sign’. The performance is over-polished and safe.
speaker_heading: ALICE (CONT'D)
text: RAMBOON NA BOO YEAH!/I, I GOTTA NEW
text: LIFE, YOU WOULD HARDLY RECOGNIZE
text: ME, I’M SO GLAD... (song continues)
speaker_heading: GAIL (0.C.)
dialog: So just how did the Bellas make it
dialog: to the finals?
speaker_heading: JOHN (0.C.)
dialog: Hard work, Gail. When it comes to
dialog: the technical aspects of the
text: performance, they never falter.
dialog: Plus they are very good looking.
speaker_heading: ALICE
scene_heading: IT’S ENOUGH, ENOUGH.
speaker_heading: BELLAS
speaker_heading: OO-OO0000H!
speaker_heading: ALICE
text: IT’S ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT I...
text: “The Sign” rendition has lulled the audience into a coma-like
text: state. One JUDGE even yawns.
speaker_heading: GAIL (0.S.)
dialog: Feels like we all just took a left
text: turn into Snoozeville, John.
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: And parked in a lot where they do
dialog: not validate.
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: At this level of competition
dialog: they’re a little too traditional,
dialog: don’t you think? No surprise
dialog: factor.
speaker_heading: JOHN (0.C.)
dialog: Yes. It’s like after nine years of
dialog: marriage knowing exactly what my
dialog: Orthodox Jewish wife will be
dialog: wearing to bed.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3) 7
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: The wig, John?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: And the wool skirt.
text: John and Gail wince. Aubrey steps up to solo.
speaker_heading: AUBREY (INTO MIC)
text: UNDER THE PALE MOON WHERE I SEE A
text: LOT OF STARS/IT’S ENOUGH TO KNOW/I
scene_heading: SAW THE SIGN AND IT OPE(NED)...
text: Aubrey projectile PUKES and we FREEZE. The puke hangs there
text: frozen in mid-air.
scene_heading: TITLE CARD: PITCH PERFECT. END OPENING CREDITS.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 8
text: We hear Kansas’s, “Carry On Wayward Son” as a Prius travels
text: down the highway, passing a sign: “Barden Univ., Next Exit.”
scene_heading: TITLE CARD: FOUR MONTHS LATER.
scene_heading: EXT. BARDEN UNIVERSITY - ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 9
text: Move-In Day. GREETERS in polo shirts direct traffic. A taxi
text: pulls up carrying BECA MITCHELL, a pretty freshman with
text: heavy eyeliner. Beca listens to a dub step remix of Sia’s
text: “Titanium” on a pair of DJ-style headphones.
speaker_heading: GREETER
dialog: (super chipper)
dialog: Hi there! Welcome to Barden
dialog: University. What dorm?
text: Beca takes off her headphones.
speaker_heading: BECA
dialog: Baker Hall, I think.
text: The Greeter pulls out a map.
speaker_heading: GREETER
dialog: Okay, here's what you're going to
dialog: do. Take that first right...
text: The Prius pulls into BU. A MOM drives and a DAD sits
text: shotgun. JESSE, a confident underdog with boyish good looks
text: sits in the back and sings “Wayward” out the window.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10
dialog: All
dialog: 11
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: 9
speaker_heading: JESSE
text: CARRY ON MY WAYWARD SON...
text: The Prius pulls right along side Beca’s taxi, near the
text: greeters. Beca turns to see Jesse singing in the backseat.
dialog: They lock eyes. You think he'll stop singing. He doesn’t.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: CARRY ON, YOU WILL ALWAYS
text: REMEMBER! /CARRY ON, NOTHING...
text: Beca stares in confused wonderment as Jesse continues to
text: sing. After a beat, the Prius pulls away. The Greeter’s
text: voice snaps Beca back to reality.
speaker_heading: GREETER
dialog: +. And your official BU rape
dialog: whistle. Don’t blow it unless it’s
dialog: actually happening. Nobody likes
dialog: that.
text: Beca reluctantly takes the whistle as the taxi pulls away.
scene_heading: EXT. BAKERS RESIDENCE HALL - MOMENTS LATER 10
text: On the lawn, FRAT GUYS use numbered paddles to rate the
text: Freshmen girls as they walk by. A GAY COUPLE helps their SON
text: unload IKEA-like furniture from a mini-van. Beca takes it all
text: in, not looking particularly enthused.
speaker_heading: OMIT All
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - CONTINUOUS 11
text: Beca’s shy, KOREAN ROOMMATE is already there. She sits at
text: the edge of her bed, silent.
speaker_heading: BECA

scene_heading: EXT. KENNEDY HALL - CONTINUOUS 12
text: Jesse stands outside the Prius with two large duffel bags.
text: His mom won’t release him from a long embrace.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Okay. Can’t breath.
text: Mom lets go. Dad hugs him just as hard.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Here we go.
scene_heading: INT. BAKER HALL DORM ROOM - CONTINUOUS 13
text: Kimmy Jin hasn’t moved. Beca nervously talks as she unzips
text: her suitcase, pulling out a set of turn-tables and assorted
text: deejay equipment.
speaker_heading: BECA
dialog: (re: equipment)
dialog: Well, this is it. My music is
dialog: everything to me, Kimmy Jin. So
dialog: please don’t touch, cool? Like
dialog: ever, okay?
text: Kimmy Jin just stares. Beca tries to read her for a moment.
speaker_heading: BECA (CONT’D)
dialog: It is extremely important to me
dialog: that you acknowledge this
dialog: interaction.
scene_heading: EXT. DORM ROOM/INT. DORM ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 14
text: Jesse opens the door to find BENJI APPLEBAUM hanging a Tie-
text: Fighter mobile over his bed. Benji’s a benevolent nerd who

text: WIDEN TO REVEAL: A room decorated with huge amounts of sci-fi
text: memorabilia: A life-sized Darth Vader, a twenty-sided die
text: chair, a Battlestar tribute wall, and a big box with swords
text: sticking through it. A beat, as Jesse and Benji take it in.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Looking at it now, I can see that
dialog: it’s a lot. I’11 take it down --
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No way! Took me a second for my
dialog: eyes to adjust but I can roll with
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Just so you know. I’m not a total
dialog: nerd. I also happen to be super
dialog: into close-up magic.
text: Benji pulls a hamster out of his sleeve.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Dude! That’s awesome!
dialog: Benji nods, “I’m pretty good.” Then:
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: How long was the little guy in
dialog: there?
scene_heading: INT. BECA’S DORM ROOM - CONTINUOUS 15
text: Beca finishes converting her desk into a musical workstation.

text: A MAN speaks in falsetto.
speaker_heading: MAN (0.S.)
dialog: It’s Missy, your R.A! You guys
dialog: keep it down in there!
text: Beca opens the door to reveal DR. FRANCIS MITCHELL, (49), a

scene_heading: JOB TITLE TBD. *

speaker_heading: DR. MITCHELL (CONT’D)
dialog: So when did you get here? How did
dialog: you get here?
speaker_heading: BECA
text: Took a cab from the airport.
dialog: Didn't want to inconvenience you
dialog: and Sheila. How is the
dialog: stepmonster?
speaker_heading: DR MITCHELL
text: She’s great. She’s on her way to
dialog: Vegas. Never been before. Gave
dialog: her my lucky...
speaker_heading: BECA
dialog: Don’t really care, dad. Just
dialog: wanted to say “stepmonster.”
speaker_heading: DR. MITCHELL
dialog: Fair enough. Well do I at least
dialog: get a hug? It’s been a while since
dialog: I've seen you!
dialog: *
text: Dr. Mitchell forces a hug on Beca. Beca doesn't hug back.
speaker_heading: BECA
dialog: Well, that’s what happens when you
dialog: leave your wife and daughter and
dialog: move 3000 miles away for some
dialog: hooker.
dialog: +e * HF
speaker_heading: DR. MITCHELL
dialog: (to Kimmy)

dialog: label, start paying my dues --
speaker_heading: DR. MITCHELL
dialog: Oh boy. Here we go again. Beca,
dialog: DJ’‘ing is not a profession. It’s a
dialog: hobby. Unless you’re Rick Dees or
dialog: someone awesome like that --
speaker_heading: BECA
dialog: I don’t want to just deejay. I want
dialog: to produce music. Make music --
speaker_heading: DR. MITCHELL
dialog: You're getting a college education.
dialog: For free, I might add. End of
dialog: story.
speaker_heading: BECA
dialog: Great. So instead of getting real
dialog: world experience in what I actually
dialog: want to do with my life, I'll spend
text: four years studying on the grass.
text: There’s an awkward beat of silence.
speaker_heading: KIMMY JIN

text: Newspaper,” another reads “Dudes With Ponytails. Est. 1988.”
text: Beca, headphones around her neck, and Kimmy Jin are at the
text: booth: “RIAC: Running in a Circle.” Two REPRESENTATIVES give
dialog: Beca the hard sell.
speaker_heading: RIAC REPRESENTATIVE #1
dialog: Basically what we do is we join
text: arms in a large ring and we run
dialog: clockwise and sometimes we’ll do
dialog: variations on that.
speaker_heading: RIAC REPRESENTATIVE #2
dialog: It’s really about movement and,
dialog: health, circulation, mimicking the
text: earth’s orbit around the sun.
speaker_heading: BECA
dialog: So you run around in a circle?
speaker_heading: RIAC REPRESENTATIVE #1
dialog: And so can you.

speaker_heading: RIAC REPRESENTATIVE #1

text: Amazingly, a HANDFUL OF PRETTY GIRLS gather around to listen.
speaker_heading: BENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: The Treblemakers. The rock stars
