speaker_heading: BOB COSTAS (V.0.)
dialog: Before the NBA was the NBA, there
dialog: was another basketball league in
dialog: America...
text: DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: This is real ABA footage. A series of
dialog: great plays are made by ABA stars.
speaker_heading: BOB COSTAS (V.0.)
dialog: .From 1967 to 1976, there was the
dialog: American Basketball Association. A
dialog: maverick minor-league that would
dialog: change the game forever. The ABA
dialog: made the fast break FAST...
dialog: Invented the three point shot...
dialog: And introduced the world to
dialog: something called the Slam Dunk
dialog: Contest.
text: DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: Dr. J launches from the foul line and
text: dunks in the world's first dunk contest. David Thompson
text: finishes an Alley Oop.
speaker_heading: BOB COSTAS (V.0.)
dialog: Singer Pat Boone owned the Oakland
dialog: Oaks. Wilt Chambelain coached the
dialog: Conquistadors. I myself was the
dialog: young voice of the St. Louis
dialog: Spirits.
text: DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: A young Bob Costas broadcasts from St.
text: Louis, looking pretty sweet in side burns and a tweed jacket.
speaker_heading: BOB COSTAS (V.O.)
dialog: Players like Dr. J, Ice-man George
dialog: Gervin and Moses Malone were as
dialog: entertaining as they come. But
dialog: despite the league's flair,
dialog: convincing fans to show up for
dialog: games was often a struggle.
text: DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: The infamous TV interview where Freddy
text: Lewis wins a 'race horse.' Footage of 'Dime Beer Night.'

dialog: One night, the Nets went as far as
dialog: to give a free gerbil to it's first
dialog: fifty fans... There were plenty of
dialog: punches too, giving the National
dialog: Hockey League a run for it's money.
text: DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: A guy elbows Connie Hawkins, who turns
text: and punches the guy in the face.
speaker_heading: BOB COSTAS (V.0.)

dialog: own. The hair was big, the shorts
dialog: were short and the ball was red,
text: white and blue.
text: DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: Harry 'The fat Mexican guy' dances.
speaker_heading: BOB COSTAS (V.0.)
dialog: In 1976, rumors of a merger spread

dialog: only four teams would join the NBA
dialog: and survive.
text: QUICK CUTS: THE PACERS. THE NUGGETS. THE NETS. THE SPURS.
speaker_heading: BOB COSTAS (V.0.)

speaker_heading: LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
dialog: The Amigos are up by one here.

speaker_heading: PATRELLI
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: Sorry, Monix, I got pushed.
speaker_heading: LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
dialog: Well, it looks like the Amigos are
dialog: in trouble here. Monix is a ninety
dialog: percent shooter, if he can hit both
text: of these free throws, it's over.
text: Monix performs his ancient free throw ritual: Three dribbles
text: and a quick spin of the ball. But he MISSES.
speaker_heading: DRUNK LADY
dialog: HA. NICE SHOT MONIX! YOU FUCKIN'
text: SUCK, MAN! YOU SUCK DONKEY DICK.

speaker_heading: LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)

speaker_heading: LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
dialog: Yes! He just pegged a chick! That's
dialog: the greatest thing I've ever seen.
text: The lady runs on court and attacks Monix, her boyfriend jumps
text: in -- Monix hits her boyfriend with some quick hockey
text: punches. The benches clear, everyone is punching everybody.
speaker_heading: LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
dialog: (re: violent fist fight)
dialog: And we've got a little bit of
text: pushing and shoving under the

dialog: Lou?
speaker_heading: LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
dialog: I'm goin' in.

speaker_heading: COMMISH

speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON

speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON

speaker_heading: LOSING OWNER #2
dialog: He's right.
speaker_heading: LOSING OWNER #1
dialog: Yeah, that's the fairest way.
speaker_heading: COMMISH

speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON

speaker_heading: LOSING OWNER #2
dialog: Yeah, maybe we should finish the

speaker_heading: COMMISH
dialog: This plan sounds like a lot of fun,

speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: There's no way we can make it to

speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON

speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Eighty-two percent? Isn't that a

speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON

speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON

speaker_heading: DUKES
dialog: It's written in glitter, dude.
dialog: Can't you just give me, like, a

speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON

speaker_heading: ADJ--
text: Monix interrupts Jackie, pissed. He addresses the team,
text: stepping in front of Jackie Moon.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: --This is bullshit guys. They're
dialog: kicking our ass in basketball and
dialog: they're kicking our ass during the
dialog: commercials, too. Does anybody here
dialog: understand the concept of the pick
dialog: and roll? Because they're going to
dialog: keep double teaming at the top of
text: the key until somebody rotates the
dialog: Damn ball...
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: Yeah! C'mon guys! Rotate the ball.
text: Monix looks at this group and gets even madder.

speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: Does anyone in this room have any
dialog: pride? Don't you realize, this is
dialog: thelast four weeks of basketball
dialog: anyus are ever going to play?Is
dialog: thishow we're really going togo
dialog: out?You'd think we'd want toend
text: ourcareers battling, hustling

text: Twiggy Munson and Scootsie Double-Day hang their heads.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: We're a bunch of selfish assholes --
dialog: And I've got news for you, we
dialog: aren't going to finish in fourth,
dialog: we're going to finish dead last.
text: Monix paces in front of the guys, a man possessed.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: One day, you're going to look back
dialog: on your life... And you're going to
dialog: look back on this time... And
dialog: you're going to realize...
text: Monix is staring right at Clarence. And Clarence is actually
dialog: listening...
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: .You're going to realize you
dialog: never even played basketball.
text: A moment of silence after the intensity. Monix waddles to the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: Now, you guys have fun out there in
dialog: the second half. If anyone needs
dialog: me, I'll be in the training room,
dialog: draining my knee.
text: Monix limps off, everyone's head is hanging low.
scene_heading: SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY

speaker_heading: BEE BEE ELLIS

speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON

dialog: have to go out of state.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I would if I could, but if I give
dialog: you another check, that would be
dialog: two checks. That would be $20,000,

dialog: pull here?
dialog: (the other line rings)
dialog: I've got to take this other call
dialog: Dukes. Bye!--

scene_heading: INT. FLINT MICHIGAN TROPICS STADIUM - MOMENTS LATER

text: The entire basketball team is on their hands and knees
text: ASSEMBLING THE HARD WOOD. This is a lot of work. Clarence
text: hits his thumb with a hammer.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Why do we have to put the court
dialog: together?
scene_heading: SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
dialog: I guess the Ice Capades sold out.
speaker_heading: BEE BEE ELLIS
dialog: Yeah, kids love that stuff.

speaker_heading: CLARENCE

speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON (O.S. )
dialog: Guys.
text: The guys look up to find Jackie. He does not look happy.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: The commissioner just called.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: I looks like we've got ourselves a
dialog: situation. We've got some new
dialog: 'terms and conditions' for this
dialog: merger deal.
scene_heading: SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
dialog: What'd he say?
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: Basically, we've got to average at
dialog: least 2,000 fans per home game for
dialog: the rest of the year.
speaker_heading: TWIGGY MUNSON
dialog: 2,000 people? Every home game?
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: He said the NBA will only take a
dialog: franchise that has fans.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Shit. Winning is going to be hard.
dialog: But getting 2,000 people to watch
dialog: is going to be impossible.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: Let's try and stay positive. My
dialog: Mother always believed Flint was a
dialog: town of destiny. And I believe
dialog: that. Now, I've already started
dialog: work on a huge idea to promote us.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: What kind of huge idea?
scene_heading: INT. THE KREMLIN - DAY

text: another pack of Kools.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER

speaker_heading: MONIX
speaker_heading: (ANGRY)

dialog: alright?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Do you have any idea where Lynn is

speaker_heading: BARTENDER

speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Listen, I know you and I haven't
dialog: always been the best of buddies.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 57.
dialog: But I've been thinking about what
dialog: you said the other night. This is
dialog: gonna be our last chance. If I'm
dialog: ever going to get into the NBA,
dialog: it's going to be with the Tropics.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: I hate to break it to you,
dialog: Clarence, but the Tropics will
dialog: never play in the NBA.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: So maybe we won't. But like you
dialog: said, I don't want to look back on
dialog: this with any regrets. I know what
dialog: you think of me. But I'm willing to
dialog: put our differences aside. I'm
dialog: telling you right now, I'll do
dialog: whatever it takes to win.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: You mean, like, pass?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: I would consider passing, yes.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: Sorry kid. Even if I wanted to play
dialog: harder, this knee won't let me.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: I'm not just talking about you
dialog: playing point guard... I'm talking
dialog: about you teaching us...
dialog: Monix could not be less interested.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Monix, you know more about
dialog: basketball than any man who's ever
text: set foot in Flint.
dialog: Monix drinks, not into it...
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: All I'm saying is, instead of
dialog: getting so pissed off at us all the
dialog: time, why not just show us what the
dialog: Hell you're talking about? Coach us
dialog: a little. I mean, we can't get any
dialog: worse.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: And why should I give a shit about
dialog: the Tropics?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: I know you. You've got all that
dialog: basketball shit stored up in your
dialog: head. I know you're dying to pass
dialog: it down to somebody. Why not us?
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: What about Jackie? He's the coach.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
text: Jackie's got his hands full, trying
dialog: to sell tickets. He's obsessed.
dialog: (looking up, re: TV)
text: HEY! IT'S OUR VIDEO! TURN THE SOUND
dialog: UP!
scene_heading: ECU: THE TROPIC'S VIDEO ON TELEVISION.

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. MONIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: I know what it takes to be a real

speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (re: his knee)
dialog: Stay still.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: And that's the reason you won't
dialog: coach them?
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: It doesn't matter. The truth is, I
dialog: hate basketball right now.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Do you really hate basketball? Or
dialog: do you hate yourself?
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: Why would I hate myself?
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Well, for one, you cheated on me.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: You hate me for that. Not me.
text: Lynn just stares at him.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: Okay, maybe I hate myself a little.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You don't wear the ring around your
dialog: neck anymore.
dialog: (no response)
dialog: Where is it?
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: I rode the bench through the
dialog: playoffs, Lynn.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Monix, that was greatest moment of
dialog: your career. And you look back on
text: it like some kind of embarrassment.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: Riding the bench was the greatest
dialog: moment of my career?
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You did more than ride the bench,
dialog: Monix.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: What else did I do?
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Every practice, you took your team
dialog: to the limit. I know you did. I was
dialog: the one draining this stupid knee
dialog: of yours every night. The Celtics
dialog: were practicing against you, Monix.
dialog: And when you ran that scout team,
dialog: you were running Milwaukee's
dialog: offense better than their first
dialog: stringers ever could.
text: Lynn continues the business of disposing fluid into the
text: toilet and preparing another syringe.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: By game time, your team knew where
dialog: Milwaukee was going to be before
dialog: their own players did. The Celtics
dialog: made the right adjustments to win
dialog: that series. And those adjustments
dialog: came from you.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: So, I should be proud of running
dialog: the scout team?
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Dave Cowens put that ring in the
dialog: palm of your hand. And he told you
dialog: to wear it with pride, because you
dialog: were a champion. And he meant it
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: He was being a nice guy. The bench
dialog: is the bench.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Your whole life, you've bitched
dialog: about people playing selfish. It
dialog: takes a team to win, right?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: But when you're on the team, your
dialog: effort doesn't count? Is that it?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: If you weren't on the Celtics that
dialog: year, would they have won it?
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: Watch that needle.
speaker_heading: LYNN

speaker_heading: MONIX

speaker_heading: LYNN

text: Monix looks away for a moment.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: Why are you doing this? What does

speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: What's it matter? You're drinking
dialog: yourself to death!
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: God, I wish I hated you as much as
dialog: you hate yourself!
text: Lynn throws the needle. Monix dodges it.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I made sacrifices! How many years
dialog: did I support you? And finally,
dialog: after all of our blood and sweat
dialog: and bullshit together, you got
dialog: there, Monix! You made it, you won
dialog: an NBA championship ring. It wasn't
dialog: just about you, okay? And I'm sick
dialog: of you acting like you're some kind
dialog: of joke. You didn't blow it. You're
dialog: not a fraud. You're not a fake
dialog: champion. And all the time we spent
dialog: together, fighting for you to get
dialog: to that moment, was not a waste!
dialog: You're a champion, you asshole!
speaker_heading: (BEAT)

speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: Nice leg kick Kong. Those flexible

speaker_heading: (BEAT)

dialog: then we start the game after that.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Are we going to practice or what?
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: This is practice, okay Clarence? We

text: He begins pacing around, more passionate than ever...
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: From now on, I want our afros
dialog: bigger... And shinier ... . I want
dialog: our shorts shorter... And
dialog: tighter... We're going to pull our

dialog: have before.
text: The team seems to be looking off screen.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: What's wrong?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: on the court, everyone feels kind of stupid.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: Hey, you're back! Listen, you
dialog: should probably chalk your hands up
dialog: for this number.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Jackie, I asked Monix to coach us.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: Coach?
text: Jackie is totally thrown by this. He looks around at the
text: team. Clearly, a decision has been made.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: What do you mean, coach?
dialog: (truly hurt)
dialog: What is this? What's going on?
dialog: (staring his team down)
dialog: It's a Mutiny.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Jackie. Don't be like that.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: Hold on a second. Last time I
dialog: checked, we didn't live in Flint,
dialog: Russia. We live in Flint, America.
dialog: I'm coach until a new one is
dialog: elected.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Don't make us elect Monix, man.
dialog: (Jackie Moon holds firm)
dialog: Alright, show of hands. Who wants
dialog: Monix to step in as player-coach?
text: Everyone feels bad, but they all raise their hands.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: Please God No.
speaker_heading: TWIGGY MUNSON

speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: (starting to cry)
dialog: It's cool. I get it. I'm a big boy,

text: Jackie cries harder.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Don't take it so hard, Jackie.
dialog: You're a great owner. We all know
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: Woah. Hold on. Did you just say
dialog: 'great owner?'
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Yeah. Everyone thinks so.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: Now, when you said great owner,
dialog: were you just saying that? Because
dialog: it's not cool to mess with me about
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: We mean it. For real. Monix is just
dialog: more of an X's and O's kind of guy,
dialog: that's all.
text: Jackie is emotional. It's a bittersweet moment. He takes off
text: his whistle, then walks over and hands Monix his whistle.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: (re: The whistle)
dialog: Here. You may need this.
text: Now he pulls out a bunch of crazy notes on loose paper
text: written in ball point pen. The pages look insane.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: (handing him papers)
dialog: And here are some ideas for plays
dialog: I've jotted down. Just thoughts.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: Thanks Jackie.
dialog: (to the team)
dialog: The way I see it, any team in this
dialog: league can put together a run. Most
dialog: of our opponents are all flash. If
dialog: we play unselfish, fundamental
dialog: basketball, we can win games.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: I like it. Unselfish, guys.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: Yes. Unselfish. Unselfish meaning
dialog: tough team defense, full and half
dialog: court traps, boxing your man out to
text: help the team rebound.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Unselfish means sprinting up the
dialog: floor on every fast break NOT
dialog: because you can get a DUNK -- and
dialog: get your DICK SUCKED after the game
dialog: -- but because if you sprint up the
dialog: floor you might pull the defense
text: out of position and free a teammate
dialog: up for a high percentage shot.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: Wait, so, what's going on with the
dialog: blow jobs?
speaker_heading: BEE BEE ELLIS
dialog: I vote we keep the blow jobs.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: (raising his hand)
dialog: All in favor?
text: Everyone raises their hands in favor of blow jobs.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Would everyone let the man talk
dialog: please?
text: Clarence is serious. This shuts everyone up.
scene_heading: INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - LATER
text: The starters have gotten into position, guarded by the scout
text: team, in blue jerseys.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: The most important work we do on
dialog: the court is away from the
dialog: basketball.
text: Monix FLIPS OPEN A SWITCH BLADE KNIFE AND STABS THE BALL,
text: deflating it. This gets everyone's attention.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: (re: deflated ball)
dialog: Until you start moving like a real
dialog: team, you practice without a ball.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 67.
text: He flings the deflated ball into the bleachers and snaps the
dialog: knife closed.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: Alright, Clarence, run the offense.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: I don't get it.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: Set a pick for somebody.
text: Clarence jogs over and stands next a scout team opponent.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: Okay, that's kind of a pick, I
dialog: guess. Try standing on the other
dialog: side of Scootsie's man, so you free
text: him up to cut into the lane.
text: Monix corrects Clarence, moving his body the way he wants him
dialog: to stand.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: Widen your stance. Plant your feet.
dialog: Hands back. Like this. Now Scootsie
text: GO. Set a pick for Jackie.
text: Scootsie cuts across the lane. The team slowly gets i
text: rotating faster.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: Now Jackie pick Bee Bee's man, and
dialog: rotate to the rim like this...
text: Everyone move to the open space.
dialog: And Clarence you swing back out up
dialog: top.
text: They've completed the play. Monix stands there, smiling. The
dialog: players look at each other, what's the big deal?
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: You know what that was?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: What.
speaker_heading: MONIX
text: A flash to the high side post with
text: an outside screen and a back door
dialog: cut. Let's do it again.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Ei 8.
speaker_heading: BEE BEE ELLIS
dialog: Hey, how come you don't have to run
dialog: with us? You're a player, just like
dialog: the rest of us.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: I'm saving my knee for the games.
text: Coach's decision. NOW RUN.
text: Clarence sets a screen for Scootsie and they perform the same
dialog: basic rotation.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: (as they run)
dialog: We're not just rotating, we're
text: clearing out, making space. A pass
dialog: and cut can change defensive match-
dialog: ups. Creating seams can give us
text: back door looks. Down screens can
dialog: make a team vulnerable to
dialog: penetration.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: Hold on. I'm lost.
speaker_heading: BEE BEE ELLIS
dialog: No shit. What's up with all of
dialog: these fucked up words, man?
speaker_heading: TWIGGY MUNSON
dialog: Yeah, what are we, building some
dialog: kind of basketball space. ship?
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: You don't have to understand it

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: Yeah, maybe we could try, like,
dialog: play number two.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: No. We're running this play. We're
dialog: running this play until we puke.
speaker_heading: BEE BEE ELLIS
dialog: Basically, we have.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: Yeah, I'm pretty beat.
speaker_heading: MONIX
dialog: 'Until we puke' is not a figure of
dialog: speech. We are literally going to
dialog: puke.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: What does he mean by 'literally?'
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
text: I think he's talking about vomit.
speaker_heading: BEE BEE ELLIS

speaker_heading: MONIX

speaker_heading: BEE BEE ELLIS

speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: She married me because of my song,

dialog: with her.
dialog: (more emotional)
dialog: Deep down, I feel like it's really

speaker_heading: KYLE

speaker_heading: LYNN

speaker_heading: MONIX

speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON

speaker_heading: CLARENCE THE REF
dialog: Maybe we should call it off.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON

speaker_heading: BEAR HANDLER
dialog: You guys want to give me a safe
dialog: word?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE THE REF
dialog: What's a safe word?
speaker_heading: BEAR HANDLER
dialog: It's a word for you to yell to the
text: Ref, so he can stop the match.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: I don't need a safe word.
speaker_heading: BEAR HANDLER
dialog: Tell you what, if you get injured
dialog: or you really feel like you're in
dialog: danger, yell, um, I don't know...
dialog: Spumoni. Once I get a signal from
dialog: the ref, I'll come in.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE THE REF
dialog: What's Spumoni?
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: It's an Italian Gelato, sort of

speaker_heading: CLARENCE THE REF
dialog: Is it good?
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: I don't know, I've never had it.

dialog: Okay, fuck this.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE THE REF
dialog: What? You can't quit already.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: SPUMONI. I'm out of here.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE THE REF
dialog: You can't SPUMONI, all he did was
dialog: scratch his nuts.
speaker_heading: JACKIE MOON
dialog: Well, too bad, I'm SPUMONI-ING.
text: PEOPLE START TO BOO. Jackie looks around at the angry crowd.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE THE REF
dialog: You gotta give 'em a show. C'mon,
dialog: the bear seems pretty tired, look
text: at him.
dialog: It's true, the bear is pretty docile. The bear's indifference
text: gives Jackie a glimmer of confidence.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE THE REF
dialog: Just test him out a little. Maybe
dialog: it won't be so bad.
text: Jackie nods, then hops around with his dukes in the air. Now
text: he does a shuffle for the crowd. After dancing a bit, the
text: bear is still motionless.

speaker_heading: LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
dialog: The first attempt is... GOOD!

speaker_heading: LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
