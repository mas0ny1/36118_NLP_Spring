text: A breeze ripples crops.
text: Hay bales next to a fence surrounding the farmland.
text: The ground shakes. Four gigantic dinosaur feet walk by. The
text: camera reveals a massive shadow, and then... an Apatosaurus,
text: walking across his farm. This is HENRY.
text: BOOM! Henry uses his tail to knock down a tree. He adds it to
text: a large pile. He digs his snout into the ground, plows long
text: furrows into the tough dirt.
text: Alongside Henry is his hardworking Apatosaurus wife, IDA,

speaker_heading: NEWBORN LIBBY (0.S.)
dialog: (squeaky roar)

dialog: Libby.

text: shakes his head.
speaker_heading: POPPA
dialog: Hello, Buck.

speaker_heading: POPPA
dialog: Alright, this is gonna be a big

speaker_heading: POPPA
dialog: Hello Arlo.
text: Arlo looks up at his Poppa and Momma, then goes back down

speaker_heading: POPPA
dialog: Come on out.

speaker_heading: MOMMA
dialog: Look at you.

speaker_heading: ARLO
dialog: My poppa would still be alive if it

text: He’s surrounded by cliff walls.
speaker_heading: ARLO
dialog: Momma?
dialog: No reply.
speaker_heading: ARLO
dialog: Momma!

text: on the ground a moment, bruised and battered, catching his
dialog: breath.
text: A HOWL goes up.
text: Startled, Arlo looks up and sees a figure at the top of the
dialog: cliff. It’s the same critter/boy from the farm! The boy looks
text: down at Arlo, in what seems like curiosity. Arlo isn’t
dialog: curious -- he’s pissed!
speaker_heading: ARLO

text: and uses his hind legs to kick dirt in Arlo’s face.
text: That’s it! Arlo’s had it! He rolls himself up the ledge ready
text: to fight! But the boy is gone. Human hand and foot prints
text: lead into the wilderness.
speaker_heading: ARLO
dialog: That's right, you better run!
text: PSSHHHH. The SOUND OF A GEYSER echoes through the wilderness.

scene_heading: EXT. RIVER'S EDGE - DAY (LATER)
text: Arlo, tired, hungry, following the river through the woods.

dialog: finds nothing.
text: SQUISH. Arlo steps on berries scattered on the ground. He
text: tastes the squashed fruit off his foot... it’s pretty good.
text: His stomach GROWLS. Arlo looks up the hillside, a BERRY TREE!
scene_heading: EXT. ROCKY SLOPE/BERRY TREE - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)
text: Arlo balances on a boulder, trying to reach the berries
text: hanging high in a tree.
text: The boulder tilts down the small incline... Arlo almost loses
text: his balance, but catches himself. His hunger is making him
text: more daring. He stretches his neck forward, blowing on the
text: berries to get them to swing closer to him. He tries to grab
dialog: them with his teeth. Almost got them --
text: CRACK. The boulder gives way, tumbling down the slope. Arlo
text: crashes to the ground! BAM... BAM.
text: Arlo lays there stunned, frustrated. He picks himself up --
text: BUT HIS FOOT IS CAUGHT. He pulls, but it’s stuck fast between

scene_heading: THE GOOD DINOSAUR - Academy Screenplay - 10/26/2015 27.

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROCKY SLOPE - DAY
text: Arlo wakes up, not sure for a moment where he is. Then he
dialog: remembers... looks at his foot... but it’s free now, the

text: He sees human tracks in the dirt. The same tracks he saw

scene_heading: EXT. RIVER'S EDGE/WOODLAND - DAY (LATER)
text: Arlo walking along the river through the wilderness. He

text: WILDERNESS CRITTERS scurry across the ground. The drizzle
text: turns into rain. Arlo’s footprints become puddles.
speaker_heading: THUNDERCLAP.
text: Arlo collects sticks to build a makeshift shelter. But after
text: only propping up three sticks, they tumble to the ground.
text: Nearby creatures are nestled in their dwellings, dry, safe.
text: Arlo notices one FURRY CRITTER, sitting under an overhung
dialog: rock, has taken particular interest in watching Arlo’s
dialog: efforts.
text: Arlo tries positioning larger branches, and has more success.
text: He sits inside his shelter, proud, smiling at the critter
text: under the rock. The critter keeps staring. Arlo sticks his
text: tongue out at it. DRIP. DRIP. SPLASH. A puddle pours down
text: onto Arlo’s face.
text: The critter squeaks, as if laughing at Arlo. It goes away and
text: comes back with TWO OTHER CRITTERS (implying “let’s watch
text: this”). They all squeak, staring at Arlo. Arlo groans,
dialog: frustrated.

speaker_heading: ARLO
dialog: You again?!
text: The boy lays the lizard in front of Arlo.
speaker_heading: ARLO
dialog: Get outta here!

text: The lizard comes awake, runs off.
text: The boy growls at Arlo and leaves, rushing back into the
dialog: brush.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Arlo sleeping in his shelter. The rain is much lighter now.
text: The boy flies in on a BUG, over Arlo’s head, landing in the

dialog: to eat it.
text: Arlo looks at the bug in front of him. The head moving back
dialog: and forth. Yuck.
text: The boy notices Arlo looking at the bug’s pinchers and
text: slithering tongue, so he rips the head off! Then steps back --
dialog: “Okay now eat it.”
text: Repulsed, Arlo takes a branch, brushes the bug’s body and
text: head to the side.
text: The boy barks at Arlo, runs off again.

text: The rain has stopped.
speaker_heading: ARLO
dialog: I... am still... going to squeeze

speaker_heading: ARLO
dialog: Uh... here. More of these.

speaker_heading: ARLO

speaker_heading: ARLO
dialog: Where are you going?
text: The ground beneath Arlo narrows, each step becoming more

speaker_heading: ARLO
dialog: I-I knew it! I’m gonna die out here

dialog: Hey... hey! NO! STOP!

text: across the gap, the tip of his tail holding the other side.
text: The boy scampers across him -- he’s made Arlo into a bridge!
text: The boy climbs over Arlo’s face, stepping on his eyes.
speaker_heading: ARLO
dialog: Ow! OW!! Why you little... come
dialog: back here!

text: The T. rexes take off, their legs like galloping horses --

dialog: ON ARLO: Gulp.
text: He scoops up Spot, chases after the T. rexes.
scene_heading: EXT. BIG SKY COUNTRY - CONTINUOUS
text: The tracks have disappeared over a rise. The T. rexes stop,

text: There below them, out in Big Sky Country, is the HERD OF
speaker_heading: LONGHORNS.
dialog: No sign of any other dinosaurs.
speaker_heading: ARLO
dialog: I don’t see any rustlers.
speaker_heading: BUTCH

speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: I got a job for you.
speaker_heading: ARLO

speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: I need you to keep on the dodge and

dialog: hornheads, just hootin’ and
dialog: hollerin’ to score off them

speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Don’t over think it.
text: He pushes Arlo out into the field!
text: Arlo, with Spot on his back, goes a few steps, but does not
text: want to do this. He glances back at the T. rexes. Butch nods -
dialog: ~ "Gol"
text: Arlo steels himself (does a “get over my fear” face), and
text: moves toward the herd. He creeps through the grass, looking
text: back again. The T. rexes are now gone! Arlo continues.
text: Arlo and Spot make it to the rock. Arlo does his “get over my

text: He opens his mouth to roar... NOTHING COMES OUT! Just a
text: strangled whisper.
text: Spot watches Arlo try again -- still nothing!
dialog: Spot BITES Arlo, HE SCREAMS!

speaker_heading: BUBBHA
dialog: Howdy!

speaker_heading: LURLEANE

speaker_heading: LURLEANE
dialog: I know you’re there. I can smell
dialog: ya.
text: Butch charges in with Pervis on his back. Lurleane jumps from

text: gets whacked by Butch’s tail.
text: The Raptors pin Butch to the ground in front of Arlo!
text: Arlo freezes with fear, but seeing Butch struggling snaps
text: Arlo out of it. Determined, Arlo runs straight toward

text: Pervis is on top of Butch -- WHACK! Arlo whips him across the

speaker_heading: RAMSEY

text: Lightning flashes, Arlo flinches.
speaker_heading: ARLO
dialog: I can't.
text: Nervous, he backs away. But then he sees something that makes
